This is well beyond what has actually been done, but as I recall, pressure-chamber tests suggest that it is feasible. The ultimate limit seems to be purely a matter of how much work it is to move air in and out of your lungs, and with helium-oxygen or hydrogen-oxygen (!) (yes, really -- the percentage of oxygen is below the flammability threshold) mixtures, a 1mi (1600m) dive is thought to be possible. Nobody's actually tried it... Plants should have no problem with 100atm. However, they do need oxygen, so they couldn't use straight Venus air, even cooled down. (Yes, plants generate oxygen when in light... but they do not have a circulatory system to deliver it to where it's needed, and their roots need oxygen. This is why you can drown a plant by watering it too much: the water largely blocks diffusion of oxygen to the roots. Flooded-field plants like rice often have air plumbing running down to their roots, but it connects to the outside atmosphere, not to the photosynthetic areas in the leaves.) >Going at it from the other side -- why aren't we focusing on using very >low pressures in our stations? It increases fire hazard, it makes air cooling of electronics impossible, it's possibly unhealthy in the long run, and it greatly complicates running comparison studies between ground and space (because the ground side needs to use low-pressure chambers).

NASA doesn't have a hard firm spec applicable to zero prebreathe that I know of, if you do prebreathe then it's nontrivial to compare to a zero prebreathe system. They do have a fair amount of data on hypobarics from NASA testing, and some from on orbit activities (US and Russian). The Russians run a lot closer to getting bent, but they rigorously preselect for cosmonauts not very susceptable to getting bent (you can apparently screen it pretty well, and they push past bends ratio of 1.6 I think). Somewhere between 1.2 and 1.3 is probably the safe limit for no more than minimal effects for even average susceptability persons at no prebreathe. I personally think that if you're going to a 3-gas mix or more, you might as well do it enough that you get a bends ratio of 1.1 or lower. Between communications and biomedical issues, I suspect there's a sweet spot with 3/3/3/3 or 2.5/2.5/2.5/2.5 using O/He/Ar/N, in terms of bends, fire risk, communications, and station design issues. This may take some time and experimentation to properly analyze, but is something which would really improve our ability to live in space in the long term. -george william herbert gherbert@crl.com\n\nNewsgroups: sci.space.policy From: henry@spsystems.net (Henry Spencer) Subject: Re: Space \"Capsule\" Space Suits... a possible alternative?

In practice, I think about 8,000ft is the \"sweet spot\" for reduced pressure. It's enough to make a difference but not enough to cause real problems. In particular, almost all standard air-cooled electronics gear is rated to work at that altitude, but *not* a lot higher. Most people also find it relatively easy to adapt, which again is not true if you go much higher. I forget how high up Vail is. Santa Fe is at about 8000ft. >Aha!

Then there's the tech support camp for the observatories at 9,000 feet- it's probably easier to set up a facility there than at the summit anyway... and Hawaii has the advantage that a sea level control lab could be nearby.

Professional vac workers will want to be able to have comfortable throats and avoid lung problems which come with 5 PSI or less pure O2. There's no reason to completely avoid mixed gases. The issues are clear: the bends, which is avoided by keeping ppN2hab/suitpress to no more than 1.2 to 1.3, suit mobility which argues for minimal suitpress, minimum lung water boiling pressure pushing for not much less than 4 PSI in the lung, user comfort in the hab and in the suit, enough ppO2 in the hab and in the suit, etc etc. All things considered, 5 PSI O2 is too much of a fire hazard and is too hard on people's throats and lungs for a permanent hab. It won't kill you, but spending millions of dollars to fly an astronaut and then provide him with an irritating environment which will degrade his physical performance seems to be muchly foolish to me. The fire danger might kill you, and a lot of things burn in 5 PSI O2 which you wouldn't think burn well so designing around it materials-wise gets reaaalllyyy tricky, probably nearly impossible. Not flash fire critical like 1 atm O2 but it's still much more dangerous. There are other buffer gases which help balance out the concerns. Helium, although it introduces a slight communications problem, is great. Argon is ok. Nitrogen (with the bends ratio taken into account) is ok. So something like 3/3/3/3 or 2.5/2.5/2.5/2.5 should do fine. Variants on these (I've seen O/He/Ar/N of 4/2/2/4 before) work as well. The question of what's \"right\" is a good one, but I suspect will be something more like this than pure O2 at 1/3 atm or so. -george william herbert gherbert@crl.com\n\nNewsgroups: sci.space.policy From: henry@spsystems.net (Henry Spencer) Subject: Re: Pure Oxygen atmosphere Date: Sat, 22 Jan 2000 20:27:08 GMT In article <869vlu$5ka$1@nnrp1.deja.com>, Len (Cormier) for MMI <len@tour2space.com> wrote: >I have been under the (perhaps mistaken) impression >that 3 psi pure oxygen is no more dangerous than a >normal partial pressure of 3 psi oxygen in a 14.7 >psi atmosphere... Not so, alas. Two things matter: how much oxygen there is in the atmosphere, and how effectively it removes heat from the flame. The oxygen partial pressure pretty much determines the former. However, inert diluent gases have a big effect on the latter. So no, 3psi pure oxygen is much more dangerous than 14.7psi air, because flames hold heat better in the thin atmosphere. At the other extreme, it's quite possible to devise a breathable atmosphere which will not support a flame at all, although the pressure has to be rather higher than Earth-surface. The fire-code rule (unless it's been changed recently, my reference is a bit old) is that if the percentage of oxygen exceeds 23.45/sqrt(atm), where atm is the total pressure in atmospheres, that is an \"atmosphere of increased burning rate\". -- The space program reminds me | Henry Spencer henry@spsystems.net of a government agency. -Jim Baen | (aka henry@zoo.toronto.edu)\n\nFrom: gherbert@crl3.crl.com (George Herbert) Newsgroups: sci.space.policy Subject: Re: Space \"Capsule\" Space Suits... a possible alternative?

So will helium at high enough pressure. That's why really really deep divers use hydrogen oxygen mixtures; helium narcosis eventually becomes a terrible problem. Argon isn't nearly as anesthetic as xenon is. It's worse than nitrogen is for anesthetic effects but doesn't risk the bends nearly as much. That's why I think that an oxygen/helium/argon/nitrogen mix is likely where the best balance point is. With 3 PSI of each and a 4 PSI pure oxygen suit, the bends ratio for nitrogen alone is only 0.75, and given argon's contribution it's around 1.2 or so based on what info is available now (needs to be restudied in depth, I think). The helium content won't be high enough to wreck communications, the ppO2 is only 25% of the total gas mix, which given that the total pressure is only 0.8 bar gives an adequately non-fire-enhancing atmosphere. -george william herbert gherbert@crl.com\n\nNewsgroups: sci.space.policy From: henry@spsystems.net (Henry Spencer) Subject: Re: Space \"Capsule\" Space Suits... a possible alternative?

Hey, I think I have an \"I corrected Henry Spencer\" winner here- 7 atmospheres absolute pressure is the equivalent of 180 feet of sea water, definately in the narcosis danger area. From http://www.mtsinai.org/pulmonary/books/scuba/gaspress.htm: Nitrogen narcosis, also called \"rapture of the deep\" and \"the martini effect,\" results from a direct toxic effect of high nitrogen pressure on nerve conduction. It is an alcohol-like effect, a feeling often compared to drinking a martini on an empty stomach: slightly giddy, woozy, a little off balance. Nitrogen narcosis is a highly variable sensation but always depth-related. Some divers experience no narcotic effect at depths up to 130 fsw, whereas others feel some effect at around 80 fsw. One thing is certain: once begun, the narcotic effect increases with increasing depth. Each additional 50 feet depth is said to feel like having another martini. The Sealab experiments must have included a large fraction of helium to prevent narcosis, so indeed, to get a non flame-supporting atmosphere with nitrogen, you have to go to narcotic pressures. On further thought, the Sealab data point merely shows that a breathable mix at 7 bar must have helium, it doesn't show that a nitrox mixture at lower pressure can't be flameproof and nonnarcotic- although the data hints at it, I don't have a reference.

On looking more closely at the stuff I was reading, although it vaguely implies that nitrogen was used, it doesn't actually *say* what the buffer gas was. A bit of digging indicates that the Sealab buffer gas was likely mostly or entirely helium. (I don't have the right references to be sure.) >On further thought, the Sealab data point merely shows that a breathable >mix at 7 bar must have helium, it doesn't show that a nitrox mixture at >lower pressure can't be flameproof and nonnarcotic... True. Although, the same document I was reading does have some discussion of using higher nitrogen pressure to reduce fire hazard, and it's quite definitely talking in terms of *reducing* it rather than eliminating it, which suggests that elimination isn't in fact practical with nitrogen. -- The space program reminds me | Henry Spencer henry@spsystems.net of a government agency. -Jim Baen | (aka henry@zoo.toronto.edu)\n\nNewsgroups: sci.space.policy From: henry@spsystems.net (Henry Spencer) Subject: Re: Pure Oxygen atmosphere Date: Sat, 19 Feb 2000 18:52:42 GMT In article <950310208.22088.0.nnrp-08.9e98d142@news.demon.co.uk>, Ian Stirling <Inquisitor@I.am> wrote: >>...Sealab II, one of the 1960s living-underwater experiments, ran at >>7atm total pressure with 4% oxygen, a slightly higher oxygen partial >>pressure than sea level.

If memory serves, the chamber work was thought to indicate that diving to circa 5000ft would be practical with hydrogen, although I'm not sure whether they actually went to that pressure or just got results that they thought could be extrapolated to it. -- Microsoft shouldn't be broken up. | Henry Spencer henry@spsystems.net It should be shut down. -- Phil Agre | (aka henry@zoo.toronto.edu)\n\nNewsgroups: sci.space.tech From: henry@spsystems.net (Henry Spencer) Subject: Re: Atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen Date: Sun, 17 Dec 2000 03:26:42 GMT In article <3A3BD707.A1E512EC@indra.com>, Charles R Martin <crmartin@indra.com> wrote: >.. but sitting right where I am now, the actual atmospheric pressure is about >10.5 lbs/in^2 (6Kft altitude). 19 % of that is about 2 lbs/in^2, so that >*ought* to be the partial presssure of oxygen ... but appears that NASA shoots >for more like 5 lbs/in^2. Why? Minor nitpick: oxygen is 21%, not 19%, of air. More substantively... There is a serious nonlinearity here. Air going into the lungs is diluted by CO2 and water vapor coming out, and that dilution is by roughly a constant absolute amount, *not* a constant percentage. So lower pressures get diluted more, and maintaining the same oxygen partial pressure *at the lung wall* requires a higher partial pressure of oxygen in the gas mixture at lower total pressure. >Similarly, why do they seem to want sea-level pressure when about 2/3 of that >seems perfectly adequate? Now *that* is an excellent question, one that others have commented on in the past. -- When failure is not an option, success | Henry Spencer henry@spsystems.net can get expensive. -- Peter Stibrany | (aka henry@zoo.toronto.edu)\n\nIndex Home About Blog"
