        "text": "New Facility to Honor State Senator\n\nThe new life sciences building at the East Carolina University School of Medicine will be named in honor of a Greenville State Senator.\n\nThe ECU board of trustees voted unanimously during its May meeting to name the new building after Sen. Ed Warren, a Democrat from Greenville.\n\n“Mr. Warren has been a wonderful friend to ECU,” said Chancellor Richard Eakin. “He has worked diligently on behalf of the institution.”\n\nWarren has been devoted to improving cardiac health. Research conducted inside the new life sciences building will focus on heart research. hat makes its new name “a wonderful tribute” to the senator, Eakin said.\n\nWarren said he was “humbled” by the honor.\n\n“I think it’s a great honor for the life sciences building to be named for me,” the state senator said. “I’m especially pleased because I understand the building’s primary purpose will be research and heart research. I chair the North Carolina Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention Task Force, and this is one of my primary interests. ECU projects have always been among my top priorities in my political career in the General Assembly.”\n\nThe official name of the $14 million facility will be the Edward Nelson Warren Life Sciences Building. At 60,000 square feet, the building will house the radiation biology and comparative medicine departments.\n\nAccording to university officials, the building should be completed and ready for occupation later this month.\n\nWhenever beginnings are sought and the early days of the Training School recorded the name of James Lawson Fleming, will appear.\n\nDescended from sturdy, honest, industrious and noble ancestry, he inherited their sterling qualities, while his early life spent on a farm served to develop his body and to give him that independence of spirit that comes from contact with the freedom of country life. As a boy he attended the country schools and knew the advantages and disadvantages to which the rural school is subject. Later he became a pupil of W. H. Ragsdale, then teaching in the Greenville Academy, by whom he was prepared for Wake Forest College. After graduation from college he taught for a year, then read law with Latham and Skinner, of Greenville. Later he attended the Law School of the University of North Carolina. He was admitted to the bar in 1892, and located in Greenville, where he soon built up a lucrative practice and at the time of his death he possessed a large practice in the Superior, Supreme, and Federal Courts. Soon after locating in Greenville he was elected mayor of the town, and served his term of office to the satisfaction of his fellow citizens. In 1904 he was elected by a large majority to represent the county of Pitt in the Senate, and again in 1906. As Senator from Pitt in 1905 and 1907 his services were marked by vigor and distinction.\n\nAmong the important measures which engaged his attention, education in Eastern Carolina was not least. Upon his election in 1906 he agreed to introduce a bill to establish such a school in the eastern part of the State as had become the dream and the hope of the educational leaders of the eastern section of the State. When the General Assembly met, Senator Fleming introduced the bill but its career was not an easy one.\n\nA similar bill from Elizabeth City had been killed by the previous General Assembly. There was stubborn opposition on the part of those who did not realize the needs of the eastern section, and who did not favor the State’s increasing the number of schools already established. Under Senator Fleming’s wise guidance, however, and by his tireless efforts, in season and out of season, the bill was so successfully presented that those who had fought it became its friends, and those disinterested became interested. The bill passed, and the East Carolina Teachers’ Training School became a reality. It remained to secure the school for Greenville and here again Senator Fleming used his tireless energy to secure the location in Greenville.\n\nTwo years later, just one month after the buildings were completed and the school was opened, on November 5, 1909, he was killed in an automobile accident, and it was left for others to see and realize what the establishment of the East Carolina Teacher Training School, for which he had labored so earnestly and so successfully, was to mean to its section of the State. He was truly one of its founders and his work as a founder had been so well done that it was easier for others to continue to work for the maintenance and support of the school.\n\nLike many theaters, it seems ECU’s McGinnis Auditorium is haunted.\n\nSome people, mostly students, say the ghost of Dr. Lucille Charles, a professor from 1946 to 1953, lives in the building.\n\nDr. Charles makes noise and flies by, as reported by a group of students who say they saw a figure in white float across the stage. They followed it down the hall into an empty room which was unnaturally cold.\n\nAnother night during rehearsals, students heard a door slamming repeatedly. Before they could reach it, the lights went out. As they came back on, the slamming stopped.\n\nOthers have felt cold spots, seen lights go on and off, briefly smelled perfume and heard loud,lengthy noises. Things have disappeared and suddenly reappeared.\n\nSome believe they have captured her voice, singing, on tape. A recording was made of a woman playing the piano and a man was singing. When they re-played the tape, a woman was heard singing along. They tried it again, the results were the same.\n\nAnother version said that only a woman was heard. Still another claims there was no singing, only the piano.\n\nIn another incident a student heard a piano playing. When he approached the room, the playing stopped and the room was empty. As he turned to leave he closed the door and the music resumed. Opening the door, he found the room empty and quiet.\n\nOne of the stranger incidents involved a man who brought two dogs in his arms, to the auditorium. When he entered a certain room, the dogs began to bark and whimper. They jumped out of his arms, ran wildly for a few seconds, and then dashed out of the room. When he tried to take them back, they would not go. The owner persisted, but they would not enter the room.\n\nW.H. Ragsdale was born in 1855 and received his training at a time when the general impression prevailed that anybody who could read and write and cipher could teach school. But in that day there were some men and women teaching school whose chief qualifications were not their attainments in scholarship but a warm heart, a big soul, and a strong personality. Ragsdale, the boy, came under the spell of some one of this type who inspired him to prepare himself as well as possible for life’s work, and he was graduated from Wake Forest College with distinction.\n\nHe began his work as teacher in a private boy’s school in Scotland Neck. He soon came from that school to Greenville and engaged in the school work in a private school familiarly known a dozen years ago as the Male Academy.\n\nThe history of his work here is indelibly written on the hearts and interpreted in the lives of the men who were the boys of those days and his scholars. His success as a teacher is best told in the loving terms in which “his boys” invariably delight to speak of their teacher and friend.\n\nWhile he was still engaged in the private school work he was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction of Pitt County. At that time a County Superintendent was not expected to do much work, and the salary was much smaller than the work.\n\nMr. Ragsdale kept up the duties of his school and of his new office to which he had been elected until the Greenville Graded Schools were established in 1903. From that time on he devoted his entire time and energies to the county schools. A correct estimate of his work in this County cannot be made, but a comparison of conditions expressed in figures will give some insight into his work.\n\nIn 1899 the white school census was 5,157 and the number enrolled in the schools was 2,975. The average school term was 73 days. The value of the school property for the white race was $7,540. As late as 1903 the best public school building in the County, including the towns, was the one-room frame building which was the home of the Greenville Male Academy, to which reference has been made.\n\nIn 1912 the white school census was 6,965 and the enrollment was 5,665. The average school term was 101 days for the schools generally and 160 days for the local tax districts. The value of the school property for the white race was $85,000.\n\nThese figures tell the story of tireless labor, undaunted energy, prophetic vision, hope, love and diplomacy. His optimism and faith in humanity inspired men and women, both teachers and citizens, to do their best and to be their best. His persistent and cheerful efforts in behalf of the children of all the people met with a glad response. To him a little child was greater than anything of a material nature, greater than his own salary and his own comfort, and to-day the children of this County rise up and bless his memory.\n\nThe loss sustained in the death of Mr. Ragsdale is keenly felt in his town, in his County, and in the educational circles of the State, but it is not felt more keenly anywhere than in the faculty of the Training School. Just what he meant to us in our work cannot be told in words. He was with this school in its beginning — even long before it had a beginning he was sowing the seed which ripened into an irresistible demand for it\n\nOn February 1, C. W. Wilson, Secretary of the Board of Trustees, died suddenly. Wilson was one of the original Board of Trustees, and from the organization of the Board of Trustees until his death was Secretary to the Board. He was Director of the Summer School and in my absence was the person to whom I turned over the administrative duties of the College. His death is the most serious blow the College has ever had when viewed from the internal workings of the institution. He understood thoroughly our state’s educational needs, and worked indefatigably to meet those needs. He literally gave his life for the children of North Carolina. In his going our state has lost one of its best citizens and one of its most unselfish public servants. This College has lost one of its strongest workers, one of its best teachers, and one of its most loyal and enthusiastic spirits. His place cannot be filled. In fact we do not want to fill it, but his going necessitates a reorganization and readjustment. We are in the midst of making these changes. The spirit of our teachers and officers as it manifests itself at this trying time to the administration of the College is most loyal and most commendatory and as your executive officer I want to lay these facts before you. Respectfully submitted, Robert H. Wright, President\n\nIn the west dormitory the rooms at the east end of the front hall have been remodeled and built into very attractive parlors. The parlors are shut off from the other part of the dormitory by doors. “Moving day” was celebrated on November 12 and 13. The contractors promised President Wright to have the new wing ready by September 28th. President Wright had faith in this promise and word was sent to the girls to come. But the new wing was not finished. It was then promised to be completed in two weeks. The girls were allowed to stay here if they were willing to put up with camping three or four in a room. The rooms were crowded with beds, hardly room enough to move around; when the girls went to visit each other, they had to sit on the beds while being entertained because the rooms were too crowded to contain chairs. At the end of two weeks the building seemed no nearer completion so we were still kept in suspense. At the end of the seventh week the command was given to “move.” The day before, November 12, the teachers moved from their quarters on the upper floor on the old front to the first floor of the new wing. They occupy the entire first floor of the new wing and have the same entrance as before. On November 13 the girls moved to the upstairs of the new wing and also occupy the rooms upstairs formerly occupied by the teachers. On that same day and on November 15 was camp cleaning day for those who did not have to move. The girls made the best of the situation and had a jolly time. There never has been a year at the the Training School when the girls had a better chance to know each other than the opportunity afforded this year. The building was demolished in 1968 to make part of the site for the Jenkins Fine Arts Center.\n\nOn February 1, C. W. Wilson, Secretary of the Board of Trustees, died suddenly.

Hut Now Ready The Y.W.C.A. hut is now completed, cleaned up, shavings swept out, windows washed, curtains up, wiring in, lights on — everything ready for a house warming before the term closes. “All things come to him who waits.” A dream which has been in the minds of the students for several years has almost come to pass, and before this reaches the public the girls will be enjoying it.\n\nThe hut is a low, red building located almost directly back of the basketball court in the woods on the back campus, with the West end facing Eighth Street. It has six broad double windows, from which beautiful views may be seen, and a large fireplace. On the south end is a kitchenette, which has a real wood stove — not a smoky oil outfit — ready for use, which will be a joy and delight to those who fix the eats.\n\nEarly in the fall the girls realized they had money enough to begin to make their plans. Through the kindness of two staunch friends in the faculty, a loan was secured. The members of the faculty have proved their interest in many ways. The men wired the hut for lighting and the women contributed the draperies. To complete the furnishing will be a task of love in which every girl in the college shall have a share. Any former students who have had hopes and dreams for the hut may also share in the furnishing. Contributions will be gratefully received.\n\nMay the hut be a means of bringing the girls into closer touch with each other."
