This is certainly one of the most unusual pictures to date, since only this one room is considered a national landmark. George Herbert Jones Laboratory was built in 1929 for the university's chemistry school. This room became famous during World War II due to the Manhattan Project. University chemists were instructed to study radioactivity under Arthur Compton, specifically the recently manufactured element plutonium. In September 1942, the first plutonium was isolated and measured, allowing the scientists to determine its atomic weight.",
