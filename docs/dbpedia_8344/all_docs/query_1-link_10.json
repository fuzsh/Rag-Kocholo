Because landmarks connect us to the past. Through visiting these wonderful places where history occurred we find our roots.

It doesn’t get any better than that!\n\nSo, without further ado, let’s dive in.\n\nIllinois Landmarks\n\nSome Fascinating Facts About Illinois\n\nHere are some interesting facts about Illinois:\n\nIllinois is the fifth most populous state in the United States, with a population of over 12 million people.\n\nThe state’s name comes from the Native American word “iliniwok,” which means “tribe of superior men.”\n\nChicago, located in northeastern Illinois, is the third-largest city in the United States and is known for its skyscrapers, museums, and diverse culture.\n\nIllinois is home to many notable figures, including: former President Barack Obama, writer Ernest Hemingway, and comedian Richard Pryor.\n\nThe Chicago River is the only river in the world that flows backward. In 1900, the river was reversed to prevent sewage from flowing into Lake Michigan, the city’s source of drinking water.\n\nThe state is known as the “Prairie State” because it was once covered in grasslands that stretched for hundreds of miles.\n\nThe world’s first skyscraper, the Home Insurance Building, was built in Chicago in 1885.\n\nThe state is also known for its deep-dish pizza, Chicago-style hot dogs, and Italian beef sandwiches.\n\nThe Illinois state flag features an eagle holding a banner that says “State Sovereignty, National Union” and a shield with a sun rising over Lake Michigan.\n\nThe state is home to several prestigious universities, including: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Northwestern University, and the University of Chicago.\n\nTop 20 Illinois Landmarks\n\n20. Old State Capitol\n\nWe kick-off our list of the Best Landmarks in Illinois with a place which was the site of the presidential candidacy announcements by Abraham Lincoln in 1858 and Barack Obama in 2007.

The building was constructed in 1839 to serve as the seat of government for the state of Illinois, and it remained in use as the state capitol until 1876.\n\nIt Was The Site Of Many Important Events\n\nDuring its years as the state capitol, the Old State Capitol was the site of many important events in Illinois history. It was here that Abraham Lincoln gave his famous “House Divided” speech in 1858, which helped to launch his campaign for the U.S. Senate. It was also here that Lincoln lay in state after his assassination in 1865, and where his body was viewed by thousands of mourners.\n\nIn addition to its historical significance, the Old State Capitol is also an important example of Greek Revival architecture. The building was designed by architect John F. Rague, and features a grand central dome and columns modeled after the Parthenon in Athens.\n\nAfter the state government moved to a new capitol building in 1876, the Old State Capitol was used for various purposes, including as a courthouse and as the headquarters of the Illinois Historical Society. In the 1960s, the building was restored to its original appearance and opened to the public as a museum.\n\nToday, the Old State Capitol is a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Illinois’ rich political and architectural heritage.

Over the next few years, the settlement grew rapidly, with thousands of church members flocking to Nauvoo from all over the world.\n\nDuring this time, many important buildings were constructed in Nauvoo, including the Nauvoo Temple, the Nauvoo House Hotel, and the Red Brick Store, which served as the church’s headquarters. These buildings were designed to be grand and impressive, reflecting the church’s vision of itself as a powerful and influential organization.\n\nTensions Began To Rise\n\nHowever, tensions between the church and local residents began to rise in the late 1840s, and in 1846, church leaders announced that they would be leaving Nauvoo and heading west to the Salt Lake Valley. The exodus was a difficult and challenging journey, but it ultimately led to the establishment of the church’s new home in Utah.\n\nAfter the church’s departure, many of the buildings in Nauvoo fell into disrepair or were destroyed. However, in the early 20th century, efforts began to restore the historic district and preserve its buildings for future generations.\n\nToday, the Nauvoo Historic District is a popular tourist destination, with thousands of visitors each year coming to see the historic buildings and learn about the city’s unique and fascinating history.\n\nThe district is a testament to the enduring legacy of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the important role that Nauvoo played in the church’s early history.\n\n9.

Pullman National Monument\n\nWe’re on to the final two on our list of the Best Illinois Landmarks. In the runner-up position is an incredible site with a truly amazing story to tell. It’s the Pullman National Monument.\n\nTo understand the historic significance of this place, however, a short history lesson is in order. But have no fear because we never assign any homework.\n\nThe Pullman Strike of 1894 would forever change labor relations in the United States. It began on May 11, 1894, when several thousand train workers started an unannounced strike at the Pullman Company in Illinois.\n\nOver the next few months, dozens of workers would die in strike-related violence, and the President and Supreme Court would finally become involved in the strike’s outcome.\n\nWhy Did The Strike Happen?\n\nWhy did this strike happen? In 1893, the country was gripped by a severe recession. George Pullman had built a company famous for making railroad cars. He also created a town for his workers in Illinois.\n\nThere they enjoyed many amenities but were also financially dependent on the Pullman Company for their homes and utilities.\n\nPullman made a decision to cut workers wages by 25%. He did not, however, reduce their living costs which meant that workers could no longer afford to provide for their families. This was the event which triggered a monumental clash between labor and management.\n\nThe Federal Government Intervenes In The Pullman Strike\n\nU.S. Attorney General Richard Olney sought an injunction in federal court barring union leaders from supporting the strike. He demanded the strikers cease their activities or face being fired. The Union, led by organizer Eugene V. Debs, ignored the injunction.\n\nPresident Grover Cleveland ordered the United States Army to get the trains moving again. The arrival of the military and the subsequent deaths of workers in violence led to further outbreaks of violence. During the course of this strike, 30 strikers were killed and 57 were wounded.\n\nIn an olive branch to organized labor, President Cleveland and Congress dedicated Labor Day as a federal holiday.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about this epic event in American history then I recommend a book that is a real page turner. It’s The Edge of Anarchy: The Railroad Barons, the Gilded Age, and the Greatest Labor Uprising in America by Jack Kelly who offers a vivid account of the greatest uprising of working people in American history.\n\nThe Labor Organizer Who Wanted To Be President\n\nEugene Debs was arrested during the Pullman Strike. He was defended by famed criminal defense attorney Clarence Darrow.\n\nDebs, who was a socialist, political activist, and trade unionist, was one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World. He used his notoriety from the Pullman Strike to run for President of the United States as the candidate of the Socialist Party of America–five times.\n\nThings To Do\n\nHere are some things to do when visiting the Pullman National Monument:\n\nTake a tour of the historic Pullman district: The Pullman district is a historic residential area that was built in the late 19th century to house workers at the Pullman Company. You can take a guided tour of the district to see the beautiful architecture and learn about its history.\n\nVisit the Visitor Center: The Pullman National Monument has a Visitor Center where you can learn about the history of the Pullman Company and the significance of the site.

You can take a guided tour to learn about its history and architecture.\n\nAttend a ranger-led program: The Pullman National Monument offers ranger-led programs that include guided tours, talks, and workshops.

The monument is also part of the larger Chicago Lakefront Trail system.\n\n1. Lincoln Home National Historic Site\n\nWe’ve saved the best for last! Illinois is known as the “Land of Lincoln” so was there ever any doubt as to which site More Than Just Parks would select for the #1 spot? It’s the Lincoln Home National Historic Site.\n\nIn 2021, C-SPAN asked a group of distinguished presidential historians to rank our nation’s presidents from worst to best.\n\nAt the top of their list, with a total score of 897 points, was Abraham Lincoln. George Washington and Franklin Roosevelt came in second and third respectively.\n\nWhy is Abraham Lincoln considered the greatest president of all time? Simply put, he saved the Union.\n\nn the process of saving the nation, Lincoln managed to define the creation of a more perfect Union in terms of liberty and economic equality that rallied the citizenry behind him.\n\nLincoln Transformed The Presidency\n\nLincoln transformed the Presidency. He remade the president’s role as commander in chief and as chief executive into a powerful new position. In the process, he imbued the office with broader powers by making it supreme over both Congress and the courts.\n\nHis detractors argued then and now that he took actions which were unconstitutional such as suspending the writ of habeas corpus.\n\nFor Lincoln, however, it made no sense “to lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution.” No President in American history ever faced a greater crisis and, in saving the Union, no President ever accomplished as much.\n\nIf you’re interested in taking a deeper dive and learning more about America’s greatest president then you cannot do better than Carl Sandburg’s Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years and The War Years. Sandburg won the coveted Pulitzer Prize for his monumental work on America’s 16th President.\n\nVisit The Home Of America’s Greatest Leader\n\nVisitors can take a guided tour of the Lincoln Home. You can step back in time and see how Abraham Lincoln as a family man and a lawyer.\n\nHe lived in this house with his wife and family for 17 years before moving to Washington. And the best news of all is that admission is free.\n\nBefore heading to the Lincoln Home, however, I recommend going to the Visitor Center. There you can watch two films. One highlights Abraham Lincoln’s life in Springfield and the other is a virtual tour of the Lincoln Home.\n\nVisitors can also explore a four block historic neighborhood and see various exhibits and displays while learning about the history of the Lincoln’s neighborhood.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about Abraham Lincoln (and who isn’t) then check out these other popular Lincoln sites in Springfield: the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Lincoln’s Tomb, the Old State Capitol and the Great Western Depot/Lincoln Depot.\n\nMap Of Illinois Landmarks\n\nList Of Illinois Landmarks\n\nLincoln Home National Historic Site\n\nPullman National Monument\n\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\n\nUlysses S.
