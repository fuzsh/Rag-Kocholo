Shaw's presidency (1968–1976).\n\nAlso, the Oren T. Nelson Boiler Plant donated by trustee and long time friend of Westminster, Oren Nelson, to replace the old heating plant. It was dedicated April 15, 1988. At the northeast corner of the Black Bridge, it included a small recess built into the west wall at the request of Campus Scheduling Director Claudia Marques for campus cats to to shelter in during bad weather conditions. Over the years, this campus cat rescuer has treated and found homes for more than 30 cats.\n\nThe flagship and first building on campus, Converse was originally built as a multipurpose administration and classroom building with funding from John H. Converse, a wealthy Presbyterian businessman in Philadelphia and then-president of Baldwin Locomotive Works. The cornerstone was laid August 23, 1906 under the presidency of Rev. Robert M. Stevenson (1905–1912) and it was completed July 1907, though not actually occupied for another two years due to a lack of funding for a heating system, furniture, or boarding facilities for students.\n\nConverse was renovated under President Charles H. Dick (1985–1995) and then re-dedicated on Sept. 19, 1989 as part of the Jewett Center for the Arts and Humanities.

Historically known for class competitions and tug-of-war across the water, the creek now provides a peaceful getaway for faculty, staff, and students to read, study, and enjoy nature. Trails and native plants have been added by biology professors and their classes in recent years in an effort to preserve Emigration Creek's natural habitat and provide a unique classroom-outside-the-classroom experience for science students.\n\nFoster Hall begun in 1917 under President Herbert W. Reherd (1913–1939) as a partial basement and temporary frame structure for a men's residence, known as the \"Cracker Box.\" Three stories were finished in 1926 with contributions from the Thomas D. Foster family of Ottumwa, Iowa, dedicated in June 25, 1926 to the memory of Robert Hubie Foster (1890–1905), a university classmate of President Reherd's. It originally housed 100 students and had a reading room, parlor, and resident director's apartment while the fourth floor was left unfinished for expansion.\n\nFoster was an auxiliary men's residence until the mid-1970's, then home to the School of Education, and in 1989 became office and meeting space for the Westminster College of Arts and Sciences. It was renovated during President Charles H. Dick's term (1985–1995) as part of the Jewett Center for the Arts and Humanities with funding from Berenice Jewett Bradshaw and re-dedicated on August 30, 1994.\n\nADA Compliance\n\nAccessible entrances: west\n\nAccessible restrooms: all levels\n\nAutomatic doors: one, west\n\nElevator(s)/Lift(s): one\n\nReserved parking: west, East Jewett Center Parking Lot and east, Carleson/Foster Parking Lot\n\nDepartments\n\nClassrooms\n\nWestminster College of Arts and Sciences Dean/Faculty offices\n\nBuilt in 1959 with loans from the Housing and Home Finance Administration under the presidency of Frank E. Duddy (1956–1963), this residence hall was named for the James A. Hogle family in recognition of their many years of support and service to the university. The hall was designed to house 120 women with a director's apartment, and allowing then-Ferry Hall to be used for other purposes. Hogle adjoins Walker Hall and includes Marimon Lounge for activities, named after Rosa Bird Marimon, a teacher from the early 1900's.\n\nHogle Hall is one of two first-year residence halls on campus (the other is Carleson Hall). Students live in traditional-style rooms with one roommate and shared bathroom facilities. The halls also have laundry rooms, 24-hour security, Internet access in each room, and recreation rooms.\n\nADA Compliance\n\nAccessible entrances: west\n\nAccessible restrooms: one, first floor\n\nReserved parking: east, Hogle Parking Lot\n\nThe Jewett Center for the Performing Arts was initially funded by Berenice Jewett Bradshaw and dedicated April 13, 1991 under the presidency of Dr. Charles Dick (1985–1995). In 1983 she had been prompted by her own family tragedy to establish a scholarship in memory of student Louis Merz, who died in a crash while flying a rescue helicopter to pick up a child for surgery. Her subsequent generosity, ultimately totaling nearly $4 million in building, scholarship, and Westminster Fund gifts, was credited with saving Westminster at a time of financial exigency. In recognition of her philanthropy, Berenice received an honorary doctorate in 1985 and was named the first recipient of Westminster's Distinguished Service Award. Subsequently, she was appointed as a Distinguished Professor of Arts.\n\nThe Jay W. Lees Courage Theater replaced the small theater on the third floor of Converse Hall which was dedicated in 1983 to beloved theater Professor Jay Lees. The Emma Eccles Jones Conservatory (north addition) opened Fall of 2004 under the presidency of Dr. Michael Bassis (2002–2012).\n\nThe Emma Eccles Jones Conservatory tripled the volume of performance space available on the Westminster Campus. The heart of the facility is the 285-seat Vieve Gore Concert Hall, which serves as an intimate environment for musical performances. Additionally, the Dumke Student Theatre is a 150-seat, black-box theatre with stage and seating that can be arranged in any configuration. The Conservatory also contains a rehearsal and recording studio, a technology lab, and multiple practice rooms.\n\nTogether, the Jewett Center for the Performing Arts and Emma Eccles Jones Conservatory house all campus music and theater classes.

Penney Company. Groundbreaking was July 1928 and dedication January 11, 1929.\n\nThough the university worried that it was frivolous to spend money on a gymnasium, the facility, designed by architect Walter E. Ware, provided needed recreation for the school and groups in the entire Sugar House area. It was added on to and remodeled in 1970 under President Manford Shaw (1968–1976), and has housed the basketball and volleyball programs, dances, speakers, luncheons, career fairs, orientations, and a variety of other cultural and social student events–including being the practice facility for the Utah Jazz from 1979 to May 1999.\n\nADA Compliance\n\nElevator(s)/Lift(s): one, southeast\n\nReserved parking: east, East Jewett Center Parking Lot and west, first floor Main Parking Structure\n\nOpened in early 1969, the Manford A.
