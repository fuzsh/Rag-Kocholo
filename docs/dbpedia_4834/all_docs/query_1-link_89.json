        "text": "Eclipse Awards\n\nSaratoga Notebook, Presented by NYRA Bets: Pletcher Did His Best to Get Fierceness Home in Travers\n\nSARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y.-When it became perfectly clear that the finish of Saturday's $1.25-million, GI DraftKings Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course was going to be desperately close, trainer Todd Pletcher went to work. Sitting up in his clubhouse box, the normally composed Pletcher rose to his feet and screamed and yelled for his 3-year-old colt Fierceness (City of Light) to get the job done in the Midsummer Derby. \"I knew it was getting close,\" the Hall of Fame trainer said outside his office at his barn at the Oklahoma Training...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nFit And Rested, Champion Fierceness Is Ready For More Racing\n\nSARATOGA SPRINGS, NY -- Missing from action for two months, but certainly not forgotten, beaten GI Kentucky Derby favorite and 'TDN Rising Star' Fierceness (City of Light) is ready to make his comeback. Hall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher said the Repole Stable homebred is set to resume competition in the GI Haskell Stakes at Monmouth Park on July 20 with stablemates Mindframe (Constitution) and Tuscan Sky (Vino Rosso). Mindframe is making his first start since finishing second in the GI Belmont Stakes on June 8. Tuscan Sky won the...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nEclipse Awards Returning To Palm Beach In January 2025\n\nThe 54th Annual Eclipse Awards, honoring Thoroughbred racing's human and equine champions of 2024, will return to the Breakers Palm Beach in Florida on Jan. 23, 2025 according to an announcement Thursday by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the Daily Racing Form and the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters. The Awards will be held two days before Gulfstream Park hosts the GI Pegasus World Cup. \"We are thrilled to be returning to the Breakers Palm Beach for our third year in a row,\" said NTRA President and CEO Tom Rooney....\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nBeholder Mile To Be Renamed To Honor Hughes\n\nThe GI Beholder Mile is being renamed the B. Wayne Hughes Beholder Mile in honor of the multiple champion's late owner, who passed away in August 2021. Hughes, the founder of the Public Storage company and whose silks carried the same purple-and-orange color scheme, owned horses for five decades and was the proprietor of Spendthrift Farm from 2004. Beholder, a daughter of Henny Hughes, was purchased for $180,000 at the 2011 Keeneland September sale and won a record 13 stakes races at Santa Anita, including the 2012 GI Breeders' Cup...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nAnd So It Begins: Fierceness Makes Seasonal Debut In Holy Bull\n\nRepole Stable's newly crowned Eclipse Award winner and 'TDN Rising Star' Fierceness (City of Light) is set to make a much-anticipated sophomore debut in Saturday's GIII Holy Bull S., and--realistically--the homebred may not require his very best to make a victorious return to action. Brilliant as he was in breaking his maiden by better than 11 lengths at first asking in Uncle Mo-esque fashion over the summer at Saratoga, he was equally disappointing when beaten a long ways from home in the GI Champagne S. Those who quickly jumped ship...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nThe Week in Review: National Treasure Could Be On His Way to Stardom\n\nI wasn't a National Treasure (Quality Road) fan. He got one of the easiest trips you'll ever see in a Triple Crown race when he was allowed to walk on the lead in the GI Preakness S., winning by a head over soft group of challengers. Which is why it came as no surprise that he couldn't so much as finish in the money in any of his next three starts, the GI Belmont S., the GI Travers S. and the GI Awesome Again S. He looked like a horse...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nTears and Appreciation for Team Cody Carry the Evening at Eclipse Awards\n\nCody's Wish (Curlin) was crowned both 2023 Horse of the Year and Older Dirt Male champion at Thursday night's 53rd annual Eclipse Awards ceremony, and when Kelly Dorman, the father of the late Cody Dorman, accepted the evening's highest honor on behalf of owner/breeder Godolphin, the crowd at The Breakers Palm Beach in Florida met his brief pause to shed a few bittersweet tears with a standing ovation that gave him time to collect his thoughts and let the gravity of the moment sink in. On the track, Cody's Wish...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nHigh Five For Godolphin At The Eclipse Awards\n\nIt was an evening to remember for Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum's Godolphin team, as the worldwide operation accumulated no fewer than five statuettes over the course of the evening at Thursday's 53rd Annual Eclipse Awards Presented by FanDuel TV, John Deere, Keeneland and The Jockey Club, honoring and recognizing excellence in Thoroughbred racing. And they saved the best for last, as Cody's Wish (Curlin), whose story resonated with nearly every fan of Thoroughbred racing and beyond, was named Horse of the Year and champion older dirt male for...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nCody's Wish Crowned Horse of the Year\n\nCody's Wish (Curlin), whose attachment to 17-year-old Cody Dorman attracted followers from well outside the horse racing world, was crowned Horse of the Year Thursday night at the 53rd annual Eclipse Awards Ceremony at The Breakers Palm Beach in Florida. Cody's Wish scored an emotional second win in the GI Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile with a gritty display at Santa Anita in November and the victory was made even more poignant when Dorman, who suffered from a rare genetic disorder and after whom the colt was named, died the following...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nIdiomatic, Cody's Wish Named Eclipse Champions\n\nJuddmonte homebred Idiomatic (Curlin) was named Eclipse champion older dirt female during ceremonies Thursday in Florida following a tour de force 2023 campaign which saw her win three Grade I events. The 4-year-old filly, from the same family which gave Juddmonte its 2014 champion mare Close Hatches, was second in the GII Ruffian S. in May before sweeping to victories in the GIII Shawnee S., GII Delaware H., GI Personal Ensign S., GI Spinster S., and GI Breeders' Cup Distaff. Godolphin homebred Cody's Wish (Curlin) was named Eclipse champion older...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nArcangelo, Pretty Mischievous Earn 3-Year-Old Honors at Eclipse Ceremony\n\nBlue Rose Farm's Arcangelo (Arrogate) and Godolphin's Pretty Mischievous (Into Mischief) earned Eclipse Awards as leaders of the 2023 sophomore division during Thursday's ceremony in Florida. In a division that failed to produce any runaway leader throughout the year, Arcangelo distinguished himself with wins in the GI Belmont S. and GI Travers S. and took home the Eclipse statue for leading 3-year-old male. The gray's 2023 campaign also included a win in the GIII Peter Pan S. Godolphin homebred Pretty Mischievous was first or second in all six of her...\n\n[ Read More ]\n\nGodolphin Sweeps Leading Owner/Breeder Titles\n\nFor the fourth straight year, Sheikh Mohammed bin Maktoum's Godolphin has been named Eclipse champion owner and the operation was named champion breeder for the third straight year. During 2023, Godolphin was represented by Eclipse finalists Cody's Wish (Curlin), Pretty Mischievous (Into Mischief), Mawj (Ire) (Exceed and Excel {Aus}) and Master of the Seas (Ire) (Dubawi {Ire}). In addition to its Eclipse titles as leading owner from 2020 through 2023, Godolphin was also named champion owner of 2009 and 2012.\n\n[ Read More ]"
