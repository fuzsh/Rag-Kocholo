She won three stakes races in a 70-day stretch, plus the Tax Free Shopping Distaff allowance at Delaware Park (previously run under stakes conditions), an concluded her 4-year-old season with a second in graded company en route to being named Maryland-bred Horse of the Year, champion older female and champion sprinter.\n\nAfter starting her season with three second- or third-place efforts, including a third the July 15 Caesar’s Wish Stakes at Laurel, Intrepid Daydream began to turn it on. She swept her way through the Shine Again, Tax Free Shopping, Maryland Million Distaff and Politely Stakes, winning by an average margin of more than three lengths. Not long after her Politely score in late November, she was purchased privately by Miller Racing LLC, who sent her to Florida and the barn of trainer Saffie Joseph Jr. The daughter of Jess’s Dream wrapped up her year with a second, missing by a half length, in Gulfstream Park’s Sugar Swirl Stakes-G3 on Dec. 23.
