You cannot expect intelligent young men, whether rural or urban, to enroll in a training program when you haven’t anything to offer them after graduation. In the past, the owners and trainers could have refused to race their horses until proper living facilities were provided on the “back stretch,” and also for higher purses to pay these young horsemen a decent wage: not to mention hospitalization, a minimum number of hours, vacation, and possibly some short courses on caring for the horse. What about the future! Mr. Carter hit a home run when he stated that, \"The state governments must be satisfied with less money.” When this is accomplished the owners and trainers can and had better see to it that proper facilities are provided and purses increased, so racing can compete with other industries for the youth of our nation. The most heart-breaking truth is, the intelli¬ gent youth of today who love horses, especially racing, cannot consider working with horses due to some very simple economic facts. Sincerely, George K. Worst Parkersburg, Pa. 32 Dear Sirs: I thoroughly enjoyed your article on Hum¬ phrey Finney in the current issue of your fine magazine. The cover was tremendous. I really regret not being able to be in attend¬ ance at Saratoga for the dedication of the new sales pavilion, as I have long been an admirer of Mr. Finney and feel fortunate to have known such a man. To speak with him is an education. For one who was born and raised in racing, and loves it as I do, it makes me even more proud that people like \"Humphrey Stanley Finney” are a product and part of this wonder¬ ful world of horse racing. Sincerely yours, Chick Lang Director of Racing Pimlico Race Course Baltimore, Md. Eastern Fall Sale Set For Sept. 26-27 The Eastern Fall Sale will be held at Timonium in the Sales Pavilion on Thursday and Friday, September 26 and 27. Approximately 250 yearlings will be sold in two evening sessions. Sales officials twice shifted dates of the auction because of confliction with reli¬ gious holidays. Originally scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, September 30 and October 1, the sale was moved back one day when it was discovered that Yom Kippur began at sundown on October 1. But after rescheduling the sale for Sunday and Monday, September 29 and 30, sales officials encountered opposition from Timonium’s management regarding use of the pavilion on a Sunday. Timonium’s eight-man Executive Com¬ mittee voted unanimously to withhold its sanction of a Sunday auction, its deci¬ sion being based on \"moral reasons”, according to Dr. J. Morris Reese, chair¬ man of Timonium’s board of directors. Although Dr. Reese said the Executive Committee had no objection to the use of the pavilion on Yom Kippur, sales officials decided to avoid both dates by shifting the auction to September 26 and 27.

THE NEAREST THlNGTO A ClNCH AT AN'lf TRflCW is a sharply conditioned horse of substantial class, / w WHEN ENTERED AT A SUITABLE DISTANCE AGAINST INFERIOR ANIMALS • When the hunting horn blows Tom Glass becomes boss over his wife and her ©hildern Text by Snowden Carter Photographs by Peter Winants The man who sets out to look at the three Eastern Fall Sales yearlings consigned to the September 26-27 auction by Thomas S. Glass may find at the end of his tour that his original mission has become quite incidental, thanks to the amazing charm of a remarkable family. Tom Glass lives with his wife and five of her seven children on 360-acre Pleasant Valley Farm which is nestled in the Middletown Valley between Frederick and Hagerstown. The 49-year-old attorney is new to the Thor¬ oughbred business. He’s not new to horses (\"I come from Texas and started riding as a child”), but his acquisition of Thoroughbred broodmares didn’t begin until 1965. In three years his Thoroughbred holdings have grown to include six broodmares, three sucklings, five yearlings and one 2-year-old. 34 Despite the most stringent selectivity ever applied to the Eastern Fall Sale, Mr. Glass had three of his five yearlings accepted by the com¬ mittee which evaluates pedigree and conforma¬ tion for all Eastern Fall nominees. The three yearlings, all colts, are by Big Pete, *Beechpark and John William. They are beautifully grown, well-developed animals. Their radiant health comes quite naturally, according to Mr. Glass. He explains that the Middletown Valley ’yields more per acre than any land east of the Mississippi.” Walking out through one of the farm’s many meadows, Glass points to the vigorous, green turf under foot. ’’Where else in Maryland can you find grass like this in late August?” he asked. ’’Raising horses in the Middletown Valley does make a difference. I’m sure of it.” The Maryland Horse Mrs. Glass, herself a horsewoman, heartily concurs. The farm, she explains, is so fertile that her previous husband, the late Richard Boutelle, bottled water from the stream and gave it to young brides to enhance their reproductivity. \"It was, of course, a joke,” says Ellen Glass, \"but this farm does have a reputation for fer¬ tility. Back in the old days they say this place was used as a commercial breeding farm for slaves.” Between them, Mr. and Mrs. Glass have ten children. Mr. Glass’s three daughters (Judy, 19; Mary Alice, 17, and Anne, 15) live with their mother in Rockville. Mrs. Glass, who deserves to be in the record books as one of Maryland’s most attractive grandmothers, has two grown sons (age 28 and 23) in addition to the five young Boutelles who live at Pleasant Valley Farm. Her older sons, Edward and William Bishop, are from her first mariage. Edward, married and the father of a 2-year- old boy, is employed by the Corn Products Cor¬ poration. William, who was married just last month, is a student at the University of Mary¬ land. From Mrs. Glass’s second marriage come the Boutelle children—three girls (age 16, 13 and 11) and twin boys, age 8. The girls—Dickey, Marjorie and Katherine—are avid riders. The boys—Dick and John—find go-carts, a tree- house, swimming pools, cats and fishing of more interest than horses. Tom Glass, who was first-string quarterback for Tulane during his college years, surveys this tribe with warmth and smiling tolerance. September, 1968 35 Tom and Ellen Glass pose their broodmares and foals (below) in meadow at Pleasant Valley. Mr. Glass is a lawyer-politician and was Tulane football star in college. Mrs. Glass has seven children and a grand¬ child. Both husband and wife hunt regularly. \"The only time I can get this family to listen to me,” he says, \"is when were out foxhunting. I’m field master of the New Market Hounds. So what I say in the hunting field carries weight.” \"That,” Mrs. Glass replied, \"is why I always ride far back behind the field. \"It’s the only time Tom smokes cigars when I’m with him.” \"She’s allergic to cigars,” explained the hus¬ band. \"I hate them,” replied the wife. Dickey Boutelle is the family’s star rider. She jumped five-foot seven inches at this year’s New Market Hounds’ show. Dickey has captured the junior jumping championship for the past two years at the Maryland Pony Show. In 1967, she won every jumping class at the show (which is the world’s largest pony show) except one. In a jump-off that year with Zim’s 36 The Maryland Horse Ranch’s Crabtree Creek, Dickey took her mount, Cheyenne, over twelve five-foot fences without a fault. Coached at the shows for the last two years by Fritz Burkhardt, Dickey has also taken a half-dozen lessons from former U.S.E.T. star Hugh Wiley. Says her stepfather: \"Hugh thinks she may have the makings of an Equestrian Team rider. Time will tell. She’s 16 right now. At that age a lot of girls forget horses when the boys start calling on them. \"But you better not call Dickey the family’s star rider in front of Margie. Margie won the Gittings class at the Maryland Pony Show this year in a class of 62 riders, including Dickey who finished fourth.” Asked about the unusual spelling of Dickey’s name, Mr. Glass said: \"She was the first child, and she was supposed to be a boy. They couldn’t name her ’Dick’ so they named her ’Dickey’.” As time goes on there figures to be many a boy who will be glad that Dickey turned out to be a girl. Her beauty is quite the equal of her horsemanship. Her sixteenth birthday came last month. Asked by her mother what she wanted as a present, she replied: \"Rubber reins and diet pills.” Off that request, Tom feels that the horses are still ahead of the boys because Dickey put the rubber reins in first place. Tom and Ellen Glass have been married three years. \"Four years ago I was so sick I almost died,” recalls the former football star. \"When I got out of the VA hospital I decided I was going to completely change my way of life. \"Up until then golf had been my hobby. I gave it up completely. As a boy and young man I had ridden a lot in Texas and Virginia. So I decided to start riding again. \"I went to Gilmore Flautt (master of the New Market Hounds) and told him I needed a big horse. I weigh 220 pounds. When I’m in the hunting field I guess my horse carries 25 ° \"Gil said he knew a lady in Middletown who nau a mare that was over 17 hands. And she could jump. The lady turned out to be Ellen. That’s how we met.” Smiling at the story, Mrs. Glass said: “Gil called me up at 7 in the morning and said he had a big man who needed a big horse and would I sell him Big Momma. I said ‘no, but you’re welcome to visit us and maybe some¬ time I’ll let your big man ride my big mare.’ So at 8 o’clock that same morning Gil showed up with Tom. \"I didn’t sell him the mare. The only way he got her was by marrying me.” Big Momma has since been retired to the broodmare band. Tom’s present No. 1 hunter (whom he un¬ ashamedly refers to as \"the world’s best hunt¬ er”) is Mr. Sam, named for the late Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sam Rayburn. His No. 2 hunter is Mr. Johnson, named for the president. \"I’m a Democrat,” said Mr. Glass. He added that his family has for many years been on close terms with the Rayburns and Johnsons. His sister worked for Mr. Johnson when he was in the Senate. Mr. Glass’s only personal attempt to gain elective office was when he ran for States At¬ torney of Frederick county and was defeated. He was, however, a magistrate in Governor September, 1968 37 Lane’s administration and was a member of the Democratic Central Committee. The bulk of his legal work today is for the State Roads Commission, representing the of¬ fice of the Attorney General. \"I’m not a Democrat who can’t see both sides,” said Mr. Glass. \"I voted for Agnew for governor and still think he’d make a good county executive. Franklin Roosevelt wasn’t the greatest man who ever lived. Just the best since Jesus Christ.” The thing that absolutely charms Tom Glass’s listeners is his unabashed statement of opinion. He lets everyone know where everybody stands in Tom Glass’s opinion. And Mrs. Glass isn’t exempted. Watching her help harness the children’s 15-year-old pony, Tom said of his wife: \"She’s an utterly remarkable woman. Nothing ever floors her. She runs this big house, handles the kids, rides, hunts, ships to the horse shows and never complains about anything. She’s in a class by herself, believe me.” Mr. Glass’s biased opinion of his wife be¬ came easy for an outsider to believe as the day wore on. At the lunch table Tom said: . . of course Ellen’s a good bit older than I am.” Mrs. Glass took the hurdle without loss of calm. \"We’re four months apart. His birthday’s in November, mine’s in July. He likes to tell people I’m older than he is. It’s getting to be an old joke.” Mrs. Glass does her talking in a rich South¬ ern accented voice. She was born, she explains, in North Carolina. Her first husband, Edward Bishop, was a native of Cumberland. Richard Boutelle, who died in 1961, was her second husband. He was president of the Fair- child airplane manufacturing company and a key figure in this country’s World War II air¬ plane design and production accomplishments. Pleasant Valley Farm was bought by Mr. Boutelle in 1953. He and h ; s family never moved to the farm. They used it on a personal basis only as a week end lodge and picnic area. An all-around sportsman, Mr. Boutelle was The Boutelle twins, Dick (left) and John (above), are not the avid horse- lovers that their sisters are. They have their own kind of fun at the farm. Marjorie, 13 years old, schools her horse in the farm's show ring without using either a saddle or bridle. The Boutelle girl rivals her older sister Dickey in the horsemanship classes. September, 1968 an avid gun collector and marksman. Still dot¬ ting the farm are skeet shooting areas which have lain idle since his death. Although Mr. Boutelle’s guests (who fre¬ quently included some of Washington’s biggest brass) were well aware of his proficiency with a gun, Ellen’s ability was not so commonly known. Among those shooting in a contest one Sun¬ day at the farm was Gen. Curtis LeMay. Mr. Boutelle defeated him, to the general’s embar¬ rassment. Not satisfied with a clear cut victory, Dick Boutelle said: \"Why you can’t shoot at all. I’ll give you a chance to get even. I’ll bet you a hundred dollars my wife can beat you.” The bet was made, the contest held and General LeMay was the loser. There are close to 200 shotguns and rifles in the Glass house today—all having been ac¬ cumulated by the late Richard Boutelle. \"They’re all functional,” said Tom, \"and they’d be easy to register if the gun control bill ever becomes law.” Tom Glass, a non-shooter, seemed sensitive to the political aspects of the arsenal. Mrs. Glass moved her family to the farm after Mr. Boutelle’s death, giving up the house they had in Hagerstown. \"The girls,” she said, ‘got interested in show¬ ing through the pony club in Frederick. For a couple of years we didn’t know what we were doing when we went to the shows.” Dickey’s first shot at the big time was in 1964 at the Maryland Pony Show held in Timonium. She took Big Momma (who stands 17.1) and entered everything that seemed appro¬ priate. Recalling the disaster, Dickey says: ‘‘I was completely disorganized. In one class I lost a stirrup off the saddle. In another my reins came undone from too much oil on them.” Said her mother: “After she came out of one class I heard a woman say: 'That child deserves something just for riding that big horse.’” Things went better in 1965. Margie won the class for equitation over fences for children under 12. And Dickey got some seconds. “But the big thing was that she attracted Fritz Burkhardt’s attention,” says Mrs. Glass. \"He agreed to coach her. Fritz holds the record for winning Gittings classes. He came up under Linky Smith. He’s the huntsman now for the Howard County Hounds. \"Fritz said Dickey had an excellent seat, and he didn’t want to change it. What she needed was advice about pace, fences and things like that. He just talks to her while she’s at a show and advises her and settles her down. \"Dickey needs help like that. The worst I ever saw her ride was at a show when she knew Hugh Wiley was watching. It surprised me. I didn’t think she’d get rattled.” Mrs. Glass also points out that no child can 40 The Maryland Horse Wearing a hunting cap in case of accident, 8-year-old John Boutelle takes off for spin in his go-cart.

His favorite flavor is butter pecan. hope to do well in the show ring unless prop¬ erly mounted. \"Dickey could be any kind of rider,” said the mother, \"but if she rode a bad horse she wouldn’t attract the judge’s attention. She didn’t have a chance with Big Momma, but Cheyenne . . . he’s something else.” Cheyenne is the first horse ever bred by Mrs. Glass. \"I had a Thoroughbred mare and I decided I wanted to breed her,” recalls the young grand¬ mother. \"So I rode her up to a farm about two miles away and said to the man: 'I want to breed my mare.’ He bred her to an Arab an stud that used to belong to Mrs. Garvin Tankersley. The foal was Cheyenne.” Cheyenne now has a full sister named Julie. September, 1968 Marshall Hawkins Tom Glass, who is Newmarket Hounds field- master, is shown above with his wife and her three daughters. From left, Katherine on Lazy Susan, Marjorie on April Love, Dickey on Julie, Mrs. Glass on Cheyenne and Mr. Glass on Mr. Sam. Mr. Sam, a retired race horse, is named for the late Sam Rayburn. Without reins or saddle, Dickey takes her outstanding jumper Cheyenne over a fence at the farm. Dickey describes schooling as an 'honesty lesson', explaining that she does it to find out if Cheyenne is still honest. 42 The Maryland Horse September, 1968 A future home-bred hunter is this filly by Martlet out of Big Momma. She is part of the Glass family's half-bred breeding pro¬ ject. At right below, Dickey takes a 5- foot 7-inch jump at Newmarket Hounds show. In the hunting field Dickey rides Julie and her mother takes Cheyenne. Mr. Glass rides Mr. Sam, who is a retired Thoroughbred race horse. Raised and trained at Pleasant Valley Farm, Cheyenne has in the past two years become one of the State’s outstanding show ring per¬ formers. Remarkably placid, the 7-year-old gelding is at a disadvantage only when he is in a class in which time is a factor. \"He’s slow,” said Dickey, \"but he’s an awful good jumper.” Although Thoroughbred production for com¬ mercial sales is taking most of Tom Glass’s time and energy, the farm also has a hunter and show horse breeding program under way. In the broodmare band are two half-bred hunter mares which are annually bred to Thor¬ oughbred stallions. These mares are the pro- All five of Tom Glass's Thoroughbred yearling colts gallop across a Pleasant Valley meadow. Eleven-year-old Katherine Boutelle is fast becoming an accomplished horsewoman like her sisters. ducers for the Glass family’s remount division. Said Tom: \"I read in The Chronicle of the Horse in an article written by Alex Mackay- Smith where the half-bred hunter was becom¬ ing impossible to find. So I figured that if they’re disappearing, then we better breed some because we’ll be needing them for years to come.” Mr. Glass says that whatever success he has had so far in breeding Thoroughbreds is at¬ tributable to the advice given him by Dr. Robert A. Leonard and Thomas R. O’Farrell. \"I’ve asked them a million questions,” says Tom, \"and they’ve been 1000 per cent coopera¬ tive.” A rugged, athletic man, Tom Glass looks the part of a football player. After graduating from Tulane (his team played in the Sugar Bowl), he went into the Army during World War II. Although commissioned as a lieutenant, he ruefully re¬ calls that the Armv made no use of him for combat purposes. \"They had a lot of football teams in the Army,” he explains, \"and every¬ where I was stationed I wound up playing football.” When he was discharged at war’s end as a first lieutenant, Tom resumed his law career in Frederick. As an avocation he coached the Frederick High School football team. Later he became a scout for the Baltimore Colts. Now fully recovered from his near fatal ill¬ ness, Mr. Glass continues to lead an athletic life. But his energies are devoted to horses rather than football and the golf course. \"I’m up by 5 o’clock and work with the horses until 8 or 8:30,” says Tom. \"I’m in the office in Frederick by 9 or 9:30 and leave about 4:30 for home. I’ve got one man who helps me with the horses sometimes.” Determined to upgrade the quality of his broodmare band, Tom points with pride to his five yearling colts. \"Our mares always produce coirs here,” he added. \"We’ve had nine /nares foal here and they’ve all had colts. The only filly we have was foaled at Tom O’Farrell’s. I told him that I’d never send any more mares over to his farm to foal.” • 44 The Maryland Horse Courtesy Amon Carter Museum, Ft.

Ball Opposite page, E. T. strokes his Jack Russell Terrier while kneeling in front of new barn which he built on his farm. Below, the trainer wraps leg of an older horse and prepares to longe yearling. 48 The Maryland Horse September, 1968 Edward T. McLean, Jr., has been called \"E.T.” ever since he was a little boy. His father, Ted, is general manager of Dela¬ ware Park. Ted had a career in mind for his only son: E.T. would be an investment banker. Today, at age 29, E.T. has settled into the life he loves. He’s a horse trainer. Did Ted take to E.T.’s decision? \"Not particularly,” replies E.T. “But I think he’s getting adjusted to it. He sent me down his whole set of Thoroughbred Sires and Dams a few weeks ago.” For four years E.T. worked in an insurance office in Baltimore. He started there when he was 19 and quit at 23. “I hated it,” he says. “I spent my time think¬ ing up excuses for going home early and coming in late. If I had stayed I’d be making more money than I am now, but except for the money I haven’t missed much. “I look around at the young fellows I worked with. They all got pot bellies and gray hair. They’re making more money, but I’m getting the happiness. “When I go to bed at night (usually 9 P.M.), I can’t wait for the next day. I love to get up in the morning (5 A.M.). I love to get to the barn before anyone else. There’s some¬ thing about it when you’re first at the barn. It’s early morning. It’s just you and the horses.” Born and raised in Maryland, E.T. comes from a socially prominent family. He was sent to the best schools but never gave much indica¬ tion of becoming a scholar. “You can say I was preoccupied with horses,” suggests E.T., \"but the truth is I didn’t like school. It was the same in college. I went to Western Reserve University for three semes¬ ters. That was the end of my schooling.” E.T. has two sisters, one younger, one older. His younger sister is Katie McLean. She lives in New York where she works for an adver¬ tising agency. His older sister, Moira, is married to Frank J. Hoen, Jr. As a teen-ager E.T. got hooked on horses. The game then was foxhunting and point-to- point races. “The last two years I worked for Mr. Parr’s insurance company (Harry A. Parr, 3rd) I spent all my time lining up mounts for myself. It was while I was working there that I broke my shoulder in a fall at Fair Hill.” Among the up-and-over set, E.T. established a reputation. He was the boy everyone called on when they had a bad horse which no estab¬ lished jockey would ride. \"I was crazy to ride some of those horses,” E.T. theorizes, \"but how else was I to get started?” Six years ago E.T. left the insurance world, much the same as he had quit his schools. Chances are neither businessman nor teacher felt the full impact of E.T. McLean’s person¬ ality. \"My first horse job was with Kenny Field,” E.T. recalls. \"I was his third string rider and exercise boy. I stayed with him two years, then went with Burling Cocks. I rode for Burly once or twice. My main job was running his farm in Unionville (Pa.). \"What do I think about riding? \"I love it. Some people get their kicks out of skiing, some out of driving fast cars, some out of drinking. \"With me it’s riding. There’s nothing like the thrill of going over a fence.” In June of last year E.T. married Anne Crockett. Anne had been the roommate of E.T.’s little sister, Katie, at Garrison Forest School. \"She’s a good horsewoman,” says E.T. \"She comes from Colorado Springs (Colorado), and she didn’t know anything about racing when we first started dating. She thought all horse trainers lived in caves, or something like that. 50 The Maryland Horse Opposite page, E. T. kills time at Timonium waiting for race in which his horse will run. Sitting with him in front of Battle Banner's stall are veterinarian. Dr. Donald Mules, and Mrs. Linky Smith. At right. Battle Banner is being saddled in the Timonium paddock. With E. T. is wife, Anne, a Garrison Forest graduate. \"She’s changed her opinion. But I guess if she could reach up in the air and grab a career for me she’d pick something else. With me it can’t be anything else. So she’s adjusted to it/’ Does Anne arise at 5 A.M. and follow her husband to the barn? \"Aw, no,’’ says E.T. with a smile. \"Eight o’clock’s her time to get up. She’s usually ready to gallop a horse for me in the second or third set.\" Is Anne a good exercise girl? \"She hasn’t been run off with so far,’’ replies E.T., \"and I don’t have to pay her anything. \"She walks hots, too.\" E.T. and Anne have nine horses for seven different owners. They train at their 3 5-acre farm in Monkton which they recently pur¬ chased from Mrs. Joseph F. Flanagan. The horses range in value from $10,000 to $1,500. \"I’ve got some theories about training,’’ says E.T. \"The first is to run them where they belong. Anybody can train a good horse. It’s the bad horse that takes time and trouble. I don’t mind shipping over the mountain (i.e. going to Shenandoah and Charles Town) if I can win a race. Better to win on the other side of the mountain than to finish seventh or eighth at Delaware Park. \"And if I get a horse that can’t make it on the flat, I experiment with him over jumps. I figure one out of every ten horses will be a better horse over jumps than on the flat. \"The cheaper a horse is the less consistent he Final instructions are given by E. T. to his jockey, Javier Canessa, who comes from Peru. September, 1968 51 September, 1968 Battle Banner's performance in his race at Timonium is reflected in the eyes of Mrs. McLean. Sitting beside her husband in the grandstand, Anne watched her colorbearer run seventh at 69-1 odds. Bred by Mrs. Henry C. Phipps' powerful Wheatley Stable, Battle Banner is by *Ambiorix out of a *Nasrullah mare. Despite his impeccable pedigree, Battle Banner has compiled a remarkably poor record. Unraced at 2 and 3 (when in Trainer Eddie Neloy's barn), Battle Banner made his first start this year at Pimlico and finished last.

A cheap horse, you don’t know. He might run his race and he might not. \"Like one horse I got. He can fly. But if he doesn’t make the lead leaving the gate, that’s it. Three-eighths of a mile and he’s had it.” How about the future? Where is E.T. going? Tm a trainer for the rest of my life,” says the young, serious-looking horseman. \"You got to buy and sell horses to stay alive. Do a little horse trading.” What about the disappointments of the game? Like when you think you’ll win a race and don’t? \"It tears you up,” replies the chain-smoking horse trainer. \"Then you look for reasons why your horse ran bad. Then you look to the future. His next race. Things like that. There’s always tomorrow in horse racing.” How about E.T.’s father? Has he opened doors for the young trainer? \"Daddy’s not built that way,” says E.T. \"I didn’t even ask for stalls at Delaware Park. I ran one horse there out of Kenny Field’s barn. The horse ran bad. We should have stayed home.” • lAiorfd s f-^iayyround lAiinner lAJai id red idy <2V. ^ean jf^oirier Text by Lucy Carter Tearing Around's sire. Rambunctious (right), is standing in Maryland at Harold Herman's Red Oak Farm. Rambunctious also won World's Playground for his first stakes triumph. As 2- year-old he won 6 races and earned $100,000. Dr and Mrs. Jean Poirer came to Maryland in July of 1961 with one purpose in mind— to farm and raise horses. Today they think that it was a pretty good move. Says Dr. Poirier: \"Were proof that you don’t need twenty $50,000 mares to produce a stakes winner.” Breeders of Tearing Around, winner of the World’s Playground Stakes at Atlantic City on September 7, they were unassuming at their first \"press conference.” \"Our first stakes winner! 1 ” said Mrs. Poirier. \"Oh, we joked around about it—we didn’t think he’d win!” The Poiriers usually sell their horses before they reach racing age. The Eastern Fall Sales are their natural outlet. Tearing Around brought $6,400 hst fall and has gone on to win three races and $26,561 this year. He is the second yearling out of Lovita H. which they have sold in the Eastern Fall Sales. In 1966 they sold a half brother, Four Straight, which was also bought by Mrs. Albert Lowenthal, owner of Tearing Around. Four Straight, a good winner, partly convinced Mr. and Mrs. Lowenthal to buy Tearing Around last year. Both Four Straight and Tearing Around were broken by Merryland Farm and are trained by J. Bowes Bond. Dr. and Mrs. Poirier look forward to racing their own horses someday—\"in about 10 years, after the children are out of college.” In the meantime they take the same kind of pride in them that parents take in watching the suc¬ cesses of their children. Says Dr. Poirier: \"I don’t know what happens when you have twenty horses running, but so far we have been able to see all of our horses run.” The Poiriers have followed all of their horses after selling them, once even getting up at 3:00 in the morning to go to Monmouth and see a horse they sold work out. The only one wh’ch they have \"lost” completely is a filly out of Luey Miss, sold in the 1967 Eastern Fall Sales. She is in Canada, as far as they know. September, 1968 55 Dr. Poirier doesn’t know whether or not they would go to Canada to see a horse run. Mr. and Mrs. Lowenthal have been most cooperative about allowing Jean and Hilda Poirier to keep track of their horses. Dr. Poir¬ ier explains their relationship as “non-partici¬ pating partners.” The Lowenthals entertained Dr. and Mrs. Poirier at Atlantic City on the day of the World’s Playground Stakes, which Dr. Poirier describes as “one pluperfect day.” They sat in a box on the finish line and had “good com¬ pany, good food and good victory.” As much as Mr. and Mrs. Lowenthal have meant to the success of the Poiriers’ Entremont Farm as buyers, Dr. Robert A. Leonard, a close neighbor, has been the “guiding light” of their operation. “He eliminated 90 per cent of the mistakes which most beginners make,” accord¬ ing to Dr. Poirier and has introduced them to countless people in the horse world. Actually, Dr. Poirier is relatively new to the roles of both horseman and doctor. He was born in Massachusetts but quit school and left home at the age of 16, joining the Merchant Marines. Three years later he returned to high school. After graduation he was drafted by die Army. Young Jean Poirier was a paratrooper in the 56 Performing in colors of Mrs. Albert Lowenthal, Tearing Around (right) gained decisive 2 1/2- length victory over Beau Brummel in Atlantic City's $25 / 000-added World's Playground S. 82nd Airborne Division during the Korean War. While stationed at Fort Bragg (N.C.) the paratrooper met his wife, Hilda, who was a social worker. When Dr. Poirier got out of the Army, he and his bride settled in her home¬ town, Elizabethtown (N.C.), where he went into the logging business. Dr. Poirier admits that the logging business was quite lucrative, but he wasn’t satisfied. He decided to go back to school, even though he didn’t have sufficient credits to get into college. Hilda, a former high school teacher, supplied the necessary tutoring by giving her husband instruction in physics and algebra. At the age of 25, Dr. Poirier resumed his formal educa¬ tion, enrolling in the University of North Carolina as a freshman. By taking 24 hours each semester (as compared to a normal of 15) and by attending summer sessions, he was admitted to medical college in two years. Upon graduating, he once more joined the Army. This time it was for financial reasons. The Army was the only place where he could intern and still make a living wage for his wife and two children. Dr. Poirier interned in Den¬ ver, where former President Eisenhower was having his cardiac, then, finally, he became a full-fledged physician, ready to settle down into practice. Although the Poiriers liked the Frederick area, they did not find their present farm right away. Dr. Poirier explains that he had abso¬ lutely no money. But, he says, the man who owned Entremont Farm was under the impres¬ sion that all doctors are “filthy rich,” and sold him the farm with no money down. Dr. Poirier recalls that it was a \"joke” among his classmates in college, the way he talked about his dream of owning a horse farm. He had always been somewhat of a race-track gambler, and his wife had ridden extensively as a teen-ager. But they had little actual back¬ ground for the Thoroughbred industry. Dr. Poirier had worked for three months as a groom when he was “quite young,” but that was the extent of his experience. Dr. Jean Poirier moved to Maryland 7 years ago. He is general practitioner in Frederick. The Maryland Horse The Poiriers met Dr. Leonard a week after they moved to Frederick. It wasn’t long before Dr. Leonard sold them their first horses. The original deal was a package of four horses for $16,000. Lovita H., dam of Tearing Around, was one of them. The other three were Lovita H.’s suckling foal (a subsequent winner, Mick McGilligan), and the broodmares Luey Miss and Pressed Duck. Pressed Duck, according to Dr. Poirier, supplied quick initiation into the horse business. Three days after the Poiriers got her to the farm she aborted. The Entremont Farm operation has remained small. They have three broodmares, three riding horses, two ponies, and a stallion which they use as a teaser. They have only one man work¬ ing on the farm, Edison Newman, who has been with them about five years. Actually, Dr. and Mrs. Poirier do most of the work themselves and would have it no other way. To Dr. Poirier, this is the way he gets his '‘kick” out of horses. \"People think I’m a gentleman farmer, but actually it’s not that way. When I’m not in the office the only time I put on a coat and tie is on Sunday.” The most unusual thing about Entremont Farm is that it has made a profit every year. This accomplishment is at least partially due to the arrangement which Dr. Poirier has with Dr. Leonard during the breeding season. The M.D. boards and foals mares for the vet. It began one year when Dr. Leonard, the veterin¬ arian, asked for extra stall space. Last year the Poiriers supervised the foaling of 15 mares. Dr. Poirier claims that they have had \"little color in terms of incidents during the foaling season,” except for once last year when he and Dr. Leonard were out sailing in the Chesapeake Bay and his wife was left at home to tend the foaling barn. Jean says that he and Dr. Leonard stopped to have a drink in Annapolis (Mrs. September, 1968 57 Poirier disgustedly asks her husband not to mention what he was doing), while his wife successfully handled her first solo delivery. From then on, Mrs. Poirier has refused to be left alone on the farm during breeding season. Dr. Poirier is Dr. Leonard’s physician and Dr. Leonard reciprocates with veterinary serv¬ ices. This arrangement works well in more ways than one. Dr. Poirier explains that the anatomy and physiology between human and horse are close enough so that Dr. Leonard can explain something and he can visualize it, or at least what it would be like on a person. In this way, their working arrangement on the farm is much closer than it would be otherwise. In addition to sailing together, Dr. Leonard and Dr. Poirier also hunt with the Newmarket Hounds. Mrs. Portier does not hunt. She broke her leg skiing a few years ago, and, in her words, it \"cut down on her desire.\" Both of their children (Stephen 13, and Cheryl, 10), ride quite a bit. They have both won Pony Club rallies in the D and C divisions, although the death of Cheryl’s pony has hampered her recent activity. Says Mrs. Poirier: \"That’s one more thing that we’re going to have to buy.\" The Poiriers have been refurbishing their farm, along with the growth of their Thorough¬ bred operation. They moved onto a place which contained an \"early 1900 Victorian house,” no fences, no roads, and a dilapidated barn. \"That’s what we’ve been doing—everything is going into the farm.\" They have built a new 16-stall barn, restored an old 8-stall barn, built double fence pad- docks, painted everywhere, and re-modeled the old farmhouse into a transplanted Southern mansion. Their home is actually remodelled to resemble their dream house which the Poiriers Lovita H., dam of Tearing Around, stands with Her 1968 foal, a colt by Clem. The mare was bought by Dr. Poirier from Dr. R. A. Leonard. first discovered in a magazine right after they were married. The resemblance between their \"new\" house and the magazine advertise¬ ment is remarkable. Dr. Poirier loves the location of his farm. \"It’s kind of like having your cake and eating it too\"—they live in the open countryside, yet the doctor is only five minutes from his office. Land values are also constantly rising, but Dr. Poirier says that the only way that he would sell would be if there were \"smoke stacks all around him.\" Dr. Poirier, who \"hasn’t enough time\" for all his hobbies (golf, sailing, horses), manages to hold down a full practice as a general prac¬ titioner in Frederick. He does have a partner, Dr. Willis Riddick, who was a classmate in medical school. \"Luckily,\" Dr. Riddick has no interest in horses, allowing Dr. Poirier to take off extra hours around foaling time and on days of important races. According to Dr. Poirier, this arrangement has been the main factor in allowing him to combine his time-consuming job with his time-consuming hobby. The Poirier children are also interested in race horses and go to the track as much as possible to see the Eentremont-bred horses run. But since many of the races are run during the school year, there are complications. The Poiri¬ ers still tell about the time their son, Stephen, had the day off from school and they planned to take a family excursion to the races. Their daughter, Cheryl, goes to a small, Catholic school nearby, which is run by cloistered nuns. Mrs. Poirier says that she called the school and explained the situation to the Sister Su¬ perior, asking if she might take Cheryl out of school for the day. Not only did the Sister Su¬ perior approve, she \"implied that she, also, might h’ke to send along a small wager, as long as it was for the sport and not for gambling.” In addition to children and horses, the Poiri¬ ers raise dogs. They have three, including a poodle from North Carolina, named Tar Baby, who is the \"most fertile thing on the place.\" At one time they had three foxhounds and Dr. Poirier used to take a small group foxhunting at night \"just to hear them.\" But his wife objected so strongly that he gave them away. So far, the Poiriers have bred nothing but winners, except the Luey Miss filly who went 58 The Maryland Horse Catalogue page from 1967 Eastern Fall Sale is reproduced at right. Hip No. 88 was Tearing Around who was bought by Mrs. Lowenthal for $6,400. J. Bowes Bond is colt's trainer. to Canada. Dr. Poirier only wishes that they had bred the two yearlings which they are selling in the Eastern Fall Sales this year: \"No, I don t own those lovely mares.” One is a filly by *Tuleg out of Roman Boat, which is out of Boat, a Man o’ War mare who produced five stakes winners, including Greek Ship and Rampart. The other, a colt, is by Amber Morn out of Colrine, a full sister to Terra Firma, and half-sister to Sunrise County. Actually, Dr. Poirier never came close to own¬ ing either Roman Boat or Colrine. He went to the Keeneland sales in November, looking for broodmares. His maximum price was $9,000. He was underbidder on \"about 5”, then gave up and began looking at attractive weanlings, which seemed to be going for reasonable prices. He bought the *Tuleg filly from Mrs. George Proskauer and the Amber Morn colt from Hamburg Place. Dr. Poirier explains that Roman Boat was apparently bred to *Tuleg (a \"stallion who just hangs around the place”), because she had been barren two years in a row and they had little hope of getting her in foal again. At any rate, it is a family joke that \"Dr. Poirier went to Kentucky looking for broodmares and came home with a *Tu-leg horse.” The Poiriers have thought about keeping the *Tuleg filly as a broodmare prospect but say they are not ready yet for anything quite that good. Eventually they plan to have about ten broodmares. Dr. Poirier is enthusiastic about Maryland, and especially the Eastern Fall Sales. He claims that even if he had $50,000 yearlings he would not take them out of the state. \"I feel that if you have quality here, the people will come to buy it. Too many people take their horses away as soon as they get something decent to sell and that hurts everybody’s prospects.” But Dr. Poirier, in his own words, \"isn’t ambitious.” He likes having a small farm, where he can be a worker rather than an \"advisor.” He feels that the quality of Maryland horses is rising so much that you don’t have to go out of the state to get what you want. He likes to feel close to his horses, his farm, and the people who buy his horses.

Mr. and Mrs. Lowenthal, at the last minute, decided to keep him at Atlantic City, because it would \"help Lovita.” The Poiriers agreed, even though they would have gotten a breeders’ bonus, had he won in Maryland. This is the way in which Dr. Poirier explains that he is in the game for sport rather than money. Dr. Poirier says that he always wanted to name a farm \"Silk Purse Farm,” out of the proverb, \"you can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.” Instead, he named it Entremont be¬ cause \"you know, sometimes I think in French, and one day I was just riding along and I looked at all these hills and the way the house lies in between the hills, and I thought 'that’s what it is, Entremont Farm’.” Dr. Poirier thinks that the area around Frederick is especially good for horses and that the mineral content in the soil has some¬ thing to contribute to the soundness of horses. Anyway, he does not consider his success an isolated instance. His final word: \"Frederick county will be heard from again!” • September, 1968 59 60 The Maryland Horse Judy Johnson America's Only Woman 'Chase Jockey And Nation's Second Licensed Woman Trainer Plucked Sir Beau From Eastern Fall Sale For $4,500 Text by Joe B. Hickey, Jr. Photographs by Peter Winants Johnson was sitting in a camp chair under a shedrow at Pimlico. She watched two youngsters astride what seemed to be very tall mounts make turn after turn of the shed. Her eyes danced as she experienced the childrens pride of accomplishment. At a glance one could tell that all was right with Judy’s world. It seemed a shame to disturb her. But when a visitor inquired if she had a few moments to spare and perched himself upon an overturned wash tub, Judy, as always, was more than willing to talk about horses, her first and lasting love. Miss Johnson, her cheeks tanned and toughened by constant exposure to the elements, and the soft, “roller” hat that is her trademark firmly placed on her head, is the Susan B. Anthony of the Turf. As a suffragette, she makes Kathy Kusner look like a Brownie. The first and only woman ever to be licensed to ride professionally in steeplechase races in this country, she was changing into silks and boots in the ladies room of the Old Clubhouse at Pimlico in 1943 when Kathy Kusner was being diapered. But unlike Miss Kusner, Judy Johnson’s quest for a license to ride was more of a lark than anything else. “I suppose Walter Haight (racing editor of The Washington Post) had as much to do with it as anyone else,” she recalls with just a touch^of glee. Judy rode in a couple of races at Pimlico before moving north of the border at the invitation of the Canadian tracks. She won seven races in the land of the Maple Leaf, five of them at Blue Bonnets. Miss Johnson holds the good 3-year-old Sir Beau at her Blarney Farm near Woodbine, Md. September, 1968 “It was an awful lot of fun,” she says, “though it was terribly embarrassing at times. The track announcer would tell the home-going crowd to come back tomorrow to see Miss Judy Johnson ride in the steeplechase. They even had me up with the celebrity parade, selling war bonds and signing autographs.” Her license to ride was not the first milestone for French-born (Chantilly), English-raised (Lingfield and Newmarket) Miss Johnson. Eight years earlier, in 1935, she missed by about a week being the first woman in America to be licensed as a trainer. After Mary Hirsch (now Mrs. Charles J. McLennan), whose father is Max Hirsch, obtained her license, several trainers, notably Matt Brady and Jim Healy, prevailed upon Judy to do the same. “My first winner was Ladovitch, who was 9 years old when I got him. Won races with him at Hialeah, Rockingham and Bowie, and he was second twice at Empire City,” she recalls. There have been a lot of stops on the road between Ladovitch and Sir Beau, Judy’s current star, but she wouldn't change any of it even if she could. Her fortunes hit an all-time low during the summer of 1952 when, within the space of 40 days her mother and brother died and a Belmont Park fire consumed her entire stable of eight horses, including the stakes-winning hurdler, Syracuse Lad. Another particularly difficult time for her occurred in the fall of 1961 when Thomas T. Mott died. Judy had been working with the Mott horses for 27 years. As after the 1952 fire, she fought her way back and is currently enjoying her most successful season, thanks to Sir Beau, a $4,500 Eastern Fall Sale buy two years ago. “You can lose your job, your wife, your husband, your money, everything,” Judy says 61 in the words of her father, Edward Johnson, \"and come back. But if you lose your nerve you’ve had it. As long as you’ve got two eyes, two legs—and your nerve—nothing is im¬ possible. Life itself is a wheel. The bottom turns to be the top just as it turns to be the bottom. \"If you don’t get too big a head while you are at the top, you won’t hurt too badly when things go the other way. That’s why I like yearlings. Claim a $5,000 horse and what have you got?—a $5,000 horse. All you can do is to improve his condition, not his class.” Asked about her success with Eastern Fall Sale yearlings, she quipped, \"It’s the place for bargains. I’ll be back!” Judy has done extremely well with Eastern Fall yearlings. She never paid more than $10,000 for a horse until she bought a Sailor— Larkswing colt at Saratoga last month for $14,000 as agent for Joseph Richards, Jr. \"I’ve known Joe Richards for years. He’s from Chevy Chase and is chairman of the board of the Suburban Trust Banks. He is co-owner of Tri Colour Stable, with Raymond A. DuFour, an insurance executive also from Chevy Chase, though his business is in Washington.” Originally, Mr. Richards raced under a stable name because he feared some folks might question the propriety of a banker owning race¬ horses (a qualm experienced many years ago by the late William Woodward, Sr.). That wore off when, at board meetings, Mr. Richards’ fellow directors insisted on knowing how his good colt was doing. This was the first order of business. \"Some of you fellows,” Mr. Richards would reply, \"must read The Racing Form, else you wouldn’t know anything about Sir Beau!” Restating that yearlings are \"her star in the sky,” Judy explained that she takes a lot of pains in selecting youngsters for her owners. 62 The Maryland Horse Winters 'TZun *Jami Fallston, Md. Mrs. Sylvia Hechter (301) 557-7151 76ave T^ouz tyeazCings 3zoken o4t \"I go through the catalog closely,” she says. \"In the dam I look for a well-bred mare represented by her first or second foal, rather than a mare that’s had a lot of ordinary winners. Take this horse here,” she said, pointing to Swift Don, \"he’s out of Noor’s Angel, who had had two foals at the races, one of whom is The Kraken, a nice grass horse by * Tennyson II. Swift Don is sired by *Don Poggio, whom I consider a better stallion than those siring the mare’s first two foals. Paid $3,100 for him last fall. He’s won two of six starts and was fourth in the Dover Stakes. He’ll be a real nice horse next year.” While she was with Mr. Mott, who was interested in steeplechasers, Judy naturally leaned to big horses. Now she favors fair-sized, compact yearlings with good legs under them. \"I spend a lot of time checking conformation, and will note in my catalog any splints, unsightly hocks, etc. that I might detect, and When Sir Beau (left) ran in the 1968 Preakness at Pimlico, Miss Johnson became first woman to saddle a starter in the Pimlico classic. also grade the yearlings that catch my eye. My top selection will be marked with five stars, then four, and so on down the line. \"This year I’ll be interested in buying about a half-dozen of the better yearlings. Tri Colour now, because of claims, has only two horses in training—Sir Beau and Swift Don. In 1965, as agent for Joe Richards, Judy bought two yearlings: a Pied d’Or—Rose Fete colt for $5,600 and a Citation—Windswift colt for $10,000, at the time the most she ever paid for a yearling. \"The Pied d’Or was named Toison d’Or and the Citation was registered as Badge of Merit. Both won, Toison d’Or being claimed for $7,500. Badge of Merit could run but he was a bit of a disappointment,” recalls the celebrated lady trainer. \"The following year, 1966, we bought three yearlings: Black Nade ($3,800), Flying Sun ($2,800) and Sir Beau ($4,500). Black Nade won two races before we lost him for $5,000; Flying Sun was claimed for $10,000 the first time we started him at Pimlico; and Sir Beau, well, you know all about him.” September, 1968 63 \"Last year, Swift Don ($3,100) and Mt. Vesuvious ($3,800) were the only yearlings we bought,” Judy reminisces. Mt. Vesuvious was claimed when entered for $15,000. Her stable depleted by claims, Miss Johnson currently has seven horses in training. She would like to carry about a dozen runners. Averaging ten to twelve wins a year, she hopes to remain a trainer as long as the Lord allows. While she trained Floating Isle, leading money-winning steeplechase winner of 1947, the hurdles stakes winner Pebalong; Homog¬ enized, added-money winner over brush; and the high-class flat horses Powder Flask (stakes) and Old Glendale, it has been Sir Beau that has given the 62-year-old Miss Johnson her proudest moments. Her $4,500 yearling has won stakes at 2 and 3 and proved worthy of contesting two of America’s greatest classics—the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. In May, upon saddling Sir Beau in the infield paddock, she became the first woman ever to train a Preakness starter. Asked to name her biggest thrill during a career that is unparalleled among her sex, Miss Johnson smiled widely and said, \"Well, I’d have to say it was the Governor’s Gold Cup last winter at Bowie. It was a $100,000 race and I was never more confident of winning in my life. Dancer’s Image was the big horse and we had beaten him in the New Year’s Handicap. \"Sir Beau is a hard-hitting, honest horse, and the Preakness and Belmont were the only two races in which he wasn’t just a couple of lengths off the winner. He won the Marlboro Nursery and the New Year’s, was second in the Governor’s Gold Cup, and third in the Bay Shore, Woodlawn and Kent. He won the prep for the Monmouth Invitational and was cut up a bit in the big one. We beat Balustrade, the winner, earlier. \"Then we moved up to Saratoga for the Travers, but the track was muddy and he didn’t run. He’s back at Blarney Farm (Judy’s Woodbine headquarters formerly operated by Rigan McKinney) getting a little rest before getting him ready for Laurel. \"He wasn’t just right for the Preakness and Belmont, you know. Sir Beau had been coughing and not 100 per cent. I thought A stakes winner at 2 and 3, the bargain yearling buy Sir Beau has given Judy her greatest thrills in racing. Some of the blankets and saddle cloths presented in feature races to Sir Beau are below. 64 The Maryland Horse EASTERN FALL YEARLING SALES—SEPTEMBER 26 A Great Cross, Man o’ War-Hyperion HP No. 8 B.

WILEY, Agent Virginia he would be a lot to handle saddling in the outdoor Preakness paddock, but when I saw how placid he was, I knew he wasn’t his old self. Then, too, he’s not the mile and a half horse you need for the Belmont. A mile to a mile and a sixteenth catches him about right. He can give you five-eighths in :59 but likes to make one big run. Chris Rogers (his regular jockey) knows this, and handles him very well. \"Yes, it’s a game of ’ups and thrills’ and bad times, too, but the minute and a half of the Gold Cup more than make up for the days, weeks and months you spend dreaming at places such as Charles Town and Shenandoah.” Yes, Judy will be back at Timonium for the Eastern Fall Sale. As she says, it’s the place to find bargains, but one need not be a woman to shop for rare buys. Finding the Armageddon—Hill Game chest¬ nut an attractive colt, she was interested because he was the first foal out of a half-sister to the dam of the Futurity and Dwyer winner Cyane. She got Sir Beau for $4,500. He’s won over $81,000. From the same sale ($800) came the $47,000 winner Cockey Miss. The year before the undefeated Like A Charm ($79,914) was purchased for just $6,500. Other Eastern Fall Sale bargains include Green Felt, a $3,500 purchase which earned $73,285; Holly-O., a $5,000 bargain that won the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and Barbara Fritchie Handicap and over $100,000. How about Prince Saim? For $4,500 his owners got a $200,000 earner that won the rich Garden State Stakes. And then there’s Sky Wonder, a $177,626 gleaner that went begging for $1,900. Solo Landing, who chalked up $77,259 in Guy Burt’s bank account, was acquired for $15,000. The list gets longer every year: Recall, Senator B., O Be Joyful, Salerno, Forest Path, etc. And from last September’s auction has al¬ ready come Tearing Around, winner this month of Atlantic City’s $25,000 World’s Playground Stakes. As the man said, it’s a game any number can play. And at Timonium the odds are you won’t have to buck up against the Engelhards, Rossos and Fords.

(301) 898-7277 producing Preciiion Performance Gaddo Captures Fair Hill ’Chase This year’s opening session of the two-day Fair Hill meet was on a late-summer day unsurpassed in memory, with just enough hint of autumn in the air to make Marylanders think of cubbing mornings and geese flying overhead and sharp afternoons at Laurel. The gently rolling course on the late William duPont’s estate near the Pennsylvania border was at its best—labeled \"firm” despite recent heavy rains, and green as an Irish landscape. On such a day, and at such a location, the feature is where you find it. On paper, it was the $4,500-added Fair Hill Steeplechase, a two mile event over brush, won by George Straw- bridge Jr.’s Gaddo, one of many Chilean-breds which have been imported in the past year or so. Gaddo, running in the colors of Mr. Straw- bridge’s Augustin Stable and trained by Jonathan Sheppard, took an early lead and never surrendered it, although several of the classy field ran at him repeatedly. Bampton Castle, the 11-year-old veteran which won this race in 1965, made his first start since returning from his trip to France for a race at Auteuil in June, hit the second fence hard and buckled badly behind. Rider Joe Aitcheson, Jr., who had made the trans- Atlantic trip to ride Mrs. William C. Riker’s big Irish horse, went forward on Bampton Castle’s neck but held him together. However, he never was able to reach the leaders. Jockey Barclay Tagg, aboard Gaddo, let the brown horse run along easily in front, glancing back occasionally to see what was happening to the competition. Edward S.

The Aitcheson family, already represented in the steeplechase game by national champion rider Joe and leading trainer J. Leiter Aitcheson, Sr., was able to celebrate the maiden victory of the senior Aitcheson’s daughter, Jane A. Curley, as one of the jumpers she trains, Southern War, won the Christiana hurdle event. Mrs. Curley, a slim and attractive redhead who also is a Baltimore model, smiled happily in the paddock after Southern War’s victory. A newly licensed trainer, she won her first race the right way, inasmuch as her other entry in the Christiana,Tacaro Landing, finished second. The winner, with Jerry Fishback up, ran in the colors of P. G. Melbourne III of Laurel. Tacaro Landing is owned by E.

Phone : 301 - 848 -1811 Hide-a-way Farm / purchased in 1963 as virgin territory, consists of hills and dells and is enhanced by the running water of Bear Branch. The farm lies about a mile East of route 140 and four miles North of Westminster. The front pasture with high elevation views scenic Carroll County. From this centre of activity, we can observe that the farm is a third pasture land, a third hard wood, and a third evergreens. Near the foot of the hill there is a quarter acre pond, fed by natural springs, for fire safety and wildlife conservation. As we look across the bottom land and the creek, we see the far hill, thus Hide-a-way offers excellent terrain for schooling horses cross country and/or pleasure riding. Basically, I am a perfectionest that stresses quality over quantity. I grew up on an Arabian breeding farm, which was established by my parents, before I came on the scene. They both have had extensive previous horse experience, are recognized judges, and are in international demand. After graduating from school, I went to Germany for close to a year and earned the bronze and then the silver medal ions, (these are equivalent to high school and college diplomas in the horse field). In order to receive these medal ions, I was tested as proficient in stable management, dressage, cross-country, jumping, halter-showing, driving, basic farriering and veterinary care, etc.. I returned four days before Christmas of 1960, via freighter, with Aladin, my Hanoverian Horse. During January of 1965, my dream-stable of many years came true as I moved in.
