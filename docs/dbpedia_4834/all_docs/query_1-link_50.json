        "text": "In the end, there wasn’t all that much drama. Since November, Thoroughbred racing’s water-cooler conversations spun a Horse of the Year debate between Triple Crown winner Justify and leading older horse and Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Accelerate. They never met on the racetrack, but they did clash in the ballot box. Sort of.\n\nIn results announced Thursday night at the Eclipse Awards ceremony at Gulfstream Park, Justify received 191 of the possible 249 first-place votes to outpace Accelerate, who received 54. Monomoy Girl (two) and Enable (one) also received first-place votes.\n\nThe National Thoroughbred Racing Association, Daily Racing Form and the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters announced that Justify who became horse racing’s 13th Triple Crown winner by sweeping the 3-year-old classics of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, was voted the 2018 Horse of the Year, at the 48th Annual Eclipse Awards Ceremony at the Hallandale Beach, Fla. racetrack.\n\nThe Eclipse Awards, honoring excellence in North American Thoroughbred racing, presented by The Stronach Group, Daily Racing Form and the Breeders’ Cup, are voted on by the NTRA, Daily Racing Form, and the National Turf Writers And Broadcasters.\n\nOwned by WinStar Farm, China Horse Club Intl., Starlight Racing and Head of Plains Partners and trained by Bob Baffert, Justify was also voted the unanimous 3-year-old champion, garnering all 249 votes. He was undefeated in six career starts, including the Santa Anita Derby and his Triple Crown sweep. He was retired in July of last year.\n\nA chestnut son of Scat Daddy out of Stage Magic by 2004 Horse of the Year Ghostzapper, Justify was bred in Kentucky by John Gunther, who was also voted Outstanding Breeder of 2018.\n\nJustify becomes the third Horse of the Year to be trained by Baffert, who also trained 2015 Horse of the Year and Triple Crown winner American Pharoah and the 2001 winner Point Given.\n\n“I’m so proud of Justify and I’m happy to see he is being rewarded for his unbelievable accomplishments in his run up to the Triple Crown,” Baffert said. “I’ve had the great fortune to be around some of the most talented horses and what Justify was able to do in such a short amount of time still takes my breath away. He is truly a horse for the ages and deserves his place among racing’s elite. I’m grateful to WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, and SF Bloodstock for sending this horse to me to train. It has been an honor and privilege and a hell of a lot of fun to be part of his story.”\n\nIn other awards tonight, the Baffert-trained Game Winner was named Champion Two-Year-Old Male for owners Gary and Mary West. Trainer Peter Miller saddled two Eclipse Award winners: Roy H repeated as Champion Male Sprinter and Stormy Liberal claimed the Champion Male Turf Horse title.\n\nSistercharlie (IRE), winner of the Maker’s Mark Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf, was voted Champion Female Turf Horse. She is trained by Chad Brown, who won the Outstanding Trainer award for the third consecutive year.\n\nHronis Racing LLC, which campaigned Accelerate to the Champion Older Dirt Male title, won the Outstanding Owner Award.\n\nIrad Ortiz Jr., who led all riders in wins with 346 and total earnings of more than $27 million was named Champion Jockey.\n\nThe complete list of 2018 Eclipse Awards winners and vote totals appears below\n\n(Horse ages in parenthesis where applicable; Country codes indicate a foreign breeding designation):\n\nTwo-Year-Old Male: Game Winner\n\nTwo-Year-Old Filly: Jaywalk\n\nThree-Year-Old Male: Justify\n\nThree-Year-Old Filly: Monomoy Girl\n\nOlder Dirt Male: Accelerate (5)\n\nOlder Dirt Female: Unique Bella (4)\n\nMale Sprinter: Roy H (6)\n\nFemale Sprinter: Shamrock Rose (3)\n\nMale Turf Horse: Stormy Liberal (6)\n\nFemale Turf Horse: Sistercharlie (IRE) (4)\n\nSteeplechase Horse: Zanjabeel (GB) (5)\n\nOwner: Hronis Racing, LLC\n\nBreeder: John D.

Eclipse sired the winners of 344 races, including three Epsom Derbies.\n\nVoting Overview\n\nIn voting that concluded January 2, 2019 Eclipse Awards voters cast their ballots to rank the top three horses and individuals in each Championship division on a 10-5-1 point system basis.
