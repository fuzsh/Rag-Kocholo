        "text": "HALLANDALE BEACH, FL – The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the Daily Racing Form, and the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters announced that Gun Runner, a winner of four Grade 1 races culminating with the $6 million Breeders’ Cup Classic, was voted the 2017 Horse of the Year at the 47th Annual Eclipse Awards Ceremony at Gulfstream Park.\n\nThe Eclipse Awards, honoring excellence in North American Thoroughbred racing, presented by The Stronach Group, the Daily Racing Form, and the Breeders’ Cup, are voted on by the NTRA, the Daily Racing Form, and the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters.\n\nOwned by Winchell Thoroughbreds LLC and Three Chimneys Farm and trained by Steve Asmussen, Gun Runner received 248 out of a possible 250 first-place votes for Horse of the Year. Juddmonte Farms’ Arrogate, who was last year’s Champion 3-year-old, received two first-place votes.\n\nGun Runner, who was also named the Champion Older Dirt Male earlier in the evening, won five of six starts during his 4-year-old season, including dominant victories in the Grade 3 Razorback Handicap at Oaklawn Park in April, the Grade 1 Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs in June, and the Grade 1 Whitney and the Grade 1 Woodward at Saratoga in August, before finishing the year with a front-running, 2 1/4-length victory in the Classic at Del Mar. Gun Runner’s only defeat last year came in the $10 million Dubai World Cup, when he finished second to Arrogate. Gun Runner later turned the tables on Arrogate, who dead-heated for fifth in the Classic. Gun Runner, ridden in all of his races last year by Florent Geroux, finished the year with earnings of $6,950,700.\n\nA chestnut son of Candy Ride out of Quiet Giant by Giant’s Causeway, Gun Runner was bred in Kentucky by Besilu Stables. Gun Runner is scheduled to make his final career start in Saturday’s $16 million Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park, then will be retired to stud duty at Three Chimneys Farm in Versailles, Kentucky.\n\nWith the crowning of Gun Runner, Steve Asmussen becomes the first trainer since the Eclipse Awards began in 1971 to train the Horse of the Year winner on four occasions. In addition to Gun Runner, Asmussen, a member of Thoroughbred Racing’s Hall of Fame, trained Curlin to Horse of the Year titles in 2007 and 2008 and the filly Rachel Alexandra in 2009.\n\nIn other awards, two horses from the barn of Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert captured the 3-year-old male and 3-year-old filly titles. Gary and Mary West’s West Coast, winner of the Travers and thePennsylvania Derby, was named Champion 3-Year-Old Male, while China Horse Club’s Abel Tasman, winner of the Kentucky Oaks and the Coaching Club American Oaks, was named Champion 3-Year-Old Filly.\n\nThe Champion 2-Year-Old Male title went to Sentient Jet Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner Good Magic. His trainer, Chad Brown, was also named Outstanding Trainer for the second consecutive year.\n\nJuddmonte Farms, which campaigned Arrogate to victories in the both the Pegasus and the Dubai World Cup, was named Champion Owner, and Clearksy Farms, breeders of Arrogate and Abel Tasman, was named the Outstanding Breeder. Jose Ortiz, who led all riders with more than $27 million in earnings, was named Champion Jockey.\n\nThe complete list of 2017 Eclipse Awards winners and vote totals appears below:\n\nTwo-Year-Old Male: Good Magic\n\nTwo-Year-Old Filly: Caledonia Road\n\nThree-Year-Old Male: West Coast\n\nThree-Year-Old Filly: Abel Tasman\n\nOlder Dirt Male: Gun Runner\n\nOlder Dirt Female: Forever Unbridled\n\nMale Sprinter: Roy H\n\nFemale Sprinter: Unique Bella\n\nMale Turf Horse: World Approval\n\nFemale Turf Horse: Lady Eli\n\nSteeplechase Horse: Scorpiancer\n\nOwner: Juddmonte Farms\n\nBreeder: Clearsky Farms\n\nJockey: Jose Ortiz\n\nApprentice Jockey: Evin Roman\n\nTrainer: Chad Brown\n\nHorse of the Year: Gun Runner\n\nThe Eclipse Awards\n\nEclipse Awards are bestowed upon the Thoroughbred horses and individuals whose outstanding achievements have earned them the title of Champion in their respective divisions.
