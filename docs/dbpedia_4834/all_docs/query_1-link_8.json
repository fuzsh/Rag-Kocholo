        "text": "2015 Eclipse Awards – The Quest\n\nCinema has the Oscar’s, television has the Emmy’s, and thoroughbred racing has the Eclipse Awards. Founded in 1971 and sponsored by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA), Daily Racing Form, and Turf Writers and Broadcasters (NTWAB), the Eclipse Awards are an annual celebration of the champion’s of the thoroughbred racing industry, both horse and human. They are named for the late great racehorse Eclipse, undefeated in 18 starts and a champion in the breeding shed. Just how good was Eclipse? 8 of his 18 wins were won via walkover, when no horses dared to take him on. While there are no Eclipse’s in the running for an award this year, there are numerous deserving horses and one of the closest divisional races in awards history.\n\nHOW DO YOU PICK A WINNER FOR CHAMPION 3 YEAR OLD MALE?\n\nCalifornia Chrome, Bayern, and Shared Belief are the nominees and you can make a legitimate case for each horse. California Chrome, bred from an $8,000 claiming mare and a stallion with a $2,500 stud fee, captivated the nation winning 4 straight Grade 1’s including the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. To add to his resume, California Chrome finished off the year with a victory in his turf debut, the Grade 1 Hollywood Derby at Del Mar. California Chrome is undoubtedly the sentimental favorite, given what he did for thoroughbred racing on a global scale, but he has some serious competition in Shared Belief and Bayern. Shared Belief, a private purchase after his debut win at Golden Gate Fields, started his career with 7 straight wins. Along the way, Shared Belief won on 5 different racetracks, at distances ranging from six furlongs to the classic distance of a mile and quarter. The feather in Shared Belief’s cap is likely his two victories against older horses in the Pacific Classic and Awesome Again Stakes. Shared Belief took the Grade 1 TVG Pacific Classic at Del Mar in impressive fashion, comfortably defeating multiple Grade 1 winning millionaire Game on Dude and the eventual runner-up in the Breeder’s Cup Classic, Toast of New York. Shared Belief followed up that score with a victory in the Grade 1 Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita in his final prep for the Breeders Cup Classic. While Shared Belief was busy racking up victories up and down the coast of California, rival Bayern was racking up the frequent flier miles. After winning his first two starts effortlessly at Santa Anita, Bayern packed his bags and embarked on a cross country journey. The journey had him race 7 times in 6 states between April and September. In the process, Bayern captured the Grade 2 Woody Stephens at Belmont Park, the Grade 1 Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park, and defeated California Chrome when winning the Grade 2 Pennsylvania Derby at Parx Casino and Racing.\n\nCALIFORNIA CHROME, SHARED BELIEF, AND BAYERN TOOK DIFFERENT PATHS THROUGH THE SPRING AND SUMMER, BUT THEY ALL SHARED A COMMON GOAL… THE BREEDERS CUP CLASSIC AT SANTA ANITA.\n\nThe race was expected to produce a clear cut winner for champion 3 year old male, and possibly Horse of the Year, but the controversial race ended up producing many more questions than answers. Shared Belief was bumped hard out of the gate by Bayern, losing several lengths and valuable early position. Shared Belief was then bumped again by a slew of outside horses looking to drop in and save ground into the first turn. When the dust settled, it was Bayern who emerged victorious, holding off a furious rally from Toast of New York and California Chrome. The victory was put on ice for a few tense moments as the stewards reviewed the incident at the starting gate. Did Bayern cause Shared Belief’s trouble at the start? Without a doubt, but did this incident at the start, a mile and a quarter from the finish, effect the outcome of the race? The stewards unanimously voted no and Bayern remained the winner.\n\nWITH A CLEAN START FOR ALL AND A DECISIVE VICTORY, THERE WOULD BE LITTLE DOUBT AS TO WHO THE CHAMPION 3 YEAR OLD MALE SHOULD BE.\n\nRarely are things clear cut in thoroughbred racing, where millions of dollars can depend on a bob of the nose. The Breeders Cup Classic did little to help the voters and left us with 3 great horses, all deserving of being champions, but only one award for their respective division. Should it be California Chrome, who won 4 straight Grade 1’s, including the first two legs of the Triple Crown, bringing numerous new fans and fresh eyes to the sport in the process? Or is Shared Belief most deserving, winning 7 straight starts, two against elders, and suffering his only defeat in his trouble filled Breeders Cup Classic? But what about Bayern, the jet-setting Grade 1 winner in 3 states and winner of the Breeders Cup Classic, the biggest race among the championship races. The Breeders Cup is the world championship of thoroughbred racing, shouldn’t the winner of its biggest race deserve to be an Eclipse champion? It is possible that one horse will win Horse of the Year and another will win 3 year old male, but our focus is on the 3 year old male division.\n\nAs you can see, each horse makes a compelling case as to why they deserve to be the champion Three Year Old male, but only one can win. Tune into the 2015 Eclipse Awards on Saturday, January 17th to see who’s connections will walk away with the hardware and the title of champion 3 year old male."
