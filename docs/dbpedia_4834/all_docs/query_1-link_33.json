        "text": "The coronavirus pandemic impacted just about everything in 2020, including sports across the globe. Thoroughbred racing was certainly impacted, but by May racetracks started reopening with limited or no fans allowed and the horses and those who care for them got back to business.\n\nNot surprisingly, the pandemic also impacted the Eclipse Awards, honoring the champions of 2020. The awards ceremony to crown the winners was held Jan. 28, 2021 as a virtual event with portions hosted from Spendthrift Farm in Lexington.\n\nAuthentic took home the top prize as Horse of the Year after winning the Longines Breeders’ Cup Classic and Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve, but he was just one of many remarkable racehorses and outstanding individuals honored for achievement during an extremely challenging year. Continue reading for a complete list of the 2020 Eclipse Award recipients.\n\nHorse of the Year: Authentic\n\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\n\nOwners: Spendthrift Farm, MyRaceHorse Stable, Madaket Stables, and Starlight Racing\n\n2020 record: 7 starts – 5 wins – 2 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $7,170,000\n\nSignature wins: Longines Breeders' Cup Classic, Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve, TVG.com Haskell Stakes\n\nNotable: One of the top 3-year-olds early in the 2020 season, Authentic cemented a Horse of the Year campaign by adding to his wins in the Kentucky Derby and Haskell Stakes with a dominant 2 ¼-length victory in the Breeders’ Cup Classic Nov. 7 at Keeneland. Incredibly consistent, Authentic was never worse than second in seven starts and one of those defeats was by a neck in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nChampion Older Dirt Male: Improbable\n\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\n\nOwners: WinStar Farm, CHC Inc., and SF Racing\n\n2020 record: 5 starts – 3 firsts – 2 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $1,810,000\n\nSignature wins: Awesome Again Stakes, Whitney Stakes, Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes\n\nNotable: He established himself as the dominant older male with consecutive Grade 1 wins in the Hollywood Gold Cup in June, the Whitney Stakes in August, and the Awesome Again Stakes in September. Improbable closed his season with a runner-up finish to 3-year-old stablemate Authentic in the Breeders’ Cup Classic, but his status atop the older male division remained intact.\n\nChampion Older Dirt Female: Monomoy Girl\n\nTrainer: Brad Cox\n\nOwners: Michael Dubb, Monomoy Stables, The Elkstone Group, and Bethlehem Stables\n\n2020 record: 4 starts – 4 wins – 0 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $1,472,068\n\nSignature wins: Longines Breeders' Cup Distaff, La Troienne Stakes Presented by Oak Grove Racing and Gaming\n\nNotable: The 2018 champion 3-year-old filly returned from the sidelines after more than 18 months off due to several injuries and didn’t miss a beat, ripping off four wins by open lengths in as many starts. She cemented a second year-end Eclipse Award with back-to-back wins in the Grade 1 La Troienne Stakes and Breeders’ Cup Distaff.\n\nChampion Male Turf Horse: Channel Maker\n\nTrainer: Bill Mott\n\nOwners: Wachtel Stable, Gary Barber, R.

She came up just short when second in the Maker’s Mark Breeders’ Cup Filly and Mare Turf, but Rushing Fall’s victories in the Grade 3 Beaugay Stakes, Grade 1 Jenny Wiley, and Grade 1 Diana proved enough to secure an Eclipse Award.\n\nChampion 3-Year-Old Male: Authentic\n\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\n\nOwners: Spendthrift Farm, MyRaceHorse Stable, Madaket Stables, and Starlight Racing\n\n2020 record: 7 starts – 5 wins – 2 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $7,170,000\n\nSignature wins: Longines Breeders' Cup Classic, Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve, TVG.com Haskell Stakes\n\nNotable: Some of the buzz that surrounded Authentic early in the year dissipated when he was soundly beaten in the Runhappy Santa Anita Derby, but he bounced back with a game victory in the Haskell July 18 and then posted a clear win over 7-10 favorite Tiz the Law in the Kentucky Derby Sept. 5. After coming up just short to Swiss Skydiver in an unforgettable edition of the Preakness Stakes, he capped his season with a win over older horses in the Breeders’ Cup Classic.\n\nChampion 3-Year-Old Filly: Swiss Skydiver\n\nTrainer: Ken McPeek\n\nOwner: Peter J. Callahan\n\n2020 record: 10 starts – 5 wins – 2 seconds – 1 third\n\n2020 earnings: $1,791,820\n\nSignature wins: Preakness Stakes, Alabama Stakes, Santa Anita Oaks\n\nNotable: Swiss Skydiver outfinished eventual Horse of the Year Authentic to win the Preakness Stakes, joining Rachel Alexandra (2009) as the only female Preakness Stakes winners since Nellie Morse in 1924 and the sixth filly to win the Preakness overall. She also won the Alabama Stakes and Santa Anita Oaks and ran second in the Longines Kentucky Oaks during a 10-race campaign in which she established herself as clearly the best of the 3-year-old filly division.\n\nChampion 2-Year-Old Male: Essential Quality\n\nTrainer: Brad Cox\n\nOwner: Godolphin\n\n2020 record: 3 starts – 3 wins – 0 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $1,335,144\n\nSignature wins: TVG Breeders' Cup Juvenile presented by Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, Claiborne Breeders' Futurity\n\nNotable: After dominating his first two races as the favorite, Essential Quality closed from off the pace to post a career-defining victory in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile by three-quarters of a length. Unbeaten with a pair of Grade 1 wins, he was an easy winner of the Eclipse Award as champion 2-year-old male.\n\nChampion 2-Year-Old Filly: Vequist\n\nTrainer: Robert E. Reid Jr.\n\nOwners: Gary Barber, Wachtel Stable, and Swilcan Stable\n\n2020 record: 4 starts – 2 wins – 2 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $1,235,500\n\nSignature wins: Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Spinaway Stakes\n\nNotable: Vequist was able to turn the tables on Dayoutoftheoffice in the Juvenile Fillies as she overhauled her familiar foe en route to a statement two-length win. The winner of the Spinaway Stakes earlier in the season, Vequist entered the Juvenile fillies off a two-length setback to Dayoutoftheoffice when second in the Grade 1 Frizette Stakes and more than made amends at the World Championships.\n\nChampion Male Sprinter: Whitmore\n\nTrainer: Ron Moquett\n\nOwners: Robert V. LaPenta, Ron Moquett, and Head of Plains Partners\n\n2020 record: 7 starts – 3 wins – 2 seconds – 0 thirds\n\n2020 earnings: $1,426,500\n\nSignature win: Breeders' Cup Sprint\n\nNotable: This hard-knocking gelding has made 38 career starts with 15 wins and has run first or second 26 times, but until 2020 he had never been able to win the big prize: the Breeders’ Cup Sprint. Having finished second and third previously in the Sprint, Whitmore closed with a powerful rush Nov. 7 at Keeneland and stormed to a career-defining 3 ¼-length victory. With three stakes wins in 2020, including the top race for sprinters, Whitmore earned his first Eclipse Award.\n\nChampion Female Sprinter: Gamine\n\nTrainer: Bob Baffert\n\nOwner: Michael Lund Petersen\n\n2020 record: 6 starts – 4 wins – 0 seconds – 1 third\n\n2020 earnings: $1,003,000\n\nSignature wins: Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint, Longines Test Stakes, Longines Acorn Stakes\n\nNotable: Gamine entered the Breeders’ Cup Filly and Mare Sprint in control of her own destiny as it pertained to an Eclipse Award with Grade 1 wins in the Acorn and Test to her credit and a chance to show her class on a nation stage. She did not disappoint in a 6 ¼-length romp as the 11-10 favorite in the Filly and Mare Sprint, making her an easy choice for the year-end title of champion female sprinter.\n\nOutstanding Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr.\n\n2020 wins: 300\n\n2020 earnings: $21,050,726\n\nSignature wins: Pegasus World Cup Invitational Stakes Presented by Runhappy, Breeders' Cup Sprint, Whitney Stakes, Jockey Club Gold Cup Stakes\n\nLeading horses: Mucho Gusto, Improbable, Whitmore, Domestic Spending, Instilled Regard, Happy Saver, Newspaperofrecord\n\nNotable: Ortiz Jr. led all North American riders by both wins and purse earnings in 2020 and ranked second by graded stakes wins with 26, behind only Flavien Prat’s 28, to bring home the Eclipse Award as outstanding jockey for the third year in a row.\n\nOutstanding Apprentice Jockey: Alexander Crispin\n\n2020 wins: 103\n\n2020 earnings: $2,194,030\n\nLeading horses: Singlino, Trunk of Money, Oxide\n\nNotable: Crispin guided Singlino to victory in the First State Dash Stakes Sept. 26 at Delaware Park for his first career stakes win.
