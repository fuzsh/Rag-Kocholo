        "text": "Bold Forbes\n\nBold Forbes overcame his humble beginnings in Puerto Rico and used his brilliant speed to wire the field in both the 1976 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. Rider Angel Cordero was a perfect fit for the horse he referred to as his Puerto Rican Rolls Royce.\n\nBold Forbes’ weapon was his intense natural speed, made even more devastating by his game and genuine attitude when challenged. Voted Champion Three Year Old Male Horse, he lost Horse of the Year honors to his future Hall of Champions stablemate Forego.\n\nRetired to stud after his 3-year-old season, he sired 13 crops of foals through 1990. Some of his offspring include Kentucky Oaks winner Tiffany Lass and Air Forbes Won."
