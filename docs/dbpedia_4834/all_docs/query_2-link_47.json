        "text": "Breeding and early years\n\nIn 1927 John D. Hertz (founder of the Yellow Cab taxicab and Hertz rental car companies) bought a young colt who had exhibited an unusual competitive spirit by having reached out and bitten another horse during a race. That colt, Reigh Count, would bring Hertz his first Kentucky Derby trophy the following year and sire an ugly duckling of a foal named Count Fleet in 1940. Count Fleet was a disappointment as a yearling and was difficult to handle. So striking were the colt’s liabilities that Hertz offered him up for sale, but no one would buy him.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll About Horse Racing Quiz\n\nWhen 1942 rolled around and there was still no buyer in sight, Hertz shipped the colt off to the races. After two losses, Count Fleet won his first race at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York in a five-and-a-half-furlong sprint in 1:06, just 3/5 second shy of the track record, and won again on July 4 at the same distance but 1/5 second faster. He lost the next time out but rebounded to win the Wakefield Stakes in New York on July 22. These performances convinced critics that he was probably the best two-year-old in the East. His only rival was Occupation, a colt whose followers were touting him for juvenile champion honours and as unbeatable after he had come off victories in the Arlington Park (Illinois) Futurity and other races. The showdown between the two was inevitable and was slated for the Washington Park Futurity in Chicago on August 15, 1942.\n\nEleven horses went to the post, with Occupation the favourite at 3–5. Count Fleet trailed at the top of the stretch following a troublesome start, and, though jockey Johnny Longden brought him up to the leader, Hertz’s horse ran out of time, losing by a neck to Occupation. Two wins followed for Count Fleet as the colt was prepared for the upcoming Futurity Stakes at Belmont Park (New York) on October 3. Just before the race, though, Longden was observed at a morning workout trying to hold in the horse as he rocketed through six furlongs, or 3/4 of a mile, in an unprecedented 1:081/5. There were too many onlookers with stopwatches for the time (one of the fastest for any horse at any age) to have been mistaken. Until then no one had thought of Count Fleet as a speedy horse, but this legendary workout changed many minds. For many years the racing world would reminisce about the morning that Count Fleet ran “eight and one.”\n\nIt came as a rather severe shock, therefore, when Count Fleet ran third in the Futurity, five lengths behind Occupation and a neck back of Askmenow. Many felt that his remarkable workout had simply drained him, yet the race was still noteworthy for turf historians: it marked the last time Count Fleet ever lost a race. He went on, in 1942, to take the one-mile Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park in the fastest mile run by any horse that year, regardless of age, sex, or track. Three more victories followed that year. Count Fleet racked up 10 wins in 15 starts, including four stakes races—the largest number of victories by a two-year-old in 1942—and earned $76,245. He easily captured best two-year-old honours.\n\n1943: Triple Crown\n\nThe 1943 Kentucky Derby was unique because war conditions nearly caused its cancellation. Count Fleet began the race as a prohibitive 2–5 favourite—the shortest price in the history of the race at that point. The only colt that figured to give him trouble was Ocean Wave, but he was scratched before the race, so there was little standing in the way of Count Fleet’s victory by three lengths.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Again, Count Fleet won easily, this time by eight lengths and in another slow time (1:572/5).\n\nAt the Belmont Stakes on June 5 only two horses were entered to compete against Count Fleet, and many wondered why they bothered. Count Fleet won by an incredible 25 lengths to capture the Triple Crown. After the race, however, it was revealed that the horse had struck himself in the left fore ankle during the early running. The injury stubbornly refused to respond completely to treatment, causing the cancellation of all further racing that year.\n\nThe unexpected turn of events did not diminish the achievements of Count Fleet during the previous six months, and he was named Horse of the Year and top three-year-old male. The injury sustained in the Belmont, however, affected his ankle, and further racing could, it was thought, perhaps cause more serious harm. Count Fleet’s racing days were over."
