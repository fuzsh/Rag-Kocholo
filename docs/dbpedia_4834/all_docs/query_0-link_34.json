        "text": "For the past few weeks, Bob Ehalt has been conducting a TRC poll with racing industry insiders to find out who they believe have been the best in three categories - horses, jockeys and trainers - competing in North America over the past half century. The results are now in, and we are revealing them this week, starting today with the industry’s verdict on the jockeys.\n\nDebates over the merits of athletes from different decades are the lifeblood of any sport.\n\nAmong National Football League fans, there have been countless arguments about whether Tom Brady is a better quarterback than Joe Montana or Johnny Unitas, which is nothing but good for the sport. While there’s usually no definitive answer for the question, fans’ passion in discussing the possibilities powerfully reflect their interest in the sport.\n\nHorse racing is, of course, no different. In 2015, within seconds of American Pharoah becoming the long-awaited 12th Triple Crown champion and ending a 37-year drought, questions about how he compared with Secretariat, Seattle Slew and Affirmed were raised and partisan opinions offered in a lively manner.\n\nWith that in mind, TRC is seeking to raise even bigger questions. Who were the best horses, trainers and jockeys of the last 50 years, from 1967-2017?\n\nHow does Todd Pletcher rate in comparison with Woody Stephens? Mike Smith with Bill Shoemaker? Secretariat with Dr. Fager or American Pharoah?\n\nExpect lively debates\n\nFor an answer, we have assembled a blue-ribbon panel of 45 voters that encompass the full scope of the racing industry with trainers, former jockeys, owners, racing executives, publicists, media members, handicappers and more, all with extensive experience in the industry. They were charged with selecting their Top Ten jockeys, trainers and horses in the past 50 years, and the consensus of their opinions figure to spark some lively debates about their choices.\n\nTo explain the parameters of the vote, in fairness to those who competed at the far end of the span, if anyone competed in 1967, their entire body of work was taken into consideration. This way all of the races and wins by horses and jockeys such as Buckpasser and Bill Hartack are included.\n\nClick here to find out who are the Top Ten trainers\n\nWe also limited the vote to horses, trainers and jockeys who spent the bulk of their career in the United States, so don’t look for Aidan O’Brien or Goldikova.\n\nToday we will begin to reveal the results, starting with the Top Ten jockeys. The Top Ten trainers and horses will be announced on Wednesday and Friday, respectively.\n\nAt the bottom of this story, there’s a grid showing all the 33 jockeys who received votes, and all the people who comprised the voting panel.\n\nSo let the debate begin!\n\nTo better understand the greatness of the Top Ten jockeys during the last 50 years, consider who didn’t make the cut and was left on the bubble.\n\nThe No. 11 jockey is Gary Stevens, a Hall of Famer with 5,124 wins (all totals in this story are through Dec. 7), $253.3 million in earnings, placing him ninth on the all-time list, 11 Breeders’ Cup wins and nine Triple Crown victories.\n\nHe’s 11th.\n\nAs for the Top Ten, we’re counting them down in reverse order:\n\n10. John Velazquez\n\n(active) 84 points\n\none 1st-place vote\n\nUsing a football analogy, Velazquez and trainer Todd Pletcher have been racing’s answer to Montana and Jerry Rice. A team since 1996, each is the all-time leading money earner in his category. They have won a multitude of a major races together, including this year’s G1 Kentucky Derby with Always Dreaming and four Breeders’ Cup races over the years.\n\nVelazquez has been remarkably consistent and efficient in his career. He’s 20th on the all-time wins list with 5,831 and his earnings of $377.3 million are more than $71 million ahead of runner-up Mike Smith.\n\nThis year, when he turned 46, he has not slowed down a bit. Aside from winning the Derby for his fourth Triple Crown win, he captured the Breeders’ Cup Distaff with Forever Unbridled and Breeders’ Cup Mile with World Approval to give him 15 wins at the World Championships – tying him for second with Jerry Bailey in that category. They were three of his eight G1 wins in 2017.\n\nA 2012 Hall of Fame inductee and two-time Eclipse Award-winner, Velazquez was New York’s leading rider in four straight years (2001-4). He has won the Saratoga riding title five times and holds the record for wins at the Spa.\n\nBorn in Puerto Rico, Velazquez has a pair of wins in both the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, winning the Derby with Animal Kingdom in 2011 and the Belmont with Rags To Riches in 2007 and Union Rags in 2012.\n\n9. Braulio Baeza\n\n(retired) 113 points\n\none 1st-place vote\n\nClass and poise separated Baeza from most of the jockeys of his generation. His mistakes were few and far between and pressure never flustered him.\n\nA 1975 Hall of Fame selection and two-time Eclipse Award winner, the native of Panama started riding in the United States in 1960 and a year later won the 1961 Belmont Stakes with Sherluck at 65-1 odds. He went on to win the 1963 Kentucky Derby with Chateaugay and added wins in the 1963 Belmont with Chateaugay and 1969 Belmont Stakes with Arts and Letters.\n\nThough he won 3,140 races, Baeza was not the kind of jockey who won meet titles by the dozens. Rather, the sport’s best trainers sought him out when they had a special horse who needed a special rider. He was the national leader in earnings in five straight years from 1965-69 and during that time won 13 straight races aboard 1966 Horse of the Year Buckpasser.\n\nBaeza, who retired in 1976, had at least one ride on horses who accounted for seven straight Horse of the Year titles, a group that includes Roman Brother, Buckpasser, Dr. Fager, Damascus, Arts and Letters, Fort Marcy and Ack Ack.\n\nThe respect for Baeza’s talents were best reflected in 1972, when trainer Vincent O’Brien brought him to Ireland to ride Darby Dan Farm’s Roberto in the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup and Baeza piloted Roberto to a shock victory over the previously undefeated Brigadier Gerard.\n\nBaeza immediately returned to the United States and the next day was aboard the undefeated Linda’s Chief in the Sanford Stakes at Saratoga. Baeza, though, would finished second to a colt who turned out to be a pretty good runner himself. You’ve probably heard of him. It was Secretariat.\n\n8. Pat Day\n\n(retired)\n\n134 points\n\nPat Day’s rise to fame started in the Midwest, but before his career ended he was a fixture on top contenders in the year’s biggest races across the nation and a familiar figure atop the national standings for wins and earnings.\n\nIn an illustrious career that spanned 1973 through 2008, Day retired among the Top 5 all-time in wins and earnings. The 1991 Hall of Fame inductee is now fourth all-time in wins 8,803 and third in earnings with $297,914,839.\n\nHe won 12 Breeders’ Cup races and, though he won the Kentucky Derby only once (1992 with Lil E. Tee), he notched five wins in the Preakness and three in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nDay, who once won eight races on one card at Arlington Park, won 322 or more races in nine straight years from 1982 to 1991, with a high of 453 wins in 1983.\n\nKnown for his patience, he rode a who’s-who of the era’s best horses, including Easy Goer, Awesome Again, Lady’s Secret, Theatrical, Personal Flag, Summer Squall, Java Gold, Dance Smartly and Unbridled.\n\nHis career started to skyrocket in 1982, when he led the nation in wins, finishing two victories ahead of Angel Cordero Jr. It marked the first of three straight years in which Day led the nation in wins.\n\nIn 1984, Day won the first of his four Eclipse Awards (also in 1986, 1987 and 1991) and also captured the inaugural Breeders’ Cup Classic aboard Wild Again.\n\n7. Bill Hartack\n\n(deceased) 155 points\n\ntwo 1st-place votes\n\nHartack was that rare blend of a tough, hard-nosed, give-no-quarter rider who had few peers in terms of talent and was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the age of 25 in 1959.\n\nHe won 4,272 races in a career from 1953-1981 and was at his best in the sport’s biggest races. He won the Kentucky Derby five times, tying him with Eddie Arcaro for the most wins in the Run for the Roses, the Preakness three times and the Belmont Stakes once.\n\nThe fiery rider was the first jockey to compile earnings of $3 million in a year and even made the cover of Time magazine in 1958.\n\nHartack was the champion jockey in wins in 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1960 and rode a list of stars that included Northern Dancer, Ridan, Iron Liege and Tim Tam.\n\nHartack passed away on Nov. 26, 2007, at the age of 74.\n\n6. Mike Smith\n\n(active) 162 points\n\nthree 1st-place votes\n\nAt the age of 52, Smith’s name does not appear in the entries as often now as it once did. Yet, if there’s a major race, few jockeys are in demand as much as Smith.\n\nDubbed ‘Big Money Mike’ by trainer Bob Baffert, Smith has ridden a parade of the sport’s biggest stars in the last two years. He won the Travers, Breeders’ Cup Classic, Pegasus World Cup and Dubai World Cup with Arrogate, was the regular rider of Songbird, who won 13 of 15 starts, and recorded 12 G1 wins this year and ten in 2016.\n\nBut fame and fortune are nothing new for Smith.\n\nIn his career, he has registered 5,431 wins and is second all-time in earnings with $305,392.697. He also holds the Breeders’ Cup record with 26 victories, a staggering 11 more than Jerry Bailey and John Velazquez who are next with 15.\n\nA two-time Eclipse Award winner and 2003 Hall of Famer, Smith won 16 straight starts with the great mare Zenyatta from 2008-10 and his list of all-star mounts includes Shared Belief, Lure, Holy Bull, Royal Delta, and Sky Beauty.\n\nIn the Triple Crown, Smith won the Kentucky Derby in 2005 with 50/1 longshot Giacomo and triumphed in the Preakness once and the Belmont Stakes twice.\n\nHe also been greatly successful on both coasts, making a name for himself in New York in 1990s, when he led New York in wins from 1991-93, and then moving west to California in 2001 and thriving there as well.\n\n5. Chris McCarron\n\n(retired)\n\n168 points\n\nChris McCarron took the racing world by storm in his youth when he won a record 547 races in 1974 while riding mostly in the Mid-Atlantic region and was honored as that year’s Eclipse Award-winning apprentice rider.\n\nWhen the big fish in a little pond took his tack to California in 1977, he was still as imposing as the shark in Jaws and quickly became one of the circuit’s most dominant riders. He won the San Felipe, Clement L. Hirsch and La Jolla Handicap seven times and the Del Mar Handicap, San Diego Handicap, Del Mar Handicap and San Bernardino six times.\n\nOverall, he won 7,141 races through 2002, putting him sixth all-time in that category, and is eighth in earnings with $263,986,005. He won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes twice each and nine Breeders’ Cup stakes, riding horses such as Alysheba, Tiznow, Sunday Silence, Touch Gold and Precisionist in those G1 classics.\n\nThe Boston native won five of those Breeders’ Cup races in the series’ richest race, the BC Classic, highlighted by back-to-back wins with Tiznow in 2000-01.\n\nInducted into the Hall of Fame in 1989, McCarron rode John Henry in the two-time Horse of the Year’s final 14 starts, winning five G1 stakes, including the 1984 Budweiser Arlington Million.\n\n4. Jerry Bailey\n\n(retired) 202 points\n\none 1st-place vote\n\nJerry Bailey was not an overnight sensation. He was a top-notch rider from the start and won New York’s Handicap Triple Crown with Fit To Fight in 1984. Yet it wasn’t until the 1990s that he became an elite rider who dominated the sport for more than a decade.\n\nFrom 1995 through 2003, he won the Eclipse Award as the year’s top rider on seven occasions, including four straight times from 2000-03. He won the Saratoga riding title in seven of eight years from 1994 through 2001 and had a record 693 Saratoga wins when he retired in 2006.\n\nIn 2003, when he turned 46, he was at his absolute best. He won 206 races, with a record-shattering 26 G1 wins among them, and earned $23,354,969, which stood as a record until 2012.\n\nIn a 32-year career, he won 5,894 races and earned $296,188,735, which is fourth all-time.\n\nA 1995 Hall of Fame inductee, he won the Kentucky Derby in 1993 with Sea Hero and 1996 with Grindstone, and also posted two wins apiece in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.\n\nHe is tied for second in Breeders’ Cup wins with 15, a figure that includes a victory in the 1993 Breeders’ Cup Classic with Arcangues, a 133/1 longshot.\n\nSome of Bailey’s best horses include Empire Maker, Medaglia d’Oro, Skip Away, Sea Hero and Saint Liam.\n\nYet the one that stands out above all the others is Cigar, who he rode to 15 of the horse’s 16 straight wins, topped by the 1995 Breeders’ Cup Classic and 1996 Dubai World Cup.\n\n3. Angel Cordero Jr\n\n(retired) 311 points\n\neight 1st-place votes\n\nWith Saratoga being the epicenter of New York racing, hearing that some 20 years after his retirement he’s still known as ‘The King of Saratoga’ says all you need to know about Angel Cordero Jr.\n\nOne of the most fiercely competitive riders in the sport’s history, Cordero was a bear to beat in a $10,000 claimer or a $100,000 stakes. While most of New York’s top riders in his era had bonds with the powerful, established stables, Cordero rode for anyone who could put him on a sharp horse.\n\nNeedless to say, when those barns needed a rider for a major stakes, they didn’t hesitate to enlist Cordero, especially at Saratoga.\n\n‘The King’ won a still unrivaled 14 Saratoga riding titles, including 11 straight during a spectacular run from 1976-1986.\n\nThe 1988 Hall of Fame inductee won the Kentucky Derby in 1976 with Bold Forbes and 1985 with Spend a Buck and posted two wins in the Preakness, including his controversial 1980 victory with Codex over the filly Genuine Risk, and one in the Belmont.\n\nThe two-time Eclipse Award winner’s total of 7,057 wins, which puts him seventh all-time, includes four Breeders’ Cup wins.\n\n2. Laffit Pincay Jr\n\n(retired) 338 points\n\neight 1st-place votes\n\nNo other jockey could match Pincay’s brilliant career for the way he mixed a prolific number of wins and an amazing amount of Graded stakes wins.\n\nWhen Pincay retired in 2003, his sustained dominance of West Coast racing allowed him to leave the sport with a record 9,530 wins and a reputation as one of the sport’s most respected jockeys in its long history. Russel Baze broke Pincay’s record in 2006, but Pincay’s stakes wins put him in a league by himself.\n\nHis horses earned $237,120,625, and the 5-time Eclipse Award winner won the Hollywood Gold Cup nine times, the Santa Anita Handicap seven times and the Del Mar Futurity four times.\n\nThe five-time Eclipse Award winner posted his lone Kentucky Derby victory on Swale in 1984 and he won the Belmont Stakes three times.\n\nHis mastery on the racetrack was also reflected in seven Breeders’ Cup wins and the way trainers turned to him to ride famed horses such as Affirmed, John Henry, Conquistador Cielo, Sham, John Henry, Bayakoa and Cougar II.\n\n1. Bill Shoemaker\n\n(deceased) 370 points\n\n21 1st-place votes\n\nFor the TRC panel, there was no question about who was the best jockey in the last 50 years.\n\nShoemaker received nearly half the 45 first-place votes, which was more than the combined 16 for Pincay and Cordero, who were second and third.\n\nSmall at 4-foot-10, Shoemaker was a giant on the racetrack. He started riding in 1949 and, when he retired in 1990, he was not just a larger-than-life star but owned the sport’s record for wins with 8,833, an honor he held for 29 years.\n\nA year after his retirement, he was paralyzed in a car accident and he passed away at the age of 72 in 2003.\n\nYet for anyone who followed the sport in the past 50 years, it’s impossible to forget ‘The Shoe’ and what he accomplished with such brilliance during an incomparable career.\n\nRecipient of the Eclipse Award in 1981, he led all jockeys in wins five times and in earnings ten times.\n\nHe won the Kentucky Derby four times, the last one in 1986 with Ferdinand when he was 54 years-old. He tacked on five wins in the Belmont Stakes and two in the Preakness.\n\nShoemaker’s ability to bring out the best in his mounts earned him rides on a long list of the best horses of his era on both coasts. Swaps, Forego, John Henry, Damascus, Round Table, Northern Dancer, Buckpasser, Jaipur, Cicada and Silky Sullivan were just a few of the great stars he rode.\n\nThe 1958 Hall of Famer won the Santa Anita Handicap a staggering 11 times and was also Spectacular Bid’s rider during an undefeated 1980 season that culminated with a walkover in the Woodward.\n\nHis best ride may have been the 1976 Marlboro Cup when he drove Forego to a dramatic victory over Honest Pleasure in the final strides.\n\nThen again, when you consider all the great rides in Bill Shoemaker’s legendary career, picking the best one of them might be a harder task than deciding who was the best jockey from 1967-2017.\n\nTHE TRC INDUSTRY POLL\n\nTop Ten Jockeys 1967-2017\n\nOthers who received votes\n\nPoints awarded on a 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis\n\nThe voters"
