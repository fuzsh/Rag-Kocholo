Indy/Tapit.\n\nFirst crop are 2-year-olds in 2024.\n\n“What I really like about Authentic’s page is a ghostly pattern of Ruffian: her half-brother Icecapade recurs top and bottom, while her sire Reviewer gave us the dam of Mr. Greeley.” —Chris McGrath, TDN\n\nInto Mischief has crossed well with mares from the Fappiano line particularly through Unbridled, who appears as broodmare sire of his brilliant daughter Covfefe. There are four Into Mischief stakes winners out of mares by Unbridled’s Song, as well as graded winner Maximus Mischief out of a mare by his son, Songandaprayer, and a stakes winner out of mares by two other sons, Political Force and Rockport Harbor. Unbridled’s Song could also be brought in through Liam’s Map, Arrogate, Midshipman and Cross Traffic. The cross of Into Mischief with a mare by Empire Maker has produced Kentucky Derby winner Mandaloun, and there is a stakes winner out of a mare by Unbridled son, Saarland. Empire Maker is sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister, and grandsire of American Pharoah, Classic Empire and Cairo Prince. A son of Into Mischief has sired a stakes winner out of a mare by Broken Vow. Out of a mare from the Cryptoclearance branch of Fappiano, Into Mischief has graded stakes winner Conquest Enforcer out of a mare by Victory Gallop, two stakes winners out of mares by Candy Ride (sire of Twirling Candy and Gun Runner) and grade one winner Doppelganger out of a mare by Quiet American (grandsire of Midnight Lute).\n\nInto Mischief has graded winner Golden Mischief out of a mare by Mr. Prospector son, Carson City, and graded winner Gas Station Sushi out of a mare by Carson City son Five Star Day, which also suggests daughters of City Zip. Into Mischief has sired stakes winners out of daughters of Mutakddim and Bob and John (both by Seeking the Gold, also sire of Petionville and Cape Town), and graded stakes winner Miss Mischief out of a mare by Lemon Drop Kid(by Kingmambo). Overall, almost any strain of Mr. Prospector might prove positive here, but we can note that Into Mischief has also sired graded winner Bye Bye out of a mare by Smart Strike (sire of Curlin – himself now broodmare sire of two Into Mischief stakes winners – Lookin At Lucky and English Channel) also has stakes winners out of mares by Thunder Gulch and Pulling Punches (by Two Punch, also sire of Smoke Glacken). It would also be interesting to experiment with mares by Street Sense, whose granddam is half-sister to Mr. Greeley, the broodmare sire of Authentic. From another branch of the sire line stemming from Mr. Prospector’s sire, Raise a Native, that of Majestic Prince, Into Mischief has graded stakes winner Mighty Mischief out of a mare by Super Saver (by Maria’s Mon), himself sire of Runhappy.\n\nInto Mischief has crossed well with mares from the Fappiano line particularly through Unbridled, who appears as broodmare sire of his brilliant daughter Covfefe.
