        "text": "East Rutherford, NJ — Harness racing’s two top-ranked horses in the final Hambletonian Society/Breeders Crown poll, No. 1 Confederate and No. 2 Sylvia Hanover, led the way when divisional Dan Patch Award honors for pacers and trotters were announced during a live presentation prior to Saturday’s (Dec. 30) card at The Meadowlands.\n\nThree-year-old male pacer Confederate became only the second unanimous selection for divisional recognition in the past six years when he was named on all 129 ballots returned in voting conducted by the U.S. Harness Writers Association. Sylvia Hanover, also a 3-year-old, was this year’s only repeat winner and became only the fifth female pacer since 1991 to garner a trophy at ages 2 and 3.\n\nThe remaining pacers to receive divisional honors were 2-year-old male Captain Albano, 2-year-old female Geocentric, older male Bythemissal, and older female Grace Hill.\n\nDivision-winning trotters were 2-year-old male Karl, 2-year-old female Soiree Hanover, 3-year-old male Tactical Approach, 3-year-old female Bond, older male It’s Academic, and older female Jiggy Jog S.\n\nThe 12 division champions will be honored during the Dan Patch Awards banquet, presented by Caesars Entertainment, at Rosen Centre in Orlando, Fla., on Feb. 25. Pacer of the Year, Trotter of the Year, and Horse of the Year will be announced at the banquet.\n\nThree trainers had two division winners each: Ron Burke, with Bythemissal and It’s Academic; Ake Svanstedt, with Bond and Jiggy Jog S; and Nancy Takter, with Karl and Tactical Approach.\n\nConfederate, trained by Brett Pelling, was this season’s richest horse, with $1.63 million. He was one of four millionaires to receive divisional honors, along with Tactical Approach, Karl, and Jiggy Jog S. Bythemissal missed earning $1 million by fewer than $16,000.\n\nIn addition to leading the sport in purses, Confederate became the fastest 3-year-old pacer in history thanks to his 1:46.1 score in September at Lexington’s Red Mile. The colt won 13 of 15 starts this season, including the Meadowlands Pace, Breeders Crown, Cane Pace, Max C. Hempt Memorial, and Kentucky Sire Stakes Championship Series final. He joined Bulldog Hanover as the only unanimous division champs since 2017.\n\nSylvia Hanover, trained by the father-son team of Mark and Shawn Steacy, won 10 of 13 races, including the Breeders Crown, Fan Hanover, and Mistletoe Shalee. She joined Warrawee Ubeaut, Pure Country, See You At Peelers, and Worldly Beauty as female pacers with division honors at ages 2 and 3 in the last 32 years.\n\nBythemissal and Grace Hill were the leading money-earners in their respective divisions.\n\nA 4-year-old gelding, Bythemissal won 11 of 16 starts, including the Breeders Crown, Aria Invitational, Allerage Open, and a division of the Sam McKee Memorial. Grace Hill, a 5-year-old mare trained by Virgil Morgan Jr., won 10 of 15 races on her way to $573,526 in purses. Her victories included the Dayton Distaff Derby, Roses Are Red, and Milton.\n\nCaptain Albano, the season’s fastest 2-year-old male pacer, with a mark of 1:49.2, won seven of nine races for trainer Noel Daley. The colt was a Pennsylvania Sire Stakes champion in addition to winning Bluegrass and International Stallion divisions. Geocentric, trained by Brian Brown, won nine of 10 races and was a sire stakes champion in Kentucky and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn the trotting side, Tactical Approach, Jiggy Jog S, and Bond followed Confederate as the top vote-getters, with each named on more than 93 percent of the ballots. Karl captured the closest contest, topping T C I, 77-48.\n\nTactical Approach was the season’s richest trotter, with $1.50 million in purses. The colt hit the board in 17 of 19 races, winning 10, with his triumphs including the Hambletonian, Breeders Crown, and Kentucky Futurity.\n\nJiggy Jog S, a 4-year-old mare who earned $1.03 million in 2023, was no worse than second in any of her 11 races, winning eight. Her victories included the Breeders Crown, Dayton Oaks, and Graduate Series final, where she defeated male rivals. She was second in the MGM Yonkers International.\n\nBond was the leading money-earner among 3-year-old female trotters, with $847,071. She won eight of 13 races, including the Breeders Crown, Elegantimage, and Delmonica Hanover, and was second in the Hambletonian Oaks.\n\nKarl was the season’s fastest 2-year-old trotter, with a mark of 1:51.2, and earned $1.04 million. He was a nose from being undefeated in 10 starts, with his wins including the Breeders Crown, Valley Victory, Kindergarten Classic Series final, and a Kentucky Sire Stakes title.\n\nIt’s Academic and Soiree Hanover both topped their respective divisions in purses, with 6-year-old stallion It’s Academic banking $951,911 and 2-year-old filly Soiree Hanover earning $607,955. It’s Academic hit the board in 16 of 18 races, with his eight victories topped by the John Cashman Memorial. The Lucas Wallin-trained Soiree Hanover was top three in nine of 10 races and counted the Jim Doherty Memorial among her six triumphs.\n\nRoom reservations at Rosen Centre for the star-studded Dan Patch Awards weekend can be made here or at the USHWA website at usharnesswriters.com.
