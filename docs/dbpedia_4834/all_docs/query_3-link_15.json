        "text": "History of the\n\nChateaugay Ore and Iron Company\n\nPage 1 Preface This year's annual inspection trip of the Board of Directors of The Delaware and Hudson Railroad Corporation includes an inspection of the plant and operations of the Chateaugay Ore and Iron Company, a subsidiary of The Delaware and Hudson Company and a substantial contributor of freight traffic to The Delaware and Hudson Railroad.\n\nIt seemed appropriate, therefore, that this history of the Chateaugay Ore and Iron Company, which was compiled by Mr. J. R. Linney, Vice President, should be prepared for the information of the Board and for the preservation of a record of the Company's activities.\n\nF. W. LEAMY.\n\nOffice of Senior Vice President,\n\nChateaugay Ore and Iron Company,\n\n32 Nassau Street, New York,\n\nJune 1, 1934.\n\nHistory of the Chateaugay Ore and Iron Company\n\n[adk19th.jpg = larger picture][above: Early 19th century ore separator in Adirondacks]\n\nThe beginning of the development of the Chateaugay Ore and Iron\n\nCompany is closely connected with the early iron industry, which was of con-\n\nsiderable importance to northern New York during most of the Nineteenth\n\nCentury, and especially to Clinton and Essex counties which, 54 years ago,\n\nproduced 23 per cent of the total iron ore output of the United States.\n\nFrom 1798, when Platt erected the first forge on the Saranac River at\n\nPlattsburg, N. Y., the iron business took on impetus. Year after year new ore\n\ndeposits were discovered and ironworks started. The Saranac River, due to\n\nits many rapids and falls, lent itself very profitably as a source of power in\n\nmany places. Its proximity to abundance of charcoaling timber and to numer-\n\nous ore beds made it ideal for ironworks locations, of which several operated\n\nsuccessfully for many years. Thus, this section of northern New York was\n\ndestined to become a large and important part of the American Bloomery.\n\nClosely associated with this industry were two men, Andrew Williams\n\nand Smith M. Weed, the founders of the Chateaugay Ore and Iron Company,\n\nand this narrative would not be complete without making brief mention of some\n\nof the activities of these two gentlemen.\n\nAndrew Williams\n\nAndrew Williams, when a young man, began work at one of the\n\nCatalan forges on the Saranac River. Having a good common school education\n\nto begin with, he applied himself diligently year after year until he became one\n\nof the best informed and most able men in the industry, always endeavoring to\n\nimprove the quality of his iron, continually prospecting and seeking purer and\n\nbetter ore deposits.\n\nSeveral years before the opening of the Chateaugay Ore Beds, it is said\n\nthat Mr. Williams had secured samples of this ore, packed it many miles through\n\nthe forests to his forge on the Saranac River, and made up special samples of\n\niron from it, which were properly ear-marked as they went to the trade, the\n\ncustomer being requested to report back as to the quality. The splendid reports\n\nreceived from various customers in the trade on the samples of iron made from the\n\nChateaugay ore and the many requests for more of it, caused Mr. Williams to\n\nbecome very much interested in the opening and development of the Chateaugay\n\nOre Bed, despite its inaccessibility. It may be that he thought along the lines\n\nof Emerson's Mousetrap Story.* * * In any event, he associated himself with\n\nSmith M. Weed and, despite the many natural obstacles, undertook to open up\n\nthis ore and make a better iron, and did so.\n\nSmith M. Weed graduated from the Law School at Harvard University\n\nin 1857, and in 1859 he married Carrie L. Standish, a daughter of Colonel\n\nMatthew M. Standish, a lineal descendant of Colonel Miles Standish, of Ply-\n\nmouth. Standish, N. Y., where the Company's blast furnace is located, was\n\nnamed for Mrs. Weed's family.\n\nMr. Weed, in addition to being an able lawyer, was a statesman of first\n\nrank. He was elected and re-elected many times to the State Assembly, and\n\nmade and retained the friendship and confidence of Governors and Presidents.\n\nMr. Weed, more than any other one man, was responsible for interesting\n\nthe Delaware and Hudson Canal Company's officers in the building of a railroad\n\nbetween Whitehall and Plattsburg. The history of The Delaware and Hudson\n\nCompany, \"A Century of Progress,\" says of Mr. Weed:\n\nEarly in 1872 he journeyed to New York in the effort to interest the\n\nDelaware and Hudson Canal Company. At a meeting with some of its officers\n\nand Managers, at which I. V. Baker who shared his aspirations was present,\n\nMr. Weed readily convinced George Talbot Olyphant, acting as president in the\n\nabsence of Mr. Dickson, LeGrand B. Cannon and others that such a line would\n\nbe of great advantage to the company. Thereupon Mr. Weed drew from his\n\npocket articles of association of The New York & Canada Railroad Company,\n\nalready signed by several residents of Plattsburg and Clinton County. The\n\nremaining signatures necessary to effect its incorporation were quickly supplied.\"\n\nIn later years, the two gentlemen who successfully founded and com-\n\nmercially developed the Chateaugay Ore and Iron Company were known as\n\nHonorable Andrew Williams and Honorable Smith M. Weed, both having won\n\ndistinction in State activities, as well as in the industrial enterprise in which they\n\nwere interested; one a master of the industrial arts, and the other a master in the\n\nart of statesmanship; both of noble character.\n\npit1878.jpg = fullsize\n\nIn 1781, the Legislature of New York set apart, in the north central\n\npart of the state, a tract of land containing about 665,000 acres, lying in Clin-\n\nton, Franklin and Essex counties, to satisfy the claims of two regiments of\n\nsoldiers which the State of New York had found it necessary to raise to protect\n\nits frontier settlements from frequent pillage by the Indians and other enemies.\n\nCongress was too poor to furnish troops for their protection, and so the State\n\nsought to raise them and pay for their services in the manner above mentioned.\n\nThis land is the so-called Old Military Tract.\n\n* * * Many are inclined to credit Elbert Hubbard with the Mousetrap Story. Sarah Yule, in a\n\nbook called 'Borrowings,\" printed many years before the Roycrofters, credits Emerson as being\n\nthe author of the quotation.\n\nDue to failure of the act to express clearly its meaning, and because of its\n\nvagueness, another act was passed in 1786, defining the area to be surveyed, and\n\nallowing the speedy sale of these and other unappropriated lands within the\n\nstate. However, no part of the Old Military Tract was ever awarded on\n\nbounty claims. It was ultimately all sold by the State as \"wild lands.\" The\n\nTown of Dannemora, in which the Chateaugay Ore Bed is located, lies in\n\nTownship No.5 of this Old Military Tract.\n\nIn September, 1794, Township No.5 became the property of William\n\nHenderson, merchant, of New York City, who sold it in January, 1795, to\n\nJacob Mark. In February of the same year, Mark mortgaged it to Jacob and\n\nRobert Leroy, and from that time on, for about a quarter of a century, it being\n\nconsidered of little value, the property changed hands a number of times.\n\nIn 1822, it was owned by John L. Norton and Hannah Murray, who divided\n\nit up into 300 lots which lay in what was afterwards incorporated into the\n\ntowns of Ellenburg and Dannemora. In the apportionment of the 300 lots\n\nbetween the owners, the part which lay in Dannemora fell to Hannah Murray,\n\nwho in turn conveyed it, on November 22, 1822, to Lloyd N. Rogers.\n\nThere is good reason for believing that the discovery of iron ore in the\n\nnorth central portion of this tract was made many years before. Several miles\n\nwestward of the Chateaugay Mine, and on the same strike as the Chateaugay\n\nOre Bed, is an old opening (81 mine), which had evidently been worked to a\n\nconsiderable extent at some remote period, a shaft having been sunk, from which\n\nquantities of waste which present day manufacturers would call good ore had\n\nbeen thrown out and left. Trees of considerable size had grown over some of\n\nthis waste pile. It is reasonable to suppose that this is the so-called Prall vein,\n\nfrom which William Bailey, who erected a forge on the Chateaugay River\n\nabout five miles below the outlet of Chateaugay Lake, in 1803, obtained his ore,\n\nshipping it on rafts or boats through the Upper and Lower Chateaugay lakes\n\nto his forge.\n\nHowever, there does not seem to be any record of the actual discovery\n\nof the Chateaugay Ore Bed up to the time of Mr. Rogers' purchase. In the year\n\n1823 the bed of ore, practically phosphorus free, now known as \"Chateaugay,\"\n\nand which has been proven to be the best in the world, was supposed to have\n\nbeen discovered by an old trapper named Collins.\n\nBut the Ore Bed lay in the depths of what was then considered an almost\n\nimpenetrable wilderness, and it was many years before any attempt was made\n\nto work it. Even after it was known, it excited little interest among capitalists,\n\nfor the reason that it was so far from lines of transportation, and lying in a\n\nregion which abounded in natural obstacles, held to be practically insurmount-\n\nable against the building of roads of any kind.\n\nIt was not until about 1868 that the first steps were taken toward\n\nutilizing this treasure, when Messrs. Foote, Weed, Meade and Waldo made a\n\ncontract with Edmund Law Rogers, of Baltimore, son of Lloyd N. Rogers, and\n\nsoon after obtained possession of the property.\n\nHowever, for a period of about five years there was very little done in\n\nthe way of development of this ore body. Small groups of men were engaged\n\nduring the summer months in digging the ore, piling it on the surface to be\n\nloaded during the winter months and hauled by horse-drawn sleighs on the\n\nsnow through the dense wilderness to the Catalan forges on the Saranac River.\n\nThe interest of the above named group was soon transferred to the\n\nChateaugay Iron Company, organized by Smith M. Weed and Andrew\n\nWilliams, and in the fall of 1873, the work of developing the property began in\n\nearnest. A plank road was built from the Saranac River Plank Road, branch-\n\ning from that road at Saranac Hollow, and running 13 miles through the\n\nmountains to the Ore Bed.\n\n[logcab85.jpg = larger picture][above: Log cabins 1885; Lyon Mt.] At this time there was only a small clearing in the dense forest, with a\n\nfew log shanties, where the village of Lyon Mountain now stands. Its only\n\ntie to civilization was the newly constructed road to Russia, N. Y.\n\nFor a period of about four years the working of the ore was confined\n\npractically to the outcroppings, loading by hand directly into wagons; and as\n\nthe pits became deeper, the sides were sloped on a grade which permitted the\n\ndriving of the wagons on the floor of the Bed. However, this method soon\n\nbecame impractical. The ore was thereafter loaded into small cars, and hoisted\n\nto the surface by means of a whimsey, the power being supplied by horses. The\n\nore was then transferred to wagons and hauled to the No. 1 Separator, which\n\nwas located on the present site of the Delaware and Hudson's turntable, on the\n\nbank of Separator Brook at Lyon Mountain.\n\nThe No. I Separator consisted of roasting pits, stamps, and jigging\n\nbaskets. The roasting pits were rectangular in shape, approximately thirty\n\nfeet long, twelve feet wide, and ten feet high, enclosed on three sides by stones.\n\nFour-foot cord wood was placed in the pit to a height of about six feet, and then\n\ncovered with three to four feet of lump ore. The wood was ignited and the\n\nore roasted until the fire burned out. In the operation there were three of these\n\npits to a unit; while the roasted ore was being taken from one pit the second pit\n\nwas roasting another batch, and the third was being prepared for still another.\n\nThis represented a cycle, with a roasted batch of ore on hand at all times. The\n\nroasting of the ore made it easier to crush.\n\nThe ore from the roasting pits was then loaded into wagons and hauled\n\nto the stamps at the Separator. A stamp consisted of a heavy stick of timber,\n\nvarying in length, hinged at one end and protected on the other by an iron plate.\n\nIt was raised by means of an eccentric, and dropped by gravity on top of the ore\n\nuntil the material was crushed fine enough to pass through 1/4\" opening.\n\nThe sizing apparatus consisted of iron bars, spaced 1/4\" apart, located\n\ndirectly under the stamp and, as the ore was crushed, it passed through these bars\n\nand was then shoveled into the jigging baskets for concentration.\n\nThe jigging baskets consisted of a screen in the shape of a cylinder open\n\nat the top, with a bail to which was attached a piece of wooden timber acting\n\nas a fulcrum or lever. The ore was shoveled into the basket, which was then\n\nlowered into a tank of water and \"jigged\" up and down. The ore, being\n\nheavier, sank to the bottom of the basket, while the rock impurities formed a\n\nlayer on the top, which was scraped off and sent to the waste pile.\n\nThe operation was continuous 24 hours daily, except Sunday, producing\n\napproximately ten gross tons of concentrated iron ore, containing about 55 per\n\ncent iron. The loss of iron in the tailings, however, was enormous. The\n\nconcentrated ore was then loaded into wagons, which held approximately two\n\ntons, and transported over the plank road to Russia, N. Y., where it was made\n\ninto blooms in the six-fire forge owned by Andrew Williams and C. F. Norton.\n\nIn the subsequent years, the property was opened up considerably. The\n\nmines were sunk deeper, necessitating larger hoisting equipment and also the\n\nintroduction of pumping machinery to take care of water drainage. Up until\n\nthis time, all of the drilling was done by hand, using jumpers and hammers,\n\ntwo men drilling on the average twelve lineal feet per shift. With the in-\n\ntroduction of compressed air driven drilling machines, the drilling and the\n\ntonnage per man per day was substantially increased. A steam sawmill was\n\nbuilt and kept in constant operation, turning out lumber for new buildings,\n\nplank roads, etc. An addition was made to the separator to take care of the\n\nincreased output of the mines. Additional miners and mill hands were brought\n\nin, until the total number of employed reached about 150. This, of course,\n\nmeant that new houses had to be built, and at this time we find about 40 houses,\n\na school house and church composing the village of Lyon Mountain.\n\nA small dam on Separator Brook, which comes brawling down from\n\nMount Lyon, secured a head of 48 feet, which was suflicient to run the separator\n\na good portion of the year, and a 30 horse power steam engine supplied whatever\n\nforce was lacking for either the separator or sawmill. The Chateaugay Ore and\n\nIron Company now owned over 35,000 acres of land in this immediate region,\n\na great portion of which was covered with heavy timber, well adapted to lum-\n\nbering and charcoaling purposes. They also had a 40-year lease on 4,000\n\n-additional acres on which the Ore Bed was located, and with the privilege of\n\ncutting every tree which grew upon it. Thus, it will be seen that they had\n\ncontrol of nearly 40,000 acres of land, with a large supply of iron ore under it\n\nand plenty of charcoaling timber on its surface.\n\nWith the increasing of men and machinery the output of concentrated\n\nore reached approximately 50 gross tons per day, containing about 55 per cent\n\niron. This was loaded into wagons and hauled over a splendid plank road to\n\nthe dock on Upper Chateaugay Lake. Here it was transferred into barges,\n\nwhich were towed to the Company's forge fires at Belmont, at the outlet of\n\nLower Chateaugay Lake, by the Company's steamer, \"Maggie,\" named after\n\nMiss Maggie Weed (daughter of Hon. Smith M. Weed).\n\nThe \"Maggie\" was 28 1/2 feet long over all, with an 11 foot beam,\n\ndrawing four feet of water. It was driven at the rate of ten miles per hour, by\n\na 25 horse power steam engine. The barge, the \"Iron Age,\" was 80 feet long\n\nand 17 feet wide, and carried approximately 150 tons of ore. After the ore\n\nwas transported to its destination, it was transferred by hand to a small car\n\nwhich was drawn by a cable to the stock piles at the forges.\n\nAt the outlet of Chateaugay Lake, at Belmont, ground was broken for\n\nthe erection of a dam and ironworks, in the year 1874, and operations began\n\nin January of the following year. The entire operations were driven by\n\nwater power under a head of 18 feet. The \"mill pond\" was 12 miles long,\n\nboth Upper and Lower Chateaugay Lakes having been raised by the dam about\n\n4 1/2 feet. All the wood, coal and ore were moved on the Lake in barges and\n\nrafts by the \"Maggie.\" Each Fall before the close of navigation, enough ore was\n\nstored at Belmont to run the forges through the Winter. There were ten first-\n\nclass fires, which were increased in later years to 20, the largest Catalan forge in\n\noperation in the country, if not in the world, at that time.\n\n[above: Flume at outlet Chateaugay Lake, furnish power to forges; 1880] [chat1880.jpg = larger picture] The forge turned out approximately 15 gross tons of half blooms per\n\nday, which the Company found no necessity for piling up, being almost con-\n\nstantly behind in their orders, due to the exceptional quality of the iron and the\n\ntremendous demand for it. The consumption of charcoal was approximately\n\n2,500 bushels per day. The Company also owned and operated a sawmill at\n\nthis location.\n\nGo to Mine History Page 2 ........\n\nRod Bigelow\n\nBox 13 Chazy Lake\n\nDannemora, N.Y. 12929 rodbigelow@netzero.net History Page BACK TO BIGELOW HOME PAGE"
