On that cross, Into Mischief has Horse of the Year Authentic out of a mare by Mr. Greeley; Grade one winners Mia Mischief and Mischievous Alex out of mares by Speightstown (sire of Munnings); graded winners out of mares by Grand Slam and his son, Limehouse; and stakes winners out of mares by Elusive Quality (an interesting cross here, and sire of Quality Road) and Proud Citizen.\n\nInto Mischief has sired seven stakes winners out of mares by Distorted Humor, including grade one winners Life is Good and Practical Joke, and there is also a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Distorted Humor son Flower Alley. Distorted Humor is by Forty Niner, and out of mares by other stallions from that line he has Goldencents out of a mare by Bankerâs Gold, graded winner Miss Sunset out of a mare by Trippi, and a stakes winner out a mare by Roar.\n\nThe cross of Into Mischief with mares from the Fappiano branch of Mr. Prospector has been an extremely productive one. Champion Covfefe is one of three graded winners out of a mare by Fappiano son, Unbridled. From mares by Unbridledâs Song, Into Mischief has four stakes winners, including Grade one winner Gina Romantica. From mares by sons of Unbridledâs Song, Into Mischief has also sired graded winner Maximus Mischief out of a mare by Songandaprayer, and stakes winner Flash of Mischief out of a mare by Political Force, also inviting daughters of Liamâs Map and Arrogate. Into Mischief also has six stakes winners, including Kentucky Derby winner Mandaloun, out of mares by Unbridled son, Empire Maker (sire of Pioneerof the Nile and Bodemeister; grandsire of American Pharoah, Cairo Prince and Classic Empire) and Unbridled might also be introduced through Broken Vow. From the Cryptoclearance branch of Fappiano, Into Mischief has graded winner Conquest Enforcer out of a mare by Victory Gallop, and three stakes winners, one graded, out of mares by Candy Ride. He also has Group one winner Doppelganger out of a mare by Quiet American, grandsire of Midnight Lute.\n\nInto Mischief has graded winner Golden Mischief out of a mare by Mr. Prospector son, Carson City, and graded winner Gas Station Sushi out of a mare by Carson City son Five Star Day, which also suggests daughters of City Zip. Into Mischief has already sired stakes winner Sittin at the Bar out of a mare by Mutakddim (by Seeking the Gold, also sire of Petionville and Cape Town), and graded stakes winner Miss Mischief out of a mare by Lemon Drop Kid (by Kingmambo). Overall, almost any strain of Mr. Prospector might prove positive here, but we can note that Into Mischief also has a graded winner out of a mare by Smart Strike (sire of Curlin, himself already broodmare sire of an Into Mischief Stakes graded stakes winner; Lookin At Lucky, broodmare sire of Into Mischief grade one winner Timberlake; and English Channel), a graded winner out of a mare by Machiavellian (sire of Street Cry and grandsire of Street Sense and Street Boss), and a stakes winner out of a mare by Pulling Punches (by Two Punch, also sire of Smoke Glacken). Mr. Prospector is a Raise a Native line stallion, and from another branch of that line, Majestic Prince, Into Mischief has graded winner Mighty Mischief out of a mare by Super Saver (sire of Runhappy), a son of Mariaâs Mon.\n\nLooking at the Northern Dancer line, the cross with Danzig line mares has an excellent strike-rate. This includes graded winner Can The Man out of a mare by Danzig himself, graded winner Instagrand out of a mare by Lawyer Ron (by Langfuhr), graded winner Ainât Easy out of a mare by Fastnet Rock (from the Danehill branch of Danzig), two stakes winners out of mares by Hard Spun and stakes winners out of mares by Lilâs Lad and Polish Numbers. There are numerous other sources of Danzig that would appeal here, including Belong to Me (who looks particularly interesting), War Front and Exchange Rate.\n\nInto Mischiefâs graded stakes winner Vyjack is out of a mare by Stravinsky, a son of the Northern Dancer horse, Nureyev. Other sources of Nureyev include Unusual Heat, Fasliyev, Spinning World, Theatrical and Atticus. Nureyev is a three-quarters brother to Sadlerâs Wells and Into Mischief is beginning to show an affinity for the El Prado branch of that line. He has graded winner Everso Mischievous out of a mare by El Prado son, Medaglia dâOro, and two stakes winners out of Medaglia dâOro son, Warriorâs Reward, which would also suggest mares by Violence, a son of Medaglia dâOro, and Kittenâs Joy, another son of El Prado.\n\nLooking at mares from the A.P. Indy line we can note Into Mischief Kentucky Oaks heroine, Pretty Mischievous and graded winner Hoosier Philly out of mares by Tapit (sire of Constitution and Frosted), grade one winner Atone out of a mare by A.P. Indy himself; two graded winners out of mares by Bernardini; graded stakes winners out of mares by Malibu Moon, Majestic Warrior and Mineshaft; and stakes winners out of mares by Congrats (brother to Flatter), Pulpit (sire of Tapit), and Aptitude.\n\nFrom the Relaunch line, Into Mischief has a Champion Two-Year-Old Filly Wonder Wheel out of a mare by Tiz Wonderful, and a Grade one winner out of a mare by that horseâs sire, Tiznow, who is also broodmare sire of multiple graded winner Mr. Money by a son of Into Mischief. Into Mischief graded winner Comical is out of a sister to Tiznow son, Colonel John, suggesting mares by Gemologist and Tizway could also work. From this same Relaunch sire line Into Mischief also has a stakes winner out of a mare by Honour and Glory (sire of Put It Back).\n\nInto Mischief is the sire of stakes winner Mischievous Mama out of a mare by Afternoon Deelites, by Private Terms, a son of Private Account (who is available through Corporate Report, Personal Flag, Unaccounted For, Secret Hello and Valley Crossing). Private Account is by Damascus, and from the Timeless Moment branch of that line Into Mischief is sire of grade one winner Audible out of a mare by Gilded Time.\n\nInto Mischief and his sire, Harlanâs Holiday, have enjoyed success with some branches of Blushing Groom. Into Mischief sired the brilliant Gamine out of a mare by Kafwain, and graded winner One Liner out of a mare by his sire Cherokee Run (also sire of Yonaguska), and Harlanâs Holiday has Champion Shanghai Bobby out of a mare by Orientate (by Mt. Livermore, also sire of Housebuster and Peaks and Valleys), a grade one winner out of a mare by Candy Stripes, and a graded winner out of a Rahy mare.\n\nInto Mischief has a grade one winner Dayoutoftheoffice and grade two winner Frankâs Rockette out of mares by Indian Charlie (sire of Uncle Mo), and two sons of Into Mischief have stakes winners on the same cross. From only seven starters out of mares by Arch (sire of Blame, himself broodmare sire of an Into Mischief stakes winner), Into Mischief has two stakes winners, including grade two scorer Bemmaâs Boy.\n\nA multiple record-breaking five-time Leading Sire, and a five-time Leading Sire of Two-Year-Olds, Into Mischief is the most dominant North American stallion of recent times.\n\nInto Mischief has been exceptional with the Gone West branch of Mr. Prospector. On that cross, Into Mischief has Horse of the Year Authentic out of a mare by Mr. Greeley; Grade one winners Mia Mischief and Mischievous Alex out of mares by Speightstown (sire of Munnings); graded winners out of mares by Grand Slam and his son, Limehouse; and stakes winners out of mares by Elusive Quality (an interesting cross here, and sire of Quality Road) and Proud Citizen.\n\nInto Mischief has sired seven stakes winners out of mares by Distorted Humor, including grade one winners Life is Good and Practical Joke, and there is also a graded stakes winner out of a mare by Distorted Humor son Flower Alley.
