That was what horse owners and trainers who survived the Triple Crown were thinking Sunday in the wake of Ruler on Ice's improbable victory in the 143rd running of the Belmont Stakes.

The same tired theme has repeated itself all season: a talented colt, on the verge of solidifying his status as the leader of the classic generation, was tripped up -- only this time, it happened literally and not just figuratively.\n\nWide-open still belongs to Animal Kingdom\n\nBelmont Stakes Contenders: Animal Kingdom Profile and Predictions\n\nAnimal Kingdom finished a hard-charging second in the Preakness Stakes. He was within a half a length of Shackleford at the finish and he was closing fast. He had no excuse for the result.\n\nBelmont Stakes Contenders: Animal Kingdom Profile and Predictions"
