I’ve always wanted one of these babies (Eclipse Award). And I’ll take it on behalf of all race callers past and present. Many hands have molded this statue, my parents never uttered a word to discourage my dream, This has been molded by many hands, far too many to mention. To the horseplayer and racing fan, if it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t be here tonight and we probably wouldn’t be wearing tuxedos. Together we saw some amazing performances over the years that enabled me to use words like courageous, determined, subline, otherworldly, magnificent, and thousands of words to only to attempt to describe the undesirable Thoroughbred.

Dr. Waldrige he’s been our vet for a year hand a half and has never sent us a bill. We started with one horse, Narrow Escape, (and now) we have more stakes winners than any farm in the history of horse racing. Gulch just turned 31, and Ogygen turned 32. After I make sure I’m standing, I make sure they are. I feel like I win the KY Derby every day when I get to feed carrots to all the horses. We’re building a branch of Old Friends at Kentucky Downs. The first ever at a race track. I’m very excited about this project.”\n\nMedia Eclipse Award for Photography:\n\nBarbara Livingston\n\n“When I was 14, I wrote in my diary that I’m going to be a horse racing photographer.

I’d like to thank my dad for giving me my first racing form. Ever since I was 15 years old, I caught the racing fever, I wanted to be either a jockey or horseplayer. What we remember is the fun, the brotherhood and the process of handicapping.”\n\nNTRA Fan Moment of the Year:\n\nCalifornia Chrome\n\n“It’s like your child hitting the home run that wins the world series.”\n\nSteve Colburn – on winning the Kentucky Derby\n\n\"Seeing your horse out there wearing the roses is something special. On future plans – “I think his grass race was awesome, so many people want this horse all over the world. Dubi isn’t out of the question, and we might be headed that way.” Art Sherman"
