        "text": "Although he never faced Big Brown or Zenyatta on the racetrack, Curlin found a way to beat them. Curlin won the three-horse race for the 2008 Horse of the Year in a romp.\n\nCurlin was named during the 38th annual Eclipse Awards ceremonies Monday night at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, winning the award for the second straight year. He becomes the first horse to win back-to-back titles since Cigar, who did it in 1995 and 1996.\n\nBig Brown, who won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, and the star filly Zenyatta each had outstanding years, and the vote was expected to be close. Instead, Curlin received 153 votes, 84 more than Zenyatta. Big Brown received only 13.\n\nThe voters were no doubt impressed by Curlin’s overall performance in 2008. He won five of seven starts, including the Dubai World Cup, the Woodward Stakes and the Jockey Club Gold Cup. In the Gold Cup, he became the first North American-based horse to top $10 million in career earnings.\n\nHe finished the year, and his career, with a fourth-place finish in the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita, where he might not have cared for the synthetic racing surface.\n\n“We all know Curlin’s 2008 record: he raced against the best, winning five of seven races and becoming the all-time highest-earning racehorse in North American history,” Jess Jackson, his owner, said last week when asked why he thought Curlin deserved to be named the Horse of the Year.\n\n“Curlin showed the heart of a champion in every race. He did everything we asked of him and more  taking on ever-more difficult challenges. He won going away, he won coming from behind, he won in the heat and in the rain.”\n\nCurlin, now retired and standing at stud at Lane’s End farm in Versailles, Ky., was also named the outstanding older horse.\n\nZenyatta was named the champion older filly or mare. She was undefeated in seven starts in 2008, which included a victory in the Breeders’ Cup Ladies Classic. Big Brown was an easy winner of the 3-year-old male title.\n\nCurlin’s trainer, Steve Asmussen, was the winner of the award for top trainer. He set a record in 2008 with 622 victories.\n\nA total of 242 votes were cast for Horse of the Year and divisional honors. Voters for the Eclipse Awards represent the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, The Daily Racing Form and the National Turf Writers Association.\n\nThe voting was close in a number of categories, none more so than the award for outstanding owner. Stronach Stables won by a single vote over I.E.A.H. Stables, which owns Big Brown.\n\nIn the 3-year-old filly division, the Kentucky Oaks winner Proud Spell won by 19 votes over Eight Belles, who finished second in the Kentucky Derby before pulling up with two broken ankles; she had to be euthanized on the track. Larry Jones trained both fillies.\n\nBenny the Bull, another horse owned by I.E.A.H., was named the champion sprinter after receiving 21 more votes than the Breeders’ Cup Sprint winner Midnight Lute.\n\nMidshipman, the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile winner, was named the 2-year-old male champion, with Vineyard Haven the runner-up. Both are owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum and have been sent to Dubai to prepare for this year’s Kentucky Derby."
