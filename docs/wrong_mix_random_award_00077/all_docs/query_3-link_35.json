        "text": "Paul McGann was born on 14 November 1959 in Liverpool, England, UK. He began his television career in the series 'Give Me A Break' (opposite Robert Lindsay), but he came fully to the public's attention as the \"I\" in the classic cult film 'Withnail and I', opposite Richard E. Grant.\n\nAlthough accruing many credits after this, the role that truly launched his career was as George Lazenby \"The Doctor\" (also known as the Eighth Doctor) in the 1996 TV movie revival of the cult BBC series, 'Doctor Who'.\n\nHowever, this single performance as The Doctor, would also be a burden, as audiences so strongly associated him with the role that it looked like it might also end his career. While the public reaction was a testament to his acting ability and suitability for the part, he was concerned about possible typecasting. He is reported to have said of that time: \"I don't want to be remembered as the George Lazenby of Doctor Who.\"\n\nBut he needn't have worried. Coming from such a strong acting family (with actor brothers Mark McGann, Stephen McGann and Joe McGann), and with a brilliant talent of his own, he was soon offered other roles and his career went from strength to strength.\n\nHe has since played roles in various films and television series, including 'Fairytale : A True Story', 'Our Mutual Friend', 'The Biographer', 'Sweet Revenge', 'Blood Strangers' and 'Queen of the Damned' (which also featured Pia Miranda).\n\nHis currently best known role is that of \"Lieutenant Bush\", opposite Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsay in the hugely popular 'Hornblower' series of films.\n\n________________________________________\n\nFILM\n\nQueen of the Damned (2002) ....
