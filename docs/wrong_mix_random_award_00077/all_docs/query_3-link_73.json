        "text": "Doctor Who's 'The Power of the Doctor' spoilers ahead.\n\nDoctor Who star Paul McGann has opened up on his return and how he thought the show was done and dusted after his TV movie.\n\nThe Whitnail and I star starred as the Eighth Doctor in the 1996 Doctor Who: The Movie, with his arc included in the canon once Russell T Davies revived the series in 2005.\n\nFor almost a decade, McGann — who recently reprised the role in Jodie Whittaker's final episode 'The Power of the Doctor' and also appears in documentary Doctor Who Am I — thought his Doctor only existed in a limbo.\n\nRelated: Doctor Who and Heartstopper share the same fan issue\n\n\"I remember thinking Doctor Who is now finished and I'm probably partly responsible for it,\" the actor told Radio Times.\n\n\"It's funny to tell now, but at the time, I really was like 'It's me and Peter Cushing. We're in the naughty room. No one's going to mention our names when they talk about Doctor Who,'\" he said.\n\nIn 2005, Davies (who's set to return to Doctor Who next year with Ncuti Gatwa as the Time Lord) included McGann's Doctor into the official story, bridging the gap between the classic episodes, the TV movie and the series' future.\n\n\"I just remember thinking, 'Oh, I love you, Russell!'\" McGann said. \"I think maybe that break needed to happen, in order for the right custodians to find it, and bring it back to its former glory with their passion,\" he continued.\n\nRelated: Doctor Who trailer confirms when 60th anniversary specials and Ncuti Gatwa's first episode will air\n\nHe first returned to the role of the Eighth Doctor in Steven Moffat's 2013 special 'The Night of Doctors', explaining it all happened very quickly.\n\n\"We were away, and I got a call from Moffat who said, 'Look, in principle, if I wrote this, would you come back?' so we had a quick conversation. I said, 'Well, can I see a script?' and he said, 'Well, I haven't written it.' I said, 'Well, when are we talking?' and he said 'Next week.' But this is how showbiz works. Even with some of the biggest actors, it just comes down to, 'Are you around next week?'\"\n\nMcGann also had a cameo in the latest special, marking the final episode with Chris Chibnall at the helm before Russell's return.\n\n\"If I never get to play the Doctor on screen again, then it was good to get back into the costume, not wear the wig, say some different lines and look a little older and hopefully sound a little wiser — it was good to do it again,\" the actor said about coming full circle."
