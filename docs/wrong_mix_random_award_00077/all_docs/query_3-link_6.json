        "text": "In a career spanning two decades, Paul McGann is best remembered for his debut performance in the cult classic Withnail & I (1986), Bruce Robinson's feature about two out-of-work actors who share a seedy Camden flat. He played 'I', the comparative straight-man to Richard E. Grant's insanely melodramatic Withnail.\n\nDespite this encouraging introduction to cinema, McGann has made only sporadic film appearances, starring in Ken Russell's The Rainbow (1989), and little-seen features, Dealers (d. Colin Bucksey, 1989), Paper Mask (d. Christopher Morahan, 1990), and Downtime (UK/France, d. Bharat Nalluri, 1997).\n\nHowever, his diverse TV work has ranged from a dashing army officer in The Monocled Mutineer (BBC, 1986), to the eighth Doctor Who in a 1996 telemovie, reintroducing him to cult status material. Brothers Mark, Stephen and Joe are also actors.\n\nMelinda Hildebrandt, Encyclopedia of British Film"
