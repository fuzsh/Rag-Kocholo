        "text": "In a recent interview with The Guardian, McGann was asked how he feels about the fact that his incarnation of the Doctor has had such a life outside of the TV series, to which he said: \"I love it. How could you not?\n\n\"The fans call me the longest and the shortest. I’ll have it. Less than two hours of screen time in 27 years, but somehow still kind of everywhere all at once. It could only happen in Who world.\n\n\"I was recently in one of the Jodie Whittaker episodes (The Power of the Doctor). That's the only time that the Eighth Doctor got on to the telly. So it gave me a little taste for it. I wouldn't mind doing some more.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nFans certainly wouldn't mind either. Last year, RadioTimes.com asked fans what they would like to see in the next spin-off show from Doctor Who, and they overwhelmingly requested a new series starring McGann's Eighth Doctor.\n\nRead more:\n\nDoctor Who's Russell T Davies reveals important dates for fans\n\nDoctor Who’s Arthur Darvill on Amy and Rory’s \"perfect ending\"\n\nWhether this comes to pass remains to be seen, but we certainly do know that new spin-offs are in the offing, with a series centred on UNIT heavily rumoured as being in development.\n\nDavies confirmed that he was developing spin-offs back in January 2023, saying that it is \"time for the next stage for Doctor Who\".\n\nHe said: \"I thought the streaming platforms are ready, the spin-offs are ready; I always believed in spin-offs when I was there. I did Torchwood as a spin-off, The Sarah Jane Adventures as a spin-off.\n\n\"Those spin-offs declined when I left, and I can see why. And I very much left after 2008, when the money became scarce. I think that's fair enough for the public service broadcaster that the money is spent on other things.\"\n\nDoctor Who is available to stream on BBC iPlayer. Classic episodes are available on BritBox – you can sign up for a 7-day free trial here.\n\nCheck out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on."
