        "text": "Stephen McGann is a British actor, author and science communicator who has starred in numerous TV series including Catherine the Great, Milk and the Hanging Gale with his brothers! Here's what you need to know about Stephen.\n\nHow old is Stephen McGann?\n\nStephen was born in 1963 making him 60.\n\nDoes Stephen McGann have a wife?\n\nYes – he is actually married to the screenwriter and Call the Midwife Creator Heidi Thomas.\n\nStephen revealed that the couple are very good at keeping private when it comes to their professional work, insisting that he doesn’t interfere with the writing process whilst Heidi refrains from commenting on his acting.\n\nHe said: \"We have a certain unspoken thing. I don't look over her shoulder as she writes. She doesn't look at the way I do lines or whatever.\n\n\"There's only one thing we share. And that's when I get the script with everybody else and then she gets really nervous because she knows I am reading the script for the first time. She hangs around outside the bedroom door.\n\n\"And there was one brilliant moment where I came out of the bedroom. She wants to know if I laugh at the funny bits, cry at the sad bits. And I came out with tears streaming down my face one day and she was chuffed!\"\n\nDoes Stephen McGann have any children?\n\nStephen and his wife Heidi have one son, Dominic.\n\nDoes Stephan McGann have any siblings?\n\nStephen has three brothers who also act. Joe McGann, Mark McGann and Paul McGann. Paul, perhaps the most famous McGann brother, has starred in many TV shows and films, including Agatha Christie’s Marple, The Musketeers, Holby City and Doctor Who.\n\nHow tall is Stephen McGann?\n\nHe stands at 5’11.\n\nWhere is Stephen McGann from?\n\nHe was born in Kensington, Liverpool.\n\nStephen McGann in Call the Midwife\n\nIf you're a fan of the BBC series Call the Midwife or if you've been on the Call the Midwife tour, you'll know that Stephen plays Dr Patrick Turner, a GP who works closely with the midwives of Nonnatus House including Nurse Trixie Franklin played by Helen George and Nurse Lucille Anderson played by Leonie Elliot.\n\nHe has been a cast member since the first season in 2012 and since then has been looking after both the mums and the midwives and nurses at Nonnatus, like when Nurse Barbara Gilbert, played by Charlotte Ritchie, sadly passed away. It has also been confirmed that he will be in the upcoming 13th series of Call the Midwife. After suffering from a mental breakdown after WWII in 1945, and losing his wife in 1957, Doctor Turner married Sister Bernadette played by actress Laura Main and the two went on to adopt a daughter together.\n\nStephen McGann talks of a Call the Midwife film\n\nStephen has previously raised the topic of a possible film on ITV show The Morning, mentioning how fans are keen for Call the Midwife to hit the big screen.\n\nHe explained: \"People are starting to talk about a film. The first answer to that was, anyone who wants to come along and make me a film star, they could come along.\n\n\"As long as it is kind of 'Doctor Turner: The Movie' it will be fine. They can come in for a little part around me that will be fine.\"\n\nStephen McGann and science\n\nAs well as acting, Stephen graduated with a master's degree in Science Communication and is a public speaker. In fact, he actually wrote an essay in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 2015 which discussed issues of medical accuracy and communication in Call the Midwife.\n\nWhere does Stephen McGann live?\n\nStephen lives in Cambridge with his wife. The couple are quite private, understandably, so we don’t have much more information other than that.\n\nHas Stephen McGann left Call The Midwife?\n\nNo! How would the midwives of Nonnatus House do without their trusty doctor and friend, Patrick. Although, he was joined by his son Timothy, who returned from medical school, in last year's Call the Midwife Christmas Special.\n\nHas Stephen McGann written a book?\n\nStephen published ‘Flesh and Blood: A History of My Family in Seven Sicknesses’ back in 2018. The book explores how various diseases in history have moulded him as a person.\n\nHe also wrote a companion book to Call the Midwife called Doctor Turner's Casebook, where he revisits medical cases featured in the TV series and discusses their historical and social contexts.\n\nFlesh and Blood: A History of My Family in Seven Sicknesses\n\nPrice: £ 6.89\n\nAlternative retailers\n\nWaterstones£ 8.99View offer\n\nWhat has Stephen McGann been in?\n\nAs well as starring in the West End musicals, Blood Brothers and Footloose, Stephen has also been in The Hanging Gale, The Strauss Dynasty and Emmerdale.\n\nWho did Stephen McGann play in Emmerdale?\n\nFrom 1999 – 2002, Stephen played haulage boss Sean Reynolds. His time in the Dales came to an end after his character, Sean, got a new job in Chester.\n\nIs Stephen on social media?\n\nYou can follow Stephen on Twitter. He does not appear to have Instagram.\n\ntm_source=dynamic&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=bau_yrs&utm_content=content_prcvip\">\n\nFeatures & Reviews Editor Emily Gilbert has been a journalist since 2016 and has worked across a variety of specialist and lifestyle brands both in print and online.
