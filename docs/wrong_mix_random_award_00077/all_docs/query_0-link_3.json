        "text": "There are plenty of new and returning cast members too, with one character – played by The Crown star Victoria Hamilton – serving as a potential new love interest for Dodds.\n\nWatkins told RadioTimes.com: \"Dodds fancies her a bit. He actually has a sort of dalliance, or it looks like he's heading that way, which is very unusual because he's been shut down in that respect for such a long time. There’s potential with this character.\"\n\nElsewhere, guest stars in episode 1 include an actor from Gentleman Jack, a former James Bond baddie, and a coach from The Voice Kids.\n\nMore like this\n\nFor more information about the McDonald & Dodds cast and who they play, read on.\n\nMcDonald & Dodds season 4 cast\n\nBelow are the main stars of McDonald & Dodds season 4.

Described as \"shy\" and \"unassuming\", DS Dodds has \"happily languished on the shelf for most of his working life\".\n\nHe's been working quietly and diligently at his desk in Bath for years without anyone taking much notice, but now his boss is hoping to push him into early retirement – so he's been paired with DCI Lauren McDonald and forced out into frontline action, which is quite a shock to the system.\n\nHowever, instead of giving up and taking his pension, Dodds proves himself a talented detective with \"a hidden talent for deciphering puzzles\".\n\nWhat else has Jason Watkins been in?

She's been in Tracey Ullman's Show, Cold Feet, Go Jetters, Arrivals, EastEnders, Plebs and Scream Street.\n\nClaire Skinner plays Chief Supt Ormond\n\nWho is Chief Supt Ormond?
