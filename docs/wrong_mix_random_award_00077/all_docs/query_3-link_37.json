The couple welcomed two sons together, Jake and Joseph.\n\nWho is Paul McGann's brother?\n\nPaul's brother is Call the Midwife star Stephen McGann, who plays Dr Patrick Turner on the show. Stephen and Paul are two of four brothers, the others being Joe and Mark, who are both actors. They also have a younger sister named Claire.\n\nPrior to starring in Call the Midwife, Stephen, 60, played the role of Sean Reynolds in the ITV soap, Emmerdale.
