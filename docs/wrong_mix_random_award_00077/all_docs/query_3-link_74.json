        "text": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 5 August 2009\n\nIn this article we called Paul McGann \"the eighth Doctor Who\". The name of the TV series is Doctor Who — the lead character is, simply, the Doctor\n\nWhat got you started?\n\nA priest. He was the deputy head at my school. I was working in a shoe shop back then, and he directed my entrance speeches for Rada. Without him, I'd never even have applied.\n\nWhat was your big breakthrough?\n\nMeeting Jim O'Brien, the director of The Monocled Mutineer [the 1986 TV drama, and McGann's first major role], when I was about 24. I'd just got back from India, and he'd been there working on The Jewel in the Crown. We connected over India – and then that was it, I was up and running.\n\nWhat one song would feature on the soundtrack to your life?\n\nPurcell's Hear My Prayer, a great crescendo of longing. Or an old country tune called If the Phone Don't Ring, You Know It's Me.\n\nDo you ever get mistaken for one of your brothers [the actors Joe, Mark and Stephen]?\n\nConstantly. If someone's raving about something one of them was in, I can always say: \"Thank you, so glad you liked it.\" Or if they didn't like it, I can say: \"Oh, that was Stephen, actually.\" Apparently Mark and I were both up for Doctor Who when I got it – and last week Joe and I were sent to the same audition. But we never discuss work. Only our mum knows what we're all up to.\n\nWhat is your biggest challenge?\n\nStaying fresh. As an actor, you get hired to repeat yourself. It wears you out.\n\nWhat's the best advice anyone ever gave you?\n\n[Withnail and I director] Bruce Robinson once said to me that the only publicity you'll ever need is good work.\n\nWhat's the greatest threat to acting today?\n\nI don't know that I see one. When we went into this big recession, my mum said: \"Well, they'll always need storytellers, lad.\" I think she's right.\n\nStage or screen?\n\nStage. You get to rehearse, it's more sociable, and you develop a technique which you can then take back on to film sets. For some reason it doesn't work the other way round.\n\nWhat advice would you give a young actor?\n\nQuestion whether you really want to do it, because without it, it's too hard. You won't take the daily rejection.\n\nWhat work of art would you most like to own?\n\nLorenzo Lotto's Portrait of a Gentleman in His Study. I'd stand in front of it, imagining it's me in the painting.\n\nWhich other living artist do you most admire?\n\nI admire artists who are ageing and still retaining their edge. Like Patti Smith – I saw her play live a few weeks ago and was moved to tears.\n\nWhy has Withnail and I become such a classic?\n\nBecause it's really, really good. And because most of us have lived like that, if only briefly.\n\nIn Short\n\nBorn: Liverpool, 1959\n\nCareer: Best known for roles in the film Withnail and I (1986) and as the eighth Doctor Who. Performs in Euripides's Helen at the Globe Theatre, London SE1 (020-7401 9919), until 23 August.\n\nHigh point: \"Being in my first movie – Withnail and I. My only ambition was to be in a picture.\""
