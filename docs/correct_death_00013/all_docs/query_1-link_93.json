        "text": ", There were few lawyers in what was to be the state of Tennessee, but with land changing hands everyday, and new institutions being founded, there was plenty of legal action, and cheap, rapidly appreciating land to grab for oneself.\n\nThe ambitious 21 year old set out to cultivate the imposing bearing of a \"gentleman\". This entailed, in those days in the South, responding to any grave insult with a challenge to a duel (if the offender was considered a gentleman too), or otherwise with whipping or caning. Indeed Jackson was, that first year, on the dueling ground for reasons unknown. Fortunately both parties, after some discussion, agreed to fire in the air and declare the matter settled.\n\nThere were two settled areas in the Western District, the Eastern settlements, around Jonesborough and Knoxville, and the Western section around Nashville. The new public prosecutor had to regularly bushwhack through dense forest where hostile Indians might attack. He showed precocious leadership once, leading his older companions out of a trap laid by Indians."
