        "text": "Andrew Jackson loved his home so much that he chose to be buried there with his beloved wife Rachel. Some say that the man known as “Old Hickory” still keeps watch over his Nashville, Tennessee, plantation.\n\n“Many people don’t think that he has ever truly left,” says Mike Zimmerman, interpretive manager for the Hermitage. “General Jackson has stayed around to watch over his home.”\n\nThe Hermitage is preserved today almost as it was during the days of the man who became an American icon and the seventh US president. Built between 1819 and 1821, the home has almost all its original furnishings including the wallpaper, which dates to the early 1800s.\n\n“No one but the Jacksons lived here. That’s why we have so many family artifacts,” Mike says. “If General Jackson were here with us, he would remember the home as it was the day when he left this world.”\n\nJackson was regarded as a rather sensitive spiritual person who loved his God, his country and his family and did what he had to do during very extraordinary times, Mike says.\n\nThe beginning\n\nJackson was born March 15, 1767, on the South Carolina border. His father died in a logging accident before Jackson was born and the family had to move in with relatives to survive.\n\nBoth of his brothers died in the Revolutionary War and his mother died when Jackson was 14. The penniless youth tried his hand at the saddlery trade and school teaching but was drawn toward the law and became a lawyer in 1787. Then he went to Nashville and found his future.\n\nStaying in a boarding house, Jackson fell in love with the owner’s daughter, 21-year-old Rachel Donelson Robards who was trying to deal with a rocky marriage. Believing that her husband Lewis Robards had obtained a divorce, Rachel and Andrew were married three years later.\n\n“Then they found out that Robards hadn’t gotten a divorce after all,” Mike says. “They were legally remarried in 1794 but the scandal plagued them the rest of their lives.”\n\nJackson’s political star rose quickly and the 37-year-old Jackson bought the Hermitage property outside Nashville during this time. “Apparently, Andrew and Rachel Jackson weren’t able to have children of their own but they were always taking in other children to raise,” Mike says.\n\nIn 1806, an incident occurred that had a lifelong effect on Jackson. A dispute arose over payment when a horse sold by the Dickinson family came up lame. It escalated when Dickinson reportedly insulted Rachel.\n\nFinally, Charles Dickinson challenged Jackson to a duel. A well-known marksman, Dickinson shot first, seriously wounding Jackson who continued to stand his ground with a bullet lodged near his heart.\n\nJackson’s duel attendant demanded that Dickinson remain on his mark in accordance with the rules of dueling. Jackson shot Dickinson dead.\n\nJackson survived his wound, although the bullet in his chest was never removed and it compromised his health later in his life. The fight enraged many in Nashville and Jackson was ostracized by much of Tennessee society.\n\nThe war hero\n\nThe War of 1812 gave Jackson a chance to save his somewhat tarnished reputation. Jackson racked up a string of victories that gained him a reputation as the country’s foremost commander in the field.\n\nHe also did an act of kindness that baffled many who saw the fury of his attacks. Jackson and his volunteers, who included Sam Houston and Davy Crockett, systematically slaughtered American Indians. When Jackson found an infant Creek boy on the battlefield, he sent the Indian baby home to be raised by Rachel in the Hermitage as one of their own. Named Lyncoya, the boy died of tuberculosis at the age of 16.\n\nThen came the Battle of New Orleans. In 1814, Jackson and his ragtag army marched into New Orleans against the British. The British suffered more than 2,000 casualties. The Americans reported fewer than 20.\n\nThe victory confirmed the Louisiana Purchase, led to the acquisition of Florida, lent respect to the Monroe Doctrine and created a healthy regard for America’s independence. The victory also made General Jackson an instant legend and propelled him toward the White House.\n\nBut his past came back to haunt him — and eventually claimed his wife.\n\nNasty election campaign\n\nThe 1828 presidential campaign set a record for mud slinging and name-calling. The worst attacks in the campaign were those on Rachel’s reputation, accusations of adultery and bigamy that hurt Jackson and his ailing wife.\n\n“Andrew Jackson won the election, of course, but Rachel never lived to be in the White House,” Mike says. “Rachel died three weeks before the inauguration.”\n\nOn Dec. 22, 1828, Rachel died, reportedly of a massive heart attack. Jackson blamed his wife’s death on the nasty campaign of 1828 and the stress of the imminent move\n\nto Washington.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Jackson laid Rachel to rest in her white inaugural gown in the garden at the Hermitage, surrounded by weeping willows. Shrouded in grief, Jackson then made his way to Washington. For the next eight years, through two tempestuous terms in office, Jackson made his mark on the presidency and the nation.\n\nOne of the accomplishments that Jackson took the most pride in was the retirement of the national debt. For the first time — and so far, the last — in American history, the United States did not owe a single penny to anyone.\n\nHome at last\n\nIn 1837, Jackson at last retired to the Hermitage at the age of 70. While in the White House, Jackson had a permanent temple made of limestone created for his wife’s grave and his own.\n\nThe structure resembled a Greek-style gazebo. Lines from the epitaph he chose for her tombstone describes “a being so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound but could not dishonor.”\n\n“Every day, he visited Rachel’s grave,” Mike says. “He missed his wife so much that he had a painting of her put in his bedroom so that she would be the last thing he saw at night and the first thing he saw in the morning.”\n\nOn June 8, 1845, the 78-year-old Jackson finally joined his wife in death. The former president died of kidney failure and was buried beside Rachel in the Hermitage garden.\n\nBut tales persist that General Jackson (as he liked to be called) often prowls the grounds — or rides them on his magnificent steed.\n\nStrange encounters offered on Hermitage Halloween tours\n\nVisitors can hear spooky tales until Nov. 9 when Hermitage guides present stories of strange encounters such as the ghosts of the Battle of New Orleans and Jackson’s infamous meeting with Tennessee’s Bell Witch.\n\nLantern tours at 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Wednesdays through Saturdays are offered to explore the mansion, grounds and cemetery. Tours cost $35. Reservations can be made by calling (615) 889-2941. The Hermitage is located at 4580 Rachel’s Lane in Nashville.\n\nOnly 25 tickets will be sold for each ghost tour. Visitors are advised to arrive early. “We don’t want any souls left behind,” a warning notes."
