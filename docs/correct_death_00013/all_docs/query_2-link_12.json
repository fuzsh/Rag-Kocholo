        "text": "History\n\nThe Nashville area was originally inhabited by peoples of the Mississippian culture; Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Shawnee later moved into the region. French fur traders established a post known as French Lick on the site in 1717. A force behind the area’s settlement was Richard Henderson, a North Carolina jurist who in 1775 acquired most of middle Tennessee and Kentucky in the Transylvania Purchase from the Cherokee. In 1779 he sent a party under James Robertson to investigate the Cumberland Valley. They settled at French Lick and were joined in the spring of 1780 by another group under John Donelson. Fort Nashborough, built at the site and named for American Revolutionary War general Francis Nash, became the centre of the new community. (A replica of the fort stands in a park along the Cumberland River.) Henderson is also credited with having written the Cumberland Compact, the articles of self-government adopted by the settlers. The community was renamed Nashville in 1784.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nU.S. State Capitals Quiz\n\nChartered as a city in 1806, Nashville developed as a river trade depot and manufacturing site for middle Tennessee and became the political centre of the state. Its commercial importance was further enhanced by the advent of the railroads in the 1850s. Nashville was occupied by Union troops in February 1862, and the last major American Civil War battle (December 15–16, 1864) took place outside the city, when Union forces under Gen. George H. Thomas defeated the Confederates under Gen. John B. Hood.\n\nNashville’s recovery after the war was spurred by its central location in the region’s rail and water transport networks, although it experienced serious cholera epidemics in 1866 and 1873. The city became known for the many institutions of higher education that were founded there and was given the nickname “Athens of the South.” Nashville’s economy and population grew rapidly in the first decades of the 20th century, and it was also during that time that the city emerged as the centre of American traditional and country music. Regular radio broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, a program of such music, began in Nashville in 1925 and continue today. Nashville’s industrial development accelerated in the 1930s after cheap electric power became available from the Tennessee Valley Authority and from dams on the Cumberland River. However, when it flooded after a two-day downpour in May 2010, the Cumberland brought damage to large parts of the city and took a number of lives.\n\nThe contemporary city\n\nThe modern economy is diversified. The music and entertainment industry is a primary factor, and services such as health care, finance and insurance, and education are major contributors. Manufacturing (including automobiles, automobile glass, trucks, tires, water heaters, aircraft parts, and appliances), printing and publishing (especially music and religious materials), and tourism are also important. The city’s central location, combined with an international airport, port facilities on the Cumberland, and rail and highway connections, make it a distribution and transportation centre. Agriculture in the region includes tobacco, livestock, dairy products, corn, and soybeans.\n\nNashville is known worldwide for country music, which is the basis of a large recording industry in the city. Much of that activity is clustered in an area of downtown called Music Row. The city has dozens of tourist attractions related to music, including the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Ryman Auditorium, a concert venue that was once the home of the Opry. Grand Ole Opry radio shows can be seen in person at the Opry House, which is part of a complex including a hotel and shopping venues located east of downtown. At the International Country Music Fan Fair, held annually in June, fans can hear, meet, and get autographs from their favourite musicians.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The city is the national headquarters of several boards and agencies of the United Methodist Church and the Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention. It is also the international headquarters of the Disciples of Christ Historical Society. Educational institutions affiliated with churches include Fisk University (1866; United Church of Christ), Belmont University (1890; Tennessee Southern Baptist Convention), Lipscomb University (1891; Churches of Christ), Trevecca Nazarene University (1901), and Aquinas College (1961; Roman Catholic). Nashville is also the seat of Vanderbilt University (1873), Meharry Medical College (1876), Tennessee State University (1912), and Nashville State Technical Institute (1970).\n\nIn Centennial Park is a full-scale replica of the Parthenon (an Athenian temple), built for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897 and containing a statue of Athena 42 feet (13 metres) tall. The State Capitol (1859) was designed along classical Greek lines by William Strickland; Pres. James K. Polk is buried in its grounds. Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, near the building, includes a black granite globe as a memorial to World War II. The Hermitage, the home and burial place of Pres. Andrew Jackson, is 12 miles (19 km) east of the city centre. Other historic sites include Belle Meade Plantation, with a mansion built in 1853 on one of the country’s first Thoroughbred horse farms, and Travellers Rest (1799), built by John Overton (a law partner of Jackson’s) and maintained as a museum. The city has a symphony orchestra, an opera company, a ballet troupe, and theatre organizations; there are also museums of history, art, and science. Nashville is home to the National Football League Titans and National Hockey League Predators. Nearby Old Hickory (northeast) and J. Percy Priest (east) lakes provide recreational opportunities. Radnor Lake State Natural Area (south) and Long Hunter State Park (east) are also near the city."
