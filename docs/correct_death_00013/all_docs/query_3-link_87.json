        "text": "Can you view the house that Andrew Jackson lived in on the park?\n\nThere is not a house on the park that Andrew Jackson lived in while growing up in South Carolina. Archaeological work has not discovered any remains of the log house the President lived in at this time.\n\nWhat are the Waxhaws?\n\nThe name \"Waxhaws\" was originally given to an Indian tribe that lived in the area who had disappeared before the President’s birth. Later the name was used to designate an area of land in the Carolinas during the Colonial period.\n\nWhere are the Waxhaws?\n\nThe Waxhaws covered an area that is today in both North and South Carolina. The counties of Chester, Lancaster, and York along the Catawba River were part of the Waxhaws. The western edge of the Union County in North Carolina was also part of the Waxhaws.\n\nWhat number President was Andrew Jackson?\n\nJackson was the seventh President of the United States. He became a national figure by winning the Battle of New Orleans against the British in the War of 1812. He was elected President in 1828.\n\nHow long are your trails?\n\nBoth the Garden of the Waxhaws and the Crawford trails are one mile long.\n\nDo you have a swimming area?\n\nNo. Swimming is not permitted at the park. The park lake was designed for fishing and is full of stumps and logs making swimming hazardous.\n\nAre you located on the Catawba River?\n\nNo, the park is not located on the Catawba River. The Catawba River is five miles west of the park on SC Hwy 5. The park has an 18-acre, man-made lake. The campground is located next to this lake.\n\nDo you have a park store?\n\nThe park does not have a park store. Convenience stores are located just beyond the park. There is a small gift shop with educational items located in the park office/museum building.\n\nWhat is the park amphitheater used for?\n\nThe amphitheater is a rental facility that is used in a number of ways. It has hosted weddings, concerts, picnics and performances over the years. When renting the amphitheater, picnic shelter #1 is also included as part of the rental. If you are interested in renting, please contact the park directly.\n\nDoes the park close during the winter?\n\nAndrew Jackson State Park is open year round and offers camping year round.\n\nWhere is the park’s Ultimate Outsider stamp located?\n\nOur Ultimate Outsider stamp is located at the kiosk in the main parking lot. We also have another stamp in the park museum.\n\nWhere can I find a list of state park rules and regulations?\n\nYou can find the South Carolina State Park rules and regulations, along with campground rules and regulations at this link."
