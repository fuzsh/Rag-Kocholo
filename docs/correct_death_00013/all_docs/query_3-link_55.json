        "text": "The Andrew Jackson Hotel is the site of the U.S. Federal Courthouse made famous for fining then-General Andrew Jackson for contempt of court in 1815. Jackson had arrived in New Orleans in December 1814 to bolster the city's defenses against a possible British invasion. He declared martial law against the British as a military defense. Regardless of a great victory against the British at the Battle of New Orleans the following January, Jackson refused to lift the order months afterward. When a senator expressed his unease about the order, Jackson had him arrested. When a judge ruled that the senator be released, Jackson ordered the judge to be held in jail. When Jackson eventually lifted the martial law, the judge returned and charged Jackson with contempt of court to the tune of $1,000, which Jackson paid.\n\nThe Andrew Jackson Hotel is known as one of the most haunted hotels in New Orleans. The property saw its share of misfortunes. Originally home to a boarding school and orphanage for boys who lost their parents to the Yellow Fever epidemic, the site housed a grave tragedy in 1774. Fires that consumed many of the buildings in the French Quarter burned down the orphanage, with five young boys inside. Today, many say the building is haunted, with reports of the ghost of young “Armand,” waking up guests with laughter or pushing them out of the bed. Others report seeing the caretaker of the orphan boys fluffing pillows and cleaning up the rooms, others claim that Andrew Jackson roams the hallways. We invite guests to come and decide on their own if the building really is haunted.\n\nCHECK-IN\n\nCheck-in is at 4:00 pm.
