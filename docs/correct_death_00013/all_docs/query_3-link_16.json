Former linen weavers, Jackson's parents immigrated to the U.S. from northern Ireland in 1765, part of a larger Scotch-Irish trans-Atlantic migration. They established a small log-cabin homestead in Carolina mountain country near Twelve Mile Creek. Andrew Jackson, Sr., died shortly before the birth of his namesake son.
