        "text": "Nashville preservationists are scratching their heads today. Recently a developer sent his demolition crew to lower Broad in the middle of the night. When the sun came up the historic old Trails West building was a dusty pile of bricks. Another old landmark Nashville building is gone. But it’s an old story. The City of Nashville has been twiddling its thumbs for years while loads of wonderful old historic buildings have come down.\n\nOne of the biggest losses came when both the City of Nashville and the State of Tennessee hoed and hummed as the Nashville home of President Polk was demolished in 1901. It started with the last will and testament left by Polk himself. While in Washington D.C., Polk had visited Mt. Vernon, the home of President George Washington and had visited his grave there on the grounds. He was also very familiar with the Hermitage, home and burial place of his mentor, Andrew Jackson. Polk wanted to leave such a legacy to the City of Nashville, where he planned to live after his term as President ended.\n\nPolk, and his wife Sarah, purchased the former home of Felix Grundy, a legal giant in the early days of Tennessee, and a mentor to many promising young attorneys in the state — including Polk. The lovely Palladian home stood on a spur just off the hill where the State Capitol stands today. Polk drew out the changes he wanted made to the home, and the work was done while he was still in the White House. With his term completed, Polk and Sarah took a tour of the South and were greeted by rapturous acclaim. It is believed that while they were in New Orleans that Polk contracted cholera. As their steamboat came north toward Nashville, Polk became more and more ill.\n\nWhen the Polks arrived at Nashville, he was some better as he viewed their new home. A triumphal return to Columbia had already been planned, and they made the trip, but the strain becoming visible in the face of the ex-President. Quite unexpectedly, he died only three months after leaving the White House. He would be buried in a tomb constructed in the yard of their new home — Polk Place.\n\nSarah Polk would stay on in the home for more than 40 years, dying herself in 1891. Polk’s will had been read many years before which bequeathed to her a life estate. The home, according to the will, would go to the State of Tennessee as a shrine. Polk’s will also required that, upon the death of his wife, and the passing of the property to the state, that a “worthy family member,” who carried the last name of Polk would reside there as the caretaker of the home, and curator of Polk’s collection of historical treasures. Polk’s descendants, led by Tasker Polk, the son of Polk’s brother, William Hawkins Polk, sued the estate claiming that Polk was trying to tie the family up from beyond the grave. Both the state and the city of Nashville stood by, and in effect, washed their hands of the property.\n\nTasker Polk and his 55 fellow litigants won the case, broke the will, and put Polk Place on the steps of the courthouse to be auctioned. Felix Grundy’s grandson, Jacob McGavock Dickinson, was the buyer. He paid $22,000 for the property — or about four hundred dollars per litigant, and that was before the lawyers were paid. Dickinson, a big shot local politician, lawyer and judge, wasted no time in having the remains of President James K. Polk and his wife Sarah dug up and moved to the grounds of the state capitol. At least the state did not allow them to be dumped into the Cumberland River.\n\nIn 1901 Dickinson, who had let the old home run down, sold it to developers from New York. They immediately tore it down as the State of Tennessee and the City of Nashville yawned and looked the other way. Apparently they still are. The developers built an apartment complex on the property, and sixty years later that too was torn down.\n\nRight now, at Polk Presidential Hall, the residue of Polk Place has been assembled in one place for you to see. There are photos of the house, along with a set of plans of the property, paintings, and many items that adorned the home. The nice folks at the Polk Home would be glad for you to come by and see all the stuff that has miraculously survived — and there is a lot.\n\nMaury County has a legacy of protecting our homes, heritage and history. Go to the Polk Home and see what wonderful work has been done.\n\n◆◆◆\n\nBob Duncan is director of the Maury County archives. Email him at bduncan@maurycounty-tn.gov."
