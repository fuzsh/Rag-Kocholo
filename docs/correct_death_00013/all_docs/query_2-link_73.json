        "text": "Andrew Jackson’s Hermitage, Nashville (must see)\n\nAndrew Jackson’s Hermitage is a remarkable historical museum situated in Davidson County, Tennessee, just 10 miles east of downtown Nashville. This expansive site, spanning over 1,000 acres, holds great significance as it was once the property of Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States. Jackson owned The Hermitage from 1804 until his passing in 1845, and it also serves as his final resting place. During his lifetime, Jackson resided at the property intermittently and eventually retired from public life there in 1837.\n\nThe history of The Hermitage is intertwined with the labor and contributions of enslaved individuals. When Jackson initially acquired the plantation in 1804, there were nine enslaved men, women, and children present. By the time of Jackson's death, the number had increased to 110. The enslaved individuals played a significant role in the operations of The Hermitage, primarily focused on cultivating cotton, which served as the plantation's major cash crop.\n\nRecognized as a National Historic Landmark, The Hermitage holds immense historical and cultural value. It is not only one of the largest presidential homes in the United States but also one of the most visited. Recently, it earned the distinction of being ranked as the top historic house in Tennessee. Each year, The Hermitage welcomes approximately 200,000 visitors, including 30,000 schoolchildren, hailing from all 50 states and various countries around the world.\n\nExploring the grounds of The Hermitage is a journey through time, with over 30 historic buildings dotting the landscape. Visitors have the opportunity to delve into the life and legacy of Andrew Jackson, gaining insights into his presidential tenure and his personal experiences on the plantation.\n\nDowntown Music and Food\n\nIt seems like everywhere you walk in Nashville, there’s great music coming out of every wall.
