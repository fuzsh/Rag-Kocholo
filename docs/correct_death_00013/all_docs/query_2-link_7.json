        "text": "Born in the wild frontier lands of South Carolina on March 15, 1767, to impoverished Irish immigrant parents, no one could predict Andrew Jackson’s meteoric rise to military and political fame – and eventually the presidency in 1828. Popular with some and polarizing for many, learn all about the life and times of ‘Old Hickory’ in his hometown of Nashville. On your private walking tour, you will:\n\nEnjoy the personal attention of your expert private guide.\n\nLearn about the fascinating life and times of Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States of America, as you walk around his home city of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nBegin your tour at the majestic Hermitage Hotel, and learn about Jackson’s plantation home of the same name just outside of Nashville.\n\nSee the Masonic Grand Lodge of Tennessee and learn about the role of the freemasons in Jackson's life and his opponents.\n\nMarvel at the Downtown Presbyterian Church, with its Egyptian influenced architecture and where Jackson was a member.\n\nWalk around the Tennessee State Capitol, and hear about Jackson’s unlikely meteoric rise from an impoverished orphan, to a lawyer, to a war hero and finally to the president.\n\nHear about his hot-tempered duels as a young lawyer and his military exploits and amazing victories against the British as an untrained General.\n\nTour the Tennessee State Museum with your private guide and its superb collection of Jackson’s artefacts and learn about his divisive public life as ‘the people’s politician’, army general and lawmaker, and how he split off from the Republican Whigs to form the Democratic Party.\n\nLearn about the origins of Jackson’s accumulated wealth: he was a slave owner, with up to 150 slaves on his 1000-acre plantation at any one time.\n\nDeepen your understanding of the origins of American Democracy and the colonization of the lands of the indigenous tribes in relation to Jackson’s politics, which would have ramifications for generations to come.\n\nFinish your tour inside the museum after a guided tour of the highlights, where you are free to explore on your own."
