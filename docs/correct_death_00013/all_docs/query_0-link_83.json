        "text": "The life insurance policy of one of the country’s most infamous assassins, Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and who was then famously killed himself, has sold at auction for nearly $80,000 — far higher than when it was paid out to his mother who filed the death claim.\n\nThe original Notice of Insurance Claim for Oswald sold for $79,436 on Wednesday Boston-based RR Auction said in a statement to the Associated Press.\n\nThe one-page document came inside a frame alongside a photograph of Oswald the AP said and measures 8.5 inches by 10.25 inches having been paid out to Marguerite Oswald for $863.\n\nOswald was shot and killed by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby at the Dallas police headquarters shortly after he was arraigned for the murders of the president and a Dallas police officer, J.D. Tippit, according to History.com.\n\nRuby was found guilty of murdering Oswald and sentence to death, according to the AP, but both his conviction and death sentence were overturned and he died before he could be retried.\n\nThe Proof of Death certificate, signed by Oswald’s mother, is dated Dec. 26, 1963, roughly one month after Ruby killed Oswald, the AP added.\n\nIt was issued by the National Life and Accident Insurance Company of Nashville, Tennessee which also lists Oswald’s name, dates of birth and death, place of death — Dallas— and cause of death — “gunshot wound,” according to the AP.\n\nOswald’s mother maintained her son’s innocence, but came under intense criticism for trying to profit off her son’s death, the AP said.\n\nRelated Content:"
