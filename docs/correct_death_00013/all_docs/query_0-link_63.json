She is not to give away any of the property to one child more than another of the children, they must all share alike. I leave my sister Jane Hammond, the house and lot, where John Garrett Jr now lives with wood for her fire and water from my spring for her use, if she will live on it but if she will not live it returns to the plantation again, when my wife Peggy McMurtry dies or marries the children Henry, John, Asa, Thomas Wilkerson McMurtry, Jennie Garrett, Polly Forrester can divide the land if they can agree about it, if they cannot agree it must be sold with the rest of the property and the money equally divided with the children, if my wife Peggy McMurtry should leave and property at her death it must be sold and the money equally divided amongst the children. Should my wife Peggy McMurtry think she has more property when I die than she wants to keep she can sell it and live on the money.
