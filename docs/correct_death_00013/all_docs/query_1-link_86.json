        "text": "Andrew Jackson, seventh President of the United States, was the dominant actor in American politics between Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. Born to obscure parents and orphaned in youth, he was the first \"self-made man\" and the first westerner to reach the White House. He became a democratic symbol and founder of the Democratic Party, the country's most venerable political organization. During his two-term presidency, he expanded executive powers and transformed the President's role from chief administrator to popular tribune.\n\nAndrew Jackson and the troubled birth of democracy\n\nAuthor H.W. Brands discusses Andrew Jackson and the troubled birth of democracy. Brands is the author of Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times. This lecture was part of the University of Virginia Miller Center's Historical Presidency Series."
