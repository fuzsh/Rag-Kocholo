        "text": "Designing the Right Atmosphere\n\nWith the tomb built, Jackson began landscaping the area around it and restoring the garden that had declined since Rachel’s death. He specifically instructed hickory trees and willows be planted near the tomb.\n\nIn May 1835, Jackson wrote to his son, “How I am delighted to hear that the garden has regained its former appearance, that it always possessed whilst your dear mother was living, and that just attention is now paid to her monument. This is truly pleasing to me, and is precisely as it ought to be.”\n\nJackson returned to The Hermitage at the conclusion of his second term as president in 1837. Jackson visited the tomb daily as long as his health allowed. When unable to visit in person, he could easily see the tomb from his library.\n\nPreserving the Tomb\n\nAt various times from 1865 to 1883, the state carried out much needed repairs to the Jackson tomb. Significant restoration work took place In 1977. On April 16, 1998, a tornado swept across The Hermitage grounds, uprooting or damaging nearly 1,200 trees. The Jackson tomb escaped damage, but the trees surrounding it were destroyed.\n\nNew trees were planted around the tomb shortly after the tornado, and the garden continues to receive landscaping maintenance to preserve what was a very special location for both Andrew and Rachel Jackson."
