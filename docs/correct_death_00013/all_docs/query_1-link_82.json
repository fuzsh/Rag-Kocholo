        "text": "1776 Â· The Declaration to the King\n\n\"\"\"At the end of the Second Continental Congress the 13 colonies came together to petition independence from King George III. With no opposing votes, the Declaration of Independence was drafted and ready for all delegates to sign on the Fourth of July 1776. While many think the Declaration was to tell the King that they were becoming independent, its true purpose was to be a formal explanation of why the Congress voted together to declare their independence from Britain. The Declaration also is home to one of the best-known sentences in the English language, stating, âWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\n1788 Â· The First Presidential Election\n\nThe First Presidential election was held in the newly created United States of America. Under the Articles of Confederation, the executive branch of the country was not set up for an individual to help lead the nation. So, under the United States Constitution they position was put in. Because of his prominent roles during the Revolutionary War, George Washington was voted in unanimously as the First President of the United States."
