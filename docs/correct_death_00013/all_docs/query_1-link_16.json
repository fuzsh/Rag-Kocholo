        "text": "Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was a risk taker. He was relatively new on the frontier in Middle Tennessee in 1806, but he had already made a name for himself as a lawyer and the owner of race horses.\n\nHe had married Rachel Donelson, and settled on a fine farm located along the Cumberland River east of Nashville. He called his farm the “Hermitage.” Nearby was a horse race track at Clover Bottom where the Stones River flowed into the Cumberland.\n\nIt was here that many celebrated races took place in the early days of the state. Jackson quickly demonstrated that he had an eye for horses, and he paid top dollar for the best. He also was known to make huge wagers on the races, and some cast a jealous eye upon his many victories.\n\nJackson styled himself a gentleman, and fiercely guarded his personal honor. Although his volcanic temper was little understood by his neighbors, they all knew that he was not a man to bluff. He made enemies readily, and some had learned to warmly hate him. And yet he was imperturbable and did not care what people thought of him. What they said about him was another matter.\n\nHe experienced difficulties with some of his horse racing associates, and bitter words were exchanged. He refused one duel, saying that his opposite was no gentleman, but that he would be more than happy to just shoot it out with him. The man thought better of the offer and pulled in his horns.\n\nThere was one man, however, who was not afraid to duel with Jackson and he did consider himself to be a gentleman. His name was Charles Dickinson, and he was reputed to be a dead shot with a pistol. Rumor had it that Dickinson had fought twenty-six duels in his young life, and when he took the side of Jackson’s enemies it was a serious matter.\n\nDickinson approached Jackson in Nashville, handed him his card, and accused Jackson of being “an equivocator and a coward,” and challenged him to a duel. For Jackson, “them was fightin’ words.” But before he could respond, Dickinson left town for a trip to New Orleans. All that Jackson could do was wait and simmer until his return.\n\nDickinson returned to Nashville in May of 1806 (just before Maury became a county) and the two antagonists established a date, May 30th, a time, 7:00 A.M., and a place. It was illegal to duel in the State of Tennessee, but not in Kentucky. They agreed to meet just across the state line, a bit to the west of Adairsville, Ken. Dickinson was something of a braggart, and he supposedly left the targets of some of his fancy shooting on the road to Kentucky for Jackson to see.\n\nAt 7:00 AM, May 30, 1806 Jackson and Dickinson met in a river bottom in the edge of Kentucky. Jackson, as the challenger, brought the pistols — 70 caliber hand cannons that could have knocked down a Buffalo. Dickinson, as the challengee, got his pick of the two pistols. The men took their marks, 24 feet apart.\n\nThey took aim, and waited for the call to fire. Jackson knew Dickinson’s reputation as a marksman, and he had decided to allow him to go first. Jackson had said something to the effect that he was sure that he could hit Dickinson “even if he blows my brains out.” Dickinson was not aiming for Jackson’s head, but rather he intended to shoot Jackson in the heart.\n\nThe call to fire came and Dickinson fired quickly. The round struck Jackson’s thin frame right next to his heart, but the bullet was deflected by his ribs, a couple of which were broken.\n\nEven with such a lethal strike, when the smoke cleared Jackson was still standing with his pistol aimed at Dickinson, who cried out, “My God! Have I missed him?” The seconds ordered Dickinson to stand still, and he did. Jackson took careful aim and shot him in the abdomen, ripping his insides to shreds. Dickinson would die the next day in terrible pain.\n\nJackson held himself rigidly upright by force of will, but he was losing blood. The shot had missed his heart thanks to his narrow chest, but Jackson would carry the bullet the rest of his life. He was taken by his friends back to the Hermitage, where he recuperated for over a month, and really never did completely recover from the wound.\n\nIf Jackson were alive today and still the President of the United States he would most certainly feel duty bound to shoot the whole Congress and the entire Washington press corps. It makes me nostalgic just to think about it.\n\n◆◆◆\n\nBob Duncan is director of the Maury County archives. Email him at bduncan@maurycounty-tn.gov."
