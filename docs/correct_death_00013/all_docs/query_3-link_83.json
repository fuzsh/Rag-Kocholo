        "text": "Although no Civil War battles were fought here, the war touched Andrew Jackson's farm in other ways. Jackson had been a firm Unionist, putting down Nullification and its potential for civil war during his presidency. However, after his death, his adopted son Andrew Jackson Jr. and his wife, Sarah, supported the South. When Tennessee seceded, the president's grandsons joined the Confederate army, as did two of Sarah Jackson's nephews who also were reared here. Three of the young men died, and Andrew Jackson III was taken prisoner twice. Soldiers on the Lebanon Turnpike and others foraging for supplies took livestock and caused various kinds of damage at The Hermitage."
