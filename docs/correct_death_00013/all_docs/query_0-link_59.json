[Source: Carroll County NEWS-LEADER]\n\nCelebrating the Life of Clara King\n\n\"Simply thank God that your salvation and the eternal destiny of others is tip to Him --relax, be happy and your sense of security, peace and joy will rub off on others.\" This was one of several notes handwritten by Clara within the leaflets of her Bible, one that she truly believed in and lived her life by daily. Always seeing the good within people, Clara's Christian love for the Lord, her family and friends, brilliantly radiated as she lived everyday to the fullest, celebrating her gift of life and blessing those of whom she came into contact.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nThe world became a better place when Clara Louise was born to Alma Odelle and Delmar Ras Smothers in Westport, Tennessee. The first child and only daughter, Clara has two younger brothers, Lyndel Eugene and the late Sherrell Clark. Accepting the Lord as her Savior at an early age, Clara was baptized at Pond Branch and attended the Westport Baptist Church. She and her family then moved to Bruceton in 1948 and her \"true-blue\" Tiger Pride was born as she began her Freshman year at CenÂ­tral High School. CHS holds many wonderful memories for Clara and her family. Not only was she a 1952 graduate, but her mother was also a CHS graduate, as well as her three children and two of her grandchilÂ­dren--a total of four generations proudly sang the Tiger Alma Mater that was co-written by her mother.\n\nShortly after Clara began her Freshman year at CHS, she won the heart of Central's star athlete and renown football legend, Robert Murrell King. Clara was Murrell's biggest fan and savored their wonderful memories of high school. She could quote game highlights, scores and records that Murrell had set at CHS and also at Murray State University where he was a member of the track team. Clara, being the modest perÂ­son she was, talked very little about her accomplishments, but she was also a star athlete and very active during her high school years. She was selected Most Athletic during her senior year in 1952. She played basÂ­ketball four years and served as team captain. In addition, Clara was a majorette for the CHS marching hand, class officer, football maid, and was a member of several organizations including 4-H, FHA, Pep Club, Glee Club and the Office Staff. She was also selected as the representaÂ­tive for Daughters of American Revolution, a very prestigious honor.\n\nStarting a Family\n\nClara and Murrell's 49-year marriage began on February 19, 1954, when they were wed at Prospect Baptist Church in Hollow Rock. The happy couple was blessed with their first child and only daughter, Elissa Ann, on June 4, 1955. On April 6, 1958, Clara gave birth to twin boys, Michael Clark and Mark Foust. Their children were their pride and joy and they were first and foremost in their lives. As with Clara and Murrell, Tiger Pride was deeply instilled within their children at an early age. All three were excellent athletes and Clara and Murrell never missed a sporting event. They are also the proud grandparents of five grandchildren: Brooke, Robert, Drew, Laura and Jenna.\n\nProfessional Career & Community Services\n\nIn addition to raising a family, Clara successfully juggled a rewarding career while maintaining active involvement within her community and church, always striving to make a difference and speaking up for what she believed. Not only was Clara a licensed cosmetologist, but she worked as a certified dietary manager for over 30 years. She served as dietary director of the Central High School cafeteria, dietary manager at the nursing homes in both Bruceton and Camden, and she retired in 1995 as director of Food Service at Baptist Memorial Hospital-Huntingdon.\n\nClara was happiest when she was serving the Lord. She loved her church and consistently remained involved and loyal. She served many years as the Girls Auxiliary director and taught Sunday School for over 30 years. She was on the Bond Committee for the First Baptist Church of Bruceton during it's construction in the early 1970s when she first became a member.\n\nClara's other community involvement included serving on the Hollow Rock-Bruceton School Board for two terms, a total of eight years, she is a past Worthy Matron of the Eastern Stars ADAH Chapter 314, and she has been an active member of the Carroll County Republican Executive Committee for many years.\n\nClara will be truly missed and remembered by all of her family and friends, and by all of the many people whose lives she has touched.\n\n\"Each night we are one day closer to eternity-one day nearer\n\nHeaven! What a wonderful joy to know!\"\n\n-A handwritten note by Clara found in the leaflet of her Bible"
