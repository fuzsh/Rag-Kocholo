He left the network to become an independent cameraman and correspondent, eventually filing reports jointly to NBC News, CBC and London's Observer newspaper.

In 1989 Kent joined NBC News as the network's Rome Correspondent, and won back to back Emmy Awards for his part in the network's coverage of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre and the December, 1989 Romanian Revolution.

His 1997 book Risk and Redemption: Surviving the Network News Wars documents the turbulent period in U.S. broadcast news from the Soviet war in Afghanistan, through the collapse of Communism and the first Gulf War, to the bloody conflict in Bosnia.

Kent returned to Canada to host CBC Television's weekly documentary series, Man Alive, and later established his own production company, Fast Forward Films, in the UK.

His work has appeared on the BBC, CNN and PBS. Kent's film Afghanistan: Captives of the Warlords explored life in under the repressive Taliban regime. First broadcast nationally by PBS in June of 2001, an updated version received extensive broadcast on PBS and CBC following the September 11 attacks. The documentary received the Gold WorldMedal at the New York festivals and a Golden Eagle award from CINE.

From 1998 through 2004 Kent hosted and produced documentaries for two series on A&E's History Channel: History Undercover and History's Mysteries.
