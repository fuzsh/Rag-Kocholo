        "text": "I, Ardella, passed away on January 23, 2018, in Alexandria, Minnesota. I was born on November 26, 1924, to Paul and Louina (Schuhmacher) Neumann at the family farm in Leven Township near Villard. I already had two sisters: Marjorie and Eula.\n\nMy school days were all in Villard, graduating from Villard High School in 1942. I then attended Minneapolis Business College. I worked various places in Alexandria and Glenwood.\n\nOn August 30, 1946, I was united in marriage to Warren (Andy) Andert who was soon to be done with his six year tour with the U.S. Navy.\n\nWe lived in many different places in Minnesota as Andy continued his education. After he graduated from St. Cloud State Teachers College we moved to Swanville, Browns Valley and Silver Bay where Andy taught. Summers were ALWAYS spent at our cabin on Lake Villard.\n\nTwo sons were born to Andy and I. Both were avid hunters, fishermen, and golfers with their Dad. I always had the cooking pots full on the back burners. I loved to cook!! My two sons were Thomas Warren who lived in Brandon, MN and Michael George who lived near Charlotte, NC.\n\nOur family lived in Canby, MN from 1960-1981. I spent twenty years working for the school system there mostly as elementary secretary.\n\nAfter Canby, Andy and I spent most of our life at the cabin on Lake Villard, eventually making it our home. Many, many happy days were spent there. I spent many hours planting my flowers and just being outside. Andy and I took several trips and just enjoyed being with each other. We loved following our grandchildren and attending all their activities.\n\nAfter 67 years of marriage Andy passed away. He took part of me with him, cause it was just never the same without him. I leave to mourn my two sons: Thomas (Linda), Michael (Jeanne); four grandchildren: Amy (Tom) Caruthers, Sara (Jeff) Rowland, Evan (Katrina) Andert, Kylie (Harrison) Conkin; two great grandchildren: Hayden & Brooke. As well as many wonderful relatives and friends.\n\nVisitation will be held on Monday, January 29, 2018, 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m. at St. Johns Church in Villard followed by the Memorial service at 11:00 a.m. Burial will be at the church cemetery. In Lieu of flowers memorial are preferred to family's favorite charity or St. John's Lutheran Church."
