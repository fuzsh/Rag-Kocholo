        "text": "Ancestors Descendants\n\nProfile last modified 26 Jul 2021 | Created 16 Jan 2016\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,735 times.\n\nBiography\n\nEllen was known by the family as 'Nellie'.\n\n1881 - Ellen Rebecca Nash was born at home at 121 Vauxhall Walk, Lambeth on 3rd Feb 1881. Father Walter Henry Nash, occupation wood sawyer. Mother Mary Ann Nash of 121 Vauxhall Walk. [1]\n\n1881 census has her at 2mths of age living with her parents and siblings at Vauxhall Walk.\n\n1891 census has her 10yrs of age living with her parents and siblings at Vauxhall Walk.\n\n1901 census has her 20yrs of age living with her parents and siblings at Walnut Tree Walk.\n\nSome time between 1901 & 1907 the family moved to 120 Newington Butts which is the address of \"Nash's Laundry\" owned by her mother Mary Nash, and later, parents Mary and Walter Nash and youngest daughter Kathleen Marie moved to Brighton Sussex. Ellen carried on the lease on 120 Newington Butts and continued to manage \"Nash's Laundry' from that address.\n\n1908 - 31st May - death of mother Mary Ann (Scanlon) Nash at Chichester Infirmary Sussex. Ellen was bequeathed 50 pounds in her mother's will.\n\n1911 census has her age 30yrs as head of house, living with sisters Beatrice and Ethel, and brother Tom at 120 Newington Butts. (Father Walter Henry Nash and youngest child Kathleen remained in Brighton in 1911).\n\n1911 May 13, brother Thomas Robert Nash migrated to Canada under the name of Robert Kelvin Nash.\n\n1913 - 2nd February Ellen aged 32, married Charles F Merrell aged 34, linotype operator of 20 Fentiman Rd, at Parish Church Kennington London. Her father named as Walter Henry Nash coach builder, and Charles's father James Merrell machine manager. The witnesses were her sister Beatrice, father Walter (or possibly her brother Walter) and Charles brother Thomas Merrell. They started their married life living at 120 Newington Butts. [2]\n\n1913 - August sister Beatrice Louise left 120 Newington Butts to join their brother John Stephen Nash in New Zealand.\n\n1913 - October - birth of first son Kenrick Charles Merrell at Lambeth London.\n\n1913 - 8th December death of her father Walter Henry Nash of 23 Tillstone Street Brighton. Ellen was bequeathed the piano, and 30 pounds in her father's will.\n\n1925 - Birth of 2nd son Peter Anthony J Merrell at Lambeth London.\n\n1929 Electoral Roll has Ellen Rebecca & Charles Frederick Merrell living at 67 Alderbrook Road, Balham. (This is the address of \"The Devonshire Laundry\" owned by Ellen).\n\n2021 view of 67 Alderbrook Road\n\n1939 Electoral Roll has Ellen Rebecca & Charles Frederick Merrell registered to vote at 120 Newington Butts, but states their 'abode' is 67 Alderbrook Road.\n\n1939 Register - this was a census taken just after the start of WW2, it presumably assisted with estimating missing people due to the bombing, and was later used to issue ration books.\n\n1939 Register has Ellen and Charles living at 67 Alderbrook Road. [3]\n\n1939 Register details for 120 Newington Butts shows Thomas G and Jane A Merrell (Charles's 2 older siblings).[4]\n\n1939 Register details for 209 Newington Butts shows a Lilian Hall - stockroom assistant, and Lily Brendan? - laundry receiving office manageress. So presumably this property leased by Ellen is being used as a stockroom/delivery/collection point for Nash's Laundry and The Devonshire Laundry. [5]\n\n1939 Register details for 211 Newington Butts has an Alfred Wells, boot repairer, own account. So presumably Ellen is sub-letting this property to Mr Wells. [6]\n\n1939 Register details show son Peter Anthony Merrell (age about 13yrs) is living in Brighton with his uncle Rowland Henry Nash & aunt Edith, presumably to keep him safe from the London Blitz. see profile of Rowland Henry Nash for register copy.\n\n1943 - 23 October Ellen Rebecca (Nash) Merrell aged 62years, died of kidney disease at home Alderbrook Road, Wandsworth, London, England. [7]\n\nNellie's will shows that she owned \"The Devonshire Laundry\" at 67 Alderbrook Road Balham, the laundry known as \"Nash's Laundry\" at 120 Newington Butts and at 211 Newington Butts, and 209 Newington Butts. These properties were all leasehold.
