        "text": "Founder of the Pillar of Fire Church\n\nAlma Bridwell White (June 16, 1862 – June 26, 1946) was the founder and a bishop of the Pillar of Fire Church.[1][2][3][4] In 1918, she became the first woman bishop of Pillar of Fire in the United States.[2][5] She was a proponent of feminism. She also associated herself with the Ku Klux Klan and was involved in anti-Catholicism, antisemitism, anti-Pentecostalism, racism, and hostility to immigrants.[6][4] By the time of her death at age 84, she had expanded the sect to \"4,000 followers, 61 churches, seven schools, ten periodicals and two broadcasting stations.\"[5][4]\n\nBirth and early years\n\n[edit]\n\nShe was born Mollie Alma Bridwell on June 16, 1862, in Kinniconick, Kentucky, to William Moncure Bridwell of Virginia and Mary Ann Harrison of Kentucky.[7] She was the seventh of eleven children.\n\nWilliam Baxter Godbey converted her at the age of 16 to Wesleyan Methodism in a Kentucky schoolhouse revival meeting in 1878.[8] She wrote that \"some were so convicted that they left the room and threw up their suppers, and staggered back into the house as pale as death.\"[9] By 1880, the family was living in Millersburg, Kentucky.[10]\n\nShe studied at the Millersburg Female College in Millersburg. An aunt invited one of the seven Bridwell sisters to visit Montana Territory. All of them were afraid to make the journey, except for Alma, the aunt's last choice. In 1882, nineteen-year-old Alma traveled to Bannack, Montana. She stayed to teach, first in public school, and later in Salt Lake City's Methodist seminary. On December 21, 1887, she married Kent White (1860–1940), who at the time was a Methodist seminarian. They had two sons, Ray Bridwell White and Arthur Kent White.[11]\n\nChurch founder\n\n[edit]\n\nAlma and Kent White started the Methodist Pentecostal Union Church in Denver, Colorado, in December 1901. She led hymns and prayers, and at times preached sermons. In 1907, Caroline Garretson (formerly Carolin Van Neste Field), widow of Peter Workman Garretson, donated a farm for a religious community at Zarephath, New Jersey.\n\nThis was developed as the headquarters for the renamed Pillar of Fire Church, which distanced itself from the Pentecostal movement. In 1918, White was consecrated as a bishop by William Baxter Godbey, an ordained Methodist evangelist who was active in the Holiness Movement.[8][12][13] She was now the first woman to serve as a bishop in the United States.[2]\n\nFeminism, intolerance, and the Klan\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a feminist, White was a forceful advocate of equality for white Protestant women. However, she was also uncompromising in her persistent and powerful attacks on religious and racial minorities, justifying both equality for white Protestant women and inequality for minorities as biblically mandated. While the vast majority of her most vicious political attacks targeted the Roman Catholic Church, she also promoted antisemitism, white supremacy, and intolerance of certain immigrants.[6]\n\nUnder White's leadership in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pillar of Fire Church developed a close and public partnership with the Ku Klux Klan that was unique for a religious denomination.[14] She assessed the Klan as a powerful force that could help liberate white Protestant women, while simultaneously keeping minorities in their place.[6] Her support of the Klan was extensive.[6][14][15][16] She allowed and sometimes participated in Klan meetings and cross burnings on some of the numerous Pillar of Fire properties. She published The Good Citizen, a monthly periodical which strongly promoted the Klan and its agenda. Additionally, she published three books, The Ku Klux Klan in Prophecy, Klansmen: Guardians of Liberty, and Heroes of the Fiery Cross, which were compendiums of the essays, speeches and cartoons that had originally been published in The Good Citizen.\n\nWhite expressed her racism against African Americans most vocally when speaking at Klan gatherings. On \"Patriotic Day\" at the 1929 annual Camp Meeting at Zarephath, New Jersey, she preached a sermon titled \"America—the White Man's Heritage\", and published the sermon in that month's edition of The Good Citizen. She said:\n\nWhere people seek for social equality between the black and white races, they violate the edicts of the Holy Writ and every social and moral code ...\n\nSocial and political equality would plunge the world into an Inferno as black as the regions of night and as far from the teachings of the New Testament as heaven is from hell. The presumption of the colored people under such conditions would know no bounds ...\n\nThis is white man's country by every law of God and man, and was so determined from the beginning of Creation. Let us not therefore surrender our heritage to the sons of Ham. Perhaps it would be well for white people to take the advice of a great American patriot, Dr. Hiram Wesley Evans and repeal the Fifteenth Amendment. The editor of The Good Citizen would be with him in this.[18][19]\n\nWhite's association with the Klan waned in the early 1930s, after the Klan underwent public scandals related to high-level officials and efforts by the media to publicize its members' identities. Still, she continued to promote her ideology of intolerance for religious and racial minorities. She published revised versions of her three Klan books in 1943, three years before her death and 22 years after her initial public association with the Klan. The books were published as a three-volume set under the name Guardians of Liberty. Notably, the word Klansmen was removed from the title, reflecting the Klan's diminished status, while White continued to promote the dogma that had initially drawn her into partnership with the Klan. Volumes Two and Three of Guardians of Liberty have introductions by Arthur Kent White, her son and the Pillar of Fire's second general superintendent.\n\nRivalry\n\n[edit]\n\nTime magazine wrote on October 22, 1928:\n\nAimee Semple McPherson [spoke] ... Worst of all, there came a rival female evangelist from New Jersey, a resolute woman with the mien of an inspired laundress — the Reverend \"Bishop\" Mrs. Mollie Alma White, founder and primate of the Pillar of Fire Church. Bishop White, who has thousands of disciples (\"Holy Jumpers\") in the British Isles, clearly regarded Mrs. McPherson as a poacher upon her preserves or worse. Squired by two male Deacons, the Reverend Bishop sat herself down in a box at Albert Hall, with an air of purposing to break up the revival. The dread potency of Bishop White, when aroused against another female, may be judged from her scathing criticisms of the Church of Mary Baker Eddy: \"The teachings of the so-called Christian Science Church ... have drawn multitudes from the orthodox faith, and blasted their hopes of heaven! ... A person who is thus in the grip of Satanic power is unable to extricate himself ... [and is] left in utter spiritual desolation.\" Well might buxom Aimee McPherson have quailed as she faced 2,000 tepid Britons, over 8,000 empty seats, the two Deacons and \"Bishop\" Mrs. White.[20]\n\nRadio stations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1927, a transmitter and radio equipment were installed at Belleview College in Westminster, Colorado, to promote the college based in the Westminster Castle. By June 1929, the call letters had been changed to KPOF and the station was broadcasting regular sermons from Alma Temple, the Pillar's Denver Church. In March 1931, WBNY was sold to White and the Pillar of Fire Church for $5,000. The call letters were changed to WAWZ (the letters standing for Alma White, Zarephath). In its initial broadcast, she told listeners, \"The station belongs to all regardless of your affiliation.\"[2] In 1961, Pillar of Fire also started WAKW in Cincinnati. The AKW represents the name of Arthur Kent White, Alma's son.\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nShe died on June 26, 1946, in Zarephath, New Jersey.[1][5]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nAlma White, the Pillar of Fire, and their association with the Klan are dramatized in Libba Bray's 2012 murder mystery The Diviners, in a chapter titled \"The Good Citizen\".\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nPublications\n\n[edit]\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nPillar of Fire, November 25, 1914\n\nThe Good Citizen, July 1926\n\nAlma White at various ages\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nKu Klux Klan in New Jersey\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nBlee, Kathleen M.
