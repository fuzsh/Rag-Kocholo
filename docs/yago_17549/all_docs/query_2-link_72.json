        "text": "Sundays are always work days for Kent Tritle, arguably the busiest choirmaster in the city, but his commitments hit a crescendo from Thanksgiving to Christmas. Mr. Tritle, 51, is in his first season as music director and organist at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, which has its annual “Cathedral Christmas” concert on Saturday. He is also music director of Musica Sacra and the Oratorio Society of New York and organist for the New York Philharmonic, and has a Sunday program, “The Choral Mix With Kent Tritle,” on WQXR-FM. He lives on the Cathedral Close with his partner, Arthur Fiacco, 56, a cellist; two cats; and a Moluccan cockatoo, Precious. The couple also have a 1906 cottage in Cragsmoor, in the Catskills.\n\nCATS, COFFEE, COCKATOO On Sundays, I’m the one who gets up at 6. Arthur stays in bed because he’s probably had a late performance Saturday night. The cats are waiting right outside the door, so I feed them first thing, then I turn on the coffee machine and retrieve Precious from her night cage, in a closet, and she sits on my shoulder while I drink my coffee. I crack open my datebook and get my priorities in order for the day. Then I make a move to shave and shower, and Precious — we may be a couple of gay guys, but no, we didn’t name her — comes with me; she loves that rain-forest experience."
