        "text": "Spring 2010\n\nFollowing the viral effect of Virtual Choir 1.0 “Lux Aurumque“, Eric agreed to create a new Virtual Choir for 2011 and chose his piece 'Sleep'. VC 1 receives print, radio at TV coverage across the world.\n\nSummer 2010\n\nEric recorded the video of him conducing Sleep and then added a piano track. Meanwhile, the team at Decca built a YouTube page.\n\nSeptember 2010\n\nSeptember 22nd, 2010\n\nThe project was launched with a blog post from Eric - \"Here we go, gang. For the next version of the Virtual Choir we will sing Sleep, and this time around, we're shooting for the Guinness title of world's largest internet choir. We'll need at least 900 singers, so all of you are invited. Any age is welcome.\"\n\nSeptember 23rd, 2010\n\nWithin just a few hours of launch the first three entries had been uploaded to YouTube - two from the USA (Courtney Kayser and Hannah Reeves) and one from Portugal (Pedro Latas). Meanwhile, Eric's new CD 'Light & Gold' was launched in London and the Virtual Choir became a front-page feature on YouTube UK.\n\nSeptember 25th, 2010\n\nTony Piper, a singer (and IT consultant) from London decided to spend a few hours building a web-based system to find the VC entries so he could see how the Virtual Choir was going. He sent a link to Claire Long (Eric's Manager), thinking that Eric might find it useful too.\n\nSeptember 29th, 2010\n\nA VC fan from Singapore cut together a video featuring just four of the first few singers. It was beautiful to watch and we all began to dream about what it would be like with 900 singers taking part.\n\nOctober 2010\n\nOctober 6th, 2010\n\nThe Virtual Choir Earth View was launched, using the brand-new Google Earth web browser plugin to show the location of singers around the world. Each video had to be added by hand but it was worth the effort to see this global project unfold.\n\nOctober 7th, 2010\n\nTony's system had found 59 entries, and he created a montage of thumbnails from the videos.\n\nOctober 18th, 2010\n\nOur first big milestone - 100 videos and another excuse to publish a montage. It was really fun to see people tagging themselves in the picture on Facebook.\n\nOctober 28th, 2010\n\nLight & Gold reached #1 in the US on the Billboard Charts. This, in turn, generated lots more interest in the Virtual Choir. Meanwhile, Eric was settling into his new role as Visiting Fellow at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge University, UK.\n\nNovember 2010\n\nNovember 12th, 2010\n\nOver 11,000 people had downloaded the music and we had found 160 videos. It was time to start encouraging people to take the bold step to record and upload their performance.\n\nNovember, 20th-22nd, 2010\n\nWe decided to hold a Virtual Choir party weekend and Eric and the rest of the team helped a number of Cambridge University Choral Scholars record and upload their performance. Remarkably, most of them recorded in just one take and despite a few technical difficulties we got a total of 22 videos which was a significant increase in numbers.\n\nDecember 2010\n\nDecember 1st, 2010\n\nWith just a month to go before the closing deadline we had nearly 300 videos - already the Virtual Choir was going to be bigger than the Lux Aurumque project but 900 videos was a huge number and we had no way of knowing if we would reach our goal. All we could do is to continue to encourage and support singers on the VC Facebook page, and encourage those who had already taken part to help others.\n\nDecember 24th, 2010\n\nIt was the night before Christmas and we had reached 500 vidoes. An incredible number, but still way short of the goal with just a week to go.\n\nDecember 25th, 2010\n\nChristmas Day, but still a working day for Team Whitacre and VC singers. The upload rate starts to increase as people find some spare time.\n\nDecember 29th, 2010\n\nHeavy snow hit Europe and the US, disrupting travel plans for many people who wanted to take part in the VC. In the few days after Christmas we were up to 800 entries and no longer concerned about meeting our goal. But, really wanting to include those people who were going to miss the deadline due to the bad weather, we decided to allow a few late entries up until 10th January.\n\nDecember 31st, 2010\n\nDeadline day! We received a video featuring a 9 year old girl, Georgina from the UK. Her singing is simply beautiful and we couldn't resist sharing her video with everyone (with her and her mother's consent). The feedback was incredible - several people who had been procrastinating decided that she was the inspiration they needed to record and upload their performance. The Facebook group became very busy with lots of contributors trying to get their video uploaded before the original deadline.\n\nJanuary 2011\n\nJanuary 1st, 2011\n\nBecause this was a global project we needed to honour global time zones, so the official close for entries was 09:59 GMT on January 1st which was 23:59 in Western Samoa. Tony's system did another sweep and we declared a total of 1098 uploads from 47 countries, beating our original target by a comfortable margin! We were astounded by the number of countries represented. The system started to download all the videos from YouTube.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 2011\n\n1160 videos, with 7 days to go until the extended deadline. Meanwhile, Tony Piper is running lots of cross-checks to make sure he's found all the videos and Tony Silvestri (who wrote the poem Sleep) recorded and uploaded his contribution.\n\nJanuary 6th, 2011\n\n1256 videos from 50 countries. We decided to publish a list of videos and names so that everyone could check we had found them. Needless to say, this generated lots of enquiries as singers realised they needed to follow our instructions exactly otherwise their videos would not be found and included.\n\nJanuary 8th, 2011\n\n1358 videos from 52 countries. How many more could there be? Using data from the system, VC member Chris Clement created a graph of the number of submissions over time - it was a classic Hockey Stick (or 'procrastination' curve).\n\nJanuary 10th, 2011\n\nThis was the end of the deadline extension and our initial count was 1987 videos from 55 countries, more than doubling our original goal. Our last upload was just a few minutes before the deadline (but wasn't from Western Samoa).\n\nJanuary 11th, 2011\n\nThe technical cross-checking continues. Meanwhile, we asked all the participants to check we had found their entries, giving them until 23:59 Western Samoa time on January 17th. Over the week more videos were found (they had been incorrectly tagged or titled). At the same time, we had to reverse geocode each entry so that we had a country for everyone. In some cases we had to get the country from the YouTube profile or the description on the video. Also, we extracted the singers names from the descriptions ready for use in the title sequence.\n\nJanuary 18th, 2011\n\nAfter checking, checking and checking some more we declared our final total - 2052 videos from 58 countries. One more video downloading task was run and the video files were then processed to extract the audio. A hard disk containing all the videos (about 50GB, compressed) was sent to rehabstudio and a hard disk containing all the audio files (about 5GB, compressed) was sent to Floating Earth.\n\nJanuary - March, 2011\n\nrehabstudio created the concept/storyboard and appointed Cake TV to concentrate on the look and direction of the video, developing the idea of the network/planetary system. Storyboards were approved by Eric/Claire and Decca and a web resource was created for all team members to see ideas and media uploaded, to comment and approve on a frequent basis. Having approved the storyboards, the \"animatic\" was created using a simple sketch animation to determine the pacing and cinematography for the final element. Adobe After Effects was used to control all the elements in a 3D space and add camera angles to the scenes. A small number of video tracks had to be set aside due to technical errors in the media. The videos were checked for format and resized and synced to ensure smooth integration with the globes, which were built using mathematical expressions in After Effects. Each globe was then individually rendered.\n\nMeantime, at Floating Earth the audio files were worked on week by week. Every audio track was individually synced to the conductor track using Pyramix DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and monitored on B & W loudspeakers. Craig Jenkins at Floating Earth created the whole choir sound working with Eric and Claire, as several other sound engineers worked on the multiple audio files to draw the whole choir together. A very small number of audio tracks were discarded due to technical errors in recording or upload. The final mix had noise reduction applied (to remove background noises such as doorbells, ringing phones, birds, aircraft and crickets), was equalized, compressed and finally reverb was added.\n\nClaire liaised with rehabstudio, Cake and Floating Earth on a daily basis, passing each stage through to Eric for approval.\n\nThe final audio was prepared and the final creative was approved; Tony then worked with rehab and Cake on sync issues and final tweaks.\n\nThe final video render took several days. it was a very nervous time!\n\nMarch 1st, 2011\n\nEric addressed the TED conference and as well as telling them the story of the Virtual Choir he gave the global audience a preview of Sleep. He (and the choir) got two standing ovations - testimony to the power of the internet to connect people of all backgrounds and abilities and create something beautiful across time and space.\n\nApril 7th, 2011"
