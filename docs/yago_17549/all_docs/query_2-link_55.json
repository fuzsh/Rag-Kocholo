        "text": "EXPLOSIONS AND THE ACRID smell of war still haunt the CNN anchor Bernard Shaw. Baghdad, once Bob Simon's dreaded prison, is now familiar turf for him as a CBS correspondent. And after virtually vanishing from American television screens, Arthur Kent, formerly of NBC, is now reporting for CNN.\n\nFive years after the end of the Persian Gulf war, the television correspondents whose familiar faces brought the 43-day conflict into living rooms across the country hold varied memories from -- and find myriad lessons in -- a war that propelled them in different directions afterward.\n\nPeter Arnett and Christiane Amanpour of CNN have hopscotched from one hot spot to the next: Russia, Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. Forrest Sawyer of ABC and Wolf Blitzer of CNN are now anchors of news magazines or political programs in addition to their reporting duties. Some correspondents, including Mr. Arnett, have written books about their war experiences and have been transformed into television personalities.\n\nBrief as it was, the gulf war was the first major conflict involving American troops since Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier. As such, it stamped an indelible mark in the passports of aspiring and veteran correspondents alike and ignited a running debate between the news media and the military over war coverage.\n\n\"Baghdad was clearly the most exciting story I covered,\" said Mr. Arnett, who has covered 17 wars in a 35-year career that has spanned the extremes of journalism, from the news-service world to the 24-hour realm of CNN. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his work as an Associated Press reporter in Vietnam.\n\n\"If we'd had the immediacy in Vietnam that we had in the gulf war, it would have changed history,\" said Mr. Arnett, 61, who was the only Western correspondent in Baghdad for most of the war. \"The Vietnam War could not have lasted as long as it did.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
