        "text": "The 2024-5 NFL season has begun with preseason football already underway. While teams and players ready themselves for the official start of the regular NFL season, fans can gear up to watch all the terrific football ahead this season thanks to Sling TV. The live TV streamer is offering massive savings on subscriptions via the Sling TV Season Pass when you prepay for four months of service.\n\nThe discounted Sling TV Season Pass is comprised of the streamer's Orange + Blue tier and the Sports Extra plan which includes 18 additional sports-centric channels. Because Sling TV carries the live feed of most local network affiliates, you'll be able to watch \"Sunday Night Football\" on NBC, Sunday football on Fox, and \"Monday Night Football\" on ESPN and ABC, all without paying hefty cable subscription pricing. The package also includes popular cable channels such as TNT, TBS, Bravo and CNN, as well as specialized sports channels like Golf Channel, MLB Network, SEC Network, Big Ten Network and more.\n\nTo take advantage of this killer discount and watch the NFL this season, get the Sling TV Season Pass by prepaying for four months of the Orange + Blue tier plus Sports Extra plan. You'll pay $219 in total, reduced from $300.\n\nNote: Because Sling TV does not carry CBS, Sling TV subscribers will want to get the Paramount+ add-on to watch CBS-aired Sunday football games.\n\nCBS Essentials and Paramount+ are both subsidiaries of Paramount Global.\n\n2024-5 NFL season: Key dates, streaming-exclusive games\n\nNow that you're set to watch NFL football this season with the Sling TV Season Pass, you'll want to know when and how to watch every game of the NFL season.\n\n2024-5 NFL season: Key dates\n\nThe 2024-5 NFL preseason began on Thursday, Aug. 1, 2024, when the Chicago Bears faced the Houston Texans Hall of Fame game.

The NFL schedule includes two Christmas Day games, one Friday game, one Black Friday game and three Thanksgiving Day games, some of which won't air on network TV-- which means fans will need to add certain streaming platform subscriptions to their viewing roster to supplement the NFL games on the Sling TV Season Pass.\n\nBecause the NFL is moving its schedule to include more and more streaming-exclusive games each season, we love saving on Sling TV Season Pass to access network-aired NFL games, which leaves our budget open to subscribe to the other streamers needed to watch those streaming-exclusive NFL games this season.\n\nIn addition to the Sling TV Season Pass, NFL fans will want to subscribe to Amazon Prime Video, Peacock, Netflix and ESPN+.\n\n2024-5 NFL season: Streaming-exclusive games\n\nThe 2024-5 NFL season schedule will feature more streaming-exclusive games than ever before.\n\nAmazon Prime Video: Thursday Night Football games, Weeks 1-17, the Black Friday Game, Nov. 29. and one Wild Card game.\n\nNetflix: Dec. 25, 2024, two Christmas Games (Week 17)\n\nPeacock will air (exclusively) the Week 1 Packers vs. Eagles game live from Brazil, and stream all games airing on NBC (SNF) throughout the season.\n\nESPN+ will carry 25 NFL games this season, including one ESPN+ exclusive game (Chargers vs. Cardinals, Oct. 21 at 9 p.m. ET)\n\nHow to watch streaming-exclusive NFL games this season\n\nThis season, more NFL games than ever will be broadcast exclusively on streaming platforms, including Netflix, Peacock and Amazon Prime Video.

You can begin watching immediately on your TV, phone, tablet or computer. In addition to NFL football, FuboTV offers MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer games.\n\nTop features of FuboTV Pro Tier:\n\nThere are no contracts with FuboTV -- you can cancel at any time.\n\nThe Pro tier includes over 180 channels, including NFL Network. (You'll need to upgrade to Ultimate for NFL RedZone.)\n\nFuboTV includes all the channels you'll need to watch college and pro football, including CBS (not available through Sling TV).\n\nAll tiers come with 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR recording.\n\nStream on your TV, phone, and other devices.\n\nWatch every network-aired NFL game on Hulu + Live TV\n\nYou can watch the NFL, including the NFL Network, with Hulu + Live TV.

To boost your NFL experience even further, you can upgrade to NFL+ Premium with NFL RedZone and watch up to eight NFL games simultaneously.\n\nTop features of NFL+:\n\nYou get access to all NFL preseason games, including those that are out of market.\n\nNFL+ lets you watch stream local and primetime regular season games on your phone or tablet, but not your TV.\n\nIncludes the NFL Network (and NFL RedZone with NFL+ Premium), so it's a good option for those who are looking to stream football on the go.\n\nWaiting for the game to start?
