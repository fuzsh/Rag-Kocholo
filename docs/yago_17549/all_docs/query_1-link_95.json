I evolved into being a Primary Care Provider in 2015 when I graduated, and was licensed as a Family Nurse Practitioner.\n\nAlong with practicing in healthcare, I began the role of educator in 2014 as a Clinical Instructor and was hired in 2017 to the Annie Taylor Dee School of Nursing as a full-time faculty member.

Students often learn best in a safe, welcoming environment that makes them more confident in expressing ideas, asking questions and telling you about their needs. That helps to create that environment by making students feel that they're treated equally, no matter their race, gender, ability or background. It requires intentional effort by educators to help students overcome barriers to learning. It can also enrich the classroom experience for students by giving them access to a broader set of perspectives. I proactively aim to assimilate this in numerous ways to all of my courses.\n\nPersonal Activities\n\nMost importantly, I am married with four children. My husband (whom I still refer to as my boyfriend) is the love of my life and we have been married for over two decades.
