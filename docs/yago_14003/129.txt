Where to Watch

In an early-'50s sitcom, Jack Lemmon and Cynthia Stone played a recently married couple, parts that didn't require much acting since they were were real-life husband and wife at the time. The humor stems from Betsy helping Pete out of jams while he works in a department store's toy section.
