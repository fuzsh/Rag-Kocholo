        "text": "I’m the author of the YA novel Postcards from Summer; middle grade novel Parker Bell & the Science of Friendship; and picture books including Grow, Easter Starring Egg, Panda-Monium, and A Little Bit of Love. As well, I’ve written numerous board books, including Happy Halloween, Teal Pumpkin! and Curious George books, as well as stories and readers for the Khan Academy Kids learning app.\n\nWhen I’m not writing, I teach at Lesley University’s MFA in Creative Writing program and am the editorial director at Tumblehome Inc. In my past career, I worked as a children’s book editor at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Candlewick Press.\n\nAlong with my daughter, husband, and guinea pig, I live in a little yellow house that looks like something out of a storybook. We’re very lucky to be just a stone’s throw from the ocean, where I can spend endless hours searching for sea glass."
