        "text": "ZELIENOPLE -- When young Chris Lemmon sat at the dinner table each evening, his father’s chair was empty.\n\nOther than that, “Jack Lemmon’s son” had it all. Or so it seemed in family and publicity photographs from the ‘50s through early ‘70s.\n\nHis famous father was the fabulous actor Jack Lemmon, seamlessly funny in comedies such as “Some Like It Hot” and “The Odd Couple,” and empathetically flawed and determined to deal with life and death in dramas such as “The Days of Wine and Roses” and “Tuesdays with Morrie.”\n\nThe Harvard-educated and two-time Academy Award winner jokingly called himself “America’s Sweetheart” and nicknamed his son “Hotshot” and “Ramhead.” Chris called his dad “Pops.”\n\nTheir relationship followed a father-son script many lucky baby boomers shared. Little boys wanted to be like, be with and have fun with their fathers. What dad said mattered; what dad did made them proud. From that came respect and security and a lifelong need for approval.\n\nJack Lemmon was that kind of dad on a grand scale, his son has said. Their script wasn’t perfect, and in time, each came to understand their roles well. But neither mastered their golf game.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon and evening on the small stage at the Strand Theater in Zelienople, Chris Lemmon, a tall Jack Lemmon lookalike, will be “Pops” in “A Twist of Lemmon,” his one-man tribute to his father.\n\nLemmon died of cancer on June 27, 2001, at age 76, days after his son’s 47th birthday.\n\nAfter his father’s death, Chris began writing about his father; his memories, Pops' stories about his childhood, his Hollywood cronies, the movies. The memories became a book, “A Twist of Lemmon, A Tribute to My Father” published in 2006.\n\nThe book evolved into this intimate show.\n\nDays of wine and roses\n\nChristopher Boyd Lemmon was born June 22, 1954, in Hollywood, Calif., four years after his father and mother, television actress Cynthia Stone, married.\n\nJack Lemmon, the only child of a Doughnut Corporation of America executive and his petite, funny, party-loving wife, grew up, pampered and indulged, near Newtown, Mass. He attended private schools, taught himself to play the piano, majored in war service science at Harvard, found his passion for acting there, graduated unceremoniously in 1947, then moved to New York City to pursue acting.\n\nCynthia Stone, a blond beauty from Peoria, Ill., had the same dream. The two met at the Actors Studio in New York, worked together on several short-lived TV series including “Heaven for Betsy,” then moved to California.\n\nThe couple divorced when their son was 3 years old. The little boy lived with his mother on Santa Monica beach. Within several years, his parents both married others, began new lives and became parents again.\n\nJack Lemmon’s star shined brilliantly during the ‘50s, ‘60s and ‘70s. He was driven, focused, successful and considered a nice guy in the movie capital of cut-throat competition, according to newspaper clippings and biographies.\n\nBut Lemmon played a supporting role during the first two decades of his son’s life.\n\nHe visited, went to baseball games, took Chris to movie sets, played the piano at a big beach house while his son sat on the bench with him. Soon, the little boy wanted to play, too. He learned well. In the mid-'60s, Cynthia Stone’s new marriage would take her and Chris to Florida. Before the move, Lemmon took Chris on an incredible and indelible week-long fishing trip to Alaska to celebrate his 11th birthday. But the trips and visits always came to a too-soon end. Pops always had to leave.\n\nAn out-of-towner\n\n“I had that empty chair at the dinner table. Period,” Chris Lemmon said by phone from his home in South Glastonbury, Conn. “Of course, I didn’t know it then. It wasn’t until I grew older that I realized what I had been feeling and there was something missing. It was the father who would burst through the front door (after work).”\n\nAs TV dads Ward Cleaver and Rob Petrie did on “Leave it to Beaver” and “The Dick Van Dyke Show.”\n\n“He was there. He wasn’t there like a father was there, not just for the baseball games. They’re there. 24/7 and that kind of stuff stays,” Chris Lemmon said.\n\nTheir dynamic changed in time.\n\nThe young Lemmon initially wanted to be a concert pianist, changed course and acted in several light-comedy films, and with his father in “That’s Life” and “Dad” in the late 1980s.\n\n“It wasn’t until I grew older and that parent/child separation happens and you go out on your own, and you realize that you are adult, that is when we became closer.”\n\nTwo men became best friends.\n\nAnd Chris became a father. In the mid-1980s, he met Connecticut native Gina Raymond, an international model living in New York. Two years later, she moved to California. They were married in April 1988 and are parents of three children, Sydney, 24, a graduate student in fine arts at Yale University, Christopher Jr., 21, a student at Lasell College in Newtown, Mass., and Jonathan, 19, a freshman at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. The three children grew up in their Connecticut home, and each evening, from day one, except when he was out of town, the Lemmon family ate dinner together, the father of three said.\n\nA not-so-odd couple\n\nChris Lemmon put memories into written words that became reels of stories about family and famous friends, silly anecdotes and nuances that were just like the stuff all folks did and filmed in their home movies.\n\nExcept the cars that Jack Lemmon drove poorly and wrecked often were Porsches, not Fords. And the pro-am golf tournament he played in 35 times was at Pebble Beach in California, not Schenley Park in Pittsburgh.\n\nAnd, yes, it’s true, Jack Lemmon was born in a hospital elevator on Feb. 8, 1925.\n\n“Twist of Lemmon” isn’t a tell-all tale of gossip, trysts or retribution. “The book is a heartfelt yearning that every single child on the face of the earth has to understand -- what their parents mean to them and what their relationship to them is all about,” Lemmon said.\n\nIt’s full of belly-busting stories about bears, fishing and elephant plants, as well as succinct and gracefully stated facts about divorce, about facing alcoholism head on and tragedy.\n\n“It’s a father and son who are ripped apart for numerous reasons and then he dies. And not a day goes by that I don’t have the dreams of us together running through Alaska. I don’t fish anymore. I don’t golf anymore,” Lemmon said.\n\nThe book didn’t end on page 184. It evolved. Lemmon, a talented writer, honed his skills and believed that the book would translate into a performance piece.\n\nFor months in 2013 and 2014, he and a co-writer, Hershey Felder, looked at the book’s content and wrote a script that followed the book’s narrative, with Chris Lemmon telling his father’s story. His gut kept telling him something was missing. The answer came two days before the technical rehearsals were to begin at the Broads Stage in Los Angeles. He did a page 1 rewrite of the script.\n\n“It became enormously clear to me that it needed to be told in my father’s voice. I needed to become my father,” Lemmon said.\n\nAnd that’s what he did at initial performances in Chicago, Laguna Beach, Calif., and later in Minnesota and Ventura, Calif. It’s a show, he said, for those who watched Jack Lemmon in films and on stage, and for younger generations who might not recognize his name. Mostly, he wants people to know, “That he was a good father and a good friend.”\n\n“I show a side of him that only I knew, and to keep his memory alive and the memory of those who knew Pop. I do over 50 voices,” Lemmon said. Among them are James Cagney, Gregory Peck, Marilyn Monroe, George Kukor, Walter Matthau and Judy Holliday.\n\n“I’m not doing imitations,” Lemmon said. “I am channeling my father on stage. He is the one doing those. It’s Jack Lemmon.”\n\nAnd so each time Chris Lemmon steps onto the stage, he does what his father did before the cameras rolled. He says, “It’s magic time.”"
