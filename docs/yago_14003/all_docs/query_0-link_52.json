        "text": "ZELIENOPLE -- \"A Twist of Lemmon,\" coming April 25 at The Strand Theater, is Chris Lemmon's tribute to his father, famed actor Jack Lemmon.\n\nLemmon will share the story of their relationship, which carries a message. \"The message is to go to the people we love and hug them and tell them that we love them because we never know when they won't be there,\" Lemmon said.\n\nLemmon said he will also be talking about his mother, Cynthia Stone, also an actress. \"My mother was a magnificent woman, truly a generous, lovely person. My parents divorced in 1956, but I think they both always regretted it,\" Lemmon said.\n\nLemmon tells the story in the voice of his father, and on stage, he becomes his father as he tells about their bond. The small, intimate stage of The Strand is the perfect place to enjoy Lemmon's story of what it was like to have a famous father and grow up during what some regard as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood.\" Jack Lemmon starred in over 60 films, was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won two Oscars -- one for \"Mister Roberts\" for Best Supporting Actor and the other for \"Save the Tiger\" for Best Actor.\n\nThe show is filled with behind-the-scenes stories and dozens of impressions of entertainers and actors, such as James Cagney, Gregory Peck, Marilyn Monroe and Jack Lemmon's best friend, Walter Matthau. Chris Lemmon, an actor and a musician with 30 years in the business, also performs some of his father's favorite Gershwin songs.\n\nLemmon, who does a lot of traveling, said he had never been in Zelienople but is looking forward to it. In the mid-1980s, he was in Pittsburgh when starring with Meredith MacRae in the TV series \"Fantasy.\"\n\n\"Traveling is a half-dozen of one and a half-dozen of the other, but this show is special to me. I love doing this show. When the audience enjoys it, that is the reward that makes all the travel worthwhile,\" Lemmon said.\n\nRon Carter, executive director of The Strand Initiative, describes the show as a tribute to Jack Lemmon and a true father/son story with a Hollywood background. \"It is funny and heartwarming,\" Carter said.\n\nChris Lemmon's book \"A Twist of Lemmon\" is the basis for the show, and his voice and physical resemblance to his father create the perfect illusion. Lemmon chronicles his father's life from his birth in 1925 until his death in 2001.\n\nChris Lemmon graduated from the California Institute of the Arts with degrees in classical piano and composition as well as a degree in theater arts. He has appeared in stage productions, more than 25 films including \"Just the Ticket\" and \"That's Life,\" and in television series such as \"Knots Landing,\" \"Studio 59\" and \"Brothers and Sisters.\""
