She was a believer in all who crossed her path, she never judged, she always inspired.\n\nShe enjoyed reading, puzzles, golf, music, dancing, and cooking, however her true passion was her family. Her boys were her life, and she became “Mama Kaz” to all their friends. She was a true Cinderella. Cindy was the definition of elegance and class, she was dependable, full of kindness, caring and above all else was a true friend and confidant.\n\nCindy is survived by her husband, Dr John Kazanowski; 3 sons, Justin (Emily) Kazanowski, Adam Kazanowski, and Michael Kazanowski; siblings, Linda (Fred) Systma, Deborah VanBuren, and Larry (Jennie) Simon; brothers-in law, Roger Kazanowski and Robert (Diane) Kazanowski; sister-in-law, Cara Kazanowski; and by many nieces and nephews.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her brothers-in-law, Lawrence Kazanowski and Nicholas Richardson.\n\nThe family will receive friends at the Stone Funeral Home at 2098 East Mitchell Road, Petoskey, MI 49770 on Thursday, September 1st from 4-9pm.
