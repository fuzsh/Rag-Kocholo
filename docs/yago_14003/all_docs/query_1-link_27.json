        "text": "Offset’s two-year-old son has money on his mind.\n\nThe Migos rapper took to his Instagram Stories on Monday (Aug. 6) to share a photo of his son, whom he shares with Cardi B, kneeling on the ground while holding up a stack of cash to his ear. He followed it up with sweet photos with his baby boy, hanging out together and driving in a car.\n\nSee the Stories here.\n\nThe photo series comes just days after Cardi B filed for divorce from Offset for the second time since they tied the knot in 2017. According to Cardi’s rep, the divorce filing “is not based on any one particular incident, it has been a long time coming and is amicable.”\n\nCardi previously filed to legally end their marriage in September 2020. Within a month, however, Cardi revealed that the couple had sorted things out, and the case was dismissed in the early days of November 2020."
