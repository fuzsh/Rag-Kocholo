        "text": "Cynthia DeLaine Simonet-Bell was born March 29, 1968, to Kenneth and Olga Simonet in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Cynthia departed this life on June 11, 2024.\n\nShe grew up and attended schools here in Houston when the family relocated in 1974, graduating from Dobie High School. Afterwards she attended the Art Institution of Houston and received her associate’s degree in culinary. She received additional Management training, eventually going on to work with companies such as Stone Kitchen catering, Don Carlos catering and manager at branches of Los Tios Restaurants. She would eventually leave her hospitality career seeking personal fulfilment in her next career choice of Education.\n\nOn October 17, 1998, Cynthia married her best friend Lorne Bell and to them was born a precious daughter, Haviland Bell. Although she only had one child, she loved many as her own, cousin, nieces, and nephews (who include Madisyn, Tae’lor, Cadie, Trystin, Gavin, and Bryce) as well as the special needs children she worked with at McWhirter and later, P.H. Greene Elementary as a Teacher’s Assistant. A profession that she was dedicated to and loved so much.\n\nIf anyone epitomized the Fruits of the Spirit it was her, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, and faith. These were the traits by which you could describe her daily actions, motivations, and walk as a Christian. Never complaining, giving up hope, but living every day with positivity toward situations and the people she encountered.\n\nCynthia is survived by her husband, Lorne Bell, daughter, Haviland Bell, father, Kenneth Simonet (Janice), her brothers Michael Simonet (Erika), Bryan Simonet (Julia) and Nicholas Simonet. As well as a special sister/cousin Chevonne LeDay. She also leaves to mourn an aunt Mary Gradnigo, uncles Joseph Gradnigo (Bertha), Patrick Gradnigo, cousins, nieces, nephews, and too many friends and acquaintances to count.\n\nCynthia is predeceased by her mother, Olga Marie Simonet, grandparents Wallace and Beulah Gradnigo and Ernest and Rena Simonet all from Lake Charles.\n\nWe will miss her presence, her voice, her smile, but for only a while when we all meet again; that is the Hope!\n\nIn lieu of flowers please make a donation in her name to the following:\n\nGirl Scouts of America\n\nFoundation for Sarcoidosis Research\n\nFederation for Children with Special Needs\n\nA memorial service will be held at Forest Lawn Funeral Home, 8706 Almeda Genoa Rd., Houston, Texas Saturday, June 29, 2024 from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. with a service beginning at 11:30 a.m."
