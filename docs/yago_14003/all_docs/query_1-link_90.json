        "text": "Cynthia Gustafson, age 106, of Ortonville, MN, died on January 8, 2020, at Essentia Health Grace Home in Graceville, MN.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday, January 11, 2019, at 2:00 p.m. at Zion Lutheran Church in Ortonville, MN. Visitation will be held one hour prior to services at the church on Saturday. Pastor Deborah Nissen will officiate, and interment will be at Mound Cemetery.\n\nCynthia Estella (Green) Gustafson was born on August 10, 1913, in Foster Township of Big Stone County, MN. She attended rural school through eighth grade. On August 3, 1933, Cynthia was united in marriage with Irwin Alfred Gustafson in Milbank, SD. To this union, three children were born: Ethel, Duane, and Laura. Cynthia was a farm wife who helped take care of their cows, hogs, and chickens, and was a homemaker for their family.\n\nShe was an active member of Zion Lutheran Church of Ortonville, WELCA, and enjoyed the church quilting group. Cynthia was an avid seamstress who especially enjoyed sewing quilts, crocheting, and embroidering dish towels. She was a marvelous cook and made home cooked meals from scratch every day. Cynthia was also a fantastic baker and did a lot of her own canning. She loved to garden and could be seen tending to her flower beds with her long-sleeved shirt and straw hat in the early summer hours. Cynthia also push-mowed her own yard until she was over 100 years old. She was a member of the Hospital Auxiliary and loved her cancer walk group: “Oldies But Goodies”.\n\nLeft to cherish her memory are her daughters: Ethel (Wayne) Schoon of Ortonville, MN; and Laura Marshall of Greeley, CO; seven grandchildren; 15 great-grandchildren; 16 great-great-grandchildren; daughter-in-law, Sally Gustafson; along with many nieces and nephews.\n\nCynthia was preceded in death by her husband, Irwin, in 1990; her son, Duane; her parents; sisters: Nellie Wentland and Laura Rintoul; brother, Byron Green; and son-in-law, Vern Marshall.\n\nMemorials are preferred to Zion Lutheran Church in Ortonville, MN."
