As a young man, he worked at the old newspaper offices on Heard Street, later working for Coldwater Seafoods/Preferred Freezer in Everett and he retired from Eastern Connection in Woburn.\n\nA member of the Cary Square Club, Richie drove a taxi in Chelsea for many years and was a well-known figure around town.\n\nRichard was predeceased by his daughter, Stephanie Cormier of Marshfield and Chelsea. He is survived by his daughter, Colleen Cormier and her husband, Stephen Troisi of Woburn. He was the cherished brother of Joan Cormier of Ladysmith, Virginia, Janice and Angus MacDonald of Methuen, Walter and Barbara Cormier of Everett, James Cormier of Hudson, New Hampshire, Daniel Cormier and Marta Priftis of Falls Church, Virginia and his brother-in-law, Robert Young of St. Albans, West Virginia. Richie was predeceased by his sisters, Catherine Mahoney and her husband, Joseph of Methuen, sister Mary Young of St. Albans, West Virginia, brother John Cormier of Chelsea and sisters-in-law Pauline Cormier of Londonderry, New Hampshire and Cynthia Cormier of Hudson, New Hampshire. Richie is fondly remembered by many nieces, nephews, cousins and friends, and dearly missed by his most constant companion, his cat, Buddy.\n\nEver the cab driver, Richie was often seen shuttling friends and family around town. Rush hour, noon, or 3 a.m., if you needed a ride, just call Richie. He would talk your ear off, but he’d get you to the airport on time! He always felt a special obligation to the elderly and went out of his way to run errands and go grocery shopping for his older friends. He had a special bond with his friend Jimmy B., as they helped and supported each other through the pandemic and beyond.\n\nRichie was gregarious, ready to strike up a conversation with everyone he met. He seemed to run into someone he knew wherever he went, and he did love to travel. He never missed family trips to Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. He flew to San Diego to see the Patriots, drove to Montreal to watch his nephews play hockey, and especially loved vacations to Ireland and Nova Scotia to see the places of his ancestors.\n\nRichie was quick with a joke or anecdote, his sense of humor likely forged at the age of five when he would get up early, dress himself and cross the street to his aunt Josephine’s house to watch the Three Stooges over breakfast. His childhood was spent playing with neighborhood kids on the streets of Chelsea, most memorably when he was hit by a fire truck! As a young man, he played street hockey at Hockey Town USA, followed by a scorpion bowl or two at the August Moon. He loved cards, and no doubt has a poker game going right now, with his daughter Stephanie taking all his money.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Joslin Diabetes Center https://giving.bilh.org/joslindiabetescenter/\n\nServices are pending and will be announced at a later time.\n\nTo send expressions of sympathy, please visit www.WelshFH.com"
