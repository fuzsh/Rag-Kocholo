        "text": "Now known as Cynthia Shirona-Stone, she married Steven and had two children: Garnet Shirona-Stone and Emily Shirona-Stone respectively.\n\nMany years passed and the League had added Leon, the \"Unbeatable Champion\" of Galar, to participate in The World Tournament. Cynthia battles Leon and was surprised to see Leon's Charizard Gigantimax and lost for the first time in years. Another year later she challenges Leon again and this time comes out on top. Five years later, she still could barely beat the Galar Champion without her Garchomp extremely weakened.\n\nAfter defeating Alder's successor Iris, in the finals, she goes back to her hotel and packs. Steven comes in and notices that his wife looks tired and distracted. Cynthia confesses and says she had dreams of a young girl racing at high speeds up a tower, where two other girls were fighting. The young woman had an arrow pointed to the weakened girls heart and kills her, then everything went white.\n\nHer husband comforts her and eases her distress, until she told him to go back to the airport without her. She was about to proceed to catch up when she noticed a magenta light on the horizon and hears a familiar roar in the distance. She calls upon Togekiss and goes to investigate. She comes across the Slumbering Weald, and meets Palkia and Arceus at the shrine of Galer's Legendary Pokémon.\n\nArceus ask Cynthia for her help and request that she helps fight an evil dark entity in another universe. They go on to say that they cannot do it on their own for they would risk corruption from the darkness they possess. Instead, Arceus and trusts Palkia to Cynthia to take her their and help her in this quest. Cynthia was rather conflicted about, this not wanting to leave her family behind. Arceus promises her that they will keep an eye on them while she is away.\n\nWith new found determination and reassurance, Cynthia accepts the task and both she and the Spatial Pokémon travel to Remnant.\n\nCynthia's Pokémon Team\n\nPalkia: Lv 100\n\nSpacial Rend\n\nAura Sphere\n\nHyper Beam\n\nProtect"
