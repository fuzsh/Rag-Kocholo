        "text": "Cynthia \"Thea\" Archacki Stone, 66, of Meadville, passed away after a 45 year battle with lupus and a two year battle with metastatic breast cancer on Sunday, July 17, 2022, at home, surrounded by her family.\n\nCynthia was born in Toledo, OH, on July 23, 1955, a daughter of Helen (Plementosh) Archacki and the late Henry Archacki.\n\nOn September 21, 1984, she married David Stone; he survives.\n\nShe was a member of St. Bernadette's Roman Catholic Church.\n\nA 1973 graduate of Saegertown High School, Thea was also a 1977 graduate of the former Alliance College where she earned a Bachelor's of Art Degree in Social Services before going on to complete two Masters Degrees, one from Gannon University and the other from the University of Akron.\n\nThea worked as a Licensed Family Therapist and Counselor providing services, training, and seminars throughout western Pennsylvania. She designed and developed, along with her partner Pat Johnston from UPMC, a curriculum that several agencies would use to counsel and treat their clients. She also created guidelines that are used by many family therapists. She was a member of the American Association of Family Therapy. Thea took pride in her work and provided counseling to numerous agencies including the Barber Center, Cen Clair, the Community Counseling Center of Mercer County, and others. She was always willing to reach out to those in need, anytime of the day or night.\n\nIn the early 1990's, Thea and her husband Dave, purchased and operated Mickey's Restaurant on North Street. In 1999 they purchased the former Meadville Fire Station on Park Ave., and created Mickey's Central Fire Station Restaurant. Thea's drive and talents allowed her to redesign the interior, purchase fire station memorabilia, research, find and display numerous old photos that were displayed throughout the restaurant and bar. She and Dave went on to purchase Lake Harris Hideaway, Traverse, FL, which they still own.\n\nShe enjoyed attending class reunions and family functions. Her greatest enjoyment came from following the development and career of her nephew Nick Archacki. She would travel to local bowling events, collegiate or national tournaments, and follow his career either on line or on TV. Watching his growth and success provided her the greatest enjoyment in her life. Thea also gained great joy from her Siberian cats. They loved her as much as she loved them.\n\nOne of Thea's passions was working in her yard, especially tending to her many, meticulous flower gardens. Anyone driving by the family residence, can easily appreciate her hard work in the beauty of her flower gardens, and remember the special person she was.\n\nIn addition to her husband, David, of 37 years, Thea is survived by her mother Helen Archacki of Saegertown; two brothers Dennis Archacki (April), Thomas Archacki (Ann), both of Saegertown; three god children, who were the love of her life Nathan Bahurinsky, Eve Tanas and Nick Archacki, who was also her nephew; her life long friend and confidant Denise Kosic of NC.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her father.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to visit from 3-8 PM on Friday, July 22, 2022, at STEPHEN P. MIZNER FUNERAL HOME & CREMATION SERVICES, INC., 404 CHESTNUT ST., MEADVILLE, where a Scripture Service will be held at 7:30 PM.\n\nA Mass of Resurrection will be celebrated at 10 AM on Saturday, which would have been Thea's 67th birthday, at The Epiphany of the Lord Parish, St. Agatha Church, 353 Pine St., Meadville, PA, with Fr. Joe Petrone, Parochial Vicar, officiating.\n\nThea will be laid to rest in Cambridge Springs Lower Cemetery.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in Thea's memory to Yolanda G. Barco Oncology Institute, 16792 Conneaut Lake Road, Meadville, PA 16335.\n\nThea and her family would like to acknowledge and thank all of the wonderful doctors, nurses and caregivers that took such great care of her during her illness.\n\nShare a memory or condolence at www.miznerfuneralhome.com"
