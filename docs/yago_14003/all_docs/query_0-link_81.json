        "text": "He was thoroughly professional, conscientious to the point of obsession, little affected by the trappings of fame, and generous to fellow actors. He deflected praise with characteristic bemusement. âThat thing of Jack Lemmon, Nice Guy, has been passed down over the years,â he said. âIt makes me wonder. Is everybody else a jerk?â\n\nHe struck up a happy partnership and off-screen friendship with Walter Matthau, whose more lugubrious humour provided an effective foil. He also had a particularly fruitful association with the director Billy Wilder, which extended over seven films. A man who did not suffer actorsâ vanities gladly, Wilder once said: âHappiness is working with Jack Lemmonâ.\n\nJohn Uhler Lemmon III was born into a prosperous family. His father was vice-president of the American Doughnut Corporation. He was responsible for introducing the snack into Red Cross parcels for American soldiers in Europe during the Second World War, and therefore, according to Lemmon, for âbringing the doughnut to Europeâ.\n\nOn the day of Lemmonâs birth, two months before he was due, his father did not want to leave a game of bridge, so his parents arrived late at the hospital; they were then stuck in a lift and it was there that he was born. The baby was suffering from jaundice and the nurse remarked that he was a yellow Lemmon.\n\nThe first significant step in his acting career came at the age of nine, when the lead in the school play fell ill, and Lemmon stood in, wearing a costume that was far too big for him. Not knowing one of the lines in a 15-line speech, he walked to the wings to be prompted by a teacher, which got a laugh. He did the same for every subsequent line, and got laughs all the way. âAfter that I never wanted to do anything else,â he said.\n\nHe developed his taste for acting at private schools and at Harvard, where he scraped a degree in war material management. Late in the Second World War he served as an officer in the United States Navy, and the experience helped him win an Oscar for best supporting actor in the naval comedy Mister Roberts (1955), which also starred Henry Fonda and James Cagney.\n\nHe had happily given up the chance to follow in his fatherâs business and had resolved to be- come an actor. A self-taught pianist, he played in a New York beer hall before picking up jobs in radio and television, but his break came in 1953 with his first Broadway play, Room Service. He was spotted by Columbia Pictures and whisked to Hollywood, under the patronage of the legendary producer Harry Cohn, who later described Lemmon as âthe nicest actor weâve ever had on the lot.â\n\nBut at first Cohn wasnât sure about Jack Lemmon from Harvard. He called the university to check that he had actually graduated, and then he wanted Lemmon to change his name, lest critics used the word to describe his films. Lemmon protested that nobody ever described Walter Pidgeonâs films as pigeons - and won the day.\n\nIn 1954 he made his film debut opposite the comedienne Judy Holliday in It Should Happen to You. He marked time for a while and then had the luck to make two pic- tures for Billy Wilder, both performances earning Oscar nominations.\n\nThe first part came about after Wilder grabbed him in a Hollywood restaurant and said of his latest project: âYouâll be running around in drag for about 80 per cent of the film. Wanna do it?â Lemmon agreed immediately and in Some Like It Hot, set in the Prohibition era, he and Tony Curtis played two musicians who dress up as women to escape pursuing gang- sters. The pair spent a week work- ing on their make-up and tested it out by going into the womenâs toilets in the Columbia studio. Nobody batted an eyelid.\n\nThe following year, in The Apartment, Lemmon starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, as an ambitious insurance clerk lending his flat to his superiors for their illicit affairs. These two performances, the first a glorious exposition of broad comedy, the second touched with pathos, put Lemmon at the top of his craft.\n\nHe always regretted not being in one of the most lauded films released during the early 1960s, having turned down a apart in The Hustler (1961). When he was approached, he asked the writer- director: âWho is going to see a film about a pool player, when all he does is play pool for half the film?â Its star, Paul Newman, also featured in another film that Lemmon turned down - Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).\n\nIn 1968 he made one of his most successful films, when he teamed up with Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple, Neil Simonâs comedy about two divorced men trying to live together. Matthau was the messy Oscar Madison, Lemmon the fussy âwifeâ, Felix Unger - though Matthau, who died last year, always felt that the roles should have been reversed.\n\nIn 1971 Lemmon turned director for the first and only time, and made Kotch, a warm and sentimental study of a grandfather, played by Matthau, trying to make it up with his family. The film also starred Lemmonâs wife, Felicia Farr. Two years later he returned to acting, in Save the Tiger (1973), in which he had a straight role as a middle-aged businessman racked by self-doubt who turns to arson to stave off bankruptcy.\n\nThe performance won him a second Oscar - this time for best actor. He regarded it as the most fulfilling performance of his career and it had been hard work, though not for the first time, he had played the part with apparent ease. He said: âPeople come up to me and say âYouâre so natural; thank God you donât act.â I feel like hitting them, because I knock myself out trying to be natural.â\n\nLemmon sealed his claim to being a serious actor with two per- fectly judged performances, in the nuclear thriller The China Syndrome (1979) and Missing (1982), for which he won the best actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Both films echoed themes in his own life: his involvement in anti- nuclear campaigns and a difficult relationship with his son.\n\nA father-son estrangement was also at the heart of Tribute, which marked Lemmonâs return to the Broadway stage in 1978 after a gap of 17 years; in the meantime he had played only one stage part, Joxer Daly to Matthauâs Jack Doyle, in a Los Angeles production of Juno and the Paycock. In Tribute he played a flamboyant theatrical publicist coming to terms with a fatal illness, and he repeated the role in a film version in 1980, for which he wrote the theme music.\n\nHis most challenging stage role was the vain and miserly James Tyrone in Eugene OâNeillâs Long Dayâs Journey into Night. Jonathan Millerâs production played in New York before transferring to London in 1987, and Lemmon returned to the London stage in 1989, when he starred with Michael Gambon in the anti-war drama Veteransâ Day. In a rare failure for either actor, it closed after bad reviews and dwindling audiences.\n\nLemmon called himself the luckiest man on earth. âThe average actor canât make a living at acting: he has to take some other job. So Iâm a lucky guy.â He once said that his lowest depth of misery came when he missed a one-foot putt on the 18th hole.\n\nâRetire?â he once asked. âWhat for?â Unlike many of his contemporaries Lemmon advanced into old age as good as ever. Grumpy Old Men (1993), which renewed his comic partnership with Matthau, might be a retreading of old ground, as was The Odd Couple II (1998); and his appearances in Oliver Stoneâs JFK (1991) and Robert Altmanâs The Player (1992) and Short Cuts (1993), were little more than cameos; but his monstrous real estate salesman, Shelley âThe Machineâ Levine, in David Mametâs Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) ranked with his most effective performances.\n\nLemmonâs first marriage, to the actress Cynthia Stone, was dissolved in 1956. Their son, Christopher, became an actor and appeared with his father in the films Airport â77 and Thatâs Life (1986). The latter also featured his second wife, Felicia Farr, whom he married in 1962. They had a daughter, Courtney. His wife, son and daughter survive him."
