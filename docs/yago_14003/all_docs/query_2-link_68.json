        "text": "Death is part of life. But it isn't until you have experienced a great loss yourself that it really hits you. Although most of my friends are widowed, I had never realised the pain and grief they must have endured - for the first three months after my husband died, I was in a frozen limbo. I cried most nights, felt desperately tired and went over and over the memories of his last weeks when he was severely ill.\n\nI have been widowed for almost a year now. Lying alone in bed the other morning, there came the realisation that I'll never see him again, never feel his arms around me, never have another goodnight kiss. Like me, most married women will become widows. In the UK nearly half of all women over 65 are widows, and that shoots up to four-fifths of women aged 85 or more - a result of women having a longer life span than men and often marrying men who are older than themselves.\n\nKenneth, my husband, was the most important part of my life for almost 60 years, and I was his. In my files I found three gift cards that read: \"You are the light of my life\"; \"To the best girl in the world, from one who knows\"; \"To my sweetest sweetie pie\".\n\nAt 83, I have had a long and fulfilled life, but I know that no one will ever care for me as Ken did. He gave me everything I ever wanted: love, affection, care; encouragement in my work; approbation but never flattery; appreciation for nice meals; a shared interest in our travels all over the world, with memorable visits to art galleries, operas, concerts and ballets. When Ken was courting me in 1947 he took me out to see everything London could offer, including Alicia Markova and Margot Fonteyn at the ballet in Covent Garden.\n\nI absolutely adore ballet, but once we were married Ken confessed that he had never actually liked it. Nonetheless, he continued to take me to Covent Garden as a yearly birthday treat. The last ballet we saw together was A Month in the Country with Sylvie Guillem. I wrote to Sylvie to congratulate her on her wonderful performance and told her about my husband. I jokingly said I regarded it as marriage under false pretences. She wrote back to say: \"He must have loved you very much.\"\n\nI was determined to have a job after I married - I had already graduated from the LSE. In 1948, Ken came up to Birmingham University as a lecturer in the department of experimental pathology and I found work as a research assistant in the faculty of commerce. After my first daughter was born I became a research assistant to Professor Gilbert Walker, and he then asked me to work on a research project for the Family Planning Association. Ken encouraged me in this, despite being a Catholic, and I worked for the FPA both in a voluntary and paid capacity for 39 years - my life's work.\n\nMy mother was a very independent businesswoman with her own bank account in a different bank from my father. I followed suit, and except for a short period when we had a joint account for our wedding-present money, we kept separate accounts. So when Ken died I was able to manage monetary affairs and pay bills, get estimates and cope with insurance and other financial matters.\n\nAlthough I consider myself a capable person, I always felt Ken was a rock around which I bobbed, and that he helped me make decisions. I feel I have very rarely made unilateral decisions, that everything just dropped into my lap - my husband, the children, my jobs, our houses. Everything I ever wanted he gave me. Often he came clothes shopping with me and if I was undecided about two lovely garments he would say: \"Have both, I'll buy one for you!\"\n\nI have never been a religious person, but in the last month I have felt my husband's spirit is up above and down here with me. I feel his guiding presence. We used to spend weekends doing the general knowledge crosswords, which Ken was a whiz at, and now I manage to finish some on my own - words float into my mind that I never realised I knew.\n\nAt bedtime I say a short prayer for Ken, and I write daily letters to him. I have started to attend Quaker meetings, too. We sit in silence for an hour - a perfect stillness - unless someone feels a need to speak about God and love.\n\nI am just beginning to get on with life. A cousin who has faced tragedy with great courage has contacted me frequently. She once said: \"I went to my doctor and he said you either 'go under, or get on with it',\" and she chose the latter. Last April, when Ken died, two close friends also died. At the shiva for one of them the rabbi said to his widow: \"You won't feel like going out or seeing many people in the next few weeks, but then you must get on with life - L'chayim.\" So I have followed his advice.\n\nThe other day a friend visited and said: \"Kenneth would be proud of you.\" This is because in the last few months, two bedrooms have been redecorated and recarpeted. I tried sleeping in the old bedroom that Ken and I had shared, but I felt too lonely. So I continue to sleep in what was a spare bedroom and have made it very cosy with my favourite family photos, books and pictures.\n\nIt was Ken who always made the necessary plans to keep the garden well maintained and well stocked; now it is up to me to get estimates for trimming the hedges, a special lawn treatment and lopping some trees. He specialised in fuschias that he over-wintered in his greenhouse. The year before he died, when he was well enough, my granddaughter and I helped him to sit by a garden urn, so he could plant out his fuchsias - a lovely afternoon in the sun. Last year, he died before the planting-out season began and I became the one who filled the urns using the over-wintered plants from his greenhouse. The urns were spectacular. The fuchsias will always remind me of him and give me a strong sense of continuity and strength.\n\nHow newly bereaved people manage without the help of family members and friends, I just don't know. My family helped with all the death and funeral arrangements. Various friends have spent the odd night with me; my daughter-in-law took me clothes shopping (I have lost two stone and gone down two sizes); and a neighbour invited me to an evening meal. We have now instituted a regular cooked evening meal at one of our houses every week. This means that we both have to cook properly with fish or meat, two veg and a pudding - rather than scrambled eggs with a tomato and a few grapes!\n\nI have had many letters of sympathy from friends and colleagues of my husband. Numerous friends have continued to ask me out for meals and have taken me to concerts - more fun than going alone. But what is peculiar is that to some friends I have become a non-person. These were people with whom Ken and I had enjoyed a good relationship but they rarely phone or ask me out.\n\nAlso, however nice the day, I found that I was coming home to an empty house. So I have taken the plunge and acquired a dog: a seven-year-old, house-trained mongrel. Now, as well as my husband's presence, I also have a canine companion. Ken had a great sense of humour and would have approved of Lukie, who makes me laugh at her antics and is also a good guard dog.\n\nMy life has changed and I miss Ken dearly. The sense of bereavement will never leave me, but I am adapting. I have many happy memories, but as the poet Dannie Abse has written, \"Memory is the father of tears\"."
