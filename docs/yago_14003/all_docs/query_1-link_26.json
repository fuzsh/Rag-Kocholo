        "text": "In 2018, Emily Simpson revealed to Page Six that she and her husband, Shane Simpson, got \"married so quickly\" that he didn't get her \"an actual engagement ring,\" only a wedding band. Years later, The Real Housewives of Orange County couple honored their union with an official celebration (and some new rings).\n\nFor that occasion, Shane gifted his wife a stunning ring with a large center stone and pavé band. He also got her a second pavé band (a \"wedding band\") and a third and final diamond band to celebrate 10 years together.\n\nMore recently, the couple celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary, and Shane was back again with a special surprise: an \"upgraded\" diamond engagement ring.\n\nSee Emily Simpson's New Engagement Ring from Shane Simpson for Their 15th Anniversary\n\nOn Season 18, Episode 5 of RHOC, Emily and Shane went out to dinner for their anniversary and Shane presented Emily with a gift. \"I upgraded your engagement ring!\" Shane exclaimed, handing Emily a box with a huge, dazzling diamond ring inside.\n\n\"Oh wow!\" Emily gasped seeing the ring that featured a large center stone surrounded by a halo of diamonds set on a pavé band. \"That looks really big. That's huge. Looks nice, thank you!\"\n\n\"15 years is such a huge milestone,\" Emily shared in an interview confessional. \"Shane and I are at this point where we really understand each other. At the end of the day, Shane's the only person that I want to spend the rest of my life with.\"\n\nInside Emily and Shane Simpson's 15th wedding anniversary\n\nIn addition to seeing their sweet moment at dinner on RHOC, we also caught up with the couple back in February when they celebrated 15 years together.\n\n\"15 years ago I took a huge leap of faith and married Shane at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas; it was quick, it was crazy and I had no clue what I was doing,\" Emily shared in a February 14 Instagram post that featured several adorable photos of her and her husband. \"I just knew he was a good man with a good heart and he made me laugh[.]\"\n\nShe continued: \"Fast forward 15 years later and here we are still going strong, building a beautiful life, raising five children and still sort of liking each other. Thank you for putting up with me for 15 years, making fun of me for 15 years and always being my biggest fan and supporter while still putting me in my place and keeping me humble and grounded. I know it’s an incredibly daunting task.\""
