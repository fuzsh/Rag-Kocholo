        "text": "Cynthia Watros is an American television actress, who portrays Nina Reeves in the ABC daytime soap opera General Hospital.\n\nLife and career[]\n\nWatros was born in Lake Orion, Michigan. She attended Macomb Community College in Clinton Township, Michigan, and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Theatre from Boston University, where she was part of Boston University's Professional Actors Training Program.\n\nIn 1994, she was cast in the regular role of Annie Dutton on Guiding Light, which earned her the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1998. Her character, a nurse, began as a heroine, but she gained notice and critical acclaim as her character gradually descended into madness. In 1998, Watros won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on Guiding Light. In 1998, she briefly filled in for Jensen Buchanan as Victoria Hudson McKinnon on Another World while Buchanan was on maternity leave.\n\nWatros appeared as Erin Fitzpatrick on Titus from 2000 to 2002 and gained recognition as a comedic actress, playing the fiancée of the title character. According to the DVD commentary, Erin was intended to be neurotic and socially awkward, but the character was revised a week before the pilot was shot.\n\nIn 2002, she took on the role of Kellie Newmark on The Drew Carey Show, as a replacement for Christa Miller. Watros played the role from 2002–04.\n\nIn 2005 joined the cast of Lost as Libby Smith, a psychologist and member of the \"Tailies\", a group of survivors of the plane crash who were in the tail section of the plane (and not seen during Season One). She was a romantic interest to Hurley and was very mysterious showing up in flashbacks.\n\nSince 2019, Watros joined the cast of General Hospital as Nina Reeves, taking over the role from actress Michelle Stafford who returned to the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nWatros has been married to Curtis Gilliland since 1996. They have twin daughters, born in 2001.[1]\n\nIn 2006, Watros pleaded guilty to a DUI charge. She was fined, ordered to undergo counseling, and had her driver's license suspended for 90 days.\n\nIn 2008, Watros participated in a USO tour to Iraq, visiting several bases, including COP Callahan in Baghdad's East Adamiyah area.\n\nIn 2013, Watros joined the cast of the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless, but left the show in early 2014 with her character being recast.\n\nIn 2019, Watros also makes a guest appearance in the digital drama series Misguided, playing a waitress named Anne, and is a throw back to her role as Annie Dutton on Guiding Light.\n\n[]\n\nIMDb\n\nTwitter\n\nWikipedia\n\nInstagram\n\nReferences[]"
