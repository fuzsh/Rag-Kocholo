        "text": "Born on August 23, 1955, in Steubenville, OH, Cindy was the daughter of John J. and Goldie Hall Machesney. A graduate of Wintersville High School, Cindy married the love of her life, Charles Oliver, on August 27, 1973. Married for 40 years, Chuck and Cindy were a testament of love and faithfulness to family, friends, and community through their involvement in Marriage Encounter, Camp Fire Inc., PTA, Steel Valley Bowling League, “Hosanna the Rock Opera”, Weirton Community Players, and St. Paul’s Church Choir and Youth Group.\n\nCindy was a woman of strong Catholic faith, a devoted member of her church, and an active participant in numerous faith-based activities. She was an enthusiastic member of St. Paul’s Choir, and the Weirton Catholic Pro-Life Group, and also brought the eucharist to local shut-ins.\n\nA selfless servant of God, she volunteered her time and energy at the Table of Hope and AIM Women’s Center, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. She had a zest for life and her adventurous spirit was evident in her love for skydiving, hot air ballooning, parasailing, zip lining, and traveling with family and friends. She loved sharing a bottle of wine around a campfire, watching a sunrise or sunset at the beach at Presque Isle, or just sitting on her back porch. Cindy will be fondly remembered by her “Cindyisms”, her love for frogs (Fully Rely On God), and being the “best Bubba ever” to Caleb and Philomena.\n\nIn addition to her parents, Cindy was preceded in death by her husband, Charles “Chuck” Oliver, brothers Danny, John, Richard, and Walter Machesney, nephew Mark Oliver, and infant granddaughter Anna Danielle Shultz.\n\nLeft to cherish her memory are her daughters Carrie (Eddie) Shultz of Joffre, PA., and Casey (Ollie) Stone of Steubenville, OH, her precious grandchildren Caleb Louis Charles Shultz and Philomena Marie Stone, her sister-in-law Cecilia Wounaris, relatives, friends, and her Fairview Street neighbors.\n\nFriends and family can be received on Sunday, July 21, from 1 -3 pm and 5-7 pm at the Greco-Hertnick Funeral Home, 3219 Main Street, Weirton, WV., 26062.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Monday, July 22 at 10:00 AM at St. Paul’s Roman Catholic Church, 140 Walnut Street, Weirton. Fr. Anthony G. Thurston and Fr. Larry Dorsch will co-officiate.\n\nCindy will be buried next to her husband in St. Paul’s Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Cindy’s name to St. Paul’s Catholic School 140 Walnut Street, Weirton, WV., 26062\n\nShare online condolences at www.grecohertnick .com\n\nThe family would like to express a sincere thanks to the UPMC Presbyterian Lung Transplant Team and Valley Hospice.\n\nBy cracky, Cindy, you finished the race and you’re finally happy as frog hairs. You kept your fork because the best was yet to come."
