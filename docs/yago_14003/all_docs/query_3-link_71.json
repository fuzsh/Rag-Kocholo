        "text": "REMEMBERING SANDRA WARNER\n\nSandra Warner, “Some Like It Hot’ Cast Member passed away\n\nTonight, my heart is broken I have just found out that Sandra Warner passed away. Not only that, but she passed away 13th March 2022 age 87.\n\nLooking through the archives, it wasn’t posted here at the time and I’m just so sorry for her friends and family that this news didn’t reach the Marilyn community sooner, as I’m sure we would have all showered her memory with love.\n\nSandra Warner was one of the last remaining “Sweet Sue And Her Society Syncopators” from “Some Like It Hot.” She played Emily and most famously chirps “Toodle-ooh!” to Jack Lemmon’s character Daphne in the train sequence of the film… “How about that “Toodle-Oooh?!” Jerry/Daphne excitedly responds!\n\nNot only that, but she was Marilyn’s body double for all the promotional shots made for the movie after filming wrapped.\n\nSpeaking in 2001, Warner said:\n\n“Marilyn and I were very round. I was a little taller than her, but I fit into her wardrobe.. and because she was pregnant, I was asked to do her publicity stills. Most of the albums, or wherever you see marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, they would use my body and Marilyn’s face… and it worked out perfectly, it couldn’t have been better and I enjoyed doing it.\n\nAnd of course, spending the whole day with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis doing stills like this one…. a laugh a minute!… it’s a wonder we got anything accomplished!\n\nWe kept listening to the playback while we did these photographs… to keep in the mood…”\n\nSandra Warner also said of the iconic 1959 Billy Wilder comedy:\n\n“Some Like It Hot” was like the greatest souffle ever made. It had the perfect ingredients, it had the greatest script, a great director, a great cast… of course the greatest Chef was Billy Wilder, but it really was like the greatest souffle ever made in history…… I was very happy to be a part of it.”\n\nI am genuinely heartbroken tonight, as the “Some Like It Hot” star twinkles that little less brightly tonight.\n\nRest in Peace Sandra.\n\nWords: Lorraine Nicol\n\nNOBODY’S PERFECT – NOT SUCH A THROWAWAY LINE\n\nBarbara Diamond, the wife of I.A.L Diamond (Billy Wilder’s writing partner for ‘Some Like It Hot’ and other Hollywood classics) said this about THAT famous last line in the iconic 1950’s comedy:\n\n“One of the results of the way they worked is that it was impossible for them to seperate one person’s work from the other. They honestly didn’t know who had written particular scenes or individual lines, and truthfully, they didn’t much care.\n\nThe one line that they did know about turned out to be the one that everyone asks about, “Nobody’s perfect.” When asked, Billy always said that it was a throwaway line of Mr Diamond’s and they had hoped overnight they would think of something better, and Iz never contradicted him. However, I have a different version of it. I wrote the scene the day before it was shot and left a copy here with me while he took it over to Billy. When he came back and asked me what I thought, I told him it was a great scene but the last line was weak. He said, “That’s what Billy thinks and you’re both wrong,’ and proceeded to tell me why.\n\nFirst of all, audiences love being able to anticipate a joke. The dimmest members of the audience know that Jack’s last line is going to be “I’m a man,” and they are bracing themselves for the explosive reaction. Therefore the only way to surprise them is to have no explosion, and the flatter the line the better.\n\nThe laugh comes from the structure of the scene, not the particular line. Would ‘never mind’ have gotten as big a laugh as ‘nobody’s perfect?’ quite possibly.\n\nOne reason why Billy called it a throwaway line was because it had briefly been in the scene where Tony is explaining to Jack why he can’t marry Osgood and was taken out because it stepped on another joke. I don’t imagine it gets as big a laugh now as it used to, the element of surprise is gone.\n\nIz loved that scene. When we were all on a European publicity tour for the picture he used to sneak into the theatre to watch the last few minutes, just so that he could hear that roar of sheer delight as Daphne and Osgood sail into the sunset.\n\nI don’t think he ever really thought of it as a throwaway.”\n\nMEMORIES OF ‘SOME LIKE IT HOT’ – JACK LEMMON\n\n“Most of the mail I get is letters from all over the world talking about “Some Like It Hot.” I would say overall, it’s probably the biggest hit I’ve ever been in, I’m sure. I’ve had films that have grossed more in the beginning, but they’ve had a shorter life; this just keeps on going and going and going.\n\nI think without any hesitation, no hesitation whatsoever-and forgetting the fact that I was in it, because that’s not what really affected the reusult for me–I think it is the best comedy script I have ever read and probably ever will read.”\n\nI just can’t imagine reading a comedy script that could be better. I think that Billy Wilder was at the height of his powers, I think that it’s the equal of the best thing he’s ever done, comedy or drama. I think it’s one of the best films I’ve ever seen.”\n\nJack Lemmon on “Some Like It Hot.”"
