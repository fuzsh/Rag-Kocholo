        "text": "MUSING\n\nApril 18, 2017\n\nStand Still and Wait\n\nSeveral years ago as I was working on a musical project, I wrote these words and I wanted to share them again with you now in a world that has changed from what the world was like twenty years ago. Or has it?\n\nSome night feel like they last forever\n\nEven the moon runs away-\n\nClouds may come and gather from every direction\n\nChasing sweet dreams to another day.\n\nThey snuff out the stars.\n\nThey make you feel afraid,\n\nThese nights with their haunted refrain.\n\nYou may even forget the birds and the flowers\n\nWhile you run in circles –\n\nLost in your running\n\nFar away from angel’s strains.\n\nStand still and wait for the night to pass over\n\nUnder cover of darkness the morning will rise\n\nFrom the east comes the hope\n\nAnd it’s wrapped up in sunlight,\n\nSo rest, close your eyes, and wait one more hour...\n\nI feel like I have been waiting “one more hour” for most of my life, and especially this year. Now it is the Advent Season and this time of year is all about waiting; and in the end, our hope, peace, joy and love are realized in the birth for which we have all been waiting. This joyous new life that is ours no matter how long we have to wait.\n\nIn the world as it has been expressed in 2017, we have waited through so much unexpected: hurricanes and floods in Texas, fires in California, murders in mass shooting all over the country especially big ones in Las Vegas and Sutherland Springs, famines in so many parts of the world, ethnic cleansing, terrorist, sexual harassments, lies and questions in our politics and so much disappointment this year. The seasons of our souls have been soaked in doubt and fear as our hearts are shocked with the kind of surprises that test our faith. What a time!\n\nFriends, my waiting has informed me that this is LIFE as we live it; and my faith also informs me that when we least expect it, God appears and the world seems changed. We recognize that change as we partake on this journey with a friend or a family. How long is that journey? Is it from dark to dawn? During this season, is it all the way back to Bethlehem?\n\nHow far is it to Bethlehem? Not very far.\n\nMay we find the stable room lit by a star?\n\nMay we see the little child? Is he within?\n\nIf we lift the wooden latch, may we come in?\n\nMay we stroke the creatures there,\n\nOx, ass, or sheep?\n\nMay we be like them, and see Jesus asleep?\n\nMay we touch his tiny hand? Will he awake?\n\nWill he know we’ve come so far, just for his sake?\n\nGreat kings have precious gifts,\n\nAnd we have naught.\n\nLittle smiles and little tears\n\nAre all we brought.\n\nFor all weary children Mary must weep\n\n“Here on this bed of straw, sleep, children, sleep.”\n\nGod’s in his mother’s arms,\n\nBabe’s in the byre\n\nSleep as they sleep\n\nWho find their heart’s desire.\n\nI hope my musings will remind you that we have waited so long, come this far. Now, can’t we wait for just one more hour? Our joy comes every day with the dawn.\n\nAnd that is the way I feel,\n\nCynthia\n\nMUSING\n\nApril 18, 2017\n\none\n\none is coming. one is on the way. one is here to maybe change your life. We are one in the Spirit. We are many and we are one.\n\nFinally, the new CD is here. Will and Patti (my sister) and I started this effort over a year ago; and at last, I can show it to you. A close and dear friend told me that this was “perhaps the recording Cynthia always wanted to make.” I cannot tell you how much I personally love every cut, every musician, and every tender and wild thought that went into deciding on these songs.\n\nIn 2015 I was in Santa Fe (the Holy Land) for a couple of weeks and Will said, “Let's do a new CD.”\n\n“O.K.,” I responded. What a landscape and what a land of Spirit in which to create. We found a string player, a pedal steel player, an accordion player, a drummer, some native American back-ups, some middle-eastern sounding instruments, etc., etc. - not to mention The Holy Spirit – and in a week we had recorded an entire album in Will and Melissa's house. A few “nips and tucks” happened in 2016, and...here she is! One.\n\nI really cannot tell you which cut is my favorite, but I will take time over the next few days to tell you why I love each song. There were some interesting stories behind each choice, and I want to share them with you. Some were stolen from my buddy, Janis Ian, one is a prophetic song by David Crosby, one a hymn from Fanny Crosby ( I love all the Crosbys from Fanny to David); and several lyrics to help in healing and gaining in courage “for the living of these days.”\n\nEaster is here. Easter is NOW! Easter is our Forever symbol and song of resurrection! Maybe this year we will all “let go” and accept the fact that the Kingdom has come and joy is ours.\n\nI pray that you will open your ears, yours eyes, and your mind to that truth of new life, and know how much we can be a part of that recognition in each others lives.\n\nRemember: “Some people's lives just need to be KISSED*...”\n\nThis is the way I feel,\n\nCynthia\n\n*(that thought belongs to Janis)\n\nMUSING\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nI sing to use the waiting\n\nMy bonnet but to tie\n\nAnd shut the door into my house\n\nNo more to do have I\n\nTill his best step approaching\n\nWe journey to the day\n\nAnd tell each other how we sung\n\nTo keep the dark away\n\n-Emily Dickinson\n\nI sing to use the waiting... How we sung to keep the dark away. I imagine that was a quiet, airy, sparrow-like sound as opposed to a Maria Calla's empowered vocalese that could cause the heart to tremble. Yes. That would be Emily's style of singing while she waits. Right? Or, who knows? Our sweet, demure Ms. Dickinson might have been a red monster underneath her black and white attire and her waiting cries might have been long, loud and BB King bluesy - But she did say that she sang in the interim... and some days our lives feel like the now, the past and the future all flow together and the interim is all we own. The now in which we must sing. We sing beyond and before fruition. Don't you just love that word? The fruition is out there beckoning us all to keep forging ahead even into the dark. Emily might have been a bit frightened of the dark and more in love with morning, but perhaps she wanted to sing the dark away to hasten up the flight, past the night, to sunrise, to ressurection. Maybe. Perhaps. I love those words, too.\n\nAs some of you know, my father died this Fall and we laid him to rest in the military cemetary on the Marines' birthday. What a day for him and for us! I'm sure he was as proud as we were. My sister and Brother and I sang \"In That Great Gettin' Up Morning\" and Vince Gill's tender \"Go Rest High on That Mountain\" and we sent our Daddy off to shout love for the Father and the Son (And he was a singing, SHOUTING, Marine, if there ever was one.)\n\nThree nights later, I sang a concert in the very same church where we had held his funeral, still a bit stunned from the events of the week, and again, still stunned by grace. Now, as I go on I am stunned by the grief and how it works itself in and out of the song, and the same with the song. Oh, the grace, the gift in the music. \"I sing to use the waiting...\" for the grief to move. Sometimes the grace/song comes wrapped in the sound on the radio. Often it just rises up from my own throat and lands over in my heart so that I can get on with the day, continue the concert, sleep through the night. The song is standing by as a diligent servant waiting for the moment it is needed to provide in the waiting...\n\nOr perhaps the singing itself is like the servant's pleasurable occupation. The waiting for or the waiting until is more about waiting upon Life and Grief and family and friends and our wonderful world full of terror and treasure. We wait and wait, in light and dark, until...\n\nWilliam Cowper was a brilliant writer who lived and died many years ago. It is reported that he was not healthy in his mind. However, I read his lyrics...I wonder how healthy he was and how that is to be measured. Maybe he understood more than we thought...Maybe you can hear his mind, his heart, his song as you wait.\n\nThis is the way I feel.\n\nCynthia\n\nMUSING\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nTo all my friends, family, fellow strugglers, vagabonds, troubadours, lovers of Heaven and Earth:\n\nClowns, singers, and dancers are we\n\nmaking faces for lives full of travesty\n\nsinging songs to the night time,\n\ntoe-tapping at fears\n\nto chase away lions and tigers and bears.\n\nOur legs have grown weary\n\nand our voices are weakened\n\nanother handful of make-up\n\ncannot cover broken hearts\n\nand frustrating dreams.\n\nWhat we need is a vision\n\nof what is to come\n\na kingdom of children led by a Lamb\n\nthat beckons the lion\n\nto lie down in grace\n\nand love the dancers, the singers, the face\n\nof the tear-stained clown\n\nwho is trying to love.\n\nSweet joker,\n\nthat flutter you felt\n\nwas a dove.\n\n-- Cynthia Clawson\n\nLousiville, Kentucky\n\nJanuary 2, 1988\n\nDear Cynthia,\n\nOn the morning of Christmas Eve, as I sat quietly and read the scriptures, I realized for the first time that the names of Christ showed such extremes in his character. As I read \"Lamb of God…\" and \"Lion of Judah\", I thought, surely, even Christ had extreme swings in his personality; and perhaps, when the scripture says, \"Even the lion and lamb shall lie down together\", it means WE are to bring together the extremes of our being and learn to live in peace with all the facets of our individual character.\n\nThere are areas of my personality that I do not feel comfortable with, or hold in great disdain. I so want to have a quiet, contemplative, serene spirit… and although there are times that I show that side of me, more often than not I show my aggressive, gregarious, boisterous side; and I like both sides—the lion in me and the lamb in me—yet, I can't help but believe that the Lord would rather me be more lamb-like than roaring like a lion, most of the time. I Peter 3:3-4 says, \"Let your beauty be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.\"\n\nNow, the question is: how do I pursue a gentle and quiet spirit, without squelching the excessive, unrestrained in me? I want to show foremost the \"fruit of the spirit\" that results in gentleness, meekness, and humility. I find that I adore those persons who evoke in me a gentleness of spirit, yet I usually seek the company of those who allow my raucous, aggressive behavior. Is that because I feel more comfortable with the loud side of me? Or, do I purposefully avoid the quiet, so I do not have to listen to me heart??\n\nMy only new year's resolution is to pursue more time to be reserved, gentle, mild, composed, pacific, quiet, and subdued.\n\nWhen I make my resolutions toward visible things, like lose weight, OR… start a daily exercise regime, OR… get my finances in order, OR… organize all my tax papers, I know from the beginning that not only will I NOT achieve my goals, but there will also be tangible evidence of my failure at the end of the year.\n\nSo, this year, I resolve to seek a quiet spirit and to learn to be more comfortable with the gentle whispers of my heart than the loud, crashing, brazen pronouncements.\n\nI am resolved!\n\nPatti\n\nJanuary 2015:\n\nI recently came across the above excerpts from a stack of correspondence between my sister and me, and I thought maybe some of you could relate to our shared longings. It is 2015 A.D. and I feel like we are all still yearning for the same things we've always wanted—love, joy, peace, and hope for a new world. God bless us all in this common pursuit!\n\n…what we need is a vision\n\nof what is to come\n\na kingdom of children led by a Lamb\n\nthat beckons the lion\n\nto lie down in grace\n\nand love the dancers, the singers, the face\n\nof this tear-stained clown\n\nwho is trying to love.\n\nSweet joker,\n\nthat flutter you felt\n\nwas a dove.\n\nThis is the way I feel,\n\nCynthia"
