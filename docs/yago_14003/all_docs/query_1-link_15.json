        "text": "I wanted to share this at the open mic during the service, I could not quite hear the gentleman who explained it would be skipped. Now I realize I would not have said this much but had more time to share more clearly. So this is a God intended thing.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Stone (yes, I am in my 50’s and you are still Mr. & Mrs.) your family has always been incredibly special to me and will always hold a dear place in my heart.\n\nI remember being in late middle school and this family moved in right ‘next door’ to me. What is important for those who don’t know, I lived out in the ‘country’ of south Jersey, on the edge of the woods with this large field and property next to us with a ranch house. So, to have a family move in right next door, with a son my age who I quickly connected with, was very random and awesome. What I didn’t know at first, but learned quickly, was what you were also a family who loved and lived for Christ and shared the similar values that I had been taught in my home.\n\nWhat I also quickly realized was that my new friend Mike had a sister Cindy with significant special needs. I am not sure if I even knew anyone at that time in my life with disabilities or any other special needs. But during these years of my life I realized that ‘normal’ is overrated, and that ‘special’ is an understatement.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Stone, as those crucial years went on, you taught me so much about life, living and loving. I remember vividly all the times in your home, vacations you invited me on, day trips, parks, lakes, boating, special events, family parties where I was grafted in as part of your family. I remember the challenge Mike and I would have of where we would have diner after hanging out all afternoon, and it really came down to who’s Mom was making a better dinner that day and what we were in the mood for. In all of it, you consistently demonstrated a level of love, care and sacrifice that most rarely witness.\n\nI remember the exercises you talked about during the service with Cindy, the intense care you gave her everyday, the feeing, times I got to help, make her smile. I remember the inclusion that was just ‘normal’ with her engaged in every facet of life. I remember when she was able to get one of her first ‘typewriters’ that she could use to express herself by jerking up her knee on the correct letter. I remember how intelligent she showed herself to be and how much I just didn’t know her capabilities, I was so ignorant. Your relentless love and care did not seem like a burden at all to you, and your daily sacrifice you never showed as a sacrifice.\n\nI realized and remembered so much this Saturday at the celebration of Cindy’s life. After greeting your family, instead of sitting on my phone waiting, I just sat there and watched the pictures, soaked it in, shed some tears and let the Lord bring to the surface so many memories and feelings. He used that time and the service to help me reflect on my life now and the impact you had.\n\nYour example to me has truly marked me for life and I know that my compassion, love and engagement to those in need is a big reflection and result of you. I can’t help but think that partly because of you, God burdened and prepared me for adoption of 2 of our 4 kids.\n\nI am so thankful God put Mike in my life, he was one of my greatest friends and I miss him so much. Meeting his son now as an adult was pretty overwhelming, it was so good to talk with him and give him a hug.\n\nBut I also realized yet again that God wanted your entire family in my life as a teen and young adult, you as parents, Mike and all 3 sisters. Cindy was such a precious person and the thought of her smile still makes me smile. I am so glad I was able to be at the service this weekend to hear more of what her adult life was like, how God used her and more of her story since our lives went different ways. I loved hearing of her love for the Lord, music and the lost. I laughed so hard at the celebration of her determination and stubbornness, I remember witnessing that first hand It is so cool how God uses those traits for good and He did with Cindy.\n\nThank you for loving Jesus and your family the way God designed, and modeling it well for your other kids. I can’t even imagine the last 46 years for you, but I know your kingdom impact is wide and strong. Thank you for welcoming me into your family all those years. Thank you for letting Jesus use you to make others better even when you were only doing what you wanted to as parents.\n\nMay God continue to richly bless you in the days and years to come in your new ‘normal’, which again, is so overrated.\n\nLove you all, Nick Miller"
