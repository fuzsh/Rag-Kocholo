If you want to install it immediately, you can use the \"versions\" page:\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus/versions/\n\nHopefully that resolves all compatibility issues with Firefox 40.\n\nHi ccshannon, the new version of Tab Mix Plus (0.4.1.9) is pending approval by the Add-ons site.

If you're on 40.0 like me, see the link jscher2000 provides to the latest dev version. Install it.\n\nIn your TMP settings, go to the Events tab.\n\nThere is a section of checkboxes that will open a new tab if you type or click certain components in FF: Location bar, Search bar, History, Bookmarks.
