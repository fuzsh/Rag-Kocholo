        "text": "Long story short, I'm working on building the debian/copyright file for a massive package, and have ran into the following rather confusing phrase in the copyright header of one of the source code files:\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nSeems straightforward, right? Welp, guess what. There is no GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.\n\nThere's the GNU Library General Public License version 2, and there's the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1. The two licenses are different.\n\nSo... what license is this code under anyway? On one hand, maybe the user thought \"LGPL-2\" referenced a \"Lesser General Public License version 2\" and put that there without verifying that the license they were naming really existed. On the other hand, perhaps the use of the word \"Lesser\" rather than \"Library\" indicates that they mean LGPL-2.1.\n\nThankfully, the escape clause \"or (at your option) any later version\" has been given here, so I can call it LGPL-2.1 if all else fails and I should still be close enough to right. But still, I'd like to know if I'm just missing something, or if this really is ambiguous.\n\nSince you just want confirmation that you're seeing the issue correctly (and let's face it, we all need that at some time or another!), I can confirm my view that the rightsholders have conflated the naming schemes of two different versions of the LGPL, the GNU Library General Public License, version 2.0, and the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1. If memory serves, the principal difference between the two is the name change, which was intended to stop people thinking that the licence was for libraries, and start them thinking that it was for less-copyleft-protected software.\n\nYour comment that their designation of Lesser GPL v2.0+ allows you to unambiguously use it under Lesser GPL v2.1 (or, indeed, v3) seems an excellent way of sidestepping the problem of there being no Lesser GPL v2.0.\n\nI don't think we can say any more than that here, and you've indicated that that's what you wanted to know.\n\nanswered Sep 5, 2022 at 7:07\n\nMadHatterâ™¦MadHatter\n\n50.6k44 gold badges127127 silver badges173173 bronze badges"
