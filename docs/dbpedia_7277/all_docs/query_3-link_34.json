        "text": "There's a freeware clone of Avant Garde in light and bold weights called TeX Gyre Adventor. I recommend using this as the easiest substitute. It has one limitation: it doesn't include the crazy alternate capital ligatures of Avant Garde.â€  But it's the easiest simple option.\n\nA very good option if you want to pay a little more is Avalon, which is based on Avant Garde and includes all the weights. It's $13.95 for 5 computers and 14 styles, which is excellent value. Both of these are based on digitizations of ITC Avant Garde renamed for legal reasons. (Font designs aren't trademarked, although their names are.)\n\nBack to your original question-IANAL. Macs don't come with ITC Avant Garde, they would have been bought with some software package. You probably want to look at where that software package came from and its licensing. It may be cross-platform and you may be able to install it on another computer; it may not.\n\nOne thing to point out to your bosses is that if you're not your organization's professional graphic designer, you shouldn't need to use the corporate fonts. It's quite common for organizations to use one font for branding and marketing and another (e.g. Arial) for internal communications which doesn't need to be to such a high design standard. Indeed there are good reasons for this; basic fonts like Arial and Times New Roman have bulletproof character sets which cover most major languages (e.g. correct spelling of Czech, Vietnamese and Polish authors' names); branding fonts often don't."
