        "text": "Linux kernel licensing rules¶\n\nThe Linux Kernel is provided under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 only (GPL-2.0), as provided in LICENSES/preferred/GPL-2.0, with an explicit syscall exception described in LICENSES/exceptions/Linux-syscall-note, as described in the COPYING file.\n\nThis documentation file provides a description of how each source file should be annotated to make its license clear and unambiguous. It doesn’t replace the Kernel’s license.\n\nThe license described in the COPYING file applies to the kernel source as a whole, though individual source files can have a different license which is required to be compatible with the GPL-2.0:\n\nAside from that, individual files can be provided under a dual license, e.g. one of the compatible GPL variants and alternatively under a permissive license like BSD, MIT etc.\n\nThe User-space API (UAPI) header files, which describe the interface of user-space programs to the kernel are a special case. According to the note in the kernel COPYING file, the syscall interface is a clear boundary, which does not extend the GPL requirements to any software which uses it to communicate with the kernel. Because the UAPI headers must be includable into any source files which create an executable running on the Linux kernel, the exception must be documented by a special license expression.\n\nThe common way of expressing the license of a source file is to add the matching boilerplate text into the top comment of the file. Due to formatting, typos etc. these “boilerplates” are hard to validate for tools which are used in the context of license compliance.\n\nAn alternative to boilerplate text is the use of Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) license identifiers in each source file. SPDX license identifiers are machine parsable and precise shorthands for the license under which the content of the file is contributed. SPDX license identifiers are managed by the SPDX Workgroup at the Linux Foundation and have been agreed on by partners throughout the industry, tool vendors, and legal teams.
