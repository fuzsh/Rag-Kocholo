Please have your say.\n\nUbuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx)\n\nIntroduction\n\nOn April 29, 2010, Ubuntu 10.04 was released.\n\nIt is code named Lucid Lynx and is the successor to Karmic Koala (9.10) (Karmic+1).\n\nLucid Lynx is an LTS (Long Term Support) release. It will be supported with security updates until April 2013 for the desktop version and until April 2015 for the server version.\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nGeneral Notes\n\nThis is the original Ubuntuguide. You are free to copy this guide but not to sell it or any derivative of it. Copyright of the names Ubuntuguide and Ubuntu Guide reside solely with this site. This guide is neither sold nor distributed in any other medium. Beware of copies that are for sale or are similarly named; they are neither endorsed nor sanctioned by this guide. Ubuntuguide is not associated with Canonical Ltd nor with any commercial enterprise.\n\nUbuntu allows a user to accomplish tasks from either a menu-driven Graphical User Interface (GUI) or from a text-based command-line interface (CLI). In Ubuntu, the command-line-interface terminal is called Terminal, which is started: Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal.\n\nText inside the grey dotted box like this should be put into the command-line Terminal.\n\nMany changes to the operating system can only be done by a User with Administrative privileges. 'sudo' elevates a User's privileges to the Administrator level temporarily (i.e. when installing programs or making changes to the system). Example:\n\nsudo bash\n\n'gksudo' should be used instead of 'sudo' when opening a Graphical Application through the \"Run Command\" dialog box. Example:\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\"man\" command can be used to find help manual for a command. For example, \"man sudo\" will display the manual page for the \"sudo\" command:\n\nman sudo\n\nWhile \"apt-get\" and \"aptitude\" are fast ways of installing programs/packages, you can also use the Synaptic Package Manager, a GUI method for installing programs/packages. Most (but not all) programs/packages available with apt-get install will also be available from the Synaptic Package Manager. In this guide, when you see\n\nsudo apt-get install package\n\nyou can search for package in Synaptic and install it that way.\n\nMany instructions use the text editor \"nano\" (which is universally available in Linux). However, it is often easier to use the text editor \"gedit\" in Ubuntu instead.\n\n\"Applications\" means the bottom-left (or upper-left) button, akin to the Start button in Microsoft Windows.\n\nIf you are using the 64-bit version, replace any \"i386\" with \"amd64\"\n\nOther versions\n\nHow to find out which version of Ubuntu you're using\n\nOpen the command terminal and type:\n\nlsb_release -a\n\nHow to find out which kernel you are using\n\nuname -r\n\nNewer Versions of Ubuntu\n\nUbuntu has a six month release cycle, with releases in April and October.\n\nMaverick Meerkat (10.10), scheduled for release in October 2010. This will not be an LTS version.\n\nOlder Versions of Ubuntu\n\nKarmic Koala (9.10) (supported until April 2011)\n\nJaunty Jackalope (9.04) (supported until October 2010)\n\nIntrepid Ibex (8.10) (no longer supported)\n\nHardy Heron (8.04 LTS) (Long Term Support version with desktop support until April 2011 and server support until April 2013)\n\nDapper Drake (6.06 LTS) (Long Term Support for server until June 2011; desktop no longer supported)\n\nSee this complete list of older and newer versions.\n\nOther Resources\n\nUbuntu Forums has a large community for online solutions and specific help.\n\nUbuntu Resources\n\nGnome Project\n\nGnome is the default desktop in Ubuntu.\n\nUbuntu Screenshots and Screencasts\n\nWhat is Ubuntu?\n\nUbuntu 10.04 3D Desktop and other YouTube videos.\n\nNew Applications Resources\n\nGetDeb - Features the latest versions of software available from the official repositories as well as software not available in the official repositories. Available in easy-to-install .deb files (see Apt and Package Basics).\n\nTop 100 Open source Applications\n\nDaily Ubuntu Applications\n\nSee our full list of add-on applications.\n\nOther *buntu guides and help manuals\n\nKubuntuguide\n\nLubuntu -- Lubuntu can run with as little as 256 Mb RAM. It is better for older machines with limited resources.\n\nofficial Ubuntu Server Guide -- a good starting reference for server packages\n\nUbuntu Doctors Guild -- a collection of tips for using (K)ubuntu Linux in health care environments\n\nSkoleLinux -- a collection of (open-source) educational tools for Debian/Ubuntu Linux\n\nInstalling Ubuntu\n\nWarning: Ubuntu Desktop edition installer no longer allows a custom installation of GRUB, and it now uses GRUB2 (which allows very little customization). DO NOT USE the Lucid Lynx Desktop edition if you use a boot partition, use multiple OS (more than 2), or chainload bootloaders. The Ubuntu installer will overwrite your Master Boot Record and you will later be forced to recreate it manually. This is a serious flaw in both Karmic Koala and Lucid Lynx. Use the Ubuntu Server edition instead (and then later add the ubuntu-desktop).\n\nGRUB2 has caused major problems in installation -- be sure to research the issue before upgrading to Lucid Lynx.\n\nHardware requirements\n\nUbuntu Lucid Lynx runs well with as little as 384 Mb RAM. (The installer requires a minimum of 256 Mb RAM, while the alternative installer can run using only 192 Mb RAM.) Netbooks can run Ubuntu Lucid Lynx.\n\nThe install takes between 3-4 Gb hard drive space, and 8 - 10 Gb will be needed to run comfortably.\n\nIf you have an older computer with less memory than this, consider Lubuntu (if between 256 Mb and 512 Mb RAM) or PuppyLinux or DSL (if less than 256 Mb RAM).\n\nFresh Installation\n\nDownload the latest ISO image from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.\n\nSee this guide for burning the ISO image to a CD (\"LiveCD\").\n\nUse the LiveCD for installation.\n\nAn alternate method involves installing the server version first and then installing the Ubuntu desktop.\n\nDual-Booting Windows and Ubuntu\n\nRarely, a user may experience problems dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows. In general, a Windows OS should be installed first, because its bootloader is very particular. A Windows installation usually occupies the entire hard drive, so the partition needs to be shrunk, creating free space for the Ubuntu partition. (You should clean up unnecessary files and defragment the drive before resizing.) See changing the Windows partition size.\n\nAfter shrinking the Windows partition, you should reboot once into Windows prior to installing Ubuntu or further manipulating the partitions. This allows the Windows system to automatically rescan the newly-resized partition (using chkdsk) and write changes to its own bootup files. (If you forget to do this, you may later have to repair the Windows partition bootup files manually using the Windows Recovery Console.)\n\nIf done this way, there is no problem installing Ubuntu as the second operating system and it is done automatically from the Ubuntu LiveCD. Allow the Ubuntu LiveCD to install to \"largest available free space.\"\n\nA Windows partition should be at least 20 Gb (recommended 30 Gb for Vista/Windows 7), and a Ubuntu partition at least 10 Gb (recommended 20 Gb). Obviously, if you have plenty of disk space, make the partition for whichever will be your favoured operating system larger. For a recommended partitioning scheme, see this section.\n\nAlternatives include:\n\nWubi (Windows-based Ubuntu Installer), an officially supported dual-boot installer that allows Ubuntu to be run mounted in a virtual-disk within the Windows environment (which can cause a slight degradation in performance). Because the installation requires an intact functioning Windows system, it is recommended to install Ubuntu in this manner for short-term evaluation purposes only. A permanent Ubuntu installation should be installed in its own partition, with its own filesystem, and should not rely on Windows.\n\nEasyBCD, a free Windows-based program that allows you to dual-boot Windows Vista and Ubuntu (as well as other operating systems) by configuring the Vista bootloader.\n\nInstalling multiple OS on a single computer\n\nWarning: The Ubuntu Desktop edition LiveCD installer no longer allows a custom installation of GRUB, and it now uses GRUB2 (which is difficult to customize). DO NOT USE the Lucid Lynx Desktop edition LiveCD as an installer if you use a boot partition, use more than 2 operating systems, or chainload bootloaders. The Ubuntu installer will overwrite your Master Boot Record and you will later be forced to recreate it. This is a serious flaw in both Karmic Koala and Lucid Lynx Desktop edition installers. Use the Ubuntu Server edition instead (and then later add the ubuntu-desktop).\n\nIf you want to install more than 2 operating systems on a single computer, check out these tips.\n\nUse Startup Manager to change Grub settings\n\nGrub is the bootup utility that controls which OS to load by default and other bootup settings. You can change Grub settings from the Startup Manager:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Startup Manager\n\nIf Startup Manager is not installed, install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install startupmanager\n\nNote: You can also edit the Grub settings manually from the command-line interface.\n\nDual-Booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu\n\nAlso see these tips for installing multiple OS.\n\nMac OS X has a similar structure to Linux (it is BSD Unix based). Dual-booting Mac OS X and Ubuntu detailed instructions can be found here.\n\nInstalling Mac OS X after Ubuntu\n\nIf you decide to dual boot with OS X, choose ext2 as your partition type during the Ubuntu installation. (For this the Super Grub Disk CD is a useful utility. You can download the Super Grub .iso image file at forjamari.linex.org and burn the image to a CD-ROM.)\n\nOnce you have installed Ubuntu, edit the Grub start-up list:\n\nsudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\nand add the following lines:\n\ntitle Mac OS X root (hd0,0) makeactive chainloader +1\n\nReboot your Mac and go to the terminal in Max OS X (if you have any issues booting, boot from your Mac OS X DVD). Press F8 and enter -s. Enter:\n\nfdisk -e /dev/rdisk0 flag 2 <--note that flag 2 is my Mac partition number two quit y reboot\n\nIf are still unsure whether it is working correctly, use the Super Grub Disk CD and make grub active.\n\nInstalling Ubuntu after Mac OS X\n\nIf you get an error message during boot such as HFS+error in the bootloader, you can also use the Super Grub Disk for recovering Linux GRUB and the Windows MBR (Master Boot Record).\n\nOnce you have installed Ubuntu, edit the Grub start-up list:\n\nsudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst\n\nand add the following lines:\n\ntitle Mac OS X root (hd0,0) makeactive chainloader +1\n\nIf you have issues with Mac OSX or Windows in GRUB, try changing the Mac OS X Grub entry\n\nchange root (hd0,0) to root (hd0,1)\n\nThis means you will boot into partition number 1. You can try any partition number until you get it right.\n\nUpgrading Jaunty or Karmic to Lucid\n\nAlso see the official Ubuntu desktop upgrade documentation.\n\nThere are several methods for upgrades from the command-line interface (Terminal) (which can be used for both the desktop and server editions of Ubuntu/Kubuntu).\n\nThis is the preferred method:\n\nsudo apt-get install update-manager-core sudo do-release-upgrade\n\nYou can also use the update-manager (all editions):\n\nsudo apt-get install update-manager sudo update-manager -d\n\nYou can also use:\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n(Note: the first two lines simply make sure your current distribution is current before upgrading the entire distribution, and are optional.\n\nReinstalling applications after a fresh install\n\nIf you upgrade your Ubuntu system with a fresh install, it is possible to mark the packages and services installed on your old system (prior to the upgrade) and save the settings (\"markings\") into a file. Then install the new version of Ubuntu and allow the system to reinstall packages and services using the settings saved in the \"markings\" file. For instructions, see this Ubuntu forum thread. In brief:\n\nOn the old system: Synaptic Package Manager -> File -> Save Markings\n\nSave the markings file to an external medium, such as USB drive.\n\nComplete the backup of your system's other important files (e.g. the /home directory) before the fresh install of the new system.\n\nIn the freshly installed new system, again open Synaptic Package Manager -> File -> Read markings and load the file on your USB drive (or other external storage) previously saved.\n\nNote: Many packages, dependencies, and compatibilities change between version of Ubuntu, so this method does not always work. Automated updates remains the recommended method.\n\nAdd Extra Repositories\n\nSoftware packages and programs are freely available for download at multiple online sites with standardized structures, called repositories. There are repositories officially sanctioned and monitored by the Kubuntu/Ubuntu developer community, while other repositories are independently provided, without official sanction or supervision (and should be used with caution). Additional information is available from the Ubuntu Repository Guide.\n\nTypes of Repositories\n\nThere are four major package repository types in Ubuntu:\n\nmain - Supported by Canonical. This is the major part of the distribution.\n\nrestricted - Software not licensed under the GPL (or similar software license), but supported by Canonical.\n\nuniverse - Software licensed under the GPL (or similar license) and supported by users.\n\nmultiverse - Software not licensed under the GPL (or similar license), but supported by users.\n\nThere are also these additional types of repositories:\n\nLucid-updates - Updates to official packages.\n\nLucid-backports - Current version software from Karmic+1 (Lucid) that have been backported to Karmic Koala.\n\nLucid-proposed - Proposed updates & changes (bleeding edge stuff).\n\nThird party repositories\n\nSoftware developers often maintain their own repositories, from which software packages can be downloaded and installed directly to your computer (if you add the repository to your list). Many of these third party repositories and software packages have never been reviewed by the (K)Ubuntu/Debian community and can present a security risk to your computer. Trojans, backdoors, and other malicious software can be present at any unregulated repository. When using repositories not endorsed by the (K)ubuntu/Debian community, make sure you have utter confidence in that site before enabling the repository and installing a software package from it.\n\nAdd Repositories using Synaptic Package Manager\n\nThis is the preferred method.\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager -> Settings -> Repositories.\n\nHere you can enable the repositories for Ubuntu Software and Third Party Software.\n\nFor Third Party Software select Add -> enter the repository's address. It will have a format similar to:\n\ndeb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted deb-src http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted\n\nExample: To add the Medibuntu repository, Add:\n\ndeb http://packages.medibuntu.org/ lucid free non-free\n\nDownload the repository key to a folder.\n\nExample: The Medibuntu key can be downloaded from\n\nhttp://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg\n\nThen add the key from:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager -> Settings -> Repositories -> Authentication -> Import Key File...\n\n(Alternatively, you can manually add the key from the command line Terminal. See Add Repository keys.)\n\nRefresh the package list from the new repository:\n\nSynaptic -> Reload\n\nManually add repositories\n\nDo this at your own risk. Modify the default Ubuntu sources.list only if you understand what you're doing. Mixing repositories can break your system. For more information see the Ubuntu Command-line Repository guide.\n\nCreate a backup of your current list of sources.\n\nsudo cp -i /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list_backup\n\nNote: sudo - runs the command with root privileges. cp = copy. -i = prompt to overwrite if a file already exists.\n\nEdit the list of sources:\n\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nor using a graphical editor:\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nNote: To use your local mirror you can add \"xx.\" before archive.ubuntu.com, where xx = your country code.\n\nExample: deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu licid main restricted universe multiverse indicates a repository for Great Britain (gb).\n\nHere is a sample sources.list. At the end have been added repositories for Medibuntu and Google:\n\n#deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 10.04 LTS _Lucid Lynx_ - Release i386 (20100429)]/ lucid main restricted # See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to # newer versions of the distribution. deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid main restricted ## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the ## distribution. deb http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates main restricted deb-src http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid-updates main restricted ## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu ## team.

See Add repository keys.\n\nRefresh the packages list from the new repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nAdd repository keys\n\nDownload the gpg keys for the repositories and automatically add them to your repository keyring:\n\nExample: To obtain and add the Medibuntu repository key:\n\nwget --quiet http://packages.medibuntu.org/medibuntu-key.gpg -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nExample: To obtain and add the Google repository key:\n\nwget --quiet http://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nNote: wget - retrieves a file from a network location. --quiet = no output. -O = Output downloaded item to terminal. The | (pipe symbol) is used to capture the output from the previous command (in our case the screen) and use it as an input for the piped command (i.e. apt-key, which adds it to the keyring).\n\nAlternatively (and perhaps more easily), you can use apt-key directly:\n\nsudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys KEY\n\nwhere KEY is the missing key code printed in apt-get output, e.g. EF4186FE247510BE.\n\nNote: Key servers often use port 11371. Make sure your firewall allows port 11371 to be open.\n\nApt and Package Basics\n\nRead Add Extra Repositories\n\nMost new users will use the Synaptic Package Manager to install packages. These instructions are for installing packages from the command-line Terminal. Terminal can be started:\n\nApplications -> Accessories -> Terminal\n\nInstall packages:\n\nsudo apt-get install packagename\n\nExample:\n\nsudo apt-get install mpd sbackup\n\nRemove packages:\n\nsudo apt-get remove packagename\n\nTo remove all dependencies:\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nExample:\n\nsudo apt-get remove mpd sbackup\n\nSearch for packages:\n\napt-cache search <keywords>\n\nExamples:\n\napt-cache search Music MP3 apt-cache search \"Text Editor\"\n\nUpdate the apt package database after adding/removing repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nUpgrade packages:\n\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nUpgrade the entire distribution (e.g. from Karmic to Lucid):\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nInstalling .deb packages\n\nDebian (.deb) packages are the packages that are used in Ubuntu. You can install any .deb package in your system. .deb files can generally be installed from your file manager (Nautilus) merely by clicking on them, since file associations with the default installer is already set in Ubuntu. These instructions are for those who wish to install packages from the command-line terminal (Terminal).\n\nInstall a downloaded Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb):\n\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nRemove a Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb):\n\nsudo dpkg -r packagename\n\nReconfigure/Repair an installed Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb):\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure packagename\n\n*Example:\n\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure mpd\n\nHandling (Tar/GZip) and (Tar/Bzip2) archives\n\n(Tar/GZip) archives end in \".tar.gz\" and (Tar/Bzip2) archives end in \".tar.bz2\". Bzip2 is the newer, more efficient compression method. These files can generally be automatically extracted by merely clicking on them from your file manager (Nautilus), since file associations with the appropriate archival utilities are set by default in Ubuntu. These instructions are for those who wish to use the command line Terminal.\n\nTo extract:\n\ntar xvf packagename.tar.gz\n\nNote: tar is an application which can extract files from an archive, decompressing if necessary.\n\n-x means extract.\n\n-v means verbose (list what it is extracting).\n\n-f specifies the file to use.\n\nDecompressing \".gz\" files\n\ngunzip file.gz\n\nDecompressing \".bz2\" files\n\nbunzip2 file.bz2\n\nNote: You can also decompress a package first by using the command gunzip (for .gz) or bunzip2 (for .bz2), leaving the .tar file. You would then use tar to extract it.\n\nTo create a .gz archive:\n\ntar cvfz packagename.tar.gz folder\n\nTo create a .bz2 archive:\n\ntar cvfj packagename.tar.bz2 folder\n\nInstalling a package from source\n\nMake sure you have all the necessary development tools (i.e. libraries, compilers, headers):\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nNote: \"uname -r\" lists the current kernel you are using\n\nExtract the archive that contains the source files:\n\ntar xvf sourcefilesarchive.tar.gz\n\nBuild the package using the package's script (in this case the configure script), compile the package (make), and install the compiled package into your system (make install):\n\ncd /path/to/extracted/sourcefiles ./configure sudo make sudo make install\n\nNote: typing ./ before a filename in the current folder allows the Linux shell to try and execute the file as an application even if it is not in the path (the set of folders which it searches when you type a command name). If you get a \"permission denied\" error, the file is not marked as being executable. To fix this:\n\nsudo chmod +x filename\n\nExample: In the above instructions, configure is the shell script to build the package from source. To be sure the configure script is executable:\n\nsudo chmod +x configure\n\nCreate a .deb package from source files\n\nIf your build from source is successful, you can make a Debian (Ubuntu) package (.deb) for future use:\n\nInstall package tools:\n\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nRebuild package using \"checkinstall\":\n\ncd /path/to/extracted/package ./configure sudo make sudo checkinstall\n\nKeep the resulting \".deb\" file for future use. It can later be installed using:\n\nsudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\n\nNote: These are basic instructions that may not always work. Some packages require additional dependencies and optional parameters to be specified in order to build them successfully. Also see these Ubuntu wiki instructions.\n\nAptitude\n\nAptitude is a terminal-based package manager that can be used instead of apt-get. Aptitude marks packages that are automatically installed and removes them when no packages depend on them. This makes it easy to remove applications completely. To use Aptitude, replace apt-get with aptitude in the command line. Example:\n\nsudo aptitude install packagename sudo aptitude remove packagename sudo aptitude update sudo aptitude upgrade\n\nFor an ncurses-based graphical user interface, type\n\nsudo aptitude\n\nFor more information, see the aptitude documentation.\n\nSynaptic Package Manager\n\nWhile \"apt-get\" and \"aptitude\" are fast ways of installing programs/packages, you can also use the Synaptic Package Manager (System -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager), a GUI method for installing programs/packages. Most (but not all) programs/packages available with apt-get install will also be available from the Synaptic Package Manager. This is the preferred method for most desktop users. In this guide, when you see\n\nsudo apt-get install package\n\nyou can simply search for package in Synaptic and install it that way.\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager\n\nSearch for the name of the program/package. You can also search for a word in its description.\n\nCheck the box \"Mark for Installation\"\n\nClick the \"Apply\" button.\n\nThe selected program(s) will be automatically installed, along with its dependencies.\n\nAdd/Remove Programs\n\nNot all packages available from apt-get, aptitude, and Synaptic Package Manager are available in Add/Remove Programs. However, it is the easiest interface for new users of Ubuntu and directs them to preferred packages.\n\nApplications -> Add/Remove Programs\n\nSearch for the sort of program you want to add. Example: type MP3 to see a list of mp3 software.\n\nCheck the box \"Mark for Installation\"\n\nClick the \"Apply\" button.\n\nThe selected program(s) will be automatically installed.\n\nRead General Notes\n\nRead Add Extra Repositories\n\nManually, from Terminal (command line interface):\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nor\n\nUse Synaptic Package Manager:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager -> \"Reload\" then \"Mark all upgrades\"\n\nIf there are packages available for updating, you will be prompted whether to install them.\n\nUse Synaptic Package Manager:\n\nSystem -> Administration -> Synaptic Manager -> Settings -> Preferences -> General -> Reloading Outdated Package Information -> Automatic\n\nDesktop Add-ons\n\nThere are many add-on icons, themes, wallpapers, 3-D effects, and other customizations available for the GNOME desktop.\n\nGnome Eye-Candy Resources\n\nGnome Look has wallpapers, splash screens, icons, and themes for windows managers (including Metacity and Compiz) and other applications.\n\nUbuntu Wallpaper\n\nDownload free Lucid Lynx wallpapers.\n\nChange Plymouth Splash Screen\n\nThis is the initial splash screen you see at bootup. Different Plymouth themes can be found by searching for plymouth-theme in a Package Manager. Install a new one and then:\n\nsudo update-alternatives --config default.plymouth sudo update-initramfs -u\n\nand manually select the theme you wish to use.\n\nPlymouth does not reliably work with nVidia drivers and during bootup a blank screen may result for several seconds.\n\nMetacity\n\nMetacity is the default desktop compositing manager in Gnome. It is lightweight, streamlined and does not have many configurable options, but has multiple themes available at Gnome Look.\n\nCompiz Fusion\n\nCompiz Fusion is available as a separate Windows Manager, to allow advanced desktop effects such as the rotating cube desktop. Many Ubuntu users choose to run Compiz, which is quite fast in Ubuntu. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-fusion-plugins-extra emerald librsvg2-common\n\nTo change to Compiz as the Window Manager:\n\nSelect Compiz Configuration:\n\nSystem -> Preferences -> CompizConfig Settings Manager\n\nNote: You must logout and log back in for the change to take effect.\n\nFusion Icon\n\nFusion Icon is a tray icon that allows you to easily switch between window managers, window decorators, and gives you quick access to the Compiz Settings Manager. This allows quick toggling of 3-D desktop effects (that may not be compatible with some applications).\n\nsudo apt-get install fusion-icon\n\nApplications -> System Tools -> Compiz Fusion Icon\n\nYou can then easily access CompizConfig Settings Manager from the icon.\n\nRotate the Compiz Cube\n\nSet the CompizConfig Settings Manager to enable the \"Desktop Cube\" and \"Rotate Cube\" and \"Viewport Switcher\" options. Click on the icon for each to customize settings. For example, to change the appearance of the cube, click on the Desktop Cube icon to access its settings. You can set the hotkey buttons for rotating the cube in the \"Viewport Switcher\" settings. Otherwise, hold down the Ctrl+Alt+Left mouse button and drag the mouse (or touchpad) the direction you want to rotate the cube.\n\nRemember, the cube rotates between desktops. It's not a cube unless you have at least 4 desktops running. You will not get a cube if you are only using 2 desktops (you will get a \"plate\"). You can still rotate the sides of the plate, of course, but it will not be a cube. (Recent users from the Windows OS may have no experience with the concept of simultaneous desktops, but they are nice once you learn how to use them).\n\nWhen running Compiz fusion as the Windows Manager, you must change the default number of desktops from within CompizConfig Settings Manger. To enable 4 desktops:\n\nCompizConfig Settings Manager -> General -> General Options -> Desktop Size -> Horizontal Virtual Size -> 4\n\nWhen you start an application, you can assign it to any one of the 4 desktops by right-clicking the upper left corner of the application window and choosing the \"To Desktop...\" option. Rotating the cube shows the different desktops. You can also go to a desktop using the taskbar icon which shows the 4 desktops.\n\nEmerald\n\nEmerald is the theme engine for Compiz Fusion. Multiple themes are available. (These themes originated from the Beryl project before it merged with Compiz to form Compiz Fusion.) The Emerald Theme Manager for Compiz Fusion can be installed:\n\nsudo apt-get install emerald\n\nGoogle Desktop\n\nGoogle Desktop for Linux is a proprietary suite of widgets and applications to give Google control over your computer and thereby allow you to use Google services. A .deb package can be downloaded and installed from Google Linux Downloads. For installation instructions, see Google Desktop for Linux Instructions.\n\ngDesklets\n\ngDesklets are similar to Windows widgets and Google gadgets and provide information such as weather, system resources, and news. For more information refer to this gdesklet installation tutorial. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install gdesklets\n\nDock applications\n\nAvant Window Manager, Cairo Dock, gnome-do and Wbar are dock-like applications for Ubuntu Linux. A dock represents running programs as icons at the bottom of the screen (as is done on the Mac OS X desktop), instead of by toolbar panel segments (as is done in Windows and other Linux window managers). See this brief comparison of dock applications.\n\nAvant Window Navigator\n\nAvant Window Navigator requires that a desktop composition manager (such as Metacity, Compiz, Xcompmgr, KDE4 (Kubuntu), or xfwm4 (Xubuntu)) be installed and running.\n\nInstall and upgrade proprietary nVidia or ATI graphics drivers so that the compositing manager functions properly.\n\nInstall AWN:\n\nsudo apt-get install avant-window-navigator awn-manager\n\n(Note: If you are using Gnome (Ubuntu) and do not already have a compositing manager installed (such as Compiz), Metacity will be installed as part of the installation.)\n\nEnable automatic startup of AWN at bootup:\n\nMenu -> System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications -> Add...\n\navant-window-navigator\n\nSelect which applets should run from the dock menu by default:\n\nMenu -> Applications -> Accessories -> Avant Window Navigator Manager\n\nYou can drag application icons onto the list, then activate or deactivate the applets from the list.\n\nCairo Dock\n\nCairo Dock can be used either with a desktop compositing manager (such as Metacity for Gnome, Compiz, or the KDE4 Window Manager) or without one. See the Ubuntu installation instructions for details. It is available from the repositories:\n\nsudo apt-get install cairo-dock cairo-dock-plug-ins\n\nGnome Do\n\nGnome Do is a docking utility for Gnome. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install gnome-do\n\nFrom the preferences pane of gnome-do select the Docky look and feel to get the dock (rather than the default Quicksilver-like) look and feel.\n\nwbar\n\nwbar is a quick-launch bar (not a dock) that has an appearance similar to Avant Window Manager and Cairo Dock. It is GTK (Gnome) based but can work in all desktop environments. It does not require a compositing manager to be installed and is therefore quicker and more suitable for low-end hardware systems. It is the default in the Google gOS desktop and is available as a .deb package from Google. Download and install (from the command-line Terminal):\n\nwget http://wbar.googlecode.com/files/wbar_1.3.3_i386.deb sudo dpkg -i wbar_1.3.3_i386.deb\n\nStart wbar with custom start options (e.g. by pressing alt+F2). Here is an example:\n\nwbar -isize 48 -j 1 -p bottom -balfa 40 -bpress -nanim 3 -z 2.5 -above-desk\n\nHere is another example:\n\nwbar -above-desk -pos bottom -isize 60 -nanim 1 -bpress -jumpf 0.0 -zoomf 1.5\n\nFor a full list of command-line startup options, see:\n\nwbar --help\n\nTip: If you want the \"wave\" effect just increase the -nanim value. I like the icons to just pop up so I don't use it, but with 9 icons 5 there is a nice \"wave\" effect.\n\nObviously, you could create a menu item with the command line options (similar to the examples above), or a batch file that can be automatically started at system startup (as a cron event or startup session).\n\nYou can also change wbar startup options by editing the configuration file:\n\nsudo gedit /usr/share/wbar/dot.wbar\n\nSee this example configuration file. However, not all options are able to be set from the configuration file and must be run from the command line. For more info see this wbar guide.\n\nwbarconf\n\nA simple wbar configuration utility can be downloaded as a .deb package and installed:\n\nwget http://koti.kapsi.fi/~ighea/wbarconf/wbarconf_0.7.2-1_i386.deb sudo dpkg -i wbarconf_0.7.2-1_i386.deb\n\nVirtualization\n\nVirtualization allows a second operating system (OS), such as Windows or OS X, to be run from within (K)Ubuntu. This requires extra RAM (because both (K)Ubuntu and the virtualized second OS require separate amounts of RAM) and a license for the second OS. If you wish to run a virtualized instance of Windows XP, for instance, you must have a license for Windows XP.\n\nVirtualBox\n\nVirtualBox is a fast and complete virtualization solution owned and maintained by Sun Microsystems. There is a free and fully open-source edition available under the GNU GPL license.\n\nInstall the open-source edition:\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose virtualbox-ose-source virtualbox-guest-additions\n\nYou can also add the QT-version (if using KDE/Kubuntu, for example):\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-qt\n\nStart VirtualBox:\n\nMenu -> VirtualBox OSE PC virtualization solution\n\nFor usage instructions, see the End-user documentation. For information on installing Virtualbox in Windows so that Ubuntu can then be installed within in a virtual machine running in Windows, see this page.\n\nProprietary versions of VirtualBox\n\nA few additional features that are not yet in the OSE version, such as a USB device interface, are available in the proprietary version of VirtualBox. To install a proprietary edition of VirtualBox:\n\nAdd the security key:\n\nwget -q http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/sun_vbox.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -\n\nAdd the repository string to your repository list and update:\n\necho \"deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian lucid non-free\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/virtualbox.list sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall:\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox\n\nVMWare\n\nVMWare is a commercial virtualization platform that currently offers two free products: VMWare Player and VMWare Server (the latter with a free renewable yearly license). VMWare Player can play virtual appliances that have already been created, whereas VMWare Server (which has a broader range of features) allows the creation of virtual machines. In general, VMWare Server is recommended unless you only need to play an appliance. (Appliances will also run in VMWare Server). Users that wish to run servers (or processes) that need to be available to a network from within the virtual machine should use VMServer. If you wish to install a new OS within a virtual machine (other than in an appliance), you will need VMWare Server.\n\nVMWare Player\n\nInstallation instructions are on the website, or at the Ubuntu community wiki. In brief, to install the free VMWare Player:\n\nInstall pre-requisites:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nGet the binary package/installation script, give it executable privileges, then run the installation script:\n\nwget http://download3.vmware.com/software/vmplayer/VMware-Player-2.5.3-185404.i386.bundle chmod +x VMware-Player-2.5.3-185404.i386.bundle sudo ./VMware-Player-2.5.3-185404.i386.bundle\n\nRun:\n\nApplications -> System Tools -> VMWare Player\n\nCreate an Ubuntu Appliance\n\nWhile any edition of Ubuntu can be installed in a virtual machine, the minimal installation option (F4) of the Ubuntu Server creates a highly-efficient edition (previously known as JeOS) optimised for use within a virtual appliance (which can then be played using VMWare Player or other virtual machine client). See this walkthrough.\n\nA virtual appliance for VMWare Player (using this JeOS minimal server) can also be built using vmbuilder.\n\nVMWare Server\n\nInstall pre-requisites:\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\nDownload the server source files for your architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) from the VMWare Server website and retrieve your license key by email.\n\nExtract the files, give execution privileges to the install script, and run the install script:\n\ntar xvf VMware-server-2.0.1-156745.i386.tar.gz cd vmware-server-distrib chmod +x vmware-install.pl sudo ./vmware-install.pl\n\nVMWare Package\n\nVMWare Appliances (that include an Ubuntu/Debian OS) can be created using VMWare Server and the VMWare Package utility. These appliances can then be deployed to users who can play them using VMWare Player. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install vmware-package\n\nKeyboard errors in VMware guest\n\nAfter installing VMWare 6.5, and installing a guest OS, the Function, arrow and Del/End/etc keys do not function. This is a bug with VMWare´s code. Add this line to ~/.vmware/config (create file if necessary) to fix this issue:\n\nxkeymap.nokeycodeMap = true\n\nKVM\n\nKVM is the free open source virtualization solution implemented as a Linux kernel module (in the recent kernels) for computers whose processors contain virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). See the Ubuntu installation instructions. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install kvm\n\nQemu (without KVM)\n\nIf your computer does not have the virtualization extensions, you can still run the QEMU virtualization platform. See this Ubuntu community documentation. It can be installed from source code.\n\nXen\n\nXen is an efficient open-source virtualization (\"hypervisor\") platform (which includes a merge with QEMU). It is the basis for the Amazon EC2 Cloud and is generally intended for use on a server (or on \"baremetal\" systems, i.e. no OS yet installed). It is free open source under a GPL license. The latest desktop (and installation instructions) is available from the website. (A commercial version is also offered by Citrix.) Implementation in Ubuntu requires some modification, currently. For more info, see the Ubuntu community documentation. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor xen-docs convirt\n\nA Xen virtual machine host can also be installed automatically with certain 64-bit CPUs, using the 64-bit Ubuntu Server LiveCD. (A (K)Ubuntu desktop can then later be added -- see Ubuntu server).\n\nVirtual Machine Manager\n\nVirtual Machine Manager is an application to allow viewing of all instances of virtual machines on your system. It includes a secure implementation of VNC. This and other virtual management tools are available as an integrated package in (K)Ubuntu. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-virt-mgmt\n\nCrossover for Linux\n\nCodeweavers' Crossover Office for Linux is a subscription-based commercial package that allows many Windows programs to be run on Ubuntu without the need for a Microsoft OS license or a complete virtualization system. See the website for more info. Codeweavers releases older versions of this product into the free package Wine.\n\nWine\n\nWine is a free open-source package that is similar to (and implements many elements of) CrossOver for Linux. Like CrossOver for Linux, no Microsoft license or virtualization platform is required to run Windows programs. See these instructions for installing the latest version of Wine.\n\nsudo apt-get install wine\n\nAlso consider installing Microsoft's TrueType fonts:\n\nsudo apt-get install msttcorefonts\n\nPlayOnLinux\n\nPlayOnLinux is a Wine frontend which simplifies the installation and launch of many Windows programs, particularly games. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\nInternet Explorer 7\n\nInternet Explorer 7 can be installed with PlayOnLinux. Select \"Internet Explorer 7\" from the \"Internet\" section of PlayonLinux.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 & 7\n\nInternet Explorer 6 & 7 can function under Wine, albeit imperfectly. For most purposes, Firefox can be used (with the User Agent Switcher plugin) to mimic Internet Explorer.\n\nMake sure you have Wine and cabextract packages:\n\nsudo apt-get install wine cabextract\n\nDownload the Winetricks installation script:\n\nwget http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/winetricks\n\nInstall with winetricks:\n\nsudo ./winetricks ie6 sudo ./winetricks ie7\n\nNote: Winetricks is automatically installed with the current version of Wine.\n\nTransgaming Cedega\n\nCedega is a commercial application (similar to CrossOver Office and Wine), for installing and running some Windows applications, specifically games, without the need for virtualization or a Microsoft license. It provides 3D support, software acceleration support, and a high level of DirectX support. Installation instructions are found on the website.\n\nMono\n\nMono is a free open source project sponsored by Novell to allow .NET programs to function in Linux ((K)Ubuntu) and Mac OS X. . Several GNOME applications (like Tomboy, F-Spot, and Banshee) require mono to be installed, so mono may already be installed by default on your system. The most recent version is available here.\n\nsudo apt-get install mono-2.0-devel\n\nMoonlight\n\nSee Moonlight plugin for Firefox\n\nDosBox\n\nDOSBox is a DOS-emulator that emulates CPU:286/386 realmode/protected mode, Directory FileSystem/XMS/EMS, Tandy/Hercules/CGA/EGA/VGA/VESA graphics, and a SoundBlaster/Gravis Ultra Sound card (for sound compatibility with older games). You can \"re-live\" classic games that otherwise won't run on newer computers.\n\nsudo apt-get install dosbox\n\nScummVM\n\nScummVM allows certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games to run (provided you already have their data files). ScummVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing play on Linux operating systems (for which they were not originally designed).\n\nsudo apt-get install scummvm\n\nEdutainment Applications\n\nThere are many, many superb applications that can be installed with a single click.\n\nApplications -> Add/Remove Software -> Edutainment.\n\nBelow are a few examples that can be installed from this menu:\n\nCelestia -- a free planetarium and space simulator for the desktop\n\nStellarium -- an astounding planetarium for the desktop\n\nK3DSurf -- a program for modeling 3,4,5, and 6 dimensional models.\n\nBibletime-- a Bible study tool using the QT platform\n\nZekr -- an Islamic Quran study tool (available in Utilities)\n\nOregano -- a program for electrical engineering schematics\n\nRlPlot -- a high quality graph generator\n\nMnemosyne -- a flash-card tool\n\nGramps -- map your family-tree and co-operate with genealogy projects\n\nGoogle Earth\n\nGoogle Earth gives you an annotated eagle's eye view of our planet. This is a free proprietary package (you must accept the license to use this package).\n\nsudo apt-get install googleearth-package make-googleearth-package --force\n\nDoubleclick on the resulting .deb file.\n\n-- or --\n\nTo install the latest Linux binary, download and save the GoogleEarthLinux.bin package from Google Earth downloads. Then install:\n\nchmod +x GoogleEarthLinux.bin ./GoogleEarthLinux.bin\n\nRun:\n\nApplications -> Internet -> Google Earth 3D planet viewer\n\nYou should turn off the Google Earth -> View -> Atmosphere setting, or you might see clouds everywhere and the ground won't show up.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf Google Earth opens, shows the splash screen, and then crashes, you’re probably experiencing a common issue. Running ~/google-earth/googleearth in a terminal will show this error: ./googleearth-bin: relocation error: /usr/lib/i686/cmov/libssl.so.0.9.8: symbol BIO_test_flags, version OPENSSL_0.9.8 not defined in file libcrypto.so.0.9.8 with link time reference\n\nTo fix this, browse to the folder you installed Google Earth into. By default this will be google-earth in your home folder. Find the file libcrypto.so.0.9.8 and rename it to something else, like libcrypto.so.0.9.8.bak. Google Earth should now start correctly.\n\ncd ~/google-earth sudo mv libcrypto.so.0.9.8 libcrypto.so.0.9.8.bak sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8 ~/google-earth/libcrypto.so.0.9.8\n\n(Note: You can also specify /home/user/google-earth instead of ~/google-earth ).\n\nFor other issues, see the Ubuntu help pages on Google Earth.\n\nUninstall Google Earth\n\nTo uninstall run the uninstall shell script located in the /home/user/google-earth folder (or whichever folder you installed google-earth into).\n\nFBReader (e-book reader)\n\nFBReader is a free cross-platform e-book reader, based on the GTK platform. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install fbreader\n\nCalibre (e-book reader)\n\nCalibre is an e-book reader and library manager. See these installation instructions.\n\nGames\n\nThere are some phenomenal games for (K)Ubuntu Linux.\n\nBest Linux Games for 2008.\n\nBest 25 Linux Games of 2007.\n\nUbuntu Gamers Arena.\n\nThere are hundreds of free, open-source games available in (K)Ubuntu. Most (including the KDE Games collection and the Gnome Games collection) can be accessed through the Games section of your Package Manager.\n\nExamples are:\n\nKMahjongg -- the solitaire Mahjongg tile-matching game.\n\nPouetChess -- an excellent 3-D chess game.\n\nPokerTH -- a very nice Texas Hold 'Em Poker\n\nPlanet Penguin Racer -- Penguin slides down a 3-D luge run, catching fish. (Extreme Tux Racer is a newer version, but works in 32-bit only.)\n\nKsirK -- play Risk against the computer or in a multiplayer environment.\n\nTORCS -- the 3-D Car Racing game\n\nPingus -- a Lemmings clone (similar to Super Mario Bros.) that uses penguins instead of lemmings.\n\nFrozen Bubble -- the award-winning, addicting, time-wasting, bubble-popping game.\n\nFrets on Fire -- similar to Guitar Hero. You can import songs from Guitar Hero and from community sites.\n\nVdrift\n\nVdrift is a free open source 3-D racing game, similar to Need for Speed, with realistic physics, multiple drift tracks, and multiplayer games. Support for joysticks, mice and keyboard is included. A binary package for Linux is available from the website.\n\nAction\n\nIncredible action games (including those from the Top 25) are available in Ubuntu. Many can be installed using:\n\nApplications -> Add/Remove Software -> Games\n\nExamples are:\n\nAlien Arena -- a multi-player first person shooter action game with free servers. The repositories have version 7.0-1. For the current version 7.2 see the website.\n\nOpenArena -- an open-source multi-player first person shooter action game, with free servers. The repositories have version 7.7. For the current 8.1 version see the website.\n\nTremulous -- a Halo-like multiplayer first person shooter action game. The repositories have the current version.\n\nSauerbraten - a multiplayer graphics-rich first person shooter game evolved from Cube.\n\nNexuiz\n\nNexuiz is an open-source multi-player first person shooter game with free servers and tournaments.\n\nThe current version 2.4.2 is in the repositories.\n\nsudo apt-get install nexuiz nexuiz-music\n\nYou must have desktop effects turned off (System -> System Settings -> Desktop). There are a few other problems. See the Nexuiz forums. Some recommend running from a shell:\n\nsudo ./nexuiz-linux-glx.sh\n\nor\n\nsudo ./nexuiz-linux-sdl.sh\n\nA 35 map community pack is available here. To install, extract the map pack to /home/username/.nexuiz/data (or ~/.nexuiz/data ).\n\nUrbanTerror\n\nUrbanTerror is a multiplayer first person shooter action game. It uses the open-source quake 3 engine and features many real weapons and free-to-use servers for multi-player functionality. Not recommended for adolescents in Germany. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install urbanterror\n\nSpring\n\nThe Spring Project is a scripting engine platform to develop and play free multiplayer games such as Star Wars Imperial Winter and Complete Annihilation. See these installation instructions for adding the repository, then installing as a package.\n\nPlaneShift\n\nPlaneShift is a promising free full-immersion online fantasy game (MMPORG). Client downloads and patches are available here.\n\nMake the downloaded binary installation file executable:\n\ncd /directory_where_downloaded chmod +x PlaneShift-v.0.42-x64.bin\n\nRun the executable binary as root (this must be done from the command line Terminal):\n\nsudo ./PlaneShift-v.0.42-x64.bin\n\nFollow the instructions for installation. When prompted whether to manually set permissions, answer \"no.\"\n\nDuring installation, most users have recommended installing this game to your /home directory as a single user installation, instead of to /opt for all users. This avoids permissions problems. I was able to install to /opt, but it takes some effort.\n\nMake sure your user belongs to the games group:\n\nSystem -> User Manager -> user -> Groups -> check games\n\nDownload the updater patch psupdaterlinux64.zip and unzip it to your download directory.\n\nRun the updater as root:\n\nchmod +x psupdater chmod +x psupdater.bin sudo ./psupdater\n\nRegister for a free account at PlaneShift Registration.\n\nIf you installed the game to the menu, it will be in\n\nApplications -> Lost & Found -> Client and Setup\n\nTo run it from the menu, I had to edit the menu entries by checking the box: \"Run in terminal.\" Alternatively, run it from the command-line Terminal:\n\nsudo /opt/PlaneShift/pssetup sudo /opt/PlaneShift/psclient\n\nNotes: This game ran very slowly for me on a 32-bit installation with a DSL connection and I gave up. The 64-bit installation worked better, but there were still many freezes. This is a game very much in development, and is still in alpha stage.\n\nDoom\n\nSkulltag\n\nSkulltag is an updated ZDoom that includes network play. See the website for simple (K)Ubuntu installation instructions. (You can use the Freedoom Iwad (see below) if you don't have an original Doom2.wad.)\n\nInstall prerequisites:\n\nsudo apt-get install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra\n\nThen add the skulltag repositories, update, and install Skulltag and DoomSeeker (the Skulltag online server utility):\n\necho \"deb http://skulltag.net/download/files/release/deb/ jaunty multiverse\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/skulltag.list sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install skulltag doomseeker-skulltag\n\nIf you don't have a doom2.wad, tnt.wad, or plutonia.wad already, you can copy the freedoom.wad to your ~/.skulltag folder:\n\ncd ~/.skulltag wget http://mirror.cinquix.com/pub/savannah/freedoom/freedoom-iwad/freedoom-iwad-0.6.4.zip unzip freedoom-iwad-0.6.4.zip cp freedoom*/doom2.wad . rm freedoom-iwad-0.6.4.zip\n\nPrBoom\n\nPrBoom is a free open source port of the original first person shooter action game, Doom.\n\nsudo apt-get install prboom freedoom timidity timidity-interfaces-extra\n\nThere are thousands of extra maps (Wads) available for this game. It is easiest to keep a directory for your wads in your home directory:\n\nmkdir /home/user/wads\n\nor alternatively, use the /usr/share/games/doom folder, giving universal privileges to the folder:\n\nchmod -R 777 /usr/share/games/doom\n\nPlace your doom2.wad, tnt.wad, or plutonia.wad (from your original game) into this folder. If you don't have one, you can copy the Freedom version of doom2.wad from /usr/share/games/freedoom into this folder. Place any new .wad's you have downloaded from the Internet into this folder as well. Then run the game using both the original iwad map as well as your new .wad map (you will only see the new map).\n\nprboom -iwad /home/user/wads/doom2.wad -file /home/user/wads/new_wad.wad\n\nNote: Only doom2.wad, tnt.wad, or plutonia.wad can be used as an iwad. You must have one of these in addition to any new wad you wish to use. When in doubt, use doom2.wad.\n\nNote: this game can also be installed using Applications -> Add/Remove Software -> Games as Freedoom, but you must also install timidity and timidity-interfaces-extra.\n\nWing Commander Privateer\n\nThe Linux version of this free version of Wing Commander can be downloaded as a binary here.\n\nInternet Applications\n\nInternet applications enable you to make full use of your Internet connection. Web browsers, Email clients, Instant Messengers, and more are included in this category.\n\nWeb Browsers\n\nMozilla Firefox\n\nMozilla Firefox is the ubiquitous web browser. Based on open source components, it is trademarked and cannot be altered or re-distributed with any change that involves the name or trademarks. Install the current version:\n\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nInstall Firefox 3.6\n\nFirefox 3.6 is not yet in the official Ubuntu repositories. Obtain from the Launchpad repositories and install:\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install firefox-3.6 firefox-3.6-branding\n\nNote: This method requires that port 11371 for the (repository) keyserver be open in your firewall.\n\nFirefox Plug-ins\n\nAdblock plug-in (block ads in a web page)\n\nAdblock Plus blocks ads that appear in web pages. You can subscribe to a free filter service, and can add ads to block with a single click.\n\nsudo apt-get install sudo apt-get install xul-ext-adblock-plus\n\nYou can also add this extension from Firefox -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Browse All Add-ons. (This method will also ensure that automatic updates are installed by Firefox.)\n\nNoscript plug-in (controls scripts)\n\nThe Noscript plugin is considered one of the most important security measures for browsing the Internet. Most viruses and trojans gain access to computers from the Internet through scripts. This plugin allows you to choose which scripts to allow and blocks the rest.\n\nsudo apt-get install mozilla-noscript\n\nYou can also add this extension from Firefox -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Browse All Add-ons. (This method will also ensure that automatic updates are installed by Firefox.)\n\nUser Agent Switcher plug-in for Firefox\n\nThe User Agent Switcher plugin allows a browser to masquerade as another browser, allowing (most of the time) browser-specific content to be displayed.\n\nYou can add this extension from Firefox -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Browse All Add-ons. (This method will also ensure that automatic updates are installed by Firefox.)\n\nVideo DownloadHelper plug-in for Firefox\n\nThe Video Download Helper plugin allows the download of videos (including Flash videos) from sites like YouTube.\n\nYou can add this extension from Firefox -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Browse All Add-ons. (This method will also ensure that automatic updates are installed by Firefox.)\n\nUnplug Download Management\n\nThe UnPlug add-on lets you save video and audio which is embedded on a webpage.\n\nYou can add this extension from Firefox -> Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Browse All Add-ons.

If it not yet installed on your system as part of another package (it is used by many video/audio editors), then install it:\n\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n\nTo convert many different formats, read the FFMPEG documentation. Also see this tutorial.\n\nExample: To convert a saved Flash video (.flv) to an MPEG-2 format playable on a DVD, convert:\n\nffmpeg -i samplevideo.flv -target ntsc-dvd samplevideo.mpg\n\nThen use K3b (or Gnomebaker) to write the mpg file to a New DVD Data Project.\n\nFor PAL use -target pal-dvd. For widescreen, use -target film-dvd. For other conversion tips, see this forum. (Note: Most Flash video has very low resolution, with a screen size of 360x270, for example. You may see a slight diminishment in resolution if you wish to convert it to 720x480 (which is the NTSC standard size) or other screen size. You can keep the original screen size and resolution by omitting the -target parameter.) If your original file is 16:9 widescreen and you desire a 4:3 letterbox output for playing on an overscanned TV, you may need to pad the file so that the widescreen is not compressed (see this forum):\n\nffmpeg -i samplevideo.flv -target ntsc-dvd -s 648x364 -padleft 36 -padright 36 -padtop 58 -padbottom 58 samplevideo.mpg\n\nYou can also use the WinFF GUI and add the command (as above) as a \"Preset,\" for subsequent use. For example:\n\nVideo converter (WinFF) -> Edit -> Presets ->\n\nPreset Name: Letterbox -> Preset Label: 16:9 Widescreen to 4:3 Letterbox\n\nPreset command: -target ntsc-dvd -s 648x364 -padleft 36 -padright 36 -padtop 58 -padbottom 58\n\nOuput file extension: mpg -> Category: DVD\n\n-> Add/Update -> Save\n\nTo convert to MPEG-4 (mp4) files, use\n\nffmpeg -i samplevideo.flv outputvideo.mp4\n\nFFMpeg requires that multiple restricted extra codecs be installed. This can be done in a single easy step from the command-line Terminal:\n\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras\n\nFFMPEG GUI\n\nWinFF is a free, GPL-licensed open source GUI frontend for FFMPEG. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install winff xterm\n\nRun:\n\nApplications -> Multimedia -> Video converter (WinFF)\n\nJoin video segments\n\nIndividual video segments (MPEG-2, for example) can easily be joined:\n\ncat samplevideo1.mpg samplevideo2.mpg samplevideo3.mpg > samplevideo123.mpg\n\nYou can then write the resulting MPEG-2 file to a DVD and play it in most DVD players.\n\nSplit a file into segments\n\nAny file can be split into segments using the Linux command:\n\nsplit -b 1440k my_big_file\n\nwhich will split my_big_file into equal segments of size 1440 kb.\n\nSave any streaming Flash video\n\nAn easy way is to install the Video Download Helper plug-in for Firefox.\n\nOtherwise, most Flash videos download to the /tmp directory while you watch the video, creating a randomly-named video file there (such as Flashuh4G6s). When you close the webpage, this file in the /tmp directory will be erased. After the entire video has downloaded, but before you close the webpage, copy that file (such as Flashuh4G6s) to your home directory (where it will not be erased). Of course, for this to work, you must change your Flash (or Gnash) settings to allow an unlimited buffer. While watching your Flash video, right click to bring up the Flash -> Settings window. Set the Buffer to \"Unlimited.\"\n\nOnce you have copied the file, rename it appropriately with the .flv added to the filename. You can then watch it using VLC or Mplayer.\n\nHere is another method that involves making a symbolic link.\n\nSave rtmp / flv streams\n\nflvstreamer is a command-line application to dump rtmp streams. Install:\n\nsudo apt-get install flvstreamer\n\nExample of usage:\n\nflvstreamer -r \"rtmp://host/dir/file.flv\" -o filename.flv\n\nIf you see the following the \"WARNING: Download may be incomplete, try --resume!\" message, try to use the --resume option:\n\nflvstreamer -r \"rtmp://host/dir/file.flv\" -o filename.flv --resume\n\nConvert Flash video audio to mp3\n\nOnce you have downloaded flash video content (.flv) from the Internet (using the Video Download Helper plug-in for Firefox, for example), the audio component can be converted to an mp3 using this command (from the command line Terminal). (This will work for any type of video file, not just Flash.)\n\nffmpeg -i nameofvideoclip.flv -ab 160k -ac 2 -ar 44100 -vn nameoffile.mp3\n\nwhere -i indicates the input, -ab indicates the bit rate (in this example 160kb/sec), -vn means no video ouput, -ac 2 means 2 channels, -ar 44100 indicates the sampling frequency. See FFMPEG docs for more info.\n\n2ManDVD\n\n2ManDVD is a GUI utility for creating DVD videos. It is the successor of ManDVD.
