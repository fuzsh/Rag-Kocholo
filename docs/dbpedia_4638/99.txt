Further beefing up its exec ranks in the label’s R&B arm, MCA Records has tapped industry vet Steve Corbin senior veep of operations.

In the newly created post, Corbin will oversee the day-to-day operations of the A&R department’s administration, shepherd the arm’s release schedule and fine-tune recording and video production budgets.

“Steve has had an extraordinary career over the years, working with all kinds of artists in every genre,” MCA Records prexy Jay Boberg said. “He is one of the most talented (execs) I know.”

Corbin, a well-respected label “traffic cop” known for rallying occasionally divergent forces for the good of a project, joins MCA from Motown Records where he was exec veep and G.M. of the venerable label. He worked closely with then-prexy and CEO Andre Harrell.

Before Motown, Corbin’s career stops included posts at Polygram Group Distribution, CBS Records and retailer Harmony Hut.

“When you look at the (list of successes), its clear the roster here is strong,” Corbin said. “With the direction the A&R department is headed now, I’m certain we’re only going to get stronger.”

MCA’s R&B arm is riding high in the saddle, thanks to successful albums from K-Ci & JoJo and Mary J. Blige. The upcoming bow from Keith Washington — on imprint Silas Records through MCA — already is garnering strong industry buzz.

The Corbin hire marks the latest R&B exec to join the MCA fold as part of a restructuring of the potent division. The label recently hired R&B promotion kingpin/VP Benny Pough and Cassandra Ware as VP and marketing director, to lead the revamped label.
