        "text": "Iowa’s Caitlin Clark on Sunday became the NCAA Division I all-time leading scorer across men’s and women’s basketball. Clark’s career points total surpassed a 54-year mark set by another revolutionary player in former LSU star “Pistol” Pete Maravich, who finished with 3,667 points.\n\nIt was a week for the record books. One game earlier, Clark — a catalyst to the recent rapid growth of women’s basketball — also passed Lynette Woodard’s Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women scoring record of 3,649 points. She also broke the Division I women’s single-season 3-point record of 154, set by Idaho’s Taylor Pierce.\n\nIn surpassing Maravich, Clark joined an elite group of women to hold a record across NCAA men’s and women’s basketball.\n\nWhile not a comprehensive list, below are 10 others to hold such marks.\n\nA stat stuffer and current star of the WNBA, Sabrina Ionescu recorded more triple-doubles than anyone in NCAA basketball history: 26. Her mark while at Oregon is more than double that of the leader on the men’s side, Brigham Young’s Kyle Collinsworth (12). Ionescu also holds the top single-season triple-double mark for men’s and women’s at eight, which she accomplished twice. (Note: Clark is No. 2 among men and women with 17 career triple-doubles.)\n\nBrittney Griner holds the career blocks record across men’s and women’s basketball at a whopping 748. She was an All-American at Baylor, where her jersey was recently retired, averaging 5.1 blocks per game across 148 games. Griner has 85 more all-time blocks than Louella Tomlinson had for Saint Mary’s (California), the next closest in the women’s record book. She is more than 170 above the next closest on the men’s side, where the University of Mount Saint Vincent’s Ira Nicholson holds the record with 576. Also, Griner’s 223 blocks in the 2009-10 season is the top single-season mark in NCAA men’s and women’s basketball, besting David Robinson’s mark of 207 for Navy in 1985-86. She set that record as a freshman."
