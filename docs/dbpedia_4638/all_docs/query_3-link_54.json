        "text": "“Gettin’ Old” Hits August 9, Major Music Video Directed by Roman White to Follow\n\nCallista Clark hasn’t slowed down writing, recording and touring since becoming Country radio’s most successful new artist debut of 2021. Through her new relationship with Dreamcatcher Artists, she will release the powerful duet “Gettin’ Old” featuring Scotty McCreery on August 9, 2024. Pre-save HERE.\n\n“Scotty was my first choice for a duet partner on ‘Gettin’ Old,’” said Callista. “I’ve always loved his voice and how he approaches his career. He absolutely nailed this song.”\n\nCallista wrote “Gettin’ Old” with Averie Bielski and Karen Kasowski. Joey Hyde and Frank Rogers share production credits on the song, which will be released on the Dreamcatcher Artists label and distributed by STEM.\n\n“I’ve been a fan of Callista and her talent for some time, especially after having her out on my European Tour a few years ago,” said McCreery. “I loved this song from the first time I heard it, and was honored that she asked me to sing it with her.”\n\nThe two shot a stunning music video conceived, produced and directed by award-winning film maker Roman White for Red Mill Productions in Nashville on July 28, which will be released in the coming weeks.\n\nCallista released “Bless Your Heart,” her first single for Dreamcatcher, earlier this year. It was immediately added to the cover of streaming giant Pandora’s popular Top Country Hits playlist and received substantial editorial and organic support at all major streaming platforms. She followed with “Reckless” and a haunting version of CCR’s “Have You Ever Seen The Rain,” culminating in a fan and industry facing live show on September 10 in Nashville and an EP release on September 27.\n\nMcCreery is currently rising up the country charts with \"Fall of Summer,\" his second single from his critically acclaimed album Rise & Fall. The first single from the album, \"Cab in a Solo,\" was McCreery's sixth No. 1 hit."
