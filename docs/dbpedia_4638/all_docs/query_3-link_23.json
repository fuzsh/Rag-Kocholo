        "text": "Callista Clark has signed a production as well as an exclusive management deal with Dreamcatcher. The entertainment company plans to keep the door open to partnerships and upstream while supporting Clark’s career with the resources it feels are necessary to be competitive in the major music marketplace worldwide.\n\nDreamcatcher expanded its distribution relationship with Stem, and released Clark’s single, “Bless Your Heart,” on Feb. 16. Her song “Reckless,” which she wrote alongside Laura Veltz and its producer Sam Ellis, will be available this Friday (April 12). Clark is set to share more new music this year, including a forthcoming collaboration as well as an EP in September.\n\nCEO Powell Hedley and Co-Founder Jim Mazza remain at the helm of Dreamcatcher, and will oversee Clark’s team.\n\n“My professional career in the music business has spanned my entire adult life—Without question, Callista Clark makes it all worth it,” says Hedley. “Very grateful for the partnership we have built together, and we are just getting started. On behalf of all of us at Dreamcatcher, we are blessed and humbled to be a part of bringing her gift to people all over the world.”\n\n“I truly couldn’t be more excited to work with Dreamcatcher! I’ve been writing nonstop over the years, and I can’t wait to share more of the songs I’ve created,” says Clark. “Thank you to Powell, Jim and everyone at Dreamcatcher for believing in me! I can’t wait for this next chapter.”\n\nThe company has also hired Meg Combs to work with the artist in a day-to-day capacity. Combs can be reached at Meg@dreamcatchermanagement.com."
