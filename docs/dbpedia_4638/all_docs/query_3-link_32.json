        "text": "June Clark studied piano and composition at the Royal Academy of Music and later worked as a composer with Alan Bush. Her first works were published whilst still a twenty-year-old student, launched as one of Englandâ€™s rare women composers. Alongside a career as an international pianist, she published many vocal and choral works through Charlemagne Music and this recording brings some of these together with performances by Portsmouth Cathedral Choir."
