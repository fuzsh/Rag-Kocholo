        "text": "St. Vincent has officially launched her own record label, Total Pleasure Records.\n\nThe artist also known as Annie Clark announced the label on Instagram, posting a photo of herself wearing the label's logo on a long-sleeve T-shirt.\n\nHer new album, All Born Screaming, was the first release on Total Pleasure. Previously, she was signed to Loma Vista Recordings. Although Total Pleasure is technically an indie label, All Born Screaming was distributed through Universal Music.\n\nIt's unclear if Total Pleasure will become a way for St. Vincent to sign other artists and release their music, or if it's simply a platform for her own projects."
