        "meta_description": "In Camera by Clark, releases 13 September 2024\n\n1. Green Wash\n2. Green Breaking\n3. Superstar\n4. Bleeding Building\n5. Running Dreams\n6. It&#39;s 450\n7. Probe\n8.

Exhausted\n18. Green Blood\n19. Blue Blood\n20. Blood\n\nClark has expanded his score for Naqqash Khalid’s award-winning debut feature film ‘In Camera’, into a mesmerising new album. Containing timeless synth instrumentals like ‘Running Dreams’, a bittersweet cover of the Carpenters / Sonic Youth classic ‘Superstar’, and the first single, epic, rising builder ‘Green Breaking’, it’s a deeply rewarding listen. \r\n\r\nFurther honing his experiments in sound as subconscious vernacular, Clark’ original score was created in close collaboration with director Naqqash Khalid, whereby music and picture become an inextricable whole. Evoking the modern malaise, thematically ‘In Camera’ fits perfectly alongside Clark’s last two albums ‘Playground In A Lake’ and ‘Sus Dog’, also marking a new addition to his formidable canon of soundtracks. \r\n\r\n“I knew from the outset I wanted to work with an artist and have the soundtrack not be something that acts in support of the film, not as an aid or crutch, but be this whole new layer of writing – a layer of storytelling that is in a dialogue and dance with the images and characters on-screen, and going further. So much of making a film is about articulating something inarticulate in collaboration with other people; You’re building something with someone where there are no words – and in doing so, in going on a shared journey together, you invent your own language. This soundtrack feels like another character – like an extension of the film’s atmosphere and interiority, Chris has drawn out something that felt like it’d always been lurking, waiting, under the surface of the film.” Naqqash Khalid\r\n\r\n“I loved how precise Naqqash wanted everything to be. Precise but also extremely keen to hear suggestions and not flinch at curveballs. The palette needs to become laser focused through a period of free play and experimentation. Using my vocals but abstracted in a way that tonally matched the film was the most unique challenge. I was going to just include the cues, which are all on there, but got far too into recording new stuff that fitted the tone and emotion of the film. The record has a very distinct colour/feel. It’s drenched in muted joy/dark euphoria.” Clark",
