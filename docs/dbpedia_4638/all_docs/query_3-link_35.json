        "text": "About\n\nClark\n\n\"'Sus Dog' is an ode to new beginnings, marking a robust and ever creative peak in Clark’s career.\" Bleep, Top 10 Albums of the Year 2023\n\n“In electronic music’s never-ending battle between man and machine, he’s seeking a third way.” Pitchfork\n\n\"Comforting weirdness you can’t get anywhere else.\" **** The Guardian\n\nBritish producer and composer, Chris Clark, has been creating immersive soundscapes, blending experimental electronica with ambient and classical music for over 20 years.\n\nSigned at an early age to legendary British indie label Warp Records, notable releases include 'Clarence Park' (2001), 'Body Riddle' (2006), 'Totems Flare' (2009), 'Iradelphic' (2012), 'Clark' (2014), 'Death Peak' (2017) and 'Playground In A Lake' (2021).\n\nHis 10th studio album ‘Sus Dog’ (2023) was released on his own burgeoning label, Throttle Records, and focuses more on vocally-led tracks, with his own voice as the main element. The record was mentored and executive produced by Thom Yorke, who sings and plays bass on the track ‘Medicine’.\n\nClark has written multiple scores for film and TV and has frequently collaborated with choreographer Melanie Lane on contemporary dance projects. His extensive inventory of remixes includes Thom Yorke, Massive Attack, Depeche Mode, Max Richter, Battles and Nils Frahm.\n\nAbout Johanna Bramli\n\nFrench-Swedish musician, composer and sound artist Johanna Bramli blends found sounds, drones, DIY noise devices, and harmonised vocals to create melodic, dreamy yet haunting soundscapes. She uses textural sounds with a melodic sensibility that sets the scene for a cinematic experience.\n\nShe is one half of motorik pop band Fröst, co-founder of the all-female noise/feedback choir The Larsens and a media composer. In her solo work, she attempts to bring elements of melodic and pop structures to experimental sounds and textures. Her debut EP 'Spirals' was released on Little Miss Echo.\n\nStage times"
