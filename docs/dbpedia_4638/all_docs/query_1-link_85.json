        "text": "Since news broke yesterday that both Demi Lovato and Ariana Grande are reportedly parting ways with manager Scooter Braun, attention has been cast on the music mogul's impressive list of clients.\n\nCredited with discovering a teenage Justin Bieber and launching him to super-stardom, the 42-year-old currently manages big names including Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, supermodel Ashley Graham, actor and singer Hilary Duff and Frozen star Idina Menzel.\n\nBut with two stars already severing ties and rumors of Bieber seeking new representation, speculation is rife on the reasons for the exodus—and whether more celebs are planning to drop him as manager.\n\nWho is Scooter Braun?\n\nBeginning his career as a party promotor on Atlanta's club scene, Braun was plucked from obscurity by producer Jermaine Dupri, who hired the then 20-year-old as the executive director of marketing for his So So Def record label.\n\nBraun founded his management company SB Projects in 2007, according to Crunch Base, and a year later, came across a 14-year-old Bieber singing on YouTube. He signed the teenager to his record label, Raymond Braun Media Group, which the entrepreneur co-founded with R&B star Usher. The partnership boosted both of their careers, with Braun managing the pop star for the past 15 years.\n\nOver the years, SB Projects' client roster has expanded exponentially. In 2013, Braun signed Ariana Grande, who has released six studio albums under his management. Demo Lovato came on board in 2019, releasing Holy Fvck in 2022.\n\nHowever, Braun was slammed by pop star Taylor Swift in 2019 after purchasing Big Machine Records, the singer's former label. The pair were already said to be on poor terms due to the feud between Swift and Braun's former client Kanye West. The rapper released the controversial track \"Famous\" while working with the manager, which makes sexual references to Swift.\n\nBuying Big Machine Records gave Braun control of the 33-year-old singer's first six albums, with the manager allegedly refusing to allow Swift to perform her older music at the American Music Awards in 2019, according to Teen Vogue. Swift blasted the music executive in a Tumblr post, and her track \"Vigilante S***\" is rumored to be about him.\n\nOn Monday, Billboard reported that Demi Lovato was no longer working with Braun. According to Variety, the split was \"mutual and amicable,\" with the 31-year-old singer searching for new management. The same day, it was reported that 30-year-old Grande has also dropped Braun, although the reason why is unknown.\n\nColumbian singer J Balvin also left SB Projects in May for Jay-Z's Roc Nation, and rumors have also been circling that Bieber is planning to leave. Puck News recently reported that the 29-year-old and his manager hadn't \"spoken in months,\" but representatives for both Bieber and Braun told Page Six the claim was false.\n\nHowever, a music industry source with knowledge of the situation told Newsweek that claims Grande and Bieber are leaving SB Projects are untrue.\n\n\"All of Scooter Braun's clients are under contract and negotiations have been going on for several months as Scooter steps into his larger role as HYBE America CEO,\" the source told Newsweek.\n\n\"People are spreading rumors based on what they know, but they are off. Scooter's team at SB Projects are still handling both Justin and Ariana as they work through what this new structure looks like.\"\n\nWho Does Scooter Braun Manage?\n\nWhether or not Bieber stays put, Braun still has plenty of A-listers on his roster. The SB Projects website lists 36 names, including Grande, Lovato and former client J Balvin.\n\nAlthough she is featured on the SB Projects website, a representative for Hilary Duff confirmed that the star has not been managed by Braun since 2016.\n\nThe List of Scooter Braun's Current and Former Clients Includes:\n\nAshley Graham—supermodel\n\nAriana Grande—singer and actor\n\nAva Max—singer-songwriter\n\nAsher Roth—rapper\n\nBabyJake—singer\n\nBlack Eyed Peas—band\n\nCallista Clark—singer\n\nCarly Rae Jepson—singer\n\nDan + Shay—pop duo\n\nDavid Guetta—DJ\n\nDemi Lovat—singer and actor\n\nEden—singer-songwriter\n\nGunner Gehl—singer-songwriter\n\nHilary Duff—actor and singer\n\nIdina Menzel—actor and singer\n\nJ Balvin—singer\n\nJenna Raine—singer\n\nJustin Bieber—singer\n\nKaliii—rapper\n\nKelly Rowland—singer and television personality\n\nThe Knocks—electronic duo\n\nLil Dicky—rapper\n\nPaul Pogba—soccer player\n\nPSY—singer\n\nPush Baby—pop duo\n\nQuavo—rapper\n\nSocial House—musical duo\n\nThe Spencer Lee band—pop band\n\nSteve Angello—DJ\n\nThe Kid Laroi—rapper\n\nThe Scarlet Opera—rock band\n\nTori Kelly—singer-songwriter\n\nThe Wanted—pop band\n\nWatt—singer and producer\n\nYG—rapper\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Braun for comment.\n\nUpdate 8/23/23, 5:40 a.m. ET. This story was updated to include additional information from an industry source.\n\nUpdate 8/23/23, 10:15 a.m. ET.
