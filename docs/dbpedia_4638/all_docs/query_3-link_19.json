        "text": "Chris Clark has worked with music and sound for eighteen years. Signed at an early age to legendary British indie label Warp Records, he has to date released ten albums as well as a multitude of EPs and singles. His last studio album, ‘Death Peak’ was accompanied by an incandescent live show with dancers choreographed by frequent collaborator Melanie Lane. Toured extensively in 2017–18 it headlined stages world wide.\n\nFollowing his debut score for TV series ‘The Last Panthers’ he recently scored ‘Rellik’ for BBC1 and breakout Channel 4 drama ‘Kiri’ starring Sarah Lancashire and written by Jack Thorne.\n\nChris has collaborated with choreographer Melanie Lane, scoring no less than ten contemporary dance projects including the performance of her solo project ‘Tilted Fawn’ at the Sydney Opera House and most recently ‘Personal Effigies’ which won the Kier Choreographic Prize in March 2018.\n\nChris’ extensive inventory of re-mixes for the likes of Massive Attack, Depeche Mode, Max Richter, Battles and Nils Frahm were collected in 2013 on the ‘Feast / Beast’ double album.\n\n“What’s always set Clark apart is his eclecticism, dynamism, and flair for the dramatic… His tracks don’t drop as much as they slip or swerve… He’ll end a techno album with eight minutes of beatless, sky-cracking ecstasy and it will make sense. He’s allergic to the idea of standard sounds and presets. And unlike many of his more insular peers, Clark can be open to sentimentality — not schmaltz — as much as a belief in humanness and all its inexact wonder. In electronic music’s never-ending battle between man and machine, he’s seeking a third way.” – Pitchfork"
