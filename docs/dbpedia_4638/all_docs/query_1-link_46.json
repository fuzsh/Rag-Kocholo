        "text": "Clark County Recorder's Office\n\nThe County Recorder was one of the first offices created by the Constitution of the State of Indiana in 1816. The Recorder is elected to a 4-year term, with a 2-term limitation. It is the primary duty of the Recorder to record instruments submitted for recording and maintaining those records for perpetuity.\n\nRecording of Deeds\n\nThe Recorder’s Office is responsible for recording the deed but you must first have it reviewed by the Assessor’s office (Room 104) and then transferred by the Auditor’s Office (Room 106) before you proceed to have it recorded in the Recorder’s Office. Please be aware there are fees collected in the Auditor’s Office and the Recorder’s Office. The Auditor’s Office only accepts cash or checks. The Recorder’s Office accepts cash, checks, or credit cards but there is a convenience fee charged by the credit card company.\n\nPublic Searches\n\nThe Recorder’s Staff will not search public records or give any legal opinions. If you know the recording information, you may request a copy from our office.
