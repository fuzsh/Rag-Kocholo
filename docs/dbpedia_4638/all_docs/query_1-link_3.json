        "text": "MEET CALLISTA CLARK\n\nCourtesy of Big Machine Records\n\nNASHVILLE, TN (February 12, 2021) – Every song has a story and at just 17 years old Callista Clark has a lot to say. Wielding her creative gifts as both a defense and an instrument of peace, the songstress puts her heart on display with her debut collection Real To Me out today via Big Machine Records. LISTEN NOW – https://callistaclark.lnk.to/realtomePR.\n\nBlending her love for authentic, timeless classics with the sounds of her Country roots, Clark “puts a fresh spin on soul phrasing” (Billboard). Gearing up to release her debut music, she’s worked with many of Nashville’s leading songwriters including Jonathan Singleton, Laura Veltz, Nicolle Galyon, and Emily Shackleton, among others and the proof that Clark could hold her own among Nashville’s most prominent is evident in the five songs of Real To Me.\n\nWorking with producer Nathan Chapman, Clark has crafted an impressive debut that showcases her skills as a songwriter and her heart-in-throat vocal delivery through the feisty anthem of “Change My Mind,” the poignant and relatable truths of “Real to Me” and the declaration of confidence in “It’s Cause I Am,” which will impact Country radio on March 29 as her first single. It’s her ability to be both assertive yet vulnerable, and empowering while brutally honest that make Real to Me such an auspicious introduction.\n\nReal To Me Track List\n\n1. “It’s Cause I Am” | Callista Clark, Cameron Jaymes, Laura Veltz\n\n2. “Heartbreak Song” | Callista Clark, Chris DeStefano, Liz Rose, Emily Shackelton\n\n3. “Change My Mind” | Callista Clark, Dan Isbell, Jonathan Singleton\n\n4. “Don’t Need It Anymore” | Callista Clark, Cameron Jaymes, Melissa Peirce\n\n5. “Real To Me” | Callista Clark, Casey Robert Brown, Laura Veltz\n\nClark has poured her heart into these songs and is hoping they encourage those who listen. “They are all very real and very personal stories for me,” she says. “There is some heavy emotion behind all of these, and I hope that somebody can relate to them. I really do.”\n\nFrom when she first stepped on stage to perform with Jennifer Nettles at 12 years old to her inspiring online videos, Callista has revealed herself to be not only a singer of incredible depth and pathos, but also a skilled musician of 8 instruments. Amassing over 65 million views on Facebook and 6 million views on YouTube, she’s grown her own grassroots fanbase with which Scooter Braun (SB Projects) and Scott Borchetta (Big Machine Label Group) took notice. Watch as she reflects on the video that changed her life: https://callistaclark.lnk.to/yt_chapter.\n\nFollow along with Callista’s journey on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter."
