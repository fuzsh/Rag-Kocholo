In describing his music, Sollee told Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal that, \"Phrasing-wise, [it's a] free story-telling style of singing where it's about moving the storyline along. [My influences have been] Paul Simon, Nina Simone, Ani DiFranco, Louis Armstrong, Lauryn Hill, Sam Cooke, Phoebe Snow.\"Other Influences have included Mark Summer, Bela Fleck, Victor Wooten, and Pete Seeger.\n\nSollee's Music has been said to observe no limits. [Bill Weigandt, Wooden Box] His songs are eclectic in that they draw elements from a broad range of recognizable genre's of music, even with the scope of a single song. The amalgamation of these disparate elements seems to be done subconsciously. The internal coherence of the compositions manages to sustain them against any impression of artifice. Subject to the song varies widely—from expressive love songs (e.g., \"Copper and Malachite\"), to the lamentations of a long-serving prisoner (\"Captivity\"), to the burning of London's historic Globe Theatre (\"The Globe\"). A notable feature of Sollee's songs that the lyrics are of co-equal importance with the music.\n\nSollee's cello work is the element that seems to most impact audiences that have not previously seen him perform. The initial reaction is often one of surprise, if not shock, since most listeners' familiarity with the cello, if any, is in classical settings, primarily with an orchestra. Sollee shows up in a T-shirt instead of a tux. He plucks the cello's strings as frequently as he bows them, plays without printed music, and rarely concentrates his gaze on the instrument while performing. Mostly, he is singing, coordinating with his fellow performers, and connecting with the audience, in much the same manner that many guitar players do. In response to a probe about the uniqueness of what he is doing as a musician, Sollee has said he's \"just continued with stuff that's been going on in banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle, and bass.\" In explaining his bond to the cello, Sollee told CNN interviewer that the cello is \"a great Swiss Army Knife...It always does the different things I need it to do in ensembles. I can take the lead. I can play rhythm. It always creates a sound that works in the environment I'm playing in.\" Sollee's relation to the cello is so intimate that appears almost organic, as if the instrument were merely an extension of his body.

Also a filmmaker under that original moniker, it was through this parallel career that Gabriel first brushed shoulders with some of his musical heroes: photographing a long list of luminaries including U2, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Alicia Keys, Judy Collins, Sheryl Crow, Lil' Wayne, Ani DiFranco, Lyle Lovett, Counting Crows, James Taylor, The Black Keys, Nicki Minaj, and Elton John, and directing music videos for Ben Harper, Braison Cyrus, and Joseph Arthur.\n\nWhen Grammy-nominated producer and composer Scott Healy first heard a collection of Gabriel’s demos and agreed to produce the songwriter’s first record for indie imprint sonaBLAST! Records, Gabriel found himself again surrounded by musical luminaries, as Healy assembled an all-star cast of some of New York City’s greatest session players and special guests. His debut, “The Exile of Saint Christopher,” featured legendary drummer Shawn Pelton (Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Cash), Bakithi Kumalo of Paul Simon’s “Graceland,” and folk-rock sensation Brett Dennen lending guest vocals. The record garnered enthusiastic reviews— Ian Mathers of the Village Voice wrote, “He’s got one of those malleable voices that can sound a bit like everyone from David Byrne to Ed Harcourt, but always mostly like himself”—became a Paste Recommends select, and was added in heavy rotation to Starbucks’ coffeehouse playlist.\n\nNever one to stop moving, Gabriel has since scored two feature films—the cult film, which he wrote and directed, 7 Splinters in Time, released theatrically in 2018, and the Netflix documentary From Baghdad to Brooklyn—and numerous television and web commercials. His songs have played nationally on Fuse’s “Live From Bonnaroo,” on the TV series “In Between Men,” and in the independent film “Where Hope Grows.” He led the house jazz trio for many years at New York’s Soho House, and he is hard at work on a cinema-musical.\n\nTHE NEW RECORD – ‘RADIO OCEAN’\n\nGabriel’s upcoming record and second collaboration with Healy, “Radio Ocean,” will be released on sonaBLAST! in the summer of 2021. It’s a sprawling and raucous affair, over a decade in the making. The record expands the sound of Gabriel’s sometimes intimate first record into a wider, free-wheeling and eclectic stew, channeling everything from country, to west African guitar riffs, to classic rock.\n\nHealy and Gabriel have outdone themselves in assembling a who’s-who of A-list talent once again. The 13-tune album features a returning Shawn Pelton and Curt Bisquera (Mick Jagger, Tom Petty) on drums, the totemic Lee Sklar (James Taylor, Jackson Browne, Carole King) on bass, Jason Orme (Alanis Morissette) on guitar, a full horn session comprised of Conan O’Brien’s Basic Cable Band veterans; as well as featured guest appearances by Americana darlings Birds of Chicago (JT Nero and Allison Russell), the saxophone prodigy Grace Kelly (Jon Batiste, Lee Konitz), songstress Jessica Childress (Aloe Blacc, Portugal the Man), indie maverick Kate Tucker, and chanteuse Perla Batalla (Leonard Cohen). As perhaps a sly nod to his filmmaking twin identity, Gabriel’s colleague, the esteemed rock photographer and director Danny Clinch, plays harmonica.\n\nAmid all of this outstanding musical talent is Gabriel’s songwriting. His words and stories are baroque and literary, with invocations of Samuel Beckett, Thomas Pynchon, Arundhati Roy, and even a song about David Foster Wallace. At once maximalist and personal, mythological and emotional, the stories told in ‘Radio Ocean’ capture a modern world’s sundry moments of collapse and crisis. Woven throughout is a personal narrative about the vicissitudes of love, heartache, and the quest for meaning and connection in a fragmented time.\n\nHERALDED MUSICIAN-ACTIVIST STEPHAN SAID TO RELEASE NEW ALBUM, UNSTOPPABLE, WITH WEBCAST, GLOBAL NETWORK, AND FORTHCOMING BIOPIC\n\n1st Album In 11 Years, Unstoppable, Features Star-studded New Band “The Clarion,” Out June 18\n\nHosts Video Podcast With Global Network “borderless” promoting a new pop culture for change\n\nDocumentary About His Life In Works By Spirit Award-Winner Gill Holland, Directed by Matt Kohn\n\nNew York-based musician and global activist Stephan Said has developed a reputation for crafting literate, poignant music and is known for consistently using his art at the frontlines of social change. He first broke into mainstream press with a police brutality anthem that featured Patti Smith, was asked by folk legend Pete Seeger to rewrite “We Shall Overcome,” and received praise from The New York Times’ Jon Pareles who wrote, “With his reedy, nasal voice, his acoustic guitar and earnest topical songs like his ‘Ballad of Abner Louima,’ Stephan Smith recalls Bob Dylan in his early days as a Woody Guthrie acolyte.” His songs have been sung at human rights protests across the world as well as by artists from Dave Matthews to DJ Spooky, and he has performed, toured, or recorded with a artists including Allen Ginsberg, Bob Dylan, Ween, Paul Simon, Ani DiFranco, Philip Glass, and others.\n\nStephan’s last album, 2010’s difrent, produced by the late Grammy Award winning Producer Hal Willner (Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, Bono, Saturday Night Live), blended pop with rock, folk, and world music in cinematic love songs and pop anthems about global equality and peace in English, Arabic, French and Spanish. Now, after spending the past few years focusing on his docuseries and global network “borderless,” traveling to conflict zones across the world to shed light on the change makers at the front lines, Stephan, with his new band, The Clarion, is getting ready to release a new album, Unstoppable, on June 18th on sonaBLAST! Records. He says, “Since the release of difrent, I’ve been focused on how music and art can build a sustainable global movement for peace, equality, and environmental sustainability. Instead of playing clubs, arenas and festivals, I’ve been making music on the front lines of the world’s biggest crises, working with young activists and creatives in war zones, refugee camps, natural disasters, and the like. There is an new generation that wants popular culture that represents the urgent need for systemic change they perceive. And, there’s nothing more inspiring to be in the thick of it.”\n\nUnstoppable features The Clarion, Stephan’s band of acclaimed musicians – bassist Mark Plati (David Bowie, Prince, Rachid Taha), who also mixed the album; drummer Doug Yowell (Joe Jackson, Duncan Sheik, Suzanne Vega), and keyboardist/programmer Matt Katz-Bohen (Hedwig, Blondie, Cyndi Lauper). Stephan proclaims, “Together, Mark, Doug, Matt and I found we have something really magical in the balance between us. We clicked immediately, so much so, that we decided to call ourselves a band, ‘The Clarion,’ after the victory horn”. Five of the songs were recorded live in one day at Mission Sound the week before lockdown in March 2020.\n\nThe first single from Unstoppable, “Together Across the World”, was written and recorded in the first few weeks of lockdown as “a joyous call for us to seize this moment to come together and transform our world.” As the lyrics say – “we’re invincible when we are one, across the borderlines, everything’s possible, when we’re together, we are one!” The track features Pam Fleming on trumpet and background vocals by Meah Pace (former Baltimore Ravens Cheerleading Captain, soloist with the Resistance Revival Chorus), and acclaimed cabaret singer Ali Babs.\n\nAnother track on the album, “Our Dream”, is the song from which the album gets its name. Stephan explains, “It’s written from a perspective that our victory is inevitable, and, when I say ‘our,’ I think of everyone from Amazonian tribes fighting for the rainforests to youth in Palestine and Israel fighting for peace, Friday’s For Future, Indian farmers, and BLM. It’s both a rally cry and a power anthem.”\n\nThe song and video for “I Won’t Be Silent” debuted last year to benefit Black Futures Lab which focuses on long-term movement building and impact, working with Black people to transform communities, building Black political power and changing the way that power operates—locally, statewide, and nationally. The song was written “as a personal reaffirmation that nothing will turn us around. That all of our movements are one, and we are taking a stand and will not be silenced.”\n\nAlthough Stephan has previously released several critically acclaimed albums under his mother’s maiden name, “Stephan Smith”, for his own independent label Universal Hobo Records, as well as for Artemis Records, Rounder Records, and Caroline Records, Unstoppable is only his second album reclaiming his born name. The Austrian and Iraqi-American with immediate family in Baghdad and Mosul, recorded under his mother’s maiden name after executives at major labels in the U.S. insisted he “could never have a career in America with an Arabic name.”\n\nCoinciding with the release of “Unstoppable,” Said will host a new, weekly video podcast “borderless,” produced by the global network and production company of the same name that he co-founded with his wife, Anushay. The borderless web-cast will feature voices from the frontlines who are creating a new pop culture focused on civic engagement, equality, and environmental sustainability. In the past six years since its founding, borderless has grown to operate on 5 continents, following Said as he brought his music across the world meeting changemakers in local communities – everyday heroes doing amazing this to make a better world.\n\nTogether since the release of his last album, Said and borderless have produced a music video for peace in the streets of Baghdad, Iraq as four bombs fell across the city; put on a major concert for unity in Karachi, Pakistan at the height of ISIS in which the country’s beloved Qawwal’s joining him; made a full length film on the refugee crisis including a live recording of his song “No More Lines” in refugee camps and settlements at the peak of the crisis in Greece (“it was so inspiring seeing the momentary sense of freedom that singing such an empowering song gave children and adults who had lost everything”); filmed in Houston following Hurricane Harvey in the hardest hit neighborhoods that went virtually uncovered by mainstream media; and in Charlottesville and Richmond, VA in the wake of white supremacist riots, where hundreds of youth at public high-schools and community centers co-created the music video for his song “We The People.”\n\nSaid says “‘borderless’ is the culmination of my life’s experience. Having been mentored by both Allen Ginsberg and folk/civil rights legend Pete Seeger, I knew from a young age that in order to achieve the systemic change my generation knows is imperative, we need to organize a global cultural movement in the way both Allen and Pete helped create in their lives - movements that lifted multiple voices and communities, not individuals. Movements that said “pop as we know it is over.” Having been blacklisted when The Bell “the first major song against the war in Iraq” (Neil Strauss, NY Times) became the most played song against the war in Iraq, ‘borderless’ for me is very much what building the folk revival was for Pete after he had been blacklisted in the McCarthy era. The silver lining is that being silenced, however painful and devastating, teaches one to become unsilenceable, to be unstoppable.”\n\nIn addition to the album, global network and webseries, acclaimed Spirit Award Nominee film producer Gill Holland is producing a documentary about Stephan, directed by filmmaker Matthew Kohn, which is expected to be released later this year. The film features archival and contemporary footage as well as interviews with Pete Seeger, Hal Willner, Penny Arcade, fellow musicians, and more. The documentary tells Said’s story as an artist activist who took a stand and a paid a price for it, but has come through it all to use his voice to lift others, helping pave the way for the current wave of activism.\n\n“Seeing this new global generation taking a stand for things that I have fought and been silenced for is so inspiring”, he says. “Unstoppable is an inward reflection and rallying cry about one’s personal commitment to social change, while borderless is an outward, global celebration of this new social change activist generation. This is our moment, nothing can stop us, we can create a more equal world and stop climate change, and we can make a new kind of pop music and pop culture that takes over the airwaves for the people and the planet.”\n\nhttp://stephansaid.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/stephansaid\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/universalhobo/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/stephan.said/\n\nhttps://thisisborderless.com/\n\nFor additional information/materials on Stephan Said & The Clarion and the album Unstoppable, please contact Jocelynn Loebl at Howlin' Wuelf Media at Jocylibs@yahoo.com or Jocelynn@howlinwuelf.com.\n\nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | iTunes\n\nWe’re all just spinning in circles of time and space. Indie pop band Frederick the Younger lasso various transitory states and tensions of the heart on their upcoming new EP. Across six songs, the Louisville-based band -- of Jenni Cochran, Aaron Craker, Shelley Anderson and Meg Samples -- seeks for something real and dissects such issues as regret, love, letting go and social media’s sharp stranglehold on human connectivity.\n\nProducer Kevin Ratterman (My Morning Jacket, Ray LaMontagne) couples the vivid, visceral lyrics and equally-emotive arrangements with a slick, yet dreamy, quality. And it’s never at the expense of the innately imposing stories. Lead single “Back to the Wall” untangles the push and pull of a relationship that’s undergoing an inner struggle. “You could say you love me / But you leave me with my back to the wall,” Cochran casts off her frustrations as a snake shedding its skin.\n\nTheir willingness to be so vulnerable serves as the EP’s foundation. “Erased,” featuring Craker’s magnetic, raw vocal, and “Deepest Blue” are other sterling highlights, the latter witnessing Cochran hitting an emotional rock bottom and writing a song about it. “One of my emotions that I dislike the most is when I get in this space of regret. I hate regretting things I’ve done, and I know when I’m in that space that I shouldn’t be doing that. I waste time, and I get carried away,” she says of the song.\n\nCochran and Craker are not only the creative core of the band, but they complete each other on a deeply personal level. Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, Cochran grew up writing songs, yet never played them out. She initially had ambitions to go to school for anthropology, and after participating in an overseas program, in conjunction with Princeton University, teaching in Mai Conga Delta in Vietnam, she returned to the states with full intentions to get her doctorate. She relocated to Louisville, and a two-month stay turned into a permanent move when she met Craker during an improv class.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, writing and making music has always been essential to Craker’s whole life. Upon hearing Nirvana for the first time in middle school, his destiny was carved in stone. A Louisville native, his obsession with piano and guitar propelled him to study at the University of Louisville. He later formed a band called Dr. Vitamin, which would be the stepping stone to much bigger things. “We were both what the other person needed. I deeply believe things happen for a reason,” says Cochran.\n\nDr. Vitamin quickly morphed into a very different beast. With Cochran still writing a bulk of the material, they decided to give the band a bit of an upgrade: changing the name. It was a simple procedure, tossing out various possibilities, before Cochran fell upon Frederick the Younger for it’s almost mystical nature. An album called Human Child arrived in 2017, and even within two years, their musical energy has blossomed into an even more ferocious entity.\n\nFrederick the Younger’s new EP, expected early 2020, positions the band for the next level. Such volatile moments as “High Alone” and “Something Real,” another soul-tearing performance, confirm their undeniable talents in harvesting the most intense of human experiences.\n\nThe first single from the EP, “Back to the Wall,” will be released on 9/26/19 via sonaBLAST! Records.\n\nPhoto by: Anna Lee Roeder"
