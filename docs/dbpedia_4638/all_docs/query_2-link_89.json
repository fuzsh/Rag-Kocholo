Clark worked with brands in while at Iowa, most notably State Farm and Gatorade.\n\nClark averaged 31.6 points this season, leading the Hawkeyes to a second straight national championship game and breaking TV ratings records.\n\nShe was drafted No. 1 by the Indiana Fever on April 15 and WNBA teams are already moving games against the Fever to larger arenas to meet demand. Clark will earn a $76,000 salary as a rookie."
