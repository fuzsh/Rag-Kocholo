        "text": "SIKESTON  Joshua Clark, a Sikeston resident, has always enjoyed country and Christian music and will release his first national single on Friday, May 24.\n\nClark originally grew up in Dexter, Missouri, and said his parents always took him to church, where he would watch his mother and father sing and his father would play guitar.\n\nClark said music has always been an important part of his life, especially since his dad taught him how to play the guitar when he was 12 years old.\n\nClark works as a technician for a farm equipment business during the day and as a musician at night, where he works on his songs. Clark has written 18 songs and serves as the worship leader at the new Church at Twin Bridges Campground on the Castor River in Glen Allen, Missouri.\n\nClark said he recently connected with the Nashville Christian Country music company based in Nashville, Tennessee, and will release his first national single this Friday, May 24.\n\nClark explained he became involved with the label and how God has blessed him in his music career.\n\nThe owner of Nashville Christian Country saw me on a Facebook video and reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in coming and recording with them and being a part of their label, Clark said. And it just kind of went from there.\n\nClark said in April, he went to Nashville to record with them, and his single Strings will be released on May 24.\n\nAccording to Clark, his musical journey so far has been very exciting.\n\nThe music that Nashville Christian Country puts out is pretty much regular country music with a positive message; theres no cussing or anything like that, Clark said.\n\nClark said his first single will be going out to hundreds of radio stations nationwide.\n\nIts just a really exciting time for me and I plan on going as far as I can with music, Clark said.\n\nClark said on June 1, he and another Christian country music artist, Marty DeRoche, will perform at Twin Bridges Community Church to celebrate the new churchs launch.\n\nThe address for the church is Twin Bridges Camp Ground 1392 State Highway 34, Glen Allen, MO 63751.\n\nClark said he wanted to give credit to God for his success in his music.\n\nGod has really done a 180 in my life, Clark said. I truly had no idea that a label would reach out to me about making music, Clark said.\n\nClark said he is so thankful for this experience and that God has given him this opportunity.\n\nI believe that in this day in age, we need more positive country music, Clark said. And I truly believe that is what Nasvhille Christian Country is trying to do."
