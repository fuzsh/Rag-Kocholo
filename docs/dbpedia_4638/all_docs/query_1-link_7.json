        "text": "One Love Books founder Al Fingers has put together a compilation of tracks in celebration of Jamaica's love affair with Clarks shoes. Clarks In Jamaica follows on from One Love's book of the same title that was published in 2012 by the London based independent publisher. Documenting this enduring relationship between Jamaica and the popular footwear brand, the compilation features 21 tracks from artists including Little John, Dillinger, Trinity, Ranking Joe and Supercat. Al Fingers, aka Al Newman, spoke at the V&A this summer about his fascination with the shoes' popularity: “Growing up in England I've always been fascinated by the Jamaican love of Clarks shoes and the way the brand is referenced within reggae and dancehall music. Vybz Kartel’s tune “Clarks” brought the phenomenon to many people’s attention in 2010, but the relationship goes back a lot longer, and I wanted to bring attention to that, highlighting the work of artists such as Dillinger and Little John who sang about Clarks many years before.”\n\nWatch a video of Major Stitch AKA Jah Stitch tell the story of the Clarks Desert Boot."
