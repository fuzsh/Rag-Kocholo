        "text": "…endeavors – in order to make ends meet beyond his salary at American Bandstand, was his entry into the record label ownership business.\n\nJamie Records\n\nIn 1957 Dick Clark became one-fourth owner of Jamie Records. The first three acts to appear on the label were The Tritones, The Sharps and Robert Byrd and his Orchestra.\n\nJamie’s first significant sign was a guitar player who specialized in instrumentals featuring his electric bass guitar as the lead instrument. This was Duane Eddy who was brought to the attention of Jamie Records by his producer – Lee Hazelwood. His first release was “Moovin’ n’ Groovin'” b/w “Up and Down”. Eddy was featured as “Duane Eddy and His Twangy Guitar”. The break-through recording for Jamie Records was “Rebel-‘Rouser” released in 1958 and charting at #6 in June of 1958. The rebel-like shouts and yells – and hand claps on the recording were performed by The Rivington’s of “Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow” and “The Bird’s The Word” fame.\n\nEddy was still listed as a solo act but would soon be credited as being backed by “The Rebels” with their debut being on Jamie 1111 “Cannon Ball” b/w Mason Dixon Line”. The “Rebels” were in fact a group of session musicians that included sax players Steve Douglas and Jim Horn as well as keyboardist Larry Knechtel – who would all become regulars for Phil Spector’s studio dramatics.\n\nSwan Records\n\nStarting up Swan Records in late 1957 was Clark’s second label partnership and would feature Freddy Cannon – a singer with limited range but who provided a whole lot of excitement. (I was fortunate to see Freddy Cannon twice – once at McNichol’s Arena in Denver and once on Dick Clark’s Caravan of Stars in Fresno, California – He was the opener for both concerts and really got the crowds going.)\n\nSwan’s first signing was an artist calling himself “Dicky Doo” who was Gerry Granaham. Clark and his associates thought the backing group should have a name but no one could decide until Swan partner Tony Mammarella shouted “For Christ sakes! Call them the ‘Don’ts!” Their first effort was Swan catalog number 4001 “Did You Cry” backed with “Click Clack” the “B” side. “Did You Cry” stumbled but “Click Clack” managed to become the charting side. One member of “The Don’ts” was former Rhythm Orchid Dave Alldred from that band which featured also Jimmy Bowen and Buddy Knox.\n\nIn the 1960’s Frank Slay would form Chicory Records and was a frequent visitor to Denver, Colorado to seek recording talent – attending KIMN radio’s “Battle of the Bands”. He landed The Boenqee Cryque, and The Rainy Daze among others.\n\nThe first big break-through for Swan came with a song written by Freddy Cannon’s mother with some assistance (probably a lot) from Bob Crewe and Frank Slay. Clark in his autobiography gives himself credit for suggesting the loud foot stomping beat in “Tallahassee Lassie” which put the record over the top and put Cannon on the road to fame.\n\nDick Clark tells of taking the idea for Swan Records label design directly from Specialty Records. He relates “We ripped off their label, after a fashion. They had a black and yellow label with special signature logo; we copied the label in maroon on white because we couldn’t afford more than one color.”\n\nLet’s Dance!\n\nAmerican Bandstand was all about the kids and the dancing. From the start the national viewing audience wanted to see the latest dance steps and the Bandstand camera crew accommodated them with close-ups of the dancer’s feet. Dick Clark recalls how many time new dances would spring up on Bandstand that didn’t have an actual recording to go with it. A good example was a dance the Philadelphia kids were doing which would become known as the “the stroll”.\n\nThe kids lined up for this dance to one of Chuck Willis’ recordings “C.C. Rider”. A guest act on Bandstand watched and asked Clark what they were doing. He told them and so they returned home to soon cut a new record. The Diamonds would realize a smash success with “The Stroll” a dance which will be performed as long at the last baby boomer can hit the dance floor.\n\nAnother example of reverse engineering a dance without a record was a popular step on Bandstand called the Calypso Cha-Cha. Clark’s own Swan Records would respond to this need with the release of Billy and Lillie’s “Luck Lady Bug”.\n\nA monster dance step was introduced primarily on Bandstand when a young black couple were doing it. The Bandstand regulars gathered around to watch. Clark asked the couple what in the world they were doing to which they responded “The Twist!” as though he should have known. Soon Clark witnessed many of the Bandstand kids doing the step as well. Ernest Evans recorded a near identical version of the song as Hank Ballard’s earlier effort and hit the big time – twice in fact – with “The Twist” going to number one in successive years, making it the only record ever during the rock and roll era to re-enter the charts and return to the number 1 position.\n\nCameo-Parkway Records\n\nCameo Records was the beneficiary of many dance steps introduced on Bandstand – filling the need for a corresponding recording with releases from The Orlons (“The Wha Watusi” and “Crossfire”), Dee Dee Sharp (“Mashed Potatoes”), Bobby Rydell (“The Cha Cha Cha”), Chubby with (“Dance the Mess Around”, “The Fly”, “Limbo Rock”), Dee Dee Sharp (“Mashed Potato Time, “Ride”, and “Gravy”), and The Dovells (“The Bristol Stomp”, “Do the New Continental”, “Bristol Twistin’ Annie”, and “Hully Gully Baby”)\n\nCameo-Parkway was Philadelphia based and the label owners had close ties to Dick Clark. The entire label stable had easy access to appearing on American Bandstand and were often summoned with little notice when an act failed to show.\n\nClark’s dealings outside of American Bandstand would come into question when the ‘payola hearings’ descended on the music industry and he would be forced at the suggestion of ABC to divest himself of his publishing and record label interests. These interests would still be in question when Clark was summoned to appear before the payola congressional hearings – More on those hearings later which were a thinly veiled assault on rock and roll and black music in general."
