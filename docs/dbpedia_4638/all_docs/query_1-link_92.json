        "text": "When and why did you join the Recording Academy?\n\nOh, man. I joined years ago. I always wanted to be a member. First, I was a non-voting member, and some of it was [that] I wanted to go to the GRAMMY block party that they had every year in Nashville. I always thought that looked really, really cool.\n\nBut I just thought it was important as a musician to be a part of the organization and take it very seriously. When I had enough album credits to be a voting member, that was a really big deal to me.\n\nTo you, what does it mean to be an RA member?\n\nWell, I feel responsible for the music that's being put out there. Not just myself as a recording artist myself, but also just as a member, what we choose to shine a light on.\n\nAnd also, to help music for the future [through] GRAMMYs In The Schools. I try to get involved in that part of things as well. I think it's the one organization that is run by creatives, and I think it's our job to shape not only the music of today, but of tomorrow.\n\nFrom your perspective, why should others also join the Recording Academy?\n\nFor that same reason. The more diverse voices we have — the more voices we have — the better the organization's going to be.\n\nI think you've got to care about it. Like I said, it's the one organization that's run by creatives, and so we've got to be involved.\n\nWhy is it important for Recording Academy voting members to vote in the annual GRAMMYs process?\n\nI think a lot of people complain when they see the nominations come out, and most of the people complaining are people who don't vote. Voting's the only power any of us have in any place, whether it be within the Recording Academy or within our own government. You want yourself represented? Vote.\n\nPerhaps some of the complainers would do right by getting involved.\n\nThey have no idea. A lot of people who complain, they see a headline or something, and they think they know what's going on with committees and all that.\n\nI was a Nashville board member and really got to see a lot inside the organization. And I think when you really get involved, you understand why things are done the way they're done. No organization is perfect, but the GRAMMYs work really hard to keep things fair when it comes to voting. I think the people who are complaining, they're not involved.\n\nWhat projects are cooking for you right now?\n\nWell, I had a record come out in May. It's a self-titled album, even though it's my fourth album. Brandi Carlile produced it and I'm very proud of it. I'm out touring it right now. It's my rawest record I've made sonically in particular, and I'm just proud of it.\n\nCan you talk about what Brandi brought to the record?\n\nI'd never worked on a solo project with another recording artist being the producer. I was involved in [Ashley McBryde's] Lindeville record and John Osborne produced that. That was my first experience with another artist to produce something. But I wasn't at the helm of that.\n\nWhen Brandi approached me about us working together, I thought that's kind of cool.I enjoyed Lindeville, and so I dove in with her. I think having another recording artist behind the glass is an advantage because she comes at it as a recording artist, and so she wants to get to the truest part of me or whoever she's working with.\n\nAnd she really did. She asks tough questions, she challenges. She's a world-class singer, so she can say, \"Hey, how about you do it like this and really do it?\" And brings so many gifts to the table that she shares with whoever she's making a record with.\n\n4 Ways To Maximize Your Recording Academy Membership\n\nWhat is the Online Entry Process and how does it work?\n\nMarking the first step toward participating in the GRAMMY Awards process every year, the annual Online Entry Process is the period when registered Media Companies and Recording Academy Members (both Voting and Professional Members) can submit music and works for GRAMMY consideration at the 2025 GRAMMYs.\n\nWhile the total amount of entries varies each year, the Recording Academy can receive more than 20,000 eligible entries during a GRAMMY season. Once we receive submissions, each entry is individually and manually vetted by a member of the Recording Academy's Awards staff to determine its eligibility.\n\nAfter submissions are received during the Online Entry Process, the Recording Academy's Voting Members vote on said submissions across two GRAMMY voting rounds: First Round Voting determines the nominees for the majority of the categories at the annual GRAMMY Awards, while Final Round Voting determines the ultimate GRAMMY winners.\n\nThe full participation in our annual GRAMMY Awards process — from the Online Entry Period to Final Round Voting — on behalf of the Recording Academy's Membership and the music industry at large is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the GRAMMY Awards, music's only peer-voted honor.\n\nWho can submit entries during the Online Entry Process?\n\nOnly registered Media Companies and Recording Academy members (Voting and Professional) can make submissions for GRAMMY consideration through the Online Entry Process.\n\nThe Recording Academy defines a media company as a legitimate business entity whose core business function is to create, aggregate and promote audio and/or video content for multiple artists for commercial purposes, and that must have verifiable product in national U.S. commercial distribution on our approved streaming platforms within the current eligibility period. It cannot just be an imprint in name only for a single or small number of artists.\n\nWhen does Media Company registration open?\n\nMedia Company Registration for the 2025 GRAMMYs is open now and closes August 23 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. Existing or new Media Companies may register here. Media Companies will receive further information by email pending registration approval. Reference the Online Entry Process resources for more information.\n\nWhen does the Online Entry Process open?\n\nThe Online Entry Process for the 2025 GRAMMYs opens today (Wednesday, July 17) and closes Friday, Aug. 30, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET.\n\nIMPORTANT: There is only one round in which to make entries during the Online Entry Process. We encourage everyone to submit their entries as early as possible so that the Recording Academy's Awards team can assist with any questions in a timely manner. If a recording is not formally submitted, it cannot be considered for a GRAMMY Award or a GRAMMY nomination.\n\nWhat is the eligibility period for submissions for the 2025 GRAMMYs?\n\nThe eligibility period for the 2025 GRAMMYs is for recordings released Sept. 16, 2023, through Aug. 30, 2024. All releases must be available for sale, via general distribution, to the public by this date and through at least the date of the current year's voting deadline (final ballot) to be eligible for the 2025 GRAMMY Awards.\n\nHow do I submit recordings and releases for the 2025 GRAMMYs as a Recording Academy member?\n\nRecording Academy members, follow these steps to submit your music and releases during the Online Entry Process for the 2025 GRAMMYs:\n\nLog in to your Recording Academy Member dashboard and find the Submit To Online Entry Process button on the left side of your dashboard\n\nOnce logged in, please review the available resource documents and begin making your entries\n\nMake sure you submit your entries by the deadline: Friday, Aug. 30, by 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET\n\nHow do I submit recordings and releases for the 2025 GRAMMYs as a registered Media Company?\n\nRegistered Media Companies, follow these steps to submit your music and releases during the Online Entry Process for the 2025 GRAMMYs:\n\nVisit the Entry Process & Registration Updates Page\n\nClick MAKE ENTRIES HERE (will direct you to entry site)\n\nSelect MEDIA COMPANY LOGIN\n\nOnce logged in, please review the resource documents and begin making your entries\n\nMake sure you submit your entries by the deadline: Friday, Aug. 30, by 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET.\n\nWho can vote for the 2025 GRAMMYs?\n\nEach year, GRAMMY winners and GRAMMY nominees are determined as voted by the Recording Academy's Voting membership, which is composed of music creators, including artists, producers, songwriters, and engineers. Registered Companies are not permitted to vote in the GRAMMY Awards process.\n\nLearn more about our GRAMMY Awards voting process and the full GRAMMY Awards process.\n\nHere is a list of all the key dates for the 2025 GRAMMYs:\n\nSept. 16, 2023 – Aug. 30, 2024\n\nProduct Eligibility Period\n\nThe period by which recordings are submitted for GRAMMY consideration.

Recording Academy Voting Members — made up of artists, songwriters, producers, and engineers active in the music industry — are eligible to vote for the annual GRAMMY Awards, ultimately determining the outcomes on Music's Biggest Night and shaping music history.\n\nThe Recording Academy's membership invitation process is community-driven and peer-reviewed annually, focusing on two types of membership: Voting Membership for music creators and Professional Membership for music business professionals. (GRAMMY U is the third type of Academy membership and follows a distinct application process.)\n\nEach year, interested musicians and professionals must apply for membership by March 1.
