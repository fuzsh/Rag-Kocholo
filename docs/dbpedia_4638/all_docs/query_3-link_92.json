        "text": "House label Vibe To The Moon has returned with a new single by Roland Clark, Dance Or Die, which is set to be released on 29 April.\n\nThe imprint, which was founded by US-based producer Nightsteppaz, previously hosted releases from Joeski, Jay Tripwire, MANIK, Audio Soul Project and others, before taking an extended hiatus.\n\nDance Or Die is the first release for the re-launched label, which will see a host of new cuts from leading house producers over the coming year.\n\n‘We are elated to announce the relaunching of our label after an extended hiatus, with this deep and jackin’ single from the legendary Roland Clark,’ the label said in a statement.\n\n‘In the coming months, we also have new music coming from Joeski, Robert Babicz, Mihai Popoviciu, Huxley, and of course the label boss, Nightsteppaz… plus many other top-class artists. Re-launch sequence is engaged. Countdown has begun. Vibe is set to overdrive mode. Next stop: the moon!’\n\nRoland Clark is renowned as one of house music’s leading producers and vocalists, collaborating with artists such as Fatboy Slim and Armand Van Helden over the years, while also recently being inducted into Pete Tong’s BBC Radio 1 ‘Hall of Fame’.\n\nAs he told 909originals in a recent interview, “I see the so-called ‘scene’ like a spider’s web, it starts off small but can get as big as the spider wants it to be, and the only thing that can intercept the web is us as artists giving up.” Read the full interview here.\n\nRoland Clark’s Dance Or Die is released on 29 April on Vibe Me To The Moon.
