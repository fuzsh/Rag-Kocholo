After two albums on Shelter, the label was sold to MCA, but Petty wouldn't go along, leading both labels to sue him for breach of contract. The lawsuits took a huge toll on Petty, who self-financed recording of the group's third album, Damn The Torpedoes, as the battles were being waged in court. Petty's legal ground rests on a deal he made with Shelter stipulating that he \"consult and cooperate in the process\" if the label changed distribution. For Petty, it's a way of renegotiating the band's record contract and his publishing deal, but it's also about principle. \"The idea of being told to report to those guys really pissed me off,\" he says. Legal impasses like this one have stalled the careers Bruce Springsteen, John Fogerty, and many others. Looking to avoid this fate and knowing the labels have bigger legal guns, Petty goes the bankruptcy route, which gives MCA lots of incentive to settle. Petty states $576,638 in debts with $56,845 in assets; these numbers are dubious, but until they can be verified, legal action against Petty is proscribed. The tactic works: A deal is reached where Petty signs with the MCA subsidiary Backstreet Records under new terms. Both sides save face, and Damn The Torpedoes, with some songs, like \"Refugee,\" inspired by the legal wrangling, is released in October. Petty earns a reputation as one who won't back down.\n\nCategories\n\nLegal Issues\n\nMusic Industry"
