Our team represents and supports the world’s best in flow, pressure, level, temperature control products, and a full range of small pumps and specialty valves. Each product line has been chosen to fill unique niches and specialized application needs. We work daily to match our customer’s specific requirements to quality components.\n\nINNOVATION & SUPPORT\n\nOur sales representatives have hands-on training with our various components and constantly work new applications driven by ever-evolving markets. In cooperation with the partnering manufacturers, we advise and guide product developers, design engineers, R&D communities, and universities to choose the appropriate component based on the application details, quality/life cycles, and price. If requested, we regularly assist with adapting and/or modifying product to fit the unique application. We stay involved throughout the prototype/design process and follow through to the production/implementation and fulfillment stages.\n\nSTAGING & SCHEDULING\n\nIn addition to a large range of on-hand standard warehouse products, Clark Solutions for years has developed quantity-based pricing programs, offered warehouse and assembly services to satisfy special customer needs, provided scheduling assistance, and staged shipping programs from our warehouse facility in Hudson, MA.\n\nQUALITY & SERVICE\n\nWe continue to succeed through dedication to long term product quality, support and service. Most of our quality pumps, valves and instrumentation components are manufactured in ISO-approved factories or third party calibrated manufacturing processes. Our service goal is develop long term repeat business through quality and service.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1962, E. Clark & Associates was founded as a regional factory representative for the New England Area specializing in instrumentation and controls. The focus was primarily dedicated to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) marketplace.\n\nIn January of 1980, new ownership (The Tyler Co., Inc.) continued forward with the E. Clark & Associates name and began to diversify the business. The company expanded from New England to geographical region encompassing North and South America. The addition of compatible new product lines and the development of our own in-house manufactured products continue to be essential in maintaining our relevance and usefulness to our customer base.\n\nTo better reflect the sales team’s abilities and daily efforts to provide custom product solutions, the company’s name was eventually updated to Clark Solutions. Today, the company represents over 25 companies from the USA and 8 nations worldwide. Our group offers a wide range of small pumps, specialty valve, and instrumentation devices to record, monitor, and control flow, velocity, pressure, temperature, humidity, level, gas concentration, and other properties. The diversified product lines support numerous industries in the HVAC, process, analytical /automated chemistry instrumentation markets, general automation, fluidic and air control marketplaces.\n\nClark Solutions continues today working with unique manufacturers to source and provide high quality competitively priced pumps (liquids, gases, and air), specialized valve (manual & electrically actuated), instrumentation control products (flow, pressure, level and temperature), and data acquisition systems."
