        "text": "ABOUT\n\nKyle Clark is a 26-year-old artist, songwriter, producer born in Honolulu, Hawaii and raised in Jefferson, Georgia After winning the 101.5 Kicks Radio competition in Atlanta 2 years in row, Kyle’s songs found their way to hit songwriter Jordan Schmidt (Blake Shelton/Tyler Hubbard) who offered him a publishing deal at Sony Music Publishing in 2019. Within the 1st year on writing in town, Clark co-wrote his first RIAA certified Gold single (Lily Rose’s “Villain”) which led to more major label cuts with Jon Pardi, Mitchell Tenpenny, Restless Road, Chayce Beckham, Mackenzie Carpenter, Erin Kinsey & more. Facing the pandemic, Kyle focused his efforts on learning how to produce his own music, leaning into Schmidt and his roommate, producer Jacob Durrett (Morgan Wallen, Breland). His efforts paid off in early 2022 when a video featuring Clark’s unreleased song “Hope It’s Hot Out” went viral on Tiktok. HIHO was released on 5.27.22 quickly crossing 1 million streams its first week & has since garnered over 35 million streams independently."
