        "text": "Clarks has moved into the Metaverse with Beyond Worlds, a partnership with Empire Music that provided fans around the world with the opportunity to experience a one-in-a-lifetime concert. Headlined by leading Afrobeats artist Fireboy DML and supported by Nigerian singer Nissi and Cape Verdean American singer-songwriter June Freedom, the show saw the artists defy boundaries and push the limit of music performances.\n\nCombining the typical excitement and intimacy of a concert with a newfound sense of otherworldly magic that mirrors the enchantment that the music evokes, the interactive show was brought to life in three distinct worlds built to embody each artist. Through Beyond Worlds, Clarks, Empire Music, and Fireboy DML have shown us the power of bringing the music industry into the Metaverse.\n\nWe hear from Fireboy about his work with Clarks in the metaverse, where he’d like to see the industry go, and taking life one step at a time.\n\nRead the interview…\n\nWhere did your love for music come from?\n\nFrom solitude. As a child who often spent time alone in his room reading books or writing poems, I often accompanied these activities with music. I’d listen to American/British pop, alternative soul, R&B and, of course, Afrobeats. I’ve always been fascinated by art, and all the elements of art kept me company while growing up.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in music?\n\nMy desire to pursue a career in music started when I got into university — my first time living life away from home. I was hanging with the coolest kids in school so I’d often go to the studio with them to watch them make music. I made my first studio recorded song when I was 17 and since then I have never looked back. I’d found purpose. It was that conviction that sealed it for me. I immediately knew I was going to do music for the rest of my life.\n\nHow would you describe your sound?\n\nSoulful, sensual, and, because I’m African, sometimes very colourful and energetic.\n\nHow has your sound transformed since embarking on your career?\n\nMusic and fame have taken me far and wide, so I’ve lived many lives since I started out. These experiences have shaped my sound in many ways. The best way to explain this is the stark difference in the three studio albums I’ve released so far. All different versions and sounds of me. From the innocent and soulful Laughter, Tears and Goosebumps to the reflective APOLLO, and then to the very colourful Playboy, you can hear the growth and vast experience I’ve had so far. I’m excited for what’s in store for me next.\n\nWe loved your collaboration with Clarks, Beyond Worlds in partnership with EMPIRE — what made you want to team up with them? What do Clarks signify to you?\n\nThank you. Clarks is a brand I strongly resonate with because they attune to my calm style when it comes to fashion. To me, Clarks signify the art of being subtle yet stylish. I strongly relate to that.\n\nTalk us through your contribution to the metaverse experience?\n\nI’m still learning and getting more knowledge into the metaverse myself, but it’s refreshing to know that I could contribute to the experience the only way I know how to — music. I love making people happy and I’d never turn down an opportunity to spread the gospel of African music to the world, and the metaverse is no exception.\n\nWhat was it like to collaborate with the likes of Nissi and June Freedom?\n\nThey’re family. Amazing musicians and, beyond that, amazing people. It was a beautiful experience getting to do this with artists I share a label with. It’s always fun when creatives get to do great things not alone, but together.\n\nWhat change would you like to see in the industry?\n\nI’ll speak for the Afrobeats music industry because that’s my reality. I’d love to see a structure that supports ALL stakeholders in the industry — songwriters, producers, A&Rs, and other music executives that contribute to the growth of African music. We all need to reap the benefits together. And I believe we’re getting there.\n\nWhere would you like to take your artistry?\n\nThe only thing I’m looking at right now is working hard to make sure my brand gets bigger and my music reaches a wider audience. I want to go down as an all time great."
