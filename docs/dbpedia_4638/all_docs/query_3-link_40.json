        "text": "The Complete Sonny Clark\n\nBlue Note Sessions\n\nIt’s impossible to sum up Sonny Clark’s music as sounding like the music of one player or another without adding a “but” to the description, including appreciative words about one component or another of his playing that was his alone.\n\nYes, he could match the speed and rhythmic inventiveness of Powell, but added a lyrical effortlessness that was never Powell’s. In a hard bop vein, he could recall Horace Silver, but Clark was groovier and more buoyant. When Clark would give voice to his bluesy side – as he did on two dates focusing on shorter-length singles for the jukebox market – he was matchless.\n\nThe extended solos of his trio work revealed what was frequently a horn-like and fluid approach to playing, sometimes catching him discover, become fascinated with, and deeply explore a new harmonic or rhythmic idiom, without ever abandoning his natural instinct to swing.\n\nHis “Sonny Clark Trio” date from October of 1957 is undoubtedly one of the best examples anywhere, from anyone, of how piano, bass, and drums can work together to create as satisfying a musical experience you could hope to find. Clark’s ensemble dates are easy evidence of why he was so often chosen to occupy the piano bench.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a more careful, thoughtful, and supportive teammate, always listening, always filling holes, always economically moving a tune forward with just the right beam of light.\n\nEven in his last session for Blue Note in 1962, regardless of what his lifestyle was doing to his life, his musical instincts were sharp, critical, challenging and lively, proving good support isn’t just welcome, it’s indispensable. The album of that session, “Leapin’ And Lopin,’” is on at least one list of the most essential albums from 1945 to 1970, and justly so.\n\nSaxophonist Johnny Griffin singled him out for his attack on the instrument that recalled Bud Powell’s, but lauded Clark for his finesse and exceptional technique. Dexter Gordon said Clark was his favorite piano accompanist. If you need any other proof of how highly he was regarded, his memorial service included performances by Thelonious Monk and Jackie McLean.\n\nSonny Clark\n\nSonny Clark grew up the last of eight kids, 20 miles east of Pittsburgh in a mining town with a “2” in the name (the mining company whose workers lived there operated two shafts. Clark’s dad, who mined coal, died from lung disease when his boy was just two months old). A photograph of his second grade class shows that Clark was the only black kid among 32 students.\n\nHe started playing piano where he was four, displaying early prowess. Clark was already performing on piano at the local black hotel when he was still in grade school and at 15, he performed at an historic “Night of the Stars” concert that featured Earl Hines, Mary Lou Williams, Billy Strayhorn, Errol Garner, Billy Eckstine, Roy Eldridge, and others.\n\nA trip to California to visit relatives in 1951 proved momentous for the then-19 year old musician. He stayed on the West Coast for six years, working extensively with Oscar Pettiford and Wardell Gray, making his recording debut with Teddy Charles. His 1954-55 tenure with Buddy DeFranco brought him considerable exposure nationally. Known primarily as a soloist, he was schooled in comping by listening to Hampton Hawes. From then on, Clark was considered one of the most naturally sympathetic pianists in the business, making him forever in demand.\n\nA cross-country tour in 1957 with Dinah Washington ultimately brought him to New York (a more comfortable setting musically for him than the West Coast) where he gigged with Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon, and after making his recording debut for Blue Note with Hank Mobley, almost everybody.\n\nThe surface details of Sonny Clark’s brief life are far too familiar to jazz lovers – a dependable and innovative young talent, cut down too young because of addiction. One contemporary jazz journalist expressed in 1962 the deep sorrow of witnessing “one of our jazz greats” trapped in a path that could only lead in one direction.\n\nAlfred Lion of Blue Note first hired him on a 1957 date for Hank Mobley, and that set the stage for most of his recorded output. Including the nine dates he led for Blue Note Clark was on 22 dates between June 1957 and April 1958, and another 13 from August 1961 and October 1962. His health may have been challenged, but his musicianship was soaring.\n\nThe Complete Sonny Clark Blue Note Sessions\n\nMosaic MD6-276\n\nDisc One:\n\nDial “S” For Sonny\n\n1.

Disc two begins with side two of the LP, followed by two alternates and the “My Conception” session out of chronological sequence. The third session “Sonny Clark Trio” could not fit on disc two in its entirety."
