        "text": "by G.E. Hewitt\n\nIntroduction\n\nElectronic overdubs of Patsy Cline's music have been produced since 1962, including duets and remixes. However, this page is not an exhaustive report, and the overdubs found in this discography are primarily those made by Patsy Cline's main record labels, and/or under the supervision of original producer Owen Bradley. Performances are catalogued in session format using the date of overdub, rather than the date of the original recording sessions when the vocals were recorded.\n\nSessions Reported: 12\n\nPerformances Reported: 26\n\nUnique Songs Reported: 21\n\nUnique Issues Reported: 32"
