        "text": "Larry Clark (b. 1963) is the founder and President of Excelcia Music Publishing as well as President of Wingert-Jones Publications, Kendor Music Publishing, and RBC Publications. His company focuses on educational music for band, choral, Jazz ensemble and orchestra along with related methods and books. Prior to Larry starting his own publishing company he served for nineteen years as Vice President, Editor-in-Chief for Carl Fischer Music, and before that an Instrumental Music Editor for Warner Bros. Publications. He travels the world presenting clinic/workshops and guest conducting appearances. His diverse background as a former middle school and university band director at Syracuse University, combined with his composing and editing, have placed Larry at the forefront of music for school ensembles.\n\nHis music is some of the most popular and most performed by concert bands and string orchestras of all ability levels. Larry is equally adept at writing music for beginners as he is for high school and college ensembles. His music is characterized by rhythmic verve, tuneful melodies, contains a fresh harmonic perspective, is well scored and stretches the musicianship of the performers. He prides himself on producing music that is not only intriguing to performers and audiences alike but that contains a playability that comes from a keen understanding of the technical difficulties inherent in all instruments. His pieces have been performed internationally and appear on numerous contest/festival performance required music lists. He is an ASCAP award-winning composer, has over 400 publications in print and is in demand to write commissions for bands and orchestras across the country.\n\nLarry's music has been influenced by a variety of composers and teachers. He credits his father, a long time band director in Florida, for teaching him the joy of music. He was influenced early in his writing career by composer Robert W. Smith. His decision to pursue composition and arranging was influenced further by Dr. John Hillard, composition professor at James Madison University. Dr. Pat Rooney, director of bands at James Madison University, gave Larry his first performance opportunities by performing his arrangements with the popular Marching Royal Dukes. Larry considers himself to be a product of the school band movement. His works are highly influenced by the standard band repertoire of composers such as Holst, Grainger, Schuman and Persichetti.\n\nLarry is in demand as a clinician and guest conductor around the country. He has presented clinics recently at the Midwest Clinic, the New York State School Music Association conference, the Texas Music Educators Association conference, the Ohio Music Educators Association conference, the Florida Music Educators Association conference and the Wisconsin Music Educators Association conference as well as numerous guest-conducting appearances internationally.\n\nHe is co-author with Sandy Feldstein of the innovative band method The Yamaha Advantage. He holds a Bachelors Degree in Music Education from Florida State University and Masters Degrees in Conducting and Composition from James Madison University in Virginia.\n\nShort Version for Programs\n\nMusic by Larry Clark is some of the most popular and most performed by concert bands and string orchestras of all ability levels.
