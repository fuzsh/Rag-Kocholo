        "text": "Harold Bloom is the leading literary critic of our time and the only one in English whose influence and originality can rival that of Jacques Derrida, the French philosopher. Like Derrida, whom he resembles more than he would like, he has an indexical intelligence, a deep-seated if complicated Freudianism, and is the formulator of a critical concept that has passed into the language, \"the anxiety of influence\". Like Derrida, he is Jewish, and was born four days before him on July 11, 1930.\n\nSome of Bloom's reputation, which is larger in America than in Britain, has to do with his extraordinary pedagogic personality, and a myth of genius that engulfs him in a golden cloud. That personality blows itself through his criticism, and its velocity can be felt on every page he writes.\n\nHe is, for instance, inhumanly prolific. Shakespeare: The Invention Of The Human (Fourth Estate) his marvellous new book, is his 23rd, an output that began in 1959 with Shelley's Mythmaking, and has included works on Blake, on Yeats, on the early book of the Hebrew Bible (The Book Of J), on American millennial religions (Omens Of Millennium) and indeed the whole of Western literature (The Western Canon). In addition, he has edited and written separate introductions for over 500 books in the Chelsea House Modern Critical Views series, which cover novelists and poets over the span of English literature. There is a voracity, here: it is as if Bloom has kidnapped the whole of English literature and released his hostages one by one, over a lifetime, on his own spirited terms.\n\nUndoubtedly, this busyness has produced some hurried, repetitive, speculative and even facile work. The Book Of J asserted, for instance, and with no evidence at all, that much of Genesis, Exodus and Numbers was written by a woman. But his weak books seem just the gases emitted by a natural and overwhelming energy. That is the cost of combustion, and it is always combustion that interests us.\n\n\"What makes Harold seem at times absurd is also the secret of his great talents,\" says Sir Frank kermode, a friend and occasional colleague. \"The vitality is quite natural and unaffected, and thus has a kind of self-deprecating self-confidence.\" He has taught at Yale University continuously since 1955, where he is celebrated and adored (though he likes to complain that he is envied and despised). In interviews, and in his books, he wages war against nearly all other American academic critics, accusing them of being Marxists, deconstructionists, feminists, and haters of literature. They are what he has called \"the School of Resentment... wretched children. I taught most of them.\" But he loves teaching, and has told the current president of Yale that he intends to be carried out of his last class in a bodybag.\n\nIt will be a large bag: his physical and temperamental presence is outsized. His heroes are similarly proportioned - Falstaff, Dr Johnson, Chesterton - and like those men he prefers his own battered truths to other people's preferred errors. He sometimes joyfully refers to himself as \"Bloomstaff\".\n\nCorrespondingly, readers and students either find him deeply addictive or deeply resistible. \"He has an enormous appeal to the young,\" says Kermode. \"there are so many groupies it's unbelievable. Harold and I were once teaching at Santa Cruz. We had arrived the night before and the next morning I went to Harold's room to collect him for breakfast. He was already having breakfast with about 16 people, mostly women.\"\n\nHe is exuberant (and exuberance is a quality he most admires in Shakespeare and in Shakespeare's characters), generous, campy (he calls everyone \"my dear\" and refers to chosen writers as if they were friends: Whitman is \"the divine Walt,\" Emerson is \"Waldo\" and the literary theorist Stanley Fish is \"the Fishy-foo\"), and hopelessly in love with literature.\n\nHe has what he himself calls \"preternatural powers of recall\". At Cornell University, where he went as an undergraduate, his teacher, the Romantic scholar MH Abrams, once lost his place in Paradise Lost, and was put right by the young Bloom, who knew the entire poem by heart. It is alleged that Bloom knows all of Shakespeare's plays by heart. Already, by the age of 17, he had memorised much of the English Romantic canon, and literature is mnemonically alive for him, almost as if he were a monk living in an age of oral transmission, before the printing press.\n\nAnd he is frankly religious, in this regard: \"Bardolatry, the worship of Shakespeare, ought to be even more a secular religion than it already is,\" he writes in his new book. Or rather, Bloom's religion of literature is in fact a religion of the self, a kind of Emersonian holiness, in which only the self finally matters. This enables Bloom, in fine American fashion, to have his cake and eat it, preaching a religion (there is no difference between sacred and secular texts, he has said) which is healthily stripped of all moralism, and all God-centredness.\n\nLiterature is not so much self-improvement as self-conversation, self-prayer: the experience of literature, he has said, \"is the experience of an isolate and solipsising glory... It is the greatest and most superb of narcissistic self-indulgences: and why should it not be? What is wrong with that? It restitutes our wounded narcissism...\n\n\"People cannot stand the saddest truth I know about the very nature of reading and writing imaginative literature, which is that poetry does not teach us how to talk to other people: it teaches us how to talk to ourselves. What I'm desperately trying to do is to get students to talk to themselves as though they are indeed themselves, and not someone else.\"\n\nBloom's diction can be plumply Victorian, and he often speaks with a vatic weariness, (he once explained that the secret of his productivity was \"sleeplessness,\" and then added: \"And many, many enemies.\") At times, this weariness makes him seem a kind of metaphysical grandparent to us, as if he had already thought our thoughts for us, and seen around what we can only knock our heads against.\n\nWhen he teaches, his tired, shrewd, dog-eyes stare out from his sagging and neglected flesh, and he rubs his chest inside his shirt, Napoleonically, as if to remind his students that literature is always a matter of the heart, and secondly a matter of campaigns and battles. For Bloom knows that, bodybag or no, he will be known at his death as the author of one book which proposes a theory of literary battle, The Anxiety Of Influence, (1973). I hope he will be known for at least one more, The Western Canon, an extraordinary, popular critical work, comparable only with certain nineteenth- and eighteenth-century works, such as Walter Scott's Lives Of The Novelists, and remembered as the greatest populariser of Shakespeare in our time.\n\nUnlike The Western Canon, The Anxiety Of Influence is an academic work, written at the height of Bloom's involvement with Freudianism. It has been influential, in part because like so much great work it freshly activates something we have always known but lacked the precise words for. It has always been clear, for instance, that great writers need to wrestle with their literary predecessors, and that this struggle may be violent; one needs to slay the fathers the better to appear as a brilliant orphan.\n\nBloom, who has a talent unusual among scholars for thinking as a writer might think, merely describes this battle of the generations in Freudian terms. The key words, in Bloom's lexicon, are \"repression\" and \"anxiety\". A strong poet, say Keats, will read his strongest predecessor or contemporary, say Wordsworth. The younger poet will feel anxious about the overbearing influence and power of the older poet, because the latter, or \"strong precursor\", is the one whose voice it is hardest to escape. Necessarily, being anxious about this influence, Keats will \"misread\" Wordsworth, ie will read him differently from the way a non-poetic contemporary might, will read him selfishly and for his own purposes.\n\nAll literature, contends Bloom, is a process of such misreading, at various levels of strength: Milton misreads Shakespeare, Wordsworth misreads Milton, Keats misreads Wordsworth, and so on. The strongest poets will be those who most successfully assert their originality over their inheritance, and who most powerfully banish the traces of the precursor from their own work. Of course - and here Bloom shows his Freudianism most clearly - they do not actually banish those traces, they repress them, successfully or not. As Freud has it, the repressed always returns. The precursor can always be found, and it is the critic's task to trace out the anxieties and repressions. More than this, maintains Bloom, criticism is itself a matter of weak or strong misreading. It is never really, for the critic, a matter of accuracy to a text; it is a matter of bending that text into the form of one's own intelligent distortions.\n\nAll kinds of objection can be made to this theory (for instance, it describes the poetic lineage much better than the novelistic), but it is one of those ideas that is tougher than anything its opponents can scrawl on it. Indeed, despite its being a description of poetic influence, we could apply, as an example, the anxiety of influence to Martin Amis's work.\n\nThough Amis claims Bellow and Nabokov as his strongest influences, a Bloomian would be bound to observe that Amis's real, unacknowledged influence, and hence \"strong precursor\" is his father, Kingsley, and Kingsley's very English comedy. A Bloomian might then go on to suggest that Martin Amis, because he has not banished his father from his own work, is a weak, rather than a strong misreader of Kingsley Amis, and thus a not entirely strong novelist.\n\nAbove all, Bloom's most brilliant contribution has perhaps been to revolutionise - Freudianise - our notion of literary allusion. Before Bloom, allusion was simply the obvious references and debts that one writer pays in his work to a predecessor. But Bloom's anxiety of influence allows us to see that the truest allusion will be the one that is not apparent, because a writer does not want to own up to the writer who is most bothering him.\n\nThe poet Tom Paulin says that what he likes about this idea of poetic inheritance is \"less the Oedipal struggle and fist-fighting than the idea of poets speaking to each other, as if in heaven all the writers are singing to each other , like whales. For instance, I like the way the inheritance, in Bloom's scheme, goes forwards and backwards, so that Shelley can sometimes sound like yeats just because Yeats so completely absorbed Shelley that no-one has really noticed.\"\n\nNot all writers agree. John Updike has called Bloom's theories \"tortuous\" and the poet Howard Nemerov dismissed them as \"charlatanly\". But Bloom is serene about this. When writers tell him that they don't suffer from anxiety of influence, he hugs them and says \"Forget it\". It is not the writer's business to know it, but the critic's. \"Why diagnose their disease for them when, in fact, it's better for them not only to have the disease, but to have it in a pure form?\" asks Bloom.\n\nBloom was born into an Orthodox Jewish family, in New York City. His parents spoke Yiddish all their lives; their son didn't hear English spoken until he was six, and has said that English still has a \"somewhat acquired\" quality for him. His father, a garment worker, was from Odessa, and his mother, whose father had been a carpenter, was from Brest Litovsk.\n\nPart of Bloom's struggle with the Yale establishment in the 1950s, a struggle he now wages with those radicals he calls the School of Resentment, may stem from the modesty of his family background. About the contemporary leftish theorists, be notes: \"I am a proletarian; they are not. I'm almost the only person I know at Yale University who was born and raised in a working-class family.\n\n\"I am the son of a New York garment worker, who was an unwilling member of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union, which he always despised. These critics [the School of Resentment] are American versions of that Parisian intellectual and social disease I can least abide - it is responsible for almost all French literary and critical attitudes, including deconstruction, from the middle nineteenth century to the present day - which is the high bourgeoisie being unable to stand its status as the high bourgeoisie, while continuing to enjoy it in every possible respect. How is it that they don't bore themselves to death?\n\n\"I can walk into the Yale Library periodical room any afternoon I want to, and I swear that I can read 15 to 20 fresh attacks on me for forgetting that the social world exists. They thus reclaim their originality and genius by simply discovering what i say all the time anyway.\"\n\nBloom, like so many first generation Americans, got his education at a local public library, in his case in the Bronx. His sister gave him, when he was 10, a copy of the poems of Hart Crane. From there, he moved onto Blake, Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth. In his new book, he speaks with rapture of seeing, in 1946 at 16, a performance of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, with Ralph Richardson as Falstaff. This seems to have ignited his deep love of Shakespeare, and his obsessive regard for Falstaff.\n\nOne of Bloom's several attractions is that he is a boisterous pugilist. At Yale, in the 1950s, he fought the prevailing orthodoxy, which was a kind of neo-Christian New Criticism, heavily influenced by Eliot. Classicism had displaced romanticism; Eliot had taught readers to avoid the \"spilt religion\" of Blake and Shelley. An undergraduate would be much more likely to read Donne than, say, Blake or Milton. Bloom's first book, in defiance, was on Shelley. Bloom, of course, wants religion to be as spilt as possible; he paddles in it.\n\n\"Harold is rather delightfully priestly,\" adds Frank Kermode. \"When I was teaching at Yale he would come into my office every morning, kiss me on the head, and say Good morning, Sir Frank.' It was a kind of episcopal salute, bishop to chancellor.\"\n\nNowadays, Eliot's reign - \"the Reverend Eliot,\" as Bloom jeers - is over, and things have gone, if anything, Bloom's way. Bloom has gradually been detaching himself from Yale and writing for a larger, non-specialist audience. He followed The Anxiety Of Influence with Kabbalah And Criticism in 1976, which inaugurated his enormous interest in Jewish gnosticism and in the poetics of religion. Some of his books about religion have been his weakest. The Book Of J, in 1991, was a bestseller largely, one suspects, because of its noisy assertion that much of the earliest parts of the Bible - including the stories of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's ark - were written by a lady in Solomon's court. Unfortunately, as Frank kermode amusedly points out \"there isn't a shred of evidence\".\n\nBut Bloom has a range and a popular appeal quite beyond the usual professorial status. His new book on Shakespeare was sold for large advances and has also spent some time on American best-seller lists. Bloom continues to teach at Yale ( and at New York University, where he moonlights), but is really a General in the larger American culture wars. \"He's certainly the greatest of all academics that have existed in the Eng lit world,\" says Kermode. \"When he comes to London he stays in the Berkeley and goes around in a chauffeur-driven car. He's a model for the young; it's good to know that the peaks are there to be climbed.\" Paulin adds: \"What he does is to take the critical act absolutely seriously, wherever that leads him.\"\n\nCertainly, Bloom considers himself at war with the academy. He finds in the universities no Bloomians at all, only a motley collection of Marxists, deconstructionists, Foucaultians, and devotees of cultural studies. He has been brawling with them for at least a decade. The Western Canon was an elaboration of this fight, and his new book is another instalment.\n\nWhat is Bloom's argument with most modes of current criticism? In essence, he is saying that the great work is bigger than us, that it is grander than us. He fears that the fight against the dominance of the canon, against notions of \"greatness\", is actually a way of asserting our primacy over literature, a way of brushing literature out of the way, and replacing it with substitutes. Hence his word, \"resentment\". He accuses such people of resenting, precisely, the greatness of greatness.\n\nContemporary \"radical\" political criticism is, like Bloom's work, essentially Freudian in origin. That is to say, it proceeds on the understanding that texts are like people, and that like people, they have an unconscious. As with Freud, there is an assumption that it is the unconscious, not the conscious life, that is really interesting, and that what is hidden in the unconscious leaves a mark of its repression in the conscious life.\n\nThis is the truly monumental difference in the way that we read texts after Freud, a revolution that unites Derrida, Bloom, and the practitioners of cultural studies, despite their differences. Since Freud, we have become alert to the way that writing tries to hide, and fails to cover up, the anxieties that disturb it. That nothing is accidental (or \"natural\") in literature as in life. This is essentially the origin of deconstruction, and Bloom is, in many ways, a deconstructionist.\n\nMarxist or other forms of radical criticism add a political dimension to this Freudianism. A poem is read as if it were a dream, the product of an unconscious, as if it were covering something up. A poem is read as if it were an alibi that is rather too fluent to be entirely trusted. The critic, like an analyst or perhaps a detective, searches the text for those moments where the poem seems to be displaying its stresses; where, in effect, it is sweating.\n\nThis way of reading is absolutely standard in current academic practice: indeed, I've given a rather old-fashioned account. You can see the ways in which Bloom resembles, and is also finally fundamentally different from, this mode of reading. He would agree that a poem has secrets, but he would argue that the covering-up of those secrets is the mark of a poem's success, not of any kind of ideological hoax.\n\nBut he would deny that a poem has any political secrets; he has no interest in politics as they manifest themselves in literature. The only secrets he is interested in are literary secrets to do with literary influence. Furthermore, if contemporary literary theorists are interested in the ways that a poem fails to achieve coherence, Bloom is finally old-fashioned, in that he wants to find achieved coherence in a poem. It is a much more complicated, anxious, Freudian notion of coherence than its equivalent 50 years ago, but that is what it is.\n\nThere are plenty of \"conservative\" professors who are angry about French theory, or about Madonna-studies. They see collapsing vertebrae all around them, and pen hasty and simplistic books about how the lefties are taking over the academy. Equally, there are plenty of patriots and right-wing defenders of Shakespeare gardening for ideological roots who pull up one of Shakespeare's characters at every turn. Politicians sniff Shakespeare for orderly aromas, and quote (out of context) Ulysses from Troilus and Cressida, on order and the state.\n\nThere are plenty of mediocre fulminators. But Bloom is not one. First of all, because he is more intelligent than any of the \"conservatives\". Second, because his Freudianism is radical, not conservative. Bloom does not believe in a stable, fixed, essential human identity, which simply goes to literature for grand confirmations of its own humanity - the usual radical or theoretical charge against conservatives. He believes, on the contrary, that the self is an invention, and that literature - and above all, Shakespeare - has invented it. It is just that he wants to return the primacy to literature. He wants to put Shakespeare before Shakespeare's readers.\n\nFor Shakespeare is central, of course, to contemporary criticism, and to political criticism. If lyric poetry is always hiding its political anxieties, then Shakespeare, the greatest poet in English, must be doing this more enormously than anyone else. Perhaps, goes a current school of thought (this last word is a bit kind), Shakespeare isn't any good at all? Perhaps it is simply politics - conservative politics, of course - that has put, and keeps, Shakespeare in canonical place. Society needs the idea of a great, national bard, and so creates one in Shakespeare. It is time to study not Shakespeare, but \"the Shakespeare myth,\" the ideological canopy that keeps Shakespeare aloft.\n\nSuch critics are afraid to accord Shakespeare \"greatness\" as a writer because they fear that such ideas congeal society in postures of reverence. Greatness is an ideological category that turns us into grateful peasants, continually doffing the cap to the Master. Terence Hawkes is a genial and highly intelligent proponent of this branch of criticism. Hawkes won't quite say it aloud, but the logical conclusion of his position is that Shakespeare isn't any good - or is maybe a little bit good - and that we only read him because a lot of other people, including some quite famous writers, have told us that he is good.\n\nThere are all sorts of obvious refutations of this madness, but the interesting point is to see how subtly Bloom's Freudianism overwhelms and surrounds Hawkes's position. Bloom would say that if we have any idea of what greatness is in literature it is because Shakespeare taught us it. But more deeply than that, Bloom argues in his new book that \"Shakespeare has made us see and think what we could not have thought without him.\" This is because Shakespeare \"invented\" us.\n\nHe means by \"invention\" that the literate Western idea of what character is, of how it speaks to itself, of inwardness, of how families do or don't communicate, or how motive does and doesn't express itself, was largely created for us by Shakespeare. In the character of Hamlet, for instance, he \"invented\" Western nihilism, much of Western Romanticism, and decisively influenced Nietzsche. Indeed, Shakespeare invents the map of the mind, not Freud: \"It is Shakespeare who invents Freudian psychology. Freud finds ways of translating it into a supposedly analytical vocabulary.\"\n\nHawkes and those studying \"the Shakespearian myth\" are reading backwards, trying to strip away all our false ideas about Shakespeare so that in the end we get back to... what? To nothing, to a black hole called William Shakespeare, as Hawkes described him, \"a writer of no necessary distinction\".\n\nBloom works the other way, reading forwards from the absolute primacy of Shakespeare, and asserting again and again that we cannot escape from him, that he assimilates us, not the other way around, that he reads us. Bloom is eloquent about this: \"We are lived by drives we cannot command, and we are read by works we cannot resist. We need to exert ourselves and read Shakespeare as strenuously as we can, while knowing that his plays will read us more energetically still.\"\n\nIt is not just that Falstaff, Hamlet, Lear, Iago, Cleopatra, Lear are larger than life; \"they have altered life\". He quotes Owen Barfield, who wrote to Wittgenstein in 1929: \"There is a very real sense, humiliating as it might seem, in which what we generally venture to call our feelings are really Shakespeare's meaning'.\" In Bloom's terms, whether we like it or not, whether we know it or not, we are all weak misreaders of Shakespeare, just as Freud was.\n\nAnd it is true that Harold Bloom is not only a superb advocate for the reality and influence of Shakespeare, he is a wonderfully attractive enactment of that reality. His exuberant identification with Shakespeare's fat knight, Falstaff, with Dr Johnson (whom he worships) and with GK Chesterton, his ability to convince us that he is, indeed, Falstaffian, Johnsonian and Chestertonian, leaves us suddenly aware of a scandalous truth: Johnson and Chesterton existed while Falstaff is merely a fictional character.\n\nAnd yet it doesn't seem strange to run these names together, as if Falstaff had once been as alive as Dr Johnson (who, anyway, is the quasi-fictional Johnson of Boswell), or as alive as Harold Bloom. Thus Bloom, a great critic, also lives his literary criticism, enacts it in his soul - or, if you prefer, acts it, plays the role of Falstaff but offstage, and in so doing credits Falstaff's massive reality. This, at the very least, is more than can be said of most critics.\n\n Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human is published by Fourth Estate, price £25."
