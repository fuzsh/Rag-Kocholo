        "text": "Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human\n\nHarold Bloom\n\nFourth Estate, Â£12.99\n\nYou might have noticed that when vicars or pundits are moved to describe Jesus - \"let me tell you just what kind of a guy I think He was\" - they almost invariably describe instead a ridiculous fantasy version of themselves. This is self-delusion so blatant that it hardly counts as dishonesty.\n\nOne would hope that Professors of Literature are above making such errors, but you can't help feeling that some of them undergo a similar process of identification when they think, talk, or write about Shakespeare. And if they don't do it when they talk about Shakespeare, they do it when they talk about Hamlet. T S Eliot made the point in his 1919 essay on the subject, saying that Hamlet had \"an especial temptation for that most dangerous type of critic: the critic with a mind which is naturally of the creative order, but which through some weakness in creative power exercises itself in criticism instead\".\n\nYou may wonder what I'm doing putting Hamlet and Jesus in the same paragraph. Well, it wasn't my idea: it was Harold Bloom's. \"Hamlet is the only secular rival to his greatest precursors in personality [ie, Yahweh, Jesus, and Allah]... His total effect upon the world's culture is incalculable. After Jesus, Hamlet is the most cited figure in Western consciousness; no one prays to him, but no one evades him for long either.\" Bloom, a gnostic with his own highly idiosyncratic theories about biblical authorship, may shun the idea of prayer to an external entity; but, after reading this book, you feel that if he did pray, it would be to Hamlet.\n\nHis thesis is certainly audacious. It goes like this. Shakespeare is good; very, very good. We know this not only because he is so quotable but because his characters really do seem to exist in more dimensions than other writers' characters. Wittgenstein said that life was not like Shakespeare.\n\nBloom quotes Owen Barfield's words: \"there is a very real sense, humiliating as it may seem, in which what we generally venture to call our feelings are really Shakespeare's 'meaning'. \" Bloom takes this and runs with it: Shakespeare is not \"lifelike\" because he was a particularly talented writer; he is lifelike because Shakespeare has offered us convincing modes of being. Our minds are, thanks to him, not what they were. There is something in this, even if we don't in the end have to abide by it or take it seriously; but it does chime in with Bloom's claims for the power of literature - it is not just God we worship in the Bible, he has said, but a particular kind of literary style.\n\nWhether the rest of the book lives up to this claim is another matter. Perhaps it could not, not at this length. Each chapter is on an individual play; but not all of them can sustain Bloom's theory, and he knows it. Moreover, while no one can gainsay Bloom's deep knowledge and familiarity with his subject, I wonder what would have happened to me if I, at university, had handed in an essay which claimed that we learned to have interior selves from watching Hamlet soliloquise. (That would have been better than what I did hand in at the time.)\n\nYou wonder how useful this book would be to the earnest but struggling undergraduate. I would say very much so. It is, in a way, deranged, a long way from close reading; but it is also the product of an intelligent and sensitive man's complete immersion in his subject. It is never dull; and it sends you back to the plays. That can't be bad, can it?"
