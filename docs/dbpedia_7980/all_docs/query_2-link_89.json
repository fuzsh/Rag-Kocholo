        "text": "BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE PUBLISHED WRITINGS OF OWEN BARFIELD 1917 - 2011 COMPILED BY JANE W. HIPOLITO Acknowledgments: Owen Barfield was an astonishingly prolific author. His earliest publication appeared in 1917; <strong>the</strong> most recent listing in this <strong>bibliography</strong> is 2011. Barfield wrote on a wide variety <strong>of</strong> topics in very diverse venues, several <strong>of</strong> which do not appear in any publication indexes, databases, or o<strong>the</strong>r bibliographic resources. Accordingly, discovering what <strong>the</strong> <strong>published</strong> <strong>writings</strong> <strong>of</strong> Owen Barfield are, as well as tracking down and confirming <strong>the</strong> publication details, has been a complex process lasting more than a quarter <strong>of</strong> a century, throughout which I have needed and received much help. There are many people to thank for <strong>the</strong> 2011 Barfield Bibliography. G. B. Tennyson warmly invited me to undertake this project in 1980. Many <strong>of</strong> Barfield’s <strong>published</strong> <strong>writings</strong> are listed in <strong>the</strong> pioneering <strong>bibliography</strong> which Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Tennyson compiled for <strong>the</strong> 1976 Festschrift in Barfield’s honor, Evolution <strong>of</strong> Consciousness: Studies in Polarity. I am deeply grateful for Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Tennyson’s trust in me, and for his 1976 <strong>bibliography</strong>, which has been a major resource for Barfieldian studies. Owen Barfield immediately supported Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Tennyson’s invitation and provided substantial help, opening up his own files and personally introducing me to <strong>the</strong> staff <strong>of</strong> Rudolf Steiner House in London, which holds copies <strong>of</strong> numerous hard-to-find Barfield publications. From <strong>the</strong> outset, Thomas Kranidas also has been inexhaustibly helpful and encouraging; I am much indebted to Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Kranidas for his astute advice and generosity, especially concerning Barfield’s little-known imaginative <strong>writings</strong>. A great many librarians contributed to <strong>the</strong> compiling <strong>of</strong> this <strong>bibliography</strong>. Indeed, it could not have been completed without <strong>the</strong>ir expert assistance. In <strong>the</strong> 1980s, Nancy Hunter Caudill, Interlibrary Loan Librarian <strong>of</strong> California State University, Fullerton, resourcefully obtained photocopies for me <strong>of</strong> several <strong>of</strong> Owen Barfield’s most obscure publications, including almost all <strong>of</strong> his contributions to <strong>the</strong> long-defunct English periodical Truth. More recently, four <strong>of</strong> Ms. Caudill’s colleagues in California State University, Fullerton’s Pollak Library – Sharon Perry (Special Collections) and Stacy Caron, Kerry Hallas, and Jennifer Otte (Interlibrary Loans), have provided much essential information for this <strong>bibliography</strong>, with <strong>the</strong> cheerful, capable support <strong>of</strong> six student assistants in <strong>the</strong> Interlibrary Loan Department: Susie Avalos, Babeeta Dhillon, Krishma Dhillon, Hazel Gonzalez, Patricia Guerrero, and Christina Martinez. Beginning in <strong>the</strong> 1980s, <strong>the</strong> librarians <strong>of</strong> Rudolf Steiner House in London have given indispensable help; special thanks are due to Margaret Jonas and David MacGregor for <strong>the</strong>ir unfailingly calm, prompt efficiency. I am also grateful to Judith Kiely, Fred Paddock, and Judith Soleil <strong>of</strong> Rudolf Steiner Library in Ghent, New York, who have worked patiently, knowledgeably, and with consistent good will over <strong>the</strong> past several years to enable me to solve several particularly complex, intractable bibliographic mysteries involving publication details <strong>of</strong> Barfield’s anthroposophical <strong>writings</strong>.
