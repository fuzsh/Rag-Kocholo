        "text": "The philosophical treatise on aesthetics and language that inspired T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis, and many others.\n\nIn Poetic Diction, Owen Barfield sought to understand why certain groups of words were given the designation of “poetry,” and how they convey meaning and pleasure to the attentive reader. Touching on the philosophy of language and the nature of consciousness, Barfield provides not only a theory of poetic diction, but also a speculation on poetry and knowledge. Ranging across fundamental topics of poetics, Barfield sheds light on the nature of metaphor, aesthetic imagination, the difference between verse and prose, and the essence of meaning itself."
