        "text": "C.S. Lewis was a consummate letter writer: even with arthritic pains in his hands and fingers, he never stopped writing. His brother Warnie helped him by often typing out answers to correspondents for him. However, it was Lewis himself who felt obligated to those who consulted him about his books and to provide an answer or comment.\n\nThis section includes letters by Lewis to individuals and imaginary people, as well as collections of letters written to Lewis by his many correspondents.\n\nThe Screwtape letters. London: Geoffrey Bles. Illustrated, with a study guide. Prepared by Walter Hooper and Owen Barfield. Lord and King Associates, Inc. Distributed by Fleming H. Revell Company 1976. Published in 1961 as The Screwtape letters & Screwtape proposes a toast, with a new Preface by the author. Macmillan Company.\n\nRevised edition contains the C.S.Lewis Preface of 1960, Screwtape Proposes a Toast, and the never-before-published Lewis Preface to the Toast.\n\nProbably the best known of Lewis’s books (apart from the Narnia series), it is a series of 31 letters written and published weekly in the Guardian. The story’s principal actor is a senior devil (Screwtape) who gives instructions to a junior devil (Wormwood) on how to best tempt a particular man (and people in general). God is referred to as “The Enemy.”\n\nThe edition I have was published in 1942 and dedicated to J.R.R. Tolkien. As part of his rationale for this type of genre, Lewis quotes Luther, who said: “The best way to drive out the devil, if he will not yield to texts of Scripture, is to jeer and flout him, for he cannot bear scorn.”\n\nMere Christianity. NY: The Macmillan Company. See also: 1955.\n\nAppendix A includes some of the letters that Lewis wrote in response to listeners’ questions. Lewis explains that he is not trying to convert anyone with his talks, nor is he focusing on any particular denomination and “the book, however faulty in other respects, did at least succeed in presenting an agreed, or common, or central, or ‘mere’ Christianity” (Preface, xl).\n\nA grief observed. [N. W. Clerk, pen name] London: Faber & Faber.\n\nA very intimate account of Lewis’s journey of grief after his wife died. He comments “Where is she now? That is, in what place is she at the present time. But if H. is not a body—and the body I loved is certainly no longer she—she is no place at all” (21). “If the dead are not in time, or not in our sort of time, is there any clear difference, when we speak of them, between was and is and will be?” (22) “Unless, of course, you can literally believe all that stuff about family reunions ‘on the further shore’, pictured in entirely earthly terms. But that is all unscriptural, all out of bad hymns and lithographs. There’s not a word of it in the Bible. And it rings false. We know it couldn’t be like that. Reality never repeats” (23). “Probably half the questions we ask—half our great theological and metaphysical problems—are like that [nonsense]” (55). “There is also, whatever it means, the resurrection of the body. We cannot understand. The best is perhaps what we understand least” (59).\n\nLetters to Malcolm: chiefly on prayer. NY: Harcourt, Brace & World; 1964 by Geoffrey Bles. Fontana Books 1966; Fount Paperbacks 1977.\n\nThere are 21 letters to “Malcolm” that begin with the subject of private (not corporate) prayer. Lewis reminds us that the charge to Peter was to feed His sheep, not to experiment with rats or teach dogs new tricks (5). He suggests that prayers without words are best (11) and that the relationship between us and God should be private and intimate (13). Although he allows for the possibility of prayers for the dead he sees it as a “great danger” (15) and also that the place or position we pray in is not the issue as much as praying with discipline. Lead us not into temptation is a petition to make our paths straight and that we be spared, when possible, from crises (28). Some things we don’t pray about: “We don’t pray about eclipses” (38). “In every Church, in every institution, there is something which sooner or later works against the very purpose for which it came into existence” (43). Lewis often makes the point in his writings that “God and His acts are not in time. Intercourse between God and man occurs at particular movements for the man, but not for God” (48). He concludes that the images we have are more important and more to be trusted than theological abstractions because the latter is “itself a tissue of analogies: a continual modelling of spiritual reality in legal or chemical or mechanical terms” (52). “There is always hope if we keep an unsolved problem fairly in view; there’s none if we pretend it’s not there” (59). God listens to our prayers and takes them into account (61) even if he does not answer them like we wish. He points out that the increased number of people that we need to pray for is one of the burdens of old age! (66) “The true Christian’s nostril is to be continually attentive to the inner cesspool” (98). “Our emotional reactions to our own behaviour are of limited ethical significance” (99). See (108) for comment on purgatory. “If we were perfected, prayer would not be a duty, it would be a delight. Some day, please God, it will be” (114). “I must say my prayers today whether I feel devout or not; but that is only as I must learn my grammar if I am ever to read the poets” (115). There are many rich moments in prayer to God but “It is no good angling for rich moments. God sometimes seems to speak to us most intimately when he catches us, as it were, off our guard” (116).\n\nLetters to an American lady. Edited by Clyde S. Kilby . Grand Rapids: Eerdmans.\n\nPreface by Kilby . “These letters accentuate rather than change the character of Lewis as it is generally known. In them are his antipathy to journalism, advertising, snobbery, psychoanalysis, to the false and the patent, to wheels and stir and ‘administration’ and the multitude of petty or insidious practices that sap personal and national freedom. And we must not fail to add his antipathy to letter-writing….Yet here we have enough letters to fill a book written to one person in a far country whom he never expected to meet in this world. Although this is one of the longest of Lewis’s correspondences, it is not the only one running to a hundred or more letters….The obvious thrust of these letters is spiritual encouragement and guidance and it is chiefly here that they have their value” (6,7).\n\nLewis never met the woman or expected to, but his letters run to over 100 and he could have found reasons “to justify pitching his mail into the wastepaper basket” (6). Nevertheless, Lewis regarded it important to offer some encouragement and guidance to the woman. And, fittingly, “Because both Lewis and his correspondent had in common a mélange of physical troubles, we learn more here than anywhere else of his increasingly numerous maladies that were finally to join hands in his decease” (8).\n\nThey stand together: The letters of C.S.

Indeed, when I suggested that they would almost certainly clear up some of the ‘problems’ he saw in the Lewis-Moore friendship he made it clear that he did not wish to read the letters, much less hear them discussed. But, oddly, he had no objection whatever to my editing them for publication” (21).\n\nThe collected letters of C.S. Lewis: Family letters. 1905-1931. Volume 1. Edited by Walter Hooper. HarperSanFrancisco.\n\n“One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, C.S.

Lewis’s letters, we witness the formation of both a world-class scholar and a world-changing popular writer. Lewis was not only a great author but also an extraordinary correspondent and in his lifetime wrote thousands of letters to family and friends. This carefully selected and arranged collection, the most extensive ever published, brings together the best of these.” (From the back cover)\n\nThe collected letters of C.S.

Yours, Jack features the best inspirational readings and sage counsel culled from C.S. Lewis’s letters, offering an accessible look at this great author’s personal vision for the spiritual life. This thematic selection from his letters offers the freshest presentation of Lewis’s writing since his death in 1963. Yours, Jack will showcase Lewis’s remarkable teachings and vision for a new generation.” (From the dust jacket)\n\nBleakley, David. 1998. C.S. Lewis at Home in Ireland: A Centenary Biography. Bangor, Northern Ireland: Standtown Press.\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of Lewis’s death David Bleakley, who was born and lived close to the Lewis family in Strandtown, Belfast, Ireland, put together a book that shows us Lewis growing up and interacting with his community. Lewis’s Irish identity is the focus of the book, with pictures and stories of the Lewis extended family. There are letters and comments by his Oxford and Cambridge teachers and friends, by monastic acquaintances and, especially, from the voices of his hometown. Children also write about the influence the Narnian books, in particular, have had on them. There is even a letter by evangelist Billy Graham, who had met and knew Lewis personally.\n\nBloom, Harold, ed. 2006. C.S. Lewis. Bloom’s Modern Critical Views. NY: Infobase Publishing.\n\nBloom states that “C.S. Lewis was the most dogmatic and aggressive person I have ever met” (1). He met Lewis at Cambridge and classifies Lewis as “a Christian polemicist and I an eccentric Gnostic Jew, devoted to William Blake” (1). With this statement Bloom proved himself to be quite dogmatic and aggressive.\n\nEach chapter is written by an author who is thoroughly acquainted with Lewis’s works and many provide personal insights into Lewis’s character and values.

Lewis: The first is to Corbin Carnell, April 4, 1953, in which he comments on questions about the historicity of certain Bible stories, such as on Jonah and calling it a miracle. In the second letter (May 7, 1959) he writes to Clyde S. Kilby on the divine authority of Scripture. Lewis believes “the over-all operation of Scripture is to convey God’s Word to the reader (he also needs his inspiration) who reads it in the right spirit, I fully believe” (99).\n\nCollins, Owen, Compiler. 2000.

Lewis letters to children. NY: Macmillan Publishing Co.\n\nContents: Foreword. Introduction. 1) C.S. Lewis: His Childhood; 2) A Note to Children; 3) The Letters. Bibliography.\n\nIn this volume Lewis answers the letters of children who have contacted him with questions about the various Narnia books. The editors note that Lewis’s letters to children are “too large [to collect all of them] and the author frequently repeated himself. What we have is a representative sample” (7). Although many of the letters are to unidentified individuals, an exception is those to Sarah, his godchild. In those cases he signs the letters as “your affectionate godfather, C.S. Lewis.” He often includes little sketches as well. Another exception was “Joan,” who received 28 letters from Lewis over a period of almost 20 years. In one of the letters to Joan (63-64) Lewis gives her practical advice on writing, e.g., “Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean ‘More people died’ don’t say ‘mortality rose’” (64).\n\nLewis would often comment on and recommend books to his admirers and was always courteous and forthright about his feelings on his Narnia books. For example, he told “Michael” not to look forward too much to The Silver Chair or “you are sure to be disappointed” (31).\n\nDorsett, Lyle W., ed. 1988. The essential C.S. Lewis. NY: Collier Books.

Westport, CT: Praeger.\n\nChapter 2, “The Letters of C.S. Lewis C.S. Lewis as Correspondent” (19-47) by Michael Travers. Letters by Lewis begin as early as November 1905 and continue until a few weeks before he died in September 1963. The letters of Lewis between 1914 and 1920 are mainly to his father, but also to his life-long friend, Arthur Greeves. This period includes his time in the war, his wounds and subsequent return to Oxford. The next period is from his conversion in 1931 until the his last weeks in 1963. Edwards writes that “The striking impression of Lewis’s mature letters is one of a humble, quiet man who loves a tranquil life, and on e who genuinely cares about the people to whom he writes” (25). Lewis’s audiences included family, friends, former students, and with people seeking advice. In addition to Greeves , his brother and father, he wrote regularly to Owen Barfield and Sister Penelope.\n\nEdwards, Earl. 2013. C.S. Lewis: 100 amazing facts, letters and last will.

Out of my bone: The letters of Joy Davidman. Grand Rapids: Eerdmans.\n\n“Although best known as the wife of C. S. Lewis, Joy Davidman was an accomplished writer in her own right, with several published works to her credit. Out of My Bone tells Davidman’s life story in her own words through her numerous letters — most never published before — and her autobiographical essay “The Longest Way Round.” / Gathered and expertly introduced by Don W. King, these letters reveal Davidman’s persistent search for truth, her curious, incisive mind, and her arresting, sharply penetrating voice. They chronicle her religious, philosophical, and intellectual journey from secular Judaism to atheism to Communism to Christianity. Her personal engagement with large issues offers key insights into the historical milieu of America in the 1930s and 1940s. Davidman also writes about the struggles of her earlier marriage to William Lindsay Gresham and of trying to reconcile her career goals with her life as mother of two sons. Most poignantly, perhaps, these letters expose Davidman’s mental, emotional, and spiritual state as she confronted the cancer that eventually took her life in 1960 at age 45. / Moving and riveting, Out of My Bone reveals anew the singular woman whom Lewis deeply loved and who influenced his later writings, especially Till We Have Faces.” (From Amazon)\n\nKing, Don W. 2013.

An avid outdoorsman, Lewis deftly combined an active imagination with a deep appreciation for the natural world. Narnia and the Fields of Arbol, the first book-length work on the subject, explores the marriage of Lewis’s environmental passion with his skill as a novelist and finds the author’s legacy to have as much in common with the agrarian environmentalism of Wendell Berry as it does with the fantasy of J. R. R. Tolkien. In an era of increasing concern about deforestation, climate change, and other environmental issues, Lewis’s work remains as pertinent as ever.” (From Amazon)\n\nPeters, John. 1985.

Vanauken came to see his wife’s (Davy) death as a “severe mercy.” He saw Lewis a fortnight before Lewis’s death and they made tea “in the Kilns and talked about prayer and books” (229). “The disappearance of the grief is not followed by happiness. It is followed by emptiness” (231). But Vanauken found a foretaste of eternity in Davy’s dying.\n\nVaus, Will. 2010. The hidden story of Narnia: A book-by -book guide to C.S. Lewis’ spiritual themes. Cheshire, CT: Winged Lion Press.\n\n“In a number of Lewis’ letters he comments on how children almost always recognize who Aslan is, whereas grown-ups seldom do.”\n\nWhite, William Luther. 1969.
