Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks are marking their 35th wedding anniversary with cake â€” and a sweet Instagram moment.

On Sunday Wilson took to Instagram to share a new photo of herself and her Oscar-winning husband, who can be seen presenting her with a decadent buttercream-frosted cake reading "Happy Anniversary." As the singer and Now and Then actress notes in her caption, the couple were married on April 30, 1988.

"35 years of marriage. April 30, 1988. Love is everything," she captioned the photo.

Wilson is Hanks's second wife. He was previously married to the late actress Samantha Lewes, with whom he shared daughter Elizabeth and actor Colin Hanks. After starring opposite Wilson in the 1985 comedy Volunteers, the star converted to her Greek Orthodox faith. The actors, both 66, have two sons: actor and musician Chet, and Truman, who made his film debut last year by playing the younger version of his father's character in A Man Called Otto.
