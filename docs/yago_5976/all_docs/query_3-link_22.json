        "text": "Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson have a romance spanning 40 years after falling in love on the silver screen, but Wilson caught the Oscar-winner's eye years before they even met.\n\nThe couple first shared the screen in 1981, when Wilson guest starred on the sitcom Bosom Buddies with Hanks, but she had first caught his attention almost a decade earlier.\n\nBorn Margarita Ibrahimoff, the actress got her first role when she was a teenager as Pat Conway in the 1972 Brady Bunch episode 'Greg's Triangle', which Hanks later saw on TV.\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Hanks skips Asteroid City photo call after Cannes red carpet 'incident'\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Hanks' wife Rita Wilson speaks out about red carpet 'altercation' at Cannes Film Festival\n\n\"I was watching on a Friday night. This cheerleader was so cute, she knocked me out,\" he told ET of spotting his future wife on the show when he was just 16.\n\nAn aspiring actor himself, Hanks got his start in the 1980s and quickly made a name for himself, starring in box office hits like Splash in 1984.\n\nHe was married to his college sweetheart, actress Samantha Lewes, at the time. The pair had tied the knot in 1978, before Hanks' acting career took off.\n\nThey shared a son, Colin, born in 1977, and a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1982, but the marriage didn't last and Hanks struggled with that, having seen his own parents divorce.\n\n\"A broken marriage meant I was sentencing my own kids to the sort of feelings I had at their age. I was just too young and insecure for marriage,\" Hanks said of his first marriage in 2013.\n\n\"I was 23 and my son Colin was already two when I married for the first time. I was not really ready to take on those responsibilities.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Elvis courted Priscilla Presley for years, but parenthood changed them\n\nWhen Wilson walked onto the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981, Hanks felt a connection instantly but they kept things strictly platonic as he was still very much a married man.\n\n\"We just got along instantly,\" Wilson told Kelly Clarkson in 2020 of their first meeting.\n\n\"He makes me laugh all the time. He's a great storyteller.\"\n\nWhen she and Hanks shared the screen again in the 1985 film Volunteers, the chemistry between them was undeniable and romance blossomed soon after.\n\n\"Wilson and I just looked at each other and – kaboing – that was that. I asked Wilson if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied,\" Hanks told GQ of the spark between them.\n\nIt's understood he and Lewes separated around that time, as Hanks asked Wilson out not long after and they later took their relationship public in 1986.\n\nHanks's divorce from Lewes was finalised the following year and in 1988 he and Wilson tied the knot, the actress donning a unique short wedding dress for the occasion.\n\n\"I'm a lucky man,\" Hanks joked to E! News in 2016, \"she could've done better.\"\n\nBut Wilson knew she'd found 'The One', once recalling a special moment between them while waiting for a traffic light to change on a corner in New York City.\n\nREAD MORE: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr fell in love over a crab\n\n\"He looked at me and he said, 'You know, I just want you to know, that you never have to change anything about who you are in order to be with me',\" she said in 2012.\n\n\"Literally, a wave of– if love is a feeling, or a cellular thing that happens to your body, it went through me, and that's pretty much who he is, and how he's been.\"\n\nHaving been through the heartache of one failed marriage already, Hanks was adamant things would be better with Wilson and knew that would \"require some change\" from him.\n\n\"No matter what, we'll be with each other – and we'll get through it.\"\n\n\"I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic, the way it's shown in movies,\" he once told Oprah Winfrey of their union.\n\n\"In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes, but we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each other and we'll get through it.\"\n\nHank and Wilson became a Hollywood golden couple and remained together even as his star rose, becoming one of the most popular leading men of the 1990s.\n\nThe pair welcomed their first child together, a son named Chester, in 1990 and shared the big screen again in 1993 when they starred as siblings in Sleepless in Seattle.\n\nTheir second son, Truman, arrived in 1995, after Hanks won two consecutive Oscars for Best Actor for Philadelphia in 1993 and Forrest Gump in 1994.\n\nThe actor credited his wife for those achievements, telling Oprah Winfrey in 2001 that his performances wouldn't have been the same without Wilson by his side.\n\nWATCH: The trailer for Hanks' 1995 classic Forrest Gump\n\n\"I was able to construct a number of things in Philadelphia because of my relationship with her. The way my character felt about his lover is the way I feel about mine,\" he said.\n\n\"The same was true when I played Forrest Gump, who loved Jenny. Without my connection with Rita, I don't know how I would've been able to connect with what Forrest was going through.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Olivia Newton-John didn't find the 'love of her life' until she was 59\n\nIn the decade that followed, the husband and wife duo continued acting and Wilson made her Broadway debut, but in 2015 tragedy struck and she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nWilson, then in her late 50s, subsequently underwent a double mastectomy and reconstruction and managed to beat the disease, all with Hanks at her side.\n\n\"You never know how your spouse is going to react in a situation like this,\" she told the New York Times after her diagnosis.\n\n\"I was so amazed, so blown away by the care my husband gave me ... who knew it would make you even closer?\"\n\nA few years later the couple celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary with a blow-out party stacked with A-list guests including Oprah, Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and more.\n\nAfter three decades together, the couple only seemed to grow more in love and stuck by each other when they became two of the first big-name stars to test positive for COVID-19.\n\nWhen they revealed they'd contracted the virus at the start of the pandemic in 2020, there was a wave of panic and fears for their health, but they made it through together.\n\n\"I think that having the virus at the same time made it that little bit easier,\" Wilson told The Guardian after the worst of it.\n\n\"We were taking care of each other instead of having the pressure of taking care of one person and no one taking care of you, or understanding that the person at home needs a break.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Jamie Lee Curtis found her husband in a copy of Rolling Stone magazine\n\nNow the pair are grandparents and split their time between awards shows, red carpet events and time spent with their blended family, including Hanks' children from his first marriage.\n\nAs for their secret to such a long and successful union, Hanks is keeping that under wraps for now.\n\n\"There is a secret, and we bottled it,\" he joked to Fox News Digital once.\n\n\"We'll sell it to you individually, for $17 billion.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here"
