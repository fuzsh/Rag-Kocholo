        "text": "Tom Hanks has long been one of Hollywood’s most beloved stars. The actor has won two Academy Awards for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. More recently, he’s developed a reputation as “America’s dad.” Hanks has fans across the globe but none like his wife, actor Rita Wilson. However, have Hanks and Wilson ever appeared in a movie together? Here’s the answer.\n\nThe actor married Rita Wilson the same year ‘Big’ was released\n\nHanks and Wilson married in 1988, just as the actor’s star was on the rise. That very same year, Hanks starred in Big, the fantasy-comedy that earned the actor his first Oscar nomination. The movie also cemented Hanks as a major comedy star, paving the way for his dramatic turn in the early and mid-1990s. But Wilson wasn’t Hanks’ first wife.\n\nA decade before tying the knot with his current bride, Hanks wed Samantha Lewes. An actor herself, Lewes even appeared on her husband’s TV sitcom, Bosom Buddies, in 1981. When their marriage began, both Hanks and Lewes were struggling actors. But by the time their romance ended, Hanks was well on his way to becoming a Hollywood mega-star.\n\nHas Rita Wilson appeared in any Tom Hanks movies?\n\nSince both Hanks and Wilson are actors, fans might naturally wonder if the couple has appeared on screen together. In fact, this is exactly how they met. Like Lewes, Wilson appeared on Bosom Buddies in 1981. And years later, Hanks and Wilson co-starred as love interests in the 1985 comedy Volunteers, co-starring the late John Candy.\n\nHowever, that project was just the beginning of their on-screen collaborations. In fact, Hanks and Wilson have actually shared the screen more often than Hanks and his most famous co-star, Meg Ryan. Over the years, Wilson has appeared in several Hanks movies. These include early 1990s releases such as The Bonfire of the Vanities and Sleepless in Seattle.\n\nIn the latter, Wilson even played the sister of Hanks’ character. She also appeared in two movies Hanks directed: 1996’s That Thing You Do! and 2011’s Larry Crowne. Most recently, Hanks and Wilson have cameos as themselves in the Oscar-nominated movie Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson have two sons, including Chet Hanks\n\nFor more than 30 years, Hanks and Wilson have been going strong. And their marriage has been prolific in many regards. Through their production company Playtone, the couple has produced more than 20 movies since 2000. Many of these include Hanks’ movies, including his 2020 releases Greyhound and News of the World. But they also notably produced the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films."
