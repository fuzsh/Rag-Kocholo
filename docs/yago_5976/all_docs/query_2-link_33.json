        "text": "Entertainment gossip and news from Newsweek's network of contributors\n\nTom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson, a duo that has navigated Hollywood's spotlight since their marriage in 1988, continue to be one of the industry's most admired couples.\n\nHaving first crossed paths on the set of Hanks' sitcom Bosom Buddies, their journey together has been nothing short of a Hollywood love story. When asked about the key to their lasting relationship, the Forrest Gump actor had a straightforward yet heartfelt response for E! News: \"Finding each other! How about that,\" he said, with a characteristic smile.\n\nThe pair share two children together, Chet, 33, and Truman, 28. Hanks also has two children, Colin, 46, and Elizabeth, 41, from his first marriage to Samantha Lewes.\n\nThe couple recently took on the role of honorary chairs at \"An Unforgettable Evening,\" an event in support of the Women's Cancer Research Fund. The cause holds significant importance for them, particularly for Wilson, 67, who underwent a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015.\n\nIn the interview, Wilson emphasized the collective effort required in supporting cancer research. \"It takes a village,\" she shared, acknowledging the Los Angeles community's 25-year commitment to the cause. \"We don't do it alone.\"\n\nHanks attributes much of their ability to support such causes to his wife's influence. \"Periodically this lady sits me down,\" the Oscar winning actor explained, \"and we pull out the books. We look at the year. We ponder the work that's gotta get done.\" For Hanks, 67, planning and execution are skills he honed through his life with his partner. \"Making a plan and following through with the plan is a skill that I did not have until I met Rita Wilson,\" he reflected, underscoring the profound impact of their partnership."
