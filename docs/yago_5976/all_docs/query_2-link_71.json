        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are celebrating 34 wonderful years of marriage today — and what a ride it's been.\n\nFrom first landing eyes on each other as teenagers to battling cancer and COVID-19, Hollywood's golden couple have had their share of highs and lows. So this anniversary will mean that much more this year.\n\nLet's take a look back at their love story.\n\n1972: A 16-year-old Wilson makes her acting debut on the beloved sitcom The Brady Bunch, playing a cheerleader named Pat Conway. Hanks, who is also 16 at the time, is instantly attracted to the actress, as he later reveals at the premiere of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 in 2016.\n\n\"I was actually at a friend of mine's house when it aired and I remember thinking 'that girl's cute,'\" Hanks recalls to People magazine on the red carpet.\n\n1981: The couple finally meet on the set of Hanks' show Bosom Buddies, a short-lived sitcom about two single men who disguise themselves as women to live in the only apartment they can afford.\n\nWilson makes a guest appearance on the show, but at the time Hanks is still married to his college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes.\n\n1984: Hanks and Wilson cross paths again in the movie Volunteers, and their chemistry is undeniable.\n\n\"You could tell they were fond of each other,\" their co-star Xander Berkeley later tells People.\n\nHanks also later reveals to GQ, \"Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing —that was that... I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied.\"\n\nBut the pair don't act on their chemistry as Hanks is still married to Lewes. They separate in 1985 after having two children together, actor Colin Hanks, now 42, and 37-year-old Elizabeth Ann.\n\nLewes later dies from bone cancer in 2002.\n\n1986: A newly separated Hanks debuts his relationship with Wilson at the premiere of his movie, Nothing in Common.\n\n\"I was just too young and insecure for marriage,\" Hanks tells the UK Express of his failed marriage to Lewes. \"I was 23 and my son Colin was already two when I married for the first time. I was not really ready to take on those responsibilities.\"\n\nHanks and Lewes finalise their divorce in 1987.\n\n1988: Hanks and Wilson get married, with Wilson famously wearing a short cocktail wedding dress with tulle details.\n\n\"When we first looked at each other there was definitely a kind of, 'Hey, this is the place!' I felt that anyway... I think the end result is that we got married for all the right reasons,\" he later tells Entertainment Tonight.\n\nMarch 1989: The newlyweds attend their first Oscars ceremony together, where Hanks is nominated for his role in the comedy, Big. He didn't win, but weeks earlier he did win a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical — and he thanks Wilson in his speech.\n\n\"I married a Greek babe,\" he says in his speech. \"She was born right here in California, right here in Hollywood, but her folks are great, she's marvellous, Rita Wilson — thank you, babe, for marrying me. You made my year already.\"\n\n1990: Hanks and Wilson welcome their first child on August 4, 1990, a son they name Chester 'Chet' Marlon Hanks. Chet, now 29, has followed in his parents acting footsteps, starring in shows such as Empire and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\n1993: Husband and wife appear in the classic rom-com Sleepless in Seattle, a film written and directed by Nora Ephron.\n\nHanks and Wilson don't play love interests in the movie, instead they are brother and sister.\n\n1994: Hanks wins his first Oscar, taking home Best Actor for his role in the drama, Philadelphia.\n\n\"I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about by, not Bruce Springsteen, but Neil Young. And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth,\" he says of Wilson during his acceptance speech.\n\nMarch 1995: The actor wins back-to-back Oscars, once again taking home the Best Actor gong at the prestigious event. This time, his wins for his performance in Forrest Gump. Again, he thanks Wilson in his acceptance speech.\n\n\"I am standing here because the woman I share my life with has taught me and demonstrates for me every day just what love is,\" he tells the crowd.\n\nDecember, 1995: Hanks and Wilson welcome their second son, Truman Hanks, who is born December 26. Unlike his parents and older brothers, Truman prefers to stay out of the limelight.\n\n2002: The couple produce their first project together, signing on as executive producers on the hit movie, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and later its 2016 sequel, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2. They will later work together again as co-producers on the movie musical Mamma Mia! and its sequel.\n\n2015: Wilson takes medical leave of absence from her Broadway gig, Fish in the Dark, The actress soon reveals she has breast cancer.\n\n\"Last week, with my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,\" she tells People in a statement.\n\n\"I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.\"\n\nThankfully she kicks the disease with treatment and thanks Hanks for being her rock throughout the entire ordeal.\n\n\"Four years ago when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I had so many different thoughts. You're scared, anxious, you think about your own mortality,\" she tweets in 2019, before joking, \"So I had a serious discussion with my husband that if anything happens, I wanted him to be super sad for a very long time.\"\n\n2018: The couple celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with two very special surprise guests: cardboard cut-outs of themselves.\n\nHanks takes to Instagram to share a sweet message for his wife.\n\n\"30 years on April 30. '88 To '18. Magic numbers. Hanx and @RitaWilson,\" he writes.\n\nJanuary, 2020: The actor tears up while thanking his family during an acceptance speech after being honoured with the Cecil B. DeMille at the Golden Globes.\n\n\"[I have] a wife who is fantastic in every way, who has taught me what love is. Five kids who are braver and stronger and wiser than their old man is,\" Hanks tells the audience of his wife, four children and daughter-in-law Samantha Bryant, Colin's wife. \"I can't tell you how much your love means to me.\"\n\nMarch, 2020: Hanks and Wilson travel to Australia for work — he is due to start filming the Elvis Presley biopic, while Wilson is Down Under to promote her nee album, Halfway To Home. But the couple end up in quarantine in a Gold Coast hospital as they test positive to coronavirus.\n\n\"Many, many thanks to everyone in Australia who looked after us,\" the actor later tweets after they return home to LA after beating the virus. \"Their care and guidance made possible our return to the USA. And many thanks to all of you who reached out with well wishes. Rita and I so appreciate it.\"\n\nApril 30, 2020: The couple celebrate their 32nd wedding anniversary — and a source tells Entertainment Tonight that it will be one special once given their recent health battle.\n\n\"This year, experiencing COVID-19 together was life-changing,\" the source says. \"They had to ride the wave of an illness that could have killed one or both of them. Being apart from their children during the experience made them reflect on everything they have in life, especially each other. It has made them truly appreciate their love for one another and the life they have built.\"\n\nJuly 10, 2020: Rita Wilson celebrates Tom Hanks' 64th birthday with a touching tribute to her partner of 32 years.\n\n\"Happy Birthday, @tomhanks. We love you so much,\" Wilson writes. \"You are our anchor. Every day with you is a blessing.\"\n\nThe actress also shared lyrics from the 1967 Beetles love song 'When I'm Sixty Four'.\n\n\"Give me your answer, fill in a form / Mine for evermore / Will you still need me, will you still feed me / When I'm sixty-four?', to which she answered 'YES\".\n\nJuly 27, 2020: The couple officially become Greek citizens!\n\nIn a picture posted on social media by the country's Prime Minister, the two proudly hold up their brand new passports.\n\nApril 30, 2022: Rita Wilson celebrated the couple's 34th wedding anniversary with a sweet throwback photo from their wedding day in 1988.\n\n\"34th. 1988-2022. 💕☦️💕\" her caption simply reads.\n\nFans and friends were quick to label Rita and Tom as #couplegoals in the comment section as the pair marked the milestone event."
