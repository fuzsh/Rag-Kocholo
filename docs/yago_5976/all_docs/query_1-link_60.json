        "text": "On Instagram, she posted, \"\"I am elated to have had the talented @leslieodomjr join me on \"Massachusetts,\" a reimagined version of the @beegees classic.\" Wilson went on to write, \"I've always envisioned this song as a musical odyssey, a return to love, and invite you to give it a listen now via the link in my bio!\"\n\nWilson’s website describes her duet album is “a collection of classic, timeless songs from the Seventies, arranged as duets featuring Rita's crystalline vocals alongside some of the greatest male singers of our time.” The album is set to be released on on September 27.\n\nThe Hollywood star has been married to Oscar winner Tom Hanks, 66, since 1988, and has two adult children and a granddaughter.\n\nTheir son, Chet, also known as “Chet Haze,” is an actor and rapper who recently turned 32, and has described himself as the “black sheep” of the otherwise wholesome Hanks family.\n\nWilson recently wished her son a happy birthday on Instagram, writing, “…you seek truth, you make us laugh, make Larry David laugh and share a birthday with @barackobama you are and always have been special. You have brought so much joy to our family. We love you so much!!!”.\n\nRita Wilson’s Breast Cancer Journey\n\nWilson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015.\n\nShe underwent a mastectomy, followed by reconstructive surgery, to treat her cancer. The actress and singer's specific diagnosis was invasive lobular carcinoma.\n\nRelated: When Should You Consider a Mastectomy?\n\nThis type of breast cancer is named for its point of origin: the lobules.\n\nInvasive lobular carcinoma begins in the milk-producing glands, called lobules, of the breast, and may spread to other areas of the body.\n\nInvasive lobular carcinoma only represents a small portion of breast cancers. The most common type of breast cancer starts in the breast ducts.\n\nTreatment options for breast cancer include surgery (via a mastectomy or lumpectomy), chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\n\nRelated: When You're Called Back After a Mammogram: Breaking Down the Numbers\n\nSome people also get preventative mastectomies if there's a history of breast cancer in the family and thus an elevated risk of developing the disease.\n\nWhen Should You Consider a Mastectomy?\n\nHow to Screen for Breast Cancer\n\nBreast cancer is typically detected via a mammogram, the screening method for this type of cancer.\n\nMammograms look for lumps in the breast tissue and early signs of breast cancer.\n\nWomen aged 45 to 54 with an average risk of breast cancer (i.e. no family history of the disease) should have mammograms annually.\n\nRelated: Second Opinions on Your Cancer Diagnosis or Treatment: Do You Need One?\n\nDr. Connie Lehman, the chief of the Breast Imaging Division at Massachusetts General Hospital, says in an earlier interview, \"If you haven't gone through menopause yet, I think it's very important that you have a mammogram every year.\"\n\n\"We know that cancers grow more rapidly in our younger patients, and having that annual mammogram can be lifesaving,\" says Dr. Lehman.\n\n\"After menopause, it may be perfectly acceptable to reduce that frequency to every two years. But what I'm most concerned about is the women who haven't been in for a mammogram for two, three, or four years, those women that have never had a mammogram. We all agree regular screening mammography saves lives.\"\n\nWhen Should I Get a Mammogram?\n\nRita Wilson Before And After Breast Cancer\n\nWilson’s other musical credits include a solo album, ‘AM/FM’, which she released on May 8, 2012, followed by her her second album, ‘Rita Wilson’, in 2014. and her third album ‘Bigger Picture’, released in 2018.\n\nWilson also has a fourth album, ‘Halfway to Home’ which debuted in 2019.\n\nShe’s also an accomplished actress, with Broadway credits as well as film appearances.\n\nAmong them, ‘Volunteers’, ‘Sleepless in Seattle’, ‘Now and Then’, ‘That Thing You Do!’, ‘Jingle All the Way’, ‘The Story of Us’, ‘Runaway Bride’, ‘It’s Complicated’, and ‘Larry Crowne’,\n\nWilson also appeared in the television series ‘The Good Wife.’\n\nIn 2020, she bemoaned the impact of COVID-19 on her music.\n\nWith COVID-19 safety restrictions in place, concerts were cancelled in large numbers, music festivals were postponed, and even awards ceremonies went virtual.\n\nIn a previous Instagram post, Wilson wrote candidly, “I'm sure all of us music fans & musicians can agree: it's been a hard, devastating road for our beloved concerts.”"
