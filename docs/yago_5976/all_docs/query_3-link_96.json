Here We Go Again) a decade on.\n\nHer Broadway career began in 2006 with a role as Chicago’s Roxie Hart.\n\nHow did Rita meet Tom?\n\nRita Wilson first met Tom Hanks on the set of ABC’s sitcom Bosom Buddies in 1981, where she appeared for one episode.\n\nTheir friends-to-lovers’ timeline was delayed, despite their “instant” friendship, as Hanks was married to his then-wife, Samantha Lewes.\n\nRead More\n\nWhat the papers say – March 21\n\nSnow leopards arrive at Chester Zoo for first time in 93-year history\n\nMinisters rule out early election as focus shifts to race to succeed Varadkar\n\nSponsored\n\nPast AXA Startup Angel winners share their tips\n\nIn 1985, the friends starred in their first film together, Volunteers, where they finally decided to become an item, Hanks revealed to GQ.\n\nAfter their first joint red-carpet appearance, which has been followed by many more in the three decades since, the couple married in 1988 – with Wilson wearing an iconic tiered mini-wedding dress.\n\nThey have two children (Chester “Chet” Marlon Hanks, 32, and Truman Theodore Hanks, 26), joining the two children from Hanks’s previous marriage (Colin Lewes Hanks, 44, and Elizabeth Ann Hanks, 40).\n\nWhen was Rita Wilson diagnosed with breast cancer?\n\nThe 65-year-old has dealt with breast cancer and a double mastectomy, she revealed in 2015.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph, Wilson said the diagnosis was “world-changing” – but this did not stop her from returning to work only a month after the surgery.\n\nShe said: “Looking back on it, it was exhausting. I did it, but it was basically all I could do – I’d just sleep all day, get up, go do the play, come back, sleep all night.\n\n“But I’m really thankful I finished out the run. If I commit to something, I do it. I’ve never been a quitter. But it was definitely challenging.”\n\nIn 2020, Wilson and Hanks suffered from Covid-19, resulting in hospitalisation.\n\nUpon their return, the couple donated their blood for virus research.\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
