        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are one of few celebrity couples to have withstood the test of time. While the Forrest Gump star and his wife (an accomplished actor and singer in her own right) first started out as friends — they first met on the set of a sitcom in 1981 — their relationship slowly but surely began to blossom into something more. After making their red carpet debut as a couple in 1986, they went on to wed in 1988. Today, the dynamic duo share two children and, like every other couple, have endured ups and downs, most notably Wilson’s breast cancer diagnosis in 2015. Through thick and thin, Wilson and Hanks continue to stand by each other’s side. From their first encounter to the present day, here’s a look back at their relationship.\n\n1981: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson First Meet\n\nHanks and Wilson first crossed paths in 1981, when she was guest-starring on an episode of the TV sitcom, Bosom Buddies,” which Hanks had starred in for two seasons before. However, the duo didn’t start dating right away — he was actually married at the time to his first wife, Samantha Lewes. (The two divorced in 1987.)\n\nDespite this, Wilson later revealed on a 2020 episode of the Kelly Clarkson Show that the two instantly hit it off — as friends. “One of the things, when we met, was that we just got along instantly,\" she said, before continuing, “First of all, I love a good storyteller [...]So anybody who could tell a good story, I'm down with that. ... I love that. He makes me laugh all the time. He's a great storyteller.\"\n\nAugust 16, 1985: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Star in a Movie Together\n\nAbout four years after their first encounter, Hanks and Wilson reunited to star in a feature film together, Volunteers, which premiered on August 16, 1985. In the movie, the two played on-screen lovers. According to Hanks, the sparks started flying (pretty much) instantly, telling GQ that, \"Rita and I just looked at each other and — kaboing — that was that.” Additionally, \"I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied.\"\n\nDecember 1986: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Make Their Red Carpet Debut as a Couple\n\nOver a year after the debut of Volunteers, Hanks and Wilson made their relationship public by posing on the red carpet together at the Three Amigos movie premiere in 1986. One thing to note: While Hanks was technically still married to Lewes at the time, it was reported they were broken up long before he and Wilson coupled up.\n\nOver the next year they attended the Oscars, the U.S. Open, and several other premiers by each other's side.\n\nApril 30, 1988: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson Get Married\n\nOn April 30, 1988, Rita and Wilson made their love official by tying the knot. While there is little information on the proposal itself, Wilson told Access Hollywood in 2005 that when Hanks did propose to her, she didn’t “do the normal, like, 'Of course, darling. I'd love to marry you.'” Instead, she said, “I was like, 'You bet!' I was just like, 'Oh, was that too eager?' It was, like, kind of embarrassing. 'You bet.' So on the inside of my engagement ring, he had engraved 'You bet,'\" she shared.\n\nHanks has also spoken openly about his and Wilson’s marriage. ”The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity and our willingness to have an intimate connection,\" he revealed to Oprah Winfrey. \"When I married Rita, I thought, 'This is going to require some change on my part.' I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic — the way it's shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here.
