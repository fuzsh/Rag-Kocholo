        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are one of Hollywood’s most beloved couples. After 30 years of marriage, their love is rock solid. The two are not only committed to each, but also committed to God. Their belief in the power of prayer is a testament to their unwavering faith.\n\nIn the video below, Hanks and Wilson talk about God and the power of prayer. Wilson shares how she prays every day and how important praying is. She prays individually. She also prays with her husband and her children. Prayer is a foundation in her family’s life.\n\n“God is a part of my life,” Wilson said. “Every single day I prayed to God for I don’t know how many years – that he would bring me somebody that I loved, that loved me in the same way and he brought me Tom. I believe in that.”\n\n“God is mysterious, but God works every day.”\n\n“God is mysterious, but God works every day,” Hanks said.\n\nHanks and Wilson are both strong people of faith. Hanks joined the Greek Orthodox Church when he married Wilson in 1988. The church is really where Hanks’ faith matured.\n\nThe couple has relied on their faith, even during trauma and hardship. In 2015, Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy, and their son Chet Hanks was also battling substance abuse. During this trying period, Hanks was also trying to control his type-2 diabetes and its side effects, in addition to also being hit with a lawsuit as a result of his son’s actions. In spite of all they were going through, the couple leaned on pray and faith to provide them the strength and hope that saw them through. While their faith has been put to the test, they still trusted that God would see them through their darkest valley, and He did.\n\nDespite Hollywood’s endless splits, their marriage has stood the test of time in Hollywood and a lot of this has to do with their faith in God. As Christians, we know that there is power in prayer and with God all things are possible.\n\nPrayer is a powerful tool for communicating with our Heavenly Father. It is an opportunity to become one with the Creator and Giver of all things. Another incredible thing about prayer is that it helps us to find strength for today and hope for our future. We should actively pray and trust in its power to change our circumstances for good. Your faith life directly correlates to the quality of your prayer life. Prayer has the power to change not only the people and things around you. Prayer also has the power to change you from the inside out.\n\nWhen you’re in need of strength, remember that God is the number one healer and can guide you in endless ways. If your heart and life are centered on God, His Word and His Holy Spirit, you can rest assured that He will direct your path.\n\nMany of us are facing impossible situations where we need a breakthrough in our lives. Yet, most of us sit and wait for God to make it happen, and then we wonder why it is that we don’t experience breakthrough as often or as fast as we’d like. What we need to know is that breakthrough is not something we sit around and wait for. Breakthrough is God waiting on us to respond in obedience to what He has already commanded and already promised. Breakthrough happens when we pray vehemently and trust God’s outcome. Breakthrough happens when we say that we are going to trust that God is going to supernaturally do what is impossible. God does the breakthrough, but He’s waiting for us to take that first step of faith. We have to believe in God’s goodness, that God has already willed the breakthrough for our life.\n\nPrayer is a force that touches eternal powers and sets them in motion. It is so powerful that Satan wants to keep you from it because it interferes with his power, disturbs his plans and destroys his kingdom. That means that prayer is a powerful weapon and a dangerous one that can be used against the forces of evil that we face daily.\n\nWhatever you might be going through today, whatever circumstances you’re facing, trust that you can turn to God in prayer. Instead of stressing about your next decision, ask God to lead you and guide you. There is nothing you can pray about that is too big or small for God. Ask God for the wisdom and discernment to teach you how He wants you to pray and for what He wants you to pray for. God has the power to equip you with strength as you face your biggest challenges. You just have to trust Him."
