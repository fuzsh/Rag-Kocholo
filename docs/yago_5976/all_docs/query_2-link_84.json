Hanks was married to his college sweetheart Samantha Lewes at the time, but they finalized their divorce in 1987.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAfter Hanks separated from Lewes, he started dating Wilson, and the couple married in 1988, going on to have two children together, Chet and Truman.\n\nTheir marriage is one of the longest-lasting in Hollywood, as Insider's Talia Lakritz reported.\n\nWilson told The Guardian in 2022 that she and her husband are not the same people that they were when they first met over three decades ago: \"Marriages are multiple relationships, really, between two people who are always changing,\" she said.\n\nHer advice to others who would like to emulate their longstanding relationship?\n\n\"You have to allow each other to evolve and grow; you need communication and curiosity,\" Wilson said. \"Stay interested in your partner, and make sure to really listen.\"\n\nSpeaking to Oprah Winfrey in 2001, Hanks said that the success of their relationship came down to \"a matter of timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection,\" Lakritz reported.\n\n\"When I married Rita, I thought, 'This is going to require some change on my part,'\" he said.\n\n\"I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic — the way it's shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each other — and we'll get through it,\" he added."
