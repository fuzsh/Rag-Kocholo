        "text": "In March of 2020, Rita Wilson and her husband, Tom Hanks, announced theyâd tested positive for COVID-19, making them among the first celebrities to go public with the diagnosis. Their decision to come forward was heroic in its own way, given the fear associated with the virus. The revelation removed some of the stigma surrounding COVID-19, and emboldened other celebrities to reveal their own diagnoses.\n\nOn March 29, shortly after sheâd recovered, Wilson posted an Instagram message in which she wrote, âI am so thankful for my health.â\n\nAs it happened, the date marked another milestone -- 5 years had passed since her medical team declared her breast cancer-free. In the same post, she expressed gratitude for âthe doctors, nurses, friends and family who got me through that time.â\n\nWilson was originally diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), abnormal cells in her breastâs milk-producing glands, called lobules. LCIS isnât cancer, but it increases the risk for invasive breast cancer. The LCIS eventually turned into pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ (PLCIS), a form doctors believe is more likely to turn into cancer than LCIS. After Wilson had lumpectomies (surgery to remove the abnormal tissue), her doctor told her she didnât have cancer, but âI had a gut feeling,â she says.\n\nâSome fraction of patients who are diagnosed with LCIS will eventually go on to develop an actual cancer, either from that original site or somewhere else in the breast,â says V.K. Gadi, MD, PhD, professor and director of Medical Oncology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. (He did not treat Wilson.)\n\nIt turned out Wilson was one of them. When she got a second opinion, she learned that her PLCIS had progressed to invasive lobular carcinoma.\n\nSuddenly, she saw that cancer was no longer a disease that only happened to other people. âOnce you have something happen to you, you realize that youâre just a statistic,â she says. âThereâs nothing that protects you.â\n\nStaying focused on the process of surviving left her little time to dwell on the enormity of having cancer. âOnce I had the permanent implants put in and the surgery went well, then I could start feeling a bit more relaxed,â she says.\n\nMindfulness meditation helped her get through that dark time. She made it a permanent part of her post-cancer lifestyle, along with other healthy habits like swimming, walking, and practicing yoga. She began to eat less red meat, replacing it with more fish and grains. And she cut back on alcohol, which some studies suggest can increase the risk for breast cancer recurrence.\n\nâThese things are now a part of my life. Theyâre not going to change,â she says. âOnce youâve had a health crisis, you donât want to mess around with it.â\n\nâI was having a conversation with my husband, which was about if I should go before him, certain things that Iâd like to have happen. One of them was, âIâd like you to throw me a party. And I want to have all of my friends there,ââ she recalls. âI wanted it to be something that allowed people to celebrate my life.â\n\nShe captured her request in the song, âThrow Me a Party,â featured on her 2019 album, Halfway to Home. One line goes, âI always lived like there wasnât enough time.â Cancer brought a keen awareness that time is a resource in limited supply.\n\nâThe choices that I made after that were that I only wanted to do the things that I really love â¦ and do the work that I feel is really meaningful,â she says.\n\nThe impetus for the question came from an interview with Oprah Winfrey sheâd read in the Los Angeles Times. The multimedia icon attributed her success to her ability to find clarity about her purpose in life. âI ask people what it is they want,â Winfrey said in the article, âand you would be amazed at how few of them know. â¦ If you focus on what you want, things clear up. If you donât, you get stuck in this muddled, fuzzy place.â\n\nWilson had been so caught up with her acting career and family (she has two sons with Hanks), that she hadnât even considered what she wanted. But once she stopped to think about it, the answer was clear.\n\nâIt was music,â she says.\n\nâI feel like people have things inside them that they want, that are yearnings â¦ something that they feel is a true part of who they are. For me that was always music, but I had become an actor at such a young age and that took off, and I never really looked back.â\n\nIn 2012, she released an album of cover songs called AM/FM, but she secretly yearned to be a singer-songwriter. Without the ability to read music or play an instrument fluently, Wilson figured it was out of the question. Then, a chance meeting with producer/songwriter Kara DioGuardi landed her a mentor. âKara asked me, âWhat do you want to do?â I said, âIâd give anything to write a song like you.â She said, âWell, why canât you do that?ââ DioGuardi offered to write the first two songs with her.\n\nHer first original album, the country/pop-inspired Rita Wilson, came out in 2016. It included collabo-rations with a roster of top songwriters/producers (Kristian Bush of Sugarland, Richard Marx, and the Warren Brothers, among others). She followed it up in 2018 with Bigger Picture.\n\nItâs an experience she doesnât want to relive. âIt was about 10 days of very bad [symptoms]. I had a relatively high fever. I was extremely nauseous. I had vertigo. I had stomach issues, achiness, and a headache that would not go away. I lost taste and smell. All of these things, combined with this unbelievable shivering,â she says. âI never want to get it again.â\n\nIf there could be any upside to her two-weeklong quarantine in Australia, it was the surprising collaboration that came out of it. On March 22 of last year, Wilson posted an Instagram video of herself rapping along with Naughty By Natureâs 1992 classic, âHip Hop Hooray.â Sheâd learned the tongue twister of a song for the 2019 film Boy Genius, a process that she compares to âlearning Shakespeare, but if youâve never spoken English.â\n\nCOVID-19 had left her feeling a little âfuzzy.â She recorded herself performing the song to see if her mind was still limber enough to remember the lyrics. âI thought, maybe Iâll post it to let people know Iâm doing OK,â she says. âAnd it became crazy viral.â\n\nThe hip-hop trio loved it so much that they teamed up with Wilson on a remix. All profits from the song go to support the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, which helps musicians affected by the coronavirus pandemic. âIt was so much fun!â she says. âThey invited me to do it live with them when they go back on tour. You know Iâm going to do that!â\n\nâThe hope is that the antiviral antibodies in the plasma could reduce the effects of the virus, assist in recovery, and hopefully reduce mortality,â says Otto Yang, MD, professor of medicine and associate chief of infectious diseases at UCLAâs David Geffen School of Medicine.\n\nYangâs team is looking at the level of antibodies in people whoâve been infected, and how quickly those antibodies drop over time. Theoretically, antibodies could provide protection against future infection with the virus. He appreciates the awareness Wilson and Hanks have brought to UCLAâs research efforts. âTheyâve been supportive and have publicized this project and a couple of others,â he says.\n\nWilson says she and her husband were more than happy to help. âWe knew that it would be incredibly helpful to people,â she says.\n\nTaking Nothing for Granted\n\nLiving through two major health scares has left Wilson with a profound sense of gratitude. She has a lot to be thankful for -- not only good health, but also several musical projects sheâs launched since getting over COVID-19.\n\nIn 2020, she released the songs âWhen This Is Over,â a collaboration with country artists Jimmie Allen and the Oak Ridge Boys, âWhat I Would Say,â about dealing with a loved oneâs addiction, and âEverybody Criesâ for the war drama The Outpost, which has been generating some Oscar buzz. Sheâs also collaborated with country music legend Dolly Parton, as well as Monica, Jordin Sparks, and Sara Evans, on the single âPINK.â A portion of the proceeds will support Susan G. Komenâs mission to save lives from breast cancer.\n\nâWhat I learned was that each day is so precious and so valuable, and life is so fragile. I really do not want to live one day not telling the people I love that I love them, not finding joy in everything I do, and not without a huge sense of gratitude that I get to be creative, that I get to write music, and produce movies, and act, and do the things that I love to do,â she says. âItâs really about not taking anything for granted. Not one thing.â"
