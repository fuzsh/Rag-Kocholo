        "text": "As Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson mark their wedding anniversary this week, it struck us that we had yet to admire Rita’s stunning engagement ring.\n\nAfter first crossing paths on the set of ‘Bosom Buddies’ in the early eighties, the beloved Hollywood duo tied the knot in 1988, following a courtship of less than two years.\n\nWhile details about the couple’s engagement and wedding remain sparse, engagement ring specialists at Steven Stone have delved into the archives, revealing everything available about the dazzling three stone ring that Tom reportedly proposed with.\n\nHow did Tom and Rita meet?\n\nTom and Rita first met on ABC’s sitcom ‘Bosom Buddies’. Tom had a regular role for two seasons and Rita guest-starred on an episode. At the time, Tom was married to his first wife and college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes – though over the years, Tom’s told numerous interviewers that the attraction was instant.\n\nThe pair then reconnected in 1985 on the set of ‘Volunteers’, which they both starred in alongside the late John Candy. Confident that the two were meant to be, Tom split from his wife shortly after and stepped out as a couple with Rita in December 1986 at the premiere of ‘Three Amigos’.\n\nIt’s unclear when the Hollywood sweethearts got engaged, but they officially got married at Rex’s in Los Angeles, California, on 30th April 1988. They’ve since had two children together – Chet and Truman.\n\nIf you’re looking for some jewellery inspiration, why not take a look at our full collection?
