        "text": "Much-beloved Hollywood star Tom Hanks and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, have been married for over 30 years—a rarity for most married couples, but especially so in Hollywood. Their long-lasting marriage might seem like the happy ending everyone dreams of, but the road to such an enduring partnership wasn’t always so smooth. From the moment they met on the ABC sitcom Bosom Buddies in 1981 to supporting each other in sickness and in health through breast cancer and coronavirus, here is everything you need to know about Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson’s relationship.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson met in 1981 on the set of the ABC sitcom Bosom Buddies while Tom was still married to his college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes.\n\nTom’s first marriage had started fizzling out before he met Rita, and in 1987 with him and his first wife formally separated, Tom and Rita went public with their relationship.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson were married on April 30, 1988, and had two children together, Chet and Truman Hanks.\n\nTheir 32-year marriage has stood strong in the face of health challenges, like Rita’s diagnosis of breast cancer in 2015, and most recently, the couple’s battle against coronavirus in March 2020.\n\n1981: First Meeting\n\nTom and Rita first met on the set of the ABC sitcom Bosom Buddies, where Tom was a regular for two seasons and Rita guest-starred for an episode. Their connection was instant—even though at the time, Tom was still married to his first wife and college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes.\n\n“Rita and I just looked at each other and—kaboing—that was that,\" Tom told GQ. \"I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn't be denied.\"\n\nEven with sparks flying, good-guy Tom tried to make his first marriage work for the sake of the two kids he shared with Samantha, but by the time Tom and Rita reconnected again for the second time on the set of the 1985 movie Volunteers, there was no denying their chemistry.\n\nDecember 1986: Going Public With Their Relationship\n\nThe couple made their red carpet debut at the premiere of Three Amigos in December 1986 while Tom and his first wife were separated but before the divorce was finalized in 1987.\n\nApril 30, 1988: Wedding in Hollywood\n\nAfter less than two years of dating, and a year after his divorce was finalized, Tom married Rita at Rex's in Los Angeles, California. While the marriage may seem rushed, Tom believes the success of their relationship is a matter of “timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection,\" he told Oprah in 2001.\n\n\"When I married Rita, I thought, 'This is going to require some change on my part,’” Tom said. “I won't deny that [fate] was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic the way it’s shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn’t come close to being Hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we’ll be with each other—and we’ll get through it.\"\n\nAugust 4, 1990: Chet Hanks Is Born\n\nTom came into the relationship with two children from his first marriage, Colin and Elizabeth, but on August 4, 1990, Tom and Rita welcomed their first child together, Chester “Chet” Hanks. Today, Chet is a 30-year-old actor and rapper who has appeared in movies and TV shows including Empire, Shameless, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nJune 1993: Rom-Com Co-Stars\n\nTom and Rita make their first on-screen appearance as a married couple in Sleepless in Seattle, where Rita plays the role of Sam Baldwin’s (Tom Hanks) sister.\n\nMarch 1995: Tom Makes History and Thanks His Wife\n\nOn March 27, 1995, Tom became the second actor ever in history to win back-to-back Oscars for his lead roles in Philadelphia (1994) and Forrest Gump (1995).
