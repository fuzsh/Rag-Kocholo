        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have celebrated a huge anniversary as they mark 35 years since they tied the knot.\n\nThe famous couple, both 66, took to social media to share a sweet snap of them together to mark the occasion.\n\nTom and Rita first met on the set of ABC sitcom Bosom Buddies back in 1981, where they were just friends.\n\nThe Forest Gump actor was married to Samantha Lewis at the time but divorced in 1987, after having two children together.\n\nHe reunited with Rita on the set of Volunteers in 1985 and married in 1988.\n\nThe couple share two sons, Truman Theodore Hanks and Chester 'Chet' Hanks.\n\nAfter spending over 35 years together, the couple achieved a relationship milestone over the weekend as the actress and singer-songwriter posted a photo of Tom presenting her with a cake.\n\n\"35 years of marriage. April 30, 1988. Love is everything,\" she wrote.\n\nThe Toy Story star is lovingly looking at his wife as he hands her a yellow frosted cake with 'Happy Anniversary' written on top.\n\nThe couple's A-list pals shared their congratulations, with My Big Fat Greek Wedding star Nia Vardalos commenting: \"Happy Anniversary you beautiful kids!!!!\"\n\nLeslie Odom, Jr. added: \"Just beautiful! Congratulations.\"\n\nJessica Capshaw wrote: \"The best.\"\n\n\"Happy anniversary, Rita! Congratulations!,\" said Jennifer Garner.\n\nAlli Webb gushed: \"The way heâ€™s looking at you LOVE IS EVERYTHING.\"\n\nBack in 2020, Tom and Rita became official Greek citizens, confirmed by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\n\nMr Mitsotakis shared a snap alongside Tom and his wife, who were seen holding up their passports.\n\nRita's mum Dorothea Tzigkou was also born in Albania near the Greece border and have regularly visited Greece over the years.\n\nBefore their marriage, Tom converted to Rita's faith, who is a member of the Greek Orthodox Church.\n\nThe couple own a home on Greek island Antiparos, where they purchased a plot of land to build their own house in 2004.\n\nAnd in 2018, they bought a second home in the Skala area of the Greek island of Patmos.\n\nThe citizenship was also extended to their children Colin, Elizabeth, Chet, and Truman."
