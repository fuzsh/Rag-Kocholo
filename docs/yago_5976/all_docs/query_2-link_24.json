        "text": "Hollywood has seen a lot of great couples, but there hasn't been a couple quite like the one we are about to discuss today. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson's relationship timeline is nothing less than an actual romantic love story.\n\nThe two had been friends for a long time, and soon that friendship turned into a lovely relationship that the two actors still share.\n\nTom Hanks was previously married to his college love, Samantha Lewes; however, the two parted ways soon.
