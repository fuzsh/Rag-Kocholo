        "text": "Love is a many-splendored thing, especially when you’re gawking at it from the outside. In this new column, we’ll be examining the celebrity couples that give us hope for our own romantic futures and trying to learn what we can from their well-documented bonds.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of Hollywood couples who can produce a son like Chet Hanks and still have me rooting for them, but frankly, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are just that charming. (Sorry, Tom and Rita, but you’re simply going to have to take the L on the Chet thing.) The actor couple has been married since 1988, which means their relationship officially predates my existence on this planet, and I hope it somehow lives on long after I’m gone.\n\nPart of the reason I, a noted cynic, allow myself to believe in Hanks and Wilson’s love is that they aren’t one of those celebrity couples who pretend everything is perfect all the time. They hardly seem like drama magnets, but Hanks has been honest about the context for the end of his first marriage, saying, “I was looking for something I had not found as a kid...I was just too young and insecure for marriage.” We love an introspective king!\n\nIf Hanks and Wilson had actually played each other’s love interests in a Nora Ephron movie, I also don’t think I would believe in their courtship; it would just seem too staged, too perfect, if they had experienced divine romantic intervention in the form of one of the greatest writer/directors of all time. Luckily, they were relegated to the roles of best pals in Ephron’s 1993 rom-com Sleepless in Seattle, and not even the Harry-and-Sally-style best pals who totally end up kissing by the end of the movie. (A spoiler, sorry, but you’ve had 28 years to watch Sleepless in Seattle. What have you been doing all this time?)\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit last year, it was the news Tom Hanks had taken ill that, for many, actually solidified what was happening in the world. Wilson tested positive for COVID-19 as well, and the two hunkered down in Australia, with Wilson telling The Guardian that they spent that time “staying inside and watching a lot of old movies.” Far be it from me to romanticize convalescence, but is there anything more endearing than picturing Tom and Rita fighting over a blanket while Casablanca plays in the background?\n\nUltimately, it seems that Hanks and Wilson’s appeal lies in their normalcy, or at least in the appearance of it. (After all, how normal can you really be when you’re both award-winning actors, you’re constantly trailed by paparazzi, and one of your sons has displayed a curious penchant for going viral?) Together, they seem like they could have met at a bar, or been the two best-looking teachers at your high school that everyone spread dating rumors about; their fame is part of their appeal, sure, but there’s more to it than that.\n\nIn summation, all I can offer is this speculation: I feel like Tom makes soup for Rita on a semi-regular basis, and not in a showboating, “Look what I cooked” way, either—just the kind from the can, warmed up and served with a slice of toasted bread. Is there any greater love than that?"
