        "text": "She’s the Tricia Yearwood of Hollywood; lots of money so she’s just gonna buy herself an entertainment career.. But I can’t help being amused by her delusional caterwauling and “sexy” posing. Now I know where the “rapper” son gets it from. No wonder poor Hanks has to keep churning out movies.\n\nBut I can’t help being amused by her delusional caterwauling and “sexy” posing. Now I know where the “rapper” son gets it from.\n\nI was kind thinking that too - this explains a lot about Chet!\n\nThere is a reason they have stayed together so long. The stories of Hanks alcoholism combined with her narcissistic need for recognition as an “actress/singer/activist” seem to explain it. She is willing to put up with it for the fame.\n\nShe's what we've been waiting for. So much so that I'm even willing to end my previous sentence with a preposition. That sweet Rita's playlist will help get us through this nightmare.\n\nShe may be. Ice, I don’t know. I just know she’s done multiple albums at this point and I believe at least one bad video and she still hasn’t figured out she could be doing something a lot more successful and better with that Hanks cash she’s burning though.\n\nHere’s global mega songstress Ms Wilson performing one of her latest chart topping singles. Watch, as pretty white ladies in nice homes waft through sunny rooms and lush grounds with chirping birds, while the dulcet tones of Mrs Hanks enrobe you with the audible equivalent of sweet magnolia and buttercream lyrics, See the People’s Producer bathed in a heavenly glow as she coos and slinks around the kitchen and through the home of affluent white people who don’t appear to know her, but who are no doubt well compensated for their tolerances, as they write letters and look at one another lovingly. And now, please behold Ms. Rita Wilson in, ‘Throw Me A Party’\n\nI thought she was one of the brighter lights in 'Girls', as Marnie's aspiring songstress mom. And I liked her 10 minute role as Elliot's divorce attorney in thirtysomething.\n\nShe's not all that hateable to me. She and Tom sat in the row in front of us at the Joni Mitchell birthday tribute concert. They were having fun.\n\nShe seems to fawn over her husband's BFF Miss Julia on Instagram. Replies to any photo as though wanting people to know they're close. But she is for the most part harmless. I've yet to see truly cunty behavior. And poster up thread is correct. Trisha is not a good comparison. Year wood is a talented singer and songwriter. She was already doing well for fherself before bagging a superstar. Rita was always a third banana in most movies. She's never been bad but her roles have for the most part been fool proof. There's bit adjacent parts. That said I hope both her and Hanks are doing well and recover.\n\n[quote] She may be.

She’s a successful producer. You sound like a misogynistic cow.\n\nI expected something much worse from the video at r15.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I want to never see it again, but her voice isn't bad. I just don't care for what she's doing with it. I was expecting Kris Kardashian \"I Love My Friends\"."
