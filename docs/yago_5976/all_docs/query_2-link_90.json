        "text": "It will be tough to find someone who isn’t a fan of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson — and that’s because that person probably doesn’t exist. Not only are Tom and Rita supposedly two of the nicest people in the world, but their marriage is filled with nothing but love and kindness.\n\nThe happy couple met in 1981 and have been inseparable ever since. Rita was right by her man when he reeled in his two Academy Awards and countless other accolades for his incredible work. During an April 2020 appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, the “Throw Me a Party” singer revealed what drew her to her hubby in the first place.\n\n“I love a good storyteller. So anybody who could tell a good story, I’m down with that,” she gushed to the American Idol alum about Tom’s ability to keep her interested. “I love that. He makes me laugh all the time. He’s a great storyteller.”\n\nRita also loves the fact that Tom is supportive of her career. When the Sleepless in Seattle star changed gears from acting to singing, her beloved had her back all the way. “Go, go, go!” she exclusively told Closer Weekly of what the Toy Story actor told her when he learned she wanted to be a musician. “You just get to a certain point in your life, which is like, I don’t care. I don’t care. I’m doing what I love to do.”\n\n“I prayed to God every day for years that he’d bring me somebody I loved who loved me in the same way. And he brought me Tom,” the Runaway Bride actress once said of the man who even stuck by her through her tough times, including her 2015 breast cancer battle.\n\n“I was so blown away by the care he gave me,” she added. Today, the pair is still going strong and they share two kids — Chet and Truman."
