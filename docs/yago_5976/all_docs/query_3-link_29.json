        "text": "When it comes to Hollywood power couples, two names always seem to come to mind, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson.\n\nOn April 30, the legendary actor took to social media to celebrate a monumental occasion. Two of the most well-known people in Hollywood, Hanks and Wilson have been married for 36 years.\n\nIt’s a feat not often seen in that world. And yet, the beloved couple manages to make their envied marriage work year after year.\n\n“1988? April 30th? Big Doings. The Wilson & Hanks couple became Wife & Husband. 36 years! Nothing but Love since,” the actor wrote, signing his caption “Hanx.”\n\nThe major milestone comes just days after Wilson debuted her newest song “Set You Free.” “New record from my favorite female singer-songwriter,” he shared.\n\nWilson also shared a message on their 36th wedding anniversary, writing, “36th anniversary! April 30, 1988.” She then added a quote by Robert Browning, “Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be.”\n\n“The smiles say it all,” one commenter wrote. “Happy Anniversary!!!”\n\nOver the last 36 years, the couple has built an incredible life together. They are parents of four kids, two of which are from Hanks’ first marriage, and now, they are the grandparents of three grandchildren.\n\nBack in 2023, Hanks and Wilson shared their tips and tricks for being great grandparents while talking with Entertainment Tonight. According to Wilson, it’s all about staying active.\n\n“You got to get on the trampoline with them, you got to get in the pool with them, you got to get on the tennis court, you got to do all the sports. You just got to hang out.”\n\nWhile Hanks says it’s all about what can be done in the kitchen. “You have to make their macaroni and cheese just perfectly,” he admitted."
