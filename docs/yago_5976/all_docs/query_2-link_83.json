        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson turned their latest event into a family affair.\n\nThe longtime couple attended the premiere of Apple TV+’s “Masters of the Air” Wednesday night in Los Angeles with their sons Chet and Truman.\n\nThe famous family posed for photos both on the red carpet and inside the Regency Village Theatre, with the Oscar winner, 67, opting for an all-black ensemble while Chet, 33, wore a green jacket with his suit.\n\nWilson, also 67, complemented her husband in all black while Truman, 28, went with a light-colored button-down shirt underneath a black blazer.\n\n“It’s really fun! It’s great,” the proud mom told “Entertainment Tonight” of going to the premiere with her sons.\n\nThe “Forrest Gump” star, who serves as executive producer on the new World War II series, said having the premiere at the Regency Village made him nostalgic.\n\n“What I like about it is, we’re back in the movie theater and not only remembering the nights we were here [for premieres] … but we also remember the [other] times, [like when] I dropped off my son Colin to see ‘Batman’ by himself here one Saturday afternoon,” he shared.\n\n“So it’s our hometown, and this is where we saw the movies.”\n\nHanks and Wilson, who also share daughter Elizabeth, 41, have had a turbulent relationship with Chet, who has struggled with substance abuse issues throughout his life.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nIn November 2022, the “White Boy Summer” rapper recalled his parents sending him to a grueling wilderness program in Utah to help his addiction.\n\n“They just hiked us in circles with an 80-pound pack,” he recalled of the experience. “There’s a lot going through your mind. You’re under observation. … They’re psychoanalyzing you and picking you apart.”\n\nChet now has been sober for nearly three years and devoted himself to God.\n\n“The more I look around at the world I see that the world doesn’t need any more caricatures. False depictions of who we think we need to be,” he wrote on social media in July 2023.\n\n“There’s only one thing the world needs more of and that’s God.”"
