        "text": "You know what they say, behind every national treasure is a real gem.\n\nAnd Tom Hanks would be the first to say that wife Rita Wilson is the star of this operation, this enduring love affair that started more than 35 years ago and continues to warm cold, jaded hearts in Hollywood and beyond.\n\n\"I'm a lucky man,\" Hanks quipped to E! News in 2016. \"She could've done better.\"\n\nWell-played, sir. But we didn't think that was true then and we certainly don't think it's true now.\n\nBut if there's a real secret to their success, they're not giving it away. \"Always letting the press know that there is a secret, and we bottled it,\" Hanks joked to Fox News Digital at Clive Davis' pre-Grammy Gala about their enviable number of years together. But, the two-time Oscar winner added, \"We'll sell it to you individually, for $17 billion.\"\n\nIn case you're a little short this month, we'll do our best to fill you in.\n\nHanks claims he first thought Wilson was adorable in 1972 when his 16-year-old self spied her in her first-ever TV role, playing a cheerleader on The Brady Bunch. But they first laid eyes on each other in person in 1981 when Wilson appeared on an episode of Bosom Buddies, Hanks' short-lived sitcom about two advertising creatives who moonlight as women because the only affordable apartment they can find is in a ladies-only building.\n\nThe actor was already a young husband and father at the time, however, married since 1978 to his college sweetheart Samantha Lewes. Son Colin Hanks was born in 1977 and daughter Elizabeth would arrive in 1982.\n\nSo, life went on.\n\nBut fate brought Wilson and Hanks back together a few years later on the set of the 1985 comedy Volunteers. Hanks was fresh from his big-screen breakout role in Splash, which launched him toward becoming the premiere leading funny-and-nice guy of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBut as a father of two so early, \"I didn't smoke pot. I didn't go into drugs, I was not a party boy. I didn't drink too much,\" he continued on Desert Island Discs. \"I went to bed at 10 minutes after 10 p.m....The rules were in place and I'm not a cheater. I like to play by the rules. But later on, you're 27, 28, you've learned what to say 'yes' to—and you end up meeting that other person, man, woman—that 'Oh, she gets it!'\"\n\nHe and Wilson were a couple by the end of 1986; his divorce from Lewes was finalized in early 1987. Then Hanks and Wilson married on April 30, 1988.\n\nIt occurred to him at the time, \"I don't think I'm ever going to be lonely anymore.\"\n\nBut no matter how meant to be they seem in hindsight, Hanks is also self-aware enough to have admitted that it probably wouldn't have worked out if they had got together any earlier.\n\n\"The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection,\" he told Winfrey. \"When I married Rita, I thought, 'This is going to require some change on my part.' I won't deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn't magic—the way it's shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn't come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we'll be with each other—and we'll get through it.\"\n\nSounds strangely human...\n\n\"We deal with what has to be dealt with, but there is something natural to the foundation of our marriage,\" Hanks also said. \"I am now at the point where I can't imagine it any other way.\"\n\nThey've also been best friends \"from the very beginning,\" he added. \"We laugh just as much now at two in the morning as we always have. And we fight less and less.\"\n\nFast-forward to 2013 and he quipped to Ellen DeGeneres, \"I'm not one to suck up to the audience, but the only thing we argue about is who loves each other more.\"\n\nWhen he talked to Winfrey in 2001, the couple had already emerged unscathed from the hurdle that gets so many—a divergence in the career trajectory. Wilson is an always-working actress, producer and, in her latest chapter, a recording, touring singer—whose husband compared her performance at Davis' party on Feb. 4 to \"a bottle of champagne that came uncorked.\"\n\nBut not every man in Hollywood could have been counted on to handle mega-fame, riches and consecutive Oscar wins with the humbleness that Hanks exhibited, while still exuding likability (in public and at home).\n\n\"Here's what I know,\" he began his speech. \"I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about [by Neil Young], and I have that in a lover that is so close to fine we should all be able to be able to experience such heaven right here on earth.\"\n\nIn 1995 he was back at it for Forrest Gump, giving Wilson double kisses and telling the audience that, among the reasons he was standing there, \"the woman I share my life with has taught me and demonstrates for me every day just what love is.\" (He's been nominated three times since, but really, the Academy has to get him back up there.)\n\nAsked about that speech's swoon factor, he told Winfrey, \"Maybe that sentiment is possible to fake, but for me it's really true. What makes me different from others is that I verbalize this stuff. A lot of people would flee from what they think is award-show cheesiness, and I don't. I often joke that my speeches are very personal moments that play themselves out in front of billions of people.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I feel blessed to have a loving, supportive husband, family, friends and doctors and that I am the beneficiary of advances in the field of breast cancer and reconstruction. I am getting better every day and look forward to renewed health.\"\n\nWilson admitted to the New York Times that, contrary to how it might seem, revealing that much about her truly personal life wasn't easy. But she also felt it was important to share her story in case it could help other women.\n\n\"I'm in public because of the nature of what I do,\" she said, \"but I don't feel it necessary to let the world know what I'm thinking, where I'm eating. I've always liked being on the periphery of things.\"\n\nAnd she said about that husband of hers, \"Who knew it would make you even closer?\" When she was undergoing treatment, the longtime Malibu residents hunkered down at home catching up on Oscar screeners and Hanks stepped up.\n\n\"You never know how your spouse is going to react in a situation like this,\" Wilson said. \"I was so amazed, so blown away by the care my husband gave me. It was such a normal, intimate time.\"\n\nHe's just kind of like that, though. (But it's telling that even Wilson can still be blown away by all that Hanksiness, that's how lovely he is.)\n\n\"All I can do is bow down before the courage of my wife,\" Hanks told The Mirror in 2016.\n\nAnother hallmark of their relationship is how supportive Hanks is of Wilson in all of her endeavors, be it her acting, music or philanthropy—and better yet, he doesn't look at himself as some benevolent super-being. He's simply a devoted partner.\n\n\"My wife and my daughter have yet to allow themselves to be defined by only the man in their lives,\" Hanks told Emma Watson, his co-star in The Circle, when she interviewed him for Esquire in 2016. \"The women I have worked with and those I seek inspiration from have had different perspectives on all there is to have an opinion on in this world, and I have always learned from listening to them. My support of those women and those in my family has been the same as it has for any man or any of my sons.\"\n\nAnd at the end of the day, he and Wilson just like each other and really like being married to each other.\n\n\"People say, 'Jeez, it must be hard to stay married in show business,'\" Hanks told The Mirror. \"I think it's hard to stay married anywhere, but if you marry the right person, it might work out. We give each other a natural sense of support for whatever the other wants to pursue. Our marriage doesn't require vast work. We have been married 28 years and dig each other a lot.\"\n\nSome tunes never go out of style.\n\nAt her induction into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where her husband spoke admiringly of her talent, Wilson told Us Weekly, \"It's like anything. We got married, we committed to each other, we love each other and we work hard at our relationship.\"\n\n\"Not only do we love each other,\" she added, \"we really like each other, and we like being together, and we support each other and we keep the communication channels open. That's always important.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hanks told the audience about his wife's long career, \"The lesson here is that Rita Wilson knows what she is doing. Her instincts are wicked sharp.\"\n\nWe can't help but agree.\n\n(Originally published April 30, 2018, at 5 a.m. PT)"
