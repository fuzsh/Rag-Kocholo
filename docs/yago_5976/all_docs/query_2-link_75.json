        "text": "Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been married for more than 30 years—and their decades in the spotlight have been admirable, to say the least. Throw in the fact that they recently battled and overcame the novel coronavirus together, and well, their bond seems practically invincible.\n\nThe list of hurdles and victories the 63-year-olds have cleared as a team gave them the resilience they have today. And like any good Hollywood love story, it all started on the set of an ‘80s sitcom. Below, a closer look at their relationship over the years.\n\nBosom Buddies brought them together.\n\nHanks had a starring role in the ABC comedy, and when Wilson appeared as a guest, their connection was clear. “Rita and I just looked at each other and—kaboing—that was that,” he told GQ, per The Daily Mail. “I asked Rita if it was the real thing for her, and it just couldn’t be denied.”\n\nIt helped that Hanks had already developed a crush from afar, having seen her on The Brady Bunch in the early ‘70s. “I was actually at a friend of mine’s house when it aired and I remember thinking ‘That girl’s cute,’” he told reporters in 2016, per People.\n\nThey got closer while filming Volunteers.\n\nTheir work together continued when they co-starred in the 1985 film Volunteers. They became good friends, but Hanks was still married to his late ex-wife Samantha Lewes, who passed away in 2002 from bone cancer. He and Lewes had two children together, Colin and Elizabeth.\n\n“When we first looked at each other there was definitely a kind of, ‘Hey, this is the place!’” Tom Hanks later told Entertainment Tonight, referring to their fateful reunion. “I felt that anyway. I think the end result is that we got married for all the right reasons.”\n\nThey made their first public appearance as a couple in 1986.\n\nAlthough Hanks wasn’t officially divorced yet, he and Lewes were separated when Wilson took his arm at the premiere event for Three Amigos in 1986. “I was looking for something I had not found as a kid,” Hanks told UK Express. “And a broken marriage meant I was sentencing my own kids to the sort of feelings I had at their age. I was just too young and insecure for marriage. I was 23 and my son Colin was already two when I married for the first time. I was not really ready to take on those responsibilities.”\n\nHis divorce from Lewes became official in 1987, per Huffington Post.\n\nThey married in 1988.\n\nOn April 30, 1988, the couple finally got what they wanted: marriage. “I didn’t know what being in love was until I met Tom,” Wilson once told Vanity Fair, per People. In 2001, Hanks told Oprah what has kept their marriage alive.\n\n“The success of our relationship was a matter of timing, maturity, and our willingness to have an intimate connection,” he said. “When I married Rita, I thought, ‘This is going to require some change on my part.’”\n\nHe added, “I won’t deny that providence was part of us finding each other, but our relationship isn’t magic—the way it’s shown in movies. In real life, our connection is as concrete as me sitting here. Not that marriage doesn’t come close to being hell in a handbasket sometimes. But we both know that no matter what, we’ll be with each other—and we’ll get through it.”\n\nThey welcomed their first child in 1990.\n\nChester “Chet” Marlon Hanks was born on August 4, 1990. Like his parents, he’s now an established actor, and has appeared in plenty of mainstream TV shows like Empire, Shameless, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nIn 1993, they were Sleepless in Seattle.\n\nThey made their first appearance in film together since getting married in Sleepless in Seattle, but instead of playing lovers, they were siblings.\n\nIn March 1995, Hanks credited Wilson for his Oscar-winning performance in Forrest Gump.\n\n“I am standing here because the woman I share my life with has taught me and demonstrates for me every day just what love is,” Hanks said in his acceptance speech after winning the 1995 Academy Award for Best Actor. Later, in 2001, he told O, The Oprah Magazine that “without [his] connection with Rita, [he doesn’t] know how [he] would’ve been able to connect with what Forrest was going through.”\n\nThey welcomed their second child in December 1995.\n\nTruman Theodore Hanks was born the day after Christmas. At 24 years old, he’s just getting a career started in Hollywood, choosing to work behind the scenes.\n\nRita Wilson and Tom Hanks with their children Truman Theodore (left) and Chester Marlon (right) at a LA Dodgers vs St. Louis Cardinals game in 2004.\n\nIn 2002, they produced their first movie together.\n\nAny My Big Fat Greek Wedding fans out there? Hanks and Wilson co-produced the film and its sequel. “My wife saw an ad back in the day in the LA Times calendar section for a one woman show called My Big Fat Greek Wedding and she laughed and said ‘I’m going to go see the show,’ and she did,” Hanks said at the New York premiere of the second movie in 2016. “She came home and said ‘I think that’s a movie,’ and it was.”\n\nThe couple would go on to produce two more Greek films, the iconic musical and its sequel .\n\nWilson was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2015.\n\nThe couple’s lives were completely changed when Wilson was told she had breast cancer, after initially being misdiagnosed. “With my husband by my side, and with the love and support of family and friends, I underwent a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer after a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma,” she told People after her surgery. “I am recovering and most importantly, expected to make a full recovery. Why? Because I caught this early, have excellent doctors and because I got a second opinion.”\n\nShe continued, “I feel blessed to have a loving, supportive husband, family, friends and doctors and that I am the beneficiary of advances in the field of breast cancer and reconstruction. I am getting better every day and look forward to renewed health.”\n\nThey celebrated 30 years of marriage in April 2018.\n\nHanks shared the sweetest side-by-side Instagram photo of their wedding day compared to the present. “30 years on April 30. ‘88 To ‘18. Magic numbers,” he wrote.\n\nHanks’ 2019 role in Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood improved their marriage.\n\n“When my wife and I are going at it on those rare occasions, when she is letting me know that I’m not really listening to her and I’m trying to establish what the ground rules are [for the argument], when we’re going at it like that, one of us will say, ‘Well, you know what? You know what, honey? It’s good to talk. It’s good to say the things we feel,’” the actor told Entertainment Tonight. “And I learned that from Mister Rogers.”\n\nIn March 2020, they were both diagnosed with—and recovered from—COVID-19.\n\nThe day after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, Hanks and Wilson announced their positive diagnoses. They reportedly contracted it on set of an upcoming Elvis Presley film in Australia (on which production has since been indefinitely suspended), and were in isolation for a month before they fully recovered.\n\n“I thank God every day, literally for my health, and also our human spirit is also amazing—as well as our bodies,” Wilson told Today, reflecting on her experience with two life-threatening health crises. “And also thankful for the amazing healthcare workers and the doctors that are getting us through all of this.”"
