April 30 1988. Love is everything,” she captioned the pic.\n\nA host of the couple’s celeb friends chimed in with their congrats.\n\n“Happy anniversary, Rita! Congratulations! ♥️♥️♥️,” wrote Jennifer Garner.\n\n“❤️❤️❤️❤️ Happy Anniversary you two!!!!!,” commented “SNL” star Kenan Thompson, while “Will & Grace” alum Sean Hayes wrote: HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!!

Love wins,” Wilson captioned a photo of them posing outside while wearing white.\n\nThe pair first met in 1981 on the set of Hank’s sitcom “Bosom Buddies.” At the time, he was still married to his first wife, college sweetheart, Samantha Lewes. They had two children together, actor Colin Hanks, 45, and writer Elizabeth Hanks, 40.\n\nBy 1987, Hanks and Lewes had officially separated and a year late he and Wilson got married.\n\nThey share two sons together, Chet, 32, and Truman, 27.\n\nThe couple have shared difficult times together.\n\nChet has been open about his addiction issues, revealing last year that his parents sent him to a program for “troubled teens” in 2008.\n\nWilson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy followed by reconstruction surgery.\n\nFive years later both actors tested positive for COVID-19 while Hanks was filming “Elvis” in Australia.\n\nThe March 2020 diagnosis, which was early on in the pandemic, made international headlines as they were the first high-profile names to contract the virus."
