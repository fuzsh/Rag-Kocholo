        "text": "Tom Hanks sported a very different look as he enjoyed a shopping trip in London with his wife Rita Wilson after their 36th wedding anniversary.\n\nThe Forrest Gump actor, 67, is normally suited and booted but wore a beatnik-inspired outfit for his date in the capital.\n\nLooking very punk, he wore a black beret and circular sunglasses reminiscent of John Lennon, a faded denim jacket, and Doc Marten shoes.\n\nRita, 67, meanwhile, looked very chic in a long black coat and her hair tied back in a bun as Tom carried their shopping bags.\n\nTo mark their anniversary, both Tom and Rita posted sweet pictures and captions on their Instagram accounts.\n\nThe Elvis actor wrote: ‘1988? April 30th? Big Doings. The Wilson & Hanks couple became Wife & Husband. 36 years! Nothing but Love since… Hanx.’\n\nRita said: ’36th anniversary! April 30,1988. “Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be.” – Robert Browning.’\n\nThe Sleepless in Seattle actor and Rita first met on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981, although Tom was still married to his college sweetheart the late Samantha Lewes.\n\nThey later starred together in 1985 Volunteers and went public with their relationship the following year after Tom had separated from Lewes.\n\nThe Toy Story actor and Rita share two sons Chet, 33, and Truman, 28. Tom is also dad to Colin, 46, and Elizabeth, 41, from his relationship to Lewes.\n\nTom appears to be a regular visitor to London and was even seen lurking in The London Library in September.\n\nThe library shared a picture of the Saving Private Ryan actor immersed in a book in the history section.\n\nHe was said to be particularly impressed with the ‘rich variety’ of the library’s open-access collections.\n\nIt comes after he was forced to issue a warning to fans after an AI promotional video used his image without his consent.\n\nOn Instagram, he wrote: ‘BEWARE!! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Why Chris Pine’s ‘lesbian aunt’ evolution is the best thing to happen to a Hollywood man\n\nMORE : Beyonce and Jay Z video sparks wild fan theory"
