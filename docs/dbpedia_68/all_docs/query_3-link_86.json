        "text": "Our applications ARE OPEN for on call firefighter recruitment, but you must work or live within a 5-minute radius of one of our on call stations.\n\nOn call firefighters can be anything from factory workers, cooks and farmers to caters, stay at home parents or students.\n\nHave information on a deliberate fire? Tell FireStoppers what you know. Even small outdoor fires can be dangerous, because they place additional stress on our limited resources – dealing with a nuisance fire affects our ability to respond to more serious incidents like house fires or road traffic accidents. If you have information regarding an incident of deliberate fire, you can tell us what you know, 100% anonymously. We are interested in what you know, not your identity.\n\nCounty Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service’s Business Fire Safety Team are working in partnership the local Authorities to ensure that businesses in the Service area are Covid secure. Whilst carrying out Fire Safety Audits the team will be ensuring compliance with Covid-19 secure measures to help protect employees, the Community and our own staff whilst carrying out these inspections.\n\nPrevention Activity We encourage all households to have a Home Fire Safety visit with our service; your safety is our priority.\n\nStart your home fire safety check here It will take you through your home one room at a time and the simple questions will help you spot fire risks. Learn more...\n\nDo you live or work within 5 minutes of one of our On-Call stations?\n\nOn-call firefighters are those who are able to provide evening, daytime or weekend cover. They are ready to go out to a call the moment a message comes through."
