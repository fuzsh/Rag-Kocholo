        "text": "The Community Support Scheme is a discretionary scheme which exists to help Darlington’s most vulnerable qualifying residents. Funding for the scheme is limited and we consider the total number of people applying and what funds are available when making a decision. There are two forms of award that can be made:\n\nCrisis support awards refers to an urgent need as a consequence of an emergency, disaster, unforeseen circumstance or pressing need that is strikingly different from pressures generally associated with managing on a low income and where a household has insufficient resources to meet urgent an urgent need that poses an immediate and substantial risk to their health and safety.\n\nCommunity care support awards to help people remain in the community or move back into the community after a period in supported or unsettled accommodation.\n\nThe Telephone Line operates from 10.00 am until 1:00 pm and from 2:00 pm until 4.00 pm daily (with the exception of bank holidays)."
