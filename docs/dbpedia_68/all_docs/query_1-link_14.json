Has the through platform been scrapped? The NR press release suggests not, although they have been known to contain errors?\n\nNo one knows, whenever Tees Mayor outs a press release out about work at the station it has a different number of platforms each time, and a different intention of how they will be used.\n\nIs last reply was it’s a new local station for local trains and long distance trains will continue to use the existing part of station.\n\nThere is a closed thread about this in the infrastructure forum, which has the background story. When the thread was closed in late 2021, the last post suggested it was going to start ‘next summer’, ie summer 2022, :\n\nDarlington Station Extension/Re-modelling\n\nThis is a relatively simple scheme with a lot of benefits for the Northern ECML that has now been approved by the town council. The proposal is to extend the station to the other side of the East Coast mainline with a connection to the existing station, creating a new through platform for...\n\nThere are some links within the previous thread to the council’s planning application site, but they might not be current.\n\nYou are right, yhat NR press release does still say\n\n\"The two new platforms will provide passengers with a better service and more travel options in the future. They will also improve reliability and reduce delays for both local and long-distance high-speed services on the East Coast Main Line, both for now and in the future\"\n\nso maybe there is another platform face, which could be a bay out of sight in the picture.\n\nBut what a shame that it's not 2 southbound through platforms which would have been so much more flexible. But then, this isn't London or even the SE we are considering...\n\nBuilding work on the new site is cracking on ( i was there today) with a lot of land clearance ( East End WMC - RIP), new car park going up, access to existing station ( a new bridge) due to start soon, construction of new station area starting soon also.\n\nI do fear the new area will be very isolated from the main station ! Here is what Network Rail say:\n\nNetwork Rail is working with the Tees Valley Combined Authority, Darlington Borough Council and LNER to provide two new platforms on the Eastern side of the station and a new, fully accessible, and enclosed footbridge linking them to the current station building.\n\nNew cycle lanes will also be introduced, with bicycle shelters and a multi-storey car park which will attach onto the new station building. The car park will include secure parking for over 600 cars, including accessible parking bays and electric car charging points.\n\nhttps://www.networkrailmediacentre....ngton-station-as-major-upgrade-work-continues\n\nand this new civil engineer article shows the size of the site: https://www.newcivilengineer.com/la...-150m-darlington-station-overhaul-11-08-2023/\n\nWillmott Dixon is also delivering the integrated multi-storey car park. Other contractors on the scheme are Aecom and Bam Nuttall, while the station has been designed by Nappier Architects.\n\nThe project is on track to complete in 2025.\n\nBut what a shame that it's not 2 southbound through platforms which would have been so much more flexible. But then, this isn't London or even the SE we are considering...\n\nit is the crossing moves for Bishop > Saltburn ( and vice versa) trains that need to be eliminated. There is enough capacity in the existing station for ECML trains.\n\nBuilding work on the new site is cracking on ( i was there today) with a lot of land clearance ( East End WMC - RIP), new car park going up, access to existing station ( a new bridge) due to start soon, construction of new station area starting soon also.\n\nWhat is actually being built railway wise isn't very clear and i do fear it will be very isolated from the main station !\n\nit is the crossing moves for Bishop > Saltburn ( and vice versa) trains that need to be eliminated. There is enough capacity in the existing station for ECML trains.\n\n... except that the picture shows just a single (through down platform) in the old trainshed, as well as the same on the new up. Is that really enough on a busy main line with LNER, TPE and Northern services?\n\nDoesn't seem future-proofed to me.\n\nit has been ok since about 1887\n\nNot!\n\nCome on, there are currently 2 through platforms in the trainshed (if I remember it right,) this reduces it to just 1, although admittedly only for northbound trains.\n\nAnd I suspect that with our modern expectations of fast and slower services on main lines (and connections between them - I still yearn for some sort of an integrated timetable) this will prevent any significant improvements for decades, without another costly rebuilding (and remodelling, when the resignalling will probably cost as much as all the rest put together!)\n\nI wouldn't fancy paying the bill for the additional costs of building a new island platform between the up through and the new up one when this phase is fully in use...\n\nNot!\n\nCome on, there are currently 2 through platforms in the trainshed (if I remember it right,) this reduces it to just 1, although admittedly only for northbound trains.\n\nAnd I suspect that with our modern expectations of fast and slower services on main lines (and connections between them - I still yearn for some sort of an integrated timetable) this will prevent any significant improvements for decades, without another costly rebuilding (and remodelling, when the resignalling will probably cost as much as all the rest put together!)\n\nI wouldn't fancy paying the bill for the additional costs of building a new island platform between the up through and the new up one when this phase is fully in use...\n\nThe second photo of the set on the NR article shows the current up through platform with the new footbridge heading to the left, over towards the new up side platforms. It doesn’t show the current down through at all, which is hidden on the other side beyond the new stairs and escalators.\n\nWhat is it that makes you think the current down through platform won’t be retained as well?\n\nThere will still be at least two through platforms. The question mark is simply over whether it's one in the train shed and one on the new station or if its still both in the train shed with the new station relegated to only hosting the hourly Northern stopping service in a new bay platform.\n\nThe original (or at least final original) plan was for the current northbound platform (P4 and P4A) to become effectively only for Bishop Auckland services to terminate in (they would no longer run beyond Darlington). The two bays would (P2 and P3) would still be available but unused usually. The current southbound platform (P1) would instead become the northbound platform. The new station outside the existing train shed would then have a southbound platform (presumably P5) and then at least one or two bay platforms (P6 and P7?) for the Saltburn services. Hence still only two through platforms but a not inconsiderably uplift in capacity by removing all the Northern movements from the ECML during the day.\n\nWhat the plan has become is, as @800001 alluded to, now somewhat unclear. We might still be getting the original plan (but probably only one new bay with passive provision for the second), or we might be getting less (I'm gambling on less personally) with no new through platform meaning trains continue to use the original train shed for through services in both directions.\n\nWhat is it that makes you think the current down through platform won’t be retained as well?\n\nPost #4 could be taken to mean removal of platform 4, if you had a particular bee in your bonnet about infrastructure being deliberately deprioritised for the North.\n\nNot!\n\nCome on, there are currently 2 through platforms in the trainshed (if I remember it right,) this reduces it to just 1, although admittedly only for northbound trains.\n\nMy understanding of the plans is that the existing trainshed platforms are all retained as is, although it's been some years since I saw a scheme plan. You would therefore have 3 full-length platforms for trains to use.\n\nAnd I suspect that with our modern expectations of fast and slower services on main lines (and connections between them\n\nTrains can largely sort themselves out on the Racing Stretch, with all trains currently stopping Darlington the service isn't really frequent enough to need more than 1 platform per direction, so having the extra one is beneficial for amended working. Fast modern trains with good acceleration make light work of Darlington - Durham - Chester-le-Street - Newcastle so you don't need to loop trains for 6-7 minutes at Darlington.\n\nMy understanding of the plans is that the existing trainshed platforms are all retained as is, although it's been some years since I saw a scheme plan. You would therefore have 3 full-length platforms for trains to use.\n\nagreed - my understanding also - with a strong hint that the existing north bound through platform will be used in times of \"perturbed\" working\n\nYes that was the original intention though P4 (the current northbound) would not typically be being used for through services but would still be there if required (though some fancy footwork would be required as the Bishop trains would be using it to start and terminate from/in).\n\njust bung the bishop train in P4a Works now. ( i am still not convinced any of this work is actually needed! it was when there was going to be a massive ECML north service enhancement but that seems to have gone for a Burton! )\n\n(I'm gambling on less personally)\n\nHigh Viz Houchen and Tory boy Gibson wont allow that - there is an election coming up - They are pumping these works massively on social media.\n\njust bung the bishop train in P4a Works now.\n\nAs long as the bypass line is retained, Bishop Auckland trains down to 4A and let the mainline train nip around to 4B as happens every so often nowadays. Nice seamless same-platform connectivity as well to boot\n\nAbsolutely, though it will be torturous as the bypass is so much slower than a straight in approach to P4! But yes perfectly doable to have through trains running via P4 whilst the Bishop trains do their thing on P4A. Just requires a bit of care when it's being done ad-hoc during disruption but I have faith in the controllers at York ROC and the signallers in Tyneside would cope!\n\n( i am still not convinced any of this work is actually needed! it was when there was going to be a massive ECML north service enhancement but that seems to have gone for a Burton! )\n\nYeah I know what you mean. Without any substantial uplift in services on the ECML proper (can't afford HS2, need the money to fix pot holes in London after all) nor on the local services (there was some chuntering about increasing the number of services once they no longer have to cross the ECML both ways) it does all feel rather pointless. Especially if what we do end up with is a singular new bay platform for the hourly Darlington - Saltburn service!\n\nHigh Viz Houchen and Tory boy Gibson wont allow that - there is an election coming up - They are pumping these works massively on social media.\n\nOh so you've noticed that too then?\n\nYes that's the badger though I'm fairly sure they ended up dropping that through P6 from the final plan with it just being a bay platform alongside P7 but hopefully helps those less familiar get a better grasp of what was planned. Right now it feels as if what we're actually going to get is basically just P7, i.e. a single new bay platform. But we wait in hope!\n\nYes, but all the initial publicity and plans published and often spouted by Tees Mayor were for 2 bay platforms and a new through up platform, which as others have mentioned above plans have kept changing and actually no one knows specifically what it’s getting built.\n\nI know for the £150million plus they are building a ghastly multi-storey car park, a new footbridge and some sort of new platforms.\n\nThe confusion is understandable - Darlington BC's planning website says 1 platform and has a plan that confuses the issue, while Tees Valley Combined Authority, NR, BAM Nuttall, and Modern Railways say two platform faces.\n\nBest diagram I've found was this Modern Railways one from last July:\n\nDarlington’s anniversary upgrade\n\nNew platforms and a new station building are due to be in place for the 200th anniversary of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 2025\n\nDarlington Station 2025 - A New Future\n\nThe investment and work being done will transform Darlington Station, improve the region’s local and national transport links, tie the station more closely to town and upgrade the station’s services and accessibility for all people. Buildings have been cleared to make way for an extension to the...\n\nDarlington station improvements\n\nTees Valley Combined Authority, in partnership with the Council, Network Rail and LNER, is planning a comprehensive improvement project at Darlington Station.\n\nOh so you've noticed that too then?\n\na little bit of algorithm gaming and Facebook thinks you still live there ( and my mum sends me screenshots!)\n\nYes that's the badger though I'm fairly sure they ended up dropping that through P6 from the final plan with it just being a bay platform alongside P7 but hopefully helps those less familiar get a better grasp of what was planned. Right now it feels as if what we're actually going to get is basically just P7, i.e. a single new bay platform. But we wait in hope!\n\nI think the footprint will be as shown. What is tracked up is unknown,\n\nI know for the £150million plus they are building a ghastly multi-storey car park, a new footbridge and some sort of new platforms.\n\nthey knocked down the east end club and removed the tunnel of death for that! I am glad i don't live there anymore. My house was a couple of streets over and i know the locals are really worried about traffic congestion\n\na PS: Wilmot Dixon have concerned the market in Darlo - they are lead contractor on the Hopetown project as well."
