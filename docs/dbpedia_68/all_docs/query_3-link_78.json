        "text": "Whilst this situation has been created by a number of different land uses and management techniques, the Council and other Local Authorities in the Tees Catchment have been advised that we need to consider the nutrient impacts of relevant development.\n\nDevelopments within the scope of Natural England's advice include anything which creates overnight accommodation, such as:\n\nnew homes\n\nstudent accommodation\n\ncare homes\n\ntourism attractions\n\ntourist accommodation\n\nThis may also include agriculture and commercial development where it has the potential to release nitrogen. Natural England have produced a summary guide including answers to frequently asked questions on their website, and you are asked to review these documents before contacting them directly.\n\nView the Natural England guide to nutrient neutrality\n\nNatural England have suggested that, in many cases, this issue can be tackled through an approach based on the concept of Nutrient Neutrality. A Nutrient Neutrality Budget Calculator (NNBC) tool for the Tees catchment is available which allows a nutrient budget to be established for any development.\n\nThe local authorities in the Tees Catchment have commissioned a study which refines the calculator further, in particular the level of additional population generated by new development. This research concluded that in Stockton-on-Tees Borough it is appropriate to use a figure of 0.76 additional people per dwelling instead of the 2.40 'average occupancy rate' figure identified in the original calculator. Natural England have now released version 2.2 of the calculator which can be requested by emailing planningdevelopmentservices@stockton.gov.uk or via the Darlington Borough Council website."
