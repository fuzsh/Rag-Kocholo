        "text": "Unitary authority area in County Durham, England\n\nUnitary authority area and borough in England\n\nThe Borough of Darlington is a local government district with borough status in County Durham, England. Since 1997 Darlington Borough Council has been a unitary authority, being a district council which also performs the functions of a county council; it is independent from Durham County Council. It is named after its largest settlement, the town of Darlington, where the council is based. The borough also includes a rural area surrounding the town which contains several villages. The population of the borough at the 2021 census was 107,800,[5] of which over 86% (93,015) lived in the built-up area of Darlington itself.[6]\n\nSince 2016 the council has been a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority, which has been led by the directly elected Tees Valley Mayor since 2017.\n\nThe neighbouring districts are the County Durham district to the north and west, Stockton-on-Tees to the east and North Yorkshire to the south, the River Tees forming the border for the latter.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town of Darlington was made a municipal borough in 1867. In 1915 it was elevated to become a county borough, taking over county-level functions from Durham County Council.[7]\n\nThe borough was reformed and enlarged on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It absorbed nearly all of the surrounding Darlington Rural District, with the exception of the parish of Great Aycliffe (which covers the town of Newton Aycliffe) which went to Sedgefield district.[8][9] The enlarged borough was also reconstituted as a non-metropolitan district as part of the 1974 reforms, with Durham County Council once more providing county-level services to the town.[10]\n\nThe council was made a unitary authority on 1 April 1997, regaining its independence from the county council. The way this change was implemented was to create a new non-metropolitan county of Darlington covering the same area as the existing borough, but with no separate county council; instead the existing borough council took on county functions, making it a unitary authority.[11] The borough remains part of County Durham for ceremonial purposes, with whom it continues to share certain local services, such as the County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service and Durham Constabulary.[12]\n\nSince 2016 the council has been a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority along with Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton-on-Tees. Unlike Darlington, the other four districts in the combined authority had all been part of the county of Cleveland between 1974 and 1996.[13]\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington Borough Council provides both county-level and district-level services. Parts of the borough are covered by civil parishes, which form a second tier of local government for their areas.[16]\n\nSince 2016 the council has been a member of the Tees Valley Combined Authority.[17]\n\nPolitical control\n\n[edit]\n\nThe council has been under no overall control since 2019. Following the 2023 election a coalition of Labour and the Liberal Democrats formed to run the council, led by Labour councillor Steve Harker.[18]\n\nPolitical control of the council since the 1974 reforms has been as follows:[19]\n\nLower-tier non-metropolitan district\n\nParty in control Years Labour 1974–1976 Conservative 1976–1979 Labour 1979–1987 No overall control 1987–1991 Labour 1991–1997\n\nUnitary authority\n\nParty in control Years Labour 1997–2019 No overall control 2019–present\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe role of mayor is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. An attempt to secure a referendum on having a directly elected mayor in 2006 was unsuccessful.[20]\n\nThe leaders since 1991 have been:[21]\n\nCouncillor Party From To John Williams[22] Labour 1991 8 May 2011 Bill Dixon Labour 19 May 2011 19 Jul 2018 Steve Harker Labour 19 Jul 2018 23 May 2019 Heather Scott Conservative 23 May 2019 19 May 2022 Jonathan Dulston Conservative 19 May 2022 25 May 2023 Steve Harker Labour 25 May 2023\n\nComposition\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance up to May 2024, the composition of the council was:[23][24][25]\n\nParty Councillors Labour 24 Conservative 13 Green 7 Liberal Democrats 3 Independent 3 Total 50\n\nThe next election is due in 2027.\n\nElections\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Darlington Borough Council elections\n\nSince the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 50 councillors, representing 20 wards, each of which elects two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.[26]\n\nPremises\n\n[edit]\n\nThe council is based at Darlington Town Hall on Feethams in the centre of Darlington.[27] The building was purpose-built for the old county borough council and was completed in 1970.[28]\n\nSettlements\n\n[edit]\n\nAs well as Darlington itself the borough includes the surrounding villages of:\n\nArchdeacon Newton\n\nBarmpton\n\nBeaumont Hill\n\nBishopton\n\nBlackwell\n\nBrafferton\n\nCoatham Mundeville\n\nDenton\n\nGreat Burdon\n\nGreat Stainton\n\nHeighington\n\nHigh Coniscliffe\n\nHoughton\n\nHoughton Bank\n\nHoughton-le-Side\n\nHurworth\n\nHurworth-on-Tees\n\nHurworth Place\n\nNeasham\n\nKillerby\n\nLittle Stainton\n\nLow Dinsdale\n\nNear airport\n\nMiddleton One Row\n\nMiddleton St George\n\nOak Tree\n\nPiercebridge\n\nRedworth\n\nSadberge\n\nSummerhouse\n\nWalworth\n\nWalworth\n\nWalworth Gate\n\nIt is home to Teesside International Airport (previously known as Durham Tees Valley Airport).\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Demographics of Tees Valley\n\nFreedom of the Borough\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Darlington.\n\nIndividuals\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Williams: 24 November 2011.\n\nAlasdair MacConachie: 24 November 2011.[29]\n\nMilitary Units\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Light Infantry: 1996.\n\nThe Rifles: 17 September 2010.[30]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nDarlington Borough Council\n\nDarlington Tourist Information\n\nDarlington Railway Centre & Museum\n\nDarlington Arts Centre & Civic Theatre\n\nVideo clips\n\n[edit]"
