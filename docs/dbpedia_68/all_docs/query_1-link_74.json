        "text": "Wednesday, 7 August 2024 The Australian Council for International Development and Sudanese diaspora organisations urgently call on the Australian Government to respond to the recent declaration of famine in Darfur, Sudan, by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\n\nWhilst we welcomed previous announcements of funding in relation to this crisis, this declaration of famine demands immediate attention and resourcing to scale up the work of humanitarian organisations providing lifesaving assistance on the ground.\n\nWhere famine is declared, starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition are or will likely be evident.\n\nThe IPC has found that famine conditions are occurring in the Zamzam Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp, which hosts approximately 500,000 IDPs outside of El Fasher town in Darfur. The declaration marks a catastrophic escalation in the ongoing humanitarian crisis that has already displaced millions and left countless others struggling to survive.\n\nAustralian NGOs are on the ground and are ready to scale-up their critical relief operations with further resourcing.\n\nQuotes attributable to Naomi Brooks, ACFID Humanitarian Advisor:\n\n\"The United Nations has confirmed that the situation in Darfur has reached famine levels, with widespread food shortages, severe malnutrition, and an unprecedented humanitarian emergency.\n\n\"The Australian Government should urgently consider further funding for Sudan, in light of the declaration of famine in parts of Darfur.\"\n\n\"ACFID continues to reiterate that the parties to the conflict must ensure that all humanitarian staff, facilities and supplies are protected from attacks. Humanitarian actors must be able to carry out their work, unimpeded.\"\n\n\"If conflict persists and humanitarian access remains blocked, famine conditions will only deteriorate and extend further.\"\n\nQuotes attributable to Amad Mohamed, Sudanese Australian Advocacy Network (SAAN):\n\n\"SAAN is deeply concerned about the worsening crisis and hunger in Darfur. The region is suffering from violence, displacement, and severe shortages of food, clean water, and medical care. Hundreds of thousands of families are struggling to survive.\n\n\"The silence and inaction of the international community are heartbreaking, especially as famine threatens to devastate the region.\n\n\"The people of Darfur cannot endure another genocide in a generation. Without immediate action, countless lives will be lost to hunger and suffering.\n\n\"We urgently call on the international community, humanitarian organisations, and all stakeholders to step up and protect civilians, deliver essential aid, and prevent a catastrophic famine. The Australian government and global partners must act now to help Darfur.\n\nQuotes attributable to Ayoub Zaid, President of Darfur Advocacy Australia:\n\n\"Darfur is experiencing an indescribable humanitarian crisis, with people urgently needing attention as they face war, displacement, and famine.\n\nThe dire conditions within the dispersed displacement camps exacerbate the suffering of the displaced, particularly vulnerable groups such as women and children, who face severe shortages of essential supplies like food, water, and healthcare.\n\nThis alarming situation is a precursor to an unprecedented catastrophe, with famine threatening to decimate a significant portion of Darfur's population.\n\nImmediate intervention from the international community, including Australia, is crucial to provide the necessary aid and prevent an impending humanitarian disaster.\"\n\nACFID is committed to supporting emergency humanitarian efforts and advocating for long-term solutions to the crisis in Darfur.\n\nAustralian humanitarian NGOs responding to the crisis in Sudan can be found at the ACFID appeals page here.\n\n/Public Release.
