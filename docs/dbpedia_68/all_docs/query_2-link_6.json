        "text": "Using this website\n\nThis accessibility statement covers https://www.darlingtonhippodrome.co.uk/. This website is run by Darlington Borough Council. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:\n\nchange colours, contrast levels and fonts\n\nzoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen\n\nnavigate most of the website using just a keyboard\n\nnavigate most of the website using speech recognition software\n\nlisten to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)\n\nAbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.\n\nHow accessible this website is\n\nMost of this website is compliant with the W3C WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility standard. However, there are some parts of this website that are not fully accessible:\n\nmost of our older pdf documents\n\nThe Google ReCAPTCHA error box doesn't have an accessible label\n\nFeedback and contact information\n\nIf you find any problems not listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: mydarlington@darlington.gov.uk.\n\nIf you need information on this website in a different format like accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille:\n\nemail mydarlington@darlington.gov.uk\n\nWe’ll consider your request and get back to you in 7 days.\n\nEnforcement procedure\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).\n\nTechnical information about this website’s accessibility\n\nDarlington Borough Council is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.\n\nCompliance status\n\nThe website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.\n\nThis website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 [external link] AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.\n\nNon accessible content\n\nThe content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.\n\nNon compliance with the accessibility regulations\n\nThe Google ReCAPTCHA error box doesn't have an accessible label\n\nThe ReCAPTCHA error message on the blog pages has a textbox that doesn't have a readable label. This doesn't conform to WCAG 2.1: Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value. This is an external plugin that we have no control over so there is no target fix date set for this at present.\n\nDuplicate ID's on the News letter sign up page\n\nThe News letter signup form that appears in the footer of every page also appears on a dedicated sign up page. As its the same form there are duplicate IDs on the page. This doesn't conform to WCAG 2.1: Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.1: Parsing.\n\nContent that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations\n\nPDFs and other documents\n\nSome of older PDFs and Word documents don’t meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).\n\nSome of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By September 2024, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.\n\nThe accessibility regulations don’t require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they’re not essential to providing our services. Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.\n\nWhat we are doing to improve accessibility\n\nOur accessibility road map below shows how we aim to improve accessibility across this website.\n\nIssue Target Fix Date 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value None set 4.1.1 Parsing None set\n\nPreparation of this accessibility statement\n\nThis statement was prepared on 08/10/2019. It was last reviewed on 10/07/2024 and is updated monthly.\n\nThis website is tested every 7 days against the WCAG 2.2 AA standard."
