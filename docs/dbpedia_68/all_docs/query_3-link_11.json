It is different to your house address and although we can determine a rough geographic location from it, we cannot use it to identify you personally.\n\nWe use the IP address to identify individual computers.

If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. We ask that you check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.\n\nThe Internal Market Information System (IMI)\n\nThe IMI is a piece of software developed by the European Commission to make sharing information between ‘competent authorities’ in European Union (EU) member states easier. Competent authorities are local, regional or national bodies that have responsibility for implementing certain aspects of the law.\n\nWe will only share information that you provide to in very limited circumstances, for example, if you apply to set up a business in another EU member state and they need us to check certain details about your trading history."
