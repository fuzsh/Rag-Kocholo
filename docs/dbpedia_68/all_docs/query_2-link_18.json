        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. When can I apply for a Older Person's Bus Pass?\n\nThe age eligibility is the same as a woman's pensionable age for both men and women. Visit the Gov.uk website to find out when you will be eligible. You can also check your age eligibility by using the State Pension Calculator. Age of eligibility is gradually changing from 60 to 66. You can apply for your bus pass 28 days in advance of your eligibility date.\n\n2. How long is my bus pass valid for?\n\nThe expiry date can be found on the bus pass and is dependent on the evidence submitted. However, most passes are valid for a maximum of 5 years.\n\n3. How long will it take to get my bus pass?\n\nThe pass will be posted to you. If your application is successful, then new cards should be received within 7 working days. If you applied in the 28 days before you are eligible it may take longer but we will aim for your pass to be with you for once you become eligible. If there is a problem with your application we will send you an email to the address registered to your account.\n\n4. I am moving house do I need to change my bus pass?\n\nIf you are moving out of the local authority area you should return your bus pass to the address printed on the reverse with a note explaining why it has been returned. You should re-apply to the local authority you are moving to.\n\n5. Where and when can I use my pass?\n\nYou can use your pass anywhere in England but not Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nThe statutory times of use are 9.30am - 11pm Monday to Friday and at all times at weekends and public holidays.\n\n6. I am having problems logging in, what account should I use?\n\nThe concessionary pass system is a separate online system from other Darlington Borough Council systems (e.g. Council Tax, Green Waste etc.). If you have never had a bus pass before, you will need to register for an online account and apply for one.\n\n7. What if I share an email address with another pass holder such as my husband/wife/partner?\n\nFor data security reasons and to reduce the risk of fraud, it is not possible to create more than one bus pass account with the same email address. If you share an email address with someone who has already created an account you can either:\n\nUse a different email address to set up an account\n\nContact the concessionary travel team\n\n8. How long does my password have to be?\n\nYour password should contain at least 8 characters and combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.\n\n9. How do I renew a pass that has expired or is due to expire in the next 28 days?\n\nIf you have a pass that has already expired, or is due to expire in the next 28 days, you will need to set up an account using a renewal code. You can look up your renewal code using the lookup on the 'Login Or Register' page.\n\n10.
