        "text": "The objective was to address the local issue with Illegal tobacco sales by educating the community on the effects of purchasing it and the links to organised crime.\n\nUsing handpicked Adshel sites for a 24 hour presence in key locations, weekend displays on Adshel Live in the town centre and Geo Locate mobile ads in selected postcode areas, this campaign successfully engaged with their core audience.\n\nThe creative message was designed by the students at Darlington College, featuring links to the reporting webpage, making it easy for the Darlington community to provide info.\n\n\"I received reports, via our online reporting form, about the sale of illegal tobacco which I believe were as a direct result of the campaign. The benefits of the campaign were magnified as we were able to use the bus shelter advertising in local press releases, in our local One Darlington magazine and social media posts.\""
