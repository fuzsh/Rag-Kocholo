Glossary and National Contacts\n\nThe manual is accessed by readers who may find terms that they are not familiar with. Therefore, a glossary of definitions is available under the resource tab.\n\nThere is also a National Contacts resource populated with details of key national agencies and organisations likely to be relevant to procedures user.\n\n5. Regulatory Compliance\n\nEvery effort has been taken to ensure regulatory compliance. If you discover any errors or omissions, please alert your manager.\n\nWe recommend that you register with us to automatically receive notification when this manual is updated, and to receive a monthly newsletter containing articles which may be of interest.

Content printed or downloaded may not be sold, licensed, transferred, copied or reproduced in whole or in part in any manner or in or on any media to any person without the prior written consent of tri.x and Darlington Borough Council.\n\n8. Accessibility\n\nThis website aims to achieve Double-A conformance to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines in accordance with government guidelines. In order to change font size or manual colour use the highlighted 'Accessibility' button at the top right hand corner of any page.\n\nWe have also taken steps to ensure that our site configuration supports the accessibility features of the recommended browsers (see below).\n\nEach browser has different functions, and there is guidance available online about how to use these functions:\n\nClick here to read guidance on accessibility features for Internet Explorer 11\n\nClick here to read guidance on accessibility features for Microsoft Edge\n\nClick here to read guidance on accessibility features for Google Chrome\n\nClick here to read guidance on accessibility features for Mozilla Firefox\n\nClick here to read guidance on accessibility features for Apple Safari\n\n9. Printing and Retaining Copies\n\nThe Manual is intended to be viewed on line to ensure only the most up-to-date version of procedures are being used. However there will be times when hardcopies of chapters will need to be printed, the printer icon at the top right of every page will link to the printer setup page.\n\n10. Browser Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended that this manual is viewed with the latest browsers, with Java Script and cookies enabled for maximum compatibility and functionality.\n\nRecommended browsers are:\n\nInternet Explorer 11 (Windows 7, 8 and 8.1);\n\nMicrosoft Edge (Windows 10);\n\nGoogle Chrome;\n\nMozilla Firefox;\n\nApple Safari.\n\nIt may sometimes be necessary to force your internet browser to refresh. This is because when you visit a website, data from that site is stored on your computer. This is called \"cache\" and it helps the website to load faster the next time you visit it by loading data from your computer instead of from the site's server. Normally this won't cause any issues, but occasionally (when the manual has just been updated for example) you may want to force the website to send you new data. By modifying the basic Refresh command, you can force the website to send you fresh data. For most browsers pressing Ctrl + F5 will force a refresh, instructions for all browsers are readily available on the internet.\n\n11. Mobile/Tablet Compatibility\n\nThis manual has been tested on a variety of mobile devices to ensure that it displays correctly. If you are using an older mobile device it is possible that the manual will not display correctly.\n\nIf you would like the text to be larger, resize the text under the accessibility options, alternatively if you would also like the buttons and the rest of the layout to be enlarged you can use the zoom function within your browser.\n\nThe majority of devices have the functionality to allow a shortcut to be downloaded to the homescreen by loading the site using the 'url' and using the upload function and tapping 'Add to Home Screen'. The functionality may vary between devices, please refer to the manufacturer's instructions."
