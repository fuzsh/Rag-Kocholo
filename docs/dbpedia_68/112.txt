Dear Darlington Borough Council,

Hi.

I was looking on http://www.rowmaps.com/

This lists all the authorities that have digitally published their PROW maps. from that I have deduced that you have NOT.

I make this request under FOI, EIR or Inspire regulations published on the ICO website.

I would like to request the following information BUT not the data itself

1. where and how does your authority hold its public rights of way, indicate any that are used, and what that system is.

In Paper form,

In a GIS system,

In a Asset management / Highways system,

In the authorities LSG.

2. Is your data available readily to the public as opendata and published either on your own website or on data.gov.uk, if so what is its URL.

3. Have you published this on your website as an interactive map, if so what is its URL.

4. If a request was made to release it, would you release it

Yours faithfully,

Chubby Rambler
