        "text": "On July 5, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue was recognized by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation as the “Birthplace of Hip-Hop.”\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime.\n\nSee all of our newsletters\n\nThe tenants and supporters of the affordable housing development in the Bronx are now hoping that the recognition will help them avoid being booted from their homes.\n\nIn February, word came that the owner of the high-rise was looking into selling the property so that the units could be converted to market-rate apartments.\n\nThis morning, elected officials, including Senator Charles Schumer and Congressman Jose Serrano, along with musicians and tenants, planned to congregate at the historic address to lobby for the preservation of the affordable housing complex.\n\nThe full press release from the Save 1520 Sedgwick Ave. Coalition is below.\n\nTenants, Musicians & Elected Officials Celebrate Birthplace of Hip-Hop;\n\nDecry Pending Loss of Affordable Housing\n\nBronx, NY- On Monday July 23, 9:30 AM, at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Senator\n\nCharles Schumer, Congressman Jose Serrano and other elected officials\n\nwill join tenants, musicians, and historians to celebrate NY State's formal\n\nrecognition of 1520 Sedgwick Ave. as the official birth place of Hip Hop\n\nand push for the property's preservation as affordable Mitchell-Lama\n\nhousing.\n\nOn July 5, 2007, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation determined 1520 Sedgwick Ave. eligible for the State and\n\nNational Register of Historic Places (see attached), the first site in\n\nthe nation to receive this recognition based upon its connection to the\n\nhistory of hip-hop.\n\nAlthough the building is under 50 years old, a criterion that landmarks\n\nusually have to meet, 1520 Sedgwick Ave. was determined to be of\n\n\"exceptional importance\" and joined the ranks of sites such as the\n\nStatue of Liberty and the Empire State Building in achieving such recognition.\n\nAdditionally, 1520 is also eligible for the high honor of National\n\nHistoric Landmark.\n\nThe State's determination letter credits DJ Kool Herc as the music\n\ngenre's founder. Herc lived in the building in the seventies where he and his\n\nsister Cindy Campbell held a series of public parties in the community room.\n\nHis music style evolved into what is now considered hip hop; today the genre\n\nis recognized as an American art-form of global significance. \"Who would\n\nhave thought that a place like 1520 Sedgwick Ave, our own little Bethlehem,\n\nwould become the birthplace of hip hop and would make history,\" said DJ Kool\n\nHerc.\n\n\"It's so important that the incredible history of 1520 Sedgwick and all\n\nit represents is being recognized,\" said historic preservationist Andrew\n\nBerman, who assisted with the landmark application. \"History is made\n\nnot just by the rich and powerful, but by poor and working-class and\n\nmarginalized people, for whom the challenges they face can become the\n\ninspiration for transforming the world around them. There is no better\n\nexample than 1520 Sedgwick, where the musical innovation and ingenuity\n\nof DJ Cool Herc and the people around him spawned a cultural movement which\n\ntransformed, and is still transforming, the world.\"\n\nHowever, 1520 Sedgwick Ave. is under threat. In February 2007, tenants\n\nreceived notice of the owner's intent to buy-out of the Mitchell-Lama\n\nprogram and covert the property to market rate. Tenants fear that as the\n\nmarket changes around them, they will be pressured to leave the building\n\nto make room for tenants who can pay higher rents. \"How do I explain to my\n\nchildren that our landlord's greed is more important than the stability\n\nof the only place they've ever called home,\" said tenant Robin Gouldborne.\n\nOver the last several years, more than 40,000 units have been lost due\n\nto Mitchell Lama buy-outs in New York City. Another 39,000 units are still\n\nat risk- including the 100 units that comprise 1520 Sedgwick. The nonprofit\n\nhousing organizations NY State Tenants & Neighbors and the Urban\n\nHomesteading Assistance Board have partnered with tenants to form the\n\n\"Save 1520 Sedgwick Ave. Coalition,\" which is calling on Mayor Bloomberg to\n\nissue a moratorium on buy-outs of all city-funded Mitchell-Lamas until an\n\neffective preservation strategy has been identified and implemented.\n\n\"Today's event is one of the first events to celebrate centrality of the\n\nBronx to the birth of hip hop,\" Congressman Serrano said. \"Those who\n\nwere here at the beginning, in this building, on this block, in this\n\ncommunity, and who remained here through the fires, the crack wars, and the near\n\ndestruction of these neighborhoods are also recognized today for their\n\nperseverance and their steadfast belief that a better day was coming.\n\nNow that this day has arrived, we need to redouble our efforts to ensure\n\nthat they can remain here and that 1520 Sedgwick will always be a place of\n\naffordability where our next generation of young artists, MC's, DJ's and\n\ndancers can be nurtured.\"\n\n###"
