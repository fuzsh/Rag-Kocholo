        "text": "Psychotherapy and psychoanalysis can be instrumental in enhancing your self esteem, quieting depressive thoughts, unlocking your creativity, improving your relationships and helping you lead a happier, more fulfilling life. I lean toward a self-psychological approach that centers on mutuality, self inquiry and empathic encounter. I work with clients from all walks of life, including academics, artists, writers, executives, couples, people going through important life transitions, and people of different faiths, be it buddhist, christian or secular-spiritual. I also work with children. One of my specialties is giftedness, at any age.\n\nMy psychoanalytic writing has been published in several peer reviewed journals, and in a co-authored book released by Oxford University Press. I am on the faculty at The National Institute for the Psychotherapies and the Training Institute for Mental Health in NYC. I bring to the work my own background as artist, writer, teacher and scholar.\n\nI value a holistic approach that works with each client as a multifaceted person seeking wholeness. It takes courage to get here. I look forward to connecting with you and sharing in your journey.\n\nGroup for Dream analysis\n\nHosted by\n\nDeborah Cher\n\nThis is a therapy group that works with dreams and dreaming as a pathway to self discovery and healing. If interested please get in touch. I offer the group both online and in person."
