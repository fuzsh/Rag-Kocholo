If you have a heartbreak or a sickness, for 90 minutes I can make you forget.\n\nOn not being as extroverted as people might think in \"Cher at 74: 'There are 20-year-old girls who can’t do what I do’\" in The Guardian (2020 Dec 14)\n\nQuotations about Cher\n\n[edit]\n\nMusic industry\n\n[edit]\n\nBeyoncé: \"I love that in the seventies Cher and Diana Ross looked like superstars and never played it safe. When they were onstage, they gave you drama—and I love drama.\" [2]\n\nChristina Aguilera:\n\n\"I have always had tremendous respect for her. She is a woman who did everything before anyone else did it. She is an icon and she inspired me through some of my career. We've had similar costumes too!\" [3]\n\n[Describing her first meeting with Cher] I went in for a dance rehearsal on the Sony lot. I had sweat pants on and my little flat shoes, and my son on my hip. The studio head came up to me and said, 'Oh, you've got to meet Cher.' She was on another soundstage rehearsing for her Vegas show. I told him I wasn’t dressed to meet Cher. I needed high heels. I needed to feel good about myself to meet Cher.\" [4]\n\n\"I had told the studio head to stalk and beg Cher to do the movie [Burlesque]. I told him to tell her that I was such a big fan that I would drink her bath water if she did the movie. So, when we were introduced, I said: 'Yes, I'm the one who wants to drink your bath water.'\" [5]\n\n\"Cher and I had more personal talks about love and relationships. She has been through the gamut of marriages and divorces, and I consider her a wise woman. She's someone I look to as a mentor, both personally and professionally.\" [6]\n\nGwen Stefani: \"[Cher] proved there's nothing she cannot do. She's a role model for showing us how to be strong and true to ourselves [and] a woman who is truly the definition of the word Icon.\" [1]\n\nLady Gaga: \"[On the outfit Cher wears in the music video for the song \"If I Could Turn Back Time\"] I dress like that! That's my everyday look. Maybe just sort of subliminally when I was younger, without even realizing it, one day I knew that [Cher] was the kind of woman I would become.\" [7]\n\nPink: \"[On writing for Cher's Closer to the Truth album] It's such an honor. I finally feel like a songwriter. And I'm such a fan.\" [8]\n\nTori Amos: \"Cher has been able to show people that as she ages, she’s still sexy and sensual.\" [9]\n\nFilm industry\n\n[edit]\n\nDrew Barrymore: \"She’s strong and comedic and incredibly brave, but shows vulnerability. I think she’s the epitome of rock & roll.\" [10]\n\nWhoopi Goldberg: \"Elvis. Sinatra. Cher. There have been a handful of entertainers who are instantly recognizable by just one name. She not only marches to the beat of her own drum honey, she is a one woman band. In a word — she’s Cher.\" [11]\n\nSarah Paulson: \"I smelt Cher. I smelt the back of Cher’s head ... Because I really love Cher; I think a lot of people love her for her music which I do, but I think she’s one of the great actresses, I really do. So I was in her presence and I really wanted to go up to her but I was too nervous, so instead I went to the back of her and sort of pushed my nose between her hairs, parted it, and just hung out there for the count of, 'One-one thousand, two-one thousand'. She was about to turn around so I jumped and went back.\" [12]\n\nFashion industry\n\n[edit]\n\nMarc Jacobs: \"[Working with Cher] has been a dream of mine for a very, very long time. [Growing up,] other boys were out fascinated by other things, [but] I was like, no, I'd really much rather see what Cher's wearing this week.\" [13]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
