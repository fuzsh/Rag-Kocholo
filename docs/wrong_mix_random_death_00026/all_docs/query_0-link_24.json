        "text": "A multi-faceted personality with an impressive career spanning over six decades, Cher rose from humble beginnings to become a global superstar. She was born as Cherilyn Sarkisian on May 20, 1946, in El Centro, California. Her early life was marked by financial struggles and frequent moves, but these hardships did not deter her from pursuing her dreams. Cher ventured into the entertainment industry in the 1960s as a backup singer before hitting the limelight as one-half of the folk-rock husband-wife duo Sonny & Cher. Cher's music career is characterized by a series of reinventions that kept her relevant across different generations. While the 70s saw her transition from folk-rock to pop with hits like \"Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves\", the 80s witnessed a shift towards rock music. In the 90s, Cher made another successful transition, this time to dance-pop. Her song \"Believe\" became a massive hit and is credited for popularizing the use of Auto-Tune in music. Cher's versatility is not limited to music alone. She has also demonstrated commendable acting skills, winning an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the film Moonstruck. In addition to her professional achievements, Cher's personal life and style have also been subjects of public fascination. Known for her distinctive contralto voice and flamboyant fashion choices, Cher has often been referred to as the 'Goddess of Pop'. Her romantic relationships, most notably with Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman, have made headlines, as has her advocacy for various causes, including LGBT rights and HIV/AIDS research.\n\nJames Stewart, also known by the stage name Jimmy Stewart, was an influential figure in the world of Hollywood, with an acting career that spanned over 50 years. Born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Stewart's humble beginnings were far from the glitz and glamor of Tinseltown. He graduated from Princeton University in 1932 with a degree in architecture but soon found his passion lay elsewhere. After joining the University Players, a summer stock theater group, he made his way to Broadway before eventually landing in Hollywood. Stewart's acting prowess shone brightly, and he quickly established himself as one of the most reliable and versatile actors of his generation. His filmography is a testament to his range, encompassing a wide variety of genres from romantic comedies to gripping thrillers. His role in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) earned him his first Academy Award nomination, but it was his performance in The Philadelphia Story (1940) that clinched the award for Best Actor. However, perhaps his most iconic role was that of George Bailey in Frank Capra's timeless classic, It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Beyond his illustrious acting career, Stewart was notable for his service during World War II. In 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, where he flew numerous combat missions and rose to the rank of Brigadier General. This commitment to his country, combined with his talent and charm on screen, cemented his place as a beloved figure in American culture. Despite passing away on July 2, 1997, James Stewart's legacy continues to live on, his exceptional body of work serving as a beacon for future generations of actors and filmmakers.\n\nJack Gleeson, an Irish actor, was born in Cork, Ireland on May 20, 1992. Known primarily for his noteworthy performance in HBO's Game of Thrones, Gleeson's acting career began at a tender age. His journey to stardom started with minor roles in films like Batman Begins and Shrooms. However, it was his portrayal of the detestable King Joffrey Baratheon in the critically acclaimed series Game of Thrones that truly put him on the global stage. Gleeson's performance as King Joffrey has been widely recognized and applauded. He masterfully brought to life one of the most reviled characters in television history, earning him a nomination for a Young Artist Award. Despite the character's malevolence, Gleeson's portrayal made him a household name in the entertainment industry. However, upon the conclusion of his role in Game of Thrones, Gleeson announced his retirement from acting to focus on his academic pursuits, displaying a unique commitment to personal growth rarely found in the industry. In addition to his acting career, Gleeson is also known for his academic achievements. He attended Trinity College Dublin, where he studied Philosophy and Theology. He also co-founded Collapsing Horse Theatre Company in Dublin, showcasing his love for theatre and performance art. Despite his decision to step away from the film industry, Jack Gleeson left a lasting impression with his compelling performance in Game of Thrones, forever cementing his place in television history.\n\nTimothy Olyphant, a notable figure in the Hollywood landscape, has cemented his place in the entertainment industry with an intriguing mixture of charisma and immense talent. Born on May 20, 1968, in Honolulu, Hawaii, he spent most of his childhood in Modesto, California. He attended the University of Southern California where he studied fine art and was a competitive swimmer. His transition to acting began post-graduation when he took a leap of faith and started training at New York's renowned William Esper Studio. Olyphant's acting career is an illustrious tapestry that extends across television, film, and stage performances. He first gained recognition for his role in Scream 2 in 1997, which set the course for a thriving career in both mainstream and independent cinema. His remarkable portrayal of Sheriff Seth Bullock in the HBO series Deadwood, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens in FX's Justified, earned him critical acclaim and showcased his versatility as an actor. His nuanced performances have secured him roles in a variety of genres; from action-filled dramas to lighthearted comedies such as The Santa Clarita Diet. Aside from his acting prowess, Olyphant is also recognized for his voice-over work. Notably, he lent his voice to the character of Spirit in the animated movie Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and more recently, to characters in video games like Hitman. In addition to his on-screen accomplishments, Olyphant has also made significant contributions to the theatrical world with performances in off-Broadway productions, including The Monogamist, which earned him the Theatre World Award for Outstanding Debut Performance. Despite his commanding presence on screen and stage, Olyphant maintains a modest and grounded persona, attributing his success to hard work, determination, and a love for his craft.\n\nBorn as Trevor George Smith Jr. on May 20, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York, Busta Rhymes is a distinguished figure in the world of hip hop. Raised by Jamaican immigrant parents, his unique blend of reggae and hip hop roots took the music world by storm. Recognized for his intricate rapping technique, often delivering verses at breakneck speed, Rhymes quickly established himself as an artist with a knack for complex lyricism and a dynamic stage presence. His love for music was nurtured during his time at Uniondale High School, where he, along with fellow students, formed a rap crew named 'Public Enemy'. Rhymes's career trajectory skyrocketed when he joined Leaders of the New School, a hip-hop group that introduced him to the mainstream music industry. The group's debut album, A Future Without a Past, gained critical acclaim and set the stage for Rhymes's eventual solo career. His debut solo album, The Coming, released in 1996, was a commercial success, featuring the hit single \"Woo Hah!! Got You All In Check.\" Over the years, Busta Rhymes has released nine studio albums, each showcasing his innovative style and lyrical prowess. Apart from his flourishing music career, Rhymes has also made a mark in the film and television industry. His acting credits include roles in films like Higher Learning and Shaft, and appearances on TV shows such as The Boondocks and The Wayans Bros. Despite encountering legal issues and controversies throughout his career, Rhymes's influence on the hip-hop genre remains undeniable. His contributions to the music industry have earned him several awards, including a Grammy nomination, solidifying his status as one of hip hop's most distinctive voices."
