        "text": "Stacey Lauretta Dash (born January 20, 1967) is an American actress. She has appeared in the films Moving, Mo' Money, Renaissance Man, and View from the Top. Other television work by Dash includes appearances in the series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, Single Ladies and the reality TV show Celebrity Circus. She portrayed Dionne in the 1995 feature film Clueless and its television series of the same name from 1996 until 1999.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in the Bronx borough of New York City, Dash is of African-American and Mexican descent. She is the daughter of Dennis Dash and Linda Dash (n√©e Lopez; d. 2017). Dash has a stepfather, Cecil Holmes, and a younger brother, Darien Dash, who is the founder of DME Interactive, the first publicly traded African American-led website company. Her first cousin is Damon Dash, the former CEO and co-founder of Roc-A-Fella Records. Dash attended Paramus High School, graduating in 1985.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships and children\n\nDash has two children. She has a son named Austin, born from her relationship with singer Christopher Williams. She married producer Brian Lovell on July 16, 1999, and they divorced in the mid-2000s. From 2005 to 2006, Dash was married to British executive James Maby, CEO of Sports Logistics. Different sources say the father of Dash's daughter Lola is either Lovell or Maby. Dash married actor Emmanuel Xeureb in either 2007 or 2009. She filed for divorce in January 2010 and it was finalized in September 2011. Dash married lawyer Jeffrey Marty on April 6, 2018 in Florida. She said that she met Marty ten days before the wedding. In addition to her two children, Dash is step-mother to three of Marty's children. In April 2020, Dash announced that she and Marty had separated. In June 2020, Dash filed for divorce.\n\nTrauma, drugs, weapons, and legal troubles\n\nDash has spoken openly about past traumas in her personal life. She has at various times revealed that she was molested as a child by a family friend, was addicted to cocaine in her teens and 20s, and has a history of being with physically and emotionally abusive partners. Dash has attributed her openness with such topics to her desire to be honest with her children, feeling that being honest is the best way to protect them, and to let them and others know that she is not a victim but a survivor. She is supportive of the right to keep and bear arms, crediting the use of a gun with saving her life after being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by an ex-boyfriend, because she was able to retrieve her own weapon, a .22 revolver, and shoot at him, scaring him away.\n\nDash was arrested on September 29, 2019, at her apartment in Pasco County, Florida, on a domestic battery charge after an argument with her husband, Jeffrey Marty. She pleaded not guilty, and the case was dropped October 3 at the request of Marty, who said Dash had been arrested over his objection. The couple's divorce was announced the following year.\n\nIn October 2021, Dash opened up about her Vicodin addiction on The Dr. Oz Show, stating that she was five years sober.\n\nReligion\n\nDash was raised Catholic, and claimed the religion in 2012 and 2013.\n\nCredits\n\nStarring\n\nSeason 1 appearances As If a Girl's Reach Should Exceed Her Grasp To Party or Not to Party City Beautification Do We with Bad Haircuts Not Feel?
