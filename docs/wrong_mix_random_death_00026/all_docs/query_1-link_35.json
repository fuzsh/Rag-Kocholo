Selected artists are provided insight into the mechanics of the art world through a comprehensive curriculum addressing the practicalities of sustaining a creative career. AIM Fellows gain candid and in-depth guidance from leading industry insiders on topics such as legal issues in art, effective communication strategies, building competitive funding proposals, and planning for healthy financial futures to help early career artists navigate the complexities of the contemporary art market. Since its founding, the AIM Fellowship has provided pivotal career support to a diverse roster of over 1,200 of New York’s most promising artists.\n\nExhibition Support\n\nBronx Calling: The Fifth AIM Biennial is made possible by Christie’s, Martin Weinstein and Tereza Liszka, Debbie Rechler, Cher Lewis, Friends of AIM, and SRI Fine Art Services.\n\nThe AIM Fellowship program is generously supported by the Jerome Foundation, Pollock-Krasner Foundation, and Miranda Family Fund.\n\nParticipating Artists\n\nEmily Chow Bluck (b.
