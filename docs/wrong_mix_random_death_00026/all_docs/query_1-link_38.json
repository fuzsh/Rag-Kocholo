        "text": "Get ready to turn back time! “The Cher Show,” the Broadway musical portraying the life of movie and music icon, takes audiences back through her illustrious career by way of a trio of stars: Micaela Diamond (“Babe”), Teal Wicks (“Lady”) and Stephanie J. Block (“Star”). With a book by Rick Elice, the Tony Award-nominated writer of the hit jukebox musical “Jersey Boys,” the production is directed Jason Moore, with choreography by Christopher Gattelli.\n\nJoining Cher for the onstage journey are important figures from her life, including costume designer Bob Mackie; her first husband, Sonny Bono; and her parents. In “The Cher Show,” Cher invites audiences into her house to dive into her life and career — including highlights like selling 100 million records, winning the Oscar for “Moonstruck,” and captivating television audiences across the world with “The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.”\n\nRecommended for 12 +. Children under the age of 4 are not permitted in the theatre.\n\nWhat to watch for\n\nBob Mackie, the American designer who has been dressing Cher for years in her elaborate, larger-than-life looks, is designing the costumes for “The Cher Show.”\n\nThough Cher herself won’t be starring in the musical, she has given “The Cher Show” her seal of approval. After seeing the musical in its developmental stages, she tweeted that she sobbed and laughed — and that audiences gave it a standing ovation.\n\nBefore being cast in the titular role, Stephanie J. Block played another music icon on Broadway: Liza Minnelli in “The Boy From Oz.” Minnelli is one of Cher’s longtime friends.\n\nThe show’s producer, Jeffrey Seller, took on the show because Cher holds a special place in his heart. “I loved Sonny and Cher,” Seller explains. “When they got divorced, it felt like there was a divorce in my own family.”"
