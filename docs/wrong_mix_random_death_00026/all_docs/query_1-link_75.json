        "text": "Nestled on the corner of Madison Avenue and 81st Street, you’ll find a museum-worthy boutique that’s now the home of Maria Cher’s second New York City store. “This is a dream come true for a girl like me from Argentina,” María Cherñajovsky (that’s the founder and designer’s full name) excitedly told Vogue over the upbeat music played by Isabella Massenet.\n\nThe walls of the Upper East Side shop were adorned with mirrors that have sinuous edges and slabs of marble, which make for beautiful places to display the brand’s loafers and handbags. The space itself feels like a continuation of the label’s effortless yet striking clothes.\n\n“In my home country, they call me the queen of pants,” says Cherñajovsky. Ruby Aldridge, who was in attendance, certainly agreed. She couldn’t stop singing the designer’s praises while wearing a pair of Maria Cher jeans with an impeccable fit—for her 5’11’ frame, no less.\n\nBut the magic of Cherñajovsky goes beyond her ability to make great clothes. “I think she’s much more than that. She’s an amazing designer and a wonderful entrepreneur,” producer Diego Radivoy explained perfectly while a waiter passed around slices of arugula pizza from Serafina to guests. After twenty years in business, it was about time the Upper East Side got a Maria Cher store."
