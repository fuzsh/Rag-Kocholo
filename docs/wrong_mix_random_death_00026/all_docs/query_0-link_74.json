(Note: several websites naively say Warwick was born in Birmingham, West Midlands, England. The county of West Midlands did not exist until 1974, 34 years after Clint was born, so it is physically impossible for him to have been born in the county of West Midlands and you will never see West Midlands listed as the County of Birth on his official birth certificate. When Warwick was born in 1940, Aston was located in the county of Warwickshire.)\n\n1945: Carly Simon was born in the Bronx, New York.

August 14, 2013 in Manhattan, New York. (Note: the notorious 'Allmusic.com' and other websites naively say Lanier was born on Long Island, New York. Long Island is neither a city nor a county and you will never see Long Island listed on Alan's official birth certificate. For the benefit of those websites, although Long Island is not a city, Queens is, and that is where Lanier was born.)\n\n1952: Tim Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House, was born in Te Awamutu, New Zealand.\n\n1954: David Paich, one of the greatest session musicians of the Rock Era and vocalist, keyboard player, songwriter, arranger and producer with Toto, was born in Los Angeles.\n\n1963: George Michael (Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou) was born in East Finchley, Middlesex, England. (Note: many websites naively say George was born in East Finchley, London. East Finchley did not become a part of the county of London until 1965, two years after Michael was born. In 1963, East Finchley was located in the county of Middlesex, and you will never see London listed as his County of Birth on Geoergios' official birth certificate.)\n\n1972: Mike Kroeger of Nickelback was born in Hannah, Alberta, Canada."
