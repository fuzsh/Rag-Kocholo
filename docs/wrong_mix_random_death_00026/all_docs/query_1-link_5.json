        "text": "Cher, that inexpungible monosyllable, that “born-again success,” has had almost as many decorating periods as she has had professional lives. (She recently returned to the recording studio and became again a figure for teenagers, twenty years after the fact; she also became a leading lady at an age when most actresses are through. “For three decades they've been saying I was on my way out,” she says with a frosty smile.) What does she call this decorating period? “For my New York apartment I wanted prehistoric/futuristic—something that would be one step further than my Egyptian house in Beverly Hills,” answers Cher, a decorator's Muse and Medici.\n\nFor just as she has never been afraid to change her personal look, taking the public through all those different looks with her, so she has dared to dabble in perhaps a dozen decorating idioms. “I don't know where people go to get that rule, ‘Thou shalt be one thing and one thing only for thy entire life,’” she says incredulously.\n\n“I've done all Cher's houses for her, one after another, all eleven,” says Los Angeles designer Ron Wilson. “She stretches me to the limit, and then some. I've tried every trick in the book, used every drapery treatment, every floor material. She's had everything—and she still insists I do something new. The first two things she and I worked on together were an Italian-style house in Bel-Air and a French period house in Holmby Hills. When I met her I was a construction superintendent and she was a young girl living with her family. She was baby-sitting for my nephews. She thought I was a hot guy driving a Corvette! That's how far back we go—to her beginning and almost to my beginning.” These days Ron Wilson can number among his clients Johnny Carson, Michael Landon, Don Rickles and Kenny Rogers. “And Cher, of course. Cher ongoing. Cher forever.”\n\nCher found the apartment herself—three floors in a restored building in the lower reaches of Manhattan, somewhere between SoHo and Greenwich Village. “It was a nice-looking—a typical New York loftlooking—unit,” says Wilson. “Forty-five hundred square feet—a very small space for her.” Cher, being Cher, had flights not of fancy but of fantasy. “And I achieved what she fantasized wanting—something very far beyond what we'd done in the past,” Wilson says with justifiable pride. “It's definitely not a New York look. It's her look and it followed her to New York. It's Cher—Cher through my eyes.” That may well be, but the apartment seems to embrace rather than reflect the star. “It does both,” Wilson insists. “In the past she's said that so much of what I do puts its arms around her. She feels there's a romance about the things we do.”\n\nWhile work on the apartment was in progress, Cher hovered close by, in a midtown hotel. “She enjoyed being in New York watching the changes come about. She's always very involved—she doesn't just say, ‘Here's what I want and call me when you're done,’” Wilson explains. As things turned out, Cher was back in Los Angeles when the apartment, with its all-important finishing touches, was installed. But she would soon be driving cross-country and promised to call Wilson with her reaction the minute she walked in the door. When the apartment hit the star of Moonstruck's eye like a big pizza pie, it was amore. “She called me and she was overwhelmed,” Wilson remembers. “She said, ‘You've done it again!’\n\n“We started from scratch—and with scratch,” he laughs. They put in new beam structures and worked with new materials, they changed baths, they changed fireplaces and they changed kitchens. The kitchen, in fact, was built a few times: It was open to start out with, then Cher changed her mind and wanted it enclosed, then she wanted it opened again. “That's not unusual for her,” Wilson says. “She has a good sense of decoration and construction, and anyway, if she wants it rebuilt it gets rebuilt. There's no convincing her otherwise. She's a very strong Taurus, and I'm smart enough, being a Taurus myself, not to argue with her.” Cher elaborates, “I want to do what I want to do. If I live in a place, I want it to be exactly the way I want it to be when I want it to be that way.”\n\nThe apartment is done in very neutral, almost colorless tones, with here and there a bit of black. And everywhere a great deal of stone. “She likes stone and has for a long time,” Ron Wilson explains. “We've been doing stone together for about ten years.” This time, the walls and ceilings are faux-stone, and the big table in the dining area is two slabs of stone.\n\nEverything in the apartment suggests the tactile. “She's never cared for flat, textureless things. She doesn't like a flat painted wall—she's never understood having a wall just painted white. She wants depth to it. And she only likes form in something that has texture to it—she'd rather have that than have art or something that dominates the area. She doesn't like to have things that dominate the area. She dominates the area.”\n\nIf Cher likes texture, she also likes that texture to have a certain aged quality to it. In her Beverly Hills house, for instance, the walls were combed with a steel rake to give an irregular look and create depth and shadow. In the New York apartment the railings of the three-tiered staircase have been antiqued to give the distressed look of old ironwork.\n\nSince the strength of the apartment stemmed from those faux-stone walls and ceilings, Cher could afford to be quite lighthearted when it came to the furnishings, which, in a witty reversal of design convention, became a background for the background (those walls and ceilings, though subtle, are quite extreme). The furniture throughout the apartment, most of it designed by Wilson, makes for a quiet blend with the free-form wool area rugs on the hardwood floor. No pattern is in evidence anywhere except for stenciled cowhide on the banquette. “We've always had some kind of stenciled fur in all of her houses,” Wilson offers.\n\nCher and Wilson shopped together for all the antique artifacts. The dramatic piece standing near the dining table is a farm implement, a wooden thresher from mid-nineteenth-century France. Other lucky finds were the wood-twisted Philippine columns that frame Cher's bedroom and the two antique Indian stone columns in the living room that Wilson redesigned into lamps. “We depended on the crudeness and the oldness of these items to take the rawness out of the contemporary quality that I was trying to achieve,” Wilson says. It is precisely this blend that gives the place its palpable prehistoric/futuristic air.\n\nAnd now let us tour Cher's lair. To the left of the entry on the first floor of the triplex is a lounge where the children can watch television; behind the lounge are their bedrooms. Chastity, Cher's twenty-year-old daughter by Sonny Bono, has a very white room, with some natural-log furniture. Elijah Blue, her twelve-year-old son by Gregg Allman, has a room in natural colors, too. “The uniqueness of Elijah Blue's room is its deliberately crude bunk-bed system, with the two twin beds designed to look like the branches of trees,” Wilson says. Cher adds, “I liked the fact that the kids could have a whole floor to themselves here.”\n\nThe staircase in the entry hall leads up to the second floor, which is one very large space consisting of living room, dining room and kitchen. At the end of the living room you turn right and mount a couple of hardwood steps to reach Cher's bedroom. “The bedroom is always her favorite room,” Wilson says. A pair of pocket doors, which slide into a Texas shell-stone surround, open to face the living room, allowing Cher a look at that room's Texas shell-stone fireplace. The bedroom is unusually big, with a large sybaritic Roman travertine-marble master bath. The bed, which Wilson designed, is all steel.\n\nAnd, enticingly, it is covered with a spun spiderweb fabric. Why a spiderweb, one might ask? Does Cher like symbols? What do spiders—for that matter, what does her Egyptian house—mean to her? And when she picks a theme, is she even thinking about what it means—or rather, what it looks like? The spiderweb, it turns out, is Ron Wilson's bit of whimsy, not Cher's. “I brought that in. For fun. Cher and I have worked so long together and are such good friends that so much of the decorating is how I see her surrounded, and apparently my perception of her works, because she's very comfortable in the environments I place her in. I saw the material and thought it was wonderful—we weren't looking for a spider. Now, Cher does love snakes, and we have gold snakes tastefully coiled around the top frame of her bed in Beverly Hills.” We already know why Cher is partial to snakes—because they shed their skin the way she does. She once said, “Every year I gather and shed…I feel like a snake because I'm always shedding stuff.”\n\nThe bed coverings are white slipper satin with a lily pattern—the lily is Cher's favorite flower—and inset in each lily is a hand-sewn pearl. “I suggested it; she giggled and thought it was a great idea,” Wilson explains.\n\nThe staircase slithers up one more floor to a glass-walled, glass-roofed, solariumlike room with an adjacent outdoor terrace. This is Cher's exercise room, where she does the aerobic workouts that keep her in shape. “I couldn't get through my life if I didn't exercise,” she says. “It gives me a certain quietness that I can't find anywhere else.”\n\nIn the end, Cher's lair may be surprising to those of us who expected something as flamboyant as her life. “This is not a Bob Mackie apartment,” Wilson emphasizes. “If anything, this is very against her image, as all her homes have been. She's not theatrical in person, and this is a wonderful environment for her to be her comfortable self in. This is who she is when she strips off the peacock feathers. Here, she's at home in her own skin.” In her own peeled skin, Wilson might have added, for now, once again, Cher can be “born again” in a new setting."
