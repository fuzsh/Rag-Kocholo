        "text": "This list of celebrities who started as backup singers is loosely ranked by fame and popularity. Several now-famous musicians started their careers in the entertainment industry as backup singers. A few of these talented singers went on to become some of the biggest pop stars of all time. One famous backup singer, Whitney Houston, is a Grammy-winning musician and Oscar-winning actress.\n\nWho is the most famous person who started as a backup singer? Mariah Carey tops this list. Carey was a backup singer and dancer for Brenda Starr in the late 1980s, which proves that celebrities who were once backup singers can be just as talented as anyone who shot to the top.\n\nAre you surprised that so many superstars started as backup singers?
