        "text": "A penthouse apartment steeped in history and boasting a large A-list roster of former residents is for sale in New York City.\n\nThe historic Silk Building was originally built in 1908 and served as a silk factory before being converted in 1982 into condominium residences that served as the home for many celebrities.\n\nThe 12-story building is situated in the NoHo Neighborhood and dominates a whole block between Broadway and Lafayette.\n\nIn the '80s, Cher was the first to cozy on up in the Silk Building's penthouse not long after its transition into a residential building. Cher called the place home until 1990, when she sold the penthouse to rap mogul Russell Simmons for $1.6 million. Over the years, the apartment also became home to Britney Spears.\n\nThe penthouse features tall ceilings, an outdoor terrace with views over Greenwich Village and the Empire State Building, working fireplaces, an upgraded kitchen, marble bathrooms, and a wet bar in the primary suite.\n\nScroll down to take a look inside:"
