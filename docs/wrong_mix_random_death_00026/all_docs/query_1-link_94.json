        "text": "Amy Schumer has snagged herself a piece of New York cinematic history.\n\nThe comedian and actor fell in love with the legendary home from the 1980s classic Moonstruck that was on the market last month, with reports now confirming she paid USD $1.5 million ($2.1 million) over asking to secure the pad.\n\nSchumer dropped USD $12.5 million ($18 million) on the Brooklyn Heights brownstone, which had an asking price USD $11 million.\n\nREAD MORE: Late Shane Waren's former Brighton home to change hands\n\nThe 1987 film used the exterior of 19 Cranberry Street as the home of the multi-generational Castorini family. The surrounding area also featured prominently in the movie, along with stars Cher, Nicholas Cage and Olympia Dukakis.\n\nWhile the exterior of the 19th-century terrace may inspire scenes of 1980s New York, the four storey, five-bedroom, 3.5-bath home has been beautifully restored inside.\n\nThe home includes a double parlour, antique wooden shutters and floorboards, a library and an excavated wine cellar with laundry and a gym â€” plus much sought-after parking.\n\nThe top-line chef's kitchen boasts a professional wood-burning oven, eight-burner, three-oven custom Lacanche range, Gaggenau appointments, substantial butler's pantry with zinc bar sink, and antique cabinetry sourced from a mansion in Ohio that has been re-engineered with German soft-close hardware.\n\nREAD MORE: Feature that makes Alice Stolz 'feel like a proper grown up'\n\nThe refurbishment made meticulous effort to retain the stately opulence of original features.\n\nOn the exterior there's a completely restored Mansard roof, repointing, restored ironwork and new historic windows.\n\nInside, all new infrastructural systems such as hidden steel beams, steel corseted stairs, restored crown moulding, new and restored antique millwork, original marble fireplace mantles and newly lined flues and rebuilt fireboxes complete the picture,\n\nThe Trainwreck star and her husband Chris Fischer, who three years ago welcomed a boy named Gene, recently listed their modern Upper West Side penthouse for US$15 million ($21.6 million).\n\nSchumer bought the single-level pad, which has verdant rooftop terraces on all sides, in 2016, calling it her \"Manhattan dream apartment,\" according to NY Post."
