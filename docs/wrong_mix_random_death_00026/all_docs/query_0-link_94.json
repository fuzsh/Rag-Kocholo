        "text": "It appears a Fireball may have streaked across the Maine sky Sunday evening and I was lucky enough to see it.\n\nWhere Did You See It?\n\nI was sitting on my couch, when something outside the window caught my eyes from across the room. I looked just in time to see a green light traveling across the sky. It was gone as quickly as it appeared.\n\nI jumped up and ran across to the door, flinging it open. While I stood looking out into the night, at approximately 6:15-6:20, I was waiting for the crash of a plane or the bang that follows fireworks. All I heard was silence.\n\nWhy Do You Think It Was a Fireball?\n\nIt freaked me out, at first. But when I started thinking about it, I realized what it probably was. Then a Facebook friend told me he had read something about a meteor that was supposed to be very visible from Europe on Sunday night. So I went to the online log book of the American Meteor Society to see if anyone had reported a Fireball. Sure enough, one was spotted over France, and several other countries about 10 minutes after I saw it over the U.S. This YouTube video from 6 months ago shows a sighting similar to what I saw.\n\nWhat Is a Fireball?"
