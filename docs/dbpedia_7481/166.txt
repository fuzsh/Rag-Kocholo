Answer

In Mark 13:14–37, Jesus prepares His followers for intense persecution and tribulation in the days ahead and especially during the end times. He gives them hope to endure these trials by describing His glorious return as the conquering King of the universe (verses 24–27). To keep them from despairing in dark times, the Lord wants them to live in readiness for His second coming. âHowever,â Jesus states, âno one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows. And since you donât know when that time will come, be on guard! Stay alert!â (verses 32–33, NLT).

âDayâ and âhourâ are often used in Scripture as references to time in general (see Matthew 7:22; 10:19; 24:42, 44, 50; 25:13; 26:45). But in Mark 13, Jesus focuses on a specific event in the future. Because no one knows the day or the hour of His return, Jesus stresses the need to pay attention, stay awake, and be ready at a momentâs notice. Multiple times in Mark 13, Jesus calls for vigilant watchfulness: âBe on guard! Stay alert!â (verse 33, NLT), âWatch for his returnâ (verses 34, NLT), âYou, too, must keep watch!â (verse 35, NLT), âDonât let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warningâ (verse 36, NLT), and âWatch for him!â (verse 37, NLT).

The disciples wanted to know when the end would come (see Mark 13:3–4). But Jesus told them that even He did not know (verse 33). In saying this, Jesus was actively humbling Himself and taking the form of a servant (see Philippians 2:7–8). Since no other mortal knows the time of Jesusâ return, Jesus voluntarily restricted His knowledge on that point. It was part of Jesusâ submission to the Father (see John 5:30; 6:38; 8:28–29) and His mission to live a human life. Jesus, in His humanity, didnât know the day or hour of His return, nor did the angels in heaven, only God the Father. It is highly probable that Jesus, now in His glorified state, knows the day and hour of His return. But at that incarnate moment, speaking with His disciples, the information was not at Christâs disposal. Later, just before His ascension, Jesus would remind them, âIt is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authorityâ (Acts 1:7). Jesus accepted His human limitations, and so must we. The thing that matters is being ready every day for His return.

Christians of every age have experienced persecution, natural disasters, and earthly trials. Genuine disciples must understand that these challenges are a daily reality of life in a fallen world. Yet, believers are not without hope because, in the end, our victorious King will return for us. In the meantime, since no one knows the day or the hour, we are to watch and be ready for Him no matter what we must endure as we continue His mission of spreading the good news of Godâs kingdom.

Many have tried to predict the day of Christâs return, but Scripture is straightforward—no one knows the day or the hour. Jesus said to stay awake because His coming will be a surprise: âLook, I will come as unexpectedly as a thief! Blessed are all who are watching for me, who keep their clothing ready so they will not have to walk around naked and ashamedâ (Revelation 16:15, NLT; cf. 1 John 2:28).
