        "text": "NOAA/NWS 1925 Tri-State Tornado Web Site--Startling Statistics\n\nOn March 18, 1925, the Great Tri-State Tornado tore across Southeast Missouri, Southern Illinois, and Southwest Indiana. With its rapid movement, monstrous size, and long track, the tornado took hundreds of lives and injured thousands.
