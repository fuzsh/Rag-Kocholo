        "text": "Volunteers in the United States hold up the foundation of civil society. They help their neighbors, serve their communities, and provide their expertise. No matter what kind of volunteer work they do, they are contributing in invaluable ways.\n\nIndependent Sector, with the Do Good Institute at the University of Maryland, announced on April 23, 2024 that the estimate for the value of a volunteer hour was $33.49 in 2023, a 5.3% increase from 2022. Read the full report for national and state-by-state data on the value of volunteer time.\n\nSee State-by-State Data\n\nDownload the Data (Excel)\n\nLearn About the Methodology\n\nDownload Shareable Graphics (ZIP)\n\nHistoric Dollar Value of a Volunteer Hour: 2009-2023\n\nWhy Do We Calculate a Value of Volunteer Time?\n\nPutting a dollar value on volunteer hours will never do justice to their true worth, but it is just one way for us to show the contributions individuals and organizations have made in our communities. The estimate helps acknowledge the millions of individuals who dedicate their time, talents, and energy to making a difference. Charitable organizations frequently use this estimate to quantify the enormous value volunteers provide."
