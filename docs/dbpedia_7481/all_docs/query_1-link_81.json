        "text": "LOUISIANA'S ULTIMATE HAUNTED HOUSE\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about The 13th Gate Haunted House\n\nMidnight Productions does not own any\n\nparking lots and therefore we have no control\n\nover the operation, security, or fees\n\nassociated with parking for this event.\n\n1.Free parking is located UNDER the I-10 River\n\nBridge.

Children must be able to walk on their own, and can not be carried at any point inside of the haunt. Young children who get to the front door and are too scared to enter will not be forced (not even by their well-meaning parents). We do not recommend our attractions for very young children.\n\nYou can skip the ticket booth line but must wait in the haunted house line. To skip all lines, you must purchase VIP tickets.\n\nUp to 15 people may go in a group together.\n\nFor online ticket sales we can accept the following payment methods:\n\nVisa\n\nMasterCard\n\nDiscover\n\nAmerican Express\n\nFor on-site ticket purchases we can accept the following payment methods:\n\nVisa\n\nMasterCard\n\nDiscover\n\nApple Pay\n\nGoogle Pay\n\nWe encourage everyone to visit Carnevil, located safely in our fenced lot across the street next to the ticket booths. Within you will find great food, live entertainment, games, picnic tables, and much more!\n\nOur haunted houses are where your most frightening dreams become reality. As soon as you enter the front door, you will be transported into a realm of terror - a dark twisting maze through rooms populated with creatures from your worst nightmares. Your only goal will be to elude the predators who stalk you through the darkness - to be a survivor, not a victim, of the house.\n\nHey, fear is relative. We do our part by providing hands down some of the scariest haunted attractions in Louisiana. Of course, everyone has their own particular fear threshold. The best answer we can give is that 99% of the people who come out the back door are screaming or laughing. Our repeat customer rate is very high. Conclusion: being scared is fun?\n\nYes, as long as there are customers, we will stay open.\n\nBecause it is not recommended for small children, there is only one general admission price.\n\nWe have a \"no touch\" policy - you don't touch us, we don't touch you. Unfortunately, due to the very dim lighting inside the haunts, you may occasionally come into accidental contact with one of our staff. Our monsters will not grab or maul you.\n\nWe do not recommend the haunted house to anyone who is pregnant.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, listen to WFMF, 102.5FM to win free tickets!\n\nUsually we try to open at 6:30pm. Sometimes we might open later but only if we’re experiencing a technical problem for which we’ll delay the opening to fix the problem.\n\nYes, many people each night are too scared to make it through the house and are let out by our security staff.\n\nNo. You paid us to scare you. If you get scared in the line or in the first few rooms and want to leave, we've done what you paid us to do very quickly. Be happy with prompt service!\n\nGroup rates are available for groups over 20 providing the reservation and rate is approved in advance. Call 225-389-1313 and choose the group discount option to speak with an attendant.\n\nNo. We do not recommend our haunted houses for very young children. If you choose to bring them, they will pay the same price as everyone else. Children who are too young or too scared to enter may wait for their party with the door greeter. You might consider picking up a coupon at one of our participating sponsors if cost is an issue.\n\nDo you see horror movies? Haunted Houses are just like the movies except YOU are in the movie with the ghouls jumping out at you. Yes, you will get scared but in the end it’s all fun and you’ll come out screaming, but you and your friends will laugh about it afterwards. Most everyone enjoys talking about their experience for years telling stories of how high you jumped out of your shoes. Come on down, we’re waiting.\n\nWe have patrons in wheelchairs visit us every year. Anyone wanting to tour the attractions with a handicap needs to let the ticket booth know for any special instructions. A staff member will accompany your group to assist you if you need it. In order to maintain our high safety standards, we do not recommend taking crutches and other such devices into the building. If you must use them, a staff member will accompany your group.\n\nAbsolutely!!! The 13th Gate has a massive indoor queue line to keep people out of the rain. So don’t worry about that at all. The outside portions of The 13th Gate are subject to close due to bad weather. If so, it will be posted at the entrance.\n\nIt takes about 30 minutes to walk through the haunted house if you walk at a normal pace.\n\nOur attractions have a fully trained security staff that keeps things running smoothly. We also have several BR Sheriff Deputies and Fire personal on duty at all times.\n\nYes, but none of them will be in direct contact with you.\n\nPlease see: About 13th Gate\n\nAbsolutely not. The show changes every year, although we do keep some of the more popular scenes. We have a full time professional staff that work all year on the haunted house.\n\nRefer to the above question. (But yes, we think so.)\n\nYes! We sell everything from food to T-shirts to other unique souvenirs. Walk across the street to Carnevil where we keep our merchandise booth as well as our food truck.\n\nNO! Haunted houses are dark and it takes everyone, especially the actors' eyes, to adjust to the low light. When you flash your camera, you’re not only ruining other customers' experience, but you're hurting the actors' eyes. Also, no other recording devices are allowed (video cameras, etc,...).\n\nYou should ask the police on duty this question. Every night (without fail) we have to escort someone (and their group) out of our haunts into the arms of the police. We do not allow foul language, pushing, vulgar behavior, weapons of any kind, alcohol, etc. We have a list of rules just like any other business that must be adhered to for your own safety. Please go through the haunt in a civilized manner and everyone (including yourself) will have a great time.\n\nIf you have questions we didn't answer, e-mail us at info@midnightproduction.com and we will respond as soon as we can. If enough people ask the same question (or we just think it's an incredibly swell question) we will add it to the FAQ list.\n\nCheck out the rest of this website (www.13thGate.com). You can also follow us on FaceBook, Instagram, Twitter, and check out our latest videos on TikTok & YouTube. Additionally, you can Call the Hotline at 225-389-1313 for the latest updates.\n\nWARNING!\n\nDO NOT TOUCH THE ACTORS.
