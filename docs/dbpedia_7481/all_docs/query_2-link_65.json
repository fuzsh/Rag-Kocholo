Learn how much sleep students need and how many are not getting it.\n\nImportance of Sleep\n\nChildren and adolescents who do not get enough sleep have a higher risk of obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor mental health, and problems with attention and behavior.1-4\n\nHow much sleep someone needs depends on their age. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has recommended that children aged 6–12 years should regularly sleep 9–12 hours per 24 hours and teenagers aged 13–18 years should sleep 8–10 hours per 24 hours.1\n\nAre Students Getting Enough Sleep?\n\nCDC analyzed data from the 2015 national and state Youth Risk Behavior Surveys.5 Students were asked how much sleep they usually got on school nights. Students who were 6 to 12 years old and who reported sleeping less than 9 hours were considered to not get enough sleep. Teenagers aged 13 to 18 years who reported sleeping less than 8 hours also were considered to not get enough sleep.\n\nMiddle school students (grades 6-8)\n\nStudents in 9 states were included in the study\n\nAbout 6 out of 10 (57.8%) did not get enough sleep on school nights\n\nHigh school students (grades 9-12)\n\nNational sample\n\nAbout 7 out of 10 (72.7%) did not get enough sleep on school nights\n\nHelp Your Child Get the Sleep They Need\n\nParents can support good sleep habits such as:\n\nSticking to a consistent sleep schedule during the school week and weekends. This means going to bed at the same time each night and getting up at the same time each morning. Adolescents whose parents set bedtimes are more likely to get enough sleep.6 To help decide on a good bedtime for your child, go to the Bedtime Calculator.external icon\n\nLimiting light exposure and technology use in the evenings.\n\nParents can limit when their children may use electronic devices (sometimes referred to as a “media curfew”).\n\nParents can limit where their children may use electronic devices (for example, not in their child’s bedroom).\n\nOther tips for better sleep are available at CDC’s Tips for Better Sleep.\n\nHow much sleep someone needs depends on their age. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has made the following recommendations for children and adolescents1:\n\nRecommended Hours of Sleep Per Day by Age Group Age Group Recommended Hours of Sleep Per Day 6–12 years 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours 13–18 years 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours\n\nReferences"
