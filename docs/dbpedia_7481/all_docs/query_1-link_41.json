        "text": "SOME BASIC RULES\n\nThese rules must be followed at all times:\n\n1) Do not touch any haunt actors, staff, or props at any time.\n\n2) Do not bring any weapons, alcoholic beverages, or pets onto the property.\n\n3) Outside food and drink is prohibited on the grounds.\n\n4) Respect other customers and haunt employees – no rude or lewd behavior, defacing property, etc.\n\n5) No smoking inside the Haunted Experience, in line for admission, or within 15 feet of any structure.\n\n6) No flashlights, cell phones or cell phone lights, lighters, or flash photography inside the Haunted Experience. Photos and videos are allowed in the Courtyard area.\n\n​\n\nPlease wear comfortable shoes as you will be walking outside on various paved and unpaved surfaces. The pathways are gravel and grassy areas and can be uneven at times. You must stay on the marked pathway at all times.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFAQs\n\n​\n\nQ: How long does it take to go through?\n\nA: This is a very hard question to answer as some people walk faster than others. We estimate it to take about 30 minutes to complete.​\n\nQ: What if we walk up on another group?\n\nA: Slow down to maximize your experience and to social distance. You will not get the full effect of the attraction if you get too close to the group ahead of you or if a group walks up on your group. It is easier to see ahead of you so we ask all groups to slow down if you see that you are getting close to the group ahead of you. This way each scene will have a chance to \"reload\" and you and your group will get the best experience possible.\n\nQ: Is The Village wheelchair accessible?\n\nA: Yes, but the pathways may be challenging in some spots due to gravel and uneven terrain. Please let our staff know when you arrive if you require wheelchair assistance.\n\n​\n\nQ: How much does it cost to get in??\n\nA: General Admission is $30 online and $35 at the Box Office. You can purchase a Line Jumper Pass to go to the front of the line during your time slot. The Line Jumper is $20 and does not include admission to the Haunt. Each person wishing to jump the line must have a Line Jumper Pass.\n\n​\n\nQ: Is there a different admission price for children?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: How old do you have to be to get into The Village?\n\nA: We recommend a minimum age of 13, but that is up to you. Many young children have a great time, others will not make it all the way through. Even some adults get too scared to make it through.\n\n​\n\nQ. How scary is The Village?\n\nA: Extremely. Our scares are designed to be very intense from start to finish. We incorporate loud sound effects, strobe lights, fog machines, gory scenes, and terrifying creatures.\n\nIf you are nervous and want to experience a less intense haunt, purchase a \"Chicken Ticket\" at our box office before getting in line. It is a light-up pacifier that you must have in your mouth inside the Haunt. This lets our creatures know to go easy on you as you pass. Maybe.\n\nPlease be aware that there are NO REFUNDS if you or a member of your party are too scared to make it through. EVEN IF you have not started the tour. Once the ticket is purchased there are no refunds.\n\n​\n\nQ: Will The Village close if it rains?\n\nA: No – The Village will operate rain or shine. We will delay or close only in the event of severe thunderstorms, lighting, or damaging wind.\n\n​\n\nQ: I lost my cell phone inside the Haunt - what can I do?\n\nA: As you exit the Haunt, let one of our staff at the Haunt Entrance know what you lost and approximately where you lost it. We will do a sweep through that area to find it. Also check in at our Lost & Found counter located at the Ticket Booth to see if your item was turned in there.\n\n​\n\n​The Village Haunted Experience reserves the right to correct any errors on this site. We also reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.\n\n​\n\nCONTACT US"
