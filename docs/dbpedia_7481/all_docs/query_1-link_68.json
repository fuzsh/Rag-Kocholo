        "text": "The amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun reaching the Earth’s surface, and accordingly the UV index, depends on several factors, the most important of which are time of day and season.\n\nUV radiation is usually strongest for a few hours around noon and less strong during the early morning and the late afternoon/evening (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Daily sun profile.\n\nSource: Courtesy of Ameco Solar at solarexpert.com\n\nIn summer, about 20–30% of the total daily amount of UV radiation is received between 11:00 and 13:00, and 75% between 9:00 and 15:00 (sun time, not local time). Seasonal variations in UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface are substantial in temperate regions but much less nearer to the equator.\n\nOther important factors that influence the strength of UV radiation at the Earth’s surface are:"
