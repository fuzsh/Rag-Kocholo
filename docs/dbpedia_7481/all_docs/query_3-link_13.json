        "text": "What is military time?\n\nMilitary time is a US term used to describe a timekeeping method otherwise known as the 24-hour clock.\n\nThis timekeeping standard is widely used around the world, except in the US and several other countries, such as the following:\n\nCanada\n\nMexico\n\nthe Philippines\n\nEgypt\n\nAustralia\n\nThe use of the 24-hour clock format is also encouraged by ISO 8601 international standards â established with the intention to provide clear and specific ways to communicate date and time.\n\nHow is military time different from standard US time?\n\nThe standard US timekeeping method uses the 12-hour clock.\n\nThis clock splits the day into two blocks of time:\n\nFirst block — starts at midnight (12:00 a.m.) and ends at noon (12:00 p.m.)\n\nSecond block — starts at noon (12:00 p.m.) and ends at midnight (12:00 a.m.)\n\nSo, here are a couple of examples to illustrate the standard format used in the US to show time:\n\n1:00 a.m. — One o’clock after midnight\n\n3:30 PM — Half past three in the afternoon\n\nWe see here that the US standard time uses the abbreviations “a.m.” and “PM” to signify time before noon and time after noon, respectively.\n\nThese abbreviations come from Latin terms:\n\nAnte meridiem (before noon) — AM or a.m.\n\nPost meridiem (after noon) — PM or p.m.\n\nOn the other hand, the 24-hour clock uses a unique number for each hour of the day, starting at 12:00 AM or midnight. But, unlike standard US time, by using the 24-hour clock, we would indicate midnight as 00:00.\n\nNext, the times between midnight and 12:59 PM in the 24-hour clock format are the same as in the 12-hour format, with the exception of the AM/PM abbreviations, which are omitted in the former.\n\nThe count of hours after 12:59 PM is simply continued, so that 1:00 PM equals 13:00, 6:24 PM equals 18:24, and so on.\n\nWhere and why is military time used?\n\nIn the US, the 24-hour clock is used in specialist areas, such as:\n\nAviation\n\nNavigation\n\nTourism\n\nMeteorology\n\nAstronomy\n\nComputing\n\nLogistics\n\nEmergency services\n\nThe military\n\nThe reasons behind the use of military time in these areas include the following:\n\nTo avoid ambiguity in critical situations\n\nTo make collaborative work more convenient by using a shorter and more machine-friendly format (no separators or abbreviations)\n\nTo align with the internationally accepted time formatting within the mentioned professions\n\nDifference between the 24-hour clock and military time formats\n\nMilitary time slightly differs from the 24-hour clock used in other fields.\n\nNamely, US military forces, as well as allied English-speaking military forces, make the following changes to the standard 24-hour format:\n\nThere is no separator between the first two digits (the ones representing the hours) and the last two digits (those representing minutes).\n\nMilitary time uses leading zeros in writing. For example, 9:45 in the 24-hour clock turns into 0945 in military time.\n\nWhen pronouncing military time, the leading zeros have to be said out loud.\n\nWhen pronouncing military time, you cannot use \"thousands\". This means that 2000 military time is not pronounced as \"two thousand\", but as one of the following:\n\n\"Twenty hundred\"\n\n\"Twenty zero zero\"\n\n\"Two zero zero zero\"\n\n24-HOUR CLOCKMILITARY TIME 01:45 0145 14:22 1422 22:07 2207\n\nIs midnight 0000 or 2400?\n\nSimple answer — it’s either. Both ways of formatting are correct.\n\nHowever, there might be a subtle difference in interpretation.\n\nNamely, times from 00:00 to 00:01 can be used to signify the beginning, or more precisely — the first minute of a day.\n\nOn the other hand, times between 2359 and 2400 represent the last minute of a given day.\n\nHow do I convert military time?\n\nThere are a few ways you can do this:\n\nStep by step, manually\n\nUsing a Military Time Converter\n\nReferencing the military time to regular time chart\n\nStep-by-step military time conversion\n\nStep-by-step conversion is the most time consuming way of converting military time.\n\nHowever, if you're interested in time value formatting, following are the instructions to manual military to standard time conversion, as well as the reverse.\n\nFrom standard time to military time\n\nTo convert standard to military time, take the following steps:\n\nStandard time 12:00 AM in military time is either 0000 or 2400, as we’ve explained above.\n\nStandard times 12:01 AM to 12:59 AM — remove the colon, then subtract 12 from the number designating the hours. In the end, remove AM/a.m.\n\nExample: 12:56 AM > 1256 AM > 0056 AM > 0056\n\nStandard times 1:00 AM to 9:59 AM — add a zero before the first digit, remove the colon, and remove the AM/a.m.\n\nExample: 5:09 AM > 05:09 AM > 0509 AM > 0509\n\nStandard times 10:00 AM to 11:59 AM — remove the colon and the AM/a.m.\n\nExample: 11:19 AM > 1119 AM > 1119\n\nStandard times 12:00 PM to 12:59 PM — remove the colon and the PM/p.m.\n\nExample: 12:01 PM > 1201 PM > 1201\n\nStandard times 1:00 PM to 11:59 PM — add 12 to the number of hours. Next, remove the colon. Finally, remove the PM/p.m.\n\nExample: 7:39 PM > 19:39 PM > 1929 PM > 1939\n\nFrom military time to standard time\n\nThere are several rules you need to follow when converting military to standard time:\n\nMilitary times 0000 and 2400 are used to signify 12:00 AM / midnight.\n\nMilitary time 1200 is used to signify 12:00 PM / noon.\n\nMilitary times between 0000 to 0059 — insert a colon between the fist two and last two digits. Next, add 12 to the number of hours. And finally, include the AM/a.m. abbreviation.\n\nExample: 0001 > 00:01 > 12:01 > 12:01 AM\n\nMilitary times 0100 to 0959 — remove the first digit (leading zero), add a colon, and add AM/a.m.\n\nExample: 0446 > 446 > 4:46 > 4:46 AM\n\nMilitary times 1000 to 1159 — insert a colon between the first and last two digits. Then add AM/a.m. at the end.\n\nExample: 1123 > 11:23 > 11:23 AM\n\nMilitary times from 1200 to 1259 — insert a colon and include PM/p.m.\n\nExample: 1234 > 12:34 > 12:34 PM\n\nMilitary times between 1300 to 2359 — insert a colon, then subtract 12 from the number of hours. In the end, add PM/p.m.\n\nExample: 1716 > 17:16 > 5:16 > 5:16 PM\n\nMilitary time to regular time chart\n\nFinally, a simple chart can help you get a clear picture of the differences between military and standard time.\n\nThe chart below gives you a blueprint you can use to convert military time to standard time, as well as the other way round.\n\nMILITARY TIMESTANDARD TIME 0100 1:00 AM 0200 2:00 AM 0300 3:00 AM 0400 4:00 AM 0500 5:00 AM 0600 6:00 AM 0700 7:00 AM 0800 8:00 AM 0900 9:00 AM 1000 10:00 AM 1100 11:00 AM 1200 12:00 PM || NOON 1300 1:00 PM 1400 2:00 PM 1500 3:00 PM 1600 4:00 PM 1700 5:00 PM 1800 6:00 PM 1900 7:00 PM 2000 8:00 PM 2100 9:00 PM 2200 10:00 PM 2300 11:00 PM 2400 or 0000 12:00 AM || MIDNIGHT\n\nUse any timekeeping format to track time with Clockify\n\nConverting between different timekeeping formats can quickly become confusing — especially if you’re looking to track the time you've spent working.\n\nDo you enter time in the 12-hour format?\n\nDo you enter time in the 24-hour format?\n\nCan you play it simple and enter military time in a time tracker?\n\nLuckily, you can use any formatting method to manually add time in Clockify.\n\nThis means that Clockify's time tracker can recognize both military and standard time, as well as different variations of both of these methods.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\nEnter 24-hour time with or without a leading zero\n\nEnter time with a dot, or even no separators at all\n\nEnter time abbreviations in capital or lowercase letters, with or without colons"
