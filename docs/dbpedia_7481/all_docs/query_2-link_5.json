        "text": "Generally, children must live with their parents or guardians until they can function in society independently. Therefore, they must always also be under the supervision of their parents or guardians, especially at home. However, when is the perfect time to leave a child alone in the house? State leaders around the country have been debating this topic for years, and many still do not have steady ground to base this decision on. For the time being, here are the laws surrounding leaving children alone at home around the country.\n\nAge and Maturity of the Child\n\nOne concept that all states agree with is that children should be at a certain age before staying at home alone. The age of the child solely depends on each region and its standards.\n\nWhen it comes to the child's age, eight different ranges are acceptable for each state. These ranges are the ones that states decided are the most acceptable age to start with. That way, as the child gets older, they can begin to adapt to the change and govern themselves accordingly. These ages are used to determine what age is appropriate for kids to start babysitting. The ranges and the number of states that abide by these ages are:\n\n14 Years Old: Illinois\n\n12 Years Old: Colorado, Connecticut, and Mississippi\n\n11 Years Old: Kentucky\n\n10 Years Old: South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington\n\n9 Years Old: Georgia\n\n8 Years Old: Maryland and North Carolina\n\n7 Years Old: Nebraska and Oklahoma\n\n6 Years Old: Kansas\n\nNo Age: 36 states (some have guidelines at the local level)\n\nAlso, the child's maturity level is taken into consideration with being home alone. The following aspects can be used to analyze how mature a child is:\n\nWhether the child can care for themselves.\n\nWhether the child can follow the rules and make wise decisions.\n\nHow the child can respond to urgent situations.\n\nHow the child feels about being alone in the house.\n\nSpecial Circumstances\n\nIn some instances, it is appropriate for young children to stay home alone. Not only are these reasons valid, but they are also necessary most of the time. Sometimes, it can also mean the difference between the child's safety in the long run. Every child is different. Therefore, before parents can leave them in the house alone, they must prepare their children for certain circumstances that could occur. This action requires coaching the children by asking certain questions and teaching them specific information, like:\n\nTeaching the children any emergency contact information.\n\nScheduling times to call the children while they are at home.\n\nShowing the children how to use locks and keep them locked.\n\nKeeping dangerous objects out of the children's reach.\n\nConsequences"
