Am I owed two hours of overtime?\n\nOvertime is calculated based on the “workweek” which is a regularly occurring period of seven days. It could begin on any day or hour your employer chooses as long as it remains the same each week. The answer depends on the number of hours you worked during the workweek. If it’s more than 40 hours in the workweek, you should get overtime pay.\n\nWhat is my “regular rate of pay” for figuring out how much overtime is owed?\n\nIf you are paid on an hourly basis, that amount is the regular rate. Your regular rate may not be less than the minimum wage.\n\nIf you make $18.00 per hour, your overtime rate is $27.00 per hour.\n\nIf you are paid a salary, based on a 40-hour workweek, your regular rate is determined as follows:\n\nMultiply your monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary;\n\nDivide your annual salary by 52 to get the weekly salary;\n\nDivide your weekly salary by 40 to get the regular hourly rate.\n\nThe result is the rate used to compute overtime. Payroll records must reflect overtime pay of 1.5 times that rate for hours over 40 in a workweek.\n\nAre my bonuses included in calculating overtime?\n\nYes. Federal law requires that all amounts, including nondiscretionary bonuses, be included in the regular rate when calculating overtime.\n\nAre any amounts excluded from the regular rate of pay?\n\nYes. Examples are expense reimbursements, premium pay for Saturday, Sunday, or holiday work, discretionary bonuses, and gifts for special occasions.\n\nWhen is overtime required for salaried employees?\n\nAll salaried employees must be paid overtime unless they meet the test for exempt status as defined by federal and state laws.\n\nCAUTION: Misclassification of salaried employees as exempt creates liability for unpaid overtime. It is the employer’s burden to prove exempt status of employees. See the WH Publication 1281 from the U.S. Dept. of Labor (503-326-3057) or consult the TA's Employee Classification & Wage and Hour Exemptions Handbook for more information.\n\nHow is overtime calculated when employees work at different rates of pay in the same workweek?\n\nThe average rate of pay is used to compute overtime.\n\nEXAMPLE: If an employee worked 16 hours at $18.00 per hour and 30 hours at $20.00 per hour the total straight time amount earned is $888.00. That amount is divided by total hours-worked (46), and the weighted average hourly rate is $19.30. Since the employer has already paid the straight time rates for all hours worked, only an additional .5 times the average hourly rate is due for the overtime hours (.5 x $19.30 x 6 hours = $57.90).\n\nAre employees owed overtime after a certain number of hours worked in a day?\n\nIn most cases, no. Even an employee who works 24 hours in one day will be owed no overtime if he works no more than 40 hours in the workweek.\n\nHowever, employees of manufacturing establishments must receive overtime after 10 hours in a day. Special overtime rules also apply to certain work contracted for by government agencies, public works projects, canneries and some hospital employees.\n\nIs there a maximum number of hours I can work during a day?\n\nFor most adult workers, there are no limits on daily work hours. Theoretically, employers may schedule employees to work seven days a week, 24 hours per day, so long as minimum wage and overtime laws are observed.\n\nManufacturing employees are limited to 13 hours of work in a 24-hour period. There are also daily and weekly limitations on the hours minors (employees under 18) can work.\n\nCan my employer require me to work overtime?\n\nYes. Your employer may dictate your work schedule and hours. Employers may discipline or even terminate employees who refuse to work scheduled overtime.\n\nMy employer paid me for 43 hours of wages during the last workweek. Eight of those hours were paid as sick leave, as I was out ill for one day. Should I also be getting overtime?\n\nNo. The required overtime pay is 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. Overtime is calculated based on hours actually worked, and in this scenario you worked only 35 hours during the workweek. Unless a policy, contract or collective bargaining agreement states otherwise, you do not get overtime pay if you used sick leave, vacation time, holidays, or other paid time and did not actually work.\n\nIs it legal for my employer to flex my hours within one workweek to keep me under 40 hours?\n\nYes. For instance, if you work nine hours per day for four work days, you may be scheduled for only four hours on the fifth day of the week to avoid overtime.\n\nCan my employer offer me \"comp\" time off instead of paying overtime?\n\nOnly government agencies are permitted to offer compensatory time in lieu of overtime. If you are a private sector employee, you must received overtime pay when you work over 40 hours in a workweek. (If you work 45 hours during one workweek, your employer could choose to schedule you for 35 hours during the following week, but you would still need to receive pay for the five hours of overtime during the first workweek.)\n\nIf I work unauthorized overtime, does my employer have to pay it?\n\nYes. Your employer can discipline you for violating its policy by working overtime without the required authorization. However, wage and hour laws require that you are compensated for hours you work.\n\nMy employee worked 42 hours in the five-day period from Thursday through Monday. Is the employee due two hours of overtime?\n\nNot necessarily. The answer depends on the number of hours the employee worked during your workweek. A \"workweek\" is a regularly recurring period of seven consecutive 24-hour periods. It may begin on any day and hour the employer chooses as long as it repeats on a regular basis. The employer´s workweek is not necessarily the same as an individual employee´s work schedule. If your workweek runs from Sunday through Saturday, for example, your employee may have worked fewer than 40 hours during that period.\n\nMy pay periods end on the 15th and 30th of each month. Is it correct to pay overtime when the employee works more than 80 hours in the two-week pay period?\n\nNo. Your pay periods are irrelevant to the overtime calculation. Pay periods and workweeks frequently differ. Pay periods may be established for any period not exceeding 35 days, but overtime must be calculated based on a recurring, seven-day workweek. If a workweek overlaps two pay periods, pay any overtime due for that workweek at the end of the second pay period (when the total hours worked for the workweek are known). For example, if payday is on the 15th and the workweek ends on the 17th, the amount of overtime will not be known for that workweek until the following payday. In other words, pay the overtime on the 30th -- the regular payday for the period in which the workweek ends.\n\nFor purposes of calculating overtime, how is the \"regular rate\" of pay determined?\n\nIf the employee is paid on an hourly basis, that amount is the regular rate. The regular rate may not be less than the minimum wage. If the employee is paid a salary, based on a 40-hour workweek, the regular rate is determined as follows:\n\nMultiply the monthly salary by 12 to get the annual salary;\n\nDivide the annual salary by 52 to get the weekly salary;\n\nDivide the weekly salary by 40 to get the regular rate.\n\nThe result is the rate used to compute overtime. Payroll records must reflect overtime pay of 1.5 times that rate for hours over 40 in a workweek.\n\nDo bonus payments increase overtime obligations?\n\nYes. Federal law requires that all amounts, including nondiscretionary bonuses be included in the regular rate when calculating overtime.\n\nAre any amounts excluded from the regular rate of pay?\n\nYes. Examples are expense reimbursements, premium pay for Saturday, Sunday, or holiday work, discretionary bonuses, and gifts for special occasions.\n\nWhen is overtime required for salaried employees?\n\nAll salaried employees must be paid overtime unless they meet the test for exempt status as defined by federal and state laws.\n\nCAUTION: Misclassification of salaried employees as exempt creates liability for unpaid overtime. It is the employer´s burden to prove exempt status of employees. See the WH Publication 1281 from the U.S. Dept. of Labor (503-326-3057) or consult the Classification & Wage and Hour Exemptions Handbook for more information.\n\nHow is overtime calculated when employees work at different rates of pay in the same workweek?\n\nThe weighted average the employees rates of pay is used to compute overtime.\n\nEXAMPLE: If an employee worked 16 hours at $18.00 per hour and 30 hours at $20.00 per hour the total straight time amount earned is $888.00. That amount is divided by total hours-worked (46), and the weighted average hourly rate is $19.30. Since the employer has already paid the straight time rates for all hours worked, only an additional .5 times the average hourly rate is due for the overtime hours (.5 x $19.30 x 6 hours = $57.90).\n\nAre employees owed overtime after a certain number of hours worked in a day?\n\nIn most cases, no. Even an employee who works 24 hours in one day would be owed no overtime if they work no more than a total of 40 hours in the rest of the workweek. Employees of manufacturing establishments must receive overtime after 10 hours in a day. Special overtime rules also apply to certain work contracted for by government agencies, public works projects, canneries and some hospital employees. For more information see the Oregon Wage and Hour Laws Handbook.\n\nIs there a maximum number of hours employees can work during a day?\n\nFor most adult workers, there are no limits on daily work hours. Theoretically, employers may schedule employees to work seven days a week, 24 hours per day, so long as minimum wage and overtime laws are observed. Manufacturing employees are limited to 13 hours of work in a 24-hour period. There are also daily and weekly limitations on the hours minors (employees under 18) can work. For more information, see the Oregon Wage & Hour Laws handbook.\n\nCan I require employees to work overtime?\n\nYes. An employer may dictate an employee’s work schedule and hours. Employers may discipline or even terminate employees who refuse to work scheduled overtime. It is advisable to give employees as much advance notice of overtime requirements as practicable.\n\nI paid my employee for 43 hours of wages during the last workweek. Eight of those hours were paid as sick leave, as the employee was out ill for one day. Am I required to pay the employee for three hours of overtime?\n\nNo. The required overtime pay is 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek. Overtime is calculated based on hours actually worked, and your employee worked only 35 hours during the workweek. Unless a policy, contract or collective bargaining agreement states otherwise, you needn´t count sick leave, vacation time, holidays, or other paid time during which the employee did not actually work.\n\nCan I give my employees \"comp time\" instead of paying overtime?\n\nOnly government agencies are permitted to offer compensatory time in lieu of overtime. If you are a private sector employer, you must pay overtime when an employee works over 40 hours in a workweek. (If your employee works 45 hours during one workweek, you could choose to schedule the employee for 35 hours during the following week, but that would not relieve you of the obligation to pay for the five hours of overtime during the first workweek.)\n\nIs it legal to flex an employee´s hours within one workweek to keep the employee under 40 hours?\n\nYes. For instance, an employee who works nine hours per day for four work days may be scheduled for only four hours on the fifth day of the week to avoid overtime.\n\nIf my employee works unauthorized overtime, am I obligated to pay for it?\n\nYes. You can discipline an employee who violates your policy by working overtime without the required authorization. However, wage and hour laws require that you compensate the employee for any hours you \"suffer or permit\" the employee to work."
