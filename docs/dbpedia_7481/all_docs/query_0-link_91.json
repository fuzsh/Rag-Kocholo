        "text": "Workers under 18 are entitled to minimum wage in the following jobs:\n\nRetail\n\nFood service (restaurant)\n\nHotel/motel\n\nBeauty culture\n\nLaundry/cleaning/dyeing\n\nLight manufacturing apparel\n\nFirst processing of farm products\n\nCertain types of employers are not required to pay minors minimum wage. For more information, read the law here. Please refer to New Jersey's Minimum Wage Chart for scheduled increases. Note: this chart shows planned increases. Actual increases may differ based on inflation, or if the federal government increases the federal minimum wage beyond the state’s minimum wage, or both.\n\nClick here to view detailed information all obligations you have toward employees regarding wage and hour law compliance.\n\nMinors under 16 are not allowed to work more than 40 hours per week.\n\nWorkers ages 16 and 17 may work up to 50 hours per week during the period between the last day of the school year until Labor Day.\n\nWorkers ages 16 and 17 are only eligible for overtime in the following jobs:\n\nFirst processing of farm products\n\nHotel and motel\n\nRestaurants\n\nIn any other job, workers ages 16 and 17 can work up to 50 hours per week, but are exempt from overtime rate.\n\nOvertime pay is set at 1½ times a worker’s regular hourly wage for hours worked over 40 hours per week.\n\nIf you are under the age of 16, you may not work more than 40 hours per week, except in agriculture (see the section on agricultural work to learn more).\n\nIf you are 16 or older, you may work up to 50 hours per week during the period between the last day of the school year and Labor Day.\n\nIf you are 16 or 17, you are only eligible for overtime rate in the following jobs:\n\nFirst processing of farm products\n\nHotel and motels\n\nRestaurants\n\nIn any other job, employers can require workers ages 16 and 17 to work up to 50 hours per week, but are not required to pay overtime.\n\nYour employer could be required to pay overtime under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Information on rights under the FLSA can be found here.\n\nIf you are under 12, you may not work in agriculture.\n\nIf you are over the age of 12, you may work 10 hours per day and 6 days per week during the hours you are not required to be in school. If you are 16 and up, you may work 10 hours per day and 6 days per week during school hours.\n\nIf you are under 16, you may use standard domestic type machines, office machines, standard types of poultry feeders, egg graders, egg washers, egg coolers, and milking machines.\n\nIf you are 16 and up, you may also drive tractors and operate all machinery except power-driven woodworking machinery, grinding, abrasive, polishing or buffing machines, guillotine action cutting machines, operation or repair of elevators or other hoisting apparatus, corn pickers, power-driven hay balers or power field choppers, compactors, circular saws, band saws and guillotine shears.\n\nClick here to learn more about agricultural jobs for young workers.\n\nMisclassification is the practice of illegally categorizing employees as independent contractors.\n\nMisclassification is illegal regardless of whether it was intentional or due to a mistaken belief that workers are independent contractors. Misclassification can also happen when an employer requires an employee to form an LLC or franchise before getting a job.\n\nWhen you are paid cash off the books, that also means that your employer is not giving you access to employment-based protections like access to social security insurance, unemployment insurance, temporary disability insurance and family leave insurance.\n\nWhether misclassified as independent contractor or paid cash off the books, you’re not at fault, but you could be deprived of work rights and other benefits. Misclassified employees may be entitled to financial award as part of employer penalties.\n\nLearn more here.\n\nAll employees in New Jersey injured on the job are eligible to receive workers’ compensation benefits.â¯An employee’s age does not disqualify them from receiving workers’ compensation benefits.\n\nIn NJ, minors injured on the job can receive workers’ compensation benefits regardless of legal employment status. Workers under 18 injured on the job are eligible to receive:\n\nMedical Benefits\n\nTemporary Disability Benefits\n\nPermanent Partial Benefits\n\nPermanent Total Benefits\n\nDeath Benefits (paid to a minor’s dependents, parents, or legal guardians if they die because of their work-related injury or illness)\n\nIf you are employed illegally, you may be entitled to extra benefits depending on the circumstances. These are extra benefits that are not available to adult employees.\n\nIf an employer forces you to work in an unsafe and illegal environment, you will be entitled to twice the amount of worker's compensation benefits. The employer, and not their insurance provider, will pay this penalty.\n\nIf you were employed in violation of child labor laws, you can also bring a civil suit in Superior Court against your employer. A civil suit may recover compensation beyond that which is available under a workers’ compensation claim. Some examples are compensation for pain and suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life.\n\nLearn more about what to do if you’re injured at work here."
