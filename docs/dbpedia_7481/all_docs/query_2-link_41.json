        "text": "Business Responsibilities Under the Law\n\nMinimum wage rates differ based on industry and region. Rates will increase each year until they reach $15.00 per hour.\n\nFast food industry workers in NYC - $16.00\n\nFast food industry workers outside NYC - $15.00\n\nLong Island & Westchester County - $16.00\n\nAll NYC employers - $16.00\n\nTipped workers - rates vary by region. See Wage Order Summary.\n\nRemainder of New York State - $15.00\n\nThese rates are in effect from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024. View minimum wage rates through 2022.\n\nEnforcement of Minimum Wage Laws\n\nNew York State Department of Labor helps collect underpayments for workers who have not received the minimum wage. Often, funds are collected without resorting to court action.\n\nHowever, an employer that violates the Minimum Wage Law is subject to criminal prosecution and penalties. Action may also be taken in civil court.\n\nThe Commissioner of Labor may require an employer to pay:\n\nMinimum wage underpayments and liquidated damages, PLUS\n\nInterest and civil penalties up to 200% of the unpaid wages\n\nEducational Seminars\n\nThe Division of Labor Standards offers free educational seminars to employers doing business in New York State.\n\nWhat's in it for you?\n\nEach year Labor Standards responds to thousands of employee complaints of unpaid wages and benefits, illegal employment of children, meal period violations and more.\n\nThe New York State labor law can be very complicated, and it is easy for employers to make a mistake. Many honorable employers are found to owe back wages and penalties that turn out to be quite costly.\n\nA Division of Labor Standards Educational Seminar may help an employer avoid the cost and inconvenience of a Labor Standards Investigation. The seminar is designed to teach employers how to avoid being in violation of labor laws.\n\nWhile the labor law covers all areas/types of employment, we can tailor an Educational Seminar to the industry of those attending.\n\nWe can design a seminar for a specific company, allowing the company to include the seminar in scheduled corporate training sessions for managers or company meetings at a specific location.\n\nThe Division of Labor Standards will provide Educational Seminar information in brochures, booklets and PowerPoint presentations at no cost to an employer.\n\nFor more information on Educational Seminars please call: 518-457-9000."
