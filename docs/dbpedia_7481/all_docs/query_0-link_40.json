        "text": "We ask that everyone be respectful of one another, the artwork, and our facility as we work together to provide a safe, inspiring environment.\n\nMasks and face coverings are welcome but not required.\n\nGuests should avoid bringing coats and large bags unless necessary for medical reasons. All bags will be inspected upon entry; backpacks, backpack-style child carriers, oversize strollers, umbrellas, bulky coats, and bags and packages larger than 12 x 10 inches must be stowed in our free coat check or lockers on the Lower Level.\n\nPhotography for personal use is allowed, unless otherwise posted. No flash, tripods, or selfie sticks. For press inquiries or information about commercial photography, please contact our communications office.\n\nNotetaking and sketching are permitted with graphite pencil and notebooks no larger than 9 x 12 inches.\n\nIf our galleries are crowded, we may ask you to stop sketching, writing, or taking photos. This helps us maintain movement throughout the space\n\nHelp us keep the collection safe by keeping your distance—stay about two feet from any wall. You can use the line on the floor as a helpful guide. Please don't touch paintings, frames, furniture, or ironwork.\n\nChildren under 15 must be accompanied by an adult.\n\nFood and drink are not allowed in the galleries.\n\nBreastfeeding is welcome wherever the parent is comfortable. Bottles and other types of feeding are not allowed in the galleries.\n\nThe Barnes is a smoke-free building.\n\nIn certain circumstances, guests who violate our guidelines may be asked to leave.\n\nThe comfort and enjoyment of our guests is important to us, and we strive to accommodate your needs.\n\nWheelchairs\n\nOur entire facility is accessible to standard-size wheelchairs. Because of the small size of the collection galleries, some larger mobility devices may not be accommodated in all rooms.\n\nA limited number of wheelchairs are available on-site, and they will be cleaned and disinfected after each use. No reservation is necessary.\n\nRestrooms\n\nWheelchair-accessible restrooms are located on the Lower Level and in the Garden Restaurant.\n\nParking\n\nDesignated parking is available for visitors with disabilities in our parking lot on Pennsylvania Avenue between 20th and 21st Streets. Vehicles must display a current state-issued disability placard or license plate. Parking is available on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nAssistive Listening Devices\n\nAssistive listening devices amplify and clarify sound by cutting down or eliminating ambient noise. Headsets and T-coil loops are distributed free of charge on a first-come, first-served basis by request to our staff.\n\nSign Language Interpreters\n\nWith advance notice, we are happy to provide sign language interpreters for reserved docent tours. Please make your request at least three weeks prior to your visit. Tickets must be purchased in advance. Email us for more information.\n\nService Animals\n\nTrained service animals are welcome at the Barnes. No pets or other animals are permitted.\n\nPersonal Care Assistants\n\nAny paid Personal Care Attendant (PCA) accompanying a visitor with severe disabilities will be admitted free of charge. A request for free admission for a PCA should be made at the time the visitor with disabilities purchases their ticket. Visitors who wish to purchase advance tickets should email us or call 215.278.7200 to request a complimentary ticket for a paid PCA.\n\nDiscounts\n\nTo help make the Barnes accessible to all, we offer free admission to ACCESS/EBT cardholders, including those receiving Medical Assistance only."
