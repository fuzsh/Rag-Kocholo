        "text": "(a) This part shall be used for the acquisition of supplies or services that meet the definitions of “commercial product” or “commercial service” at 2.101.\n\n(b) Contracting officers shall use the policies in this part in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award prescribed in part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures; part 14, Sealed Bidding; or part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, as appropriate for the particular acquisition.\n\n(c) Contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services are subject to the policies in other parts of the FAR. When a policy in another part of the FAR is inconsistent with a policy in this part, this part 12 shall take precedence for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\n\n(d) The definition of commercial product uses the phrase “purposes other than governmental purposes”. These purposes are those that are not unique to a government.\n\n(e) This part shall not apply to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services—\n\n(1) At or below the micro-purchase threshold;\n\n(2) Using the Standard Form 44 (see 13.306);\n\n(3) Using the imprest fund (see 13.305);\n\n(4) Using the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of purchase rather than only as a method of payment; or\n\n(5) Directly from another Federal agency.\n\n(f)\n\n(1) Contracting officers may treat any acquisition of supplies or services that, as determined by the head of the agency, are to be used to facilitate defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack, as an acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\n\n(2) A contract in an amount greater than $20 million that is awarded on a sole source basis for a product or service treated as a commercial product or commercial service under paragraph (f)(1) of this section but does not meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service as defined at FAR 2.101 shall not be exempt from—\n\n(i) Cost accounting standards (see subpart 30.2); or\n\n(ii) Certified cost or pricing data requirements (see 15.403).\n\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, agencies shall use firm-fixed-price contracts or fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\n\n(b)\n\n(1) A time-and-materials contract or labor-hour contract (see subpart 16.6) may be used for the acquisition of commercial services when-\n\n(i) The service is acquired under a contract awarded using-\n\n(A) Competitive procedures (e.g., the procedures in 6.102, the set-aside procedures in subpart 19.5, or competition conducted in accordance with part 13);\n\n(B) The procedures for other than full and open competition in 6.3 provided the agency receives offers that satisfy the Government’s expressed requirement from two or more responsible offerors; or\n\n(C) The fair opportunity procedures in 16.505 (including discretionary small business set-asides under 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F)), if placing an order under a multiple-award delivery-order contract; and\n\n(ii) The contracting officer-\n\n(A) Executes a determination and findings (D&F) for the contract, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section (but see paragraph (c) of this section for indefinite-delivery contracts), that no other contract type authorized by this subpart is suitable;\n\n(B) Includes a ceiling price in the contract or order that the contractor exceeds at its own risk; and\n\n(C) Prior to increasing the ceiling price of a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract or order, shall-\n\n(1) Conduct an analysis of pricing and other relevant factors to determine if the action is in the best interest of the Government;\n\n(2) Document the decision in the contract or order file; and\n\n(3) When making a change that modifies the general scope of-\n\n(i) A contract, follow the procedures at 6.303;\n\n(ii) An order issued under the Federal Supply Schedules, follow the procedures at 8.405-6; or\n\n(iii) An order issued under multiple award task and delivery order contracts, follow the procedures at 16.505(b)(2).\n\n(2) Each D&F required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section shall contain sufficient facts and rationale to justify that no other contract type authorized by this subpart is suitable. At a minimum, the D&F shall-\n\n(i) Include a description of the market research conducted (see 10.002(e));\n\n(ii) Establish that it is not possible at the time of placing the contract or order to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence;\n\n(iii) Establish that the requirement has been structured to maximize the use of firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts (e.g., by limiting the value or length of the time-and-material/labor-hour contract or order; establishing fixed prices for portions of the requirement) on future acquisitions for the same or similar requirements; and\n\n(iv) Describe actions planned to maximize the use of firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts on future acquisitions for the same requirements.\n\n(3) See 16.601(d)(1) for additional approval required for contracts expected to extend beyond three years.\n\n(4) See 8.404(h) for the requirement for determination and findings when using Federal Supply Schedules.\n\n(c)\n\n(1) Indefinite-delivery contracts (see subpart 16.5) may be used when-\n\n(i) The prices are established based on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment; or\n\n(ii) Rates are established for commercial services acquired on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis.\n\n(2) When an indefinite-delivery contract is awarded with services priced on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis, contracting officers shall, to the maximum extent practicable, also structure the contract to allow issuance of orders on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis. For such contracts, the contracting officer shall execute the D&F required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for each order placed on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis. Placement of orders shall be in accordance with subpart 8.4 or 16.5, as applicable.\n\n(3) If an indefinite-delivery contract only allows for the issuance of orders on a time-and-materials or labor-hour basis, the D&F required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be executed to support the basic contract and shall also explain why providing for an alternative firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment pricing structure is not practicable. The D&F for this contract shall be approved one level above the contracting officer. Placement of orders shall be in accordance with subpart 16.5.\n\n(d) The contract types authorized by this subpart may be used in conjunction with an award fee and performance or delivery incentives when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost (see 16.202-1 and 16.203-1).\n\n(e) Use of any contract type other than those authorized by this subpart to acquire commercial products or commercial services is prohibited.\n\n(a) In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3307, contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services shall, to the maximum extent practicable, include only those clauses—\n\n(1) Required to implement provisions of law or executive orders applicable to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services; or\n\n(2) Determined to be consistent with customary commercial practice.\n\n(b) Insert the following provisions in solicitations for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services, and clauses in solicitations and contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services:\n\n(1) The provision at 52.212-1 ,Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. This provision provides a single, streamlined set of instructions to be used when soliciting offers for commercial products or commercial services and is incorporated in the solicitation by reference (see Block 27 a, SF 1449). The contracting officer may tailor these instructions or provide additional instructions tailored to the specific acquisition in accordance with 12.302.\n\n(2) The provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. This provision provides a single, consolidated list of representations and certifications for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services and is attached to the solicitation for offerors to complete. This provision may not be tailored except in accordance with subpart 1.4. Use the provision with its Alternate I in solicitations issued by DoD, NASA, or the Coast Guard.\n\n(3) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services.. This clause includes terms and conditions which are, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with customary commercial practices and is incorporated in the solicitation and contract by reference (see Block 27, SF 1449). Use this clause with its Alternate I when a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract will be awarded. The contracting officer may tailor this clause in accordance with 12.302.\n\n(4) The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Products and Commercial Services. This clause incorporates by reference only those clauses required to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services. The contracting officer shall attach this clause to the solicitation and contract and, using the appropriate clause prescriptions, indicate which, if any, of the additional clauses cited in 52.212-5(b) or (c) are applicable to the specific acquisition. Some of the clauses require fill-in; the fill-in language should be inserted as directed by 52.104(d). When cost information is obtained pursuant to part 15 to establish the reasonableness of prices for commercial products or commercial services, the contracting officer shall insert the clauses prescribed for this purpose in an addendum to the solicitation and contract. This clause may not be tailored.\n\n(i) Use the clause with its Alternate I when the head of the agency has waived the examination of records by the Comptroller General in accordance with 25.1001.\n\n(ii)\n\n(A) If the acquisition will use funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5), the contracting officer shall use the clause with its Alternate II.\n\n(B)\n\n(1) In the case of a bilateral contract modification that will use funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the contracting officer shall specify applicability of Alternate II to that modification.\n\n(2) In the case of a task- or delivery-order contract in which not all orders will use funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the contracting officer shall specify the task or delivery orders to which Alternate II applies.\n\n(C) The contracting officer may not use Alternate I when Alternate II applies.\n\n(c) When the use of evaluation factors is appropriate, the contracting officer may—\n\n(1) Insert the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, in solicitations for commercial products or commercial services (see 12.602); or\n\n(2) Include a similar provision containing all evaluation factors required by 13.106, subpart 14.2 or subpart 15.3, as an addendum (see 12.302(d)).\n\n(d) Other required provisions and clauses. Notwithstanding prescriptions contained elsewhere in the FAR, when acquiring commercial products or commercial services, contracting officers shall be required to use only those provisions and clauses prescribed in this part. The provisions and clauses prescribed in this part shall be revised, as necessary, to reflect the applicability of statutes and executive orders to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.\n\n(1) Insert the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management, as prescribed in 4.1105(a).\n\n(2) Insert the clause at 52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance, as prescribed in 4.1105(b).\n\n(3) Insert the provision at 52.204-16, Commercial and Government Entity Code Reporting, as prescribed in 4.1804(a).\n\n(4) Insert the clause at 52.204-18, Commercial and Government Entity Code Maintenance, as prescribed in 4.1804(c).\n\n(5) Insert the clause at 52.204-21, Basic Safeguarding of Covered Contractor Information Systems, in solicitations and contracts (except for acquisitions of COTS items), as prescribed in 4.1903.\n\n(6) Insert the provision at 52.204-24, Representation Regarding Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment, as prescribed in 4.2105(a).\n\n(7) Insert the provision at 52.207-6, Solicitation of Offers from Small Business Concerns and Small Business Teaming Arrangements or Joint Ventures (Multiple-Award Contracts), as prescribed at 7.107-6.\n\n(8) Insert the provision at 52.209-7, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters, as prescribed in 9.104-7(b).\n\n(9) Insert the provision at 52.209-12, Certification Regarding Tax Matters, as prescribed at 9.104-7(e).\n\n(10) Insert the provision at 52.222-56, Certification Regarding Trafficking in Persons Compliance Plan, in solicitations as prescribed at 22.1705(b).\n\n(11) Insert the clause at 52.225-19, Contractor Personnel in a Designated Operational Area or Supporting a Diplomatic or Consular Mission outside the United States, as prescribed in 25.301-4.\n\n(12) Insert the provision at 52.229-11, Tax on Certain Foreign Procurements—Notice and Representation, in solicitations as prescribed in 29.402-3(a). The representation in the provision at 52.229-11 is not in the System for Award Management.\n\n(13) Insert the clause at 52.229-13, Taxes—Foreign Contracts in Afghanistan, as prescribed in 29.402-4(a).\n\n(14) Insert the clause at 52.229-14, Taxes—Foreign Contracts in Afghanistan (North Atlantic Treaty Organization Status of Forces Agreement), as prescribed in 29.402-4(b).\n\n(e) Discretionary use of FAR provisions and clauses. The contracting officer may include in solicitations and contracts by addendum other FAR provisions and clauses when their use is consistent with the limitations contained in 12.302. For example:\n\n(1) The contracting officer may use the provision at 52.201-1, Acquisition 360: Voluntary Survey, as prescribed in 1.102-3(b).\n\n(2) The contracting officer may include appropriate clauses when an indefinite-delivery type of contract will be used. The clauses prescribed at 16.506 may be used for this purpose.\n\n(3) The contracting officer may include appropriate provisions and clauses when the use of options is in the Government’s interest. The provisions and clauses prescribed in 17.208 may be used for this purpose. If the provision at 52.212-2 is used, paragraph (b) provides for the evaluation of options.\n\n(4) The contracting officer may use the provisions and clauses contained in part 23 regarding the use of products containing recovered materials and biobased products when appropriate for the item being acquired.\n\n(5) When setting aside under the Stafford Act ( subpart 26.2), include the provision at 52.226-3, Disaster or Emergency Area Representation, in the solicitation. The representation in this provision is not in the System for Award Management.\n\n(f) Agencies may supplement the provisions and clauses prescribed in this part (to require use of additional provisions and clauses) only as necessary to reflect agency unique statutes applicable to the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services or as may be approved by the agency senior procurement executive, or the individual responsible for representing the agency on the FAR Council, without power of delegation.\n\n(a) General. The clause at 52.212-4 permits the Government to terminate a contract for commercial products or commercial services either for the convenience of the Government or for cause. However, the paragraphs in 52.212-4 entitled \"Termination for the Government’s Convenience\" and \"Termination for Cause\" contain concepts which differ from those contained in the termination clauses prescribed in part 49. Consequently, the requirements of part 49 do not apply when terminating contracts for commercial products or commercial services and contracting officers shall follow the procedures in this section. Contracting officers may continue to use part 49 as guidance to the extent that part 49 does not conflict with this section and the language of the termination paragraphs in 52.212-4.\n\n(b) Policy. The contracting officer should exercise the Government’s right to terminate a contract for commercial products or commercial services either for convenience or for cause only when such a termination would be in the best interests of the Government. The contracting officer should consult with counsel prior to terminating for cause.\n\n(c) Termination for cause.\n\n(1) The paragraph in 52.212-4 entitled \"Excusable Delay\" requires contractors notify the contracting officer as soon as possible after commencement of any excusable delay. In most situations, this requirement should eliminate the need for a show cause notice prior to terminating a contract. The contracting officer shall send a cure notice prior to terminating a contract for a reason other than late delivery.\n\n(2) The Government’s rights after a termination for cause shall include all the remedies available to any buyer in the marketplace. The Government’s preferred remedy will be to acquire similar items from another contractor and to charge the defaulted contractor with any excess reprocurement costs together with any incidental or consequential damages incurred because of the termination.\n\n(3) When a termination for cause is appropriate, the contracting officer shall send the contractor a written notification regarding the termination. At a minimum, this notification shall-\n\n(i) Indicate the contract is terminated for cause;\n\n(ii) Specify the reasons for the termination;\n\n(iii) Indicate which remedies the Government intends to seek or provide a date by which the Government will inform the contractor of the remedy; and\n\n(iv) State that the notice constitutes a final decision of the contracting officer and that the contractor has the right to appeal under the Disputes clause (see 33.211).\n\n(4) The contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures, shall ensure that information related to termination for cause notices and any amendments are reported. In the event the termination for cause is subsequently converted to a termination for convenience, or is otherwise withdrawn, the contracting officer shall ensure that a notice of the conversion or withdrawal is reported. All reporting shall be in accordance with 42.1503(h).\n\n(d) Termination for the Government’s convenience.\n\n(1) When the contracting officer terminates a contract for commercial products or commercial services for the Government’s convenience, the contractor shall be paid-\n\n(i)\n\n(A) The percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of the termination for fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts; or\n\n(B) An amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the Schedule; and\n\n(ii) Any charges the contractor can demonstrate directly resulted from the termination. The contractor may demonstrate such charges using its standard record keeping system and is not required to comply with the cost accounting standards or the contract cost principles in part 31. The Government does not have any right to audit the contractor’s records solely because of the termination for convenience.\n\n(2) Generally, the parties should mutually agree upon the requirements of the termination proposal. The parties must balance the Government’s need to obtain sufficient documentation to support payment to the contractor against the goal of having a simple and expeditious settlement.\n\n(a) Implied warranties. The Government’s post award rights contained in 52.212-4 are the implied warranty of merchantability, the implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose and the remedies contained in the acceptance paragraph.\n\n(1) The implied warranty of merchantability provides that an item is reasonably fit for the ordinary purposes for which such items are used. The items must be of at least average, fair or medium-grade quality and must be comparable in quality to those that will pass without objection in the trade or market for items of the same description.\n\n(2) The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose provides that an item is fit for use for the particular purpose for which the Government will use the items. The Government can rely upon an implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose when-\n\n(i) The seller knows the particular purpose for which the Government intends to use the item; and\n\n(ii) The Government relied upon the contractor’s skill and judgment that the item would be appropriate for that particular purpose.\n\n(3) Contracting officers should consult with legal counsel prior to asserting any claim for a breach of an implied warranty.\n\n(b) Express warranties. 41 U.S.C. 3307(e)(5)(B) requires contracting officers to take advantage of commercial warranties. To the maximum extent practicable, solicitations for commercial products shall require offerors to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice. Solicitations may specify minimum warranty terms, such as minimum duration, appropriate for the Government’s intended use of the item.\n\n(1) Any express warranty the Government intends to rely upon must meet the needs of the Government. The contracting officer should analyze any commercial warranty to determine if-\n\n(i) The warranty is adequate to protect the needs of the Government, e.g., items covered by the warranty and length of warranty;\n\n(ii) The terms allow the Government effective postaward administration of the warranty to include the identification of warranted items, procedures for the return of warranted items to the contractor for repair or replacement, and collection of product performance information; and\n\n(iii) The warranty is cost-effective.\n\n(2) In some markets, it may be customary commercial practice for contractors to exclude or limit the implied warranties contained in 52.212-4 in the provisions of an express warranty. In such cases, the contracting officer shall ensure that the express warranty provides for the repair or replacement of defective items discovered within a reasonable period of time after acceptance.\n\n(3) Express warranties shall be included in the contract by addendum (see 12.302).\n\n(a) When a written solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the following procedure to reduce the time required to solicit and award contracts for the acquisition of commercial products or commercial services.
