        "text": "Perseids\n\nCurrently active\n\nActive from July 14th to September 1st, 2024\n\nThe Perseids are the most popular meteor shower as they peak on warm August nights as seen from the northern hemisphere. The Perseids are active from July 14 to September 1. They reach a strong maximum on August 12 or 13, depending on the year. Normal rates seen from rural locations range from 50-75 shower members per hour at maximum. The Perseids are particles released from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle during its numerous returns to the inner solar system. They are called Perseids since the radiant (the area of the sky where the meteors seem to originate) is located near the prominent constellation of Perseus the hero when at maximum activity. In 2024, the half illuminated moon will set near 1am local daylight saving time. This is a favorable coincidence as this is the time that strong activity begins to occur from this shower.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 03:13 +58° - ZHR: 100 - Velocity: 37 miles/sec (swift - 59km/sec) - Parent Object: 109P/Swift-Tuttle\n\nNext Peak - The Perseids will next peak on the Aug 11-12, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 44% full.\n\n***\n\nOrionids\n\nNext period of activity: September 26th, 2024 to November 22nd, 2024\n\nThe Orionids are a medium strength shower that sometimes reaches high strength activity. In a normal year the Orionids produce 10-20 shower members at maximum. In exceptional years, such as 2006-2009, the peak rates were on par with the Perseids (50-75 per hour). Recent displays have produced low to average displays of this shower. In 2024, a waning gibbous moon will rise during the late evening hours and will severely hamper views of this display.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 06:21 +15.6° - ZHR: 20 - Velocity: 41 miles/sec (swift - 66km/sec) - Parent Object: 1P/Halley\n\nNext Peak - The Orionids will next peak on the Oct 20-21, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 83% full.\n\n***\n\nSouthern Taurids\n\nNext period of activity: September 23rd, 2024 to December 8th, 2024\n\nThe Southern Taurids are a long-lasting shower that several peaks during its activity period. The shower is active for more than two months but rarely produces more than five shower members per hour, even at maximum activity. The Taurids (both branches) are rich in fireballs and are often responsible for increased number of fireball reports from September through November.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 03:35 +14.4° - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 17.2 miles/sec (slow - 27.7km/sec) - Parent Object: 2P/Encke\n\nNext Peak - The Southern Taurids will next peak on the Nov 4-5, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 11% full.\n\n***\n\nNorthern Taurids\n\nNext period of activity: October 13th, 2024 to December 2nd, 2024\n\nThis shower is much like the Southern Taurids, just active a bit later in the year. When the two showers are active simultaneously in late October and early November, there is sometimes a notable increase in the fireball activity.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 03:55 +22.8° - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 18 miles/sec (slow - 30km/sec) - Parent Object: 2P/Encke\n\nNext Peak - The Northern Taurids will next peak on the Nov 11-12, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 79% full.\n\n***\n\nLeonids\n\nNext period of activity: November 3rd, 2024 to December 2nd, 2024\n\nThe Leonids are best known for producing meteor storms in the years of 1833, 1866, 1966, 1999, and 2001. These outbursts of meteor activity are best seen when the parent object, comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, is near perihelion (closest approach to the sun). Yet it is not the fresh material we see from the comet, but rather debris from earlier returns that also happen to be most dense at the same time. Unfortunately, it appears that the earth will not encounter any dense clouds of debris until 2099. Therefore, when the comet returns in 2031 and 2064, there may not be any meteor storms, but perhaps several good displays of Leonid activity when rates are in excess of 100 per hour. Each passing year also presents new possibilities from old debris fields. In 2024, the waning gibbous moon will rise during the late evening hours and will spoil the best viewing hours for this shower.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 10:17 +21.6° - ZHR: 15 - Velocity: 43.5 miles/sec (swift - 70km/sec) - Parent Object: 55P/Tempel-Tuttle\n\nNext Peak - The Leonids will next peak on the Nov 17-18, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 94% full.\n\n***\n\nGeminids\n\nNext period of activity: November 19th, 2024 to December 24th, 2024\n\nThe Geminids are usually the strongest meteor shower of the year and meteor enthusiasts are certain to circle December 13 and 14 on their calendars. This is the one major shower that provides good activity prior to midnight as the constellation of Gemini is well placed from 22:00 onward. The Geminids are often bright and intensely colored. Due to their medium-slow velocity, persistent trains are not usually seen. These meteors are also seen in the southern hemisphere, but only during the middle of the night and at a reduced rate. In 2024, a full moon will greatly reduce the number of meteors seen. If your skies are clear and transparent, you can still see many bright meteors by facing a direction with the moon at your back.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 07:24 +32.3° - ZHR: 150 - Velocity: 21 miles/sec (medium - 34km/sec) - Parent Object: 3200 Phaethon (asteroid)\n\nNext Peak - The Geminids will next peak on the Dec 13-14, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 97% full.\n\n***\n\nUrsids\n\nNext period of activity: December 13th, 2024 to December 24th, 2024\n\nThe Ursids are often neglected due to the fact it peaks just before Christmas and the rates are much less than the Geminds, which peaks just a week before the Ursids. Observers will normally see 5-10 Ursids per hour during the late morning hours on the date of maximum activity. There have been occasional outbursts when rates have exceeded 25 per hour. These outbursts appear unrelated to the perihelion dates of comet 8P/Tuttle. This shower is strictly a northern hemisphere event as the radiant fails to clear the horizon or does so simultaneously with the start of morning twilight as seen from the southern tropics.In 2024, a half-illuminated moon will be present in the morning sky and will obscure the fainter meteors.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 14:36 +75.3° - ZHR: 10 - Velocity: 20.5 miles/sec (medium - 33km/sec) - Parent Object: 8P/Tuttle\n\nNext Peak - The Ursids will next peak on the Dec 21-22, 2024 night. On this night, the moon will be 59% full.\n\n***\n\nQuadrantids\n\nNext period of activity: December 26th, 2024 to January 16th, 2025\n\nThe Quadrantids have the potential to be the strongest shower of the year but usually fall short due to the short length of maximum activity (6 hours) and the poor weather experienced during early January. The average hourly rates one can expect under dark skies is 25. These meteors usually lack persistent trains but often produce bright fireballs. Due to the high northerly declination (celestial latitude) these meteors are not well seen from the southern hemisphere. Predictions for 2025 show a peak near 15UT on January 3rd. This timing favors the eastern Pacific area. Rates could be quite high if observed under clear, transparent skies. The waxing crescent moon will set before the radiant achieves a favorable altitude.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 15:20 +49.7° - ZHR: 120 - Velocity: 25 miles/sec (medium - 40.2km/sec) - Parent Object: 2003 EH (Asteroid)\n\nNext Peak - The Quadrantids will next peak on the Jan 2-3, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 11% full.\n\n***\n\nLyrids\n\nNext period of activity: April 15th, 2025 to April 29th, 2025\n\nThe Lyrids are a medium strength shower that usually produces good rates for three nights centered on the maximum. These meteors also usually lack persistent trains but can produce fireballs. These meteors are best seen from the northern hemisphere where the radiant is high in the sky at dawn. Activity from this shower can be seen from the southern hemisphere, but at a lower rate. Maximum is predicted to occur near 13UT on April 22nd. The waning crescent moon will slightly interfere with viewing these meteors in 2025.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 18:10 +33.3° - ZHR: 18 - Velocity: 29 miles/sec (medium - 46.8km/sec) - Parent Object: C/1861 G1 (Thatcher)\n\nNext Peak - The Lyrids will next peak on the Apr 21-22, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 40% full.\n\n***\n\neta Aquariids\n\nNext period of activity: April 15th, 2025 to May 27th, 2025\n\nThe Eta Aquariids are a strong shower when viewed from the southern tropics. From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn. Activity is good for a week centered the night of maximum activity. These are swift meteors that produce a high percentage of persistent trains, but few fireballs. There are predictions that this shower will be quite strong in 2024 due to interactions of the particles with the planet Jupiter. Luckily, there will be little interference from the waning crescent moon in 2024.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 22:30 -1° - ZHR: 50 - Velocity: 40.7 miles/sec (swift - 65.5km/sec) - Parent Object: 1P/Halley\n\nNext Peak - The eta Aquariids will next peak on the May 4-5, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 54% full.\n\n***\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids\n\nNext period of activity: July 18th, 2025 to August 21st, 2025\n\nThe Delta Aquariids are another strong shower best seen from the southern tropics. North of the equator the radiant is located lower in the southern sky and therefore rates are less than seen from further south. These meteors produce good rates for a week centered on the night of maximum. These are usually faint meteors that lack both persistent trains and fireballs. In 2024, moonlight will be a minor factor from the waning crescent moon which rises in the early morning hours. If the moon is above your horizon when viewing this shower, simply view more toward the southwestern sky.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 22:42 -16.3° - ZHR: 25 - Velocity: 25 miles/sec (medium - 40km/sec) - Parent Object: 96P/Machholz?\n\nNext Peak - The Southern delta Aquariids will next peak on the Jul 29-30, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 27% full.\n\n***\n\nalpha Capricornids\n\nNext period of activity: July 7th, 2025 to August 15th, 2025\n\nThe Alpha Capricornids are active from July 7 through August 15 with a \"plateau-like\" maximum centered on July 31st. This shower is not very strong and rarely produces in excess of five shower members per hour. What is notable about this shower is the number of bright fireballs produced during its activity period. This shower is seen equally well on either side of the equator.\n\nShower details - Radiant: 20:26 -9.12° - ZHR: 5 - Velocity: 14 miles/sec (slow - 22km/sec) - Parent Object: 169P/NEAT\n\nNext Peak - The alpha Capricornids will next peak on the Jul 30-31, 2025 night. On this night, the moon will be 36% full.\n\n***"
