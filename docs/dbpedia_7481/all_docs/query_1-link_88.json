        "text": "How it works\n\nAt certain times of the day, many people and businesses in the Valley are using energy, which puts pressure on the power grid. The SRP TOU Price Plan offers price breaks for customers who can commit to shifting their energy use outside of those high-demand, or “on-peak,” hours.\n\nThis price plan is a good option for customers who are conscious of their energy use and who have a large home or pool.\n\nUnderstanding on-peak hours\n\nOnce you understand how on-peak hours work, it’s easy to make the shift. All it takes is some planning and attention to your energy use.\n\nDuring on-peak hours, you’ll want to avoid using major home appliances, such as your dishwasher, clothes washer or dryer.\n\nYou’ll pay less for energy all other hours, including weekends and on six observed holidays .\n\nPricing\n\nEnergy is priced per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and your monthly charge is based on the amount of energy used at on- and off-peak times during your billing cycle. Off-peak times (when demand is low) offer the lowest prices and vary by time of day and year.\n\nWhy are energy prices higher in the summer?\n\nRegardless of your price plan, energy costs change in the summer and winter in response to demand. In the hot summer months, demand for energy is high, which means higher generation costs and higher prices. In the winter months, demand for energy falls and prices do too.\n\nTOU vs. EZ-3 – What’s the difference?\n\nThe TOU price plan offers the biggest savings opportunity of any of the time-of-day price plans. That’s because it offers the lowest price per kWh during off-peak hours.\n\nCustomers on the TOU Price Plan need to limit their energy use during more weekday hours than those on the EZ-3 Price Plan. (The EZ-3 Price Plan involves just three on-peak hours a day on weekdays.) In turn, TOU customers save an average of 4.8%* on their annual electric bill. To learn more, compare price plans.\n\nTry it risk-free for 90 days\n\nIf your first three bills on TOU aren't lower than what you would have paid on the Basic Price Plan, we'll credit you the difference and switch you back to the Basic plan.\n\nReady to change your price plan?\n\nThink the TOU Price Plan would be a good fit for your household and lifestyle? Visit SRP My Account™ or call (602) 236-8888(602) 236-8888 to make the switch. We’re here to help 24/7."
