        "text": "How To Manually Convert Military Time (24-Hour) to 12-Hour Standard Time\n\nConverting military time to regular time can seem complicated, but it's actually quite simple. To convert military time to regular time, you just need to subtract 12 from any time that's greater than 12:00 PM.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to convert 16:30 hours (military time) to regular time. Since 16 is greater than 12, you need to subtract 12 from 16, which gives you 4. So, 16:30 hours becomes 4:30 PM in regular time.\n\nIn most cases, if the military time is less than or equal to 12:00 PM, then you can simply add \"AM\" to the end of the time. For example, 8:30 hours (military time) is equal to 8:30 AM in regular time. The exception is 12:00 AM, which is displayed as 00:00 in the 24-hour time format\n\nHow To Manually Convert Military Time (24-Hour) to 12-Hour Standard Time\n\nConverting military time to regular time can seem complicated, but it's actually quite simple.

The exception is 12:00 AM, which is displayed as 00:00 in the 24-hour time format\n\nHow To Manually Convert a 12-Hour Format to Military Time\n\nConverting regular time to military time is also a simple process. If the time is in the AM, you should remove the “AM” portion and add a leading zero to any single-digit hours (e.g., 08:00 for 8:00 AM). Again, the exception is 12:00 AM, which is displayed as 00:00 in military time.\n\nIf the time is in the PM, instead of subtracting 12 hours from the hour portion of the time, you should add 12 to the hour portion of the time. For instance, if you want to convert 2:30 pm to military time, you should add 12 to the hour portion, resulting in 14:30 hours.\n\nThose who are unfamiliar with military time often misinterpret the 24-hour format. One common mistake is dropping the first digit (e.g., reading 13:00 as 3:00 PM, when it is actually 1:00 PM). You should also note that there is no need to specify AM or PM with military time, since it uses a 24-hour format. Finally, keep in mind that the standard format for military time is four digits, which means you should include a 0 in front of times less than 10:00. In other words, 8:00 AM should be indicated as 08:00, not 8:00."
