        "text": "July 1, 2024\n\nHistorical Tables\n\nSome states set subminimum rates for minors and/or students or exempt them from coverage or have a training wage for new hires. Some local governments set minimum wage rates higher than their respective state minimum wage. Such differential provisions are not displayed in this table.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\nOther additional deductions are permitted, for example for meals and lodging.\n\nMinnesota. A large employer means an enterprise whose annual gross revenue is not less than $500,000. A small employer means an enterprise whose annual gross revenue is less than $500,000.\n\nNew Jersey. An employer is eligible to apply a tip credit against the full state minimum hourly wage only if the tipped employees have been informed in advance of the amount of the cash wage that is to be paid; the amount of the tip credit claimed by the employer; that all tips received must be retained by the employee, except in case of a valid tip pool arrangement limited to tipped employees; and of the requirements of the relevant New Jersey regulations. There is a minimum wage of $13.73 per hour for seasonal and small employers who employ fewer than 6 people.\n\nNorth Carolina. Tip credit is not permitted unless the employer obtains from each employee, either monthly or each pay period, a signed certification of the amount of tips received. Employers must notify employees in advance of the amount of cash wages they will be paid and the amount that wages will be increased using the tip credit.\n\nOhio. For employees of employers with gross annual sales of less than $385,000, the state minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.\n\nOklahoma. For employers with fewer than 10 full-time employees at any one location who have gross annual sales of $100,000 or less, the basic minimum rate is $2.00 per hour. Employers with ten or more full time employees at any one location or annual gross sales over $100,000 that are not covered by the FLSA can take a tip credit of no more than 50 percent ($3.62) of the applicable minimum wage of $7.25. The State law excludes from coverage any employment that is subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nWest Virginia. The state minimum wage law applies only to employers with six or more employees and to state agencies.\n\nWisconsin. $5.90 per hour may be paid to \"opportunity employees\" -- employees who are not yet 20 years old and who have been in employment status with a particular employer for 90 or fewer consecutive calendar days from the date of initial employment. Additionally, a cash wage of $2.13 per hour may be paid to an opportunity employee who is a tipped employee.\n\nThe following states do not have state minimum wage laws: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Georgia has a state minimum wage law, but it does not apply to tipped employees. Employers in these states must pay employees covered by the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act at least the federal minimum wage.\n\nNevada. Effective July 1, 2024, there is a uniform minimum wage of $12.00 per hour for all employees.\n\nUS Virgin Islands. The Wage Board has been authorized since 2020 to increase the minimum cash wage for tipped tourist service and restaurant employees to a rate not greater than 45% of the minimum wage or less than the federal minimum wage for tipped employees.\n\nWyoming. The Wyoming minimum wage is $5.15 per hour. Employers must pay employees covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act at least the federal minimum wage.\n\nConnecticut. The Connecticut minimum wage is adjusted annually based on a set formula.\n\nDistrict of Columbia.

Additionally, the District of Columbia minimum wage is adjusted annually on July 1 based on a set formula.\n\nThe minimum wage laws in Kansas, Oklahoma (see note 6), Texas, and Utah exclude from coverage any employment that is subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nFlorida.
