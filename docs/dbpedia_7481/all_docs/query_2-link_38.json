You can find the full report, Excel data, and PowerPoint presentation in the Resources section at the bottom of this page.\n\nPublished or Sticker Prices\n\nIn 2023-24, the average published (sticker) tuition and fees for full-time students are:\n\nPublic four-year in-state: $11,260, $270 higher than in 2022-23 (2.5% before adjusting for inflation).\n\nPublic four-year out-of-state: $29,150, $850 higher than in 2022-23 (3.0% before adjusting for inflation).\n\nPublic two-year in-district: $3,990, $100 higher than in 2022-23 (2.6% before adjusting for inflation).\n\nPrivate nonprofit four-year: $41,540, $1,600 higher than in 2022-23 (4.0% before adjusting for inflation).\n\nOne Price Doesn't Fit All\n\nPublished college prices vary widely, depending on the type of institution and where it's located.\n\nAcross the United States, average 2023-24 public two-year in-district tuition and fees range from $1,440 in California and $2,130 in New Mexico to $8,660 in Vermont.\n\nAverage 2023-24 public four-year in-state tuition and fees range from $6,360 in Florida and $6,700 in Wyoming to $17,170 in New Hampshire and $17,180 in Vermont.\n\nNet Prices\n\nThe majority of full-time undergraduate students receive grant aid that helps them pay for college.\n\nSince 2009-10, first-time full-time students at public two-year colleges have been receiving enough grant aid on average to cover their tuition and fees.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the average net tuition and fee price paid by first-time full-time in-state students enrolled in public four-year institutions peaked in 2012-13 at $4,230 (in 2023 dollars) and declined to an estimated $2,730 in 2023-24.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the average net tuition and fee price paid by first-time full-time students enrolled in private nonprofit four-year institutions declined from $18,820 (in 2023 dollars) in 2006-07 to an estimated $15,910 in 2023-24.\n\nFamily Income\n\nThe income gap between families with the lowest and highest incomes is growing.\n\nBetween 1992 and 2022, the average income increased by 65% for the top quintile of families and by 27% for the lowest quintile of families.\n\nInstitutional Finances\n\nThe national average state and local funding per student increased in 2021-22 (in inflation-adjusted dollars) for the tenth consecutive year. State and local funding per student reached $10,240 in 2021-22, the highest level since 1999-2000.\n\nEnrollment\n\nBetween fall 2019 and 2021, total enrollment fell by 947,000 (5%). The public two-year sector saw the largest decline in enrollment—883,000 (13%). Total enrollment declined by 75,000 (1%) in the public four-year sector and by 2,000 (<1%) in the private nonprofit four-year sector; it increased by 12,000 (1%) in the for-profit sector."
