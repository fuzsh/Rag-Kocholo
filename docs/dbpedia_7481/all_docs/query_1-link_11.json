        "text": "More than worthy addition to my Gaslight London list despite some shaky plot points and a lamentable absence of fog. Peter Lawford (England’s preemptive answer to Patrick O’Neal) is a gentleman thief who comes under suspicion of being the psychopath who has been stabbing members of the constabulary when the two of them, naturally, strike at some time and place. Some mostly rote cat-and-mouse and romancing-the-commissioner’s-daughter doings follow before a surprisingly strong climactic fight between Lawford and the killer in a deserted wharf-side warehouse. As implied I am an ardent devotee of the genre and that would have been enough to ensure a viewing so the presence of Roland Culver as—what else?—the inspector in charge was a welcomed bonus and although he fills the role with his customary assured understatement it doesn’t merit inclusion in anyone’s An Inspector Calls list.\n\nPeter Lawford continues to be a box office disappointment for MGM, even when it's their UK division handling the film. This one didn't deserve it's faith, for it's a very polished and elegant investigation, that entertains majority of the way. Sure, it's not a mystery with a X-factor, but for a lighter affair it does a swell job of being charming and compelling at the same time. Good one for Lawford, for sure.\n\nNot a particularly memorable entry into that glorious subgenre of classic films set in London at the end of the 19th Century; it just doesn’t have the atmosphere of The Lodger, Victor Fleming’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Hangover Square, or Man in the Attic. Still, Peter Lawford is fun as the dashing jewel thief, and there’s an entertainingly vertiginous finale.\n\nWhen jewel thieves get tangled up in a serial killer targeting policemen, I feel like the end result should be more interesting than this turns out to be. Partially, it feels like there's a lack of personality or charisma, and so while some elements of the plot are interesting when it comes to planning, it all feels rather impersonal."
