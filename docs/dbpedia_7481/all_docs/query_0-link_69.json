        "text": "Situation Summary\n\nThe fire continues to burn very actively. With the steep terrain, wind activity and many inaccessible areas, the fire is making uphill runs and spot fires continue to occur. Critically low fuel moistures and high winds have caused difficulty in suppressing the fire spread.\n\nWinds will be about 5 miles per hour lighter today, still out of the southwest with gusts up to 15 miles per hour. Daytime temperatures continue to climb a couple of degrees each day.\n\nThe perimeter of the Park Fire is 260 miles which means it has burned more than 3 times the surface area of Lake Tahoe.\n\nFire crews are providing structure defense where needed, they are attempting to complete containment lines in some areas and gain a stronghold in the challenging topography while also engaging in mop-up where applicable.\n\nThe current acreage is 383,619 total:\n\nButte County: 53,104 acres\n\nTehama County: 330,515 acres\n\nFire Integrated Real-Time Intelligence System Program (FIRIS) aircraft is flying over the fire, mapping acreage which will allow for periodic acreage updates.\n\nWe ask that the public continue to be diligent and prepared due to the continued erratic fire activity.\n\nDamage inspection teams continue to complete more inspections within the current fire perimeter and continue to identify and verify structures that have been damaged or destroyed. The number of structures reported continue to adjust as the inspection team verifies impacts."
