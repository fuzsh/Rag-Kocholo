        "text": "Time zones\n\nThe world is divided up into about 24 time zones. We say about because some states, regions and countries shift their times by 1/2 hour from the strict 24-hour divisions. Standard time within most time zones is a certain whole number of hours offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), maintained by a large number of very precise atomic clocks kept at laboratories around the world, including the U.S. Naval Observatory. UTC is the successor to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), although their exact definitions differ. By the way, the worldwide community of scientists no longer use GMT.\n\nLooking for a time zone converter? Here’s a handy one at WorldTimeBuddy.com\n\nTranslate UTC into your local time\n\nUnited States\n\nAtlantic Daylight Time| subtract 3 hours from UTC\n\nAtlantic Standard Time| subtract 4 hours from UTC\n\nEastern Daylight Time| subtract 4 hours from UTC\n\nEastern Standard Time| subtract 5 hours from UTC\n\nCentral Daylight Time| subtract 5 hours from UTC\n\nCentral Standard Time| subtract 6 hours from UTC\n\nMountain Daylight Time| subtract 6 hours from UTC\n\nMountain Standard Time| subtract 7 hours from UTC\n\nPacific Daylight Time| subtract 7 hours from UTC\n\nPacific Standard Time| subtract 8 hours from UTC\n\nAlaska Daylight Time| subtract 8 hours from UTC\n\nAlaska Standard Time| subtract 9 hours from UTC\n\nHawaii-Aleutian Standard Time| subtract 10 hours from UTC\n\nSamoa Standard Time| subtract 11 hours from UTC\n\nEurope/Middle East\n\nGreenwich Mean Time| same as UTC\n\nBritish Summer Time| add 1 hour to UTC\n\nCentral European Time| add 1 hour to UTC\n\nCentral European Summer Time| add 2 hours to UTC\n\nEastern European Time| add 2 hours to UTC\n\nEastern European Summer Time| add 3 hours to UTC\n\nCharlie Time (middle east)| add 3 hours to UTC\n\nDelta Time (middle east)| add 4 hours to UTC\n\nAustralia\n\nWestern Standard Time| add 8 hours to UTC (Summer Time is not used in Western Australia)\n\nCentral Standard Time| add 9:30 hours to UTC\n\nCentral Summer Time| add 10:30 hours to UTC\n\nEastern Time| add 10 hours to UTC\n\nEastern Summer Time| add 11 hours to UTC\n\nFor Asian, African and South American time zones visit WorldTimeZones.com\n\nExamples of how to convert UTC to your local time\n\nLet’s say you live in Houston, Texas, which is in United States Central Standard Time. To convert 18:00 UTC (6:00 p.m.) into your local time, subtract 6 hours, to get 12 noon CST. During daylight saving (summer) time, you would only subtract 5 hours, so 18:00 UTC would convert to 1:00 p.m CDT. Note that the U.S. uses a 12-hour format with a.m. and p.m.\n\nOther countries use 24-hour time. Let’s say you’re in Paris, France, which is in Central European Time. To convert 18:00 UTC into your local time, add 1 hour, to get 19:00 CET. In summer, add 2 hours to get 20:00 CEST.\n\nWhen converting a zone time to or from UTC, dates must be properly taken into account. For example, 10 March at 02:00 UTC (2:00 a.m.) is the same as March 9 at 9:00 p.m. EST (U.S.).\n\nAbout the International Date Line\n\nThe table is also useful to determine the difference between the time observed in any two zones. For example, the table shows that Eastern Standard Time is three hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time (U.S.). WorldTimeBuddy.com enables you to select up to four time zones to convert.\n\nBottom line: The Earth has about 24 time zones, but when scientists mention a time, it’s almost always Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Here’s how to translate UTC to your local time zone."
