        "text": "This page describes the calculations used to convert greenhouse gas emission numbers into different types of equivalent units. Go to the equivalencies calculator page for more information.\n\nA note on global warming potentials (GWPs): Some of the equivalencies in the calculator are reported as CO2 equivalents (CO2E). These are calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), except for the equivalencies that are calculated using the Waste Reduction Model (WARM) because the model uses the Fourth Assessment Report (tons of waste recycled instead of landfilled, GHG emissions avoided by recycling X garbage trucks or railcars full of waste, and trash bags of waste recycled instead of landfilled). To facilitate user reproducibility calculations that use data from WARM, the input data were not modified to reflect GWPs from AR5.\n\nElectricity reductions (kilowatt-hours)\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator uses the AVoided Emissions and geneRation Tool (AVERT) U.S. national weighted average CO2 marginal emission rate to convert reductions of kilowatt-hours into avoided units of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nMost users of the Equivalencies Calculator who seek equivalencies for electricity-related emissions want to know equivalencies for emissions reductions from energy efficiency (EE) or renewable energy (RE) programs. Calculating the emission impacts of EE and RE on the electricity grid requires estimating the amount of fossil-fired generation and emissions being displaced by EE and RE. A marginal emission factor is the best representation to estimate which fossil-fired units EE/RE are displacing across the fossil fleet. EE and RE programs are not generally assumed to affect baseload power plants that run all the time, but rather marginal power plants that are brought online as necessary to meet demand. Therefore, AVERT provides a national marginal emission factor for the Equivalencies Calculator.\n\nEmission Factor\n\n1,540.1 lbs CO2/MWh × 1 metric ton/2,204.6 lbs × 0.001 MWh/kWh = 6.99 × 10-4 metric tons CO2/kWh\n\n(AVERT, U.S. national weighted average CO2 marginal emission rate, year 2021 data)\n\nNotes:\n\nThis calculation does not include any greenhouse gases other than CO2.\n\nThis calculation includes line losses.\n\nRegional marginal emission rates are also available on the AVERT web page.\n\nSources\n\nEPA (2022) AVERT, U.S. national weighted average CO2 marginal emission rate, year 2021 data. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC.\n\nElectricity consumed (kilowatt-hours)\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator uses the eGRID U.S. national annual average CO2 output rate to convert kilowatt-hours of energy use into units of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThis calculation is intended for users who would like to know the equivalencies associated with greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity consumed, not reduced. This is a national average emissions factor.\n\nEmission Factor\n\n852.3 lbs CO2/MWh × 1 metric ton/2,204.6 lbs × 1/(1-0.073) MWh delivered/MWh generated × 1 MWh/1,000 kWh = 4.17 × 10-4 metric tons CO2/kWh\n\n(eGRID, U.S. annual CO2 total output emission rate [lb/MWh], year 2021 data)\n\nNotes:\n\nThis calculation does not include any greenhouse gases other than CO2.\n\nThis calculation includes line losses.\n\nRegional average emission rates are also available on the eGRID web page.\n\nSources\n\nEIA (2022a). 2022 Annual Energy Outlook, Table 4: Residential Sector Key Indicators and Consumption.\n\nEIA (2022b). 2022 Annual Energy Outlook, Table 8: Electricity Supply, Disposition, Prices, and Emissions.\n\nEPA (2021). eGRID.

The average vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in 2021 was 10,746 miles per year and is assumed to be the same for electric cars (FHWA 2023). The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per MWh is 857.0 pounds (EPA 2023).\n\nTo determine annual greenhouse gas emissions per all-electric passenger vehicle, the following methodology was used: VMT was divided by the average miles per kWh to determine kWh consumed per vehicle per year. Then, kWh consumed were converted to MWh consumed by multiplying the ratio of MWh to kWh. Electricity consumed was multiplied by pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per MWh to determine carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per vehicle per year.

Nationwide household consumption of natural gas, propane, and fuel oil totaled 5.01, 0.48, and 0.42 quadrillion Btu, respectively, in 2021 (EIA 2022a). Averaged across households in the United States, this amounts to 38,567 cubic feet of natural gas, 41.9 gallons of propane, and 24.2 gallons of fuel oil per home.\n\nThe national average carbon dioxide output rate for generated electricity in 2021 was 852.3 lbs CO2 per megawatt-hour (EPA 2023a), which translates to about 919.1 lbs CO2 per megawatt-hour for delivered electricity (assuming transmission and distribution losses of 7.3%) (EPA 2023a; EIA 2022b).1\n\nThe average carbon dioxide coefficient of natural gas is 0.0550 kg CO2 per cubic foot (EIA 2023).

These estimates are based on the following assumptions:\n\nThe medium growth coniferous and deciduous trees are raised in a nursery for one year until they become 1 inch in diameter at 4.5 feet above the ground (the size of tree purchased in a 15-gallon container).\n\nThe nursery-grown trees are then planted in a suburban/urban setting; the trees are not densely planted.\n\nThe calculation takes into account “survival factors” developed by U.S. DOE (1998). For example, after 5 years (one year in the nursery and 4 in the urban setting), the probability of survival is 68 percent; after 10 years, the probability declines to 59 percent. To estimate losses of growing trees, in lieu of a census conducted to accurately account for the total amount of seedlings planted versus surviving to a certain age, the sequestration rate (in lbs per tree) is multiplied by the survival factor to yield a probability-weighted sequestration rate. These values are summed for the 10-year period, beginning from the time of planting, to derive the estimate of 23.2 lbs of carbon per coniferous tree or 38.0 lbs of carbon per deciduous tree.\n\nThe estimates of carbon sequestered by coniferous and deciduous trees were then weighted by the percent share of coniferous versus deciduous trees in cities across the United States. Of a sample of approximately 11,000 coniferous and deciduous trees in seventeen major U.S. cities, approximately 11 percent and 89 percent of sampled trees were coniferous and deciduous, respectively (McPherson et al. 2016). Therefore, the weighted average carbon sequestered by a medium growth coniferous or deciduous tree, planted in an urban setting and allowed to grow for 10 years, is 36.4 lbs of carbon per tree.\n\nPlease note the following caveats to these assumptions:\n\nWhile most trees take 1 year in a nursery to reach the seedling stage, trees grown under different conditions and trees of certain species may take longer: up to 6 years.\n\nAverage survival rates in urban areas are based on broad assumptions, and the rates will vary significantly depending upon site conditions.\n\nCarbon sequestration is dependent on growth rate, which varies by location and other conditions.\n\nThis method estimates only direct sequestration of carbon, and does not include the energy savings that result from buildings being shaded by urban tree cover.\n\nThis method is best used as an estimation for suburban/urban areas (i.e., parks, along sidewalks, yards) with highly dispersed tree plantings and is not appropriate for reforestation projects.\n\nTo convert to units of metric tons CO2 per tree, multiply by the ratio of the molecular weight of carbon dioxide to that of carbon (44/12) and the ratio of metric tons per pound (1/2,204.6).\n\nCalculation\n\nNote: Due to rounding, performing the calculations given in the equations below may not return the exact results shown.\n\n(0.11 [percent of coniferous trees in sampled urban settings] × 23.2 lbs C/coniferous tree) + (0.89 [percent of deciduous trees in sampled urban settings] × 38.0 lbs C/deciduous tree) = 36.4 lbs C/tree\n\n36.4 lbs C/tree × (44 units CO2/12 units C) × 1 metric ton/2,204.6 lbs = 0.060 metric ton CO2 per urban tree planted\n\nSources\n\nMcPherson, E.

Please refer to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 for a discussion of the definition of U.S. forests and methodology for estimating carbon stored in U.S. forests (EPA 2023).\n\nGrowing forests accumulate and store carbon. Through the process of photosynthesis, trees remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it as cellulose, lignin, and other compounds. The rate of accumulation of carbon in a forested landscape is equal to overall tree growth minus removals (i.e., harvest for the production of paper and wood and tree loss from natural disturbances) minus decomposition. In most U.S. forests, growth exceeds removals and decomposition, so the amount of carbon stored nationally in forested lands is increasing overall, though at a decreasing rate.\n\nCalculation for U.S. Forests\n\nThe Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 (EPA 2023) provides data on the net change in forest carbon stocks and forest area.\n\nAnnual Net Change in Carbon Stocks per Area in Year t = (Carbon Stocks(t+1) - Carbon Stockst)/Area of land remaining in the same land-use category\n\nStep 1: Determine the carbon stock change between years by subtracting carbon stocks in year t from carbon stocks in year (t+1). This calculation, also found in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 (EPA 2023), uses the USDA Forest Service estimates of carbon stocks in 2021 minus carbon stocks in 2020. (This calculation includes carbon stocks in the aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic and mineral carbon pools. C gains attributed to harvested wood products are not included in this calculation.)\n\nAnnual Net Change in Carbon Stocks in Year 2021 = 56,951 MMT C – 56,790 MMT C = 162 MMT C\n\nStep 2: Determine the annual net change in carbon stocks (i.e., sequestration) per area by dividing the carbon stock change in U.S. forests from Step 1 by the total area of U.S. forests remaining in forests in year t (i.e., the area of land that did not change land-use categories between the time periods).\n\nApplying the Step 2 calculation to data developed by the USDA Forest Service for the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 yields a result of 203 metric tons of carbon per hectare (or 82 metric tons of carbon per acre) for the carbon stock density of U.S. forests in 2021, with an annual net change in carbon stock per area in 2021 of 0.58 metric tons of carbon sequestered per hectare per year (or 0.23 metric tons of carbon sequestered per acre per year).\n\nNote: Due to rounding, performing the calculations given in the equations below may not return the exact results shown.\n\nCarbon Stock Density in Year 2021 = (56,951 MMT C × 106) / (279,962 thou. hectares × 103) = 203 metric tons of carbon stored per hectare\n\nAnnual Net Change in Carbon Stock per Area in Year 2021 = (-162 MMT C × 106) / (279,962 thou. hectares × 103) = -0.58 metric tons of carbon sequestered per hectare per year*\n\n*Negative values indicate carbon sequestration.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2021, the average annual sequestration of carbon per area was 0.59 metric tons C/hectare/year (or 0.24 metric tons C/acre/year) in the United States, with a minimum value of 0.53 metric tons C/hectare/year (or 0.22 metric tons C/acre/year) in 2015, and a maximum value of 0.63 metric tons C/hectare/year (or 0.26 metric tons C/acre/year) in 2016.\n\nThese values include carbon in the five forest pools: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead wood, litter, and soil organic and mineral carbon, and are based on state-level Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Forest carbon stocks and carbon stock change are based on the stock difference methodology and algorithms described by Smith, Heath, and Nichols (2010).\n\nConversion Factor for Carbon Sequestered in One Year by 1 Acre of Average U.S. Forest\n\nNote: Due to rounding, performing the calculations given in the equations below may not return the exact results shown.\n\n-0.23 metric ton C/acre/year* × (44 units CO2/12 units C) = -0.86 metric ton CO2/acre/year sequestered annually by one acre of average U.S. forest.\n\n*Negative values indicate carbon sequestration.\n\nPlease note that this is an estimate for “average” U.S. forests from 2020 to 2021; i.e., the annual net change in carbon stock for U.S. forests as a whole between 2020 and 2021. Significant geographical variations underlie the national estimates, and the values calculated here might not be representative of individual regions, states, or changes in the species composition of additional acres of forest.\n\nTo estimate carbon sequestered (in metric tons of CO2) by additional \"average\" forestry acres in one year, multiply the number of additional acres by -0.86 metric ton CO2 acre/year.\n\nSources\n\nEPA (2023).

Please refer to the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 for a discussion of the definition of U.S. forests and methodology for estimating carbon stored in U.S. forests (EPA 2023).\n\nBased on data developed by the USDA Forest Service for the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021, the carbon stock density of U.S. forests in 2021 was 203 metric tons of carbon per hectare (or 83 metric tons of carbon per acre) (EPA 2023). This estimate is composed of the five carbon pools: aboveground biomass (56 metric tons C/hectare), belowground biomass (11 metric tons C/hectare), dead wood (10 metric tons C/hectare), litter (14 metric tons C/hectare), and soil carbon, which includes mineral soils (93 metric tons C/hectare) and organic soils (19 metric tons C/hectare).\n\nThe Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 estimates soil carbon stock changes using U.S.-specific equations, IPCC guidelines, and data from the USDA Natural Resource Inventory and the DayCent biogeochemical model (EPA 2023). When calculating carbon stock changes in biomass due to conversion from forestland to development, the 2019 IPCC Refinement indicates that the average carbon stock change is equal to the carbon stock change due to removal of biomass from the outgoing land use (i.e., forestland) plus the carbon stocks from one year of growth in the incoming land use (i.e., development), or the carbon in biomass immediately after the conversion minus the carbon in biomass prior to the conversion plus the carbon stocks from one year of growth in the incoming land use (IPCC 2019). All of the biomass carbon from the outgoing land use is assumed to be lost in the year the land use change occurs for conversion to development; therefore the carbon stock in annual development biomass after one year is conservatively estimated to be 0 metric tons C per hectare (IPCC 2019).\n\nThe averaged reference soil carbon stock (for high-activity clay, low-activity clay, sandy soils, and histosols for all climate regions in the United States) is 40.83 metric tons C/hectare (EPA 2022). Carbon stock change in soils is time-dependent, with a default time period for transition between equilibrium soil carbon values of 20 years for soils in cropland systems (IPCC 2006). Consequently, it is assumed that the change in equilibrium soil carbon will be annualized over 20 years to represent the annual flux in mineral and organic soils.\n\nOrganic soils also emit CO2 when drained. Emissions from drained organic soils in forestland and drained organic soils in cropland vary based on the drainage depth and climate (IPCC 2006). The Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2021 estimates emissions from drained organic soils using U.S.-specific emission factors for cropland and IPCC (2014) default emission factors for forestland (EPA 2022).\n\nThe annual change in emissions from one hectare of drained organic soils can be calculated as the difference between the emission factors for forest soils and development soils. The emission factors for drained organic soil on temperate forestland are 2.60 metric tons C/hectare/year and 0.31 metric tons C/hectare/year (EPA 2022, IPCC 2014), and the average emission factor for drained organic soil on development for all climate regions is 13.17 metric tons C/hectare/year (EPA 2022).\n\nThe IPCC (2006) Guidelines assume that all deadwood and litter carbon are lost in conversion to development and do not subsequently accumulate, hence the carbon stocks for these pools after conversion is assumed to be 0 (IPCC 2006).\n\nCalculation for Converting U.S. Forests to U.S. Cropland\n\nAnnual Change in Biomass Carbon Stocks on Land Converted to Other Land-Use Category\n\n∆CB = ∆CG + CConversion - ∆CL\n\nWhere:\n\n∆CB = annual change in carbon stocks in biomass on land converted to another land-use category (i.e., change in biomass on land converted from forest to development)\n\n∆CG = annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass due to growth on land converted to another land-use category (i.e., 2.25 metric tons C/hectare on cropland one year after conversion from forestland)\n\nCConversion =initial change in carbon stocks in biomass on land converted to another land-use category. The sum of the carbon stocks in aboveground, belowground, dead wood, and litter biomass (-91.29 metric tons C/hectare). Immediately after conversion from forestland to development, the carbon stock of aboveground biomass is assumed to be zero, as the land is cleared of all vegetation for development)\n\n∆CL = annual decrease in biomass stocks due to losses from harvesting, fuel wood gathering, and disturbances on land converted to other land-use category (assumed to be zero)\n\nTherefore: ∆CB = ∆CG + CConversion - ∆CL = -91.29 metric tons C/hectare/year of biomass carbon stocks are lost when forestland is converted to development in the year of conversion.\n\nAnnual Change in Organic Carbon Stocks in Mineral and Organic Soils\n\n∆CSoil = (SOC0 - SOC(0-T))/D\n\nWhere:\n\n∆CSoil = annual change in carbon stocks in mineral and organic soils\n\nSOC0 = soil organic carbon stock in last year of inventory time period (i.e., 41.63 mt/hectare, the average reference soil carbon stock)\n\nSOC(0-T) = soil organic carbon stock at beginning of inventory time period (i.e., 112 mt C/hectare, which includes 93 mt C/hectare in mineral soils plus 19 mt C/hectare in organic soils)\n\nD = Time dependence of stock change factors which is the default time period for transition between equilibrium SOC values (i.e., 20 years for cropland systems)\n\nTherefore: ∆CSoil = (SOC0 - SOC(0-T))/D = (40.63 - 112)/20 = -3.54 metric tons C/hectare/year of soil C lost.\n\nSource: (IPCC 2006).\n\nAnnual Change in Emissions from Drained Organic Soils\n\nThe Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2020 uses default IPCC (2014) factors for drained organic soil on forestland and U.S.-specific factors for cropland. The change in emissions from drained organic soils per hectare is estimated as the difference between emission factors for drained organic forest soils and drained organic development soils.\n\n∆LOrganic = EFcropland – EFforestland\n\nWhere:\n\n∆LOrganic = Annual change in emissions from drained organic soils per hectare\n\nEFcropland= 13.17 metric tons C/hectare/year (average of emission factors for drained organic cropland soils in sub-tropical, cold temperate, and warm temperate climates in the United States) (EPA 2022)\n\nEFforestland= 2.60 + 0.31 = 2.91 metric tons C/hectare/year (emission factors for temperate drained organic forest soils) (IPCC 2014)\n\n∆Lorganic = 13.17 - 2.91 = 10.26 metric tons C/hectare/year emitted\n\nConsequently, the change in carbon density from converting forestland to cropland would be -89.08 metric tons of C/hectare/year of biomass plus -3.54 metric tons C/hectare/year of soil C, minus 10.26 metric tons C/hectare/year from drained organic soils, equaling a total loss of 102.87 metric tons C/hectare/year (or -41.63 metric tons C/acre/year) in the year of conversion. To convert to carbon dioxide, multiply by the ratio of the molecular weight of carbon dioxide to that of carbon (44/12), to yield a value of -377.19 metric tons CO2/hectare/year (or -152.65 metric tons CO2/acre/year) in the year of conversion.\n\nConversion Factor for Carbon Sequestered by 1 Acre of Forest Preserved from Conversion to Cropland\n\nNote: Due to rounding, performing the calculations given in the equations below may not return the exact results shown.\n\n-42.52 metric tons C/acre/year* x (44 units CO2/12 units C) = -155.92 metric tons CO2/acre/year (in the year of conversion)\n\n*Negative values indicate CO2 that is NOT emitted.\n\nTo estimate CO2 not emitted when an acre of forest is preserved from conversion to development, multiply the number of acres of forest not converted by -155.92 mt CO2/acre/year. Note that this represents CO2 avoided in the year of conversion. Please also note that this calculation method assumes that all of the forest biomass is oxidized during clearing (i.e., none of the burned biomass remains as charcoal or ash) and does not include any carbon stored in harvested wood products post-harvest. Also note that this estimate includes both mineral soil and organic soil carbon stocks.\n\nSources\n\nEPA (2022). Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2020.

To obtain the amount of energy consumed to charge the smartphone, subtract the amount of energy consumed in “maintenance mode” (0.0415 Watts times 22 hours) from the 24-hour energy consumed (22.596 Watt-hours).\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions per smartphone charged were determined by multiplying the energy use per smartphone charged by the national weighted average carbon dioxide marginal emission rate for delivered electricity. The national weighted average carbon dioxide marginal emission rate for delivered electricity in 2021 was 1,540.1 lbs CO2 per megawatt-hour, which accounts for losses during transmission and distribution (EPA 2023).\n\nCalculation\n\nNote: Due to rounding, performing the calculations given in the equations below may not return the exact results shown.\n\n[22.596 Wh – (22 hours x 0.0415 Watts)] x 1 kWh/1,000 Wh = 0.022 kWh/smartphone charged\n\n0.022 kWh/charge x 1,540.1 pounds CO2/MWh delivered electricity x 1 MWh/1,000 kWh x 1 metric ton/2,204.6 lbs = 1.51 x 10-5 metric tons CO2/smartphone charged\n\nSources"
