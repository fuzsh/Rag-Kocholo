        "text": "Guidelines for Leaving Your Child Alone\n\nGuidelines for Leaving Your Child Alone\n\nDeciding when your child is ready to stay home alone is a difficult decision for parents. There is no set age, either prescribed by law or by child development experts. It comes down to a judgment call on the part of parents.\n\nFortunately, there are some guidelines and certain factors to consider, as well as things to do if you decide to leave your children home alone\n\nTo decide if your child can take care of himself or herself, consider:\n\nThe child's age. Experts believe there is no one age that can decide whether a child can be left alone or allowed to care for a younger child. These questions vary by child and are subject to cultural and community-specific variations. Some children who are school-ready may be old enough to be alone briefly or may safely play outside or walk to school while other children are not ready even when they are teenagers.\n\nThe child's maturity. Can your child think things through, plan ahead, and make good decisions.\n\nThe child's ability to handle urgent situations. Your child should show good judgment and follow your rules. Your child should know how to get help, what to do in a fire, how to deal with visitors and callers, etc.\n\nThe environment. Is it safe? Are there people nearby who can be trusted to watch out for your child?\n\nHow long your child will be alone. An hour or two might be fine; a day may be too long.\n\nThe child's feelings. If your child is nervous about being alone or isn't sure he or she can handle certain situations, your child is not ready.\n\nIf you feel your child can stay alone, give your child what he or she needs to be safe, including: The house key. Have your child keep it in a safe, but hidden place, like a zippered part of your child's backpack.\n\nPhone numbers. Post a phone number where you can be reached and numbers of two neighbors who are likely to be home and who have agreed to look out for your child. Let your neighbor's know what time your child comes home from school.\n\nSafety rules.\n\nWhen home alone, your child should:\n\nnot enter the house if he or she sees something suspicious (e.g. an open door, broken window, strange people). The child should go to a neighbor's house, call 911, then you and not let anyone in. Delivery people can be told to go to a neighbor's house and repair people can come back.\n\nnot tell anyone he or she is home alone. If someone calls, your child can say, \"My mother (father) can't come to the phone right now. Can I take a message?\"\n\nnot go to anyone's house without your permission.\n\nSchedule a time each day to check in with one another.\n\nTeach your child:\n\nWhen to call 911 and what to say.\n\nHow to prevent fires and what to do if one breaks out (E.g. get out of the house fast and call 911 from a neighbor's house).\n\nBasic first aid (some towns offer courses for children). Some towns and employers offer a \"home alone\" class for children; ask your town recreation department, school or employer.\n\nTry leaving your child home alone for an hour or two and see how he or she does before you do it long term.\n\nEach day, talk to your child about what he or she did during the day. Ask your child often how he or she feels about staying home alone. Review safety rules.\n\nIf you, or your child have any doubts, it is best to make other arrangements. Maybe another parent, college student, or local after-school program can help out.\n\nIf you need to find care for your child, check with INFOLINE (2-1-1), your relatives, neighbors and friends, your child's school, your city or town parks and recreation department, or a local YMCA/YWCA.\n\nSee Also\n\nFactSheet for Families \"Leaving Your Child Home Alone\" (U.S. Departmentof Health and Human Services)"
