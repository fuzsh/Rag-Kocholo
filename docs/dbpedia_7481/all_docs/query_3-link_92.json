Part of this process involves recognizing the power of my culturally distinct voice and perspective. I believe that representation is important for both people within the Asian American and Pacific Islander community and for those who may be less familiar with the cultures that fall under AAPI.”\n\nJanette Ozoa, Speech Language Pathologist, Homecare Therapies\n\n“My passion is to make sure that every person I meet knows that someone cares, they matter and that they feel loved. You never know how one smile or kind word can change the direction of a person’s day or life. I feel like this love for people is what helps me be a nurse.”\n\nChristmas Booth, Ambulatory RN, Immunodeficiency Clinic\n\n“I was born and raised in Egypt, a country where children face many challenges, including social deprivation, malnutrition and poor medical conditions from the day they are born. It seemed natural to me to choose health care and pediatrics as a career path that would give me the opportunity to address these challenges.”\n\nGamal Mashali, Pediatric Endocrinologist, Nationwide Children’s Hospital - Toledo"
