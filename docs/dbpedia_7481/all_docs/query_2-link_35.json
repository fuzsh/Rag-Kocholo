        "text": "Did You Know...\n\nWho designed the West Pediment?\n\nA native of San Francisco, California, Robert Aitken (1878-1949) studied sculpture in Paris before settling in New York City, where he became one of the top American sculptors of the early 20th century. Cass Gilbert, the architect of the Supreme Court Building, selected Aitken to design the West Pediment writing, “I expect a masterpiece from you!” He also expressed his wish that it be a “composition...worthy of the great Supreme Court – stately, serene, calm, well balanced and yet vital and interesting.” Aitken met this lofty goal, and did so using the faces of actual people in his work, including himself!"
