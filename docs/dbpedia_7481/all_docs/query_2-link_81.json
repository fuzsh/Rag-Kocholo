        "text": "Florida Resident\n\nA Florida “resident for tuition purposes” is a person who has, or a dependent person whose parent or legal guardian has, established and maintained legal residence in Florida for at least twelve months. Residence in Florida must be as a bona fide domicile rather than for the purpose of maintaining a residence incident to enrollment at an institution of higher education. To qualify as a Florida resident for tuition purposes, you must be a U.S. Citizen, permanent resident alien, or legal alien granted indefinite stay by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Other persons meeting the twelve-month legal residence requirement may be classified as Florida residents for tuition purposes only if they fall into one of the limited special categories authorized by the Florida Legislature and Florida Board of Education. All other persons are ineligible for classification as a Florida “resident for tuition purposes.” Living in or attending school in Florida will not, in itself, establish legal residence. Students who depend on out-of-state parents for support are presumed to be legal residents of the same state as their parents.\n\nThe determination of dependent or independent status is important because it is the basis for whether the student has to submit his/her own documentation of residency (as an independent) or his/her parent's or guardian's documentation of residency (as a dependent).\n\nRequired Documentation\n\nAt least one item must be from this list:\n\nA Florida voter's registration card.\n\nA Florida driver's license.\n\nA State of Florida identification card.\n\nA Florida vehicle registration.\n\nProof of a permanent home in Florida which is occupied as a primary residence by the individual or by the individual's parent if the individual is a dependent child.\n\nProof of a homestead exemption in Florida.\n\nTranscripts from a Florida high school for multiple years (2 or more years) if the Florida high school diploma or GED was earned within the last 12 months.\n\nProof of permanent full-time employment in Florida for at least 30 hours per week for a consecutive 12-month period.\n\nItems listed below may be used in conjunction with one document from the above list:\n\nA declaration of domicile in Florida.\n\nA Florida professional or occupational license.\n\nFlorida incorporation.\n\nA document evidencing verifiable family ties to a Florida resident, as defined by tuition purposes.\n\nProof of membership in a Florida-based charitable or professional organization.\n\nAny other documentation that supports the student's request for resident status, including, but not limited to, utility bills and proof of 12 consecutive months of payments; a lease agreement and proof of 12 consecutive months of payments; or an official state, federal, or court document evidencing legal ties to Florida.\n\nExceptions and Qualifications\n\nQualified beneficiaries under the Stanley G.

See Section 7.0, Immigration and International Student Issues, for more information on Linkage Institutes. [s. 288.8175(5), F.S.].\n\nDependent Student\n\nA student, whether or not living with his or her parent, who is eligible to be claimed by his or her parent under the federal income tax code shall be classified as a dependent student.\n\nParent. “Parent” means either or both parents of a student, any guardian of a student, or any person in a parental relationship to the student.” [s. 1009.21(1)(f), F.S.]\n\nIn order to be considered a “qualifying child” or “dependent” for federal income tax code purposes, the following must be true:\n\nThe child must be your son, daughter, or stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them.\n\nThe child must be one of the following:\n\nunder age 19 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly),\n\nunder age 24 at the end of the year and a full-time student and younger than you (or your spouse, if filing jointly), or\n\nany age if permanently and totally disabled.\n\nThe child must have lived with you for more than half of the year subject to IRS exceptions.\n\nThe child must not have provided more than half of his/her own support for the year.\n\nThe child is not filing a joint return for the year (unless that joint return is filed only as a claim for refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid).\n\nSome individuals cannot be claimed as a dependent.

Also, to claim someone as a dependent, that person must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, U.S. national or resident of Canada or Mexico for some part of the year. There is an exception to this rule for certain adopted children. See IRS Publication 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information for additional tests to determine who can be claimed as a dependent.\n\nEvidence that the student meets one of these criteria will be requested by the higher education institution. A student who does not meet one of the criteria outlined in section 3.1 may be classified as an independent student only if he or she submits documentation that he or she provides more than fifty (50) percent of the cost of attendance for independent, in-state students as defined by the institution.\n\nPlease note: All residency reclassification requests are subject to Florida Statute 1009.21 and State Board of Education Rule 6A-10.044 which was adopted by the Florida Board of Governors on September 6, 2006.\n\nThe student is 24 years of age or older by the first day of classes of the term for which residency status is sought at a Florida institution.\n\nThe student is married.\n\nThe student has children who receive more than half of their support from the student.\n\nThe student has other dependents who live with and receive more than half of their support from the student.\n\nThe student is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces or is currently serving on active duty in the United States Armed Forces1 or National Guard or Reserves for purposes other than training.\n\nAt any time since the student turned age 13, where both of the student's parents are deceased, or the student is or was (until age 18) one of the following:\n\na ward/dependent of the court or\n\nin foster care\n\nThe student is determined an unaccompanied homeless youth by a school district homeless liaison, or by a staff member of an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.\n\nThe student is working on a master's or doctoral degree during the term for which residency status is sought at a Florida institution.\n\nEvidence that the student meets one of these criteria will be requested by the higher education institution.
