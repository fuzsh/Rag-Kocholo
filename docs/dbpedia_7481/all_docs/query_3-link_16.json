If the wrong date, time or time zone appears on your device, or if it doesn’t adjust for clock changes automatically, find out what to do.\n\nThe option to set the date and time automatically may not be available for your device.* Follow these steps to make sure your device is able to set the time and time zone automatically.\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of iOS or iPadOS.\n\nTurn on Set Automatically in Settings > General > Date & Time. This sets your date and time automatically based on your time zone. Is this setting dimmed?\n\nIf a message appears saying that updated time zone information is available, restart your device and any paired Apple Watch devices.\n\nAllow your device to use its current location to determine the correct time zone. To do this, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services > System Services and turn on Setting Time Zone.\n\nCheck that your device is using the correct time zone in Settings > General > Date & Time > Time Zone.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nMake sure your Mac is connected to the internet.\n\nOpen Location Services settings and make sure Location Services is turned on. Then scroll to the bottom of the list of apps and services and click the Details button next to System Services. Make sure \"Time zone and system customisation\" is turned on.\n\nOpen Date & Time settings and make sure the option to set time and date automatically, as well as the option to set time zone automatically, are turned on.\n\nRestart your Mac.\n\nOn your Apple TV\n\nThese steps require tvOS 10 or later on Apple TV HD or Apple TV 4K. If you’re using an older version of tvOS or an older Apple TV, you can set the time zone manually.\n\nMake sure your Apple TV is connected to the Internet.\n\nGo to Settings > General > Time Zone. If a message appears saying that updated time zone information is available, restart your Apple TV to get the update.\n\nIf the message doesn’t appear, press and hold the Back button or the Menu button on your Apple TV remote to go to the Home Screen. Wait several minutes, then return to Settings > General > Time Zone. If the message now appears, restart your Apple TV to get the update.\n\nIf your device is still displaying an incorrect date, time or time zone, change each setting manually instead of using Set Automatically. For example, you may have iOS 9 or earlier, and your country or region or government has subsequently changed time zones or the observance of clock changes.\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nGo to Settings > General > Date & Time.\n\nTurn off Set Automatically. Is this setting dimmed?\n\nChange the time zone or the date and time:\n\nTap Time Zone and enter a city with the time zone you need.\n\nOr tap the date to change the date and time.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nOpen Date & Time settings and turn off the option to set time and date automatically, as well as the option to set time zone automatically. You can then set time, date and time zone manually.\n\nOn your Apple TV\n\nGo to Settings > General > Time Zone.\n\nMake sure that Set Automatically is turned off, then choose a time zone.\n\nFind out more about time settings\n\nIf the time on your device is wrong after you sync it with your computer, make sure Date & Time are set correctly on your Mac.\n\nManual adjustments to time settings to change app behaviour (such as game timers) aren’t recommended.\n\nFind out about time settings for Apple Watch, including how to set up 24-hour time on your watch and how to set the watch face ahead of the actual time.\n\n* The option to turn Set Automatically on or off may not be available with all network providers or in all countries and regions. If the device has a Screen Time passcode or a corporate profile with device restrictions installed, then the option to turn Set Automatically on or off will be dimmed or greyed out."
