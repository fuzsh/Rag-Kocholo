Grim Reality [Ben Hogg, Vocals]\n\nComing out on 3 additional formats:\r\nSKR125DCD (DIGIPAK)\r\nSKR125DLP\r\nSKR125CT\r\n\r\nSHADOW KINGDOM RECORDS is proud to present a long-overdue demos &amp; rarities collection from thee immortal HOUR OF 13, appropriately titled Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased. Across this massive collection, one will find HOUR OF 13&#39;s very first steps into doom metal godhood, alongside alternate recordings of fan favorites.\r\n\r\nListening to Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased, it becomes quickly apparent that something truly special was being birthed upon the band&#39;s first recorded notes. The first half of this collection - or sides A and B of the double-vinyl edition - comprise demos recorded in 2007. The first three songs were the very first written by HOUR OF 13 in November 2006 and then recorded not long after; the next five songs were recorded nearly a year later. Together, these eight songs would form the foundation of the band&#39;s now-classic debut album, released by SHADOW KINGDOM as Hour of 13. Although recognizably HOUR OF 13, these early demo versions of the debut album&#39;s songs have slightly different arrangements while others have slightly different vocals, but every single bit of the band&#39;s trademark atmosphere is plentiful and poignant. Verily, this is the sound of lingering incense and burning blood.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased, we find a number of alternate recordings, some with special circumstances surrounding them. On side C is an alternate full-band recording of &quot;Call To Satan,&quot; recorded at the HOUR OF 13 rehearsal spot, alongside an alternate version of &quot;The Rites of Samhain&quot; with fully correct lyric placement and vocals by mainman Chad Davis. But most poignantly is the song &quot;Upon Black Wings We Die,&quot; written and recorded within a matter of a few hours upon hearing the news of the passing of Jason McCash from The Gates Of Slumber. On side D are the complete Candlemass Eve Recordings, the second rehearsal with Beaten Back to Pure&#39;s Ben Hogg on vocals: all recorded in a single session on a Zoom H2 microphone in the room, captured here with a newfound energy and stirring vocal performance. Feel the ancient atmosphere of early metal rehearsal rooms of yesteryear here!\r\n\r\nAs founder Chad Davis states in the liner notes to Salt The Dead: The Rare And Unreleased, &quot;This album documents the times and tribulations that had shrouded HOUR OF 13, the early days of rejuvenation along with the dark days of contemplation, and serve as a testament of an entity capable of withstanding any obstacle in its path.&quot; So far, the definitive HOUR OF 13 collection - and the cultest. Praise Him and enter the abyss!",
