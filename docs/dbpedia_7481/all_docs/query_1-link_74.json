        "text": "Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night, but that amount may vary based on different factors. Read on to find out how much sleep is right for you.\n\nNo matter who you are, sleep is essential for your health. But when life gets busy, it can be one of the first things to get neglected or sacrificed.\n\nGetting enough sleep is just as important as eating healthy foods or getting enough exercise.\n\nThis article will dive into the benefits of quality sleep and help you determine how many hours per night is optimal.\n\nEveryone has unique needs and preferences, and individual sleep requirements are no different.\n\nHowever, the amount of sleep you need per night is primarily determined by your age.\n\nAccording to the CDC, recommendations for sleep duration are broken down by age group:\n\nOlder adults (65+): 7 to 8 hours\n\nAdults (18 to 64 years): 7 to 9 hours\n\nTeenagers (14 to 17 years): 8 to 10 hours\n\nSchool children (6 to 13 years): 9 to 11 hours\n\nPreschoolers (3 to 5 years): 10 to 13 hours (including naps)\n\nToddlers (1 to 2 years): 11 to 14 hours (including naps)\n\nInfants (4 to 12 months): 12 to 15 hours (including naps)\n\nNewborns (0 to 3 months): 14 to 17 hours\n\nSome people might need more or less sleep than recommended, depending on the following factors.\n\nGenetic makeup\n\nAccording to researchers, your genetics are a determining factor in how many hours of sleep you need per night.\n\nSome genetic mutations can affect how long you need to sleep, what time of day you prefer to sleep, and how you respond to sleep deprivation.\n\nFor example, those with one specific genetic mutation need only around 6 hours, whereas people without it require about 8 hours, on average.\n\nHowever, your genetic makeup isn’t something you can change, and there’s no practical way to know whether you carry one of these mutations.\n\nTherefore, it’s essential to pay attention to how you feel to determine whether you’re getting the right amount of sleep.\n\nSleep quality\n\nThe quality of your sleep can also affect how much you need.\n\nIf your sleep quality is low, you may still feel tired after getting what should be considered enough sleep.\n\nConversely, if you’re getting good quality sleep, you may manage better with a little less.\n\nShort sleep duration and low sleep quality are responsible for many adverse sleep-related effects. For example, a 2019 study found that low sleep quality was associated with higher perceived stress.\n\nSo, it’s not only important to focus on sleeping long enough, but also on sleeping well enough.\n\nAdditionally, many common sleep disorders can negatively affect sleep quality, such as sleep apnea. If you often feel like you aren’t sleeping well or are extremely tired and don’t know why, it’s a good idea to check in with a healthcare professional.\n\nSummary\n\nHow much sleep you need depends on many different factors, including your age, genetics, and how well you sleep at night. However, 7 to 9 hours per night is ideal for most adults.\n\nSleep repairs the body\n\nSleep is more than just a time for your body and mind to rest. In fact, while you’re asleep, your body remains active.\n\nResearch shows that during this time, your body rebuilds muscles you’ve worn down during the day and removes toxins in the brain that accumulate while you’re awake. It’s also essential for keeping your memories intact.\n\nSleep is vital when it comes to regulating your emotions. A 2022 study found that chronic sleep deprivation can increase negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression.\n\nSleep deprivation can also affect your body’s ability to regulate essential functions like appetite management, your immune system, metabolism, and body weight.\n\nLastly, sleep is vital in maintaining your circadian rhythm or internal clock.\n\nYour inner biological clock runs on an approximately 24-hour schedule, controlling the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nNot sleeping long enough, sleeping at odd times of the day, and exposure to bright light at night can disrupt your internal clock and the many processes it regulates.\n\nWhile it’s essential to get enough sleep each night, it’s also important to get good quality sleep.\n\nThere isn’t a consensus on what defines sleep quality. However, researchers say it may be determined by how long it takes you to fall asleep, how often you wake up during the night, how rested you feel the next day, and how much time you spend in different stages of sleep.\n\nSince sleep is essential for many aspects of good health, getting enough each night should be a high priority.\n\nSummary\n\nGetting enough sleep is necessary for various reasons, including maintaining your immune system, metabolic functions, and memories, as well as regulating your body weight.\n\nSleep needs vary by person, and several factors may affect what you need. However, for most adults, 7 to 9 hours per night is the ideal amount.\n\nPay attention to how you feel during the day to determine whether you’re getting the right amount for you.\n\nIf you’re sleeping enough, you should feel awake and energized during the day. If you often feel sluggish or tired, you may need to sleep more.\n\nTo make the most out of bedtime, create good habits, such as minimizing your caffeine and alcohol intake, following a regular sleep schedule, and creating a comfortable sleeping environment."
