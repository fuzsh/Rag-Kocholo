        "text": "What You Need to Know\n\nGet the facts about skin cancer, the most common cancer in the United States and worldwide.\n\n1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.\n\nMore than 2 people die of skin cancer in the U.S. every hour.\n\nHaving 5 or more sunburns doubles your risk for melanoma.\n\nWhen detected early, the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is 99 percent.\n\nThere’s more than meets the eye when it comes to skin cancer, so make sure you know all the facts. You can #SharetheFacts on social media by downloading images from our Skin Cancer Awareness Toolkit. For the latest news, visit our Press Room.\n\nGeneral facts\n\nIn the U.S., more than 9,500 people are diagnosed with skin cancer every day. More than two people die of the disease every hour.1,2,9\n\nMore than 5.4 million cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer were treated in over 3.3 million people in the U.S. in 2012, the most recent year new statistics were available.1\n\nMore people are diagnosed with skin cancer each year in the U.S. than all other cancers combined.2\n\nAt least one in five Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70.3\n\nActinic keratosis is the most common precancer; it affects more than 58 million Americans.4\n\nThe annual cost of treating skin cancers in the U.S. is estimated at $8.1 billion: about $4.8 billion for nonmelanoma skin cancers and $3.3 billion for melanoma.5\n\nNonmelanoma skin cancer\n\nThe diagnosis and treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers in the U.S. increased by 77 percent between 1994 and 2014.6\n\nAbout 90 percent of nonmelanoma skin cancers are associated with exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.7\n\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer. An estimated 3.6 million cases of BCC are diagnosed in the U.S. each year.8,1\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the second most common form of skin cancer. An estimated 1.8 million cases of SCC are diagnosed in the U.S. each year.8,1\n\nMore than 5,400 people worldwide die of nonmelanoma skin cancer every month.27\n\nOrgan transplant patients are approximately 100 times more likely than the general public to develop squamous cell carcinoma.10\n\nOne study found that regular daily use of an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen reduces the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by about 40 percent when used as directed.11\n\nAbout 3,000 new cases of Merkel cell carcinoma occur in the U.S. each year. About 40 percent of cases recur.43\n\nMelanoma\n\nIt’s estimated that the number of new melanoma cases diagnosed in 2024 will increase by 7.3 percent.2\n\nThe number of melanoma deaths is expected to increase by 3.8 percent in 2024. 2\n\nAn estimated 200,340 cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2024. Of those, 99,700 cases will be in situ (noninvasive), confined to the epidermis (the top layer of skin), and 100,640 cases will be invasive, penetrating the epidermis into the skin’s second layer (the dermis). Of the invasive cases, 59,170 will be men and 41,470 will be women.2\n\nIn the past decade (2014 – 2024), the number of new invasive melanoma cases diagnosed annually increased by 32 percent.2,40\n\nAn estimated 8,290 people will die of melanoma in 2024. Of those, 5,430 will be men and 2,860 will be women.2\n\nThe vast majority of melanomas are caused by the sun. In fact, one UK study found that about 86 percent of melanomas can be attributed to exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.12\n\nCompared with stage I melanoma patients treated within 30 days of being biopsied, those treated 30 to 59 days after biopsy have a 5 percent higher risk of dying from the disease, and those treated more than 119 days after biopsy have a 41 percent higher risk.13\n\nAcross all stages of melanoma, the average five-year survival rate in the U.S. is 94 percent. The estimated five-year survival rate for patients whose melanoma is detected early is over 99 percent. The survival rate falls to 74 percent when the disease reaches the lymph nodes and 35 percent when the disease metastasizes to distant organs.2\n\nOnly 20 to 30 percent of melanomas are found in existing moles, while 70 to 80 percent arise on apparently normal skin.14\n\nOn average, a person’s risk for melanoma doubles if they have had more than five sunburns.15\n\nOne study found that regular daily use of an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen reduces the risk of developing melanoma by 50 percent, when used as directed.16\n\nMelanoma accounts for 6 percent of new cancer cases in men, and 4 percent of new cancer cases in women. 2\n\nMen age 49 and under have a higher probability of developing melanoma than any other cancer but colon and rectum cancers.2\n\nFrom ages 15 to 39, men are 55 percent more likely to die of melanoma than women in the same age group.17\n\nWomen age 49 and under are more likely to develop melanoma than any other cancer except breast and thyroid cancers.2\n\nFrom age 50 on, significantly more men develop melanoma than women. The majority of people who develop melanoma are white men over age 55. But until age 49, significantly more non-Hispanic white women develop melanoma than white men (one in 160 women versus one in 243 men). Overall, one in 28 white men and one in 41 white women will develop melanoma in their lifetime.2\n\nIndoor tanning\n\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation is a proven human carcinogen.18\n\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer, an affiliate of the World Health Organization, includes ultraviolet (UV) tanning devices in its Group 1, a list of agents that are cancer-causing to humans. Group 1 also includes agents such as plutonium, cigarettes and solar UV radiation.19\n\nUltraviolet (UV) tanning devices were reclassified by the FDA from Class I (low risk) to Class II (moderate to high risk) devices as of September 2, 2014.20\n\nIndoor tanning devices can emit UV radiation in amounts 10 to 15 times higher than the sun at its peak intensity.41\n\nTwenty states plus the District of Columbia prohibit people younger than 18 from using indoor tanning devices: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. Oregon and Washington prohibit those under age 18 from using indoor tanning devices unless a prescription is provided.21\n\nAustralia, Brazil and Iran have banned indoor tanning altogether.22\n\nThe cost of direct medical care for skin cancer cases attributable to indoor tanning is $343.1 million annually in the U.S.23\n\nMore than 419,000 cases of skin cancer in the U.S. each year are linked to indoor tanning, including about 245,000 basal cell carcinomas, 168,000 squamous cell carcinomas and 6,200 melanomas.24\n\nMore people develop skin cancer because of indoor tanning than develop lung cancer because of smoking.26\n\nThose who have ever tanned indoors have a 83 percent increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma43 and a 29 percent increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma.24\n\nAny history of indoor tanning increases the risk of developing basal cell carcinoma before age 40 by 69 percent.25\n\nWomen who have ever tanned indoors are six times more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma in their 20s than those who have never tanned indoors. At all ages, the more women tan indoors, the higher their risk of developing melanoma.26\n\nOne study observing 63 women diagnosed with melanoma before age 30 found that 61 of them (97 percent) had used tanning beds.26\n\nPeople who first use a tanning bed before age 35 increase their risk for melanoma by 75 percent.28\n\nIndoor tanning among U.S. high school students decreased by 53 percent between 2009 and 2015.29\n\nSkin aging\n\nAn estimated 80 percent of skin aging is caused by the sun.30\n\nPeople who use sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher daily show 24 percent less skin aging than those who do not use sunscreen daily.31\n\nSun damage is cumulative. Only about 23 percent of lifetime exposure occurs by age 18.32\n\nAges Average Accumulated Sun Exposure* 1-18 23 percent 19-40 47 percent 41-59 74 percent 60-78 100 percent *Based on a 78-year life span\n\nEthnicity\n\nThe estimated five-year melanoma survival rate for Black patients is only 71 percent, versus 94 percent for white patients.2\n\nSkin cancer represents approximately 2 to 4 percent of all cancers in Asians.33\n\nSkin cancer represents 4 to 5 percent of all cancers in Hispanics.35\n\nSkin cancer represents 1 to 2 percent of all cancers in Black people.3\n\nMelanomas in Black people, Asians and native Hawaiians most often occur on nonexposed skin with less pigment, with up to 60 to 75 percent of tumors arising on the palms, soles, mucous membranes and nail regions.33\n\nIn nonwhite people, the plantar portion of the foot is often the most common site of skin cancer, being involved in 30 to 40 percent of cases.35\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer in Black people.33\n\nLate-stage melanoma diagnoses are more prevalent among Hispanic and Black people than non-Hispanic white people; 52 percent of non-Hispanic black patients and 26 percent of Hispanic patients receive an initial diagnosis of advanced-stage melanoma, versus 16 percent of non-Hispanic white patients.34\n\nPeople of color have higher percentages of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM, melanoma of the palms, soles and nailbeds) than Caucasians, whereas superficial spreading melanoma is the most frequent subtype in Caucasians and Hispanics.35\n\nPediatrics\n\nMelanoma in children and adolescents accounts for a tiny percentage of all new melanoma cases in the United States, with about 300 cases a year in children under 20 years old.36\n\nMelanoma in children and adolescents accounts for 3 percent of all pediatric cancers in the United States.37\n\nThe treatment of childhood melanoma is often delayed due to misdiagnosis of pigmented lesions, which occurs up to 40 percent of the time.39\n\nReferences\n\nRogers HW, Weinstock MA, Feldman SR, Coldiron BM.
