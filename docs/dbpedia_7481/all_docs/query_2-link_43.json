They include hiring and working conditions that are specific to minors, restrictions on the hours, and the types of work a minor can do.\n\nEmployers are generally subject to both state child labor laws and the federal child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 212(c), and the FLSA regulations at 29 CFR Part 570. Certain provisions of Oregon state law may be less restrictive than federal law, and employers covered by the FLSA that only follow a less restrictive provision of Oregon state law will be in violation of federal law. See 29 U.S.C. 218(a). For more information on federal child labor law, please visit the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division Website at www.dol.gov/whd.\n\nAll employers must have a certificate to employ minors under 18 years of age. Employers can apply online, or email child.labor@boli.oregon.gov to request a printed copy of the application by mail. Minors age 14-17 are not issued individual work permits in Oregon.\n\nDownload our guide to youth employment for employers, including checklists, best practices, and resources to ensure a safe and productive work environment for young workers.\n\nThe law\n\nWhat type of employer are you?\n\nFind the appropriate employer type below to identify permits and certificates that are required.\n\nNon-agricultural employer\n\nAgriculture employer\n\nAgriculture includes farming in all its branches when performed by a farmer or on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such farming operations. Employees of a farmer who handle agriculture commodities of other farmers are not considered to be engaged in agriculture."
