Tipped workers must average half of the minimum wage in tips over the 7-day work week that is established by employers who gross over $500,000 in yearly revenue.\n\nfoo\n\nEmployers Subject to Minimum Wage\n\nEmployers engaged in retail or service businesses whose annual gross income is less than $500,000 are not required to pay the state minimum wage rate. Employers not subject to the minimum wage law can pay employees wages of their choosing. For more information, please contact the United States Department of Labor.\n\nEmployers are generally subject to both state minimum wage laws and the federal minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. 206, and the FLSA regulations at 29 CFR Part 570. Certain provisions of Missouri state law may be less restrictive than federal law, and employers covered by the FLSA that only follow a less restrictive provision of Missouri state law will be in violation of federal law. See 29 U.S.C.218(a). For more information on federal minimum wage law, please visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division Website at www.dol.gov/whd.\n\nfoo\n\nIf you feel you are not being paid the correct wages, you can file a minimum wage complaint.\n\nMinimum Wage History\n\nTime Period$ Amount2015$7.652016$7.652017$7.702018$7.852019$8.602020$9.452021$10.302022$11.152023$12.002024$12.30\n\nMissouri Minimum Wage Summary Posters\n\nAll employers subject to any provisions of the law shall post a summary of the law and regulations. The Division of Labor Standards has created a summary to post for the convenience of Missouri employers. You also may print a Spanish Minimum Wage Summary Poster. Please post the summary in a conspicuous and accessible place at the business. Required by Missouri Revised Statutes, Section 290.522."
