Biography

Charles-Édouard Guillaume is Notable.

Guillaume was a swiss physicist who won a Nobel prize for his discovery of important metal alloys, particularly Invar[1][2]. He was the son of watch and clock maker Édouard Guillaume, and his alloys had applications in that area and elsewhere.

He married A. M. Taufflieb in 1888, and they had 3 children.[1] In a photo of members of the Guillaume and Curie families, the lone child is Maurice Guillaume.[3]

He was the recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees, and a member if important academies. This in spite of a protracted (and ultimately doomed) battle against Einstein and his theory of relativity.[4]

Research Note

Both wikipedia and the Nobel prize site show his name with and without a hyphen on the same page. This profile is badly in need of primary sources, but I wanted to get it started.

His death was in May according to Wikipedia[2] and his Nobel prize biography[1]. Britannica.com[5], NNDB[6], and WikiData[7] have June. The most contemporary mention I have found is in a French scientific journal: "M.le Président annonce à l'Académie le décès de M. Ch.-Ed. Guillaume, Correspondant pour la Section de Physique, survenu le i3 juin".[8] This was reported at a meeting held 20 Jun 1938. Based on this I will use June.
