        "text": "Thanks for the suggestions.\n\nThe 5 laureates in my post would be a great start for those who have profiles. It's actually only 4 tasks because Chandrasekhar and Raman are nephew and uncle.\n\nHere are some winners with no profile at all as of yesterday:\n\n1919 Johannes Stark\n\n1920 Charles Édouard Guillaume\n\n1924 Manne Siegbahn\n\n1926 Jean Baptiste Perrin\n\n1928 Owen Willans Richardson\n\n1936 Victor Francis Hess\n\n1937 Clinton Joseph Davisson\n\n1943 Otto Stern\n\n1944 Isidor Isaac Rabi\n\n1946 Percy Williams Bridgman\n\n1952 Edward Mills Purcell\n\n1954 Edward Bothe\n\n1955 Polykarp Kusch\n\n1957 Tsung-Dao Lee\n\n1958 Ilya Frank\n\n1958 Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm\n\nThis should be complete through 1946. There are many more after that.\n\nThanks to Vic Watt and Sharon Casteel, three of the names above can be crossed off. They have profiles and are connected. I just added a basic profile for Rabi, but he's still unconnected. There are lots of grandchildren, so a connection may be relatively easy.\n\nEdit, December 2020. Three more of the original ten have profiles now, leaving only 3. I have added the next 3 chronologically, making the list complete to 1955.\n\nEdit, February 2024. Several more profiles have been created, so I again added 3 more missing names. Progress on connecting those who do have profiles has been good as well.\n\nJust as a quick look, I checked first 9 names from the opening image at the UCLA site. Those marked living were listed that way on the site or in a quick search, but there is no guarantee. Those in bold could be the best targets for a project. The web site has 83 women, so this only scratches the surface.\n\nRosalind Franklin, has profile, connected\n\nHelen R. Quinn, living\n\nMyriam Sarachik, living\n\nMaria Goeppert Mayer, Nobel winner, has profile, connected\n\nPatricia Elizabeth Cladis 1937-2017, no profile\n\nHertha Sponer has a .ged import profile with no family of any kind\n\nGail Gulledge Hanson, living\n\nSau Lan Wu, living\n\nSulamith Löw (married name Goldhaber), no profile.\n\nOne more name jumped off the page. Lise Meitner (1878-1969) has a profile but is not connected. She a perfect example of a woman who was denied opportunities because she was a woman (and a Jew in 1930s Germany) but persevered to make huge contributions in science."
