Second edition of this rare work, an examination of X-ray technology, which had been discovered by Roentgen just two years prior. Roentgen would go on to be awarded the first Nobel prize in Physics in 1901. Guillaume would himself go on to win the Nobel prize in Physics in 1920 for his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys, but this title remains one of his most important works. This is a VG- copy, with minor spotting and foxing internally, binding slightly cocked, chips and tanning to wrap edges, small stamp to half title, with minor pencil marginalia throughout, but a sound copy of a rare work. OCLC locates 18 copies. - Rayons X et la Photographie a Travers Les Corps Opaque",
