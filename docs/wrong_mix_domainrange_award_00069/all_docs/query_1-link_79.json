        "text": "1. The Guillaume Project\n\n2A similar, but not entirely identical, position was defended by Édouard and Georges Guillaume, who in the 1930s launched an ambitious project of mathematical economics under the title of ‘rational economics’, a term previously coined by economists explicitly as an echo of ‘rational mechanics’. Mirowski did not mention the Guillaume project in his More Heat than Light, but in his more recent book Machine Dreams he included an anecdote which involves a publication of the Guillaume brothers (Mirowski, 2002, 104). The story comes, in fact, from Robert Leonard (1995, 736-738), who quoted extensively from a letter which John von Neumann in May 1935 wrote to Abraham Flexner, director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, who the month before had sent him a copy of their 1932 book Sur les Fondements de l’Économique Rationnelle. Although von Neumann had some sympathy for their methodological principles, he was of the opinion that “the mathematical technique of the authors is not good enough, to carry all the theoretical and statistical structures, which they want to build on it”. More generally, he had “the impression that the subject is not yet ripe (I mean that it is not yet fully understood, which of its features are the essential ones) to be reduced to a small number of fundamental postulates—like geometry or mechanics”.\n\n3The work of Édouard and Georges Guillaume is not very well known among economists and historians of economics. In recent years Marianne Fischman and Emeric Lendjel (2000), Lendjel (2002, 21-33) and Michel Armatte (2005, 99-102) have examined some aspects of their writings. In this paper I explore the specific blend of physics and economics proposed by the Guillaume brothers, and in particular trace the connections between their theoretical work and its more practical manifestations. They rejected what they called the ‘subjective’ rational economics of Cournot, Jevons, Walras and Pareto, and instead aimed for an economic science based upon an ‘operational’ axiomatic system. After a short biographical sketch, I analyse the theoretical contributions of the Guillaume brothers, and present a survey of the activities of their research centre, the Centre d’Analyse Économique, and its collaborators.\n\n2. Biographical Elements\n\n8Observing the usefulness of probability theory in the actuarial sciences, Édouard Guillaume began wondering whether it would be possible to bring more mathematical rigour to economics in general. At that point his brother’s researches must have played an important role. In Édouard Guillaume’s words:\n\n9 “The 1914/18 war broke out. Mr. Georges Guillaume, who was then an arbitragist at the Banque de Par (...)\n\nSurvint la guerre mondiale de 1914/18. M. Georges Guillaume, qui était alors arbitragiste à la Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, faisait des observations extrêmement curieuses dans le domaine monétaire, et me les communiquait. Les booms et les dépressions économiques commençaient à se succéder à un rythme assez rapide, et l’on acquérait de plus en plus la conviction que nous étions tous pris dans un mécanisme inexorable, obéissant à des lois aussi précises qu’inéluctables. (Guillaume, 1946, 55)\n\n3. Rational Economics\n\n13From Walras’s correspondence we know that in 1907 Albert Aupetit had agreed to write a book Économique Rationnelle for the applied mathematics section of the massive Encyclopédie Scientifique series edited by Édouard Toulouse (Jaffé, 1965, III, letters 1660 and 1674). Aupetit’s book was never published, and one had to wait until the year 1928 when François Divisia published his book with the same title in the series. According to Divisia (1951, 12) the term rational economics had been invented by Walras, but Divisia did not provide a specific reference. Whatever the source of the term may be, it is clear that it was chiefly used by those who claimed to be working in the tradition of Walras.\n\n21 “A body of doctrine appears to us as rational—e.g. Mechanics—when it rests entirely on a small numb (...)\n\nUne doctrine nous apparaît comme rationnelle—telle la Mécanique—lorsqu’elle repose entièrement sur un petit nombre de principes—d’axiomes—fondamentaux, dont elle développe les conséquences à l’aide de l’instrument mathématique. (Guillaume, 1935, v)\n\n15The number of axioms had to be small so that one could ‘easily dominate them by a geometry’ (Guillaume and Guillaume, 1937, 14). The role of mathematics would be to show that the set of principles was free of internal contradictions, and to derive the logical consequences of the principles adopted. Empirical verifications would reveal whether the chosen principles were true.\n\n23 “Indeed, the use of mathematics supposes that the object of analysis—in this case value—obey a prin (...)\n\nL’usage des mathématiques suppose, en effet, que l’objet de l’analyse—en l’occurrence la valeur—obéisse à un principe de conservation. C’est grâce à l’énoncé d’un tel principe que la Physique et la Chimie ont pu faire, depuis Lavoisier et Mayer, les progrès fabuleux que l’on connaît. Malheureusement la valeur étant, pour les hédonistes, une grandeur essentiellement subjective et qualitative, l’analyse ne pouvait porter que sur des fonctions psychologiques dont la détermination quantitative est inextricable. (Guillaume and Guillaume, 1937, 13-14)\n\n17Their alternative, rational economics tout court, was based on the axiomatic method and operational concepts. It purged economics of the variable and in their view unfathomable concept of value based on individual utility, and replaced it by an objectively defined and numerically expressed value concept obeying a principle of conservation. They did not deny that at the individual level consumers make choices based on utility considerations and producers try to exploit profit opportunities, but they were convinced that at the level of the economic system values were determined by objective forces, embodied in conservation principles. In most cases individual behaviour could not change the fundamental tendencies of an economic system. Such was the power of accounting identities:\n\n24 “If free will does exist for individuals, all the more there exists a sure determinism of the accou (...)\n\nS’il existe un libre arbitre des individus, il n’en existe pas moins un déterminisme certain du compte des recettes et dépenses. Ce qui sort d’une poche entre dans une autre, et l’on est en droit, en se basant sur un principe postulant cette constatation, d’examiner le problème sous un aspect purement objectif. (ibid., 34)\n\n18The two crucial conservation principles were (i) the conservation of flows of goods (flux de commodités), and (ii) the conservation of flows of values (flux de valeur). In mathematical terms, they can be expressed as follows (ibid., 248-257). Let qH denote a quantity of good H, and dqH the production of good H between time t and time t+dt. Suppose that this production requires the amounts\n\n19of the n different goods A, B, …, N, with the services of capital and labour also treated as goods. Using the shorthand notation\n\n20the basic principle of the conservation of flows of goods can then be expressed as a system of n equations:\n\n21(In the case of lags these equations have to be modified.). Let the prices of the n goods be equal to\n\n,\n\n22with pO representing the price of gold. The second principle expresses that, in equilibrium, the prices must be such that every producer earns exactly what he needs to cover his costs. For instance, the producer of good A earns a flow of value equal to\n\n;\n\n23this should be equal to the flows of value which he has to pay for the productive services which he uses. The principle of the conservation of the flows of value therefore defines a second system of n equations:\n\n24Since there is one degree of freedom, the Guillaumes suggested to use gold as the numéraire, i.e. to put the price of gold, pO, equal to 1.\n\n25The two conservation principles were seen as counterparts of the two conservation principles of physics, with the first corresponding to the conservation of matter and the second to the conservation of energy (Guillaume, 1946, 58-61). The two principles provided the foundation for a twofold accounting system, one with regard to goods and the other with regard to values, which constituted the core of their rational economics theory. The models developed by the Guillaumes are therefore built around a nucleus consisting of variants of the two systems of equations expressing the two conservation/accounting principles.\n\n26The Guillaumes claimed that by following their approach they were able to arrive at a truly ‘general theory’ (Guillaume and Guillaume, 1937, 241-242). They certainly did not lack ambition: they started from ‘small models’ (ibid., 39-42), which they gradually made more ‘realistic’ by relaxing some simplifying assumptions and by exploring different types of equilibria. Various adaptations ensured that these models could also be used to analyse non-equilibrium situations such as price adjustments, economic crises, etc. Their aim was to use these models to make predictions about the economic world which could be tested empirically, in the same way as models in physics (e.g., Niels Bohr’s model of the atom) were used to explain phenomena in the physical world. In particular, they claimed that by using probability theory they were capable of forecasting rates and prices of different assets. As we will see in the section 6, it appears that they were effectively using this information.\n\n27It is not difficult to understand why their attempt to formulate a general economic theory based on purely objective grounds failed to convince mathematicians strongly interested in economics like von Neumann. von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944, 1-8), in their opening paragraphs on ‘The mathematical method in economics’, stressed the limitations of the use of mathematics for the analysis of economic problems, “due to a combination of unfavorable circumstances” (ibid., 4). Often the problems were formulated in vague terms only and not clearly understood. Moreover, empirical knowledge was very much incomplete. As a result, modesty was called for when using mathematics in economics: “It is futile to explain—and ‘systematically’ at that—everything economic. The sound procedure is to obtain first utmost precision and mastery in a limited field, and then to proceed to another, somewhat wider one, and so on.” (ibid., 7) Judged by the standard of modesty of von Neumann and Morgenstern, the project of the Guillaumes could only be seen as premature and overly ambitious.\n\n4. Linear Models\n\n28The approach of the Guillaumes led to a succession of ever more complicated models. It would require a lot of space to present them in a systematic way. What I will do instead is to focus on some of their relatively simple models, since these bear a striking resemblance to linear models which were developed by various authors in the first half of the 20th century. The similarity with the systems of equations presented by Remak, von Neumann, Leontief and Sraffa has been pointed out by Gilibert (2000). In this section I will concentrate on the links with the work of Sraffa and von Neumann, and also with the work of a much less known pioneer of linear economic models, Maurice Potron.\n\n30where Aij stands for the amount of good j and Li for the amount of labour used for the production of Bii units of good i. (It is assumed that good i is not used for the production of itself.) The total amount of labour is equal to L, and labourers consume Ci units of good i. Under the assumption that everything which is produced is immediately consumed (“Monde homogène sans stock”, Guillaume and Guillaume, 1937, 249-250), system (1) can therefore be written as:\n\n31Likewise, system (2) becomes:\n\n32Using a more compact and obvious matrix notation, systems (4) and (5) can be expressed as:\n\n33where A is the square input matrix, B the square output matrix, C the labour consumption (row) vector, L the labour input (column) vector, p the price (column) vector, and u the summation (row) vector. If prices are expressed in ‘human labour’, i.e. if we take\n\n34(Guillaume, 1932, 86), it is quite easy to see that the prices of the two goods are determined by the first equation of system (7). We have in fact:\n\n35 These values are what the Guillaumes called ‘cost prices’ (prix de revient), which capture and measure the energy present in the economic system:\n\n26 “From the cost prices we are able to define numerically what we mean by “value”. And since, eventua (...)\n\nLe prix de revient nous permet ainsi de définir numériquement ce que nous entendons par “valeur”. Et puisque, en définitive, il exprime un travail, c’est-à-dire une énergie, [et] que celle-ci obéit à un principe de conservation, il est naturel d’admettre que la valeur elle-même doit obéir à un principe semblable. (Guillaume, 1932, 68)\n\n36According to the Guillaumes, the connection ‘energy → labour → cost price → value’ not only provided the foundation for the principle of the conservation of values, but also for the principle of the ‘universal interdependence of cost prices’ (ibid., 69).\n\n37This simple model is virtually identical to the one examined by Piero Sraffa in the first chapter of Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities (Sraffa, 1960, 3-5). The difference is that Sraffa did not specify how much labour is used for the production of each good, but instead added the wage goods to the inputs. As a result, the inputs considered by Sraffa are equal to the goods which “are used, in part as sustenance for those who work, and for the rest as means of production.” (ibid., 3) The model of the Guillaumes can, however, quite easily be transformed into Sraffa’s. It suffices to define the augmented input matrix\n\n38to see that systems (6) and (7) imply:\n\n39 which are Sraffa’s equations. Hence Sraffa’s exchange values in a ‘production for subsistence’ system coincide with the relative cost prices of the first reduced model of the Guillaumes.\n\n41There is also a similarity with some variants of the economic models formulated by Maurice Potron in the periods 1911-1914 and 1935-1942 (see Bidard and Erreygers, 2007 and 2010, and Bidard, Erreygers and Parys, 2009). In the second reduced model of 1932 the Guillaumes explicitly introduced a variable representing the non-active part of the population, such as the unemployed, the invalid, the sick and the old (Guillaume, 1932, 92). This allowed them to say something about the effects of increasing unemployment levels, although their analysis does not go very deep (ibid., 93). In Potron’s models the category of non-actives is represented by two vectors of variables, one for the number of non-working consumers in each social class (the rentiers), and the other for the number of hours or days that the workers of each type of labour are unemployed. But here too, we must be well aware of the fact that the approach of Potron was of a different nature than that of the Guillaumes.\n\n42In spite of these analogies, there is no evidence of any kind of influence between the Guillaumes and the authors just mentioned. For all it seems, the originality of their work cannot be doubted. Some aspects of their models have no counterpart in any of the other linear models developed in the first half of the 20th century. The central place they gave to gold and the intricate schemes they developed to integrate monetary and financial mechanisms into their models serve as illustrations.\n\n5. The Reception of their Work\n\n43Even if the Guillaumes had no discernible influence on the development of linear production theory, there may have been other channels through which their work got disseminated. We have seen that the interpretation of prices as energetic values, as indices revealing the amount of effort required to produce different goods, constituted a core element of their theory. With some pride they reproduced a letter written by Albert Einstein on 24 August 1946 in which he expressed support for that aspect of their work:\n\nTO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN!\n\nDr. G. Guillaume, whose family was well known to me in Switzerland, has explained to me a method for mechanized determination of the relative values of the various commodities (in function of time). I believe that the use of this method may be practical and useful in providing an objective way to obtain an incontestable measure of economic values. (Guillaume and Guillaume, 1947, 62)\n\n44In spite of that, it would be exaggerated to say that the work of the Guillaume brothers made much of an impact—neither in the economics profession, nor in other circles. Apart from their direct collaborators, very few authors have tried to develop their ideas, and those who did had limited success. In 1935 Maurice Bouytaud published his Essai d’Économique Rationnelle, with a preface by Édouard Guillaume. Ostensibly inspired by the Guillaume approach, Bouytaud presented a very formal kind of general equilibrium model, but without abandoning all references to utility and preferences as advocated by the Guillaume brothers. The market for these fairly abstract mathematical economic models must have been pretty thin, since both the book and its author have left hardly any traces in the economic literature. The same cannot be said of the Austrian art historian Robert Eisler (1882-1949), who often wrote about value and money. In his writings he repeatedly recommended the ideas of the Guillaume brothers. For example, in a 1946 review essay of Ludwig von Mises’s Omnipotent Government: The Rise of the Total State and Total War, he wrote:\n\n(…) a complete plan for an entirely free, uncontrolled and throughout competitive liberal economy has been drawn up in a newly published French book by two Swiss economists, Dr. Georges and Edouard Guillaume, Le Plan Rationnel (Paris, 1944). It is the indispensable counterpart of Professor von Mises’ Omnipotent Government. (Eisler, 1946, 247)\n\n46A remarkable affinity exists between their work and the esoteric economic writings of the mineralogist André Amstutz (1901-1981) and the chemist Arnold Borloz (1899-1960), both from Switzerland. First in a series of short papers published during World War II in the Compte rendu des séances de la Société de Physique et d’Histoire Naturelle de Genève, and then in a longer article in the Revue suisse d’économie politique et de statistique (Amstutz and Borloz, 1945), they expounded a mathematical economic model in which gold played the role of standard of value. Making use of datasets of the League of Nations, the US Department of Labor and Bureau of Census, and data made available by the economist Carl Snyder (1869-1946), they proceeded to elaborate empirical calculations. Both Édouard Guillaume (1943, 103) and Amstutz and Borloz (1945, 591) acknowledged the resemblance between the two approaches, but a promised in-depth comparison of the two was apparently never published.\n\n47As already mentioned, their theories were intensively discussed during the meetings of X-Crise (Gibrat, 1936), but even there the reception was not uniformly positive. Their 1937 book provoked a rather critical reaction by Divisia (1938), to which Georges and Édouard Guillaume (1938) duly replied. Divisia maintained that by purging economics from its hedonistic content, the Guillaumes were performing an amputation which entailed the loss of “tout ce qui fait de l’économique une science morale” (Divisia, 1938, 191).\n\n48Of the main economics journals, only the Economic Journal published a review, by Michal Kalecki (1940). He noted several deficiencies, but nevertheless concluded that “their work represents a serious contribution to this field of thought, and abounds in original and stimulating ideas” (ibid., 278). In their native Switzerland the Bulletin Technique de la Suisse Romande published three reviews of their books: one by the mathematician Gustave Juvet (1932), one by the engineer Charles Jaeger (1937a), and another one by J.C. (1938). Jaeger (1937b) also published a much longer article on mathematical economics in the Schweizerische Bauzeitung. Harold T. Davis (1938) published a joint review of the 1937 book by the Guillaumes and of Jan Tinbergen’s An Econometric Approach to Business Cycle Problems in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society. Davis saw both books as indicative of “the trend that modern studies [on mathematical economics and econometrics] are taking” (ibid., 761), but stopped short of making a comparison between the two.\n\n6. The Centre d’Analyse Économique\n\n34 “Mr Guillaume has contracted with a ‘major’ Swiss insurance company, a contract by which the latter (...)\n\n35 My guess is that the ‘major Swiss insurance company’ is La Neuchâteloise, of which Édouard was dire (...)\n\nM. Guillaume a passé, avec une ‘importante’ société suisse d’assurances, un contrat réservant à cette dernière l’exclusivité de ses travaux concernant les travaux à revenu fixe; il fait également certaines recherches pour des banquiers (Rothschild, B.N.C.I., etc.), des industriels (raffinerie de sucre, etc.) et des particuliers. Il estime que des études analogues concernant les prix des principales matières premières seraient susceptible d’intéresser le Crédit Lyonnais, auquel il serait prêt à en réserver l’exclusivité moyennant le droit d’utiliser la documentation des Etudes Financières du Crédit Lyonnais et le versement d’une somme annuelle qu’il évalue ‘au maximum à 300.000 frs par an’ (frais d’entretien du bureau spécialisé). (“Centre d’Analyse Économique (Visite à M. G. Guillaume)”, 1935, 3)\n\n52The Crédit Lyonnais seems to have declined Georges’s offer. The report was sceptical about his methods and warned that “l’application systématique des mathématiques supérieures à des raisonnements qui ne reposent en fait que sur des tissus d’hypothèses risque de donner une apparence de rigueur à des conclusions qui peuvent être dangereuses” (ibid., 4).\n\n53Probably the centre also benefited from the profits made by its sister organisation, the Centre de Gestion Guillaume, which had the task of empirically verifying the propositions established by the Centre d’Analyse Économique by means of a capital fund (Groupement de capitaux) brought together for this purpose (CAE, 8). The capital apparently belonged to Georges Guillaume, his collaborators and their families (“Centre d’Analyse Économique (Visite à M. G. Guillaume)”, 1935, 1). It was claimed that the two centres operated in harmony:\n\n36 “Far from being in hardship because of the operations following the need to register the works of t (...)\n\nLoin de se mal trouver des opérations dictées par les nécessités d’enregistrement des travaux du Centre d’Analyse Économique, le Groupement de capitaux a montré, au contraire, qu’il en profite grandement. L’ensemble a pu ainsi se développer harmonieusement. Il présente une cohésion qui lui confère la puissance investigatrice et la compétence voulues. (CAE, 8)\n\n54A number of examples were given which purportedly showed the superiority of the Guillaume arbitrage technique in comparison to other financial techniques (CAE, 21-28).\n\n42 “To build in practice economic models which comply with the previous characteristics, different tec (...)\n\nPour construire pratiquement des modèles économiques conformes aux caractéristiques précédentes, diverses techniques ont déjà été utilisées: modèles mathématiques, qui se prêtent à l’étude des propriétés formelles; modèles graphiques commodes pour illustrer un exposé de principe; modèles numériques, reproduisant quantitativement les flux de matière et de valeurs réels mesurés à un instant donné, mettant en évidence les tensions-valeur et permettant la prévision pratique; enfin modèles électriques qui, substituant aux flux de valeur des courants électriques (qui obéissent au même principe de conservation), et figurant les contraintes matérielles par des liaisons électriques appropriés, constituent une image souple et mouvante douée d’une évolution spontanée parallèle à l’évolution du milieu réel. (Gélinier, 1946, 264)\n\n57This is the first mention of the use of electrical models by the centre; I will explore this branch of activity in the next section.\n\n7. Electric Models and Devices\n\n58When applied at the level of the nation-state, the conservation and accounting laws which the Guillaumes considered to be the core of their rational economics models eventually led to the construction of tables of national accounts, representing flows of goods and value between different sectors. For instance, in one of their publications they included a number of folding pages with a detailed table of this kind representing the economy of Switzerland in 1939 (Guillaume and Guillaume, 1947, 61). They also claimed to have invented a device which enabled them to trace the dynamics of the economic system:\n\n43 “We have built an electric calculator that enables to follow, almost in continuous time, the interv (...)\n\nNous avons construit une calculatrice électrique qui permet de suivre, d’une façon quasi-continue, les intervalles entre les tableaux dressés à des instants aussi rapprochés qu’on le désire. Cette machine reproduit ainsi une synthèse dynamique de l’évolution en fonction du temps. (ibid., 34)\n\n59This raises two interesting questions: were the tables of the Guillaume similar to the input-output tables constructed by Wassily Leontief since the early 1930s, and what exactly was the electrical calculator to which they referred?\n\n61Barbey then noted that the entries of this table are such that for each sector i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4), the following equation holds:\n\n62His invention was based on the idea that it should be possible to translate this information on economic exchanges between sectors into flows of electric energy:\n\nThe invention has for its object to device an electrical apparatus permitting to instantaneously and continuously compute correlative variations of the quantities\n\nwhen one or several of them are adjusted or undergo a variation. The invention has further for its object to devise an electric integrator adapted to integrate variations of these quantities in function of the time, so as to totalize the exchanges between the groups as well as the profits or losses of any one of these groups. (Patent US2509718, column 3)\n\n63He went on to describe the technical details of the system of instantaneous and totalizing meters which he had in mind.\n\nThis electrical coordination, flexible, instantaneous, and complete, is a revolutionary change for statistical work. Its consequences are bound to be far reaching, and will prove to be [an] asset to the organizations who will be first to use it. A development equipment is built on a semi-industrial scale for a private investment trust in France. (Barbey to Leontief, 6 March 1946, Appendix, 2)\n\n65The investment trust to which Barbey referred in his letter was the Centre d’Analyse Économique of the Guillaume brothers. In another letter to Leontief, Barbey inserted a note on the history and development of the Grid, and there he explained:\n\nAt the beginning of 1944 the author saw the double-entry tables of the Center [sic] d’Analyse Économique, Paris, on the national product.\n\nHe was struck by the difficulty of mutual adjustment within the frame of double-entry accounting, of large numbers of statistical or tentative figures. He wondered whether electric currents would not spontaneously give the answer to such large systems of linear equations and he built a first very small electric “Grid” of four accounting units exchanging through sixteen points.\n\nThe Centre d’Analyse Économique bought it, and asked the inventor to design and build a more important “Grid”. With the collaboration of the Centre, the inventor developed a thoroughly changed structure of the double-entry table, in order to make it more comprehensive, explicit, practical. All the economic functions should appear on a well-designed table. At the expense of the Centre, he built the Grid which has been finished just now. (Barbey to Leontief, 14 June 1946, Appendix, 5)\n\n8. Concluding Remarks\n\n68In this paper I have tried to show that the Guillaume brothers have gone quite far in their attempt to reconcile economics and physics. Taking their distance from the general equilibrium tradition of Walras and Pareto, of which they disliked the subjective elements, they elaborated their own version of rational economics in which values were derived objectively, based upon two conservation principles. They applied their theoretical knowledge to the real world and offered information and advice to parties willing to pay for it. Apparently capable of making a profit by investing their own funds according to what they identified as lucrative investment opportunities, they stimulated the development of electric devices which would facilitate the calculations needed to construct and use tables of national accounts. This remarkable blend of original theoretical work and practical applications constitutes a fascinating but hitherto largely unknown episode in the history of economics-as-if-it-were-physics.\n\n69That said, it must be acknowledged that their rational economics project can only be described as a failure. Mathematically inclined economists such as Divisia were offended by their obsession to purge economics from all subjective elements. Mathematicians with a strong interest in economics such as von Neumann were critical of the ambition to create a general economic theory simply by mimicking the conservation principles of physics. And economists who worked with linear models of production, such as Leontief, failed to perceive the usefulness of the electric devices of which the design was purportedly based on their theories. In addition, there may have been other reasons why their theories did not gain much ground. They worked mostly outside of academia, at a time when a full-blown mathematical approach such as theirs was still considered to be arcane by most economists. Even though they found a receptive audience at X-Crise, the association with this technocratic group apparently did not open many doors, at least not in terms of academic recognition. And the claims that their theoretical constructions provided the basis for superior investment strategies are impossible to verify, given the lack of evidence. It is, therefore, far from surprising that the grandiose ‘rational economics’ project of the Guillaumes quickly fell into oblivion.\n\nI thank Martine Balsalobre, Christian Bidard, Jocelyne Dufour, Claude Jeanrenaud, Alexander Müller, Roger Nougaret, Jean-Pierre Potier and Libb Thims for valuable advice and assistance.

I have also benefited from comments by participants of the 35th Annual HES Conference (York University, Toronto, Canada, June 2008), the International Summer School of History of Economic Thought (Lucca, Italy, September 2008) and the Conference “The Pioneers of Linear Models of Production” (EconomiX, Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense, January 2013), where I presented earlier versions of the paper. Originally this started as a joint project with Albert Jolink, who drew my attention to correspondence he had found in the Papers of Wassily Leontief.
