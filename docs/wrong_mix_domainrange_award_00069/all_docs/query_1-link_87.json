Tall 8vo, Cloth over marbled boards, red leather spine label, very good, minor rubbing, pages tanning. 336 pp, illustrated with four folding or double-page plates at rear. Guillaume was a Swiss physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1920 in recognition of the service he had rendered to precision measurements in physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys. In this earlier work, he draws on his experience as the head of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the thermostatic measurements and experiments he made at the Observatoire de Paris. Very Good. Item #H18659"
