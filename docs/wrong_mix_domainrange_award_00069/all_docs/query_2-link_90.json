        "text": "Excerpts\n\nConrad Ranzan (2009)\n\nAncient \"Relative\" Motion\n\nLet us go back in time. Way, way, back ... to the 5th century BC. In the Classical period there had been physical philosophers: men such as Parmenides and Zeno, both natives of Elea, a seaport on the western coast of Italy. They had sought for the \"physis\" or nature of external things, the laws and constituents of the material and measurable world. [2]\n\nParmenides tried to see the ultimate reality behind natural phenomena the essentials which lie behind what is observed. But there were also things that were not observable, not perceivable; things, nevertheless, that were conceivable. In his simple classification system Parmenides was able to included both observables and non-observables. But it was not a classification between observables and non-observables but rather between Being and non-Being. He believed that everything can be classified into Being (reality) and non-Being (not reality). Being is changeless, eternal and motionless; non-Being is change, transitoriness, and motion. According to Parmenides motion and change are unreal and merely illusory.[3]\n\nIn the time of Parmenides motion was explained as an illusion: It did not exist. [4]\n\nThe Parmenidean philosophy held that the universe was continuous and unchanging. Obviously Parmenides reached conclusions quite the opposite to those of Heraclitus, to whom flux and change were the true reality, but for a time the motion-as-illusion view exerted a considerable influence.[5]\n\nThe great defender of the motion-as-illusion position was Zeno, a friend and follower of Parmenides. He had devised a series of proofs, in the form of paradoxes, to show that motion was quite impossible. The most famous proof involves a race between Achilles and the tortoise and argues that motion is not what it appears to be.[6]\n\nThe argument is that if Achilles and the tortoise run a handicap race, Achilles can never overtake his competitor. Suppose the tortoise starts a certain distance down the track, then while Achilles runs up to the starting point of the tortoise, the latter will have moved somewhat further ahead. While Achilles runs to this new position, the tortoise again will have gained a point slightly further on. Every time Achilles closes in on the tortoises previous position, the creature will have crawled away. Achilles does of course come closer and closer to the tortoise, but he will never catch up with it.[7] (See Fig. 1)\n\nZenos proof uses a peculiar form of relative motion.\n\nAchilles position is relative to some in-between point; a moving point which by the defining aspects of the race can never reach the tortoises position. And since the motions are not continuous but incremental, Zeno leads us into an infinite regression of infinitely smaller advancements. Achilles and the in-between point, although moving, stay on the trailing side of the tortoise. Achilles, forever finds himself merely catching-up; forever on the losing side.\n\nNotice that Zeno equates subsequent motion to a fraction of the prior motion. He does so recursively, repeatedly, and without end. A truly clever form of relativity. Zeno ignores Achilles absolute speed, applies his peculiar relative speed, and ends up with no motion (at least no perceptible motion).\n\nObviously the paradox arises only if you ignore the fact of absolute motion. Zeno, of course, was wrong because he ignored the absoluteness of motion.\n\nJumping forward in time and into the 19th century, the concept of absolute motion was long the norm and near the end of that century a working theory of relativity based on absolute motion had been developed. Notably, it worked at all speeds up to the speed of light. Then, at the beginning of the 20th century the modern physical philosopher Albert Einstein (1879-1955) formulated a new theory of relative motion and, in the spirit of Parmenides and Zeno, he too ignored the absoluteness of motion.\n\nWhy Einstein Ignored Absolute Motion\n\nIn a famous 1887 experiment, known as the Michelson and Morley aether experiment, it was reported that the speed of the aether wind measured far less than had been expected. Subsequently, others began referring to the Michelson and Morley null result. The experiment was hailed as the death blow to the previously popular aether concept.\n\nEvidently the experiment and the contemporary reaction had an influence on Albert Einstein.\n\nEinstein referred several times to the interferometer experiment, stating that he had thought about the result even in his student days... that after 1905 he and [Hendrik] Lorentz had discussed the Michelson-Morley experiment many times while he was working on the general theory of relativity. R. S. Shankland[8]\n\nYears later (in 1931), in a public tribute to Michelsons extensive contribution to science, Einstein acknowledges the experiments influence to his own work:\n\nMy honored Dr. Michelson, it was you who led the physicists into new paths, and through your marvelous experimental work paved the way for the development of the theory of relativity.[9]\n\nEinstein must have reasoned that if the aether could not be detected then there could be no way to detect absolute inertial motion. So he abandoned the idea of an absolute frame of reference to which motion could be referenced. Motion could only be referenced to other objects and other observers. In other words motion was relative and nothing more.\n\nAs far as Einstein was concerned, there was no aether substance that fills space.\n\nIt must be pointed out that a perfectly sound explanation of the smallness of the Michelson-Morley measurements had been developed. In 1891 the Irish physicist George F. FitzGerald explained the null result on the hypothesis that the forces binding the molecules of a solid might be modified by the motion of the solid through the [a]ether in such a way that the dimension of the stone base of the interferometer would be shortened in the direction of motion and that this contraction ... neutralizes the optical effect sought in the Michelson-Morley [aether] experiment. [10] It was a brilliant hypothesis.\n\nEssentially, FitzGeralds aether had the relativistic ability to contract the dimensions of any object: contraction occurring in the direction of motion and in proportion to the speed through the aether!\n\nThen in 1895, the Dutch physicist, Hendrik A. Lorentz (1853-1928) developed the FitzGerald hypothesis into a sound theory. Given that the atoms of all solids are held together by electrical forces, then the motion of a body as a whole would, according to Clerk Maxwells physics, superpose upon the electrostatic forces between the atoms a magnetic effect due to the motion. There would result a contraction of the body in the direction of motion which is proportional to the square of the ratio of the velocities of translation and of light and which would have a magnitude such as to annul the effect of [a]ether-drift in the Michelson-Morley interferometer. [11]\n\nThe validity of this interpretation, the FitzGerald-Lorentz interpretation, was later confirmed. Whenever the experiment was performed in a vacuum the aether-effect on the optical interferometer was (and still is) totally annulled.\n\nBut experimental results were only of secondary importance to Einstein. He was a theoretical physicist a mathematical physicist. He was a Platonic physicist to whom numbers were more real and important than apparent reality or even objective reality. If you find that strange, then prepare yourself.\n\nIt is stranger by far that Einstein would actually ignore the phenomenon that his own theory predicts. His theory of special relativity deals with the speed-of-light constancy, time dilation, mass change, and length contraction! The FitzGerald-Lorentz explanation was essentially a theory of aether-induced length contraction. Einstein, who frequently communicated with Lorentz, most certainly was aware of it. The mathematical physicist rejected the aether-induced length contraction.\n\nEinstein preferred to postulate length contraction, not relative to an aether type of space, but relative to the observer a relatively moving observer. Now since the degree of apparent length contraction is proportional to the relative speed (between observer and object) it is easy to see that different observers moving with different speeds will measure different length contraction for the same object! I hasten to add, there is nothing wrong with this; special relativity does give a logical explanation. However, special relativity gives no hint as to what the actual length contraction may be. It simply can not. It cannot deal with the absolute length contraction because it has no causal mechanism. These concrete considerations are outside the scope of the theory. That is why it is a theory of relatively moving frames-of-reference, and not a theory of length contraction.\n\nWhen Einstein turned his back on the aether medium he abandoned not only the phenomenon of absolute motion but he also abandoned all hope of attributing a cause for the length contraction associated with an objects motion.\n\nWhat makes all this into a fascinating multilevel puzzle is that, as we now know, Einstein and Lorentz were both right with respect to length contraction. Special relativity can account for apparent contraction while Lorentzs aether theory can account for absolute contraction.\n\nEinstein rejected the actuality of absolute motion for two main reasons: He misinterpreted the Michelson-Morley results, choosing to believe that absolute motion could not be detected. He sought a purely mathematical theory of motion.\n\nThe Aether Evidence and Detection of Absolute Motion\n\nAnd so, believing absolute motion could not be detected, Einstein confined his arguments to relative motion. But it was not a blind belief; he knew that if absolute motion could be detected then his relativity theory would be wrong.\n\nEinstein fully realized that his theory could not stand if the claimed discovery of aether is ever confirmed (or equivalently, if absolute motion, that is, non-rotational absolute motion, is ever detected). And of particular concern to Einstein were the claims then being made by American physicist Dayton Miller.\n\nIn letters written to colleagues he expressed his grave concern.\n\nEinstein stated in a letter, July 1925, to Edwin E. Slosson,\n\nMy opinion about Miller's [aether] experiments is the following. ... Should the positive result be confirmed, then the special theory of relativity and with it the general theory of relativity, in its current form, would be invalid. Experimentum summus judex. Only the equivalence of inertia and gravitation would remain, however, they would have to lead to a significantly different theory.[15]\n\nIn June of 1921, Einstein wrote to the physicist Robert Millikan:\n\nI believe that I have really found the relationship between gravitation and electricity, assuming that the Miller experiments are based on a fundamental error. Otherwise, the whole relativity theory collapses like a house of cards.[16]\n\nEinstein revealed (privately, at least) the vulnerable conditional component by which his theory could be shaken to its foundations. Centuries earlier, another intellectual giant, René Descartes, did much the same thing when he wrote that if the speed of light could be proved to be finite, his natural philosophy would be shaken to its foundations by the findings.\n\nAs the chronicles of history record, absolute motion, and therefore aether itself, was detected. It was detected repeatedly.\n\nIn 1902 Morley and Miller increased the sensitivity of the Michelson optical interferometer by making the arm length 430 cm (more than three times the length used in the 1887 experiment). The aether drift measured 10 km/s. Their next experiment was in 1904 and saw the first use of the Michelson interferometer mounted on a steel-girder base. Each arm was again 430 cm long. The instrument registered about 7.5 km/s. A year later, in 1905, the same steel-girder apparatus recorded 8.7 km/s. These experiments took place in Cleveland.\n\nIn a remarkable 1913 experiment, known as the Sagnac Experiment, it was shown that the aether has a dramatic effect on the speed of light. Using a rotating platform, M. G. Sagnac split light from a single monochromatic source into cw and ccw rays that traveled identical paths in opposite directions around the platform. He combined the returning rays to form a visible interference pattern, and found that the fringes shifted as the speed of rotation changed.\n\nThe procedure involved measuring the difference in the travel time of light rays circumnavigating the rotating disk (radius of 25 cm) in opposite directions. The circular path is achieved by the use of mirrors mounted on the disk along the circumference. As in the Michelson-Morley experiment, the time difference was detectable as a fringe shift of the interference pattern of the recombined light beam. Sagnac found, in agreement with prediction, a significant fringe shift. In fact, a rotational speed of 13 m/s produces a full fringe shift.\n\nIf the speed of light were locally invariant and always equal to c, then speeding up or slowing of the rotation rate of the platform should not change the location of the fringes. However, the fringes do change with speed and we can determine a preferred frame in violation of the second relativity postulate and the hypothesis of locality. [17]\n\nIn April of 1921 Dayton Millers steel-girder apparatus was tested on Mt. Wilson, California, and measured an aether flow of 10 km/s.\n\nIn Dec of 1921 the steel base was replaced with a concrete one to exclude any possible magnetic effects. Same result, 10 km/s.\n\nMillers experiments back in Cleveland during 1922-24: Various apparatus changes and procedural methods were extensively tested. Some improvements were made. Tests of intentional temperature variations in these experiments proved that under the conditions of actual observation, the periodic displacements could not possibly be produced by temperature effects[18] as is so often claimed. Throughout the many trials the optical interferometer never failed to produce consistently positive results.\n\nIn 1924 Miller again conducted experiments on Mt. Wilson and again measured about 10 km/s.\n\nThe years 1925-26 witnessed Millers definitive experiments (on Mt. Wilson). While in previous experiments the direction of relative motion between Earth and aether had been assumed, this series of experiments was designed to actually measure the direction. Readings were made throughout 24-hour periods; naturally during the 24-hour rotation of the Earth on its axis there would occur two instances when the fringe shifts became maximum thereby indicating the approximate direction of aether drift (somewhat in the manner by which the ocean tides indicate the direction of the moon). Then, by checking the direction by repeating the 24-hour test during different seasons of the Earths annual Solar orbit, the experiment establishes whether or not the main component of the aether wind is local or cosmic in origin. A more or less constant direction (in the celestial sphere) indicates a cosmic origin.[19]\n\nData were collected April 1, August 1, and September 15, 1925, and February 8, 1926. The line of motion was established but there was some uncertainty as to which diametrically opposite direction actually represented the apex of the motion. Eventually Miller concluded that the cosmic direction of motion of the Earth and the Solar System is (Right Ascension ~5h; Declination ~70°S) towards the constellation Dorado. The speed was calculated to be 208 km/s.[20]\n\nMany years later, in a non-optical experiment (performed by Roland DeWitte, in 1991) the Right Ascension direction of ~5h was dramatically confirmed.\n\nDuring subsequent decades of the 20th century there were several other significant experiments giving positive results.\n\nThen, in the year 2002 the Michelson and Morley data as well as Millers data were re-analyzed and it became clear for the first time why their measurements of aether drift were so much smaller than had been predicted. The re-analysis, undertaken by Australian Professor Reginald Cahill, actually took the Lorentz contraction into account along with the dielectric nature of the gas (air) affecting the light paths and found that the tangent-to-earth-orbit component of the aether wind matched the predicted 30 km/s.[21]\n\nAbsolute motion became an established fact.\n\nWhat Einstein had feared has come to pass. ... Zenos Nemesis finally awoke and dutifully struck another blow against abstract relativity.\n\n... continues ...\n\nNo Award for General Relativity\n\nEinsteins general theory of relativity generalizes special relativity to non-inertial frames of reference. It deals with events occurring in frames of reference that are accelerating due to motion or are accelerating due to gravitation. It is called a geometrodynamic theory. Geometric because, having no aether-type space, it uses a mathematical space defined by four coordinates. Dynamic because its mathematical space curves in accordance with the presence and motion of mass particles and bodies. And what is space curvature? Well, that is one of Einsteins abstractions. In fact it is an abstraction in geometry borrowed from Georg Friedrich Riemann (1826-66) and Nikolai Lobachevski (1792-1856).\n\nThe general relativity theory first appeared in 1915. Because it deals with gravitational acceleration it is called a theory of gravity.\n\nOthers, including Lorentz, Poincaré, and Le Sage, had made attempts to formulate a theory of gravitation. They all used an aether medium to communicate the gravity effect. The idea of using a gravitational aether has a long tradition going back to the days of Isaac Newton himself; and even earlier to René Descartes with his large and small vortices of aethereal dust producing what we would call gravitational effects.\n\nDid Einstein use a gravitational aether? ... In 1920 Einstein compared his gravitational ether with Lorentz's aether and made it clear that the aether of general relativity has no mechanical properties.\n\nThe ether of the general theory of relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities, but helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events. ... the ether of the general theory of relativity is the outcome of the Lorentzian ether, through relativization. A. Einstein\n\nRelativization!? ... In plain English, for Einstein, the aether serves no purpose; it is simply ignored, and might as well not exist. Einstein the mathematician gives aether four-dimensional coordinates, discards the aether medium, and retains the coordinates. That procedure is called relativization.\n\nThe term symbolized a new vision for a new age. Einsteins general relativity was the dawn of the age of the mathematical universes. The four-dimensional relativization of the cosmos became a serious enterprise.\n\nIn 1916 and into 1917 Einstein developed the very first model of the universe based on the new gravity theory. It was a failure. Although it was designed as a static universe it turned out to be unstable. The instability was pointed out by the Russian mathematician Alexander Friedmann. Gravity and Lambda (a cosmic antigravity effect) were initially balanced but with the slightest disturbance Einsteins universe will either contract and ultimately collapse into a self-made black hole or, alternately, expand to infinity. Nevertheless, this incipient application set the trend for the science of cosmology for the rest of the century.\n\nAlmost all the theoretical models of the universe developed during the 20th century are based, in one way or another, on general relativity. Einstein went on to design other versions of this genre. In 1932 he teamed up with Willem de Sitter and constructed an expanding universe known as the Einstein-deSitter model. It became a textbook standard for comparative big bang models.\n\nHowever, no award was ever given for general relativity. And no one not Einstein nor anyone else ever received an award for a relativized theory of our Universe. The cofounders of the big bang theory of the universe, the Russian physicist George Gamow and his doctoral student Ralph Alpher (publishing in 1946 and 1948 respectively), never made it onto the Nobel list.\n\nThere was no Award given for what has been called the discovery of the expansion of the universe and rightfully so; for no such discovery was ever made. Edwin Hubble (1889-1953), on whose behalf the claim is often made, did not discover the expansion of the universe he discovered a redshift versus distance relationship for distant galaxies. The greater the galaxys distance, the longer the wavelength of its light. To extrapolate this variation into proof of the expansion of the whole universe is pure speculation. (Nevertheless, when Modern Astrophysics gets its act together, it will belatedly recognize that Edwin Hubbles rightful claim is for the discovery of the expansion of aether-space!)\n\nThere are far too many problems with general relativity models to cover in this article. I will only highlight a few relevant issues. One is that when applied to the universe general relativity is a weak theory. Dennis Sciama describes the problem this way:\n\nFor instance, general relativity, ... is consistent with an infinite number of different possibilities, or models, for the history of the Universe. Needless to say, not more than one of these models can be correct, so that the theory permits possibilities that are not realized in Nature. In other words, it is too wide. We can put this in another way. In the absence of a theory anything can happen. If we introduce a weak theory too many things can still happen.\n\nThere are so many problems with such models that papers are written in an effort to keep track of them: Legendary astronomer Allan Sandage came up with one titled 23 astronomical problems for the next three decades and was submitted to the conference on Key Problems in Astronomy and Astrophysics (Sandage, 1995). The Russian physicist Yurij V. Baryshev has published the Conceptual Problems of Fractal Cosmology which includes several outright paradoxes and in which he concludes The roots of many of the conceptual problems of modern cosmology ... actually lie in the gravity theory. And there are web articles; for example, The Top 30 Problems with the Big Bang.\n\nSurely the most embarrassing problem is the inability to explain the observed large scale structure the network of cosmic voids surrounded by linked galaxy clusters. There is far too much regularity. Furthermore, as plasma physicist and science writer Eric J. Lerner points out, to form these structures by building up the needed motions through gravitational acceleration alone would take in excess of 100 billion years.\n\nHow the original unstructured universe evolved into its present highly structured state is a major unsolved riddle in cosmology. Edward Harrison\n\nIn the year 2003 Jaan Einasto reminded the astrophysics community to take note that the big bang models neither predict the position, nor the presence and extent of the regularity of the supercluster-void network (the largest observed structural network in the Universe). The origin of the pattern regularity and the physical scale are unknown.\n\nThen there is the metaphysical nature. General relativity converts time into a special dimension. Time was spatialized and reduced to a timeline by the c constant. But, as we all know, our world only has three dimensions. When you transform time into a fourth dimension, as Einstein did, you are modeling an imaginary mathematical universe, not any kind of real universe. You are placing your theory outside the realm of physics and, in the context of the Nobel Prize, outside the realm of contenders. And doubt not that Einstein constructed an imaginary world, for in order to make time a 4th-dimension coordinate it was necessary to multiply time by the factor (√-1) thereby converting time into an imaginary number.\n\nThere is also the perennial problem pertaining to cause. The same problem that plagued Newtons gravity theory also infests Einsteins gravity no causal mechanism.\n\nIt may never be known for certain whether these unreal aspects and metaphysical ambiguities influenced the Foundation to make policy changes for certain categories. What we do know is that after 1922 the Nobel Prize committee decided, in private, without making the decision public, to exclude discoveries and theories in astrophysics.\n\nMany years later an award was made for an astrophysics finding. Arno Penzias and Robert W. Wilson shared the Award for the Discovery of cosmic background radiation not for finding evidence of a big bang expanding universe. Their 1978 Award was for an observational phenomenon and not for its specific cause and certainly not for any general relativity theory of the universe.\n\nIn hindsight the selection committees decision to withhold judgment, regardless of motivation, was fortuitous indeed. All general relativity universe models Hot Big Bang, Cold Big Bang, Steady State, Quasi Steady State, and now the Double Dark model all treat the universe as a single-cell entity. Each one models the universe as a monolithic mathematical sphere formulated so that it is only partially visible to us. (Formulated so that no one making a critical assessment of one of these relativity-type models can say Oh! look way over there, one can see the edge of the universe!)\n\nThe models of the twentieth century were conceived as single cells. Einstein built the prototype; his legacy to cosmology built the others. However, it turns out that the Universe is actually multi-cellular; intrinsically so; and surprisingly regular.\n\nThe eminent physicist Max Planck, who himself had been awarded the Nobel Prize of 1918, nominated Einstein for the 1919 prize, for general relativity, but in vain.\n\n... continues ...\n\nFull 15-page article: Why Einstein Did Not Receive the Nobel Prize for His Theory of Relativity (www.cellularuniverse.org/R6NoNobelForRelativity-Ranzan.pdf) (PDF download)\n\nReprinted by permission of Physics Essays Publication, from Physics Essays Vol.22, No.4, p564 (2009), DOI:10.4006/1.3252983 (PDF)"
