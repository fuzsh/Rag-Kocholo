Scarce, early work about Röntgen's recent discovery, the X-rays. The volume is an early review of Röntgen's discovery of the X-rays, written by Guillaume Charles Édouard. \"The first roentgen pictures in France were made in Paris by L. Benoist and D. Hurmnuzecu, by C.E. Gauillaume, by C. Henry, by A. Lannelongue, A. Barthélemy and P. Oudin, A. Linde, by Meslans of Nancy, and by G. Séguy who worked in Le Roux laboratory at the School of Pharmacy. \"Frequent attempts were made to measure the energy of the roentgen rays, but all of these were unsuccessful on account of the minuteness of the effect produceable with the tubes in use at that time. E. Gossart and Chevallier and J. R. Rydberg observed the effect of the new rays upon a radiometer and C. E. Guillaume calculated the energy distribution within the anode of an X-ray tube. n 1896.\" Glasser, p.337 Charles Édouard Guillaume (1861-1938) was a Swiss physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1920 in recognition of the service he had rendered to precision measurements in physics by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys. In 1919, he gave the fifth Guthrie Lecture at the Institute of Physics in London with the title \"The Anomaly of the Nickel-Steels\". - Les radiations nouvelles.
