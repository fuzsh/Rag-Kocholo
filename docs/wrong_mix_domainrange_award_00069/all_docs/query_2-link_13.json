Guillaume received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1920 for the discovery and development of a pair of alloys that had characteristics invariant with temperature: one had constant length near ambient temperature, the other had constant Young's modulus. A recent analysis expresses retrospective surprise at this award: the objective of this short paper is to justify the award retrospectively, in terms of the continuing and impressive consequences of Guillaume's discoveries.",

        "text": "The first Elinvar alloy, FeNiCr, which has invariant elastic modulus over a wide temperature range, was discovered almost 100 years ago by Guillaume. The physical origin of such an anomaly has been attributed to the magnetic phase transition taking place in the system. However, the recent discovery of non-magnetic Elinvar such as multi-functional β-type Ti alloys has imposed a new challenge to the existing theories. In this study we show that random field from stress-carrying defects could suppress the sharp first-order martensitic transformation into a continuous strain glass transition, leading to continued formation and confined growth of nano-domains of martensite in a broad temperature range. Accompanying such a unique transition, there is a gradual softening of the elastic modulus over a wide temperature range, which compensates the normal modulus hardening due to anharmonic atomic vibration, resulting in a low and temperature-independent elastic modulus. The abundance of austenite/martensite interfaces are found responsible for the low elastic modulus.\n\nBased on historical data and a seminal text never translated into English, we present an original interpretation of Henri Fayol's (1841Fayol's ( -1925 administrative theory. This interpretation, which is consistent with the comments that Fayol later presented about his 'General and industrial administration' treatise, brings out his pioneering contribution to management studies. Fayol made the 'unknown' introduced by science into industry the central tenet of modern administration. He foreshadowed major aspects of today's innovation management. More fundamentally, Fayol laid new foundations for the field of management sciences. He drew from the political and philosophical works of the Enlightenment to develop a series of original concepts (in French: prévoyance, perfectionnement, programme, inconnu, corps social) that were difficult to interpret and to translate. We maintain that Fayol's administrative science is a theory of a 'creative/political' rationality that still, today, offers better theoretical and explanatory support for management science than economic and bureaucratic theory.\n\nThe HfV2–HfV2O7 composite is proposed as a material with potentially temperature-independent thermophysical properties due to the combination of anomalously increasing thermoelastic constants of HfV2 with the negative thermal expansion of HfV2O7. Based on literature data, the coexistence of both a near-zero temperature coefficient of elasticity and a coefficient of thermal expansion is suggested for a composite with a phase fraction of approximately 30 vol.% HfV2 and 70 vol.% HfV2O7. To produce HfV2–HfV2O7 composites, two synthesis pathways were investigated: (1) annealing of sputtered HfV2 films in air to form HfV2O7 oxide on the surface and (2) sputtering of HfV2O7/HfV2 bilayers. The high oxygen mobility in HfV2 is suggested to inhibit the formation of crystalline HfV2–HfV2O7 composites by annealing HfV2 in air due to oxygen-incorporation-induced amorphization of HfV2. Reducing the formation temperature of crystalline HfV2O7 from 550 °C, as obtained upon annealing, to 300 °C using reactive sputtering enables the synthesis of crystalline bilayered HfV2–HfV2O7."
