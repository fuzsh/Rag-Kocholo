The IFI has announced that it is bringing the Roadshow Release of Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight to Dublin in glorious 70mm from March 11th.

The film stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demián Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern as eight strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a stagecoach stopover some time after the American Civil War.

The film pays homage to and recreates the grand exhibition style popularised in the ‘50s and ‘60s that brought audiences to theatres with the promise of a special event. Presented in glorious Ultra Panavision 70mm, this is a longer version, with a musical overture to start the show, and a well-placed intermission.
