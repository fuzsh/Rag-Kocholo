Quentin Tarantino's first western Django Unchained, released in Irish cinemas in January this year, proved to be one of the writer / director's biggest critical successes yet. It was also a major commercial success, becoming the director's highest grossing film to date at the U.S. box office. Having expressed his interest in making a western for years before Django's release, it seems as if Tarantino isn't quite finished with the genre.

Speaking to Jay Leno on The Tonight Show, Tarantino told the host that his next film will also be a western. He explained, "I had so much fun doing Django, and I love westerns so much that after I taught myself how to make one, it's like 'OK! Let me make another one now that I know what I'm doing'." The director released no other information about his project, except that it wouldn't be a sequel to Django. The project would serve as his ninth full feature, if we include the two separate parts of Kill Bill.

It should be noted that Tarantino often mentions projects that never come to fruition, or only do so after a long gestation (as was the case with Inglorious Basterds). He has previously mentioned plans for a second World War II film called Killer Crow, a film that would complete a loose trilogy of 'revisionist' historical films, with Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds serving as the first two parts. He has also made reference to The Vega Brothers - a Pulp Fiction spin-off focused on John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson's characters - although he has said that is now unlikely to be made. Similarly, a once-teased Kill Bill: Volume 3 will "probably not" be made, according to Tarantino during a 2012 interview with We Got This Covered.

Fans of the director could be waiting a while before his next project, whatever it might turn out to be. Tarantino typically takes two or three years to develop films, while there was a six year gap between 1997's Jackie Brown and 2003's Kill Bill: Volume 1.
