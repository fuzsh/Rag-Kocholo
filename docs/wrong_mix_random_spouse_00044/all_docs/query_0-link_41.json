        "text": "With offices in Dublin, Ireland and Padova, Italy, our goal is to make the benefits of complex data science accessible to a wide range of industries. With advanced knowledge of data science, and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we help companies navigate and interpret highly complex projects.\n\nSimone Pampuri\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nSimone is in charge of Statwolf’s strategy and business development. Having spent years researching and developing Machine Learning-based software for big companies, Simone understands how to bridge the gap between academic research and business use cases. His main goal is to give business decision-makers access to the huge advantages of Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics. Simone has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Machine Learning from the University of Pavia (Italy), and has published many peer-reviewed journals. Before joining the founding team at Statwolf, Simone was a Post-Doctoral Researcher at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM). He loves Quentin Tarantino movies, corgi dogs and over-priced protein shakes.\n\nAndrea Schirru\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\nAndrea is responsible for the technical roadmap and implementation process of the Statwolf platform. As a passionate software developer, he is always looking for ways to make Statwolf even smarter and more efficient. His skills include software architecture, data modelling and server-side software implementation. After earning a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from the University of Pavia (Italy) in 2011, he held postdoctoral positions there, as well as at the University of Maynooth (Ireland). He was also a Process Development Researcher at Infineon Technologies. While not working, Andrea enjoys the true pleasures of life – like Irish Angus fillet steak, a glass of Italian wine, and carefully selected company."
