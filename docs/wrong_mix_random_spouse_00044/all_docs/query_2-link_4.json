It will be a long one, so you may not make it to the end. I’ll start with what Steve Coyle (past GM) said about the 3 of them:\n\n“Of all the outstanding employees working at Miller’s Sandra, Larry and Dalia are probably the best known. Every day they exemplify and practice Miller’s core values by being customer centric, using their superior industry knowledge and empowerment to perform at the highest level while demonstrating and leading us with a contagious positive attitude. For more than 25 years our customers and employees have trusted, depended and counted on Sandra, Larry and Dalia to meet, and even exceed their expectations, to guarantee their satisfaction. Beyond that, customers and employees alike have enjoyed Sandra’s, Larry’s and Dalia’s warm greetings, engaging conversations and humorous anecdotes. In a world gone digital it is nice to know there are people who care behind the firewall, who will pick up the phone, greet you with a smile when you visit and do whatever it takes to make you happy. Sandra, Larry and Dalia are those people, and we are delighted to have them representing and working at Miller’s.”\n\nObservations from Josh Miller (Ops Director and my business partner):\n\n“Dalia has been here since before we went digital, running bluelines and making deliveries, then working her way up to manager in a digital world.” She has learned and progressed continuously over 27 years. When we ask her to help in a role, she gives it her all.”\n\nSandra has been working here since September of 1980 (missing meeting our founder/my grandad by four months). “Making it though several generational ownership changes of Miller’s and additional GMs is a true testament to her dedication and ability to adapt to a changing workplace.”\n\n“Customers love to just stop by and chat with Larry, even when they don’t have any work to pick up or drop off. Some even choose us over closer competitors just to talk to him.”\n\nInterview with Sandra (9/2/1980)- a Metric Blvd store employee\n\nWhat is your first memory? “Oh my gosh, it’s how crazy the little trio of Marty (Speed), Bobbie Sparrow and Dee (Turegano) all were. They always were telling stories about the crazy things they did at the old location on 10th Street by the bus station. Break in the lunchroom was always fun because at least one of them was there telling stories! Oh, and the survey department crew – It was like a comedy show all the time – pranksters! Not offensive, just fun.”\n\nDo you remember any of the 10th Street location stories?\n\n“Yeah, one was when some of the men carried Bobbie’s VW bug and put it upright in the elevator there! And another time, Bobbie got lingerie at Yaring’s on Congress and some pranksters hung it all up, I think on the elevator again. And then at 6th Street, I never met Evelyn (a long time switchboard operator) but I heard one day she went to the water fountain, pushed the button and said “Good Morning. Miller Blueprint” – everybody was just cracking up at her.”\n\nWhat brought you here?\n\n“The VOE (Vocational Education) program at my highschool, Del Valle. I started as a tenth grader. The teacher found the business to interview with and I came and interviewed with Harry Lind (GM at the time). He was really nice, really laid back and made the interview easy. My teacher kept asking me if I had a job and I didn’t hear back and didn’t hear back. Finally I called and he said “oh yeah, come on in.” And back then, you could take a lunch hour and run a bunch of errands. Now it takes a whole hour to just go get something to eat!” (Sandra started as a part time switchboard operator, then moved to our retail sales floor where we sold drafting supplies and later art supplies. In a handful of years she was in our accounting department and has been there ever since I bet she has learned to do things manually and been through at least 3 if not 4 different software packages – she has had to learn lots to keep up with the advances in technology, just like all of our employees making prints!)\n\nWhy have you stayed? (I said to each one “just too lazy to go look?” and get a laugh)\n\nI liked the people I worked with. Where else would you find such nice people and all the benefits you offer? Who would want to go anywhere else? I tried [a nationwide nonprofit] but I lasted a day! I didn’t feel the warmth I felt at Miller’s. I kept saying I’d go back to school at ACC but I just never did. I was happy here so that’s where I stayed. We always just have a good batch of people. I remember your dad, Harry, Smitty… I finally cracked Gene Wilde- it took years before Gene finally warmed up. Then we were best buddies.”\n\nInterview with Dalia Gonzalez (4/15/96) and Larry Williams (5/5/97) – both are 7th Street employees\n\nWhat’s kept you here for 25 plus years?\n\nDalia: “Getting to learn stuff all the time. I ran bluelines where we fed every vellum in to get one print, Highway Plan department where we checked out mylars at the Highway Department and ran the prints for bid lettings, delivery driver, plat department and reprographics – lots to learn here! And, it’s a family owned business and not corporate.” (Dalia ran the plat department when it was a wet process. We had true blueprint paper that you would expose to the negative we had filed away, soak it in a bath -of what I don’t remember, rinse it off and literally hang it to dry. The print was either blue with white lines or white with deep blue lines depending on whether the negative was reversed out or not. Those prints would never fade so our surveyor customers liked to take those in the field. Hence, when ammonia processed blueLINEs came into being, we kept the old fashioned blueprint process going for the surveyors’ plat map orders. We think we were one of the last in the states to quit producing true blueprints.)\n\nLarry: “Good people, good job situation, flexibility to play music and be creative. Those things are more important than they might sound. If one (thing) were off I might have to go do something different. Most of the people we’ve had have just been fun people to be around. Our customers are so diverse it keeps it fun. Seeing Josh grow up has been pretty cool (Josh began at age 13 riding his bike to work and working a couple of hours to keep him out of trouble in the summers!) Came in high school and amazed at how he is now. It’s been fun to see Madi grow up too – she making decisions, finishing things up, great to see her doing this. Remember the fun we had on Fridays after work at El Mercado?” Dalia: “yeah. Always the same group going to El Mercado on South 1st on Fridays. Fun memories.”\n\nWhat is your first memory of working at Miller?\n\nLarry; “It’s all slammed together. But a first one was talking with Clark (art supply managers) and learning about all of our art and drafting supplies. Meeting Frances (a favorite, long-time employee). And learning just how serious they were taking everything. I was on the same page! Felt like I was sort of maturing. Learning how to interact with people, keep them interested and just helping students. That poured into helping instructors. I remember the Art Extravaganzas that we threw – the baby expos at Millers – classes, meeting great people.”\n\nDalia: “running blueprints. Bluelines, rollvac sepias, and the wet process true blueprints that we ran just for plats.”\n\nWhat are some other early or good memories?\n\nLarry: “I love memories of Robert Miller telling jokes. He’d just make fun out of nowhere and it would hurt everybody so good – you’d never see it coming. He was a serious yet funny man – ‘Larry, what is this I found by the (xyz)?’ and it would be some super broken stuff. And I don’t know, someone would be mad – he’d come out of nowhere with some hilarity. And the break room? Robert, Gene Wilde and (a regular surveyor customer) – drinking coffee and telling the best old man jokes you just didn’t expect it!”\n\nDalia: “Frances’ going away party when Presley (our Taco Deli route driver) came and did a strip tease for her.” (removed shirt only I’m told, but Frances was definitely red! Never looked away but turned red!)\n\nLarry: “I love it when people come in and say ‘THIS is what I used to get (Skyline and Dynamics) and now I know where to go!’ they realize not only is it easier to work with us but the end result is remarkably better across the board.”\n\nDalia “I like it when people say ‘you guys are great! You are better than kinkos/fedex!”\n\nLarry likes that Dalia is still coming up with “new things” – Last week Dalia suggested polypropylene repro prints for a birthday banner for Larry’s wife’s 50th birthday party – super fun idea! Larry as a customer was actually surprised at how good it came out. Thought he’d have to use our graphics team for the banner but got it done in repro. (Repro is generally faster and a more economical price. The equipment in all departments just keeps getting better!)\n\nOkay, who is the most famous person you’ve seen at Miller? (no certain order and most were at the 6th Street store)? Dalia and Larry came up with this list:\n\nDavid Byrne (of the Talking Heads)\n\nRobert Rodriguez\n\nMike Judge (King of the Hill / Beevis and Butthead)\n\nThe Paul Mitchell dude\n\nTye Pennington (that was in the last year at our 7th Street store)\n\n“Shoot, the most famous were employees here! Natalie Sideserf (of Texas Cakebakers show and cake baking fame) and Brad Neeley. Brad was working on the salesfloor – he just broke out in his voices – we’d all crack up.” (Larry is wiki on Brad Neeley. According to Larry, Brad is the writer of Southpark and supervised it for 2 years. He started We Are Wizards at Alamo Drafthouse. Disney stories were read in a wizard voice. It would sell it out for two days straight. Larry also mentions Cartoon Washington. Spike and Mike tried to steal it, and Southpark hired him. Now created Babycakes, Professor Illinois and also his own show on cartoon network. I have not fact-checked Larry)\n\nIn closing, I read the nice things Steve Coyle wrote about them:\n\nDalia, “And he is right. We do go out of our way to make sure the customer is happy.”\n\nI’m so proud of these 3 wonderful employees and all that they mean to our customers and our business. Thank you each wonderful person here. You have contributed so much!\n\nSincerely – Luci Miller\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nName: Ian Johnson\n\nTitle: Service Manager\n\nWhat do you do for Miller?
