        "text": "Quentin Tarantino is going back to the drawing board for his 10th and final film. The auteur had been preparing to start shooting The Movie Critic this year, but is backing away from the project, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nTarantino had been honing The Movie Critic for months. Set in 1977 California, it initially drew inspiration from a cynical movie critic that the filmmaker grew up reading. But sources say it morphed along the way into a film that would feature Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth, the stuntman he portrayed in an Oscar-winning performance in Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It is unclear if this film was going to be a prequel or a 1970s-set sequel to Hollywood. But in recent weeks, Tarantino had a change of heart again and moved away from the film entirely.\n\nThe project was going to shoot for one day in August to qualify for a $20.5 million California Tax Credit, before it began production in earnest in early 2025. That is now no longer on the table.\n\nNo studio was attached to The Movie Critic, which becomes the latest project to fall by the wayside for Tarantino. He previously worked on an R-rated Star Trek movie for Paramount that did not come to fruition. There was speculation that Sony, which released Hollywood, would be a natural home for Tarantino’s latest.\n\nTHR first broke the news of the feature more than a year ago in March, and it has been the subject of much speculation, given Tarantino’s pledge to retire from directing after making one final project, his 10th. (He has made nine films, if you count the two-part Kill Bill movies as one feature.)\n\nHe has long maintained that he wants to go out on the top of his game.\n\nIn 2012, he told Playboy, “I want to stop at a certain point. Directors don’t get better as they get older. Usually the worst films in their filmography are those last four at the end. I am all about my filmography, and one bad film f—s up three good ones. I don’t want that bad, out-of-touch comedy in my filmography, the movie that makes people think, ‘Oh man, he still thinks it’s 20 years ago.’ When directors get out-of-date, it’s not pretty.”\n\nTarantino is expected to continue working in the creative fields even after he makes one last feature. He has suggested directing limited series or plays could be in his future. He is also now a novelist, publishing a novelization of Hollywood in 2021. Among its revelations was a deeper understanding of Cliff Booth’s backstory and psychology.\n\nThe Tribeca Festival has announced the features lineup for its 2024 edition, which will open with the world premiere of Hulu documentary Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge, directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Trish Dalton.\n\nOther highlights in this year’s features lineup include the world premieres of documentaries about Liza Minnelli (Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story), Harry Belafonte (Following Harry, exploring his life and legacy through the artists and activists carrying on his work, which will be followed by the presentation of the 2024 Harry Belafonte Voices for Social Justice Award), Renee Elise Goldsberry (Satisfied), Ani DiFranco (1-800-ON-HER-OWN), Linda Perry (Let It Die Here) and Avicii (I’m Tim) dream hampton (It Was All a Dream) and “the Brat Pack” (the Andrew McCarthy-directed BRATS) and the New York premiere of Dawn Porter’s Luther Vandross documentary, Never Too Much.\n\nTribeca Festival will also feature screenings of Jazzy, with Lily Gladstone in Morrisa Maltz’s follow-up to The Unknown Country; Daddio, starring Dakota Johnson and Sean Penn; Firebrand starring Alicia Vikander and Jude Law; Michael Angarano’s Sacramento, starring Michael Cera, Kristen Stewart and Maya Erskine; All That We Love, starring Margaret Cho and Jesse Tyler Ferguson; the psychological thriller McVeigh, based on the Oklahoma City bombing; and the world premiere of Tiffany Paulsen’s Winter Spring Summer or Fall starring Jenna Ortega and Percy Hynes White.\n\nThe festival will also world premiere two comedian-centric docs: The Kevin Hart-produced Group Therapy, with Neil Patrick Harris, Mike Birbiglia and Tig Notaro, and Outstanding: A Comedy Revolution, with Lily Tomlin, Wanda Sykes, Rosie O’Donnell, Hannah Gadsby and Joel Kim Booster.\n\n“Each year, the Tribeca Festival reflects our culture, capturing the essence of the present moment. We’re thrilled to showcase our 23rd edition, delving into captivating explorations of artificial intelligence with Demis Hassabis, thought-provoking discussions on the future of democracy, and so much more,” Tribeca co-founder and CEO Jane Rosenthal said in a statement. “Storytelling possesses a remarkable ability to bring us together, offering hope in these challenging times. We eagerly anticipate engaging with audiences on difficult yet timely subjects.”\n\nTribeca Festival director and senior vp, programming, Cara Cusumano, added: “In a year of record high submissions, despite industry-wide challenges, and global tumult, our incredible filmmaking community delivered again with some of the most surprising, inspiring, hilarious, galvanizing, boundary-breaking, and downright entertaining work we’ve had the privilege to feature at the festival. Whether grappling with everything from the crisis of global democracy to the most intimate of human dramas, it was heartening to be reminded of the undeniable power of a great film to illuminate our world.”\n\nThe features lineup for year’s festival, which marks the first time the Viewpoints interdisciplinary section will be in competition, was selected from more than 13,000 submissions and consists of 103 feature films from 114 filmmakers across 48 countries. The festival will feature 86 world premieres, two international premieres, six North American premieres and eight New York premieres. Half of the films in competition are directed by women, while 35 percent of the feature films at the 2024 festival are directed by filmmakers who are Black, indigenous or people of color. Thirty of the films in this year’s competition are directed by first-time filmmakers and 25 directors in the 2024 lineup are returning to Tribeca.\n\nThe 2024 Tribeca Festival, the 23rd edition of the annual New York event, is set to run from June 5-16 in New York.\n\nMore information about this year’s festival is available here.\n\nLast April, Jason Kelce entered the NFL’s West Coast media hub in Inglewood, California (it’s right next door to SoFi Stadium), with trepidation. In an otherwise nondescript conference room, Kelce talked with those sitting with him about the difficulties that NFL stars can have after they retire from the game, an attendee recalls.\n\nKelce was in Los Angeles to attend the NFL’s broadcast boot camp, which gives players a chance to hone their skills for TV, radio, podcasts and other mediums.\n\n“So many guys are interested in, ‘How can I stay in football?’ ‘I think I’d be good on TV, but I’m not really sure,’ ” Tracy Perlman, the NFL’s senior vp player operations, told The Hollywood Reporter at the time about the boot camp. “So this gives them the opportunity to learn about it and understand the commitment it takes, and it gives them the reps to figure out, ’Am I good at this or not?’ ”\n\nAnd Kelce, who already had a hit podcast when he entered the camp (New Heights, which he co-hosts with his brother, Travis Kelce), “crushed it,” in the words of the attendee.\n\n“We all knew he’s gonna be a star, if he wants to be,” they added.\n\nJason and Travis Kelce found fame for their on-the-field football skills, but the pair have since become two of the hottest names in the media business, and interest in their services is said to be in high demand.\n\nLook no further than Travis Kelce’s latest gig: game show host. Kelce, while still an active tight end with the Kansas City Chiefs, has been taping a reimagining of the game show Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader? for Amazon Prime Video titled Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? with famous faces replacing the titular schoolkids. Prime announced the 20-episode pickup Wednesday.\n\nThe Chiefs star signed with CAA last year for his off-the-field work.\n\nDuring this year’s Super Bowl week in Las Vegas, Jason Kelce (likely aware that he would officially retire a month later) was courted by many of the league’s broadcast partners, seeking to entice him to their studio shows or broadcast booths (The Athletic named CBS, NBC and ESPN as potential landing spots).\n\nHe already has made one high-profile appearance since retiring: On April 6, Jason Kelce and teammate Lane Johnson donned Eagles-themed luchador masks and helped WWE star Rey Mysterio win his match at Wrestlemania 40 on April 6, with the crowd giving the Eagles stars a standing ovation.\n\nBut while Jason is pursuing NFL-related options, Travis already is thinking beyond the game show. The Chiefs star, of course, hosted Saturday Night Live last year, and he recently told THR that he is interested in pursuing scripted roles as well.\n\n“I’m out here in L.A. trying to get more comfortable in the entertainment world before we start back up with this football thing, knowing that that’s my main focus in my life, and it’ll always be that until I’m done playing,” Kelce said. “But I’m definitely still dabbling in the scripted world, the entertainment world, and we’ll see where that road takes me. I’m extremely excited, but at the same time, I know I’m a bit of an amateur in that world, so I definitely got to get comfortable and, I don’t know, put my own creativity on it.”\n\nTravis also was in Hollywood to record an episode of New Heights, joined in person by Jason, now a year after his turn at the NFL’s broadcast boot camp. And they had a surprise guest: action star and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was appearing on their podcast for an extended interview.\n\nSchwarzenegger heaped praise on the brothers for their authenticity and the fun they have on the show, before moving the conversation to a topic he said should maybe be “off the record.”\n\n“A lot of times you guys do the show where you are in another place and you are in another place, right? And it’s this split-screen thing which really works well, yeah,” Schwarzenegger said, noting how Jason and Travis would host the show from their respective homes in Pennsylvania and Kansas City during the NFL season. “But now you’re together, because you’re in Hollywood. There are reasons — I’m not stupid, right — there’s a reason why those guys got you together in Hollywood. I mean, there’s all kinds of interviews being scheduled.”\n\nThe brothers laughed it off, though Travis wondered aloud if he had any parts available.\n\nBut it is New Heights that could end up being the brothers’ biggest deal yet. The show routinely performed well on Apple and Spotify podcast charts since its debut in 2022, and it often hit No. 1 after Travis Kelce’s romance with music superstar Taylor Swift went public near the start of the last NFL season.\n\nNow the show is being shopped around for a new deal, with Swift herself sporting a New Heights baseball cap at Coachella earlier this month.\n\nAnd while the podcast market writ large has cooled, top shows are still scoring big paydays.\n\nJoe Rogan reupped with Spotify in a deal estimated at $250 million, and the Jason Bateman-, Will Arnett- and Sean Hayes-hosted SmartLess left Amazon for SiriusXM in a $100 million deal. An eight-figure deal for New Heights certainly has to be in play.\n\n“I think everybody’s kind of shocked on how it’s taken off the way it has,” Travis Kelce told THR. “But we just started off by wanting to showcase our brotherhood and our similarities knowing that we’re really two different walks of life. … We wanted to give people a firsthand look at what it’s like to be at the lunch table or at the dinner table with Jason and Travis Kelce.”\n\nAnd while the topic of conversation over dinner for most of their adult lives has been football, Hollywood is calling, and the doors are opening.\n\nIt might make for new dinner conversation fodder.\n\nMax‘s Conan O’Brien Must Go is a travel show with a twist.\n\n“My mission is that you learn nothing about the country,” O’Brien explained on a spectacular recent installment of the Hot Ones web series, an appearance that I’m confident did more to boost the visibility of Conan O’Brien Must Go than the dozens of marketing dollars Warner Bros. surely put into the series. “My job is that you know less about the country after I’m done than when I started.”\n\nWhile O’Brien’s performance on Hot Ones — especially after pronouncing that he’d never encountered a spice until his 50s — may have surprised some observers, few of the late night veteran’s devotees will be surprised that his assessment of Conan O’Brien Must Go is disingenuous. Or at least it’s a hair disingenuous. Conan O’Brien Must Go isn’t the sort of travel series that will leave viewers with “knowledge,” per se. But over four episodes, knowledge inevitably sneaks in.\n\nConan O’Brien Must Go is a smartly dumb show — or a stupidly smart show — focused (loosely) on what is essential about travel. It’s a series about arriving in a new place open to meeting new people, learning new languages, tasting new foods and experiencing uncomfortable new circumstances … and then making fun of them, when all the while you’re mostly mocking yourself and the fears people have about stepping outside of their comfort zones.\n\nOr maybe it’s just a show about Conan O’Brien making fun of travel shows. However expansive or limited your perspective, and however expansive or limited O’Brien’s perspective, Conan O’Brien Must Go is a very silly and occasionally illuminating series that’s still finding its rhythms and its comic voice as the fourth episode concludes. That leaves the show’s biggest takeaway as “Wait, that’s it? I want more.”\n\nAlthough O’Brien has done travel-centric material in the past — I’d argue that the international jaunts were the pinnacle of his TBS show — Conan O’Brien Must Go is more an extension of his podcast Conan O’Brien Needs a Fan.\n\nConan O’Brien Must Go finds the host heading abroad to meet with and provide assistance to listeners/viewers/fans from around the world. That gives the impression of something more structured than what actually occurs.\n\nYes, Conan goes to Thailand to help a young woman stand up to her overbearing mother, attempts to get radio play for a Norway-based fan’s hip-hop flavored band, submits to portraiture from an artist in Argentina, and meets with three Pakistani-Irish siblings in Dublin. But those activities are more pretense than premise.\n\nThe visits — deemed “surprise visits” in some cases — really set a tone more than anything else, something along the lines of “playfully combative” in a vein that will be familiar to podcast listeners. O’Brien likes busting chops and admires people who are prepared to fight back. One of the things that O’Brien is best at is never seeming to be punching down — which isn’t easy on a literal level, given that O’Brien towers over his guests, but it isn’t easy on any level since O’Brien will always be a generally famous, Harvard-educated TV personality and his new friends tend not to be. It takes astonishing calibration to go to a foreign country, find somebody for whom English may not be a first language, and keep the joke from ever being as facile as, “Ha, ha, I’m making fun of you and you don’t get it.” Sure, that might be a layer of the humor at times, but the host is careful to situate himself and his own discomfort as the real target of the joke.\n\nWhen O’Brien wants to have somebody he can make fun of mercilessly, that’s where somebody like longtime collaborator Jordan Schlansky comes in. Schlansky plays a key part in the Argentina episode, taking on the much more traditional role as the travel host who did his research and knows bits of trivia about nearly everything, so O’Brien ribs him mercilessly for doing his homework. Even then, the joke tends to be that Schlansky is right and Conan just doesn’t care.\n\nOr as O’Brien puts it, “Whenever I visit a new country, I like to learn the local customs, so I can ignore them.”\n\nO’Brien is an appreciator of the genre, and Conan O’Brien Must Go is an appreciative tweaker of the genre, in some of the same ways the host used to treat the talk show format back when he was a Young Turk. The Norway episode is dominated by O’Brien and company’s enthusiastic over-reliance on drone shots, going so far as to have him running around carrying the drone in Oslo, where flying such crafts is apparently illegal. There are multiple occasions — the street food scene in Bangkok and a butcher’s shop in Dublin — where O’Brien makes sure to sample “extreme” foods, while acknowledging that that’s what travel hosts do. I’ve seen more travel hosts than I could count navigating the floating markets of Thailand, but I’ve never seen a host do it with a squeaking rubber chicken and an Angry Birds hat, clutching a carved dildo.\n\nAnd then sometimes Conan just wants to be really goofy! He performs a song on a popular Thai variety show, attempts the tango and Muay Thai boxing, and goes on a quest for Bono in a public park in Dublin. He’s game for anything as long as he can look ridiculous. Not everything works, exactly, but you can always sense O’Brien and his writers restlessly scanning the horizon for the next fun thing to do along their journey.\n\nOne thing they haven’t figured out how to do, or figured out if they want to do, is be wholly sincere. The episode in Ireland is couched in the idea that this is an opportunity for O’Brien to trace his roots on Max’s dime, but any time the proceedings get too close to an actual emotion, he beats a hasty retreat into the absurd. Episodes all conclude with obligatory, humor-free summations of his experiences — again, a nod to travel-show convention amid the freewheeling wackiness — and knowing Conan’s work, it’s easy to feel like he could, if he chose to, keep 95 percent of the eager-to-please foolishness and also weave in some authentic feelings.\n\nOr maybe that’s just not something Conan O’Brien Must Go aspires to. In that same Hot Ones segment, O’Brien described his goal, again disingenuously, as making viewers dumber after each 40-minute episode than they were when they began. He’ll have to settle for “more entertained.” Bring on season two."
