        "text": "Oscar winning director and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino has said that he is “ready to quit” making films, following a hugely successful career spanning three decades.\n\nBack in 2009, Tarantino whose CV includes films like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Django, had stated his desire to finish with making films when he turned in 60, which he did on March 27.\n\nHe said that he was keen to “go and write novels and cinema literature, stuff like that”.\n\nTarantino once again stated this aspiration in 2014, while promoting his 2015 film The Hateful Eight, but added that this was “not etched in stone”.\n\nHe also hinted that he had possibly reached the end of the directing road back in 2019, in an interview with Austrailian GQ magazine.\n\n“I think when it comes to thearetical movies, I’ve come to the end of the road. I see myself writing film books and starting to write theatre. So I’ll still be creative. I just think I’ve given all I have to give to movies”, Tarantino said at the time.\n\nWill The Movie Critic Be Tarantino’s Last Hurrah?\n\nLast month, we were informed of the title of Tarantino’s upcoming film project.\n\nThe film is called The Movie Critic, which is set to feature a female lead character and in the 1970s.\n\nIt had been reported that The Movie Critic was set to explore the life and works of Pauline Kael, whose work had always been admired by Tarantino.\n\nHaving worked for The New York Reporter between 1968 and 1991, Kael gained a reputation for her harsh and opionated film reviews, which occasionally landed her in hot water with film makers and editors alike.\n\nShe also worked as a consultant for Paramount Pictures.\n\n“Yes, it is part of the landscape”, Tarantino had said when asked if Kael was an influence on The Movie Critic. “The story takes place in a world where Pauline Kael exists, and is alluded to, but the film is not about her”.\n\nThe interview also saw Tarantino asked if he decided to leave the world of cinema on the back of The Movie Critic, “in the sense of wanting to leave a perfect filmography”.\n\n“No, I think not. It’s just that I’ve been making movies for 30 years and I’m ready to quit”, he insisted.\n\nQuentine Taratino is to begin work on The Movie Critic in the Autumn."
