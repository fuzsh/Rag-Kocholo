        "text": "Hi Sean, Kevin, Jake and Gabe,\n\nMy name is Andrew and I am an emergency medicine doctor working here in Ireland. Iâm finally getting around to this and want to take a moment to share my gratitude for what you guys on this podcast mean to me.\n\nFirst things first, if youâre wondering how to say my last name, Ngaditono, Iâll tell you what I tell both my colleagues and patients. I say, âitâs pronounced Naditono, the G is silentâ. Sadly, only a few would get my Django reference.\n\nI first came across the Reelblend podcast last year when I needed to commute for an hour and a half to my hospital. I was immediately enamoured by the lively discussions that stemmed from you guysâ deep friendships and love for movies. Ever since, Reelblend has been the way for me to unwind while driving home after a busy shift in the ED. This is even more so in 2020 when we have to deal relentlessly with the stress of Covid in the frontline.\n\nMy own love for movies started very young. I remember fondly how my dad would bring me and my mom to the cinemas nearly every Saturday, walked up to the ticket booth, and asked the ticket seller to line up all the new releases that week for us to watch on the day. Back to back to back movies; it was insane! What I loved, though, was the in-depth conversations that we would have as a family. I think that is why I fell in love with your podcast, and perhaps found it somewhat nostalgic.\n\nTwo points to close. Firstly, Iâve found that Joel Edgertonâs 2017 film âIt Comes At Nightâ perfectly summed up all things 2020 and has aged well. The increasing paranoia and distrust that built up between the two families living together in that film was such an eerie foreshadowing of our current societal fear to an unseen threat.\n\nNext, Avengers: Endgame is the greatest superhero movie of all time. What Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios, and the Russo brothers have accomplished with Endgame is beyond epic worthy of all the accolades. Iâll go to my grave with that statement.\n\nThank you again for faithfully recording this wonderful podcast that allow me as a listener to feel like I am also engaging in the discussion. If you guys are ever in Dublin, it would be awesome to hang out over a pint or three of Guinness! Until then...HUBIE!!!!"
