        "text": "University of Glasgow has been nominated for a good article reassessment. Please leave your comments and help us to return the article to good article quality. If concerns are not addressed during the review period, the good article status will be removed from the article. Reviewers' concerns are here. --Malleus Fatuorum\n\nThe new rankings hit the newsstands and web today (August 20). Be vigilant in simply updating the numeric score, rather than reproducing every single ranking or expanding the rankings into the lead or other sections. Also, from this AP report, another interesting ranking from the American Council of Trustees and Alumni grading general curricular requirements available here. I'm a bit preoccupied with RL issues at the moment, but I would appreciate it some enterprising editor could update Template:Infobox US university ranking to both include the ACTA as well updated references for USNWR. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nWhy would we include a terribly flawed ranking published by a far right wing group intent only pushing their viewpoint and agenda? --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nEvery ranking employs methodologies of questionable merit to push the particular publisher's viewpoint and agenda, so I don't believe we can draw the line in the sand there. However, if this group is actually the educational analogue (or extension) of a CATO Institute, John Birch Society, or some such unabashedly partisan organization as ElKevbo asserts, then I stand corrected and it probably should not be included. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nI RFA and see that ACTA is sponsored by the Bradley Foundation and John M. Olin Foundation which are demonstrably conservative organizations, but I don't see them as explicitly partisan. I'm not wed to the idea of including them in the template nor does their methodology seem entirely transparent and airtight, but I nevertheless like to see notable and reliable rankings in which \"the usual suspects\" don't rank that highly as a litmus test for the NPOV tolerance of editors. Forbes and Washington Monthly do a nice job of upsetting the USNWR status quo, in this regard. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nI recommend you do a little bit more research about this organization. They're not the worst group in the world but they are explicitly partisan.\n\nRegardless of the organization's flaws or strengths, we need to ensure that their ranking is notable before including it anywhere. I see that it has been mentioned a few times in mainstream sources but I'm not satisfied that this new ranking has risen to the level that merits inclusion in this template. I expect that this ranking will fade into obscurity very quickly but only time will tell. --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nRe: the updating of the template, would it be worth adding a small message at the top of the template for a couple days saying \"USNWR has released new rankings, please update the template\" or would that be too disruptive? Also, have the education/engineering/med school rankings also been updated? All of UChicago's are the same. — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nHey everyone. Basically I've been doing a lot of work on the Colgate University article, and I could use someone to sanity check it for me. I guess I could submit it to WP:PR, but I'm not entirely sure that it's even at that level yet. Could someone stop by and give their thoughts on the article? There's always room for improvement, but since I've been going it alone, I could use another set of eyes before taking it anywhere. Oh, and perhaps a reassessment in order; the article is current ranked as C, but that was given quite awhile ago. Thanks! — HelloAnnyong (say whaaat?!)\n\nI just prodded this article and gave my reasoning on its talk page - essentially I think the topic is too undefined and vague, yet simultaneously too specific to the workings of each university to really develop into a broad-based and well-cited article. I would imagine that each college's article (or if there are articles about dormitories) could make a note about whatever kind of iteration of an RHA that college does or doesn't have. If you have any thoughts on remedying the underlying problem, please go ahead and fix it, but I don't think adding a lot more citations about every college's unique situation will be helpful. Thanks! Surfer83 (talk)\n\nHi, Texas State University's rating is currently \"start.\" Will someone reevaluate it, bringing it's Article rating up to date? Also, a list provided on what more to improve about the article would be very much appreciated. Thanks, --147.26.208.127 (talk)\n\nWhat does everyone think of the new {{Cleanup-university}}? I tried to model it after the new {{Cleanup}}, but I'm not terribly skilled with these things. Feel free to tweak some of my mistakes. --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nI looked through the table of contents for all the talk pages and couldn't find an answer to this: Is there a consensus as to what it means for a University to be \"established\" on wikipedia? The issue has arisen on a couple pages I've worked on. First, in a discussion today here Talk:University of Kansas, I maintain that the date must be either when the university opened to students (1866) or was chartered by the legislature (1864). However, KU's seal says \"Estalished 1865.\" I can't find anything to support this date on the seal. Notably, KU's website does not reference anything happening on 1865. The KU website states: \"Opened in 1866, the University of Kansas is a comprehensive educational and research institution...\"[1] Likewise, the history linked on KU's own website begins: \"When the University of Kansas opened on September 12, 1866...\" [2]. This Kansas Cyclopedia history also does not support 1865.\n\nWith respect to ancient universities, a consensus has arisen that the foundation date is the date the institute is recognized by a royal or papal charter. (See List of oldest universities in continuous operation.) I did some work on this page, University of Santiago de Compostela, and although the university itself claims to be founded in 1495, and actually celebrated its 500th anniversary in 1995[3], wikipedia states it was founded in 1526 based on the date it was chartered by Papal Bull.\n\nFinally, Iowa State University presents another case. Its infobox claims it was \"established\" in 1858. I'm not sure where this date comes from. The legislature chartered it in 1856, and it admitted its first students in 1868. The university apparently celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007. Clarity and consensus on this point would be useful.-Kgwo1972 (talk)\n\nTechnically, founding year is whatever an institutions says it is. For example, Boston College uses its charter date but Boston University doesn't. Sometimes schools will even absorb others and take the other's founding year, if it's older, like in the case of University of New England (although I maintain that this is a rather questionable practice). It's not regulated in the U.S. any more than \"college\" vs. \"university\" is, and University of Kansas probably says 1865 because it's a compromise between 1864 and 1866. It's not really a big deal, so if the seal says 1865 I'd just leave it at that and make a note explaining the confusion (like at Harvard University). --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nOK, so I will change the founding date for the University of Santiago de Compostela to 1495 (which it already is on the Spanish wiki, I've noticed). -Kgwo1972 (talk)\n\nMakes sense if a) that's what the university claims as its founding year and b) there are no legal statutes or other regulations that would void such a claim. Obviously, you can't just make stuff up, but most institutions' official histories are generally considered reliable enough when it comes to a year of establishment. --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nThe university claims that date, and in fact had a major event to celebrate its 500 anniversary in 1995.[4] -Kgwo1972 (talk)\n\nAs for Iowa State (sorry I neglected to address that), the history on their website ([5])) says 1858. It's the second footnote in the article. Seems you were incorrect about the charter date for Iowa State (the bill was introduced in 1856 but wasn't signed into law until 1858). --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nI took those dates from the wikipedia article itself, so I guess those are wrong. Anyway, I did look up further information on ISU's 150th anniversary celebration, and it was from 2007 to 2008, so that jibes with 1858.-Kgwo1972 (talk)\n\nAgreed, as I posted on Talk:University of Kansas, I don't believe it's ultimately up to wikipedia editors to decide that a university was established at a date other than what the university claims. Also, there is no more data to support changing the date in the article to 1866 than there is for 1865. Finally, one of the articles that Kgwo1972 found cites 1865 as the year the board of regents for the University of Kansas first met, so I'm guessing that is why the University uses '65 as their establishment date. Ryan2845 (talk)\n\nAs I commented on various talk pages (including this one) a very long time ago, I believe that the \"established\" field in the {{infobox University}} template should be made non-mandatory, so that it would not be necessary to choose one establishment date for the ambiguous situations of institutions that can claim multiple founding dates. --Orlady (talk)\n\nI don't think that making the field non-mandatory solves the problem at all. Frankly, and please don't take offense, but such a move seems unnecessarily silly because all institutions claim an establishment year -- UK clearly says 1865 on it's seal -- and in cases requiring clarification, there's a footnotes section for the infobox. Seems to me as though all the tools needed for the job have already been made available to us in this case. --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nI agree with Orlady's point that \"established\" is an ambiguous/meaningless term if it means whatever each school individually wants it to mean. (I'm fairly surprised that there's no wikipedia consensus on what \"established\" does mean.) Including that date in the infobox imparts little knowledge to the reader other than: this is when the school claims it was established. However, since we also categorize each school by date of establishment, I also agree that making it non-mandatory in the infobox does not solve the problem at all. Oh well, moving on. -Kgwo1972 (talk)\n\nAt first glance, I see four problems with that argument:\n\n1) Institutions constantly self-define their names, their founding dates, their affiliations -- all of which are backed up by reliable sources.\n\n2) There's no need to be surprised because there is consensus -- that it's self-defined.\n\n3) If you don't want to include the established year because it's self-defined, then you might as well remove the motto, the name, the endowment, and everything other bit of information that is based on self-reported but verifiable data.\n\n4) That it's useless information sounds like a terribly subjective statement to make, and doesn't seem to pass the WP:IDONTLIKEIT test.\n\nWhat I usually do when a founding year is complicated is the following: make sure the history section is comprehensive and verifiable, add footnotes clarifying the founding year in the infobox, and add more than one establishment category for schools that have merged or recognize two significant dates. I never considered doing these things such a hassle that I felt the infobox needed to be altered, but that's just me. Does it really seem that unreasonable a course of action? --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nI agree with the the way you are doing it - indicate in the article just whateven the date refers to. The infobox is just a summary and does not need the details. DGG ( talk )\n\nOn the thread of this conversation, I'm wondering what I should do in the case of the University of Chicago; as far as I know, the school doesn't claim a specific founding date (nothing on a seal or anything) and the news office provides conflicting information (this source says 1891, while this source claims it's 1890, and I think that milestones are celebrated based on 1892). I've made a point of never claiming a founding or established date in the article, stating exactly what happened when, but I'm wondering whether I should leave the infobox blank or use the date 1890 (when it was incorporated, which seems like the most official thing). An old version of the article said that the University traditionally dated its founding to 1891 but I've never seen any source that verified that. — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nThis is some fun sleuthing. Well, using the official history on the web is always a good move but it's even better when it's actually confirmed by something like http://www-news.uchicago.edu/resources/brief-history.shtml. I suppose that news article was just wrong, because if you go up a section and then click on this link, it just corroborates the history page. 1890 it is, I suppose. If you can find equally reliable sources for 1891 and 1892 dates, don't be bashful about using footnotes. I've always been a fan of using <sup></sup> tags with a symbol. --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nI would believe printed material from the institution over the website. I have found that University websites are authored by low-level employees and work-study students in comparison with printed materials which tend to be reviewed by a larger number of people. Reliable independent secondary sources is what Wikipedia seeks. Racepacket (talk)\n\nThe University of Miami article shows what a mess can be made of college rankings. Several questions are raised:\n\nIf a ranking chart covers the entire nation, is it original research to say that the school has the highest ranking of all schools in Florida?\n\nIf the rankings do not divide into tiers, is it supportable to claim that the school is a top tier institution in the rankings?\n\nOne ranking of Philosophy Departments is the Baylor University blog \"Certain Doubts\" ranks University of Miami’s philosophy department fifth in the nation among top Ph.D. programs based on how much faculty members are cited in scholarly journals, even though another source has it ranked 32nd using wider criteria. Is this credible and does it meet WP:RS?\n\nThe magazine Hispanic Business ranks schools on how friendly they are to hispanic students. Do we include those rankings? Racepacket (talk)\n\nWouldn't this be better suited for the talk page? As for your questions, 1) yes it is original research, as is stated in WP:UNIGUIDE. 2)Top tier is just technically inaccurate and is WP:BOOSTERISM 3)Blogs generally aren't considered WP:RS, and 4)Doesn't reazlly seem notable; Wikipedia isn't the place to compile a list of everything anyone has ever published about an institution. However, it seems that you already knew the answers to these questions, so maybe in the future you should just be bold and make changes you see fit.— DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nThe article is ranked as stub. I worked hard to get it better. Can anyone reassess it. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Abrnkak (talk • contribs) 05:06, 8 September 2009 (UTC) sorry i forgot my signAbrnkak (talk)\n\nUniversity of Chicago has been nominated for a good article reassessment. Please leave your comments and help us to return the article to good article quality. If concerns are not addressed during the review period, the good article status will be removed from the article. Reviewers' concerns are here. Malleus Fatuorum\n\nWe are having a disagreement on what may be listed as alternative names for the University of Miami. The article now reads \"The University of Miami (commonly referred to as UM,[2] or Miami of Florida,[3]) is a private, non-sectarian university...\" Some editors propose to add \"The U\" as another common name. They cite as a reference the website insidetheu.com (which is an athletics website devoted to the University of Miami) as authority for this claim. In turn, I have argued that students everywhere use phrases like \"I am going to school now\" or \"I am heading toward campus.\" But that does not mean that every college in American would include \"school\" and \"campus\" in the list of its popular names. If a student were travelling to another city and was asked \"where do you attend?\" that would not be an answer. People at every university use the pronoun \"it\", but only when the antecedent is understood, but we would not list \"It\" as a commonly known name for the University. I offered the following counter examples of the use of \"The U\": www.theu.com, www.theu.net, restaurant, \"Making voluntary contributions to the U is central...\" and The U - University of Misssouri student radio station. Why include \"commonly referred to\" names and shouldn't the names be reasonably meaningful beyond the campus itself? Racepacket (talk)\n\nI don't understand why this is a pressing issue. There was a years old discussion on the talk page about the inclusion of alternate names for the University of Miami. And there are reliable sources that show that it is also called \"UM\", \"Miami of Florida\", and \"The U\", and the last one is used exclusively by ESPN to discuss the school. Racepacket for whatever reason opened up the discussion anew and is suggesting that there was no consensus on the talk page when it is such a trivial thing to be edit warring over with two other editors who have worked on the article for the past three years. The University of Miami is in no way the only university that is referred to as \"The U\" but \"The U\" is one of the more notable nicknames for the University of Miami.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nThank you for responding. There is no reliable evidence that \"The U\" has a secondary meaning that is widely accepted that makes the phrase synonymous with the University of Miami. User:Ryulong is applying a standard that would easily allow \"The U\" to be added as a \"common name\" for at least two dozen other universities. The ESPN website for the general public, espn.com, does not use \"The U\" to refer uniquely to the University of Miami. There is a set of school-specific ESPN-sponsored college fan websites, but even then, the web designers were careful to give other context for the use of \"The U\" For example, the drop down menu calls it \"Miami: Inside The U\" and the graphic references uses the color-coded split-U logo of the school. I don't see anything in the cited website that would suggest that ESPN or anyone else seriously believes that the phrase \"The U\" has a meaning equating it to the University of Miami outside a narrow context which ESPN is careful to repeatedly state by way of clarification. I don't know why it is desirable to offer a list of \"common names\" at the top of the article, but certainly \"The U\" has far less support than \"UM\" or \"Miami of Florida.\" Racepacket (talk)\n\nThere is plenty of reliable evidence that \"The U\" is one of the many nicknames/shorthand names for \"the University of Miami\". The fact that an ESPN affiliated website refers to the school and its athletic teams (particularly the Hurricanes football team) should be enough of a reliable source that Miami is one of the multitude of schools that go by the name \"The U\" colloquially. The same can be said for the University of Minnesota, University of Utah, etc. There is nothing in the article that states that Miami should be the only school that is referred to as \"The U\". It is simply one of many, and \"The U\", along with \"UM\" and \"Miami of Florida\" are perfectly and reliably sourced subsitute names for the school. Saying that other institutions also could use the shorthand name is not a sound enough argument in my book, or in ElKevbo's book as per his reply at Talk:University of Miami. It apppears that you solely brought it upon yourself to question a reliable source that has been in place for at least a year until your sweeping changes to the article as a whole took place. You are the only user who has had a problem with it in two years time. Since the thread was started by Do be good man (talk · contribs) in April 2007, sourcing problems have been solved for the names \"UM\", \"Miami of Florida\", and \"The U\" until Racepacket here revisited the sourcing issue for completely different sources used for the five character colloquial name. Since discovering it, he edit warred with myself and MiamiDolphins3 (talk · contribs), completely removing this source and editwarring over the inclusion of this source.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nAs I stated on the talk page, I do not see any justification for removing a well-cited nick name from the lead of the page. Ottava Rima (talk)\n\nRynlong is correct that the inapplicable sources were removed. Neither references shows an independent, widely-accepted meaning. For example, trademark attorneys frequently conduct scientific surveys to measure the secondary meaning of a phrase to the general public. If the University conducted such a survey and the results got reported in the media, there might be support for the claim. But neither of the two cited references is enough to support the claim. No edit warring here, just an effort to check that each reference is applicable to the statement made in the article, and more importantly that we need a Wikipedia-wide policy on these \"commonly referred to as...\" names. In response to User: Ottava Rima, there is a difference of opinion here as to whether the nick name is \"well-cited.\" The referenced website carefully sets a Miami context before using \"The U\" reference. Thanks! Racepacket (talk)\n\nTrying to create a new sweeping policy is not helpful when you remove two sources that refer to a school as \"The U\". Merely because the school is referred to by its whole name first and then \"The U\" is not a good enough argument to support the removal of any reference to support the statement. The two references on the article now (which were both removed by you Racepacket) clearly support the statement. Your removal of the references and the statement without any discussion beforehand, merely going off of a thread begun in April 2007 when there were no references for the statement in question, was unhelpful and more or less disruptive to the article.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nI see no reason whatsoever to create a new policy to deal with this. Our core policies are more than adequate. --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nIt has been clearly stated here that Racepacket is disrupting the article University of Miami to set a precedent and create a new policy in order to regulate the nicknames and shorthand names of all universities and colleges on this project by edit warring over the inclusion/exclusion of the name \"The U\" from the lead paragraph University of Miami by suggesting that the two independent reliable sources do not support the statement. The symbolism of the school utilizes the extremely iconic split U logo and the official symbolism of the university was changed to include the split-U. The use of the UM article to set a precedent is disruption to make a point.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nAs I have noted, there is a big difference between a logo that uses a specific typeface, color scheme and \"split\" and the generic prose term \"the U.\" The two references that User:Ryulong offers are not \"independent reliable sources\" -- one is a university-specific athletic fan website which uses the full color split-U logo, and the other was a news article in the trade press that carefully set out the full name of the University of Miami before allowing the shorthand \"the U\" to be used in the story. Trademark attorneys frequently conduct scientific surveys to see if a word or phrase has a secondary significance. If the University of Miami were to conduct such a survey and the results were reported in the press, then such a reference would support a claim that \"The U\" is widely used as a common name for the University of Miami. I didn't remove the offered reference to make a point, I made a number of changes when checking that the footnoted references matched the main text. We need some experienced editors from outside Southern Florida to weigh in and decide this issue. I can find hundreds of quotations where \"campus\", \"school\" or \"it\" are used to refer to the University of Miami, but in each case the context is set first. What is needed is evidence that the meaning of \"The U\" is so well understood beyond that locality that is has become the common name for the University of Miami. Thanks. Racepacket (talk)\n\nLooking at the sources, I would say that the ESPN site is sufficiently independent of the University of Miami itself (although I don't even know why it would have to be independent, since the University itself is a reliable source on information about itself as long as it isn't unduly self-serving). Perhaps this isn't the article you're referring to, but if it is, I don't see them use the phrase \"The U\" anywhere except when quoting someone else. Even if that weren't the case, using the official name before going to an abbreviation isn't evidence that it shouldn't be included; the fact that it's used at all provides verifiable evidence of its use (although the fact that a couple soldiers used the term doesn't seem to provide that). My judgment is that I'd like to see one more source refer to it as The U, although I think the ESPN site is fine and I bet that more sources will turn up. \"The U\" is not the same as \"the school\" or \"the university\"; no one would refer to the University of Maryland or the University of Chicago as \"The U\". — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nI believe there was another reference for the use of \"The U\" in a colloquial sense but it appears to have been supplanted by the US Dept. of Defense article. It still appears that Racepacket is trying to set a precedent to produce a new policy governing the use of shorthand/common/colloquial names for universities on Wikipedia, taking the article on UM as its test subject by forcing sourcing on one of its common names. The use of \"The U\" in reference to the school in both links should be sufficient enough, as they are third party and it is not like we are sourcing something that is contentious. The fact that the soldiers call it \"The U\" should be enough in my opinion. Just because it is known as \"The U\" in one locality does not mean that when someone uses \"The U\" in Minneapolis or \"The U\" in Salt Lake City, they are referring to Miami, which is what I think Racepacket is suggesting. The statement in the lead of University of Miami does not make that distinction.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nI don't think either source on their own would be enough; the ESPN site could arguably just be referring to the logo (like a hypothetical site about the Chicago Maroons being called \"In the C\" after their logo), and the soldiers' use isn't enough either (I could be quoted as calling University of Maryland \"U-Mizzle\" in an article despite that no one on the entire planet calls it that). But, together, they seem to indicate that it's a nickname, although if it really were frequently used it would be easier to come up with less borderline sources IMO. — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nI've never heard of a university referred to by a name based on its logo and it is original research to assume that websites refer to UM as \"The U\" because of the split-U. The University of Minnesota is another \"The U\" and their logo is a giant letter M.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nIt seems possible, considering that the logo they use clearly refers to the Miamo logo (and they don't seem to use the phrase \"The U\" anywhere else). And my thought that \"The U\" in the logo refers to the UM logo is as much original research as your claim that it refers to the school, since no source explicitly states either and both are just our assumptions (or, for that matter, that a handful of brief references constitutes a nickname). In any case, UM is also referred to as \"The U\" here and in this Miami Herald blog, although neither of them are great sources. It seems to me that \"the U\" is a very informal way of referring to the school (unlike, for example, \"Georgia Tech\" for the Georgia Institute of Technology), and I have no opinion either way as to whether it should be included in the lead or not. It doesn't seem to be an outright hoax, but the sources are grasping at straws a bit.— DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nI've added two more additional references and have two more if necessary. Four references to show that this particular institution is called \"The U\" is nitpicking. There is enough information to show that the school is called \"The U\" in Florida and by major news publications in and out of Florida. It is in no way \"The [Only] U\", which is what Racepacket was picking at, but I've got enough there. Needing such intensive sourcing on a nickname is disruptive, as have much of Racepacket's other edits to the article have been (such as adding {{fact}} tags to every other sentence in the Athletics section). If the four sources related to and independent from the school are not enough, then I'll add the two other ones I found. If it's fine, then I think this issue is resolved.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nSeveral problems: 1) the \"ESPN reference\" is not to espn.com, the general website, it is to a local, school-specific athletic fan site. So it does not show that it is widespread usage. 2) The Defense Link News does not say or imply that people unconnected with the University of Miami understand \"The U\" to mean that school. (It is not a \" US Dept. of Defense\" article.) 3) The fact that a local sportswriter choses to name his blog \"Eye on the U\" does not demonstrate that \"The U\" has a secondary meaning. Reading the contents of that blog shows that its author is careful to distinguish between Florida State University and University of Miami rather than using \"The U\" without setting the context. Again, this is local, not a regional or national source. 4) The fact that President Shalala named her CD \"The Spirit of the U\" does not indicated that she or anyone else uses \"The U\" as a substitute for the name of the University. (Again, this is a local, university webpage.) We want to be helpful to our readers, and flagging \"Cal\", \"UNLV\", \"UNC\", \"UTEP\" or \"SUNY\" in the lead paragraph of an article tells them that such nicknames are broadly accepted. We confuse our readers and reduce our credibility when we treat an ambiguous \"The U\" the same way. I am not saying that \"The U\" must mean only one school. I am saying that people in a large part of the country, who are not connected to that school should automatically associate the University of Miami with \"The U\" before it can be listed. Thanks. Racepacket (talk)\n\nAll of the references that have been put forward utilize \"The U\" to refer to the University of Miami or its sports teams. Again, you seem to be suggesting that the use of \"The U\" in the lead paragraph suggests that this is the only university to be referred to as \"The U\". I have repeatedly said that there is nothing that says that. I have provided enough to show that locally, UM is \"The U\". I went to The U. I call it The U. I am wearing a T-shirt that has the split-U on it. You are just nitpicking now. You are suggesting that the use of \"The U\" should be nowhere on Wikipedia, because it is generally a local colloquial name, because there are many schools that are referred to as \"The U\"s. The name \"The U\" is not used anywhere in the article other than the lead. Stop obsessing over these five characters and find something else on Wikipedia to write about for a while.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\n1) Please don't mischaracterize my position. Wikipedia does not document local colloquial names, it lists nicknames with secondary significance that people not connected to the locality or school would associate with the institution. Anyone who has read a sports page would recognize \"Cal\", \"UNLV\", \"UNC\", \"UTEP\" or \"SUNY.\" \"The U\" is not like those nicknames/abbreviations. As a University of Miami undergraduate, you would not have the objectivity to judge this. That is why independent secondary sources are needed. 2) Ad hominem arguments and put-downs will not satisfy the requirement that Wikipedia be well-sources, objective and verifiable. None of the sources support the claim that \"The U\" is a common name for the University of Miami. 3) Is it your argument that \"The U\" refers to athletics or the university as a whole? Your logo argument is based on the \"Split-U\" athletic logo. Please explain. Thanks. Racepacket (talk)\n\n\"The U\" is a common name within the locality of South Florida. Merely because there are other institutions that go by the name \"The U\" in other localities does not preclude the fact that this fact should not be mentioned on the article. I have shown that news agencies and the University itself refers to itself as \"The U\" as do those in association with it. This in no way means it should not be mentioned at all as you have been suggesting. Institutions that call themselves \"The U\" and that other entities call the institution \"The U\" should have that fact mentioned in the article. I've added four separate reliable sources that you have thrown out for no reason other than they are local to the institution. I have proven this beyond reasonable doubt and this should be resolved per the fact that there are four separate sources supporting this fact, and I could clearly find more if necessary.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nBut the statement in the article claims that it is \"commonly referred to as\" the U. I read that as being anywhere in the English-speaking world, not just on campus. I know that words like \"the U\", \"campus\" and \"it\" are used, but with context or an antecedent to give them meaning. You make an argument that it is a reference to the \"Split U\" athletic logo, so are you saying that it is used like \"Hurricanes\" and \"'Canes\" in an athletic context or for the whole university? Racepacket (talk)\n\nI am also never going to be able to find something that says outright \"The University of Miami is also called 'The U'\". Everything that is out there references the University of Miami as \"The U\" which is as best as anyone can get for a citation for the trivial statement.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nIf you can't support the statement with the footnote, then don't mislead the readers by adding the footnote. I have offered six different formulations on the University of Miami talk page:\n\na) delete all common names\n\nb) (sometimes abbreviated as UM,[2] or Miami of Florida,[3] or The U[4][5][6][7])\n\nc) (locally and colloquially referred to as UM,[2] or Miami of Florida,[3] or The U[4][5][6][7])\n\nd) (commonly referred to as Miami of Florida,[3] and occassionally abbreviated as s UM,[2] or The U[4][5][6][7])\n\ne) (commonly referred to as UM,[2] or Miami of Florida)[3]\n\nf) (commonly referred to as Miami of Florida,[3])\n\nor any of the above without the footnotes, because none of the footnotes really support the text. In my mind, \"commonly referred to as\" calls forth the type of anlysis used in trademark law that measures when a significant part of the general public associates \"The U\" with the \"University of Miami.\" People are asked \"What word comes to mind when I say Apple.\" A large number of people will say \"Computer\" or \"iPod\" rather than fruit, because it is a \"strong\" trademark with a secondary meaning. \"Otis\" will have most people saying \"elevator.\" But if you ask \"The U\" , noone outside of Miami will answer \"University of Miami.\" We need some test to see what (if anything) should be listed. The words \"campus\", \"school\", \"it\" and \"The U\" can all mean the University of Miami in certain contexts, but that is not the generally accepted secondary meaning. We are making a general statement here for the entire English-speaking part of the world, not for the undergraduate dorms on the campus. Thanks. Racepacket (talk)\n\nCampus and school are common nouns; \"The U\" is a proper noun, which makes your comparison like apples and oranges. (Not every \"University of\" school refers the themselves as \"The U\".) And your secondary-association test is inappropriate; if you were to ask a sample of people what \"Chicago\" meant, virtually everyone would say the city, not the University of Chicago, yet \"Chicago\" is indeed an appropriate alternate name for the University of Chicago, increasingly more so the further you go from Chicago. What the nickname's primary association is frankly is irrelevant; all we need to know is that it has a sufficient level of usage (intentionally vague). — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nAn interesting approach, DroEsperanto. I think \"The U\" is more like an acronym or abbreviation (SUNY, UNLV, etc.) However, a problem with a \"level of usage\" test is that it is not verifiable, and hence not permitted under WP:V. The footnotes offered are merely examples of someone using \"The U,\" not secondary sources discussing the extent to which people use \"The U.\" The problem with \"Chicago\" is exactly what we have with \"The U,\" if you ask people what University they associate with Chicago, they would say \"University of Chicago,\" \"University of Illinois at Chicago\" or \"Chicago State.\" I don't see any justification for the \"commonly referred to as\" claim in the article. Thanks. Racepacket (talk)\n\n\"The U\" is not an acronym like \"SUNY\" or an abbreviation like \"UNLV\". It is merely a nickname for an institution whose name begins with \"the University of...\". You are requesting that there be a source out there that critically analyzes the use of \"The U\" to refer to any particular university. This is not going to exist. I have provided many sources that show people using \"The U\" to refer to the university in question. I could find sources where people have used \"The U\" to refer to other universities.\n\nNow, I might be wrong, but you are completely missing DroEsperanto's point. He is saying that \"Chicago\" primarily refers to the city and not the institution, whereas the name \"Chicago\" is also used to refer to UChicago. The other institutions that you list go by other names, such as UIC and CSU. Clearly, in Illinois, if someone is asked what school they go to and they say \"Chicago\", it is known that they went to UChicago and not UIC or CSU or any other institutions with \"Chicago\" in its name.\n\nThis can be carried over to other localities. Saying you go to \"The U\" in Minnesota means you go to U of M and no other school in Minnesota. Saying you go to \"The U\" in Utah means you go to U of U and no other school in Utah. Saying you go to \"The U\" in Florida means you go to Miami, especially when no other institution in the state goes by the name \"The U\" despite being \"Universities of...\" (UT, UF, USF, UWF, UCF, UNF). It appears that locally the name has merit, and in the one case of the national media that I provided, even though it was two people being quoted, there was no mystery as to what they were talking about.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nFinally, you have expressed my concern about claiming that University of Miami is \"commonly referred to as The U.\" The Defense News article quoted someone as saying \"The U\" but they also set the antecedent. I don't think that anyone would say \"The U\" if they knew the audience does not understand the context. \"U of M\" can mean Miami, Maryland, Mississippi or Minnessota, etc. \"Miami\" can mean the school in Ohio or Florida. These ambiguities make them worthless in a Wikipedia article and make documenting them very hard. Slang and nicknames have geographical and demographic scope. \"Honeybun\" can mean your wife only if she understands that it is her nickname. It can also be used to refer to Joe's wife. Apparently, Wikipedia is not for documenting slang or nicknames. It is not \"Usage guides or slang and idiom guides\" If you can't document it, and I can't verify it, why put \"The U\" in the article at all? The article has more credibility without it. Racepacket (talk)\n\nThere is ambiguity but that should not rule out the usage of the commonly used terms within the context of the article. By your terms, then we should rule out any and all abbreviations which have similarity between any two institutions, thereby removing \"UM\" from any school named \"University of M...\". I can tell you that no one calls UMiami \"U of M\" and that I have only come across with UMinnesota. There was no issue with the usage until you began to edit war over the exclusion of \"The U\" from University of Miami. Listing alternate names or abbreviations is never an issue anywhere else on Wikipedia, and the listings of alternate or shorthand names of universities are most definitely not \"slang or idiom\" guides. And with your \"honeybun\" analogy you are once again comparing apples and oranges.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/The U and Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The U (University of Miami) might be informative, here. Uncle G (talk)\n\nI have posted yet another approach using the University of Virginia as a model. They claim that \"The University\" means the University of Virginia, but the footnote has sufficient caveats that the reader will understand that the usage is not widespread. Racepacket (talk)\n\nThis issue has been beat to death. It's clearly become an edit war for purposes other than providing information regarding the subject. A grievance needs to be submitted and move on. If Wikipedia chooses to sanitize articles of common names by which the subject is described or known, then the specific Wikipedia policy needs to be cited or appropriate steps taken to establish the policy without prosecuting an edit war. I happen to believe such sanitization would be a disservice to users. I also believe there's a case to be made for inclusion of \"Suntan U\" and \"The Cardboard College\", but history is old news. Otherwise, this serves as a great example to discourage editors. Do go be man (talk)\n\nI agree with Do go be man that the horse is now just a bleached skeleton that we are smacking around at the moment. I am tired of trying to refute Racepacket's points. There is a clear consensus here, on the talk page of UM, and at the thread on WP:ANI that I started to open up a grievance against Racepacket's activities on the multiple UM articles that he is in the wrong or clearly does not have the consensus for his changes.\n\nAlso the \"Cardboard College\" part is included within the prose of the article. I might add something about \"Suntan U\" if I can find something about it that would be on the same level as the seven references for the nickname.—Ryūlóng (竜龙)\n\nI have proposed using the University of Wyoming as a model, \"The University of Wyoming is a land-grant university located in Laramie, Wyoming, situated on Wyoming's high Laramie Plains, at an elevation of 7,200 feet (2194 m), between the Laramie and Snowy Range mountains. It is known as UW (often pronounced \"U-Dub\") to people close to the university.\" Thanks Racepacket (talk)\n\nIn light of the discussion above as well as a new debate at Talk:Johns Hopkins University, I think we need to clear the air about how we're going to go about deciding what rankings merit inclusion or not. The JHU debate centers on including or excluding the Forbes rankings on the basis of its supposed methodological unsoundness and thus reliability or notability for inclusion. The issue of assessing the notability of university rankings has never been fully discussed in my view and I'm not comfortable with the editors of each article adjudicating which rankings to include or not include given the obvious potential for these discussions to give undue weight to only positive rankings. I'd like to begin what I'm sure is a spirited discussion about amending WP:UNIGUIDE to more explicitly establish what rankings should or should not be included in an article or infobox template. This primarily concerns US universities, but there is also a proliferation of international rankings as well.\n\nDo we exclude rankings based upon lack of notability? How do we establish this notability?\n\nDo we judge methodological soundness as a measure of reliability for the source and for inclusion?\n\nDo we exclude popular but unreliable rankings but include potentially non-notable but more reliable rankings?\n\nFeel free to add more questions below or discuss the preliminary ones I've proposed. Please also notify other editors of this discussion here. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nI don't mean this as a defense of ranking systems, which all have severe intrinsic flaws. But the Forbes system would almost certainly receive a failing grade in any decent first-year graduate research design course:\n\nUsing post-graduate debt loads and graduation rates as stand-alone measures of quality essentially guarantees that schools attended by the less well-to-do will be relegated to the bottom of the rankings. Obviously, if a researcher chooses to consider such issues, the least he or she could do is to measure these variables in some sort of socio-economic context, that is basic social science. The Forbes system does not do so.\n\nAnd speaking of basic social science, the use of a self-selected sample such as RateMyProfessors.com is simply preposterous. It merely displays what a small, unrepresentative sample have reported to some snarky website. (And no, the fact that all schools face the same problem doesn't level the playing field; awareness and use of RMP may vary significantly between campuses, and organized efforts may be mounted by various student groups.) Furthermore, the use of internal faculty evaluation by many universities voids the legitimacy of using RMP even further.\n\nAs for using Who's Who in America, even a cursory level of research should have revealed Tucker Carlson's brilliant takedown of the entire Who's Who enterprise. Carlson's article, after all, appeared in FORBES MAGAZINE! (http://www.forbes.com/fyi/1999/0308/063.html).\n\nUsing salary surveys on payscale.com based on self-reported data by a self-selected group of alums. Not only is it not a scientific sample with no effort being made to verify possibly inflated salary claims, the data also takes into account only alums with terminal bachelor's degrees, so schools where a high percentage of graduates go on to graduate and professional programs will effectively be penalized by having many of its highest-earning alums pushed out of the data.\n\nGlaringly absent, in all the Forbes focus on outcomes and satisfaction, is any consideration of selectivity. If you ignore selectivity (scores, class rank, admit rates), you are ignoring how the most capable students, the ones with the greatest range of choices, have voted with their feet and with their parents' wallets. The \"votes\" of every student - not just a self-selected few who report to payscale.com or ratemyprofessor.com - are aggregated in the selection metrics. So I think these (or other data reported in the Common Data Sets, such as freshman retention) are more reliable indicators of quality (as used by the ranking systems of USNEWS and ARWU) than the metrics Forbes uses.\n\nFinally, as I have articulated above, Forbes mixes cost-related and quality-related factors in a very unprincipled way. This is an unorthodox way to rate things, whether we are talking about cars and washing machines or universities. Better to separate cost from quality in order to expose how much extra value one gets for extra cost. This ranking hides that. The criteria mixes outcomes with satisfaction and performance factors, but the outcomes (Who's Who listings or top salaries) are not necessarily the ones most sought by individual students or schools (even assuming they are entirely attributable to college quality, which they aren't).TennisGrandSlam (talk)\n\nEdit conflict, argh! Well, I noticed this and couldn't resist, although I'm not sure how much I can contribute to a meaningful discussion. Here's my dilemma: while I often tolerate rankings in Wikipedia articles with reliable sources, I really hate rankings. I hate rankings for the same reasons most people who hate rankings do: I feel like it's just a way for magazine to make money and support the status quo, for popular schools to stay popular and rich schools to stay rich. I guess there's something very Darwinian in that, but I don't think it's really good or natural selection, either. I think it's odd that schools like Daniel Webster College can be top-tier one year and on the verge of bankruptcy and loss of accreditation the next. And even if every single third- and fourth-tier school went bankrupt and defunct this weekend, you'd still have third- and fourth-tier schools next year -- they'd just be schools that used to be top-tier. I'm not sure there's any real benefit to the ranking, but maybe I'm just not competitive enough. I actually like the NAICU U-CAN method of presenting information on face value, and I'd love to see Wikipedia eschew rankings in university articles in favour of that method (a great way to avoid some WP:BOOSTER issues, I suppose). But I realise that'd also be quite unpopular, and I don't feel as though my argument is either new or terribly cogent. I suppose that I just wanted to contribute, since it feels like I haven't been around much lately! --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nWell said, I completely agree! I would readily vote in favor of a policy to eschew rankings entirely in Wikipedia university articles.TennisGrandSlam (talk)\n\nAs far as the Forbes rankings goes, if it can be verified by other people (not just our own deduction) that Forbes is unequivically not reliable for what it claims to be reporting (significantly moreso than USNWR and other rankings), then we shouldn't use it. That being said, this raises the question: if we use rankings in articles to sum up the quality of institutions, are rankings published by newsmagazines really the most reliable source? I would argue probably not, although many people would argue differently. I feel like if we list them, though, we're inherently endorsing the rankings as reliable indicators of quality. That being said, I have a hard time thinking to ban rankings from all articles, because I think they do have some value in conveying the nature of an institution (prestige, mostly), although whether the good that does outweighs the bad of shrouding the basic description of an institution in rankings madness is questionable. — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nNot that I'm arguing for getting rid of rankings (I admit that I'd like that, but I'm mostly arguing for the sake of argument here), but I disagree with the whole \"I think they do have some value in conveying the nature of an institution (prestige, mostly)\" because of the whole WP:PRESTIGE issue. Selectivity, for example, can, to some extent, be determined via Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which doesn't rank. On the other hand, USNews lists Southern Nazarene University as \"selective\" in the new 2010 rankings -- but it's an open admissions college. I realise it's my own OR, but that doesn't sound at all reliable to me. And, if prestige is important, I'm sure we can find plenty of books and articles that aren't concerned with ranking to back up \"real\" prestige. So, thoughts? --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nIs this conversation dead or do we really think that banning rankings use is a great idea? I can start planning a party if it's the latter. --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nIt's a foregone conclusion that a blanket ban on rankings would not be accepted by the community. --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nAre we honestly going to put Forbes rankings out here? Hopkins dropped like 70 places to like 140-150 this year. How much credibility can you put on a ranking that allows a school to fluctuate +/- 75 position slots per year. Forbes even wrote an article back in 1999 on how flawed the \"Who's who in America' list is... Now they are using it as a part of their core methology for the Forbes ranking. I think a graduate student could have developed a better ranking system than Forbes. lol --Phead128 (talk)\n\nHere's the issue as I see it: no matter how questionable rankings are, they a) seem to be popular -- although I'm more a fan of trying to find out than assuming the foregone conclusion -- and b) seem to factor into verifiability. That is, to say that they're unreliable based on what we have so far mainly seems to constitute WP:OR. That said, if there's some way to determine that USNews, Forbes, &c. do not constitute WP:RS then we'd have a shot at taking them out. That's the only way, if you ask me, and until we can prove that then I don't see how there's any way to exclude any of them. --inquietudeofcharacter (talk)\n\nI think that any ranking being published by a major and otherwise well-established organization has the presumption of reliability and is also necessarily notable even if their methodology is as unreliable as counting how many times the letter \"Q\" appears in the student roster. It's not our place to nitpick methodologies because every ranking methodology is necessarily imperfect. If you want rankings in the article, you don't get to cherry pick among the notable ones. The matter at hand remains how to establish notability, not reliability. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nI think Forbes tends to be the exception when it comes to both notability and reliability. LOL. United States Air Force Academy > Yale, Stanford, and MIT?72.81.233.92 (talk)\n\nForbes improved their methodology in 2009. To me, the main reason for rejecting a college's particular rating is if that school has an internal course evaluation system that would displace widespread use by that campus of RateMyProfessor.com data, which is used for 25% of the Forbes ranking. Many schools have course evaluation programs that predate RateMyProfessor.com, so students don't participate in that website. As a result, the student satisfaction on those campuses would be understated in the Forbes rankings. Absent some reliable source which argues that \"Forbes does not accurate rank University X\", we should include the Forbes rankings in the rankings discussion of University X. Racepacket (talk)\n\nThere is currently a rewrite of Union College being completed at User:Eliphaletnott/Union College. An informal peer review (or at least a read-through and some copyediting) would be great. This is this user's first article, and he's done a fantastic job. If you have some free time, a little effort put into reading this over would be great. We want to go live soon. upstateNYer\n\nThe phrase \"began the first popular demand for higher education in America.\" before ftn 1 is hard to believe, although I have not read the source. Harvard was founded in 1636, are you implying that Harvard did not satisfy \"popular demand\" for higher education in America? Racepacket (talk)\n\nBreak up the first paragrah after ftn 2 and start a new paragraph on fraternities. Move that fraternities paragraph to History section.\n\nThe second sentence of the Academic Programs section uses the phrase \"general education program.\" To avoid confusing the reader, start the Academics section with an explanation of all of the college programs. (If the general education program is what a student gets before he declares a major, say so.)\n\nIn the Undergraduate Research section, the phrase \"what has been termed \"the linchpin\" of the Union education.\" is awkward. Do you mean what Union College considers to be \"the linchpin\" of its education experience? 66.173.140.100 (talk)\n\nI'm not sure that \"By 1974, women's sports finally emerged as a regular part of the intercollegiate athletic program.\" is worthy of inclusion in the article lead, though perhaps very significant expansion of the Athletics section could change this. Shanata (talk)\n\nI’m asking for assistance with shaping my employer’s University page, American_Intercontinental_University ,to be more consistent with how other universities are represented. A number of users are focusing efforts on expanding the Controversies section. As a relatively new member of Wikipedia, I would appreciate any help in understanding what is and isn’t a neutral POV. Allegations, though factual, can be leveraged to shape perception if they are used in quantity. Any suggestions for how to approach this fairly? S.Malekpour (talk)\n\nI'm an Ithaca College student. I'd love to really improve our page, as right now it isn't at all comprehensive and really doesn't reflect the scope of the college, but obviously I can't do it myself due to conflict of interest issues. The college has Start status with WikiProject Universities- it really needs work, and it would be great to get it more accurate before the admissions push for next year happens. I'm not sure this is the right place to post this, but I figured its worth a shot. Please let me know what I can do to get this page looked at and edited while avoiding conflict-of-interest stuff. Thanks so much! ICLucyG (talk)\n\nI'd say that the declaration that you've made here represents a good start in reducing the possible problems with Conflict of Interest, but given that you are trying to improve it before admissions push indicates that you do have some. I'd try reading through the WP:COI for guidelines. I would say that the following would make sense to try to work with COI issues: 1) Put an Ithaca College Userbox on your userpage like User:AmethystAngel. 2) Put a mention on the Talk:Ithaca College that you are making changes and that you are a Ithaca student. 3) Try to use similar colleges (like other members of the Empire 8 sports conference) as a guide to what should be added. 4) Drop us a line back here to have other users look it over.Naraht (talk)\n\nGood advice. I would differ slightly, however, in that it would be better to look at Featured college and university articles and use those as models. It would also be good to spend some time reviewing our article guidelines as they should be helpful. --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nWhat they said. Furthermore, I think that a lot of people editing college articles have some degree of affiliation with them (including myself), and that doesn't necessarily present a conflict of interest as long as you make sure your primary goal is to write a good, descriptive, and informative encyclopedia article. I would also suggest reading through WP:BOOSTER for a bunch of things to avoid. Good luck with the article! — DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nIt would be safe to assume that almost every editor of a college and university article has a superficial COI owing to their status as a current, former student, or some other kind of affiliate. The COI issue becomes more pernicious if you are an employee being paid to edit Wikipedia pages in your professional duties or your motivation is to make the article an adjunct web presence (the Wikipedia article should reflect what the university says about itself) rather than a neutral encyclopedia article (all Wikipedia articles about colleges should be written similarly, seeWP:UNIGUIDE). As other editors have stated, it is absolutely crucial to not let your pride in your alma mater influence how you write about it (see WP:BOOSTER).\n\nImitation is truly the highest form of flattery. The featured articles should be your first jumping off point. In many sections, you could possibly copy their structure wholesale and simply replace the relevant content and statistics or combine the best of two different FAs that are particularly suited to the college. Finally, always read the article as though it was for the some rival institution. If there are dubious or disingenuous claims, take them out. If most of the content is talking about how great the school is; talk about what the school actually has and does. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nI'd just like to say that all of the comments/suggestions after mine are improvements on what I said and I have learned quite a bit myself.Naraht (talk)\n\nThanks so much everyone, I'll definitely take a look at all of those sites. I am actually hesitant to edit the entry myself, because I don't know much about the guidelines for COI and I don't want to step on any toes or rules before I'm confident that what I'm doing is following the rules. If I was looking for someone else (say, from the wikiuniversity project) to edit so that I could avoid COI entirely, how would I go about doing that? Can I ask someone to take a look at the article, or is asking in itself a COI issue? Thanks again! ICLucyG (talk)\n\nYou don't need to know all the rules to edit: just BE BOLD, and if you make any mistakes, someone else will [[meta:Eventualism|eventually] fix them. I know that at first, all the different policies and guidelines can make your head spin. Just start editing, and you'll figure them out eventually. And as stated above, your status as an Ithaca student shouldn't prevent you from editing the article yourself: just go for it! Feel free to ask me on my talk page if you have any specific questions.— DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nThe entire article seems to be a copyvio from the university site and most of it needs to be completely rewritten. The lists of faculties and college, being strictly factual and impossible to present otherwise can probably stay. It's also unreferenced but there probably are references available.\n\nI am not sure whether the constituent colleges are notable in the sense that the Oxbridge college are-- they seem to have been founded on the traditional UK model, and I think they might well be. DGG ( talk )\n\nI've long had (unvoiced, I think) concerns about the \"Affiliations\" parameter in the University infobox. It seems vague and not very useful given the long list of affiliations most institutions cultivate. Today I was reminded of these reservations when I reverted some vandalism to Hofstra University. Thoughts? --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nIt's come up before at Template talk:Infobox university/Archive 3#Extraordinarily bloated. It works when it lists the major organisations universities are members of, e.g. the Russell Group or the 1994 Group, or to list federal universities such as London or Wales. These are fairly major organisations and a core part of the institution's identity. It shouldn't be used for every single obscure organisation the university if a member of. Timrollpickering (talk)\n\nI have likewise used it to list affiliations with major inter-university organizations such as Association of American Universities, The Consortium on Financing Higher Education, etc. or if it's a member of a larger organizing body such as a state university/trustee system. I agree that it should not be used to exhaustively list every affiliation, only the major ones that would possibly merit mention in the lead. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nAgree with above. That Hofstra collection is far, far too long. Esrever (klaT)\n\nI agree that it shouldn't list every accreditation agency/body as Hofstra appears to do. Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nThere has been a recent round of edits removing logos in infoboxes under justification of WP:MOSLOGO. The recent wave or logo removals seems to target logos that might primarily be identified as informal or athletic logos. These logos are often used also by various universities themselves as identifying marks of the institutions as a whole (see this photo), or similarly, by third party publications. Therefore it would seem to me that their inclusion would be appropriate, especially since, depending on the institution, these are often the most publicly recognized marks of a university. It is my understanding of fair-use that if the logos are to be used for encyclopedic or identification purposes, they can be included. Previously, in what seemed the existing consensus, based on their long standing inclusion in many university article infoboxes, including several that have reached FA status, that such justification for the inclusion of such logos would seem appropriate based on their utility in helping to identify the institution. Can we come up with a consensus for inclusion or removal of the popular or athletic logos of institutions within the infoboxes of the university articles? CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, an administrator's noticeboard is not the place to reach WP:consensus or engage in dispute resolution per WP:DISPUTE. Comments regarding this issue would best be served by discussion here or at other relevant wikiprojects. CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is is against WP:MOSLOGO, WP:FUG, or WP:LOGO to have individual appearances of multiple, different, current-use logos for the purposes of identifying an institution in an infobox?\n\n2. Are \"popular\" or \"athletic\" logos useful for identifying the institution that is the topic of an article?\n\n3. Can it be assumed that \"popular\" or \"athletic\" logos are not used to represent the university at large, and are specifically restricted in their use for specific sub-components of the institutions in question (e.g. athletic teams)? CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nI've pretty consistently supported a policy that would allow for the use of only one logo in a university article, under the assumption that the non-free content criteria promotes limited use (don't use two when one will do). Whether one uses a logo or a seal or a wordmark or whatever, they all serve exactly one purpose: identifying the university using an image designed by the institution. I think including an athletics logo is acceptable when used in identifying the teams in the infobox. Is all that clear? Esrever (klaT)\n\nFair enough, but I think there is some misunderstanding here. WP:MOSLOGO seems to lump trademarked images and copyrighted images together when that simply isn't the case all the time. The example cited is inaccurate too (the IBM logo is a PD image ineligible for copyright). It then redirects the reader to read the non-free content criteria completely ignoring the trademarks that are not copyrightable and other PD images (such as flags).\n\nLet's throw on top of that that this is a guideline, not policy. WP:IAR applies in spades here.\n\nI'm not saying to go hog-wild and just do whatever you want, but a consistent rationale across the board to violate a guideline (which is poorly written, IMNSHO) would give you something to point at and say \"we have two guidelines in conflict with one another\" vs \"my opinion (no matter how many people support it) conflicts with a guideline\". In short, let's codify a standard in the Wikipedia:WikiProject Universities guidelines and then work on fixing WP:MOSLOGO. — BQZip01 — talk\n\nI support the view that there is really no policy at all. In my opinion, the use of two logos is obvious, three perhaps excessive; the seal and current primary public identity logos should certainly grace the infobox, as the most \"official\" and most visible (respectively) symbols of the institution, while the athletics logos may be better off if relegated to the corresponding athletics section, though they are in fact an important means of identifying universities (at least in America, where their athletic teams are an important parallel endeavor to their academics). Best of all, it looks great and rules aren't really being broken by having them, and since most of these logos are, I agree, not copyrightable since they consist purely of text, I believe the current consistent rationale to be valid and worth holding onto.AniRaptor2001 (talk)\n\nI feel I should add here that there is also an ongoing wave of edits removing the use of athletic logos from the athletic sections of the university articles as well, and it is being justified, I believe incorrectly, using Wikipedia:NFC#Images_2 point 5. This may be a tangent discussion though.CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nActually, most of the universities have at least one copyrightable logo and use those dominantly, but most (if not all) have a trademarked yet uncopyrightable (and therefore PD) image that can be used instead. The disconnect here lies with what to do about trademarked, yet uncopyrightable, PD images. — BQZip01 — talk\n\nBQZip01, some of those logos look eminently copyrightable to me. The originality bar is very low, and File:Osu ath brand.png, among others, almost certainly meets it. I'm rather less keen on these additional logos appearing in infoboxes if they're copyrighted. — mholland (talk)\n\nRe:OSU mark the only thing on this that could even be considered \"not letters\" is the ornamentation on the \"S\". Ornamentation on letters is specifically mentioned as something that is not copyrightable. — BQZip01 — talk\n\nAniRaptor, it also must be remembered, that most seals are specifically reserved by University's for use by the University President alone or solely with his/her permission. I don't think that a seal would be more recognizable than an athletic mark or a \"popular\" mark, and therefore, to increase immediate understanding of the content of the article, these more popular marks should be allowed. DUKyleXY (talk)\n\nA majority of the time that is true I believe. Specifically for the case of the University of Pittsburgh, the seal is also used as a logo, albeit a somewhat simplified version. This photo shows the use of both the \"seal and wordmark\" logo and \"athletic/popular\" logo together on student shuttle buses on campus. While Pitt's seal is quite recognizable on a regional basis, I would believe the athletic/popular logo is more recognizable on a national basis. Both seem to have value for identifying the institution, and both are completely different in design and service. One speaks to the formal name of the university with a simplified seal including the founding date and moto, while the other stylizes the \"popular\" name (e.g. \"Pitt\"). Such could also be the case with logos of the University of California, Berkley which would be exemplified with the \"formal\" and \"popular/athletic\" logos. In fact, there seems to be individuals out there who do not know \"Cal\" and \"Berkley\" are the same institution, as I have run across such individuals, and therefore, I believe including both logos in the infobox is informative and useful. CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nThis discussion on this topic has also been opened on Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Should trademarked sports logos be used as icons in university infoboxes.3F. CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nThere is a need to keep updated on staff changes - for example, within the next six months as from tonight (October 2 2009), it seems likely that Ann Tait could be succeeded in her position as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Northampton. ACEOREVIVED (talk)\n\nA few neutral editors at Barnard College would be much appreciated. Some of us have differences of opinion and it's starting to get a bit heated. Thanks! --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nThe article has been fully protected. Additional eyes and input are welcome. --ElKevbo (talk)\n\n2 cents added. ElKevbissimo is always right. :) Madcoverboy (talk)\n\nYet another article that could use additional eyes and input: University of Miami‎. I have very strong opinions about what is occurring at this article (as is evident from my own participation) but I invite others to make their own judgments and help us work through our differences. Thanks! --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nThe current discussion on Talk:University of Miami centers around how to treat college fund raising campaigns in the history section of the article. Fundraising generally receives little discussion in the history sections, because constant fundraising is an assumed fact of institutional life. I am not sure how Wikipedia should measuring fundraising. I believe that if a capital campaign results in a dramatic increase in endowment, it could be noted and then expressed in terms of the effect on the national ranking of the size of the endowment on the NACUBO charts. The UM campaign had raised $552 million before the October 2003 launch date, with about half of that before 2003. The initial $1 billion goal was picked so that they were half way there at the launch. As is typically the case, the goal was exceeded and $1.4 billion was raised. But the \"duration\" of the \"campaign\" is arbitrary and the start date is arbitrary. Some editors have tried to claim that this was the best campaign by a \"young\" university, or to compare it with other schools within Florida. I think that such comparisons are inherently misleading. I also think that it is unfair to compare schools that have an internal teaching hospital with schools that are affiliated with a separate hospital. During this time, UM acquired a teaching hospital, and $851 million went to the Medical campus. I further question how one can compare a school that conducted an eight-year long campaign with another that may have conducted two, four-year campaigns. So, to me campaign size lack objectivity, and a better measure (if one is to compare institutions) is total endowment size, total physical plant investment or dollars raised per year.\n\nI would avoid comparisons with other institutions generally because this tends to convert the institutional history into boosterism, similar to the problem we are having with college rankings. I would welcome the thoughts of others, and hope that we could add something to the guidelines. Racepacket (talk)\n\nI would welcome other views, as I think this is contrived boosterism. Following a unversity press release, the local paper does a story about a fundraising drive and claims that it is the most money raised to date by any college in the state in a single campaign. In fact, other schools in that state have raised more money in multiple campaigns, and other schools in that state raise more money per year than this school. What is our duty to the readers? Should we repeat the claim, leave it out, or include all of the caveats? Do campaigns (of which there seem to be a never-ending stream) belong in the institutional history section? Thanks, Racepacket (talk)\n\nThe UM article has just received (and failed) its Good Article review. I would welcome the assistance of other WP:UNI members to address the concerns listed. Thanks. Racepacket (talk)\n\nWould people agree that there are too many articles on that university, and they should be merged? Itsmejudith (talk)\n\nMost of the Adamson articles are little more than lists of majors or even lists of current students. I agree they should be merged with substantial cleanup. Mabeenot (talk)\n\nThe template suggests that the author is planning to write a separate article for each building on campus, which would be overkill. Other universities have separate articles covering each college, but these college-level articles are a bit weak. One approach is to merge them and then if the article evolves beyond the list stage, split off the colleges from their separate sections. As of now, the list of degrees and programs are duplicated in the main article and in each college article, and the individual college articles have very little to offer other than the lists. I can see listing the names of the current president and college deans. Anything beyond that is over-kill and very difficult to keep up to date. Racepacket (talk)\n\nI have started merging the college articles back in to the main university article, and also trimmed the main article a bit. I also took a lot of material out of the Falcons article, but am not sure whether it should be kept on the basis of improving coverage of sport in the Philippines. Itsmejudith (talk)\n\nA lot of US colleges have a separate article covering their athletic teams. There are also articles covering athletic leagues and conferences. The trouble with articles devoted to just one team is that they become prone to WP:BOOSTERISM. I would focus on enhancing and deduplicating the academic part of the article first, and the leave that athletics question to later. Racepacket (talk)\n\nA whole lot of work has been done on Union College. The rewrite mentioned above has gone live. I was hoping some members of this project would be so kind as to read through the article and leave any comments on the talk. The main contributor would like to bring it to GAN soon.

I have over the last several days removed such icons from the infoboxes of 60 NCAA Division I schools, or about 17% of all NCAA Division I schools. I have removed 30 icons from Division II, or 10% of Division II. I have removed 39 icons from Division III schools, or about 9% of the 448 Division III schools. I have removed 14 icons from NAIA schools, or about 5% of the 290 NAIA schools. A summary of this is located at Wikipedia:Icons in infoboxes. --Hammersoft (talk)\n\nCan we please have a few more eyeballs on the article of this unaccredited, defunct institution? It appears that one or more alumni or other associated persons are intent on whitewashing the article. Thanks! --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nAt University of California, Santa Cruz, I've run across a situation where four editors have come to an agreement that an unofficial university logo should be used in the infobox. The logo currently in use File:Ucsc fiatslug.png is owned by the University of California Regents. It was licensed for use by an outside commercial entity. However, the logo itself is not used by the university. It is apparently prevalent on campus. There is what appears to be an official identity mark (it at least is not labeled as unofficial, while others from this source are labeled as unofficial). That identity mark is File:UCSC logo.png, and sourcing for it is at UCSC's Public Relations Office.\n\nHowever, when I placed this (not declared as unofficial) logo at the head of the infobox [6], I was reverted [7] and told that consensus exists to use the slug logo [8].\n\nI am, therefore, seeking wider consensus.\n\nMy stance in abstract is that in any organization's infobox, we should only be using official identity marks. In this case in particular, I think we should be using the identity mark rather than the logo, and the logo should be displayed further down in the article with some discussion as to how this logo came about, how it's used, etc. Since it appears to be popular, secondary sources could be found to support such text.\n\nInput please? Thanks, --Hammersoft (talk)\n\nI agree that the slug logo doesn't belong at the top of the article. Of the logos provided at UCSC's Public Relations Office, I can see the USC unofficial seal as being the top graphic and the logotype graphic on the bottom of the infobox. The slug logo is more of a fanboi image and not appropriate to represent the university. Stick it in the student activities section if it really needs to be included. -Mabeenot (talk)\n\nSpecifically regarding the Fiat Slug logo, both the characterization of the logo as a \"fanboi\" image and the assertion that it is not used by the university are incorrect. While it is not, in fact, the seal of the university, official use of the Fiat Slug logo (e.g., [9][10][11][12][13][14](at foot of page)[15]) and close variations of it (e.g., [16][17][18]) is pervasive at UCSC. The logo is listed here under \"UCSC Identity Guidelines\" and available for download by university web designers in three different formats.\n\nThe dilemma we faced when picking an image for the infobox header was that, on the one hand, the \"official unofficial seal\" of UCSC (which goes onto official correspondence, diplomas, and such) is both rather bland to behold and, aside from the printed-out name of the campus beside it, generic to the entire UC system. Its value as an immediately-recognizable identity mark is negligible. On the other hand, the Fiat Slug logo, while somewhat less official, is widely recognized in the world at large (in no small part due to John Travolta and Quentin Tarantino[19]) and is accepted by the denizens of the UCSC community as a unique, long-standing, and beloved symbol of their campus. The solution we came up with was to use the more-recognizable Fiat Slug image at the head of the infobox where it would immediately greet the reader, and then include the \"official unofficial seal\" with the \"UC Santa Cruz\" legend at the foot of the infobox using the logo = parameter— which was serendipitously the perfect spot, from an aesthetic point of view, for an image of its dimensions.\n\nThis was perfectly acceptable given the guideline for using the image_name = parameter as it existed at the time we put the infobox together. It also jibed with the then-current consensus that certain parameters of the infobox should be flexible enough to accommodate less-conventional arrangements when they were warranted. The guideline for the image_name = parameter has since been changed to strictly require the institution's \"official or ceremonial seal, shield or coat of arms that is used for high profile ceremonial events such as convocation, for degree certificates, and official transcripts;\" but since the change seems to have been done unilaterally by a now-blocked sock puppet acting without any sort of consensus (this was not noticed until now), I believe the pre-existing guidelines on infobox images should still be considered valid until a real consensus emerges otherwise. This is being addressed at Template talk:Infobox university#Policy on images in the infobox (a sockpuppet story). --Dynaflow babble\n\nI find Dynaflow's arguments convincing, particularly in light of the suspicious changes made to the infobox instructions (which I just changed back). I agree that we should use the official logo in most cases but we should have some flexibility and Dynaflow has argued successfully for an exception, IMHO. --ElKevbo (talk)\n\nAgree with Dynaflow. Flexibility and latitude must be preserved. Institutional use of identifying seals, crests, marks and logos (some institutions possessing multiple variations of all four types) may differ from institution to institution in both national and regional applications. The consensus for the display of the appropriate images for an article is well served when serious consideration is given to the input from those familiar with the culture and operations of the particular college or university, thus upholding the notion of expert knowledge. CrazyPaco (talk)\n\nSo long as the \"Fiat Slug\" image is also a trademark of the university, it is the closest thing UCSC has to a distinguishing university seal. The \"unofficial seal\" in the UCSC style guidelines is the generic seal of the UC system. Arguments for or against either can only take place on aesthetic grounds, and while I don't have a personal interest in this, I find the Fiat Slug image charming. Ameriquedialectics\n\nOk, given Dynaflow's links to various different offices at UCSC using that logo, it seems official enough. --Hammersoft (talk)\n\nAs a part of my work on improving and wikifying community college articles, I am working on Rock Valley College. As can be viewed by the history, I have made several changes to the article by adding appropriate references and and NPOV content.

It is offering a class but is in no way accredited. What it does have going for it is notability.

Any thoughts?— DroEsperanto (talk)\n\nThe Global University Ranking website has a copyright notice on the bottom of each page, including the pages that give the rankings.

Racepacket (talk)\n\nI deeply appreciate the effort and value of reproducing the top rankings here, but I think that it is a copyright violation to do so. However, reporting in the individual college articles that a single school was ranked Nth, is probably fair use.
