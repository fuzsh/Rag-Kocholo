        "text": "Lead singer and star of Irish boy band Boyzone Ronan Keating has revealed that he longs to shed his clean cut image and star in one of Quentin Tarantino’s famously dark films.\n\nThe popular Irish performer told Closer magazine: \"I've never ruled out going to Hollywood to pursue an acting career, and I'm a massive fan of Tarantino's. I'd love to show people a different side to me and star in one of his films.\"\n\nKeating, 32, is best known for his days in chart-topping Irish band Boyzone, which along with Westlife, represented the country during the heyday of boy bands in the 1990s.\n\nThe band released number one hit singles and four number one albums in Britain, and their song “No Matter What” was a huge smash around the world.\n\nKeating went on to launch a successful solo career, with numerous hit pop songs to his name.\n\nThe singer was entered in the Guinness Book of Records for being the only artist ever to have 30 consecutive top 10 singles on the British charts.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of other boy bands like the U.S.’s New Kids on the Block, Boyzone reunited in 2008, released a new hit single “Love You Anyway” and a Greatest Hits album and embarked on a successful reunion tour.\n\nPerhaps we’ll next see star Keating dominate the box offices."
