        "text": "Quentin Tarantino's major film debut was in 1992 with the cult classic Reservoir Dogs, but some fans may not know that the director was writing screenplays as far back as the mid-70s. Tarantino was around 12 when he wrote the script for Captain Peachfuzz and the Anchovy Bandit, and the film follows a pizza parlor-robbing bandit that later teams up with a woman that he falls in love with.\n\nWhile the movie was never made, Tarantino went on to write and direct hits like Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds. His most recent project, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, is currently up for a number of Academy Awards, and the movie has also snagged Best Supporting Actor wins for Brad Pitt at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs.\n\nBut before his big day, let's take a look at the director's bank account—here's what we know about Quentin Tarantino's net worth.\n\nQuentin Tarantino's net worth is $120 million.\n\nTarantino's highest-grossing films are Django Unchained, Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, Inglourious Basterds, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill: Volume 1, with Django taking the top spot with almost $450 million in box office earnings worldwide.\n\nThere isn't much known about how much Tarantino earns for his movies, but Celebrity Net Worth reports that he usually takes home a $20 million payday, and he often also gets a percentage of the movie's profit on the backend. He also earns a little more because he also writes his scripts.\n\nTarantino usually directs a movie every couple of years, and he's claimed that his next movie (his tenth), will be his last. However, a number of outlets maintain that the director has actually made way more than 10 movies."
