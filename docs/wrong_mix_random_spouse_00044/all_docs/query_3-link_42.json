At once film criticism, film theory, a feat of reporting, and wonderful personal history, the audience will get a rare perspective about cinema possible only from Tarantino himself.\n\nABOUT QUENTIN TARANTINO\n\nWith his vibrant imagination and dedication to richly layered storytelling QUENTIN TARANTINO is one of the most celebrated filmmakers of his generation. He made his directorial debut in 1992 with RESERVOIR DOGS, and then co-wrote, directed and starred in one of his most beloved films, PULP FICTION, which won his first Oscar® for Best Screenplay. Followed by the highly acclaimed films JACKIE BROWN, KILL BILL VOL. 1 and VOL. 2, and DEATH PROOF, Tarantino then released his World War II epic, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED (which won his second Oscar® for Best Screenplay), and the HATEFUL EIGHT. Tarantino’s most recent film, ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD, was nominated for five Golden Globes, ten BAFTAS, and ten Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 2021, Tarantino’s debut novel, ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD was sold in 31 languages and became an instant international bestseller. The novel landed at the #1 position on The New York Times, Amazon, IndieBound, and USA Today Bestseller Lists.\n\nHarperCollins Publishers will release CINEMA SPECULATION on November 1, 2022.\n\nAs of July 1, The Town Hall is mask friendly.
