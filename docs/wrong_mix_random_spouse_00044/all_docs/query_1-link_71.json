        "text": "1. Ruba Islam\n\n2. Reservoir Dogs Shot Types: We are shown longshots of 5 men dressed in black suits walking down a street with cigarettes in their mouth. The suits imply that they are serious characters, the themes that are introduced within the opening suggests that this could be a crime/gangster film. The suits and the sunglasses reinforce this idea. The camera cuts to a close-up shot of each of their faces and the on screen text introduces 8 of the actors names this is when we find out that the director himself is an actor in his film. A tracking long shot is then used showing the back of the men as they continue to walk and the title of the film is introduced. Sound: The opening of Reservoir dogs begins with a voiceover which is the main element of the opening sequence as it is famous for being dialogue-driven . The soundtrack used is by George Baker – Little Green Bag, it is an upbeat rock song which talks about drugs this connotes that these men possibly sell drugs for a living. This introduces the themes of gang crime/violence which Quentin Tarantino uses in his style of film making. Editing Of titles: The titles of the actors names are superimposed over the 3-5 second shots of them. The editing allows them all to have equal amounts of screen time which suggests that they are all significant to the narrative and they consider each other as equals and friends. The titles that are shown towards the end are not shown with any visuals they are shown in a list form which scroll down one after the other. Colour: The colours used for the font of the titles is yellow as it stands out against a black screen.\n\n3. Pulp Fiction Shot Types: The first shot is a dictionary definition of the word ‘Pulp’ and the second definition sets the tone of the film straight away. Tarantino uses the same thing in the opening of Grindhouse. We are then shown a mid-shot introducing the two protagonists (male & female) having a conversation in a diner. A similar scene is also used in the opening of Reservoir Dogs when they are in the coffee shop. Sound: The conversation between the characters lets the audience know that they are in fact criminals although they appear to look ordinary. They talk about an armed robbery which they then carry out as the man gets out the gun and the woman threatens the people in the diner this connotes violence and crime illustrating that this is a film with the same genre as ‘Reservoir Dogs’. It also presents the woman as being just as dominant and equally responsible for the robbery as the man .The soundtrack that is used is ‘Misirlou’ by Dick Dale which is a Rock/pop song. Editing of titles: The directors name is shown before the main title which is how it is also presented in ‘Reservoir Dogs’. Then the title emerges in a large bold font and takes up the entire shot It then slowly zooms out, as the actors names slowly appears superimposed over the title they last for about 3-5 seconds. Then the co-stars names appear again in the form of the list scrolling down quite quickly. The co-stars names do not stay on the screen for as long as the main actors which suggests that they are less important. Colour: Iconic yellow lettering for the font is used once again in this opening.\n\n4. Kill Bill Volume 1 Shot types: The first shot is of a quote from the old proverb which is similar to ‘Pulp Fiction’ and ‘Grindhouse’ but in this opening the quote replaces the dictionary definition. The quote is a commonly used proverb which sets the tone for the rest of the film . It also implies that revenge is the key theme. A black and white close up shot of a bride is used, she has blood and bruises on her face, she is presented as a stereotypical victim. A tracking shot is also used to show a pair of polished black shoes walking slowly across the floor to build suspense. Sound: Diegetic sound of heavy breathing and the footsteps of shoes on a wooden floor. Tarantino uses diegetic sound which matches what the audience are shown in most of his openings. There is also a sudden gunshot which is used to shock the audience. During the titles Nancy Sinatra – Bang Bang (my baby shot me down) begins to play. Editing of titles: The titles are simplistic, it is a classic white on black. The directors name appears this time acknowledging the fact that this is ‘The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino’ followed by the main actors name written in bold lettering which signifies that she is more important than the other cast members. The title of the film is shown at the same time as the gunshot which is appropriate since it is called ‘Kill Bill’ ."
