Filming dates are listed as June 12 to July 31.\n\nTeddy Schwarzman from Black Bear Pictures and David Heyman, the founder of Heyday Films, are producers of \"The Rivals of Amziah King.\" Heyday Films has produced notable films such as the \"Harry Potter\" series, the \"Fantastic Beasts\" movies, and Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" Schwarzman said he was excited about partnering with Heyday and lauded Patterson's visionary filmmaking.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is scheduled to shoot \"The Rivals of Amziah King,\" a crime thriller written by Andrew Patterson, in Alabama this summer. The announcement of McConaughey was made on May 8 by Black Bear Pictures, an independent studio based in California and London.\n\nSpecific plot details are being kept secret, Deadline describes the film as a character-driven crime thriller set in Oklahoma. McConaughey will portray Amziah King.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is known for his roles in films such as \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"A Time to Kill,\" \"The Lincoln Lawyer,\" \"Magic Mike,\" \"Mud,\" and \"Interstellar.\" He has received an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for his role in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" in 2013.\n\nThis won't be McConaughey's first visit to Alabama, as he filmed for the movie \"Failure to Launch\" in Cherokee and Etowah counties back in 2006.
