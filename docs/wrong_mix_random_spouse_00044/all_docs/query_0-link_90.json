Kill!’\n\nEli Roth is set to star in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Bastards.\n\nThe torture porn director, a protégé of Tarantino, will play baseball bat-wielding Nazi hunter Sergeant Donnie Donowitz.\n\nTarantino had also considered casting Leonardo DiCaprio as SS Colonel Hans Landa but decided that the role should go to a German actor.\n\nBrad Pitt is still in talks to star in the film, though his availability conflict with Tarantino’s schedule.\n\nThe star of the US Office B.J. Novak has also joined the cast as PFC Utivich, a punk New York soldier.\n\nThe film, which follows Jewish soldiers in Vichy-era France out for revenge on their Nazi oppressors, is set to shoot later this year.\n\nIn other Tarantino news, rumours suggest the Kill Bill director has a new blonde in mind: former pop-star princess Britney Spears."
