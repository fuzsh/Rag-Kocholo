        "text": "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood has smashed Quentin Tarantino’s record for his films’ most successful opening weekend at the box-office.\n\nThe veteran director’s ninth film has beaten his 2009 movie Inglorious Basterds for amassing the biggest receipts at US cinemas.\n\nStarring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood depicts an aging Hollywood actor and his stunt double as successful new actor Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) moves in next door.\n\nThe film is based on the real-life killing of Tate by disciples of the Manson Family cult.\n\nOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood grossed $40m in US cinemas this weekend, beating the $38m amassed by Inglorious Basterds a decade ago.\n\nTarantino’s new film is his first made without disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. Bosses at Sony had predicted Once Upon A Time In Hollywood would make $30m on its opening weekend.\n\nOverall, Django Unchained has so far been Tarantino’s most successful film. It made $425m worldwide, after opening with $30m in its first weekend at US cinemas in 2012. By comparison, Inglorious Basterds eventually made $321m worldwide.\n\nOnce Upon A Time In Hollywood is one of Tarantino’s most expensive films to make, at a cost of $90m.\n\nDespite its successful opening weekend, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood only entered the US box-office charts at No 2 this weekend.\n\nDisney’s new remake of The Lion King remains at No 1 on its second weekend.\n\nThe Lion King made $75.5m this weekend in the US. It has so far amassed global box-office receipts of nearly $1 billion, having earned $963m worldwide."
