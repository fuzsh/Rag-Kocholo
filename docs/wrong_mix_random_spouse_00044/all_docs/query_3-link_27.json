That film, according to Fierman, \"had a seismic cultural impact, taking the indie-film movement mainstream, spawning countless pale imitations, and turning its director into a global star.\" Following his early success, Fierman noted, \"Tarantino simply disappeared,\" bringing out in the next decade the 1997 Jackie Brown, the mega-hit Pulp Fiction, and the sprawling Kill Bill, which was in production for 155 days, came in millions of dollars over budget, and finally was divided into two films, Volume 1 and Volume 2, released several months apart. Fierman went on to note that \"it suddenly seems possible that Quentin Tarantino has finally gone gloriously, hilariously, irrevocably insane.\"\n\nFew filmmakers have succeeded in building a mystique, and indeed an entire cinematic \"world,\" to the degree achieved by Tarantino, whose critical reputation is based on the four movies he has written and directed. The filmmaker also played roles in all four movies, each of them successively smaller: from Mr. Brown in Reservoir Dogs, who in the opening scene delivers a memorable (and X-rated) exegesis on Madonna's 1985 hit \"Like a Virgin\"; to Jimmie in Pulp Fiction, a man irritable over a messy dead body in the back seat of his car; to a voice on an answering machine in Jackie Brown; to a disem-bodied voice in Kill Bill. Despite critical complaints regarding the diminution of his creative drive, the characteristics of Tarantino's art have propelled him to the status, as he observed somewhat derisively in a 1997 interview with the New York Times Magazine, of \"an adjective\": \"Every third script out there,\" he said, \"is described as 'Tarantino-esque.'\"\n\nRough Beginnings\n\nThe fact that Tarantino first emerged as an independent filmmaker is a crucial element of his abiding success. He came from far outside the Hollywood establishment, gaining his knowledge of the movies not by going to film school—he is a high-school dropout—but by feeding a long-term addiction to movies themselves. Born in 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, he was named after a character on television played by the actor Burt Reynolds in the television series Gunsmoke. Tarantino never met his biological father, an amateur musician. His mother Connie, then living in Tennessee while attending college, thereafter married a professional musician named Curt Zastoupil, earned her microbiology degree, and moved with her young son back to her native California, where she became a health-care executive and settled in Harbor City in suburban Los Angeles. Middle class, the town also bordered on rougher neighborhoods, and it was in those borderlands that young Tarantino liked to spend time, haunting a theater in the nearby town of Carson that \"showed all the kung fu movies,\" Tarantino once recalled, \"and the Allied International movies like The Van.\" Hyperactive, Tarantino did poorly in school, finally dropping out in the ninth grade after flunking for several years. As a teenager, he worked as an usher in a pornographic theater and later spent five years as a minimum-wage employee in what he recalled as \"the best video store in the Los Angeles area,\" Video Archives.\n\nThere he met Roger Avary, another future director—Tarantino would be executive producer on Avary's Killing Zoe in 1994—who later worked with Tarantino on the story for Pulp Fiction. The video store became something of a film college for Tarantino. He, Avary, and others constituted an informal film club: \"I basically lived [at the video store] . . . for years,\" Tarantino told David Wild in a 1994 Rolling Stone interview. \"We'd get off work, close up the store, then sit around and watch movies all night. Other times Roger, our friend Scott, and I would take a Friday and plot things out so we could see all four new movies we were interested in. We always took whatever we got paid and put it right back into the industry.\"\n\nEventually, however, Tarantino began to feel like the character Clarence in the 1993 film True Romance, who, as Wild noted, \"was based on Tarantino's younger days living near the Los Angeles airport. 'All day long he just sees people taking off and leaving, and he's going nowhere. I'm not that guy anymore.'\" How he ceased to be \"that guy\" is the stuff of independent-film legend, a story that has inspired ambitious filmmakers ever since. In 1990 Tarantino and Avary went to work with producer John Langley, a regular video-store customer, and moved to Hollywood. There they started to develop the all-important contacts—most notably with producer Lawrence Bender—necessary in the world of filmmaking, and they raised $1.5 million. In film terms it was a shoestring budget at best; but it was enough to make Reservoir Dogs, a film that grossed many times that sum.\n\nEarly Success\n\nThe resulting work brought out cautionary statements from several reviewers—Terrence Rafferty of the New Yorker, for instance, described Reservoir Dogs as \"stylized mayhem and playground machismo\"—but audiences, and indeed even many critics, were captivated. The story itself, modeled on Stanley Kubrick's 1956 film The Killing, is simple: an aging crime boss and his son gather a group of criminals, designated by colors (e.g., Mr. Blond, Mr. Pink) in order to protect their identities, and plan a jewelry-store heist. But one of them is a cop, and the robbery goes badly. The crime itself is not depicted, and much of the action takes place afterward in a warehouse where the robbers have gathered to square off against one another in an attempt to find the traitor. The film plays tricks with time, shifting backward and forward, and as Manohla Dargis in ArtForum observed, \"The details [of the heist] surface only as retold by the robbers. . . . The effectis less the Rashomon point about rival truths than something akin to psychoanalysis: like the therapeutic process, Reservoir Dogs tells a story, is about telling stories, and depends on stories for its creation.\" As notable as the temporal tricks are the film's stylistic touches, which in retrospect appear as vintage Tarantino: the brutal violence against the 1970s soundtrack, the use of matching anonymous black suits by the color-designated robbers, and the long quasi-philosophical discussions which take place in the stage-like warehouse.\n\nTarantino, wrote Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times, \"has a gift for writing great bursts of caustic, quirky dialogue,\" and even Rafferty, in the middle of a largely negative review, conceded that \"Tarantino is a director to watch.\" Turan was also critical of the film, wishing it were not so \"determinedly one-dimensional, so in love with operatic violence at the expense of everything else\"; nonetheless he too credited \"the undeniable skill and elan that Tarantino brings to all this.\" Likewise, Stanley Kauffmann of the New Republic wrote that while a \"great deal of Reservoir Dogs . . . was difficult for me to watch\" and faulted the director's penchant for violence but noted that \"cinematically speaking, it's plainly the debut of a talent.\" Jonathan Romney, writing in the New Statesman, expressed concern for the way the famous ear-cutting scene incited audiences to want to see the violence unfold, yet he called Tarantino \"a young director whose noir literacy is evident in every detail.\"\n\nFrom Pulp Fiction to Jackie Brown\n\nWhile many critics were concerned about the violence, they nonetheless admired Tarantino's abilities as a promising new talent. In the case of True Romance, directed by Tony Scott from a screenplay by Tarantino, reviews were less positive and some enthusiasm cooled. However, things heated up again when Tarantino once again took to the director's chair for the award-winning 1994 release Pulp Fiction. As with Reservoir Dogs, the storyline in Pulp Fiction moves back and forth along the time line, ending just a few minutes after the point at which it begins, but it is more complex than its predecessor. Whereas Reservoir Dogs takes place entirely in a world of men and features no female lead characters, Pulp Fiction involves at least as much male-female conflict as male-male. In terms of structure it has several plots, most of them surrounding a drug lord named Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). In the opening scene, a husband-and-wife crime team (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) plan a stickup in a restaurant; then the action leaves them, not to return until the end of the movie some two and a half hours later. In between, there are subplots involving two hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson) employed by Marsellus; Marsellus's alluring wife (Uma Thurman), who suffers a near-fatal heroin overdose while out on the town with Travolta; and a boxer (Bruce Willis) who double-crosses Marsellus and flees for his life, only to find himself in a position to save the man who wants to kill him. In the final scene, after dealing with Plummer and Roth, Jackson's character makes a decision to leave his life of crime; already the audience has seen a segment that takes place later in time in which Travolta confronts the results of his own refusal to do so.\n\n\"The script,\" wrote Richard Alleva in Commonweal, \"is put together with a jeweler's precision, and makes the writing of every American film I've seen in the past year . . . seem like so much child's play.\" Kauffmann, who in the New Republic had already expressed reservations about Tarantino's directorial debut, still found cause for alarm in the new film's violence, but held that \"Pulp Fiction is Reservoir Dogs rewarded.\" Peter Travers in Rolling Stone described the film as \"ferocious fun without a trace of caution, complacency or political correctness to inhibit its 154 deliciously lurid minutes.\" David Denby in New York, admitting that \"I can't say I was a fan of . . . Reservoir Dogs,\" observed that in Pulp Fiction, \"Tarantino seems to be goosing the entire solemn history of action cinema . . . . In the roundelay of violence and comedy that is Pulp Fiction, he has hilariously summed up an immense genre and gloriously achieved his exit from it. Life beckons from beyond the video store.\"\n\nSeveral reviewers, such as T. J. Binyon of the Times Literary Supplement, noted that although the film's title seems to relate to books, Pulp Fiction is more about movies than literature. With Jackie Brown, released three years later, Tarantino took a step closer to literature by adapting an Elmore Leonard book; in the meantime, as he enjoyed the enormous fame and success that came in the wake of Pulp Fiction, he worked on a number of other projects. Along with three other directors, he contributed a segment to the film Four Rooms and worked with fellow indie filmmaker Robert Rodriguez on From Dusk 'till Dawn. Jack Matthews of the Los Angeles Times described From Dusk 'till Dawn as \"a Frankenstein's monster of used movie parts\" involving \"a pair of murdering, bank-robbing brothers\" who find themselves at \"a topless biker bar in the middle of nowhere\" and end up in a \"chaotic, bloody, nonstop battle with ancient Aztec vampires.\"\n\nTarantino was in more familiar territory with Jackie Brown, a film more complex than Pulp Fiction in terms of character development and the double-crosses that move the plot forward, and less complex in its relatively linear use of time. The story centers on Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), an underpaid flight attendant earning extra money by helping arms dealer Ordell (Jackson) launder money. But when she is caught, Ordell, fearing that she will turn him over to the police, wants to eliminate her. On this backbone of plot are attached numerous other subplots involving Ordell's airhead girlfriend (Bridget Fonda), a henchman who has just gotten out of prison (Robert De Niro), the bail bondsman who comes to Jackie's rescue (Robert Forster), and the federal agents who goad Jackie into helping them (Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen). All her adversaries underestimate Jackie, as a sequence involving the transfer of a bag—the only tricky use of time in the movie, involving the replay of a scene from three points of view—serves to illustrate.\n\nTodd McCarthy of Variety faulted Tarantino for taking too long to tell his story—like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown clocks in at approximately 150 minutes—but held that the \"film takes its own sweet time setting its gears in motion, with the emphasis on sweet when it comes to amusingly establishing its characters.\" Turan, writing in the Los Angeles Times, warned that \"those expecting Tarantino to pick up where he left off [in Pulp Fiction] will be disappointed in Jackie Brown. Instead of rearranging audience's sensibilities, he's taken the typically twisty plot of Leonard's Rum Punch and run it through his personal Mixmaster. The result is a raunchy doodle, a leisurely and easygoing diversion.\" Anthony Lane of the New Yorker quoted with approval an example of Tarantino's dialogue: when Ordell warns his girlfriend that smoking marijuana will \"rob you of your ambition,\" she says, \"Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.\" Travers in Rolling Stone wrote that Tarantino \"scores a knockout.... Loaded with action, laughs, smart dialogue, and potent performances, Jackie Brown is most memorable for its unexpected feeling.\" Tarantino, Travers concluded, charts new territory, and just as the film ends with Jackie \"driving toward a life she can't define,\" listening to \"a '70s song about busting out of ghettos\"—Bobby Womack's \"Across 110th Street\"—so the film \"crackles with the fear and exhilaration of moving on.\"\n\nThe Tarantino Aesthetic\n\nCertain aspects characterize the Tarantino directoral aesthetic, and though not as visible in films where his touch appears uncredited, they are nonetheless there for the discerning to see. One writer suggested, for instance, that his contribution to the 1995 film Crimson Tide could be summed up in two references to comic books which, the reviewer implied, seemed out of character when uttered by actor Denzel Washington. Comic books play a significant part in Tarantino's onscreen world, and numerous critics have likened his films to \"cartoons\" in the way that they transform cinematic violence—images that have become cliches through ceaseless repetition in B-grade films—into a form of postmodern humor. Tarantino himself, particularly during his five years as a clerk in a Los Angeles video store, has absorbed a vast store of film history, making his films almost encyclopedic in their references and cross-references.\n\nWhile viewers are unlikely to find Ingmar Bergman or Jean Cocteau making cameos in Tarantino's movies, critics have found in Reservoir Dogs references to the works of both Stanley Kubrick and Jean-Luc Goddard. Tarantino's overriding interest is in pop culture, and his melding of this with a modicum of relatively high-minded material has won him the praise of numerous critics. There is little difference between Tarantino the screenwriter and Tarantino the man, as Wild noted in his profile. His home is a shrine to pop paraphernalia, the flotsam and jetsam of twentieth-century culture: \"Along with items from his own movies,\" wrote Wild, \"including the razor used in the infamous ear-slicing scene [in Reservoir Dogs], there's a frighteningly lifelike head of B-movie diva Barbara Steele, a pack of genuine Texas Chainsaw chili, a Zorro knife given to him by Jennifer Beals, a Robert Vaughn doll, cases by the dozen of bottled Pepsi, and what is undoubtedly one of the world's most impressive collections of film-and TV-related board games.\"\n\nWild described Tarantino as a \"chatterbox,\" a fitting quality given the fact that, for all the blood and mayhem in them, his films are driven more by dialogue than by action. Ron Rosenbaum in Esquire examined the famous disagreement between Tarantino and director Oliver Stone over Stone's 1994 film Natural Born Killers. Stone had so altered Tarantino's story that the latter disclaimed all involvement in the resulting film and even delayed release of Pulp Fiction in order to further establish his distance. Rosenbaum portrayed the difference between the two men's temperaments as a \"rival[ry of] sensibilities\" not unlike that between Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald: \"Mythic Macho Outdoor Man of Nature versus Aesthete Analyst of Indoor Intrigue and Internal Self-Consciousness.\" Whereas Stone favored action, Rosenbaum noted, Tarantino's psyche found its natural home with dialogue: \"If you watch Tarantino's films, if you read his screenplays, all that writhing and stewing of images is not so much war as dance. 'To me, violence is a totally aesthetic subject,' he once said. 'Saying you don't like violence in movies is like saying you don't like dance sequences in movies.'\"\n\nWhereas Stone's characters are figures of action, Rosenbaum indicated, Tarantino's are talkers, and what they talk about—albeit while on the way to committing shocking acts, or after they have done so—are the subjects that fascinate Tarantino. \"The great defining moments in Tarantino films,\" Rosenbaum explained, \"are almost always moments of literary criticism. The defining moment of Reservoir Dogs, . . . the scene that instantly distinguished it from all other violent gangster films ever made before, is the opening scene, in which his bank robbers are gathered around a breakfast table at a pancake house, deconstructing a Madonna song . . . . Oliver Stone, given that same group of murderous thugs, would have them facing off over urinals, comparing how long it took each to pee. Tarantino isn't afraid to depict his gangsters almost as if they were cultural-studies majors. And again, in Pulp Fiction, what's the defining moment? It's when Jules and Vincent (Jackson and Travolta), two hit men, are analyzing the philosophical implications of the way brand names for burgers—designations of value—shift in different linguistic frameworks. In his heart, Quentin Tarantino is an English major.\"\n\nThough violence, pop culture, and endless discussions are two aspects of the Tarantino aesthetic, they are not the sum total of his world. Another facet of his work as a filmmaker is that he resurrects stars often perceived to be past their glory days. In the case of Travolta, who had enjoyed almost dizzying success in a number of roles during the 1970s, Tarantino's casting in Pulp Fiction resulted in a full-scale revival, making Travolta in the 1990s every bit the star he had been twenty years before. Similarly, the director cast Forster and Grier, both of whom had done little notable work in recent years, in Jackie Brown. Describing the onscreen romance between Forster and Grier—the latter of whom Tarantino had admired for her roles in numerous 1970s \"blaxploitation films\"—Lane wrote in the New Yorker: Forster \"is fifty-six, she is forty-four; when was the last time you went to the movies—let alone a Tarantino movie—and saw a fond, unironic, interracial kiss between a couple who are a hundred years old?\"\n\nLane's larger point is that Tarantino seems to have mellowed as his career has progressed. He shocked audiences in Reservoir Dogs with a gruesome scene in which Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) cuts off a police officer's ear while the 1970s hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background. Likewise, Pulp Fiction featured a brutal S & M male-on-male rape scene, along with a large body count; by contrast, Jackie Brown, though it offers gore aplenty, and half the cast are dead by the end of the film, is more character-driven and—in places, such as a long tracking shot in which Ordell shoots an employee—restrained for Tarantino. The director himself has suggested that, although the shocking violence may get him the most headlines, its purpose is to illustrate a larger absurdity: the very deification of such bloodshed in American film. Thus the violence itself is a part of pop culture, inseparable from the references to B-movies and comic books, and this attitude has helped gain him a reputation as a witty and sardonic filmmaker simultaneously spoofing and glorifying the detritus of twentieth-century mass media.\n\nHis postmodern approach—Tarantino himself eschews the high-blown term—has earned him not only widespread admiration among critics, but also the allegiance of numerous stars. Jackson has appeared in two of his films, as have Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth; likewise Travolta, De Niro, Thurman, Willis, and Bridget Fonda have all played roles in Tarantino pictures. Keitel, a highly respected actor known for his interest in independent filmmaking, agreed to appear in Reservoir Dogs for a much smaller sum than his ordinary fee, simply because he believed in Tarantino's work.\n\nA Long Hiatus\n\nTarantino was nowhere to be seen in Hollywood for several years after what was basically an anemic box office take for Jackie Brown. As Fierman noted, \"'Where's Quentin?' quickly became an acidic Hollywood parlor game.\" Rumors abounded about his writer's block or supposed drug and alcohol abuse. In reality, Tarantino had reverted to his early love of acting, even playing a part in a Broadway play. He starred, along with George Clooney, in the 1998 film Full Tilt Boogie, and played in the 1998 stage revival of Wait until Dark. Reviewing that play, a contributor to Entertainment Weekly called Tarantino's performance \"bloodless\"; he was, as Rex Roberts reported in Insight on the News, generally \"panned\" by the theater critics. Jack Kroll, writing in Newsweek, remarked that the stage production of Wait until Dark is \"so dense with badness that it swallows its own cast.\"\n\nAfter these stage setbacks, Tarantino began working on another adaptation of an Elmore Leonard book, a Western, but gave up that project and then began work on a World War II script, which remained in the works through 2004. Meeting up again with actress Thurman (from Pulp Fiction) in 2000, he promised her he would have another script for her soon. It took a year and a half and he finally delivered the script for Kill Bill, a story about a reformed killer-for-hire known as The Bride (Thurman). Suffering a gunshot wound to the head on her wedding day while the rest of the wedding party is killed in a hail of gunfire, and surviving after a four-year coma, she vows revenge on the perpetrators: her former lover, Bill, as well as on his gang of foxy killers, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DIVAS), of whom she was once a member. These hired guns are a tip of the hat to a television show that Thurman's character describes at one point in the movie Pulp Fiction. The script was meant as an homage of sorts to the kung fu pictures Tarantino was addicted to as a youth, for the story is actually one extended fight scene from Beijing to Tokyo to Los Angeles as The Bride tracks Bill and his DIVAS. In addition to Thurman as The Bride, the movie also features actors such as Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah as part of the DIVAS, and David Carradine as the enigmatic Bill. During the monstrous shooting schedule of the film, some of the actors and crew began referring to the production as the \"traveling circus.\" Its production took twice as long as scheduled and the completed film's length was so prodigious that two movies were made from it. Part of this lengthy filming resulted from Tarantino mastering a new form of the directorial craft and getting down the balletic fight sequences of martial arts.\n\nKill Bill was released in two parts; Kill Bill: Volume 1 appeared in the fall of 2003 and Kill Bill: Volume 2 was released in early 2004. Variety's Todd McCarthy called it a \"hypertalented American film geek's fever dream of complete immersion in the world of Asian martial arts pictures.\" McCarthy went on to note that this \"strange, fun and densely textured work . . . gets better as it goes along.\" Time contributor Richard Corliss similarly dubbed it an \"effusion of movie love by the prime nerd-curator and hip creator of action films.\" For Corliss, the film is Tarantino's \"thank-you note\" to various genre films, among them Hong Kong's kung-fu movies, the yakuza gangster films of Japan, and 1970s-style spaghetti Westerns. But, according to Corliss, Kill Bill is not simply a re-creation of such films; instead Tarantino \"expands them into a daring new dimension\" with a tone \"at once playful and dead serious.\" Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, also had praise for the film, calling it a \"delirious splatter opera of cruelty and revenge.\" Gleiberman added, \"Each sequence in Kill Bill is like a detour that's more fun than the main road. . . . What a wizard Tarantino is!\" Speaking with Newsweek's David Ansen, Tarantino commented on the pastiche quality of his film and its recycling of martial-arts genre movies: \"It's recycled with a twist. It's me doing it, you know? With my point of view on it—which has never been done because mine is unique, all right? Not good or better. Just unique.\"\n\nFor some, Kill Bill was not so much unique as it was bloody. Writing in the New Statesman, Philip Kerr found the film to be \"about 105 minutes of relentless slashing, stabbing, hacking, cleaving, chipping, riving, quartering, and carving.\" Kerr missed Tarantino's \"blackly comic dialogue\" that was so much a part of his earlier films, and further noted: \"There was just blood and more blood\" in this \"disappointing\" film. For People contributor Leah Rosen, there are \"some electrifying fight scenes.\" However, \"this is at heart a hollow enterprise,\" Rosen concluded. Likewise New Republic contributor Kauffmann found little to like in the film, calling it a \"series of fights, little more.\" For Kauffmann these fight sequences were not \"frightening,\" but \"ludicrous.\"\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Quentin Tarantino\n\nIf you enjoy the works of Quentin Tarantino, you might want to check out the following films:\n\nDominic Sena, Swordfish, 2001.\n\nJohn Woo, Broken Arrow, 1995.\n\nCorey Yuen, The Transporter, 2002.\n\nFor Tarantino such criticisms are part of the growth process. \"I do believe in growth as a filmmaker,\" he told Ansen, \"but I don't think it's a daisy-chain—that you take the harvest from the last one and expand on it a little further, all right? If I were to just keep expanding on that Jackie Brown thing, you know, in 15 years' time I would be making some really geriatric movies. The thing is, I don't need to prove that I can do that with each new movie—because I've already proven I can do that. This time I wanted to grow as a filmmaker by what I consider exciting filmmaking.\"\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nBOOKS\n\nBernard, Jimi, Quentin Tarantino: The Man and His Movies, HarperPerennial (New York, NY), 1995.\n\nClarkson, Wensley, Quentin Tarantino: Shooting from the Hip, Overlook Press (Woodstock, NY), 1995.\n\nContemporary Theatre, Film, and Television, Volume 47, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2003.\n\nDawson, Jeff, Quentin Tarantino: The Cinema of Cool, Applause (New York, NY), 1995.\n\nInternational Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, Volume 2: Directors, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nNewsmakers, Issue 4, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1995.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nArtForum, November, 1992, Manohla Dargis, review of Reservoir Dogs, p. 11; March, 1995, pp. 63-66.\n\nCommonweal, October 22, 1993, p. 22; November 18, 1994, Richard Alleva, review of Pulp Fiction, pp. 30-31.\n\nEntertainment Weekly, December 19, 1997, Benjamin Svetkey, \"Jackie, Oh!,\" pp. 26-30; January 9, 1998, Owen Gleiberman, review of Jackie Brown, pp. 40-41; April 17, 1998, review of Wait until Dark, p. 64; August 7, 1998, review of Bloody Merry, p. 53; October 3, 2003, Daniel Fierman, \"The Kill Zone,\" p. 26; October 17, 2003, Owen Gleiberman, review of Kill Bill, p. 57.\n\nEsquire, December, 1997, p. 38.\n\nFilm Comment, January-February, 1996, pp. 83-88.\n\nInsight on the News, May 11, 1998, Rex Roberts, review of Wait Until Dark, pp. 38-39.\n\nLiterature-Film Quarterly, January, 1998, pp. 60-66.\n\nLos Angeles Times, October 23, 1992, Kenneth Turan, review of Reservoir Dogs, p.
