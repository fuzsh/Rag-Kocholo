        "text": "In the latest instance of Kanye West grabbing headlines, the controversial rapper told Piers Morgan that director Quentin Tarantino took the idea for Django Unchained from him.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nKanye West, who legally changed his name to Ye last year, claims he pitched the concept for Django Unchained to Tarantino and Jamie Foxx in 2005.\n\nAccording to the musician, he wanted the video for his hit song Gold Digger to be a story like the one that was eventually brought to the screen by Tarantino in the form of the 2012 film, Django Unchained.\n\nREAD NEXT - Kanye West to buy 'uncancellable' social media platform Parler\n\nREAD NEXT - Kanye West's Twitter and Instagram accounts locked over anti-Semitic posts\n\nThe claim was made as West continues to align himself with right-wing politics and champions the importance of free speech, having recently been locked out of his Instagram and Twitter accounts for allegedly anti-Semitic posts.\n\nWhat's been said?\n\n\"There are no limits to free speech, it’s all context, right?\" West said on Piers Morgan Uncensored. \"Tarantino can write a movie about slavery where, actually – him and Jamie, they got the idea from me because the idea for Django, I pitched to Jamie Foxx and Quentin Tarantino as the video for Gold Digger, and then Tarantino turned it into a film.\"\n\nHe added: \"But in that film, he puts a context, he creates a context where Leonardo DiCaprio is allowed to use the [N-word] multiple times, within that context. So Hollywood's job is to frame things. And they allow what content is accepted and what's not.\"\n\nBackground\n\nWest has made a number of controversial statements in recent weeks, resulting in multiple high-profile brands severing ties with the 45-year-old.\n\nThe hip-hop artist has agreed to purchase the 'uncancellable', conservative-friendly social media platform Parler after his Instagram and Twitter accounts were restricted last week following a series of allegedly anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nWest had previously worn a 'White Lives Matter' T-shirt during Paris fashion week and went on a spree of sharing private text messages with fellow rapper Diddy, including one in which West accused him of being controlled by Jewish people.\n\nDjango Unchained\n\nTarantino's Django Unchained is a 2012 revisionist Western film starring Jamie Foxx as a freed slave who joins forces with a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), with the goal of freeing his wife from slavery.\n\nWhile the film was a critical and commercial triumph, Django Unchained also courted controversy upon its release, with some ridiculing the use of racial slurs in the dialogue and the depiction of violence against slaves on screen.\n\nREAD NEXT - Kanye West Netflix documentary Jeen-Yuhs is a three-part, sprawling epic\n\nREAD NEXT - The weird and wild journey of Kanye West's latest album Donda"
