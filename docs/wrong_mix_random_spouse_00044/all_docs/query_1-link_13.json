Any excuse for me to go back to New Zealand, and work with those people I'd take.\n\n“But there are other projects as well that I've had to consider - and to do that for over a year, it wouldn't have left me time to do anything else.\"\n\nAsked about her dream role, the young actress has previously said she would love to work with ‘Pulp Fiction’ director Quentin Tarantino, who is famed for his shocking films full of violence and bad language.\n\nShe said: “I haven't worked with him, but I'd love to. I've talked to people who have, and they all say he's mad and that it's fantastic fun.\n\n“There's always such an ensemble feeling in his films, too. In 'Kill Bill', for example, of course Uma Thurman is the star but it really feels like a group effort.”"
