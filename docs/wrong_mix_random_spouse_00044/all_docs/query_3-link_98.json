If your party is more than 4, every effort will be made to seat your full party together, or at adjacent tables.\n\nYou can buy your tickets here.\n\nYes, there are chairs available.\n\nRegarding VIP seats, if your party is less than 4, you may be seated with another party. If your party is more than 4, every effort will be made to seat your full party together, or at adjacent tables.\n\nWe recommend walking, cycling, or using public transport to reach Riverside but if you wish to drive the following information is useful for car parking.\n\nQueen Caroline Street and Crisp Road both have plenty of pay & display parking spaces (but only for a maximum 2-hour stay and you canât extend after the 2 hours). For anything longer than 2 hours, we recommend Distillery Road (W6 9AD), which is less than 5 minutesâ walk from Riverside.\n\nFor electric cars, there is a Source London charging station nearby (42a Hammersmith Bridge Road).\n\nThe venue is partially available. For all access bookings, please call the Riverside Studios Box Office at 020 8237 1010.\n\nWe have accessible toilets with changing facilities and lifts to all levels.\n\nThere is a lay-by in front of the venue which has double yellow lines, ideal as a drop-off point as there is a dropped kerb for easy access to the pavement. Please note that this area can become congested, especially at the end of an event when there are many visitors leaving the venue. Blue Badge holders can park for up to three hours on any other single or double yellow line near the venue as per Blue Badge regulations."
