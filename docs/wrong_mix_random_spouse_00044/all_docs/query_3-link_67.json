        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The war effort by Quentin Tarantino and Brad Pitt has paid off as their history lesson “Inglourious Basterds” claimed victory at the box office with a $37.6 million debut.\n\nIt was Tarantino’s best opening ever, exceeding the $25.1 million haul for 2004’s “Kill Bill — Vol. 2.” Overseas, “Inglourious Basterds” added $27.5 million in 22 countries, giving it a worldwide total of $65.1 million.\n\nReleased domestically by the Weinstein Co. and overseas by Universal, “Inglourious Basterds” features Pitt and an international ensemble in a sprawling tale of Jewish commandos and a plot to take out Nazi leaders at a movie premiere during World War II.\n\nThe film provided a hit for Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who have managed only lackluster receipts since departing Disney-owned Miramax four years ago.\n\nAt Miramax, the Weinsteins balanced prestige and profit with a string of Academy Awards triumphs such as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago” and hits such as Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction” and the “Scary Movie” and “Scream” franchises.\n\n“Tarantino helped build the house of Miramax. He’s proving right now that he’s helping to build the house of Weinstein,” said Paul Dergarabedian, box-office analyst for Hollywood.com.\n\nThe top five:\n\n1. “Inglourious Basterds”\n\n$37.6 million\n\n2. “District 9”\n\n$18.9 million\n\n3. “G.I. Joe”\n\n$12.5 million\n\n4. “Time Traveler’s Wife”\n\n$10 million\n\n5. “Julie & Julia”\n\n$9 million"
