        "text": "In 1985, Quentin Tarantino was 22 and working behind the counter at Video Archives, a movie store in Manhattan Beach, California. He was, in his own words, “a brash know-it-all film geek”. The store shut its doors in 1994, but he’s gone on to bigger and better things.\n\nNow 59, he’s best known as the writer-director of nine features (from Reservoir Dogs in 1992 to Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood in 2019), his name above the title a guarantee of box-office bounty. He says he’s going to retire after number 10 and not be like all those other filmmakers who hit their peak and fade away.\n\nHis recent activities suggest, however, that he’s still going to be very busy. His initial success made it possible for him to buy all the VHS tapes left on the shelves when Video Archives closed down, and the profits from his subsequent work allowed him to rebuild the store in the Beverly Hills home he shares with his wife of four years and their two children.\n\nFurthermore, for the best part of a decade, he’s been owner and head programmer of the New Beverly Cinema at 7165 Beverly Blvd. Last year, he launched the Video Archives Podcast, on which he and his Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary shoot the celluloid breeze, and published his novelisation of Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.\n\nNow comes Cinema Speculation. Ostensibly a collection of essays about films he’s seen over the years, it’s also an unusual kind of self-portrait. The Tarantino who emerges from between its lines is a mixed bag: a restless soul, a blowhard bursting with enthusiasms, an egotistical bore, an intelligent Hollywood insider who also sees himself as a bit of a rebel, a kid who grew up with dreams he never abandoned …\n\nThe first chapter, Little Q Watching Big Movies, has him looking back on a largely unsupervised childhood spent at the movies. And not just any movies. At the age of seven, Big Q recalls, in the company of his stepfather – the first of numerous father figures in his life – he saw a double bill of John G Avildsen’s blood-drenched Joe and Carl Reiner’s pitch-black comedy, Where’s Poppa? (both 1970), at the Tiffany Theater on the Sunset Strip.\n\n“Wait a minute, you saw a double feature of Joe and Where’s Poppa?,” he reflexively exclaims, something he does a lot of in the book. “At seven?” The italics are his and there’s a flood to follow: for titles (which is fair enough), for characters in films (which is bizarre), and for emphasis (which is acceptable occasionally; but hey, there’s a hailstorm of them here, making it seem as if whole pages are shouting at you).\n\nCinema Speculation could be, but isn’t, subtitled The Revenge of the Nerd. Tarantino writes like the film geek behind the counter of the video store who’s suddenly laid his hands on a megaphone. That acquisition is a by-product of his (deserved) success as a filmmaker, not a sign of his virtuosity as a film critic or historian.\n\nHe desperately wants us to be in awe of him, to know that he’s not just a cool guy now; he was born that way. He tells us that, when he was 15 but tall enough to get into R-rated movies on his own, for example, he saw Taxi Driver for the first time “with an (except for me) all-black audience”. “What was our response?” he asks. “I dug it, they dug it, and as an audience, we dug it.” There’s an unsettling kind of desperation in this need to dig.\n\nDespite this, there is much to like about Cinema Speculation. As Tarantino scrutinises some of the key American films and filmmakers of the late 1960s and the ’70s, he might come off as a bit of a blabbermouth, but he is movie-savvy.\n\nLoading\n\nCasting an insightful eye across Bullitt (1968), Dirty Harry (1971) and director Don Siegel, Deliverance and The Getaway (both 1972), The Outfit (1973), Rolling Thunder (1977) and their director, John Flynn, and Hardcore (1979) and its director, Paul Schrader, he speculates shrewdly on the compromised heroes and charismatic bad guys who populate the action films of the era.\n\nHis commentary is seasoned with tasty behind-the-scenes titbits as well as an unbridled passion for his subject. He has clearly read widely about film and there’s even an entire chapter on how much he digs Los Angeles Times film critic Kevin Thomas. Alert to the cultural shifts that accompany the changing times, he’s perceptive about the shift in Hollywood from the “post-’60s anti-establishment auteurs” (Altman, Rafelson, Penn, Ashby, Friedkin & co.) to “the movie brat generation” (whose number includes Coppola, Scorsese, de Palma, Spielberg and Lucas).\n\n“When the anti-establishment auteurs did genre films,” he writes, “they engaged in genre deconstruction. The movie brats embraced genre films for their own ends. They didn’t want (for the most part) to make art film meditations on genre films; they wanted to make the best genre films ever made.”\n\nThe problem with Cinema Speculation, finally, is Tarantino’s scattershot approach. He’s desperately in need of an editor, although I wouldn’t want the assignment: I could be wrong, but I suspect he thinks he knows it all. But persistent digressions, interesting as some of them are, threaten to erase points he’s trying to make. His grammar is ramshackle, even allowing for the fact that he’s using the American version, and his viewpoints are generally throwaway rather than coherently argued.\n\nIn short, the book perfectly illustrates the notion that, even if you can take the boy out of the video store, you can’t take the video store out of the boy. You dig?\n\nCinema Speculation by Quentin Tarantino is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, $34.99.\n\nThe Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.
