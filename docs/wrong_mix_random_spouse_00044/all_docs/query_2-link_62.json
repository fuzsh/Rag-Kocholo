        "text": "It’s the season 13 finale of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Mac doesn’t know where he fits in as a gay man. It’s down to Frank to get Mac dancing as “the featured gay” on the Paddy’s Pub float after drawing the short straw with Dee and Charlie. When that fails, he’s got to help Mac come out to his dad, Luther, in Sunny’s bravest ever episode.\n\nSince officially coming out as gay in the all-time great Sunny episode “Hero or Hate Crime”, Mac’s sexuality has really been the focal point of his personality in the show, and though last week’s episode saw his leadership abilities in the absence of Dennis take precedence over his sexuality, this episode – the first and only one of the season to be written by Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day – takes a massive unconventional turn as far as this show goes.\n\nThere’s a comedic aspect prominent from the start in this one with Frank slamming a door (that wasn’t locked) in his face, busting his nose open and spending the episode using everything from paper coated in spicy buffalo wing sauce to hot glue and lemon juice to try to block his nose up to stop the bleeding. It’s the main recurring comedic gag throughout the episode and I found Frank’s face becoming swollen to the point of him looking utterly grotesque to be really funny. It was also amusing seeing Rickety Cricket dressed in bondage gear as Frank’s replacement when his mission to get Mac dancing on that float failed. I feel like there was more than enough in this one to appease fans of the show regardless of an ending that may not be everyone’s cup of tea.\n\nWhile there was a lot of good, there were also some aspects of the episode I was disappointed in, mainly Dennis once again not appearing and the little screen time given to Charlie and Dee. Hopefully season 14 sees Dennis back to appearing in every episode and we get to see more of The Gang together, which hasn’t been the case this season.\n\nThat being said, this episode, in particular the final segment was not about classic It’s Always Sunny comedy as this was not a regular episode of the show.\n\nIt’s a testament to the writing ability of McElhenney and Day that they were able to end the season finale of a show so revered for its comedy and political incorrectness in a manner that resembled a profound drama. For me there were three stages to this final scene where Mac danced with a woman who we’re told throughout the episode is, and is revealed at the end of this dance as, his depiction of God. My immediate reaction was to laugh at the concept of Mac doing a stage-show/dance routine in front of his dad and a plethora of prisoners. At the start I was expecting a riot to ensue, most likely one started by Frank. As the dance progressed I was thinking how utterly bizarre it was, until the ending shot of Mac lying in this woman’s arms with her whispering, “it’s ok” completely changed the tone of this scene and the perception of the episode.\n\nFor a character as politically incorrect and deplorable as Frank Reynolds to finally say “I get it” upon Mac telling Luther he’s gay and ending his dance, this shows a huge step in his own character development and really makes the audience ask themselves, “if he can get it, then surely anyone can?”\n\nI’ve been rating every episode of Sunny in my reviews for this season, and when comparing this to certain episodes of the show that has built its reputation as a black comedy, it’s definitely not one you’d show a non-fan in an attempt to get them into the show. On the other hand, in a season where It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has had episodes with their usual spin on social issues such as harassment in the workplace and gender neutrality, it’s great that they didn’t take the easy route in an episode based around sexuality and did something different, especially given the amount of jokes made in relation to this topic throughout the show’s history.\n\nAs an episode of Sunny, it’s far from the show’s peak, but this was still a tremendous watch that should be much more impactful as the season’s finale than it would have been placed in the middle of the season.\n\nRating: 8.75/10\n\nSeason 13 wrap-up\n\nAs a whole, I enjoyed this season of Sunny. While it isn’t the best season to date and has some very notable flaws – in particular many episodes not featuring all of The Gang and one of the poorer episodes in the show’s history – there’s been something from each episode that’s had me laughing and/or wanting to watch again. I would have preferred the season opener to not be intentionally designed to be strange in the absence of Dennis, but his return at the end was a fantastic moment and really increased my excitement for the next nine episodes. As I mentioned above, I’m hopeful Dennis will be featured in every episode next season as he does bring so much to the show and The Gang’s dynamic. It’ll also be good going into watching episodes not wondering if he’s going to pop up and being dismayed if he doesn’t.\n\nThere was an evident lack of utilising the secondary characters this season, with the majority seemingly bundled together for the Super Bowl episode to get them involved, and even then, I don’t feel we got enough of them in the time allocated to the episode.\n\nThe strong points have been great, with “Time’s Up For The Gang” and “The Gang Gets New Wheels” being the standouts of the season, whereas “The Gang Does a Clip Show”, with the exception of Frank’s extremely long legs and the amazing Seinfeld skit, being for me personally, the weakest episode in the show’s history.\n\nI’ve seen a lot of criticism for this season and some of it is very just, but I’d like to think this show still has a lot more life left in it based on the good from this season.\n\nBest episode: “The Gang Gets New Wheels”\n\nWorst episode: “The Gang Does a Clip Show”\n\nSeason rating: 7.95"
