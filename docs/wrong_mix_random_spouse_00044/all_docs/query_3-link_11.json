        "text": "If you’ve never seen Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained or Kill Bill then you might have been living under a rock for quite some time. Quentin Tarantino is the mastermind behind all of those movies (and more) and he’s been hailed for his talents in directing and screenwriting. If you’ve never stumbled upon a Tarantino flick do yourself a favor and check any one of them out – you won’t be disappointed. Tarantino’s latest release, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, has received critical acclaim, likely because of how detailed he was when it came to making the film come to life. Tarantino teamed up with production designer Barbra Ling to immaculately recreate LA in 1969. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Tarantino even enlisted the help of a Hollywood tour guide to rebuild Sharon Tate’s Cielo Drive house for the film. And speaking of houses…Quentin Tarantino has some rather interesting pieces of real estate – but don’t just take our word for it. Want to know more about Quentin Tarantino house? We’ve dug up all of the information you’d ever need about the elusive star’s properties.\n\nWhere Does Quentin Tarantino Live?\n\nQuentin Tarantino splits his time between his longtime home in the Hollywood Hills and his private luxury condo in New York City.\n\nQuentin Tarantino House Hollywood Hills\n\nLike pretty much every other famous person, Quentin Tarantino calls Los Angeles home. More specifically, Tarantino lives in an 8,733 square foot mansion up in the Hollywood Hills. Sitting pretty on a 1.23-acre lot, Tarantino’s estate is nestled on a private patch of land. His house was built in 1986 and it contains 8 bedrooms and 8 baths. Not a whole lot of information is available about Quentin Tarantino’s Hollywood Hills home, but its real estate listing states that it boasts a hot tub with a spa and aerial photographs of the property show a spacious outdoor pool with a diving board. Several of his luxury cars can also be seen parked in front of the house.\n\nQuentin Tarantino paid around $3 million for his luxury pad back in 1996. He purchased it from musician Richard Marx, who had lived there since 1989. Despite there not being any interior pictures of the abode available to the public, he has been residing in the same spot for years and Quentin Tarantino house address has become public knowledge (more on that later). In December of 2018, two burglars broke into the star’s home in an attempt to steal some very valuable items. There was just one problem: Tarantino was home at the time, and he wasn’t in the mood for any unwanted visitors. Tarantino allegedly confronted the suspects and they fled the scene with some stolen jewelry in their possession.\n\nQuentin Tarantino House New York City\n\nIf there’s one thing Quentin Tarantino is good at maintaining, it’s his anonymity when it comes to his real estate purchases. That could be because he buys properties through his trust instead of the name Quentin Tarantino. Public records reveal that the star paid $680,000 via Wilson Trust in 1998 to acquire a sweet luxury condo in New York City. Located at the affluential “15 Charles at Waverly Place” building in Manhattan’s West Village, Tarantino appears to inhabit a 10th-floor unit in the property. It makes perfect sense for Tarantino to own his own abode in a spot like NYC. Having to always travel from coast to coast for his job would require him to constantly stay in hotels, so opting for a quiet condo instead seems far more desirable.\n\nQuentin Tarantino Oscar\n\nQuentin Tarantino is a two-time Oscar winner. He was awarded his first Oscar in 1995 for “Best Original Screenplay” for the film Pulp Fiction. He won his second Oscar in 2013 for “Best Original Screenplay” for Django Unchained. Despite being a critically acclaimed for his directing, Tarantino has yet to win an Oscar for his work as a director – his only Oscars have been for his work as a screenwriter. Although there was serious buzz for him to snag an award for his work on Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, he didn’t. The critically acclaimed 2019 film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Directing, or Best Original Screenplay.\n\nQuentin Tarantino Harvey Weinstein\n\nQuentin Tarantino notoriously had a longstanding business relationship (and friendship) with disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein. In fact, all of Tarantino’s films involved Weinstein up until 2017. That year, Tarantino cut all ties with Weinstein allegations of sexual abuse surfaced. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood was the first of his movies that Weinstein did not have a hand in making. Instead, Sony Pictures won a bidding war to distribute the film.\n\nHow Many Movies Will Tarantino Make?\n\nFor many years now, Quentin Tarantino has stated that he will only make 10 movies and then retire from his career as a filmmaker. While that sentiment might not make sense for someone who has been successfully making movies for decades, it’s something that Tarantino remains firm about. Some believe that Tarantino’s “10 movie” rule is just a ploy to draw interest to his films, but he says that’s just not the case. The reason for Tarantino’s desire to dip out of the film industry is rather simple. He’s long expressed that he wants to express his creativity through other outlets – including writing a novel, a play and even a television series. His most recent film, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, marks his 9th film. While there’s no official word on what his next project will entail, many have speculated that he could work on the third installment of Kill Bill, a Star Wars film (he’s a huge fan) or potentially something entirely different. Will Tarantino really follow through with his plans to retire after completing 10 films? Only time will tell!\n\nNew Beverly Cinema\n\nWe’ve seen some seriously cool pieces of celebrity-owned real estate over here, but perhaps one of the more interesting acquisitions belongs to Quentin Tarantino. While many A-listers own lavish estates all over the world, Tarantino owns a fully functioning historic movie theatre in Los Angeles. Located at 7165 Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles, the property has housed various businesses with a variety of names over the years. It started out as a candy store, then it became a variety theater, and at one time it was even a nightclub called “Slapsy Maxie’s”. By the 1950’s, the building was converted into a movie theater and was called “The New Yorker Theater”, the “Europa”, and the “Eros” before finally settling in as the “New Beverly Cinema”.\n\nThe New Beverly boasts seating for 300 and was designed by architects John P. Edwards and Warren Frazier Overpeck. The property first opened its doors in 1929 and remains one of the oldest revival houses in the area. Tarantino purchased the cinema in 2007 in a bid to save it from redevelopment following owner Sherman Torgan’s death. Tarantino was adamant about preserving the New Beverly Cinema’s legacy and vowed to keep it running, stating, “As long as I’m alive, and as long as I’m rich, the New Beverly will be there”. In 2014, the star took over full programming responsibilities for the theater and updated the building with new light fixtures, seats and a double film projector. The New Beverly also underwent a series of renovations in 2018. Tarantino is known to occasionally suspend regular double feature programming at the theater in order to offer first time screening of his latest film projects. Most recently, Tarantino offered viewings of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood – a film that takes place during Hollywood’s golden age. The film focuses around the 1969 mansion family murders. The movie stars Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth, Leonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, Emile Hirsh as Jay Sebring and Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate (who was married to Roman Polanski and pregnant with his child at the time of the heinous crime).\n\nQuentin Tarantino Age\n\nThe famed actor, director and writer was born on March 27, 1963.\n\nQuentin Tarantino Height\n\nHow tall is Quentin Tarantino, you ask? His height is listed as 6’1.\n\nQuentin Tarantino Net Worth\n\nQuentin Tarantino is responsible for some majorly successful movies. He’s a motivated director and screenwriter, and his career proves that his perseverance has paid off in dividends. He started out as an independent filmmaker and used the money from the sale of the True Romance script, to fund the film Reservoir Dogs in 1992 – which went on to be dubbed the “Greatest Independent Film of All Time”. Tarantino made $50,000 for that script but his paychecks would only become bigger from then on. His next release, 1994’s Pulp Fiction, went on to generate $9.3 million during its opening weekend. And $214 million worldwide. Obviously Pulp Fiction went on to become a cult classic and Tarantino solidified himself as one of Hollywood’s hottest filmmakers.\n\nThe popular Kill Bill franchise generated $335 million while 2009’s Inglourious Basterds grossed $321 million. The 2012 film Django Unchained impressively became Tarantino’s highest-earning film coming in with $425 million at the box office. His most recent film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood grossed $373 million worldwide. Not too shabby, right? Other well-known Tarantino films include Hostel, Killing Zoe, and From Dusk Till Dawn. By now you’re probably wondering exactly how much money Quentin Tarantino has and the answer is…quite a bit. Quentin Tarantino’s net worth is said to be in the ballpark of $120 million.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino\n\nhttps://www.zillow.com/homedetails/7471-Woodrow-Wilson-Dr-Los-Angeles-CA-90046/20045218_zpid/\n\nhttps://www.bergproperties.com/blog/Quentin/\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/quentin-tarantino-burglars-home-la-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-film-a8688351.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Beverly_Cinema\n\nhttps://www.emporis.com/buildings/115694/15-charles-street-new-york-city-ny-usa\n\nhttps://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/quentin-tarantino-how-much-is-the-oscar-winning-pulp-fiction-director-worth.html/\n\nhttps://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-book-play-series/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html"
