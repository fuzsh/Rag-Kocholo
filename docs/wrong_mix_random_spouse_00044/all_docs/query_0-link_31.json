It stars Jamie Foxx as Django, a freed slave, who teams up with a bounty hunter called Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) to free his wife from plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).[1] Django Unchained was screened for the first time at the Directors Guild of America on December 1, 2012.[2] Its official premiere was cancelled in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and was replaced with a screening for the cast and crew.[3] Django Unchained was released on December 25, 2012 in the United States and on January 18, 2013 in the United Kingdom.[1] As of December 7, 2013, Django Unchained has earned over $425 million at the box office.[4]\n\nThe film has garnered various awards and nominations, with most nominations recognising the film itself, Tarantino's screenplay and the cast's acting performances, particularly those of Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio.

Michael Riva, received a posthumous nomination for Excellence in Production Design for a Period Film from the Art Directors Guild.
