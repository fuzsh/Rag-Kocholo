        "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nWhen Paltrow was 22 years old, Weinstein hired her to star in the 1995 movie \"Emma.\" Before filming began, the actress told The New York Times that Weinstein invited her up to his room at the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what she thought would be a professional meeting.\n\nPaltrow told the Times that the meeting ended with Weinstein touching her and suggesting they massage each other. \"I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,\" she said.\n\nPaltrow said she refused Weinstein's advances. She told her boyfriend at the time, Brad Pitt, about what happened. After Pitt confronted Weinstein, Weinstein told Paltrow not to tell anyone else about the incident, she recounted to the Times. \"I thought he was going to fire me,\" Paltrow said. Pitt confirmed this story to the Times in an email.\n\nPaltrow, however, continued to appear in Weinstein movies. In 1998, Paltrow won the Oscar for best actress for her work in \"Shakespeare in Love,\" which Weinstein produced, and she thanked Weinstein in her speech.\n\nPaltrow told the Times that she felt like she had to keep up appearances to save her career. \"He was alternately generous and supportive and championing, and punitive and bullying,\" she said.\n\nKate Beckinsale\n\nIn an Instagram post, the \"Underworld\" actress shared her alleged encounter with Weinstein.\n\nBeckinsale wrote that when she was just 17 years old, she met Weinstein at a hotel. She assumed they would be meeting in a conference room, but Weinstein had her meet him in his hotel room, according to Beckinsale. He opened the door in a bathrobe, she wrote.\n\n\"I was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him. After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.\"\n\nBeckinsale wrote that Weinstein did not touch her that day. But years later, she says she saw him again and he asked her about it:\n\n\"A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realized he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not. I had what I thought were boundaries — I said no to him professionally many times over the years, some of which ended up with him screaming at me calling me a c--- and making threats, some of which made him laughingly tell people, 'Kate lives to say no to me.'\"\n\nLéa Seydoux\n\nThe actress who's starred in \"No Time To Die\" and \"Midnight in Paris\" published a revealing essay in The Guardian, depicting her experiences with Weinstein.\n\n\"When I first met Harvey Weinstein, it didn't take me long to figure him out,\" Seydoux wrote. \"We were at a fashion show. He was charming, funny, smart – but very domineering. He wanted to meet me for drinks and insisted we had to make an appointment that very night. This was never going to be about work. He had other intentions – I could see that very clearly.\"\n\nSeydoux said that she went up to his hotel room for a drink.\n\n\"We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him. I left his room, thoroughly disgusted. I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.\"\n\nSeydoux also wrote that she's heard him say misogynistic things to her, including bragging about his sexual experiences with famous actresses, and that one time he told her, \"You'd be better if you lost weight.\"\n\nLupita Nyong'o\n\nThe \"12 years a Slave\" and \"Black Panther\" star told The New York Times that she had two problematic meetings with Weinstein.\n\nThe first meeting was at Weinstein's home for a movie screening, where she says he tried to get her to lay down for a massage. Uncomfortable with the proposition, she offered to give him one instead.\n\n\"It would allow me to be in control physically, to know exactly where his hands were at all times,\" she told the Times.\n\nThe second encounter Nyong'o describes is of a private dinner, when she said Weinstein tried to get her to come up to his room.\n\n\"I was stunned. I told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so naïve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing,\" Nyong'o recalled.\n\nNyong'o said she politely declined and Weinstein told her: \"You have no idea what you are passing up.\"\n\nHeather Graham\n\nIn a guest column for Variety, the \"Boogie Nights\" star came forward with her personal experience with Weinstein in the early 2000s. Graham wrote that Weinstein implied she had to sleep with him in order to get a role in one of his movies:\n\n\"There was a pile of scripts sitting on his desk. 'I want to put you in one of my movies,' he said and offered to let me choose which one I liked best. Later in the conversation, he mentioned that he had an agreement with his wife. He could sleep with whomever he wanted when he was out of town. I walked out of the meeting feeling uneasy. There was no explicit mention that to star in one of those films I had to sleep with him, but the subtext was there.\"\n\nGraham had the opportunity to meet with Weinstein again, but didn't because she was uncomfortable, she wrote. He never cast her in any of his films.\n\n\"My hope,\" Graham wrote in Variety, \"is that this moment starts a dialogue on redefining sexual harassment in the workplace and empowers women to speak out when they feel uncomfortable in a situation. I hope that dialogue covers the gray areas where we ask ourselves, 'Did what I think happen just happen?' and that we are no longer shamed into feeling that we should grow a thicker skin, or that our story 'isn't good enough to count.'\"\n\nCara Delevigne\n\nIn a statement sent to journalist Yashar Ali, actress and model Cara Delevigne shared her experience with Weinstein. Delevigne also shared her story on Instagram:\n\n\"When I first started to work as an actress, I was working on a film and I received a call from‎ Harvey Weinstein asking if I had slept with any of the women I was seen out with in the media. It was a very odd and uncomfortable call....I answered none of his questions and hurried off the phone but before I hung up, he said to me that if I was gay or decided to be with a woman especially in public that I'd never get the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress in Hollywood. A year or two later, I went to a meeting with him in the lobby of a hotel with a director about an upcoming film. The director left the meeting and Harvey asked me to stay and chat with him. As soon as we were alone he began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers and spoke about other inappropriate things of a sexual nature. He then invited me to his room. I quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn't and wouldn't be for a bit and I should go to his room. At that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn't want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. He asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing....I thought it would make the situation better....more professional....like an audition....I was so nervous. After singing I said again that I had to leave. He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room. I still got the part for the film and always thought that he gave it to me because of what happened. Since then I felt awful that I did the movie. I felt like I didn't deserve the part. I was so hesitant about speaking out....I didn't want to hurt his family. I felt guilty as if I did something wrong. I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear.\"\n\nMira Sorvino\n\nMira Sorvino told The New Yorker that Weinstein tried to give her massage in a hotel room at the 1995 Toronto Film Festival, where she was promoting her movie \"Mighty Aphrodite.\"\n\n\"He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable,\" Sorvino told The New Yorker. \"And then [he] tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around.\"\n\nWeeks later, Weinstein showed up late at night to her New York City apartment, she said, so she called a guy friend to come to her place and pretend to be her boyfriend to scare Weinstein off. She told The New Yorker that Weinstein showed up before her friend, and when she told him her \"boyfriend\" was coming over, he got angry and left.\n\nSorvino told The New Yorker that she struggled for years whether to come forward with her story, in fear that her career in film could be ruined, especially because Weinstein helped her career so much. \"I have great respect for Harvey as an artist,\" Sorvino said, \"and owe him and his brother a debt of gratitude for the early success in my career, including the Oscar.\"\n\nSorvino appeared in other Weinstein films after the incident, and remains close friends with his brother, Bob Weinstein. Sorvino told The New Yorker that she never told Bob about Harvey's actions.\n\nRosanna Arquette\n\nArquette told The New Yorker and The New York Times that one evening in the early 90s, she was supposed to meet Weinstein at the Beverly Hills Hotel to pick up a script. Once she got to the hotel, she was asked to meet Weinstein in his room.\n\nArquette said that Weinstein opened the door wearing a white bathrobe, and told her his neck was sore and he needed a massage. She told him that she could recommend a good masseuse. \"Then he grabbed my hand,\" she said, and put it on his neck. She said that when she yanked her hand away, Weinstein grabbed it again and pulled it toward his visible and erect penis. \"My heart was really racing. I was in a fight-or-flight moment,\" Arquette said. She recalls telling Weinstein, \"I will never do that.\"\n\nArquette said that Weinstein told her that rejecting him was huge mistake, and believes her career suffered in the aftermath. \"He made things very difficult for me for years,\" Arquette told The New Yorker. She appeared in one Weinstein film after the incident, \"Pulp Fiction,\" and told The New Yorker she got the role due to Weinstein's deference to the film's director, Quentin Tarantino.\n\nLauren O'Connor\n\nAccording to The New York Times, O'Connor, now an executive at Amazon Studios and a former employee at The Weinstein Company, filed an internal memo about Weinstein's behavior in 2015. O'Connor wrote in the letter that she thought Weinstein used female employees to facilitate liaisons with \"vulnerable women.\"\n\n\"There is a toxic environment for women at this company,\" O'Connor said in the letter, addressed to several executives at the company. \"I am a 28-year-old woman trying to make a living and a career. Harvey Weinstein is a 64-year-old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10. I am a professional and have tried to be professional. I am not treated that way however. I am sexualized and diminished. \"\n\nIn the letter, O'Connor also explained how upset she was by what she witnessed as an employee at The Weinstein Company. \"I am just starting out in my career, and have been and remain fearful about speaking up,\" O'Connor wrote in the memo. \"But remaining silent is causing me great distress.\"\n\nEmma de Caunes\n\nThe French actress told The New Yorker that she met Weinstein at a party at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. A few months later, he invited her to a lunch meeting at the Hôtel Ritz in Paris, she said.\n\nShe told The New Yorker that Weinstein told her about a film he was producing based on a book with a strong female role. He couldn't remember the title of the book, but he said he had a copy upstairs in his room.\n\nWeinstein pleaded with her and she eventually agreed to go up to his room to get the book, she said. She didn't want to go up, since she was running late for work. She said that she got a work call on the way to the room, and Weinstein went into the bathroom but he left the door open. De Caunes says that she assumed he was just washing his hands.\n\n\"When I hung up the phone, I heard the shower go on in the bathroom,\" de Caunes told The New Yorker. \"I was, like, What the f---, is he taking a shower?\" Weinstein came out, de Caunes said, naked and with an erection.\n\nWeinstein then told her to lie on the bed and mentioned that many other women had done so before her, she said. According to De Caunes, she told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. De Caunes said that Weinstein called her non-stop over the next few hours, offering gifts and saying that nothing happened.\n\n\"I know that everybody—I mean everybody—in Hollywood knows that it's happening,\" de Caunes told The New Yorker. \"He's not even really hiding. I mean, the way he does it, so many people are involved and see what's happening. But everyone's too scared to say anything.\"\n\nJessica Barth\n\nThe actress told The New Yorker that she met Weinstein at a 2011 Golden Globes party.\n\nShe said Weinstein invited her to have a business meeting to discuss \"career stuff\" at the Peninsula hotel. When he arrived, Barth says he asked her to come up to his room, and told her it wasn't a big deal, he just wanted privacy.\n\nBarth said she was shocked when she arrived in the room to see that Weinstein had ordered champagne and sushi.\n\nBarth told The New Yorker that he then offered to cast her in a film and demanded a naked massage in bed. \"So, what would happen if, say, we're having some champagne and I take my clothes off and you give me a massage?\" he asked, according to Barth. \"And I'm, like, 'That's not going to happen.'\"\n\nWhen she tried to leave, she said Weinstein got angry and told her that she needed to lose weight \"to compete with Mila Kunis,\" before promising her a meeting with one of his female executives. \"He gave me her number, and I walked out and I started bawling,\" Barth said.\n\nBarth told the publication that the meeting with the female executive was just a formality. \"I just knew it was bulls---,\" she said.\n\nClaire Forlani\n\nThe \"Meet Joe Black\" actress shared her story about Weinstein in a tweet. \"I had two Peninsula Hotel meetings in the evening with Harvey and all I remember was I ducked, dived and ultimately got out of there,\" Forlani wrote.\n\nForlani also said that she was contacted by Ronan Farrow to participate in his New Yorker article about Weinstein, but was convinced not talk to him to by some of her male friends.\n\n\"You see, nothing happened to me with Harvey — by that I mean, I escaped 5 times,\" Forlani wrote. \"The three dinners with Harvey I don't really remember the time period, I was 25. I remember him telling me all the actresses who had slept with him and what he had done for them. I wasn't drinking the cool aid, I knew Harvey was a master manipulator. He also announced to me at the last dinner I had with him at Dominic's that his pilot knew to be on standby because he could never get me to sleep with him, to which I did what I always did, make light of the situation, a joke here or there and moved on. You see, I always thought I was a pro at handling these guys, I'd had a fair amount of experience. Sometimes I got angry, really angry. I wondered why I had Prey stamped on my forehead but this I kept to myself.\"\n\nBut Weinstein isn't the only one who's guilty of this, according to Forlani.\n\n\"This sort of thing was something my generation dealt with, all the time,\" she wrote. \"For me it started at age 14, my parents had two male friends who I trusted and adored and they were deeply inappropriate. It happened all the time when I modeled and it happened all through my twenties in the film business. For us it was something you weren't supposed to make a big deal out of; it was sadly our normal.\"\n\nYou can see Forlani's tweet below:\n\nMinka Kelly\n\nThe \"Parenthood\" and \"Friday Night Lights\" actress opened up about her alleged encounter with Weinstein on Instagram. Kelly said that Weinstein expressed interest in casting her in his films.\n\n\"[Weinstein] regaled me with offers of a lavish life filled with trips around the world on private planes etc. IF I would be his girlfriend. Or, 'We could just keep this professional.' All I knew was not to offend this very powerful man and to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. I told him while flattered, I'd like to keep things professional. He said 'Fine. I trust you won't tell anyone about this.' I said 'Of course not. Thank you so much for taking the time to meet with me,' – the only way I could think to shut it down gracefully and excuse myself.\"\n\nKelly also wrote, \"I immediately told my agent what happened. We marveled at his audacity, reinforced my instinct not to offend him & laughed at how glad I was to get out of there. Neither of us were that surprised as this wasn't far off from the day-to-day bulls–t of being an actress.\"\n\nAnd Kelly also apologized for keeping quiet. \"\"I'm sorry for obliging his orders to be complicit in protecting his behavior, which he obviously knew was wrong or he wouldn't have asked me not to tell anyone in the first place,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nAmbra Battilana Gutierrez\n\nThe New Yorker wrote that Weinstein allegedly groped the Italian model's breasts and reached under her skirt in March 2015. She was a finalist in the Miss Italy contest, and reportedly met Weinstein at a reception for \"New York Spring Spectacular,\" a show that he produced.\n\nAfter they met, Weinstein reportedly expressed interest in a business meeting. During their meeting, Gutierrez said that Weinstein groped her breasts after asking if they were real, and put his hand up her skirt.\n\nInstead of meeting Weinstein at a play that night, Gutierrez went to the NYPD. Investigators from the Special Victims Division had Gutierrez meet Weinstein the following day, wearing a wire.\n\nIn the recording, which you can listen to here, Weinstein lists actresses whose careers he has helped. He pressures Gutierrez to join him in his hotel room. Gutierrez says no repeatedly but Weinstein insists. In the recording, Gutierrez asks him why he groped her the day before.\n\n\"Oh, please, I'm sorry, just come on in,\" Weinstein says. \"I'm used to that. Come on. Please.\"\n\n\"You're used to that?\" Gutierrez says.\n\n\"Yes,\" Weinstein says. \"I won't do it again.\"\n\nAfter nearly two minutes of back-and-forth, Weinstein finally agrees to let her leave.\n\nWhen Gutierrez returned downstairs, detectives took Weinstein away for questioning. After a two-week investigation, the Manhattan district attorney decided not to file charges.\n\nAfter her story was published in The New Yorker, the model shared this photo on Instagram:\n\nLucia Evans\n\nEvans told The New Yorker that she gave Weinstein her number in 2004 when she was an aspiring actress and college student. She told the magazine that Weinstein started calling her late at night asking to meet, all offers she declined.\n\nShe eventually met Weinstein at the Miramax office in New York City during the day, knowing there would be a woman present. After both demeaning her and complimenting her (he told her she should lose weight) Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him, according to Evans.\n\n\"I said, over and over, 'I don't want to do this, stop, don't,'\" Stoller told The New Yorker. \"I tried to get away, but maybe I didn't try hard enough. I didn't want to kick him or fight him. He's a big guy. He overpowered me. I just sort of gave up. That's the most horrible part of it, and that's why he's been able to do this for so long to so many women: People give up, and then they feel like it's their fault.\"\n\nEmily Nestor\n\nIn December 2014, Nestor worked as a temporary front desk assistant at The Weinstein Company.\n\nOn her first day, Nestor told The New Yorker, two employees at the company told her that she was Weinstein's \"type.\" When Weinstein arrived at the office, he made comments about her appearance, referring to her as \"the pretty girl,\" she said.\n\nNestor agreed to a private meeting during the day, after Weinstein had requested to get drinks in the evening, she said. Nestor says she met Weinstein at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills.\n\nWeinstein offered her career help, and then he began to brag about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses, according to Nestor. \"He said, 'You know, we could have a lot of fun,'\" Nestor told The New Yorker. \"I could put you in my London office, and you could work there and you could be my girlfriend.\" She says she said no, and Weinstein replied that \"Oh, the girls always say no. You know, 'No, no.' And then they have a beer or two and then they're throwing themselves at me.\"\n\nWeinstein also told her that \"he'd never had to do anything like Bill Cosby,\" according to Nestor.\n\n\"I was very afraid of him,\" Nestor told The New Yorker. \"And I knew how well-connected he was. And how if I pissed him off then I could never have a career in that industry.\"\n\nNestor told the friend who helped her get the job about what happened, and he filed a complaint to HR. Nestor told The New Yorker that she talked company officials about Weinstein's actions, but didn't pursue it any further.\n\nLiza Campbell\n\nThe British writer told The Sun Times that Weinstein was helping her get a job as a freelance script reader in the 90s. He met with her in a London hotel room and asked her to bathe with him, she said.\n\n\"He sat down, chatted for a few minutes and then excused himself and left the room through a far door, where I could see a short passage that connected to the bedroom and the bathroom. I assumed he had gone for a pee,\" Campbell said. \"I could hear him moving around and suddenly the sound of bath taps running. 'What do you say we both jump in the bath?' he hollered. I could hear the thump of shoes being taken off and felt shocked that the meeting had turned sleazy.\"\n\nCampbell told the Sun Times that Weinstein kept provoking her, \"Come on, it'll be fun,\" he said. \"We can drink champagne. You can soap me.\"\n\n\"What I said very loudly was, 'If you come back into this room with no clothes on I'm going to f—ing lose my temper,'\" Campbell told the Sun Times.\n\nCampbell tried to leave the hotel room, but the door she entered in was locked, she said, and a second door she thought could be her escape was also locked. She found a third door, which opened and she escaped the room, she told the Sun Times.\n\nTomi-Ann Roberts\n\nIn 1984, Tomi-Ann Roberts, now a psychology professor at Colorado College, was a 20-year-old college student interested in pursuing an acting career. Roberts told The New York Times that Weinstein was a regular customer at the restaurant where she worked as a waitress.\n\nRoberts said that Weinstein wanted her to audition for a movie he was directing with his brother, Bob. Weinstein had her meet him where he was staying, according to Roberts. When she got there, Roberts said he was nude in a bathtub.\n\nWeinstein reportedly told her that if she was comfortable getting naked in front of him, she would have a better chance at landing the role. Roberts told the Times that Weinstein said that if she couldn't get naked in private, she would never have a career in film.\n\nRoberts recalled apologizing to Weinstein on her way out for being too uptight to take off her clothes in front of him. Later, Roberts remembers feeling manipulated since Weinstein had clearly been pretending to be interested in her professionally, she said.\n\n\"I was nobody! How had I ever thought otherwise?\" she said to the Times.\n\nDawn Dunning\n\nDunning met Weinstein in 2003. She was going to design school, working as a waitress, and taking small acting gigs. She met Weinstein at the nightclub where she worked, according to her interview with The New York Times.\n\nDunning reportedly had a lunch scheduled with Weinstein at a Manhattan restaurant. But when she got there, she was told to meet him in his hotel room because he was running late, according to Dunning.\n\nWhen she got to the room, Weinstein was in a bathrobe, behind a coffee table covered with papers, she said.\n\nDunning told The Times that Weinstein told her the papers were contracts for his next three films, but she could only sign them if she had a threesome with him.\n\nDunning recalled laughing, assuming it was a joke, which made Weinstein angry.\n\n\"You'll never make it in this business,\" Dunning said he told her. \"This is how the business works.\" Dunning left the room, and when Weinstein's assistant called her the next day, she says she hung up.\n\nDunning didn't pursue acting much longer, and instead became a costume designer.\n\nZoe Brock\n\nBrock, a model and writer from New Zealand, wrote in a blog post and told The Guardian that Weinstein sexually harassed her in 1997, when she was 23 years old.\n\nBrock, now 43, said that she met Weinstein at the Cannes film festival, and sat with him at a dinner. They had a nice conversation, she recalled, and she joined Weinstein and a large group of people for a night out.\n\nAfter midnight, Weinstein reportedly offered to drive her back to his hotel to continue the partying. At the hotel, with several other people in the room, she says they opened champagne, but then the other people left.\n\n\"My body went into high alert. I was drunk, young, miles from home, without cash to get a cab, and no cell phone,\" she said. \"Harvey left the room, but not for long. He re-emerged naked a couple of minutes later and asked if I would give him a massage. Panicking, in shock, I remember weighing up the options and wondering how much I needed to placate him to keep myself safe.\"\n\nBrock said that Weinstein begged her to give him a massage. \"I shrugged Harvey's hands off me, ran into the bathroom and locked the door. Harvey chased me, d---, balls and all, and banged on the door with his fists, pleading with me to come out.\"\n\nWhen she exited the bathroom, Brock said Weinstein was crying and said that Brock had rejected him because he was fat.\n\n\"No one believed my story,\" Brock said. \"They all thought I had slept with Weinstein.\""
