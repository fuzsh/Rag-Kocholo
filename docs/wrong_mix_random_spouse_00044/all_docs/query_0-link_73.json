        "text": "My dear friend, the scarily talented Cathy of 746 Books, is our first guest blogger for The Royale With Cheesathon. Cathy has written a lovely piece about one of Pulp Fiction‘s supporting players, Bronagh Gallagher (Trudi, the stoner on Eric Stoltz’s couch). Gallagher was in The Commitments with Glen Hansard (hence The Frames teeshirt). Cathy has actually met her, which is cool, and which means that I know someone who knows someone who knows Quentin Tarantino.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, it means I know someone who knows someone who knows Uma Thurman. I’m not sure the heart can take this sort of thing.\n\nCathy runs the 4 Corners Music Festival, which includes all sorts of arts loveliness, and blogs about her obsession with buying books and not reading them: she is now down from 746 unread books to just about 600. She currently has a wonderful little challenge going: 20 Books of Summer. Go check it out and follow her blog. If you’re at all interested in reading, you’ll be glad.\n\nIf you’re interested in contributing to the Cheesathon, email me at ragingfluff@yahoo.ca. Attach your piece as a word document or include it in the body of the email.\n\nThat’d be Kool & the Gang\n\nAnd now, Cathy with the low-down on Trudi\n\nIt’s been twenty years since Pulp Fiction burst on to our screens, taking Quentin Tarantino in to the mainstream, re-invigorating the career of John Travolta, creating the quintessential hip soundtrack and ensuring that no-one ever again could say ‘my father’s watch’ without a knowing grin.\n\nBruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Samuel L Jackson. The cast was stellar.\n\nEven the names of the supporting cast trip easy off the tongue – Eric Stoltz, Tim Roth, Frank Whalley and Ving Rhames.\n\nBut look closely and you’ll see, in the middle of all these star names, the little Northern Irish girl that could.\n\nBronagh Gallagher.\n\nI run a Music Festival in Northern Ireland called the 4 Corners Music Festival, and have just had the privilege of booking Ms Gallagher and her band as our opening act. I can safely say that she is the nicest woman in the music business and a true star.\n\nSo let’s take a moment to celebrate Derry’s Daughter who has proved herself to be so much more than just the ‘funny looking one’ from The Commitments. She has worked on iconic movies like Star Wars and Pulp Fiction. She talked Quentin Tarantino into letting her character Trudi wear a Frames T-shirt for the shoot.\n\nBrian Eno calls her ‘one of the purest, clearest talents I know’. She has toured the world with Théâtre de Complicité and has starred in War Horse at the National Theatre in London.\n\nShe’s intelligent, funny, professional, talented and wants nothing more than ‘to be rocking it like my granny when I’m 88’.\n\nSomehow, I think she will be.\n\nCathy McNally"
