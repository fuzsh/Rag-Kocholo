        "text": "From the reviews:\n\n“Creative Economies, Creative Cities, an edited collection of articles by academics from Europe, the Far East and Australia, puts Florida’s thesis in global and historical context. The book mines a rich vein of debate that began long before 2002 about the effectiveness of the Creative Economy idea. … The book is a kind of echo chamber for academics and policy-makers … .” (Matthew J. Kiefer, ArchitectureBoston, September, 2009)\n\n“One of the most valuable aspects of Creative Economies, Creative Cities is that it identifies questions from recent years about the cultural and creative industries, a sophisticated set of policy agendas regarding the development of creative economics and creative cities. … This collection should be read by policymakers interested in design and implementation of culture-led regeneration projects.” (Chang Bin Lee, International Journal of Cultural Policy, Vol. 17 (3), June, 2011)\n\n“The book has a strong interdisciplinary approach–effectively reflecting the variety of topics and methods that characterise research in this area. … the book proves a solid contribution and some of the chapters included will become highly cited within the field. … it is the first attempt to adopt an inclusive view on the creative economy and give us a better understating of the creative economies discourses and creative city policies taking place in Asia. For this ground-breaking reason the book has to be praised.”­­­ (Roberta Comunian, Journal of Cultural Economics, Vol. 34, February, 2010)"
