The NIEHS has asked the government for $680,000,000 to support their activities. I believe the NIEHS should get the amount of money that they asked for. With the money the NIEHS will get they would be able to figure things out faster and put out awareness faster as well.

Art Inspired By The French Revolution Research Paper Art Inspired by the French Revolution 1 Art Inspired by the French Revolution UoPeople Student University of the People Art Inspired by the French Revolution 2 The French revolution began in the late 18th century. It started out quite peacefully when commoners, feeling oppressed by the Monarchy and high society, began to challenge tax reformation proposed by the King s ministers. They joined together to form a National Assembly in order to lobby for their own rights. However, within a few weeks events took for a bloodier turn.

The National Assembly had just been established and had set out to convene in order to form their own constitution. Unfortunately, as they arrived at their meeting hall they encountered royal guards and locked doors preventing their entry. Having no other choice, the deputies of the National Assembly gathered at a nearby indoor tennis court. Here, a crowd of 577 deputies took a pledge to stay together until they were able to compose and implement their own constitution. This moment can be seen in Jacques Louis David s Neoclassical drawing, The Oath of the Tennis Court (The Tennis Court Oath , n.d.). Art Inspired by the French Revolution 3 (David, 1791). The author of this momentous pledge, Emmanuel Sieyes, is in the center of the picture and stands on top of a table above the other deputies. Almost all of them are reaching towards him appearing to take the oath as he is in the process of reading it aloud. A lot of them are even clamoring on top of one another to show their dedication to the assembly s cause.\n\n5. Barbiturates Essay The Inaba text describes the phenomenon of therapeutic index. Addiction to barbiturates can be critical in terms of lethality as measured by the therapeutic index. Describe how this phenomenon might lead to an accidental overdose. Why is this factor more critical with barbiturates than with other classes of depressant drugs? Barbiturates are nonselective central nervous system (CNS) depressants, capable of producing all degrees of depression from mild sedation and hypnosis to general anesthesia, deep coma and death. The extent of CNS depression varies with the route of administration, dose and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the particular barbiturate. Patient specific factors such as age, physical or emotional state and the... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... The drug is usually sold as a white powder, either in colorful capsules, tablets, and suppositories, or dissolved in liquid for injection. Oral ingestion is usually preferred over injection, since results occur quickly enough with the short acting capsules. Some barb freaks prefer the surging rush that comes with mainlining, however, and ignore the possibilities of severe infection and abscess that may result if the vein is missed and the drug is injected under the skin. Gangrene can occur if an artery is hit, and may necessitate amputation of the affected part. Barbiturates affect the central nervous system by depressing or inhibiting nerve signals in the brain, altering chemical balance and decreasing functions of some organ systems. Heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and neurological action are all depressed, and general relaxation of the skeletal muscles occurs. Effects of the drug increase according to dosage, as body functions decelerate: from anxiety relief to sedation to hypnosis to anesthesia to coma to death. Once ingested, the drug enters the bloodstream and is distributed throughout the body, with the highest accumulation in fat deposits and organ tissues. Barbiturates are ultimately metabolized and eliminated through the kidneys and liver. Rate of effect depends on how quickly the drug = moves through the body and is metabolized. Laboratory tests can indicate the presence of barbiturates in the body. Dosage, type of barbiturate,\n\n6. Coral Reefs Essay Coral reefs are very diverse ecosystems. They are the rainforest of the sea . Coral reefs can be very big or very small. The Great Barrier Reef (Australia) is 1,600 miles long and 40 miles wide. They are very important for our ocean, they provide food and home for many of the fish in the ocean. For some fish, coralreefs are the only viable food source or shelter they have. Coral reefs are very important. Coral reefs are made by individual coral that join together to form a coral colony. Each coral is .06 to .5 inches in size.

There are different kinds of things that can damage the reefs. One of these things is when the weather changes, from cold to hot or hot to cold, it changes the sea level and temperature of it. When sea level and temperature changes it damages the coral reefs. Another thing that can harm the coral reefs are seaweed. Seaweed is a threat to corals because they grow much faster, than the seaweed starts to take over the coral reef. When there is too much nutrients in the sea, the seaweed grows much faster than usual and it take over the reef much faster. Seaweed have a chemical that damages the coral, and kills them also. The most significant threat to coral reefs is human interaction. People use coral reefs for a lot of things. They provide us with jobs, coral reefs bring in 30 billion dollars a year, the most they have ever brought in was 170 billion dollars in a year. Even though they help us so much we harm them in many different ways. Humans overfish, we pollute the ocean, and we change the ocean chemistry. These things kill the coral.

Boso fills the role of the questioner, while Anselm explains his thoughts and beliefs. He still does not really understand what he believes in and is slowly trying to put all all the pieces together. Boso asked why it was necessary for God to become human and why the son of God had to suffer.

The History of Mr. John Deere The History of Mr. John Deere I will never put my name on a product that does not have the best that is in me. This is arguably the most famous quote made by Deere and that has stuck with the company for the last 175 years. Deere was the man who kick started modern farming by inventing the first ever cast steel plow, as opposed to the much heavier cast iron plow that worked alright in the sandy soil but the fertile heavy soil of the plains would just stick too. This is how john Deere s steel plow became known as The Plow That Broke the Plains. Mr. John Deere was born in Rutland Vermont in 1804, and grew up in nearby Middlebury. Deere was just four years old when his father, William, was lost at sea and never returned leaving his mother, Sarah Deere, to raise him. Deere was not an only child, living with five brothers and sisters in a moderately poor family so there was no leftover money for education. John very rarely attended school and focused his time on work to make money to support his family. He worked for a few different people, such as farmers and shop keepers but did not stay with a job for more than a few months at a time. until age 17 when he got an offer for an apprenticeship working for a blacksmith in a town about 50 miles from home, with his mothers permission he left home to go to work learning the trade of blacksmithing.

Essay On Pulp Fiction Pulp Fiction by Quentin Tarantino has been a sensation since its release and has received numerous awards, including one for its original screenplay. The screenplay can be designated to several genres, mainly due to its intertwined plot sequence and events, but the genre Pulp Fiction conforms most to is gangster crime. The main characters of Pulp Fictionare gangsters who commit crimes and face struggle and conflict which they have to overcome. This induces obscure events, including murder and rape, which are associated with gangster crime. Quentin Tarantinohowever has cleverly made his screenplay to deviate from standard conventions in order to distinguish his screenplay from others. Pulp Fiction deviates from the conventions of the gangster... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Film gangsters are often materialistic, ruthless, immoral, maniacal and self destructive, and although the main characters Vincent and Jules murder several others, they do not fit this description. Jules and Vincent seem rather professional, partly due to their black suits. Especially Jules is very calm and professional, when Vincent accidently shoots Marvin Jules immediately thinks of possible solutions. Furthermore Tarantino also shows the human side of the characters, not only their gangster actions. Such as the dancing scene of Vincent and Mia, and Butch and Fabienne who seem to be a peaceful couple after Butch his boxing match. Another deviation is the lack of characters which attempt to stop the crimes, such as the police. In gangster crime movies it is conventional to have characters which counterwork the criminals. In Pulp Fiction Jules and Vincent do mention the fact that they could get in a lot of trouble if someone would find out about their deeds, but the police is never displayed in the story. The effect of these choices is that the gangsters are glorified and the reader can sympathise with them. The reader wants the characters to overcome their struggles, even though their actions would be concerned immoral in normal\n\n12. Main Tenets Of Confucianism Confucianism began around 2500 years ago in China as the moral and political ideologies and philosophies of Kong Fuzi, known in the west as Confucius. Confucius believed there was a mandate from Heaven that we should spend our lives seeking knowledge and self improvement not only for the benefit of ourselves, but also for society as a whole. As the individual strives to lead a life in the Confucian way, it radiates outward from self to family, friends, society, and the world in general. Confucianismis not a theistic religion as it does not have deities, but it does support ritualistic honoring of deceased ancestors and does have a concept of heaven. Confuciusis not considered a god, but one who exerts considerable influence from where he can no longer be seen. The main tenets of Confucianism include a lifelong commitment to self improvement and knowledge and the outward expression of that knowledge in honorable deeds and acts that encourage like behavior in others. At the heart of Confucianism is the concept of Ren/Jen. This translates as humaneness, or benevolence between people. It suggests that behavior toward others comes from within, or as often said, from the heart. Confucianism does not encourage people to seek solitude or isolation as a pathway to heaven like some other religions, but instead strongly encourages close societal bonds. This innate connection begins with family, the core of society. Confucius believed that humans are born with empathy and a sense of\n\n13. Jfk Medical Center Case Analysis This firm represents East Florida Division, Inc. and its affiliated facilities, specifically including JFK Medical Center (the Hospital ).

Patient B.R. was admitted via ambulance to the Hospital from January 30, 2013 through April 3, 2013 with malignant hypertension, alcohol induced dementia, agitation, and a CVA.

The timeline to appeal is inconsistently stated in two different sections of the WellCare Medicaid Provider Manual. In Section 5, the manual states that claim payment disputes must be submitted to WellCare in writing within one year of the date of the denial of the EOP. In Section 7, the Manual states that Providers have 90 calendar days from the original utilization management or claim denial to file a provider appeal. Important to both of these provisions is that the appeal time period does not commence until an EOP or claim denial is received by the Hospital. In this case, the only written notice the Hospital appears to have received from WellCare discussing its adjustment of the claim is the April 25, 2013 ERA. The ERA, however, showed no denied charges, but instead purported (incorrectly) to pay the entire claim at the contract rate. This is consistent with the verbal information provided by WellCare s representatives that the claim had not been denied. Accordingly, the appeal time period never started to run because no claim denial was sent to the Hospital, and as such, the Hospital s appeals were timely\n\n14.

Pros And Cons Of Hernan Cortes Hernan Cortes conquest of the Aztec Empire gave birth to three hundred years of Spanish rule in Mexico. Miguel Hidalgo, a Catholic priest, and leader of the independence movement united: indigenous peasants, poor creoles, nobility in Spanish America and the Catholic church within the colony to depose Spaniard royalist power which Cortes had given birth to (Mckay 684). This unlikely alliance stemmed from the widespread discontent of Spaniard viceroy assumption of control of the government of New Spain from its capital in MexicoCity after Napoleon s coup in 1808 (Mckay 684). The signing of Iturbide s Plan of Iguala ended eleven years of struggle for independence, and the end of Spaniard control. This plan not only established Mexico as a constitutional monarchy but as well solidified the cultural transition from the polytheism of the Aztec Empire to the strong monotheism of the newly emerging Catholic Church. Because the colonial system depended on the loyalty of the clergy: the priests controlled the people, this allowed the Catholic Church s influence to grow within the colony (Lynch 109). The separation of the Catholic Church from the Spanish crown played a vital role in the attainment of independence. Considering the separation of the Catholic Church from the Spanish crown and how the Plan de Iguala concluded the Mexican War of independence, I intend to explore: How the Catholic Church changed the Mexican War of Independence?

The managers do not experience any differences in how the employees are motivated. They mean that all employees have generally the same requirements in terms of how a workplace and leadership must be to be as good as possible regarding motivation, inspiration and engagement. However, based on the analysis, it is clearly up to the individual. No individual is the same, and that needs to take into consideration when talking about motivation and performance. The first drive, the biological drive that comes from within, is most often taken for granted. It can be argued that mangers should take this drive more seriously and take it into account when motivating their employees. A manager needs to observe the individual and their individual needs. By doing so, the managers might get a self played piano with self motivated employees. Nadeem Malik (2010) expressed that there were times when workers were thought to be another expansion to upgrade the production of service or good. Be that as it may, a great deal has changed at this point. Motivating employee is an essential stride that each entrepreneur ought to take to succeed. This is on the grounds that motivation energizes better execution and efficiency with respect to workers. What s more, when this happens, the organization has nothing to appreciate except for advantages\n\n21. Defense Mechanisms And The First Defense Mechanism Defense Mechanisms Defense mechanisms are known as ways we protect ourselves from the feelings or things that we do not want to deal with. Defense mechanisms tend to be a way to cope with situations, from which an individual feels anxiety or stressed. Everyone uses defenses mechanisms to help them get through frustrating experiences. There are several types of defense mechanisms; the main ones that I can remember using are regression, denial, projection, repression, rationalization, and displacement. The first defense mechanism I like to uses is regression. Regression is defined as leading to the temporary or long term reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adult way. I...

Regression helps people by, when someone confronted by stressful events, they sometimes abandon coping strategies and revert to patterns of behavior used earlier in development. The second defense mechanism, I ve used is denial. Denial is simply refusing to acknowledge that an event has occurred, a person acts as if nothing has happened, behaving in ways those others may see as bizarre. In my life, I have only known one person that has past that I have cared about. When she past a couple years ago, I just did not want to believe it. I stayed up almost every night that week, trying to think that it was not real and it was only a dream. Still to this day, I try to tell myself it is not real, but reality hits me and she will always be gone. Personally I can only remember using denial as a defense mechanism once in my life, but I also had a neighbor his name was Cody he was 17 years old and he started using drugs, the changes in his behavior made it pretty obvious to anyone who know him, but Cody s parents just didn t believe. I believe that Cody s parents where in denial; because that was there baby, and they just did not want to believe that there kid would get into that kind of stuff. The third defense mechanism I have used is projection. Projection is where a person defends themselves against unpleasant impulses by denying their existence in themselves, while attributing them to others. I have been known of doing\n\n22.

Comparing Zefferelli s Film Zefferelli vs. Baz Luhrmann Shirin Shahsavari 3/10/16 Although Zefferelli s film is a better book to movie adaptation of Shakespeare s famous play, Romeo and Juliet , Baz Luhrmann s version is a lot more entertaining and comprehensible to most teenagers because of its modern setting. Perhaps, one of the most substantial visible contrasts between the two films is the setting. Zeffirelli s film takes place in a classical setting, accurately representing the actual historic period in which the play was written in. However, in Luhrmann s version the setting has been completely transformed to make the film more modern and therefore easier for the audience to understand and relate to.

During 1924 2006, a total of 13 human cases of primary pneumonic plague were documented in the United States, and greater than five were associated with cats (felids). Twelve cases of plague transmission from nondomestic carnivores to humans have been documented, including a fatal case of human pneumonic plague in 2007 that resulted from direct contact with an infected puma (Puma concolor). The lesions of the orally infected cats were consistent with those previously described for naturally occurring Y. pestis infections in cats and corroborate the contention that cats most commonly contract plague by eating Y. pestis infected rodents and not via flea bite. The histopathology of Y. pestis disease in these cats is comparable to that described for human plague (Eisen, et. a, 2008). Although there are historic suggestions of cats being susceptible to plague, it was not until the latter part of the 1900s that plague was recognized as a significant disease. It was then recognized that infected cats could serve as a threat to human health. Cats are considered rare among carnivores in that they are unusually susceptible to disease after Y. pestis exposure. In 1999, a total of 42 plague cases in cats (Felis cattus) were confirmed from the three states where plague is most common: California (7), Colorado (9), and New Mexico (26) (Watson, et. al, 2001).

Achebe says that Africa is used only as a setting for the book and that Conrad dehumanizes Africa itself. Hawkins agrees with Achebe that Heart of Darkness dehumanizes not only the citizens but also Africa itself. Achebe also argues that Conrad himself is a bloody racist, but Hawkins argues that Conrad just writes what Marlow experienced. Hawkins argues that Conrad had limited knowledge about what happened in Africa that he came across as a racist. It is also said that Conrad lived in a time when racism was so common that the word did not exist.

School Uniforms Should Be Abolished The wearing of school uniforms is increasingly popular across the nation. It becomes a controversial argument of communities rejecting these mandated school uniforms in their schools. However, school uniforms are not a negative thing; in fact, they could be positive in many ways by eliminating cliques, saving money for parents, and taking away the bullying off students less fortunate; whereas, school uniforms will also violate students freedom of expression, create a financial burden on families, and uniforms will not alleviate the problems such as higher academic rates, attendance, etc. However, with a solution that would benefit both parties, the public school systems in the Oklahoma City district would benefit greatly if this policy were adopted in all the schools since the district only has seventy four public schools with uniforms, while seventeen schools are not. First of all, these school uniforms should be implemented in the rest of these seventeen schools, because they would diminish economic and social barriers between students. For instance, people come from different social classes such as Upper, Middle, and Lower class. Many lower class families often cannot afford to purchase non essential items for their children, especially for school; many struggle just to purchase the necessity items such as food, housing, transportation, etc. According to the Oklahoma City Board of Education, if families are not able to afford school uniforms, there are ways can help\n\n33.

Ermanno Sangiorgi was the police chief in Palermo at the time and he wrote an extensive report on the mafia of Sicily between 1898 1900 that would be the basis for the arrest and trial of 89 mafia members, among them Antonino Giammona. However, due to the political landscape at the time, most were released and only 32 criminals were convicted of belonging to a criminal network, i.e. the mafia. One of the people which Dickie points his fingers to as a possible villain in the story is Vincenzo Cosenza, the chief prosecutor (Dickie 2004). Cosenza had written to the new Minister of the Interior and declared, During the course of performing my duties I have never noticed the mafia (Dickie, p110, 2004). This reveals a disturbing fact concerning the relationship between the mafia and the Italian state, namely that the mafia had already gained ground in the politics of the state and that the notion of the non existing mafia became a leading viewpoint in Italian politics. The reason to why this claim hold some validation is that the politicians, or higher ups, such as a prosecutor, managed to influence a police case to the extent that leading Mafioso s such as Antonino Giammona was released and could resume their\n\n34.

Causes Of The Harlem Renaissance The Harlem Renaissance was an important national movement with connections to international developments in art and culture in the African American culture (Wintz). The movement also known as the Jazz Age , started on different dates depending on the viewer s interpretation of the Harlem Renaissance. For instance, if your interpretation of the Harlem Renaissance is literature, then it began in the year 1924. However, most people associate the year 1920 with the creation of the Harlem Renaissance. The Great Migration was one major start to the Harlem Renaissance due to the movement of African Americans from the South to Harlem. The Great Migration was caused by racial discrimination against African Americans as well as slavery. There were racial groups such as the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) that used violence against African Americans to prove a point. Not only were the KKK the cause of the Great Migration but as well as the wanting of improvement in lifestyle. Harlem provided the African Americans the opportunity to receive a better paying job to support their families as well as superior education. As we all know, African Americans did not have an easy life in the South as a result of slavery and segregation. As a result, many African Americans saw Harlem in New York as an opportunity to improve their family s lifestyles along with their own. This led to the development of African American culture, such as jazzmusic, art and literature. For instance, Chick Webbreflects the ideas, values and contributions of the Harlem Renaissance through his accomplishments and musical influence. William Henry Webb was a famous swing era jazz drummer and bandleader, however; he did face many challenges to accomplish his goal. William Henry Webb was born in Baltimore, Maryland with spinal tuberculosis. Spinal tuberculosis affects the spinal vertebrates, which causes the individual to have a lump in their back and prevent them from growing like a normal human being. As a result, William Henry Webb was given the nickname Chick Webb. In addition, his date of birth is unclear due to the lack of documentation during his birth.

This highlights the importance of company s operating cash flow, which may well be a more realistic indication of a company s financial viability (Teen, 2012). The question of cash flow is especially relevant, when it is taken into account how many companies have met their downfall, having recorded a profit, while having operating cash flow problems (Teen, 2012). Eddy Groves and other ABC directors attempts to hide or temporarily alleviate the cash flow problems by the practice of pledging their shares to borrow money, or disguising payments from developers as profits from subsidised loss making centres only served to exacerbate the problem (Kruger, 2009; Teen, 2012). In the case of share pledging for example, where shares were sold amounting to 5.6 percent of the company, the share price was lowered further due to a glut of shares on the market (Teen, 2012). Several ABC s lenders were leading banks, as it became apparent the company was in trouble ABC attempted to renegotiate loan agreements with the banking syndicate however, the recovery scheme was rejected by the bankers (Teen, 2012).This is quite understandable because, as Teen (2012) points out intangiable assets are quite often viewed as having little or no value when a company is in difficulty.

I saw my mom dig the box in the dirt of our garden. I was puzzled as to why she chose to hide the gold outside, but didn t think too much of it at the time. I wore my blue noise blocking headphones everywhere. They were far too large for my head, but I was four and I thought that not hearing the gunshots, helicopters, and explosions meant that life was still normal.

Mark O Rowe is a playwright and screenwriter from Ireland. He is best known for writing Howie and the Rookie in 1999. Terminus is one of his newer plays, having only been in production for eight years. I plan on adapting Terminus for a new stage production. Some of the plot will be changed, however the majority of it will stay the same. I have a cast planned as well as many ideas for staging, set design, and costumes. Terminus premiered in 2007 at the Abbey Theatre. It received rave reviews, and traveled around the world.
