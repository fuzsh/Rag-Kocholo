        "text": "Turkish drama Aleph sees two detectives pursue a serial killer via a set of mysterious clues linked to the country’s past. Producer Metin Alihan Yalçındağ and director Emir Alper reveal how they pieced the series together.\n\nDescribed as a mystical crime series, eight-part Turkish drama Aleph drew record ratings when it first aired locally on FX and BluTV. Starring Kenan Imirzalioglu (Ezel), Ahmet Mumtaz Taylan and Melisa Sozen, the story revolves around two detectives as they investigate a spate of murders in Istanbul, beginning with the discovery of a body in the Bosphorus.\n\nDetectives Kemal (Imirzalioglu) and Settar (Taylan) pursue a serial killer who leaves a series of clues, sending them on a quest laced with traces of Ottoman and Islamic history. Key to solving the murder mystery is Yaşar Görener (Sozen), an Islamic history professor and daughter of a renowned mystical Sufi sheikh, who also sparks a romantic connection with Kemal.\n\nCreated by Emre Kayiş and directed by Emin Alper (Tepenin Ardi, Kiz Kardesler), Aleph is produced by May Productions and distributed by Global Agency, which has already sold the series to Achla TV in Israel.\n\nHere, director Alper and May Productions’ Metin Alihan Yalçındağ tell DQ about developing the series with two broadcasters, filming in more than 70 locations across Istanbul and why it stands out among other Turkish series finding new audiences overseas.\n\nWhat attracted you to Aleph?\n\nYalçındağ: The script. This was my first big production, and honestly it wasn’t the kind of story I would have dreamt of as my first big project. However, the script was so good that it led me to work with amazing people like our director, Emin Alper, and amazing actors such as Kenan Imirzalioglu, Ahmet Mumtaz Taylan and Melisa Sozen. Besides the script, the appeal was working together with this amazing cast and crew.\n\nHow was the series developed with the broadcaster?\n\nYalçındağ: The script came to me from BluTV, which then partnered with FX Turkey. I attached the director and started working on the script, which we led on with comments from the broadcasters. However, they didn’t force them upon us; they let the creative work flow. Things got a little bit harder during editing. There were several voices involved, as there were two broadcasters at the table. But, overall, what I learned was arguing a lot beforehand about what the project is supposed to be is the best way to keep it as it should be in the end.\n\nHow did you cast the actors?\n\nYalçındağ: Very simply, with the script. The script had the director very excited and the director made all the actors very excited. They all wanted a chance to work with him, as he is one of the most important European directors of our time.\n\nEmin, how did you join the project?\n\nAlper: One day, my friend Emre Kayiş, the writer of Aleph, called me and asked if I was interested in shooting a serial for a digital platform [BluTV]. As I give special importance to digital platforms, which leave the creators and directors a free space to develop their creativity, I said yes. Of course, beyond that, the content of the project attracted me as a director. When Emre told me the general framework of the story, I found it intriguing. Then I met with the producers, Alihan Yalçındağ and Mehmet Altıoklar, and I had a very creative dialogue with them.\n\nHow did you work with Emre to develop the scripts?\n\nAlper: After Emre wrote each episode, he, the producers and I came together to discuss the script and give feedback. He then went back to writing and made revisions. After he finished all the episodes, we held longer meetings and reviewed the whole script, and then he made the final revisions.\n\nWhat kind of visual style did you create for the series?\n\nAlper: The reference phrases for us were ‘Anatolian gothic’ and ‘Anatolian noir.’ I wanted to emphasise the gothic elements of the Anatolian/Islamic tradition and combine these with the film noir elements of detective stories. We used darkness to increase the mystical and dramatic tones of the story.\n\nAnother visual aim was to elevate the melancholic beauty of Istanbul. The locations were quite rich and we tried to capture them at their gloomiest. The colour palette created a slightly retro effect that reveals the nostalgic perspective of our characters.\n\nHow do you work with the actors on set?\n\nAlper: All the actors are great talents – I was really lucky in that sense. We did rehearsals before filming and discussed the characters, so almost everything was set before shooting. I just did the fine-tuning with them during production.\n\nWhere was the series filmed and how are locations used in the story?\n\nYalçındağ: Istanbul, the most beautiful city, full of history and stories, is actually a sort of character in Aleph. We shot in 74 real locations around the city, creating the feeling that the city is a living thing. Together with our characters and the story, the city itself also touches your emotions.\n\nWhat was it like filming the series?\n\nAlper: It was exhausting. It was like shooting four feature films in the timeframe of two feature films. Apart from that, it was exciting. I shot scenes [unlike any I have ever] shot in my films. I also worked with production facilities that I cannot get for my own arthouse films, so it was an enriching experience.\n\nWhat were the biggest challenges in making the show?\n\nYalçındağ: Firstly, the budget. The show was too big for BluTV, so they partnered with FX Turkey. This was the first local production from FX Turkey, so with two broadcasters lined up, the biggest challenge was the content. With an arthouse director like Emin and a TV channel like FX beside OTT platform BluTV, the visual style of the show had to stand on a very delicate line. This taught all of us a lot during the process. On a more practical note, shooting in 74 different locations in a metropolis like Istanbul was the most challenging physical aspect.\n\nAlper: There were quite difficult scenes, with some taking two days to shoot. These scenes needed meticulous scheduling, very intense production designing and careful managing of the extras, who numbered more than 200.\n\nTurkish drama is growing around the world – how does Aleph continue that trend?\n\nYalçındağ: Honestly, the Turkish drama that is growing around the world is better described as soap operas, rather than dramas, with episodes that can last 180 minutes and stories that can stretch to more than 150 episodes.\n\nI am a dreamer who believes we can use this outreach and familiarity of our community to create more drama-like series where the stories are told in as many episodes as the story needs, and not one more. I hope with Aleph we have achieved this to some extent and we are going to keep going in that direction.\n\nAlper: Aleph is different from traditional Turkish drama in many ways. The cool handling of its subject, the melancholy of its characters – which reflects the general mood of the country – and a very intriguing subject that involves highly critical elements are just a few aspects of the project that make it new and refreshing.\n\nWe tried to elevate the story with a very delicate aesthetic touch. From the feedback I have received, the aesthetic quality of the show was appreciated by the audience. Visually, it compares to the [best] examples of series produced around the world in the last decade.\n\ntagged in: Aleph, BluTV, Emir Alper, FX, Global Agency, May Productions, Metin Alihan Yalçındağ\n\nOscar winner Regina King, fresh from directing her first feature film, shares some of the moments that have inspired her movie and television career, which includes The Leftovers, American Crime and Watchmen.\n\nFrom starting out on 1980s television comedy 227, Regina King has built an award-laden career on both the big and small screens. While early film credits include Boyz n the Hood, Friday, Jerry Maguire and Enemy of the State, in 2019 she won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Barry Jenkins’ acclaimed If Beale Street Could Talk.\n\nMore recently, however, she has mostly been seen on television, taking roles in shows ranging from Leap of Faith, 24, Southland and The Boondocks to The Leftovers, American Crime, Seven Seconds and The Big Bang Theory. Last year she collected the Emmy for best lead actress in a limited series or TV movie after reteaming with The Leftovers’ creator Damon Lindelof to head the cast of HBO’s adaptation of graphic novel Watchmen.\n\nOff-screen, King has also been building her reputation as a director, helming episodes of Southland, Being Mary Jane, Scandal, Shameless, This is Us and Insecure, before last year competing her first feature film, One Night in Miami, which imagines what happened when Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown met in a hotel room in 1964.\n\nThis week, DQ heard from King as she discussed her acting career and journey to becoming a director as part of a Bafta Masterclass.\n\nHaving worked with writer/director John Singleton on 1991’s Boyz n the Hood, she saw his creative process up-close on 1993’s Poetic Justice, in which she starred with Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur.\n\nI just had so many questions. My excitement and the depth of my questions inspired him to open up his entire preparation process for me and up until that time, I did not realise all that entails when you’re a director to get to the moment where I’m actually spending time with directors as the actor.\n\nI was able to see his storyboards, and him putting the storyboards together, and watching some films with him that inspired him or that were inspiration for Poetic Justice. I was able to hear him having conversations and deciding what department heads would be coming on board for a couple of positions he hadn’t yet hired. I was just fascinated and blown away, but I can’t say in that moment I was feeling like, ‘I’m going to do this.’ My respect levels for the director definitely moved up a notch or two.\n\nBecoming a director isn’t about “vanity” but comes from King’s ambition to be more deeply involved in the storytelling process.\n\nYou want to have more control of the aesthetic, the tone and the story you’re telling and you’re able to do that as a director. As actors, once we make that discovery on a conscious level, we are ready to actively pursue it. One of the things I’ve learned along the way speaking to directors who are veterans is that nervous energy we feel [when a film is being released], they still feel that to this day, even after having done several films. I still get nervous that first day of work. You’ve got to get all that nervous energy out and I feel like if I didn’t feel nervous on my first day or on a particularly big scene, I should probably be even more nervous because that means it doesn’t mean that much to me.\n\nKing’s directing education came not just from directors she has worked with, but other crew members as well.\n\nOnce I really understood the process that doesn’t involve me as an actor, I was spending more time with the production designer and in the art department during times I wasn’t shooting. I would have in depth conversations with the prop master. All of those things were part of my education along the way. The conversations I’ve had with other crew members outside of the director that were as impactful as the directors were with the camera operators.\n\nKing has identified a time around 2010 where the projects she was acting in began to speak to social issues facing the US.\n\nI don’t think I was aware that was happening until Watchmen. I looked back at everything – from Southland to American Crime to If Beale Street Could Talk and Seven Seconds – and all these stories I was a part of, these storytellers I was collaborating with, our values and our feeling it was necessary to tell these types of stories were aligning. This space I’ve been in and the circumstances that have taken place in my life have led me to these choices. I feel like this film, One Night in Miami, also speaks to that: what does social responsibility look like for you as an artist? Maybe 10 years ago it started becoming more clear to me about my personal journey and using my voice when it comes to social responsibility.\n\nThe actor also seeks true collaborators to work with in film and television.\n\nWhen I think about projects I’ve done early in my career that did not feel as much like a collaborative process as the projects I’ve done in the past 10-plus years, I realise the first time I had that experience on a conscious level was Southland. Within that experience, I remember saying I really don’t want to be a part of a project if it doesn’t feel collaborative or if it doesn’t feel like a space where everyone involved feels like they can take ownership in it in some way. At the beginning of the journey with One Night in Miami, I had to audition for the role of director, and as they’re auditioning me, I’m auditioning them – do they feel like a collaborative team? Within that hour of us meeting, I immediately felt like I can work with these people every day and I know they will be great support system as we move forward.\n\nWorking with Barry Jenkins on If Beale Street Could Talk, King was struck by his attention to detail and the importance of creating moments not written down in the script.\n\nOne of the big things I was able to take away from Beale Street is Barry’s attention to detail in the nuanced, subtle moments. Seeing the final product, it really helped me to understand how much those moments make the entire project sing and while those moments are not the moments on paper, those are the moments Barry created that are the difference between loving [King’s character] Sharon and Joe [Colman Domingo] a little bit more than if you were just doing what was on the page. Taking that away from that experience, I was able to infuse moments like that in One Night in Miami, and without a doubt, if I had not had that experience with Barry, I know I would not have been sensitive to the idea that moments like this are absolutely necessary to the story.\n\nWith British actor Kingsley Ben-Adir playing Malcolm X in One Night in Miami, King is an advocate for choosing the best actor for the part, no matter where they come from.\n\nI feel like the best actor for the role should play the part, the actor who truly understands the role they’re playing. Kingsley and I, when I first saw his audition, I was like, ‘Oh, OK.’ Of course, I have my own moments of thinking, ‘How are people going to [react],’ because this conversation [about British actors playing iconic US figures] is going on and it’s been going on. But up until that moment, if I was moved by a performance, I really don’t care where a person’s from. As an audience member, to me they truly understood what they were doing, what they were embodying. After Kingsley’s first audition, I wanted to give him some notes, talk to him and get to know him and his relationship to Malcolm. He said all the things I needed to hear him say. It’s unfortunate this is where we are.\n\nOne of the things I discovered throughout this process of One Night in Miami is upon first receiving and reading this, I thought this is a love letter to the black man’s experience in America. But taking a step back and taking in marginalised people across the world, there are feelings and experiences that black people in the UK and Brazil feel are the same as in America. While the history of how a country came to be may be different, the marginalisation of a black man is the same. Colourism is the same in all of those places. Kingsley was the best actor for the role – I wouldn’t change my choices for anyone.\n\nWhen casting, King feels a role chooses an actor.\n\nWhen that person comes in, it’s just clear they have a connection to the character in a way that they’ve been able to find a bit of themselves within that role so that the performance feels like it’s coming from a real place. That’s what we do as actors, we find a bit of ourselves in there so we can truly keep a performance grounded and rooted in truth.\n\nHer advice to anybody would be to avoid falling into the trap of comparison.\n\nWe so often get caught up in thinking ‘I didn’t do this,’ ‘I didn’t go to this school’ or ‘I never saw that film,’ ‘That piece of work is not my favourite but it seems every director who has an interview talks about that one piece of work.’ It doesn’t mean you’re not going to be successful or great at your craft just because you don’t respond to it the same way. That’s kind of the point, that’s why you are you, because you’re not someone else. Some of those attributes are God-given, some of them are picked up along the way because of your circumstances but those are the things that make you, you, and you have a signature to your storytelling. I would just say don’t fall into that trap of comparison.\n\ntagged in: 24, American Crime, Being Mary Jane, Boyz n the Hood, Enemy of the State, Friday, HBO, If Beale Street Could Talk, Insecure, Jerry Maguire, John Singleton, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Leap of Faith, One Night in Miami, Poetic Justice, Regina King, Scandal, Seven Seconds, Shameless, Southland, The Big Bang Theory, The Boondocks, The Leftovers, This Is Us\n\nAs Death in Paradise returns for its landmark 10th season, location manager Rébecca Bering and production designer Eryl Ellis tell DQ about their roles in making the series on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.\n\nSince its launch in 2001, BBC crime drama Death in Paradise has served up a welcome slice of Caribbean sunshine into the winter television schedules. This year will be no exception, as despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, filming for the series’ landmark 10th season took place last year, with cast and crew once again shooting in the idyllic surroundings of the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.\n\nContinuing the fish-out-of-water story of a British detective solving crimes on the fictional island of Saint Marie, season 10 marks the first full season fronted by Ralf Little (The Royle Family), who plays DI Neville Parker. The character took over island duties from the departing DI Jack Mooney (Ardal O’Hanlon) midway through season nine.\n\nProduced by Red Planet Pictures and distributed by BBC Studios, the new season also sees the return of DS Florence Cassell (Joséphine Jobert), who is ready to get back to work after her fiancé’s death two years ago – but she hasn’t banked on her new boss, Neville. Other returning cast members include Don Warrington as Commissioner Selwyn Patterson, Tobi Bakare as DS JP Hooper and Elizabeth Bourgine as Mayor Catherine Bordey.\n\nAhead of season 10’s launch on BBC1 tomorrow, location manager Rébecca Bering and production designer Eryl Ellis tell DQ about the roles they play in making the series.\n\nHow did you join the series?\n\nBering: I joined the Death in Paradise crew in 2015 for season five as an assistant location manager [ALM], becoming location manager for season 10. It was my first experience as an ALM and also in a shooting environment. Previously I was the manager of a real estate company in the Caribbean. These two positions are similar in one respect: you have to find the perfect location or house related to the storyboard. Since the start of this amazing opportunity, I have worked on 48 episodes of Death in Paradise and I really enjoy it.\n\nEllis: I had just finished the first season of [Welsh crime drama] Hinterland. After a wonderful and engaging experience in cold, wild Wales, I was approached by Red Planet. I happily found myself tempted to Guadeloupe. I’ve made so many friends over the years, both islanders and visiting crew. It’s great when a job becomes an adventure.\n\nRebecca, what does your job involve?\n\nBering: My job in the locations department is to read the script and find the perfect location in a precise area. The perfect location for me is a setting that is exactly as it’s described in the script. For example: ‘A pretty house where an energetic, single young lady lives, with a small gate in the front and a pool in the back. Someone is spying on her from the garden behind bushes but she cannot see him…’\n\nThe perfect location is also the location the director, producer and line producer will love and sign off because they can imagine the story there, and the location respects the budget.\n\nOne more very important, practical criteria: the perfect location is also a location the cast and crew can access, where we can park the unit and the trucks next to it and have catering, a green room and changing room not too far away. I am thinking about all these criteria when I am scouting.\n\nAnother part of my job is the relationship with the owners and administrators. It’s really important to take care of the locations and organise the dressing of the set, the arrival of the crew and the get-out. The locations team is the main contact between production and owner.\n\nHow do you work with the rest of the team to find the right locations?\n\nBering: When I’m scouting, I always search for the two best options. The first person I show the location to is the director, and after that the producer, the art director, DOP, first assistant and so on. On Death in Paradise, when they agree all locations for two episodes, we have a tech recce day, showing these to the heads of each department – camera, lighting, sound, grip, the art department, production, unit – and I make a list of all their needs to organise them for each location.\n\nDoes the show have a particular style, such as presenting a ‘postcard’ view of Guadeloupe or avoiding tourism spots?\n\nBering: Death in Paradise, for me, has a particular style. It’s a family series with not too much blood. This series shows some of the most beautiful places in Guadeloupe, with sea or rainforest views. Guadeloupe is a beautiful island with many towns, which is very different and interesting for shooting.\n\nEryl, what is your design brief for the show?\n\nEllis: The show was established by the time I first came on board but I wanted to define its separate visual worlds a bit more. We agreed to keep a visual tab on each hero set. A prop in the beach shack would have nothing too similar in Catherine’s bar, and the police station again is unique. We wanted to be more specific with the visual language.\n\nI was also intrigued by how much better things look from under cover in such harsh light. We tried to give the camera shaded areas to shoot from and through whenever possible. We also are very aware of colour discipline. Primaries are very powerful in harsh light. To be fair, most end up in a fabulous bleached state in no time. We decided, in the main, not to override the natural state, keeping the colours muted or washed. The light did the rest for us.\n\nWhat is the balance between building sets and dressing locations?\n\nEllis: As ever, a ‘walk-in’ location is extremely rare. We inevitably have had to build quite a lot, and certain elements, like an archeological camp, are basically a field before we get going, albeit in a fabulous situation.\n\nWe build the shack every season. We’ve just finished and are taking the structure apart to put it in a container until the shoot starts again later this year. This year we’ve constructed a hospital with a maternity wing because of Covid restrictions. We are always enhancing what’s there to a certain degree. I have to work closely with our location manager to find the most suitable option. It’s then a matter of adjustment.\n\nHow do you both prepare for each season?\n\nBering: I have six weeks’ preparation for each season and I begin by searching the locations for the first two episodes. When we begin to film these two episodes, I scout for the next two and continue in the same way until we finish the eight episodes of the season. In Guadeloupe, we don’t have companies like in England with real location databases where you can pick up locations. I have my own database and a good memory.\n\nEllis: I’ve done five of the 10 seasons to date. Each one has been very different in its challenges. Crewing up is very important and I like to get to prospective co-workers very early. One has to have the time to digest what the job entails. An initial reaction to an offer is, “Well yes, what’s not to like?” However, most folk come back with a reason that they can’t make the time and distance [from the UK] work.\n\nI like to enjoy the British climate beforehand, with winter walks and cold days at sea on my boat. It’s like going ‘off world’ when you get to Guada. We also buy enough to fill a 20-foot container with what’s not available on the island, be it properties or consumables. It’s a small, exotic island after all.\n\nWhere are some of the main locations used in the show?\n\nBering: Most of the locations used are in the following towns: Deshaies, Pointe-Noire and Sainte-Rose. There are also some in Saint-Francois, Gosier and Bouillante. All the main locations – Honore Police Station, the shack and Catherine’s bar – are in Deshaies. That’s why we film in this area and the closest towns.\n\nWhat are some of the strangest or most unusual locations you have found?\n\nBering: Two of the most unusual locations I have found were for season 10, so I will let you discover these new episodes soon. In the previous season, I remember an isolated clearing I found to land a helicopter in with a direct view of the La Soufriere volcano in Guadeloupe. We went to scout a volcano in Montserrat by boat to compare, which was an amazing experience.\n\nEryl, does the show have a particular design style?\n\nEllis: There is a Death in Paradise world. It’s certainly not what is seen day to day in our island lives out there. For us in design, it’s a balance between a retro island reality and what is asked for in the scripts. The Land Rover and bike combo are not exactly for motorway traffic use and the police station is old and beautifully battered, but we can have bodies discovered by state-of-the-art ground piercing radar.\n\nThe trick, I believe, is to keep our core identity as consistent as possible. It’s a place everyone would like to visit. The shack is truly a build made in paradise. When we put it up on the beach at the start of a season, you stand there and look at the sea… It still makes me go ‘wow.’\n\nHow do you use the island setting to enhance the show’s design?\n\nEllis: I had a moment this year when we were looking for a location to shoot a hospice set. We’d looked at an institutional bedroom. It was OK, but very uninspiring. Jordan Hogg, the director, called me over to a refectory in the collection of small buildings. He said: “This is it,” and I was thinking, “Thanks pal, it’s a canteen.” I looked back at where I’d come in and there was a fantastic vista of a green Caribbean outlook through a large window wall. We built an interior wall set and put in some curtains and props. Simple. Utilise the good stuff.\n\nWhat have you most enjoyed about working on the show?\n\nEllis: Like all other projects, it has its moments, but it’s up there with the best work experience I’ve had in my career. I love making the show in the circumstance of the island. I regularly swim out a couple of hundred yards from the crew hotel at sunset. There’s a marker buoy out there. This year I saw the sun drop over the horizon and a full moon rise up over the mountains at the same time from this spot. It’s really not a bad gig!\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges in your job?\n\nBering: The challenge is to make everyone happy and to satisfy the production and owners.\n\nEllis: Guadeloupe is a part of France. It has most facilities that you would expect in a contemporary metropolitan situation. However, the only art shop on the island closed this year due to Covid. There are no prop stores, rigging facilities, SFX, car companies, animal handlers, drape hire or transport companies. Apart from this, it’s a walk on the beach! Ironically, I think our biggest ask was to produce a London trading floor and boardroom in Guadeloupe as well as the interior of a London police station. I think we got away with it.\n\nRebecca, is there one location you would like the show to use in future series?\n\nBering: There is one I would love to film and it’s an entire town with beautiful locations and small alleys, totally Death in Paradise postcard. It’s called the Les Saintes islands.\n\ntagged in: BBC, Death in Paradise, Eryl Ellis, Rébecca Bering\n\nTea Lindeburg, the creator of Danish podcast-turned-Netflix series Equinox, discusses adapting the supernatural mystery drama, which centres on a young woman investigating her sister’s disappearance.\n\nFor more than a decade, Denmark has been known as a powerhouse of international television drama. So it’s surprising to note that the launch of supernatural thriller Equinox marks only the second original Danish drama – following The Rain in 2018 – to arrive on global streaming giant Netflix.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, Equinox is also the first series from Apple Tree Productions, the Copenhagen-based company set up by Piv Bernth and Lars Hermann, the former head and deputy head of drama at Danish public broadcaster DR, respectively.\n\nBefore leaving the network in 2017, they were among the producers behind international hits including Forbrydelsen (The Killing), Bron/Broen (The Bridge), Liberty, Herrens Veje (Ride Upon the Storm), Arvingerne (The Legacy) and Bedrag (Follow the Money).\n\nEquinox, which debuted on Netflix on December 30, follows a young woman named Astrid, who was nine years old when a class of students from her school – including her sister – inexplicably disappeared in 1999, leaving her traumatised and plagued by horrific visions.\n\nTwenty-one years later, in 2020, Astrid is the host of a late-night radio show. When one of the three survivors from 1999 contacts her through the show and then dies in mysterious circumstances, Astrid becomes determined to find out what happened to her sister and the rest of the class, only to discover a dark and unsettling truth that involves her in ways she never imagined.\n\nThe six-part series is based on the acclaimed podcast Equinox 1985 by Tea Lindeburg, who has also created and written the story for the screen. Bernth is the executive producer, Dorthe Riis Lauridsen (The Cavalry) is the producer and Søren Balle (Follow the Money, The Rain) directed the first four episodes.\n\nThe cast is headed by Danica Curcic (The Bridge, Warrior), who plays Astrid in 2020, and Lars Brygmann (Dicte), who plays her father. Hanne Hedelund is her mother, while Viola Martinsen plays Astrid as a nine-year-old. Other actors include Karoline Hamm (Ida), Fanny Leander Bornedal (Amelia), August Carter (Jakob), Ask Emil Mossberg Truelsen (Falke) and Alexandre Willaume (Henrik).\n\nHere, Lindeburg tells DQ about working with Netflix to adapt her podcast, her writing process and why she hopes the show will continue the success of Danish drama on the world stage.\n\nWhat were the origins of the podcast?\n\nEvery year in June, the streets of Copenhagen flood with trucks filled with high-school graduates who, for a day, drive around to all of their fellow classmates’ homes and are served alcohol and food by the parents.\n\nThis tradition has existed in Denmark for more than 100 years and it has always fascinated me. It’s a modern rite of passage; it’s the moment when you stand with all the possibilities in front of you and your childhood behind you. It’s your first taste of freedom and the moment you take the leap into adulthood. What do you want to do? Where do you want to go? What do you want to be? What do you want out of life?\n\nI thought, ‘What if your life was to end here? If you never got to the other side. If your life ended just before it was about to begin.’ And so came the podcast.\n\nWhat were the steps that led Netflix and Apple Tree Productions to partner with you on an adaptation?\n\nAfter the podcast was released on DR, it turned out to be quite a success. I reached out to Piv Bernth, who at that time had just left DR as head of drama and started her own company, Apple Tree, and proposed to her that we make it into a TV show.\n\nBeing the genre it is, it simply did not have a platform within the local Danish market, so Piv took it to Netflix. After a few months of pitching to Tesha Crawford and Mia Sohlman at Netflix, I was lucky enough that they saw the potential and the nerve of the show and wanted to commission it.\n\nDid the story naturally lend itself to television? What were your initial thoughts about adapting it?\n\nWhen I first came up with the idea for Equinox, it was actually as a TV show, but I was also well aware this could never be produced just for the Danish market. I have always been obsessed with sound, and was at that time listening to a lot of different podcasts, so I saw it as a challenge, never having done radio before, to convey this story only in sound. To me, radio is a very visual art form, the main difference from TV being it is the listeners who create their own images.\n\nThe podcast has a documentary/autobiographical form, with me acting as the main character named Tea Lindeburg, telling the story of how a girl from my childhood street disappeared with her class back in 1985, which led many listeners to question whether this really happened.\n\nInitially, I played with the thought that the TV show should have the same kind of documentary form. But as I started writing, it didn’t want to go that way. There’s a question of reality in the podcast – what is real, whose reality is more true, is it all in the eye of the beholder? I went with that as the main theme instead.\n\nHow was the series developed with Netflix?\n\nAs soon as Netflix came on board, Mia Sohlman, my creative producer, was very involved. She was a partner. She was as invested as I was in making this great. The best thing for the creative is once Netflix greenlights a project, there are no steps along the way where they might cancel it. It gives an immense security and creative freedom. It gave me room to work and trust the story and my ideas and to experiment.\n\nI felt they understood me, the show and what I wanted to tell. They respected my ideas and my tone and were always focused on Equinox developing true to my vision, but didn’t hold back on challenging me either. I feel very lucky to have partnered with them.\n\nWho are the main characters and how do we follow them through the story?\n\nAstrid is the main character. She is a woman in her mid-30 who, as a child, lost her older sister Ida in an inexplicable tragedy. When the past comes knocking on her door, she can no longer leave the mystery be and dives back into the past to find out what happened that night in 1999. There must be an explanation. No one just disappears.\n\nWe also follow nine-year-old Astrid in 1999 during the months following Ida’s disappearance. She starts having nightmares and a sense that she can bring back her sister. Lastly, we follow Ida and her friends in 1999 during the three months leading up to their disappearance.\n\nWhat are the challenges of adapting a podcast for television?\n\nFor the podcast, I was working with a voiceover that reflected the discoveries the main character made and also reflected on her past – something I didn’t see working in the TV show. How could I provide these reflections without a voiceover? The solution was to make those stories separate layers, and that’s how the layers of Astrid as a child and as a teenager came about.\n\nAnother challenge was transferring audio to images, especially since the visuals in my head probably weren’t the same as those imagined by the listeners. What was most important to me was hitting the tone of the podcast – the same eerie, secrets-around-the-corner tone. That was my way to stay true to the podcast.\n\nHow would you describe the writing process?\n\nIt went very fast! From greenlight to the finished show, there was only (before Covid-19 hit) supposed to be about a year. I had to work fast. And even though I knew the story, everything had to be re-thought. The writers room was set up in two weeks and then we just ran a marathon. But I loved every second of it and learned a lot.\n\nHave you changed the story from the original podcast?\n\nI haven’t changed the story, but I have expanded it. New storylines and new characters have surfaced but the core of the story, the main character and her journey have stayed the same.\n\nWhat is the visual style of the series?\n\nWe knew early on that we wanted more colours and textures than the typical noir dramas that have come from Denmark over the past few years. We worked with a luring feel, like something is always waiting around the corner: shadows, secrets, reflections and the ‘other reality’ about to jump at you.\n\nThen, working with the different time periods (2020 and 1999), we made a decision not to distinguish between them visually. We wanted the times to float together, like a circular movement, both existing at the same time. The past becomes the present and the present becomes the past.\n\nWhat does Danica Curcic bring to the lead role of Astrid?\n\nDanica is a unique actress. She is very involved, very prepared and very invested. She gave Astrid a great darkness and sorrow, and a feeling of something hidden inside her that is about to burst. She vibrates. Is Astrid crazy or is she the only one who sees the truth? Danica’s Astrid balances that perfectly.\n\nHow was your experience filming the series and being on set?\n\nI worked very closely with lead director Søren Balle and felt he completely understood my intentions. He engages with the actors in an admirable way. It was almost magical and sometimes even felt like an out-of-body experience to see how you write something and then, all of a sudden, there would be so many people working so hard to visualise your words. Did I really write that there was a waving cat? Yes, and there is. I felt truly blessed by all the people who gave so much to make Equinox what it became.\n\nWhere was Equinox filmed and how are locations used?\n\nWe shot all of the series in Denmark and most of it in the larger area of Copenhagen. We had one episode where we were supposed to go to Marrakesh, but unfortunately we had to change and rewrite that part because of Covid.\n\nThe locations play a big part in the show. They are all versions of my own childhood locations. Astrid’s childhood home is a character. It has secrets and dark corners; it has its own journey.\n\nThe same goes for the high school, the amusement park and the island. Nothing is random.\n\nWhat were the biggest challenges in making the series?\n\nEverything went quite smoothly until Covid-19 hit, so I would have to say Covid-19. We were in the middle of shooting episodes five and six when everything closed down. So not only did the season change in the middle of an episode, but there were so many scenes I had to rethink and rewrite for those episodes because we had too many extras in them (like a graduation ceremony, for example), because we had too many older actors interacting with younger actors or because we couldn’t travel. Covid-19 was the biggest challenge for sure.\n\nHow do you think the show will be received by fans of the podcast?\n\nI hope they will like it! I hope they will see the similarities to the podcast but also welcome the changes and appreciate the choices we’ve made to bring it to TV. I hope they will feel like they get more – more of the same, if that makes sense. I especially am curious about how they will receive the expansion of the spiritual layer.\n\nDanish drama has become a worldwide phenomenon. Why do you think Equinox will appeal to an international audience?\n\nThat’s a hard question and I don’t know for certain that it will! But I hope it will. When I write a story, I have no answers, just questions. It’s about taking an idea and opening it up.\n\nThis idea was an image in my head of an empty school bus on the road. Then I dove into it and, like yarn tangled up in a knot, I just kept pulling until it unravelled. I can only write something I am curious and excited about, and then I hope others will feel the same. But you just never know.\n\ntagged in: Apple Tree Productions, Equinox, Netflix, Tea Lindeburg\n\nDQ looks ahead to 2021 and picks out 20 new dramas expected to air over the next year, from a submarine thriller and a dystopian Italian drama to shows featuring a globetrotting balloon expedition and the return of a serial killer.\n\nAnna\n\nFrom: Italy\n\nOriginal broadcaster: Sky Italia\n\nStarring: Giulia Dragotto and Alessandro Pecorella\n\nCreated and directed by Niccolò Ammaniti, based on his novel of the same name, Anna is a dystopian story of a ravaged world destroyed by a virus that kills adults but spares children.

Hogfather, The Colour of Magic and Going Postal have been brought to the small screen by Sky, while Truckers, Soul Music and Wyrd Sisters have all been transformed into animated series.\n\nLast year, Good Omens, which Pratchett co-wrote with Neil Gaiman, was recreated for TV by Amazon Studios and BBC Studios, with Michael Sheen and David Tennant starring. Earlier this year, meanwhile, Pratchett’s Narrativia struck a partnership with Motive Pictures and Endeavour Content to bring the author’s Discworld universe to life in a series of “definitive screen adaptations.”\n\nBut the latest series based on the author’s work is set to be something completely different – and has already caused controversy, with some fans uneasy about the cyberpunk aesthetic on show in the recently released trailer. Also inspired by the Discworld novels, The Watch is described as a “punk rock thriller” set among the characters of the City Watch, a bunch of misfit cops fighting to save the ramshackle city of Ankh-Morpork.\n\nProduced by BBC Studios for BBC America, the show’s cast is led by Richard Dormer (Game of Thrones) as Sam Vines, the captain of the City Watch. Lara Rossi (I May Destroy You) plays the last scion of nobility, Lady Sybil Ramkin; Adam Hugill (1917) is the naïve but heroic Carrot; Marama Corlett (Blood Drive) plays the mysterious Angua; and Jo Eaton-Kent (Don’t Forget the Driver) is ingenious forensics expert Cheery.\n\nThey are joined by Paul Kaye (Game of Thrones) as Inigo Skimmer and Ralph Ineson (Chernobyl), who lends his voice to Sergeant Detritus, a huge troll made of stone and a member of the City Watch. Wendell Pierce (The Wire) voices Death, a dry, sardonic Grim Reaper, and Matt Berry (Year of the Rabbit) voices magical sword Wayne.\n\nThe cast is completed by Sam Adewunmi (The Last Tree) as Carcer Dun, Anna Chancellor (Pennyworth) as Lord Vetinari, James Fleet (Outlander) as The Archchancellor, Ingrid Oliver (Doctor Who) as Doctor Cruces, Ruth Madeley (Years & Years) as Throat, Hakeem Kae-Kazim (Dynasty) as Captain John Keel and Bianca Simone Mannie (Homeland) as Wonse.\n\nBehind the scenes, lead writer Simon Allen (The Musketeers) executive produces with Richard Stokes (Broadchurch), Hilary Salmon (Luther) and Ben Donald (The Mallorca Files) for BBC Studios, alongside Rob Wilkins (Good Omens) for Pratchett’s production company Narrativia. Distributed by BBC Studios, the series is directed by Craig Viveiros (The War of the Worlds).\n\nHere, Allen and Stokes reveal more about the development process behind the series and how they brought the world of Ankh-Morpork to life while shooting in South Africa.\n\nThe series inspired by Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels. In what ways is it similar to and different from the books?\n\nStokes: It is very different. It’s inspired by the characters that are in the books, and Simon’s done a brilliant job of updating and changing the world so it fits an eight-hour returnable series. ‘Adaptation’ isn’t quite the right word.\n\nAllen: A lot of what’s really amazing about the books is dependent on the fact that they are books. They work because they use the architecture of literature in a very specific way that I think a lot of fans would say can’t be replicated.\n\nWhat we tried to do is to take that engineering and that thinking, and his approach and mentality, and apply it to the medium of television – to the genres of fantasy, cop shows and workplace dramas – to create an experience that’s very universal.\n\nYou don’t have to be a Pratchett fan to enjoy the show. But if you are a Pratchett fan, if you give it a chance, you will see 1,000 things in there that are entirely consistent with the spirit and tone of the books that you love so much.\n\nWhat made you decide to take the characters and put them in a new story as opposed to a straight adaptation?\n\nAllen: In terms of dramatising Guards! Guards! [the first appearance of the City Watch], which I’ve loved since I was 15 years old, I don’t think there would be eight episodes worth of drama and story in it. It would make an amazing film or two hour-long episodes. But what I love about Terry Pratchett is he’s a spectrum. The Terry Pratchett of 1989, when the first Watch book was published, is a very different writer from the Terry Pratchett of 2002 when Night Watch was written, which was one of his great works.\n\nI was very concerned that if we did something that was too close to the original, you wouldn’t get all the amazing things he went on to become. So what we’ve done is borrow liberally from across the spectrum of Terry Pratchett and from all of the books he did to create a whole new experience that is a love letter to what I took from those books and how I responded to them.\n\nSimon, what has been the writing process behind the series?\n\nAllen: I like to work collaboratively. I had a really amazing team of people around me on this, including Richard and Rob [Wilkins]. We had a lot of new voices in our writers room and a lot of people who don’t often get an opportunity. In particular, we worked with a writer called Amrou Al-Kadhi, an extraordinary non-binary, queer writer who brought a new perspective to the whole piece. Amrou really responded to the queer themes in Terry Pratchett’s work and allowed us to extrapolate those and build them into the fabric of the show.\n\nOur show has a real queer sensibility about it and a lot of the queer audience are really going to enjoy it. Amrou uses the phrase ‘queer content.’ There’s a real queer journey for one of the characters, Cheery, and we’re putting something on screen and dramatising something that isn’t done very often and certainly hasn’t been done in this kind of show.\n\nThe Watch is described as ‘genre-busting.’ Tell us more.\n\nAllen: There are times when it’s a police procedural, a workplace comedy, a romantic comedy, a fantasy thriller and a musical. It really does use all of those genres and blends them together so you never quite know what it’s going to do to you.\n\nIt’s a show that turns at right angles in really unexpected ways, turns mean on you, moves you and surprises you. I really think we’re doing something new, and I don’t think we’d be able to do it if we weren’t working with this incredible, rich material, because the source material itself is very subversive, very disruptive and innovative.\n\nTerry Pratchett himself was incredibly irreverent in all kinds of ways. He had no respect for form, for genre, for the literary medium, and we’re being similarly irreverent towards television. When I pitched the show to [then president and general manager] Sarah Barnett at BBC America, the thing I constantly alluded to was the way it felt like watching sitcom The Young Ones as a kid in the 80s, which felt really dangerous and volatile. I don’t think people know quite how radical it is.\n\nAs producers, has it been difficult to balance those different genres?\n\nStokes: It’s always quite difficult to take different elements. Everyone knows the police procedural and the romantic comedy, and tonally trying to get that right is a fine line to tread. Like the original books, there are bits that are very funny and there are bits that are very moving and very empathetic. And there are times when hopefully the audience will laugh and hopefully will have a tear in their eye. It’s trying to be distinctive and different yet using elements that audiences are familiar with.\n\nHave you faced any particular challenges during the making of the series?\n\nAllen: A lot of what we’re trying to do is very physical, very handmade. It’s bizarrely not a VFX-heavy show in lots of ways. There is VFX but we’re quite CGI-light. We tried to do a lot of stuff in camera.\n\nThe watchword we used, which I put in the original series bible when I pitched it, was ‘fantasy with fingerprints.’ I wanted to be able to see the fingerprints of the people who made it because I grew up with movies like Time Bandits and Labyrinth. We use an awful lot of prosthetics. The costumes carry a lot of the heavy lifting. It’s a very physical, tangible, lived-in universe rather than one that’s inauthentic and CG’d to hell.\n\nThat has been a particular challenge, because you’re making things all the time. We had lots of bizarre conversations, like being on the set at three in the morning having a debate about whether we could put an eyepatch on a pigeon to make it look like David Bowie. And we have managed to make a pigeon that looks a bit like David Bowie, but it doesn’t have an eye patch.\n\nWhat was your experience filming in South Africa?\n\nStokes: From a producer’s point of view, it’s been great. When we came to look at the original designs for how we wanted the show to look, we looked at various places – Prague, Budapest, a couple of other places in Europe – and they were very busy. It also felt like that was a world of Pratchett that had been done before with the Sky adaptations, and we wanted to do something slightly different. Cape Town offered that, and we had a producer who assembled one of the best crews I’ve ever worked with. It’s been extraordinary.\n\nAllen: Pratchett fans have different versions of the city of Ankh-Morpork in their heads. Some people think it’s Victorian Georgian, some people think it’s like Seattle or medieval or Roman. What I always took from Terry Pratchett in the way he executed Ankh-Morpork was it was contrary. It had a mix of old and new architecture. We’ve been able to achieve that in South Africa. It’s a very contrary environment; it has a slightly junk-yard aesthetic, with different styles clashing and different architectures blended to create something that feels familiar but, at the same time, utterly fantastic.\n\nHow does the series compare to other Terry Pratchett adaptations?\n\nSimon: It’s very different from the Sky adaptations. I think it’s much more like Pratchett than the Sky adaptations because of its spirit and its tone. It’s incredibly funny and incredibly moving. If I were to position it in the marketplace, I would say it’s definitely between [fellow BBC America shows] Orphan Black and Killing Eve as a point of orientation. It’s incredibly subversive and left-field but has broad appeal. It has those universal themes you look for in a show you want people to relate to.\n\nWhat can viewers, and Pratchett fans in particular, expect from the series when it launches on BBC America on January 3, 2021?\n\nAllen: You can expect an incredible ride. You can expect to see versions of the characters you know and love. We have loads and loads of very irreverent, outrageous things. The show is incredibly provocative. Every episode features a sequence in it that’s unlike anything you’ve seen before.\n\nThere’s a ballroom dance in episode four when they go into a facility that has a curse on it – if you try to fight each other, it makes you dance. So the villains and the heroes have to dance together, which is a very Terry Pratchett idea.\n\nIn episode six, a villain is vanquished through a magical queer drag-queen lip-sync battle. We do 101 things that people will expect to see and 101 things they couldn’t even imagine are coming. It’s going to be quite a ride.\n\ntagged in: BBC America, BBC Studios, Richard Stokes, Simon Allen, Terry Pratchett, The Watch\n\nFilm and television producer Stacey Sher opens up about her 30-year career in Hollywood, working with Quentin Tarantino and how FX political drama Mrs America was brought to the screen.\n\nFor three decades, producer Stacey Sher (pictured above) has been involved in making some of the biggest feature films to come out of Hollywood, from Pulp Fiction and Erin Brockovich to Get Shorty and Django Unchained.\n\nMore recently, her 2011 film Contagion found new audiences thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, while Sher also had a hand in one of the hit television series of the year, Mrs America, which dramatised the true story of the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and the unexpected backlash led by conservative activist Phyllis Schlafy.\n\nSpeaking during this year’s Content London On Demand, Sher, who is also the founder of Shiny Penny Productions, reflected on her career, her partnership with filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and the future of the film and television business.\n\nSher had just wrapped production on Respect, the Aretha Franklin biopic starring Jennifer Hudson, and was in post-production on FX on Hulu series Mrs America when the pandemic struck the US earlier this year. Her last meeting was a reunion with director Steven Soderbergh and the team behind Contagion, the 2011 feature about a fictional pandemic sweeping the globe…\n\nStacey Sher: We were filming it 10 years ago. We all knew this [pandemic] was a matter of not if, but when. Obviously we engineered [the movie] for drama. But it’s ironic and heartbreaking that that scene with Kate Winslet, where she explains what the R0 number is and how transmission works, has basically become a primer for people to understand how to try to keep themselves safe.\n\nWhat we never could have anticipated was the total failure of government public health in the US, and the person in the White House and their task force and their total disregard for listening to science and scientists. It was surreal seeing a film that came out nine years ago be number one on iTunes, and I’m happy the cast came together to make hand-washing PSAs and to talk about transmission and masks and all of those things. I’m super grateful to the entire team of scientists who are hard at work.\n\nWith the subsequent shutdown of movie theatres, distributors have started releasing films straight to streaming sites, and the question is when people will be able to go to the movies again – and if they will want to…\n\nWe’ve created this world where you can see anything at any time, wherever you want, on whatever device you want. But there is something magical about sitting in a room with a group of strangers and going on a journey. Maybe the industry has to look at itself and say, ‘How have we not done a better job to make that process more relevant and a part of a ritual?’\n\nThe question is, how do we use new means of reminding people how special cinema is and how important a communal art form it is for new generations? That’s on all of us to figure out because, otherwise, where do the next generation of filmmakers come from? Some of them are definitely going into television, and television has become really exciting. One of the things we get to look at is what is best suited for the format. Is it a two-hour movie or is it three hours? Is it a series? Is it two seasons?\n\nSher originally wanted to go into sports broadcasting but was encouraged by a film professor to join a film producing programme at USC. Her dad also inspired her love of movies, and she grew up watching the work of Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet and Sidney Pollack…\n\nI was working for a music video director who did comedy specials and also was just starting to direct music videos, so I worked on the early Twisted Sister video ‘We’re Not Going To Take It.’ It was great because it was the Wild West and you had to figure out how to do things.\n\nBecause of that, I met an aspiring screenwriter named David Simkins, who had this idea called After Hours, a Martin Scorsese movie for kids, and that became Adventures in Babysitting. I was working on a trial basis for the producers, Debra Helen and Lynda Obst, and then spent about six years working with them until I left while we were about to release my first associate producer credit, The Fisher King.\n\nI had the great pleasure of working with [The Fisher King director] Terry Gilliam, who I adore and was a complete inspiration. Then I began the 12 years I worked with Danny DeVito and Michael Shamberg in our company Jersey Films.\n\nSher went on to forge a partnership with writer-director Quentin Tarantino, working on Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight…\n\nI had read Quentin’s script for Reservoir Dogs before he had shot a frame of film. There was this section of Variety called Future Films in Production and I used to scour it to see if there were writers or directors with well-known stars attached to screenplays I had never heard of, because I would know those were the really good new scripts. If you could get a star attached, then you could get financing. That really hasn’t changed.\n\nI saw this script, it had Harvey Keitel, it had all these great actors and it was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. I got his script. I read it and was trying to meet him. Then at a screening of Terminator 2, my friend Chris said, ‘Stacey, I’m about to make your night. Meet Quentin Tarantino.’ We were all talking to Harvey Keitel because Harvey had just finished doing Thelma & Louise, and I was with my friend Callie Khouri, who wrote Thelma & Louise. Quentin and Harvey were going to start making Reservoir Dogs. So that’s how we met.\n\nI offered him a film to adapt, which he chose not to do and then we made a blind deal with him and [producer] Lawrence Bender for whatever he wrote next [which was 1994’s Pulp Fiction]. He had not even shot a frame of film at that point that we made that deal. But Danny DeVito, my former partner, was what was known as a final-cut producer. We were able to offer people the protection of their vision because Danny was never going to interfere with it.\n\nSher believes the quality of television is so high now because new programmes are not only competing with what else is on that day, but the entire history of filmed entertainment…\n\nMy daughter is racing to make her way through Grey’s Anatomy so that she can be ready for the new season, and has watched all of Friends. Our family went through Community but also watched Money Heist, Unorthodox, Dave and What We Do in the Shadows. You could see all the seasons of Better Things, which is delightful, or Schitt’s Creek. Everything is changing, which means there’s opportunity as long as you have a story to tell that matters – and that doesn’t mean important with a capital I.\n\nWe blew through Emily in Paris because it was so great to imagine what it might be like to be frivolous in Paris. It was like going on vacation watching that show. Streamers have shown that people have a hunger for a diversity of content. It’s not all seriousness or superheroes. It’s both. You can want to watch Moonlight and La La Land and also watch The Mandalorian, and you want to watch Hamilton or What the Constitution Means to Me or the new Borat movie.\n\nWhile Zoom fatigue may have set in over the past nine months, video conferencing has opened up the opportunity to develop new projects with people you might not normally bump into…\n\nThere’s no difference between meeting somebody who lives halfway around the world and meeting somebody who lives a half a mile away, because you’re not getting together with them in person. I’m talking to people all over the world about projects now. That is a great change. You’re not just waiting for them to come in to LA or you go on a trip to the UK. I’m developing a French novel, I’m working with a writer in the UK on a network show and a writer who’s based in New York. It’s all the same now.\n\nBut what I’ve discovered is how much the theatrical landscape has changed in terms of what people will buy to develop. I was submitted a book as an adaptation and I thought, ‘Well, I really think this is a movie, it feels like Wall Street to me.’ But two small studios passed and said without an element – either a movie star or a movie star director with a take on it – it wasn’t something they could risk developing. It ended up selling to television.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been trying to develop The Devil in the White City [with Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio] for 10 years, and it is going to get made at Hulu as a limited series. It just couldn’t be contained in two hours. That’s thrilling, but I don’t want to see theatres go away.\n\nMrs America was inspired by a documentary Sher saw in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election, which featured Phyllis Schlafy, the conservative activist who campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) in the 1970s…\n\nI’d always been interested in second-wave feminism and considered myself a feminist. And I was looking at what was going on in with the Hilary Clinton campaign and the intense misogyny that was being directed at her. I pitched it to [showrunner] Dhavi Waller and said, ‘Let’s tell the story of the ERA from the point of view of the spoiler.’\n\nWe were on the precipice of the first female president, we sold it to FX – and then Donald Trump won the election and we went, ‘Wow, OK, this is now going to be the story of how we got from there to here.’ It was an extraordinary journey. Cate Blanchett [who played Schlafy] always says it was a surreal experience because every day you’d go to set and you would be dealing with an issue like Roe v Wade, redistricting, the Supreme Court, all of these things, and every day they’d be in the news.\n\nUnderstanding that women are not a monolith was really interesting and well timed. These women were all heroes and complicated and really cared about being inclusive. That’s messier than having a singular vision driving towards power for any price. Phyllis’s story for us was a story of what happens when you betray your own interests in the interests of other women.\n\nSher is striving for equality and diversity in the film and television business, with Mrs America’s directing team being mostly female and also including two women of colour…\n\nThere’s so much talent out there when you commit yourself and give somebody a shot. It was also amazing to go to the writers room and there were just two men in it. It was intersectional in gender, gender identification, race and also age. It made the show better. We have made progress, but we have to continue moving forward.\n\ntagged in: FX, Mrs America, Shiny Penny Productions, Stacey Sher\n\nWriter and director Eduard Oganesyan speaks to DQ about Chicks, a Russian drama in which four fearless women fight for independence in a provincial town that is dominated by men.\n\nSet in a small provincial town dominated by men, Russian series Chiki (Chicks) sees four call girls fight for their independence by turning their back on prostitution and opening a fitness club.\n\nThe story opens with three friends – Sveta, Marina and Lyuda – earning money in a roadside brothel. When Zhanna returns from Moscow with the idea of starting a business, one by one, they all decide to join the scheme and turn their backs on their turbulent past. But their pimp is not ready to let them go.\n\nProduced by NMG Studio and Mars Media for streamer More.TV, the eight-part series comes from writer and director Eduard Oganesyan. Starring Irina Gorbacheva, Varvara Shmakova, Irina Nosova and Alena Mikhailova, it is distributed by Art House Distribution.\n\nHighlighting issues of religion, gender and social inequality, the series was released in Russia in June and has racked up more than 20 million views so far.\n\nAhead of a screening of the show today as part of Content London On Demand, Oganesyan tells DQ why Chicks was the toughest project of his career – and also his favourite.\n\nTell us about the series.\n\nChicks is about inner freedom and the courage to make decisions. It’s about the fact that you can and probably even must believe that you can change your life at any moment. And you have an absolute right to do it. It’s a story about the idea of being human; that it is not just a word. It is important to remember that.\n\nWhat was the inspiration behind the show?\n\nLife itself inspired me to create this series. I am an ordinary citizen of this country; I have questions and I tried to look for answers. I just tried to dig into these issues. I really wanted to travel this path from the very beginning to understand the inner freedom of these girls and their independence.\n\nWhat themes are prominent in the story?\n\nThe main theme is the understanding that you have the right to self-identification and the right to change the life around you. It’s also about understanding that you always learn, and that at some point you make a decision not to stay put. It’s a story about the change inside yourself.\n\nI also call it a mirror, because we can’t always admit we have shortcomings. However, it’s important to do so because by knowing our shortcomings, we can change them. If you are carried away with closing your eyes [to these issues], there is a danger they will multiply.\n\nDid you have any female voices supporting the project or helping to build the characters?\n\nOf course – my mother and actresses Irina Nosova and Irina Gorbacheva. Irina Nosova was with me from the very beginning of this project. I told her the idea and then we sat together to create the stories of these girls, so she helped me a lot.\n\nIrina Gorbacheva basically took this project and brought it to the studio that ended up producing the show. She was my absolute comrade-in-arms throughout all this time in every aspect. She helped me a lot in creating this project.\n\nHow would you describe your writing process?\n\nI do not usually write series. This was my first experience, and I thought it would be right to write with the actresses in mind. That’s why when I had the idea, I only defined some character details, without going in too deep.\n\nAfter I made my mind up about the actresses who would join me on this path, I started to write the script, taking into account the nature of the actresses themselves. After that, it was easy because I already understood the characters well enough. I was working with Nastya Kuznetsova on the storylining, and occasionally we also met with [co-writer] Anton Kolomeets to work on the outline. Then I went to write it.\n\nAfter that, there was a long process of editing together with Anton and Irina Nosova. This period was very important, because I came with a big story that was still quite raw. We refined every moment, reading the scenes out loud, playing them and checking the credibility of the dialogue, and rewriting it where necessary.\n\nHow did you find the right balance of comedy and drama?\n\nI didn’t want to press on the ‘sore spots’ from the onset, because that is not the way to introduce oneself. It was important for me to gently usher the viewer in, to invite them to serious dialogue with themselves and with the surrounding world.\n\nThat’s why I had three comic episodes, to slowly lure the viewer in, and only after that would I begin to talk about and reflect on serious issues. This balance was important for me. It is the hallmark of life that it is often funny, sad and sometimes even absurd. I needed the comedy in order to get closer and start a serious conversation.\n\nHow did you juggle writing and directing the series?\n\nIt was a necessity – as this is an original story, nobody knows it better than me and I had to be the person to write it. I decided to divide the episodes [between writers] and we were trying to write different episodes, but I couldn’t come to terms with it. It was not my language or my humour. But I must say big thank you to them, and especially to Anton Kolomeets, who told me it was not a very good idea [to split the episodes].\n\nThere are a million advantages and there are no disadvantages [to writing and directing your own work]. It really makes production easier, because when you write it yourself, you know the story in detail by physically writing it down, typing it on the keyboard. You are living through it and, in your head, you are already arranging the scenery and the actors.\n\nHow did you cast the lead roles?\n\nI created the story first, then I found the actresses, and after that I began writing. I have known Varvara Shmykova, Irina Nosova and Irina Gorbacheva for a long time. There were questions concerning Marina, and I met Alyona Mikhailova later on. I was advised to look at her demo reel and her look suited me very well. I needed such a vivid person, so I called her, we talked, she liked the story and she [signed up].\n\nWhere was the series filmed and how were the locations used in the story?\n\nWe filmed in the town of Prokhladny, where my mother lives. I never lived there, but I’ve been visiting her for many years. I was born 120km from Prokhladny, in the Elbrus region. One way or another, this area is my home. I knew it, and it just so happened that when I was visiting my mother, this story was born in my head, and automatically this story became the story of a small southern town based on the locations that I knew so well.\n\nThere was only one issue: it was a risk to shoot in a town where no one had ever filmed before. Initially, the producers tried to persuade me to choose another location where there would be an understanding of what it’s like to shoot a movie. We went searching for other locations – we went to the Rostov region and to Taganrog – but we didn’t find anything there, so we risked shooting in Prokhladny and I definitely do not regret it.\n\nWhat challenges did you face in development or production?\n\nThis project was difficult at every stage. It was very emotional for me – this story is close to me, and sometimes I was very jealous about certain issues and defended one or another position too aggressively. It was all difficult.\n\nI was also simultaneously editing this project, which was an experience because I have never edited such huge volumes of material. I do not really know how to edit, but I faced the truth and understood that nobody would get into my head and there was not much time, so I needed to do it myself.\n\nThis project was difficult from the very beginning until the last second. It was the most difficult project of my life – and my favourite.\n\ntagged in: Chicks, Chiki, Eduard Oganesyan, Mars Media, More.TV, NMG Studio\n\nStar Wars actor John Boyega discusses taking the lead in Red, White & Blue, the third film in Steve McQueen’s Small Axe anthology, which tells the true story of a young black man who joins the police to combat racist attitudes from within.\n\nFrom Academy Award winner Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave, Shame), anthology series Small Axe centres on the experiences of London’s West Indian community.\n\nThe five separate films, set between the late 1960s and mid-1980s, tell stories about a group of people “whose lives have been shaped by their own force of will, despite rampant racism and discrimination,” according to the BBC, which began airing Small Axe in the UK on November 15. The series is also available on Amazon Prime Video in the US.\n\nFollowing opening instalment Mangrove, a true story about anti-racism protests and a subsequent trial for incitement to riot, and music-focused film Lovers Rock, episode three – Red, White & Blue – debuts on BBC1 this Sunday.\n\nAnother true story, it stars John Boyega (Star Wars) as Leroy Logan. In the early 1980s, Logan is working as a forensic scientist. But after his father is assaulted by two policemen, he finds himself driven to revisit his childhood dream of becoming a police officer, with the aim of changing racist attitudes from within – a seemingly impossible task in an institutionally racist Metropolitan Police.\n\nAlongside Boyega, the feature-length drama also stars Steve Toussaint (Pine Gap) as Leroy’s father, Ken, and Antonia Thomas (Misfits, Lovesick) as Greti, Leroy’s wife.\n\nAll five Small Axe films were directed and co-written by McQueen, who penned Red, White & Blue alongside Courttia Newland. The series is produced by EMU Films, Turbine Studios, Amazon Studios and BBC Studios, with the latter distributing. The executive producers are McQueen, Tracey Scoffield and David Tanner.\n\nHere, Boyega discusses working with McQueen, diversity in the UK screen industry and speaking to the real Leroy Logan ahead of playing him in Red, White & Blue.\n\nTell us a bit about your character and what Red, White & Blue is about.\n\nIt’s a film about Leroy Logan, a young black British man who is struggling with his decisions. He’s come to a point where he’s decided he no longer wants to be a scientist, and he wants to basically affect his community in a much more important way. He decides that he’s going to do that by joining the police force in the 1980s, which, in terms of race relations and police force relations with civilians, is a complicated time.\n\nYou basically follow him through this story of self-discovery in an environment that isn’t used to him, his kind or his culture. You see the way in which Leroy decides to navigate that and you also see the way it affects his family. It’s a story that essentially has a father-and-son relationship at the centre of it, during really troubling times in terms of race relations.\n\nWhat did you know about Leroy Logan before taking the role?\n\nI didn’t know much about him at all. But what’s funny is when I first met him and we started talking, I was actually with one of my friends who knew him. And she was like, ‘Oh yeah, I was part of one of the youth groups [run by Logan]’ – he works a lot with young people. But I didn’t know much about his intricate story, especially in the way this script explores it.\n\nHow did your conversations with Leroy shape the way you played him?\n\nIt was really about his decision making. You have to understand this is a black man who decides [to join the police even though] his community and his people don’t really support this institution – especially when his father goes through a personal experience in which he is assaulted by two police officers.\n\nI wanted to understand the man behind that decision; the man who was strong enough to swallow the conflict and give us the representation of the police force needed. Those questions are based on me just being honest like, ‘Bro, if it was me, I probably wouldn’t handle it like this. Why did you make the decision you made?’ Understanding his intention really informed me in making sure the portrayal was accurate.\n\nTell us about your approach to playing real people.\n\nThis is the third time I’ve played somebody who’s real, after [2017 film] Detroit and [2014 Netflix original] Imperial Dreams. [For Leroy] I just watched him. I like to see the way people are. I look at the little things – how they walk, how they talk, how they blink. He’s truly a man’s man, whereas I’ve got more boyish energy. He’s ironing some trousers and he’s in a string vest with little dots on it. He’s just a straight-up Caribbean black man.\n\nHow did you and Steve McQueen approach the dynamic between Leroy and his father?\n\nI had to speak to him about my father and our dynamic, and he spoke to me about his father and their dynamic. We were always either laughing about something that we went through, or it was a serious chat about a real fundamental moment. There was a lot of spontaneous conversation and creativity.\n\nWere you a fan of McQueen’s previous work? What was it like working with him?\n\nYeah, I’m a big fan of Michael Fassbender as well, so I actually found out more about Steve through following Michael Fassbender’s career. Shame [McQueen’s 2011 film starring Fassbender] was one of my favourite movies.\n\nI was taken aback by the way in which Steve shoots certain scenes. For example, in Red, White & Blue, there’s a scene where [Leroy and Greti] have just moved into a flat. It’s just really taking in this new space. Steve leaves the camera on top of the staircase in a corridor with the audio on and just allows us to move within the space and you don’t always see us.\n\nI like the man, that’s the first fundamental. I like what he stands for and the way he thinks. I like how charming he is and I like that he’s in touch with his masculine and feminine. He’s a very balanced individual. So that really helped inspire a good collaboration that will obviously make me want to work with him several different times after this.\n\nYou bring focus to things that are going on, talking about Black Lives Matter and things that affect black people. Where does your sense of pride and fearlessness come from?\n\nI think black individuals should all take a moment and just look at our mental health. Sometimes something is wrong and you don’t even know what it is. I bet you it has something to do with constantly having to morph and to navigate these complicated spaces. You’re doing that from Monday to Friday and it’s long. It eats at your creativity, makes you distrusting of people and affects your personal life and your work ethic.\n\nFor me, the issue really is I refuse to bend to a tune, to fit in. Not everybody gets the chance to think like that, so I understand my privilege, but it’s also my privilege to make sure I can be an example for those who are coming [into the industry] as well – [to show] you can actually live in your culture and your blackness, and that can be aligned with your artistic endeavours. That, for me, is the most important thing. I am who I am; it’s not a decision I have to make.\n\nWhat do you see as the biggest area for improvement in the UK industry with regards to race and representation?\n\nWe need to start seeing representation in terms of producers and executives. We need more rights, more IP, from owners who are black. It’s very important to help influence change and collaboration.\n\nMichaela Coel’s I May Destroy You is definitely one of those projects that is at the forefront of this kind of endeavour. Michaela has an ownership of [that show] that I find really inspiring. I was listening [to an interview with her] and she spoke about the importance of ownership, and that’s one thing that I want to see more of, because I’m also a producer and I get an insight behind the scenes.\n\nWe also need more perspectives in development, especially in terms of black women. These roles that are written and cast to represent you need to come from you.\n\ntagged in: Amazon Prime Video, BBC, BBC Studios, John Boyega, Small Axe, Steve McQueen, Turbine Studios\n\nDQ checks out the upcoming schedules to pick out 10 new dramas to watch this December, from a Stephen King adaptation and a Bryan Cranston-led thriller to two epic Spanish historical dramas.\n\nDime Quien Soy (Tell Me Who I Am)\n\nFrom: Spain\n\nOriginal broadcaster: Movistar+\n\nStarring: Irene Escolar, Oriol Plá, Maria Pia Calzone, Pierre Kiwitt, Will Keen, Stefan Weinert and Pablo Derqui\n\nAir date: December 4\n\nAdditional broadcasters: HBO Latin America, NRK (Norway), DR (Denmark), YLE (Finland), RTP (Portugal), Forthnet Group (Greece and Cyprus)\n\nAn epic adaptation of Julia Navarro’s novel that takes in the Spanish Civil War, the Second World War and the fall of the Berlin Wall, this series charts the personal, romantic and political trials of Amelia Garayoa (Escolar).
