        "text": "The Royal Borough of Greenwich is saddened to learn of the passing of Councillor John Hills, Conservative Councillor for Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward.\n\nCouncillor John Hills passed away on Wednesday 24th April 2024 after a period of illness.\n\nCouncillor John Hills was first elected to the Council at a by-election for New Eltham ward in 2000, and then subsequently re-elected in six consecutive elections - most recently to represent the new Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward in 2022.\n\nA former member of the Armed Forces, Councillor Hills served as the borough’s Armed Forces representative. With 24 years of continuous service on the Council, he was one of the most experienced ward councillors in the borough. His service included periods as Opposition Group Whip and Opposition Spokesperson for Health and Adult Social Care, a subject he was passionate about.\n\nOver the course of his long service to the community, Councillor Hills served as a school governor, as Chair of the Community Association of New Eltham (CANE) and as the Honorary President of the Greenwich Conservative Federation.\n\nCouncillor Matt Hartley, Leader of the Opposition, said:\n\n“John was one of the most modest and unassuming people you could ever meet, and yet his contribution to public life in our borough was immense. He worked tirelessly for the area that he represented for an incredible 24 continuous years. John will be missed by so many residents across Mottingham, New Eltham and the Coldharbour Estate who he helped over that time - and by all of us who were lucky enough to call him a friend.\n\n“In his own quiet way, John was a giant of Greenwich politics - universally liked and respected - and unfailingly kind and generous with his support and encouragement to others. At this difficult time, all of our thoughts are with John’s loving family, who were the centre of his world.“\n\nCouncillor Anthony Okereke, Leader of the Royal Borough of Greenwich, said:\n\n\"My thoughts and condolences are with John's friends and family, who will be rightly proud of the lasting impact he has had on the area he loved. For over two decades John worked tirelessly on behalf of residents in Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham and continued to do so until he sadly passed away.\n\n“John’s loss will be felt not only in his ward, but across Royal Greenwich. He was a gentleman who was rightly proud of both his links, as well as that of the borough, to our Armed Forces. He was respected by all Councillors and residents alike, as his dedication to being a public servant meant he transcended the political divide.\n\n\"We are very lucky to have had such a selfless and dedicated Councillor sit in our chamber.\""
