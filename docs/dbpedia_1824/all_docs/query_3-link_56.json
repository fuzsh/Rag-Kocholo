        "text": "#ThrowbackThursday – Nearly everyone who drives into Eltham notices the little white cottage on the left opposite Dalton Street, sitting beside another historic Eltham cottage known as White Cloud. Many think the little cottage, also known as the Bootmaker’s Cottage is a similar age to White Cloud but the reality is, one is nearly half a century older than the other.\n\nWhite Cloud is known by many to be associated with the Skipper family, and has been since 1944 when Lena Skipper, wife of Mervyn Skipper purchased the cottage. She in fact purchased it from the Estate of Thekla Jarrold who had died in March of the previous year. By the time Thekla had died, she had lived in the Jarrold Cottage for 50 years.\n\nThekla Alvenia Sissilia Ellian married John William Jarrold in 1888 at Clifton Hill. They started their family there but when John’s father William (who was married to Hannah Coleman) died in 1893 the family moved to Eltham. William had married Hannah Coleman in 1856 at his home in Eltham. William had arrived in the colony in 1848 so it is believed the Jarrold Cottage goes back at least to 1856 and possibly early 1850s. For a short period of time the cottage was rented to the Police as a temporary Police Station whilst a new and more permanant station was built further up the hill in 1859.\n\nMany of the early photographs of Eltham were taken by J.H. Clark. One such photo is looking south down the Eltham Hill or Policeman’s Hill as it was known with the Jarrold Cottage clearly visible on the right. There is no bootmaker’s shop beside it. This photo is believed to have been taken circa 1911.\n\nJohn Henry (Harry) Clark born 1877 was the youngest of three boys born to William Henry Clark (1823-1877) and Maria White (1843-1914). Following William’s death that same year, Maria formed a relationship with Robert Conley who took on her young family and another son, Robert Conley Jnr, was born 1880. Maria and Robert married in 1885.\n\nJohn and his brothers, William Charles Clark (1872-1945), Clement Kent Clark (1874-1912) operated a photography business (Clark Bros.) from 25 Thomas Street, Windsor near Prahran during the period c.1894 to 1914.\n\nFollowing the death of Clement in September 1912 and their mother in 1914, the Clark Bros business appears to have dissolved, the premises demolished with a new house under construction by 1915. John appears to have set up business independently in 1914 operating from 29 Moor Street, Fitzroy where he was registered in the 1914 and 1915 Electoral Rolls.\n\nBy 1916 according to the Electoral Roll, John had relocated to Eltham where he continued his practice as a photographer and took many of the early images around the district of Little Eltham. There are newspaper reports however suggesting John was living at Eltham by 1910. Perhaps in some of his travels he met Thekla who had been widowed the year before and she may have rented out a room to him. John and Thekla became close friends.\n\nAround 1930 John changed professions from Photographer to Bootmaker. He became well regarded as a leather worker of expertise who also crafted horse harnesses. He opened a small bootmaker’s shop near the pond at the bottom of the hill, opposite Dalton Street and immediately adjacent to the Jarrold family cottage. The shop was built by Thekla on the Jarrold property.\n\nJohn never married and continued his profession as a bootmaker from this little shop, maintaining a close relationship with neighbouring widow Thekla Jarrold until her death in 1943. His bootmaker shop remains today beside the White Cloud cottage and is one of only three remaining shops in the Little Eltham area from the early 20th century.\n\nThere are a couple of images of Eltham taken by Clark Bros. in the Eltham District Historical Society collection, one such example being Hunniford’s Post Office with Miss Anne Hunniford out front (EDHS_00140 – marked on the back of the print, Clark Bros., 25 Thomas St. Windsor), which would date this image between c.1894 and 1914.\n\nOther early images of Eltham taken by John Henry Clark are marked on the face “J. H. Clark Photo” and it is assumed these are dated between 1914 and 1930.\n\nJohn Henry Clark died 7 December 1956. Interestingly, in the Grant of Probate issued to John Francis Carrucan of 14 Dalton Street, Executor of Clark’s Will, Clark’s profession is only recorded as “Retired Photographer”. Clark’s estate was valued at £500 real estate, being Lots 10 and 11 on Plan of Subdivision No. 10149, part of Crown Portion 12, Section 4 (running between 84-86 Franklin and 83-85 Brougham streets) and personal estate of some £525 in bank and bond deposits. There was nil value assessed on any of his personal belongings. He left his estate to his (half) niece Amy Graham and (half) nephew, William Conley of Newstead, Brisbane, and any remnants remaining within his estate of his wonderful photography around Eltham appear to have been lost forever.\n\nAt least we still have his Bootmaker’s shop.\n\nPhotos by J.H Clark in the collection of Eltham District Historical Society.\n\nResearch and copy: P. Pidgeon, June 2022\n\n#ThrowbackThursday – Recently we received a donation of a book of Poems written by G. Davies in the early 1930s, a long time resident of Arthur Street, Eltham.\n\nGwendoline (Gwenda) Grace Watson Davies, only daughter of Mr. William Watson Davies and Mrs. Grace Davies (nee Hayes) of Arthur Street, Eltham was born in Newport, 18 February 1908.\n\nGwenda grew up in Arthur Street and when she left school was employed as an officer at the State Bank of Victoria, Chief Accountants Department, Head Office, Elizabeth Street, Melbourne.\n\nDuring 1933-1934 in her early to mid-twenties, Gwenda wrote a series of poems which were captured in three books: one a leather bound three-ring binder with personalised gold embossing on the cover and two paper booklets held together by pink ribbon. These poems are a reflection of her childhood days, home, her mother, her environment, pioneering days and other miscellaneous subjects including one example titled “EIGHTEEN YEARS TO-DAY”, an homage to the brave men of Gallipoli.\n\nOn October 20, 1937 after ten years of service, Gwenda submitted her letter of resignation effective November 26th as she was to be married in the near future to Fred Jones.\n\nFrederick Geoffrey Jones, born 7 January 1911, third son of Mr. and Mrs. W. Jones of Napoleon Street, Eltham, married Gwenda at the Eltham Methodist Church on 27 November 1937. They made their home at ‘Llangollen’, Arthur Street, Eltham, a new house Fred had constructed earlier that year opposite the Shire Offices. Their residence was recorded in the Electoral Rolls from 1963-1980 as 6 Arthur Street, Eltham which was situated on the corner of Arthur Street and present-day Commercial Place. In the 1970s their home was sold and demolished to make way for the new shops. They built a new home at the top of the hill in Bible Street.\n\nIn the Electoral Rolls for 1943-1980, Frederick’s occupation was recorded as a Plumber’s Assistant.\n\nFred was also a long-standing member of the Eltham Cemetery Trust. He was first appointed 26 April 1944 and resigned 17 July 1957 to be appointed to the Warringal and Eltham Joint Trust where he served till February 1980. He then re-joined the Eltham Cemetery Trust and served a further 14 years till his resignation on 24 August 1994. In total, Fred represented the interests of Eltham Cemetery for 50 years (1944-1994).\n\nGwenda and Fred were blessed with a son, Frederick William Jones in March 1942. Sadly, Frederick only lived two days and was buried at Eltham Cemetery on March 11. It is not known whether his grave is marked.\n\nA second son, Geoffrey Morris Jones arrived 25 November 1944 but he sadly contracted polio as a child. A fall down the front steps of Fred and Gwenda’s new home in Bible Street culminated in Geoff’s death from a heart attack whilst in transit to the Austin Hospital on February 6, 1979, at age 34. He was also interred in the Eltham Cemetery. Geoff was posthumously awarded the British Empire Medal for his services to fire safety at the CFA. A small man, handicapped from his childhood polio, he had figured prominently in the area as an active Apex member and as group officer for the 13 local brigades in the CFA Lower Yarra Group. His work for the CFA, all voluntary, included writing a fire-fighting manual and the innovation of aerial fire spotting and weekly fire reports. Gwendoline and Fred were presented with Geoff’s B.EM. award at Government House.\n\nFour years later on the anniversary of Geoff’s death, Gwenda could not sleep and collapsed in the hallway at home from a heart attack, 6 February 1983 at age 74. She was interred with her son Geoff, at Eltham Cemetery on February 9th. Fred died 31 July 1997 at age 86 and was also interred at Eltham Cemetery. A memorial plaque to Gwenda, Fred and Geoff lies within the lawn cemetery at Eltham Cemetery.\n\nIn February 2022 Gwenda’s book of Poems along with a copy of her letter of resignation from the State Bank of Victoria and a news clipping about the Autumn Show held in the Public Hall at Eltham (opposite her home with Fred) in which Gwenda is listed as having entered Cream Puffs and a Swiss Roll in the Cooking section, were donated to the St Vincent’s de Paul Society in Bega, N.S.W.. A dedicated volunteer there researched their origins and desirous for these items to return ‘home’, posted them to the Eltham District Historical Society for which we are most appreciative.\n\nEIGHTEEN YEARS TO-DAY\n\n“Tell me why you’re dreaming, Daddy”\n\nSaid my little son to me,\n\nSo, I told him all about it,\n\nAs he sat upon my knee.\n\nI told him of that Sunday morn,\n\n‘Twas eighteen years to-day,\n\nWhen the men of Australasia,\n\nJoined the mighty fray.\n\nHow they landed on that foreign shore,\n\nAnd fought the gallant fight,\n\nOf how they nobly won the day,\n\nAnd put the Turks to flight.\n\nWe saw the cliffs before us,\n\nTo be scaled ‘mid shot and shell,\n\nAnd our comrades fell around us – – – –\n\nI remember it – – – so well.\n\nThere are some who’ll sleep forever,\n\nOn a hill that’s called Lone Pine,\n\nAnd the twenty-fifth of April,\n\nIs famous for all time.\n\nAnd so to keep their memory green,\n\nWe march each Anzac Day,\n\nTo pay tribute to those Heroes,\n\nWho gave their lives that day.\n\n– Anzac Day 1933\n\nAnd in reflections to Gwenda’s childhood home in Arthur Street:\n\nHOME\n\nWhere do my thoughts ever wander?\n\nWhere do my thoughts always roam?\n\nTo a little old house, on the top of a hill,\n\nTo the place, that I call “Home Sweet Home.”\n\nNo matter where-ever I travel,\n\nOn land, or away on the foam.\n\nMy thoughts will return, and my heart ever yearn,\n\nTo the place, that I call “Home Sweet Home”.\n\n– 2/7/1933\n\nSources:\n\nBook of Poems, G.

Pidgeon, May 2022\n\n#ThrowbackThursday – Today we revisit an article recalling nearly 90 years of first-hand Eltham history as published in The Advertiser newspaper, 80 years ago on November 21, 1941.\n\nReproduced from Eltham and Whittlesea Shires Advertiser, Friday, November 21, 1941, pages 4-5 (via the National Libray of Australia’s Trove website)\n\nBLACKS CAMPED IN TOWNSHIP\n\nPROBABLY the oldest living pioneer of the Eltham district still resident there is Mr. Edmund Williams, who is over 91 years of age.\n\nMr. Williams was born in the Goulburn River district, but came to Eltham when a baby and has continued to live there ever since.\n\nAlthough he admits to his 91 years, Mr. Williams would pass for a man 20 years younger and still tends a small orchard and has excellent sight and hearing.\n\nHe is keenly interested in the development of the district; and considers that the new hall and offices will be a marked asset to Eltham.\n\nWith faultless memory, Mr. Williams recalled yesterday that 90 years ago Eltham consisted of heavily timbered bush country wherein friendly blacks used to roam at will.\n\n“As long as we provided them with food and tobacco there was never any trouble,” said Mr. Williams. “They used to ask us for rum, too, but we were careful never to give them that. They used to camp on a site between the original Eltham Hotel and the present Church of England sometimes for a week at a time. On those nights we used to have a great time throwing boomerangs.”\n\nHARD TIMES\n\n“The district was divided up into two acre blocks and people used to live in bark houses. Later, I bought a lot of these out and established a large orchard. I think this district was the ‘cradle’ of the fruit growing industry in Victoria. That came later, though.\n\n“The people of our parents’ generation had a very hard time here. They lived in poverty, really. We grew wheat and potatoes, and all they could do was to grow enough of these to provide enough flour to last through the next winter.\n\n“Bread and spuds. That was our staple diet in those days and we got heartily sick of it. But we thought ourselves lucky. As long as we got the bread, we didn’t ask about butter. There was no outside work available at all.\n\n“When we went to town, it took us half a day there and the same back. It didn’t give us much time there, but then we had so little money that it didn’t take us long to complete our business. The only meat we had, had to come from town, and even then we had to take just what we could get.\n\n“At that time,” added Mr. Williams, “There was a steam flour mill, owned by Mr. Henry Dendy who formerly had large properties at Brighton: a brewery and a tannery in Eltham. We took our wheat to the mill to have the flour made.\n\nBEER FROM CREEK WATER\n\n“The brewery used to use water from the creek to make the beer, and there were a dozen beer shanties between here and Kangaroo Ground that did nothing else but sell beer.\n\n“Ultimately, all these businesses were forced to leave this district because we had no railway and the cost of bringing the raw materials here by bullock waggon was too costly.\n\n“We had bush-rangers and cattle thieves to contend with, too. We couldn’t say anything to them, be-cause if we did they would pay us out at night.”\n\n60 YEARS IN ELTHAM\n\nMrs. Morris, widow of the late Mr. William Morris who conducted the hotel which was first known as the ‘Fountain Inn’ but which was later re-named the ‘Evelyn Hotel’, has been living in Eltham for nearly 60 years.\n\nFor 33 years, prior to its being de-licensed, Mr. and Mrs. Morris conducted the hotel. Mrs Morris recalled that in the year Glenloth won the Melbourne Cup, Mr. Morris went to the Cup for the first and only time. While he was away a party of picnickers just took possession of the hotel – and of Mrs. Morris’ baby – and did terrific damage.\n\n“Despite hard times – some days we might make 3d. and others 6d. – we lived and reared families,” said Mrs. Morris. ‘It was a struggle, but we got through. A lot of our business came from passing market gardeners and wood carters.\n\n“The roads could hardly be described as such. We travelled by coach from the Globe Hotel in Swanston Street and always changed horses at the Old England Hotel at Heidelberg. “Later I began catering, and soon built up a reputation. It was a renowned fact that ‘You could always get a good feed at ‘Morris’ Hotel.’”\n\nRACING CLUB – 1867\n\nCouncillor E. J. Andrew recalled that his father, the late Mr. W. B. Andrew, came to Eltham with his cousin, Mr. Henry Dendy who built the flour mill. Mr. Andrew senr., was also a member of the Eltham Council.\n\nMr. Andrew was secretary of the old Eltham Racing Club which used to hold meetings on the lower park. The first meeting was held on February 28, 1867 and the prizes were quite good.\n\n“The first market held in Eltham was, in 1875 and this flourished for a considerable number of years. Mrs. Andrew senr., with her first husband, Mr. Harper, used to conduct the ‘Fountain Inn’, and when Mr. Andrew came to Eltham he opened a business on the site now occupied by Mr. F. H. Collis. Councillor Andrew was born there more than 60 years ago.\n\nIn addition to being a business man, Mr. Andrew was a carpenter and builder and on April 24, 1862 he was presented with a set of tools by the citizens of Eltham in recognition of his work in assisting with the erection of St. Margaret’s Church of England.\n\nFIRST CRICKET TEAM\n\n“When he came here from Brighton, my father brought with him records showing that he was the first secretary of the Brighton Cricket Club and he also brought the records of the first matches played between Brighton and Melbourne teams,” said Cr. Andrew, “The matches took place between 1842 and 1847, and were the first record cricket matches played in Victoria. Since then my brother and I presented the records to the National Museum.\n\nCouncillor Andrew, referring to the bad state of the roads, said that in early times there was a toll gate at Lower Plenty. The cottage had since been removed and was now occupied by his sister, Mrs. Kilpatrick, in the Main street of Eltham. One of the four red gum posts which formed part of the toll gate was also there and still giving yeoman service.\n\nMrs. Kilpatrick recalled some of the early settlers in the names of Hollo-way (after whom the township was first named), Sweeney, Fawkner, Kilpatrick, Williams, Carrucan and Hannaford. The descendants of these families are still living in the district and Mr. Neville Burgoyne who is at present conducting the post office is a descendant of Mr. Hannaford. He is the fourth or fifth generation to conduct the post office.\n\nEltham has never been the scene of any particularly large gold discoveries. There has been gold found there, but it has chiefly been small amounts on private properties and not enough to cause a rush.\n\nLANDMARKS\n\nOf the landmarks in the Eltham district, probably the most notable is St. Katherine’s Church of England at St. Helena.\n\nThis was erected by Major Anthony Beale and named ‘Rose Chapel’ after his wife. Major Beale served on the island of St. Helena in the employ of the East India Company during the time Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled there.\n\nThe chapel was the first place of worship in the district and, probably, the first burial ground. Many of the pioneer settlers are found in the little graveyard.\n\nAnother, but much more recent landmark, is the War Memorial at Kangaroo Ground which was erected to commemorate those residents who had served in the Great War.\n\nA committee was formed under the title of The Shire of Eltham War Memorial League and after the memorial was completed a balance of £125 was handed over to the council.\n\nAt the wind up meeting it was decided to forward a letter to ex-Councillor Rutter informing him of the satisfactory conclusion of the work which was initiated by him as founder of the League.\n\nThe League then disbanded, but the Memorial Tower on the highest point in the district will stand for all time as a tribute to the heroes of the 1914-18 conflict.\n\nReference:\n\n1941 ‘EARLY DAYS RECALLED AT ELTHAM’, Eltham and Whittlesea Shires Advertiser (Vic. : 1940 – 1942), 21 November, pp. 4-5. , viewed 23 Oct 2018, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57495642\n\n#ThrowbackThursday – Brougham Street was created in Josiah Holloway’s 1851 subdivision of Little Eltham. It was one of several east-west streets shown on the subdivision plan as crossing the Diamond Creek. The western part was originally named Wellington Street.\n\nIt is not known when the first bridge was constructed in Brougham Street however it was certainly mentioned at Council’s meeting of 2 June 1884 as being in a dangerous state of repair. This photo (c.1895) of an old bridge shows a very low-level simple log girder bridge crossing the creek at a right angle. This bridge was generally known as Kaylocks Bridge or Kaylock’s Crossing after the owner of the adjoining land. It was most likely built from around the mid-1850s, or a crossing of some fashion was established, by Richard George Kaylock, butcher of Little Eltham, who with his wife Emily Ann settled there in 1854. His property was in Wellington Street (now Brougham Street) and apparently extended across the Diamond Creek. The land on the western side was farmed, the house being on the eastern side.\n\nKaylock’s Bridge formed part of the original coach road to Eltham and in 1922 was described as an “old rustic bridge”. Its low level and insubstantial construction made it susceptible to flood damage, necessitating frequent closures until repairs could be carried out.\n\nIn September 1922, Council called for tenders for a new timber bridge to be constructed at Kaylock’s Crossing. An engineering assessment carried out for the Council by Macleod Consulting, at the time of the replacement, based on construction details suggested it was built in the 1900s, however this dating could possibly have been the result of numerous repairs undertaken over the years to repair flood damage.\n\nThe tender was awarded to Mr Weller of Kangaroo Ground who commenced work in February 1923 on a higher-level timber trestle bridge. Work was slowed due to illness of the contractor and the accidental death of a man in March 1923, following the collapse of the bank after he had jumped into a hole that had just been blasted. The bridge was completed around July 1923 at which point the old structure was pulled up, marking what was described in the Advertiser newspaper as the passing of an old and well-loved landmark in the district.\n\nIn late March 1924 the approach to Kaylocks Bridge was washed away during the heavy flooding that also saw the temporary bridge in place for the destroyed the Main Road bridge deep under water. The western side was repaired, and an extra span added to the eastern side using timber from the destroyed Main Road bridge. Repairs to the bridge were completed and it was re-opened to traffic in early August, was again severely damaged, later in August 1924.\n\nWhen a lack of finances delayed repairs to the Bridge Street bridge in 1931 (also known at the time as Obelisk Bridge), traffic had to detour via Brougham Street for some time. Local residents feared the Bridge Street bridge might never reopen.\n\nKaylocks Bridge was constantly subject to damage by floods. In the record setting 1934 flood it was submerged by two feet of water. In more recent times the bridge was again severely damaged by flooding and repairs made. A new bridge and adjoining footbridge were constructed in 2009.\n\nResearch and text: P. Pidgeon, December 2021\n\n#ThrowbackThursday – The Eltham Hotel is the oldest continually operating hotel in the Eltham district. Initially referred to as the Little Eltham Hotel, it has been known as the Eltham Hotel since the mid-1850s through to the present except for a brief period as the Eltham Tavern in the late 1980s.\n\nBenjamin Oliver Wallis was a prominent Eltham resident, publican, and Councillor during the second half of the nineteenth century. He built the original Eltham Hotel and was its second owner for 27 years. He also built and owned the house that is now the Nillumbik Living and Learning Centre at 739 Main Road Eltham and one stage the Eltham Hotel.\n\nWallis, a mason by trade who originated from the Cornish village of Newlyn, migrated to Melbourne in 1853 but his wife and children remained in Cornwall for a further 10 years. Shortly after his arrival he was engaged by Richard Warren to build the Eltham Hotel, which opened in 1854.\n\nThe hotel was constructed of hard basaltic blue stone quarried in the Eltham district and cemented together with mud, and partly of bricks made at Eltham. The Fountain of Friendship Hotel on the opposite side of Maria Street (Main Road) opened shortly after. The hotel was a well-known resting place for gold diggers during the gold rush at Woods’ Point and Warren would buy the gold from the diggers.\n\nIn 1858 Warren fell into financial difficulties and determined to leave the colony, he advertised the hotel for sale in December, described as containing 14 rooms, with land attached, doing an extensive business, with particulars available from John Pascoe Poole at the hotel.\n\nBenjamin Wallis bought the hotel and obtained a publican’s licence in 1861. In the 1850s the Fountain had been the more popular hotel but under Wallis’s stewardship, the Eltham Hotel became more popular.\n\nIt is understood that in about 1857 Wallis also built a house at the western end of Pitt Street for tanner John Pearson. When Pearson became bankrupt in 1868, Wallis similarly acquired that house and lived there until his death in 1896. For some of this time the house was in the name of Benjamin’s son Richard but following his death in 1888, ownership reverted to his father. The house was ultimately acquired by the Shire and developed into the Living and Learning Centre.\n\nWallis was also a member of the Eltham Jockey Club and in 1867 his wife Anna rode her horse Charlotte in the Annual Races. Anna was a keen angler and is reported to have caught a large perch in the Yarra River. She died in 1887.\n\nOn September 16, 1886, Wallis sold the hotel to Christopher Watson (Snr). However, Watson died shortly afterwards in 1887 and the hotel passed to his son Christopher Watson (Jr) who owned it until his death in 1909 at which time his wife Emily took over the license. Upon her death, their son Herbert James (known as Jim) applied for the license in January 1915.\n\nIn July 1925, Jim Watson demolished the original building and, in its place, erected a modern hotel which remains the foundation of the present-day Eltham Hotel. The contractors at the time working on the demolition of the original hotel commented on how well the building had been constructed.\n\nA description of the new building was detailed in the Advertiser newspaper of January 8, 1926:\n\n“The new building consists of. two stories. designed in English tavern style, and contains-all told, 24 rooms. On the second floor, in front uninviting the two gables is a deep balcony, which will be much appreciated by visitors. The lower story is wholly of brick, and the upper one of wood and fibrous cement plaster. The rooms are spacious and lofty, and the windows are large and of latest style, and light the rooms splendidly. The entrance hall is 8 feet wide. The bar is a very commodious room and is furnished in the most up-to-date and convenient manner. The dining room, a very attractive apartment, is 30 feet by 15 feet 6 inches, and the bar parlor is also a large and well furnished room. A large cellar, an indispensable adjunct to an hotel, has been excavated beneath the bar. On the upper story are 12 bedrooms, and among other conveniences are two bath rooms in which hot and cold water can be used. All the rooms have been supplied with the necessary appliances for electric lighting, which will be one of the progressive evidences which Eltham will shortly enjoy.”\n\n“In the yard a brick garage to accommodate three cars at once, has been erected. This, as well as the hotel, is roofed with tiles.”\n\n“From the front of the hotel (especially the balcony) a lovely view of the country west and, north may be obtained.”\n\n“It may be added that it Is intended to have an ornamental garden, a tennis court. and a kiosk in connection with the hotel, and the property will have a rustic fence round it.”\n\nThe hotel has since undergone several modifications and extensions.\n\nIn the early days the hotel was a focal point for the Little Eltham community as a place for advertising, collection of mail and also meeting place for the Eltham District Road Board, forerunner to the Eltham Shire Council. Yard sales of stock and feed were conducted at the rear as well as liquidation auction sales. With the advent of the new building, it once boasted a beer garden and plant nursery at the rear.\n\nThe current appearance has remained the same since at least 2007, only the front sign has been updated since 2020 and a freshening of the painted timber work commenced in July 2021.\n\nEltham Hotel, July 2021 (Google Streetview)\n\nLicensed Publicans (known to date)\n\nResearch and text: P. Pidgeon, October 2021\n\n#ThrowbackThursday – In February 1965, Staffs Railway Store, the oldest business premises in the Eltham shopping district was demolished. Formerly a self-service grocery, restaurant and electrical repair shop, the building for many years housed Eltham’s only ‘family’ grocer and feed store. Earlier it had appeared to have been the town’s bakery. The building had been purchased in late March 1939 by Mr Eric N. Staff. At the time of E.N. Staff’s purchase there were huge bakers’ ovens located at the rear and the building also had a well and four toilets for employees.\n\nWhen the ‘pictures’ came to Eltham with the opening of the Eltham Public Hall across the road in 1941, Mr E.N. Staff extended the business and opened a milk bar and sweet shop. Further extensions re-established the tea rooms of days gone by. Mr E.N. Staff conducted business for about 15 years before handing over the reins to his son, Ray Staff.\n\nWhen his son Ray took over, the milk bar and tea rooms were closed for several years but the milk bar and was later re-opened and subsequently became a greengrocers and later again, a restaurant. The tea rooms section was converted to an electrical repair shop about 1955.\n\nElectoral Roll records for 1967 record Raymond Charles Staff at 929 Main Road, Eltham, grocer, and in 1968 at Lot 4, Hillcrest Avenue, Eltham, taxi truck operator. So it would appear that Ray continued to run the business for approximately two years after the original store was demolished and a new supermarket was built.\n\nToday, 929 Main Road is the Nongkhai Thai Restaurant and is precisely where the original Staffs store stood. Even though the facade has been modified at eye level with new larger windows, the upper facade is identical to that of the new Eltham Big Star Food Centre of 1965/66.\n\nBut how did the original building, the oldest premises in the 1965 era shopping centre come about? Well let us tell you about a man named Jed . . . well, Luther actually, so let us travel back further in time to 1902; August 12th to be precise, to the Eltham Courthouse.\n\nAppearing before T. Smallman, Esq,. Police Magistrate, and Messrs. W. Duncan and W.J. Taylor, Justices of the Peace is Luther Haley, baker. Wilfred Henry Johnston, by his agent Stanley Ernest Elder has applied for a warrant of ejectment under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1890 against Luther Haley from the bakery premises at the corner of Main Road and York Street.\n\nFrom the evidence presented we hear that Mrs Burgoyne of Eltham had purchased the property some months earlier from Mr Johnston, which consists of a store and bakery establishment at Eltham occupied by Mr. Luther Haley, and whose lease expired some little time back, and up to the present time, Mr. Haley was not prepared to leave. He informs the court that he is unable to secure at Eltham a suitable house in which to carry on his business, but he is now building a place near the railway station which he expects to be done in about three weeks time, and he is then prepared to give up possession of the premises he now occupies.\n\nMr Smallman informs the defendant, Luther Haley, that he will have to quit the premises in three weeks from the present date, and that a warrant of ejectment would be issued. However he also informs Mr Haley that he would order the warrant to lie in the office for three weeks from that date.\n\nThe premises under construction refered to by Luther Haley in court were situated on the western side of Main Road, near the railway station slightly opposite present day Arthur Street. It was opened around September 1902 as a General Store, Bakery and Tea Rooms.\n\nThis was the original building in the present day shopping precinct. At the time the only thing nearby was the railway station. Luther Haley’s business appeared to prosper and he would have catered to not only the locals abut also day visitors by train on Sundays coming up from Melbourne, offering fresh baked produce, tea rooms and summer drinks. The fields across Main Road running between present day Arthur Street and Luck Street were known as Haley’s Paddock and at times were used for community festivities and picnics. A newspaper report on the annual State schools picnic held at Haley’s Paddock on March 11, 1904 described it as “quite close to the railway station, and is quite capable of holding comfortably 10,000 people. With its ample shade shade and hilly surroundings, it is an ideal place for any gathering.” Unfortunately for Luther, just two months earlier his son, Leslie, aged 12 years had gone with a companion to bathe in the Diamond Creek and had accidentally drowned. But that’s another story.\n\nLuther Haley successfully ran his general store, bakery and tea rooms until 1917 when he and his family departed the district and moved to Westgarth Street in Northcote where he changed careers and became a publisher.\n\nIt was then taken over by Hannah Lloyd and became known as Lloyd’s Railway General Store from 1917 to 1920. From then it had a succession of owners, one as short as two months until March 31, 1939 when the Grocery Business formerly carried on by Mr. T.K. White of Eltham for the previous eight years was purchased by Mr Eric N. Staff of Research and became known as E.N. Staff’s Railway Store.\n\nThe ownership timeline for the store is as follows:\n\nLuther Haley Sep 1902-1917\n\nHannah Lloyd 1917-circa July 1920\n\nMessrs J.R. & N.E. Lee 1920-Sep 1922\n\nA. & E. Copeland Sep 1922-Sep 1925\n\nMr Price Sep 1925-Nov 1925\n\nMr Warren Nov 1925?-Nov 1926\n\nA.W.J. Edwards Nov 1926-1931\n\nT.K. White 1931-Mar 1939\n\nEric Staff Apr 1939-c.1954\n\nRay Staff c.1954-Feb 1965 then demolished\n\nRay Staff Eltham Big Star Food Centre c.1965-1967\n\nIf anyone has old photos of Staffs store or the shopping district, particularly in the 1930s through 1960s then we would love to hear from you. Perhaps you might consider donating them to the Eltham District Historical Society or if you prefer, we could borrow them and scan them at archival quality and then return them along with a digital copy.\n\nReferences\n\nELTHAM COURT OF PETTY SESSIONS.
