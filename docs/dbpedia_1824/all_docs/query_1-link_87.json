Whether you need more measurements, or if you'd like to know more of its history or how much we would charge to deliver it nationally, or ship it further afield (we are UK based) please do not hesitate to ask!\n\nWhen you have narrowed your preferred choice of timber flooring down to just one or two, we may be able to send you a sample of the timber in order you get a better feel for it. Please complete the form below and indicate the coverage you are looking for (i.e square metres). Obviously we can only send samples subject to availability and circumstance but we will try and get one to you if possible whether your selection is reclaimed or newly-milled."
