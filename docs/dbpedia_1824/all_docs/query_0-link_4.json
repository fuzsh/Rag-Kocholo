        "text": "Douglas Richardson\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nDear Newsgroup ~\n\nThere has been considerable discussion here on the newsgroup in recent time regarding Philippe Bonville, the alleged sister or daughter of William Bonville, Knt., Lord Bonville. Most of the discussion has sidestepped facts in favor of quoting whatever secondary source or website gives the poster the desired answer.\n\nThe assumption has been made repeatedly that Philippe Bonville must have been born say 1415, in order to make her a legitimate daughter of Lord Bonville and his 1st wife, Margaret Grey, which couple married in 1414. This is in spite of the fact that Lord Bonville had at least one acknowledged illegitimate child. No mention is ever made that Philippe might have been an illegitimate daughter of Lord Bonville. I assume that making Philippe Bonville be born c.1415 is done to give the poster the desired descent from King Edward I of England by way of Margaret Grey. However, I must say that that is approaching medieval genealogy from the wrong direction.\n\nWhile medieval genealogy is heavily dependant on chronology, it is also relies on the comparison of all facts which pertain to any question in hand. In this case, reviewing the chronology, we have three possible indications as to when Philippe Bonville might have been born. The 1st indication is when Philippe gave birth to her children. The second and third indications are the possible birth dates of her two known husbands, William Grenville, Esq., and John Almescombe, Esq.\n\nIn this case, we know that Philippe Bonville married William Grenville as his 2nd wife sometime in or after 1427, and that five children were born to this marriage which ended in 1447. While we don't know exactly when Philippe and William were married, but it seems to be rather close to 1427. 1428 would certainly be a good date for the marriage. Five children later, and that would place Philippe as age about 40-45 about the year 1438, or born c.1393-1398. Such a birth date would place her as a sister of William Bonville, Lord Bonville, whose father died in late 1396. Such chronology makes it impossible for Philippe to be a legitimate daughter of Lord Bonville by his wife, Margaret Grey, much less an illegitimate daughter of Lord Bonville.\n\nNext consideration. It is virtually certain that William Grenville was born no later than c.1385, as he was heir to his older brother, Sir John Grenville, who we know was Sheriff of Cornwall for the first time in 1404. As a general rule, men were age about 40 when they first became Sheriff. If so, that would place Sir John Grenville's birth somewhere between 1364 and perhaps no later than 1370. We know that Sir John Grenville was married before 1391, his wife being Margaret Burghersh, who was born about 1376 (aged 15 in 1391). If correct, even assuming there was a wide disparity in the respective births of John and William Grenville, William Grenville's birth would presumably be no later than 1390. This would make William Grenville approximately 3 to 8 years older than Philippe Bonville. That seems quite suitable for a typical medieval marriage. Even placing William Grenville's birth at c.1385, it would still make him only 8 to 13 years older than Philippe who was a second wife. This seems quite reasonable to me.\n\nNow we come to John Almescombe, Esq. We know that he was definitely an adult by 1450-1, when he occurs as the husband of Philippe Bonville. We have no information as to when he was born. However, it appears he was living as late as 1468, and definitely died testate before 1475. If we give him a long life of say 65-70 years in 1468, that would make him born c. 1398-c.1403, which would makes him a bit younger than Philippe Bonville. Such May-December weddings often occurred between medieval men and younger women, but I have seen the reverse, namely older women marrying younger men. A famous example is Katherine Neville and John Wydeville. In this case, the age discrepancy between Philippe Bonville and John Almescombe would not be so great, and perhaps even nonexistent.\n\nIs there other evidence which points the way to Philippe Bonville's correct parentage? Yes, there is. The published Visitation of Cornwall (H.S.P. 9) (1874): 84–86 (Grenville ped.) makes her the sister of Lord Bonville:\n\n“Willm Grenvile Brother and hey. to Sr John temp. H. IV. - Philip sist’ to the Lo. Bondvile.” END OF QUOTE.\n\nWe also know that William Grenville granted lands in 1447, to various feoffees, among them Hugh Stucle, Esquire. Hugh Stucle, Esq. can be readily identified as the younger half-brother of Lord Bonville.\n\nThese two pieces of evidence would tend to support the idea that Philippe Bonville was the sister of Lord Bonville and the half-sister of Hugh Stucle, Esq. Certainly the chronology supports that notion.\n\nIn contrast, we have the Grenville pedigree in Pole, Collections towards a Description of Devon (1791): 387–388, which reads:\n\n“Willam Grenvill his brother maried Thomazin, & unto his 2 wief Phelip, daughter of Willam Lord Bonvill, & had issue Sr Thomas ...”). END OF QUOTE.\n\nWhile I certainly respect Pole, he is not infallible. He makes Philippe the daughter of Lord Bonville. I should note that Pole was writing in a later period than the published visitation. In this case, I would give the visitation greater weight than Pole.\n\nWhile I'd certainly like to see better evidence, I think the evidence tilts towards Philippe Bonville being the sister of William Bonville, Lord Bonville. Thus she loses the descent from King Edward I of England by way of Margaret Grey. Having said that, I still have an open mind about this matter. Should additional evidence turn up, I'm more than willing to consider other possibilities. As a descendant of Hugh Stucle, Esq., I have a personal interest in Philippe Bonville.\n\nFor interest's sake, I've copied below my current file account regarding Philippe Bonville based on my original research.\n\nBest always, Douglas Richardson, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n+ + + + + + + + + + +\n\nPHILIPPE BONVILLE, married (1st) after 12 May 1427 (as his 2nd wife) WILLIAM GRENVILLE (or GREYNVILLE, GREYNEVYLE, GRAYNVILLE, GRAYNEFILD), Esq., of Bideford, Devon and Kilkhampton, Cornwall, younger son of Thebaud Grenville, Knt., of Bideford, Devon and Kilkhampton, Cornwall, by his wife, Margaret. Her maritagium included the manors of Week St. Mary and Swannacote, and other tenements in the hundred of Stratton, Cornwall. They had three sons, Thomas, Knt., John, Gent., and William, and two daughters, Margaret (wife of John Thorne) and Ellen (wife of William Yeo). He was heir in 1412 to his brother, John Grenville, Knt., of Bideford, Devon and Kilkhampton, Cornwall, Sheriff of Cornwall, 1404–6, 1410–11. WILLIAM GRENVILLE, Esq., was living 7 Nov. 1447, on which date he granted lands to James Chuddeligh, William Chuddeleigh, and Hugh Stucle, Esquires. His widow, Philippe, married (2nd) before 1450–1 (date of deed) JOHN ALMESCOMBE (or ALMYSCOMBE), Esq. In 29 Henry VI [1450–1] John de Copleston and others granted John and his wife, Philippe, lands in Wildhays and Guakmore. In 1455 Thomas Bodrugan, Esq., of Bodrugan, Cornwall, was pardoned for not appearing before the justices of the Bench to answer John and his wife, Philippe, late the wife of William Greynevyle, Esq. touching a trespass. In 1458 he and his wife, Philippe, presented to the church of Bideford, Devon. In 1461 he and his wife, Philippe, settled 23 messuages, 1 mill, and various lands in Kilkhampton, Cornwall, together with the advowson of the church of Kilkhampton, Cornwall, on themselves and the heirs of their bodies, with successive remainders to John Grenville and William Grenville. In 1464 he sued William Pyke, of Clayhidon, Devon, husbandman and five others in the Court of Common Pleas regarding a trespass [vi et armis] at Clayhidon, Devon. In 1464 he and his wife, Philippe, settled the manor and advowson of the church of Kilkhampton, Cornwall and the manor and advowson of the church of Bideford, Devon on themselves and the heirs of their bodies, with reversion to the right heirs of Philippe. In 1468 John Bele, of Shildon, Devon, butcher, was pardoned for not appearing to answer John Almyscombe, Esq., administrator of the good and chattels of John Ferlard, chaplain, touching a debt of 62s. 8d. JOHN ALMESCOMBE, Esq., died testate before Hilary term 1475. In Hilary term 1475 William Yeo and John Barnehowes, executors of John Almyscombe sued Peter Benet, Gent., of Eltham, Kent, in the Court of Common Pleas regarding the abduction of a minor ward, John Benet son and heir of Thomas Benet.\n\nReferences:\n\nPole, Colls. towards a Desc. of Devon (1791): 387–388 (Grenville ped.: “Willam Grenvill his brother maried Thomazin, & unto his 2 wief Phelip, daughter of Willam Lord Bonvill, & had issue Sr Thomas ...”).

Elizabeth Fitz Roger was born in 1370 and married as a child by 1377. As such, her four known Bonville children could conceivably be born anytime between 1384 and 1397 (year following her husband's death).\n\nDates of birth differ regarding Elizabeth's eldest son, William Bonville, later Lord Bonville. My file account shows he was born 12 August 1391, 30 Sept. 1391, or 31 August 1392 (aged 4 in 1397, 16 in 1407, 21 in 1414, 30 and more in 1426). Not sure why there are so many discepancies regarding his age but this is why you have to be careful relying on any one particular record for a person's age. I think a fair statement would be that William Bonville was born in 1391 or 1392.\n\nAs far as Isabel Bonville is concerned, she could have been born before William. I know Isabel Bonville's husband's parents were married by 1394, and probably much earlier. A rough estimate would put Isabel's husband's birth at c.1385-c.1390. As such, I don't see the need to squeeze Isabel's own birth into the period between 1393-1396.\n\nIf so, there is ample time to fit Thomas Bonville and Philippe Bonville as younger children of Elizabeth Fitz Roger sometime between 1393 and 1398.\n\n< If she were born within the time range of 1393 – 1397, this would be pushing <Philippa’s age close to or even into her 40’s while having children. It would <be highly unusual for a woman of Philippa’s social rank and position to marry <at such a late age in the early 15th century and have children in her late 30s <or even into her early 40s without proof or mention in history of her having a <previous marriage or children before William Grenville, Esq.\n\nThe only reason we know of many marriages in this time period is because of visitation records. Without visitations, many female marriages would go unnoticed. If Philippe Bonville had a brief first marriage which was childless, it would almost certainly go unnoticed in contemporary records. In this case, I assume that Philippe had an unknown first marriage before her known marriage to William Grenville. Is there evidence of such a marriage? No. Does that mean that such a marriage didn't happen? No.\n\n< As stated above, the role of Hugh Stucle in this transaction could have been a <myriad of different relationships; cousin, in-law, lawyer, and even UNCLE! The <appearance of Hugh in this group doesn’t confirm kinship; however, since we can <confirm Philippa was a Bonville, it does suggest that Hugh Stucle was of a <possible kinship to Philippa. We don’t know and can’t confirm the exact <relationship between Philippa Bonville and Hugh Stucle, as it can be used to <support the bias of whatever parentage someone favors to subscribe to for <Philippa.\n\nMany things are possible. But the most likely explanation is that Hugh Stucle, Esq., was Isabel and Philippe Bonville's half-brother.\n\n\n\nDear Whomever [deca...@aol.com],\n\nWould you mind sharing with SocGenMed your first name, or a nickname, or whatever name you'd like to be addressed by while we engage in this discussion?\n\nMy comments are interspersed.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 22, 2017 at 12:29:30 PM UTC-8, deca...@aol.com wrote:\n\n> Here are my references for Philippa Bonville, daughter of Sir William Bonville, K.G., 1st Lord Bonville!\n\n> References:\n\n> (1) Lake & Hotton.

And as Todd has already pointed out, Vivian makes Philippa the sister of William Lord Bonville in his Grenville pedigree.

In either case, it doesn't seem he researched these 15th-century Bonvilles and Grenvilles any further than the Visitation pedigrees.\n\nThat said, Vivian's works on the Devon and Cornwall Visitations contain much vital information once you get to the era of parish registers, and are weightier sources than Burke's.\n\n> (11) Rogers.

Serious genealogists and enthusiasts of medieval history know that the pedigrees presented within it are only as the cited sources.\n\nSo of your sixteen sources above, only two are of any use: 1) Granville's 1895 work (which indicates uncertainty as to Philippa's parentage), because of the 15th-century deed it cites (the next step for you would be to obtain a full transcription of that deed), and 2) Pole, your earliest cited source, though it's already been pointed out that Sir William contradicts an earlier Grenville pedigree, from a Visitation some fifty years previous, which makes Philippa the sister, not the daughter, of William Lord Bonville. Pole makes no indication in his work as to why he contradicts Philippa's parentage, or even if he was aware that he was doing so.\n\nSome weeks back when you first brought the topic to SocGenMed, I wrote: \"The Close Roll entry cited by HOP confirms that Bonville and Margaret Grey of Ruthin were not yet married when the contract was drawn up in December 1414, and that Bonville had until Midsummer to make the marriage settlement. But even if the marriage followed immediately at Yuletide, the earliest a child could be born to the couple is late 1415, and Thomas Grenville was apparently born by 1428.\"\n\nThis would make Philippa a mother at no older than age thirteen. Thomas Grenville was born by 1428 because “In 27th Henry VI (1449) he is styled Thomas Greynvile, son and heir to William Greynvile, Esquire, and with Anne his wife, grants to Richard Ashrigge a tenement in Bideford\" [Roger Granville, The History of the Granville Family (1895), p. 58]. Thomas could not have granted land unless he was of full age (21).\n\nYou replied: \"It is also very likely that Philippa Bonville married when she was between 12 and 16 years of age (which is historically possible), especially given the time period and her social standing, no matter if she were the daughter of John Bonville, Thomas Bonville, or William Bonville, 1st Lord Bonville. Saying that she gave birth to her first known child between the ages of 13 and 16 is both biologically possible and not uncommon for the 15th century.\" You then cited Lady Margaret Beaufort as an example of a lady married at age 12 and a mother at age 13.\n\nLady Margaret Beaufort was a great heiress and important dynastically to King Henry VI. She most definitely is an exception. Indeed, Tudor impregnating her at such a young age is believed by many historians today to be the reason that she had no further children after Henry VII, despite a very long second marriage. Philippa Grenville we know went on to have further children after her son Thomas.\n\nI'm sorry, but the chronology doesn't hold for Philippa to have been the daughter of Lady Margaret (Grey) Bonville. This of course doesn't prove that she was the sister of Lord Bonville, but there are several examples of medieval ladies not marrying until they were in their thirties. As a younger sister, there was no pressing need for Philippa to marry at all, and her mother (and later her eldest brother William Bonville) may have left it up to her to choose a husband. Whether the widower William Grenville was her own choice or that of her brother, Philippa was provided with a proper marriage portion.\n\nCheers, ------Brad\n\ndeca...@aol.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nMy comments are interspersed:\n\n> So of your sixteen sources above, only two are of any use: 1) Granville's 1895 work (which indicates uncertainty as to Philippa's parentage), because of the 15th-century deed it cites (the next step for you would be to obtain a full transcription of that deed), and 2) Pole, your earliest cited source, though it's already been pointed out that Sir William contradicts an earlier Grenville pedigree, from a Visitation some fifty years previous, which makes Philippa the sister, not the daughter, of William Lord Bonville.

If you care to check Douglas Richardson’s sources, you might find some overlap with the ones I listed. Second, I did not bring up the topic of Philippa’s parentage to SocGenMed, it was a poster named Joe. So, let's be clear about that. If you so prefer, you can simply refer to me as Deca.\n\n> Some weeks back when you first brought the topic to SocGenMed, I wrote: \"The Close Roll entry cited by HOP confirms that Bonville and Margaret Grey of Ruthin were not yet married when the contract was drawn up in December 1414, and that Bonville had until Midsummer to make the marriage settlement.

But chronology is still against it, as it leaves Philippa a wife and mother in 1428 at an age no older than 17-16.”\n\nDo you still believe that Philippa was the daughter of Thomas Bonville? Please provide your sources for this.\n\n> This would make Philippa a mother at no older than age thirteen. Thomas Grenville was born by 1428 because “In 27th Henry VI (1449) he is styled Thomas Greynvile, son and heir to William Greynvile, Esquire, and with Anne his wife, grants to Richard Ashrigge a tenement in Bideford\" [Roger Granville, The History of the Granville Family (1895), p. 58]. Thomas could not have granted land unless he was of full age (21).\n\n>\n\nFrom the Journal of Family History, Coming of Age and the Family in Medieval England, it states: “Medieval England similarly had a range of legal age restrictions, but in the lay courts, these were usually much more narrowly restricted to land tenure. The highest age—twenty-one—was required of males to inherit land held in military tenure (i.e., knight’s fees); for women inheriting the same type of land, it was fourteen if married, and sixteen if single. For land held in socage, more agricultural in nature, the age of majority for males was fifteen.”\n\nThomas Grenville did not have to be 21 to inherit or grant land for the Manor of Bideford, as it was not land held in military tenure.\n\nAgain, Thomas Grenville I could have been born anytime from 1429 – 1433.\n\nAccording to Weis, The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215 fifth ed.

As a younger sister, there was no pressing need for Philippa to marry at all, and her mother (and later her eldest brother William Bonville) may have left it up to her to choose a husband.

But chronology is still against it, as it leaves Philippa a wife and mother in 1428 at an age no older than 17-16.”\n\n> Do you still believe that Philippa was the daughter of Thomas Bonville?\n\nThe only \"belief\" I have on this is that Philippa didn't marry at age 12 and bear a son at age 13, so she was not the daughter of Margaret (Grey) Bonville. Beyond that, I'm open to any male Bonville of suitable age as her father.\n\n> Please provide your sources for this.\n\nI already did: Louise Staley suggested the possibility that Thomas Bonville was Philippa's father because Philippa named her son 'Thomas' (not 'William') Grenville.\n\n> From the Journal of Family History, Coming of Age and the Family in Medieval England, it states: “Medieval England similarly had a range of legal age restrictions, but in the lay courts, these were usually much more narrowly restricted to land tenure. The highest age—twenty-one—was required of males to inherit land held in military tenure (i.e., knight’s fees); for women inheriting the same type of land, it was fourteen if married, and sixteen if single. For land held in socage, more agricultural in nature, the age of majority for males was fifteen.”\n\n> Thomas Grenville did not have to be 21 to inherit or grant land for the Manor of Bideford, as it was not land held in military tenure.\n\nBideford, a port town in north Devon, was \"certainly one of the constituent manors of the Honour of Gloucester\" (Wikipedia), which in turn \"was one of the largest of the mediaeval English feudal baronies, in 1166 comprising 279 knight's fees, or manors\" (Ibid).\n\nThe fact that both Thomas Grenville and his wife Anne granted a tenement in Bideford in 1449 indicates that his father William Grenville had settled the manor on the couple jointly at their marriage. So both had to be of full age (he 21, she 14) in 1449.\n\n> Again, Thomas Grenville I could have been born anytime from 1429 – 1433.\n\nI don't understand how you determined that year range.\n\n> According to Weis, The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215 fifth ed.

The fact that the parentage of Philippa Bonville will go unsolved until hard primary source evidence is presented is the real matter here. There will always be assumptions made on both sides of the argument to support whatever methodology was used to support one's conclusion (chronological fine tuning, unnoticed marriages, family relationships, etc).\n\nThe fact that Mr. Douglas Richardson's position regarding the parentage of Philippa has shifted from early editions of his work to his new position found in MCS 5th edition is a testament to the fact that there are arguments on both sides which will move the proverbial tilt meter. Mr. Brad Verity uses a quotation from the often unreliable History of the Granville Family book (1895) by Roger Granville that he says is new evidence to him, while back in 2001-2002, both he and Louise Staley both knew about the book and were commenting on this book, including the same passages he was citing just in this thread. While all along, his position on the parentage of Philippa Bonville continually shifts (from William Bonville to John Bonville to Thomas Bonville, and etc). At least he is consistent in supporting the notion that she was at least a Bonville. As a side note, it is always refreshing to know that Mr. Douglas Richardson lists every supporting and opposing source evidence to his conclusions, just as he maintains an open mind on some controversial issues.\n\nI think we all know that Mr. Douglas Richardson was well aware of Charles-Fitch Northen's article (Revision of the Grenville pedigree) back in 1979 as Gary Boyd Roberts uses it as a source in one of his works. The issue of claiming credit for correctly identifying Henry II's mistress, Ida de Tony, I believe is what you specifically have in mind.\n\nWhy Fitch-Northen's article is now the Holy Grail concerning the parentage of Philippa Bonville is quite intriguing. Some may believe that Charles Fitch-Northen was infallible, while Sir William Pole was not infallible.\n\nThere still remain many amateur and professional genealogists who support the argument of Philippa being the daughter of William, 1st Lord Bonville, and just as many who support Philippa being the sister of William, 1st Lord Bonville.

Fitch-Northen was not infallible, and nobody is claiming that was the case. Indeed, specific errors and omissions can be identified within his paper (which I just received from Brad, via Joe - thanks to both of you).\n\nStill, he is a scholar who specifically studied the question and presented his reasoning and documentary support, and as far as I am aware is the only one to have done so in print.

Otherwise we are left with one panel that seems 'backwards' with regard to the direction of the 'known' marriage (a Grenville man marrying a Bonville woman), and the other that matches no known marriage in the Grenville line (a Grenville man marrying a Calmady woman, if that's what the arms are), whereas were we to arrange the Grenville/Bonville coats to match the 'sidedness' of the marriage, then it would be a Grenville daughter marrying a Calmady male, and given the incomplete nature of the Calmady pedigree in this period, this possibility seems more likely to have been overlooked than a Grenville marrying a Calmady bride.\n\n{And I say this knowing full well that the more panels I move or reverse, the more it looks like I am changing the data to match the hypothesis, which is never a good thing.}\n\n> I also think it must be a possibility that the two 'bend between mullets'\n\n> arms do represent Bonville. Junior branches of families often reversed\n\n> the tinctures or added an ordinary for difference.\n\nOK, but why would Yeo, who (at least according to the accepted narrative) married the daughter of Philippa, not just once but twice commemorate a junior branch of the Bonville family here even though they supposedly married a granddaughter of the senior branch, whose arms they already had as an exemplar? I just don't see a rationale for this. They don't even commemorate Grenville in these panels.\n\nOther than Yeo itself, the only arms among these lower panels that can be identified and also fits with the pedigree is Jewe, the lion. The eagle seems to be Bigbury, but I don't see any Bigbury/Yeo connection and their heirs married Champernowne and Durnford, neither of which match other arms here. Like on Hockey Night in Canada, mullets are not exactly rare, so I don't see the need to make this unidentified coat a junior line of Bonville when as far as I know (which isn't all that much) there is no association with such a junior line.\n\ntaf\n\ndeca...@aol.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nDouglas Richardson initiated this thread back on 20 February 2017 and presents his current file on Philippa Bonville. Richardson also provided a short reasoning behind why he placed Philippa Bonville as the sister of Lord William Bonville. He also laid\n\nout his three major assumptions for this conclusion.\n\nFirst, he assumes that William Grenville, Esq., and Philippa Bonville were married in 1428 (any later date would push the chronology a little too much for Philippa to be borne by 1396 and to have five children after her marriage). Additionally, all we know is that William Grenville and Philippa Bonville married after 12 May 1427. Did William and Philippa marry within a few years after this? Probably yes, but that could have been in 1429, 1430, or 1431. There isn’t any evidence to confirm they married in 1428. We know that their first born son, Thomas Grenville I, married Anne Courtenay in 1447 and they had to sue in the courts to grant a tenement to Richard Ashrigge in 1449. In this same tenement, William Grenville is mentioned as still being alive. Most estimates place William Grenville’s date of death in the year 1450, which includes Charles Fitch-Northen. This would suggest that Thomas was not of age (21 years old) in 1449 because the courts were involved, thus making Thomas Grenville 20 years of age or younger in 1449. We can then conclude that Thomas Grenville was born no earlier than 1429 and assuredly could have been born in 1430 or 1431 (which would follow along with the same reasoning and original date of birth estimate for Thomas Grenville being 1430 as found in Weis’ The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215 fifth ed. (1999): p. 30 [Line 22-11]). We also have a land grant from Thomas Grenville and his second wife to Richard Rede in the 31st Henry VI [21 Jan. 1453]. Since the courts were not involved, we can be quite sure that Thomas Grenville was of age (21 years old) in 1452, thus placing his date of birth around 1431.\n\nSecondly, Douglas Richardson assumes that Philippa Bonville had an unnoticed first marriage to explain why she was of such a late age (32 years old / assuming a date of birth of 1396 and a marriage date of 1428) upon her marriage to William Grenville, Esq., in the early 15th century. This is way too convenient to say in order to help fit her into the window of being Sir John Bonville and Elizabeth FitzRoger’s daughter, born between May 1393 and July 1397. Once again, since there is neither any primary nor secondary evidence to suggest a first marriage of Philippa before William Grenville, this makes it quite easy to concoct such a marriage for Philippa Bonville. We can estimate this date range (May 1393 – July 1397) given the proof of age for Lord William Bonville, which puts his date of birth at 31 Aug. 1392. We know through ipms that Sir John Bonville’s death occurred on 21 Oct. 1396. So following along the lines of this theory, if Philippa was born in 1397, Elizabeth FitzRoger would had to of conceived Philippa in the months just prior to John Bonville’s death (with John Bonville most likely being in ill-health for most of 1396 before his death in Oct. 1396). This is an unlikely scenario and thus would reduce the date range of Philippa’s birth to occur before 1397. We also know that Thomas Bonville and Isabel Bonville were also born between May 1393 and July 1397. Again, suggesting that Isabel was born before Lord William Bonville is an easy convention in order to allow more time for Philippa to be born within the time period after May 1393 and before 1397. It should also be noted that Elizabeth FitzRoger’s marriage agreement with her 2nd husband, Richard Stukeley, Gent., occurred on 6 Dec. 1396. Elizabeth FitzRoger’s ipm in 1414 gives her eldest son with Richard Stukeley a date of birth of 1398. Again, the evidence that Philippa had a marriage prior to William Grenville is as unnoticed as the invention that she did. There is zero evidence to suggest that Philippa had a prior marriage to William Grenville. Richardson’s own file account of Philippa states, “PHILIPPE BONVILLE, married (1st) after 12 May 1427 (as his 2nd wife) WILLIAM GRENVILLE!”\n\nFinally, Douglas Richardson’s third assumption is that Hugh Stukeley was the half-brother of Philippa Bonville because Hugh served as a feoffee for Philippa Bonville’s husband, William Grenville. Richardson states, “But the most likely explanation is that Hugh Stucle, Esq., was Isabel and Philippe Bonville’s half-brother.” Any student of history would know by looking at the lists of feoffees for the 15th century, just how many were the sibling-in-laws of the people involved! Was it more than likely that Hugh Stukeley was the brother-in-law or the uncle-in-law of William Grenville? It is unsupportable to use Hugh Stukeley’s feoffee status to conclude either relationship (brother-in-law or uncle-in-law) to William Grenville, other than just wanting it to be so.\n\nIn Roger Granville’s book, The History of the Granville family, he states:\n\n“In the 26th Henry VI. [7 Nov 1447], being styled William Graynefild, he grants lands to James (William ?) Chuddeleigh and Hugh Stucles, Esquires. The deed is dated 7th November, and thereto is appended two seals.”\n\nThere is no mention in the History of the Granville family, or in the deed itself of the exact relationship between William Grenville and Hugh Stukeley. It doesn’t say that William granted lands to his brother-in-law nor does it mention any other kind of kinship. But since we know that Elizabeth FitzRoger married Richard Stukeley after 6 Dec. 1396, we can presume there was a kinship between Hugh Stukeley and Philippa Bonville. There is nothing to say that Hugh Stukeley was not the uncle of Philippa Bonville, as we know it is fact that Hugh Stuckeley was the half-brother of Lord William Bonville. Again, Richardson wants Philippa to be the sister of Lord William Bonville, so it is more than convenient to say that Hugh Stukeley was Philippa’s half-brother.\n\nThese three assumptions make it convenient for Richardson to place Philippa Bonville as the sister of Lord William Bonville and the daughter of Sir John Bonville and Elizabeth FitzRoger. What Richardson fails to achieve is to provide any concrete evidence to support or confirm his assumptions. This would make his conclusion that Philippa Bonville was the sister of Lord William Bonville very suspect. Who is to say that Professor J. S. Roskell’s conclusion that Philippa Bonville was the daughter of Lord William Bonville and Margaret Grey inaccurate? According to the Proceedings of the British Academy, “His insistence on never going a step beyond the evidence, his profound distrust of speculation, and the down-to-earth commonsense of his Lancashire stock, gave his conclusions a solidity that commanded assent. He steered to successful completion the official history of The House of Commons, 1386–1421, which bears the imprint of his approach.”\n\nWe should trust the conclusion of Professor Roskell as it concerns the parentage of Philippa Bonville, because that is what all the evidence has ever supported.\n\nThose interested should also see:\n\n{Weis, Frederick Lewis \"The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215\" third ed. (1985): p. 16, [Line 22-10] (author states, \"Sir William Grenville, of Biddeford, d. c. 1451; m. Philippa, dau. of Sir William Bonville, K.G., Lord Bonville, of Chewton-Mendip, near Wells Somerset.\")}\n\nDouglas Richardson\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nDear Deca ~\n\nIn your newly \"revised\" pedigree of the Grenville family, you have made one cardinal error. You have created an extra generation in the Grenville family for which absolutely no evidence exists. That is simply put \"fake genealogy.\"\n\nI assume you have done this to make it appear that your William Grenville was born later than he was, in order to justify your belief that his wife, Philippe Bonville, was born later than she was. This \"de nova\" pedigree achieves you the royal descent from King Edward I that you so badly desire, but it has no basis in reality.\n\nI recommend that you stick to the known facts. One known fact is that there was only one William Grenville. He was born surely no later than 1385, and perhaps as early as c.1370, as his older brother, John Grenville, was a Knight of the Shire in 1388 and Sheriff in 1392. Men usually became Sheriff when they were about 40. Even assuming a younger age for John de Grenville as Sheriff, the earliest I think he was born would be c.1355. While it's possible the two men were half-brothers, we have no evidence to suggest that is the case. Assuming the two brothers had the same mother, the latest I would peg William Grenville's birth would be c.1385, assuming the mother gave birth to children over a 30 year time span (a la Queen Eleanor of Castile). A more realistic date for William Grenville's birth, however, would be c.1375-80.\n\nYou have yet another problem in your \"revised\" pedigree in placing the birth of William and John Grenville's father, Sir Thebaud de Grenville, at c.1345. Once again you are ignoring simple facts. It is certain that Thebaud (or if you prefer Tebaud) de Grenville was an adult in 1353, when he petitioned the king. For a record of this petition, see the abstract below taken from the online Discovery catalogue. The original petition can be accessed through the Discovery catalogue. Given that Thebaud was an adult in 1353, and given that his son, John, was an adult by 1388, Thebaud can hardly have been born c.1343. A more realistic birth date for Thebaud de Grenville might be c.1325.\n\nIndeed the following source places Thebaud de Grenville's birth as c.1323, which is very much in line with the chronology discussed above.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=Xt05AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA265\n\nFor your interest, below is an abstract to a Common Pleas lawsuit involving Sir Thebaud de Grenville, which shows that he was a knight in 1355:\n\nIn Easter term 1355 Thebaud de Grenevill, Knt. sued Walter de Merton the younger in the Court of Common Pleas in a Devon plea regarding a reasonable account of the time he was receiver of money for the said Thebaud.\n\nReference: Court of Common Pleas, CP40/381, image 8548f (available at\n\nhttp://aalt.law.uh.edu/E3/CP40no381/aCP40no381fronts/IMG_8548.htm).\n\nBest always, Douglas Richardson, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\n+ + + + + + + +\n\nSource: Online Discovery catalogue\n\nWeblink: http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9439882\n\nReference: SC 8/246/12276\n\nDescription:\n\nPetitioners: Theobald de Grenevylle (Grenville).\n\nName(s): de Grenevylle (Grenville), Theobald\n\nAddressees: King.\n\nNature of request: Grenevylle requests that the chancellor be commanded to seal his charter of pardon granted to him at the request of the earl of Salisbury for a trespass and an oyer and terminer.\n\nNature of endorsement: [None].\n\nPlaces mentioned: Devon.\n\nPeople mentioned: [William de Montague], Earl of Salisbury; John [Grandisson], Bishop of Exeter; [Hugh de Courtenay], Earl of Devon; John de Stonford (Stanford), justice.\n\nNote: The petition dates to 1352 as the privy seal warrant with which it was formerly enclosed dates to 28 October 1352 [26 Edw.

I offer the following SGM post where Richardson applied a supposed ‘Rule of Thumb/General Rule’ to women of an aristocratic rank marrying for the first time before they were 20 years of age. Interestingly in this thread, Philippa Bonville comes up where Richardson has consistently pegged her as being born by 1396 (see Weis, The Magna Charta Sureties, 1215 fifth ed. (1999): p. 29, Line 22-10). We only know that Philippa Bonville married for a first time, William Grenville, Esq. after 12 May 1427. The premise that she had an unnoticed first marriage to explain why she was over 30 years of age upon her marriage to William Grenville, Esq. is a clever creation and ‘fake chronological fine tuning’. This was done in order to justify her being born before 1397 and marrying William Grenville, Esq. in her early 30s.\n\nAs far as the statistical analysis done on the premise that ‘men were usually 40 years of age before they could be appointed Sheriff’ is just a broad assumption. Taking just 20 men and coming to an average might apply to a group as was mentioned, but it certainly doesn’t account for men who were a lot younger than 40 when they became Sheriff, or perhaps those men who were older than 40 when they became Sheriff. The possibility of men becoming Sheriff a lot younger than 40 is very real and I would be suspicious of the sample used for this statistical measure.\n\nAn example of Richardson’s 'Rules of Thumb/General Rules' are in the SGM thread below, which includes a question regarding Philippa Bonville.\n\nCheers~\n\nLE (aka.

Here's another example.\n\nLast year I participated in research on the Grenvilles of Cornwall and\n\nDevon. Philippa Bonville married as his second wife William Grenville\n\nafter 12 May 1427.

This would\n\nmake her a young teen at her marriage to William Grenville, which fits\n\nyour theory that women of her rank were married before age 20.\n\nBut Magna Charta Sureties and you yourself stated that Philippa was\n\nthe sister, not the daughter, of Lord Bonville. As Lord Bonville's\n\nfather died in 1396, this would make Philippa at least age 30 on her\n\nmarriage to William Grenville.\n\nWould a woman of Philippa Bonville's rank not marry until age 30?\n\n> If Amy was born after Peter de Gavaston's death, we need to consider\n\n> other possibilities.

The reason for supposing that there were two Theobalds, father and son, is the difference in their seals. The first was a seal circumscribed “Sigillum Theob de Grenville Mil.” in 1377, and the second in January 1379 bearing “Sigil Theobaldi de Grenvile militis.” Perhaps someone here can comment on whether or not this change in seal should be interpreted as two separate men or if old Theo just had a new seal made. I am also bothered by the idea that William Grenville was born “say 1385” if we are supposing his father was born in 1323 – I suppose 62 year old can have children but it is not the most likely solution (though I think William Grenville was born much earlier than 1385).\n\nRegardless, the real question here revolves around the dates of his sons, John and William Grenville. We know Theobald was dead by 26 July 1381, for on this date John Grenvile presented at Bideford, and he was described as “son and heir of Sir Theobald de Grenvile, deceased”. This record also tells us that John Grenville was of age, born by 1360, in 1381. Other records show he was licensed to have a private chapel at Stowe in 1386, he was a knight of the shire in 1389, 1394, 1397 and 1402 and he served as sheriff in 1391-1392. I don’t think these records are incompatible with someone born in 1360, though I also agree with Douglas that he was likely a few years older than this.\n\nWe have fewer records to pin down the birthdate of John’s brother William Grenville. Though as a second son do we really expect to find the same documentation? I am not sure we need to suppose that he was much younger than his brother or that he must be a half-brother. In 1402, his brother William styling himself William Greynvill, son of Sir Theobald, sets forth \" that whereas his brother, Sir John Greynvill, Kt., and Margaret his wife, held the manor and borough of Bideford in the County of Devon, with the advowson of the same church, and other lands and tenements in the parish of Bydeforde, called Fordeland, Eggeften, and Thorne, etc., and also held lands in Werdon and Stowe, in the manor of Kilkhampton, he, the said William Greynvill, ratifies and confirms them to the said Sir John de Greynvill.\" This record confirms his identity as a brother (full brother?) of John Grenville, and places his birth as by 1380, though again, there is no reason to think that he was not born significantly earlier. We also know that William Grenville was married to Thomasine Cole by 1403 and that she was still living and his wife in May 1427.\n\nThis brings us back to the question of could this William Grenville have married Philippa Bonville, daughter of William Bonville, Knt., Lord Bonville and 1st wife, Margaret Grey (married in 1414). What Deca is saying is that William Grenville at least age 47 (and probably significantly older) married Philippa Bonville in 1427 when she was at most 12 years old. And that, they had a son Thomas Grenville who would have had to of been born in 1428 (of age in 1449) when she was 13 years old.\n\nTaken together with the constraints on the Bonville pedigree, the theory that Phillipa Grenville was a daughter of William Bonville is impossible. If anything, she is a daughter John Bonville, and a sister of William Bonville, just as stated in the Visitations.\n\ndeca...@aol.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\n\n\nJoe of California,\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, Joe has taken snippets out of Charles Fitch-Northen’s article and Roger Granville’s, ‘History of the Granville Family’ book above. Both sources claim that there were two successive Theobald Grenvilles, father and son. The date of Theobald Grenville the younger’s death has been determined to be c. 1381.\n\nWhat Joe fails to inform SGM members is that Charles Fitch-Northen, who he is quoting above, believed that Sir Thomas Grenville I was the son of William Grenville and Thomasine Cole. Fitch-Northen stated, ‘was she the mother of William’s children? Unless we accept that Thomasine died in 1426, and that William immediately remarried a Bonville, we cannot make a Bonville mother of William’s heir.’\n\nWhat Fitch-Northen believed was that Sir Thomas Grenville I was born no later than 1426 and thus was the son of William Grenville and Thomasine Cole.\n\nThe question still remains. We know that Thomasine Cole was living in May 1427, but we don’t know when she died. She could have been still alive in 1428 and 1429. We also don’t know when William Grenville remarried. Did he marry in the late 1420s or the early 1430s? The simply answer is, we don’t really know. A marriage license or deed has never surfaced for William Grenville and Philippa Bonville.\n\nJoe of California said, ‘What Deca is saying is that William Grenville at least age 47 (and probably significantly older) married Philippa Bonville in 1427 when she was at most 12 years old. And that, they had a son Thomas Grenville who would have had to of been born in 1428 (of age in 1449) when she was 13 years old.’\n\nI never stated that William Grenville was 47 years of age upon his marriage to Philippa Bonville. I also never said that William Grenville and Philippa Bonville married in 1427. We don’t know when they married. They could have married in the 1430s. Such exact dates by Joe must mean he has found a deed or marriage license which proves a date of marriage for William Grenville and Philippa Bonville. We can also discern from Joe’s statement that he believes there were never any marriages at all in the medieval time period of men who were at least a generation or more older than the women they married, especially as a second wife.\n\nWe also can’t say that Sir Thomas Grenville I ‘would have to of been born in 1428’. There are no baptismal records, proofs of age, or ipms concerning Sir Thomas Grenville I. All we know is that Sir Thomas Grenville I married Anne Courtenay by license dated 7 Sept. 1447. So we can be certain that Sir Thomas Grenville I was at least 14 years of age upon his marriage to Anne Courtenay. This was the legal age to marry for males in England during the 15th century.\n\nTo fix exact dates to the marriage of William Grenville and Philippa Bonville and to the birth of Sir Thomas Grenville I without any concrete proof doesn’t make it so.\n\nIf Joe does have any evidence to confirm his assertions, other than quoting Fitch-Northen and Granville, we would all like to see it."
