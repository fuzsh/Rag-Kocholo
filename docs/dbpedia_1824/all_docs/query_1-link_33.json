        "text": "In December 1335, Edward III started negociations with Brittany so his brother John would marry Joan, Countess of Penthièvre (1319-1384). It came to nothing in OTL and Joan married Charles of Blois, Philip VI's nephew.\n\nWhen the War of the Breton Succession started in 1341, Philip supported Joan and her husband, and Edward supported Joan's half-uncle John of Montfort.\n\nIf John of Eltham marries Joan and survives, how could it affect history?\n\nFor starters you'll have France supporting Montfort and England supporting Joan/Eltham.\n\nAnd a much more logical choice it will be, since France supported the female claimant and England did the male claimant OTL!\n\nI think John of Eltham could be more successful than Charles of Blois, not getting captured at La Roche-Derrien in 1347.\n\nAnd a much more logical choice it will be, since France supported the female claimant and England did the male claimant OTL!\n\nI think John of Eltham could be more successful than Charles of Blois, not getting captured at La Roche-Derrien in 1347.\n\nAgreed there and with his military experience already he might get some positive results\n\nAgreed there and with his military experience already he might get some positive results\n\nAn Eltham/Montfort duel would be more balanced than Blois/Montfort.\n\nAlso, Edward III supported Montfort OTL because Breton support was needed in his war against France and Philip was already supporting Joan and Blois. But with Joan married to Eltham, Edward would at once push for them to be acknowledged as Duke and Duchess.\n\nAn Eltham/Montfort duel would be more balanced than Blois/Montfort.\n\nAlso, Edward III supported Montfort OTL because Breton support was needed in his war against France and Philip was already supporting Joan and Blois. But with Joan married to Eltham, Edward would at once push for them to be acknowledged as Duke and Duchess.\n\nAgreed and their claim would be superior\n\nAgreed and their claim would be superior\n\nVery true. And Brittany had already had four duchesses!\n\nAm I wrong to think France is the only country that barred women from the succession?\n\nVery true. And Brittany had already had four duchesses!\n\nAm I wrong to think France is the only country that barred women from the succession?\n\nAustria and Prussia also aha\n\nAn idea of family tree for Joan and John:\n\nJoan of Penthièvre, Duchess of Brittany (1319-1384) m. John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall (1316-1379)\n\nMarie of Brittany (b.1337)\n\nJohn IV, Duke of Brittany (b.1339) [1]\n\nStillborn son (1340)\n\nEdward, Count of Penthièvre (b.1345)\n\nJoan of Brittany (b.1345)\n\nGuy of Brittany (b.1346)\n\nArthur of Brittany (b.1350)\n\nConstance of Brittany (1351)\n\n[1] Or John V if John of Montfort is considered a Duke during the War of the Breton Succession"
