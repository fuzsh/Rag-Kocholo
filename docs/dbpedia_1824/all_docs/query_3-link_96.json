A true story!\n\nCan you help the Eltham and District Historical Society?\n\nTo start … where were you on the Friday evening or Saturday morning of August 3 — 4, 2013? Why this question? Read on and then hopefully, you can help to fill in some blanks.\n\nA weathered headstone, broken into three parts, reappeared on that August night in a soggy cardboard box leaning against the main entry to Eltham Cemetery in Mt. Pleasant Road, Eltham. The maintenance staff at the cemetery carefully removed the dark green fungus to show the inscription which reads:\n\nPeter Lawlor\n\nWho died February 12th 1876\n\nAged 55 years\n\nAlso his children\n\nMichael\n\nMargaret\n\nMaud\n\nand Edith\n\nThe headstone belonged to the 1876 burial of Senior Constable Peter Lawlor who was the first police officer in charge at the Eltham Police Station when it opened in 1857. His registration number was 668 and he served here from 1857 to 1872.\n\nHis wife was Catherine (Kate) Ledwedge but we have no records of her other than on the birth records of her children.\n\nFrom the headstone, we do know that Peter Lawlor’s children who died young were Michael, Margaret, Maud and Edith.\n\nAs you now walk past site 22 in the cemetery, you will notice that a bluestone base remains with a centre grooved indent retaining most of the bottom edge of the headstone. The three recovered parts have been attached to a heavy wooden board and lie on the grave at site 22.\n\nResearch by the cemetery trust secretary using their records, found that Peter Lawlor purchased the Catholic Church site number 22 for one pound on 2 March, 1862.\n\nFurther research about the family has found that:\n\n• Peter Lawlor, who died aged 55 in 1876, had the middle name of Paul and his parents were Daniel Lawlor and Bridget Mulhall.\n\n• Peter and Catherine’s son who died young was Jeremiah Michael Lawlor. He died in 1860 and his parents were recorded as Peter and Kate (no surnames given).\n\n• Their daughter Margaret Sarah Lawlor who died in 1862, has parents recorded as Peter Lawlor and Catherine Ledwedge.\n\n• Daughter Maude Kate Lawlor, who also died in 1862, whose parents are recorded as Peter Lawlor and Catherine Ledwedge.\n\n• Baby daughter Edith Beatrice Lawlor who died in 1873, age one, has parents recorded as Peter and Kate (again no surnames given).\n\nThe school records held by Eltham Primary School (copies are with the Historical Society) show the enrolment records of four other surviving Lawlor children who attended Eltham Primary School between 1864 and 1872.\n\nNAME Roll No. Period of Enrollment.

Any clues to the mystery are better than nothing.\n\nIn 1984 the Genealogical Society of Victoria published a book of cemetery inscriptions in our part of Victoria. The Eltham Cemetery entry was undertaken by three local ladies who copied the inscriptions of the headstones from 1863 to 1947 … and the Peter Lawlor headstone was there in 1984 but by 1985 it had ‘disappeared’ when the current Eltham Cemetery secretary surveyed the headstones in the cemetery.\n\nSo the headstone ‘went for a walk’ sometime after 1984, we know it had gone in 1985 … and then it returned in 2013! It has been missing at least 38 years. Can you help?\n\nThe Eltham District Historical Society keeps records of early Eltham people and any additions to this ongoing story are welcome.

A History.\n\nThe First European Settlement in Eltham\n\nEltham, 1840. The first ongoing White settlement of the Port Phillip District had taken place only 5 years before – in 1835. The Wurundjeri people still occupied this land, where they built temporary shelters, hunted possum and kangaroo and eel, and held corroborees.\n\nIn 1839, an Assistant Surveyor with the unfortunate surname of Nutt had surveyed what was to become Eltham into square mile grids. Over the next decade, the settlers began to arrive and take up the land.\n\nWho were these early settlers? What were their lives like? What brought them here? What kept them here? What were their aspirations? What were their hopes and dreams?\n\nThey arrived on this new frontier – farmers, merchants, innkeepers, labourers and their families. By 1850 there were perhaps 280 of them. By all accounts, this was one of the poorer districts in Port Phillip, a tiny outlying community. The historical record provides little detail about the majority of these early settlers.\n\nBut we do know something of the life of one of these people. He was the first to purchase land in the Shire of Nillumbik; it was a one hundred acre property on the river flats beside the Yarra. He is regarded as Eltham’s first resident. He was an Irishman, from County Tipperary. His name was Thomas Sweeney. He built a house that he named Culla Hill on the land in 1846 or thereabouts. It is still standing. He was the second signatory of a letter to the National Schools Board, seeking to create a primary school in Eltham.\n\nAn unmade winding road named Sweeney’s Lane is one tangible reminder that he once lived and worked the land here. That he lived to put his name to the letter of request to the National Schools Board is a small miracle. He should have never have been in Australia; by rights, he should have been hung in Ireland in 1823.\n\nThomas Sweeney\n\nThe earliest European resident of Eltham\n\nLIFE IN IRELAND\n\nNo life is simple to understand. Each of us is shaped by the society in which we are born and bred, the conditions of the time, by our parents and their nurturing of us, by our schooling, and by the company we keep and the values we espouse.\n\nThomas Sweeney was the son of lowly tenant farmers, in County Tipperary in the south of Ireland. He was born in 1803, two years after the union of England and Ireland became law. In his book, The Great Hunger, historian Cecil Woodham Smith writes of Ireland in the 1800s:\n\n‘The state of Ireland was, as it had been for nearly seven hundred years, a source of grave anxiety to England.’\n\n‘There never was a country in which poverty existed to the extent it exists in Ireland,’ wrote the Duke of Wellington. In the first half of the 19th Century, nearly half the rural population of Ireland lived in ‘windowless mud cabins of a single room’. Smith describes the conditions in these ‘homes’:\n\nPigs slept with their owners, manure heaps choked doors, sometimes even stood inside; the evicted and unemployed put roofs over ditches, burrowed into banks, existed in bog holes.\n\nThe Devon Commission, in its report on the lot of Irish labourers and their families, referred to\n\n‘the privations they habitually and silently endure … in many districts their only food is the potato, their only beverage is water … their cabins are seldom a protection against the weather … a bed or blanket is a rare luxury … and nearly in all their pig and a manure heap constitute their only property.’\n\n… . their only food is the potato,\n\ntheir only beverage is water … a bed or\n\nblanket is a rare luxury …\n\nAbsentee English landlords demanded high rents, and the Irish tenant farmers and rural labourers – and their families – starved. Those who couldn’t pay were evicted. In the years when the potato crop failed, many died of starvation. There were crop failures in 1822 and 1823.\n\nBut not all Irish people ‘habitually and silently endured’ this treatment.\n\nSecret societies … became widespread… and a succession of underground associations, Oak Boys, White Boys and Ribbon Men, gathering in bogs and lonely glens, flouted the law and dispensed a people’s justice in the terrible form of revenge. The informer, the supplanter of an evicted tenant, the landlord’s men, were punished with dreadful savagery… Cattle were tufted, driven over the edge of a cliff, horses hamstrung, dogs clubbed to death, stables fired and the animals within burned alive.\n\nWHITE BOYS AND RIBBON MEN – THE ATTACK ON CULLAHILL\n\nBy the age of 20 years, Thomas Sweeney was a member of the White Boys. The Ribbon Men and the White Boys were rural guerrillas, committed to fighting for social justice – which meant fighting the landlords. The Ribbonmen wore ribbons in their hats during their raids, as a sign of their membership. They met at night, and in high secrecy.\n\nTo modern ears, the White Boys oath of allegiance may sound a little strange – like something out of a Boys’ Own comic, or a 19th century adventure novel. But there was nothing of boyish adventure in what they did; if caught they faced a terrible punishment. Their oath read, in part:\n\nI do hereby solemnly and sincerely swear, that I will not make known any secret now given to me, or hereafter may be given, to anyone in the world, except to a sworn person belonging to the Society called White Boys …\n\nFurthermore, I swear, that I will be ready, at an hours warning…\n\nFurthermore, I swear, I will not do wrong any of the company I belong to … nor to suffer it to be done to others .\n\nFurthermore, I swear, I will not make known … to any person who does not belong to us, the name or names of any of our fraternity… Lastly, I swear, I will not drink of any liquor whatsoever whilst on duty.\n\nThis final clause in the oath is perhaps the clearest sign of just how important this commitment was. Given the legendary reputation of the Irish for the over-consumption of alcohol, the pledge to ‘not drink of any liquor whatsoever whilst on duty’ pointed to the high seriousness of the White Boys’ cause.\n\nAround midnight on Sunday 2 March 1823, Thomas Sweeney was one of several White Boys involved in an attack on the house of Patrick Guyder at Cullahill, Parish of Bourney, in northeast Tipperary. Michael Connors, a 26 year old who styled himself ‘Captain Rock’, led the group. The details are not totally clear, but the story goes something like this:\n\nPatrick Guyder had promised to provide the group with guns, but when they arrived, Guyder said the guns weren’t ready. He told the men he would give his oath to have the guns for them on a future night but they were not prepared to accept this promise.\n\nThe White Boys demanded to be admitted to the house, but Guyder refused. They accused Guyder of being a landlord’s man, and of serving the oppressors; they threatened to burn his house to the ground. They smashed the door and broke windows. According to testimony at the trial that followed, ‘Thomas Sweeny had the tongs in his hand with which he applied the fire to the thatch.’\n\nEditor’s Note:\n\nThe name Sweeney is spelled in a variety of ways in the historical record: for example, Sweeney, Sweny, Sweeny. Where the historical record is directly quoted, we use whichever spelling is documented; otherwise, the Sweeney spelling is used.\n\nWhat Connors and his men didn’t realize was that they had been ‘set up’. Police had been stationed in an out building; they had been alerted to the intended attack. They rushed out and ‘secured two of the principals’: Michael Connors and Thomas Sweeny. who had been identified as one of the party.Next morning they took into custody Thady Coomion\n\nOn Tuesday 28 March 1823, at the Clonmel Spring Assizes, Michael Connors and Thomas Sweeny were convicted under the Whiteboy Act, ‘for a felonious assault on the house of Patrick Guyder, at Cullahill, and with having set said house on fire.’ The list of sentences states that Michael Connors and Thomas Sweeny, ‘for assaulting a habitation, between sun-rise and sun-set’ were to be hanged on 26 April.\n\nPatrick Ryan – another local farmer – and his brother were paid ten pounds and five pounds respectively for informing on the White Boys gang. The arresting police were also rewarded.\n\nLIFE TRANSPORTATION TO THE COLONY\n\nOF NEW SOUTH WALES\n\nAs it turned out, the two arsonists were not hung; instead their sentences were commuted to Life Transportation to the Colony of New South Wales.\n\nSweeney and Connors were imprisoned on the hulk Surprise in Cork harbour prior to being taken on board the convict transport Isabella. They were possibly on the hulk for as long as four months, and we know from the surgeon’s report that some of the convicts were in poor health. Hulks were old ships with cut down masts, fitted out as floating prisons. Surgeon William Rae, writing in his journal, commented on the prisoners as they first appeared to him:\n\nWhen they embarked at Cork from the Surprise Hulk, many of them laboured under Catarrhal complaints which were attributed to the severity of the season and the very insufficient state of clothing in which I observed many of them to be in. One man indeed had only a blanket to cover his nakedness and another a ragged shirt and trousers with only one limb to them – no shoes or stockings. The most of them however, appeared healthy in other respects and I hoped that by better clothing, care and gentle means those complaints would soon disappear.\n\nSydney at this time was a well-established city with many fine public buildings. A few of these, such as the Military Hospital and the Hyde Park Barracks, are still standing today. There were streets of stores and shops and, on the slopes overlooking the harbour, fine villas and rows of cottages.\n\nBehind the orderly facade it had a wild and exotic character, especially in areas such as the Rocks, the haunt of all sorts of adventurers and scoundrels.\n\nSweeney was selected to become an assigned servant to James Chandler, a young man of means and of good Christian character. In the muster written at that time, Sweeney is described as a ploughman, five feet eight inches tall, with dark grey eyes, brown hair and a brown complexion. The remarks on how he behaved on the voyage read ‘very well’. A John Gunning, also a ploughman, was similarly assigned to James Chandler.\n\nChandler’s property at Botany was called Bexley, after his native home in Kent. In all, it was 1,300 acres, but mostly undeveloped. No doubt this is why Chandler chose two ploughmen. Thomas Sweeney lived in a ‘Men’s hut’. During these years he makes a brief appearance in the historical records: he was robbed. On Sunday 11 April 1824, someone stole two Savings Bank Receipts from him and forged his name on the back so they could cash them. James Chandler offered ‘Ten Dollars Reward’ – in those days that meant ‘holey dollars’, those Spanish gold coins with the centres punched out, used by the New South Wales authorities because of a shortage of minted coinage.\n\nAfter a short time, James Chandler leased his farm and became a catechist. He was soon working on the Hawkesbury River seeking to save the souls of the mixed bunch of settlers who lived in comparatively isolated areas.\n\nSweeney was reassigned to a John Brown at Liverpool. Brown had arrived as a convict in 1813 on the Archduke Charles, and in time became a farmer and a publican. By 1828, Sweeney was with settler George Brown at Dapto near Lake Illawarra. This was a wild area at that time, with farms interspersed between great stands of forest. The cedar in these lush subtropical forests was an attraction to all kinds of characters, many of them hiding out from the law and cutting cedar illegally.\n\nTICKET OF LEAVE\n\nReceiving a ‘Ticket of Leave’ in 1831 was the real beginning of Thomas Sweeney’s new life. The author Alexander Harris became Clerk to the Resident Magistrate at Wollongong in the early 1830s. He would have known Thomas Sweeney as a regular visitor to the office, this being one of the conditions of ‘Ticket of Indulgence’ holders. Of men like Thomas Sweeney he wrote:\n\nAs clerk of the Court through which they applied to have tickets-of-leave, I had an opportunity of learning the nature of the original offences of many of the prisoners. I was astonished by discovering that a very large proportion of the Irish convicts were under sentence, not for immoral delinquencies, but for such as were of a purely political sort. They were, in fact, martyrs of patriotism as strictly as either Kossuth or Mazzini, or the men exiled by the present Emperor of the French. Yet they were subjected to the one degrading and galling discipline with the most obscure and ruffianly of malefactors.\n\nAround ten per cent of Irish convicts could be categorised as social rebels or political prisoners; the overwhelming majority had committed petty crimes such as stealing – often a result of the desperate poverty in which they lived. Thomas Sweeney had been a social rebel, a political activist. Once convicted, however, he seems to have been well behaved and keen to gain a good record. His Ticket of Leave is dated 31 July 1831 and required him to stay in the district of Illawarra. A freer man, though, he began a new life – as a boatman, a trader in cedar and other goods.\n\nTHOMAS SWEENEY — COASTAL TRADER\n\nWithin six months, Sweeney had purchased a boat — the eleven ton Mary Ann — and was carrying goods between the Illawarra district and Sydney Town. Mention is made of Sweeney in a diary written in 1833/34: the diarist observes that Thomas Sweeney carried letters and parcels, goods in boxes and barrels, bags of grain and even gunpowder, bags of shot and percussion caps for guns. Shipping records show that the Mary Ann made over 20 trips during 1832. In early 1833 he purchased a larger boat — the 14-ton Venus.\n\nThomas Sweeney met Bridget Coleman in Sydney, and they married in February 1833. Convicts granted a Ticket of Leave did not have full freedom; in order to marry, Sweeney had to have official permission. Indeed, official permission was required in relation to the kind of work an ex-convict could undertake, and there were restrictions too on how far they might travel.\n\nBridget Coleman had come to Australia as a free woman, not as a convict. She was ten years younger than Thomas. She worked for a time as a domestic servant.\n\nTicket of Leave men, like Sweeney, were required to submit a ‘Memorial’ —a sort of testimonial to their good character — when changing their employment.\n\n‘The Memorial of Thomas Sweeney of Woolongong’, dated Thursday 1 August 1833, tells us that he had, through hard labour, acquired means which he appropriated to the purchase of one hundred acres with fifty head of cattle and a half share in ‘a Boat called Sarah now in full Trade between here and Sydney’. He bears a most Excellent Character as being an industrious and Honest Fellow.\n\nFrancis Allman J.P. the Resident Magistrate, wrote:\n\nI believe Thomas Sweeney to be a very honest man and if the existing regulations allow of any Ticket of Leave man to manage a boat between this and Sydney, I feel bound to recommend him for that indulgence.\n\nThe Governor’s decision given on August 22nd reads:\n\n‘I see no objection to this man being allowed a similar privilege to the Bathurst and Argyle Carriers in being permitted to trade to and fro’.\n\nHenry Osborne, a noted settler, gave him the following glowing reference:\n\nThe Petitioner since I knew him has done business for me by conveying in his Boat goods to and from Sydney and I always found him most correct. He bears a most Excellent Character as being an industrious and Honest Fellow\n\nThomas and Bridget Sweeney had two children:\n\nMary, born 1833 Patrick, born 1835.\n\nSometime between 1835 and 1837, Bridget died. According to Sweeney family lore, she drowned in the Parramatta River. (Some sources suggest she drowned in Port Jackson.) It is believed that their son Patrick may have drowned as well – although there is no clear evidence.\n\nSOUTH TO THE PORT PHILLIP DISTRICT\n\nIn February 1838, Thomas was granted a conditional pardon. He remarried in April of that year to Margaret Meehan. In September, the Sweeneys arrived in the very new settlement on the Yarra at Port Phillip. Melbourne’s population was only a few thousand and many of the buildings were still only temporary shelters.\n\nIn July 1840, Thomas Sweeney was granted a licence to depasture stock on the south side of the Yarra, about seven miles from Melbourne. He was, at that time, a squatter, and by 1843 had planted crops on a property in an area known as Merri Merri Creek.\n\nTHE PURCHASE OF LAND IN NILLUMBIK SHIRE\n\nIn 1842, he applied to Superintendent Latrobe to purchase land. By May 1844, the purchase had still not been finalised, but he eventually paid 100 pounds for 110 acres in the Parish of Nillumbik. The official transfer was finalised in June 1846. By then Sweeney had built a slab hut, roughly 12 feet by 15 feet, on the land.\n\nThe second building was a three-roomed detached cottage. The main house is believed to have been built later. The barn, an outstanding construction of stone and brick, is said to have had a thatched roof that was later replaced with corrugated iron; it still stands on the property.\n\nWhile other men were seduced to try their luck prospecting for gold, Thomas Sweeney chose to carry goods to the goldfields, and prospered as a result. The prices of meat, potatoes and grain went to unheard of levels. Thomas soon had enough money to purchase two more blocks of 158 acres each. They were allotments 2 and 3 of section 6 Parish of Nillumbik and were transferred to Thomas Sweeney from the Crown on June 18 1856.\n\nThomas and Margaret Sweeney were the first freeholders to settle in what is now Eltham, although others soon followed them. The Scottish settlement at Kangaroo Ground was established in the early 1840s and Thomas was on good terms with other settlers. He was soon a leading figure in the district, petitioning the authorities for improved roads and the construction of bridges.\n\nWhen the Eltham School was established, he became a member of the Board of Local Patrons.\n\nHis son-in-law, John Murray, was also a member. Mary Sweeney, Thomas’ daughter, born in Sydney about 1833, had married John Wright Murray in 1849 – when she was 16 or 17 years of age.\n\nMurray was born in 1816 in County Down, Ireland; he was 33 when they married. He died in Eltham on 19 December 1867. He was said to be a runaway sailor; this may have been a euphemism for ex-convict. Like his father-in-law Thomas Sweeney, John Murray was on the Board of Patrons to Eltham Primary School during its early years. He is recorded as being a farmer.\n\nThe marriage seems not to have been an altogether happy one. He was a drinker, and after his death Mary is said to have commented: ‘Wasn’t I glad the night I was a widder.’\n\nWasn’t I glad the night I was a widder.\n\nThey had 9 children: Bridget Cecilia, John, Patrick, Thomas, Patrick Bernard, Mary Ellen, Thomas, William Louis James Augustine.\n\nMary died on 7 September 1909 in Eltham, Victoria, and was buried in the Eltham Cemetery. The children attended Eltham Primary 209.\n\nTHOMAS AND MARGARET SWEENEY’S DESCENDANTS\n\nThomas and Margaret Sweeney had several children: Patrick II, born in Sydney, 1838 Twins Catherine Agnes and Margaret Augusta, born at Yarra, 1841 John Francis, born at Diamond Creek, 1844 Ann Marie, born at Yarra in 1848 Johanna Marion, born at Heidelberg (sic) in 1849.\n\nInterestingly, Thomas Sweeney chose to name his Nillumbik property Culla Hill. Perhaps it was nostalgia for Ireland; or perhaps it was his way of reminding himself how far he had come. By the late 1840s, Thomas Sweeney was a well-respected, civic-minded landowner. His name appears on the petition for the building of a bridge over the Plenty River, and of course, he supported the application made by David and Catherine Clark for the creation of a National School in Eltham. Had he remained in Ireland, he may well have suffered the same fate as so many Irish people in the late 1840s, when the Potato Famine resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of the rural poor of Ireland – Irish labourers and their families. Over a million Irish people perished or migrated as a result of the Great Hunger.\n\nOn July 15 1867, Thomas Sweeney signed his last will and testament and died on Saturday 7 September of that year. His wife Margaret died in 1884\n\nPATRICK CARRUCAN\n\nCARRUCAN STORIES\n\nThe Carrucan Clan hail from County Clare, Ireland.\n\nP14…..\n\nThe Burren\n\nThe family line stretches back to the villages of Fanore Beg and Fisherstreet (now called Doolin), some 9 miles apart and set on the shores of the rugged West Coast of County Clare in Ireland, located in the region known as The Burren.\n\nFanore and Doolin, two coastal towns situated in the NW comer of County Clare\n\nThis area of Ireland is steeped in history. Evidence of a Neolithic civilisation in the Clare area can be seen in the form of ancient dolmen: single-chamber megalithic tombs, usually consisting of three or more upright stones. Clare is one of the richest places In Ireland for these tombs, the most noted being in the Burren area, dating back to circa 3,800 BC.\n\nWith the exception of the dune system and the rine saltmarsh, where the Caher River empties into the sea at Fanore, the Burren coastline is for the most part rocky, rising 196m to the Cliffs of Moher, lashed by Atlantic gales. At first glance, the land is barren and harsh.\n\nUntil the 17th Century, there were only some 80 or so isolated farm-forts in the Burren area, each supporting an extended family……p14\n\nThe Burren: Karst of Ireland\n\nThe main features and places of the Burren (David Drew)\n\nThe Burren plateau of north-west Co. Clare is the finest example of a karstic terrain in Ireland, with a full assemblage of the curious landforms and subterranean drainage systems that characterise such limestone terrains. The Burren is famous internationally, not just because of its beautiful limestone landscapes but also because of the remarkable flora of the region and its rich archaeological heritage. The term “Burren” is derived from the Gaelic for “stony place”.\n\nThe Burren is bounded to the west and north by the Atlantic Ocean and the southern shores of Galway Bay, respectively. The southern boundary, an east to west line from Corofin, to Kilfenora, to Lisdoonvarna, to the coast at Doolin, is where the limestone passes beneath younger rocks composed of shale and sandstone. To the east of the plateau lie the Gort-Kinvarra lowlands.\n\nA large enclosed basin (doline) on the summit of Aillwee Hill near Ballyvaughan (David Drew)\n\nThe Burren is 360 km2 in extent and forms a plateau gently tilted to the south, at 200-300 m above sea level in the north and 100 m in the south, bounded by steep scarps on all but the southern flank.\n\nThe highest point is the shale-capped Slieve Elva at 345 m above sea level.\n\nTo the west of the Burren, the Aran Islands are an extension of the main plateau in many respects, and for long periods during the recent geological past were almost certainly linked to the Burren by dry land.\n\nBare rock is widespread on the hills of the north flank of the Burren overlooking Galway Bay. Glacial ice moving across the Burren from the north has smoothed the seaward facing slopes. (David Drew)\n\nTo a greater degree than in any other karst region (and perhaps any region) of Ireland, the rocks that form the skeleton of the area is bare rock or rocky pasture. Accordingly, differences in the character or structure of the limestone are often manifested in particular landforms or other features of the landscape. For example, the northern hills of the Burren overlooking Galway Bay rise in tiers of cliffs and terraces where horizontal lines of weakness in the rock have been exploited by erosive waters and the loosened rock subsequently scraped away by glaciers. Below these terraces, massive, unfractured limestones form smooth slopes whilst above the terrace3d zones the limestones have\n\ncrumbled more readily and allowed a thin soil cover to develop. These are the upland pastures of the Burren, long used to graze cattle during the winter months. Thin bands of clay or other non-soluble rocks force water, seeping down through the fissured limestone, to emerge at the surface to form many small springs – the main source of water for stock on the otherwise waterless upland. In the south-eastern Burren, the rocks have been folded and fractured by earth movements and each distortion of the strata is faithfully reflected in the landscape, for example in eccentrically shaped hills such as Mullaghmore and Slieve Rua.\n\nSprings and Wells\n\nSprings and wells supply almost all the water used on the Burren. Killeany spring near Lisdoonvarna is used to supply water over a wide area. The tourist centre of Ballyvaughan utilises water from springs on the mountains nearby and from a bored well just outside the town. Corofin, another important tourist centre, uses water from Lough Inchiquin, which is fed largely by spring waters from the Burren plateau. All of these supplies are vulnerable to contamination from any pollutants that are allowed to enter the underground waters of the Burren. The landscape of the Burren, especially the central and eastern parts, seems a stony chaos to the casual observer. Only at the junction of the limestone and the impermeable shale rocks, around Slieve Elva for example, are there valleys containing streams. Where these streams cross from the shale to the limestone they disappear underground at swallow holes, the waters flowing through cave systems before emerging from springs such as those at Killeany and St. Brendan’s Well near Lisdoonvarna. Away from the non-limestone rocks, the landscape is pitted with fragments of gorges and with innumerable hollows or enclosed basins termed dolines. Some of these basins are a few\n\nmetres in depth and width, but others, for example the enclosed depression at Carron, are several square kilometres in extent and tens of metres deep. Another remarkable feature of the Burren is the large expanses of bare limestone called limestone pavements. The vertical fissures (joints) in the rock have been opened by acidic rain water (grikes), thus compartmentalising the rock surface into blocks or clints, each a few square metres in extent. Limestone pavements are a legacy of the ice age that ended some 15,000 years ago in this part of Ireland. The ice scraped away the surface debris of soil, stones and the topmost layer of solutionally weakened rock, to leave a massive, uneroded rock surface when the ice melted. Extensive limestone pavements are common in high Alpine limestone areas of Europe and elsewhere where ice persisted until very recently.\n\nBare rock on the hills of the north flank of the Burren (David Drew)\n\nHuman Impact on the Burren\n\nThe barren appearance of the Burren may be due, in part at least, to past human actions. Evidence from soils lodged in cracks in the rocks and from ancient preserved pollen suggest that in prehistoric times the Burren may have been wooded, with more fertile and more widespread soils than now. The cutting down of the forests by early settlers may have allowed the soils to be eroded away – an occurrence known to have taken place in many of the world’s karst regions. The Burren contains the greatest number of explored caves of any karst region of Ireland, most of them narrow, twisting canyon-like passages carrying a stream and located in the west of the area close to Lisdoonvarna.\n\nCaves\n\nAillwee Cave near Ballyvaughan, containing vast, dry caverns, is one of Ireland’s oldest caves and must have formed when the landscape of the Burren was very different from that of the present day. Exploring the cave of Pol an Ionain at Ballynalackan, involves a low, stony crawl in water. However, at the end of the crawl, the explorer enters a large chamber where, hanging from the roof is a huge stalactite, 6.7 m long and reputedly the longest known in the world. Although other karst areas in Ireland have impressive archaeological remains, the passage graves on the Bricklieve Mountains for example, the evidence for human occupancy of the Burren for the past six millennia or more is striking. Stone has of necessity been the building material and hence structures have been preserved long after they were built. In addition to the famous wedge-tombs and ring forts, the surface of the plateau is covered by networks of field walls, hut circles and other more obscure features all of which testify to the attraction humans have had to what seems a bare and inhospitable region, largely devoid of soil and water.\n\nFrom The Karst of Ireland: Limestone Landscapes, Caves and Groundwater Drainage Systems.

His progress was typical, passing his Class II examination in 1868 at 8 years of age. His attendance dropped in later years as presumably he was expected to do more around the farm – 209, 179, 196, 184, 168, 132, 165, 113, 114, 143, 126, 135, 121, 88, 136, 40 and 38 meetings.\n\nJohn Carrucan, Peter and Hannah’s third child, started in April 1867 at the age of 2 years and 8 months and left exactly 10 years later. He passed his Class V examination and remained a regular attendee during his 10 years.\n\nPatrick Carrucan, the fourth child of Patrick and Mary Carrucan, started in June 1867, aged 2 years and 9 months.\n\nThis photo, from Alan Marshall’s book ‘Pioneers and Painters’ shows experimental Plots which the students maintained. The early schooling was general in nature and focused on rudimentary reading and writing as well as giving the students basic farming capabilities. …….p71\n\np78……..within the last fortnight, as many as three hundred have been at work, and many of them, I understood, had done well. I inquired as to any particular instance of success, as the term “doing well” seems rather indefinite, and was informed that two persons, resident at Eltham (one of them named Coleman) had brought to Eltham about ten ounces as the result of nine or ten days’ work. I made an attempt to reach the place myself, to obtain more certain particulars, but found the road so infamous (I speak of the road between Eltham and the Kangaroo Grounds) that no one, I should think, would venture on it without positive necessity; and, after struggling for some distance, I returned without accomplishing my object.\n\nFew records remain of John Coleman’s subsequent dealings so there is little further to add to this account of his life. However, Alan Marshall includes the name Coleman in his list of the members of the Eltham Elementary School’s Board of local patrons, noting him as denomination R.C.\n\nHe died at Eltham on Friday 30th October 1886 aged 75 years, having been paralysed for four years. His medical practitioner recorded that he had seen him one year before his death. An undated newspaper cutting, at the time of his death, states\n\nHe died at his residence on a Saturday morning. He was aged 71 at the time of his death and he had been a colonist for forty years. He was well respected in the district. His funeral, on the Sunday evening, was well attended and some churches cut out the Sunday evening service to allow attendance. Before his death, he had been bedridden for four years.\n\nThe occupation noted on his death certificate was ‘gardener.\n\nBridget lived in the family home until her death, 15 years after John, at the age of 68. Her cause of death was documented as ‘senile decay’ and it was noted that she ‘had senile decay 8 years prior to death’ – a sad end for such a pioneer.\n\nThe property then passed to the eldest son John Patrick Coleman.\n\nThe house and property remained in the family until it was finally sold in 1992 by Bridget’s granddaughter Maggie.\n\nUnfortunately, in subsequent years, roadworks straightened the road and this corner and the house block no longer exist. A new street, Coleman Crescent, is the only reminder to these early pioneers.\n\nFittingly there is still a farm within the grounds of the old farm, namely the Edendale Farm and Community Centre.\n\nThe Coleman farmhouse in Eltham circa 1910. It shows John Patrick Coleman (the eldest son of John Coleman and Bridget Carrucan) with his wife Mary Agnes (nee McHugh) and children John Francis, Agnes and Edward.\n\nThe final postscript to the story of the Colemans in Eltham appears in the 1992 notice of sale of the property which is reproduced in full below.\n\nHOUSE OF THE WEEK\n\nThis Corner scheduled to go under the hammer soon is steeped in Eltham’s History\n\nADDRESS: 1203 Main Road, Eltham.\n\nDESCRIPTION: Corner block on Main Road, Eltham, adjacent to the Hurstbridge line. The triangular corner block faces north. It is bordered by Main Road and Wattletree\n\nThe Next Generations\n\nSecond Generation — 1: John Patrick Coleman\n\nBridget and John Coleman’s first child, John Patrick, was born in 1857. In 1878 he married Mary Agnes McHugh and, in turn, they had five children Peter, Jessie, Daisy, Jack also known as John, and David. Our records are lacking any detail beyond this first generation.\n\nSecond Generation — 2: Martha West nee Coleman\n\nBridget and John Coleman’s second child Martha was born on 1st January 1858. In 1878, aged 19, she married local Eltham boy William West (born 25th March 1856).\n\nHer husband William became the proprietor of the Research Hotel in 1889 and they moved into residence there. Martha died in 1924, aged 66, and William died in 1935, aged 79. They are both buried in the Eltham Cemetery.\n\nThe Research Hotel circa 1900. The verandah carries the words ‘Research Hotel William West’\n\nThe Wests had 13 children, the first 7 born in Eltham and the remaining 6 born at the Research Hotel where the couple lived for the remainder of their lives\n\nRobert James (Bob) (1879) John (Jack) (1880) William (1882) Ethel May (Polly) (1883) George William (1885) Margaret Francis (Maggie) (1886) Elizabeth Martha (1888) Mabel Alice (1889) Lilian Blanche (Dot) (1890) Alfred Ernest (1893) Olive Myrtle (Tot) (1895) Benjamin Francis (1895) Evelyn Agnes (1896)\n\nWilliam is described variously in documents of the time as a miner, hotelier and farmer. It is said that he would sit on the back porch of the hotel with a pile of dirt clods next to him as his daughters worked in the field or garden. If one stopped working for any reason, he would throw a dirt clod at her!\n\nThis photo of Martha West nee Coleman feeding chooks in Research sometime in the early 1920s was passed onto us by Martha’s great granddaughter Cheryl Laumer\n\nSecond Generation — 3: Peter Vincent Colman\n\nPeter Vincent Colman, born on 18th June 1860 in Eltham, was the third of John and Bridget Coleman’s children. He married Mary Jane Cargill on 15th May 1887 when he was 26 years of age.\n\nThey had two children:\n\nJessie Isabella (1890) John Vincent (1892)\n\nWe will follow the fortunes of John, the younger of the two children.\n\nJohn Vincent Colman was born on 28th April 1892 in Malvern and died on 2nd November 1970, aged 78. On 18 Oct 1917, when he was 25 years of age, he married Kate Jones (born 20 Feb 1896).\n\nWe take up the story from the December 1990 edition of the local Warrandyte paper.\n\nKate Colman, Dedicated Pioneer. Bruce Bence pays tribute.\n\nThe Warrandyte area lost a link with the past on December 11th 1990 when Kate Colman (nee Jones) died at the age of 94. Fortunately Kate’s story was written down by her granddaughter Jenny Fitzgerald after many hours of conversation in 1971.\n\nKate was born on February 20th 1896 in her family’s log cabin home in Yarra Street, Warrandyte. The simple family home had a bark roof. Clothes were washed in the river and cooking was done on a wood-fired stove. The site is where the squash courts now stand.\n\nKate’s birth was just three weeks after the death of her father, John Jones, a Warrandyte miner. Kate’s mother, Freda, had no choice but to send four of her eight children to an orphanage.\n\nTwo years after John’s death, Freda married another miner, Edwin Holloway and the family moved to a cottage at the top of Webb Street. The four children were brought home from the orphanage and Freda and Edwin had another three children.\n\nKate walked two miles each day to attend Warrandyte School No 12 where she was taught arithmetic, spelling, dictation, geography and history. The girls also learned needlework, for which Kate won a prize.\n\nKate completed eighth grade at the age of 14 and began dressmaking in Ringwood, walking there and home each day, a distance of 6 miles (10 km) each way.\n\n1895 – Freda Jones and children pose in front of their humble cottage in Warrandyte. From left: Mary, Freda, Tom, Ben, Bill and Rachel. Charlie and Winifred are not pictured. Freda was expecting Kate at the time.\n\nAfter completing her training, she worked for Tom and Mavis Beavis in Doncaster. She looked after the children and helped Mrs Beavis, who was using crutches at the time. Kate lived with the family during the week and walked home on Saturday.\n\nIf Kate wanted to go anywhere it was usually by foot. She walked to dances at South Warrandyte Hall and it was a big event to go to Melbourne by coach.\n\nKate met her future husband, Jack Colman, at a cricket match when she was 18 years of age.\n\nThe Colman family owned land south of Hussey’s Lane east of Anderson’s Creek and up to the main road where they had an orchard. Jack helped his father in the South Warrandyte orchard and in later years grew raspberries on the small flat in the corner of Hussey’s Lane and Anderson’s Creek.\n\nRASPBERRIES\n\nJack and Kate looked forward to the Fruit Growers’ picnic each year. They travelled by boat from Melbourne to either Sorrento or Queenscliff, while the Box Hill Band played for dances on board.\n\nKate worked as a waitress at one of the Warrandyte hotels for about a year before she and Jack were married, when Kate was twenty-two.\n\nThe couple had three daughters:\n\nJessie, who married Bob Reid, Joyce who married Bill Hartley and Gwen who married Cashen Fitzgerald.\n\nIn 1926, Jack became a councillor for the Shire of Doncaster and Templestowe, a position he held from 1926 to 1936, and again from 1940 to 1953. He was Shire President on three occasions.\n\nLife became very busy for Jack and Kate during that time. Jack was involved in everything that happened in the district.\n\nHe was President and a foundation member of the Warrandyte Cricket Club and was on the Hall Committee.\n\nHe was also a foundation member of both the Warrandyte Bush Fire Brigade, formed in 1938, and the South Warrandyte Fire Brigade, which became a separate identity in 1949.\n\nIn 1934 two quarry workers, William Shea and Walter Black were killed by a fall of gravel. Jack heard the fall at the Hussey’s Lane quarry, went to find out what had happened and then ran to the post office for help.\n\nHe became a member of the Disaster Cottages Trust, which built, maintained and administered two houses for the workers’ widows. It was a magnificent community effort at the height of the depression.\n\nKate’s family found it hard to sell their peaches during the depression. Jack would take them to Ferntree Gully where many who were better off had holiday homes and could afford to buy the fruit. He sold peaches for as little as two shillings and sixpence a case.\n\nMuch of the fruit was given to orphanages. Fortunately the Colmans had a cow and fowls and were able to grow vegetables to help them through the grim years of the depression.\n\nBut the Family lost everything on January 13th 1939, when bush fire swept through Warrandyte.\n\nJack helped neighbours to save their home but his and Kate’s was lost to the flames.\n\nKate and her elder daughters Jessie and Joyce took refuge in the dam at the corner of their property and watched the inferno. Her youngest daughter Gwen was staying in Warrandyte and sheltered in the river.\n\nKate Colman, known as Kit, in her eighties\n\nIronically twenty-three years later, in January 1962, Kate joined granddaughters Jenny and Helen Fitzgerald in the same dam, as again fire threatened her home. That time the house survived.\n\nKate kept the post office for 10 years until the General Store was built, ensuring that the post office remained open and the district wouldn’t lose its mail service ….p95\n\nP142……..\n\nThe Patrick Carrucan — Mary O’Brien Line\n\nPatrick Carrucan was one of six children born to a poor farming couple, Patrick and Bridget Carrucan, in Doolan, County Clare in Ireland in 1831.\n\nWhen Patrick married Mary O’Brien (born circa 1838 at Ennis, County Clare) in 1856 at Ennistimon, County Clare, she was 18 and and he was 26. Later in that same year, the young couple left Ireland, bound for Australia. Once there, they joined Patrick’s sister Bridget and her husband John Coleman in Eltham.\n\nInitially they occupied a small Eltham farm of some 14 acres, bought from a farming family called Ball. For the first few years, Patrick and Mary lived in a hut on the farm but Mary’s father Sylvester O’Brien came out from Ireland and built them a house at the corner of Dalton St and Bible St.\n\nPatrick’s grand-daughter Kitty Bourke was one of the first to research the early Carrucans in Eltham. Her notes state\n\nIn 1856 Patrick Carrucan married Mary O’Brien and sailed for Australia on “Unassisted Passage” tickets, and on arrival settled in Eltham. Mary’s father, Sylvester O’Brien, came with them, saw them settled, (some say helped to build the house) and then returned to Ireland. They could read and write, but Mary only in Gaelic. She learned English from the children.\n\nPatrick and Mary had ten children between 1858 and 1874\n\nBridget: 1858-1949\n\nMichael (Mick): 1860-1943\n\nSusan (Sue): 1862-1942\n\nPatrick: 1864-1928\n\nThomas: 1866-1867\n\nMary Anne: 1868-1938\n\nCatherine (Kate): 1869-1940\n\nTheresa Margaret: 1871-1920\n\nFrances: 1872-\n\nAnne (Babe): 1874-1946.\n\nFew stories have survived to tell us of those early days in Eltham. One records\n\nWhen Patrick went to market, he left at 4:00pm and arrived at the market by midnight. Mary, who\n\nwas said to be illiterate, would accost the first farmer returning from market and ask the price of cherries, etc., to determine know how much he should be handing over.\n\nBridget married Patrick Lane in 1875, Susan married Edward Kent in 1881, Mary Anne married Jeremiah Lodge in 1895, Catherine married Laurence Foley in 1900, Theresa Margaret married Edward Bourke, Frances married Thomas Keane in 1896 and Annie married James Calnin in 1897.\n\nThus in one generation, the direct descendant lines included Carrucans, Kents, Lodges, FoIeys, Bourkes, Keanes and Gamins.\n\nWe think that this photo, taken in the late 1880s, shows Patrick and Mary Carrucan. If so, it is the only photo that we have of Patrick.\n\nOthers also came from Ireland. Mary Dempsey remembers Susan O’Brien Whom we now assume was Mary O’Brien’s sister. Susan O’Brien was a psychiatric nurse and for a time lived in Ballarat with Babe (Anne Carrucan, youngest child of Patrick Carrucan and Mary O’Brien). It would appear that she had no children. Mary Dempsey recalls her as a woman in black clothes who taught her to play the card game Patience. She says Susan would play Patience for hours.\n\nPatrick and Mary lived at Eltham for the rest of their lives. Patrick died on 6th October 1894 at the age of 63. Family folk law has he died from a broken back after being run over by his own bullock cart. Patrick’s death certificate says he died from paraplegia arising from a fracture of the seventh vertebrae. This does seem to lend authenticity to that story.\n\nPatrick died with an existing will that directed his widow Mary be made sole Executrix. This was granted and she would have then handed the material matters over to Cole and O’Heare, the family lawyers.\n\nThe Application for Probate listed his holdings as follows\n\n* Land being lot 460 and part of lot 19 of Portion 12 section 4 at Eltham Parish of Nillumbik containing 5 acres 1 rood 24 perches. Shire Valuation £200.\n\n* Land being lot 53 Portion 12 Section 4 Nillumbik containing 2 perches upon which is erected an old WB and slat house containing 6 rooms. Shire valuation £140.\n\n* Land being Lot 2 Section 18 Nillumbik containing 61 acres upon part of which there is an orchard and part of grass land. Shire valuation £800.\n\n* Land being part of Crown Portion 12 Section 4 at Eltham containing 3 acres 1 rood and 28 perches. Shire valuation £200.\n\n* Land at comer of Dalton and Bible Streets Eltham containing 2 acres 2 roods 10 perches. Shire valuation £100.\n\n* Land being lots 1 and 2 Section 12 at Eltham containing 2 acres. Shire valuation £100.\n\n* Land being Allotment 5 Section 12 at Eltham Parish of Nillumbik containing one acre 2 roods 21 perches, upon which there is an orchard. Shire valuation £60.\n\nThe total land holdings were valued £1600 and his total assets at £1887. Thus he died with significant assets to pass onto his surviving wife and children.\n\nMary lived on for a further 33 years, continuing to reside at the Dalton Street farm, with her son Mick and his family, until she died in 1927 at the age of 90.\n\nPatrick and Mary were buried together in the same plot in the Catholic section of the Eltham Cemetery, the headstone a reminder of those early Irish immigrants. In fact it is the only headstone still extant from these first Carrucans. The gravestone was in such disrepair that Betty Erickson (nee Carrucan) paid to have a new one erected in the late 1970s. Unfortunately, this gravestone, like the original, only honours Patrick and does not record the other family members buried there, including his wife Mary. It is a must-see on any tour of the Eltham cemetery.\n\nPatrick Carrucan’s family plot at the Eltham Cemetery.\n\nThe original farm at Dalton St stayed in family hands for many years, being passed first to their son Mick and then to his son John Francis (Jack) Carrucan.\n\nUp until the 1960s, the family farm in Dalton Steet remained a popular destination for the wider Carrucan family and Tim Erickson remembers the many family visits when he was growing up there in the 1950s.\n\nSadly, when Jack Carrucan died without heirs in 1976, what remained of the farm was subdivided and sold and the old farmhouse was demolished. Thus the last direct link to Eltham was severed after some 120 years.\n\nFew photos have been found of these first pioneers but this one does show Mary Carrucan (nee O’Brien in her later years).\n\nThe rear of the old Dalton Street farm house circa 1910. On the left is Michael O’Heare, a well-known local solicitor and Carrucan friend. Michael Carrucan is on the right and his mother Mary (nee O’Brien) is in the middle.\n\nSecond Generation — 1: Bridget Carrucan\n\nBridget Carrucan was born in December 1858 at Eltham, the first child born to Patrick and Mary Carrucan. We are indebted to Peggie Ruthven for the following marvellous exposition of her life.\n\nMemories of my grandparents Bridget (nee Carrucan) and Patrick Lane\n\nBridget Carrucan, born in December 1858 at Eltham, Victoria, was the oldest of the children born to Patrick Carrucan and Mary nee O’Brien.\n\nShe was 17 years old when she married Patrick Richard (Paddy) Lane at St Patrick’s Melbourne on 16th August 1875. Paddy was 24 years old and ran a bakery next to the Melbourne Post Office.\n\nPaddy was also of Irish stock, his father Richard Lane having migrated from Limerick to Melbourne in 1849. Richard had married Mary Carey soon after arriving and Paddy was born on 3011, September 1851. Unfortunately his mother Mary died in 1852 and his father Richard was shot by a madman at his property in Eltham on 31st January 1861, an infamous piece of local history. This left Paddy an orphan living with his stepmother and her sons and daughter.\n\nPaddy’s aunt Anne, who lived up the coast towards NSW with other members of Richard’s wider family, heard that he was being treated unfairly and cruelly so she donned drovers’ breeches, coat, and hat and rode alone to Melbourne. As he came out of school she stole him and took him back to rear him with his family and cousins.\n\nAt 21 years of age he returned to Melbourne and went to court to claim his inheritance, the bakehouse, flour mill and food store that his father had run in Melbourne town. It was at this time that he met Bridget Carrucan and they married.\n\nPatrick settled in Eltham, starting a farm there and eventually donating the land to build the Catholic Church.\n\nBridget and Patrick had 12 children but lost a little girl of four and two boys. Of those who survived, Michael was born in 1877, John 1878, Bridget 1885, Richard 1887, Patrick 1891, Cornelius Joseph (my father) 1893, Thomas Philip 1895, Anthony Sylvester 1897 and Eileen 1902.\n\nBridget was a strong, religious woman. We all loved her. She didn’t have much education but she travelled a few times with a Mrs Monaghan who couldn’t even sign her name. Ireland seemed to call them every few years.\n\nIn 1895 Paddy with their two eldest sons, Michael (Mick) and John (Jack), left Bridget in Eltham (expecting her 11 th baby) with the other 8 children. Bridget was to follow him to the Kalgurlie (the original name) goldfields in Western Australia in probably 12 months when he had arranged a house for the family.\n\nWhen she left to come west it must have been hard. I think she would then have been about 30 years old. Bridget gave birth to her baby son Sylvester in February 1896 and arrived in Albany in June that same year. The ships then only came as far as Albany as Fremantle Harbour was not completed. From Albany, Bridget and the children travelled by coach to Perth. The goldfields were approximately 375 miles (600 kilometres) from Perth. Bridget and her family probably travelled to the Swan River near Perth to catch the train. The train line went as far as Southern Cross and then they would have travelled by foot and cart. She then walked with nine children from Coolgardie to Boulder, a distance of 40 kilometres.\n\nThe photo shows Bridget with 4 of her children in 1846 – Syl (the baby), Tom (the small boy in black), Ellen (sitting at front) and Bridget (Dolly) who is standing back middle.\n\nAt first, Patrick had a shop where he sold water. Water was two and sixpence a half gallon. He purchased it wholesale from McDonald’s condenser. The only accommodation options were tents and bush humpies so he opened a brickworks. He built a large brick house and a bake house on the corner of Dwyer and Wilson Streets in Boulder. It had outhouses, stables and large paddocks. I lived there with them. I loved to go back for holidays once we moved to Perth. Every Sunday the nuns came for afternoon tea. The cook had cakes and scones for them to take home and their tea was set up in the sitting room as nobody was allowed to see them eat.\n\nPatrick and the boys also had a business carting sandalwood for overseas markets. And they had contracts for the firewood and timber for the mines. They used camels to transport the wood and were away from home for long periods of time. Paddy along with a couple of cronies spent his time prospecting, only coming home for rations. With his son Sylvester, who was 12 at the time, he found alluvial gold at Broadarrow long before there was a mine there.\n\nBridget would visit Melbourne to see her mother. When Paddy came home I can remember him asking, “Where’s your mother?” On being told she had gone to Melbourne, he replied, “That old lady will see me out by many a day”.\n\nThe boys weren’t saints and neither were their mates. Gran would order them to bed otherwise they were too tired to do their chores. They used to hide under the footpath bridges that hurdled the wide gullies. Gran would get the whip that Mick had for the horses and trotters and let it fly and the boys would cry, “I’m not yours, Mrs Lane,” and Gran would reply, ” Well go home and tell your mother.” Not one mother ever complained, they knew which side was buttered.\n\nGran was a friend to everybody and fed whole families. You never knew who was going to be at the dinner table. They always had bakers, carters and anybody that came to the door, including the Aborigines. The Aborigines would gather under the trees near the bakehouse and Gran would make sure there was a loaf of bread for all of them. I remember once when some Aborigines came in for bread Michael made the black man chop wood, and we fed the female some toffees. She choked on them and was out to it and Gran came to the rescue and dragged it all out of her mouth. We were then banned from feeding the Aborigines. Michael once filled up a bran bag and there was a fight with the mob waiting outside. Michael then had to referee and divide the spoils. They were the good old days. The Aborigines never broke in and stole anything. They knew Gran never sent them away empty handed. Apart from food, she gave them clothes, cooking pots etc. I remember them as being filthy, with sore eyes and festers on their legs.\n\nMichael was more interested in his trotters, and sometimes after training, “Golden Harvest” would get home before Mick. Usually someone rang to tell them to open the big gates; if they didn’t, the spider would be smashed.\n\nGran had a cook and a house girl, a summer kitchen and a winter kitchen. The temperature was high; no such thing as a fan. She told my cousin Nell to take me up and get a nice hat for Mass. I liked a lilac taffeta and when I got home my Mother was horrified by the price. Gran never minded but Michael went off. We used to take six pence each and go to the shop and buy 12 halfpenny sticks of lolly.\n\nUnder the shade of a huge peppercorn tree was built a fully enclosed yard with chicken wire all over the top and sides. This was the cooler room and consisted of an open tank with three or four inches of water, pieces of flannel hanging so the water ran down the four sides and a big lock on the door. There was another lock on the outer gate. This was called a Coolgardie safe and worked very well so long as the water was changed continually, kept clean and the pieces of flannel washed well so the water would continue to flow freely. All the fruit trees were watered with the bath water.\n\nAnother incident I remember was when Gran got a big turkey and an axe and tried to behead it. It wasn’t a clean job and the turkey kept running around the backyard until it just flopped. We all had a great Christmas dinner with the big table loaded with hams and puddings and presents and money.\n\nLife changed for Bridget once the Depression hit us. I don’t remember how many houses she owned but she sold them one by one and the bakehouse closed. My father (Cornelius) brought four of us to Perth and eventually the last three children were born in Perth. Dad built a house and Gran came down often.\n\nI was back in Boulder when I was eight. It was a Saturday and we had gone to see a picture (a type of lantern slide). A storm came up without notice. We kids couldn’t get on the tram to South Boulder so we ran all the way home. Dolly had rung from her tearooms and said we were on our way. Gran checked us in and told us to go to the laundry and get changed. We did. But Gran had a houseful of old cronies there. So we cleared down to the creek which was suddenly full. She came looking for us with a large switch to hit us with but by this one we could run faster than she could.\n\nWhen she left the old home she came to live with my family and Eileen’s family in turn. I went to the hospital to see her when she was dying and she asked who it was. “Oh yes it is Peggeth” she said, “When I was born my mother put me in a cradle and now I’m leaving you they have put me in a cot”. It have never forgotten that. It was a bed with the sides clamped on.\n\nI have a large photo of Gran Carrucan with her eldest girl Bridget Lane and Bridget’s eldest girl Bridget (Dolly) and Dolly’s eldest girl Mary Honoria as a baby.\n\n1905 approx – the photo in question\n\nI can’t remember the date of Great-Grandmother’s death but I know I was about 11 or 12 years old. (Editor – Bridget died on 27th August 1949 in Perth. Patrick died on 10th February 1926 in Kalgoorlie. They were both laid to rest at the Kalgoorlie Cemetery).\n\nThe story now continues as we look at some of the children of Patrick and Bridget Lane.\n\nThird Generation — 1: Michael (Mick) Lane\n\nMichael (Mick) Lane, the eldest child of Patrick and Bridget Lane, was born in 1876 at Eltham. In 1895 he and his younger brother John (Jack) accompanied their father to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia as an advance party. As the family eventually all moved west, he lived the rest of his days in that State. In later years, Mick and Jack went farming at Burracoppin, a very dry area. Mick developed cancer and presumably died of this disease in Karrakatta in 1938.\n\nThird Generation — 2: John Lane\n\nJack, born in 1877 at Eltham, was not destined to live to old bones. The story is told that one day when he was out riding a horse to get a tank of water, a kangaroo frightened the horse. The horse bolted and Jack fell and broke his neck, date of death 1926, age at death 48 years.\n\nThird Generation — 3: Mary Lane\n\nMary Lane, the third of the Lane children, was born in 1879 in Eltham. She died as a 20 year-old in 1900 of bubonic plague when living in Kalgoorlie.\n\nHer younger sisters, Susan and Ellen also died of bubonic plague. “The Plague” as it was known came to Australia in about 1900 add was spread by vermin.\n\nOn 12th May 1900, The Mercury (Hobart) reported that a case of bubonic plague had been reported at Kalgoorlie. On 16th April 1901, The Argus newspaper reported further cases of bubonic plague in Kalgoorlie. Hence we can surmise that she was amongst the first casualties of this dreaded disease.\n\nThird Generation — 4: Susan Lane\n\nSusan Lane, the fourth of the Lane children, was born in 1882 and died of the plague in Melbourne in 1892. She would have been ten years of age. She was the first in the family to die of bubonic plague and her death was followed by those of Mary in 1900 and Ellen in 1904.\n\nThird Generation — 5: Bridget (Dolly) McMahon\n\nBridget (Dolly), the fifth child of Patrick and Bridget Lane, was born in Eltham in 1885 and moved with her family to Western Australia in the last 1890’s. She married John McMahon in 1909 and had a long life, eventually dying in 1968. Dolly and John had four children: Mary (Bonnie), Eileen, Bernadine and John\n\n1909 – Richard and Bridget (nee Carrucan) Lane with family on the occasion of daughter Bridget’s wedding to John McMahon. At that time, three of the daughters, Susan, Mary and Ellen have already died.

His home base at this stage was a hut on a acre leasehold in what later became North Kew. Even in May 1844, he was still uncertain about the 110 acres at what is now Eltham, and actually sent a petition to see if he could exchange it.\n\nThomas and Margaret Sweeney were the first freeholders to settle in what is now Eltham and they were soon followed by other settlers. Amongst that next wave came Bridget Carrucan in 1854. Soon afterwards, her brothers Patrick and Peter joined her in Eltham and the Carrucan settlement in that area was firmly in place.\n\nThe connection between the Sweeney and Carrucan families was quickly established when Bridget married widower John Coleman (no relation to Thomas Sweeney’s first wife Bridget Coleman) at Culla Hill and then started to farm a nearby allotment.\n\nCulla Hill circa 1900 – In the early 1900s, Mary Sweeney commissioned travelling painter Charles Bertei to paint the Culla Hill homestead. She took this painting with her when she married Michael Carrucan in 1910 and it hung in the Dalton St farmhouse for many years.\n\nHowever, it was a further two generations before the two families intermarried and officially cemented their relationship.\n\nJohn Francis Sweeney, born in 1844, was the second son of Thomas and Margaret Sweeney. When Thomas died in September 1867, John Sweeney and his mother inherited the Culla Hill property as well as a separate parcel of land (Margaret died in 1884). In 1868, John married Irish born Ellen Kenny and their marriage produced 10 children, 7 girls and 3 boys, including Mary, born 1876.\n\nAt the same time, the Carrucan families were also increasing in size and Patrick Carrucan, who had migrated to Australia with his wife Mary (O’Brien) in 1856 had also sired a large family of 10 children, including Michael, the second oldest.\n\nThese 2 families grew up on farms only 2 miles apart, they went to the same school, they attended Mass together (Mass was held in the front parlour at Culla Hill in the early days) and it was inevitable that they should intermarry. But more of that later.\n\nJohn Sweeney with 5 of his daughters, Culla Hill, Eltham, circa 1900. Mary (the wife of Michael Carrucan) is the second girl from the left.\n\nJohn Sweeney intermittently kept a personal diary (hand written in an old exercise book) between the years of 1881 and 1883 and the following extracts show the sort of subsistence farming which framed the lives of the early Eltham settlers.\n\nMonday July 2, 1883 Ploughing Tuesday – Thursday Cutting wood for Melbourne Friday Mary Murray here Saturday At home all day Sunday At home. Mary Benson here in evening Monday – Tuesday Ploughing Wednesday Ploughing Thursday Working about farm Friday Ploughing for Mr Gordon Saturday Working at home. Annie and Agatha went up to Murrays in evening. Sunday At home all day Monday Ploughing in morning. Went to Mrs ? funeral in evening. Tuesday Ploughing for Mr Gordon Wednesday Mick (Carrucan) went to Melbourne with wood Thursday Ploughing for Mr Gordon\n\nThe diary went on with monotonous regularity. The diet was one of cutting wood, ploughing, planting or digging up potatoes, taking produce or wood to Melbourne to sell and the various special occasions when someone visited or the family visited someone.\n\nThe diary also lists the cost of labour in shillings.\n\n1 Day Ploughing 15/- 1 Day cutting firewood 15/- 1/2 day carting soil 7/6 Carting wood to Melbourne 19/-\n\nThis was subsistence farming at its purest – nothing excess, everything done with a reason and to an end. With large families of up to 10 children, it was a continual struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table.\n\nThe local farmers had to supplement their incomes whenever possible, especially during the Great Depression of the late 1880’s. At that time the able men travelled far and wide in an effort to bring in extra money. One of the Depression initiatives was the building of the water canal at Research and Surrounding areas. It is known that the Carrucan men, including Mick, worked or, this project.\n\nStrangely enough, the intermarriage between the Sweeney and the Carrucan families did not occur until after the death of John Sweeney on 24th May 1909. On 12th October 1910, Michael Carrucan, the oldest son of Patrick and Mary Carrucan, married Mary Sweeney, some 16 years his junior. Age differences meant little then and many marriages matched younger girls with older established men.\n\nThe marriage was celebrated at St John’s Catholic Church in Heidelberg and the following photo shows the Bridal Party.\n\nThe wedding of Mary Sweeney and Michael Carrucan at St John’s Church Heidelberg, celebrant Rev Fr. Parker. From left to right: Catherine Sweeney, Michael O’Heare, Michael and Mary Carrucan, Thomas Sweeney and Ellen Smith\n\nWhy wait so long? Was John Sweeney against the marriage? Mick Carrucan had inherited the family farm in Dalton Street at Eltham and he seemed an acceptable suitor from that perspective.Certainly the Sweeneys saw themselves as a bit special and a marriage to a Carrucan might have been deemed by John Sweeney as unacceptable. Mary had been brought up in the upper echelons of Eltham society but Mick had only received the most basic education. In fact my mother Betty taught her father Mick to read and write in later life, an indication of the gulf that perhaps separated them socially.\n\nMary moved to the Carrucan farm in Dalton Street and joined in the tough farming life of the day. The horses were the most important pieces of machinery available and teams and drays were prized possessions. My uncle Jack kept two beautiful drays in his sheds long after the horses had gone. He could not bear to part with them.\n\nBy that time, the Carrucan farm had spread across 3 separate properties. The main farm was in Dalton Street and occupied some 20 acres in 3 main paddocks. A second property of some 15 acres was located on Main Road near Bridge Street and a third property of around 100 acres was found in Research.\n\nAs was the norm in those days, Mick and Mary Carrucan started their family quickly and soon had three young children to care for.\n\nPatrick John (Pat): 1911-1991 John Francis (Jack): 1913-1976 Elizabeth Agatha (Betty): 1915-1990\n\nFollowing Irish traditions, the children were named after older family members. Pat, as the first-born boy, was named after his paternal grandfather, Patrick Carrucan. Jack was named after John Francis Sweeney, his mother’s younger brother and Betty was named after Elizabeth Agatha Sweeney, her mother’s older sister\n\nThe 1911 Post Office Directory has under Eltham the names of Michael Carrucan (gardener), Denis Carrucan (carrier) and Thomas Sweeney (farmer).\n\nIn late 1915, Mary’s youngest sister Kathleen married Frank Carrucan (a second marriage between the families) but tragedy struck when she died in childbirth. Mary and Mick took in the young baby, named Francis Kenny Carrucan (born 12th September 1916) and the family at the Dalton Street farm swelled from 3 to 4 children.\n\nMary Carrucan with baby John Francis (Jack) at Eltham in 1913\n\nThe Dalton Street farm and Culla Hill were the central points for the Carrucan and Sweeney families, now interconnnected with children, grandchildren, uncles and aunts. There was a constant flood of visitors to the Dalton Street farm on weekends from the now far flung clans. The old aunts were especially formidable with their lilting Irish brogue and their strong personalities and independent ways. My uncle Jack used to delight in telling how, whenever they saw some young woman expecting a baby, the comment would quickly come: “That poor gal. What brute of a man has done that!”\n\nBut this must be seen in the context of the day. The families were typically large and women were tied to their families by the constant drudgery of cooking, washing, working around the farm and looking after the farm animals. It was a tough life and not one that the old aunts saw in a very positive light.\n\nThe boys had to take the milking cows from the Dalton Street farm each morning up to the Bridge Road block and then bring them back each afternoon for milking. Uncle Jack told many stories of the adventures that this entailed. On one occasion the boys stopped at Burgoyne’s shop for some lollies and the cows sauntered off up the road on the well-worn trail. Fitzsimmons, the proprietor of the Eltham Hotel nearly had a heart attack when he walked into the main bar and was confronted by a cow. On another occasion, some thunder sent the dog wild and it got into Burgoyne’s shop and nearly wrecked it in its frenzied attempts to hide.\n\nThe following photo, taken around 1927, is at the side gate to the family house in Dalton St. and shows the old kitchen behind the fence. The picture shows Pat at the back and from left to right at front, Betty, Ken, Mary and Jack. The rigours of farming life are already telling on Mary who has lost her youthful look and is now looking all of her 50 years.\n\nPat (back) and from left to right at front, Betty, Ken, Mary and Jack\n\nWith the Depression of the late 1920’s putting huge pressure on the working class families of Melbourne, any school related aspirations were put aside by the boys. Each had to finish his education after Grade 7 and move into the workforce and earn a living to supplement the farm income.\n\nPatrick worked the farm for a while before moving north to the Goulburn Valley seeking greener pastures. Jack worked as a moulder and eventually inherited the family farm. Ken worked on another dairy farm in Eltham before working as a storeman lumping wheat bags in Eltham and then working for a timber merchant in Heidelberg. He was tall and strong and could hold his own with anyone.\n\nOnly Betty was given the opportunity to continue her education. She was a gifted student who won a scholarship to Melbourne Girls’ High School and from there won a senior government scholarship to Melbourne University. She was the first Eltham girl to go to University and was awarded a Newman College Exhibition. She gained a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and worked as a teacher in an illustrious career that spanned 40 years. She eventually retired in 1982 and died in 1990. She is buried at the Eltham Cemetery near Jack and Ken.\n\nMick would go afield on such jobs as hauling mining machinery up the wild Wood’s Point Road.\n\nCatherine Cuffley, who stayed with her Carrucan relatives in the 1930s, relates that Uncle Mick was well known at the local hostelry. After an evening of steady imbibing, he would be carried out and dumped in his dray, the innkeeper would slap the horse on its rump and Mick would be delivered safely home; however, some of our more staid relatives thought that was impossible for a Carrucan!\n\nAlthough Culla Hill had been lost to the Sweeneys in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the farm in Dalton Street continued in Carrucan hands with Mary and Jack continuing to work it after Mick’s death.\n\nOn Mary’s death 18 years later, the Diamond Valley News of November 28th 1961 carried the following obituary:\n\nThe death last week of Mrs Carrucan, the last surviving member of the Sweeney family, brought a long chapter of Eltham’s history to a close.\n\nIt was in 1838 that her grandfather, Thomas Sweeney, made his home at Culla Hill, a homestead of stone and mudbrick that still overlooks the Yarra the end of Sweeney’s Lane. Mrs Carrucan was born there in 1876, one of the ten children of John Sweeney.\n\nMISSING 182-183\n\nin cattle dealing. But during the intervening years until his death at 62 years of age, on 3rd May 1976, he was forced to subdivide the property even further and gradually sell off the remaining sections to make ends meet. Thus the area gradually changed from farming to housing as the suburbs encroached onto the farm.\n\nOn Jack’s death, the remainder of the property was sold off and the historic home was demolished to make way for a modern brick dwelling. The house was riddled with white ant infestations and would have taken a lot of money and effort to save and this was obviously not a viable proposition.\n\nJack was a prodigious teller of family stories but, alas, his early death meant that many of the stories died with him.\n\nCulla Hill now remains the only reminder of those early days. A unique opportunity was presented in 1997 when the property was auctioned so I made the pilgrimage to the old homestead that I had not visited since my childhood.\n\nJack Carrucan at the front gate of the Dalton Street farmhouse, circa 1970. When he died in 1976, the house was demolished and the property subdivided and sold. Now only the Cyprus tree behind Jack remains as a reminder of days past.\n\nThird Generation — 3: Elizabeth (Betty) Carrucan 13\n\nElizabeth Agatha (Betty), born on December 28th 1915, was the youngest of three children born to Mick and Mary Carrucan. Following the tradition of the day, she was named after two of her aunts.\n\nThe farm in Dalton Street was mixed, having cattle, poultry and an orchard and everyone had their allotted tasks. As a girl, Betty had to look after the poultry. She looked upon this task with great distain and harboured a lasting dislike of chooks throughout her life. In her later years at Heidelberg, she duly took her grandchildren next door to see the ‘chookies’ but little did they realize her behind-the-scenes thoughts.\n\nBetty was, even in those early days, a person of outstanding potential and personality and stood out as a pupil as she progressed through Eltham Elementary School.\n\nThe Advertiser of November 24, 1931 reported in length on the Eltham Higher Elementary School Prize night\n\nMr. Stewart presented The Rhodes Ideal Girls’ Prize, which was presented for the first time this year. This medal was donated by Mr. and Mrs. E. Smithers, to be awarded on the same basis as the medal which has been presented to the boys by Mr. A. Smithers for some years past. The winning of this medal demands not only scholastic attainment but also those other qualities that go towards making desirable citizens such as efficiency in sport, bearing and character. The announcement the award had been won by Betty Carrucan was a popular one.\n\nA scholarship enabled her to continue her schooling at Melbourne Girls High School (later to become McRobertson’s Girls High School) but it was not a unanimous family decision. Many of the older aunts felt that education was unnecessary for a country girl and that she should have left school like her brothers after completing Elementary School. It was a credit to her father, himself an uneducated man, that he made his own decision and gave her his blessing.\n\nMGHS Magazine Committee, 1933 — Betty is back left.\n\nThe following, short essay, written by Betty, was published in the December 1933 edition of PALLAS, the MGHS magazine.\n\nA TREATISE ON LOCKER ROOMS\n\nNaturally, when the transference from Government House to our present location was actually effected, one absorbing topic of conversation was the locker rooms. The stalwart frame of those fortunates who had revelled in the possession of top lockers were shaken with apprehension, lest an undignified descent from Olympian heights to the lower regions should befall them. But hope stirred in the hearts of those who had been experiencing the doubtful pleasures attendant upon bottom lockers – grovelling on the floor, the recipient of innumerable jogs, blows and avalanches of books and so forth.\n\nAh me! Woeful. reminiscences! Dashed hopes! Who will cease to recall without spinal convulsions that terrible week during which A and B forms were confined to one locker room. Dear me! Can that struggling, seething mass of frenzied humanity be composed of the dignified maidens of A, the studious virgins of B. Well! Well! As Milton so wittily remarks (or was it the optimistic Shakespeare’?) “How charming is divine philosophy.” For after all, who would not prefer the solace, the tranquillity of a congested locker room, with the addition of such thrills as a narrow escape from impalement on coat-hooks, or headlong descent of the staircase, to carrying one’s scholarly apparatus over the country side all day, in a portmanteau, or, worse still, clasped tenderly in the arms.\n\nWhat fatal discrepancies do oft occur, separating the existing state of affairs from the ideal. Standing in the middle of that locker room, I was so rash as to close my eyes and cover my ears. Then did I conjure up a soothing vision of girls, standing at attention, in orderly lines, each awaiting her turn to approach her locker. No clamor! No disorder! All was politeness and patience. Smiling beatifically, I ventured to look around me once more, that charming image lingering in my mind. Ah me! Bedlam! And, horrid fact, numerous irate damsels gesticulating angrily, waving particles of food in a menacing manner, declaring that I was blocking the passage. Ah Milton! How charming is divine philosophy. What may have been the climax I dare not imagine, but that the awesome form of a prefect appeared. How her sonorous voice resounded through the vaulted arches, as she carolled, “Clear the locker-room, please!” The girls filed meekly out, quailing under the eagle eye of that minion of the law.\n\nLet our conclusion be of the true lyrical type, permeated with hope, and calm serenity. 1 am now situated in an airy common room, the proud possessor of a top locker. The maidens about me are noted for their genteel deportment and impeccable manners. Lilting strains come floating over from the grand piano near-by. Bliss! How truly delightful an environment.\n\nB. Carrucan\n\nAfter an outstanding school career, she was awarded the Newman College Exhibition and a Senior Government Scholarship to attend Melbourne University. Thus she became the first girl from Eltham Higher Elementary School (and perhaps from Eltham overall) to attend University.\n\nWhile at University, she taught her father to read and write. It was not easy going for her by any means. She studied each night under the light of a hurricane lamp in the back room of the Eltham farmhouse and encountered considerable opposition to her studies from the old Irish relatives who saw no place in a girl’s life for a higher education.\n\nAs the depression set in during the thirties, she was forced to leave university for a year and work as the infant mistress at the Gold Street Primary School in Clifton Hill to help the family finances.\n\nShe went back to university after a year and graduated in 1938 with a B.A. Honours degree. In her graduating year were such luminaries as Sir Zelman Cowan (later to become Governor General of Australia) and Bob Santamaria.\n\nCareer opportunities for women were few at that time and Betty embarked on a teaching career. As was the case in those days, her first teaching appointments were in the country regions. She spent a few years at each of Korrumburra, Leongatha, Wangaratta and Stawell.\n\nWhile teaching at Stawell, she met a migrant Swedish miner, Gunnar Eric (Eric) Erickson, and they married in 1946. She soon gave up teaching to start a family and followed Eric as he moved with the mining to Captains Flat near Canberra and on to the Snowy Mountains Scheme, then in its early years. Her two oldest children, Michael and Terence, were born in the primitive and tough conditions of these mining towns.\n\nShe returned to Eltham in 1950, expecting a third child (Timothy) who was born in November. She then stayed on at the family farm at Dalton Street Eltham with her three young boys, relying on the good will of her family who were still relatively poor farmers.\n\nAround this time her health started to deteriorate and bad circulation in her legs became a recurring problem. She spent most of one year in the Royal Melbourne Hospital and, at one stage, looked likely to lose both her legs. She would not give in and eventually got back on her feet, gathered her boys back as a family and went back to work.\n\nIn those days, married women were not allowed to teach but she was able to get a part-time teaching position at Eltham High School through the intervention of Harry Moody, the principal, who had taught with her in the country. Her legs were still very bad and only her will to keep her family together kept her going.\n\nIn 1958 she took her boys to Queenstown in Tasmania where her husband Eric was working as an engineer with the Mt Lyell Copper Mines and she taught in the Queenstown School of Mines while there.\n\n1958 in Queenstown — Terry, Tim, Mick and Betty\n\nAfter a year, she returned to Eltham as her mother was very ill and the climate in Tasmania was too cold for her circulation. She taught at Heidelberg High School and stayed at Eltham until her mother died in 1961.\n\nHer teaching continued until she retired in 1978 at age 62 to look after her brother Pat who was recovering from a very serious heart attack. She was still keen to contribute so worked for the next four years teaching HSC English in the night school at Coburg High School. She finally retired from teaching in 1982 after a career spanning 44 years.\n\nRetirement for Betty meant the chance to do all the things previously denied to her by a tough family and work lifestyle. She entered into such activities as a film circle, a reading circle, membership of Heidelcare, membership of the Catholic Womens League (of which she become editor of their magazine Horizion and a life member), a more active role in St John’s Parish, membership in the Heidelberg branch of the Soroptimists and so on. The full list would be large indeed.\n\nFinally freed of financial constraints, her generosity towards all charities and to anyone in need was given full reign. Her idea was to use money rather than amass it and she gave freely to all in need. She felt no need for worldly possessions. Indeed most presents given to her were recycled to others.\n\nHer list of friends was large indeed and all her friendships were lasting – a tribute to her warmth and personal charisma. When she died on 6th March 1990 after a battle with cancer, the funeral mass of over 300 people bore witness to her deep impact on many people.\n\nSecond Generation — 3: Susan Carrucan 84\n\nSusan (Sue) Carrucan was born in 1862 at Eltham. She was the third eldest child of Patrick Carrucan and Mary O’Brien. She met and married Edward Shae Kent (Ned) at Eltham in 1881. Ned was born at Eltham circa 1858 and owned the Plenty Hotel, a pub in Diamond Creek, Christmas Hills and Bulleen and an orchard in Eltham.\n\nLower Plenty Hotel – Ned is seated on the horse and the woman seated on the verandah is probably Susan.\n\nSue and Ned had no children of their own but they reared or adopted John Thomas Flanagan who was orphaned by the age of 8 years, in 1887. He grew up with them and became a solicitor, working in Middle Brighton.\n\nNed died in 1907, aged 49 years, at Templestowe. At the time of his death, the Plenty Hotel in Heidelberg was the only hotel in his name. At that time, he also owned an orchard at Templestowe.\n\nFrom 1910 to at least the 1920s, Sue owned a home at 143 Church St, Brighton, called “Rothwell”. At some stage Sue moved to a large double storey house in Black Street, Middle Brighton. It was a brick home with a tower, called “Wyuna” and still stands today.\n\nSusan Kent nee Carrucan in later years\n\nMembers of the Carrucan family seemed to love Aunt Sue as she was bright, dressed well, cared for her herself as became a lady, and was very active. She visited, playing cards etc, and Carrucans stayed at her house and were taken to races and the like. She loved all things alive and kept goldfish. ……P191 The Carrucans\n\nELTHAM REMINISCENCES … Tim Erickson\n\nPatrick Carrucan (born circa 1831 in Doolin, County Clare, Ireland) and Mary O’Brien (born circa 1838 at Ennis, County Clare, Ireland ) were married in 1856 at Ennistimon, County Clare, Ireland. At that time, Mary was 19 and Patrick was 27. Later in that same year of 1856, they left Ireland, bound for Australia to join Patrick’s sister Bridget and her husband John Coleman in Eltham.\n\nBridget and John had already purchased and established their own farm in what is now known as Coleman’s Corner in Eltham North. It was not long before another farm of some 20 acres (3 large paddocks and a house block) was purchased for the new arrivals, in Dalton Street. An existing farm, it was bought by the Carrucans late in the 1850s from a family called Ball. Initially Patrick and Mary lived in a hut on the farm but Mary’s father Sylvester O’Brien came out from Ireland and built them a house at the corner of Dalton St and Bible St.\n\nPatrick and Mary arrived in Melbourne during the great gold rush period of the 1850s when large numbers of men walked from Melbourne up through Eltham to the Caledonia diggings. To the local Eltham farmers, the gold rush provided the chance for some prosperity with high prices for meat, potatoes and grain and the chance to carry goods to and from the goldfields. Patrick’s holdings soon swelled to incorporate a second property of some 15 acres on Main Road near Bridge Street and a third property of around 100 acres in Research.\n\nPatrick and Mary also owned an orchard but its wherabouts is uncertain. One school of thought is that it was out of town but the family view was that the orchard was opposite the Dalton St farmhouse where the dairy was subsequently built, in what was called ‘the bottom paddock’.\n\nMary and Patrick quickly established a family of 10 children: Bridget (1858), Michael (1860), Susan (1862), Patrick (1864), Thomas (1866 died as an infant), Mary Anne (1868), Catherine (1869), Margaret Theresa (1871), Frances (1872) and Annie (1874).\n\nWith such a large family, the lines of descendants quickly grew. Of the girls, Bridget married Patrick Lane in 1875, Susan married Edward Kent in 1881, Mary Anne married Jeremiah Lodge in 1895, Catherine married Laurence Foley in 1900, Margaret Theresa married Edward Bourke, Frances married Thomas Keane in 1896 and Annie married James Calnin in 1897. Thus direct descendant lines included Carrucans, Kents, Lodges, Foleys, Bourkes, Keanes and Gamins. But more of that later.\n\nA wonderful insight into the life of an Eltham farmer can be gleaned from a personal diary, kept by local farmer John Sweeney.\n\nMonday July 2, 1883 Ploughing\n\nTuesday – Thursday Cutting wood for Melbourne\n\nFriday Mary Murray here\n\nSaturday At home all day\n\nSunday At home. Mary Benson here in evening.\n\nMonday – Tuesday Ploughing\n\nWednesday Ploughing\n\nThursday Working about farm\n\nFriday Ploughing for Mr Gordon\n\nSaturday Working at home.\n\nAnnie and Agatha went up to Murrays in evening.\n\nSunday At home all day\n\nMonday Ploughing in morning.\n\nWent to Mrs ? funeral in evening.\n\nTuesday Ploughing for Mr Gordon\n\nWednesday Mick (Carrucan) went to Melbourne with wood\n\nThursday Ploughing for Mr Gordon\n\nThe diary goes on with monotonous regularity. The diet was one of cutting wood, ploughing, planting or digging up potatoes, taking produce or wood to Melbourne to sell and the various special occasions when someone visited or the family visited someone. This was subsistence farming at its purest – nothing excess, everything done with a reason and to an end. With large families of up to 10 children, it was without doubt a continual struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table.\n\nThe diary also lists the cost of labour in shillings.\n\n1 Day Ploughing 15/-\n\n1 Day cutting firewood 15/-\n\n1/2 day carting soil 7/6\n\nCarting wood to Melbourne 19/-\n\nOf special interest to us is a diary reference to Michael Carrucan, the eldest son of Patrick and Mary.\n\nMichael Carrucan commenced to work for me on Tuesday the 10th day of April 1883 at the rate of fifteen shillings a week. J. F. Sweeney Culla Hill, Eltham.\n\nWhen Patrick went to market, he left at 4:00pm and arrived at the market by midnight. Mary (who was said to be illiterate) would accost the first farmer returning from market and ask the price of cherries, etc., so that she would know how much Patrick should be handing over.\n\nAs if 10 children was not enough, the family swelled further in the early 1880s when a young Michael John O’Heare was sent to live with the family. Sargeant Michael O’Heare was a policeman who somehow knew the Carrucan family in Eltham. He and his wife Ellen (nee Burns) had twelve children including Michael John who was born in 1879 in Geelong. The young Michael was only about three when his mother died in 1882 and his father was possibly forced to foster out some or all of his children.\n\nIn later years, Jack Carrucan described how his father Michael Carrucan took the lad with him on various trips to Woods Point when hauling supplies with horse teams, probably in the late 1880s when gold mining was in full swing in that area. Later, Michael O’Heare became a well known solicitor in Melbourne, a founder of the firm Cole and O’Heare and the Carrucan family solicitor.\n\nNow Woods Point seems a "
