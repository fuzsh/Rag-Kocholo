Our work on the Dorset records owes a great deal to the interchange between REED editors and other students of the drama, interchange fostered by REED and nurtured by the project's founder and director, Alexandra F. Johnston, and the indefatigable efforts of executive editor, Sally-Beth MacLean. Their wisdom, expertise, breadth of vision, and sheer energy teach and inspire and also serve as catalysts for a remarkable generation of ideas. We are enormously grateful to them and to other REED editors from whom we have learned a great deal. We would like, in particular, to thank Sally-Beth MacLean for her unfailing encouragement, her skilful coordination of REED'S work on the Dorset records, her insightful assessment of each section of the collection, and her work on first proofs. Associate editor Abigail Ann Young's editorial suggestions have been invaluable, as have her meticulous paleographical corrections, translations of Latin documents, and creation of the Latin Glossary; we greatly admire the breadth and precision of her knowledge. The patience and skill Miriam Skey brought to the sometimes frustrating process of copy-editing and proof-reading the text have been enormously helpful as has been her relentless bibliographical work. We are most grateful for Arleane Ralph's many hours of work on the lists of patrons and travelling companies, for her scrupulous but genial attention to detail in proofing the entire collection, and for her willingness to tackle the thankless task of a two-collection index. REED: Dorset owes a great deal also to Sheena Levitt's expertise in financial administration; to Theodore DeWelles' bibliographic work; to William Cooke for the English Glossary; to Richard Gyug, Philip Collington, and William Cooke for paleographical checking; to Catherine Emerson for checking the Latin Glossary and Translations; and to William Rowcliffe for typesetting the collection. Subash Shanbhag of the Department of Geology at the University of Toronto furnished us with a modern map of Dorset. British archivists, librarians, and holders of manuscript collections have welcomed two North American scholars and given us a great deal of much-needed assistance in locating, identifying, and interpreting the records. Most important has been the help given by the several archivists at the Dorset Record Office and their staffs: Hugh Jaques, Dorset County Archivist, and his predecessor, Margaret Holmes; principal archivist, Sarah Bridges; assistant and junior archivists, Caroline Ferris, Jennifer Hofmann, M. Prescott, David C. Reeves, and Mary Rose; and read ing room assistant Felicity Cohen. I.K.D. Andrews, Town Clerk of Poole, and G.M. Smith, then Curator of Museums at Poole, were extraordinarily helpful, permitting us to see some damaged records in early stages of repair and to examine manuscripts on display in the Poole DORSET Museum as well as those then held in the Poole Borough Archives. John Warmington, Librarian of Sherborne School, made available some of the parish's earliest manuscripts, then kept in the subterranean reaches of the school. We also thank Tom Mayberry of the Somerset Record Office, S.D. Hobbs, County Archivist, and J. d'Arcy, Principal Archivist, at the Wiltshire Record Office and his staff. Mark Nicholls, Deputy Keeper of Manuscripts, Cambridge Uni versity Library, and Peter McNiven, head of Special Collections at the John Rylands Library in Manchester, kindly checked documents for us. Others who checked documents included Michael Heaney, who verified entries at the Bodleian and other Oxford libraries and aJso transcribed quotations from the manuscript of Leland's Itinerary; Alasdair Hawkyard, who worked on the voluminous and scarcely legible membranes of Condytt v. Chubbe at the Public Record Office; Eileen White, who confirmed readings of manuscripts at the Wiltshire Record Office and who also located and did preliminary transcriptions of ecclesiastical court records; and Julia Merntt and Monica Ory, who checked PRO records. Claire Breay checked records at the British Library and helped us secure reproductions of the earliest map of Dorset, Alan Fletcher checked records at Marsh's Library, Dublin, and Adrian Moon did some early checking of records at the Dorset Record Office. We are especially appreciative of the efficient and expert work of Richard Samways who did extensive checking of records at the Dorset Record Office, the Poole Borough Archives, and the Weymouth Museum as well as locating and transcribing records at the PRO. Among the many scholars with whom we have discussed this collection we particularly thank James Stokes, REED editor for neighbouring Somerset, for his generous sharing of records relevant to both counties and for the assistance his findings gave us in interpreting the Dorset records. John Elliott, Jr alerted us to relevant material in Robert Ashley's autobiography and Father Owen Lee clarified crucial aspects of the Dorchester show for Bishop Thornborough. Early discussions of Dorset material with John Fowles, David Underdown, Adrian Moon, and the late Maureen Weinstock were also helpful. Each of us has benefitted from the enthusiasm and informed interest of colleagues as well, particularly Sister Mary Clemente Davlin, O.P., of Dominican University (formerly Rosary College), Lynne Magnusson of the University of Waterloo, and Paul Stevens of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. Financial support for the work on the Dorset records has included grants to REED from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC) and the National Endowment for the Humanities, a substantial individual SSHRCC research grant, and generous grants from Fadier Edward Jackman, O.P., and the Jackman Foundation. A sabbatical leave from Dominican University supported work with the records. St Jerome's University offered both moral and financial support for the research and both universities supported the presentation of preliminary results at several scholarly conferences. We are most grateful to the following libraries and owners for permission to quote extracts from documents in their possession: the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford; the British Library; the Dorset Record Office; the Public Record Office; the Somerset Record Office; the Wiltshire and Swindon Record Office; and the Weymouth and Portland Borough Council.

Finally, we thank our families. Rebecca and David Hays' enjoyment of enforced Dorset vacations taught their mother about parts of Dorset she might otherwise have missed and they tolerated many more 'bo-o-oring' conversations about Dorset records than any child or teenager should have to endure. Haley McGee, first as a baby and then as a toddler, made research trips to Dorset more complex - and enormously more fun - for her father, and Rory McGee has graciously put up with stories of times and travels before his time. Donna Penrose has been a constant source of perspective, support, and love throughout all the years of work on this project. Jo Hays provided a willing ear, a thoughtful editorial eye for drafts of the histor ical introduction, and love that is beyond price. Historical Background Modern Dorset - apart from her eastern urban complex - has remained a pre-eminently rural county, still displaying much of the rustic and sometimes wild country and parochial culture described by Thomas Hardy and the Dorset poet William Barnes. The shire attracts fewer tourists than more spectacular Devon and Cornwall, Hampshire's Southampton overshadows Dorset's ports, and the main routes westward from London or Salisbury to Exeter or Bristol now cross through only the narrow northern part of the county. There seems a striking continu ity between the modern shire and the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century county, it, too, was prosperous, overwhelmingly rural, and of little importance in national affairs, and early modern travellers to the west country tended to bypass most of the county.1 Dorset's terrain is extraordinarily varied. The centre of the county is dominated by the broad crescent of the chalk downs that sweeps north and west from the rocky coast east of Portland, turning east to join eventually with the range that continues through Wiltshire to the Marlborough and Berkshire downs. This high and broad range of hills has encouraged continuous patterns of settlement and farming since at least Roman times. The hilltops are most useful as pastureland, land that supports the animals so important for the fertilizing value of their manure on the rich arable in the well-watered river valleys between the hills.2 The downs were first settled in neolithic times and more thoroughly cultivated during the four centuries of Roman dominance in Dorset; the pattern of settlement continued and expanded after the belated Saxon conquest of the county. Thus, cultivation of the chalk down country after Domes- day was an extension and development of long-standing patterns of land use. Both the pastures on the hilltops and the use of valley ploughland favoured collective agriculture, and medieval and early modern downland Dorset was typified by nucleated villages and important manors. The heath country between the rocky Isle of Purbeck in southeastern Dorset and the arc of the chalk downs has relatively acidic and, hence, poor soil; it was perhaps settled and cultivated most fully by the Saxons. Early Purbeck farmers could eke out a living but the area was most valuable in the medieval period for the limestone and marble quarried for building. And al though there were isolated farmsteads throughout the county from prehistoric times, the heavier clays in Blackmoor Vale and in northern and western Dorset, regions also more heavily wooded than the down country, were more profitably cultivated only after the development of medieval agricultural technology. Seventy-five miles of coast and easy access to important shipping routes have meant that DORSET much of Dorset's history and several of her more important towns have been linked to the sea. Both small river mouths and natural harbours could admit the vessels bringing Roman, Saxon, or Danish invaders or the small ships carrying medieval and later coastal commerce. Much of that coast is dominated, however, by magnificent but unmanageable cliffs; havens useful in the medieval centuries were less accessible to the larger sixteenth-century ships. Only the natural harbours at Weymouth-Melcombe Regis and Poole and the artificial harbour at Lyme Regis were to be of more than local importance after 1500. Nonetheless, much of Dorset's interchange with the world outside the county was by sea, so much so that sometimes the coastal towns seem to have had more to do with their trading partners outside the shire than with inland regions of the county itself. Dorset was relatively well-developed at the time of the Conquest. Its country was 'heart land' that boasted nearly 300 mills, and the moderate development and expansion of the arable in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was accompanied by population growth but not radical social change.3 The county borders are ancient and have changed but little from the borders implicit in the process of the Saxon conquest (modern county reorganizations have exchanged a few parishes between Dorset and Devon; more importantly, territory including Bournemouth and Christchurch was added to the eastern end of the county). In the medieval period the county had close connections with the king: nearly forty Dorset manors made William i the most important landlord in the shire, and several medieval kings spent fair periods of time in Dorset, with Dorchester an important point on the itineraries of Edward I and Edward n. The west country had, of course, been the core of Alfred's territory in the ninth century; it witnessed civil war both immediately after the Conquest and during the conflict between Stephen and Matilda when Dorset castles at Sherborne, Powerstock, Wareham, and Corfe were besieged. Sharing a sheriff with Somerset during much of the medieval period, Dorset was a frequent source of supply for royal ventures.\" Dorset's religious life was shaped by institutions initially founded in the Saxon period. The county was originally in the diocese of Sherborne: that see was united to that of Ramsbury, Wiltshire, in 1058 and the bishop moved to Old Sarum after 1075. Under the bishop of Salisbury's jurisdiction until 1542 (when the county was joined to the new diocese of Bristol), several sections of the county were in one or another peculiar jurisdiction that provided some ecclesiastical independence, most notably the very large parish and royal peculiar centred on the royal free chapel of Wimborne Minster, and the peculiar of the dean of Salisbury that pre served both the property rights and influence of the dean and prebends of Salisbury Cathedral within Dorset even after the shire was joined to Bristol diocese. Much of the pattern of parish and monastic life was firmly rooted, however, in the Saxon church. Saxon Dorset was dominated by the huge parishes of the minster churches, some of which still served large parishes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although many former dependencies had acquired parochial independence in the intervening years. Sizeable monasteries at Abbotsbury, Cerne Abbas, Shaftesbury, and Milton Abbas were beginning to serve as centres for towns by the time of the Conquest. These houses and three others - Sherborne Abbey (the Benedictine monastery which became the focus of Sherborne life after Sherborne's bishop moved to Sarum), the college of secular canons at Wimborne Minster (founded after an earlier monastery was HISTORICAL BACKGROUND destroyed in the late tenth-century Danish invasion), and the twelfth-century Cistercian house at Bindon - dominated monastic life in Dorset until the Dissolution; although the friars were active in the county, their houses were never so influential as the large pre-Conquest monas teries. Expanded land use, such technological developments as the horizontal loom and the fulling mill, and the emigration of skilled craftsmen from guild-dominated towns to the countryside were among the factors that stimulated the growth of west country cloth production in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, particularly in the cheese country of Somerset and Wiltshire. The Dorset sheep herds also grew during this period and contributed to the growth of local wool cloth production. As prosperous agricultural communities developed markets, the Dorset markets and small market towns also grew. J.H. Bettey tells us that four Domesday Dorset boroughs (Bridport, Dorchester, Shaftesbury, Wareham; Wimborne Minster also had burgesses) were joined by ten other boroughs by the end of the fourteenth century, including the successful ports of Lyme Regis, Melcombe Regis, Poole, and Weymouth.\" The Black Death entered England through Melcombe Regis and it is probable that Dorset lost a higher percentage of its people than other rural counties to the initial epidemic and fre quent recurrence of disease in the next three centuries. Some villages were deserted, particu larly in wilder, more heavily wooded west Dorset and in the Blackmoor Vale. In the chalk country and in most towns, population loss resulted in the contraction of economic activity in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, although it is possible growing sheep flocks may be linked to shrinking population and arable acreage in the downlands. Fifteenth- and sixteenth- century growth of such coastal towns as Poole and Lyme Regis, on the other hand, was import ant to the general economic recovery of Tudor Dorset.7 An early seventeenth-century description of the county may serve to emphasize the con tinued rural character of the shire in the early modern period: Though the Aire of this Territorie bee good and healthfull, yet is not the Soyle barren, but rich and fruitfull ... The more Northerne Part, divided from the South almost by a con- tinuall Ridge of high Hills, is somewhat flat, and was in foregoeing Ages wholely Forrests; neither is it yet in this decaying Age of ours altogether destitute of Timber Trees, and Woods; abounding also with verie good Pastures, and Feedeings for Cattell; watered with fine Streames, which take their Courses through rich Meadowes . . . the South Parte . . . consisteth altogether of Hills, (Downes we call them ... ) all overspread with innumerable Flockes of Sheepe, for which it yeelds very good and sound Feedeing, and from which the Countrie hath reaped an unknowen Gaine. Valleys it hath diverse, but not large, in the which, for the most parte, the Townes and Gentlemens Houses are seated, for avoideing those sharpe Blasts which this Southerne Parte is subject to; for it is somethinge wilde, and verie destitute of Woods; Cornefeilds they have plentie, which seldome deceive the Husbandmans Expecta tion; and adjoyneing to the Rivers good Meadowes, though not in soe great Plentie as the North Parte of the Shire... It is generallie well watered with Rills, and swift runneing Brookes; which, passeing through the Plaines and Valleys, doe at the last in a most loveing manner unite themselves, 10 DORSET and of their manie Branches make two bigge bodied Streames, Frome and Slower, both passeing full of good Fish, which neverthelesse is not soe much respected there, because the adjoyneing Sea doeth furnish the Countrie with all Kindes of Fish.\" Most striking about Thomas Gerard's description of Dorset is the extraordinarily rural tone of his account, perhaps to be expected in the voice of a member of the gentry most interested in the fortunes of his own kind. But some circumstances conspired to preserve Dorset's relative isolation. There were in the county few large landholders of national prominence: Henry vu's mother, Margaret Beaufort, had close connections with Wimborne and was eventually buried in the minster; Sir Christopher Hatton was for a time at Corfe Castle, later purchased by Sir John Bankes, attorney-general to Charles I; and Sir Walter Ralegh spent much time at his seat at Sherborne Castle and exercised both patronage and authority in Sherborne. For the most part, however, such figures from national politics had little to do with the county and Dorset politics remained in the hands of prosperous local gentry families, headed by the Strangways of Abbotsbury and Melbury Sampford. Gerard's impression in the 1620s was that the Dorset gentlemen were 'for the most pane ... of antient Descent' although freeholders, profiting from 'rakt Rent ... doe now beginne much to encroch upon the Gentrie,' producing occasion ally new 'Families of note.'9 It is notable that he found Dorset gentlemen essentially local worthies, although they sometimes bought lands or intermarried with families from neighbour ing counties. The considerable social upheaval in Dorset in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries - almost 50 per cent of the leading families in the 1630s first appeared among the Dorset gentry after 1529 — was fed by immigration, notably of Devonshire gentry families, the purchase of confiscated monastic properties by lesser Crown servants and local gentry, the social rise of local farmers, the economic success of Dorset merchants, and the occasional movement of local town patricians into the ranks of country gentlemen. As David Underdown has argued eloquently in Fire from Heaven, prominent Dorset men could be very much aware of national and international events. But Dorset's own affairs were generally her own; the county was largely free from the domination of aristocrats or of political figures of national influence.1\" Dorset apparently adapted successfully and reasonably peacefully to the changing agricultural markets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The flocks pastured on the downs increased greatly and there were frequent enclosures of downland commons for both sheep pasture and arable, often by common agreement of the tenants or between the tenants and a great land lord. By the seventeenth century the county boasted twenty-one important markets and forty- six annual fairs; by far the most important fair was the centrally-located September fair at Woodbury Hill near Bere Regis, which attracted many visitors from outside the shire.\" From the early seventeenth century there were also experiments with water meadows, and some increased specialization and some expansion of pasturage and arable into cleared and enclosed waste and forest also occurred in the claylands of Blackmoor Vale and the west country. Apparently such developments occasioned little social upheaval in most cases, although in the 1620s and early 1640s riots followed the disafforesting of Gillingham, riots Joan Thirsk associ ates with general, multifaceted economic depression and David Underdown with attacks on HISTORICAL BACKGROUND the 'clique of courtiers and Londoners' whom local villagers saw as responsible for the disaf- forestation.12 Expanded exploitation of the land contributed to Dorset s general prosperity. Indeed, u general, the pattern of Dorset's early modern development was one of growth and successful adaptation of an economy that nonetheless remained second rank. Dorset's growing herds supplied a sizeable Dorset broadcloth manufacture in the fifteenth century, for example; weavers were turning to both the newer dyed cloths and narrower and cheaper kersies and 'Dorset dozens' by the early seventeenth, and Dorset ports exported cloth made in Somerset as well as Dorset. But the centre of marketing for the expanding cloth trade lay to the north in Wiltshire and Somerset, and Dorset cloth was considered inferior to that of neighbouring counties. Similarly, enterprising Dorset coast towns took advantage of new opportunities for growth. Poole and Weymouth early joined the new trade with the fisheries of Newfoundland, import ing and re-exporting Newfoundland fish with great profit, and Bridport and Lyme Regis may have helped redistribute the fish in southwest England. The manufacture of sailcloth and rope, particularly for shipping and the navy, were important industries in west Dorset, especially at Bridport, and Dorset was also one of the chief sixteenth-century woad-producing shires. But despite considerable growth, Dorset's coastal commerce was adversely affected by the shift of commercial shipping to London: the harbours at Lyme Regis, Weymouth-Melcombe Regis, and Poole were also too small or shallow to allow for the increasingly large ships that became the commercial carriers and more important naval vessels of the sixteenth century.13 Tudor governments— like their medieval predecessors - brought sometimes reluctant Dorset coast towns into the structure of coordinated English maritime defence, building additional coastal forts, such as Sandsfoot Castle, near Weymouth. Dorset coast towns were all involved to some extent in furnishing ships to fight the Armada but their participation was mainly through money or the provision of small, armed merchant ships, a fact reflecting the strong but secondary prosperity of these small, vital ports, important for supporting the larger ships against the Armada, as they were important for supporting coastal shipping increasingly dominated by London. Perhaps symbolic of the enterprising, flexible, and very localized character of county commerce is the county's involvement in privateering, smuggling, and piracy in the late sixteenth century. At least thirty-six ships from Weymouth, Lyme Regis, and Poole captured foreign prizes as part of the privately financed maritime activities against Spain after 1585. Pirates based first in West Lulworth, and later in Purbeck, were linked to members of the Dorset gentry, to the deputy of the vice admiral for the Isle of Purbeck, and to the deputy searcher for Weymouth-Melcombe Regis, as was discovered during Crown in quiries of the 1570s and 1580s, and both pirates and smugglers operated with the cooperation of villagers in the hinterlands, town officials from several towns, and profit-taking merchants and gentry. The piracy was suppressed and the pirates hanged from gallows stretched out over the sea. But smuggling continued as a cooperative local enterprise adding to the profits of enterprising agriculture and successful town adaptation to the Tudor market economy.\"1 The prosperity of the county is reflected in the growth of Dorset's towns in the sixteenth century (records of performance activity survive largely from towns that were successful), in the increased amount of land brought under cultivation and the innovative techniques used 12 DORSET in agriculture, and in the apparent complacency and increasingly visible affluence of Dorset gentry. Prosperity is also reflected in the relative placidity of the shire's relationship to national signs of conflict. Dorset was divided, for example, about religion in the sixteenth and seven teenth centuries. But signs of Lollardy had been less frequent in Dorset than elsewhere in the west country - there was a great deal of church rebuilding in fifteenth-century Dorset - and Dorset monasteries surrendered to Henry vin's commissioners peacefully.\" Conflict about religion seems generally confined to town or parish in the succeeding generations, perhaps in part because Dorset's 1542 assignment to the often headless diocese of Bristol and the con sequent lack of effective episcopal supervision during Elizabeth's reign made difficult enforcement of any policy against local sentiment. When Devon and Cornwall rose in the conservative 'prayerbook rising' of 1549, Dorset remained calm. The county's quiescence probably did not, however, mean enthusiastic support for reformed religion, for the county militia fought only reluctantly against their more passionate neighbours.\"' In the Elizabethan period Puritanism gradually gained a hold in many towns, particularly in Dorchester and Poole, but several prominent Dorset families preserved Catholic traditions. Attempts to stamp out undesirable religious opinion tended to be inconsistent and probably limited in their effect. For example, Elizabethan efforts against Catholicism resulted in the execution of priests at Dorchester in the 1580s and 1590s, but in 1592 a member of one of Dorset's more prominent Catholic famil ies was appointed to the commission supposed to uncover Jesuits in the county; seventeenth- century presentments from the Wimborne peculiar show the church pursuing both recusants and sabbath breakers. Religious factionalism was a prominent factor in the quarrels that divided several Dorset towns early in James is reign, and by the 1630s Archbishop Laud's visitors found many Dorset Puritans, particularly in Poole, Dorchester, and Lyme Regis, but the Dorset countryside still harboured considerable anti-Puritan sentiment.17 Any interpretation of the records of performance activity in Dorset must consider Under- down's recent challenging interpretation of early seventeenth-century popular politics and culture, particularly in the west country. In Revel, Riot, and Rebellion, Underdown argues for a model of understanding popular culture in the region, based on contrasts between '\"tradi tional\" areas of open-field, sheep-corn husbandry in the nucleated villages of the chalk down- lands, and the more individualistic economies and settlement patterns of the north Somerset and Wiltshire cheese and cloth-making country; with the less industrially developed pasture region in south-east Somerset and Blackmore Vale representing an intermediate type in respect of both economic and settlement patterns.'1\" He describes a Tudor and Stuart England in which there was a natural survival of popular traditions of various sorts. Communities often maintained such traditions because of civic pride as well as local sentiment and sometimes abandoned them for practical reasons, when other fund-raisers or fund-raising techniques seemed more efficient or profitable than traditional merry-makings. Moreover, campaigns against traditional feasts - against traditional popular culture - were fuelled by a 'preoccupation with social discipline . . . visible at all levels of English life'1'1 that ranged 'the Protestant country gentry and middling sort . . . against what they perceived as the corrupt and popish extravag ance of the Court and its hangers-on' and also 'ranged many of the gentry, the Puritan clergy and their allies among the respectable parish notables against the bulk of their social inferiors HISTORICAL BACKGROUND and the poor.'2\" The campaign for moral reform was generally more successful, he believes, in wood-pasture regions. Traditional festivals and other plebeian amusements survived longer, and continued to reflect an older notion of community' in the arable downlands, while a few pasture regions - including Dorset's Blackmoor Vale - remained 'as culturally conservative as the downlands.'21 Underdown's work has been the object of much cogent criticism, summarized succinctly by Ronald Hutton.22 As Hutton indicates, Underdown's topographical analysis has borne the brunt of criticism, notably by Martin Ingram, who found similar patterns of declining festiv ity in Wiltshire regions of all types. Finding revels and Robin Hood games throughout all regions of Somerset and staunch defence of 'traditional entertainment' in the 'heart of wood- pasture areas,' James Stokes similarly concludes that 'reform-minded justices' had more to do with efforts at controlling traditional entertainment than Somerset's topography and that 'support for traditional culture' had 'less to do with class and income level than with whether one was native to the area or a recent immigrant.'25 Nor does our examination of Dorset evid ence yield more support for Underdown's model, although our conclusions must be even more tentative than Stokes' or Ingram's. A major difficulty in fitting Dorset into Underdown's framework is the peculiarities of the Dorset evidence. For much of the period with which we are concerned ecclesiastical records are fragmentary; no sixteenth-century Bristol bishops' registers or ecclesiastical court books survive, for example. Although there are extant quarter session records for other counties - the Somerset evidence is particularly rich - for Dorset there is only a single order book (1625-37). Most of the Dorset evidence for performance activity comes from towns, generally outside the framework of Underdown's regional analysis (although he suggests that most of the towns shared political views with the rural areas around them). In general, we find it difficult in Dorset to distinguish clear geographical patterns for survival or disappearance of popular custom. Indeed, Underdown's model implies a general cultural conservatism in the Dorset countryside, where there was little that could rival the 'individualistic' enterprise of the north Somerset and Wiltshire cheese country. Much of the Dorset evidence does suggest, however, that the decline or continued support for revelry or traditional custom was partly associated with 'religious beliefs and the fear of disorder.' Like Hutton, we think that Underdown's 'stress upon the power of ideology may well be correct.'\" Second, a detailed examination of the Dorset evidence suggests that individual pieces do not always fit Underdown's use of them. For example, Underdown talks of James is reign as a 'transitional period,' during which festivals survived in many places; he states that at 'Cerne Abbas the maypole survived the earlier Puritan attack, only to be cut down to make a town ladder in 1635, just when maypoles were reappearing in other places after the second Book of Sports.'\" Since the only surviving reference to the Cerne Abbas maypole relates to its destruc tion, the Cerne maypole may have languished unused for several years before the parishioners used it for timber, or it may first have been built in 1634. Surely the reference cannot support Underdown's indication on a map showing Dorset popular festivals that 1635 was the 'latest recorded date' for a public revel in Cerne Abbas.2\" Other points where we think Underdown or others have used Dorset evidence incorrectly will be indicated in endnotes to the records. In brief, we find Underdown's discussion of patterns of social and economic change stimu- 14 DORSET lacing, as is much of his discussion of the geographical distribution of Dorset political sentiment during the 1640s and 1650s; we can, however, only regard his framework for understanding regional patterns of cultural conflict as unproved in the case of the county whose records we have examined. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Dorset, like the rest of England, was experi encing far-reaching changes in economic and social structure. Generally Dorset's reflection of the national pattern is seen both in the county's moderately successful response to economic setbacks and opportunity and in the increasing gulf between the expanded ranks of the gentry and successful middling sort and the expanding ranks of the poor. Various communities suc ceeded in different ways in adapting to change, just as individuals succeeded in different ways; some of the differences in success or failure are almost certainly reflected in the continuance or abandonment of traditional culture, including both revelry and performance. A comprehen sive and convincing model for understanding those differences, however, has yet to be written; promising elements of that model may be the ideology stressed by Hutton and his suggestion that 'the principal development of the early Stuart period in the history of [the old festive] culture [was] to turn it into a national political issue.'27 Boroughs and Major Market Towns BLANDFORD FORUM 'A faire Markett Towne' in the 1620s, 'pleasantlie seated upon the River, and neare unto the Downes,'2\" Blandford Forum had begun to develop as a trading centre by the mid-twelfth century. The town had several advantages over its immediate neighbours: it straddled a major crossing of the Stour, one of Dorset's two largest rivers, and several roads converged there, including both the road connecting Poole to the hinterland of northwest Dorset and Somerset, and the main route from Dorchester to Salisbury, described by a writer of 1 588 as part of a major secondary route between Exeter and London.21 Although medieval Blandford only twice sent members to parliament, there were markets in the town by the early thirteenth century and Edward I granted fairs on the feast of the apostles Peter and Paul (29 June) and on the vigil of saints Simon and Jude (28 October) and the fifteen days following, and James i would confirm a one-day fair on St Mathias' Day (24 February).3\" By the Elizabethan period Bland- ford Forum was a thriving country town with well-known markets and fairs. A council often capital burgesses, headed by a bailiff, ran the town with advice from a steward appointed by the duchy of Lancaster.\" The burgesses appointed chamberlains to carry out the main execut ive responsibilities of the town's government. In 1605 the community, then numbering perhaps 500-800 people, received a charter confirming its customs and giving the town lord ship of the manor for which it would pay fee farm to the duchy. By that time Blandford was exempt from manorial control and could appoint stewards for its own court leet.32 Several signs suggest that in the sixteenth century Blandford was profiting from its position as a county market town. A fire in 1570 had destroyed the town hall, and the community undertook to build a new one, drawing on loans and gifts from individual burgesses as well as on funds from various Blandford charities. The new hall was built by 1593 and in 1610 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Camden, commenting on the town's phoenix-like recovery, would claim the town was 'built more elegantly, and is better peopled with inhabitants.'\" The town's sense of community appeared not only in its successful building campaign but also in the variety of ways the town raised funds, ranging from the several different ales featured in the Elizabethan chambetlains' accounts and the renting of space to players to the sponsorship of annual races after 1600.\" The Puritan preacher William Kethe. rector of tiny Child Okeford, denounced a Dorset parish in his sermon to the justices at Blandford sessions in 1571 and it is tempting to guess that the parish that profaned its sabbath with 'bulbeatynges, boulynges, drunkennes, daun- cynges, and such lyke' (see p 1 18) was Blandford itself. If so, the parish, according to Kethe, staunchly resisted the reforming minister. We know little of Blandford's internal affairs, how ever; repeated and devastating town fires, most notably that in 1731, destroyed most Bland- ford records. BRIDPORT The Brit river flows into the sea through an impressive gap between East and West Cliffs; the cliffs thus provide a sheltered river anchorage for small ships. Some distance north of the anchorage, in the angle formed by the Asker and Woth rivers as they join the Brit, was the settlement that became Bridport, perhaps originally developed in connection with Anglo- Saxon defence. By the time of the Conquest the town numbered about 120 houses. In the thirteenth century the draining and cultivation of the Marshwood Vale fostered the growing of hemp on land ideaJly suited to it; King John, who had visited the town a few years earlier, ordered Bridport sailcloth and hemp thread for ships' cables in 1211. The development of flax and hemp growing between Bridport and Beaminster contributed in turn to Bridport's growth; the harbour and the manufacture of rope and sailcloth - particularly for naval stores — were to prove the focus of Bridport's economy. By the fifteenth century the growing urbanity of a town increasingly shaped by its relationship to trade and manufacturing may be seen in the numerous confraternities founded in each of the two local churches.\" Although until the late fourteenth century Bridport's river was still too underdeveloped to provide more than a mooring for ships perhaps a mile and a half from the town itself, by the reign of Edward in Bridport sea captains participated in the Gascon wine trade and Bridport rope and sail manufacture was recognized by the Crown. Late fourteenth-century efforts to dredge the Brit and build a well-developed harbour set what was to be the pattern for the remainder of our period: time and again Bridport tried to gain permission and raise funds to build a well-equipped harbour but never managed to construct and maintain anything but a safe landing site for small ships.3\" In the meantime, Bridport activity in an increasingly complex rope manufacture had grown. Even by 1315 many of the townsmen's assets included flax, hemp, and rope, and by 1530 Bridport successfully petitioned for a local monopoly of hemp selling and rope making. The town's prominence in the industry came 'mainly as a result of the very high quality of the local hemp and flax.'37 So well known was the Bridport hemp that a sixteenth-century morality play could use 'taw halters of Burporte' as an image for a hangman's noose.3\" By the 1590s, 16 DORSET however, the town's rope production had begun to decline as did seventeenth-century Bridport's domination of the industry. Contributing to the decline were Bridport's cumbersome organ ization of the trade, high transportation costs related to relatively poor overland transport as well as the silted-up harbour, and competition, both from rope-walks near to the naval yards and from Dutch and Russian hemp, of somewhat higher quality than the Dorset product.\" Bridport sent members to parliament regularly after 1295; her government was a self- perpetuating council of capital burgesses. In his Itinerary Leland called her a 'fair larg town' in the 1530s4\" but it was not until 1593 that Elizabeth granted the town a market and fairs, including a one-day fair on the feast of the Annunciation (25 March), a three-day fair on the feast of the Ascension (the Thursday following Rogation Sunday), and a one-day fair at Michael mas. In her grant the queen stated that Bridport was 'an ancient Borough and mercantile town and formerly was a port of great celebrity and resort until the entrance and ascent of the same port were lately choked by the sand of the sea and almost blocked up, by reason of which the same Borough in commerce and merchandise is diminished and deteriorated and the buildings and edifices of the same Borough are in great decay ruin and dissolation.'41 The queen was probably responding to requests from Bridport burgesses, whose determination to revive the town's economic health Robert Tittler sees in the celebrations surrounding the opening of a new market house in 1593.42 The influence of an active local group of Puritans may also be visible in Bridport's quick support for parliament in 1642.43 Consensus like that of 1642 was not easily obtained earlier in the century, when Puritanism set Bridport citizens at odds with one another. In 1614 allegedly libellous verses attacked The puritans of Bridporte Towne' as smug, self-righteous hypocrites whose supposedly religious gatherings masked sexual self-indulgence and adultery (see p 1 58). Named in the verses were many members of the town's leading families, men who had held or would go on to hold Bridport's highest civic offices. DORCHESTER The Romans probably chose to build a fort and administrative centre at Durnovaria (Dor chester) because of its proximity to British hill forts at nearby Poundbury and Maiden Castle: the site had been 'pre-eminent in the area' since the Bronze Age. Although there is no clear evidence of continuous occupation, the wealth of Roman remains at Dorchester and the pros perity of the town during the medieval period suggest that the city on the Frome River maintained its importance. In the time of Edward the Confessor the town boasted over 170 houses, of which perhaps 100 were destroyed by 1086. Bettey estimates the population of the town as about 700 at the time of the Conquest.'\"1 Its location, economic role, and continuing political role in the neighbourhood all contrib uted to Dorchester's growth in the Middle Ages. The town was on one of two major sixteenth- century routes between Exeter and Salisbury or London, although the main road between Bristol and Weymouth bypassed the town. Growing agricultural prosperity in the region seems to have contributed to Dorchester's revival and growth as a market town. By the thirteenth century Dorchester had borough status and routinely sent members to parliament after 1295.4\"1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND K J. Penn sees a sizeable local Jewish community as evidence of Dorchester's thirteenth-century participation in more than local commerce.4\" In the first half of the fourteenth century the town was granted several market days a week and several days of fairs a year. The town also had the right to maintain a prison. It was 'the main commercial and political centre for south Dorset during the medieval period,'47 important both as a centre of exchange for the wool from the surrounding sheep farming areas and as a textile manufacturing town. As the king's justice became more influential in the shires, Dorchester also grew in importance as the 'county town' and the town where the king's justices came when they sat the assizes. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Dorchester remained important primarily as a market town, selling a wide range of commodities at her weekly markets in addition to the cattle, sheep, and corn that were the markets' mainstays. The town held fairs on the day after Trinity Sunday, St John's Day (24 June), St James Day (25 July), and received an early Eliza bethan grant for a fair at Candlemas (2 February).4\" Camden found Dorchester 'neither great nor beautifull, being long since despoiled of the walls by the Danes,'\" but perhaps he visited the town when sixteenth-century depression and inflation had had their worst impact on Dorchester's population and economy/\" His opinion was not shared by Gerard a generation later. Although in 1613 a devastating fire had consumed 300 houses and Dorchester suffered more fire damage in 1622, Gerard could comment, nonetheless, that Dorchester 'hath encreased and flourished exceedeinglie, soe that nowe it maye justlie challenge the Superioritie of all this Shire, as well for quick Marketts and neate Buildings, as for the Number of the Inhabitants; manie of which are Men of great Wealth.'\"1 At least some of Dorchester's e^ite were drawn from an influx of substantial immigrants to the town in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries; besides such newcomers to Dorchester, Underdown tells us the dlite included Dorset men who parlayed land investments into wealth, some even moving to the ranks of the gentry. The importance of the town's men of substance may be seen influencing the reshaping of Dorchester's cultural milieu in the seventeenth century, in their contributions to local charities and support for the Free Grammar School founded after the 1613 fire, in their leader ship in the Dorchester Company, and in their successful campaign for a new Dorchester charter, one that was to give Dorchester a unique form of municipal government after 1629.\" By Gerard's time many Dorchester men were Puritans, many of them relative newcomers, and all of them greatly influenced by the preacher John White, rector of Holy Trinity and of St Peter's, 1605-48. White's dominance in the town had met some initial resistance. As early as 1607 well-to-do burgesses of Dorchester were engaged in factional wrangling, perhaps best seen as resulting from schisms among members of a ruling elite. The reciprocal accusations employed the rhetoric of religion: White was reported to preach extreme Puritan doctrine and, in turn, he and his friends accused opponents of sabbath breaking as well as recusancy. A dispute of this type, one which incidentally associated opposition to drama with hypocrisy and foolishness, eventually reached the Star Chamber (see pp 173-98 and 340-5). In this nest of quarrelling the fire of 1613 seemed to provide heavenly support for the Puritan inter pretation of Dorchester's condition as well as for the town faction allied to its godly rector. In his recent study of Dorchester, Underdown shows how events after the fire brought White and his allies to dominance by the 1620s, placing them in a position to engage in a ferocious 18 DORSET and partly successful campaign to suppress frivolity and enforce godliness in Dorchester. Underdown also suggests ways in which there may have been substantial resentment against the Puritan reformers, particularly from among the young and the poor.'3 The 1631 catalogue of the Dorchester library describes a collection which seems to mirror Dorchester's religious interests and the continuing religious controversy in the town. Although there are many Pur itan tracts and several 'answeres' to Catholic treatises, the catalogue also lists tracts defending English Catholics or relating the lives of English Catholic martyrs. M White was also deeply engaged in the organization of companies and the recruitment of investors interested in the promotion of trade and colonization in New England. In 1623 fifty Dorset gentry as well as humbler men and some men from other counties were subscribers to the New England Planters Parliament that was to become the Dorchester Company of Adventurers. White was influential in both the Dorchester Company and its successor, the Massachusetts Bay Company, in which west country investors cooperated with those from East Anglia to send expeditions to New England.\" Such endeavours, initially stimulated by the commercial enterprise of Dorset gentry and Dorchester townspeople, probably also owed much to the desire to provide a haven for those dissatisfied with the increasingly less puritan Anglican church. The era of White's predominance in Dorchester saw the drastic curtailment of freedom of behaviour and thought within the community, but it also encouraged a strongly independent spirit with respect to outsiders, a spirit visible in the town's reaction to an incident in the parliament of 1629. Denzil Holies, one of the Dorchester MPS, held the speaker in his seat while opposition resolutions were read in the Commons; hearing of their representative's subsequent imprisonment, the Dorchester townsmen voted him a silver cup.s\" LYME REGIS Sixteenth-century Lyme Regis was a 'praty market toun set in the rootes of an high rokky hille down to the hard shore' and close to the Devon border.\" A settlement noted for its pro cessing of salt in pre-Conquest England, by the second half of the thirteenth century Lyme had also developed as a port. The town was in competition with Dartmouth for overseas trade by the 1260s; in 1284 Edward [ chartered Lyme as a free borough with a merchant guild and with institutions like those of nearby Melcombe Regis. By the 1280s Lyme seems to have been an active participant in the French wine trade. In the thirteenth century the townsmen 'with much Industrie and Charge\"1\" built the Cobb, a massive breakwater curving into the sea to create Lyme's artificial harbour. Lyme Regis began to send members to parliament in the 1290s and the town was asked to provide ships for the Crown. By the early fourteenth century Lyme Regis was apparently a very prosperous port.v' A series of fourteenth-century misfortunes, including partial destruction of the Cobb by heavy November gales in 1377 and devastating French raids, left the town too impoverished to pay its fee-farm; the patent rolls picture the town in 1401 as so devastated by disease, war, and natural disaster that 'scarcely a twentieth part of it is now inhabited.''1\" Lyme's port continued to develop in the fifteenth century, however, exporting locally-produced cloth and importing 19 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND various goods destined for the Dorset hinterland/\" By the sixteenth century the town's for tunes were again improving; Leland said Lyme 'hath good shippes and usith fisshing and marchauntice,' commenting also on the wine trade with Brittany.\"2 There are many signs of Lyme's continued revival and growth in the sixteenth century, largely connected with her continued development as a port. Public building included extension of the church, repair of the guildhall and almshouse, and maintenance of the Cobb.\"s Elizabeth's reign witnessed Lyme's seamen's involvement in profitable smuggling and in the semi-legal piracy that accompanied late sixteenth-century diplomacy: according to Kenneth R. Andrews, eleven of the twenty-Six Dorset privateers operating between 1 589 and 1 591 were from Lyme Regis, second only to Weymouth-Melcombe Regis among the Dorset privateering ports; in 1 598 four of ten Dorset privateers came from Lyme.M On the basis of evidence from Dorset port books, W.B. Stephens believes Lyme Regis to be the most prosperous Dorset port in the early seventeenth century.\"' His analysis does not take into account the thriving Newfoundland trade of Poole and Weymouth - from which Lyme also profited after 1608'1\" - but it is nonetheless suggestive of Lyme's continued growth and relative prosperity, even during the depression years of the 1620s. A 1618/19 royal assess ment of the ports to fund an expedition against Moorish pirates demanded that Lyme Regis and Weymouth pay four times as much as Poole.''\" Stephens suggests that Lyme had better physical facilities than Poole and Weymouth because of the depth and protected waters of its harbour, which a visitor of 1 635 said was 'so strongly encompass'd, as they feare no wracke . . . although they have incroach'd so farre into Neptunes bosome.'''\" Stephens' figures show Lyme exporting almost as much cloth as Weymouth in 1622 and considerably more than both Poole and Weymouth by the late 1630s, importing almost as much wine as \"Weymouth and much more than Poole before 1640, and rapidly expanding both imports in general and her share of Dorset imports before 1640. During this period Lyme served as an export centre for cloth merchants from Bristol, Bridgwater, Chard, Taunton, Tiverton, and Exeter, as well as exporting cloth produced in the Dorset-Wiltshire-Berkshire area; she also 'was unique in being the only provincial cloth port continuing to deal chiefly with [the French] market on a large scale' during the l630s.\"'J Evidence of the town's growing sense of civic pride may be seen in the construction of a new town hall in 1612, partly financed - as had been earlier repairs to the Cobb - by drawing on funds intended for the poor.7\" Factionalism about religion, social conduct, and economic activity was expressed in acrimo nious and reciprocal attacks in both religious and secular courts in the next several years. All these causes of social discord came together in the Star Chamber libel suit of Robert Salter v. Benjamin Cowper, Richard Harvey, and Edward Rotheram. The conflict had an economic basis since Salter was one of the farmers of the king's customs and Cowper, Harvey, and Rotheram were officers of the borough engaged in the same work. However, their allegedly libellous attack focused on Salter's conduct, which they represented as relentless, adulterous sexual hunting. Given the inclusion of Robert Hassard and John Viney among the confeder ates of this libellous action, this case may well have had a religious aspect as well; Hassard and Viney were deprived of their magistracy by an order of the town council in October 1608 in part because they were supporters and special favourites of John Geare 'an vnbeneficed 20 DORSET Preacher who hath bin a cause of great factions & deuisions amongst vs.'7' The interactions among Lyme's citizens at this time were very complex, far more complex than a simple binary opposition between moderate and radical Protestant factions. John Viney, for instance, who lost his civic office because of his loyalty to Geare, fought the vicar in the borough court for several years in the second decade of the seventeenth century.72 And John Geare, whose activism probably helped put an end to the Cobb ale, did not dominate the corporation; indeed, in 1616 Lyme parishioners reported their vicar for over-zealous Puritanism, but Bettey describes the town as strongly Puritan by the 1630s/1 POOLE Although its entrance tends to silt up and only frequent dredging permits the passage of very large vessels, Poole Harbour is one of the world's largest natural harbours. The medieval town of Poole was situated on a rounded and very visible promontory extending into the protected harbour; Leland said the peninsula 'standith almost as an isle in the hauen.'74 It is in some ways surprising that the first port to develop in the harbour was not at Poole but at the Saxon settlement of Wareham to the north and west. In the thirteenth century Poole, then merely a settlement 'at the edge of the great heath and commons belonging to the parish of Canrord,\"s began to develop as a settlement of fishermen and traders; the town acquired the right to hold markets and fairs by 1239 and in 1248 the community purchased its first charter from William Longespee, lord of Canford Manor. These were the first of many steps in Poole's gradual achievement of commercial success and greater political independence.'1' Medieval Poole continued to thrive as a port serving the Dorset hinterland and as a haven for ships plying the coastal and Channel trades. Asked to supply ships to Edward I, it also sent occasional burgesses to fourteenth-century parliaments. Early fourteenth-century feuds with the Cinque Ports presaged Poole's recognition as their equal in 1364, shortly before William Montacute, earl of Salisbury, sanctioned its mayoral government and jurisdiction over breaches of market assizes. Poole's prosperity as a port made it not only the home base for the pirate, Henry Paye, but also the target of French raids during the fourteenth century. By the fifteenth century Poole had become the richest port on the Dorset coast. The wool staple was moved to Poole from Melcombe Regis in 1433 in letters patent recognizing Poole's larger population and more secure harbour. The town also profited from a lively trade with the Channel Islands. In 1453 Poole's mayor and bailiffs received jurisdiction over weekly Thursday markets and two week-long annual fairs beginning on the feast of the apostles Philip and James (1 May) and the feast of All Souls (2 November); after 1453 the town always sent two members to parliament.\" With the fifteenth-century decline of the wool trade, Poole may also have declined. Leland insists that 'Ther be men alyue yat saw almost al ye town of Pole kyuerid with segge and risshis,' but by the 1540s, he asserts, the town has recently been 'much encreasid with fair building and use of marchaundise. >?* By then the town may also have benefited from the enterprise of several immigrant families from the Channel Islands who were, for example, to provide the HISTORICAL BACKGROUND town with five sixteenth-century mayors named Havilland. Poole's early sixteenth-century record books reveal the town's developing civic pride, reflected in the development of civic ceremony and the quest for civic autonomy by the emerging town elite. A charter from Henry vni exempted the town from admiralty jurisdiction (the records of Poole's court of admiralty date from the 1 550s). Finally, in 1 568, after a great deal of expense and effort, Poole won the Great Charter that made the town a separate county corporate.7\" The 1568 charter added to Poole's autonomy, probably both confirming and stimulating the further development of the town's civic pride and spirit of enterprise. The records reveal the continuous sixteenth-century development of a community with great adaptability and little deference to outsiders. With the Great Charter, Poole acquired legal recognition of the relative freedom from external authority that in some senses it already enjoyed. Earlier sixteenth- century records show Poole's mayor or bailiffs exercising many of the powers confirmed by the charter and assigned to the mayor or to the new sheriff. County status, however, provided an unusually strong basis for preserving town autonomy and for ensuring the role of prominent Poole men in influencing the exercise of royal authority in Poole as well as wielding power of their own.\"\" Although many south coast towns suffered reverses in the second half of the sixteenth century, Poole 'maintained distinct prosperity right up to the 1580s.'*' The town's population (1,200-1,400 in the early Elizabethan period) grew by about 1.5 per cent per year for at least part of the period, growth paralleled by substantial public and private building and by growing overseas trade, which partly compensated for a decline in Poole's share of coastal shipping. Periods of lively building and commercial activity occurred from 1520 to 1545 and in the 1560s and 1570s. Before the 1580s the brewing, shipbuilding, and butchery industries were important to the town but Poole's main business was commerce and, according to Tittler, it proved relatively immune to the competition and dominance of Elizabethan London, perhaps partly because of the diversity of Poole's trade, perhaps partly because of the town's healthy relationship with the Channel Islands.\"2 Only in the 1580s did Poole's commercial vigour decrease; Tittler suggests that by then the decline of Poole's coastal trading partners hindered the resale of its imports. Poole was also troubled by epidemics in the early 1 580s. An atmo sphere of crisis may also have been generated by incompetent government, reflected by the enormous debts contracted by townsmen who had financed 'over-expansion and . . . bad management.'85 But although the slump was to last until the end of Elizabeth's reign, Poole retained commercial viability and was also developing new areas of activity during the late sixteenth century. Poole's interest in the Newfoundland fisheries began in the 1550s and developed steadily in the late sixteenth century. In 1583 the town bailiff, Christopher Farwell, thought the New foundland trade so important and potentially profitable that he left for Newfoundland despite his office and without the town's consent; he was heavily fined, probably as a part of the parry quarrels of Poole's leading political figures of the period. By the early seventeenth century, Poole was regularly sending ships to Newfoundland and re-exporting several hundred pounds' worth of Newfoundland fish to European ports; in 1619 the mayor claimed that the 'New foundland fishery and one other trade together occupied all the port's shipping.'\"4 22 DORSET The mayor's comment, however, may suggest more about the decline of Poole's other commercial activities than about prosperity based on Newfoundland fish: by 1622 Poole was a distant third to Weymouth and Lyme Regis in the export of cloth and the town was similarly placed with respect to the import of wine and other trade by the 1630s.\" Despite the flexibil ity that led her merchants to change their cargoes with changing markets - Poole was, for example, shipping considerable tonnage of Purbeck clay for tobacco pipes to London by the 1630s\"1' - Poole's fortunes ebbed in the seventeenth century. In the 1620s the town suffered from the general depression experienced by cloth exporters after the failure of the Cokayne experiment. One of several ports reporting 'shrinking markets, unfavourable trading conditions, credit tightness and widening poverty' in 1621, Poole pleaded her poverty to avoid taxation in 1622;*\" in 162$ Gerard said Poole was 'much fallen from the pristine Glorie, yea, and soe much, that nowe the Houses beginne to decaye for want of Dwellers.'\"\" In the 1630s the town was again ravaged by plague and seems not to have recovered its prosperity until some time after the Restoration. During Edward vi's reign, Thomas Hancock, one of the more avid Puritan preachers, served as curate to Poole's church of St James. Hancock himself was initially distressed because, he said, Poole's citizens 'lacke the favor and frendship of the godly rewlars and governors to defend them,' and some of his parish walked out while he was preaching. The town remained gener ally Puritan in its religious preferences, however, although in Poole's late sixteenth-century internal political turmoil it is unlikely that any controversial opinion could have gone un challenged. Like Dorchester and Weymouth, Poole supported parliament in the 1640s.\"11 SHAFTESBURY Shaftesbury was one of King Alfred's three Dorset burhs; it was built on the flat-topped spur of a high down in the northern part of the county. Alfred also founded a Benedictine abbey for nuns under the protection of the fortress walls and, perhaps partly because Edward the Martyr's grave was there, the house grew to be England's largest and richest nunnery. A secular settlement sprang up in the shadow of both the protective fortress and the prosperous monastery, probably profiting from the patronage of both at various times, but the town was almost certainly less able to develop as an independent community than the coastal ports or Bland- ford Forum.90 Thus, Shaftesbury's prominence and role in the countryside were very ancient. The town had perhaps 1,000 inhabitants at the time of the Domesday survey and was the largest of Dorset's five Domesday boroughs; its prosperity depended on both the prominence of its abbey and its developing economic role in the neighbourhood.'\" As early as 1252 Shaftesbury's charter gave assurance that the king's justices would regularly visit the borough. Despite con fusing jurisdictions (the town lay within two manors) and some conflict with the abbey, the town remained generally prosperous. By the fourteenth century Shaftesbury had a mayor and constables, although both king and abbess continued to profit from the town market and tolls. Friction between abbey and the town may have had several sources: the abbey's church was large and beautiful and, as at Sherborne, the townspeople had to make do with a much sm HISTORICAL BACKGROUND ....alter church and were generally barred from the abbey precincts. After the abbey's dissolu tion in 1 539, the monastic property was granted to Sir Thomas Arundell; Sir Thomas' heir let the buildings fall into ruins and they came eventually to serve as quarry for building stone. '\" By the sixteenth century, however, Shaftesbury's location along the main London-Exeter road and position as an entrepot between the Blackmoor Vale and the downlands of Wilt shire and Dorset had made the town largely independent of the nunnery. Although it is a steep climb from any direction except the northeast and the town had to be supplied with water from communities down the slopes, Shaftesbury served as the major distributor of much of the grain grown in the countryside. Town markets also sold fish and salt and other goods as well: ironware, candles, gloves, leather, and cloth are among the wares listed by Bettey; Shaftes bury's fairs were held the Saturday before Palm Sunday, 22 November, and for the four days before and four days after Midsummer Day (24 June).\" By the seventeenth century its role as a town with 'one of the most frequented of all the markets in the region\"\" enabled Shaftes bury to support twenty-four licensed inns and alehouses, although the numbers of the poor grew as well.''s An active Puritan faction in the early seventeenth century seems not to have prevailed; Shaftesbury was the home of a disproportionate number of royalist pensioners after the Civil War.1\"' A charter of James I (1604) incorporated the ancient borough; the borough's pride is evident in its public building (a new hall in 1 568 and possibly another in the 1620s, according to Tittler'^) and in the town's faithful adherence to its traditional ceremonial. SHERBORNE Sherborne nestles between the hills that surround the Yeo River valley of northwest Dorset, near enough to the Somerset border so that the town has sometimes had more developed relationships with Somerset than with other Dorset communities. Made the episcopal see of the Saxon diocese in the early eighth century, the town continued to grow both as a service centre for its ecclesiastical core and as a market town, even after the bishop transferred to Salisbury in 1075, for by then a large abbey for Benedictine monks had grown up in Sherborne. In the early twelfth century Salisbury's bishop built a castle outside the town; the castle was designed primarily as a domestic residence and was near an extensive deer park.'\" Taken over by the Crown in the 1 140s, the castle remained a potential local customer for trade and services, and the town could also profit from its position on the main London-Exeter road. The town grew as a market centre, always dominated by the great abbey at its core and its relationship to its manorial landlord, the bishop of Salisbury. The bishop's men also controlled the hundred courts that had jurisdiction over Sherborne and Sherborne's abbot had a voice in the bishop's chapter in Salisbury. The thirteenth-century markets and fairs of the community proved profitable; in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries the town 'for Largenesse, Frequencie of Inhabitants, and quicke Marketts, giveth place to none in these Partes.''w Like Shaftesbury, the community of Sherborne was sometimes restive under the domination of a large and wealthy monastery. Originally the townspeople worshipped in the nave of St Mary's, the abbey church; later the townspeople met in All Hallows', Sherborne, a small chapel of ease built close to the west end of the abbey church in the fourteenth century.\"\"' The 24 DORSET All Hallows' priest was subordinated to the abbot as rector of Sherborne and incumbent of the prebend belonging to the abbot and monastic congregation. Tithes and other parish revenue had been appropriated to the prebend in 1091.\"\" By the fifteenth century there seems to have been a number of long-standing disputes between the parish congregation and the monastic community, notably a suit in the bishop's court in which the monks opposed a new parish baptismal font. The lay congregation claimed their font was needed because the monks had narrowed the processional door connecting All Hallows' ambulatory to the west end of St Mary's. The quarrels remained intense even after an episcopal attempt to reconcile the disputants and in 1436 the townsmen reportedly set fire to the roof of the abbey church with a flaming arrow. Although they were forced to contribute to rebuilding St Mary's, it was at this time that All Hallows' became an independent, parochial church.\"12 A further contemporary sign of the growing autonomy of the rown community may be seen in the fifteenth-century develop ment of the community almshouse. In granting letters patent empowering the masters of the almshouse as a corporation, Henry vi was both recognizing the recent efforts of local philan thropists and providing a structure for community action. A building drive was shortly underway and new almshouses were soon built with funds raised by a house-to-house collection; the institution remained a focus for civic charity and civic spirit throughout the period before the English Civil War.\"\" The Reformation made possible the development of still more autonomous town institutions. After the Dissolution the abbey passed to Sir John Horsey, a privy councillor and former steward of the monastery. He in turn sold St Mary's Church to the vicar and parish of Sherborne at 100 marks for the abbey church; the roof leads and bells brought the total to nearly £250. \"* The parish promptly tore down tiny All Hallows' and parochial life henceforth was centred in the same church that still effectively dominates Sherborne's landscape. Although the parish was annexed — with the rest of Dorset - to the newly-formed diocese of Bristol in 1542, the manor and castle of Sherborne continued to belong to the estates of the bishop of Salisbury, and Sherborne was one of the parishes in the peculiars that continued in the jurisdiction of the diocese of Salisbury. The see of Bristol was also vacant for much of Elizabeth's reign and the parish perhaps gained autonomy because of the unenforceable and conflicting claims of powerful and absent ecclesiastics. Moreover, Sir John Horsey obtained the farm of the prebend of Sherborne, which, before the Dissolution, had supplied revenue to Sherborne's vicar as well as to Sherborne Abbey's abbot and sacrist; Sir John and his heirs enjoyed the revenues from the leased lands of the prebend until the early seventeenth century; thus, after about 1540 the income Sherborne's vicar received was inadequate to attract powerful clergy.1\"'' A single vicar held sway from 1 538 to 1 566; interestingly enough he and the parish apparently cooper ated in adapting to the prevailing religious winds during that period.\"\"' Some later clerics accepted the Sherborne living only on condition that their income be supplemented from other sources and this may sometimes have made them dependent on the continued goodwill of neighbouring lords like the Horseys or on the townspeople themselves; other vicars did not live in Sherborne.1\"7 For a time Sherborne's churchwardens may have been more independent of the incumbent than were those in other parishes. Although after 1632 the Sherborne vicar was a Puritan preacher and the town's autonomy may have dwindled, Underdown can still refer to mid-century Sherborne as the 'least puritan town in the entire west country.'\"' HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Fragmentary evidence shows the existence of a medieval grammar school in Sherborne, closely associated with the abbey, although the schoolmaster seems to have been a layman by the 1530s. Lands of five suppressed Dorset chantries were used by Edward vi to endow a new grammar school in 1 550. Men who became governors of the school might also have held office as masters or brethren of the almshouse corporation or as churchwardens of the parish; all three institutions thus became foci for growing community feeling and civic pride, particularly among Sherborne's multi-occupational elite citizens.11\" Members of the corporations of the almshouse and the school took the reversion of the lease of the bishop of Salisbury's fairs and markets in Sherborne in 1582, in Fowler's opinion a distinct stage in the 'evolution of the town's freedom from manorial control. After that date community records increasingly use the word 'town' to refer to an autonomous entity, according to Joseph Fowler; he suggests that by the end of the century community affairs were beginning to pass from the hands of the lay churchwardens to some body made up of the townspeople. Almshouse, parish, and eventually school were also active in the economic life of a town that was enjoying at least modest growth as a market centre. Each of the three institutions derived revenue from shops and the like, and each might build so as deliberately to take advant age of greater opportunities for commercial rentals. A good example of the phenomenon may be seen in the history of the parish church house, also of interest because its upper storey was used for both church ales and later dramatic productions. A series of false starts was finally concluded in the 1520s by the decision to build a church house with a large upper-storey room and a well-equipped kitchen, enabling it to function as a parish hall, and with several ground- floor shops that could be let to tenants for income that would help to support the main build- ing.1\" But if the parish was growing in independence and civic pride, and the economy of market- minded Sherborne seems generally prosperous during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the town was still less independent than other large Dorset towns, perhaps because of the continued presence in the town of important landlords and its close proximity to the seat of a prominent family. Sherborne Old Castle, still standing until it was destroyed in the Civil War, was joined in the 1590s by Sherborne Castle, built to replace an early Tudor hunting lodge by Sir Walter Ralegh, who had first admired Sherborne on a journey from London to Plymouth, and who found Sherborne a congenial place to live after his amorous adventures lost him favour with Elizabeth. While there he was feted by the town, served as MP for Dorset, and organized a salon society of intellectuals who may have dabbled in magic and certainly aroused suspicions of heterodoxy among their more orthodox neighbours.\"2 Ralegh was based at Sherborne when he sailed for Guiana, Cadiz, the Azores, and Jersey. After Ralegh's attainder and imprisonment, Sherborne Castle passed through several hands; by 1620 the lease had been sold to Sir John Digby, later first earl of Bristol. WEYMOUTH AND MELCOMBE REGIS The shelter of the remarkable limestone formations of Portland Bill and of the peculiar deposit of sea-swept stones that forms the eighteen miles of Chesil Beach make the mouth of the Wey a natural and pleasant harbour. Although there is some evidence of earlier settlement, both 26 DORSET the medieval towns that attempted to use and profit from the harbour date from the thirteenth century. Weymouth was founded before 1244 on a narrow strip of land on the south side of the river where it leads from the placid waters of Radipole Lake to Weymouth Bay itself. Weymouth's church was a dependent chapel of Wyke Regis, a rural village on top of the steep hill rising sharply behind the town. A bailiff and a royal steward headed the sixteenth-century town government. Facing Weymouth from less than a sixty-yard ferry ride across the Wey River, Melcombe Regis was established by 1268 on a peninsula perhaps 3/8 mile wide, between Radipole Lake on the west and Weymouth Bay on the east. Melcombe became a borough in 1280 and Edward in granted the town an eight-day fair on the eve, day, morrow and five days following the feast of St Botolph (17 June). Medieval Weymouth and Melcombe Regis seem to have had similar populations; in each the more well-to-do townsmen made their livings from trade. Both were summoned to send members to parliament from the early fourteenth century. Vulnerable like other Dorset coast towns to the depredations of pirates and of the French during the late fourteenth-century wars, and the site of the first devastating inroads of the Black Death in 1349, Melcombe Regis was decayed enough in the early fifteenth century for the king to transfer the wool staple to Poole. \"3 Both towns grew in the early sixteenth century, both apparently profiting from the rise of overseas trade in the reign of Henry vui. But by the 1 560s the towns were continually embroiled in competition for control of the harbour and its shipping, vying for rights to collect customs, maintain wharves, and so on. Disputes between them were supposedly formally resolved in 1564 but neither that agreement nor the forced union of the two boroughs in 1571 'saving their ancient liberties and privileges,' ended the controversy between them.\"'1 The corporation created by the union was to be governed by a mayor, two bailiffs (whom Weymouth saw as continuations of her pre-union government), six aldermen, and twenty-four capital burgesses, with the aldermen and burgesses forming a council. But until 1 597, when a bridge across the Wey physically united the two towns, the governments and citizens of the boroughs continued to be at odds; lengthy and acrimonious disputes were accompanied by reciprocal arrests and lawsuits. The bridge induced rich Weymouth men to settle in expanding Melcombe Regis and by 1616, when letters patent of James I cleared up remaining ambiguities about the form of the union, the town was more peaceful. The late sixteenth-century records, however, are dominated by internecine fights between the formerly independent towns. They are also dominated by Weymouth-Melcombe Regis' adaptations to the opportunities of Tudor economic growth. Perhaps not so forward in the Newfoundland trade as Poole, by the early decades of the seventeenth century Weymouth would be as active as her Dorset rival in the trade and transshipment of Newfoundland fish to continental ports. Together with Lyme Regis, Weymouth was active in privateering attacks on Spanish shipping, activities that brought considerable wealth to prominent families of both boroughs. There also seems to have been a great deal of piracy in the town, although the distinction between privateering and piracy was not always clear. Judging from the expansion of the town settlement on the Melcombe Regis peninsula in the Elizabethan and early Stuart periods, the town seems to have grown rapidly, dominated, as one might expect, by merchant families. Community experience was also coloured by more than ordinarily bitter local politics and more than ordinarily complex relations (for such a relatively small town) with the national courts and central government. 27 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND In the seventeenth century, although hampered by the low draught of her harbour, Weymouth- Melcombe Regis came to outstrip Poole as a port, particularly in the export of cloth before the slump of the 1620s; by the 1630s Weymouth's cloth exports were clearly declining but the port continued to be an important importer of wine and her general trade continued to exceed Poole's, although lagging behind that of Lyme Regis.\" Since both Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were served by dependent chapels during most of the period (a newly built church in Melcombe Regis was finally made parochial in 1606), in neither town did the parish church serve as a focus fot community activity. Puritan influence may be seen in the early seventeenth-century municipal court's stern attitude to tippling or games on the sabbath or during evening service and Bettey describes the town as 'strongly Puritan' by the 1630s.'\"' WIMBORNE MINSTER Jude James subtitles his 1982 history of Wimborne Minster 'A Country Town,' a title connoting Wimborne's past and present central function as market place for the surrounding country side.\"7 The town is still dominated visually by the imposing minster church and its dual cent- rality in the religious and commercial affairs of a large area was the community's distinctive trait for the whole of its early history. Indeed, when sources mention 'Wimborne Minster' it is often not clear whether what is meant is the town itself or the much larger rural parish, including the several villages within the parish. The site of the town, where the Allen River flows into the Stour, is 'so low you have to cross water from almost every approach,'\"* and much of the surrounding country was heathland and did not encourage such dense settlement as the valleys of western Dorset, for example. A settlement at Wimborne may have preceded the eighth-century founding of a Benedictine nunnery there by Cuthburga, the sister of King Ine of Wessex; the town, however, flourished after the monastery was founded and the church was, by the time of Alfred the Great, a minster at the centre of a huge rural parish with several dependent chapels. In the late tenth century the monastery was probably destroyed by Danish raids; it was converted, perhaps by Edward the Confessor, into a house for a dean and college of secular canons. By the time of the Conquest the town had developed into a 'small and flourishing township with the monastic church at its centre,' a township with close connections to several manors at least partly within the parish, and a town whose inhabitants generally depended, directly or indirectly, on agriculture for their livings.\"9 The college of canons came to include chaplains for the dependent chapels of St Peter in the Wimborne town square, St Catherine at Leigh, and St Stephen at Kingston Lacy, and Wim borne was also a royal free chapel with considerable independence from the diocesan bishop. This freedom was reflected in the status of the parish as a royal peculiar with its own ecclesi astical court. By 1218 the town had a market under the minster's dean and was growing both to the south on minster property and in the present East and West Boroughs, perhaps creations of the lords of Kingston Lacy, who ran markets in competition with the dean's market. Sim ilarly both the manorial courts of Kingston Lacy and those of the dean held jurisdiction over some Wimborne parishioners.12\" The Black Death must have greatly reduced the parish population (estimated by James at 28 DORSET slightly over 1,400 in about 1330; the town itself had a population then of about 325). Demo graphic loss probably occasioned the desertion of the Leaze, that part of the expanded town on land controlled by Wimborne's dean,121 and probably resulted in the beginnings of the gradual conversion of much of the land in the parish to copyhold tenure, a process that began in the early fifteenth century. Both markets and two annual fairs at nearby Pamphill - on the feast of St Luke (18 October) and the feast of St Thomas the Martyr (29 December) - contributed to the parish revenues after 1496; the parish fair of St Cuthburga was on 31 August.122 At least from the early fifteenth century the parish churchwardens had considerable responsibility for maintaining the minster building and managing the properties and functions that provided the church revenues. These included several church houses during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the proceeds of church ales and church 'cakes,' as well as rent from several properties in the parish. For most purposes the town as a secular community and the parish are indistinguishable before the reign of Elizabeth. Leland tells us that the early sixteenth- century town was 'meatly good and reasonably welle inhabitid.'12 Some conflict - notably in 1539 - preceded the dissolution of the college of canons and the minster chantries in 1547. The Wimborne community was particularly upset by the threat to their college-run school, founded by Henry vn's mother, Margaret Beaufort, and determinedly continued by the parish in the years following the Dissolution, despite royal interference and inadequate resources. In 1563 Elizabeth yielded to petitions from the parish and granted Wimborne a charter, establishing a corporation to run both town and grammar school, the latter endowed with many of the former properties of the Wimborne canons.124 The twelve Elizabethan governors of church and school also appointed an official to preside over the ecclesiastical peculiar court. l2' Although Wimborne undoubtedly experienced some social dislocation during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the general impression left by the Wimborne records is that of a sleepy country town, dominated by what continued to be overwhelmingly local concerns. Many of the same individuals served as both churchwardens and governors of the grammar school; they could also, through the peculiar court, supervise much of the life of the town. As late as the 1 590s the parish of Wimborne seems to have had an unusual number of CauHolic recusants; Thomas Norman, the Wimborne minister after 1597, also offended many of the church wardens and sidesmen with his Puritan views and preaching. Town dissension arising from such diversity of religious views is reflected in the records of the peculiar court, quoted extens ively below for their references to local festival and games. Devastation by plague in 1638 seems, however, to have been of more importance to the community than economic change or religious controversy. The spirit of the age was also shown in the endowment of a number of late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century charities.12'' Miscellaneous Parishes Three of the scattered parishes represented in the records were of some importance in the six teenth and seventeenth centuries. Beammster and Bere Regis were commercial centres, Corfe Castle a focus of military and judicial authority. 29 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Today Beaminster is a charming village in a lovely west Dorset vale at the head of the Brit River valley, north of Bridport and west of Sherborne. In the sixteenth century, Leland described it: 'Bemistre is a praty market town 'in Dorsetshire1 and usith much housbandry and lyith in one streat from north to south: and in a nother from west to est.' Leland also stressed the subordination of Beaminster's chapel of ease to Netherbury's parish church, as well as its closeness to Salisbury.127 A local historian estimates that the population grew from less than 500 in the first quarter of the sixteenth century to about 1 ,350 in 1642, growth sup ported by Beaminster's participation in cloth manufacture and hemp growing as well as by its market.12\" Leland comments that the land from Bridport to Netherbury and on to Beaminster 'is in an exceding good and almost the best uain of ground for corne and pasture and wood yat is in al Dorsetshire.'12 From the time of the Conquest when the manor at Beaminster had been part of the endow ments of the episcopal see relocated at Salisbury, Beaminster had ordinarily boasted little self-government. The town market was granted in the thirteenth century and the town may have become a 'minor trading centre' with some craftsmen as citizens by the first half of the fourteenth century. Some sense of community may be seen in the extension of the church in the fifteenth century and the building of a market house in 1626. During Elizabeth's reign quarter sessions were held in Beaminster, probably because it was the most convenient central town in the relatively underpopulated western reaches of Dorset.13\" The village of Bere Regis was the centre of a manor at the intersection of chalk downlands east of Dorchester and of forest country extending east to Poole Harbour. King John frequently visited the manor. By the end of the thirteenth century it was held jointly by the nuns of Tarrant Keynston (southeast of Blandford) and the Turberville family; after the Dissolution the whole was held by the Turbervilles, who lived in a manor house within sight of the parish church.131 The latter dates from at least the twelfth century and Bere was a market town by the end of the thirteenth century. The wealth of the village was almost certainly increased by the annual celebrations at the September fair on Woodbury Hill, a nearby Iron Age hill fort; the fair was important enough for seventeenth-century communities several miles away to date their records by. Fires in 1633 and 1634 consumed much of the town; damage was estimated at about £7000, which small grants from the county and neighbouring towns can have done little to alleviate.132 Corfe Castle originated in a Saxon village and a Norman keep commanding a break in the long chain of chalk downs running across the Isle of Purbeck, a 'natural gate ... in to the most fertile part of the peninsula.'133 Nestled in the shadow of the castle hill, the medieval town profited greatly from its role in the quarrying and shipping of Purbeck marble for which there was something of a national market. Corfe markets and fairs date from the early thirteenth century, although the town was not incorporated until the sixteenth century, a period when the influence of the relatively important holders of the castle tended to dwarf any independent stirrings on the part of the village.1\" Elizabeth made Sir Christopher Hatton constable of the castle and vice admiral of the Isle of Purbeck c 1571, creating an enclave of independent jurisdiction for Hatton. The mayor of Corfe Castle was to hold petty sessions twice annually, and Purbeck was exempted from Dorset jurisdiction. Something of the castle's influence may 30 DORSET be seen in the requirement that a Purbeck father obtain the constable's permission to marry his daughter to a Dorsetman. Hatton ordinarily ruled Corfe itself through his deputy, Francis Hawley. Another prominent castle constable was Sir John Bankes, attorney-general to Charles I, appointed to Corfe in 1635.'\" Local Customs, Music, and Drama Much of the performance activity in Dorset was local in origin. Church ales and drinkings under civic sponsorship, musters and maypoles, Dorset-born fiddlers and fortune-tellers, bon fires and bell-ringing, parish plays and Corpus Christi processions and, of course, all the games people played (legally and illegally) when they were not playing plays'\"' combined to produce a rich, varied cultural scene. Assessing how widespread and long-standing such activities were is difficult because the records often document only those events at which something occurred ro attract the attention of ecclesiastical or civic authorities. Had Benjamin Goodwin not shot 'a piece into the church at Puddleton' during the Whitson ale in 1617, no trace of that sea sonal custom there would survive.\"7 Had the city fathers of Cerne Abbas not turned their maypole into a ladder (see p 169), had some of the citizens of Wimborne Minster not forni cated 'at the setting vpp of a may pole in Spettisbury' (see p 275), had the mayor of Poole not interfered with the use of a maypole with 'a parret vppon the topp therof (see p 245), had a 'good man Paul' not died, 'smitten by the stroke of God,' because of his determination to see the summer pole set up at Symondsbury (see p 276), we would have scant evidence of the survival of this popular custom in Dorset. Similarly some bullbaitings, some drumming, some singing and dancing by individuals, and one performance by a disguised morris dancer were noticed because they occurred at the time of divine service or in the middle of the night. Such evidence, however, is misleading to the extent that it suggests that there was a solid, steadily increasing block of opposition to such forms of celebration. In Dorset there was on going debate about such practices.\"* William Whiteway, writing in 1633 about the reissuing of The kings majesties declaration . . . concerning lawfitl sports, suggested what tensions existed when he noted that ministers were required to publish the book in church but 'diuerse in conscience refused to do, & many after they had read it shewd that it was against the word of God. 'y' In spite of such clerical opposition some civic authorities supported such festivities. As late as 1641, for example, the city fathers of Weymouth (where a maypole had been so important a landmark that, even after it had been taken down, it was used to locate other things and places) spent 3s on a may"
