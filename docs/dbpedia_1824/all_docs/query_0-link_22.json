[1603], Buckhurst was reappointed Lord Treasurer for life.' On May 20, 1603, a commission was issued to the Lord Treasurer (and others) ^ . . to consider upon such preparations for the Coronation as are ''accordable to honour without superfluity of charge.\"* Lord Buckhurst did not have the management of affairs of state quite so much in his own hands under James I as he had had under Elizabeth, as the following letter shows that the King, soon after his accession, appointed his Scottish favourites to share offices with the former ministers. On May 22, 1603, Scaramelli, Venetian Secretary in England, writes to the Doge of Venice : 3 The King has named 5 Scottish Lords as members of the Council. . . . The Treasurer of Scotland [Sir George Hume] has been associated with the Treasurer of England in the management of affairs and consequently in the profits of his office, and now there are two Treasurers, and two Secretaries, to the no small chagrin of the English ministers . . . because every day posts are taken from the English and given to the Scotch. On February 4, 1603/4, commission was issued to the Duke of Lennox, Lord Buckhurst, the Earls of Nottingham, Suffolk and Worcester, and Lord Henry Howard, or any three of them, to exercise the office of Earl Marshal, during the vacancy, and especially to prevent persons of low birth assuming the armorial bearings of the nobility. On March 13, 1603/4, Thomas SackviUe, Baron Buckhurst, was created Earl of Dorset by King James I. A copy of the patent, which is in the Great HaU at Knole, is reproduced facing 1 Pat* I Jac., p. 14* ^ Calendar of State Papers (Dorn.), James, VoL 1 , 90. s Venetian State Papers, James I* [ 221 3 Hktory of the Sackuitte Family p, 220. The Great Seal is attached, but has been a little damaged by the cord, and the face of King James is obliterated, but it is otherwise in good condition. The arms, crest, etc., of Thomas Sackville, ist Earl of Dorset, were: Arm : Quarterly or. and gu, over all a bend vair. Crest: Out of a ducal coronet composed of eight fieurs-de-lys or, an estoile of eight points, ar. Supporters : Two leopards ar, pellettee. Motto : Aut nunquam tentes aut perfice, (Either not attempt, or accomplish.) In 1604 Dorset had to carry out one of the most important commissions of his career, that of arranging a peace with Spain. The commission is dated May 19, 1604,1 and is addressed to Thomas, Earl of Dorset, High Treasurer of England, and the Earls of Nottingham, Devonshire and Northampton, and Robert Cecil, Principal Secretary— to treat for peace and mercantile intercourse with Philip III, King of Spain, and Albert and Isabel, Archduke and Archduchess of Austria. The first meeting was held on May 20, 1604, at Denmark House* (now Somerset House), being the lodging of the Spanish Ambassador. In all eighteen meetings were held, terms were agreed on, and the treaty was signed August 19, 1604. This was a day of great rejoicings. It was on a Sunday, and at 5 o'clock in the afternoon the news that peace had been signed with Spain, was proclaimed \"at the Crosse in West-cheape” by William Segar, King-at-Arms, with ten heralds in their coats of arms, and eight trumpeters. Many valuable presents were given to the English Commissioners after this peace was signed. The Ambassador of the Archduke divided 10,000 crowns amongst them .3 The King of Spain showed his appreciation of Dorset's influence in bringing the negotiations to a satisfactory issue by bestowing on him a pension of £1,000 and presenting him with a gold ring and a richly jewelled chain .4 A representation of the Conference of August 18, 1604, is shown in the painting by Marc Gheeraedts, in the National Portrait Gallery (Plate facing this page). The English in the picture are ranged on one side of the table on the spectator's right, and the foreign to the left facing them.

The commission then goes on to command Dorset to impose an import tax of 6s. 8d. upon every pound of tobacco coming into the country, in addition to the tax of ad. per pound previously paid. This duty to begin on October 36 following. Wytnes our self at Westminster the seaventeenth Daye of October [1604].

On August 23, Dorset arrived at Oxford, late at night in order to make the final preparations. He lodged at New College. On August 27 at 1 p.m., the Chancellor, with the Vice-Chancellor and many doctors rode out to meet the King to a place called Aristotle's Well. The King arrived on horseback, with the Queen and Prince Henry, .... The Chancellor went towards his Maj : 5 or 6 paces, and then kneeled down . . .

After that they presented to his Maj; a Greek Testament in Folio . . . and two Pair of Oxford Gloves, with deep fringe of gold the turncovers being wrought with Pearle. They cost, as I was informed, £6 a pair. They also gave unto the Queen two pair of gloves, much like the former, and a pair unto y® Prince. . . .

After supper, about nine of the clock, they began to act the Tragedy of Ajax Flagellifer ... it was not acted so well by many degrees as I have seen it in Cambridge.

To St. Edmund's Hall foure redd Deers Pies, and foure Angells. . , . It is now necessary to give some short account of Ashdown Forest, as much of the Sackville property was carved out of its original boundaries and for many generations the family has been connected with it. In 1370 Edward III granted iv with all rights, to his son John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and it was afterwards known as ^‘Lancaster Great Park.\" ^ Victoria County History of Sussex,\" Volt II, p* 316* [ 224 ] Thomas Sackville, iff Earl of Dorset It was 18,000 acres in extent and occupied the parishes of Maresfield, Fletching, East Grinstead, Hartfield, Buxted and Withyham. In 1605 the Earl of Dorset was Master of the Game in Ashdown Forest,” and pos- sessed the parks of Buckhurst, Stoneland and Newenham, all carved out of the forest. In 1605 he applied for a commission to cut timber for the repair of the pales of the forest in order to preserve the game in which the King delights,” ^ In 1606, by order of the Privy Council but without the consent of Parliament, Dorset, as Lord Treasurer, had imposed duties on currants imported from the Levant. The merchants interested appealed to the House of Commons, which, in its Petition of Grievances, asked that this impost (as well as the heavy one on tobacco) should be abandoned as illegal, being levied without their assent. The question was tried in the Court of Exchequer in November 1606. By the unanimous decision of the four Barons of the Exchequer who heard the cause, Dorset’s action was upheld. The judgments of two of them, Baron Clarke and Chief Baron Fleming, have come down to us. They affirmed that the levying of custom duties was the King’s prerogative. [Bates’s Case. Quoted by Prothero, ” Statutes, etc., 1558-1635,” pp. 340-342.] Baron Clarke even asserted that one king could not bind his successors by his assent to a statute. The House of Commons accepted the rebuff, without a word. Before the case was tried, Dorset saw the barons, and evidendy sounded them as to the desirability of publishing their decisions without giving the grounds therefor. He wrote to Salisbury [November 1606, Hatfield MSS. 118, f, 144, quoted by S. R. Gardiner]: I sent for my Lord Chief Baron early in the morning, and had conference with him according to the contents of your letter, and afterwards in the Court I had like conference with the rest of the Barons; but they all are confident and , clear of opinion that as their judgments are resolute for the King, so, neverthe- less, in a cause of so great importance as this is, and so divulged in the popular mind as it now stands, and being most likely that the merchants will, not- withstanding the judgment of the Barons, yet pursue their writ of error, they all, I say, are absolute of opinion that before they give judgment it is most fit and convenient that the Barons who are to give judgment shall in like sort argue it, and so to give reasons of their judgment, which being so done and reported, it will be for ever a settled and an assured foundation for the King’s impositions for ever; and thereby also, if they should bring their writ of error, the judgment will stand so much the more firm and strong against them; where not only the judges are to give their judgment, but also do show the ground and reason of their judgment; whereas contrarywise certainly the adversary will give forth that judgment is given without ground, and only to please the King’s Majesty. And for my part I am confident of that mind, and that the suppres- sing of arguments in the Barons, notwithstanding all the judgment in the world, will yet leave the world nothing well satisfied. We have to remember that in Dorset’s day there existed an intimate connexion 1 Calendar of State Papers (Dom.), Janies I, VoL XIII^ 6t VOL. 1—2 C [225] History of the SackviUe Family between the executive and the judicial body. It was by no means unusual for an official to judge an offence against one of his own orders^ and Dorset himself, as Lord Treasurer, was a member of the Court of Exchequer. Succeeding generations have been very far from vindicating his ideas as to the King’s impositions. It was not to be very long before the matter came up in an acute form and the whole question of the King’s absolute powers became involved. On June 5, 1605, Dorset and George, Earl of Dunbar, received a grant of the reversion of the manor of Wye. In 1605 and 1606 we find his signature to many commissions in the State papers, but his health was gradually getting worse. In the Cecil MSS. at Hatfield is the following letter from Dorset to the Earl of Salisbury: 4 September 1605. I go now to Horsley, thence to Knole where I was but only in the first beginning all the year. Thence for 3 or 4 days to Buckhurst, where I was not there 7 years. The following letter in the same valuable collection shows that although suffering much from ill health, Dorset never neglected the affairs of State. He writes to the Earl of Salisbury on May 27, 1607: I hope for no health if the country air and quiet from business do not cure me: to which I am resolved very speedily to bend myself. But first I desire you to move the House to appoint Saturday next for the bill of the Archbishop of Canterbury at 2, Painted Chamber, where if alive I will be. Please take it to heart, for next to the Union and the bill for entails and defective titles, it is most important to the Crown, being £1300 lands now 50 years in the possession of the Crown and some of it dispersed, but still vesting in the Crown, £1100 yearly and more. I desire only the Lords will hear it, being assured that it shall appear to the Lords so just, honourable and reasonable, and good exchange for the see of Canterbury, as they never had a better. You see my Lord of Canterbury puts down the credit of the cause with generalities, which when you see answered, will satisfy himself, but when you hear the particularities it will make it most clear against him. The slip in law is that this resumption was perfected four days within sede plenes whereas it should have been perfected sede vacantes; besides if the Archbishop should prevail in suppressing of this bill, this might give encouragement to others. And forget not that Hatfield is resumed Bishop’s lands. In June, 1607, he was dangerously ill at Horsley House, Surrey, and during this illness, as he mentions in his will. King James sent him by Lord Hay, a ring, with a wish that he might recover and ’Tive as long as the diamonds in that ring did endure.” On Jime 26, 1607, Zorgi Giustinian, the Venetian Ambassador, wrote to the Doge;* There has been such great expenditure since the King’s accession that a ^ Venetian State Papers, James L [ 226 ] Thomas SackviUe, iB Earl of Dorset scarceness has displayed itself in the privy purse, and the King has conceived some resentment against the Treasurer, who, on this plea, refused to disburse one thousand crowns, promised to a certain Scotch baron. The King imagined that the Treasurer had so acted to mark his contempt for the Scots. The temper of the King and of the Treasurer as well, did much harm to the health of the latter We add portions of two letters addressed by Dorset to Sir Julius Ctesar. These are the latest of his letters on affairs of State that we have found and they throw strong light upon the financial distress of James's reign, as well as being fine specimens of his epistolary composition: I have just sined your 3 orders, and do gretely thank you for delivering my most humble thankes to his Ma'*®. As for clamors for monies when ther is no meanes to pay, that is news to you, but not to me. I know not, nor no man erthly knows, any other remedy but to aunswer them that they must tary til it come in. As for any ordinaries coming in, Sir Vincent Skinner can alwaies tell you far better than I, for he was alwaies my inforrmer; and as for extraordinaries, I know of none but this of the tinne. That can go neither forward nor backwards by my presens. I have left full ordre with M' Attumey, and Sir Rich. Smith, to expedite the same; but the delivery of the tinne at London, and in Cornwale, in my opinion will not be done thies 20 daies yet. As to my coming to London, I know not a halfpeny of help that I can give you therby, if I were fit, or able; and I thank humbly his Ma**® he hath geven me credit to seke to recover my helth, w'** I desier to do for his serves; but God doth know that I have yet found a small beginning of recovery, and do leave all to God's mercies knowing, that only time, aier, and free from business, must help this rooted cold and cough of mine, so fast fixed in me. So I rest, ever your most assured friend. Horsley, T. Dorset. 31 May, 1607. He concludes, a few days after, in the following terms a very long letter on the pre-emption of tin by the Crown, an unpopular, but not new project, in which James's ministers were then busily employed, and which is alluded to in the preceding. The letter has no date, but is endorsed by Sir Julius Caesar, ‘‘9 Junii, 1607\": Now, Mr. Chauncellor, touching your lamentacon of the clamors and sutes that are daily made to you for money, and how grevous it is unto you, and therefore desier my help and advise what you shold do, I can say but this; that true fortitude is never daunted, and truth ought never to be either afraid or ashamed. You may truly aunswer them that the king's dets, his subsidies, his rents, his revenues, notwithstanding all the meanes for levieng of them that possibly may be devised, ar not paid, but pecemele come in, with grete difficulty; and how can the king's ma“® pay that w®\" he owes, when that [ ^^7 3 History of the SackviUe Family which is owing to him is unpaied? Besides his ma*‘® hath brought w“’ him an increse of a most comfortable charge j as of a quene, the king’s wief; a prince; and other his most royall progeny, Thes ar comfortable charges, and all good subjects must help willinglie to beare the burden thereof. — That the King of Spaine himself, that hath so many Indian gold and silver mines to help him, doth yet leave his dets many times unpaied, upon accidents that happen. — That the king’s ma*‘% and his counsell, do not neglect to devise all possible meanes and waies to bring in monies and do not dout, within convenient time, though sodenly it cannot be doon, to procure good helpes towards satisfaction of the dettes. — That alredy he hath assined a good part of his subsidy to discharge the same. — That no labours shall be spared to effect the same: in the meane while they must have paciens, and be content. — That as the king’s revenues do come in, so they shall have part and part among them; for one must not have all, and the rest nothing. These, and such like, are true aunswers, and ought, and must satisfie, and these you must not be afraid to geve; and such as will not be satisfied with thes ar men without dutie or reson; therefore no great matter though they be unsatisfyed. Now, Mr, Chauncellor, if 3 weekes be so grevous unto you, what will you think of my greif that in this kind have indured the greif of 3 yeres? But let this be your last and chiefest comfort — ^that we have a most roiall, rare, and most gracious king, for whom we can never speke to much, nor do sufficient, though we expend our lieves, lands, and goods, and all that we have, in this servis. I have told you that I will bend all my indevours to bring in monies, which also must have it’s due time for sodenly you may not expect it: p^fering you therefore that w** now ap“taineth to you, and, by the grace of God, you shall se that I will so laboriously, and I hope so effectually, procede in the other, as you shall have comfort, and I my harty contentation, that I may do some acceptable servis to so gracious a soverein. Yo~r most assured frend, T. Dorset. The final letter from Dorset is one contained in the valuable Lansdowne manu- script* in which he writes to Prince Henry in a very verbose and courtly style, to thank him for his kind attentions during the illness mentioned above. As this is the last of Dorset’s holographs we have found we give it in full: II June, 1607. Horsley, To the Prince his most excelent Highnes: Most excelent Prince, I do protest before the eternaU God and your highnes that among my wordlie comfortes, (wherein I must confes, that it hath pleased his divine ma“® to bles me in far greater measure than I can deserve).

The solemnities of his funeral were performed in Westminster Abbey and the sermon was preached there on May 26 by his private chaplain, the Rev. Georg .;e Abbot, D.D., Dean of Winchester, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. This serjmon was printed in 1608 and we take the following extracts from it: i . . . heere we are to celebrate the funerall solemnitie of an honouirable personage . . . Touching whom ... I shall draw the beginning of that w hich I must deliver, from a witness beyond all exception . . . the late Queen e of everlasting memory. Her Highness was pleased to decipher out of his life, by seven steps; or degrees: The first was his yoonger daies, the time of his scholarship . . . when first he gave tokens of such pregnancie, such studiousnesse and iudgement, that he was held no way inferior to any of his time. The second was his travell, when being in France and Italy, he profited very much in the languages, in matters of story and state. . . . The third which her Majestic did observe was his coming into her court, where on divers occasions he bountifully feasted her Highnesse and her Nobles, and so he did to forren Embassadores. At that time hee entertained Musitians the most curious, which any where hee could have. The fourth was his employment of higher nature, in Embassages beyond the seas. The fifth time was his temper and moderation after his retume from thence, when her Maiestie to give contentation to a great personage in those daies, was pleased to command him unto his owne house, there to remain until her further pleasure was known. Where his Lordship did beare himselfe so dutifully and obsequiously unto her Highnesse command, that in all the time of his restraint for 9 or 10 months space, hee neuer would endure either, openly or secretly, either by day or by night, to see either wife or child. The sixth degree was the time that his Lordship was Counsellor. The last of all, wherein he held the roome of Lord High Treasurer of England, in which place she noted the continuall, and excessive paines, and care which his Lordship did take in her businesse, his fidelitie in his advices, his dexterity in advancing of her profit. 1 State Papers (Dom*)^ James, VoL XXXI, 45* [ 330 ] Thomas Sackville, iB Earl of Dorset Tlius it seemed good to that Queen of blessed memory, in particular to discourse touching her faithfull seruant. W'ho more loveing unto his wife? who more fast unto his friend? who more moderate to his enemy? As his releefe to the poore in pinching times of dearth, as from 28 May to 15 August, 1597 — ^the time of greatest scarcitie that ever we did know, his Lordship sent into Sussex of his free gift, unto six parishes — store of Danske Rie bought at Billingsgate for more than £154 [about £1850 present value]. His body was removed to Withyham, where he lies beneath the Sackville chapel. A monument was erected to his memory bearing the following inscription: Illustrissimus Thomas Sackwle Miles Baro Buckhurst Comes Dorset Sumus Angliae Tresau Rarius Elizabetha et Jacobo Regnantibus a Sacris Consiliis Ordinis Periscelidis Eques Auratus Et Academial Oxoniensis Cancella Rius ob XIX Aprilis Ao.

Lord High Treas® of Engla a Prive Counselor to Que Eliza an afterwards to King James who died ye 18 April 1608. A copy of the will of Thomas Sackville is amongst the muniments at Knole. It is an extremely lengthy document on seventeen large parchment sheets, and a tran- script fills 165 pages of closely-written foolscap. This will was made August ii, 1607, only a few months before his death, and the following are the more important provisions: After a lengthy preamble he says: I give and bequeath unto the Lady Cicily Countesse of Dorset, my most vertuous, faythfull, and dearely beloved wife — ^the sum of £1000, out of my ready money, after my debts are paid, also all my white silver plate in any of my several houses, also one rope of faire rounde orient and great pearles, containing 160. And a jewel of gold made into the fashion of a cross, being set on one side with twelve great diamonds, the one at the top a fair great table diamond, the other side being enameled with divers colours, with three great peare pearles pendant to the same. I also give her all coffers, chests, cushions, boxes &c, with all manner of goods and stuffs in her possession at time of my [ 331 ] History of the SackviUe Family decease, also all stocks of cattle, sheep and swine, all horse and ox teanjjres and implements of industry, also my best Carotch, Coatche my Litter, ai jid my Waggon; with 4 mares and 12 geldings, and the household stuff, in my 1 louses.

Hoping and hartely wishing, that as I have both carefully and chargably, for many years, gotten and gathered together the said guilt and silver vessells — even so that he will as carefully and providently leave them to my nephewe* Richard Sacvill, his eldest son.

Farthermore I give to my sonne Buckhurst all my robes, with all apparrell and garments, also my coronett of gold, and guilt cupp of essay appertayneing to the state and dignity of an Earle and my collar of golde according to the order of St. George, with a George of golde sett all over with diamonds and Rubies, and after the death of my Wife I give him all household stuff, &c. at Dorset Howse and Knole howse, and I also give to him all farms and leases left to my Wife for life, after her death. i At this period the term nephew ** is generally used for grandson. [ 233 ] 'Thomas Sackville, ift Earl of Dorset I also give to my said sonne^ for and during his life only, one ringe of golde enamehed blacke and sett rounde over all the whole Rynge with 20 Diamonds, and also one picture of the late Queene Elizabeth, being cutt out of an Agate with excellent similitude opall fashion and sett in gold with 26 Rubies about the circle of the same, and orient pearl pendant to the same, and one ring of gold (inameled black wherin is sett a greate Table Dyamonde being perfect and pure and of much worth, and one cheyne of golde Spanish worke contayneing in it 48 pieces of gold of divers sorts enameled white, and 46 oval links of golde; enameled, of which 12 of the biggest of the 48, being fashioned like the letter; S have in every one of them 6 Diamonds and other 12 of a secohd lesser sort of the said 48 pieces being oval have in each 2 diamondes, and 4 pieces of a still lessor sort have in each of them 2 dyamondes.

The ring with the greate table diamonde with the chaine of Gold of Spanish worke with 144 Diamonds were given unto me by the King of Spain — I being a Commissioner for the conclusion of peace between King James, the King of Spain and the Archduke. Dorset then specifies a long list of jewels he leaves for life to his wife and after her decease to his son Robert, and then as heirlooms. He also leaves to Robert all his \"Georges and Garters of golde.’’ He bequeaths the following jewels and plate to friends: John, Archbishop of Canterbury, a ring of gold enamelled green with a table emerald. Thomas, Lord Elsmere, Lord Chancellor, pair of gilt flagons with his arms engraved thereon, weight 300 oz.

Also I give and bequeath to my wife my Lordship and Manner of Knoll with all rights and appurtances, and also Knoll Parke and the parke of Whitley adjoining, also Panthurst Parke, and all rents, profits of Courts, etc., in the [ 335 ] History of the SackviUe Family parishes of Seavenoke and Cheevening, all and every of which sayd pisi'cmises I lately bought of Rowland White and John Williams of London, by ■ their Indenture enrolled in the High Court of Chancery and dated 12 April 3 James [1606], and after her decease I bequeath all the same to my son Roberv t and his heirs male, ^ n He further bequeaths to his wife: The messuages and lands of 120 acres in Crowhurst and 60 acres in I -.ing- felde, CO, Surrey, bought by him 2 November, 1606, also messuage and f*arme in Oxted, called Huntes or Suntes, and Rapkins in Crowhurst of 45 a^cres, bought by him ii December, 1606, and also the manner of Foyle in 0:’ xted, with all its messuages and lands, also the Deane lands in Oxted and linnds and tenements in the parishes of Horne and Wolkemsteede or Godstone;*, all of which I bought 21 April, 1607; — for her life only, and after her deceasfe to Robert his son and his heirs male. 51 Also I give unto my nephewe and godsonne Thomas Nevell, son and Iraeir apparant of Sir Harry Nevell, K“*., my sonne-in-law, an annuity of 100 marlffes, and to Cecilie Nevell, his eldest sister, an annuity of £30, and to Eli2ab(,?th Nevell, his second sister, an annuity of £20, and to Mary Nevell, his thi^jrd sister, an annuity of £20. ‘ And whereas I have and doe entertaine divers Musitions, some for the voice and some for the Instrument whom I have founde to be honest in the ir behaviour and skillful in theire profession and who have often given me, after the labors and paynefull travells of the day, much recreation and contentacon with theire delightfull harmony, , . , and he then goes on at length to request his son Buckhurst to employ them, and to pay each one an annuity of £20. We have abstracted this exceedingly long will very briefly, but have set forth all the chief bequests and the names and particulars of all manors and lands as such are always useful for historical purposes, especially for local histories. Sir Richard Sackville, father of Thomas, ist Earl of Dorset, died a very rich man, but from the above will we gather that Dorset added very greatly to his possessions and he must have been one of the wealthiest noblemen of his day. The actual money that he had put aside during his life, in the hands of his wife, and of which, apparently, only a portion is disclosed in his will, must have been a considerable fortune in itself, when we remember that at the date of his death money only represented some one- tenth of its value to-day. His stocks of jewels and plate must have been enormous. The great chains, and the rings which he bequeathed to friends were no doubt set with the largest and most valuable stones, probably many of them from the great treasure ships captured from Spain, which we often found referred to in State papers issued by Lord Buckhurst. [ 236 ] T^homas SackviUe, iff Earl of Dorset Notice should also be drawn to the great increase in his estates^ especially in Kent and Sussex. Even up to the year before his death he was continually adding to his landed possessions, and we find little evidence of his selling anjrthing that he inherited from his father. His wealth and munificence in private life helped to confirm his political position. In 1600 he presented a library of books to the Bodleian Library, and a bust of the founder.^ His main object throughout his life was to stand well with his sovereign, and he was first and always a courtier. He is said to have been a fine speaker, and his letters and State papers show unusual perspicuity. It is difficult to determine which side several of the Sackvilles took in the struggle between the Church of Rome and the Protestant Church. We qiuoted, earlier, a letter dated February 25, 1566, from the Spanish Ambassador to the King of Spain in reference to Sackville's visit to Rome, in this he says: \\ When he left here he was a heretic, but has now reformed.' This— if true — goes to prove that in early life he was brought up as a Protestant, which seems most probable, seeing his father's connexion with the change of doctrine in Engla id under Henry VIII. His visit to Rome seems to have changed his views to the old faith, but ij he did change he must have kept this quiet, from motives of policy. , We have one other piece of evidence relative to Father Blount:® Among Father Blount's converts was Thomas SackviUe, Earl of Dorset. . . . Father Blount admitted him to the Sacraments not long before his death. . . . This, if based upon genuine evidence, is conclusive that he died a member of the Catholic Church. The following epigram occurs in the Aubrey MSS .: 3 Epigram on the Earle of Dorset, who dyed suddenly at the Council Boord. These verses I transcribed out of the collection of my honor** friend and neighbor Tho. Tyndale, Esq. : Uncivil Death! that would'st not once conferre. Dispute, or parte with our Treasurer.

The l:ollowing is an impression of the seal used by Thomas Sackville, after he became earl of Dorset: I i CICELY, 1ST COUNTESS OF DORSET Cicely Baker, daughter of Sir John Baker, Knt., of Sissinghurst, co. Kent, was born in 1535. She married Thomas Sackville at St. Bride's, Fleet Street, London, in 1554, and survived him. Sir John Baker was in succession Recorder of London, Attorney-General, Chancellor of the Exchequer to Henry VIII, Secretary to the Privy Council and Speaker of the House of Commons. He was the only Privy Councillor who refused to sign the will of Edward VI, whereby that monarch's two sisters were to be excluded from the throne. Queen Mary loaded him with honours, and being a Papist, he became a zealous tool in her hands as an enemy of the Reformers. He built a magnificent mansion at Cranbrook, in Kent, of which the chief remains are the gateway. Queen Elizabeth visited him there. Sir John Baker died 1558. One daughter — Cicely — ^married Thomas Sackville, another married Sir Thomas Scott, of Scot's Hall, Kent.* From the oft repeated and strong terms of endearment used in his will we can only conclude that the marriage was a very happy one, and that his wife proved a real true helpmate to the rising statesman. We seldom find her name mentioned in the public records, and then only perhaps 1 “ Dictionary of National Biography/* 2 ” Some Pedigrees from the Visitation of Kent, 1663-68/* annotated by J* J* Howard and R* Hovenden, 1887* ^ [ 239 ] History of the SackviJle Family in a gossiping letter wherein is noted that Lady Buckhurst was playing i iat cards with the Queen, or that she was godmother to one of the children of Robert and Barbara Sidney at Penshurst. We have found at Knole a power of attorney dated January 13, 1612/ -^rs, given by the Countess of Dorset to John Bloome of Sevenoaks, and appointing hinli-i her '‘true and lawful Attorney” to receive rents from her tenants of the farms attac 'hed to the Little Park at Otford. We add a copy of her signature and seal on this deed: Her will is dated March 22, 1612, and the following is an abstract of he chief bequests I am surviving executrix of my said husband's will, and do not wish ;the executors of Robert late Earl of Dorset to meddle with my said husband's will but appoint Richard Earl of Dorset my overseer and also executor of my said husband's will.

The Dowager Countess of Dorset died on October i, 1615, and was buried at Withyham, under a handsome tomb with the following inscription:^ Cicely, Countesse Dowager of Dorset, Daughter of S.

On one is the following inscription:* The body of the Right Honble. Cicely Countess of Dorset Dowager wife to Thomas Earle of Dorset whoe dyed ye first of October Ano. Di 1615 aged 80 yeres. A portrait of Lady Dorset, which we reproduce (facing p. 240), is in the Ballroom at Knole. It is considered to have been painted about 1635, and was probably copied from an older picture. The dimensions are 29 inches x 24 inches. As, by the inscription upon it, she is described as the widow of Thomas Sackville, it represents her at a period between the dates 1608 and 1615. 1 Memoirs of the Sackville Family/' Collin* ^ « Historical Notes of Withyham, etc*/* Rev* C* N* Suttom [ 241 ] VOL.

The only reference to him that we have seen is in Vincent's MS. pedigree in the Heralds’ College. ist son: Robert, Earl of Dorset. [See next chapter.] 2nd son: Henry. At Knole there is the counterpart of a Deed of Settlement, from Thomas, Lord Buckhurst to John Cobham, dated 23 May, 34 Eliz. [1592], of the manors and lands in Cowding, Bexhill and Heathfield, on the marriage of Henry Sackville, his second son, with Alice, daughter and heiress of John Colson. Under the heading of Thomas, the 4th son, we quote a letter from Lord Buckhurst, which refers to his son Henry, who appears to have been mentally affected for many years. This trouble dated back to June i, 1597, and he was in the same state on July 26, 1609.* On June 5, 1635, commission was issued to the Hon. Lady Alice Sackville, relict of Henry Sackville, Esq., late of Lewes, co. Sussex, deceased, to administer the goods, etc. 3rd son: William. In the MSS. of J. R.

Here we have found considerable difficulty owing to the fact that there were four Thomas Sackvilles living at this period. In most pedigrees the fourth son of the Earl of Dorset is said to be the Sir Thomas Sackville who was the founder of the branch of the Sackvilles seated at Bibury Court, Gloucester. We have dealt with this previously under the descendants of Humphrey Sackville and now show that the old pedigrees are erroneous. The following inscription is upon a coffin plate in the Sackville vault at Withy ham Here lyeth Anne ye Daughter of Sr. Robert Johnson of ye Tower of London, Kt., ye only wife of Thomas Sackville, Esq., her only husband, and sonne of Thomas Sackville of ye Noble order of ye Garter, Knight, Baron of Buckhurst, Lord High Treasurer of England, etc. Dyed 15 Februar. A® Dni 1653 of her age 63, etc. We need only add that Sir Thomas Sackville of Bibury, married Barbara, daughter of Sir John Hungerford, Bart. We have found an interesting letter from Lord Buckhurst to Sir Robert Cecil ,3 which we give in full as it contains information about this fourth son, Thomas, and also the second son, Henry: 1602 August 20sU Horsley^ I am newly returned from visiting my sick daughter at Cowdray. . . . And now I must desire you humbly on my behalf to move her Majesty in a suit which I hope she will think reasonable, just and charitable, whereof I beg leave to use some little preface to the matter. There hath been beyond seas for recovery of his health, by her Majesty's license, at Pont Amouson in Germany, one of my sons these three years. Her Majesty will remember him by the token that of all the children I had he was the finest and comeliest boy in nature, with such a rare curled head as her Majesty pleased to take a very special liking of him, but such was his misfortune as in a very great sickness he fell into a lethargy, from which time he hath fallen into a distraction of his senses. As for his cure by practice of physic and otherwise in England and abroad, he hath cost me above £2,000, but now having been these two years in Germany, where I was put in hope some good effect should have followed, I have about a month past received advertisement that after all my cost and so long a time consumed he is rather 1 Cotton MS> Caligula, E.

Wherefore now I am resolved to send him to Padoa, v^here I will commit him to a council of physicians there, being assured that if by the skill and knowledge of physic he be to be cured, that place above all the world doth yield the most rare and excellent physicians to perform it. The time for his travel to Padoa is now betwixt this and Michalmas, and for that my son Thomas Sacvill, who is so much devoted to the wars of Hungary, hearing now of such preparations by the Turk against next summer, doth again desire to put himself into that service, as also for that by reason of a fall which he had from his horse in the camp at his last being there he hath had a long pain, which is now much lessened but not fully cured, and is put to great assurance, that by the baths of Padoa, the same will be recovered, therefore he is willing at my desire to pass to that place of Germany where his brother is, and from thence be his conductor to Padoa, and so to pass to the Emperor's Court, and there to remain this winter, from whence he will from time to time advertise me of such occurrences as there are to be had, and by reason of his good acquaintance with divers of the best sort in that Court, being also well known to the Emperor himself, and by her Majesty’s former gracious letters of recommendation to his Majesty, he doubteth not but to be able to advertise very good occurances from time to time. Since his former license is near expiration, my desire is that you will move her Majesty for her license for him to pass into Germany for these Turkish wars for two years more, and by that time I hope he will be satisfied if not surfeited of his desire, and be able to serve her Majesty, which is my only hope. I beseech you as soon as you conveniently can to move her Majesty for this her license of travel, for he must bring his brother from Pont Amouson to Padoa by Michaelmas, unto which it is lo days’ travel, and unto Pont Amouson from Paris it is eight, and therefore quod fads, fac dto* By another letter in the same collection we see that Thomas was at Padua October 17, 1602, He appears to have spent most of his life abroad, engaged in warfare in Hungary and Turkey. Several times we find him quoted as a recusant, in the State Papers of 1610 and again on January a6, 1615/6. Thos. Sackville, son to the old Lord Treasurer, is restrained to Padua for some years; his practices deserved a sharper censure, but he was spared for his father’s sake. Thomas died in 1646 and we have some reliable dates on the coffin plate in the vault under the Sackville chapel at Withyham, which bears the following inscription: Corpus prenobilus Thome Sackvile Armigeri quartogeniti felii Thome comitis Dosestrias Magni Tresaurarii Angelie etc. Nati 25® die Mail Anno Domini 1571, obiit 28° Augusti 1646, Expectans Resurrectionem fidelium et ^ justorum in et per Jesum Christum Dominum Nostrum.

Surrey, to administer the goods of Thomas Sachevill, late of Wolfenbuttel in parts beyond the seas, deceased, by consent of Henry Julius Sachevill, a stranger, son of deceased and Elizabeth Sachevill, relict of deceased, dwelling abroad. Wolfenbuttel is a German duchy, 7 miles south of Brunswick. It is quite possible that this is Sackville^s illegitimate son, but we have no evidence on this point. ist daughter: Anne. She married Sir Henry Glemham, Knt., of Glemham, Suffolk, the owner of Horsley Manor, who rented it to his father-in-law. Lord Buckhurst. In the MSS. of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, there are several letters from Lord Buckhurst to Sir Robert Cecil in 1599 and 1600 about Glemham getting out of favour with the Queen and staying in Rome. 2nd daughter: Jane. Married Anthony Maria Browne, Viscount Montague of Cowdray, who succeeded to the title October 19, 1592, at the age of 18, on the death of his grandfather. His father had died previously, on June 30 in the same year. Montague married Jane in February, 1591, by whom he had one son, Francis, and six daughters.® 3rd daughter: Mahy. Married Sir Henry Neville, Lord Abergavenny. They had the following children: 3 1. Thomas, married Frances, daughter of Lord Mordaunt. Died 1628. 2. Charles. 3.

He appears to have had no regular London residence as we findi from a letter of his at Wollaton Hall, dated March, 1595/6, that he wrote to Mr, Thomas Willughby (sic) asking to borrow his house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, for the use of himself and his wife. The Willoughbys were then of Bore Place, Sevenoaks Weald, and were neighbours, and, no doubt, friends of the Sackvilles. On July II, 1596, he wrote to Sir Robert Cecil from h,is house of Bolebrook:* If I respected not more the discredit I should receive by being put back from that wherein I have interest than the value of the thing in question, I would not be so indiscreet as to desire your favour in a matter of so small value as is this for the allowance of the lease of my little tenement, parcel of Charterhouse. Being certified that to-morrow is a day appointed by your Honour and Mr. Chancellor for rating of the whole particulars concerning the Charterhouse, as I cannot conveniently wait upon you myself, I have sent this bearer, my servant, with my lease and their lines, to entreat that my state in that tenement may be continued for so many years, as by my lease appears yet unexpired, yielding and paying therefore proportionably. For some reason which we do not find indicated he was admitted a burgess of the town of Southampton, the following being the entry in the town records ; 3 '*The Worshipful Robert Sackvill, esquire, son and heir of the Lord Buckhurst, 5 September, 38 Eliz.” [1596]. Robert, like his father, appears to have had interests in ships trading to various parts. The following is an entry in the Public Records proving this: 4 Feb. 10, 1602. London, Wm. Garway to Mr. Wilson. . . . Pray advise Mr. Secretary of the impeachment to trade and danger to goods by the men-of- war in the Straits. We have a ship now at TripoU, of which the Pasha there has made an arania of 5,000 dollars, for an offence committed by a man-of- war. Mr. Robert SackviUe has a ship in those seas, and he is much offended with this, I told him it long since, and that a ship of mine met her athwart Sicily and [she?] had taken a Frenchman worth 40,000 crowns, but he would not believe it. . . . On March 13, 1603/4, itis father was raised to the dignity of an earl and Robert SackviUe took the courtesy title of Lord Buckhurst, and is so called until he succeeded to the earldom. On February 19, 1604, he was appointed a Deputy-Lieutenant for Sussex and the city of Chichester, 1 Historical MSS. Commission, MSS. of Lord Middleton, igii. ® Ibid., MSS.

We read On I'welfth-Eve, 8 January, iScyj/S, there was great Golden Play at Court. No Gam*ester admitted that brought not £300 at least.

On Ap'til 18, 1608, Robert Sackville succeeded his father and became 2nd Earl of Dorset. On May 11 he writes to the Earls of Salisbury and Suffolk and solicits their furtherance- of certain suits to his Majesty- and encloses: (i) Schedule of requests, that he may succeed his father as Master of the Game in Ashdotvn Forest and the Broile Park, Sussex; in the office of Master of the Swans; an id in the Lieutenancy of Sussex.

Buckliursfs arms was ‘'Leopard rampant, ensigned with the motto of the garter.'* Sackville uses the Ram's head in oval. The portraits we reproduce (facing p. 248) are from two paintings in the Ballroom at Knolei: ’ Robert Sackville English School c. 1608 Dim. Panel 44 in. x 30I in. Margaret Howard, 2nd Countess of Dorset ‘ Painted by Paul van Somer (posthumous c. 1612) The inscription on the frame in modem lettering attributes each of these pictures to L. de Heere, but the style of the work is of a period about thirty years after that artist left 'England and he died in 1584, when Lady Margaret was only 23 and Robert Sackville was also that age. Lady Margaret Howard married Robert Sackville in February 1579/80. Her father wa s Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, K.G., born March 10, 1536, who was atfi-ainted of high treason and beheaded September 30, 1572, when all his honours bejcame forfeit. The duke married three times and Margaret was his only daughter tiy his second wife, Margaret, daughter and heir of Thomas, Lord Audley of Walden, who died January 9, 1563/4. Margaret, Countess of Dorset, died, no doubt in childbirth, August 19, 1591, her youngest child, named Margaret, dying the same day. Robert Southwell, the Jesuit, published in her honour, in 1596, a small quarto, entitled “Triumphs over Death,\" with dedicatory verses to her surviving children. [ 351 ] History of the SackviUe Family On Saturday, May 5, 1604, in the House of Lords > a Bill was introduced entitled “An Act for the Restitution in Blood of William Howard, youngest son of Thomas, late Duke of Norfolk, and of the children of the Lady Margaret Sackville, Daughter of the said Duke.'* This duly passed all stages and became law.

Thomas and Winifred Sackville were probably twins as they were burieo’ in one coffin. Winifred is not entered in any Sackville pedigree we have seen. The in.scription on the coffin plate in the vault at Withyham is: Here lieth the bodies of Thoma and Winifred Sackvil sone and daugkiter to Rober Earl of Dorset who died 1587. Richard and Edward will be dealt with in their respective chapters. Cecily married Sir Henry Compton, who was a son of her father's second wife Anne, who had married Henry, Lord Compton, as her second husband, Sackville being her third and last. Cecily had seven children, three sons and four daughters. One of the daughters, named Margaret, married Colonel Thomas Sackville, from an early branch of the family settled at Seddlescombe. Robert Sackville married his second wife, Anne Spencer, on December 4, 1593, at Eardington, als. Yamton, co, Oxford.® She had been married twice previously, ffirst to William Stanley, Lord Monteagle, and secondly to Henry, Lord Compton. Anne's father was Sir John Spencer, Alderman of the City of London, and on e of the richest merchants of his day. We read in John Pym's Note-book: 3 1611. Sir John Spencer, dead.

We have been favoured* with copies of s.ome unpublished letters in the Cecil MSS, at Hatfield bearing on this subject. I Sir Th^omas Lake writes to the Earl of Salisbury from Newmarket, December 5, 1607: j H is Majesty has been much encumbered all this day besides the ill weather with af storm from Lady Buckhurst who has kept him lodged up in his bed- charab^er to avoid her company having attended him all his dinner time and after 'with much importunity and not departed till even now with purpose to follow? him again to-morrow. King James, although looking so heavy and phlegmatic could be jocular when he liked, as jcan be seen by other letters in the Cecil papers from Sir T. Lake to Salisbury, Decembeb 6 and 7, in which he says: . Lady Buckhurst desired the Queen to be presiding judge in the cause between her and her husband and King James suggests to Salisbury that a div'orce shall be at once decreed between the tempestuous lady and her spouse an.-d that Salisbury shall then marry the lady when the King promises to dance at: his wedding. In the same collection there is a letter to Salisbury from Robert, Lord Buckhurst himself, dated November 4, 1607. He writes concerning the extreme difficulties he has with his wife for her ''tempestuousness in domestical conversation greater than flesh and blood could endure.\" She rejects all attempts at reconciliation with certain foolish rhymes of her own devising. One of them was: The fool hath more wit Than such a putt to commit. Falentido Billy. Another: To this cunning piece of law He that shooteth at a buzzard may catch a daw. Falentido Billy. 1 Per favour of Dr* A* P.

Sussex This college was founded by Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset, and it seems suitable to give a brief account of it, after his history. 7 rhe full extract from his will in reference to this College is as follows Whereas I have long and am still purposed to build and erect an Hospital or College in the said town of East Grinstead . . . and to bestow on the building thereof the sum of one thousand pounds, or such a sum as shall be necessary, and to endow the same with a rent charge of £330 by the year out of my lands, etc., in the county of Sussex, towards the relief of one and thirty unmarried persons, 21 men and 10 women, there to live, to pay, serve, honour, and praise Almighty God; I therefore will and devise that mine executors, if I shall not live to perform the same in my life-time, shall bestow a sufficient sum of money in the purchase of a fit place in the said town . . . and to erect and build a convenient house of brick and stone, with rooms of habitation for the said 31 persons, bestowing thereupon such reasonable sums of money as they shall think fit . . . and that they shall incorporate the same, according ^ Dorset^ 23rd February, 1608/9, James I [ 355 ] History of the SackviUc binmh to the laws ... by the name of Sackville College for tiie poor, and that there shall be one of the said 31, Warden of the said College, and that there shall be two of the honest and better sort of the inhabitants of the said town of East Grinstead, associates to the said Warden, to be elected and chosen, from time to time, by me and my heirs, for the better governincnt of the said . . . College; and that the Warden shall have of the said rent charge £20 per annum, and each of the Associates £3 6s. 8d. per annum, and the other 30 poor people . . . each of them £10 per annum. His executors were Lord William Howard and Sir George Rivers, who under- took the establishment of the College. On February 14, 1620/1, a Bill was introduced in the House of Lords* ior founding this College, the bill being intended to carry out the wishes of the testator, but why twelve years were allowed to elapse we have not been able to discover. Tradition says® that the materials of old Buckhurst were employed in tiie building, and certainly many of the timbers appear to have been used before. The earliest document in the College records is 1629, but the books wcic not kept regularly until 1684. In 1631 the College obtained a Charter of Incorporation from Ciiaries I. In 1648 the poor people in the College had to present a petition to tlic House of Lords,* in the course of which they state that Robert, Earl of Dorset, charged Iiis Lmds with £330 per annum for the use of the College, that on his death the iand.s descended to his son Richard, Earl of Dorset, who sold some of the lands so cliargcd and died before any appointments were made for the payment of the annuity — that a gteat part of such lands had passed to John, Earl of Thanet, who married a daughter of die said Richard, and that the Earl of Thanet had for a long time detained the sums payable to the petitioners, whereby they have been brought to such extremity that they were ready to starve, and were forced to apply to Chancery for leave to sue in forma pa'Uperis, The Earl of Thanet answered that Earl Richard by his will charged on.y the manors of Buckhurst, Muncklow, Hendell and Fiscaredye with the £330 per aianum. He acknowledges that he holds lands late the property of Richard, which he had with Margaret, Richard’s daughter, and co-heir, but he conceives that they arc not liabie in law to the charge. The litigation dragged on for some sixty years and was not concluded before 1700 when the rent charge on the estates was reduced to £216 12s. gd. The number of pensioners was reduced at different times and Arabella Diana, Duchess of Dorset, JBxed it at six brethren and six sisters, but there are now eighteen inmates. The College occupies an elevated position at the east end of the town. The building is a quadrangle measuring intemally 91 feet by 8g feet, and externally 130 feeb by 128 feet. The pensioners have their rooms and £14 each, yearly. The hall was rebuilt in 1848, on the original plan.
