        "text": "John Lilburne (born 1614?, Greenwich, near London, Eng.â€”died Aug. 29, 1657, Eltham, Kent) was an English revolutionary, leader of the Levelers, a radical democratic party prominent during the English Civil Wars.\n\nComing from a family of gentry, Lilburne was apprenticed from about 1630 to 1636 to a London cloth merchant. Meanwhile, he joined the Puritan opposition to the Anglican High Church policies of King Charles I, and by 1638 he had adopted Separatist principles hostile to the notion of a state church. He helped to smuggle into England Puritan pamphlets that had been printed in the Netherlands. These illegal activities led to his arrest and trial before the Star Chamber in 1638; he was fined, publicly whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned until liberated by the Long Parliament (on a motion by Oliver Cromwell) in November 1640.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the first Civil War between Charles and Parliament in 1642, Lilburne was commissioned a captain in the Parliamentarian army. He was taken prisoner at Brentford in November 1642 but was exchanged after narrowly missing being tried for treason. In April 1645 Lilburne, by then a lieutenant colonel, chose to resign from the army rather than subscribe to the Solemn League and Covenant with Scotland, which committed Parliament to reform the Church of England along Presbyterian lines."
