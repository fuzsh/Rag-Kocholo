        "text": "â€‹\n\nJohn of Eltham,\n\nPRINCE,\n\nSecond son of King Edward II. and Isabel his Queen, was born at Eltham in 1315. He was afterwards created Earl of Cornwall. Fuller calls him \"a sprightly gentleman, and who would have given greater evidence of his abilities, if not prevented by death in the prime of his age.\" He died in Scotland in 1336. \"This John of Eltham,\" again remarks Fuller, \"was the last son of an English king who died a plain Earl, the younger sons of kings from this time forward being created Dukes, except expiring in their infancy.\""
