        "meta_description": "French monarch, known as 'John the Good'.  In 1356 at the Battle of Poitiers, he was captured by the Black Prince and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he lived a pleasant regal lifestyle. A large ransom was agreed and (from Wikipedia): 'On 30 June 1360 John left the Tower of London and proceeded to Eltham Palace where Queen Philippa had prepared a great farewell entertainment. Passing the night at Dartford, he continued towards Dover ... and reached English-held Calais on 8 July.'  He returned to France but left his son Louis in Calais as a replacement hostage to guarantee payment. But Louis escaped and, with the ransom not fully paid, John felt dishonoured. So in January 1364 he returned to Dover where he was met and conducted to Eltham and the Savoy Palace. He was warmly welcomed and was a frequent guest of King Edward III at Westminster. But he fell ill and died at the Savoy Palace in April 1364. His body was returned to France.",
