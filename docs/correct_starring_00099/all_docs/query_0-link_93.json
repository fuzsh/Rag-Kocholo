        "text": "While the “Mean Girls” musical movie is slated for 2024, the real “Mean Girls” sequel has just dropped in time for the 2023 holidays…thanks to a Walmart ad.\n\n“At North Shore, some things never change,” lead actress Lindsay Lohan says in a voiceover as she reprises her iconic role of Cady Heron, almost 20 years since the 2004 film was released.\n\nIn this follow-up, the Burn Book is actually all the Walmart Black Friday deals that are blowing up North Shore High, where Gretchen Weiners’ (Lacey Chabert) teenage daughter is enrolled and where Cady (Lohan) is the guidance counselor. Turns out, the former Plastics all still wear pink on Wednesdays, but this time, it’s for carpool.\n\nGretchen is a typical stage mom, encouraging her teens to do perfect TikTok dances. Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) is putting her reporting skills on display still, and also continues to hang with Cady and Gretchen.\n\n“Karen Smith here with the weather,” Seyfried says while back in character. “There’s a 30 percent chance it’s already Wednesday.”\n\nThe original cast members, sans Rachel McAdams, were photographed on set for the ad, with rumors that the trio will appear in Tina Fey’s musical adaptation; however, Seyfried said earlier this year that it’s “not really up to us, is it?”\n\n“All four of us are 100 percent into it,” Seyfried said of possible cameos. “Maybe the mothers of our characters? That’s what I was thinking, but listen, I have not even seen the script.”\n\n“The Office” alum Jenna Fischer was announced to play Cady’s mother and “Girls5Eva” fan favorite Busy Philipps will be Regina’s mom for the musical film, based on the Broadway show inspired by the original movie.\n\n“I would kill just to do one week, all of us playing our own roles on ‘Mean Girls’ on Broadway,” Seyfried added, citing the musical show. “Because a ‘Mean Girls 2’ is never going to happen, is it?”\n\nEarlier this year on “Mean Girls” Day October 3, the entirety of the 2004 Paramount film was uploaded to TikTok. It was later taken down.\n\nSo, is this quippy, pitch perfect Walmart ad the closest we’ll get to a “Mean Girls 2”? Check out the commercial below."
