        "text": "That’s so fetch. If you’re wondering if this iconic actress will make a cameo in the new movie-based-off-a-musical-based-off-a-movie, here’s if Lindsay Lohan is in Mean Girls….the 2024 musical movie version.\n\nMean Girls is 2004 movie written by comedian Tina Fey and is hailed as a cult classic for its iconic lines and as a high school dramedy. In 2017, Fey adapted the movie into a hit Broadway musical and announced in 2020 that it would be adapted into a movie. (Cue that 30 Rock joke here.) Though, it’s technically a reboot adaptation with young castmembers like Angourie Rice, Renée Rapp, Aull’i Cravahlo, Christopher Briney, Bebe Wood, and Jaquel Spivey. Fey reprises her role as Ms. Norbury and Tim Meadows reprises his role as Principal Duvall.\n\nFey talked about the young cast in the new movie to The New York Times. “We learned so much with the [stage] show that there doesn’t have to be rigidity in the casting of these roles, in terms of what they look like and how they identify. This story works in many interesting permutations. Anyone with charisma is a good Regina. Anyone who looks like they might come apart can be a great Gretchen.”\n\nFey confirmed that the original cast members won’t reprise their roles, but they could always have a small role. Suspicions also rose when Lohan walked the red carpet premiere of Mean Girls with Tina Fey. Here’s if Lindsay Lohan makes the cut in the new Mean Girls.\n\nIs Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls The Musical Movie?\n\nYes! Lindsay Lohan is in Mean Girls and it’s a pretty long cameo, if you ask us. She appears as the adjudicator in the Mathletes scene where Cady brings her team to victory. It’s a pretty meta cameo because it’s the scene where Cady says, “The limit does not exist.” It appears to say the same thing about how many Cadys could appear in a scene together.\n\nAngourie Rice takes over the role of Cady, a teenager who just moved from Africa and tries to fit in through the cruel social hierarchies in high school. Lohan famously played the role in the 2004 version. To Rice, the comparison doesn’t affect her. “I think no matter what, no two people are going to do the same thing the same way. So I think no matter what, it’s going to be different,” Rice told Entertainment Tonight. “Even if you got two actors in a room to say the exact same speech, it’s just going to be different.”\n\n“So I’m not too worried about it being too similar or too different,” she adds. “I think it’s going to be what it is, and I can’t wait for people to see it.”\n\nBeing a fan of the movie really helped her get ready for the role. “I love, love, love Mean Girls the movie,” she gushed. “I grew up on that movie. It’s one of my favorites. I know it all by heart. So to be a part of it was just so, so exciting.”\n\nIf you expected Lindsay to reprise her role, fear not! She just starred in a series of Walmart commercials where she plays Cady, but all grown up. Along with Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert, Daniel Franzese, and Rajiv Surendra all reunited nearly two decades after the release of the original film to promote Walmarts Black Friday savings deals. They’re all grown up and have adult jobs with kids but are still trying to navigate their way through North Shore High School.\n\n“Some things never change. On Wednesdays we wear pink, but now we shop Walmart Black Friday deals,” Lohan says in the ad, while Lacey Chabert (who plays Gretchen Weiners) pulls up in a convertible to greet her high school-aged daughter with Walmart bags. There are several throwbacks in the video like the iconic “Jingle Bell Rock” performance, Amanda Seyfried’s character Karen Smith predicting the weather, Rajiv Surendra’s character Kevin Gnapoor amping his kid up for high school, and a heartfelt reunion of Daniel Franzese as Damien Leigh and Cady Heron.\n\n“It was so nice being back together after all these years. It was great catching up with everyone,” Lohan told People. While Chabert shared the same sentiment, “It was wonderful to spend the day with Amanda and Lindsay and it was so much fun getting to reminisce and be together again,” adds Chabert.\n\nTina Fey is also opening the door for a Mean Girls sequel, bringing back the OG cast. “I have a feeling Paramount would love that,” she told The New York Times. “I have not really thought much about that. To me, part of why the stakes are so high in the story is because everyone’s so young and feelings are huge, love is huge and friendship is huge in a way [that it isn’t with] middle-age moms. I love writing about middle-aged people, but I don’t know.\n\nOur mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
