        "text": "I don't think I ever gave anyone a chance\n\nto have any say in when I change my hair color.\n\nIt's my head and it's my hair.\n\n[Lindsay laughs]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nHi Allure, I'm Lindsay Lohan, and today,\n\nI'll be breaking down some of my most iconic looks.\n\n♪ Yeah ♪\n\n♪ Yeah ♪\n\nFreaky Friday, 2003.\n\nWow, that just reminded me of MTV Diary.\n\n[Lindsay laughs]\n\nOh my God, I just got deja vu.\n\nFreaky Friday was different,\n\nand I remember this was the phase that I was going through\n\nwhen Avril Lavigne was everything.\n\nAnd I went to my hair stylist as Tracey Cunningham.\n\nI was like, I really want the white stripes in my hair.\n\nBut I think it was probably traumatizing\n\nfor Tracey Cunningham to have to do,\n\nstripping out this natural red hair to white bleach blonde.\n\nI think I like remember getting it back\n\nto normal was pretty tough.\n\nIt just didn't feel the same right after.\n\nAnd now I look back on it and I think,\n\nwhat was I doing to my hair first of all, and why?\n\nBut I made it such a point\n\nthat it was great, and it looked great\n\nfor the character 'cause they wanted her more punk.\n\nBut now that I look back on it, I'm like,\n\nshould I have second-guessed that?\n\n[Lindsay laughs]\n\nThe makeup was really important\n\nbecause Anna wanted to go against her mom's wishes\n\nat any point she could.\n\nI actually wanted the eye makeup to be heavier,\n\nbut it didn't read well on camera.\n\nWe needed to tone it down for Disney.\n\nSo we went a little lighter.\n\nShut up!\n\nI remember at the time of Freaky Friday with my wardrobe,\n\nI was so self-conscious.\n\nI wanted to wear low-rise pants\n\nbecause I wanted to be cool.\n\nAt that age, you still wanna play someone\n\nwho's a little bit sexy,\n\nbut I was always nervous about what my stomach looked like,\n\nif it was flat enough.\n\nThat was my big thing on set.\n\nAnd I look back and I'm like, why was I so hard on myself?\n\nIt's okay.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Lindsay gasps]\n\n[trashcan shaking]\n\nMean Girls 2004.\n\nPlaying Katie to mean girl Katie was really interesting\n\nbecause I loved not having to go through\n\na long hair and makeup process on set\n\nbecause I was the youngest one when we were filming,\n\nso I always had to go into schooling\n\nand everybody else got to hang out.\n\nSo the less time I could spend in hair and makeup was great.\n\nSo playing chill Katie was really nice for me.\n\nAnd then of course being with the girls, I was like,\n\noh, I wanna dress like that too.\n\nI want her to be mean girl Katie now.\n\n[Cameraman] I love how you make the transition\n\nthrough your hair and makeup journey.\n\nSo did I.\n\n[both laughing]\n\nDuring the process of the transition for Katie\n\nwas mainly heels and short, skirts and curls.\n\nSo we tried to keep basic Katie\n\nwith always straight hair or tied back.\n\nWe just wanted to show\n\njust a completely different version of it.\n\nIt's so important because it just shows that she's changed\n\nas a person immediately without even having to say anything.\n\nSo I actually got the best of both worlds,\n\nwhich was really fun.\n\nAnd Mark Waters was a fantastic director,\n\nhe was great to work with.\n\nAnd it was the juicy Couture era.\n\nI mean it was just pink, and fun, and cardigans,\n\nand splendid little thermal tops that we wanted lower done.\n\nAnd then it was just, pastels is better.\n\nSo I had a lot of fun doing Mean Girls,\n\nespecially with costuming.\n\nI had a lot of say, and I had a great team around me.\n\nYou always really get a lot of say as an actor,\n\nespecially when you want to dive really deep into it,\n\nand you know better anyone who you're gonna bring\n\nthat person is that you're gonna bring to light.\n\nI luckily got to have a good amount of say.\n\n[Recorder] Come on, you get that shot of Mr. Walker.\n\nHe won't even allow his picture in the yearbook.\n\nYou know what they say, a good reporter\n\nis always on the job.\n\nGet A Clue, 2002.\n\nFor this, I wanted to spend so much time\n\nin hair and makeup because it kept me\n\nout of school, and it was more fun to be in there.\n\nWe had time really to focus on what hair\n\nand makeup was gonna look like with the wardrobes,\n\nand it was a big part of the character\n\nbecause she was a very expressive character.\n\nSo that was important,\n\nso we had a lot of time to focus on that, which was great.\n\nI remember Juliana, she was really great,\n\nbecause she was pulling poochie for me at that age.\n\nShe was pulling vintage Yves Saint Laurent\n\nat that age for the Pygmalion look.\n\nI mean, we got some really good costumes.\n\nAnd then the hair that we did, there are throwbacks\n\nand references that we did to old Hollywood\n\nin some of the hairstyles, and that was really fun to do.\n\nAnd then even the little clips that we did in there,\n\nso early 2000s.\n\nOn this particular scene,\n\nit seems like my hair fell,\n\nbecause I don't think it was supposed to be like that.\n\nWe were excited for costumes, we were excited for hair\n\nand makeup, and in this movie, I remember was one\n\nof the first times on screen I got to learn\n\nabout how to wear a corset and how to tie it,\n\nand that was really fun.\n\nSo this was just a blast to do.\n\nBlonde Lindsay.\n\nI remember.\n\nSo for the 2003 VMAs,\n\nI think I was just finished doing\n\nConfessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.\n\nIt was around the time\n\nof right in between filming Mean Girls,\n\nand I had secretly bleaching my hair myself in Toronto\n\nin my hotel room 'cause I really wanted to be blonde,\n\nand no one would let me.\n\nI think I was just trying to get the blonde going\n\nand I didn't finish it, okay?\n\nSomehow that picture still exists.\n\nI remember I actually had long hair at the Dior 2005,\n\nat the Cinema Society, and I tied my hair in a bun\n\nand we just clipped short hair over it\n\nand we'd made the bangs.\n\nSo it wasn't even real,\n\nwhich was,\n\nthe first time I'd ever really done anything like that.\n\nAnd it was really fun, and I loved it.\n\nAnd I think my mom had seen me like the next day\n\nor something, she's like, Did you cut your hair?\n\nI was like, no.\n\nI don't know if I'd do that again.\n\nI don't know how bangs look on me.\n\nI have a pretty round face,\n\nand I don't know if it does me justice.\n\nI'm the kind of person where especially\n\nwhen I was playing different roles,\n\nthen I didn't wanna have\n\nthe same hair for every role\n\n'cause then I felt like people would just keep seeing me\n\nas the same character.\n\nSo I felt like I needed a visual change,\n\nand it helped me kind of make a difference\n\nin the characters that what I was playing.\n\nHostage Premiere, NYC 2006.\n\n[Cameraman] Do you remember what kind\n\nof product or things you were using?\n\nI do remember that I love contour\n\nand I still do, and I'm not ashamed of an '80s contour.\n\nAnd it started to begin there.\n\nWhen I was younger\n\nand when I was in school,\n\npeople would make fun of my freckles.\n\nSo I always wanted to find out\n\nhow I could use foundation and how I could cover them up,\n\nand what makeup was good for that.\n\nAnd my mom and my family would always say like,\n\n'Your freckles are beautiful, they're angel kisses,\n\nbut you don't believe that when you're a kid.\n\nYou're like, no.\n\nAnd then over time you learn to love and embrace them,\n\nand yeah, it's just a process of life.\n\nIt's just growth.\n\nAnd at around this time, I was like,\n\njust, they're not gonna go anywhere.\n\nSo I just learn to love them.\n\nDefinitely the hardest color was when I went really dark.\n\nI think it because I was going from being darker I think,\n\nand I was trying to get back to my natural lighter red.\n\nSo this was the transition.\n\nBut I liked this color.\n\nI would get from everyone that I worked with like, Oh,\n\nso glad you're going back to red.\n\nSo glad.\n\nFinally, you're red again.\n\nI feel like it takes you learning yourself\n\nto know what suits you best,\n\nand over time,\n\nafter messing with my hair and trying different things,\n\nand I ended up realizing I loved my hair red the most,\n\nso that's why I'm red.\n\nFalling for Christmas movie premiere, 2022.\n\nHaving the ponytail at Falling For Christmas\n\nwas kind of, it was kind of a last-minute thought.\n\nIt was with Daniel Priano who I worked,\n\nwith and Kristofer Buckle did the makeup,\n\nand I feel like we just wanted to, we were like,\n\nLet's just do something different\n\nthat I've never really done before on a carpet.\n\nIt's new, it's refreshing.\n\nI haven't been on a red carpet in so long,\n\nand so we snatched it back and I'll tell you something,\n\nI videoed taking my hair out\n\nafter that, my mom was helping me,\n\nand it was pretty hysterical.\n\nLots of bobby pins, ones that you don't even\n\nrealize are there.\n\nThe amount of clippers I had to get that that tight.\n\nI didn't know, I had forgotten what it was like,\n\nbut it was worth it.\n\nI've always loved the color pink.\n\nIt's always been a big part of my life.\n\nI've always loved pale pinks and, yeah,\n\nI just love a natural pink cheek and a natural pink lip.\n\nI think it's pretty and effortless\n\nand it's keeping it classy and simple and I just love that.\n\nI mean I'm really blessed 'cause I've known Kristofer\n\nfor coming up on 20 years since right around Mean Girls.\n\nI think he has such a beautiful hand,\n\nhe's such a beautiful artist,\n\nthat once you have someone\n\nthat you feel comfortable with and safe with,\n\nand putting your face in their hands, never let them go.\n\nAnd I really trust Kristofer.\n\nI don't even attempt to do my makeup anymore.\n\nIt just doesn't look the same.\n\nEven my husband's like,\n\nYour eyebrows do not look like the way Kristofer does it.\n\nThank you for reminding me,\n\nnow I feel like shit.\n\nI think we're all iconic in our own ways.\n\nWe just have to give ourselves, you know,\n\nthis space to get there.\n\nAnd I think we all have something, you know,\n\ngenuinely iconic in all of us.\n\nI think we all have something beautiful to share\n\nwith each other, and some people,\n\nwe don't take the time to give ourselves credit for it.\n\nSo iconic to me is just appreciating who you are\n\nand not being afraid to share that with everyone else."
