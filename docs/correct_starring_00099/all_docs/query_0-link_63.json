        "text": "Lindsay Lohan did not appreciate a line in the new Mean Girls film that appears to reference a crude comment about the actress that made headlines nearly two decades ago.\n\nA scene in the Paramount movie, which topped the domestic box office over the weekend, includes Megan Thee Stallion portraying herself as she offers support for Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) by saying, “Y2K fire crotch is back.” Back in 2006, a TMZ video made headlines over oil empire heir Brandon Davis’ insulting comments about Lohan, which included him referring to the actress as a “fire crotch.”\n\n“Lindsay was very hurt and disappointed by the reference in the film,” Lohan’s publicist, Leslie Sloane, said in a statement shared with People and other media outlets.\n\nAfter originating the role of Cady in Mark Waters’ Paramount movie Mean Girls that hit theaters in 2004, Lohan — spoiler alert — makes a cameo in the new film that is based on the Broadway musical of the same name. Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. directed the new Mean Girls feature from a script by Tina Fey, who also penned the 2004 film.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Paramount and a representative for Fey for comment.\n\nThe cast of the new Mean Girls movie includes Reneé Rapp, Auliʻi Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey, Avantika, Bebe Wood, Christopher Briney, Jenna Fischer, Busy Philipps and Jon Hamm.\n\nAdditionally, Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles from the 2004 film as a math teacher and the principal of North Shore High School, respectively."
