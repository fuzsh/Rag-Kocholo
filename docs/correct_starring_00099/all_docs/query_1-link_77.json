        "text": "North Shore's hallways are getting crowded! More casting has been revealed for the upcoming Mean Girls movie musical, which as previously announced will star Renée Rapp, reprising her Broadway performance as Plastics queen bee Regina George. And now we know the rest of Rapp's ultra-popular Plastics. Avantika (Senior Year) will take on the ditzy Karen and Bebe Wood (Love, Victor) will be toaster strudel heiress Gretchen, according to a report in Deadline. Christopher Briney (The Summer I Turned Pretty) will star as Regina's boyfriend Aaron Samuels.\n\nMean Girls follows former homeschooler Cady Heron as she moves from Africa to the Chicago suburbs. Suddenly thrust into the challenges of public high school, Cady meets the evil Plastics, North Shore High's most powerful clique. The stage production, directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, opened at Broadway's August Wilson Theatre in 2018 and closed during the pandemic shutdown. A national tour is currently on the road.\n\nAlso joining the Mean Girls film is pop choreographer Kyle Hanagami, noted for his work with such artists as K-pop group BLACKPINK, Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, and Justin Bieber, among others.\n\nThe Mean Girls film will also star Broadway alum Jaquel Spivey (A Strange Loop) as Damien, Auli'i Cravalho (Moana, Little Mermaid Live) as Janis, and Angourie Rice (Spider-Man: Homecoming) as Cady Heron."
