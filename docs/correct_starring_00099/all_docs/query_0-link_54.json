        "text": "As BI previously reported, Megan Thee Stallion, who collaborated with \"Mean Girls\" star Ren√©e Rapp on the track \"Not My Fault,\" also appears in two social-media sequences in the film. According to People, she proclaims during one of those sequences that \"Y2K fire crotch is back.\"\n\nIn 2006, Davis made derogatory comments about Lohan to paparazzi while out in Los Angeles with Paris Hilton, including saying that Lohan had a \"fire crotch.\" Per E! News, Davis later apologized for his comments, saying that he was \"horrified\" by his remarks.\n\nLohan, who played Cady Heron in the original 2004 \"Mean Girls,\" walked the red carpet with the new \"Mean Girls\" cast at the film's premiere in New York City last week. While Lohan doesn't reprise her role as Cady Heron in the new film, she is one of the members from the original cast to appear on-screen.\n\nRelated stories\n\nBut unlike Tina Fey and Tim Meadows, whose appearances were announced prior to the release, Lohan's cameo was a surprise. As BI previously reported, she shows up as the moderator for the Mathletes competition in the film, where Cady (played by Angourie Rice in the new adaptation) secures the win for the North Shore High team.\n\nFey, who wrote both the 2003 and 2024 films, told Entertainment Weekly that when Paramount, the film's distributor, asked if she would be able to get any of the original cast back for the new film, she knew it had to be Lohan.\n\n\"I felt like if I could only get one person as a surprise, the original movie is really Lindsay's movie,\" Fey told EW. \"As great as they all are, she's the heart of that movie.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Fey and Paramount did not immediately respond to BI's requests for comment."
