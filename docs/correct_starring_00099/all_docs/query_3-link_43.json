        "text": "Archivado en: â€¢\n\nWe canâ€™t be more excited about the Mean Girls premiere! The reboot of one of the most iconic films of the 2000s is returning in a highly coveted musical format, set to be enjoyed starting Friday, January 12. Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan in the original film, now portrayed by Angourie Rice) and the ever-epic Regina George (formerly Rachel McAdams, now ReneÃ© Rapp) will once again face off in an exciting new adventure.\n\nAnd at De PelÃ­cula, we didnâ€™t want to miss this party! Our host, Gaby Cam, interviewed some of the movieâ€™s stars, including Angourie Rice (Cady Heron), Jaquel Spivey (Damian Hubbard), and Auliâ€™i Cravalho (Janis Ian), and took the opportunity to ask if they use Mean Girls expressions in their daily lives. Surprise, they do!\n\nLead actress Angourie Rice mentioned that she often uses the expression Â«Iâ€™m sickÂ» along with an ironic cough. This refers to the funny scene between Amanda Seyfried, portraying Karen Smith, and Rachel McAdams as Regina.\n\n@mrsniklaus karen is so iconic #meangirls â™¬ original sound â€“ mrsniklaus\n\nMeanwhile, Cravalho indicated that she frequently uses Â«fetch,Â» the word Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) tries to popularize in real life to express that something is cool. Â«Am I trying something fetch? Am I trying too hard? Is this fetch?Â» the actress jokingly says. Â«Fetch always pops up here without trying. Fetch is always there,Â» adds her co-star, Jaquel Spivey.\n\n@paramountpics her dad (the inventor of toaster strudel) would like a word #MeanGirls #AvailableonDigital on #AppleTV â™¬ Mean Girls Available on Apple TV â€“ Paramount Pictures\n\nÂ«I also say a lot of â€˜she doesnâ€™t even go here.â€™ I say that a lot when Iâ€™m organizing things. Iâ€™m like, â€˜What is this doing here? She doesnâ€™t even go there,'Â» Rice shared with laughter, referring to the scene where a student who doesnâ€™t attend the school recites emotional words when Damian Hubbard says he doesnâ€™t belong to the school.\n\n@paramountplus How often do you quote this? Be honest ðŸ¥¸ #MeanGirls #SheDoesntEvenGoHere #MovieRecommendations â™¬ original sound â€“ Paramount Plus\n\nThe truth is, we love incorporating Mean Girls vocabulary into reality tooâ€”it makes us feel more fetch!"
