Ten years since it was released, we’re still quoting it. To celebrate (or use as an excuse, you choose) here are the ten best quotes from Mean Girls, in ascending order.\n\n10. On Wednesdays we wear pink\n\n9. I’m a MOUSE. DUH.\n\n8. Made out with a hot dog? Oh my god, that was ONE TIME!\n\n7. We should totally just STAB CAESAR!\n\n“Why should Caesar just get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet? Brutus is just as cute as Caesar, right? Brutus is just as smart as Caesar, people totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar, and when did it become okay for one person to be the boss of everybody because that’s not what Rome is about! We should totally just STAB CAESAR!”\n\n6. You can go shave your back now.\n\n5. She doesn’t even go here!\n\n4. Get in loser, we’re going shopping\n\n3. That’s why her hair is so big. It’s full of secrets.\n\n2. Four for you, Glenn Coco! You go Glen Coco!\n\n...and none for Gretchen Wieners.\n\n1. That’s so fetch!\n\n“Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen, it’s not going to happen.”\n\nAny we’ve missed? Let us know in the comments. And do let us know if you’ve ever felt personally victimsed by Regina George."
