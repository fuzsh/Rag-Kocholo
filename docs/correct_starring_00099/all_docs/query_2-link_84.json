        "text": "After the musical’s opening night at Segerstrom Center for the Arts on March 7, we noticed that some of our favorite Mean Girls movie quotes have made it into the musical! Here were some of our favorite moments to look out for during Mean Girls’ run through March 19.\n\n\"I'm not a Regular Mom, I’m a Cool Mom\"\n\nAn iconic Mean Girls scene is when Regina's mom says \"I'm not a regular mom, I'm a cool mom.\" She's wearing a pink velour sweatsuit that looks like it was swiped from Regina's closet—which is part of the joke, of course—as she is desperate to fit in with her daughter's teenage friends.\n\n“She doesn’t even go here!”\n\nWhen all the girls are called into the gymnasium after “World Burn,” there's a girl who starts tearing up at the emergency assembly and she says, “I wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school. I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles and we'd all eat it and be happy...\" Damien proceeds to say, “She doesn’t even go here,” in his iconic blue hoodie and sunglasses.\n\n\"You can't sit with us!\"\n\nAfter Regina wears sweatpants on a Monday, Gretchen tells her, \"That's against the rules and you can't sit with us.\" These were Regina's rules and had been enforced in the past, and now, Regina herself can’t try to circumvent them. Gretchen gets extremely upset as she explains that they have been following Regina's rules for a long time so she can't break them now. Fans of Mean Girls can never forget the rules that the Plastics have about clothing, as this is one of the most memorable parts of the movie. It's definitely satisfying watching Regina's power start to dissolve throughout the show.\n\n\"Oh my god, Danny DeVito, I love your work!\"\n\nDamian is widely considered the most quotable character in Mean Girls. One of the most recognizable scenes in the movie and musical is when Cady meets Damian and Janis for the first time in the girls bathroom and he says this famous line to a girl telling him that he shouldn’t be in there. This leads to Cady’s introduction to this specific high school and also the world of teens in general, as she's been homeschooled, and she's grateful to have some people to sit with. They proceed to tell her all about the different social groups in school in the song “Where to You Belong”, and it's clear that while these two are labeled as the \"art freaks,\" they're actually the cool ones.\n\n\"So fetch\"\n\nAfter the plastics ask Cady to sit with them at lunch, Gretchen notoriously says “It’ll be so fetch!” After Regina asks what that means, Gretchen explains “It’s like slang, from England.” She continues to sing it under her breath throughout the rest of the musical so that she doesn’t anger Regina."
