Talk to me.\n\nRegina runs out of the room. Gretchen follows her.\n\nREGINA: Nobody understands me.\n\nGRETCHEN: I understand you.\n\nCADY (V-O): I had learned to control everyone around me.\n\nShe taps Aaron on the shoulder.\n\nCADY: Hey. I'm having a small get-together at my house tomorrow night.\n\nAARON: Is Regina going?\n\nCADY: No. Do you think I'm an idiot? No, it's just gonna be a few cool people, and you better be one of them, biotch.\n\nAARON: Fine, I'll go.\n\nCADY: Shut up. I love that shirt on you.\n\nREGINA: She think she's gonna have a party and not invite me? Who does she think she is?\n\nSHANE: You're right, hon.\n\nREGINA: I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?"
