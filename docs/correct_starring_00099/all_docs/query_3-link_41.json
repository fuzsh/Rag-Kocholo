        "text": "“What day is it?” “It’s October 3rd.”\n\nIf you’re like me or millions of other cult classic followers out there, you know exactly what that means.\n\nI’m aware that this post might seem off topic from my usual intended content, but for some of us, today is a national holiday and it cannot go unrecognized. That’s right. It’s Mean Girls Day! And it’s Wednesday!\n\nWhat’s Mean Girls you might ask? Mean Girls is a 2004 teen comedy turned cult classic about an awkward girl named Cady (Lindsay Lohan) moving to Illinois from Africa and trying to fit in at her new high school. She makes two really awesome friends in the beginning, Damian (Daniel Franzese) and Janis (Lizzy Caplan). But they’re not exactly the “coolest” people in school even though most us, if we could go back to high school, would pick them to hang out with.\n\nAnyway, Cady ends up catching the eye of the notorious girl gang of the school, dubbed “The Plastics”. The Plastics are a group of “popular” girls that everyone worships around school. It consists of Regina George (Rachel McAdams) as the leader, Gretchen Wieners ( Lacey Chabert) as Regina’s lackey and Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) as the “dumb blonde”. It’s not long before Cady is recruited to group and hence the “Mean Girls” are born.\n\nThe film has a list of all star cast members, mostly coming from the good old days of SNL with the likes of Tina Fey (Ms. Norbury), Amy Poehler (Regina’s mom), Ana Gasteyer (Cady’s mom) and Tim Meadows (Principal Duvall).\n\nI recently read a post arguing that Mean Girls is in fact NOT a cult classic and that it’s a sham of real high school. I’m not going to call anyone out, but if you cannot embrace the absolute hilarity and ridiculousness of this movie, then you should probably opt for something else. Haters gonna hate! But I get it, there’s always at least one hater out there. For the rest of the majority, let’s take a look back 14 years ago to all the great quotes to come out of this film, by character.\n\nWarning: Explicit language ahead.\n\n1.Cady Heron\n\n2.Damian\n\n3.Mrs. George\n\n4.Bethany Byrd\n\n5.Ms. Norbury\n\n6.Karen Smith\n\n7.Janis Ian\n\n8.Gretchen Wieners\n\n9.Regina George\n\nIf you’re a Mean Girls fan, then it’s probably safe to say you and your friends have your own language where you basically just talk to each other in quotes from the movie. You can admit it, we won’t judge because chances are there’s more people that do this than you think, me and my friends included. So put on your pink sweatpants, grab some Kalteen Bars and enjoy your Wednesday!\n\nThis post has been dedicated to the “Mean Girls” in my life:"
