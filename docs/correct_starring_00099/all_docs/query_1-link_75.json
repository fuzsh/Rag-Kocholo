        "text": "There’s a new generation of plastics. ‘Mean Girls,’ the film adaptation of the 2018 Broadway musical inspired by the original 2004 movie, officially debuted in theatres on Jan. 12.\n\nBut, as the movie’s tagline says, “This isn’t your mother’s Mean Girls.” This musical adaptation-- also from the mind of Tina Fey-- comes nearly 20 years after the original film.\n\nThe plot is somewhat the same. Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is a new student at North Shore High where she meets Janis (Auli’i Cravalho), Damian (Jaquel Spivey) and of course, “The Plastics,” the elite trio of North Shore’s “it” girls: Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika Vandanapu), and their queen bee, Regina George (Reneé Rapp).\n\nAfter Cady falls for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney) and gets caught in Regina’s line of fire, she teams up with Janis and Damian to dethrone The Plastics’ devious ruler. Still, there are several differences from the 2004 classic. Besides being a musical remake, two of the characters have different backstories and a few of the jokes have been altered, reports People.\n\nTickets are available at your local theater or through Fandango.\n\nThe Cast:\n\nTina Fey and Tim Meadows as reprise their 2004 their roles as Ms. Norbury and Mr. Duvall, respectively. Here’s the rest of the cast list:\n\nAngourie Rice as Cady Heron\n\nReneé Rapp as Regina George\n\nAvantika Avantika Vandanapu as Karen Shetty\n\nBebe Wood as Gretchen Wieners\n\nAuliʻi Cravalho as Janis ‘Imi’ike\n\nJaquel Spivey as Damian Hubbard\n\nChristopher Briney as Aaron Samuels\n\nJenna Fischer as Ms. Heron\n\nJon Hamm as Coach Carr\n\nAshley Park as Madame Park\n\nBusy Philipps as Mrs. George\n\nMahi Alam as Kevin Ganatra\n\nThe Soundtrack:\n\nThe “Mean Girls” soundtrack features songs that originated from the Broadway musical, as well as original songs including “World Burn,” sung by the cast of the film, and “Not My Fault,” a collaboration with Rapp and Megan Thee Stallion\n\nWhat they’re saying about “Mean Girls”:\n\nHarper’s Bazaar says the film “finds itself in an awkward spot, trapped between the past and present.”\n\nThe Atlantic says “the music reboot can’t cross the generational gap.”\n\nSalon calls the film a musical surprise that makes a charming argument for itself.\n\nThe New York Times says the “shape-shifting classic” retains its ingratiating charms."
