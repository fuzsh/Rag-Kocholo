        "text": "Mean Girls – written by Tina Fey and directed by Mark Waters – is arguably the most culturally pervasive film of the 21st Century. Since it was released in 2004, the film spawned a successful Broadway musical, a direct-to-DVD sequel, and a musical FILM reboot in 2024. The film’s quotes and catchphrases were almost immediately adopted by the American public, and can be heard pretty much everywhere to this day. “On Wednesdays we wear pink.” “I’m not a regular mom, I’m a cool mom.” “Stop trying to make fetch happen.” Twenty years later they remain as potent as ever. So get in losers, because the Great Pop Culture Debate wants to recycle these Plastics as we aim to name the Best Mean Girls Movie Quote.\n\nJoin Host Eric Rezsnyak and panelists Andrea Guerrero, Curtis Creekmore, and Jake Pitochelli as they flip through the Burn Book and name the best Mean Girls quote of all time.\n\nCheck out the listener bracket to follow along at home! Make a copy, fill it out, and see if your picks match up with ours!"
