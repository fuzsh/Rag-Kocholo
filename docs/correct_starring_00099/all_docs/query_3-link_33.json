We should totally just STAB CAESAR!\n\nMake sure you check out her mom’s boob job. They’re hard as rocks.\n\nYou can’t sit with us!\n\nTrang Pak is a grotsky, little byotch.\n\nDawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin.\n\nOh, it’s like slang, from… England.\n\nAnd you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week, so I guess you chose today.\n\nWell, I mean you wouldn’t buy a skirt without asking your friends first if it looks good on you.\n\nAnd did you know she cheats on Aaron?

I’m failing almost everything!\n\nMy nail beds suck.\n\nMean Girls Quotes: Quotes Said by Cady Heron\n\nCalling somebody else fat won’t make you any skinnier. Calling someone stupid doesn’t make you any smarter. And ruining Regina George’s life definitely didn’t make me any happier. All you can do in life is try to solve the problem in front of you.\n\nAnd that’s how Regina George died. No, I’m totally kidding. But she did get hurt. Some girls say they saw her head go all the way around. But that’s just a rumor. Some people swear they saw me Push her in front of the bus. That was an even worse rumor.\n\nYou know what! It’s not my fault you’re like, in love with me, or something!\n\nI used to think there was just fat and skinny.

She knew it was better to be in the plastics, hating life, than to not be in at all. Because being with the plastics was like being famous… people looked at you all the time and everybody just knew stuff about you.\n\nGrool… I meant to say cool and then I started to say great.\n\nEveryone in Africa knows Swedish.\n\nI have this theory, that if you cut off all her hair she’d look like a British man.\n\nMs. Norbury had us write out apologies to people we’d hurt in our lifes.\n\nDid you just say “thang”?\n\nRandom Quotes from Mean Girls"
