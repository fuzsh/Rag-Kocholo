        "text": "Is today Wednesday? Because on Wednesdays we wear pink. So if today is Wednesday, make sure to wear your speck of pink: pink hair, pink socks, pink shirt, pink shoes, or pink pants. Really, anything works. As for me, I may not have pink hair but I can totally wear my pink shirt and pink corduroys. Is that too much pink? Eh, that should suffice.\n\nIf the movie Mean Girls is a color, it would be pink. Pink to symbolize a mishmash of themes of youthfulness, teen romance, mischievous playfulness, sweetness here and there, and a hint of immaturity. For what is a perfect teen movie without all these ingredients + cute outfits + memorable lines?\n\nSpoilers not included: Mean Girls is your quintessential early 2000s teen film starring Lindsay Lohan. Meet Cady Heron, the new girl in town, who just moved from Africa. She has been homeschooled most of her life, living with her parents and the animals of the vast wilderness. But now that she’s moved back to the United States, she is to go to an actual high school with students and teachers, a world that is very different from what she was used to. She then meets Damien and Janis, who help her navigate the high school maze of cliques. Then, there comes The Plastics, who kind of paints her life all shades of pink, good and bad. Ho. Ho. Ho. And now, the fun… or shall I say the teen drama begins!\n\nWell, there is more to the story. Therefore, the limit does not exist here. So, if you want to put your English skills to the test, reminisce about high school, and learn the importance of apologizing when you’re wrong, then time to stream Mean Girls. This movie is so fetch, you would be obsessed! Cheese fries anyone?\n\n1. Grool\n\nMeaning – great + cool = grool\n\nSentence – That new hairstyle is totally grool.\n\nGiphy\n\n2.
