        "text": "The 2004 Paramount movie Mean Girls, two decades later, has been reimagined into a musical film with the same name. The original Mean Girls starred Lindsay Lohan alongside Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert.\n\nNow that the new movie has been released, however, it appears that Lindsay Lohan has some strong feelings. There’s one joke in particular that apparently offended Lohan based on comments that can be traced back to 2006.\n\nLohan’s original character is now played by Angourie Rice. There’s a scene where Megan Thee Stallion makes a cameo and delivers the following line to Rice’s character:\n\n“Y2K fire crotch is back.”\n\nAs noted via THR, this joke appears to be a callback to an old TMZ video:\n\n“Back in 2006, a TMZ video made headlines over oil empire heir Brandon Davis’ insulting comments about Lohan, which included him referring to the actress as a ‘fire crotch.'”\n\nNow Lohan’s publicist, Leslie Sloane, had the following to share regarding Lohan and her feelings about the line:\n\n“Lindsay was very hurt and disappointed by the reference in the film,” she shared with People and several other media outlets.\n\nInterestingly, Lindsay Lohan is also the only cast member from the original Mean Girls film to make a cameo in the new reboot. It’s been reported that her other co-stars from the original movie, Lacey Chabert, Rachel McAdams, and Amanda Seyfried were all asked to make cameos as well, but none of their schedules could work it out.\n\nThe new film, based on the Broadway musical of the same name also based on the 2004 Mean Girls film, was directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr.. The screenplay was written by Tina Fey who previously wrote the original film as well.\n\nThe cast includes Angourie Rice, Reneé Rapp, Auliʻi Cravalho, and Christopher Briney.\n\nStay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates regarding Mean Girls and Lindsay Lohan’s career as we have them. For now, fans can currently see the new musical movie in theaters."
