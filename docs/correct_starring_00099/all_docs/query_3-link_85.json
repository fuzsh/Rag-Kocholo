        "text": "If it's Wednesday and you're not wearing pink, you'll be eating lunch alone. Sorry but that's just so not fetch according to Regina George. Rumour has it that Jennifer Aniston is in talks to star in Mean Girls spin-off, Mean Moms, to celebrate, see why we love Regina and the rest of the plastics with some of our favourite quotes, like ever...\n\n1. 'Ex-boyfriends are off-limits to friends. That’s just, like, the rules of feminism.'\n\n2. 'That’s why her hair is so big. It’s full of secrets.'\n\n3. 'I'm kind of psychic. I have a fifth sense... it's like I have ESPN or something. My breasts can always tell when it's going to rain.'\n\n4. 'I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet!'\n\n5. 'Gretchen, stop trying to make 'fetch' happen. It's not going to happen.'\n\n6. Janis: 'We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners. We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina’s whole dirty history.' Damian: 'Say crack again.' Janis: 'Crack.'\n\n7. 'Can I get you guys anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me know! Oh, God love ya.'\n\n8. 'I don’t hate you ‘cause your fat. You’re fat ‘cause I hate you!'\n\n9. 'I wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school. I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy.'\n\n10. 'I have a nephew named Anfernee, and I know how mad he gets when I call him Anthony. Almost as mad as I get when I think about the fact that my sister named him Anfernee.'\n\n11. 'On Wednesdays we wear pink.'\n\n12. 'Made out with a hot dog? Oh my God, that was one time!'\n\n13. 'You smell like a baby prostitute.'\n\n14. 'Don't have sex. You will get pregnant and die.'\n\n15. 'Is butter a carb?'"
