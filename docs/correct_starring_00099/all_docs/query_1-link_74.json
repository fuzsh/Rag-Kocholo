        "text": "748\n\nSpeaking with the cast of Mean Girls, a movie that played a dominant role in my upbringing, was an honor. In school, everyone would playfully quote, “You go Glenn Coco!” Or the classic, “I don’t think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased with this.” Expectations were very high with the release of a 2024 iteration of Mean Girls. And the expectations were not just met, but exceeded.\n\nThe 2024 Mean Girls, features some of the top voices of this generation, Reneé Rapp as Regina George. Although this isn’t Reneé’s first time playing the queen bee. Rapp was cast as George in Mean Girls on Broadway at just 19-years-old. Rapp expanded on playing this version of Regina George. According to Rapp, this rendition, “takes some of the pressure off,” because of her familiarity with the character.\n\nAuli’i Cravalho is another well known voice. Cravalho brings Janis ‘Imi’ike (previously known as Janis Ian) to the big screen. Cravalho elaborated on the reasoning for Janis’ last name change. Sharing Tina Fey is who fought for the Hawaiian last name, being that Cravalho is a Hawaiian native. Collaboration was present in this film. It turns out, Cravalho helped Fey to choose ‘Imi’ike which means, “striving for the summit, or striving for the stars.”\n\nWhen speaking with the cast, it was present how much they all admired Tina Fey. The original writer of the ’04 Mean Girls and stars as Ms. Norbury in this rendition as well. Angourie Rice, who portrays Cady Heron, explains that Tina Fey’s writing is what continues to keep Mean Girls relevant over the years.\n\nMean Girls is everywhere in theaters on January 12."
