        "text": "It was a brief cameo requiring just four hours on set – but Lindsay Lohan’s appearance in the Mean Girls remake earned her a pretty “fetch” sum.\n\nThe actress, 37, who shot to stardom as new student Cady Heron in the original 2004 film, pops up quickly in the new musical adaptation during a math competition scene, which premiered last week – and reportedly saw her pocket $500,000, according to Variety.\n\nNot bad, considering her original portrayal as Cady – which took two months to film in 2003 – reportedly earned her only double that, with a $1 million salary.\n\nThe new film, written by original Mean Girls creator Tina Fey, stars Australian actress Angourie Rice in Lohan’s starring role, with Renee Rapp taking over as “it” girl Regina George from Rachel McAdams.\n\nLohan was all smiles as she hit the red carpet at the New York City premiere with the new crop of stars after flying in from her new home in Dubai, but has since revealed she was upset by a joke made at her expense in the film.\n\nThe actress’ rep told The Messenger she was “very hurt and disappointed” by the use of “fire crotch” – an insult infamously used against her by socialite Brandon Davis in the early 2000s.\n\nIn the scene in the 2024 Mean Girls, Megan Thee Stallion – as herself – is seen offering up support for Cady (Rice) who appears as a redhead, like Lohan.\n\n“OK, so somebody sent me this look and I was like, ‘Hot girls, we are going back red, Y2K fire crotch is back,’” the rapper, 28, says.\n\nA source added that Lohan was “surprised and taken aback” when she first heard it during the premiere screening on January 8."
