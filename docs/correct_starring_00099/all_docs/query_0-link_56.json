        "text": "The much-anticipated Mean Girls remake finally hit our screens this week, dishing up a heavy dose of nostalgia in the process.\n\nLike the original, the updated movie musical is brimming with plenty of pink, high school politics and, of course, hilarious one liners.\n\nBut it seems not everyone was laughing, with one of the original cast members disappointed at one joke in particular.\n\nLindsay Lohan, who starred as Cady Heron in the original Mean Girls, and made a cameo appearance in the remake, was reportedly “very hurt and disappointed” by the film’s use of “fire crotch” – an insult that was infamously levelled at her in real life by oil heir Brandon Davis.\n\nThe line occurs in the film when Cady Heron (played by Australian actress Angourie Rice in the 2024 version) dons a red outfit, and Megan Thee Stallion reacts (via social media), saying, “Hot girls, we are going back red, Y2K fire crotch is back.”\n\nFor context, back in 2006, a clip of Davis, now 45, went viral as he exited a nightclub with Paris Hilton, and allegedly referred to Lohan, now 37, a “fire crotch.” Hilton appeared to laugh along at the joke, adding fuel to rumours of a years-long feud between the socialite and Lohan.\n\nDavis later apologised for his words, telling Page Six, “What started out as a joke got completely carried away. I am horrified at the words that came out of my mouth.”\n\nHilton has also since cleared the air with Lohan. In 2022, she told Bravo’s Andy Cohen, “I just feel like we’re grown-ups now. I just got married. She just got engaged. We’re not in high school. I think it was just very immature, and now everything is all good.”\n\nRegardless of the state of her relationships with Davis and Hilton today, Lohan, who flew in from Dubai to attend the premiere, was not impressed with the line.\n\n“The ‘joke’ was hurtful, and Lindsay was disappointed,” Lohan’s publicist said in a statement to The Times."
