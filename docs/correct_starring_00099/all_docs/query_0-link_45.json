        "text": "Nearly 20 years after the original Mean Girls hit theaters — and became a pop culture classic in the time after — the Mean Girls movie musical officially had its premiere on Monday (Jan. 8) at New York City’s AMC Lincoln Square theatre and saw its stars flock to the pink carpet ahead of the screening.\n\nThe original mean girl, Lindsay Lohan, posed for photos on the carpet wearing an outfit that called back to old Hollywood glamour — a floor length black Alexander Vauthier gown with silver, bejeweled cut outs. While none of the other Plastics — Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried — from the original movie were able to make it out to the New York premiere, Lohan posed with Angourie Rice, who now plays Cady Heron in the musical movie, and screenplay writer Tina Fey for photo moments together on the carpet. Everybody’s favorite rapping Mathlete, Kevin G (Rajiv Surendra) was also in the building, and fittingly showed up in his team jacket from the original film.\n\nDuring the premiere, Reneé Rapp — who plays queen bee Regina George in the movie musical — turned up to the pink carpet in a slinky black gown fitted with a powder pink corset over the bodice. Rapp later found Megan Thee Stallion and posed for photos together amid their collaboration on the film’s soundtrack song, “Not My Fault,” the latter wearing an iridescent purple gown serving as a potential nod to George’s infamous purple bra scene in the original movie.\n\nSee more photos from the Mean Girls New York premiere below."
