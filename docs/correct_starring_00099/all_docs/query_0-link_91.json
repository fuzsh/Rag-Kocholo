        "text": "The first movie that I would like to talk about is one of the most well known movies of 2004, Mean Girls, starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams. I chose this movie because it is one of my favorite films. Also, this movie was so interesting to me that it inspired me to become more involved in movies. This movie is the rise of women in the world of comedy. The film is fun to watch thanks to the young and talented cast in it.\n\nRosalind Wiseman, an author, wrote the novel that actress Tina Fey changed into a comedic film. The outcome, “Mean Girls” is a statement about what it is like to be a student going through high school in modern times. In detail, it demonstrates how the ugly side about how school, a place for long-term friendships, fellowship, and just a place for learning is everything but that, according to what one witnesses. In fact, in order to navigate its cliques and groups, one needs a route map in order not to offend anyone. “Mean Girls” was directed by Mark Waters, who really gave the movie a light touch.\n\nThe movie is about Cady Heron, a sixteen year girl from Africa, who moves into the United States of America with her zoologist parents. Because she was homeschooled, she does not know what attending a real school is like, being so excited, but only to be disappointed. First she meets two underdogs in high school, Janis and Damian. Soon, she meets three of the most popular teenage girls in school, Regina, Gretchen, and Karen, also known as the “Plastics”. They immediately invited her into their group. Just when Cady’s friendship with the Plastics becomes great, she admits that she is attracted to Regina’s ex boyfriend, Aaron Samuels. When Regina finds out, she shows Cady how evil she can become, and Cady does the same to Regina after finding out Regina’s plan.\n\nThere are many reasons why this movie is very funny. One reason why Mean Girls is funny is because it turns the truth into comedy. It is easy to relate to the storyline of this movie, which is probably why a lot of people loves watching it. Also, the characters have unforgettable lines that are constantly quoted by the fans of Mean Girls. For example, one of the quotes “She doesn’t even go here!” is one.\n\nOne thing that is for sure is that “Mean Girls” is very different from any other comedy film. This year, there was even a celebration for the tenth anniversary of the film, when fans of the movie rewatched the hilarious high-school chick flick. One reason why the film is different is because the cast members were young females. The eldest cast members were only in their early twenties. t’s easy to look back and examine why “Mean Girls” is better than the countless forgettable teen comedies that come and go each year, but back in 2004, Waters vows that he and Tina Fey had no idea “Mean Girls” was going to be such a huge hit for a following generation of audiences. “We honestly just wanted to make something that was for us and weren’t trying to please anyone else but ourselves,” he said. “But I love that it’s this emblematic movie that speaks to anyone who remembers the sting of high school… and can laugh about it.”\n\nBelieve it or not, but “Mean Girls” is described to be a mythology to some of the fans. There is no question that Cady views this new world as both mystical and possessing of separate natural laws. “Having lunch with the Plastics,” she says in voice over, “was like leaving the actual world and entering ‘Girl World.’ And ‘Girl World’ had a lot of rules.” As with James Joyce’s Ulysses, Mean Girls imposes a mythological structure on the mundane concerns of its hero. The particular myth from which Mean Girls draws its inspiration is not so well telegraphed, though Fey leaves us several clear signposts.\n\nLike the original Ulysses, Cady is recently returned from her own series of adventures in Africa, where her parents worked as research zoologists. It is this prior “region of supernatural wonder” that offers the basis for the mythological reading of the film. While the notion of the African continent as a place of magic is a dated, rather offensive trope, the film firmly establishes this impression among the students at North Shore High School. To them, Africa is a monolithic place about which they know almost nothing. In their first encounter, Karen inquires of Cady: “So, if you’re from Africa, why are you white?” Shortly thereafter, Regina warns Aaron that Cady plans to “do some kind of African voodoo” on a used Kleenex of his to make him like her—in fact, the very boon that Cady will come to bestow under the monomyth mode.\n\nIn conclusion, one of the films that I focused was one of the best movies released in 2004, “Mean Girls”. In this film, a cast of young actresses teamed up to show the world that even young girls can be funny too. The film was composed of satire, humorous performances, jokes, and lines that will be quoted for a long time."
