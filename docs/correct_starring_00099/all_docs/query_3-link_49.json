        "text": "It’s been 15 whole years since Mean Girls debuted in cinemas, and it’s fair to say our lives were made better by this piece of cinematic mastery.\n\nLines from the iconic teen film are still being quoted as gospel a decade and a half on. In fact, you could say “the limit does not exist” when it comes to how far the script in entrenched in our collective vocabulary.\n\nIn honour of its 15th anniversary, here are 15 lessons we learned from Mean Girls.\n\nSo fetch!\n\nThis is what the Mean Girls cast looked like in 2018… OH GOODNESS WE FEEL OLD.\n\nVideo by MMC\n\n1. You can win most arguments with the following comebacks…\n\nObserve:\n\n“She doesn’t even go here!”\n\n“Boo, you whore…” Only applicable in certain context.\n\n“You can’t sit with us.”\n\n“I’m sorry that people are so jealous of me. But I can’t help it that I’m popular.”\n\n“Your mom’s chest hair!” Also only applicable in certain context.\n\n6. October 3 is a date to be celebrated.\n\nFor those out of the loop, October 3 was the day Aaron Samuels asked Cady Heron for the date and it's now officially known as Mean Girls Day.\n\nMark it in your calendar and wear pink to celebrate (even if it's not a Wednesday).\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n7. Four-way conversations never end well.\n\nKaren Smith (Amanda Seyfriend) got herself into a bit of a pickle when she got caught bitching about Gretchen to Gretchen when she thought she was on the phone to Regina.\n\nThis wouldn't have happened in a group WhatsApp chat. You'd hope.\n\n11. A sure-fire way to get out of any plan.\n\nIf you need to get out of going to a dinner with friends or after work drinks with colleagues, repeat after us:\n\n\"I can't go out. I'm sick *cough, cough*.\"\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n12. Don't make out with a hot dog.\n\nEven if it was just 'one time,' people will remember.\n\nIn actual fact, it was originally scripted that Amber D'Alessio had \"masturbated\" with said hot dog, but that was considered too risque for the film's PG13 rating.\n\nThe more you know.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n13. The projection room above the auditorium is not the best place to have sex\n\nWe'll leave it at that.\n\n14. Don't eat foods when you can't read the ingredients.\n\nNot only did we learn that butter is not a carb (although best enjoyed spread thickly on carbs), Mean Girls also reminds us to not eat food with mysterious ingredients and labels in different languages. Especially those that aren't legal under FDA (Food and Drug Association) laws.\n\nCase in point: Regina George starts eating Swedish Kalteen bars after Cady tells her it'll help her lose weight, but they do the exact opposite.\n\nGoogle Translate could've prevented this whole situation but sadly that technology didn't come into existence until 2006.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n15. Fetch will never happen.\n\nControversial opinion but it's been 15 years and 'fetch' still won't happen.\n\nEven though it kind of already has?\n\nWe'll let you be the judge of that one.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nWhat is your favourite Mean Girls quote?
