        "text": "When a film gets in own annual day of celebration across the internet, you know it’s probably a classic. Mean Girls is no exception.\n\nFollowing teenager Cady Heron as she starts at a new school and becomes friends with ‘the Plastics’ – a bitchy but popular clique – the comedy is full of laughs and memorable moments.\n\nStars like Lindsay Lohan who played Cady had many cracking lines, so we have rounded up all the most iconic quotes for a trip down memory lane.\n\n‘Get in loser. We’re going shopping’\n\nHere’s our top ten quotes that will probably still make you laugh out loud:\n\n“But you’re, like, really pretty… So you agree? You think you’re really pretty?”\n\n“Get in loser. We’re going shopping.”\n\n“Ex-boyfriends are off-limits to friends. That’s just, like, the rules of feminism.”\n\n“It’s like I have ESPN or something. My breasts can always tell when it’s going to rain. Well… they can tell when it’s raining.”\n\n“We only carry sizes one, three and five. You could try Sears.”\n\n“That’s why her hair is so big. It’s full of secrets.”\n\nJanis: “We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners. We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina’s whole dirty history.” Damian: “Say crack again.” Janis: “Crack.”\n\n“Raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by Regina George.”\n\n“I’m a mouse, duh.”\n\n“Can I get you guys anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me know! Oh, God love ya.”\n\n“I don’t hate you ‘cause your fat. You’re fat ‘cause I hate you!”\n\nA reason to celebrate\n\nEvery year on October 3 the film is celebrated online with the hashtag #MeanGirlsDay.\n\nThe date marks the day that high school heartthrob Aaron Samuels turned around in class and asked Cady what day it was.\n\nOn social media, fans of the film quote their favourite lines and share memes, gifs and clips from the classic.\n\nIn fact, the cult following have even encouraged each other to wear pink on the day to mark the occasion.\n\nSpeaking on Mean Girls Day last year, Lohan showed that she approved of all the love for her most famed role, tweeting: “Happy Mean Girls Day!”\n\nMean Girls was released in 2004."
