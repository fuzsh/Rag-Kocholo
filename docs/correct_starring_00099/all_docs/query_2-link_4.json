        "text": "Even though Mean Girls may have come out 11 years ago, that doesn’t stop it from being one of the most iconic movies of this generation. From confidence to creativity, this film can teach you quite a few things. In honor of October 3rd — you know, the day Aaron Samuels asked Cady what day it was — here is a look back at the most important lessons we all learned from Mean Girls.\n\n1. Don’t judge a book by its cover.\n\nA common recurring theme in Mean Girls was blind judgment. Whether it was Ms. Norbury, the students, or Cady, people were quick to pass judgement on each other — but it often did no good. Remember, there’s always more than what meets the eye.\n\n2. With confidence, you can rock just about anything.\n\nTake note from Regina George. She may have been the evil queen bee of the school, but confidence was always her shield. Whenever she put on her tank top and found out it had holes on them, Regina didn’t freak out. She strutted out of the locker room and even made a fashion trend.\n\n3. Don’t dumb yourself down for a guy (or anyone else, for that matter).\n\nBeing able to understand calculus or biochem is exciting. Intelligence is amazing and no one should take that away from you — not even if you think it'll earn you more face-time with the hottie in your math class. If you're smart, revel in being smart! You’re pretty awesome just the way you are. And if some boy isn’t into smart girls, then he’s all the dumber for it...and he's not the one for you.\n\n4. “You all have got to stop calling yourselves sluts and whores…”\n\nPretty self-explanatory, but it needed to be said — thanks, Ms. Norbury! Female empowerment starts within the community of women. Hold each other up, because if we tear each other down, it makes it okay for guys to tear us down, too.\n\n5. You are who you hang out with.\n\nHave you heard the proverb, “Show me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you who you are”? It often holds true, and in Mean Girls, it was completely relevant. Although Cady didn’t expect meanness to come so naturally to her, she started to resemble the Plastics after spending a lot of time with them. Be careful the next time you choose your friends...even if it is for a social experiment.\n\n6. When the going gets tough, get creative.\n\nWhen Cady and the Plastics performed at the talent show, they fell into a little bit of a dilemma when their radio broke. After a moment of shock, Cady started singing and got the entire room to sing “Jingle Bell Rock.” It was a difficult situation, but with a bit of creative thinking, the show ended in a spectacular way.\n\n7. Rumors aren’t fun; and the truth always comes out eventually.\n\nAh, the Burn Book. Where would the Plastics be without it? And though Regina tried to blame Cady for the book, she eventually got what was coming to her in the form of a big old school bus. Spreading lies and rumors about other people isn't cool. Imagine how it would feel if someone did that to you? It wouldn't feel so great. Eventually the truth comes out and the backlash won’t be pretty.\n\n8. Trash-talking someone else won’t make you any better.\n\nThough Cady, Janis, and Damien first thought it would be fun to try to ruin the Plastics' lives, they messed up their own lives in the process. Taking out your own problems on someone else won’t change you for the better. If you want to be a better person, put your energy where it counts and make a difference. Putting down other people just for fun doesn’t do much but take all that energy away.\n\n9. “Don’t let the haters stop you from doing your thang.”\n\nAlthough Kevin might have been referring to the entire student body, this can go for just about anything, too. Society has a funny way of peer pressuring you into doing or not doing things you want to do. But just remember, do not let the haters get to you.\n\n10. Apologize when you know you’re wrong.\n\nSure, Gretchen Weiners apologized. But she did so in a way that shifted the blame away from her — and nobody was there to catch her. Cady apologized in full, and people had her back. Admitting you’ve done something wrong is difficult and embarrassing. But it’s the right thing to do. It’s also good to remember it’s never too late to apologize; you’re righting a wrong and that’s always good.\n\nRelated: A Totally Fetch 'Mean Girls' Mobile Game Is On the Way\n\nCheck this out:"
