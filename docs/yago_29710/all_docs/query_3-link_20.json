        "text": "Thailand's king has reinstated his royal consort to the position, nearly a year after she was stripped of her titles in a dramatic fall from grace.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn returned Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi's rank and titles on Wednesday, the Royal Gazette announced.\n\nSineenat was stripped of her rank in October 2019, only months after being named as the king's companion.\n\nThe palace had said that she was being punished for trying to elevate herself to \"the same state as the queen\".\n\nSineenat was the first royal consort for almost a century in Thailand, where the term refers to a partner in addition to the king's wife.\n\nLast year's announcement also accused her of \"misbehaviour and disloyalty against the monarch\". She has not been seen in public since and her whereabouts have not been confirmed.\n\nThe king's latest decision means that \"Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi is not tarnished\", the Royal Gazette announced.\n\n\"Henceforth, it will be as if she had never been stripped of her military ranks or royal decorations.\"\n\nBorn in 1985, she is from northern Thailand and worked as a nurse before entering a relationship with the then-crown prince Vajiralongkorn.\n\nShe eventually became a bodyguard, pilot and parachutist, and joined the royal guards. In early 2019, she was appointed a major-general.\n\nShe received the official title of first Royal Noble Consort in July that year, shortly after the king married his fourth wife Queen Suthida, who had been the deputy head of his personal security detail.\n\nJust a few months later, in October, Sineenat was unexpectedly stripped of her rank and titles, sparking widespread speculation over what might have prompted the sudden downfall.\n\nThe true cause of her removal - and her subsequent reinstatement - as royal consort may never be made public, given the secrecy which cloaks palace affairs in Thailand.\n\nThailand's lese-majeste law forbids any criticism of the monarchy, with hefty prison sentences for offenders.\n\nThe removal of Sineenat in 2019 echoed the cases of two of the king's former wives. In 1996, he denounced his second wife, who fled to the United States, and disowned four sons he had with her.\n\nIn 2014, his third wife Srirasmi Suwadee was similarly stripped of all her titles and banished from the royal court. Her 15-year-old son has been raised by King Vajiralongkorn in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nThe king, who now spends most of his time in Germany, has seven children in total.\n\nQueen Suthida, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, had been seen with him in public for many years, though their relationship had never been officially acknowledged before he married her.\n\nEven after the marriage, his consort Sineenat was a regular guest at royal events until her downfall.\n\nThai kings throughout the centuries took multiple wives - or consorts. But until 2019, the last time a Thai king had taken an official consort was in the 1920s and the title had not been used since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932.\n\nWednesday's palace announcement comes amid anti-government protests in Thailand, where the military has entrenched its political rule after a 2014 coup. The protests include demands to curb recently-expanded powers of the king and there have been unprecedented calls to reform the monarchy.\n\nThe protesters have challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people.\n\nThere have also been questions over King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand."
