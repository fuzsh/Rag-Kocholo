The country has strict laws that forbid citizens and the Thai press from insulting and reporting on embarrassing details about the family.\n\nThat's why a 16-year-old is facing criminal charges and up to 15 years in jail for making fun of the king. The teen was at a protest wearing a tank top similar to the king's with insulting words displayed on his body, Insider previously reported.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThailand's \"lese-majeste\" law prohibits insulting, defaming, or threatening the monarchy. Protestors who want democracy have been demonstrating in Thailand in recent months, leading to many \"lese-majeste\" charges.\n\nThe monarch in question, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, officially known as King Rama X, was crowned in May 2019, almost three years after the death of the previous king, his father Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThanks to restrictions to the Thai press, relatively little is known about Maha Vajiralongkorn.\n\nWhat we do know, however, is that he was educated in Britain and Australia, is an enthusiastic cyclist and pilot, and has been married four times.\n\nIn October 2019, the palace announced that his royal consort — and long-term girlfriend — had been plotting against the queen, and the king stripped her of all royal and military titles for disloyalty.\n\nAbout a year later, the king changed his mind, taking her back as a royal consort and restoring her military ranks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScroll down to find out more about Thailand's secretive, bicycle-loving king.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand is reportedly staying in the four-star Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in the Bavarian Alps with an entourage of 20 women during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMost German hotels have closed to tourists as part of the country-wide lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, per The Local.\n\nGerman publication Bild reported that the hotel received \"special permission\" from local authorities to remain open for the king and his entourage, according to The Times of London.\n\nDespite his important role in Thailand, Maha Vajiralongkorn doesn't seem to spend a lot of time in the country.\n\nHe appears to spend most of his time in Germany instead and is believed to have a home on Lake Starnberg, 25 miles from the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl, per Bild and The Times of London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun was born in 1952 as the second child and only son of then-King Bhumibol and his wife, Queen Sirikit.\n\nThough he wasn't immediately named Crown Prince, he was widely expected to be his father's successor. His birth was seen as a great relief to the Thai royal family at the time, which had been anxiously awaiting a son.\n\nVajiralongkorn stands for \"adorned with jewels or thunderbolts\" in Thai, BBC reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough he was officially named Crown Prince in 1972, aged 15, he actually spent much of his childhood outside Thailand.\n\nHe was sent to school in England from ages 13 to 17, before enrolling at military college in Australia until 1976.\n\nHe attended prep school at 13 before moving on to the prestigious Millfield boarding school, where he finished at 17.\n\nHe then attended Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra, Australia. He graduated in 1976.\n\nHe struggled to keep up at school in England and Australia, blaming his upbringing in the Thai palace, the BBC reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduation he joined the Thai army, where he served as an officer and worked for most of his life.\n\nHe is a qualified pilot on both civilian and military aircraft, and flies his own Boeing 737 when he travels overseas, BBC reported.\n\nHe has received military training in Thailand, the UK, US, and Australia.\n\nAfter the death of his father King Bhumibol in October 2016, Maha Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne as His Majesty King Rama X.\n\nThis means he is the tenth monarch of the royal house of Chakri, per BBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Maha Vajiralongkorn's coronation only took place three years later because he wanted the country to mourn his father first.\n\nMaha Vajiralongkorn \"deemed it appropriate to allow a period of time for the people to pay their respects to the late King,\" Thailand's National Legislative Assembly said in an October 2016 announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe long-awaited coronation, which took place in May 2019, was a spectacular event.\n\nSome 1,300 people and elephants paraded near Thailand's Grand Palace for six-and-a-half hours, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire procession reportedly cost the government $31 million.\n\nEarlier in the day, Maha Vajiralongkorn also wore a 7.3-kg (16-pound) crown topped with an Indian diamond, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree days before the coronation, Maha Vajiralongkorn married his longtime partner and personal bodyguard in a surprise ceremony.\n\nThe wedding was a surprise because the palace had never acknowledged the king's romantic relationship with General Suthida Vajiralongkorn before.\n\nFootage of the wedding showed Suthida kneeling and bowing to the king before sitting beside him to sign marriage documents inside the ornate Ampornsathan Throne Hall in Bangkok.\n\nPart of the ceremony also involved the king pouring sacred water on Suthida's head, according to the BBC.\n\nThis is his fourth marriage.\n\nRead more: The king of Thailand married his bodyguard in a lavish surprise ceremony\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe king's marriage to Suthida cemented her position as Queen.\n\nShe joined him on the palace balcony during his ascension festivities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July, the king also bestowed the title of Royal Noble Consort to Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, a former army nurse believed to be another longtime girlfriend.\n\nFootage from the ceremony also showed the king splashing water on Wongvajirapakdi's face at the ceremony, Insider previously reported.\n\nShe is the first person to be formally granted the role since 1921.\n\nQueen Suthida sat beside her husband during the occasion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August, the Thai royal household gave a glimpse of what life is like there by releasing rare photos of Wongvajirapakdi wearing a crop top and piloting a plane.\n\nThe Thai royal palace's official website crashed after those photos were released, Reuters reported.\n\nRead more: Thailand released rare photos of the king's royal consort flying a plane and shooting an assault rifle\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions between Wongvajirapakdi and Queen Suthida came to light in October 2019, however, when the king accused Wongvajirapakdi of plotting against the queen.\n\nWongvajirapakdi wanted to be queen herself, and tried to stop the king from marrying Suthida, a palace statement said.\n\nThe king tried to ease tensions between the two women by giving Wongvajirapakdi the title of royal consort — an approach that appeared not to have worked.\n\nDespite her new rank, Wongvajirapakdi \"did everything to make herself equal to Queen Suthida\" and disobeyed the king and queen, Channel News Asia reported, paraphrasing the palace.\n\nWongvajirapakdi's actions became public in October 2019 when the king announced that he had stripped her of all royal and military titles for disloyalty.\n\nIn September 2020, the king restored all Wongvajirapakdi's military ranks and took her back as his royal consort, Insider previously reported.\n\nRead more: The King of Thailand abruptly stripped all royal titles from his 34-year-old consort, who is accused of plotting against the queen to take her place\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn top of this the king has a reputation for womanizing, having fathered seven children by three women.\n\nHe has had numerous acrimonious divorces in the past.\n\nHis mother, Queen Sirikit, reportedly once described her son as \"a little bit of a Don Juan\" in the early 1980s, per The Guardian.\n\nShe also suggested that her son preferred spending his weekends in the company of beautiful women over carrying out his formal royal duties, BBC reported.\n\nUnproven rumors have also circulated that he was previously involved in illicit activities, though no details or specifics have ever been released.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Maha Vajiralongkorn directly addressed the rumors in a meeting with journalists in 1992, saying: \"Do I look like a mafia boss type? I tell you, if I were, I would have been a millionaire by now.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaha Vajiralongkorn is likely shielded from those rumors in Thailand, which has strict lèse-majesté laws, which forbid people to insult, defame, or threaten any member of the royal family.\n\nHe even jailed the parents of his third wife, a lady-in-waiting named Srirasmi, under those laws by accusing them of abusing their connections with him, the BBC and The Sun reported.\n\nRead more: A YouTuber is facing criminal charges for shading a Miss Universe dress designed by a Thai princess because in Thailand it's illegal to insult the monarchy\n\nHe's a keen cyclist, and has regularly led mass biking events in Bangkok in the past.\n\nHe participated in the \"Bike Un Ai Rak\" or \"Bike Love and Warmth\" event in December 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis daughter Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana has also taken part in these events in the past.\n\nSirivannavari Nariratana participated in the \"Bike for Dad\" event in Bangkok in 2015.\n\nHe's even been seen cycling in a crop top around Switzerland ...\n\nSource: Luzerner Zeitung, Bild\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in even fewer clothes in Germany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe eccentric king is also known for his love for dogs.\n\nWhen his pet poodle Foo Foo died in 2016, he gave him a four-day-long Buddhist funeral ceremony, per The Sun\n\nHe used to dress Foo Foo up as an air chief marshall and take him to formal events, The Guardian reported.\n\nRead next\n\nhotel Germany Arts & Culture\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
