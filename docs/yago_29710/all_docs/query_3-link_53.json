        "text": "Thailand has a new queen just in time for the coronation of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in elaborate Buddhist and Brahmin ceremonies on Saturday in Bangkok.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn and his consort, Gen. Suthida Vajiralongkorn named Queen Suthida, attend their wedding ceremony in Bangkok.\n\nThe 66-year-old king unexpectedly married the deputy commander of his personal bodyguard unit on Wednesday in a surprise ceremony, giving her the title Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhaya.\n\nSuthida, 40, is expected to participate in some of the coronation events.\n\nHere are some facts about the new queen from the palace’s household bureau, past royal decrees and media.\n\nShe was born June 3, 1978, as Suthida Tidjai.\n\nShe graduated from Assumption University, a private university in Bangkok, with a bachelor’s degree in communication arts in 2000, according to the Thai Rath newspaper.\n\nShe worked as a flight attendant at Thai Airways before joining the protection unit of then-Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn.\n\nCriticising or insulting her is a crime under Thailand’s lese majeste laws, which carry punishment of up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe king, queen, heir to the throne and regent are covered under the law.\n\nShe already held the rank of general in the Royal Thai Army before her marriage, having been promoted to the position in December 2016 by King Vajiralongkorn by royal decree.\n\nThat was shortly after he took the throne following the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nBefore the wedding, she was deputy commander of the King’s Own Bodyguard Regiment.\n\nThe king himself is commander of the unit, and he first designated her to the special officer unit of Crown Prince’s Bodyguard Regiment in 2013.\n\nShe made her debut on Royal News, a nightly segment about the king and his family aired on all Thai television channels, hours after her wedding.\n\nThe wedding came as a surprise to many Thais because the palace had never previously acknowledged any personal relationship between her and King Vajiralongkorn, who has previously been married and divorced three times."
