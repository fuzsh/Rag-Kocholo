        "text": "Vajiralongkorn — who inherited the throne after his father, King Bhumibol, died in 2016 — is also known as King Rama X, signaling that he is the 10th monarch of the royal house of Chakri.\n\nThe marriage took place lawfully and in the righteous royal tradition, the statement said. The general will now be known as Queen Suthida.\n\nThe king \"has decided to promote General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, his royal consort, to become Queen Suthida and she will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family,\" the statement said, according to BBC and CNN translations.\n\nThe ceremony took place in Bangkok in the Ampornsathan Throne Hall, a large room filled with ornate mirrors, statuettes, and a golden shrine.\n\nFootage of the wedding showed Suthida kneeling and bowing to the king alongside other attendees, before sitting on the throne beside him to sign marriage documents. As part of the ceremony, the king poured sacred water on Suthida's head, the BBC reported.\n\nThe surprise marriage came three days before Vajiralongkorn's long-awaited official coronation, which is this Saturday to Monday.\n\nThe coronation is taking place three years after Vajiralongkorn ascended the throne because the country went through a mourning period for King Bhumibol, whose royal cremation was in 2017, The Guardian reported. The newspaper said the coronation is expected to cost at least $30 million.\n\nThailand is extraordinarily reverent to its monarch, and people can be imprisoned for up to 15 years if they are found to have insulted the monarchy.\n\nThe country's strict lèse-majesté laws forbid people to insult, defame, or threaten any member of the royal family. Suthida is now protected by those laws.\n\nRead more: A YouTuber is facing criminal charges for shading a Miss Universe dress designed by a Thai princess because in Thailand it's illegal to insult the monarchy\n\nBefore joining then-Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn's bodyguard unit in 2013, Suthida worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways.\n\nIn December 2016, shortly after ascending the throne, Vajiralongkorn made her a full general in the Royal Thai Army.\n\nThis is Vajiralongkorn's fourth marriage. He has been divorced three times and has seven children."
