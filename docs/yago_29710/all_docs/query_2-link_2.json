        "text": "Crown prince\n\nIn 1976 Vajiralongkorn graduated from the Royal Military College, where his education was split into a military training course designed by the Australian Army and a bachelor’s degree program supervised by the University of New South Wales. Upon graduation he was qualified to fly military jets and helicopters. His training as a pilot was not ceremonial, as he flew missions to quash a Thai communist insurgency in the 1970s.\n\nVajiralongkorn’s time as crown prince was marked by controversy, and he did little to stay out of the public eye. His marital affairs in particular led to significant scandal. In 1977 he married his first cousin, Princess Soamsawali, with whom he had his first child, Princess Bajrakitiyabha, in the winter of 1978. However, over the following decade Vajiralongkorn would father five children with Thai actress Sujarinee Vivacharawongse. In 1991 he divorced Soamsawali and in 1994 married Sujarinee in a ceremony that was attended by King Bhumibol but not by Queen Sikrit.\n\nVajiralongkorn publicly denounced Sujarinee in 1996, accusing her of adultery and stripping her and their five children of all royal titles and privileges. Sujarinee and her children fled to England. Sujarinee’s only daughter, Sirivannavari, was allowed to return to Thailand to live with her father, and in 2005 King Bhumibol reelevated her to the status of princess. However, Sujarinee and her four sons sought political asylum in the United States.\n\nIn 2001 Vajiralongkorn married Srirasmi Suwadee, a young woman from a commoner family. Four years later she gave birth to Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti. The marriage ended in 2014 when Vajiralongkorn accused Srirasmi and seven members of her family of corruption. She was stripped of her royal titles, and both of her parents were jailed for two and a half years under charges of lèse-majesté. Srirasmi avoided a jail sentence by choosing a monastic life as a mae chi (a female Buddhist monk), under conditions comparable to house arrest. Srirasmi was also made to waive custody of her son, Dipangkorn. In 2019, shortly before his ascension, Vajiralongkorn married Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana, a Thai Airways flight attendant who is now queen of Thailand.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He was known for traveling in public wearing a small midriff-baring tank top. In 2009 he named his pet poodle Foo Foo an air chief marshal of Thailand. That same year, a video was leaked of Srirasmi, then princess of Thailand, feeding Foo Foo birthday cake while topless. These antics were a major source of concern for both King Bhumibol and the Thai public prior to Vajiralongkorn’s ascension to the throne.\n\nReign as king\n\nVajiralongkorn’s father, King Bhumibol, died on October 13, 2016. The crown prince did not accept the throne immediately, instead asking for time to mourn his father. On December 1 Vajiralongkorn finally accepted the crown. More than two years later, on May 4, 2019, Vajiralongkorn had his official coronation at the Grand Palace in Bangkok and was named King Rama X of the Chakri Dynasty. At 64 years old, Vajiralongkorn became the oldest monarch to ascend the Thai throne.\n\nVajiralongkorn’s reign has been marked by increasing political discontent in Thailand. Disillusionment with Thailand’s monarchy and military elite had long been growing among Thai youth, who have advocated for a more legitimate democratic system. The transition to power from the beloved Bhumibol Adulyadej to his deeply unpopular son, Vajiralongkorn, has only accelerated this trend, with parties such as the Future Forward Party and the Move Forward Party openly challenging the political establishment. Vajiralongkorn initially attempted to appear as a benevolent ruler, making concessions to his critics and attempting to rehabilitate his public image. As opposition has grown more threatening, however, Vajiralongkorn has taken an increasingly harsh stance against dissent.\n\nRumored succession crisis\n\nThe question of succession to the Thai throne has become increasingly uncertain. By the early 2020s three of Vajiralongkorn’s children retained their royal titles: Princess Bajrakitiyabha, Princess Sirivannavari, and Prince Dipangkorn. No woman has ever ascended the throne of Thailand, and although it is technically possible under the Thai constitution, it is unlikely that Vajiralongkorn would designate a female heir except in the absence of any male prospects. Prince Dipangkorn has long been rumored to be autistic or otherwise neurologically disabled. Additionally, in 2022, Princess Bajrakitiyabha, the only full-blooded royal of the king’s children, collapsed and slipped into a coma, from which she has not recovered. Thus, there is no clear heir apparent.\n\nVacharaesorn Vivacharawongse, an American lawyer who is the second son of Vajiralongkorn’s second wife, Sujarinee, made several visits to Thailand in 2023 and 2024. He has been seen in meetings with foreign heads of government, including former German Pres. Christian Wulff. It is rumored that Vacharaesorn is being considered as a potential successor to the throne. However, the matter remains shrouded in intrigue."
