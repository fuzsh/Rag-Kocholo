        "text": "Thailandâ€™s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has married his long-time bodyguard in a surprise move just days before his coronation.\n\nThe Royal Gazette published an announcement saying Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya, a former flight attendant, had \"legally married\" the king in accordance with royal traditions.\n\n\"Therefore, he bestows (the title) on General Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhya from Queen Consort to Queen Suthida as of now,\" the announcement said.\n\nThe ceremony was overseen by Vajiralongkorn wearing a white uniform in Bangkok's Dusit Palace Wednesday, according to a broadcast of the announcement, which showed Queen Suthida in a traditional Thai silk dress.\n\nThe unpredictable king is due to be crowned the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty in an elaborate three-day ceremony starting Saturday.\n\nLong seen trailing the king in public events as part of his personal security retinue, Suthida, a former Thai Airways flight attendant, was given the rank of \"general\" in 2016.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn, who has been married three times, is frequently abroad in Germany.\n\nHarsh lese-majeste laws have shielded public scrutiny of his colourful private life, and all media in Thailand must self-censor.\n\nThis weekend's coronation will be the first since King Vajiralongkorn's late father's nearly 70 years ago.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what role Queen Suthida will play in the ceremony.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
