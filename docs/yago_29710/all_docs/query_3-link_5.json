        "text": "Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has married the deputy head of his personal bodyguard unit, making her Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhaya.\n\nIn a surprise ceremony, the 66-year-old royal tied the knot with his 40-year-old bride ahead of his coronation, which will be marked with elaborate Buddhist and Brahmin ceremonies this weekend in Bangkok.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn, also known by the title King Rama X, became constitutional monarch following the death in October 2016 of his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who sat on the throne for 70 years.\n\nThe father-of-seven has previously been married and divorced three times, most recently in 2014.\n\nThai television, which broadcast the royal order, showed a video of Suthida prostrating herself before the king.\n\nShe presented her new husband with a tray of flowers and joss sticks, and in return was bestowed traditional gifts associated with royal power.\n\nBorn Suthida Tidjai, the new queen graduated from Bangkok’s private Assumption University with a bachelor’s degree in communication arts in 2000, the Thai Rath newspaper reported.\n\nShe previously worked as a flight attendant on Thai Airways International and the couple are believed to have met on a flight.\n\nAfter joining the palace guard in 2013, she became deputy commander of the king’s own bodyguard regiment.\n\nHer husband is commander of the unit.\n\nBefore their marriage, she held the rank of general in the royal Thai army, having been promoted to the position by royal decree in December 2016 shortly after King Vajiralongkorn took the throne.\n\nThe new queen also has several top royal decorations.\n\nCriticising or insulting her is a crime under Thailand’s lese majeste laws, which carry punishment of up to 15 years in prison for each incident.\n\nThe king, queen, heir to the throne and regent are covered under the law.\n\nDuring this weekend’s coronation, the king is likely to bestow his new bride with new royal titles, as is tradition for a new monarch.\n\nReuters contributed to this report"
