        "text": "Bangkok: King Maha Vajiralongkorn's new wife, Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayutthaya, has been named Thailand's Queen effective from Wednesday, three days ahead of his coronation.\n\nThe announcement was made in the Royal Gazette, which said the King has legally married Suthida, but did not specify the date of their marriage.\n\nSuthida, who is believed to be 40, has long been rumoured to be romantically linked with Vajiralongkorn, 66, since he was the crown prince, but their relationship was not made public until now.\n\nSuthida is Vajiralongkorn's fourth wife. He has five sons and two daughters from his previous marriages.\n\nAlthough Suthida has been in the public eye for about three years, there has been little official information released about her and the news was a surprise to many Thais. She is reported to have previously worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways International. The two reportedly met on a flight.\n\nSuthida joined the palace guard in 2013 and became commander of the King's security unit, essentially his bodyguards, currently holding a general's rank. She also has several top royal decorations.\n\nVajiralongkorn ascended the throne when his late father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, died in 2016 after seven decades on the throne. His much-delayed coronation is due to be held on Saturday.\n\nThai television, which broadcast the royal order on Wednesday evening, showed a video of Suthida prostrating herself before the King, to whom she, according to the announcer, presented a tray of flowers and incense, and in return was bestowed traditional gifts associated with royal power.\n\nIt also showed the King in a white uniform and his bride in a pink silk traditional dress formally registering their marriage on Wednesday in his palace residence in the capital, Bangkok.\n\nIt showed what the television announcer said was the couple signing a marriage certificate book, which was also signed by the King's sister, Princess Sirindhorn, and Privy Council head Prem Tinsulanonda as witnesses. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and other senior officials were also in attendance.\n\nVajiralongkorn is the world's richest monarch according to business news website Business Insider, having last year taken full ownership of the Crown Property Bureau, which is estimated to have at least $US42.6 billion worth of holdings.\n\nAP, DPA"
