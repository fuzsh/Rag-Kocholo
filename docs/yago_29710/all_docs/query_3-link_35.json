        "text": "ANKARA\n\nThe three-time divorcee King of Thailand has married his former bodyguard deputy commander.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who will be formally crowned on Saturday, announced his marriage to Gen Suthida Tidjai, the daily Bankok Post reported.\n\nSuthida -- now to be addressed as queen -- is to enjoy all royal rank benefits, according to an announcement in the Thai Royal Gazette on Wednesday.\n\nThe official marriage proceedings were overseen by Vajiralongkorn wearing a white uniform in Ampornsathan Throne Hall at Dusit Palace in Bangkok with the attendance of Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader of the military junta in power since a 2014 army coup.\n\nThe 66-year-old Vajiralongkorn took over the monarchy after his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej died in October 2016 after ruling for 70 years.\n\nThe incumbent king had previously been married and divorced three times and has seven children.\n\nFlight attendant to queen\n\nSuthida Tidjai once served as a former Thai Airways flight attendant before Vajiralongkorn appointed her as deputy commander of his bodyguard detail in 2014.\n\nThe Thai palace had never officially acknowledged a relationship between the two.\n\nVajiralongkorn made Suthida a full general in the Royal Thai Army in December 2016 before being appointed as deputy commander of the king's personal guard in 2017.\n\nA procession will be held through Bangkok following Vajiralongkorn’s coronation which will involve elaborate Buddhist and Brahmin ceremonies on Saturday.\n\nThailand has been a constitutional-monarchy since 1932 where the executive is elected by people, while kings also hold substantial influence."
