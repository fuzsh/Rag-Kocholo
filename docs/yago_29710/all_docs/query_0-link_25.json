        "text": "Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali was born to the Kitiyakara family on 13 July 1957 at Guys Hospital in the UK. On 3 July 1977, when she was 19 years old, she married His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Her title then was announced to be HRH Princess Soamsawali, Royal Consort of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. Her Royal Highness Princess Bajrakitiyabha, their only daughter, was born on 7 December 1978.\n\nOn 12 August 1991, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej graciously promulgated her new title to be HRH Princess Soamsawali, the Princess Mother of the Kings First Grandchild. HRH Princess Soamsawali has performed a number of royal duties for the sake of Thai citizens. In addition, she is usually designated by Their Majesties the King and Queen, Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, Her Royal Highness Princess Chulabhorn, and Her Royal Highness Princess Bejaratana to perform royal duties on their behalf.\n\nHRH Princess Soamsawali has also been playing very important roles in public health and social welfare, especially in the Thai Red Cross Society. She has been giving frequent contributions and dedication in keeping a number of projects under her royal patronage, notably those for patients and infants suffering from HIV/AIDS. Reducing AIDS Infection from Mother to New-Born Baby Program, Milk funds for infants, Medical Funding for AIDS patients, Funding for Reducing AIDS infection from Mother to the New-Born Baby, and Program of Life Giving to the Parents of AIDS-infected Babies-- to name just a few-- are among her projects truly appreciated by Thai citizens.\n\nExamples of some other non-HIV/AIDS projects under her royal patronage are the Thalassemia Foundation of Thailand, the Funds for Cancer Treatment in Children, the Bangkhae Home Foundation for senior citizens, the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women, and the Princess Pa Foundation. The Princess Pa Foundation has been active since 1995 with the mission to help victims suffering from severe natural disasters. Up until present, HRH Princess Soamsawali is the honorary lifetime president of the foundation, while her daughter HRH Princess Bajrakitiyabha is the president."
