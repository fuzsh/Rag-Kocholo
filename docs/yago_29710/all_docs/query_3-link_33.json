        "text": "Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn’s 1996 proclamation of divorce vividly highlighted the alleged crimes of his second wife – and former consort – Sujarinee Vivacharawongse. The heir-apparent to Thailand’s throne hung posters on his palace’s walls explicitly accusing her of adultery, abuse and fraud. Sujarinee soon fled to Britain with their five children.\n\nAlthough this incident was etched into the national consciousness, little light has been shed on Sujarinee’s life beyond her role as the former wife of Vajiralongkorn, who has been Thailand’s king since 2016.\n\nEarly life and career: an aspiring actress\n\nBorn in 1962, Sujarinee was introduced to the arts at a young age by her father, a musician and composer for a local band. Sujarinee entered the entertainment industry at age 15, adopting the stage-name Benz. She starred in several low-budget films between 1977 and 1979 before announcing her retirement from acting.\n\nA new station in life: marriage and acceptance into the royal family\n\nAfter the Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn and Sujarinee were introduced to each other, the couple quickly became a common sight in public.\n\nIn February 1994, they were married in a palace ceremony that required the blessing of the Crown Prince’s father, King Rama IX, but not by Queen Sirikit herself. The royal family did not immediately publicise the marriage.\n\nA name and title change\n\nFollowing her marriage to Vajiralongkorn, the former actress was granted permission to modify her birth name, Yuvadhida Polpraserth, to one that signified her new status as a commoner wed to a royal: Mom Sujarinee Mahidol na Ayudhaya. She also received a commission as a major in the army and was allowed to participate in royal ceremonies alongside her new husband.\n\nProfound loss and dislocation\n\nFollowing the pivotal allegations of infidelity with Anand Rotsamkhan, a 60-year-old air marshal, Sujarinee and her sons immediately lost their royal titles and diplomatic passports. They found refuge in Britain, but the Crown Prince soon had their only daughter, Sirivannavari, returned to Thailand.\n\nA daughter and princess raised thousands of miles away\n\nToday, at 31 years old, Sujarinee’s daughter is a media darling, beloved by an adoring public. Princess Sirivannavari won a gold medal in badminton at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games and has established a name for herself as a creative producer and designer in the fashion industry. At the invitation of Pierre Balmain, she has showcased her designs in Paris and regularly appears at fashion events all over the globe.\n\nWant more stories like this? Sign up here.
