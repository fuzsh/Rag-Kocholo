        "text": "Uncharted path\n\nKing Bhumibol ruled Thailand for seven decades, a time in which the country underwent massive change and turmoil, including war and more than a dozen coups (both attempted and successful).\n\nBhumibol was seen as a unifying figure, beloved by most Thais and regarded as above politics.\n\nAs the king's health faded during his last years, instability and chaos dominated the country. Popularly elected Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown in a military coup in 2006, and another one followed in 2014.Since then, the military junta has passed\n\ntwo constitutions shoring up its power and weakening its rivals.\n\nSome observers put the tensions down to uncertainty over the looming succession. Bhumibol was seen as a vital source of political legitimacy for all sides, and he will be a tough act to follow.\n\nReporting on the succession or the royal family is limited by strict lèse-majesté laws, which impose harsh sentences on anyone who defames or insults the King or senior royals."
