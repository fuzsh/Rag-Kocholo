        "text": "THE minimum requirement for Le Weekend New Yorkais was about as basic as a crusty baguette.\n\nMy French husband and I yearned for a Manhattan with a Gallic accent -- a bistro perhaps where a petit caniche begs for sugar cubes below a polished bar, or a brasserie where the mood is casual, the air is more smoke than oxygen and the frites are served with mustard and the songs of Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nWe never found the sugar-starved poodle beside the bar. But we did learn how to satisfy the inexplicable urge to listen daily to ''La Marseillaise,'' the French national anthem, courtesy of the French Embassy's Web site.\n\nA weekend search for La Vie a New York is rather like hurtling through a dizzying blur of Metro stops. With such a richness of traditional and unconventional French cultural offerings, a tourist can visit a Museum of Modern Art exhibition of Monet and Cezanne landscapes one day and head the next to Claude Leveque's ''Stigmata '99'' installation, a disco-inspired staircase of flickering crimson light and mirrors at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City.\n\nDetermined Francophiles can rise at dawn to the latest Radio France Internationale news reports from Paris on 91.5 FM and drift to sleep to the hypnotic drone of 24-hour TV5 satellite programming featuring French shows like ''Bouillon de Culture'' or ''Paris Chic Choc.''\n\nBut the freshest serenade comes from a modern-day group of French explorers who have come to New York to disseminate the dernier cri in European music, a quirky minimalist electronic style that is sometimes called Le French Touch.\n\n''We've been here for two years and there are so many French people it's getting scary,'' said Mary-Noelle Dana, an expatriate Parisian and self-described ''settler'' who organizes periodic showcases for French musicians and disc jockeys at the Knitting Factory in TriBeCa.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
