ROSE AVENUE OXNARD CA US 93010 MA-L,080030,ROYAL MELBOURNE INST OF TECH,GPO BOX 2476V MELBOURNE VIC AU 3001 MA-L,080030,CERN,CH-1211 GENEVE SUISSE/SWITZ CH 023\n\nRegistry,Assignment,Organization Name,Organization Address MA-L,0001C8,THOMAS CONRAD CORP.,1908-R KRAMER LANE AUSTIN TX US 78758 MA-L,0001C8,CONRAD CORP.,\n\nThe IEEE provides the following footnote on page 7 of the linked document.\n\nThe IEEE Registration Authority makes a concerted effort to avoid duplicate assignments but does not guarantee that duplicate assignments have not occurred. Global uniqueness also depends on proper use of assignments and absence of faults that might result in duplication.\n\nhttps://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-standards/standards/web/documents/tutorials/eui.pdf\n\nThe Wireshark OUI lookup tool, based on their own compiled list, gives one answer for which of these organizations is currently assigned.\n\nNetwork Research Corporation\n\nhttps://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup\n\nAnd the maclookup website, which seems reasonable, gives a different answer.\n\nCERN\n\nhttps://maclookup.app/macaddress/080030\n\nThere are no timestamps in the data file. There is no explicit row sorting and ordering (and it doesn't look sorted or ordered). Bottom line, there seems to be no way to use the data file and supporting documents alone to determine which assignment is correct.\n\nThis is strange, never seen such a thing, are you sure you are pulling the correct file from IEEE.\n\nI've reviewed the 3 companies you mentioned in the file, it has different Prefixes.\n\nCERN Mac prefix is 80D336\n\nNetwork Research Corporation has two prefixes, one of which the one mentioned in the question.\n\nCouldn't find this company in any DB.\n\nI think your parser is somehow corrupted especially if you are parsing the text file."
