        "text": "It‚Äôs day 28 and the home stretch of Movember. This year I‚Äôm behind pace of my goal, but I‚Äôm determined to push until the end of the month to make as big of an impact as I can. I campaign every year to pay honour to the memory of my stepson Gabriel. We lost Gabriel in July of 2018 as result of mental illness, addiction and suicide. Each Movember I campaign to nudge every man out there to take care of themselves. I implore all men to live by the MO5. 1. Live a lifestyle that maintains or improves health and quality of life. 2. Develop positive habits and access to support to build mental resistance. 3. Develop and maintain positive social support networks. 4. Develop greater personal awareness of health. 5. Take action to get support when something isn‚Äôt right or health is at risk. This is why I MO every year. To pay tribute to Gabriel and to reach out to all my fellow men and encourage them to take better care of one another. So please visit my campaign page and learn a little bit more about why I MO and if you‚Äôre able to, leave a donation to help the cause. #movember2023 #mensmentalhealthawareness #prostatecancerawareness #testicularcancerawareness #menshealthawareness #suicidepreventionawareness https://lnkd.in/extB9iB\n\n**Unveiling the Silent Struggle: A Movember Call to Action** Every 40 seconds, a life is lost to suicide. üíî **Why Movember Matters:** Beyond the mustaches, Movember is a platform to raise awareness of men‚Äôs health issues. Let's not only raise funds for prostate cancer but also break the silence surrounding mental health struggles, including the heartbreaking reality of suicide. ü§ù **Your Impact:** Every donation fuels not only cancer research but also mental health initiatives. By supporting Movember, you're contributing to a world where conversations about mental well-being are as common as growing a 'stache in November. https://lnkd.in/grqnWYf #MovemberCares #SilentStruggle #MentalHealthMatters\n\nMovember 2023 ‚Äì Change the face of men‚Äôs health Movember is back raising money and awareness about men‚Äôs health issues such as mental health, suicide, prostate cancer and testicular cancer. Growing of moustaches is encouraged. A mo is like wearing a symbol representing healthier men which can unite and start conversations that can sprout real change. Recently, women, known as the ‚Äòmo-sistas‚Äô have joined the movement. The importance of the Mo Sista: Men‚Äôs poor health may affect men physically, but it impacts everyone in their lives, women included. Women tend to be the gateway to health in a man‚Äôs life ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a sister, mother, friend or wife - and can play a key role in helping men to start those simple health conversations. Mo Sistas can sign up, commit to MOVE and fundraise. Move is Movember‚Äôs challenge to men & women alike to get active for the 30 days of the month of November. This could be cycling, swimming, yoga etc. If you love walking or running the ‚ÄúMove for mental health challenge‚Äù involves walking or running 60km in November to remember the 60 men globally who lose their life to suicide every hour. To sign up to ‚ÄúMOVE‚Äù or ‚Äúgrow a mo‚Äù or if you wish to host your own fundraising event, click the link: www.uk.movember.com Help fly the mo flag this Movember, make a difference and help men live happier lives.\n\nüß†üåü Celebrate the Neuro Community with Us! üåüüß† Join hands with The Neurological Alliance across the UK as we celebrate the incredible individuals, charities, not-for-profit organizations, and support networks during Brain Awareness Week this week (11‚Äì17 March 2024).

I'm reaching out to ask for your support for an amazing cause that‚Äôs close to my heart. I'm raising funds for Flatwater Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to providing mental health therapy and support for families affected by cancer. Their work is crucial; every donation can make a huge difference in someone's life. Here‚Äôs why you should consider donating: 1. Mental Health Support: Flatwater Foundation offers counseling and therapy to those in need, ensuring that no one has to face cancer alone. 2. Comprehensive Care: They provide services not just for patients but also for their families, promoting holistic healing and support. 3.

So whether you‚Äôre raising money for charity by committing to a run or a walk, growing a 'mo' or simply 'mo-ing' your own way this November, we want to encourage everyone to talk more openly about the importance of men's physical and mental health. We can‚Äôt ignore the fact that men tend to be more reluctant to seek help or treatment for their health struggles and studies have highlighted that a lot of men today feel that there is a huge conflict between masculinity and seeking treatment for their mental wellbeing. In light of this, we feel it's more important than ever to raise awareness for men‚Äôs health - especially being a part of the construction industry - which is mainly male-dominated and well know for it's high stress environment! So if you‚Äôre struggling or know someone who is and want to help take a look at https://uk.movember.com for more info. #Movember #MentalHealth #MentalHealthAwareness #MensMentalHealth #Construction #Flooring #TeamBlade\n\nLast years tash generated a lot of discussion, mainly laughing at the state of it. So of course I am doing it again this year! However, I am glad to say, there is a Reconomy Group team partaking! üéâ If you can donate, that's great. If it makes you have a conversation about your mental health or taboo subjects about changes in your body, even better. #movember #mentalhealthmatters #cancerawareness https://lnkd.in/eZfhmjhU"
