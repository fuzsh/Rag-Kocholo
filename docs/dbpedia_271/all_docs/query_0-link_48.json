        "text": "Designed for Sound\n\nWhile their D-Premier and Expert Pro stations won them countless praise and awards from the industry, it was not until 2015 and the launch of the Phantom all-in-one speaker that Devialet really flexed its design wings. Whilst retaining the ethos of sleek and compact design that defined the previous products, the Phantom looks like no other Bluetooth® speaker on the market. The brainchild of product designer and Devialet co-founder Emmanuel Nardin, Phantom’s design is based on the ultimate acoustic form: the sphere. While the interior design is painstakingly optimised to offer the best possible sound, the exterior is an ode to sculptural radicalism. Faintly reminiscent of Apple’s designs from the 2000s, the Phantom is uncompromising in both function and form. It adds, however, a “touch of lyricism that is unexpected but essential”, from the mashrabiya-shaped tweeter grid resembling sound waves to the movement of the bass membranes.\n\nThe departure from the traditional aesthetics of the hi-fi world – think varnished wood and matte metal, not glass fibre and ABS – raised more than a few eyebrows upon launch. But once again, the company managed to get the best of both worlds, drawing in a younger, tech-savvy crowd with its sharp design and simplicity, while keeping older audiophiles coming with over-the-top acoustics – for a fraction of the price of a traditional hi-fi setup.\n\nMake your own kind of music\n\nAccording to its CEO, Devialet sees itself more as a tech start-up than as audio equipment manufacturer. But the ways it chooses to engage with its diverse audience defies categorisation. Its celebrity endorsers include famous violinists, Beyonce & Jay-Z, and Indian superstar Shah Rukh Khan. On a more relatable scale, Devialet is happy to kit out influencers and VIP customers with products for them to advertise to friends and contacts during high-end listening events. Likewise, you’ll find Phantom speakers hovering around some of the hippest shops and venues in the world, from the late Parisian icon Colette to Barney’s in New York.\n\nBut the magic doesn’t stop there. Partnerships with the Opéra de Paris or the Royal Albert Hall in London aim to create new sound experiences linked to these spaces, with some available to Devialet customers via the company app. The “Live on Phantom” program is similar, promising the emotion of a live concert in San Francisco from the comfort of your Hong Kong living room. From classical music to electronica, and from grey-haired audiophile to the young Silicon Valley techie, Devialet has got everyone covered.\n\nThe future sounds brilliant\n\n2018 looks to be a busy year for Devialet, as the company ramps up its music offerings with new partnerships, new collaborations such as The Lost Recordings with indie label Fondamenta and a bigger “Live on Phantom” line-up. But the real challenge comes from the product side. Devialet’s last investment round exposed the company’s desire to export its ground-breaking technology beyond the realm of living-room hi-fi. “The audio market is about 100 million units a year, but the whole sound market, [including] devices [such as] TVs, laptops, the smartphones, cars, is about 3 billion units a year”, says Quentin Sannié. That leaves a lot of room for growth. Beyond its goal of upgrading all of our devices’ audio experience, Devialet is said to be working towards “a final goal”, a definitive audio product, 10 to 15 years down the line. No one knows what it is but, based on what the brand has shown so far, it sounds very promising.\n\nWe are always looking for new, fresh brands to make an appearance in our articles.
