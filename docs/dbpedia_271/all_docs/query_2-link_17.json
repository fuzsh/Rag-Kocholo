        "text": "Warning: This page contains spoilers for the May 29, 2023, game of Jeopardy! — please do not scroll down if you wish to avoid being spoiled. Please note that the game airs as early as noon Eastern in some U.S. television markets.\n\nHere’s today’s Final Jeopardy (in the category Memorials) for Monday, May 29, 2023 (Season 39, Game 186):\n\nThe Vietnam War crypt at this memorial has been empty since the remains once there were identified & moved to St. Louis\n\n(correct response beneath the contestants)\n\nToday’s Jeopardy! contestants:\n\nNiranjan Murali, an education policy professional from Washington, D.C.\n\nTravis Lee, a systems engineer from Phoenixville, Pennsylvania\n\nDiandra D’Alessio, a technical writer from Montreal, Quebec, Canada (1-day total: $3,299)\n\nAndy’s Pregame Thoughts:\n\nInterestingly, it always seems to be on holidays when the Jeopardy! website isn’t 100% operational. This morning appears to be another one of those cases—though I am very thankful that Friday’s episode gives us the “On Monday” preview these days. This is an excellent change made to the show’s presentation that also happens to serve as a backup to get information in case the website isn’t 100% operational. Once the episode airs, this website will eventually be updated with Niranjan’s occupation. As it turns out, we got lucky in the respect that one of Wednesday’s challengers, from the same local area as Travis, had an article written about them, that also happened to mention Travis in passing.\n\nAn interesting note that I’m sure will be helpful to Mark over at J! Archive when putting in information about today’s players: Travis’s wife is Season 32 contestant Shannon Lee, and Travis’s father is Season 14 contestant Wade Lee. (Unfortunately, neither Shannon nor Wade won their respective games; will Travis become the first?)\n\nAlso, on weekends going forward (with the first one slightly delayed), I’ll be presenting an “Andy’s Weekly Thoughts” editorial segment, where I touch on things that have been on my mind over the week regarding the show. The first one, making reference to last week’s happenings, should be going up very early this week.\n\nPSA: The best way to keep COVID-19 at bay (and keep Jeopardy! producing new episodes) is for everybody to get their vaccinations as soon as they can, including any boosters as recommended. When wearing a mask, please ensure that your mask covers both your nose and your mouth.\n\nAre you going on the show and looking for information about how to bet in Final Jeopardy?

Fan of all 16 players, now including Cris Pannullo and Ray Lalonde, that have won 10 or more games on Jeopardy!\n\nMore information about Final Jeopardy:\n\n(The following write-up is original content and is copyright 2023 The Jeopardy! Fan. It may not be copied without linked attribution back to this page.)\n\nFaced with the dilemma of having to potentially repatriate hundreds of thousands of soldiers’s remains after World War I, numerous Allied countries constructed war memorials known as Tombs of the Unknown Soldier, as a stand-in for those country’s service members with unidentifiable remains. The United States Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was constructed at Arlington National Cemetery in 1921. As to why the Vietnam crypt is vacant: every single one of the recovered remains of American soldiers from Vietnam have been identified; in the late 1990s, the remains entombed in the Vietnam crypt were positively identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie; as per his family’s wishes, Blassie was moved to the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis.\n\nWe have many new offerings at The Jeopardy! Fan Online Store! Proceeds from the sale of the “Doctor Oz’s Fast-Acting Snake Oil Elixir” T-shirt are being donated to The Trevor Project:\n\nYou can now listen to Alex Trebek-hosted Jeopardy! episodes from TuneIn Radio without leaving The Jeopardy!

I would honestly either bet $0 (in case Niranjan bets just $799 or even $800) or go all-in (maximizing winnings and forcing Travis to cover) because you can’t both cover Niranjan and win a Triple Stumper. (Actual bet: $3,601)\n\nTravis: Standard cover bet over Diandra is $5,201. (Actual bet: $5,201)\n\nNiranjan: If Travis makes the cover bet and is incorrect, he falls to $7,199. I’d bet $800 here, just in case Diandra bets $0 in this situation.(Actual bet: $800)\n\nBecome a Supporter now!
