        "text": "This is the latest in a series of blog posts by the 2018 CBC Montreal/Quebec Writers' Federation writer-in-residence, Joshua Levy.\n\nWhen I reach the Kondiaronk lookout in Mount Royal Park, the snow has stopped falling and people are busy snapping selfies by the edge of the mountain.\n\nI overhear a little girl ask, \"Is this one of the most beautiful places in the world, mommy?\"\n\n\"Je pense que oui,\" her mother replies.\n\nI nod to myself in agreement.\n\nAlthough it is cold enough to give a snowman frostbite, passing joggers are dripping with sweat. A woman, silently gazing at the Montreal skyline, puffs enthusiastically on her e-cigarette. A man hoists his little yapping dog onto the stone railing so it can share in the tranquil view.\n\nIn other words, nobody suspects that I have a time machine in my pocket.\n\nSlowly, carefully, like I am in an extremely low-budget version of Back to the Future, I hold up an old photo ...\n\n... and time travel back to the year 1916.\n\nThis is what I see:\n\nThe lookout's stone railing begins on my left, curves through the black-and-white photograph in my hand, and continues on the other side in an unbroken arc. As long as I hold this photograph at this angle, the faded people in my hand seem almost alive — or, at least, a little less dead.\n\nThey are dressed in early 20th century's finest fashions and seem transfixed by the Montreal skyline.\n\nWhat do they see? What, I wonder, did Montreal look like back then?\n\nI don't need to wonder long. I have a time machine.\n\nReaching into my trusty pocket, I remove another crumpled photograph and travel back, yet again, to 1916 — the year both photographs were captured by the legendary William Notman photography company.\n\nI try to imagine the lives of those who stood here before me.\n\nThe Montrealers of the 1960s, who cheered during the construction of Place Ville Marie and Expo 67. They lived in one of the most powerful, modern cities in the world. I wonder what that felt like?\n\nThe Montrealers of the 1950s, who could see the Forum from up here and wave as the Habs racked up one, two, three, four, five Stanley Cups in a row. I also wonder what that felt like.\n\nDo you have a favourite cool old photo of Montreal? Share them with us on CBC Montreal's Facebook page.\n\nOr the Montrealers of the 1940s, who leaned against this stone railing and agonized over whether the Nazis were going to win the war in Europe and turn their sights toward Quebec.\n\nEven Jacques Cartier once stood here, admiring quite a different scene, before claiming it all, ahem, in the name of the French king.\n\nI remember coming to this lookout as a child with my parents, as a teenager on dates, and as an adult with my wife. I hope that one day I remember coming here as an old man.\n\nCalm of the cemetery\n\nBurying my gloveless hands in my pockets in a futile attempt at warmth, I make my way towards the Mount Royal Cemetery.\n\nYes, I am one of those crazy people who find cemeteries calming.\n\nSoon I am trudging past rows of headstones. There are famous people here, like the McGills, the Redpaths and the Molsons. But I am far more interested in reading the names and minimalist histories of the countless milkmen, maids, and masons: the Montrealers of winters past.\n\nMade from sleek black granite, with the name ASSALY etched in the stone in simple block letters, the tombstone is a bench where people often sit during the warmer months.\n\nOn the Plateau Mont-Royal, I begin to time-travel again. It is addictive.\n\nA horse is hitched up on Saint Lawrence Boulevard.\n\nGlimpse into the future\n\nI mosey by a boarded-up building with a sign that shows a rendering of a proposed construction project.\n\nThe building looks born again with new glittering windows, additional storeys and Photoshopped Montrealers lounging and laughing in a grassy communal area.\n\nFor the first time today I think of Montreal's future, not its past.\n\nMontreal's future looks exciting.\n\nOn a whim, I walk into the closest café (it is Café Olimpico, for the historical records) and take out a pen and paper. I write about my past, my present, and my hopes for the future. I really pour my heart out onto the page.\n\nThen I place it in the envelope, write \"to the future, from Josh,\" and plant the letter in the snow, outside.\n\nAll of this time traveling has made me hungry. I cross the street and order a half-dozen bagels.\n\nThey are still warm with the comforting heat of the present.\n\nIf you had a Montreal time machine, what era would you want to check out? Share your ideas (and your great old photos of Montreal) on the CBC Montreal Facebook page."
