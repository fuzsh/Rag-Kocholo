        "text": "Returning home from vacation to the realities of everyday life is a BUMMER. Returning home from a Walt Disney World® Resort vacation is even harder to cope with. But there are many simple ways that you can recreate that magic at home!\n\nMy family’s tradition consists of visiting Magic Kingdom® on our first day then returning again on our very last night. Many tears have been shed upon walking out of the park and taking that last look at the illuminated beauty of Cinderella Castle. There is a reason Walt Disney World® Resort’s signature park, Magic Kingdom®, is referred to as “The Most Magical Place on Earth.”\n\nOne of my favorite things to do at Walt Disney World® Resort is snack my way through the parks. The cult-classic DOLE WhipTM tops my family’s list of delicious treats. When we’re longing for that refreshing pineapple delight at home, I whip up our (dairy) version of a DOLE WhipTM with this easy recipe. All you need is pineapple juice, frozen pineapple concentrate, vanilla ice cream and frozen pineapples. Combine the ingredients in a blender, and voila – it’s as if you’re back in Adventureland® (minus the corny Jungle Cruise® jokes)!\n\nWalt Disney World® Resort is also known for its iconic scents. Whether it’s the savory popcorn smell along Main Street, U.S.A.® or the chlorine smell found in the indoor boat rides, those magical aromas arouse feelings of nostalgia and joy. My favorite smell can be found at my favorite Walt Disney World® Resort hotel – Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge. It’s hard to pinpoint the exact elements of the scent, but the hotel is filled with a musky, spicy fragrance which harmoniously suits the rustic, elegant décor. When I’m wishing that the view outside of my bedroom window featured giraffes rather than my neighbor’s house, I just light up a candle that transports me to Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge with a scent similar to that found at the hotel. There are numerous candle companies that can bring the familiar scents of YOUR favorite Walt Disney World® Resort lobby, ride, or snack into your own home.\n\nThere are some other fun ways that you can bring Disney into your everyday life. When I’m up bright and early to make FastPass+ selections for my clients, you can find me working at my laptop and drinking coffee from my Donald Duck mug. It brings a smile to my face thinking of when my youngest son met Donald Duck … while the rest of the population in the Central Standard Time Zone is still sleeping soundly in bed!\n\nAnd when I’ve had a rough day, you might find me unwinding with a glass of Chardonnay in my coveted souvenir wine glass from Epcot®. It brings me back to a happier time when I was sampling croissants, macarons, and éclairs at Les Halles Boulangerie-Patisserie in the France pavilion – with a glass of champagne in hand, mais oui!\n\nOf course, the most effective way to combat the post-Disney blues is to start planning your next vacation. As a Key to the World Travel® agent, I am continually enveloped with that special Disney pixie dust when I’m customizing vacation plans for my clients and hearing about their fantastical adventures upon their return.\n\nAs for me, I’ll be seeing Mickey and the Gang real soon!!! Until then, I’ll be recreating that Disney magic with the fun and easy tips outlined above. What are some fun ways that you bring a little pixie dust into your home?\n\n~~"
