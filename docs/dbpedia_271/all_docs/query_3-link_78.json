        "text": "The early stages of an academic career can be exciting, uncertain and daunting, all at the same time. Our top tip is to find out what is needed to progress in your subject area as soon as possible, then decide how to use your time in Oxford to boost your chances of getting more senior, independent roles.\n\nRemember, careers in academia are no longer as linear or predictable as they once were, making it all the more important to think creatively and investigate the diverse opportunities available in universities around the world.\n\nWe suggest you ask yourself some questions to check whether you are working on the basis of assumptions, or evidence:\n\nWill I thrive in academia?\n\nFor all its celebration of freedom, creativity and innovation, academia has a strong work culture in the sense of traditions, expectations and systems for how things are done. Some of this can feel restrictive or repressive, particularly in the early to mid career stage - a fact that is increasingly recognised by initiatives to improve academic research culture (e.g. by Vitae, and the Royal Society). But such change takes time, probably longer than you are prepared to wait to decide your next steps...\n\nSo, try to gauge how happy you think you could be in academic roles in the near future (likely these will be short-term contracts) and if you manage to secure a more permanent position. It can help to separate what it is you love about research from the things you enjoy or struggle with in academia.\n\nDo I know enough about the range of jobs I could do?\n\nSee our academia & higher education career briefing for insight and resources\n\nDo I understand the pathways available in my discipline and in the region where I aim to work?\n\nThe routes to academic progression vary widely between subject areas. Check you have a full picture by talking to others in your department beyond your immediate colleagues, and to researchers in your field at other universities.\n\nSome countries have highly structured systems for academic progression (e.g. Germany, the US), along with an annual hiring process made up of specific steps beginning up to a year before the role is expected to begin. Check your facts via sites listed in the external resources list in our page on Academia and Higher Education.\n\nThe League of European Research Universities (LERU) has produced a set of Maps of academic career paths in nine European countries, including the UK. These outline the typical trajectory for researchers, the kinds of posts available at each career stage, how posts link to funding structures and points of transfer between routes and stages.\n\nAm I fully aware of what people hiring for these roles look for in a candidate?\n\nCheck your sense of what it takes to be competitive and strategic\n\nGet practical tips on thriving in academia from our Early Career Researchers blog - from a top-class application to deciphering the 'subtext' of interview questions...\n\nRead research on the contexts in which some progress while others struggle, for example:\n\nScaling the Ivory Tower: Merit and its limits in academic careers (in USA) (2018)\n\nMid-career academic women’s reluctance to overtly pursue prestige (2018)\n\nThe value given to competencies not made explicit in job descriptions (2014) such as\n\nVision: knowing what your contribution to knowledge will be in 20 years\n\nManagement and Leadership in research teams, funding bids etc.\n\nStrategy: pro-active scanning and managing both personal horizons and those of your research group or department.\n\nBoundary-Spanning: being able to interact across sectors, including through public engagement and impact work.\n\nDo I know how to prepare myself to move forward?\n\nVitae's pages on Pursuing an academic career are a great starting point for tips on how to prepare for an academic application.\n\nSee our pages on writing Academic Applications and Interviews.\n\nFor a North American perspective, see Scholarly Pursuits, a resource produced at Harvard.\n\nAm I prepared for the likely emotional challenges ahead?\n\nCareer development experts often witness the high emotional costs of competing in the academic job market or even anticipating next steps. These can include anxiety, fear, loss of confidence or joy in their work, imposter syndrome, strain on relationships and depression. It is very important to gather a support team around you and practice self-care. See our tips in our page for researchers titled Responding to Change or Setbacks.\n\nGaining independence as a researcher\n\nA framework can help you assess and plan your professional development. We suggest printing out the full version of Vitae's Researcher Development Framework (RDF). Because it shows the wide-ranging skills valued in academia, the RDF can look overwhelming. We recommend that you:\n\nidentify key skills in your academic area on the circle diagram (consult your peers if in doubt);\n\nlook at the table below to see what level of each skill is expected for your next step between completing a PhD and becoming independent;\n\nwork out which skills you are already developing (and have evidence for), and identify any gaps;\n\nplan how to fill gaps in your study/working role or via training; discuss these with your supervisor, PI and/or a Careers Adviser, and plan your time accordingly.\n\nRemember: postdocs and all research staff are encouraged to take dedicated time for professional development of their choosing within their contracted time according to University policy.\n\nYou don’t have to use your annual leave, and we advise planning development time into your year.\n\nNow that the University has signed the Concordat for the Career Development of Researchers, it is anticipated that all fixed term research staff will be entitled to up to 10 days professional development leave per year doing activities of their choosing. This 10 day entitlement already applies to all research staff within the MPLS division, and similar policies are expected in Humanities, Social Sciences and Medical Sciences (the latter currently states up to 5 days). If you are unsure how to approach taking professional development leave with your PI, seek advice from your departmental administrator or HR manager.\n\nIt’s up to you to choose how best to use this time – conferences (where these are going ahead) can be great for networking, but there’s much more out there. See our Boosting Your Employability page for ideas.\n\nPreparing to teach\n\nA track record of teaching experience is required for lectureships and other teaching roles.\n\nFinding opportunities to gain experience at Oxford is easier in some departments than others. Wherever you are, take the initiative: let senior colleagues know your availability and what you can offer.\n\nIt can be frustrating that Oxford’s tutorial approach offers relatively few openings to get involved in teaching undergraduates. Remember that the Oxford system is highly unusual, and that the vast majority of universities look for experience in delivering lectures to large numbers of students and running weekly seminars. You can get gain relevant experience by giving talks, facilitating or contributing to seminars in your department, local schools, youth groups or adult education settings. If you are a postdoc with some experience, consider taking the PGCert qualification, as outlined below.\n\nOxford-trained researchers have secured lectureships having done some part-time teaching in another nearby university. Keep an eye out for short-term or part-time positions, and reach out to your equivalent departments in Warwick, Oxford Brookes, Reading, Bath, one of the London group or even the Open University, to offer a module related to your specialisms.\n\nTeaching qualifications also help. The Oxford Centre for Teaching and Learning offers a range of courses and other forms of support to all DPhils and staff involved in, or keen to start, teaching. Postdocs looking to consolidate existing teaching experience are welcome to apply for a place on the one-year, part-time course to gain a Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert) in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. The programme is designed to fit around work commitments, and actively encourages trainees to look outside Oxford to how teaching is designed and delivered elsewhere, plus ways of teaching inclusively and using technology.\n\nBe aware that senior academics appointing new teaching staff in many UK universities will be thinking about how candidates will help them score well in the next TEF (Teaching Excellence Framework). Read up to make sure you understand what is being measured, and talk to people in departments advertising roles to identify their priorities for retaining or improving teaching quality.\n\nThere are two bits of (fun) research you need to do to explore effectively. The first is to understand yourself, and the second to understand the world of work out there.\n\nTo discover more about yourself (what is important to you, what you enjoy and are good at) try a relevant online PhD careers planning tool (listed below under Looking for Ideas?) or Oxford's new Career Weaver.\n\nAnd to learn about a range of work opportunities available to you, start by looking at what others with similar backgrounds or interests have done ...\n\nRead the profiles of doctoral graduates and former research staff now working in diverse, rewarding roles on research-careers.org. You will be surprised and encouraged to see where people are now using their research skills, and what helped in their transition from academia.\n\nLinkedIn is a vast database stretching across the globe. You can always find at least a dozen people with similar background and interests, and see where they now work, in what role and the steps they took between a PhD or postdoc and their current position.\n\nIf you now have ideas about attractive work areas, browse our relevant sector webpages to learn about different roles, entry points, any prior experience needed and job search strategies.\n\nTalking to people working in any given sector will give you the best flavour of their working world, and can open opportunities to visit, do some work-shadowing or an internship to gain more insight. Make sure you hear about events and opportunities offered by employers keen to recruit from Oxford. Sign up to receive these email invitations via CareerConnect and keep an eye on our termly calendars.\n\nFor further inspiration and an understanding of what counts in career progression: read biographies of people in a range of work sectors, or listen to The Life Scientific, the Reith Lectures and even Desert Island Discs. Many invited guests did a doctorate and/or significant research at some point in their career.\n\nCareers Conference for Researchers\n\nOur annual Careers Conference for Researchers offers those considering career options beyond academia the chance to listen to former researchers, who have moved into a wide range of roles and sectors, speak about their current jobs and their experience of making the transition. Visit the conference page to see the bios of previous speakers and information on the next conference.\n\nResearchers can be excellent entrepreneurs – whether through their original ideas or a love of thinking creatively with others. With so much going on around the University and city to support entrepreneurial activity, keep an eye on Enterprising Oxford to see how you can learn more. Remember, this is for everyone, not just those who may have an idea for a start-up!\n\nThere are many ways to dip your toes into a new work area that cost very little time or energy.\n\nOur top tip: Think strategically and creatively about the overlap between your research and the interests of local or national organisations. Once you have identified these connections, you can mention these when making a speculative approach expressing your enthusiasm to learn more about their work and contribute in practical ways. For example, you might propose assisting them with short projects, designing an internship that would best suit their needs, or work-shadowing.\n\nInternships or part-time projects are a great way to gain insight into a new field, develop your skills and strengthen your professional networks. Many lead to job offers.\n\nEmployers list a range of internships, (non-academic) fellowships and part-time roles on our opportunities page in CareerConnect, the majority of which are open to all researchers - whether staff or students - at Oxford.\n\nIf you are keen to set up a bespoke internship, start with our tips on setting up your own internship or work experience and finding a research internship, plus look out for our regular seminars on Securing an Internship as a Researcher (open to staff and students).\n\nAll research students can apply to all our summer internships and termly micro-internships. Sign up to the internships alert mailing list (via 'Keep Updated' on the internship homepage). You can book an appointment with an internship specialist for advice on your application or how to approach organisations via hello@careers.ox.ac.uk.\n\nIf your DPhil is funded by a research council, ask your department about Doctoral Internships. These excellent schemes let you choose the organisation, cover all costs and give you an extension on your submission date. They are currently offered in Interdisciplinary Biosciences, Humanities and Social Science. Other research councils may offer them soon.\n\nIf you are not funded by a research council, ask your department about Knowledge Exchange or other grants that allow you to propose an experience with an external organisation related to your research or in a sector you might want to work in.\n\nSEO Careers focuses on helping students with disabilities or from under-represented and under-served communities to secure places on some of the most rewarding and competitive internship programmes in the UK. Opportunities for Black and minority ethnic (BAME) students are also available through Rare Recruitment.\n\nNetworks matter. We see this through our work with researchers, and the insight is backed up by an article in FEMS Microbiology Letters about PhD student and postdoc job-searching: “Making meaningful connections and building relationships can be more valuable than other job-related skills… to progress within many professions.” (Blackford, 2018).\n\nWhile you are in Oxford, make the most of your opportunities to build cross-disciplinary links and get actively involved in groups where you can meet people with different experiences and perspectives. Students have ample opportunity to network through colleges, doctoral training groups and student societies. If you’re employed here, join the Oxford Research Staff Society (OxRSS) for a warm welcome, a wide variety of social and professional networking activities, and the opportunity to express your views through departmental voice reps. Most student societies are also open to early career researchers.\n\nSigning up for divisional training events is a great way to meet others outside your direct field of study, exchange ideas about potential career moves, all in addition to strengthening your skills profile.\n\nThe university’s inter-disciplinary research centres, such as The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH), the Oxford Martin School, the Global Priorities Institute or Oxford E-research Centre (and many more) provide excellent opportunities to connect with researchers beyond your discipline.\n\nTap into resources in your department to find out where alumni in your field now work. Ask your departmental administrator how you can get involved in alumni events and/or use the alumni database.\n\nResearch@Oxford\n\nResearch@Oxford is a new online search and discovery tool. It is accessible internally only for researchers, research facilitators, divisional offices, OUI, research students, senior management and others to find information about research activity across the University, and includes staff profiles, publications, grants, professional activities, and more. Research@Oxford delivers a wide range of benefits, and will help:\n\nusers to identify researchers with specific expertise\n\nresearchers to find potential collaborators across the university, through tags and keyword searches (e.g. public policy)\n\nstaff to match researchers with potential funders, collaborators or policymakers, to maximise research and impact opportunities.\n\nResearch@Oxford is accessible internally only at researchers.ox.ac.uk via the Oxford University network (+VPN).\n\nOxford Alumni\n\nMy Oxford Network\n\nA state-of-the-art networking platform exclusively for Oxford alumni, My Oxford Network has over 17,000 alumni willing to help.\n\n150 Regional Alumni Groups\n\nThere are currently more than 350,000 alumni around the world and in excess of 150 regional alumni groups in over 90 countries; so wherever you are in the world you are sure to find Oxonians near you. Some of these groups are run jointly with Cambridge alumni. If you are new to a region, or just passing through, do contact the local group secretary to let them know!\n\nHarness the power of LinkedIn\n\nThe search function on LinkedIn is an excellent way to identify former DPhil students and researchers whose fields of study or interest overlap with yours, see where they now work and what their current roles entail. You can use this technique for any university or institution with which you have a strong affiliation.\n\nHaving identified individuals with interesting career paths, you can then explore their employers’ websites to learn more about what those organisations do, whether you would be a good fit, and any potential opportunities. See our Networking guidance for more tips on how to do this.\n\nRemember: Be specific with your keywords when you search because the LinkedIn database is very large. Include ‘Oxford’ (or other institution), your college or your department to pinpoint people whose training and experience correspond to yours. If you then decide to get in touch with someone whose profile you have seen, having those things in common may also increase the likelihood that you receive a response.\n\nTake heart - you're doing the right thing in asking yourself the question 'Is an academic career path really the best for me?' It is often hard to see the many roles where researchers add value and find satisfaction when you're living in Oxford and surrounded by academics!\n\nYet the vast majority of researchers will review their career ambitions during their DPhil or research contract, ready to move into other sectors.\n\nTo begin reviewing your options, choose a relevant free online career exploration and planning tool. We recommend that you start with one of the tools mentioned below.\n\nImaginePhD is designed for PhD students and postdoctoral scholars in the humanities and social sciences, yet those from other disciplines can use this tool. It will help you to:\n\nassess your career-related skills, interests, and values\n\nexplore 16 job families\n\naccess and save links to extensive information about job families in one convenient place\n\nidentify skills gaps related to different career paths of interest\n\nmap out next steps for career and professional development success.\n\nMyIDP (Individual Development Plan) is designed for science graduate students and postdocs. It will help you identify career goals that are right for you and develop a step-by-step plan to reach them. MyIDP is a four-step process which includes:\n\nExercises to help you examine your skills, interests and values\n\nA list of 20 scientific career paths with a prediction of which best fit your skills and interests\n\nA tool for setting strategic goals, with optional reminders to keep you on track\n\nArticles and resources to guide you through the process\n\nCareer Weaver is a web-based application developed by the Careers Service to help you identify, take ownership of and clearly articulate\n\nwhat you love\n\nwhat you are good at\n\nwhy you do it.\n\nIt is designed for anyone, at any stage of study or work, to take a step back and think about what matters most at this point in life. You can use the results to inform your Career Planning or bring them to an appointment with a Careers Adviser.\n\nIf you're looking for data on researcher employment, stories from researchers on their career journeys or a planning tool that maps academic research training onto career development, go to the careers section of the Vitae website.\n\nWe think these tools are great. But remember - introspection can only get you so far. It is then time to start talking to people and trying out different kinds of work, whether through a placement, internship volunteering, or simply asking someone if you can work-shadow them for a few hours. For practical steps towards these, read the section above \"Exploring beyond academia'.\n\nIf you would like to discuss any of the above, please make an appointment with a Careers Adviser, several of whom have postdoctoral experience in academia and other sectors.\n\nFor help with setting up a CareerConnect account or any other matter related to appointments, contact the Careers Service Reception team on hello@careers.ox.ac.uk or at 01865 274646."
