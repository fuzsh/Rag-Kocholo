        "text": "The Crown is preparing to release its final six episodes, and on Tuesday Netflix teased nine photos from the Emmy-winning historical drama’s last hurrah.\n\nThe first look photos for the second half of season six — which will mark the end of the hit royal drama — show a grown-up Prince William and Prince Harry following the death of their mother Princess Diana (played by Elizabeth Debicki), and introduces Meg Bellamy as the highly anticipated Kate Middleton. One of the photos is of Kate’s famous see-through dress, which marks the moment she first caught William’s eye when he was in the audience at her 2002 University of St. Andrews charity fashion show.\n\nThe first half of the final season consisted of four episodes (which are now streaming) and focused on Diana’s final months, including her overlooked relationship with Dodi Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) and their last moments together before their fatal 1997 car crash in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris. The scene is replicated in episode three, “Dis-Moi Oui.”\n\nRespectively, William and Harry, who were played by Rufus Kampa and Fflyn Edwards in part one, are now played by Ed McVey and Luther Ford in part two, which consists of six episodes. The second half of the season releases Dec. 14.\n\nThe logline reads: “Prince William (McVey) tries to integrate back into life at Eton in the wake of his mother’s death as the monarchy has to ride the wave of public opinion. As she reaches her Golden Jubilee, the Queen (Imelda Staunton) reflects on the future of the monarchy with the marriage of Charles (Dominic West) and Camilla (Olivia Williams) and the beginnings of a new Royal fairytale in William and Kate (Bellamy).”\n\nPart one also spent time on Charles (West) and Camilla’s (Williams) relationship, as Charles finally won over some support from the Queen. Staunton took over the role of Queen Elizabeth II in season five and finishes out the show as it moves into the early 2000s.\n\nIn its first three days on Netflix, part one amassed 36.9 million hours viewed, according to the streamer. It remained first on Netflix’s series ranking for its premiere week, however the viewership was not as large as seasons prior, which were dropped all at once.\n\nWhile part one zeroed in on the events leading up to Diana’s death, part two will be more expansive and will span several years, from Prince William’s return to Eton after his mother’s death to Queen Elizabeth’s Golden Jubilee in 2002 to the marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005 and onto the early stages of William’s relationship with future wife Kate Middleton.\n\nThe rest of the ensemble returns, including Jonathan Pryce as Prince Philip, Lesley Manville as Princess Margaret, Claudia Harrison as Princess Anne and Bertie Carvel as Tony Blair."
