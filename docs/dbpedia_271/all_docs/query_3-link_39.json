        "text": "Oxford at a glance\n\nThere are more than 26,000 students at Oxford, including 12,470 undergraduates and 13,920 postgraduates.\n\nOxford has one of the lowest drop-out rates in the UK: figures published for 2019/20 academic year of entry by the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that only 0.9% of Oxford students dropped out, compared with a UK average of 5.3%.\n\n93% of Oxford undergraduates and 95% of Oxford postgraduate leavers in 2020-2021 were in high-skilled employment or further study 15 months after leaving (Russell Group is 88% and 90% respectively). Median salaries are £32K and £35K respectively.\n\nEvery year more than 15,000 students enrol on courses at the Department for Continuing Education, making Oxford University one of the largest providers of continuing education in the UK.\n\nThe University of Oxford contributes around £15.7 billion to the UK economy, and supports more than 28,000 full time jobs. £611 million is generated by the University’s contribution to tourism, and £6 billion from the impact generated by the spending of the University and its colleges (2018/19). Find out more here.\n\nUndergraduate admissions and access\n\nEntry to undergraduate courses at Oxford continues to be very competitive: there are usually only around 3,300 places, and over 23,000 people applied to start in 2023.\n\nThat means Oxford receives, on average, around seven applications for each available place.\n\nThe majority of Oxford’s UK undergraduates come from state schools. Over 67% of UK students admitted in 2023 were from the state sector.\n\nThe University conducts over 20,000 interviews with around 10,000 applicants over the two-week interview period in December.\n\nOxford, through its outreach work, reaches more than 75% of UK schools with post-16 provision - that's almost every school that fields candidates capable of making a competitive application to Oxford.\n\nEvery year, more than 1,000 year-12 state school students from across the UK participate in Oxford’s free online programme UNIQ, aimed at helping students underrepresented at Oxford find out what it’s like to study here and make competitive applications to the University. Many participants will also attend a residential in Oxford.\n\nSince its launch in 2010, UNIQ has supported over 14,500 participants and during the last five years (2018-2022) UNIQ participants, from disadvantaged backgrounds and state schools, were more likely to receive an offer to study at Oxford (30% all UNIQ applicants versus 20% all other UK applicants).\n\nIn 2023, 35 UK state school students who have experienced severe personal disadvantage or disruption during their education received offers for the first Astrophoria Foundation Year – a fully funded, supportive and academically challenging one-year course with the opportunity to progress onto their chosen undergraduate degree at Oxford without the need to reapply.\n\nOur bridging programme Opportunity Oxford supports around 200 talented UK offer-holders every year from the least advantaged socio-economic backgrounds who will benefit from additional academic support to transition successfully from school to Oxford. Several hundred more offer holders are invited to participate in the online component.\n\nFinancial support for undergraduates\n\nOxford offers one of the most generous financial support packages for UK undergraduates from the lowest-income backgrounds.\n\nOxford offers non-repayable bursaries of up to £5,800 p.a. to eligible UK resident students as part of its Crankstart Scholarship programme.\n\nFor students who are not eligible for, or do not take up, a Crankstart Scholarship, Oxford Bursaries of between £4,000 and £1,000 p.a. are provided to eligible undergraduates from the lowest income families every year.\n\nEligible UK students who are care-experienced or estranged (studying without family support) can also apply for an additional non-repayable annual bursary of up to £3,000.\n\nOxford centrally spends more than £8.5 million on financial support to undergraduates from lower-income households annually.\n\nPostgraduate admissions and support\n\nGraduate students make up around 50% of the total student body at Oxford.\n\n450 postgraduate courses received applications for year of entry 2022/23 (including part-time variants).\n\nFor 2022/23 entry, over 37,500 applications were received for some 6,056 postgraduate places.\n\nMore than 34,000 applications were for full-time courses and 3,683 for part-time study.\n\nFor the 2023/24 academic year, the University expects to be able to offer around 1,000 full or partial graduate scholarships for new students.\n\nOxford international\n\nInternational students make up 46% of our total student body - more than 12,000 students - including 23% of undergraduates and 65% of graduate students.\n\nStudents come to Oxford from more than 160 countries and territories. The largest groups of international students come from the USA, China, Germany, Canada, India, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Italy, France, and Netherlands.\n\nAbove data correct as of 1 December 2022.\n\nOxford University Press (OUP) is the largest and most successful university press in the world. It has offices in more than 50 countries and publishes works in some 100 languages.\n\nEvery year millions of students use OUP's English Language Teaching materials to learn English.\n\nOxford research\n\nThe Research Excellence Framework (REF) assesses the quality of research in UK Higher Education Institutions. When the UK Funding Bodies published the outcomes of REF 2021 in May 2022, results showed Oxford’s submission had the highest volume of world-leading research¹. Highlights of the submission can be found on the Oxford REF 2021 webpages.\n\nOxford's research activity involves more than 2,000 academic staff, more than 5,900 research, teaching and research support staff, and more than 7,000 graduate research students (figures as at 31 July 2022).\n\nAt postgraduate level, 54% of students at Oxford are reading for degrees by research.\n\nOxford’s total research income is consistently the highest of any UK university. In 2021/22 the University earned £711.4 million in external research funding. When the block grant for research from Research England is added, the University’s research income totals £865.7 million.\n\nOxford University through Oxford University Innovation (OUI) is the UK leader in generating spinout companies, creating ten for the academic year 2021-2022, plus five more startups and social ventures. Overall, OUI has created over 300 companies, more than any other UK institution.\n\nOUI is also the most prolific university filer of patents in the UK, with close to 5,000 under management, and receives more income from intellectual property than UK peers.\n\nDuring the academic year ending July 2022, OUI completed 1,157 commercial deals, signed 531 academic consultancy deals, and returned £13.2 million to researchers and the University.\n\nOxfordshire is one of Europe’s leading centres of enterprise and innovation, with particular strengths in biosciences and new technologies, and many of the region’s high-tech companies have links with the University.\n\n(¹Largest volume of world-leading research is calculated from the sum of (overall %4* x submitted FTE) across all submissions.)\n\nOxford awards and rankings\n\nOxford was ranked first in the world in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 - a record eight consecutive years.\n\nIn the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings by subject for 2024, Oxford was, for the 13th year running, ranked first in the world for Clinical, Pre-Clinical and Health subjects.
