        "text": "Continuing our Petula Clark series with a fourth volume (see JASCD457, JASBOX25-4 and JASBOX33-4), we present you with the opportunity to have a Tête à tête and a Rendez-vous with Petula, the lady whose first name alone is familiar around the globe. These three French albums from 1961 and 1962 remain collectable on vinyl today.\n\nFeatured are her French hits, 'Marin (Sailor)', 'Garde Moi La Derniere Danse (Save The Last Dance For Me)', 'La Joie D'Aimer (theme from the film 'The Unforgiven')', 'Chariot (I Will Follow Him)', 'Les Beaux Jours (Ramblin' Rose)', 'Cœur Blessé (Torture)' and, in stereo, 'Roméo', 'A London' and 'Ya Ya Twist'. The album Rendez-vous was originally issued in both mono and stereo, and the original rare stereo mix - previously unissued on CD - is featured here.\n\nRounding off the package, there are over a dozen bonus tracks in the shape of a contemporary interview with Petula from 1962, French covers of her compositions (including one by Richard Anthony which she never recorded), the mono 'A Christmas Carol' EP and Petula's New Year greetings for 1961.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
