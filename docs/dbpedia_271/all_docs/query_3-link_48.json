        "text": "I really agree with the friends below, this is certainly one of the best OUIs. I had the opportunity to try this one, hôtel ville, riviere bleue and l'experience, and of all the ones mentioned, this one was the one I found most delicious and different. I can really understand the comparisons with perfumes such as pegasus and bvlgari black, it's a smoky, dense and slightly sweet perfume that sometimes seems a little almondy, giving it that air of seriousness and sophistication present in those mentioned above.\n\nAs for its scent, I can feel the aniseed very much present, with that very sweet and open side, but along with it comes a very smoky touch, full of woody notes. These woods are a bit like sandalwood, guaiac and rosewood, less opulent woods, much more pleasant. Although not listed, I also feel a leveraged and subtly rubbery touch, as if there were cashmeran and lavender in the composition.\n\nI thought the performance of this perfume was very good, it stayed on my skin for around 10 hours and had a moderate/strong projection for around 2 hours after application. While writing this review I noticed that I really like perfumer Olivier Cresp, here he has created something quite out of the curve, in fact this perfume here seems to be very imported, the quality of it is well above what I imagined for being a brand linked to Boticário, so I highly recommend that you get to know this perfume, test it and draw your conclusions, I'm sure this one will not disappoint.\n\nDefinitely the best men's OUI so far. What an addictive scent! It's comfortable, soft, but at the same time sexy and mysterious. I feel an explosive opening of aniseed with an incensey but fresh touch, perhaps some spice. Then the perfume becomes softer and sweeter, slightly woody. And finally, it dries down quite creamy, a delicious incensed vanilla. There's something about it that reminds me of sugared almonds too. I found it quite similar to my late Au Masculin, which is now a water of chuchu, but without that alcoholic touch of rum. this one from OUI manages to be superior in terms of quality of construction/raw materials and performance. Average longevity and an intimate but ever-present projection, just the way I love it. Women who like a sweet woody scent and want to get away from the beaten florals will like this one.\n\nWhat a curious and interesting creation! 🤔 Despite the limitations of knowing from the sample, you can tell it's not just any fragrance. The ingredients are clearly a few steps above Boticário's standard range (even above The Blend range)\n\nIts vibe is unlike any other perfume I know. When you sniff it, it seems to be citrus, but it isn't; then it seems to be floral, but it isn't either; it seems woody, but it isn't either. And then comes this smoky nuance, which is not at all reminiscent of incense or anything like that. It smells like smoke (don't ask me how that's possible 😂).\n\nIt's a scent that I imagine perfumes like Dior, Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana and so on smell like.\n\nThe title, by the way, does justice to the scent. It's a mystery because it's a bit different, but it's nothing out of this world. It's just good.\n\nOh, and I'd say it's a bit shareable. Of course, not for all women. Perhaps those with a more gothic style will like it.\n\nThe brand's first truly \"Unique\" men's product. And that's high praise indeed. An intriguing, different and addictive perfume. I bought a 4 ml sample with a spray bottle and it's already finished. It's going to become a bottle. I have Alien Man and I'm sure anyone who likes Alien will like this one too. They're different but very similar in their different, plastic, smoky, sweet woody vibe. Another perfume with an air of novelty is La Villete 470, also by Olivier Cresp. Most of the rest are copies of existing perfumes, even within the O Boticário group itself.\n\nI like all the brand's previous creations, but despite their remarkable quality, they didn't quite live up to the name \"Original Unique Individuel\", which seems to have been remedied in this new Royal line. Like its female counterpart, Mystère Royal is thought-provoking, surprising and out of the box, in true niche style. Olivier Cresp didn't mess around, transforming the innocent delicacy of the lily into something punk and striking. I get smoky nuances reminiscent of fuel, but nothing reminiscent of the smoke of Aventhus-type fragrances or the gasoline aspect of Fahrenheit. It reminded me of the smell of overheated electrical wiring, an effect I find more refined, especially as it harmonizes with the sweet touches of lily and anise.\n\nI agree with the comparisons. The rubbery character reminds me of Bvlgari Black and Midnight in Paris, but the fragrance has its own personality: a lily floral that has been masculinized to the tenth power with a lot of creativity. Even with high doses of wood and smoky traces, it retains its sophistication and doesn't sound like a bodyshop or a lumberyard. It seemed modern and cool, without the aristocratic and medieval vibe suggested in the description. May this be the start of a promising phase."
