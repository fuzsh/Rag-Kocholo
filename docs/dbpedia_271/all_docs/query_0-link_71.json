Oakley attracted an ensemble of “the best of the best” Maritime players: Wayne Nicholson and Doug MacKay (ex-Horse); 17 year-old bassist Bruce Dixon, from the band Sandy Road and keyboardist John Lee. In very little time The Oakley Band firmly established itself as the hardest rocking group in the area performing southern rock & blues through a blend of original material and classic covers tunes. Lee left the band in 1977 and was replaced by ex-Redeye member Bill McCauley. With Oakley and Nicholson the two principle writers in the band, they set about writing and recording a self-titled debut in 1980. The album shipped gold (50,000 copies). Three singles were extracted from the album for radio – “Ride ‘Em Cowboy”, “Stickin’ With You”, and “She’s Gone”. “She’s Gone” also appeared on the 1982 Eastern Alliance along with the “I Almost Call Your Name.” The Oakley Band worked continuously touring across the country and playing the summer festival circuit. With a reputation for being bad boys-working hard and playing hard, they shared stages with such heavyweights as The Doobie Brothers, Blue Rodeo and April Wine. When Dixon moved on to other opportunities, former Soma member Donnie Morris came on board. A second guitarist, Dave Gallant, was added in 1981. Despite their strong following the band broke up in 1982. Since then Ritchie Oakley has partnered with Sam Moon to form Sam Moon/Ritchie Oakley Power Unit – still playing occasional gigs together to this day. Oakley also has a long term stint with popular East Coast Country band Fandango. In 1995 Oakley was honoured by the Nova Scotia Country Music Association as both “Songwriter of the Year” and “Instrumentalist Of The Year”. The Music Industry Association of Nova Scotia named him ‘Producer of the Year” in 1998. He is currently under contract in the role of Music Director for John Curtis Sampson, ECMA 2000 winner for “Best New Artist” and Country Artist of the Year.” After 1982 Wayne Nicholson joined the New Glasgow band Granfalloon and recorded the single, “Cheater” which became a local hit. After a stint in Calgary, he returned to Halifax and launched his solo career. After releasing his first project, he signed with Loggerhead records and has recorded a total of 3 CD’s, which garnered multiple ECMA nominations. His most recent success has been producing the critically acclaimed debut by The Carson Downey Band. Dixon and McCauley went on to work with Cape Breton’s Rita MacNeil. Dixon is currently touring with Roch Voisine. He is sought after for music director positions and is currently working with Ian Janes on his next project. Doug MacKay has played with Sam Moon, Dutch Mason, Sharon B., and most recently, with Joe Murphy and The Water Street Blues Band; Gallant played with Cheryl Lescom for several years and pursues another passion – guitar repair; Morris is the long time bassist for country artist Louisa Manuel. Oakley, Nicholson, MacKay, Dixon, McCauley and Gallant reunited on three occasions since officially disbanding; Sadly, Ritchie Oakley died unexpectedly April 6, 2013; Donnie Morris died March 9, 2019. with notes from Anne Oakley, Jim Rice, and Peter Crowe.\n\nSingles\n\n1980 Ride ‘Em Cowboy/Guitar Man (Nova) NS-0061\n\n1980 Stickin’ With You/Don’t Kick a Man (Nova) NS-0062\n\n1982 She’s Gone/I Almost Call Your Name (Nova) NS-063\n\nAlbums\n\n1980 Oakley (Nova) N689-006\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1982 “I Almost Call Your Name” and “She’s Gone” on ‘Eastern Alliance’ (CBS) ART-100\n\nOATMAN, Don\n\nBorn: Donald Ross Oatman in Tillsonburg, Ontario in 1940.\n\nBy the age of eight Don Oatman he was singing to the accompaniment of his mother on the organ at the local United Church in Springford, Ontario. He would sing at nine different churches on various Sundays until he was 13 years old.\n\nHe took a serious interest in music at the age of fourteen, at which time he took up the trumpet. He was soon playing in the school orchestra. He also played in the Annandale High School Brass Band, as well as the Tillsonburg Brass Band. Oatman loved to sing, and he became the lead singer of The Rhythm Rockers. At the age of 18 he got his pilot’s license at the Tillsonburg Airport. Directly out of high school worked for the Royal Bank. From 1962 to 1965 he worked for LaVerne Haley Appliances. In 1964 he bought a piece of land and built a restaurant that also featured a gas bar. In 1971, Oatman became the lead singer of The Rhythmaires. They became well established and were booked solid with weekend dates at clubs, weddings and receptions including shows at the Summer Gardens in Port Dover, and the Stork Club in Port Stanley. In January 1976 the band changed its name to Impact featuring Brian Craig (drums), Kris Jackucinskas (guitar), Tony Bee (organ), and Larry Schofield (keyboards). In February of 1976, Oatman talked to Thunderbird Records owner Jim Allison his an original song called “The Love I Give To You.” The song convinced Allison to sign Oatman to a record deal. Oatman’s debut album, ‘Something Old – Something New’ was recorded at Thunder Sound Studio in May 1976 and in the summer. The single “The Love I Give To You” hit #23 at CFCL in Timmins. The third single, “Just For You,” went #1 in some radio markets. Oatman was booked for a TV appearance by musician Fred McKenna on the ‘George Hamilton IV Show’ for early December of 1977, with McKenna’s unexpected death in November 1977, the appearance was cancelled. Thunderbird Records soon went bankrupt, and Oatman carried on performing live with his band Impact. In 1988, he was involved in creating an aviation museum in Dunnville. He would retire from music and his band Impact at the end of the year. In 1992, Oatman began working at Johnson Controls and worked there until 2005. In 1998, he released his second album. The Grand Opening of the No. 6 RCAF Dunnville Museum finally occurred on July 5, 2003. Don Oatman became its president. In 2008, he released his third album called ‘Christmas With Don Oatman.’ Oatman was also an Auxiliary Sergeant with the Ontario Provincial Police for sixteen years. with noets from Thom Ryerson.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 The Love I Give To You/Feelings (Thunderbird) TBR-1030\n\n1976 Easy Life/Walk Hand In Hand (Thunderbird) TBR-1031\n\n1977 Just For You/Green Green Grass Of Home (Thunderbird) TBR-1032\n\nAlbums\n\n1976 Something Old – Something New (Thunderbird) TBR-1019\n\n1992 Don Oatman (Don Oatman)\n\n2008 Christmas With Don Oatman (Don Oatman)\n\n2021 Something Old – Something New [DigiFile reissue] (Mouton) 194021-DIG\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2019 “The Love I Give To You,” and “Easy Life” on ‘Thunderbird Recording – The Singles 1975 – 1978: The A Sides’ (Germanicus) 20191-CD\n\n2019 “Just For You,” “Walk Hand In Hand,” and “Green Green Grass Of Home” on ‘Thunderbird Recording – The Singles 1975 – 1978: The B Sides’ (Germanicus) 20192-CD\n\nOBERON [see MANCHILD]\n\nO’BRIEN, Mel\n\nBassist Mel O’Brien attended St. Michael’s Choir School in Toronto, Ontario and studied at the Royal Conservatory of Music, Toronto, receiving certificates in Music Theory and Voice. He then obtained an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto. He performed in The Proverbs with future jazz great Bill King before playing with The Five D out of Ottawa briefly and then with Bill Amesbury’s The Five Shy who released two singles on Columbia in 1968. O’Brien would then replace Denny Gerrard in The Paupers near the end of that band’s run. When Bill Amesbury obtained a contract with Casablanca Records in 1974, Amesbury hired O’Brien and drummer Wally Cameron as sidemen. O’Brien played with Amesbury for over two years, during which time he played the bass solo on the million-seller, “Virginia (Touch Me Like You Do)” along with other songs on Amesbury’s debut album. After his stint with Amesbury, O’Brien was then a part of a revamped version of Chester (who initially had international success with “Make My Life A Little Bit Brighter” in 1973) for their two Quality Records singles. He was then hired by CAM NY to play bass for Déjà Vu, and appeared on their second album ‘Get It Up For Love’ in 1977. During this period he also backed up Chuck Berry on the three occasions Berry performed in Toronto in the ‘70s. In 1981 he wrote and performed on a single, “Hard-Luck Taxi Driver,” on T.O. Records and the song was a hit amongst the taxi drivers of Toronto, selling over two-thousand copies independently. O’Brien left the music business temporarily in the ‘80s due to tinnitus. After a few years the condition disappeared and he resumed playing. In recent years he was part of the house band at Connollys of Leap, one of the most famous live music venues in Ireland. He also played frequently with ex-Band of Gypsies member Noel Redding, as well as the band Watercress, Ursula Burns, and members of the Little River Band. He appeared on two Irish albums in 2001 and has written a book about the Toronto music scene called, ‘Sex & Drugs & Rock & Death’. With notes from Mel O’Brien.

For several years Brown led a group called Leather And Lace, a very successful club band that toured extensively and featured vocalists Janice Morgan and Marilyn Holland, Barry Edwards (guitar) and Bill Turnbull (drums). In early 1970, Edwards was replaced by George Attrill and bassist Jim Chapman was added to the group. In the summer of 1970 Brown decided to take the band in a new direction so Holland, Attrill, Turnbull and Chapman left the group. With the addition of Chuck Slater and Jeff Jones (ex-The Rush) they were quickly signed to ARC Records after only a few months of rehearsals. Ocean’s first single was “Put Your Hand In the Hand” which was written for Anne Murray by Gene MacLellan (who had also given her the monster smash “Snowbird”). The song was buried on one of Murray’s albums and it wasn’t until Ocean sold two million copies did Capitol Records and Anne Murray kick themselves. When the song began to chart in 1971 the group was still playing high school dances in the Toronto area. The record eventually hit No.2 in the US and No.1 in Canada and the band was able to successfully tour the world. Several songs followed and helped maintain the band’s momentum as they did television appearances and wrote material for their follow-up. They were never able to duplicate their success south of the border despite have another sizable hit in Canada with “One More Chance” in 1972. Many member changes occurred and the band was never able to fully reconcile their religious beliefs with their monetary gains and obligations. Ultimately they were ripped off and finally succumbed in 1975; Because of Ocean’s harrowing business experiences, Brown became adept at the business side of the music industry and lobbied to change legislation that would protect Canadian artists from signing contracts without a lawyer. Brown would also play in bands right through the 1990’s with the likes of Second Line Fever and Now And Then (two decidedly different musical styled acts featuring the same band members); Morgan also worked with other acts like Network until retiring from music in 1986. She now lives in Lindsay, Ontario; Jones would go on to continued fame with stints in Red Rider, Ronnie Hawkins Band, Infidels, and The Carpet Frogs as well as having a solo career; Tamblyn would do a stint for one album with Natural Gas, then retired from music; Slater committed suicide; Layton would join The Bells and then re-connect with Jones in a new band with Bernie LaBarge and Brian “Too Loud” MacLeod called Stingaree. When MacLeod left to join Chilliwack in Vancouver, Layton went with him. Layton would end up in a country band called Ambush in the 1990s; Cardinal moved to Nanaimo, British Columbia he plays more casual gigs, repairs speakers and helps build PA systems for the pleasure of better sound; Greg Brown passed away December 13, 2022. with notes from Jeff Jones, Skip Layton, Phillip David and Jim Chapman.

O’Connor’s musical career started with his interest in drums, but after trading another kid a tuna sandwich in exchange for guitar lessons he developed a love for rock music. As a teen in the 1960s he was first a member of the group The Synics, and then later the Spasstiks who would have commercial success after changing their name to Cat in 1968. “Doin’ The Best We Can” was their first single on Apex and helped them land impressive opening slots for the likes of The Guess Who, Lighthouse, Neil Diamond and Janis Joplin. The group was soon discovered by Jack Richardson and was signed to a development deal with Richardson’s Nimbus 9 Productions which, in turn, led to a record deal with RCA in New York. The first single, “Light of Love”, failed to make any noise, but the next – “We’re All In This Together” – featuring Richardson’s fledgling engineer, Bob Ezrin on keyboards, helped the band land some chart action. A Festival Express train that took entertainers across Canada from town to town took Cat on tour in 1970 which followed hot on the heels of the single and self-titled debut album. Soon creative differences would eat away at the members and they recorded briefly as Fast Eddie before finally calling it quits in 1972. O’Connor’s next band was as replacement guitarist/vocalist in the self-proclaimed first tribute band to the Beatles called Liverpool in the Fall of 1976. O’Connor was with them for their final two singles of original material on Taurus Records, but the label soon experienced financial troubles and Liverpool found itself without a home. O’Connor briefly formed his own band called Kid Rainbow before re-forming with members of Liverpool as Aerial. Ray Danniels re-signed the band to his next label Anthem Records. The band’s debut album, “In The Middle of the Night” was released in 1978 and featured the radio hit “Easy Love” written by O’Connor. Friction in the band over getting more representation for his songs caused O’Connor to pursue a solo career and in 1979 he was signed to a development deal with Capitol Records in the US under the moniker GARY O’. Over the next two years he worked honing his songwriting chops and spent time on the executive board of the Toronto Musicians’ Association. In early 1981 his self-titled debut album was released on Capitol and featured several radio hits including “All the Young Heroes”, a cover of the Hollies’ “Pay You Back With Interest” and “I Believe In You” which was originally released by Cat back in 1968 as the B-side to “Doin’ The Best I Can”. With manager Stephen Glass at the helm, O’Connor moved to RCA Records for his sophomore LP ‘Strange Behaviour’ in 1984. The record was completely performed by O’Connor with the help of some friends like Klaatu’s Dee Long at ESP Studios and engineer Brian Bell. This album also produced three singles: “Get It While You Can”, “Call of the Wild” and the Top40 single/video “Shades of ’45”. It wasn’t long before other artists came knocking looking for O’Connor’s songwriting talents. The list includes .38 Special (“One Time For Old Times”, “Back Where You Belong”, “Just A Little Love”), Molly Hatchet (“What’s It Gonna Take”), and Eddie Money (“Maybe Tomorrow”). O’Connor also wrote two movie themes: “Pretty Boy” featured in ‘Thunder Alley’ and performed Leif Garrett, and “Jungle Out There” from ‘Zoo Gang’. In recent years O’Connor has been writing material in Nashville for Lace and Tia McGraff, and for Canadians such as Kim Stockwood, Jamie Warren, Beverly Mahood and Chris Aris. with notes from Gary O’Connor and Rick Pearson.

Because the band’s focus was on complex vocal harmony, eight singers allowed them the luxury of doing cover versions of complex Beach Boys, CSNY, and Queen material. Their first professional gigs were at the Chaudiere Club in Aylmer, Québec, where they regularly entertained members of Satan’s Choice. The band’s name achieved a metamorphosis during a gig at The Rock Club in Woodstock, Ontario when their name appeared as ‘Octavian’ on the marquee. Six years of touring and beating a path around Ontario and Québec finally landed them a deal with MCA Records in Toronto. Their 1974 debut single, “Good Feeling (To Know)” made the Top10 in many major markets in Canada (Ottawa, Vancouver, Winnipeg), was No. 8 in the Steed Report’s Top100 for the year and received a ‘Pick Of The Week’ in Billboard Magazine in the US, but failed to climb the Billboard chart. 1975 saw the release of their only album, ‘Simple Kinda People’, and launched two other singles, “Round and Round” and another single “Hold Me, Touch Me” which did slightly better but still didn’t put the band firmly on the music map. They sold out large stadium shows all over the country including Ontario Place and Ottawa’s Central Canada Exhibition. Shortly after their cross-Canada tour opening shows for Tanya Tucker (1977) in support of their single “Can’t Stop Myself From Loving You” , Bob Deeks replaced both Bill Gauvreau (guitar) & Darryl Alguire (vocals). After their deal with MCA expired, and when it seemed no other label would sign them, the band moved to Toronto and went on to form Chain Reaction; Lead singer John Pulkkinen changed his name to John Alexander and went to work for MCA Records. He signed Alanis Morissette to the label in the early ’90s as a dance artist and later brought her to the attention of producer Glen Ballard to make the multi-million selling ‘Jagged Little Pill’. Alexander is the Senior Vice President of Membership for ASCAP in the United States; Lessard is now a broker; Mike Hicks is partner in HyperActive Productions, a video production house in Ottawa; Bob Deeks has done session work and helped develop other artists in his home recording studio. He is a professor at Algonquin College (Ottawa); Kirk Dorrow and Gerry Sampson passed away after leaving the band; Warren Barbour and Bill Gauvreau have been working since 2011 on a new Octavian project that will combine unreleased and new material; John Alexander passed away suddenly after a short illness on August 3, 2023. with notes from Michael Hicks, Roy Morrison, Ralph Alfonso, Lisa Millar and Bob Deeks.

With only $3,000 between the four of them, they decided to record their self-titled debut first album in 1972 and was released on Pressage Records in 1973. Their interpretation of Québec Progressive Rock brings them critical and commercial success and led to opening slots on tour with British band King Crimson. Two more albums followed in quick succession – ‘Les nouvelles terres’ (1974) and ‘Survivance’ (1975) – which led to Octobre’s appearance at la Fête Nationale du Québec (St. Jean Baptiste Day) on a bill with Harmonium, Beau Dommage, Ginette Reno and Gilles Vigneault.Two albums followed on CBS Records and in 1979 Octobre brought in fifth member Gerry Leduc as saxophonist for the 1980 album release ‘Clandestins’ (on Kébec-Discs). By 1982 the band members were moving into more solo oriented projects and they decided to fold the band. The group has reunited twice – at the Montreal International Jazz Festival in 1989 and the Festival d’été de Québec in 1996 to promote the launch of Audiogram Records’ ‘best of’ package ‘1972-1989’; Flynn has released four solo albums. In 2005 and 2006 he played the role of Abraham Van Helsing in the musical ‘Dracula’ alongside Bruno Pelletier, Daniel Boucher, Sylvain Cossette and Andrée Watters; Dorais released the album ‘Radioactive’ in collaboration with Marc Desjardins on CBS Records in 1986 with contributions by Octobre’s Peter Flynn (keyboards) and Marc Gabriel (vocals). He is now working in the computer programming business; Légaré has played with many artists such as Lhasa De Sela, Paul Piché, Edgar Bori and is part of Flybin Band with Rick Haworth (guitar), Sylvain Key (drums) and Jean-Sébastien Fournier (keyboards) as Michel Rivard’s studio and touring band; Hébert still shows up regularly at Québec galas and on TV.

The members of The Odds met in the Vancouver music scene, playing in various bands. Northey and Drake (originally from California) met through a battle of the bands contest and Drake’s act, 20th Century, won. Paul Brennan was a drinking buddy of Northey’s. When Drake and Elliot later hooked up with Brennan, he suggested a worthy fourth member would be Northey and they became Dawn Patrol – a ’60’s and ’70’s cover band. They did this 4 nights a week waiting for that big break to come for their alter egos on weekends, The Odds. Disappointed with the reaction from the Vancouver music scene, the band relocated to Los Angeles where they were spotted by legendary rocker Warren Zevon who adopted them as his band for one tour and an album and also helped them secure a record deal with Zoo/BMG. The Odds first came to the public’s attention through the song “Wendy Under The Stars” from their debut album ‘Neopolitan’. Some controversy erupted as the chorus’s preceding line contains the ‘f’ word, but the band anticipated such resistance at radio and video by substituting the line ‘made love to’ in the offending areas of the song. Momentum grew after the second release, ‘Bedbugs’, in 1993 with its two hit singles “It Falls Apart” and “Heterosexual Man” which, despite being banned or ignored by every radio station in Canada, made for one of the funniest Canadian videos of all time: The Odds in drag with guest ‘actors’ Kids In The Hall (who were dressed, not so ironically, in ‘heterosexual’ roles). Their similarity in style to American Matthew Sweet led to an opening slot on Sweet’s North American tour. Drummer Brennan left in 1994 during the making of ‘Good Weird Feeling’ and has since toured with Mae Moore. Brennan would make one final appearance with Northey and Elliot on the Taste Of Joy album ‘Trigger Fables’ in 1995. His replacement was Pat Steward (Bryan Adams) who had previously played with Doug Elliot in Rubber Biscuit. It was at this point that the band switched from Zoo/BMG to Warner Music. ‘Good Weird Feeling’ became the band’s breakout album with the hits “Truth Untold” and “Eat My Brain” – the latter used in the Steven Drake produced soundtrack of Kids In The Hall’s ‘Brain Candy’ movie. The song’s humorous video featured a chase sequence starring members of TPOH and Junkhouse. The Odds would also appear as the backing musicians on two Bruce McCulloch tunes also in the movie – “Some Days It’s Dark” and “Happiness Pie”. Despite this homegrown success, the band were never able to headline their own tour and were instead relegated to double bills with the likes of 54.40 and The Killjoys. The association to 54.40 afforded Steven Drake the opportunity to produce that band’s ‘Trusted By Millions’, followed by mixing work for The Tragically Hip on their ‘Trouble In The Henhouse’ CD. 1996’s ‘Nest’ continued in the band’s power-pop approach and featured the hits “Someone Who’s Cool” and “Nothing Beautiful”, but despite the advent of continuous touring, the band found itself more involved in outside projects (like being Murray McLaughlin’s backing band on his album ‘Gulliver’s Taxi’ and Kim Stockwood’s ‘Bona Vista’), leaving The Odds without a direction. 1997 was full of disjointed tour dates and completion for the soundtrack to ‘Dog’s Park’. But the band did manage to salvage 1998 with some larger festival gigs. Following the backing band position with George Martin on his 1999 ‘In My Life’ tour, the Odds went gone on permanent hiatus (this was amicable as per an internet message on March 15, 1999 from Craig Northey confirming that he’d left the band). Later that year the members of The Odds, minus Steven Drake reformed as Sharkskin, an all-instrumental band, with the addition of Simon Kendall (keyboards). Craig Northey has also been busy as a songwriter for hire with a new publishing deal. He has written material with the likes of Jesse Valenzuela (ex-Gin Blossoms) among others and has released his own solo projects. In early 2006 The Odds’ song “Someone Who’s Cool” was used as the theme song to the short-lived CBS music industry comedy ‘Love Monkey’ starring fellow Canadians Tom Kavanagh and Jason Priestly; The Odds reconvened as The New Odds in 2007 with Murray Atkinson filling the chair left empty by Steven Drake (who continues his busy production career. Odds released a new album in 2008 entitled ‘Cheerleader’ and toured to support it. with additional notes from Nicole Amadio, Kevin Gandel and Paul Myers.

They then opened a show for Blu Cantrell in Edmonton, Alberta. They launched a 2002 Summer Tour of North America to support their next single – “Falling in Love” – which included performances in the top 23 markets. Off Limitz appeared on several morning TV shows, interviewed with ‘Pulse’ and ‘Teen People’ magazines, performed at Disney World, Busch Gardens, SeaWorld, MTV and large malls across the U.S. Their follow-up single to “Falling In Love” was the song “Over” which was released in the US in February 2003.

After “Sainte-Chrone de Neant” during its ‘Mass For the Dead’ was recorded November 30, 1972 at St. Joseph’s Oratory, Montreal, Barclay Records showed interest and released an album in 1972 called ‘Offenbach Soap Opera’ followed by the Mass recording a year later. Lamothe, and Belval, left to form Corbeau in 1977, and Kerr and Millaire left in 1978. The 1979 line-up consisted of Boulet, Gravel, McGale, LeBoeuf, and Harrison. 1980 saw a break from touring as the band spent time recording two albums for Spectra-Scene. By 1982 they returned to touring their hard rocking progressive rock in Québec. At this time Harrison left and was replaced by Martel. Offenbach disbanded in 1985 which was followed by Kebec-Disc’s release of their live album ‘Le Dernier Show’ recorded at the Montreal Forum.

From there she moved onto the Go Deo Chorus until they disbanded in 1983. In 1984 she signed a recording contract with Virgin Records, but it was another four years before the debut of her first album ‘Miss America’. The first single, “Body In Trouble”, was released in early 1989. Critics fell over themselves trying to out ‘adjective’ each other in heaping praise the singer-songwriter. Alas, sales didn’t live up to the critical praise and she all but vanished following an EP of Christmas songs. O’Hara showed up occasionally on other artists’ works such as This Mortal Coil and Everything But the Girl. In 2002 she finally released ‘Apartment Hunting’ – the soundtrack to the independent Canadian film of the same name by Bill Robertson.

His family initially emigrated to New York, and finally Toronto. At the age of 13 he began writing music on guitar and playing in rock bands. A near-death experience at 21 led him to spiritual studies including getting a diploma as a Goldsmith. He continued his spiritual studies, musical growth, and made a living as a jeweler. His studies also took him to Central and South America where he was invited to work with the Michael Hedges Foundation. While working with the Foundation he wrote a book about the legendary Crystal Skull later adapted as a screenplay called ‘Atlantis Rising.’ After being dismissed by a skeptical world, Morrison found himself back in Canada in the early 1980s where he focused on writing music for film and assembling a band. Ohm And the Secret Sources first appeared as a 5-piece from Toronto, Ontario. They released a 7” single that got airplay on Q107FM and followed it a few years later with a 12” EP entitled ‘Exit From A Dream’. A signing to a European record label led to a tour there in the late 1980s, but a manager embezzled his money and Morrison was forced to return to Toronto financially broker. Morrison would busk for the next three years around Toronto in an effort to raise money to build a recording studio. By 1995 he’d formed a new version of his band which he rechristened Ohm And the Temple of Sound. They’ve released several albums to date. Morrison has also released other projects under the name Ohm Angel and Ohm eYe God.

Rupert Harvey was born in Jamaica, but his family moved to Canada when he was eleven years old. While still in his teens, he co-founded the Canadian band Crack Of Dawn – the first all black band in Canada to be signed to a major label (CBS Records) in 1975. They released their self-titled debt album in 1976 and had several successful radio hits particularly the single “It’s Alright (This Feeling I’m Feeling)”. In the late 1970s, he embarked on a solo career. His 1979 solo album ‘The Shadow’ (known as ‘Ojiji’ in Swahili and a name he adopted) was mostly instrumentals featuring Harvey and assists from Crack of Dawn members Andre King, Carl Harvey, Carl Otway, and Paul Douglas among others.In the early 1980’s Harvey co-founded Canadian reggae act Messenjah with Errol Blackwood. A major break came in 1982 when Joe Strummer of The Clash picked the act to open Canadian dates on The Clash’s ‘Combat Rock’ tour. Messenjah was signed to Warner Bros. Records and went on to win many awards including a JUNO Award. After Messenjah disbanded, Harvey released the album ‘Once a Lion’ in 2000 and was briefly in the band The Redeem Team. In recent years he has become head of the Tai Mantis Kung Fu Association in Toronto, Ontario. He was also elected the only non-Chinese president of the 400-year old Praying Mantis Kung Fu School from China.

They played mainly high schools but did manage a performance at the Man And His World Pavillion during Expo ’67 in Montréal. Jerry Cushen (from Fulford, Québec) would replace Worden in 1969. The band built their own recording studio in the basement of a restaurant. The scrounged up used recording gear and laid down original songs for the A-side of their self-produced, self-titled debut album; the flip-side live performances from a show at the Waterloo Arena. They released the album independently in 1969. The band would make in-roads around Québec and released several singles. The first was on Trans-World who distilled the songs “(Good Morning) Here Comes The Sun” and “Feeling Groovy” from the debut album. They would also license material to Aquarius Records in 1976 for a one-off single of Alan O’Day’s “Rock and Roll Heaven,” that they would re-issue on their own Capt. Moze label in 1977.

Meanwhile, in Drayton Valley, Alberta, in 1975, Ian Oscar hooked up with high school friends David Brisebois (bass) and his brother Dennis (guitar), Derrick Henningsmoan (drums) and Drayton Carl (guitar) as Stonehenge. They pursued a heavy rock sound influenced by the likes of Deep Purple, Steppenwolf and Iron Butterfly. By 1977 the band had transformed so many times with so many different incarnations that Oscar decided to look for greener pastures. As it happened, Sunderland had quit Pickens and Oscar replaced her. The band recorded and released a single at Sundown Recording Studio. Doug Johnston and Fred Larose left the band shortly after the first single was produced and Ron Vaugeois and Randy Lloyd replaced them on drums and bass. The new act featured Shelland, Quelch, Burghardt, Lloyd and Vaugeois and started performing under the handle One Horse Blue — named after a horse owned by Oscar’s sister and based on the Paul Cotton song by Poco. Under the production tutelage of Wes Daskus the band recorded their self-titled debut album in 1978 for the Vera Cruz label which spawned the Canadian charting hit “Cry Out For The Sun”. During this period they were also enlisted as the backing band for Dakus’s other production project Shannon Two Feathers on the album ‘Dreams That Feed A Gypsy’. More member changes, including the departure of Oscar and Quelch (who formed The Victory Group) preceded the recording of the follow-up, ‘Bite The Bullet’, in 1980. The production chores (and vocal duties) were handled by Shelland and Vaugeios. By 1981’s ‘Livin’ On The Edge’, the band was under the guidance of the only member left — Ron Vaugeois. A version of One Horse Blue featuring Shelland, Gordon Maxwell (bass, vocals) and Shuld recorded the album ‘One Horse Blue’ for Savannah in 1993. Shuld left the band before touring began to raise his daughter. He was replaced by Jim Foster (ex-Fosterchild). The original 1978 version of One Horse Blue reunited for The Edmonton Chamber’s CFR Week “Cowboy Cabaret” on November 10, 2005 at the Shaw Conference Centre with their heroes Poco and Pure Prairie League; Quelch still lives, performs and teaches music in Edmonton and is in the Cathy Kowalski Band; Ron Vaugeois appeared on Tim Feehan’s 1983 album ‘Carmalita’, was a member of the blues act Big Dreamer, and has done engineering work for the likes of R. Harlan Smith.; Michael Shelland kept the One Horse Blue name alive in the 1990’s and also wrote material for Stewart MacDougall and Michael Carey among others; MacNab would go on to co-found Famous Blue Raincoat. He passed away July 4, 2012. with notes from Doug Johnston and Mavis McCauley.\n\nSingles\n\n1978 Cry Out For The Sun/Hold All Your Happiness (Vera Cruz) VCR-102\n\n1978 You And I/For Reasons (Vera Cruz) VCR-110\n\n1978 Deliver Me/Words To Me (Vera Cruz) VCR-113\n\n1979 Bring My Love Around/Mr. Soul (Vera Cruz) VCR-119\n\n1980 Some Women/Blue Room (Vera Cruz) VCR-122\n\n1980 Mr. Soul/Crazy Fool (Vera Cruz) VCR-126\n\n1980 Lost And Found/Sarah (Vera Cruz) VCR-132\n\n1981 Some Night/Piece Of The Sky (Vera Cruz) VCR-137\n\n1981 Runaways/We All Have Our Heroes (Vera Cruz) VCR-142\n\n1981 Livin’ On The Edge/Hey, Boy (Vera Cruz) VCR-145\n\n1982 Breakdown/Love Or Desperation (Vera Cruz) VCR-157\n\n1993 Hopeless Love (Savannah) SVCD-17\n\n1993 Bring Back Your Love (Savannah) SVCD-20\n\nAlbums\n\n1978 One Horse Blue (Vera Cruz) VCR-1002\n\n1980 Bite The Bullet (Vera Cruz) VCR-1005\n\n1981 Livin’ On The Edge (Vera Cruz) VCR-1015\n\n1982 On The Street (Vera Cruz) VCR-1022\n\n1993 One Horse Blue (Savannah) SRK-9844\n\nONE OF YOU\n\nOne of You is the work of a Prague, Czechoslovakian woman who escaped to Toronto, Ontario during the Czechoslovakia uprising in 1968.

When Reny and Howe decided to break out on their own they sent out demos from Howe’s home production facility. Howe played all the instruments and produced the recordings with Reny singing a la Eurythmics. In 1984, through their manager Clive Corcoran, they landed a deal with Saga’s label, Bonaire in England who flew them to West Germany to record. Their first album, ‘Forward Your Emotions’, took the Canadian charts by storm in 1985. They had three successful singles – “There Was A Time”, “Angel In My Pocket” and “Black On White” before returning back to the studio to work on the album’s follow-up. The act scored three Juno Award nominations in 1986 for ‘Most Promising Group of the Year’, ‘Producer of the Year (Leslie Howe)’, and ‘Recording Engineer of the Year’ (Leslie Howe). The next album, entitled ‘1-2-1’, repeated their initial success with the more guitar driven songs like the chart successful “Hold Me Now” and “Do You Believe” (co-written with Lisa Erskine). With their two album deal finished with the financially troubled Bonaire Records, One 2 One (as they were now called) were hand picked by Herb Alpert for his label A & M Records. 1992’s ‘Imagine It’ was a little more Adult Contemporary and New Country feeling giving the act a cross-over hit with “Peace of Mind”. The follow-up single, “Memory Lane”, achieved subtle recognition as incidental music in an episode of the Hollywood TV soap ‘Melrose Place’. As a non-touring studio act, One 2 One finally ran out of steam as the market would no longer support their brand of pop music. The duo took a break as Howe filled his Distortion Studios with paying production work particularly Alanis (better known as Alanis Morisette). Howe, along with MCA Records’ John Alexander was instrumental in developing Morisette as a teen dance idol early in her career. By the mid-90’s Reny and Howe decided to form a real recording and touring band called Sal’s Birdland featuring Michael Goyette (guitar), Tim Dupont (bass) and Andrew Lamarche (drums).

Two singles were released entitled “Married Or Single” and “Another Motel Memory”, both reaching Top 20 on the Canadian country charts.

They would rehearse frequently and made their debut in Churchill, Manitoba before venturing into the Winnipeg community club circuit. Roberts left and was replaced by ex-Kingbeats drummer Dutch Schultz. The band developed a reputation for intricate harmonies on cover versions of songs by The Zombies as well as their blond hair, white suits, and white guitars. After dominating the Winnipeg, they ventured east looking to make a name for themselves in Toronto’s Yorkville Village, but the pay was so bad that they had to haul their gear by streetcar to shows. Loreque bowed out to be replaced by Holmes. Schultz then left and was replaced by Fisher on drums. This final version of the band would record a single as OR FAN on their own imprint in 1968. The band would fort shortly thereafter; Loreque went on to play in Coach ‘n’ Four and Fellowship with Heppner (who also went on to be in Granny, and B.B. Bullion); Holmes joined Chopping Block.

Stiffenin Against the Wall’ featuring the break-out hit “Check the O.R.” before splitting up in 1992. They would reunite and release their sophomore album ‘Too Young To Die’ in 2008; Tom Green would go on to have success on cable access TV with ‘The Tom Green Show’ in Ottawa, Ontario before finding fame in Hollywood as an actor/comedian – and being married, briefly, to Drew Barrymore.

Using this as a performance base, he formed The North Country Singers with Graham Bruce (bass) and Joseph Cavender (drums). Innes saw Sotan Recording artist Dixie Lee Stone performing there as well and soon asked her to join the ensemble. The group headed out on a cross s Canada tour, swinging down into the US where they picked up Portland, Oregon native Bliss Mackie as second guitarist eventually landing in Los Angeles and changing their name to The Original Caste. Through Innes’s former label, Dot Records, they recorded two singles including “I Can’t Make It Anymore” (1968) which was less than a blip on the music industry radar. However, after signing with TA Records, a label distributed by Bell Records (Columbia), in 1969, Innes met writers Dennis Lambert and Brian Potter, who would produce The Original Caste’s first album. They struck pay dirt after releasing the duo’s “One Tin Soldier” that same year. The song made No. 6 on RPM Weekly chart and No. 34 on the Billboard Top40 and went to No.1 on the CHUM Chart. They charted even higher with “Mr. Monday” which hit No. 4 on RPM Weekly’s chart and No. 3 on the CHUM Chart in Canada. The two singles combined, worldwide, sold over three million copies. Despite the failure of “Mr. Monday” to chart in the US, they landed opening slots for the likes of BB King and Glen Campbell south of the border and made numerous TV appearances. “One Tin Soldier” had a revival of sorts in 1972 when it was featured in the movie ‘Billy Jack’, however it was not the Original Caste on the soundtrack but rather American band Coven featuring singer Jinx Dawson. The singles made another round at radio and had significant sales after being re-issued. The husband and wife team of Dixie Lee and Bruce Innes would record together and as solo artists as a continued extension of their Original Caste recording contract through Bell. With switch to Century II Records out of Canada, the new four-piece version of the group (now with Gary Carlson on bass and Tom Doran on drums) released the ‘Back Home’ album in 1974. The new version of Original Caste toured into the late 1970’s. When the band made its final split in 1980 so did the Innes’; Dixie remarried and became a social worker; Bruce began jingle and film score work, remarried and moved to Washington. He currently lives in Idaho. In 2000 Bruce Innes produced country artist Brenn Hill utilizing the help of veteran country/folk singer Ian Tyson; Mackie died in 2004; Joe Cavender now resides in Seattle, Washington; Carlson now resides in Bellevue, Idaho; Coats now resides in Sandpoint, Idaho. With the release of ‘The Best Of The Original Caste’ in Japan in 2005, another revival of the act returned with a line-up headed by Bruce Innes and Cheryl Morrel on vocals. In 2008 Innes, with new vocalist Jilla Web, a featured artist with Las Vegas show “Superstars Live In Concert,” re-recorded “One Tin Soldier” with the Nashville Children’s Choir. A new CD is planned. Innes and Web) can be seen in concert in theaters across the US performing their highly acclaimed traveling show ‘One Tin Soldier Rides Again.’ Bruce Innes died September 28, 2023. with notes from Bruce Innes.
