        "text": "Background. Section 3304(a)(14) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) requires SESAs to take certain actions regarding aliens filing claims for unemployment compensation. The intent of these laws is, in brief, to prohibit paying unemployment compensation to an alien whose wage credits are based on services performed while the alien was not legally entitled to employment within the United States. Lack of benefit entitlement can stem from either illegal entry or employment obtained in violation of the alien's status or residence.\n\nRecently, pilot studies were begun to determine the extent to which illegal aliens were filing for unemployment benefits. Several SESAs are participating in the study in cooperation with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and with technical assistance from ETA. In two sites the studies were initiated after the INS found evidence that an illegal alien apprehended for deportation was collecting benefits at the time the individual was apprehended. The preliminary findings indicate potentially widespread abuse of the unemployment insurance program by illegal aliens.\n\nThe determination of citizenship/alien status is normally a part of the initial claimstaking process. If an individual indicates that he or she is not a citizen, the individual should be asked to furnish proof of legal alien status with authorization to work. Most often, the document furnished as proof of legal alien status with authorization to work is an Alien Registration Receipt Card (Form 1-551 or Form 1-151) or \"green card.\". The INS advises that this document is the most counterfeited or altered of all immigration documents. On the Alien Registration Receipt Card is an alien registration number, the \"A\" number which can be verified with the INS.\n\nAlthough the procedures vary somewhat among the sites, two basic approaches are being used by the SESAs participating in the pilot studies to determine whether illegal aliens are filing for unemployment benefits. The first approach involves verifying with INS the authenticity of an alien's immigration document, most often the Alien Registration Receipt Card. The second is a crossmatch with unemployment insurance records of social security numbers obtained from aliens apprehended for deportation.\n\nWhile only a small stage of individuals filing initial claims are aliens, the preliminary findings from the pilot studies show that a substantial number of these aliens (as high as 40%) are verified by INS as being illegal aliens who are not authorized to work. In many cases, the alien registration number on the claimant's document was not on file with INS, indicating the immigration document was counterfeit. In other cases, the documents may have been altered because the name, date of birth, or sex on the claimant's card did not agree with the data in INS records.\n\nIn the case of aliens apprehended for deportation, the INS estimates that between 10 to 15 percent have a social security number in their possession. Several SESAs matched the social security numbers of illegal aliens deported from their States over a period of several months with UI benefits payment records for the last 3 Years, and in some cases wage records. A number of deported aliens (as high as 25 percent) had recent claims activity and, in some cases, claims were currently filed under the social security number of the deported alien.\n\nThe sizeable amounts of unemployment benefits being improperly paid to illegal aliens represents an unwarranted drain on State trust funds at a time when the issue of Trust Fund solvency is particularly critical. Accordingly, all SESAs need to take action to implement procedures for preventing and detesting payments of benefits to illegal aliens."
