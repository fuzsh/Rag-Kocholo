        "text": "Flat board for communicating with spirits\n\nThis article is about the spiritualist use of the Ouija board. For other uses, see Ouija (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Ouida.\n\nThe Ouija ( WEE-jə, -⁠jee), also known as a Oujia board, spirit board, talking board, or witch board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the Latin alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \"yes\", \"no\", and occasionally \"hello\" and \"goodbye\", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a planchette (a small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic) as a movable indicator to spell out messages during a séance. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. The name \"Ouija\" is a trademark of Hasbro[1] (inherited from Parker Brothers[citation needed]), but is often used generically to refer to any talking board.\n\nSpiritualists in the United States believed that the dead were able to contact the living, and reportedly used a talking board very similar to the modern Ouija board at their camps in Ohio during 1886 with the intent of enabling faster communication with spirits.[2] Following its commercial patent by businessman Elijah Bond being passed on 10 February 1891,[3] the Ouija board was regarded as an innocent parlor game unrelated to the occult until American spiritualist Pearl Curran popularized its use as a divining tool during World War I.[4]\n\nParanormal and supernatural beliefs associated with Ouija have been criticized by the scientific community and are characterized as pseudoscience. The action of the board can be most easily explained by unconscious movements of those controlling the pointer, a psychophysiological phenomenon known as the ideomotor effect.[2][5][6][7][8]\n\nMainstream Christian denominations, including Catholicism, have warned against the use of Ouija boards, considering their use Satanic practice, while other religious groups hold that they can lead to demonic possession.[9][10] Occultists, on the other hand, are divided on the issue, with some claiming it can be a tool for positive transformation, while others reiterate the warnings of many Christians and caution \"inexperienced users\" against it.[9]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe popular belief that the word Ouija comes from the French (oui) and German (ja) words for yes is a misconception. In fact, the name was given from a word spelled out on the board when medium Helen Peters Nosworthy asked the board to name itself. When asked what the word meant, it responded \"Good Luck.\"[2][11]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPrecursors\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the first mentions of the automatic writing method used in the Ouija board is found in China around 1100 AD, in historical documents of the Song dynasty. The method was known as fuji \"planchette writing\". The use of planchette writing as an ostensible means of necromancy and communion with the spirit-world continued, and, albeit under special rituals and supervisions, was a central practice of the Quanzhen School, until it was forbidden by the Qing dynasty.[12]\n\nTalking boards\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a part of the spiritualist movement, mediums began to employ various means for communication with the dead. Following the American Civil War in the United States, mediums did significant business in allegedly allowing survivors to contact lost relatives. Use of talking boards was so common by 1886 that news reported the phenomenon taking over the spiritualists' camps in Ohio.[2] The Ouija was named in 1890 in Baltimore, Maryland by medium and spiritualist Helen Peters Nosworthy.[11]\n\nCommercial parlor game\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles Kennard, the founder of Kennard Novelty Company, claims to have invented the board with his business partner, Elijah Bond, who patented it with help from his sister-in-law, spiritualist and medium Helen Peters Nosworthy. The local patent office at first refused a patent. Bond and Nosworthy then traveled to Washington, D.C. where they were also denied a patent until the chief patent officer asked the board to spell out his name, which it did.[14] In 1901, an employee of Bond, William Fuld, took over the talking board production under the name \"Ouija.\"[15][failed verification]\n\nScientific investigation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ouija phenomenon is considered by the scientific community to be the result of the ideomotor response.[5][17][18][19] Michael Faraday first described this effect in 1853, while investigating table-turning.[20][21]\n\nVarious studies have been conducted, recreating the effects of the Ouija board in the lab and showing that, under laboratory conditions, the subjects were moving the planchette involuntarily.[17][22] A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, Ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind.[18] Skeptics have described Ouija board users as \"operators\".[23] Some critics have noted that the messages ostensibly spelled out by spirits were similar to whatever was going through the minds of the subjects.[24] According to professor of neurology Terence Hines in his book Pseudoscience and the Paranormal (2003):[25]\n\nThe planchette is guided by unconscious muscular exertions like those responsible for table movement. Nonetheless, in both cases, the illusion that the object (table or planchette) is moving under its own control is often extremely powerful and sufficient to convince many people that spirits are truly at work ... The unconscious muscle movements responsible for the moving tables and Ouija board phenomena seen at seances are examples of a class of phenomena due to what psychologists call a dissociative state. A dissociative state is one in which consciousness is somehow divided or cut off from some aspects of the individual's normal cognitive, motor, or sensory functions.\n\nSome involuntary movements are known as \"Automatism\".[26]\n\nThis correlates with the ideomotor phenomenon because both rely on unconscious movement. The difference is that the ideomotor phenomenon is based on the idea that just the idea that something can happen tricks the brain into doing it. For example, thinking about not moving the planchette leads to the possibility of the planchette moving, which then makes someone unconsciously move the planchette.[26]\n\nOuija boards were already criticized by scholars early on, being described in a 1927 journal as \"'vestigial remains' of primitive belief-systems\" and a con to part fools from their money.[27] Another 1921 journal described reports of Ouija board findings as 'half truths' and suggested that their inclusion in national newspapers at the time lowered the national discourse overall.[28]\n\nReligious responses\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Christian views on magic\n\nSince early in the Ouija board's history, it has been criticized by several Christian denominations.[9] The Catholic Church in the Catechism of the Catholic Church explicitly forbids any practice of divination which includes the usage of Ouija boards.[29] Catholic Answers, a Roman Catholic Christian apologetics organization, claims that \"The Ouija board is far from harmless, as it is a form of divination (seeking information from supernatural sources).\"[30]\n\nIn 2005, Catholic bishops in the Chuuk State of the Federated States of Micronesia called for the boards to be banned and warned congregations that they were talking to demons when using Ouija boards.[31] In a 1995 pastoral letter, The Dutch Reformed Churches encouraged its communicants to avoid Ouija boards, as it is a practice \"related to the occult\".[32] The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod forbids its faithful from using Ouija boards as a violation of the Ten Commandments.[33]\n\nIn 2001, Ouija boards were burned in Alamogordo, New Mexico, by fundamentalist groups as \"symbols of witchcraft\".[34][35][36] Religious criticism has expressed beliefs that the Ouija board reveals information which should only be in God's hands, and thus it is a tool of Satan.[37] A spokesperson for Human Life International described the boards as a portal to talk to spirits and called for Hasbro to be prohibited from marketing them.[38]\n\nThese religious objections to use of the Ouija board have given rise to ostension type folklore in the communities where they circulate. Cautionary tales that the board opens a door to evil spirits turn the game into the subject of a supernatural dare, especially for young people.[4]\n\nNotable users\n\n[edit]\n\nLiterature\n\n[edit]\n\nOuija boards have been the source of inspiration for literary works, used as guidance in writing or as a form of channeling literary works. As a result of Ouija boards' becoming popular in the early 20th century, by the 1920s many \"psychic\" books were written of varying quality often initiated by Ouija board use.[39]\n\nEmily Grant Hutchings claimed that her novel Jap Herron: A Novel Written from the Ouija Board (1917) was dictated by Mark Twain's spirit through the use of a Ouija board after his death[40]\n\nPearl Lenore Curran (1883–1937), alleged that for over 20 years she was in contact with a spirit named Patience Worth. This symbiotic relationship produced several novels, and works of poetry and prose, which Pearl Curran claimed were delivered to her through channelling Worth's spirit during sessions with a Ouija board, and which works Curran then transcribed\n\nMuch of William Butler Yeats's later poetry was inspired, among other facets of occultism, by the Ouija board[citation needed]\n\nIn late 1963, Jane Roberts and her husband Robert Butts started experimenting with a Ouija board as part of Roberts' research for a book on extra-sensory perception.[41] According to Roberts and Butts, on 2 December 1963, they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality (an \"energy personality essence no longer focused in the physical world\") who eventually identified himself as \"Seth\", culminating in a series of books dictated by \"Seth\"\n\nIn 1982, poet James Merrill released an apocalyptic 560-page epic poem titled The Changing Light at Sandover, which documented two decades of messages dictated from the Ouija board during séances hosted by Merrill and his partner David Noyes Jackson. Sandover, which received the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1983,[42] was published in three volumes beginning in 1976. The first contained a poem for each of the letters A through Z, and was called The Book of Ephraim. It appeared in the collection Divine Comedies, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1977.[43] According to Merrill, the spirits ordered him to write and publish the next two installments, Mirabell: Books of Number in 1978 (which won the National Book Award for Poetry)[44] and Scripts for the Pageant in 1980.\n\nAleister Crowley\n\n[edit]\n\nAleister Crowley had great admiration for the use of the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her greatest spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones:\n\nYour Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate.\n\nOver the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated 21 February 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones,\n\nRe: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week.\n\nIn March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him, \"I'll think up another name for Ouija.\" But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board, that\n\nThere is, however, a good way of using this instrument to get what you want, and that is to perform the whole operation in a consecrated circle, so that undesirable aliens cannot interfere with it. You should then employ the proper magical invocation in order to get into your circle just the one spirit you want. It is comparatively easy to do this. A few simple instructions are all that is necessary, and I shall be pleased to give these, free of charge, to any one who cares to apply.\n\nOthers\n\n[edit]\n\nRoland Doe used a Ouija board, which the Catholic Church stated led to his possession by a demon[46]\n\nDick Brooks, of the Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania, uses a Ouija board as part of a paranormal and seance presentation[47]\n\nG.

Alice Cooper later revealed that he just thought of the first name that came to his head while discussing a new band name with his band[50]\n\nFormer Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi claimed under oath that, in a séance held in 1978 with other professors at the University of Bologna, the \"ghost\" of Giorgio La Pira used a Ouija to spell the name of the street where Aldo Moro was being held by the Red Brigades\n\nAccording to Peter Popham of The Independent: \"Everybody here has long believed that Prodi's Ouija board tale was no more than an ill-advised and bizarre way to conceal the identity of his true source, probably a person from Bologna's seething far-left underground whom he was pledged to protect\"[51]\n\nThe Mars Volta wrote their album Bedlam in Goliath (2008) based on their alleged experiences with a Ouija board\n\nAccording to their story (written for them by a fiction author, Jeremy Robert Johnson), Omar Rodriguez Lopez purchased one while traveling in Jerusalem. At first the board provided a story which became the theme for the album. Strange events allegedly related to this activity occurred during the recording of the album: the studio flooded, one of the album's main engineers had a nervous breakdown, equipment began to malfunction, and Cedric Bixler-Zavala's foot was injured. Following these bad experiences the band buried the Ouija board[52]\n\nIn the murder trial of Joshua Tucker, his mother insisted that he had carried out the murders while possessed by the Devil, who found him when he was using a Ouija board[53][54]\n\nIn London in 1994, convicted murderer Stephen Young was granted a retrial after it was learned that four of the jurors had conducted a Ouija board séance and had \"contacted\" the murdered man, who had named Young as his killer.[55] Young was convicted for a second time at his retrial and jailed for life[56][57][58]\n\nE.

Hill, whilst prisoners of the Turks during the First World War, used a Ouija board to convince their captors that they were mediums as part of an escape plan[59]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nOuija boards have figured prominently in horror tales in various media as devices enabling malevolent spirits to spook their users.\n\nIn the 1960 supernatural horror film 13 Ghosts the family Zorba plays the game \"Ouija, the mystifying oracle.\"\n\nEpisodes of Lost in Space (\"Ghost in Space\" (1966)) and The Waltons (\"The Ghost Story\" (1974)) have spirit boards as part of their plots.\n\nA Ouija board is an early part of the plot of the 1973 horror film The Exorcist. Using a Ouija board the young girl Regan makes what first appears to be harmless contact with an entity named \"Captain Howdy.\" She later becomes possessed by a demon.\n\nBased on Ouija Board, a song and album of the name, Ojah Awake, by Osibisa, was released in 1976.\n\nThe 1986 film Witchboard and its sequels center on the use of Ouija. The 1991 film And You Thought Your Parents Were Weird features use of a Ouija board in an important early scene. What Lies Beneath (2000) includes a séance scene with a board.
