Just in time for Halloween, the Royal Oui release their moody Tex-Mex version of Springsteen’s “Brilliant Disguise.” Last time out the duo released a cover by a different Bruce, Canadian icon Bruce Cockburn. Their electro-fueled take on the 80s classic “Lovers In A Dangerous Time” was featured on CBC’s “Songs You Need To Hear” and stayed in rotation for months on Radio 3.

To capture a vintage style vocal blend, Adrienne and Ari performed the song simultaneously around a single mic. It is available for free download on Bandcamp and Soundcloud. Expect another free single before the end of the year.

The Royal Oui’s debut album came out on File Under: Music in February 2014. It was featured in sources like Rolling Stone, No Depression and Exclaim! and made the year end top 200 of Canadian college radio play. The band has logged hundreds of dates opening for acts like Lindi Ortega, Great Lake Swimmers, Jacco Gardner, Steve Poltz and many others. In 2016, the Royal Oui will release a brand new EP and support it with dates in the US and Canada.
