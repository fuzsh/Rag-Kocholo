Eduard Messerschmitt Bf 109G-4/R6 of Uffz. Peter Düttmann in 1/72 Scale

Peter Düttmann was one of the later arrivals to JG 52, joining the Group in May of 1943 just a few weeks before his twentieth birthday. He quickly found his footing and was credited with his first victory, a Polikarpov Po-2 biplane, on 21MAY43. He was an aggressive pilot who scored steadily, but was himself shot down several times, including three times in one day on 23JAN44. His best day was on 07MAY44 when he was credited with nine aerial victories during two sorties.

Düttmann survived the war and was credited with a total of 152 victories. Although he himself was shot down several times, he always managed to evade capture and walk back to German lines. Peter Düttmann survived the war and passed away in January 2001.

Fine Molds Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/Trop of Oberleutnant Werner Schröer in 1/72 Scale

Werner Schröer was already trained as a pilot when the Second World War began. In August 1940 he was posted to Jagdgeswader 27 on the Channel Front. There he claimed three victories but none of these were confirmed. JG 27 was transferred to North Africa, where Schröer finally received credit for his first victory, a RAF Hurricane on 19APR41. However, Schröer’s Messerschmitt was also damaged in this encounter and he made a forced landing, making his aircraft the first Bf 109 shot down in the African Theater. Two days later he was back in combat, but was again shot down. Ironically, there is some evidence that on both occasions Schröer was downed by the same pilot, a Pilot Officer Spence.

He remained in combat, but only scored sporadically until he was promoted to Staffelkapitän of 8./JG 27 in June, 1942. By the time JG 27 withdrew to Italy in November he was the second highest scorer in North Africa with 61 victories, behind only Hans-Jochim Marseille who had 158 victories when he was killed. In Italy Schröer was promoted to Gruppenkommandeur II./JG 27 and continued to score until the Gruppe was withdrawn to Germany. There they were assigned to Defense of the Reich duties operating against the American heavy bomber streams which were gaining in strength. In April 1944 the Gruppe gave up its Messerschmitts and transitioned to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. These were used as fighter-bombers over the Invasion Front beginning in June 1944 where the unit was decimated. Schröer was posted to instructor duty, then as Kommodore of JG 3. He survived the war with 114 victories, including 26 heavy bombers and 12 Soviet aircraft.
