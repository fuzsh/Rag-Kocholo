Seen the Woody Allen film? Bought, devoured, and sold the comic books "for beginners"? You ain't seen nothing yet. "Deconstruction" is, it seems, everywhere, and Derrida follows. In quotation marks, nota bene.

Alexander Garcia Düttmann wins the grand prize for gratuitous invocation of Derrida's name: in an appearance at Documenta X in Kassel entitled "Who is afraid of Jacques Derrida - Kulturspektakel" which had nothing whatsoever to do with Derrida or Derrida's work. With the right plugins, you can view the whole 40 minutes' rant online, http://www.mediaweb-tv.de or http://www.mediaweb-tv.com (both work).

Much beloved, utterly silly and now slightly dated: Scritti Politti's record, "I'm in love with Jacques Derrida". And thanks to J Christian Guerrero, here's a 782 k soundfile!

Less popular but no less musical: Eric Avery's trio, "Deconstruction" (American Recordings, 1994). Here are two soundfiles (238 k and 281 k, respectively), plus the lyrics and a discussion among the band members about the word Deconstruction.

Yet another gratuitous use of the word: "Decoded and Danced Up - The Rhythms of Deconstruction" (Deconstruction Records/RCA 1992)

Micaela Henich's collection of 1003 india ink drawings, published under the title "Mille e tre", is accompanied by 5 writer-poet-thinkers who were asked each to write on 200 of the drawings in the series (the last three have no text).
