Margie Ferguson generously shared with us her memories and facts, and read—and enriched—the Introduction. Christina Leon, Perry ­Guevara, and above all, Patrick Blanchfield were the first to read the manuscript of “Mary Shelley and Her Circle,” yielding precious, thoughtful help at the initial stages. Dr. Amy Jamgochian offered editorial insight and tirelessly facilitated the preparation of the manuscript for publication. Dane Primerano helped as a scrupulous library researcher, as a discriminating critical reader, and finally as a companion-interlocutor, first in checking and verifying correctness of quotations, later in contributing insightful feedback on the writing and the editing and in offering thereby—throughout the various stages of the process—unwavering support and reliable, loyal assistance (both technical and intellectual) without which this last volume could not have been brought to fruition. Eyal P ­ eretz was, as always, a valued intellectual interlocutor, an uncompromising critic, and a generous friend and supporter. Finally, thanks are due to Werner Hamacher for his encouragement, his unconventional support, and his exquisite editorial sensitivity. Barbara Johnson’s essay “The Last Man” was first delivered as a lecture in French followed by a public discussion, at a conference held in Cerisy, France, and published in its French original as Barbara Johnson, “Le dernier homme,” in Actes du colloque de Cerisy: Les fins de l’homme— à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida, 23 juillet–2 août 1980, ed.

These essays provide essential insights into the work, and the life, of Mary Shelley, and more specifically, into the entanglement of Mary Shelley’s life and writing. The original and daring works collected in this volume also sketch out a trajectory from the beginning to the end of Barbara Johnson’s own brilliant career, and offer a glimpse of the inextricability of this career—of its far-reaching literary critical, theoretical, and feminist innovations—from the writing, and (theorized) life, of Mary Shelley. Prefaced by a lucid description of Johnson’s critical and theoretical development written by Mary Wilson Carpenter, a scholar of nineteenthcentury British women’s writing, the book consists of two parts, each involving essays by Barbara Johnson about Mary Shelley as well as critical interpretations of Barbara Johnson’s writing by a major philosophical or literary theorist. In Part One, Johnson’s early essays on Mary Shelley (or inspired by the image of Mary Shelley’s monster) are followed by a critical commentary offered by the leading feminist philosopher Judith Butler. In Part Two, Johnson’s last book, Mary Shelley and Her Circle—written during her final illness and finished just weeks before she died—is followed by a critical commentary written by the eminent literary critic and theorist Shoshana Felman. We thus come to understand Johnson’s vision of the intricate relation between Mary Shelley’s life and writing by discovering the ways in which Johnson’s work is, in its turn, bound up with her\n\nxii\n\nCathy Caruth\n\nreading of—her life “with”—Mary Shelley. And we likewise discover the profound significance of these interwoven lives and works by recognizing the way in which Johnson’s conceptual and existential imperatives are commented on—and continue to resonate in—the inspiring essays of the women-critics who contribute to this volume, and who live, write, and think with Barbara Johnson. In thus providing an inventive critical overlay of the work of Mary Shelley and of Barbara Johnson, this book affords new genealogical perspectives on late twentieth-century and early twenty-first-century critical thought. In her innovative readings of Mary Shelley’s work, and in particular of her most famous novel, Frankenstein, Johnson began to shift the definition of Romanticism from its focus on great male poets to its interplay of these famous writers with the novelistic writing of Mary Shelley, who, always on the margin, implicitly (as Johnson suggested) narrated the complexity of the woman writer’s position in her own literary texts. During a period when the literary theoretical scene was drawing its own lines back to its Romantic forebears—particularly in the cutting-edge deconstructive writing of the 1980s—Barbara Johnson thus opened up a new line between contemporary thought and a different romanticism, one which gave birth to a genre of literary, theoretical, and (indirectly) autobiographical writing exemplified, in stunning originality, by Johnson’s own work. At the same time, by drawing together Johnson’s work on Mary Shelley with the work of influential feminist critics and theorists, Barbara Johnson: A Life with Mary Shelley allows us to recognize another alternative genealogy, one that binds the feminist critical writing of the 1980’s—whose legacy is practiced also by the feminist commentators in this book—to the newly thought Romanticism that Johnson had herself reconfigured. Proceeding from Barbara Johnson’s own interest, beginning with her work on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, in the origination of new kinds of lineages—in previously unrecognized ways in which literature, and criticism, are engendered and reproduced—this volume thus provides fresh genealogical narratives of Barbara Johnson’s original vision and of an era of contemporary theory that profoundly altered our relation to our texts and to our lives. This collection thus proceeds by “circling back”—in the evocative phrase of Shoshana Felman from her “Afterword”—to the beginning of Johnson’s work on Mary Shelley and to the manner in which that work moves forward through the entirety of Johnson’s career and through her enduring\n\nForeword\n\nxiii\n\ninfluence on the world of criticism and theory. In so doing, these essays, as a collection, do for Barbara Johnson what Felman says Johnson does for Mary Shelley: they write “her impossible autobiography,” and thus provide a narrative group and a “circle of listening”1 that, like the listening of Mary Shelley near the fire on that rainy night of the famous ghost story contest—the writing competition that would lead to the creation of Frankenstein—becomes a generative moment and perpetuates the origination of a new genre of critical writing in which autobiography, theory, and literature are closely intertwined. The circle of women readers and writers in this book does not exactly reproduce or mimic that original circle at the fire (which, after reading Johnson’s Mary Shelley and her Circle, we cannot understand anymore as a single circle), nor do the women commentators in this book simply circle around Barbara Johnson, since in the process of reading her work they have been, unwittingly, pulled into a circle around Mary Shelley. Barbara Johnson, Mary Wilson Carpenter, Judith Butler, and Shoshana Felman indeed form, together, part of a circle of women listeners and writers that did not quite yet exist for Mary Shelley and even now may be less a completed circle than a call for others to join a future narrative and critical group. Johnson herself, with her satirical wit and—even in the face of her own imminent death—her refusal of excessive pathos, would perhaps characterize this collection in a less tendentious manner. In “Gender Theory and the Yale School”—included in this volume and discussed here by both Carpenter and Felman—Johnson draws attention to the male-­centeredness of the early volume Deconstruction and Criticism, which consisted of five male critics of the so-called “Yale School.” Johnson relates how, “at the time of the publication of . . . Deconstruction and Criticism, several of us—Shoshana Felman, Gayatri Spivak, Margaret Ferguson, and I—discussed the possibility of writing a companion volume inscribing female deconstructive protest and affirmation centering not on Percy B ­ ysshe Shelley’s ‘The Triumph of Life’ (as the existing volume was originally slated to do) but on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.”2 That female counter-manifesto, Johnson says, “might truly have illustrated the Girard­ian progression ‘from mimetic desire to the monstrous double.’ Unfortunately, this Bride of Deconstruction and Criticism never quite got off the ground.”3 Inspired here by the spark of Johnson’s still recent life, the women who write in this volume may finally have animated that long-forgotten monstrous Bride4—a vision of the book that, I am sure,\n\nxiv\n\nCathy Caruth\n\nthey would consider a compliment and that, as Johnson reminded us in her discussion of Dr. Frankenstein’s creation, also calls upon us to recognize its own inherent beauty. In reading this book we must, then, attend to the different interwoven strands of life, of death, of autobiography, of criticism, and of theory that make up the complex relationship between Barbara Johnson and Mary Shelley, and that constitute the subtle resonances between the insights of Johnson’s readers and her own foundational work. These writers, in a posthumous conversation with Barbara Johnson, also dramatize for us the emergence and evolution of a mode—or modes—of reading and thinking that have, collectively, produced a lasting impact on contemporary critical thought. Mary Shelley, as Barbara Johnson tells us in her last work—published here for the first time—tended first to the living Percy Bysshe Shelley and later to the dead one, a task that was truly, for her, a matter of the heart. The three women in this volume, who write so beautifully of Barbara Johnson’s life and work, also tended to Barbara Johnson in her life: both as interlocutors while she lived, and as friends and supporters at the end of her life. They now form a posthumous circle that precisely crosses between death and life—the lives and deaths of Mary Shelley and of Barbara Johnson—in order to transmit the revitalizing force of Barbara Johnson’s creativity, and singular originality, which cannot be exhausted by any genealogy, and cannot be reduced to any school or lineage. Barbara Johnson tells us that the ghost stories that had inspired the writing contest behind Frankenstein had to do with “the uncanniness of death,” but Mary Shelley’s novel was concerned with “what gave life.” This volume, too, occasioned by Johnson’s early death, is also, ultimately, about what gives life: in the work, and in the lives (and deaths), of the great women writers who are at its center. They are all, indeed, as Felman writes of Johnson, “theorists who became storytellers,” women who both write and narrate—who narrate a life as they write their critical and theoretical appraisals of another woman’s work—in order to pass on to us the spark of life communicated, across time and writing, from one woman in the circle to the next. May 2013\n\nMary Wilson Carpenter\n\nIntroduction Where to start speaking of the end? But on the other hand, isn’t it always from the end that one starts? Barbara Johnson\n\nThe quotation above is taken from “The Last Man,” an essay originally written in French for a 1980 colloquium held in Cerisy, France, and organized as a response to Jacques Derrida’s work, especially his essay “Les fins de l’homme.”1 In 1980 Johnson was an Assistant Professor of French and the Literature Major (an undergraduate program taught by faculty from Comparative Literature and other departments) at Yale, and already internationally known for her work in deconstructionist theory. Her dissertation, Défigurations du langage poétique: La seconde révolution ­baudelairienne (Paris: Flammarion), had been published in 1979, and her first English collection of essays, The Critical Difference: Essays in the Contemporary Rhetoric of Reading (Johns Hopkins University Press) was published in the same year as “Le dernier homme,” 1980. Her translation of Derrida’s 1972 work, La dissémination, would be published as Dissemination in 1981. But her essay on Mary Shelley’s novel The Last Man (1826), reprinted in this volume, was the beginning of her published writings on Mary Shelley. It marked her first publication in the field of “women’s studies,” one of whose areas was the rediscovery and critical analysis of works by women writers previously excluded from the academic canon. The last book manuscript she completed before her death in August 2009 was “Mary Shelley and Her Circle,” published here for the first time. Mary Shelley was thus the subject for Johnson’s beginning in feminist theory and criticism and also for her end. In “The Last Man,” she questions, “Why couldn’t such a story be entitled The Last Woman? . . . Would the idea that humanity could not end with a woman have something to do with the ends of man?”2 The idea xv\n\nxvi\n\nMary Wilson Carpenter\n\nthat a woman’s story, unless it was written for the “ends” of man, was somehow monstrous, unthinkable, had already emerged in her teaching at Yale. There, in a 1978 course titled “Man and His Fictions: Narrative Forms,” and team-taught with Peter Brooks, Barbara Guetti, and Joseph Halpern, Johnson had lectured in a course section titled “Life Stories” on Rousseau’s Confessions. The course included no texts by women writers in this year or the next, in which Johnson did not teach. In the fall of 1980, the course had been retitled as the gender-neutral “Narrative Forms.” Now team-taught by Johnson, David Marshall, and J. Hillis Miller, the section “Life Stories” included Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, and Johnson was the lecturer for this text. Seminar discussion compared Frankenstein and Rousseau’s Confessions as “life stories.” In her essay “The Last Man,” Johnson begins with Frankenstein, proposing that “to speak of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is immediately to approach the question of man indirectly through what has always been at once excluded and comprehended by its definition, namely, the woman and the monster” (p. 259). Citing Rousseau’s statement that “the most useful and least advanced of all human knowledge seems to me to be that of man,” Johnson suggests that Mary Shelley’s novel demonstrates on the contrary that “if one translates in this way the command to know oneself as a command to know man, one risks losing contact monstrously with what one doesn’t know” (p. 261). Johnson thus begins her first essay on Mary Shelley’s work with a comparison between Frankenstein and Rousseau’s writing as writing about “man and his fictions,” a project that seems to both critique and anticipate the teaching of the Yale course. She characterizes The Last Man as Mary Shelley’s “story of the one who remains” (p. 262). The narrator—the last survivor of a universal plague— is witness, survivor, scribe, or the same role Mary Shelley plays at the moment she writes her novel. Commenting that Mary Shelley’s life was also a series of survivals at the time of her writing of The Last Man (her mother had died in giving her birth, three of her own four children had died, Percy had drowned, and Byron had just died in Greece), Johnson suggests that “at the age of twenty-six, she considered herself the last relic of an extinct race” (p. 263). Mary Shelley paints her own mourning on “a universal scale” (p. 263). But since that universal scale was the one which characterized the writings of the Romantic poets, she “does more than give a universal vision of her mourning; she mourns for a certain type of universal vision” (p. 263). Beyond mourning, however, “the image of a\n\nIntroduction\n\nxvii\n\ncertain conception of man . . . will be progressively demystified throughout the novel that follows . . . The story of The Last Man is in the last analysis the story of modern Western man torn between mourning and deconstruction” (p. 265). With this insightful reading of Mary Shelley’s apocalyptic novel, Johnson leads the way in the then emerging field of Mary Shelley studies by proposing that her work mounts a deconstructive critique of Romanticism. Anne K. Mellor, in her introduction to the 1993 edition of The Last Man, which includes Johnson’s essay in its bibliography, comments that Mary Shelley articulates “a critique so total that the novel becomes the first literary example of what we now call deconstruction.”3 Esther Schor, in her introduction to The Cambridge Companion to Mary Shelley (2003), describes Frankenstein as “the century’s most blistering critique of Romantic egotism.”4 At the time of Johnson’s essay on The Last Man, this and Frankenstein were the only two of Mary Shelley’s novels in print. The Last Man had been published by the University of Nebraska Press, edited by Hugh J. Luke, Jr., in 1965. In the same year the Signet Classic paperback edition of Frankenstein, an edition widely used for teaching purposes, was first published. This edition reprints the 1831 third edition of the novel, published some thirteen years after the first edition and nine years after Percy ­Bysshe Shelley’s death. It was for the 1831 edition that Shelley wrote her now famous “Author’s Introduction” characterizing the novel as “my hideous progeny.” The 1965 Signet Classic edition—the only edition ever cited by Johnson—also contains an “Afterword” by Harold Bloom. Bloom’s explanation of what makes Frankenstein an important book, “though it is only a strong, flawed novel with frequent clumsiness in its narrative and characterization” is that “it contains one of the most vivid versions we have of the Romantic mythology of the self, one that resembles Blake’s Book of Urizen, Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound, and Byron’s Manfred,” and that it was precisely because Mary Shelley’s novel “lacks the sophistication and imaginative complexity of such works, [that] Frankenstein affords a unique introduction to the archetypal world of the Romantics” (p. 215). Bloom’s 1965 statement was only a pithy summary of the general view of most Frankenstein critics at the time. In her 1988 critical biography, Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters, Mellor notes that “­before Ellen Moers’s ground-breaking discussion of Frankenstein in The New York Review of Books in 1973, literary scholars and critics had for the most part discussed\n\nxviii\n\nMary Wilson Carpenter\n\nMary Shelley’s career merely as an appendage to her husband’s, dismissing Frankenstein as a badly written children’s book even though far more people were familiar with her novel than with Percy Shelley’s poetry.”5 By the time of Johnson’s writing of “Le dernier homme,” however, some revolutionary feminist readings of Frankenstein had appeared. In addition to Moers’s Literary Women (1976), which included her reading of the novel as an instance of “Female Gothic,” a “phantasmagoria of the nursery,” Marc A. Rubenstein’s “‘My Accursed Origin’: The Search for the Mother in Frank­enstein” had appeared in Studies in Romanticism (Spring 1976).6 Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar had published The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), whose chapter “Horror’s Twin: Mary Shelley’s Monstrous Eve” identifies the monster, though created male, as “a female in disguise,” a figure for the author’s sense of namelessness and deformity.7 George Levine and U. C. Knoepflmacher’s critical anthology The Endurance of Frankenstein (1979) included Knoepflmacher’s much-cited essay “Thoughts on the Aggression of Daughters,” as well as other feminist critical essays on the novel.8 In 1980, the same year in which Johnson published “Le dernier homme,” her colleague at Yale Mary Poovey published “My Hideous Progeny: Mary Shelley and the Feminization of Romanticism” in PMLA.9 Johnson’s position at Yale when she wrote “Le dernier homme” was probably central to her decision to both teach and write on Mary ­Shelley. As described in the Foreword to this volume, she and some of her Yale feminist colleagues tossed around the notion of writing a female ­counter-manifesto to the Yale School’s entirely male-centered Deconstruction and Criticism, centered on Frankenstein rather than Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “The Triumph of Life.” Though that idea never quite got off the ground, Johnson refers to it in “Le dernier homme,” commenting that “perhaps it was not Frankenstein but rather The Last Man, Mary Shelley’s grim depiction of the gradual extinction of humanity altogether, that would have made a fit counterpart to ‘The Triumph of Life.’ Percy Bysshe Shelley is entombed in both, along with a certain male fantasy of Romantic universality. The only universality that remains in Mary Shelley’s last novel is the plague” (p. 33).10 Johnson was also active at Yale in the Women’s Studies Program. After the admission of women as undergraduates in 1969, momentum gathered to include women’s studies in the curriculum. By 1976 the Women’s Studies Task Force was formed, and in May 1979 the Yale faculty approved the institution of the Women’s Studies Program. Johnson was included\n\nIntroduction\n\nxix\n\nas one of the “Core Faculty” along with Silvia Arrom, Nancy Cott (who became program chair in 1980), Faye Crosby, Margaret Homans, Lydia Kung, Catherine MacKinnon, Susan Olzak, and Mary Poovey.11 Janet Todd was later to describe Yale as one of two institutions (the other was Princeton) that could boast more than one major feminist critic, naming Barbara Johnson, Shoshana Felman, and Margaret Homans, though Todd did not feel that either Yale or Princeton could be described as a “feminist establishment.”12 Felman’s foundational feminist essay, “Women and Madness: The Critical Phallacy,” was first published in 1975.13 Homans published her groundbreaking Women Writers and Poetic Identity: Dorothy Wordsworth, Emily Brontë, and Emily Dickinson in 1980.14 Johnson’s now classic essay on Frankenstein, “My Monster/My Self,” was published in a feminist issue of diacritics, “Cherchez La Femme: Feminist Critique/Feminine Text,” edited by Cynthia Chase, Nelly Furman, and Mary Jacobus, in 1982.15 But this was not the first time Johnson had appeared as a feminist critic in an American academic journal. Critical Inquiry had published a feminist issue the preceding year, Winter 1981, and the “Editor’s Introduction” begins with a quotation from Johnson’s The Critical Difference: If human beings were not divided into two biological sexes, there would probably be no need for literature. And if literature could truly say what the relations between the sexes are, we would doubtless not need much of it then, either . . . It is not the life of sexuality that literature cannot capture; it is literature that inhabits the very heart of what makes sexuality problematic for us speaking animals. Literature is not only a thwarted investigator but also an incorrigible perpetrator of the problem of sexuality.16\n\nFor Elizabeth Abel, Johnson’s thesis here represents the turn in deconstructive criticism from “notions of textual difference” to “the complexities of sexual difference,” which, though “more pervasively engrained in our culture, have largely been confined to the edges of critical debate” (Writing and Sexual Difference, p. 1). Johnson herself, however, having dissected the Yale School’s gender politics in “Gender Theory and the Yale School,” gleefully applies her critical scalpel to her own work: In order to end with a meditation on a possible female version of the Yale School, I would like now to turn to the work of a Yale daughter. For this purpose I have chosen to focus on The Critical Difference by Barbara Johnson. What happens when one raises Mary Jacobus’s question: ‘Is there a woman in\n\nxx\n\nMary Wilson Carpenter this text?’ The answer is rather surprising. For no book produced by the Yale School seems to have excluded women as effectively as The Critical Difference. No women authors are studied. Almost no women critics are cited. And, what is even more surprising, there are almost no female characters in any of the stories analyzed. Billy Budd, however triangulated, is a tale of three men in a boat. . . . In a book that announces itself as a study of difference, the place of the woman is constantly being erased. (World of Difference, p. 39)\n\nNevertheless, she acknowledges that “this does not mean, however, that the question of sexual difference does not haunt the book from the beginning” (p. 39). Quoting the same passage quoted in Abel’s introduction, Johnson sees The Critical Difference as able only to describe “the escape of the difference it attempts to analyze” (p. 40). Johnson, according to Diane Long Hoeveler, was “one of the first American critics to link feminism and deconstruction.” What Hoeveler finds most interesting in Johnson’s reading of Frankenstein is “her recognition of the novel as dominated by its ‘description of a primal scene of creation . . . where do babies come from? And where do stories come from? In both cases, the scene of creation is described, but the answer to these questions is still withheld.’”17 She quotes Johnson’s generative perception that “Frankenstein, in other words, can be read as the story of the experience of writing Frankenstein” (World of Difference, p. 49). Perhaps even more interesting, however, is the fact that Johnson both begins and ends her essay with the question of autobiography, specifically the monstrosity of female autobiography. She begins with the statement that “to judge from recent trends in scholarly as well as popular literature, three crucial questions can be seen to stand at the forefront of today’s preoccupations: the question of mothering, the question of the woman writer, and the question of autobiography” (World of Difference, p. 144). Tellingly, her reflection begins with a comment on popular as well as scholarly literature: the essay—which is actually composed as a review essay of Nancy Friday’s My Mother/My Self (1977) and Dorothy Dinnerstein’s The Mermaid and the Minotaur (1976), against which Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is juxtaposed—demonstrates her grounding in the “real world,” or that figurative term which, as she comments in her introduction to A World of Difference, denotes nothing other than “perceptions of the boundaries of institutions” (p. 3). Reading all three books together from her position in view of those boundaries, she works out her stunning analysis of Frankenstein as Mary Shelley’s monstrous autobiography, the\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxi\n\nwoman writer’s story of giving birth to her “hideous progeny.” The monstrousness of female autobiography, she concludes, is due to “the fact of self-contradiction that is so vigorously repressed in women” (p. 153). In all three of the books discussed, “the monstrousness of selfhood is intimately embedded within the question of female autobiography” (p. 154). And how could it be otherwise, she ponders, since the very shape of human life stories has always been modeled on the man? “Rousseau’s—or any man’s—autobiography consists in the story of the difficulty of conforming to the standard of what a man should be. The problem for the female autobiographer is, on the one hand, to resist the pressure of masculine autobiography as the only literary genre available for her enterprise, and, on the other, to describe a difficulty in conforming to a female ideal which is largely a fantasy of the masculine, not the feminine, imagination” (p. 154). It seems clear, in other words, that “My Monster/My Self ” was gestated in the Yale course that was originally conceived as “Man and His Fictions: Narrative Forms.” In 1982–83, Johnson was a Fellow at the Mary I. Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College in Harvard University. Feminist theory was electrifying the academic world at this point, and the Cambridge-Boston area was particularly explosive. So many feminist talks, lectures, meetings, films, conferences, and other events were being held in the numerous academic institutions in the metro Boston area that Ruth Perry, founding director of the Women’s Studies Program at MIT, began compiling and publishing a monthly newsletter titled “Women’s Studies Around Boston” in 1984. The Boston Area Colloquium on Feminist Theory was first held at Northeastern University in the spring of 1982. By 1983–84, when Johnson began her career as a Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature at Harvard, the third colloquium series was being held, now cosponsored by Harvard and Wellesley. The battle to establish women’s studies programs and to include women writers in such already established departments as Afro-American studies, as well as English and other modern language departments, was being fought on multiple academic fronts, including that of Harvard. Dean Henry Rosovsky established the Committee on Women’s Studies in 1978, initially chaired by Edward Keenan, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In late 1983, Dean Keenan appointed Professor Susan ­Suleiman of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures as Chair of the Committee, to take office in 1985. In September\n\nxxii\n\nMary Wilson Carpenter\n\n1984, Johnson was Acting Chair of the Committee, and she and ­Suleiman worked together to plan a degree-granting program, coordinating courses throughout the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that included a “gender component,” and also finding funding for lectures and symposia.18 In 1985, the Committee on Women’s Studies at Harvard and the Women’s Studies Program at MIT jointly sponsored a conference on pornography that occasioned intense debate from feminists “of different viewpoints,” most notably Women Against Pornography and the Feminists Against Censorship Task Force.19 From 1991 to 1993, Johnson was Chair of the Committee on Women’s Studies at Harvard, in which she was succeeded by Suleiman in 1993 and in 1995 by Alice Jardine of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. This era also saw the beginning of Johnson’s work on African American women writers. In the fall of 1983 she taught her first course, “Black Women Writers.” There were no women faculty in the Afro-American Studies Department at that point, and Johnson’s course pioneered the teaching of black women writers at Harvard. She offered a course with this title again in 1985 and one titled “African American Women Writers” in 1990, as well as a course titled “The Slave Narrative” in 1995. From 1990 to 1991, she was Chair of the Department of Afro-American Studies, where she vigorously promoted the hiring of new faculty members. In 1984 she published “Metaphor, Metonymy and Voice in Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God ” in Black Literature and Literary Theory, edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and in 1985 a second essay on Hurston, “Thresholds of Difference: Structures of Address in Zora Neale Hurston,” was published in Critical Inquiry and reprinted in Race, Writing, and Difference, also edited by Gates.20 In the fall of 1995, Johnson taught an undergraduate seminar at Harvard titled “Mary Shelley and Her Circle.” By this time, critical interest in Mary Shelley had mushroomed. More than half of all students of Romanticism now read Frankenstein; the novel was a staple in such courses as “The Gothic,” “Women’s Literature,” and “The Post-Human”; and it was included in both The Norton Anthology of English Literature and The Longman Anthology of British Literature, the leading undergraduate anthologies.21 MLA Approaches to Teaching Shelley’s “Frankenstein” had been published in 1990.22 Both scholarly and paperback editions of Mary Shelley’s other novels and short fictions had become available (Schor, pp. 1–2). Complete editions of Mary Shelley’s letters and journals had also been\n\nxxiv\n\nMary Wilson Carpenter\n\npublished. Johnson’s essay “Le dernier homme,” now published in E ­ nglish translation as “The Last Man” in The Other Mary Shelley: Beyond Frankenstein (1993), had begun to surface in the fertile field of Mary Shelley studies. Johnson’s second essay on Mary Shelley, “My Monster/My Self,” had been reprinted in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1987), edited by Harold Bloom, and was widely quoted.23 It was to be reprinted the following year in the Norton Critical Edition of Frankenstein.24 The syllabus for Johnson’s course (reproduced below) included readings in the work of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and William Godwin, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron, and “poor Polidori,” Byron’s physician who later committed suicide. The course was designed to present Mary Shelley not as an appendage to the “great Romantics,” but as a major writer whose work deserved to be studied in itself, as well as in its intersections with that of her illustrious parents, husband, and other members of the famous literary “circle” among whom she lived and wrote—and all of whom she long survived. In 2009, Johnson, now disabled by a progressive neurological condition which had forced her retirement from teaching, worked on “Mary Shelley and Her Circle” (she had already completed several other books post-retirement, including a translation of Mallarmé’s Divagations (2007), Persons and Things (2008), and Moses and Multiculturalism (published posthumously in 2010). Mary Shelley and Her Circle is in essence a long reflective essay on this other “last woman,” this other woman surviving beyond or outside her literary circle. Johnson explores Mary Shelley’s relations to the mother who died giving her birth and to her radical feminist works, to her philosopher-novelist father and his ambivalent treatment of his feminist wife’s daughter, and most especially to Mary Shelley’s complex and difficult relation to her narcissistic husband, who continually sought and received all kinds of adoration and celebration that inevitably relegated Mary to the margins. Byron and his short-lived physician Polidori also figure in this strange circle that surrounded Mary Shelley at the point at which she produced her “hideous progeny.” The book, like so much of Johnson’s work, seems to emerge directly from her teaching. At times it displays an almost conspiratorial tone, as if initiating students into the hitherto unknown realm of the haunted woman writer and her haunting productions. At other moments, Johnson presents with deadpan humor the unvarnished truths of both sexual and textual inter­ sections in Mary Shelley’s circle. Ultimately, Johnson proposes, Mary Shelley desired to become what Percy Bysshe Shelley had been, a god-like\n\nIntroduction\n\nxxv\n\nsole creator, “someone capable of having progeny alone” (Epilogue, p. 8). Although Johnson did not intend this book to be her last work, the book ties together a continuing thread in her work that began in 1980, while she was still an assistant professor at Yale, and that continued to engage her thought throughout her life. It is a fitting subject for the final work of Barbara Johnson, famed scholar and beloved teacher who eagerly joined in the crucial work of lifting other women writers out of obscurity and into those literary circles where still other students of women’s lives and literature could learn to know them.\n\nA LIFE WITH MA RY SHE LLEY\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nThe Last Man 1\n\nWhen considering a subject as broad as “the ends of man,” one can only ask oneself: Where to start? Where to start speaking of the end? But on the other hand, isn’t it always from the end that one starts? Isn’t every narrative in fact constructed beginning with the denouement, as every project is constructed beginning with its goal? Isn’t the end precisely that which never ceases to be repeated, which one is never done with? If man is truly, as Derrida says, “that which relates to its end,” he is also that which is never finished with ending. Thus the question would not be to know how to begin speaking of the end, but how to finish speaking of it, how to narrate something other than the interminable death of the penultimate, how to be finished with the end? This is perhaps the question that Nietzsche poses in Human, All-TooHuman when he writes, under the heading of “First and Last Things,” “We look at everything through the human head and cannot cut this head off; while the question remains, What would be left of the world if it had been cut off?”2 The end of man would seem then to be that which cannot be lived by any man. But what exactly is “human” in Nietzsche’s statement, “we look at everything through the human head”? The human, here, is apparently something that says “we.” And what if men were reduced only to “I”? Would the word “man” still have the same meaning if there were only one left? Would the end of man take place before or after the death of the last man? Would the final cut take place only after the death of the last man, or would it consist of his testimony, his unprecedented experience of survival? In other words, what would be the relation between the last representative of the human race and the end of man? 3\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nIt is the limit-narrative of decapitation, of the cutting off of the human head with which we look at all things, that Mary Shelley attempted in a novel entitled The Last Man. This very long narrative, written by a woman whose birth coincides with the bloodiest moments of the French Revolution, is one of the first versions of the idea—which has become so commonplace in our atomic age—of the total extinction of the human species. Postrevolutionary but preatomic, this prophetic novel could perhaps tell us something about the strange temporality of the end of man. In fact, in the current context Mary Shelley merits our interest in more than one respect. If she risks appearing somewhat marginal today, it’s precisely her marginality that has always earned her a certain celebrity. That marginality was of two kinds: one, she lived surrounded by writers whose works strongly marked the thought and literature of the epoch: her father, William Godwin, liberal philosopher and author of Political Justice; her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman; her husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Romantic poet and disciple of Godwin; and the many friends of Shelley, in particular the poet Byron. Aside from this marginality in the very center of the Romantic circle, Mary Shelley knew a second sort of famous nonexistence as the anonymous author of Frankenstein, a novel that she wrote at the age of nineteen and whose mythic power has only increased since, independently of the name and even the notion of the author. In the shadow of her parents, her husband, and her own work, Mary Shelley thus lived the Romantic period through its folds and margins. If I put the accent in this way on her marginality, it’s not in order to discover for her a new centrality, but in order to analyze the new manner in which the question of marginality is inscribed in and agitates her work. To speak of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is immediately to approach the question of man indirectly through what has always been at once excluded and comprehended by its definition, namely, the woman and the monster. It’s undoubtedly not an accident if the conjunction of these two categories of beings has traversed history under the reassuring form of fables of the “beauty and the beast” genre—which always end by confirming the superior glory of man, since the beast is transformed into a man with whom the woman falls in love. In Frankenstein, the end of the story is far from reassuring, but it is precisely because the monster is not monstrous enough. Frankenstein, as everyone knows, is the story of a scientist who, trying to create a man in his laboratory, succeeds in manufacturing a monstrous\n\nThe Last Man\n\n\n\nbeing who ends up turning against his creator. It’s the creator who is called “Frankenstein” and not the monster, who has no name, but the universal tendency to call the monster by the name of its creator is far from insignificant. Contrary to what the cinematic versions of Frankenstein have led us to believe, Mary Shelley’s monster is not manufactured with a criminal’s brain, and its creator is not crazy. Aside from a certain physical ugliness, Shelley’s monster is the exact realization of the dream of its creator, to whom the project of discovering the secrets of life and of making use of them to manufacture a man had seemed the consummation of science and an inestimable benefit for humanity. But there is one detail which the creator had not foreseen: his own reaction to his creature. When he sees the yellowish eye of the one he had constructed and animated with so much effort open, Frankenstein is seized with horror and flees from the laboratory, abandoning the giant newborn to his fate. This creature whose features are roughly sutured but whose heart is good tries to find a place among men, but men always reject him with horror. Choosing to reside in the shadow of a country cottage, unknown to its inhabitants, the monster acquires a full humanist education by listening to the French lessons given by the country folk to an Arab woman. The monster, who has developed a tender sympathy for these country people, finally tries to win recognition from them, but like all human beings, they are incapable of enduring his monstrous appearance. Made furious by loneliness, the monster leaves in search of his creator, whose youngest brother he strangles when he unluckily turns up along the way. When the monster finds Frankenstein, in the shadow of Mont Blanc, he tells him his story and begs his creator to make him a wife of the same species as himself. Touched in spite of himself, Frankenstein the creator agrees to the monster’s request and sets about gathering the necessary materials for this new piece of work. But suddenly the image of a new, monstrous Eve forces itself upon him and, frightened by his vision, Frankenstein ends up destroying the rough draft of the female monster. The monster, who has watched this entire process, will never forgive him for the destruction of his mate. Instead of attacking his creator directly, he murders, one after another, all those who are dear to Frankenstein, until the creator is reduced to the same isolation as his creature. If Mary Shelley thus elaborates a work of science fiction which seems to caution us against the fictions of science, it is not, however, only in order to suggest that there are limits which man has no right to overstep. For far from marking the limits of the human, Shelley’s monster is noth-\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\ning but the perfect realization of the humanist project par excellence: mastery of the knowledge of man. The chemical details of Frankenstein’s experiment are only the literalization of the desire to give oneself a total representation of man, to master the origins of man to the point of being able to create one. The monster is thus not what remains exterior to the humanist conception of man; it is the figure of that conception itself to the extent that “man” is precisely a creation of man. This perfectly reasonable monster, whose wickedness is entirely explained by the injustices that are inflicted on him, is a perfect example of man such as he was created by the Enlightenment philosophes, for whom the human being par excellence was Western, rational, and masculine. It’s no accident if the humanist-creator can’t or doesn’t want to create a woman equal to her man, or if the monster’s education is presented as a Westernization. (The lessons he overhears are those given by Europeans to an Arab woman. It is also interesting to note that, in order to recover from the shock of the catastrophic creation, Frankenstein begins to study, precisely, Oriental languages.) Thus if Mary Shelley’s novel constitutes a critique of humanism, that critique is directed not against the hubris of the humanist who takes himself for God, but against the blindness of the humanist who can’t see himself. In gathering and sewing materials with the design of creating a human, Frankenstein never doubts for an instant that he knows what a human is. But the creature only has to open his eyes, the object only has to become subject for Frankenstein not to recognize him anymore and for him literally to lose consciousness (or knowledge— “connaissance”—Tr.). The unknown is not located in the object of humanism, but in the desiring humanist subject. That which the humanist remains blind to in his efforts to know man is the nature of his own desire to know man. That blindness is moreover represented within the novel by the total lack of explanation concerning the motives which led the creator to reject his creature so violently. This explanatory ellipsis has always been considered a grave defect in the novel by readers who were looking to follow the psychological logic. But it is precisely by this sort of logical flaw, this blind spot in the explanation of human desire, that something like psychology can be elaborated. The humanist’s blindness in relation to his own desire to know is illustrated in an exemplary way by Rousseau in the preface to his Discourse on the Origin and Causes of Inequality Among Men, by the way in which he understands the meaning of the inscription of Delphi, “The most useful and\n\nThe Last Man\n\n\n\nthe least advanced of all human knowledge seems to me to be that of man; and I dare say that the inscription of the temple of Delphi alone contained a precept more important and more difficult than all the thick volumes of the moralists.”3 As opposed to Rousseau’s project, the story of Frankenstein seems to affirm that if one translates in this way the command to know oneself as a command to know man, one risks losing contact monstrously with what one doesn’t know. Curiously, in the article by Jacques Derrida on “The Ends of Man,” one finds in an unexpected way this idea of monstrosity linked to the critique of a tradition deformed by a humanist view: After the war, under the name of . . . existentialism . . . , the thought that dominated France presented itself essentially as humanist. . . . [T]he major concept, the theme of the last analysis, the irreducible horizon and origin is what was then called “human reality.” As is well-known, this is a translation of Heideggerian Dasein. A monstrous translation in many respects, but so much the more significant.4\n\nWould this Derridean monster be the modern reincarnation of Shelley’s monster? Would monstrosity always exist as a function of humanist translation? Are there nonhumanist monsters? nonmonstrous translations? In our day the myth of Frankenstein is ceaselessly invoked by the newspapers apropos of babies conceived in a test tube and, more recently, apropos of the creation of new forms of bacteria by the recombination of their genetic codes. In the context of debates over the commercial and juridical status of these new forms of life, the question of man finds itself curiously reopened. Having to decide whether the law governing the distribution of patents applied or not to the invention of living beings, the Supreme Court of the United States decreed that life was indeed susceptible to be patented since, in the words of former Chief Justice Burger (quoted in Time), “the issue is ‘not between living and inanimate things, but between products of nature—whether living or not—and human-made inventions.’”5 In other words, it’s the opposition between man and nature which here takes over from the worn-out opposition between life and death. All the more so in that, in our day, the legal status of death is itself submitted to the opposition between natural means and technological means of maintaining life. Thus if man is indeed that which is determined beginning with his end, his end is, more and more, that which can be determined only beginning with man.\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nThis question of man suspended between life and death returns us finally to that second untimely meditation of Mary Shelley—untimely for her time but ardently timely for our own—namely, her other novel entitled precisely The Last Man. While Frankenstein was the story of the one who was superfluous in the world of men, The Last Man is the story of the one who is superfluous in a world without men. It’s the story of the one who remains. Now, what does this remainder of humanity signify in relation to the question of the ends of man? But first of all, a question is indispensable: Why couldn’t such a story be entitled The Last Woman ? Or rather, why is it that a novel entitled The Last Woman would be automatically interpreted—as one sees in the film of that title by Marco Ferreri—as the story of the last love of a man or else as a narrative of castration? Would the idea that humanity could not end with a woman have something to do with the ends of man? In reality, although the narrator of this book speaks in the first person masculine singular, he belongs, like the monster, to a sort of third sex. He resembles neither the men nor the women of the novel. He serves the function of witness, of survivor, and of scribe. As we will see, it is the same role that Mary Shelley plays at the moment when she writes her novel. The story of The Last Man takes place in Europe near the end of the twenty-first century. The main characters are few: aside from the narrator Lionel Verney and his sister Perdita, we count Adrian and Idris, children of the last king of England; Lord Raymond, hero of the Greek wars; and Evadne Zaimi, a Greek princess who lives in England. In the year 2073, the king of England, father of Adrian and Idris, abdicates to permit the creation of an English republic. The royal family withdraws to Windsor. After many sentimental and political vicissitudes, the narrator Verney marries Idris, the former king’s daughter; the hero Raymond marries ­Perdita, sister of the narrator; Adrian, who had been in love with the princess Evadne, remains alone; and Evadne, in love with Raymond, disappears. Raymond, for whom the tranquil life at Windsor begins to be a burden, gets elected Lord Protector of England and throws himself immediately into innumerable projects for the good of humanity. By a series of accidents, Raymond rediscovers the Greek princess Evadne, reduced to a life of misery and still in love with him. Raymond, who tries to remedy her misery, doesn’t speak of the princess to his wife Perdita, but she nevertheless begins to suspect something. As the misunderstanding between the spouses becomes irreparable, Raymond resigns his post and\n\nThe Last Man\n\n\n\nleaves England to join the Greek army once again. The Greeks are about to achieve victory over the Turks; the Greek army needs only to take Constantinople. The Greeks besiege the city. But the besieged city becomes more and more silent. Constantinople has fallen under the sway of the Plague. The armies separate without combat, making way for a plagueridden peace. England once again becomes the scene of the action. For several years, the English believe themselves sheltered from the Plague that devastates the entire Orient. But little by little this scourge takes over Europe and England until the last English survivors decide to leave their island to wait for death in a gentler climate. At every step, the circle of the survivors is circumscribed, but nothing stops the progress of the Plague, which is always fatal. Verney, the narrator, is the only one among all human beings to recover from it. He is thus more than a survivor; he is a ghost. When humanity is reduced to three beings—Raymond, Adrian, and the daughter of Raymond and Perdita—these three survivors decide to embark on a sailing ship for Greece. The boat is shipwrecked; Verney remains alone. Searching for a fellow creature, he goes to Rome, where he spends a year writing and waiting. Finally convinced that no one will come meet him in Rome, he climbs to the top of St. Peter’s to carve in stone the following inscription: “the aera 2100, last year of the world.” Then, accompanied only by his dog, he embarks for unknown shores. The life of Mary Shelley was also a series of survivals. Beginning with her birth, which cost her mother her life. At the moment when Mary Shelley wrote The Last Man, three of her four children had died, her husband Percy Shelley had drowned in a shipwreck, and Byron had just died in Greece. At the age of twenty-six, she considered herself the last relic of an extinct race. One could thus affirm that in writing The Last Man Mary Shelley only painted her mourning on a universal scale. But that universal scale, that universal perspective on human affairs was just the one which ordinarily characterized the writings of the Romantic poets, especially those of Shelley and Byron. Thus Mary Shelley takes over a typically Romantic style in order to say what she sees as the end of Romanticism. In other words, in this novel, Mary Shelley does more than give a universal vision of her mourning; she mourns for a certain type of universal vision. For that vision is precisely that of Verney and his companions. In going to seek other survivors in Rome, birthplace of homo humanus, Mary\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nShelley’s last man performs the humanist gesture par excellence: he seeks to live the death of all of humanity. On his way, he leaves two kinds of messages, two sorts of “please forward”: first, in three languages, he writes, “Verney, last of the race of Englishmen, had taken up his abode in Rome”; second, in Italian, “Friend, come! I wait for thee.” To speak of oneself in the third person of the past tense is to take oneself for a historical character, that is, a dead man. To make an invitation in the second person, in the other’s language, is still to expect to live. But after a year of vain waiting in Rome, Verney realizes that he doesn’t know how to speak the other’s language anymore, for he doesn’t know any longer who the other might be. It becomes clear that all roads lead to Rome only for a certain Western culture which can no longer take itself for the voice of humanity in its entirety. In leaving Rome to seek an unknown otherness, Verney also stops writing. In designating the year of his departure the last year of the world, the last man thus marks the survival of humanist discourse, that is, of the possibility of making history. And yet, in setting off to wander in search of an unknown destiny, smitten with a culture that he knows to be obsolete, but incapable of forging for himself a postplague discourse, Verney could not symbolize better the very condition of modern Western man. How indeed can one survive humanism? How can one create a language that is postplague, that is, postuniversal? But what does the Plague signify in this book? In The Plague, Albert Camus writes, “In this respect our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn’t a thing made to man’s measure.”6 It is evident that, for Mary Shelley as well, the Plague is that which man’s measures can neither foresee nor master. All systems for the amelioration of man’s lot pass in review in this novel, only to end in a blind alley in front of the Plague. The Plague is at once that which stops all systems of meaning from functioning and that against which those systems are necessarily erected. But just before having them swallowed up by the scourge, Mary Shelley outlines a critique of each of the projects of reform dear to her father William Godwin and her husband Percy Shelley. In other words, each time we are about to draw a lesson from the narrative of political events, the Plague arrives to erase the question. The book does indeed contain a series of critiques, but there is no relation between these critiques and the train of events. The Plague itself seems neither entirely unavoidable nor\n\nThe Last Man\n\n\n\nentirely avoidable. Where the poet Percy Shelley, apropos of the French Revolution, spoke of an inadequacy, a “defect of correspondence between the knowledge existing in society and the improvement or gradual abolition of political institutions,”7 Mary Shelley sees not a defect of correspondence but a lack of relation between acquired knowledge and the scene of action. But the Plague is not only that which stops us from drawing lessons from human events. For it enters the plot at a very precise and significant moment of the novel. The Western world is about to fend off definitively the threat of the East. The Greeks need only to take Constantinople for victory to be complete. But the capture of Constantinople will never happen. Where Western man expects to encounter and to master his other, he finds himself faced with the absolute Other. The novel never tells us the political consequences of this suspension of the final confrontation between East and West. The question of the relation or of the nonrelation between East and West remains open, precisely by the way in which it is badly posed. The Plague, which extends out over the entire world from the point of encounter between East and West, is thus in a sense that which replaces the victory of the West over the East. Its lethal universality is a nightmarish version of the desire to establish a universal discourse, to spread equality and fraternity throughout the world. Thus the universal empire of the Plague would not be only, as Camus suggests, what is excluded from Western humanism; it would also be its inverted image. It is not an accident if The Last Man begins with praise of England, that England which was mistress of the world’s most powerful empire: I am the native of a sea-surrounded nook, a cloud-enshadowed land, which, when the surface of the globe, with its shoreless ocean and trackless continents, presents itself to my mind, appears only as an inconsiderable speck in the immense whole; and yet, when balanced in the scale of mental power, far outweighed countries of larger extent and more numerous population. So true it is, that man’s mind alone was the creator of all that was good or great to man, and that Nature herself was only his first minister. England, seated far north in the turbid sea, now visits my dreams in the semblance of a vast and well-manned ship, which mastered the winds and rode proudly over the waves. In my boyish days she was the universe to me. When I stood on my native hills . . . the earth’s very centre was fixed for me in that spot, and the rest of her orb was as a fable, to have forgotten which would have cost neither my imagination nor understanding an effort.8\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nThis image of England as mental mastery, inviolable insularity, self-­ sufficient centrality, is in fact the image of a certain conception of man which will be progressively demystified throughout the novel that follows. But this pitiless demystification is narrated as a series of privations and unendurable sorrows. At each step, one loses again a fatherland which never existed. The story of The Last Man is in the last analysis the story of modern Western man torn between mourning and deconstruction. In a certain sense, one can say that modern literature begins with this end of man, at the moment when the last man leaves Rome without knowing what language to speak to it. It is interesting to note that in the novel by Maurice Blanchot also entitled The Last Man, one no longer finds any traditional narrative landmarks. Even the certainty that this is indeed a narrative is acquired only in the form of a strange joy, on the last page of the book, “Later, he asked himself how he had entered the calm. He couldn’t talk about it with himself. Only joy at feeling he was in harmony with the words: ‘Later, he. . . . ’”9 In this end of the book, it’s thus a certain relation to language which ends by at once confirming and denying the end, solitude, the possibility of speaking. Before this last page, Blanchot’s book presents itself as a monologue cut into two unequal parts. In the first part, there is an “I,” a “he,” and a “she” who find themselves in a sort of asylum. After the break between the two parts, the word “event” appears, but the reader no longer knows who is speaking, nor to whom, nor of whom, nor of what event. In other words, in Blanchot’s Last Man all that remains of traditional “lastmanism” is the questions which the theme obliges us automatically to ask. For a book entitled The Last Man is manifestly an impossible book. If the last man is a “he,” who is writing the book? If the last man is an “I,” who is reading it? Unless the reader is dead . . . But the reader is inscribed in Mary Shelley’s book precisely as dead. At the moment when Verney decides to write the story of the end of man, he begins with the following dedication: TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD. SHADOWS, ARISE, AND READ YOUR FALL! BEHOLD THE HISTORY OF THE LAST MAN.\n\nIf man is the one to whom the end is important, it is evident that Verney possesses the most important story that has ever been told. But those to\n\nThe Last Man\n\n\n\nwhom that story is important are all necessarily dead. In a certain sense, the story of the end interests only the dead. For to the living, what matters isn’t the end, but the future perfect. Indeed, from the title on, The Last Man presents itself as a particularly striking example of the functioning of the future perfect. While normally the future perfect is the tense itself where the meaning of a story is tied up, The Last Man promises the reader only a future in which he will not be able to have read the novel. By his reading, the reader only approaches retrospectively his own elimination, while the last man continues beyond his end. But the temporality of this narrative is further complicated by a supplementary fold, an author’s introduction which tells us that this story of the last man that we have under our eyes is in reality only the imperfect and doubtless deformed translation of certain inscriptions found in 1818 on scattered leaves in the cavern of the Sybil of Cumae. What is at issue is thus a translation made in the nineteenth century of a prophecy uttered in Antiquity which takes the form of a narrative written by a man of the twenty-first century on the subject of the end of man. The end of man, in other words, will have always already coincided with the moment of predicting, the moment of translating, and the moment of writing. Unless, however, this is an error of translation.\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nMy Monster/My Self\n\nTo judge from recent trends in scholarly as well as popular literature, three crucial questions can be seen to stand at the forefront of today’s preoccupations: the question of mothering, the question of the woman writer, and the question of autobiography. Although these questions and current discussions of them often appear unrelated to each other, it is my intention here to explore some ways in which the three questions are profoundly interrelated. To attempt to shed some new light on each by approaching it via the others, I shall base my remarks upon two twentieth-century theoretical studies—Nancy Friday’s My Mother/ My Self and Dorothy Dinnerstein’s The Mermaid and the Minotaur—and one ­nineteenth-century gothic novel, Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, written by Mary Shelley, whose importance for literary history has until quite recently been considered to arise not from her own writings but from the fact that she was the second wife of poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and the daughter of the political philosopher William Godwin and the pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft.1 All three of these books, in strikingly diverse ways, offer a critique of the institution of parenthood. The Mermaid and the Minotaur is an analysis of the damaging effects of the fact that human infants are cared for almost exclusively by women. “What the book’s title as a whole is meant to connote,” writes Dinnerstein, “is both (a) our longstanding general awareness of our uneasy, ambiguous position in the animal kingdom, and (b) a more specific awareness: that until we grow strong enough to renounce the pernicious forms of collaboration between the sexes, both man and woman will remain semi-human, monstrous” (p. 5). Even as 15\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nDinnerstein describes convincingly the types of imbalance and injustice the prevailing asymmetry in gender relations produces, she also analyzes the reasons for our refusal to abandon the very modes of monstrousness from which we suffer most. Nancy Friday’s book, which is subtitled “The Daughter’s Search for Identity,” argues that the mother’s repression of herself necessitated by the myth of maternal love creates a heritage of self-rejection, anger, and duplicity that makes it difficult for the daughter to seek any emotional satisfaction other than the state of idealized symbiosis that both mother and daughter continue to punish themselves for never having been able to achieve. Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is an even more elaborate and unsettling formulation of the relation between parenthood and monstrousness. It is the story of two antithetical modes of parenting that give rise to two increasingly parallel lives—the life of Victor Frankenstein, who is the beloved child of two doting parents, and the life of the monster he single-handedly creates but immediately spurns and abandons. The fact that in the end both characters reach an equal degree of alienation and self-torture and indeed become indistinguishable as they pursue each other across the frozen polar wastes indicates that the novel is, among other things, a study of the impossibility of finding an adequate model for what a parent should be. All three books agree, then, that in the existing state of things there is something inherently monstrous about the prevailing parental arrangements. While Friday and Dinnerstein, whose analyses directly address the problem of sexual difference, suggest that this monstrousness is curable, Mary Shelley, who does not explicitly locate the self ’s monstrousness in its gender arrangements, appears to dramatize divisions within the human being that are so much a part of being human that no escape from monstrousness seems possible. What I will try to do here is to read these three books not as mere studies of the monstrousness of selfhood, not as mere accounts of human monsterdom in general, but as autobiographies in their own right, as textual dramatizations of the very problems with which they deal. None of the three books, of course, presents itself explicitly as autobiography. Yet each includes clear instances of the autobiographical—not the purely authorial—first-person pronoun. In each case the autobiographical reflex is triggered by the resistance and ambivalence involved in the act of writing the book. What I shall argue here is that what is specifically feminist in each book is directly related to this struggle for female authorship.\n\nMy Monster /My Self\n\n\n\nThe notion that Frankenstein can somehow be read as the autobiography of a woman would certainly appear at first sight to be ludicrous. The novel, indeed, presents not one but three autobiographies of men. Robert Walton, an arctic explorer on his way to the North Pole, writes home to his sister of his encounter with Victor Frankenstein, who tells Walton the story of his painstaking creation and unexplained abandonment of a nameless monster who suffers excruciating and fiendish loneliness, and who tells Frankenstein his life story in the middle pages of the book. The three male autobiographies motivate themselves as follows: [Walton, to his sister:] “You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare.” (p. 15) [Frankenstein, with his hands covering his face, to Walton, who has been speaking of his scientific ambition:] “Unhappy man! Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!” (p. 26) [Monster, to Frankenstein:] “I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head.” [Frankenstein:] “Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you and me.” [Monster places his hands before Frankenstein’s eyes:] “Thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. . . . God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance.” (pp. 95, 96, 97, 125)\n\nAll three autobiographies here are clearly attempts at persuasion rather than simple accounts of facts. They all depend on a presupposition of resemblance between teller and addressee: Walton assures his sister that he has not really left the path she would wish for him, that he still resembles her. Frankenstein recognizes in Walton an image of himself and rejects in the monster a resemblance he does not wish to acknowledge. The teller is in each case speaking into a mirror of his own transgression. The tale is designed to reinforce the resemblance between teller and listener so that somehow transgression can be eliminated. Yet the desire for resemblance, the desire to create a being like oneself—which is the autobiographical desire par excellence—is also the central transgression in Mary Shelley’s novel. What is at stake in Frankenstein’s workshop of filthy\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\ncreation is precisely the possibility of shaping a life in one’s own image: Frankenstein’s monster can thus be seen as a figure for autobiography as such. Victor Frankenstein, then, has twice obeyed the impulse to construct an image of himself: on the first occasion he creates a monster, and on the second he tries to explain to Walton the causes and consequences of the first. Frankenstein can be read as the story of autobiography as the attempt to neutralize the monstrosity of autobiography. Simultaneously a revelation and a cover-up, autobiography would appear to constitute itself as in some way a repression of autobiography. These three fictive male autobiographies are embedded within a thin introductory frame, added in 1831, in which Mary Shelley herself makes the repression of her own autobiographical impulse explicit: The publishers of the standard novels, in selecting Frankenstein for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with some account of the origin of the story. . . . It is true that I am very averse to bringing myself forward in print, but as my account will only appear as an appendage to a former production, and as it will be confined to such topics as have connection with my authorship alone, I can scarcely accuse myself of a personal intrusion. (p. vii)\n\nMary Shelley, here, rather than speaking into a mirror, is speaking as an appendage to a text. It might perhaps be instructive to ask whether this change of status has anything to do with the problem of specifically feminine autobiography. In a humanistic tradition in which man is the measure of all things, how does an appendage go about telling the story of her life? Before pursuing this question further, I would like to turn to a more explicit version of surreptitious feminine autobiography. Of the three books under discussion, Nancy Friday’s account of the mother/­daughter relationship relies the most heavily on the facts of the author’s life in order to demonstrate its thesis. Since the author grew up without a father, she shares with Frankenstein’s monster some of the problems of coming from a single-parent household. The book begins with a chapter entitled “Mother Love,” of which the first two sentences are “I have always lied to my mother. And she to me” (p. 19). Interestingly, the book carries the following dedication: “When I stopped seeing my mother with the eyes of a child, I saw the woman who helped me give birth to myself. This book is for Jane Colbert Friday Scott.” How then, can we be sure that this huge book is not itself another lie to the mother it is dedicated to? Is\n\nMy Monster /My Self\n\n\n\nautobiography somehow always in the process of symbolically killing the mother off by telling her the lie that we have given birth to ourselves? On page 460, Nancy Friday is still not sure what kind of lie she has told. She writes: “I am suddenly afraid that the mother I have depicted throughout this book is false.” Whose life is this, anyway? This question cannot be resolved by a book that sees the “daughter’s search for identity” as the necessity of choosing between symbiosis and separation, between the mother and the autonomous self. As long as this polarity remains unquestioned, the autobiography of Nancy Friday becomes the drawing and redrawing of the portrait of Jane Colbert Friday Scott. The most truly autobiographical moments occur not in expressions of triumphant separation but in descriptions of the way the book itself attempts to resist its own writing. At the end of the chapter on loss of virginity, Nancy Friday writes: It took me twenty-one years to give up my virginity. In some similar manner I am unable to let go of this chapter. . . . It is no accident that wrestling with ideas of loss of virginity immediately bring me to a dream of losing my mother. This chapter has revealed a split in me. Intellectually, I think of myself as a sexual person, just as I had intellectually been able to put my ideas for this chapter down on paper. Subjectively, I don’t want to face what I have written: that the declaration of full sexual independence is the declaration of separation from my mother. As long as I don’t finish this chapter, as long as I don’t let myself understand the implication of what I’ve written, I can maintain the illusion, at least, that I can be sexual and have my mother’s love and approval too. (pp. 331–333)\n\nAs long as sexual identity and mother’s judgment are linked as antithetical and exclusive poles of the daughter’s problem, the “split” she describes will prevent her from ever completing her declaration of sexual independence. “Full sexual independence” is shown by the book’s own resistance to be as illusory and as mystifying an ideal as the notion of “mother love” that Friday so lucidly rejects. Dinnerstein’s autobiographical remarks are more muted, although her way of letting the reader know that the book was written partly in mourning for her husband subtly underlies its persuasive seriousness. In her gesture of rejecting more traditional forms of scholarship, she pleads not for the validity but for the urgency of her message: Right now, what I think is that the kind of work of which this is an example is centrally necessary work. Whether our understanding makes a difference or\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nnot, we must try to understand what is threatening to kill us off as fully and clearly as we can. . . . What [this book] is, then, is not a scholarly book: it makes no effort to survey the relevant literature. Not only would that task be (for me) unmanageably huge. It would also be against my principles. I believe in reading unsystematically and taking notes erratically. Any effort to form a rational policy about what to take in, out of the inhuman flood of printed human utterance that pours over us daily, feels to me like a self-deluded exercise in pseudomastery. (pp. viii–ix)\n\nThe typographical form of this book bears out this belief in renouncing the appearance of mastery: there are two kinds of notes, some at the foot of the page and some at the back of the book; there are sections between chapters with unaligned right-hand margins which are called “Notes toward the next chapter.” And there are boldface inserts which carry on a dialogue with the controversial points in the main exposition. Clearly, great pains have been taken to let as many seams as possible show in the fabric of the argument. The preface goes on: I mention these limitations in a spirit not of apology but of warning. To the extent that it succeeds in communicating its point at all, this book will necessarily enrage the reader. What it says is emotionally threatening. (Part of why it has taken me so long to finish it is that I am threatened by it myself.) (p. ix; emphasis mine)\n\nMy book is roughly sutured, says Dinnerstein, and it is threatening. This description sounds uncannily like a description of Victor Frankenstein’s monster. Indeed, Dinnerstein goes on to warn the reader not to be tempted to avoid the threatening message by pointing to superficial flaws in its physical makeup. The reader of Frankenstein, too, would be well advised to look beyond the monster’s physical deformity, both for his fearsome power and for his beauty. There are indeed numerous ways in which The Mermaid and the Minotaur can be seen as a modern rewriting of Frankenstein. Dinnerstein’s book situates its plea for two-sex parenting firmly in an apparently twentieth-century double bind: the realization that the very technological advances that make it possible to change the structure of parenthood also threaten to extinguish earthly life altogether. But it is startling to note that this seemingly contemporary pairing of the question of parenthood with a love-hate relation to technology is already at work in Mary Shelley’s novel, where the spectacular scientific discovery\n\nMy Monster /My Self\n\n\n\nof the secrets of animation produces a terrifyingly vengeful creature who attributes his evil impulses to his inability to find or to become a parent. Subtitled “The Modern Prometheus,” Frankenstein itself indeed refers back to a myth that already links scientific ambivalence with the origin of mankind. Prometheus, the fire bringer, the giver of both creation and destruction, is also said by some accounts to be the father of the human race. Ambivalence toward technology can thus be seen as a displaced version of the love-hate relation we have toward our own children. It is only recently that critics have begun to see Victor Frankenstein’s disgust at the sight of his creation as a study of postpartum depression, as a representation of maternal rejection of a newborn infant, and to relate the entire novel to Mary Shelley’s mixed feelings about motherhood.2 Having lived through an unwanted pregnancy from a man married to someone else only to see that baby die, followed by a second baby named William—which is the name of the monster’s first murder victim—Mary Shelley, at the age of only eighteen, must have had excruciatingly divided emotions. Her own mother, indeed, had died upon giving birth to her. The idea that a mother can loathe, fear, and reject her baby has until recently been one of the most repressed of psychoanalytical insights, although it is of course already implicit in the story of Oedipus, whose parents cast him out as an infant to die. What is threatening about each of these books is the way in which its critique of the role of the mother touches on primitive terrors of the mother’s rejection of the child. Each of these women writers does in her way reject the child as part of her coming to grips with the untenable nature of mother love: Nancy Friday decides not to have children, Dorothy Dinnerstein argues that men as well as women should do the mothering, and Mary Shelley describes a parent who flees in disgust from the repulsive being to whom he has just given birth. Yet it is not merely in its depiction of the ambivalence of motherhood that Mary Shelley’s novel can be read as autobiographical. In the introductory note added in 1831, she writes: The publishers of the standard novels, in selecting Frankenstein for one of their series, expressed a wish that I should furnish them with some account of the origin of the story. I am the more willing to comply because I shall thus give a general answer to the question so very frequently asked me—how I, then a young girl, came to think of and to dilate upon so very hideous an idea. (p. vii; emphasis mine)\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nAs this passage makes clear, readers of Mary Shelley’s novel had frequently expressed the feeling that a young girl’s fascination with the idea of monstrousness was somehow monstrous in itself. When Mary ends her introduction to the reedition of her novel with the words, “And now, once again, I bid my hideous progeny go forth and prosper,” the reader begins to suspect that there may perhaps be meaningful parallels between ­Victor’s creation of his monster and Mary’s creation of her book.\n\nSuch parallels are indeed unexpectedly pervasive. The impulse to write the book and the desire to search for the secret of animation both arise under the same seemingly trivial circumstances: the necessity of finding something to read on a rainy day. During inclement weather on a family vacation, Victor Frankenstein happens upon the writings of Cornelius Agrippa and is immediately fired with the longing to penetrate the secrets of life and death. Similarly, it was during a wet, ungenial summer in Switzerland that Mary, Shelley, Byron, and several others picked up a volume of ghost stories and decided to write a collection of spine-tingling tales of their own. Moreover, Mary’s discovery of the subject she would write about is described in almost exactly the same words as Frankenstein’s discovery of the principle of life: “Swift as light and as cheering was the idea that broke in upon me” (p. xi), writes Mary in her introduction, while Frankenstein says: “From the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me” (p. 51). In both cases the sudden flash of inspiration must be supported by the meticulous gathering of heterogeneous, ready-made materials: Frankenstein collects bones and organs; Mary records overheard discussions of scientific questions that lead her to the sudden vision of monstrous creation. “Invention,” she writes of the process of writing, but her words apply equally well to Frankenstein’s labors, “­Invention . . . does not consist in creating out of the void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the first place, be afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances but cannot bring into being the substance itself ” (p. x). Perhaps the most revealing indication of Mary’s identification of Frankenstein’s activity with her own is to be found in her use of the word “artist” on two different occasions to qualify the “pale student of unhallowed arts”: “His success would terrify the artist” (p. xi), she writes of the catastrophic moment of creation, while Frankenstein\n\nMy Monster /My Self\n\n\n\nconfesses to Walton: “I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favorite employment” (p. 55). Frankenstein, in other words, can be read as the story of the experience of writing Frankenstein. What is at stake in Mary’s introduction as well as in the novel is the description of a primal scene of creation. Frankenstein combines a monstrous answer to two of the most fundamental questions one can ask: Where do babies come from? and Where do stories come from? In both cases, the scene of creation is described, but the answer to these questions is still withheld. But what can Victor Frankenstein’s workshop of filthy creation teach us about the specificity of female authorship? At first sight, it would seem that Frankenstein is much more striking for its avoidance of the question of femininity than for its insight into it. All the interesting, complex characters in the book are male, and their deepest attachments are to other males. The females, on the other hand, are beautiful, gentle, selfless, boring nurturers and victims who never experience inner conflict or true desire. Monstrousness is so incompatible with femininity that Frankenstein cannot even complete the female companion that his creature so eagerly awaits. On the other hand, the story of Frankenstein is, after all, the story of a man who usurps the female role by physically giving birth to a child. It would be tempting, therefore, to conclude that Mary Shelley, surrounded as she then was by the male poets Byron and Shelley, and mortified for days by her inability to think of a story to contribute to their ghost-story contest, should have fictively transposed her own frustrated female pen envy into a tale of catastrophic male womb envy. In this perspective, Mary’s book would suggest that a woman’s desire to write and a man’s desire to give birth would both be capable only of producing monsters. Yet clearly things cannot be so simple. As the daughter of a famous feminist whose A Vindication of the Rights of Woman she was in the process of rereading during the time she was writing Frankenstein, Mary Shelley would have no conscious reason to believe that writing was not proper for a woman. Indeed, as she says in her introduction, Mary was practically born with ink flowing through her veins. “It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing. . . . My husband . . . was from the first very anxious that I should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enroll myself on the page of fame” (pp. vii–viii). In order\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nto prove herself worthy of her parentage, Mary, paradoxically enough, must thus usurp the parental role and succeed in giving birth to herself on paper. Her declaration of existence as a writer must therefore figuratively repeat the matricide that her physical birth all too literally entailed. The connection between literary creation and the death of a parent is in fact suggested in the novel by the fact that, immediately after the monster’s animation, Victor Frankenstein dreams that he holds the corpse of his dead mother in his arms. It is also suggested by the juxtaposition of two seemingly unrelated uses of italics in the novel: Mary’s statement that she had “thought of a story” (which she inexplicably italicizes twice) and the monster’s promise to Frankenstein, “I will be with you on your wedding night,” which is repeatedly italicized. Both are eliminations of the mother, since the story Mary writes is a tale of motherless birth, and the wedding night marks the death of Frankenstein’s bride, Elizabeth. Indeed, Mary herself was in fact the unwitting murderous intruder present on her own parents’ wedding night: their decision to marry was due to the fact that Mary Wollstonecraft was already carrying the child that was to kill her. When Mary, describing her waking vision of catastrophic creation, affirms that “his success would terrify the artist,” she is not giving vent to any ordinary fear-of-success syndrome. Rather, what her book suggests is that what is at stake behind what is currently being banalized under the name of female fear of success is nothing less than the fear of somehow effecting the death of one’s own parents. It is not, however, the necessary murderousness of any declaration of female subjectivity that Mary Shelley’s novel is proposing as its most troubling message of monsterdom. For, in a strikingly contemporary sort of predicament, Mary had not one but two mothers, each of whom consisted in the knowledge of the unviability of the other. After the death of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary’s father, William Godwin, married a woman as opposite in character and outlook as possible, a staunch, housewifely mother of two who clearly preferred her own children to Godwin’s. Between the courageous, passionate, intelligent, and suicidal mother Mary knew only through her writings and the vulgar, repressive “pustule of vanity” whose dislike she resented and returned, Mary must have known at first hand a whole gamut of feminine contradictions, impasses, and options. For the complexities of the demands, desires, and sufferings of Mary’s life as a woman were staggering. Her father, who had once been a vehement opponent of the institution of marriage, nearly disowned his daughter\n\nMy Monster /My Self\n\n\n\nfor running away with Shelley, an already married disciple of Godwin’s own former views. Shelley himself, who believed in multiple love objects, amicably fostered an erotic correspondence between Mary and his friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg, among others. For years, Mary and Shelley were accompanied everywhere by Mary’s stepsister Claire, whom Mary did not particularly like, who had a child by Byron, and who maintained an ambiguous relation with Shelley. During the writing of Frankenstein, Mary learned of the suicide of her half-sister Fanny Imlay, her mother’s illegitimate child by an American lover, and the suicide of Shelley’s wife Harriet, who was pregnant by a man other than Shelley. By the time she and Shelley married, Mary had had two children; she would have two more by the time of Shelley’s death and watch as all but one of the children died in infancy. Widowed at age twenty-four, she never remarried. It is thus indeed perhaps the very hiddenness of the question of femininity in Frankenstein that somehow proclaims the painful message not of female monstrousness but of female contradictions. For it is the fact of selfcontradiction that is so vigorously repressed in women. While the story of a man who is haunted by his own contradictions is representable as an allegory of monstrous doubles, how indeed would it have been possible for Mary to represent feminine contradiction from the point of view of its repression otherwise than precisely in the gap between angels of domesticity and an uncompleted monsteress, between the murdered Elizabeth and the dismembered Eve? It is perhaps because the novel does succeed in conveying the unresolvable contradictions inherent in being female that Percy Shelley himself felt compelled to write a prefatory disclaimer in Mary’s name before he could let loose his wife’s hideous progeny upon the world. In a series of denials jarringly at odds with the daring negativity of the novel, Shelley places the following words in Mary’s mouth: I am by no means indifferent to the manner in which whatever moral tendencies exist in the sentiments or characters it contains shall affect the reader; yet my chief concern in this respect has been limited to . . . the exhibition of the amiableness of domestic affection, and the excellence of universal virtue. The opinions which naturally spring from the character and situation of the hero are by no means to be conceived as existing always in my own conviction; nor is any inference justly to be drawn from the following pages as prejudicing any philosophical doctrine of whatever kind. (pp. xiii–xiv)\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nHow is this to be read except as a gesture of repression of the very specificity of the power of feminine contradiction, a gesture reminiscent of Frankenstein’s destruction of his nearly completed female monster? What is being repressed here is the possibility that a woman can write anything that would not exhibit “the amiableness of domestic affection,” the possibility that for women as well as for men the home can be the very site of the unheimlich. It can thus be seen in all three of the books we have discussed that the monstrousness of selfhood is intimately embedded within the question of female autobiography. Yet how could it be otherwise, since the very notion of a self, the very shape of human life stories, has always, from Saint Augustine to Freud, been modeled on the man? Rousseau’s—or any man’s—autobiography consists in the story of the difficulty of conforming to the standard of what a man should be. The problem for the female autobiographer is, on the one hand, to resist the pressure of masculine autobiography as the only literary genre available for her enterprise, and, on the other, to describe a difficulty in conforming to a female ideal which is largely a fantasy of the masculine, not the feminine, imagination. The fact that these three books deploy a theory of autobiography as monstrosity within the framework of a less overtly avowed struggle with the raw materials of the authors’ own lives and writing is perhaps, in the final analysis, what is most autobiographically fertile and telling about them.\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nGender Theory and the Yale School\n\n1\n\nI hope that by the end of this paper I will not have bitten off more of the hand that feeds me than I can chew. —From the original introduction to “Gender Theory and the Yale School”\n\nIn January 1984, shortly after the death of Paul de Man, I received a call from Robert Con Davis and Ronald Schleifer inviting me to attempt the painful and obviously impossible task of replacing de Man in a conference entitled “Genre Theory and the Yale School” in which Geoffrey Hartman, Hillis Miller, and Paul de Man had been asked to speak about genre theory in relation to their own work. I was invited to speak, however, not about my own work but about de Man’s. The reasons for this are certainly understandable. I could easily sympathize with the conference organizers’ impulse: there is nothing I could wish more than that de Man had not died. But the invitation to appear as de Man’s supplément—supplemented in turn by a panel on de Man with participants of my own choosing—gave me pause. For it falls all too neatly into patterns of female effacement already well established by the phenomenon of the Yale School—and indeed, with rare exceptions, by the phenomenon of the critical “school” as such. Like others of its type, the Yale School has always been a Male School. Would it have been possible for there to have been a female presence in the Yale School? Interestingly, in Jonathan Culler’s bibliography to On Deconstruction, Shoshana Felman’s book La Folie et la chose littéraire is described as “a wide-ranging collection of essays by a member of the ‘école de Yale.’”2 Felman, in other words, was a member of the Yale School, but only in French. This question of the foreignness of the female language will return, but for now, suffice it to say that there was no reason other than gender why Felman’s work—certainly closer to de Man’s and Derrida’s than the work of Harold Bloom—should not have been seen as 27\n\n\n\nBarbara Johnson\n\nan integral part of the Yale School. At the time of the publication of the Yale School’s nonmanifesto, Deconstruction and Criticism, several of us— Shoshana Felman, Gayatri Spivak, Margaret Ferguson, and I—discussed the possibility of writing a companion volume inscribing female deconstructive protest and affirmation centering not on Percy Bysshe Shelley’s “The Triumph of Life” (as the existing volume was originally slated to do) but on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. That book might truly have illustrated the Girardian progression “from mimetic desire to the monstrous double.” Unfortunately, this Bride of Deconstruction and Criticism never quite got off the ground, but it is surely no accident that the project was centered around monstrosity. As Derrida puts it in “The Law of Genre” (which is also, of course, a law of gender), “As soon as genre announces itself, one must respect a norm, one must not cross a line of demarcation, one must not risk impurity, anomaly, or monstrosity.”3 After all, Aristotle, the founder of the law of gender as well as of the law of genre, considered the female the first distortion of the genus “man” en route to becoming a monster. But perhaps it was not Frankenstein but rather The Last Man, Mary Shelley’s grim depiction of the gradual extinction of humanity altogether, that would have made a fit counterpart to “The Triumph of Life.” Percy Bysshe Shelley is entombed in both, along with a certain male fantasy of Romantic universality. The only universality that remains in Mary Shelley’s last novel is the plague. It would be easy to accuse the male Yale School theorists of having avoided the issue of gender entirely.
