This document is an introduction and acknowledgements section from a doctoral thesis on the evolution of private art museums in Mexico. It discusses the author's interest in contemporary art in Mexico stemming from their work as an arts journalist. The author became interested in how private collectors were establishing their own foundations and museums to exhibit contemporary art and impact how the public engages with art in Mexico. The introduction provides background on the author's initial non-academic research and decision to pursue the topic formally for a PhD at the University of Essex, which has a respected Latin American art history program. It acknowledges those who helped and supported the author's research, including providing contacts in Mexico.",
