Foresight is bringing together leading minds to fight it out in exciting interactive debates covering critical topics from longevity to crypto-currency, from AI to designer babies, and from new governance to X-risks. Join our roundtable discussions, sample the foods of the future and connect with each other.\n\nOur goal is to engage both the public and industry leaders in important conversations that may otherwise not be had.\n\nThe event website: The Great Debates of Our Time\n\nPhotos can be accessed on the event Facebook page.\n\nFor a quick overview of the event, see Alton Sun’s notes.\n\nWhen Saturday, November 19, 2016\n\n1-7 PM: Core event with debates and audience voting\n\n7 PM-late: Special dinner for speakers and Foresight Members\n\nWhere Antique mansion turned incubator at secret location in Alamo Square, SF\n\nVideo on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nXStYqiapU\n\nPublished on Dec 14, 2016. Length: 3:16\n\nSome of the conversations that Foresight Institute is championing.\n\nTranscript\n\nJulia Bossmann, President, Foresight Institute\n\nWe’re not just running the technical workshops behind closed doors. We also want to involve the public, and this event today is to involve the public and to have these debates out in the open. The big questions that are brought up with the advent of artificial intelligence, with the advent of nanotechnology, they should not just be answered by the engineers that build it.\n\nSteve Omohundro, President, Possibility Research; President, Self-aware System\n\nYou really don’t want just some scientists sitting in a basement in Palo Alto deciding on the future of humanity, so I think the entire world should be thinking about what would be the ideal future for everybody.\n\nDavid Eagleman, Professor of Neuroscience, Stanford University\n\nThe Great Debates provide an opportunity for very different people to come together at the same time and answer questions and bounce off one another, and so that’s been really wonderful to watch this today and to be a part of this today.\n\nMaya Lockwood, Director of Engagement, Foresight Institute\n\nOur future technologies are actually impacting every area of our lives: in health, in government, in finance, you name it.\n\nJulia Bossmann, President, Foresight Institute\n\nAnd that’s why we’re bringing people together to have these debates. We want to have the discourse, we want to have the disagreements on stage to see that the ink isn’t dry.\n\nAllison Duettmann, Program Manager, Foresight Institute\n\nAlso, the events that I’m attending in the bay area, you have one keynote speaker, who’s really versed in the subject and was giving you an excellent talk in, like what the future has in store for us. Well, what if we bring several of these into one room, and they all have different opinions on the matter rather than just having one person telling you what the future is, and you follow him.\n\nMaya Lockwood, Director of Engagement, Foresight Institute\n\nThe ultimate goal for holding The Great Debates today was to get the public involved, get the public engagement in these very, very important conversations.\n\nDr. Joon Yun, President, Palo Alto Investors\n\nWell, another world to think about, what would happen if we enable the body to have sustained health. What are the social, economic, political … what’s gonna happen in the investment landscape, what’s going to happen to our ideas of war, our ideas about land.\n\nNichol Bradford, Executive Director, Transformative Technology Lab\n\nMental and emotional well-being is one of the inputs for the output of a better world. How do I know myself better, and how do I know and connect to you better. Mental and emotional well-being is one of the inputs and if we don’t have that we don’t get to the better world.\n\nRyan Bethencourt, Program Director, Indiebio; Venture Partner, SOSV\n\nMany of us are very excited about space—not just Mars, but the entire solar system, or maybe further out. Okay, great! We want to get these meat bodies through space, through the darkness in the void of space. How we gonna do that.\n\nSteve Omohundro, President, Possibility Research; President, Self-aware System\n\nWe’re on the verge of a major transformation through artificial intelligence. The technologies are moving, have been really, really fast. They are going to impact every aspect of society, but society is not ready.\n\nBryan Johnson, Founder, Braintree; CEO, Kernel\n\nWhat will become of human intelligence? We talk a lot about artificial intelligence, and in many ways it’s sucked all the air out of the room. Intelligence is the most consequential and powerful resource in existence. It is what allows us as humans to reign supreme on planet Earth.\n\nJulia Bossmann, President, Foresight Institute\n\nPart of our mission is to build the bridge between the engineers who are building the breakthrough technology and the wider public that is going to interact with this technology."
