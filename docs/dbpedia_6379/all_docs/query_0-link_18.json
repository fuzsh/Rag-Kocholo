        "text": "MILITARY - ART .COM : AVIATION SIGNATURE HOME PAGE\n\nOver 2,500 different people have signed artwork in our collection, with almost 2,000 of these being pilots, aircrew or aviation related in some way. We have spent a great deal of effort making our signatures database the best available, with all prints signed by any individual available on a page dedicated to them, and every signature on every print linked to the database. We have obtained as much information as we can - and keep the database up to date as best we can. Sadly, with the passing of time, many of the WW2 pilots who signed prints in the past are no longer with us, and we lose more every year.\n\nRecently, we also gave an estimated value of every signature in the database. The variety of signatures is such that while some top aces have a very desirable signature, its value may be less than you would expect because they have signed a great many prints, while other less famed pilots may have a high value as they may have signed just a handful of prints, increasing the rarity of the signature. Our knowledge of aviation art signatures, and having dealt with pilots, aircrew and artists for several decades now, allows us to give as good a guide price as you will get for the value of signatures. On each print, we give you the combined value of the signatures on it, and display a message where this value is considered more than the cost of the print. We even have a separate price for mounted signatures - where an original signature is cut from its original source and matted into the surround of a new print. In a handful of cases, such as Manfred von Richthofen, only mounted signatures are available."
