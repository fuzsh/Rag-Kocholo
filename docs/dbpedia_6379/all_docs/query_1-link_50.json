        "text": "ATLANTUS is a collaborative project between photographer Martin Toft and Gareth Syvret at Archisle: The Jersey Contemporary Photography Program at the Société Jersiaise Photographic Archive, St Helier, Jersey, UK. This major creative research project connects photographic archives and contemporary photographic practice as tools for exploring historical and cultural links between Jersey and New Jersey.\n\nThe project is inspired by the 350th anniversary, in 2014, of the naming of the State of New Jersey, USA in 1664 by Jerseyman, Sir George de Carteret. As part of this project Martin Toft will be producing new photographs both in (old) Jersey and New Jersey, exploring both places’ unique cultures, histories, geographies and identities. Funded by States of Jersey External Relations, in 2015 we will be distributing an innovative dual functioning pop-up exhibition/newspaper across educational and cultural venues in both Jersey/ New Jersey to coincide with major celebrations. The long term objectives of the project are to make exhibitions, publications and establish contemporary photographic archives in Jersey and New Jersey.\n\nWe will posting updates, photographs and other developments here and through Atlantus Facebook page.

Driving from one end of Long Beach Island to the other I was amazed with so few cars on the road and people too, compared to my visit last summer. I wanted to spend some time in Barnegat Light at the very top of LBI, a community I felt some connection to for a number of reasons. Primarily a fishing hamlet established by Scandinavian fishermen arriving in 1926 it also has a famous lighthouse and a large protected dune area, quite unique on the Jersey Shore. Similarities with St Ouen’s Bay on Jersey’s west coast are obvious but it is also the people who live here which share a strong sense of belonging to a particular landscape and a way of life. To my surprise, I not only met a Dane during church service at St Peter-at-the-light who was brought up in North New Jersey, but I also spoke with two members of the congregation who told me that their ancestors had originally migrated from Jersey, Channel Islands some time in the 19th Century. Back home in the isle of Jersey we found both family names in the census records, Davidge (born in St Martin’s in 1846) and Diamond, changed from either Dimond or Dymonds (French names.) For New Year we drove to Asbury Park, another place on the Eastern Seaboard that I found fascinating on my earlier road trip. Of course, Asbury Park is a lot more than the famous boardwalk and its musical heritage. There seems to be three distinct areas in Asbury Park. Apart from the Boardwalk there is Downtown with trendy cafes, restaurants, galleries and shops situated around Cookman Avenue and then Main St/Westside around the railroad. On my first visit in the summer people warned me not to cross the tracks and enter the black communities situated west of town. But, in fact, those areas attracted me the most and on both occasions I met some incredible people there. I must admit…I prefer the winter to summer on the Jersey Shore…quiet, cold, friendly.\n\nBarrier Peninsula (North looking South), New Jersey, United States, 26 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSandy Hook, New Jersey, United States, 26 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBarnegat Light, Long Beach Island, New Jersey, United States, 27 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nViking Village, Barnegat Light, Long Beach Island, New Jersey, United States, 27 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDunes, Barnegat Light, Long Beach Island, New Jersey, United States, 29 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nYouth, Surf City, Long Beach Island, New Jersey, United States, 29 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRon Diamond’s family portraits, Surf City, Long Beach Island, New Jersey, United States, 29 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nXavier Bailey, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJohnny Mac House of Spirit, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBradley Park, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAllen’s Allright Barber Shop, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMatthew Allen, Barber, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTriumphant Life Church, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJoseph Anderson, Vietnam Veteran, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMadam Marie’s, Boardwalk, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nNew Year’s Eve, Wonderbar, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 31 December 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCasino Arena, Boardwalk, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 01 January 2015 © Martin Toft\n\nPolar Bear Plunge, Boardwalk, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 01 January 2015 © Martin Toft\n\nParamount Theatre, The Convention Hall.

Within a relatively short distance from the Jersey Shore you can find yourself in the mountains that are bordering New York State. I arrived in Vernon, a township in the Kittatinny Valley which is a section of the Great Appalachian Trail that stretches 700 miles from Canada to Alabama. A part from a ski resort and a water park such as Mountain Creek, Vernon is also home to an alternative music scene and I found myself on a mountain top at Let Me Show You Something Festival on Ricky’s Farm. After all, Woodstock is a only an hour and half drive away.\n\nCloser to Mahwah you will find the Ramapough Mountain Indians who are living around the mountains of Bergen and Passaic counties. In 1980, they were recognized by the state of New Jersey as an Indian tribe but have not gained federal recognition. Their ancestry is multiracial and their tribal office is located on Stag Hill Road on Houvenkopf Mountain. According to legend (or folklore) the community was frequently referred to as the ‘Jackson Whites’ and it is assumed that they were descendants of runaway and freed slaves (Jacks in slang) and whites (Europeans) believed to have included Dutch settlers (reflected in surnames common among the people) and later Hessian soldiers, German mercenaries who fought for the British during the American Revolution. On my flight over the Atlantic I was watching a film, Out of the Furnace starring Christian Bale that is based on a fictional story that deals with the communities living in the Ramapough Mountains. While in Mahwah, I later learned that members of the community around Stag Hill Road, some whom share the same surname of the movie’s antagonist, DeGoat filed suit against the makers of the movie, claiming that it portrays a gang of criminals who are lawless, drug-addicted, impoverished and violent. The suit was dismissed, but this was not the first time that this community had been involved in controversy as they have participated in litigation against the Ford Motor Company regarding poisoning from a former toxic landfill, portions of which were subsequently used in the 1970s as sites for affordable housing for the Ramapough people. A documentary film, Mann v Ford was released in 2011 which follows the five years of the Ramapough pursuing the law suit and how they reached settlement.\n\nAt the end of my road trip I came to Paterson, a city that I had been looking forward to visiting mainly due to its industrial past, but also because it is a place that New Jersey photographer, George Tice has been studiously photographing since the 1970s. Tice is often referred to as the ‘Robert Adams of New Jersey’ and his photo books, Paterson (1972) and Paterson II (2006) are seminal books about the social landscape of this city. Today, Paterson is no longer the cradle of the industrial revolution in America (textiles, firearms, silk and railroad locomotives) and has involved into a major destination for Hispanic emigrants as well as immigrants from the Arab and Muslim world. In popular culture the city of Paterson is referenced from Allen Ginsberg poem, Howl, to the dramatisation in the 1999 Denzel washington film The Hurricane, based on the controversial arrest and conviction of boxer Rubin “Hurricane’ Carter and the the Great Falls of the Passaic River was featured in the first season of The Sopranos, where a a drug dealer is tossed over the falls by associates of the notorious New Jersey mob family.\n\nLet Me Show You Something Festival, Vernon, New Jersey, United States, 23 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDiamond and Pearl Woods, Vernon, New Jersey, United States, 23 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRicky’s Farm, Vernon, New Jersey, United States, 23 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJune Montgomery, Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, United States, 24 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBlack Stud, Stag Hill Road, Mahwah, New Jersey, United States, 25 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDisused Factory, Paterson, New Jersey, United States, 26 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJoel Padilla, Paterson, New Jersey, United States, 26 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nOlin Simmons Jr, Paterson, New Jersey, United States, 27 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nStraight St, Paterson, New Jersey, United States, 27 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGarrett Mountain, Paterson, New Jersey, United States, 27 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMon 10 Nov: While we are editing a final selection for a forthcoming publication we our continuing with updating our online archive with a post from Hunterdon County, New Jersey’s premier dairy farmland and agricultural area. What is remarkable about Hunterdon County is not only that in 2014 it is celebrating it’s own 300th anniversary, but that it has direct historical link with the Isle of Jersey through one of its most treasured exports, the Jersey Cow. The photographs here are centered around one particular narrative, namely the story about ‘Precious Galinthia’ – a young Jersey calf that was presented to Linda Lee Wagner (nee Harrison) for her achievements as a 4-H young farmer in Stockton, Hunterdon at the World Fair in New York on June the 24th 1964.\n\nPrecious Galinthia was a gift from the Isle of Jersey and given to Governor Richard Hughes by an official delegation that included the Bailiff Robert H. Le Masurier, his wife and St Helier Constable, Mr Dennis Ryan whom were visiting the Tercentenary celebrations of the naming of New Jersey, by Sir George de Carteret in 1664. The calf was breed by Jersey dairy farmer, Edward Cottillard and was transported across the Atlantic by Paul J. Spann and Sons from Far Hills Farm in Oldwick, Hunterdon. From the beginning of the 20th Century, the Spann family have had a long tradition of visiting the Channel Islands and buy the very best young Jerseys and selling them on at auctions to American cattle breeders. The young heifer had spend over a month in quarantine in Clifton, NJ and had been well looked after by Jersey herdsman, Bryan Le Brocq (see previous post from 11 July which also include a portrait of Idris Cottillard, daughter of cattle farmer, Edward)\n\nThe last photographs in this post follow in the footsteps of places visited by the Jersey delegation. A private diary including press cuttings and official photographs from Mrs Le Masurier provide detailed accounts of a week of tercentenary events. Their visit included being invited to the State Capitol in Trenton where her husband, the Bailiff spoke to a full house in the General Assembly Chamber and presented Governor Hughes with a miniature copy of the Royal Mace. A tour of Princeton University were later followed by dinner at Morven House, the official residence of the Governor. The couple stayed at The Nassau Inn which houses the famous Yankee Doodle Tap-room, a favourite meeting place of Princeton undergraduates.\n\nMax Spann, Far Hills Farm, Oldwick, New Jersey, United States, 19 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJersey Cattle Sales Catalogues, Oldwick, New Jersey, United States, 19 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFamily Kitchen, Far Hills Farm, Oldwick, New Jersey, United States, 19 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBird Feeder, Far Hills Farm, Oldwick, New Jersey, United States, 19 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nElizabeth Kneser (nee Spann), Far Hills Farm, Oldwick, New Jersey, United States, 19 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nStillwater Lake, Mt Pocono, Pennsylvania, United States, 22 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTriple-Lee Jerseys, Hamlin, Pennsylvania, United States, 22 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLinda Lee Wagner (nee Harrison), Triple-Lee Jerseys, Hamlin, Pennsylvania, United States, 22 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJames (Jim) Louis Wagner, Triple-Lee Jerseys, Hamlin, Pennsylvania, United States, 22 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMyranda Bond, Hunterdon County Dairy Princess, Flemington, New Jersey, United States, 20 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSam Fasolo, Retired Farmer, Hunterdon County Fair, Flemington, New Jersey, United States, 20 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTractor Pull, Hunterdon County Fair, Flemington, New Jersey, United States, 20 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJames Cafaro, Hunterdon County Fair, Flemington, New Jersey, United States, 20 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRobert (Bob) Johnson, Johnson’s Farm, Stockton, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDeer Hide, Johnson’s Farm, Stockton, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDoris Johnson, Johnson’s Farm, Stockton, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTheodore (Ted) Johnson, Johnson’s Farm, Stockton, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDining Room, Johnson’s Farm, Stockton, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLandon (Buck) Johnson, Johnson’s Farm, Stockton, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nHunterdon Concrete, Flemington, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFreight Train, Delaware River, between Phillipsburg, NJ and Easton, PA, United States, 22 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nNadia Ayakowsky, Actress and Singer, Hotel National, Frenchtown, New Jersey, United States, 21 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nState Senate Chamber, New Jersey State House, Trenton, New Jersey, United States, 18 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nYankee Doodle Tap Room, The Nassau Inn, Princeton, New Jersey, United States, 18 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMon 29 Sept: Turning the corner of Cape May and heading back up along the Delaware Bay you are entering South Jersey – geographically, culturally and economically a very different area than the prosperous Jersey Shore. Covered in swamplands, creeks, salt marshes and pine forests the landscape is part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain that extends all the way down from New York Bight to Florida. Locally, they call South Jersey ‘the Mississippi of the North’ with a historic divide between black and white communities. Religion is on display everywhere with a different church on every corner. The climate here is subtropical, dense, still, and humid. Commercial farming is still dominating the area known as Pine Barrens where its nutrient-poor soil are ideal for growing acidic fruits such as cranberries and blueberries. Rural poverty is visible in and around Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton area with many key industries gone or closing down, such as lumber mills, the glass factories and the oyster industry in the ghost towns of Port Norris and Bivalve. In Cumberland County alone you have four prisons within a 10 mile radius which not only provide jobs for thousands of people in the penal industry but also brings with it crime related problems. Out of sight out of mind. Many people from North Jersey has never been down south. The atmosphere is one of desolation and redemption, but as in many economically deprived areas you will also find the most warm and generous of people. There is no real comparison to any communities living in the Isle of Jersey, except that time on the west coast of the island stands still in the same way as it lingers on in South Jersey, at its own pace and carefree of outside influences.\n\nShiloh Baptist Church, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 13 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJustin Fearon, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 16 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFarm Park, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 16 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nEmpty Pool (used for Baptism), Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 16 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCrucifix, Maramatha Baptist Church, Bridgeton, New Jersey, United States, 16 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPrayer, True Vine Pentecostal Church, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nScarecrow, Lower Hopewell, Bridgeton, New Jersey, United States, 14 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJoel Allen, True Vine Pentecostal Church, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nZamarah Corley, True Vine Pentecostal Church, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPosted Private Property, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPastor Hopeton Bartley, True Liberty Church, Bridgeton, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPauline Fearon, Usher, True Liberty Church, Bridgeton, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nShopping Mall, Vineland, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWall Display, Farm Market, Vineland, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAngelo Favretto, Farmer, Vineland, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nOvergrown House, Bridgeton, New Jersey, United States, 15 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nEleanor Favoretto, Retired farmer, Vineland, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nChristmas Decorations, Angelo’s House, Vineland, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTexas Roadhouse, Millville, New Jersey, United States, 17 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPastor Wayne Slaughter’s 60th Birthday Party, Cornbread House Restaurant, Gouldtown, New Jersey, United States, 16 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nKing Crab Ranch and Marina, Port Norris, New Jersey, United States, 13 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nShell Pile, Bivalve, New Jersey, United States, 13 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPort Norris Town, New Jersey, United States, 13 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRoadside Memorial, Millville, New Jersey, United States, 14 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSteven Thomas, Racedriver, New Jersey Motorsports Park, Millville, New Jersey, United States, 14 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nNew Jersey Motorsports Park, Millville, New Jersey, United States, 14 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMillville Army Air Field, Millville Airport, New Jersey, United States, 14 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMillville Army Air Field Museum, Millville Airport, New Jersey, United States, 15 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWalter S.

In 1964, the Bailiff of Jersey, Sir R. H. Le Masurier and his wife spend a weekend here as part of their official visit for the tercentenary celebrations. They stayed in the Presidential Suite at the historical Claridge Hotel and enjoyed a magnificent view of the Atlantic Coast and the famous Boardwalk below. Imagining what they saw 50 years ago I followed in their footsteps and spend a weekend too, at the Claridge. Gambling seems to be on the wane, with a number of well known casinos already closed or in the process of closing down. Although thousands of people from Philidelphia, New York and beyond still flock to the card tables and slot machines with hopes of winning it big, the city did feel a little exhausted from its bright lights and spinning wheels. Coincidently, Jersey in the Channel Islands has for some time been debating if Fort Regent (a large sports facility in St Helier) should become a casino and gambling hall. Recently, new plans have been submitted for a state-of-the-art sport and leisure complex and it seems Jersey is thinking twice about introducing legalised gambling in a small island community. Atlantic City too, is going through a period of transition trying to reinvent itself as a modern resort town that offers more than roulettes and black jack tables. It shall be interesting to see what will happen to an ageing city, that once served as the inspiration for the original version of the board game Monopoly.\n\nRoute 30 to Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAtlantic Wonder Park, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nThomas Broadbeck, Table Games Dealer, Bally’s, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSteel Pier, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTrump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nEmpty Casino Floor, The Claridge Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSlot Machines, Bally’s, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nHallway, Bally’s, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 8 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJames Green, Security, The Claridge Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nChurch of the Ascension, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJoseph Perry, Street Entertainer, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nParking Lot, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBroken Tiles, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nShowboat, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBashir (Bash) Smith, Professional Poker Player, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nState Marina, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCar Park, Golden Nugget Casino & Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGolden Nugget Casino & Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nThe Boardwalk, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAtlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nKorean War Memorial, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nKaraoke, Tropicana Casino and Resort, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCaesar, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nThe Claridge Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAbraham Dukely, Street Cleaner, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 10 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBrigantine Bridge, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, 9 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMon 8 Sept: This post follows on from previous dispatch from Asbury Park and Ocean Grove and features the Jersey Shore, a coastal region that encompasses about 127 miles of ocean front from Sandy Hook in the north to Cape May in the south. It seems everybody in New Jersey flocks to the Atlantic Coast in the summer, or ‘going down the shore’ as locals would phrase it. Famous for its many boardwalks, amusement arcades and water parks as well as it white sand it’s not only a popular vacation spot for New Jerseyans but it attracts people from New York, Philadelphia and Quebec and various other states in the Northeastern USA. In Jersey, Channel Islands the most popular beach is the five mile road in St Ouen’s Bay which too attract both locals and visitors alike. The Atlantic Ocean washes up on both shores but leaves different traces in the sand. Winter storms here can wreck havoc on sea defence systems, but nothing like Superstorm Sandy which damaged many communities along the Shore. Two years later many houses, boardwalks and coastal protection barriers have been rebuild along with a renewed spirit of having fun again. However, Jersey Shore is more than sunshine and sandy beaches. Here in this selection of photographs from communities situated both along the ocean front and the bayside you will find a Catholic retreat, training grounds for the National Guard and old fishing villages, not to mention Atlantic City. But that destination, perhaps NJ’s most famous or infamous place on the Atlantic coast will have its own post next.\n\nChapel Beach Club, Sea Bright, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPool, Chapel Beach Club, Sea Bright, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSea Bright, New Jersey, United States, 30 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPatricia Townsend, Deal, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLong Branch, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nOcean Avenue, Deal, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBrittany Forte, Branded Surf Skate, Long Branch, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nIron Gate, Deal, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRaymond Falack, Surfer, Deal, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBayside, Sea Bright, New Jersey, United States, 30 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMark Morsella, Retired Research Engineer, Loch Arbour, New Jersey, United States, 31 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBelmar, New Jersey, United States, 4 Aug 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nStorage, National Guard Militia Museum, Sea Girt, New Jersey, United States, 4 Aug 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSpecialist Colin M.

side by side along the Atlantic shore. Asbury Park has a rich history as a seaside destination with changing popularity over the years from its growth in 1890s Victorian era to its decline after WWII with the construction of Garden State Parkway, culminating in race riots in 1970 and people deserting its famous boardwalk for other places to visit along the Jersey Shore. In recent years, Asbury Park has experienced a cultural revival with new younger communities moving down from New York bringing with them a renewed creativity of music, arts and food culture. If Asbury is noisy and vibrant then Ocean Grove is calm and conservative. Founded in 1869 by a group of Methodist clergymen as a summer camp meeting site on the New Jersey shore it boasted a set of unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars on the streets of Ocean Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too). This community situated on a square mile of prime coastal land is also known for its many tents put up around its most prominent architectural structure, the Great Auditorium build in 1894 as a theatre-style arena with cushioned seating capacity for 6250 pilgrims. Historically, the Isle of Jersey also has a strong Methodist influence, both in legislature and culture. Tourism in the island similarly began during Queen Victoria’s reign with improvements of transport links with mainland England and reached it’s heyday in the postwar period from 1950s to the 1980s. Today, the tourism industry is not a major contributor to the local economy although a re-branding of Jersey as an attractive holiday destination is taking place.\n\nTamika Tolliver, Beach, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCasino Entrance, Boardwalk, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWestside, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nParadise, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFaith van Wart, Sales Associate, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nThe Stone Pony Summer Stage, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBack Alley, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGolden Clippers, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSister, Our Lady of Mt Carmel Roman Catholic Church, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFather George, Our Lady of Mt Carmel Roman Catholic Church, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSigns, Our Lady of Mt Carmel Roman Catholic Church, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSherman Thomas, Sound Engineer at LA Vision Studio, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTupac & Biggie, LA Vision Studio, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWaiting Room, Golden Clippers, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nUnisex Hair Salon, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLois White, Artist and Executive Director, Exhibit No. 9, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCrystal Ballroom, Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel Asbury Park (originally named Berkeley-Carteret Hotel), New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nEran Silverberg, Wedding Reception, Berkeley Oceanfront Hotel Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMatt Kelly, Cook, Boardwalk, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nResidential home, Asbury Park Avenue, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLeroy Williams James, Landscape Gardener, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nA Chat and A Nibble, Asbury Park Avenue, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDeal Lake, Between Deal and Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 30 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRichard Thomas and Sam Rock, Police Officers, Boardwalk, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nKarl, 1st Avenue, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBoarded Up, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRasul Darryl, Shop Owner, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 2 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJames H Bradley, Founder of Asbury Park, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDan Waszay, Musician, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 30 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nColonial Motel, Asbury Park Avenue, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 3 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAtlantic Ocean, Asbury Park, New Jersey, United States, 1 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nResidential Home, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, United States, 4 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTent City, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, United States, 4 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nOcean Grove Auditorium, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, United States, 4 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRonald Naldi, Tenor Soloist, Ocean Grove Auditorium, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, United States, 4 August 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTue 12 Aug 2014: Imagine what Philip de Carteret and his entourage from Jersey saw as they entered Raritan Bay, New Jersey at the Southern area of Lower New York Bay in August 1665. The Bay is named after the Raritans, a branch of the Lenape Indians who lived in the vicinity of the bay for thousand years prior to the arrival of European colonists. Here is a selection of photographs from communities of Monmouth County living along Raritan Bay and Sandy Hook Bay. Sandy Hook is a large sand barrier peninsula and a recreational park with uninterrupted view of the Manhattan skyline. Managed by Gateway National Recreation Area, it’s six miles of sand and bay beaches is a popular place for 2 million visitors annually who enjoy its historic landmarks, natural areas and recreational facilities. At the very tip is the Sandy Hook Lighthouse and the U.S. Army deactivated Fort Hancock, which served as an active military installation from 1874 until 1975. Most people who live in Jersey, Channel Islands will head to St Ouen’s Bay for relaxation and a sense of wilderness. Sandy Hook Bay shares that same purpose, both geographically and culturally.\n\nRah’miere Sanders, Raritan Bay Waterfront Park, South Amboy, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nKeansburg Amusement Park, Keansburg, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPizzabar, Keansburg Amusement Park, Keansburg, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWilliam Anderson, Keansburg Amusement Park, Keansburg, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBelford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nInlet, Belford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPhilip Kaylor, Maintenance, Belford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMaintenance Workshop, Belford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFrank Way, Deckhand, Belford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDisused Packing House, Belford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nEdward Alesoz, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFork Truck, Belford Seafood Co-operative, Belford, New Jersey, United States, 29 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nShore Casino, Atlantic Highlands Marina, New Jersey, United States, 30 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTop Floor, East Pointe Apartment Block, Highlands, New Jersey, United States, 30 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMason Wye (92), Retired.

They had entered the Raritan Bay and travelled up Arthur Kill (an anglicisation of the Dutch language achter kill meaning back channel) – a tidal strait and major navigational channel separating Staten Island, New York City from mainland New Jersey. This stretch of water is also referred to as Chemical Coastline due to its vast area of petroleum and chemical plants situated along its shores. Here is a selection of photographs of people and places, including the Borough of Carteret along this coastal area stretching from Elizabeth to Perth Amboy.\n\nDaquin and Tae, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCleaning, Oak Grand Motel, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSamuel Saul Hart, African-American, Retired Railroad worker, Elizabeth, New Jersey, Unites States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJoyce Chiu, Taiwanese, Owner of Martin’s Restaurant, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBust of Elias Boudinot, Boxwood Hall, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFrank D’Adamo, Italian, Barber, Martin Building Barbershop, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nIglesia Cristiana El Redentor, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSajado Stuckey, African-American, Musician, Elizabeth River, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nNew Jersey Turnpike, Elizabeth River, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nElizabeth River, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWarehouses, Elizabethport, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 24 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJohn Ogden’s Bible (founding father of Elizabethtown) Geneva Edition, 1599 − 1610, First Presbyterian Church, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSheila Robinson, Cook and Honorary Member of the First Presbyterian Church, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSinger Factories, Elizabethport, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAngel Luis Cedeno, Puerto-Rican, Owner of George’s Lunch, Singer Factories, Elizabethport, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGeorge’s Lunch, Singer Factories, Elizabethport, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRezearti Beshi, Albanian, Truck driver and owner of Alpha I Transport, Singer Factories, Elizabethport, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDerelict bridge, Elizabeth River mouth, Elizabethport, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDuarte-Marti School, Elizabethport, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDaniel and Junior, Baseball practice, Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBayway Refinery, Port of New York and New Jersey, Linden and Elizabeth, New Jersey, United States, 25 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nEntrance to New Jersey Turnpike, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMajor Singh, Gardener, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJoseph Medwick Mobile Park, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\n16 Birthday party, Port Reading, Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSteven Aleno, Demolition contractor, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCarteret Abattoir, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 27 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDisused railroad track, Port of Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPetroleum Tanks, Port Reading Refinery, Woodbridge, New Jersey, United States, 27 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPersonal photographs, James Palfi, Hungarian, retired Electrical Contractor, Veteran’s Pier, Carteret Waterfront Park Boat Launch, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTyra and Khalil, Veteran’s Pier, Carteret Waterfront Park Boat Launch, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 26 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJFK, Mayor’s Office, Memorial Municipal Building, Carteret, New Jersey, United States, 28 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDaniel J.

The photographs in this last post from Jersey’s west coast are from St Ouen’s Manor, the ancestral home of the de Carteret family. These images attempt to show both in a factual and a poetic way how this manor house, which dates back to the 12th Century emerges from an ancient past as the traditional home of the Seigneur of St Ouen to a modern leisure venue staging private weddings and corporate functions without loosing its historical significance and charm for people in the Channel Islands. In a few days we will be making our way to New Jersey to begin our journey of mapping, in a new photographic document both the historical and the contemporary between two places who share the same name, but are separated by the Atlantic.\n\nCharles Mallet de Carteret, Seigneur of St Ouen, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRestorations, Ruth Rolls, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 13 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSquirrel ornaments, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 7 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nReflection, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRoman Catholic Priest, François Scornet Memorial, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFrançois Scornet Memorial, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFrançois Scornet’s Axe and Woggle, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 7 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFire in the Attic, German Occupation, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMarquee Chairs, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 7 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAdele Mallet de Carteret, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 7 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPaul Botrel, Grounds Manager, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLetter from King Charles II, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWhite Horses, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDove Cote, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 13 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWedding Marquee, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nJim Hardey, Joiner, Basement, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWalled Garden, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWedding Reception, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nVivier, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nTrumpeteer, François Scornet Memorial, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSt Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBranchage, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 2 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBest Man, Wedding Reception, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAmerican Visitors, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 2 July 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDusk, St Ouen’s Manor, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 28 June 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFri 11 July: St Ouen is often perceived as the most traditional of Jersey’s parishes partly owing to its farthermost geographic position from St Helier, the island’s capital. However, as traditional lifestyles such as farming and fishing slowly diminish and new folk move out west, identities shift and add to the social landscape. A parish is a microcosm which can only thrive when its inhabitants actively engage in their community through work or leisure. This post features photographs of parish life, both private and public.\n\nOfficer’s Mesh Uniform, Major Michael John Barthorpe, La Croute, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 15 May 2014 © Martin

The evidence of oyster shells found at La Hougue Bie, Jersey a Neolithic passage grave constructed between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago is indicative of ancient fishing and maritime traditions. Jersey has been the birthplace of adventurous mariners over the centuries. From as far back as the sixteenth century Jersey ships ventured across the Atlantic Ocean to exploit the rich cod fisheries off the coast of British North America (Canada). By the nineteenth century a number of prominent Jersey mercantile families had established well developed trade bases in Canada, South America and Europe completing what Rosemary Ommer has described as the Jersey ‘cod trade triangle’.[1] Managed from the island metropole, this triangular trade system involved the capture and processing of dried cod fish in Canada for transportation and sale in the ports of Brazil where vessels were loaded with return cargoes including coffee, sugar and hardwood ballast. Today Jersey fishermen predominantly fish local waters for high value shell fish catches such as lobster and crab. Here is a set of photographs from Grève de Lecq on the North Coast of St Ouen which still hosts a small fishing community.

Jersey is no different and religion has a complex history and much diversity, considering the size of the island. Here are a few photographs from some of the more traditional church communities.\n\nPolish Altar Server, Easter Sunday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 20 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nStairway to Choir Gallery, Good Friday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nBethesda Methodist Church, St Ouen’s Bay, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 19 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSunday Service, Bethesda Methodist Church, St Ouen’s Bay, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 11 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nReverend Ian Pallent, St Ouens Church, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 6 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCongretation, St Ouens Church, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 6 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSunday School, St Ouens Church, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 6 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nSunday Make & Bake Pre-school, Bethesda Methodist Church, St Ouen’s Bay, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 11 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAnthony Pezet, Altar Server, Good Friday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGood Friday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nPrayer, Methodist Church, Trodez, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFrancisco Brazao, Good Friday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDr Omissi’s Chair, St Saviour, Jersey, Channel Islands, 16 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nKrystian Skarbek, Polish Altar Boy, Easter Sunday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMontsignor Nicholas France, Good Friday, St Thomas Catholic Church, Jersey, Channel Islands, 18 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMen’s Breakfast Club, St Andrew’s Church, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 19 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRobyn Pullin, St Andrew’s Church, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 19 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMethodist Church, Trodez, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 24 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nHugh Lince, Methodist Church, Trodez, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGraveyard, St Ouens Church, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 30 March 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nHannah Vibert, St Andrew’s Church, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 19 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMon 12 May: The 9th May is Liberation Day in Jersey and the other Channel Islands. This public holiday marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Channel Islands from World War Two military occupation by Nazi Germany 1940-1945. Flags are the adopted symbols of national identity on Liberation Day and on 9th May you will see both Jersey’s own flag – showing the red saltire cross and the three leopards of Normandy surmounted by a crown – alongside the union flag hung from windows, doors and flag poles throughout the island. For islanders Liberation Day is the opportunity to reflect upon the experience and history of German Occupation and to celebrate freedom. Through the establishment of the tradition of an annual celebration of Liberation during a public holiday the event has also gained momentum as the island’s ‘National Day.’ While official ceremonies and government meetings take place in the Jersey capital of St Helier and the eleven other parishes, Liberation Day is marked in public and private ways across the island. These photographs, mainly taken near the west coast of Jersey, show the 69th anniversary of Liberation as it happened in 2014.\n\nLiberation Day, La Ville De La Croix, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nGerman Tourists, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLiberation Service, Methodist Church, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nMrs Elaine A’Court, Worship Leader, Methodist Church, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFlags, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCharlie Blampied, Trade Council, Jersey Slave Workers Memorial Service, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor Sir John McColl, the Bailiff of Jersey Sir Michael Birt and Chief Minister Ian Gorst, Jersey Slave Workers Memorial, Westmount, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLt-Colonel, Sergey Savunov, Assistant Air-Attache to the Embassy, Russian Federation, Jersey Slave Workers Memorial, Westmount, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nOfficial’s cars, Jersey Slave Workers Memorial, Westmount, St Helier, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nVal and June’s Street Party, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nAnita Smith, Val and June’s Street Party, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nLiberation Day BBQ, Heathmount, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nShots, Heathmount, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRocksteady’s 7th Birthday Liberation Party, Watersplash, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nWatersplash, Liberation Day, St Ouen, Jersey, Channel Islands, 9 May 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFri 2 May: The generosity of people I have met during my travels around the west coast of Jersey has been tremendous. As in most cases the camera has been an invitation for residents to open up their home and to some extent their lives telling me stories about times gone and times to be had. In this post, I want to celebrate three incredible individuals that have welcomed me inside and allowed me to record both in pictures and interviews memories of a life lived. They have one thing in common which is, that they are all widowed and often they spoken lovingly about their deceased partner. First up, is Osmund Simon who as a teenager during the German occupation of Jersey from 1940-45 made illegal crystal radio sets. Also living through the war years, and experiencing a great deal of adversity in her long life is Mrs De La Haye, or ‘Midge’ as she is known locally in the parish, who last year in November celebrated her 100 year birthday. Lastly, we have Gerald Rowland who grew up in St Ouen’s farming and working as a joiner. His passion is music and he has taught himself how to play, first the organ and then afterwards the accordion.\n\nOsmund Simon, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 5 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nCrystal Radio Set, Osmund’s house, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 5 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nDining room, Osmund’s house, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 5 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nFamily Bible, Osmund’s house, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 5 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nOsmund’s house, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 5 April 2014 © Martin Toft\n\nRemembering ‘my young lady’, Osmund Simon, St Peter, Jersey, Channel Islands, 5 April 2014"
