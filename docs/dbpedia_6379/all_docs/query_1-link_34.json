        "text": "In what follows, I will point to theorization of concept of the experimental film. My main thesis is that experimental art is based on the project, research practice, innovation and open transgressive or subversive artworks. Art focused on subversion of institutional power features as a singular event performed within a particular social relationship, as a critical actionist, engaged, or activist practice. Transgression – literally – refers to: infraction, violation of a law or an order, while in geological terms it implies penetration and expansion of the sea over the mainland. The notion of transgression relates to excess, overrunning or, more precisely, departing the familiar for the unknown, control for freedom. Experimental art was created in different disciplines such as experimental music, experimental film, experimental theater, etc. John Cage’s concept of ‘experimental music’ has been the starting point for new experimental art and artistic practices since 1950. Experimenta...\n\nIt is difficult to overstate the impact the British journal Screen has had on the discipline of film and television studies. For the past 50 years, the journal has consistently been at the centre of debates around how we watch why we watch, and what all this watching actually means. Moreover, when it came to film theorising, Screen for a very long time set the agenda. Today the journal’s back catalogue reads like a rollcall of canonical, game-changing texts, and the most (in)famous fruit of this labour, so-called “1970s Screen Theory” – that curious mélange of Althusserian Marxism and Lacanian psychoanalysis (with just a dash of feminist theory) remains an equally decisive and divisive point in film theory, marking either the height of activist political en gagement with cinema and contemporary culture more broadly, or the nadir of rational film theorising, depending on your vantage point.\n\nOn the one hand, the mirror-screen, on the other the sensitive screen. The mirror-screen is a “reflecting surface on which an image is projected, or which intercepts it, without retaining anything of it—the screen that is by design insensitive, and which must get in the way of any imprint, so that the image arrives, before going back to white, once the projection is over.” The whole history of film is dependent upon this accepted meaning of screen. The sensitive screen, on the other hand, is “equipped with memory, in the depths of which an image is deposited or formed, without there being any need, in the end of the day [at least], for any exhibition or any projection, any more than any developer, but by simple injection, manipulation, or transfer of signals.” (Hubert Damisch)\n\nWhen examining the interrelations between art and cinema, theater must be taken into account: the modeof theatricality, long banished in fine art, made the rounds especially in those art films that dealt with theintersections of the social and medial staging of roles. In this context, one can find a special affinity to the toposof the rehearsal, since it appears suitable to reveal and press ahead with the dedifferentiation of “real” and“fictive” roles and actions. The rehearsal appears as an improvised and staged form of “making of” as well as abiopolitically charged model situation in which the practicing of socio-medial role identities under the prevailingpower and hierarchy relations is to be made visible.\n\nWhereas recent commentators have suggested that consumer demand, typecasting and marketing lead performers to maintain continuities across films, I argue that cinema has historically made it difficult to subtract performers from roles, leading to relatively constant comportment, and that casting, marketing and audience preference are not only causes but also effects of this. I do so using thought experiments and empirical experiments, for example, by pondering why people say they see Jesus in paintings of him and rarely mention models, but stress that they see actors when encountering photographic stills of performers portraying him. Arguably, this relates to what photographs have historically come to mean, and these meanings would make it difficult for audiences to subtract and not see the actor. Based on such thinking, along with what filmmakers have said and done, and adding to classic accounts of Cavell, Santayana and others, I build the case that cinematic media invite performers to play themselves."
