The thought that guides this essay can be formulated in this way: every name, insofar as it is the name of an event and is itself an event, tends to produce a totalising effect, even if the name — and even if the event — are not exhausted in that effect. The hypothesis that this essay endeavours to substantiate — albeit without appealing to any methodological canons of verification — assumes the following form: in this century Heidegger and Adorno have experienced the force and power of the event in question, and consequently that of the name in question, as few other thinkers have done. And this most tellingly where the opposition between them seems to leap out at us most obviously: there where Heidegger — with explicit reference to Holderlin - speaks of Germania and Adorno speaks after Auschwitz. In their own way and in their own language both thinkers have acknowledged the power of the name, and have inevitably fallen victim to that power themselves. Their thought can therefore teach us the impossibility of escaping the power of the name. And likewise the necessity of calling the event by its name, of perceiving the name as more than simply a conventional sign - more than an external linguistic mark of an event - and of recognising our subjection to the ineliminable blindness and opacity of the name.\n\n2\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nThe approach adopted in this essay is not that of a systematic investigation of the concept of the name, which degrades Adorno and Heidegger to the status of 'examples' of a philosophical position. Nor is it a comparative examination of the history of philosophy, one which would content itself with revealing the possible influence each thinker had upon the other, or perhaps with demonstrating an unbridgeable gulf between them. The approach taken here reflects a mode of argumentation at once static and dynamic, namely that of 'principled over-interpretation' which Adorno identified as characteristic of the essay: 'In comparison with other forms, in which a given content is indifferently communicated, the essay appears by virtue of the tension between presentation and presented subject-matter as more dynamic than traditional forms of thinking, but at the same time, by virtue of its constructed juxtaposition, it also appears as more static.'1 If this kind of'principled over-interpretation', conditioning as it does a peculiar equalisation of static moments with dynamic moments, is to represent anything more than an arbitrary exercise, then it is solely because the essay as form 'responds to the blind spots in its objects', to that which strikes the concept itself with blindness. This blind spot, which stands in a relation of tension to the concept, and which can never be entirely dominated by the latter or brought into a symmetrical state of domesticated equilibrium with it — for it appears to conceptual knowledge as a case of blindness — is and has always been, if one follows the argument of Negative Dialectics, precisely the name. It is only of the name, and after a naming has occurred, that such over-interpretations are possible. And it is only overinterpretations that can do justice to the name in principle. The name itself dictates the form of the following essay precisely insofar as the name can never be entirely conceptually resolved or dissolved, although thought continually finds itself referred back to it - to the (be)-naming of the event and the event of (be)-naming. Auschwitz and Germanien are names of an event and mark a separation, a distance which cannot simply be reduced to a question of chronology (Heidegger continued to maintain the pre-eminence of the German language throughout his life, and Adorno did not explicitly develop a philosophy before Auschwitz — which naturally does not mean that he\n\nIntroduction: Of (From) Germania - after (to) Auschwitz\n\n3\n\nwrote no philosophical works before the 1940s2). They are names that represent, for all the essential differences involved here, for all the differences of perceptiveness and perspicacity, the blind spot in the thought of Heidegger and in the thought of Adorno. The following essay deciphers the instant of affirmation, of 'yea-saying', which Adorno like Nietzsche identified as the true measure of the essay, as the instant in which the name and the event are affirmed, as the instant that precedes all thought and without which there would be no thought, were the event the most terrible event and the name the most terrifying name.3 The dynamics involved here will reveal themselves all the more intensively, the more the statics of apparently unmediated and juxtaposed elements is emphasised. That is the purpose of the present essay on Adorno and Heidegger. The argument is not itself conducted from the perspective of one or other of these thinkers. The irreconcilable character of the names will not be softened, and their doubling — two names of a single event — will not be transformed or unified into a whole. Adorno's critique of the ontological need, of being and existence, of 'the jargon of authenticity' will remain largely undiscussed — though certainly not unread — since the task here is not to examine the justification or plausibility of this critique. It is, however, assumed that such an examination, whatever the eventual result, would make no essential or decisive difference to the hypothesis explored here. On the contrary, it is even possible that the hypothesis will, for the first time, shed light upon the critique in question.4 The name marks the limit of 'negative dialectics' and of the 'destruction' or 'overcoming' of metaphysics, even if these approaches themselves first serve to reveal the limiting and limited character of the name. That is precisely what this essay — this over-interpretation — is intended to show. Hermann Morchen has described the relationship between Adorno and Heidegger as a 'refusal of philosophical communication'. The substantial volume which he dedicated to this 'refusal' — consisting of a 'prelude' and a 'more comprehensive treatment' - is consistently oriented towards 'the possibility of a convergent philosophising'.5 If philosophy is intrinsically oriented towards communication and such communication is refused -\n\n4\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nthe choice of the word already reveals the priority accorded to discussion and communication - then the task must be precisely to seek out and to expose such convergence. The section of the book that is entitled 'Philosophy after Auschwitz' begins with a sentence that clearly reveals the difficulties which beset Morchen's entire enterprise: 'It is more than superficially obvious that the manner in which the experience of the Third Reich entered into the motivation of Heidegger's thinking is utterly different from the way in which that experience also proved decisive for Adorno.'6 Morchen does not wish to reduce the character of this difference simply to a 'refusal of communication'. It is questionable whether one will be able to identify convergence if one can no longer appeal to 'the delusions of absolutised positions' and if one must consequently distance oneself from the danger of producing 'an all too levelling perspective': if there is thus no longer any first or immediate view of the matter which would fail to see through the 'absolutised positions'. Is not the idea of an 'all too levelling perspective', which quantitatively posits purely gradual distinctions, 'all too levelling'? It is precisely at this point — precisely 'here' as Morchen himself emphasises — that the question concerning the possibility of 'philosophical communication' and 'convergent philosophising' reveals its full relevance. For if the distorted interpretations and absolutised perspectives are nothing but a symptom of a subjective refusal, of a certain incapacity on the part of the thinking subject, this certainly raises the problem of communication, but one that is basically without any specific philosophical relevance. If we are to speak meaningfully of a 'philosophical refusal of communication', then the reasons for the latter cannot be merely contingent empirical ones, or even reasons grounded in the conditions of intellectual or cultural history. It must be the object of thinking itself which 'motivates' the refusal in question. Morchen's investigation in the section on 'Philosophy after Auschwitz' is more a collection of quotations than an example of rigorous argument. He calls 'Auschwitz' a 'defining code-word for everything that most inwardly motivates [Adorno's] intellectual labours,'7 and refers to a passage from the Notes to Literature in which Adorno — allegedly — identifies this code-word as the name of a 'limit situation'. We are supposed to recognise Adorno's thinking as a thinking of extremity precisely in and\n\nIntroduction: Of (From) Germania - after (to) Auschwitz\n\n5\n\nthrough the word 'Auschwitz'. (Morchen certainly mentions other possible interpretations, but he appears to appropriate this interpretation of the name as a 'defining code-word' for himself.) In fact, Adorno claims just the opposite, since the term 'limit situation' is itself an expression of the jargon of authenticity: 'Today everything is indeed objectively prescribed that would bestow meaningful sense upon existence, and even the denial of such sense, as with official nihilism, degenerated into a case of positivist assertion, an instance of delusion, that would if it could justify the despair of the world as its own essential content, in speaking of Auschwitz as a \"limit situation\".'8 Auschwitz cannot be the defining code-word of Adorno's thought because the act which subsumes this name under the concept of a 'limit situation' is tantamount to a justification of what is being named. It is all the more astonishing that Morchen overlooks this here since Adorno expressly introduces the text in question — 'On the Final Scene of Goethe's Faust' — by demanding an 'interpretative submersion into the texts which have been handed down to us': 'Shame resists the immediate expression of metaphysical intentions.' The misreading which violates this shame — this name — is a far from trivial one: it actually prevents Morchen from relating the problem of the name which is meant to be a 'defining code-word' (does not a 'defining code-word' also and invariably function as a name?) to the problem of meaning itself, and therefore to that of a possible communication. It prevents him from creating a connection in which nothing would seem to be more difficult or more pressing than the prospect of 'convergent philosophising'. In his early 'Remarks on Karl Jaspers' \"Psychology of World-Views\" ' (1919-21) Heidegger had already objected to the concept of the 'limit situation' which was itself coined by Jaspers. Heidegger argued that the 'antinomies' which are experienced in or as these situations at the limit (antinomies which destroy any unified totality insofar as they are oppositions conceived 'from the perspective of the absolute, from the perspective of value') cannot simply be 'rationally defined' or grasped as 'contradictions'. Any such 'distorting theoretical approach', designed as it is to grasp 'concrete cases as a series of consecutive contradictions', would already fail to identify the 'authentic significance' of the limit situation.9 (One should not\n\n6\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nforget that, two years after the expression of this critique, Heidegger was attempting to form a philosophical 'common front' with Jaspers.10) Does 'convergent philosophising' (only) occur in limit situations? While on the one hand Morchen ascribes to the 'defining code-word' - the name 'Auschwitz' - a meaning that, according to Adorno, it cannot possess, on the other hand he reproaches Adorno for indulging in a certain excess of signification, for a certain shameless ostentation. Can anyone continue to live after Auschwitz? This question of Adorno's prompts Morchen to the following reflection: 'Sympathy with the suffering and the oppressed is, very differently than with Heidegger, so ostentatiously presented as the motivating ground of Adorno's thought that certain doubts might arise as a result. This is not to deny the sincerity with which Adorno himself pondered upon such sympathy.'11 What, then, are the doubts which might arise from the ostentation of the philosopher? It is precisely because he did not make 'sympathy with the suffering and the oppressed' into the 'motivating ground' of his thought, precisely because he did not subject his thought to the name 'Auschwitz', precisely because he refused ostentatiously to pursue the path from Germania to Auschwitz, to pursue the question of Germania after Auschwitz, that Heidegger's thought appears so 'crassly' different from that of Adorno. Morchen thereby seems to be suggesting the following dilemma: the more one emphasises the fact that Heidegger — in contrast to Adorno — remained silent about 'Auschwitz' and cited the concentration camps merely as an example of the question concerning technology, the more succour one provides for those who regard this fact precisely as evidence of the truth of his thought; as evidence that 'sympathy with the suffering and the oppressed' is in truth a far more profound 'motivating ground' of Heidegger's thought than all ostentatious attention to the former would initially suggest. This dilemma, which could also be reversed (Heidegger remains ostentatiously silent and calls nothing by its real name, while Adorno utters the name itself), has its origin in the immeasurable and excessive character of the name. The name as name of an event and as event of language (the name of an event must be an event of language) cannot be exhausted by conceptual thought (other-\n\nIntroduction: Of (From) Germania - after (to) Auschwitz\n\n7\n\nwise the eventful character itself would be subsumable under the concept, would be nothing but a given fact). The name is therefore characterised both by an excess and a deficiency of meaning.12 In other words: the name, in whose name one is arguing, always also escapes the domain of meaningful conceptual argumentation. Hence one constantly ascribes to the name a meaning which it cannot possess (one already does so by inserting it within a semantic context for whose necessity the name itself provides the ground: . . . to Auschwitz ..., . . . after Auschwitz ...). Neither the uttering of the name nor the refusal to utter it can function as an appropriate measure here: silent refusal and explicit utterance alike expose themselves to the suspicion of ostentation, and thus in the last analysis to the suspicion of avoidance. Yet these alternatives remain irreconcilable and present a challenge which itself cannot be evaded. Their incommensurability in the case of Heidegger and Adorno is all the greater because Heidegger did in fact once break his silence. That he seemed to content himself with mentioning the camps as an example of the question concerning technology, that he allowed himself to mention them simply as one example amongst a number of others, has struck Philippe LacoueLabarthe as 'scandalously inadequate'.13 And the fact that Adorno also recognised the aporias of speaking out and remaining silent about the subject serves only to increase the incommensurability of the engagement with Heidegger. If 'all culture after Auschwitz, including its urgent critique, is garbage' (ND:359; ET:367),14 then philosophy itself, which is necessary precisely because 'silence only promotes barbarism', also ineluctably falls victim to ostentation; through its mere existence, its own right to be, philosophy already pleads 'for the continued survival of a radically guilty and shabby culture'. Conversely, it is because of its essential - 'objective' - inappropriateness, that silence must be regarded as a 'subjective incapacity' that is just as ostentatious in its effects: 'Not even silence can escape the circle; it merely rationalises one's own subjective incapacity with the status of objective truth, and thus once again devalues the latter into a lie' (ND:360; ET:367). One will have to utter the name 'Auschwitz' and attempt to elucidate the event in conceptual terms without the prospect of protecting oneself from the force and blindness of the name. From this perspec-\n\n8\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\ntive, it is surely significant that Morchen abandons all conceptual criteria with regard to the 'one-sidedness' of this name (and thus once again with regard to the issue of ostentation or what might prevent it): The usual criticism directed against Adorno's 'model of Auschwitz', and that of a 'negative' dialectics in general, complains not merely about its one-sidedness, but above all about its failure to draw positive consequences. Let us not endorse such (superficially valid) objections for our own part! They merely blunt the force of Adorno's urgent appeal and, insofar as they escape obscurity by recourse to a supposedly secure ethical and political doctrine behind them, actually reveal no solidarity with his own passionate errors. Adorno's truth is no more to be had without the latter than is Heidegger's; one must struggle through it with him.15 These remarks - they occur at the end of the section on 'Philosophy after Auschwitz' — may well be evaluated in opposing ways, but they remain quite unintelligible unless they are brought into relation to the immeasurable and excessive character of the name. For what distinguishes this injunction 'one must struggle through it with him' (an appeal which is supposed to apply to Adorno and to Heidegger: to Germania and to Auschwitz) from a case of simple exhortation? Morchen does not grasp the possibility of 'convergent philosophising' radically enough. Which is to say that he ignores the constraints of the name. The use of the name implies - if we wish to use the language of Karl-Otto Apel in this connection — a 'performative selfcontradiction' in which thought (the thought of the name and of the event) necessarily becomes entangled. But such a contradiction is not actually a 'performative self-contradiction' since this term already asserts and establishes the essential primacy of philosophical discourse. Apel leaves us in no doubt that it is a reflexive criterion which is at issue here, a criterion which governs argumentational reasoning and conceptual thought, the discursive rationality which is supposed to ground all theory: The proscription concerning the performative self-contradiction is not introduced here like that concerning the proposi-\n\nIntroduction: Of (From) Germania - after (to) Auschwitz\n\n9\n\ntional contradiction 'a and non-a' which functions as an axiom of logical theory. It results rather from an act of reflective insight: from the insight that the introduction of any conceivable theory, or of any conceivable axioms, already presupposes the performative self-consistency of discourse. The demand for self-consistency thus does not rest upon a particular assertion or decision, but constitutes rather the condition of the possibility of any potentially intelligible assertion or decision; as such it represents something that is irreducibly ultimate as far as thought or argumentation are concerned.16 The moment that the event is named in philosophical discourse one has already assumed reflexive or conceptual criteria of argumentative communication which are suspended by the uttering of the name. The name compels us to transcend the philosophical discourse that measures itself by such criteria, and in accordance with its own claims must so measure itself. That is why inauguration and guilt are inextricably entwined with one another in the essence of the name. The possibility of 'convergent philosophising', the anticipation of the ideal conditions of discourse which this involves, find themselves thwarted by the name. Does not the name then simply transform itself into an arbitrary name? Does not such discourse which transpires in the name of — another — name then resist all rational verification in principle? Is it not then impossible to justify why it is necessary to comprehend thinking precisely as thinking after Auschwitz?17 One could answer these questions in accordance with Adorno by stating that the name demands the labour of the concept precisely because it transcends the concept and invites such transcendence. It is the irreducible indecidability itself which provokes a decision; the price which must be paid for the conceptually grounded decision (from/of Germania — to/after Auschwitz) is the undecidability conditioned by the name, by the blindness peculiar to it. Insofar as it thwarts the possibility of'convergent philosophising', the name also enables intellectual engagement in the first place. Adorno does not isolate the name, but considers it rather in terms of its own profoundly tense relation to the concept. The name is therefore not to be regarded as some indivisible unity located in a site beyond the concept. And\n\n10\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nis not Heidegger too caught in an arbitrary attempt to prevent the coming of the name which is inscribed within originary and inaugural naming as the repetition of origination and inauguration? As a thinking after Auschwitz Adorno's philosophy is the thinking of guilty debt', but at the same time the name inaugurates thought. As a thinking of Germania Heidegger's philosophy is a thinking of inauguration', but at the same time the name which is to be repeated only increases the guilty debt. Where guilty debt and inauguration are intertwined in thought in such a way as this, thought must also be memory.\n\n1\n\nFate and Sacrifice The average outlook tends initially to take the thought of being 'guilty' in the sense of being 'indebted'. Martin Heidegger Adorno's comparison\n\nHow can thinking be indebted to something? What are the consequences of thought remaining indebted and owing something? What does the debt of thought consist in? These are questions one cannot help asking if one considers the following passage from Negative Dialectics in which Adorno compares Heidegger's philosophy to a 'highly developed system of credit': 'According to a well-worn witticism it is the debtor who has the advantage over the creditor since the latter after all depends on whether the former ever pays up — it is much the same with Heidegger who profits from all his unpaid debts . . . Whatever critique identifies as its target, it can always be disqualified as a misunderstanding' (ND:84; ET:76). If we ignore the fact that misunderstandings perhaps arise only through a critique which, in accordance with its own selfunderstanding, attempts above all to identify and fix its object, we could well ask whether Adorno's comparison does not touch upon a problem at the very centre of his own thinking, of the thought of the non-identical. 'Being' is neither a concept nor a fact and, according to Adorno, is therefore 'exempt from criticism' (a claim that surely unsettles this concept of critique rather than it does the question concerning the meaning of being); but so too the non-identical is neither a simple fact of the matter nor something purely conceptual, and nor is it something else again that might in turn be identified in its own right. Adorno's comparison remains ambivalent. For in the light of\n\n14\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nthe reflections of Adorno and Horkheimer in Dialectic of Enlightenment it is precisely the debt of thought, the fact that thought itself can remain indebted to something, which constitutes its guilt. That Heidegger always owes something, that his thought ultimately reveals itself as useless, precisely because one can never identifiably rely on it, is, from this perspective, a sign that it is not entirely dominated by a quantifiable debt, by the principle of equivalence, by the like-for-like of 'mythic ineluctability'. Could one not even claim that the ambivalence that attends any and every comparison is grounded in the fact that the latter always rests upon a process of bringing different meanings into line, upon a levelling down of meaning which represses or excludes other meanings, and thus perpetually exposes itself to their uncanny and unexpected return? Because of its indebtedness, the moment a comparison posits the principle of equivalence, it also exposes itself to the reversal of its own meaning: a reversal that threatens the principle of equivalence insofar as it springs from the possibility of perpetuating the indebtedness of thought. This perpetuated indebtedness at once sustains and destroys the system of like for like. Guilt repeated\n\nThat thought is guilty, that self-reflection is simply a reflection upon 'its own guilt' (DdA:12; ET:xxii), is the principal idea behind Dialectic of Enlightenment. Self-reflection must therefore take the concept of guilt itself as its immediate theme. The work expressly examines the concept in connection with the mythical origin of law and right: Each of the mythic figures is programmed always to do the same thing. Each is a figure of repetition, and would come to an end should the repetition fail to occur. All bear traces of something which according to the punishment myths of the underworld — those of Tantalus, of Sisyphus, of the Danaans — is founded upon Olympian justice. They are figures of compulsion: the horrible crimes which they commit are the curse laid upon them. Mythic inevitability is defined by the equivalence between the curse, the crime which expiates it, and the guilt arising from the latter, a guilt which in turn reproduces the curse. All justice in history has\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n15\n\nhitherto borne the mark of this pattern. In myth each moment of the cycle discharges the one before it, and thus helps to install the context of guilt as law'. (DdA:77; ET:58) Fate — or 'mythical inevitability' — constitutes a context of guilt because judgement precedes guilt and thereby takes the form of a curse. Guilt is not, originally, a single case of guilt, but is essentially repeated guilt. This is what precipitates the context of such guilt. If the curse, in the primal history of exchange, represents the act of judgement which first installs the principle of equivalence and produces the context of guilt, then the 'ban', as Adorno writes in Negative Dialectics, is itself 'the equivalent of the fetish character of the commodity [in human experience]' (ND:339; ET:346). The schema which supposedly underlies the idea of the context of guilt is derived from a short essay published by Walter Benjamin in 1921 under the title 'Fate and Character'. Returning to this essay may help to clarify the reflections on guilt contained in the later Dialectic of Enlightenment. Recourse to Benjamin In his essay Benjamin leaves no doubt whatsoever that he is not discussing fate and character in a religious sense: 'An order whose only constitutive concepts are misfortune and guilt, and within which there is no conceivable path of liberation (since insofar as something is fate, it is misfortune and guilt) — such an order cannot be religious, however much the misunderstood concept of guilt may seem to suggest that it is.'1 Fate is ineluctable because it can be read only through a single sign — one can never bring it entirely into view as it is 'in itself - or because the equivalence of fortune and misery, of guilt and innocence, is incompatible with its essence. But if one can only read such fate in a single sign, do not then signifier and signified coincide with one another? If we attempt therefore to understand the concept of guilt from the perspective of that of fate, then, according to Benjamin, we must not grasp the relationship of guilt and innocence as a symmetrical relation of opposed terms. The guilt which refers us back to fate and the context of fate has always already recuperated the moment of innocence, and at the same\n\n16\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\ntime stands unrelated to it. Fortune and innocence are both what frees mankind from 'the chain of fated events and the net of one's own fate', and also 'the temptation to the greatest guilt of all, to hubris'. There can only be temptation where fortune and innocence are not 'constitutive categories' of fate, where the downfall of the hero cannot be presupposed. Otherwise temptation would represent nothing but a transition within opposed terms of equal value and significance. This is perhaps the only way one can explain what Benjamin leaves unexplained in his discussion of the significance of fate and guilt in the culture of antiquity: why fortune amongst the ancients is related to fate whereas innocence remains unconnected with it. Benjamin considers the notion of fortune amongst the ancients in some detail in another text written in 1916. There he is already connecting fortune and hubris. The man of antiquity is blessed with fortune because this fortune is assigned to him; when he presents himself as a bearer of destiny, of what is assigned to him, it proves to be disastrous.2 Now the difficulty lies in determining the precise status of this definition of fortune. Benjamin makes it quite clear that a definition is at stake here, that 'the classical Greek articulation of the notion of fate' is for him defined and understood as a temptation to guilt. On the one hand, the absence of reflection3 which is supposed to constitute fortune in antiquity cannot itself be reflective in character — for such reflection would already be an expression of hubris; on the other hand, fortune of this kind finds its measure in the possibility of temptation, in the possibility of reflection - one is blessed with fortune because one can be tempted to appropriate that fortune for oneself, to procure the form of a fortunate human being for oneself. Neither aspect here can be identified as one of two alternatives. On the one hand, fortune and innocence have always held reflection at bay; but then guilt and misery have always transformed fortune and innocence into their opposites. This reversal cannot be made good: fortune exists in antiquity at the cost of its own loss. The loss of fortune has a preliminary character: it has always already occurred. Fortune can entirely elude fate, and the context of guilt, precisely because nothing remains of fortune but the trace of an experience without presence, precisely because it finds its measure in fate, precisely because fortune and misery do not relate symmetrically to one\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n17\n\nanother at all. In the spirit of Benjamin's reflections, however, one would have to say this: it is not properly fortune, which is the more alien to fate the closer it stands to it, but rather freedom that leads us out of this entire context. The reason for the paradoxical structure of the argument lies in the asymmetry that dislodges the individual terms from any stable relationship with one another. Definition as reflection is already inscribed in this structure. Hence the movement which grasps and presents it as a paradox, cannot itself be merely a defining movement. But how does the asymmetry of misery and fortune, of guilt and innocence, arise? What is the origin of fate? Bare life\n\nThe context of guilt, Benjamin tells us, is a context of law: the order of fate must therefore also be considered as an order of law. This order has survived because it has been confused with the order of justice: 'Law condemns us not to punishment, but to guilt. Fate is the guilt context of the living.'4 And at this point Benjamin refers us to the origin of fate: [The context of guilt] corresponds to the natural condition of the living, that illusion not yet wholly dispelled from which man is so far removed that, under its rule, he was never wholly immersed in it, but only invisible in his best part. It is not therefore really man who has a fate; rather, the subject of fate is indeterminable. The judge can perceive fate wherever he pleases; with every judgement he must blindly dictate fate. It is never man but only the bare life in him that it strikes — the part involved in natural guilt and misfortune by virtue of illusion. Fate has its origin therefore in the illusion or semblance of the natural. 'Myth' in Benjamin denotes the sphere of this semblance, this domain of'bare life'. Thus when Adorno speaks of 'the context of illusion' he is simply providing a dialectical version of this thought from the perspective of the critique of ideology. In a section of Negative Dialectics dedicated to the elucidation of the concept of natural history in the Marxian sense he writes: 'Ideology is not spread over social being like\n\n18\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nsome detachable layer, but dwells within it' (ND:348; ET:354). The illusion is an illusion, but it is never merely external: it belongs to the very essence of the order, that order whose own ineluctability is supposed to be the delusive semblance itself. If man were indeed wholly abandoned to this illusion, this fate, this 'guilt-context of the living', if guilt always remained his guilt and fate were laid upon upon him without remainder, then the latter would actually exercise no power over him at all. It is the essential indefmability of fate that at once releases him from it and entangles him all the more profoundly in the context of guilt. Fate is always a fate devoid of self, it remains always, in Hegel's words, 'a night devoid of consciousness, one which attains neither to any differentiation within itself nor to the clarity of self-knowledge'.3 But this indefmability is not simply an indeterminacy: it is precisely because fate is not laid upon man as his destiny that it accomplishes itself with the greatest defmiteness of all. If we follow Benjamin here then we can define fate as the definite ineluctability that springs from an essential indefmability. We also encounter the idea of fate as 'the guilt-context of the living' in Benjamin's treatise on Goethe's Elective Affinities which was being written around the same time as the essay on 'Fate and Character'. In the essay the things through which life is introduced into the context of guilt are described as 'unchastely impregnated with certainty', as signs of fate which thus betray something about 'a natural life within man'. In the treatise, meanwhile, Benjamin more sharply articulates the thought of guilty significance in claiming that the life of 'apparently dead things' acquires a power at the level of natural life.6 The order of guilt might well be called the order of apparent death: the things are not rescued, are not woken to their authentic life; man is not led from from his natural into his supernatural life. The context of guilt is a definite one because it is a context of significance. The blindness which attaches to 'the concatenation of guilt and expiation' - and this concatenation is precisely what forms a context here — afflicts everything with significance. From a structural perspective fate and allegory assume the same status: for the allegorical vision the thing only acquires the significance which the former has blindly bestowed upon it.7 And the significance in question can\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n19\n\nonly be the single significance of guilt. That blindness afflicts everything with significance is simply to say that everything constantly signifies guilt. If fate is 'the entelechy of events in the realm of guilt', in accordance with the definition provided by the Origin of German Tragic Drama, then the accent falls precisely on that guilt without which there could be no context of significance at all: for, as Benjamin notes, fate must be essentially distinguished from mere causality; the causal elements of all fatality are ineluctably themselves bound up with guilt as the decisive factor which unleashes fatality.8 Guilt signifies, but the significance itself is guilty — it emerges from blindness and clings to natural life. In Negative Dialectics Adorno makes the claim that causality is marked by an aspect of 'archaic legal institutions of vengeance' (ND:264; ET:267). This suggests that one could trace causality back to the context of guilt as the origin of law, back to the vengeance which expiates guilt, even if a genealogical explanation of this kind would not be wholly sufficient. Originary guilt of law Why is it that one cannot escape the statutes of myth or the order of law? How are we to interpret the thought of a judgement that precedes guilt, the thought, that is, of an originary guilt, a guilt more ancient than any guilt? Why is it that one cannot avoid the transgression of the law? Benjamin begins from the thought of just such an unavoidable act in his essay 'The Critique of Violence': Laws and unmarked frontiers remain, at least in primeval times, unwritten laws. A man can unwittingly infringe upon them and thus incur retribution. For each intervention of the law that is provoked by an offence against the unwritten and unknown law is called, in contradistinction to punishment, retribution. But however unluckily it may befall its unsuspecting victim, its occurrence is, in the understanding of the law, not chance, but fate showing itself once again in its deliberate ambiguity. Hermann Cohen, in a brief reflection on the ancients' conception of fate, has spoken of the 'inescapable realisation' that it is 'fate's orders\n\n20\n\nThe Memory of Thought themselves that seem to cause and bring about this infringement, this offence'. To this spirit of law even the modern principle that ignorance of a law is no protection against punishment, testifies, just as the struggle over written law in the early period of the ancient Greek communities is to be understood as a rebellion against the spirit of mythical statutes.9\n\nEven if the law has been preserved in writing, the individual who stands before it remains in ignorance and encounters punishment. Because one comes to stand before the law, because the statute has already defined its own limits, one can do nothing to alleviate this absent knowledge, to extricate oneself from guilt and the context that belongs to it. The ineluctability of fate, which is ultimately what bestows inner coherence upon the legal order itself and turns it into an order closed upon itself, consists in the fact that the space in which one moves has already been disclosed in advance. The law or the statutes condemn us to a guilt before all guilt. That is why the infringement of the order, the offence, the transgression, are not simply caused or effected by the order of the law: on the contrary, this order can only constitute itself because it already presupposes guilt. One always steps forward before the law: 'it is ontologically impossible to step into the realm of what is already disclosed [gia aperto\\, as Massimo Cacciari points out in his interpretation of Kafka.10 The 'mythical power' which Benjamin defines in opposition to 'divine power' must be grasped as a positing of the law, as a delimitation: it is 'at one and the same time the conviction and the expiation of guilt'.11 Guilt is already inscribed in this context as original guilt. Fate therefore signifies the order of an irrecuperable pre-supposition. The fact that particular laws within a legal system can change leaves the immutability of that order inviolate. Man becomes guilty because the future remains closed to him in the order itself. It is only 'a law-destroying power' - and this is precisely the character of the 'divine' power - which can breach the context of guilt and open up the cycle of guilt and expiation. Does not every transgression of the law come into contact with this divine power, and is not this precisely the danger as far as law is concerned?\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n21\n\nOmens, presentiments, signals\n\nThe ineluctability in question reveals itself, according to Benjamin, in the phenomenon of prophecy and soothsaying. But the technique of prophecy depends upon the calculation of 'the most immediately calculable things'.12 Fate, as a context of significance determined by guilt, allows us to read the signs. Whenever man abandons himself to 'the immediately calculable things' in this way, he has already fallen forfeit to the context of guilt. Benjamin counterposes the temporality of fate — or of guilt - to the temporality of rescue - which is also that of truth and of music.13 The former remains an 'improper' form of time which is 'devoid of independence', which enjoys no present and knows only the past and the future in 'quite particular forms'. Thus fate reveals itself as inescapable, its course as ineluctable, precisely because it is grounded in a kind of time deprived of temporality. Benjamin explores this thought in his One-Way Street, in a short passage concerned with prophecy: 'It is more decisive to note precisely what transpires in a second than it is to know in advance the most remote of things. Warnings, presentments, signals course day and night through the human organism like crashing waves. The question is whether they should be interpreted or whether one should make use of them. But to do both is impossible.'14 What is to happen communicates itself in signals which only subsequently reveal themselves as such, as something to be interpreted: namely when we have failed to act in accordance with the prophecy. Such a failure is the foundation for the reading of signs which takes the place of action. The communication of the future transpires accordingly in a double form: either as the seizing of what is to come in the very moment in which it communicates itself without communicating itself ('hardly do we know') or as the interpretation of its signs. It transpires immediately, as something directly communicated to the body, or in a mediated fashion through word or image. The concept of time, from the perspective of which we must grasp the context of guilt of the living, renders the future commensurable with the present insofar as it transforms what is to come into something past, into a sign. The present is not properly experienced as such. On the other hand, the incommensurability of the future, and thereby also that of\n\n22\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nthe present, is itself inscribed within the seizing of what is to come in the moment, in the act which breaks through the context of guilt. The experience of the future is bound to the recognition of the present, to 'the bodily presence of spirit' which is capable of 'transforming the threat of the future into a fulfilled Now': it is the incommensurability of the future which remains incommensurable with all knowledge — that constitutes the present, and not the present which provides the measure of the future. Peter Szondi rightly perceived that Benjamin's thought harbours an understanding of time which is determined with reference to the future; that is is why he would frequently cite the following remark from the section of One-Way Street under discussion here: 'Like ultraviolet rays memory shows to each man in the book of life a script that invisibly and prophetically glosses the text.'15 It is only for memory that the future has become a kind of writing which calls now to be deciphered. Writing is the deciphering of the future which for its part requires this decipherment. For memory the context of guilt has already been formed. The time of memory is the fated time of a catastrophe declared as permanent: 'Hence, when you are taken unawares by an outbreak of fire or the news of a death, there is in the first mute shock a feeling of guilt, the indistinct reproach: did you really not know of this? Did the dead person's name, the last time you uttered it, not sound differently in your mouth? Do you not see in the flames a sign from yesterday evening, in a language you only now understand? And if an object dear to you has been lost, was there not, hours, days before, an aura of mockery or mourning about it that gave the secret away?' Memory produces the context of guilt which it presupposes - it must regard what is to come as something past, must forget it; at the same time, it seeks - in virtue of its own movement - to rescue the past and the forgotten as what is to come. Because the past has been a future it always continues to preserve a trace of the latter's power. 'It is true indeed that the path to the origin is a path that leads back, but back into the future', as Szondi notes.16 It is not because everything that is to come reproduces the context of guilt that the future presents itself as threat - in that case what is to come would already be something past. Rather it is because we regard the future — in a fashion that is, perhaps,\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n23\n\nunavoidable - from the perspective of a memory, of a forgetting, which the future itself discloses: for the possibility of interpretation, the possibility of transforming what is to come into the past, belongs essentially to the future. The future is incommensurable precisely because we cannot identify it - for it is that which first makes straight the path for memory and its forgetting, as well as for all seizing of the future in the instant. But it is only this seizing in the instant that experiences this incommensurability, that alone possesses the experience of what future means. The system of law marked by fate excludes the possibility that a name should ever sound anew and differently. For when one experiences the otherness of such a sound memory is not experience and yet it bears its trace — one has already warded off what threatened to befall the bearer of the name. The lot of fate itself has no sound — if it is true that one can only hear what can also sound otherwise: music as the time of salvation and rescue. That the one who is forfeit to the context of guilt also knows of a future which does not become fate is shown — above all else — by the interest in prophecy. The time of fate is 'referred parasitically to the time of a higher and less naturally entangled life'.17 The named head\n\nProphecy as the transformation of what is to come into the past puts 'the natural life within man' — if we follow here the thought of Fate and Character - in place of the 'named head'.18 It is the name therefore which cannot be accommodated within the unchanging cycle of guilt and expiation. It is not, however, the uttering of the name which breaks the order of the eversame, but rather the speechlessness of the tragic hero who holds up his head because he recognises 'he is better than his gods'. In tragedy — which Benjamin once defines as the 'action of expiation'19 - it is this speechlessness which marks the separation of the individual from fate: 'Fatum [is turned to] freedom'.20 'Moral speechlessness' still belongs in the domain of 'natural innocence', in the 'natural sphere' of character and the freedom peculiar to it. This sphere is then separated from the moral: but how then can speechlessness and character be united? How are we to understand Benjamin's remark that the 'vision of charac-\n\n24\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nter' is connected with freedom 'on the basis of its affinity with logic'? How does the freedom of character relate to that freedom which 'will experience an essential transformation . . . with the attainment of a new concept of knowledge'?21 In the natural pre-moral sphere of freedom — which is alike the freedom of character and character as freedom - there is certainly no mention of the name. The name intends neither the order of fate — the system of right and law — nor the order of character — the order which should be 'liberating in every form'. If Nietzsche, for example, connects the function of the name with the fact that freedom itself once again becomes fate, this idea cannot be reconciled with the way in which Benjamin speaks of the name. At the beginning of the chapter from Ecce homo which bears the title 'Why I Am a Destiny' Nietzsche writes: ' I know my lot. One day the memory of something monstrous will attach itself to my name - of a crisis such as was never before seen on the earth, of a deepest collision of conscience, of a decision invoked against everything which has hitherto been believed, demanded and sanctified. I am no man, I am dynamite.'22 The decision which shall determine the remembrance or the memory of the name here is that of the will to power which posits its own values: 'Transformation of all values: that is my formula for an act of the highest self-reflection on the part of mankind, an act that has become flesh and genius in me.' Freedom and necessity coincide in this decision as an act of highest self-reflection. The name here is not simply that of an individual, it is also more than a mere metonymy which designates a nameless humanity: it is the name of the will to power from which the individual and humanity will first receive their meaning. That is why Nietzsche speaks of an 'incarnation', of'a fate which becomes man . From Benjamin's perspective one could interpret the decision which is at issue for Nietzsche as an attempt to shape and define oneself, as a case of hubris which finds its site in the context of guilt. Gift and oblivion With the 'gift of language', which makes naming into a human task, God completes the act of creation, as Benjamin argues in his essay 'On Language as Such and on the Language of Man'.23\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n25\n\nIt is the 'gift of language' which raises man above nature. And herein lies the 'peculiar revolution involved in the act of creation'. Man experiences his non-natural freedom in the act of naming. This act is not an attempt to shape and define oneself, since its possibility cannot be separated from the 'gift of language'. That the name of a human being is a matter of fate or destiny does not therefore imply that man, interpreted in accordance with the will to power, has formed or shaped himself to become his own fate, but rather that only so can the named individual be assured of his or her 'creation by God'.24 But just as fateful misfortune befell the one who attempted to seize the fortune assigned to him, so too the human being that would want to know of good and evil, that would attempt the 'uncreative imitation of the creative word', is exiled from that 'blessed spirit' of the original language of names which indicates that the task of naming has been fulfilled. The guilt of hubris locates man in the context of guilt: he becomes a victim of the system of law and right. Analogously, the violation of the 'eternal purity of the name' which leads to the fall, provokes the 'stronger purity of the judging word, of the condemnation' to arise.25 It is as if the fall of man were repeated within the sphere of nature, as if his fall posited yet another fall, even if it receives a different name. From this we may conclude that Benjamin always grasps guilt as the forgetting of something emphatically given — as the forgetting of language or of fortune. This forgetting is the origin of right and law within the order of which the gift can no longer be grasped. The gift is that which remains alien in essence to fate, yet without which there could be no fate. Rationality of cunning\n\nWhy do we confuse, as Benjamin says, law and justice with one another (a confusion which is supposed to perpetuate the context of guilt)? If we now follow Adorno's and Horkheimer's attempted reconstruction of the transition from myth to enlightenment, a transition which at once ruptures and sustains the context of guilt, we can answer the question in this way: the confusion rests upon that mythical element which constitutes enlightenment itself.26 Or otherwise expressed: it rests upon\n\n26\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nthe fact that in the shape of right and law enlightenment also constantly restitutes the cycle of myth precisely in order to assert itself as enlightenment. It is the guilt of thought that thought shapes itself as the thought of indebtedness. The transition from myth to enlightenment transpires as cunning. Odysseus, who stands for the cunning protagonist here, sets himself against the mythic context of guilt: The self represents rational universality pitted against the ineluctability of fate. But because Odysseus finds that the universal and the ineluctable are so entwined with one another his rationality necessarily assumes a limiting form, that of the exception. He must withdraw himself from the all-enclosing and threatening structures of right arid law which are inscribed at the heart of every and any mythical figure. He does satisfaction to the legal statutes in such a way that they lose their power over him — precisely insofar as he concedes this power to them. It is impossible to hear the sirens without falling victim to them: they cannot be denied. Defiance and delusion are one and the same, and he who defies them is thereby instantly lost to the myth which he opposes. But cunning is defiance become rational. (DdA:77; ET:58) If the 'demanding mythical powers into whose realm Odysseus finds himself cast' represent 'petrified contracts and legal demands hailing from the pre-historical age', then 'rational universality' is inherent in myth itself: in its own universality, which is the universality of the statutes of law and right, myth has already programmed the self-extrication of the subject in the form of cunning. Precisely there, where the cunning protagonist hopes to release himself from myth by fulfilling the demands of its contract - and the self arises only in and through this movement - there he acts under the sway of mythical compulsion. 'Rational universality' is, according to its origin and in no way contingently, bound to the limitation of the exception: not only because it would assert itself against myth, and thus must except itself from it, but also - and above all because the possibility of this assertion — the possibility of cunning — is harboured in myth itself. The ineluctability is\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n27\n\nprecisely that of universality as the universality of law. It is represented by its bearer, by the self. To the degree in which the self is not identical with that universality and that its own identity is not based upon it, insofar therefore as it is an exception which cannot be defined in terms of the ineluctable, the self always experiences the law as a dead letter in which it cannot recognise itself. Or is it not rather the case that precisely the abstract dimension of law, which hinders all recognition, itself creates the domain where cunning moves and the duplicitous character of exception reveals itself? In the paragraph of Negative Dialectics entitled The Juridical Sphere' Adorno writes: 'Whereas a society without law, as in the Third Reich, became the prey of total arbitrariness, law in society preserves the moment of terror, and is always ready to use it with appeal to the existing statutes.' And he continues: Law is the primal phenomenon of irrational rationality. Here the formal principle of equivalence becomes the norm, the principle measures everyone by the same yardstick. Such equality, in which differences vanish, secretly colludes with inequality; it is the surviving myth of a spuriously demythologised humanity. For the sake of a seamless and total coherence the legal norms excise what cannot be accommodated, every experience of the specific that has not yet been homogenised in advance, and thus elevate instrumental rationality into a second reality sui generis. (ND:303ff.; ET:309)27 Myth triggers its own survival in enlightenment itself, which, as an exception that is no such thing, tolerates no exceptions: 'The rational system of law is regularly capable of destroying the appeal to fairness, which was once to represent a legal corrective against injustice, as a case of protectionism or unfair privilege' (ND:305; ET:311). The protection the law offers - as already in myth: for it is the universality of the statute, its repeatability in principle, which allows the cunning individual to oppose it — itself produces inequality which is essential to the realm of the ever-same. Law would only be able to dispense with its mythical features — which attach to it 'merely in form' and before all 'class-content and class-justice' - if it exposed itself to that which no longer falls under its own statutes: to that which is\n\n28\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nnot equal and cannot be properly circumscribed within the existing system of law. But then it would also be exposed to the danger of becoming 'the prey of pure arbitrariness'. Equality as inequality\n\nThe inequality that belongs to the essence of law, which is the reason why the latter continues to remain the law of the stronger, hinders the fulfilment of what the laws require: 'The right of mythical figures, as that of the stronger, merely lives off the unfulfillable character of their statutes. If these were ever to be satisfied, then it would spell the end of myth down to the very last generation' (DdA:78; ET:59). The persistence of statutes and laws before which all individuals are equal depends upon the fact that all individuals reveal themselves as equal before them, that is, that all individuals become victims of that inequality upon which the laws rest. The law cannot be satisfied; one always owes something. Cunning destroys, it is true, the mythical institution of law since it gives the lie to its unfulfillability. But cunning itself is the instrument of an indebted thinking, a thinking in terms of statutes and laws. The successful exercise of cunning stands for that process through which the law is not abolished but rather its indwelling inequality is extended. The cunning individual who stands before the law is stronger because his equality constitutes an accommodation which harbours inequality within itself. That is why whoever comes before the law can display cunning: with accommodation — and there is no accommodation without inequality — the possibility of manipulation is also given. In cunning, law exposes itself to its own self-constitutive inequality and thereby asserts itself with even greater force. Wherever cunning determines the relationship to others, these others have always already forfeited their otherness and thereby become disposable. The principle of law remains untouched by cunning, even if the cunning individual fulfils the mythic statutes and thus destroys them. If we define the universal as the inequality of what renders everything equal, then we can claim that cunning always remains the instrument of a universal that it never endangers. Even Hegel, whose concept of the universal is not that of an all-equalising process but rather that of a self-mediat-\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n29\n\ning and progressive movement of sublation, would seem to confirm this at the very moment in which he speaks of the 'cunning of reason': 'It is not the universal Idea which opposes itself to opposition and conflict, exposes itself to danger; it holds itself rather, untouched and undamaged, in the background. This can be called the cunning of reason: that it allows the passions to work for it, and that alone that through which it posits itself in existence is given over to loss and injury.'28 The universal is the cunning which cannot itself be cunningly outwitted, whereas the individual, the cunning agent, can always be cunningly outwitted by others. Neither the cunning individual nor the individual outwitted by cunning is ultimately capable of the experience of otherness: they are capable only of the experience of universality. Sacrifice and the principle of equivalence\n\nCunning presupposes the act of sacrifice. Adorno and Horkheimer interpret this act as the origin of exchange, of the principle of equivalence that is also the principle of law. In the first place they point to the function of the gift offered to the host: The Homeric gift is halfway between barter and offering. Like a sacrifice, it is intended to pay for forfeited blood (either the stranger's or that of the pirates' captive), and to seal a covenant of peace. But at the same time, the exchange of gifts stands for the principle of equivalence: actually or symbolically the host receives the equivalent value of his effort; the traveller obtains provision for the journey - the basic means of returning home. Even if the host receives no direct recompense for his service, he can count upon the same service for himself or his kin. As an offering to the elemental deities, the gift is also a rudimentary insurance against them. (DdA:67; ET:49) The gift offered to the host represents the transition from the act of sacrifice to that of exchange. But this transition is possible only because the sacrificial offering was always already a form of exchange, 'a human means of prevailing over the gods, who are toppled precisely by the system in which they are honoured'. It is\n\n30\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\ntrue, as Hegel emphasises in his early writings on religion, that only something heterogenous can be sacrificed in this regard. Yet exchange does not so much pervert the meaning of the sacrifice as unfold it. The principle of equivalence emerges from the sacrificial act as the primal form of exchange. If the self-relinquishment enacted in sacrifice always already serves self-preservation, one can understand why, 'under the persisting spell of magic, rationality as a mode of sacrificial behaviour becomes an exercise of cunning', why indeed nothing else is possible. Cunning, as defined by Horkheimer and Adorno, is an act of sacrifice. The fact that the cunning individual cannot extricate himself from the principle of equivalence involved in mythical law, from the binding rights and statutes of myth, means that he must substitute and therefore perpetuate the sacrificial offering with another: the hero 'evades the sacrificial offering by sacrificing himself. The history of civilisation is the history of the introversion of sacrifice. In other words: the history of renunciation. Everyone who practises renunciation gives away more of his life than he receives in return, more of the life which he represents' (DdA:73; ET:55). The inequality which is reproduced in the sacrificial act of renunciation belongs to the principle of equivalence. In the performance of the sacrificial act 'the priestly rationalisation of murder through the apotheosis of the chosen victim' has concealed the principle of equivalence and the inequality that attaches to it. But just as cunning must be different from that which the cunning individual opposes, thus marking an exception, so too the sacrifice must be more than an extension of itself: All the innumerable and superfluous sacrifices are necessary — precisely against sacrifice itself. Odysseus, too, is the self who always restrains himself and forgets his life, who saves his life only to recall it as nothing but a wandering. But he also sacrifices his life for sacrifice to be abolished. His dominatory renunciation, as a struggle with myth, represents a society which no longer needs renunciation and domination, which acquires mastery over itself not in order to do violence to itself and others, but for the sake of reconciliation. (DdA:73f; ET:55-6)29 How can we conceive of a reconciliation if its very concept involves sacrificial representation, a representation from which\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n31\n\nthe 'deification of the sacrificial victim', which has a representative function, cannot be separated? On the one hand, a reconciliation which implicitly justifies the sacrifice is still bound to it: such a reconciliation continues to involve the possibility of a further additional sacrifice, even if the state of reconciliation would no longer conceivably require sacrifice at all. On the other hand, a reconciliation which shuns the danger of justifying the sacrifice — the danger, that is, of submitting to fate as the context of guilt - remains nothing but an empty assurance that could not be distinguished from an extorted reconciliation. Reconciliation postponed\n\nIt is the double function of renunciation which reveals just how far the idea of reconciliation remains bound up with that of sacrifice. The 'rational law' of right, which sets itself against the statutes of myth, no longer produces the condition of equivalence immediately through the act of vengeance, but through the postponement and renunciation of the latter: the 'subjugation of everything that is natural' with which renunciation begins itself 'enthrones vengeance in mediated form, as vengeance exercised by the self upon itself (DdA:74; ET:55). With its transference into the subject, with its emancipation from a mythically given content, this subjection becomes 'objective', objectively self-sufficient in comparison with all particular human aims, it becomes the universal rational law. Already in Odysseus' patience, and unmistakable after the slaughter of the suitors, revenge becomes legal procedure: the ultimate fulfilment of the mythic compulsion becomes the objective instrument of domination. Justice is restrained revenge. But since this legal 'patience' is formed on the basis of something outside itself, the longing for the homeland, it acquires human characteristics — even traces of confidence — that point beyond the specific revenge that has been refrained from. In fully developed bourgeois society, both are rescinded: together with the thought of revenge, the longing also becomes taboo. (DdA:97; ET:55) This postponement points beyond vengeance because it can be accomplished only by the emergence or addition of something\n\n32\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nwhich stands outside the entire context of guilt: by the the emergence of a longing for home. If home is 'the fact of having escaped' (DdA:97; ET:78), then the longing for it must signify reconciliation: in a state of reconciliation man is precisely supposed to escape from the realm of myth - from sacrifice, from renunciation, from guilt. But since, through this movement of pointing beyond, this transcending of mythical immanence, the postponement causes what is postponed to disappear from sight, without sublating it, then that which sustains the postponement, the transcendence which was opposed to mythical immanence, ultimately disappears too. It disappears by virtue of the same movement which makes it possible and in which it reveals itself. The reconciliation without which no postponement could be conceived, is itself postponed: it creates a space for myth precisely where it interrupts the latter. Thus reconciliation reveals itself as mythical. At the same time, however, myth is never capable of producing a totally selfenclosed context of guilt. The possibility of postponement lies in myth: and this is exactly what the structure of sacrifice clearly exposes. That reconciliation cannot simply be opposed to myth, that the context of guilt cannot be absolute, is ultimately grounded in the fact that myth appears impotent in relation to its extension, in relation to the domination of nature, to cunning. This impotence harbours an experience of that other which Adorno and Horkheimer describe as nature, even though our experience of the latter always already forms part of an order shaped by the principle of equivalence. 'If belief in sacrificial representation implies a recollection of something that was not a primal component of the individual, but originated instead in the history of domination, it also becomes untruth in regard to the individual as it has developed. The individual — the self - is the human being no longer credited with the magical power of representation. The establishment of the self cuts through that fluctuating relation with nature that the sacrifice of the self claims to establish' (DdA:69; ET:51). Space and time\n\nThe self owes its existence to the sacrifice made against sacrifice, to the experience of renunciation. Consequently it owes its exis-\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n33\n\ntence to the 'sacrifice of the present moment to the future' and therefore involves a specific relationship to space and time: The opposition of enlightenment to myth is expressed in the opposition of the surviving individual ego to the multifarious vicissitudes of fate. The straying and wandering which lead from Troy to Ithaca describe the path which the self takes through the myths - always physically weak over against the powers of nature, and acquiring a consciousness of itself only in this journey. The prehistorical world is secularised as the space the self traverses; and the ancient demons inhabit the distant reaches and islands of the civilised Mediterranean, forced back into those forms of rock and cavern from which they once emerged in the dread remoteness of antiquity. But the epic adventures give each location a proper name and permit a rational overview of space itself. (DdA:64; ET:46) And further: 'In the image of the journey historical time laboriously and conditionally separates itself off from space, the unconditional schema of all mythical time' (DdA:66; ET:48). When Adorno and Horkheimer call fate 'manifold', when they designate myth as 'the manifold, the distracting, the dissolving element', they are referring to the destructive power of myth, to that moment of otherness that is not exhausted in mythical ever-sameness, and whose subjugation renews the context of guilt. He who exposes himself to myth courts the mortal danger of the manifold that consumes identity. But since myth is the manifold precisely as the ever-same (a double definition of myth which enables Horkheimer and Adorno to pursue a double strategy of argument), it is also what makes the domination of nature possible through the self-identical subject. And here Adorno and Horkheimer cite a line of Holderlin (which Heidegger also quotes in connection with the question concerning technology): 'Where danger grows, /There also grows the saving power'. Myth brings itself into opposition with an enlightenment that must also itself be more than myth. The task is to think the relationship of the self to space and time in accordance with this schema. For it is by no means the case that one could simply define myth in terms of space and enlightenment in terms of time. The space (of the Odyssey) is 'mythical\n\n34\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\ntime': a 'secularisation of the prehistorical world' and a site of errance through which the power of myth asserts itself Between 'mythical time' and 'historical time' stands the name. At the moment in which space is named, and thereby becomes identifiable and recognisable, the identifying self is no longer subjected to it: the erring journey becomes history. This transformation is what is known as adventure. Horkheimer and Adorno observe that the unified self cannot be conceived simply in 'rigid opposition to adventure', but rather forms itself 'in its rigidity' only 'through this opposition. The self is a unity merely in the manifold which that unity denies' (DdA:65; ET:47). Within purely 'historical time' there can be no adventure. It is only the entwinement of the latter with 'mythical time', with space, which makes the idea of adventure possible. Adventure is chanced, its risk overcome, where history can suddenly reveal itself as errance and errance as history. It is through adventure, in which cunning knows how to preserve itself, that wandering becomes journeying. In this process the self learns how to name space. If the constitution of the self is accomplished as 'the sacrifice of the present moment to the future', this also involves the possibility of naming. For every name sacrifices the present moment: otherwise it would never be able to fulfil its task. If the name were to hold only in the moment of naming, it would destroy itself before it could name anything at all. In other words: the name is mythic to the extent that, after death and disappearance, it vouchsafes the recognition of what has died and disappeared, to the extent therefore that it has always assumed the guilt of the ever-same. Every name is guilty. And: one is convicted of guilt in every name. A rational overview Naming inevitably transpires in the spirit which Nietzsche describes as 'the spirit of vengeance' and Heidegger analyses as follows: Vengeance is the will's unwilling response to time, and that means: against the phenomenon of transience and the pastness which belongs to it. For the will this is something which it can no longer do anything to counter, something against\n\nFate and SacrificeE\n\n35\n\nwhich its willing constantly stumbles. Time and its 'It was' is the stumbling block which the will is powerless to remove. Time as transience is a rebuff the will is forced to suffer. This suffering will becomes itself a suffering of transience, a suffering which wills its own transience, and thereby wills that everything that is deserves to pass away. The unwilling response to time debases the transient.30 There is no name which would not require this debasement of time: the name, without which no 'rational perspective' would be successfully accomplished, sets the ever-sameness of what is exempted from time against the ever-sameness of the transience which belongs to fate. Name and law alike presuppose the 'sacrifice of the present moment to the future': since it permits all the achievements of identifying thought, the name is the unity which guarantees the functioning of the principle of equivalence. But that in turn means that myth as fate, as the context of guilt which rests upon this same principle, structurally presupposes the name. The sacrifice offered up against sacrifice, the renunciation that postpones vengeance, reveals itself as vengeance. Nietzsche's 'spirit of vengeance'\n\nIf we attempt therefore to grasp that state of reconciliation, which according to Horkheimer and Adorno no longer requires renunciation, as the liberation from the 'spirit of vengeance', we should not begin from the model of the contract based as it is upon the principle of equivalence. In Zarathustra Nietzsche gives a voice to a madness in whose ravings the captive will that cannot break the hold of time redeems itself: 'Can there be any redemption if there is an eternal law? Ah!, the stone \"It was\" cannot be moved: all punishments must remain eternal punishments! . . . No deed can ever be destroyed: how could a deed be made undone through punishment! This, this is the eternal burden of the punishment that is \"existence\" that the latter must always and eternally return as deed and guilt!' The 'creative will' turns against that will whose willing becomes a failure to will - and here Nietzsche alludes to Schopenhauer. But the creative will must\n\n36\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nalso will something 'higher than all reconciliation', it may not rest content with a 'reconciliation with time'. As 'will to power' it must itself will to 'will back'. Consequently it is the unity of will to power and the eternal return of the same, of the 'what' and the 'that', that must be regarded as that which is higher than reconciliation.31 Heidegger, who in a 'dialogue on thinking' entitled Releasement speaks of a 'non-willing' that 'remains utterly beyond any kind of willing', and that has nothing to do with 'the denial of the will to life',32 refers to the 'redemption from the spirit of vengeance' in Nietzsche by emphasising the irreconcilability of such redemption with all contractual thought: Nietzsche's thought is directed towards a spirit which, being the freedom from vengeance, precedes all mere fraternisation, but also any desire to mete out punishment. It precedes all efforts for peace and every prosecution of war. It precedes the spirit which would ground and secure peace, pax, through pacts. The domain of this freedom from vengeance also lies before all feeble withdrawal from events and the shirking of sacrifice, just as it lies before all blind action pursued at any price.33 The fact that Horkheimer and Adorno do not conceive of reconciliation as the unity of will to power and eternal return should not obscure their agreement with the Nietzschean thought here mediated through Heidegger's interpretation. One cannot escape 'the spirit of vengeance' there where myth, where 'eternal law', guilt and punishment prevail and where the overcoming of the same remains subject to their sway - as a mere denial of will or as a 'lawful' guarantee. Sacrifice as appropriation\n\nHeidegger mentions sacrifice. But why does he do so? The passage quoted derives from What Is Called Thinking?, the series of lectures which Heidegger delivered in the winter semester of 1959. Ten years earlier Heidegger also mentions sacrifice in his lecture on Holderlin's hymn 'Der Ister'. The significance of the date in question hardly needs to be underlined.\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n37\n\nWe only stand at the beginning of historicality proper, that is, of action which lies within the essential and which stems from an ability to wait for the sending of what is one's own. Yet being able to wait is not an actionless or thoughtless readiness to let events take their course, it is not a closing of one's eyes in the face of some dark foreboding. Being able to wait is a standing that has already leapt ahead, a standing within what is indestructible, in whose neighbourhood devastation belongs as the valley belongs to the mountain. Yet could such a waiting ever occur without a kind of historical humanity which belongs to the beginning, and which, growing through the pain of sacrifice, proves to be prepared for this beginning, for that which is its own?'34 The 'thoughtless readiness to let events take their course' corresponds to the 'feeble withdrawal from events' in the passage from Heidegger's later lecture, while the 'closing of one's eyes in the face of some dark foreboding' corresponds to the 'shirking of sacrifice'. In both cases the sacrifice in question is one that allows an appropriation of what belongs most properly to oneself, and indeed there where the latter is threatened by war and devastation. It is true that Heidegger interprets this 'own' as the 'beginning' that is destined to a certain kind of 'historical humanity', but also as an act which discloses the realm of the more than human, since the first part of the lecture series What Is Called Thinking? is itself a discussion of Nietzsche. However, the distinctive description of 'the freedom from vengeance', in which the reference to sacrifice occurs, allows one to wonder whether in fact Heidegger is merely presenting Nietzsche's train of thought here. Especially since, according to Heidegger, the epoch of completed nihilism, essentially characterised as it is by the overman as 'the will of the eternal return of the same',35 permits, and indeed demands, a double interpretation. If we refer here to the language of Heidegger's lecture on Holderlin, we could express this double interpretation as follows: indestructibility is only what it is because at every moment it is also threatened by devastation. The objection that even in the lecture on Holderlin's hymn the reference to sacrifice is contextually determined, that it forms part of the discussion concerning the poet's idea of the relationship between the German and\n\n38\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nthe Greek heritage, loses its force when we see how Heidegger transfers the question concerning what is properly one's own to the historical present: 'We know today', Heidegger writes in the section of the lecture under discussion here, that the Anglo-Saxon world of Americanism is determined to destroy Europe, that means the homeland, and that means the beginning of the West. The beginning is indestructible. The entry of America into this planetary war is not an entry into history, but is already the last American act of ahistoricality and self-devastation. For this act is the repudiation of the beginning and a decision in favour of that which knows no beginning. The hidden spirit of the beginning in the West will not even spare an expression of scorn for this process of self-devastation practised by that which knows no beginning.36 It is because this 'Americanism' is bereft of beginning and history, because it practises devastation as self-devastation and cannot even be recognised by 'the spirit of the beginning', by history — the spirit scorns even to scorn it — that it also knows nothing of sacrifice. Only the spirit which has access to what is properly its own, to the beginning, can make a sacrifice. Of course self-devastation cannot be entirely separated from the devastation which threatens those who hold fast to the indestructible and the experience of what is properly their own. For the 'Americanism' which is incapable of entering history and consequently does not participate in historical devastation derives for its part from a historical forgetting, or indeed from forgetting as history. We can therefore see that for Heidegger sacrifice stands in the service of an appropriation of one's own.37 And just as, according to such a view, one's own cannot exist without sacrifice, so too the reconciliation, which Horkheimer and Adorno describe as a condition no longer requiring sacrifice, is inconceivable without sacrifice, without that sacrifice against sacrifice which can be understood as being effected by the name. It must of course be conceded that Heidegger does not speak of a sacrifice against sacrifice, that one's own is not simply to be identified with reconciliation, but perhaps one cannot avoid speaking in\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n39\n\nthe name of sacrifice at the moment in which one turns selfsacrificially against sacrifice. The question as to whether sacrifice liberates from 'the spirit of vengeance' or does not rather perpetuate it remains open. Is it necessary to oppose two different forms of sacrifice here? To put the question in another way: is there a sacrifice which would remove the guilt without renewing it? The commanding name\n\nIt is striking that in repudiating all contractual thought Heidegger should interpret peace in Latin terms as pax. So interpreted, peace represents a fundamental feature of 'the imperial', defined by Heidegger as an essential domain in which subjugation as 'bringing-down', the falsum which derives from the Greek pseudos, holds sway: 'Bringing-down' here is the act of 'going-behind', the 'trick', a word which has not coincidentally been taken from 'English'. To trick and betray someone, externally regarded, is a complicated and therefore indirect way of bringing them down in contrast to a direct and immediate form of subjugation. In this way the one brought down is not destroyed, but also in a certain sense raised up again within the limits defined by the prevailing power. This defining is expressed in Latin as pango, hence the word pax — peace. In terms of the imperial this is now the established condition of the one brought down . . . It is not in war but in thcfallere of deceitful conduct and the exploitation for the purposes of the ruling power that the authentic and 'impressive' aspect of the imperial reveals itself.38 Warning against the identification of freedom from the spirit of vengeance with peace as pax, Heidegger brings Nietzsche's remarks on 'eternal law' from Zarathustra into direct relationship with the Roman interpretation of law (an imperial interpretation which is ultimately rooted in 'peace' and not, like the originally Greek interpretation, in 'war') in struggle and contestation: 'The common way of looking at the matter thinks as follows: right or law is intrinsically inscribed somewhere or\n\n40\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nother, and with its help and in its application conflict is precisely decided and eliminated. No! Originally speaking, and in accordance with its essence, law first presents itself, shapes and preserves itself, reveals its truth only in struggle and conflict. It is the struggle that defines the struggling sides; the one side is what it is through the other, in mutual self-recognition'.39 From this perspective, the transition from myth to enlightenment, accomplished in terms of the name as Adorno and Horkheimer clearly show, presents itself as the transition to the imperial in a generalised sense: for it is precisely the name which is supposed to guarantee the 'rational overview' which subjects nature. Heidegger, as we shall see, does not restrict the imperial to the Roman Empire: but the latter does reveal the essence of dominion and of command. Law, as a form of equivalent exchange, rests upon the name as the selfsame unity of identification exempted from time, and is essentially imperial in character to the extent that the name remains bound to territorial dominion, as Adorno and Horkheimer both assume. The fact that the name procures a 'rational overview' there where it specifies the limits and frontiers of space can also be formulated in the following fashion: the name occupies, identifies and governs a domain, places everything that falls within the latter at its own disposal and excludes everything it cannot grasp and integrate: what is thus excluded remains at the frontier, at the 'distant margin'. (In Adorno's and Horkheimer's eyes too, the myth that has been brought down is not simply destroyed; its statutes forfeit their power, but the song of the sirens survives within 'artistic music'.) Imperium is the domain grounded upon the commandment in which others are commanded. Imperium is an order in the sense of commandment. Understood in this fashion, the order is the essential ground of dominion and not something like its effect, and certainly not merely a form of its exercise. The God of the Old Testament is also a 'commanding God': Thou shalt not', Thou shalt' is his word. This 'Shalt' is inscribed upon the tables of the law. No Greek god is a commanding god, but rather one that shows something forth, that points the way. The Roman 'numen, which is what typically marks the gods of Rome, on the other hand sig-\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n41\n\nnifies 'summons' and 'will' and reveals a commanding character . . . It is in the essential domain of the 'command' that Roman 'law', ins, belongs. The latter word is connected with jubeo: to call upon someone by command to do something, to determine what is done or left undone.40 (Two genealogies touch upon one another, intersect, and yet do not coincide here: on the one hand the Judaeo-Roman-English one and on the other the Graeco-German one if we wished to insert the name as the guarantee of a 'rational overview' in this context, we should have to relegate it to the former.) The name, the unit of identification, is the 'essential ground of dominion'. The debasement of time, the dependence upon the 'spirit of vengeance', and also the commanding character all reveal themselves as features of the name. In truth the 'spirit of vengeance' is one with the essence of the imperial: the latter accomplishes in respect to space what the former accomplishes in respect to time. In the series of lectures What Is Called Thinking? Heidegger writes: 'In any case, all naming and being named is the familiar idea of \"calling\" only because naming itself consists according to its essence in calling in the proper sense, in the call to come, in a calling and commanding.'41 It is true that Heidegger speaks of 'calling in the proper sense' and carefully distinguishes 'commanding' from 'giving orders and organising'. It is therefore unlikely that he is intending to refer here to the imperial. And yet the use of the word 'commanding' perhaps betrays that the imperial function of naming is already harboured within calling itself and not merely an external contamination. It is only because calling is a commanding (' \"calling\" signifies in short: \"commanding\" ') that the name can exercise an imperial effect, even if the 'deep-rooted meaning' of commanding cannot be reduced to the imperial. But in that case one could, with all due caution, generalise what Heidegger says about commanding in his remarks on Nietzsche. These remarks confirm that the name stands in the service of the domination of nature and self-preservation insofar as it fulfils the function of calling and of commanding: 'As a representing of what is, of what is constant, as a confirming and a securing, recognition is a necessary part of the essential constitution of life. Thus life possesses within itself in its vital character - the\n\n42\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nessential characteristic of commanding. The securing of human life transpires, accordingly, in terms of a decision which concerns what is to count as existing, and what is to be called being.'42 If calling is a commanding, if the name can assume a commanding character, then every naming opens up the realm of representation, of a 'rational overview', quite irrespective of whether it can be reduced to the latter. Purifying rage\n\nThat Horkheimer and Adorno connect the transition from myth to enlightenment, the transition from space to time, with the name signifies that it is not the concept which first subsumes the manifold but already the name which makes over otherness into the same. The ever-sameness of the principle of equivalence that is supposed to inhere in the (enlightened) legal order results exclusively from the act of identification: from the ever-sameness of the commanding name in which the spirit of vengeance prevails. The equality of equivalence is a result. Around 1919 Benjamin wrote a short piece concerned with time and the moral world. His reflections are very instructive in connection with the problem of space, time and law. Benjamin distinguishes the realm of law from that of the moral world by recourse to the concept of retribution. Even if we should not underestimate the fact that in modern law retribution possesses a specific temporal measure of its own — 'almost as if it hesitated to reach out beyond the domain of a single human life' — this circumstance does nothing to change the structural indifference of retribution to the dimension of time. Benjamin limits himself to justifying this claim by reference to the observation that retribution 'can remain in undiminished force through centuries': it is said to be 'known from ancient forms of law that this power of retribution is capable of extending its reach down even to the furthest generation'.43 But the contrast drawn between 'more ancient forms of law' and the realm of 'modern law' is not sufficient to demonstrate that indifference to time must be sought for in the structure of retribution as such. This indifference could reveal such a determining character only if it could be derived from the principle of equivalence itself. The like-for-like can be bound to time: in the first place through\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n43\n\nfulfilment of the statutes. But such a fulfilment already presupposes indifference with regard to time: the principle of equivalence, which alone bestows sense on retribution, can only affirm itself as such if equality can in principle - that is: irrespective of all transformation - be re-established, if, that is, an innocent must atone for guilt. In the realm of guilt retribution always and inevitably falls on the innocent, whether in a given case this is actually so or not. The temporal measure (the idea of the lapsing of law) should not be allowed to obscure the fact that one must relate indifferently to time if there is to be talk of guilt and retribution at all. The 'power of retribution' reaches down 'even to the furthest generation' because it has always already selected an innocent for its victim. But the self which according to Horkheimer and Adorno constitutes itself through 'sacrifice of the present moment to the future' is not innocent of guilt. The indifference to time, without which the self could never be formed - without which myth could never pass over into enlightenment, or space into time — makes this sacrificing, naming self, into a victim. Benjamin provides an example that is supposed to demonstrate retribution's indifference to time: the 'pagan conception' of the Last Judgement. The latter is meant to represent a 'settlement' since it is essentially determined by the thought of retribution — and not that of forgiveness. According to this conception the Last Judgement is 'the point at which an end to all postponement, a stop to all retribution, is presented'. The interpretation of the Last Judgement in terms of retribution could be understood with Horkheimer and Adorno in the following way: the vengeance whose postponement grounds the law finally catches up with the law. The ultimate authority of the law is drawn from this possibility, constantly present within it as the 'spurious infinity' of its 'empty tarrying' and postponing permanence. Benjamin appeals to forgiveness as against retribution: And yet this thought, which scorns postponement as an empty tarrying, cannot grasp the immeasurable significance of the Day of Judgement, constantly deferred and ceaselessly fleeing into the future as it is. This significance is closed to the world of law, where retribution holds sway, but reveals itself only there where, in the moral world, it encounters for-\n\n44\n\nThe Memory of Thought giveness. But this latter, in order to contend with retribution, finds its mightiest configuration in time itself. For time, in which Ate pursues the transgressor, is not the lonely lull and calm of terror, but rather the roaring storm of forgiveness before the ever-approaching judgement, and against which it is powerless. This storm is not merely the voice in which the terrified cry of the transgressor is drowned, it is also the hand which wipes away the traces of his offence, even though it devastate the earth in order to do so. Like the purifying hurricane which precedes the tempest, so too the wrath of God roars through history in the storm of forgiveness in order to sweep away what would otherwise be consumed in the lightning flash of the divine tempest.44\n\nThe indifference to time announces itself as much in the temporality of 'empty tarrying' as it does in the retribution that has come to pass. The postponement of the retribution does not signify the disappearance of indifference. If retribution is constantly postponed because the principle of like-for-like already harbours inequality — can there be a different kind of retribution, is the idea of the Last Judgement as the final act of retribution not itself an effect of its inevitable postponement? — then this permanence is precisely the evidence of indifference to time. But it is precisely because time also inscribes itself in the principle of like-for-like, it is precisely because the permanent postponement is nothing but such an inscription, that time can acquire power over the principle of equivalence. That the world of law assumes the form of indifference to time, that its temporality is indifferent in character, can do nothing to prevent the conflict between retribution and forgiveness. Permanence as the distance which separates guilt and expiation, which stretches between the terrible deed and its retribution, can transform itself, any time, into the time of forgiveness. Time itself is indeed nothing but forgiveness, and it only needs to be experienced as such in order to escape from the context of guilt. The context of guilt consumes itself, as it were, simply because it is a context. The conflict of retribution and forgiveness transpires within the same temporality to which the world of law is bound. It is time which struggles with itself, with 'empty tarrying', with guilt. For where there is guilt, there is\n\nFate and Sacrifice\n\n45\n\nalso the demand both for retribution and for forgiveness. A guilt that calls for no retribution is no guilt; a guilt that does not ask forgiveness cannot be recognised. Benjamin suggests just how closely retribution and forgiveness are bound up with one another when he claims that the 'storm of forgiveness' can devastate the earth in order to contest the permanence of retribution. Forgiveness therefore also harbours a peculiar abstention from time (as permanence), an indifference that constitutes the essence of time itself. Forgiveness is the time that wipes away the traces of guilt which have been left behind at a particular moment of time: it does not first arise from the effects of time. But what then is the sense of the Last Judgement if the 'storm of forgiveness' - time as purifying rage, as cathartic blinding, as the wrath of God — sweeps away everything that should stand before it? Forgiveness and retribution are incommensurable, and no negotiation can put an end to their conflict. The more they resemble one another, the more incomparable they are. Time, Benjamin remarks at the end of his text, does not merely eliminate 'the traces of the terrible deed'. Beyond 'all remembering and all forgetting' it is time 'in its very permanence, and in a truly mysterious fashion, that promotes forgiveness'. It is of course true, as the author adds, that it does not promote reconciliation. The permanence in whose emptiness the world of law stands is disproportionately long: that retribution and forgiveness are caught in conflict means that retribution always comes too late, that it always comes as belated retribution. Permanence as such threatens to annul the retribution that in turn requires that permanence, whether it brings about the oblivion of guilt or not. Retribution is the time which, on account of guilt, has tarried and missed its own opportunity. Dialectic of sacrifice, promise of happiness\n\nThe mythical time of the ever-same, as understood by Horkheimer and Adorno, is not merely the time of the ever-renewed context of guilt but also that of the promise of happiness. In this connection historical time appears as the time of labour: adventure therefore represents the transition to labour and naming represents its possibility. Happiness is simultaneously acquired through labour and through its opposite. In the Odyssey those\n\n46\n\nThe Memory of Thought\n\nwho have sought happiness at the cost of total forgetfulness and loss of will are called the Lotus-eaters. They represent an 'original state devoid of labour': This kind of idyll, which recalls the happiness of narcotic drug addicts reduced to the lowest level in a hardened social order, who use their drugs to enable them endure the unendurable, is impermissible for the adherents of rational selfpreservation. It is actually the mere illusion of happiness, a dull vegetating state, as meagre as an animal's bare existence, and at best merely the absence of the awareness of unhappiness. But happiness harbours truth, and is essentially a result, revealing itself along with the overcoming"
