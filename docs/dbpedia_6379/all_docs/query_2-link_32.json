If you would like to submit an abstract to one of these sessions send your abstract directly to the session convenors by 21 December 2018. Decisions about acceptance will be made in collaboration with the session convenors and the MPSG 2019 programme committee.\n\nA Musical Matter of Mind\n\nConvenors\n\nDr Simon HÃ¸ffding (University of Oslo)\n\nDr Nanette Nielsen (University of Oslo)\n\nFor recent â4Eâ approaches within cognitive science the mind is embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended, and cognition is shaped by dynamic interactions between the brain, the body, and physical and social environments. Part of this shaping occurs by a process of âmental offloadingâ: once we âscaffoldâ know-how into our physical surroundings we engage in such offloading. Examples include tilting our heads to perceive a rotated image, or storing knowledge into our memory-supporting smartphone such that we receive a reminder of an upcoming event. In accounting for the materiality of musical encounters, Joel Krueger (2017) argues that music can serve as a tool for offloading in a similar way as other tools and technologies. Via this offloading, âmusic can (at least potentially) scaffold access to new forms of thought, experience, and behaviourâ (Krueger 2017, 2).\n\nConsidering musical engagement and experience as fundamentally embodied allows us to ask the question of what possible mental transformation can occur through listening and/or performing. For instance, Kruegerâs work shows how people listen to music to regulate their emotions and open new spheres of emotion (2014). Further, music performance at expert levels seems to enable new forms of reflection, in which reflective and pre-reflective modes of self-awareness combine in unusual ways (McGuiness 2014) or in which one develops a simultaneous multiplicity of first-personal perspectives (Hurlburt 2011). Tout court, expert musical performance seems to scaffold new forms of consciousness (HÃ¸ffding 2019). For this session we seek to foster further music-philosophical dialogue about these recent approaches and invite papers from musicologists and/or philosophers that interrogate and discuss how musical offloading â as listening and/or performing â might enable new forms of thought, experience, and behaviour.\n\nAbstracts of up to 350 words (or 500 for collaborative papers) should be sent to Simon HÃ¸ffding: simon.hoffding@imv.uio.no by 21 December 2018 with the subject âA Musical Matter of Mind.â\n\nWorks cited:\n\nHurlburt, Russell T (2011).

Recently, through a renewed focus on curatorial practices, New Music has come under scrutiny from post-colonial, feminist, and post-Deleuzian âhyperaffirmativeâ theorists (George Lewis, Georgina Born, and Patrick Frank, respectively). At the same time, the work of Seth Brodsky has deployed a reinvigorated Lacanian psychoanalysis to wrest deep-structural insights from both the work of Wolfgang Rihm in particular and Western culture since 1989 in general. The category of âavant-gardeâ itself has undergone philosophical re-evaluation â Martin Iddon has proposed that New Music now exists as a âsubcultureâ, while Lauren Redhead instead terms it an âexformâ, and Benjamin Piekut has identified a âvernacular avant-gardeâ which has eschewed received formal categories while enjoying institutional patronage. In response to these and many more developments, this session aims to serve as an impetus to explore the intersections of philosophy and the practices and discourses within and marginal to New Music as manifested since 1945. Potential departure points might include:\n\nHow do philosophical concernsâstated or otherwiseâinform practitioners within the avant-garde art music tradition?\n\nWhich philosophies serve to legitimate certain practicesâas âavant-garde,â âprogressive,â âinclusive,â or otherwiseâand by whom are they deployed?\n\nHow has the ontological status of the musical âworkâ changed (or not) since the post-war period?\n\nHow do âavant-gardeâ and âNew Musicâ function as aesthetic categories today?\n\nAbstracts of up to 350 words (or 500 for collaborative papers) should be sent to Max Erwin by 21 December 2018 with the subject âFrom 1945: Philosophy and New Music.â\n\nIs there a medieval 'music and philosophy'?\n\nConvenor\n\nNicholas Ball (University of Cambridge)\n\nPremodern and early-modern uses of the term âmusicaâ encompass a broad range of meanings, which include some things that we might today be happy to call music and others that we might rather call philosophy. We can turn for instance to Boethiusâ famous division of musica into cosmic music, human music, and music which rests in certain instruments (Bower 1989). Indeed the influence of musica extends far into medieval natural philosophy, in which it was fundamental to the development of cosmological models (Hicks 2017). But musica was only one interface between the musical and the philosophical; in the course of a long middle ages many other disciplinary perspectives were brought to bear to differently negotiate the relationship between music and ethics, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language (for example Leach 2007).\n\nScholars working on music and philosophy in later centuries have made use of a capacious definition of philosophy to draw out a complex and changing set of interactions, overlaps, and relations between the musical and the philosophical. The many medieval negotiations of music and philosophy offer an opportunity to reflect upon the âprehistoriesâ of ideas more usually discussed under that subdisciplinary heading, and to occasion a productive dialogue between medievalists and scholars of later centuries about the commonalities and shared concerns as well as areas of productive difference in their work.\n\nPapers are welcome on any aspect of music and philosophy in a long middle ages with reference to Latin, Arabic, or any other musical or philosophical tradition.\n\nAbstracts of up to 350 words (or 500 for collaborative papers) should be sent to Nicholas David Yardley Ball by 21 December 2018 with the subject âIs there a Medieval âMusic and Philosophyâ?â\n\nPhilosophies and Theories of musical transcription and arrangement\n\nConvenors\n\nFrankie Perry (Royal Holloway)\n\nPeter Asimov (University of Cambridge)\n\nMusical transcriptions and arrangements have been the subject of much philosophizing and theorizing. Within analytic philosophy, for instance, they have sparked ontological debate (for instance, Davies 1988; Goehr 1992; Kivy 1993; Thom 2007). Elsewhere Peter Szendyâs conception of arrangement as written-down listening fosters further plastic, ecological, and hermeneutic approaches. Within musicology, Lisztâs oeuvre of transcriptions have been explored through historical theories of translation (Kregor 2010); queer-theoretical models have been used to dissect the cultural workings of cover songs (Peraino; Halberstam 2007); considerations of the ethics of ethnographic transcription have spanned over half a century (see Stanyek 2014); and recently Daniel Leech-Wilkinson has provocatively argued that âthere are no arrangementsâ. Arrangement studies is gaining momentum, with recent conferences and volumes forthcoming, while outside the academy, musically adaptive practices continue to be ubiquitous.\n\nWe invite speakers to reignite philosophical and theoretical discussions raised by all manner of musical reimaginings. Possible topics include â but are not limited to â the following prompts: How can arrangements complicate notions of the musical work: do they reinforce, or threaten, it? Can ontological debates be sidestepped (or re-energised) by turning to concepts from performance or adaptation studies? How should we approach the abundant repertoire of contemporary compositions that re-imagine the music of the past or of different traditions, and how do issues of ownership and copyright intersect with these approaches? What are the relationships between arrangement, understandings of style, and perceptions of musical or historical time? Can new perspectives be brought to the various historical, economic, and cultural circulations and mediations of arrangements?\n\nThis session is convened by the study group âTAROTâ (âTranscription, Arrangement/adaptation, Reworking, Orchestration, and Translationâ). Building on conference sessions on âArrangements since 1900â (ICMSN, 2017) and on âReimagining Musical Reimaginingsâ (RMA, 2018), as well as a conference âRethinking musical transcription and arrangementâ (Cambridge, 2018), we hope to provoke here a philosophical and interdisciplinary discussion of these transformative musical practices.\n\nAbstracts of up to 350 words (or 500 for collaborative papers) should be sent to Frankie Perry and Peter Asimov at tarotmusicology@gmail.com by 21 December 2018 with the subject âPhilosophies and Theories of Musical Transcription and Arrangement.â\n\nReconceiving Musical Notation\n\nConvenors\n\nClÃ©ment Canonne (IRCAM-CNRS)\n\nNicolas Donin (IRCAM-CNRS)\n\nPierre Saint-Germier (IRCAM-CNRS)\n\nNotation arguably plays a central role in a great number of musical practices. By bringing philosophers and musicologists together in this themed session, we seek to bring theoretical resources from various approaches (e.g. material culture, relevance theory, embodied cognition, etc.) to enable a comprehensive theorizing of music notation.\n\nPotential topics of discussion include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nUses of musical notations\n\nWhat types of notations are used by which practitioners for what purposes? There are many cases for which notation seems to fall outside of the prescription/description dichotomy (i.e., Cardewâs Treatise), so that a widening of the repertoire of possible functions might be called for, as well as a reconceptualization of the more familiar functions.\n\nBeyond the code\n\nThere is a tendency, inherited from Nelson Goodman, to see notations as encoding musical properties. However, the code-model of communication has been severely criticized for neglecting the role of intention and inference in communication. Stressing communicationâs inferential aspects opens new avenues to discuss the traditional issues of notationâs interpretation, disambiguation, incompleteness and context-dependency.\n\nMusical ontology and musical notation\n\nOn some views of the ontology of musical works, notation is decisive, fixing the identity conditions of works and the extension of the relation of execution between a work and a performance. But this sort of view is usually based on an idealized view of musical notations and seems to deflate musicâs sonic nature. Closer attention to the details of the interface between notations and performances should therefore have an impact of the way to conceive the ontology of musical works.\n\nAlternative notations\n\nProposals for reforming the standard western notation are frequently offered. This raises questions about the reasons for this growing diversification and the various criteria (cultural, cognitive, pedagogical, aesthetic, etc.) that are used or could be used to guide the choice, by particular agents, for one notational system over another.\n\nThe ear, the eye and the body\n\nMusical notations create an interface between the ears, eyes and bodies. This suggests a reconceptualisation of such notations as cognitive artefacts, extending the processing of musical information and control of movement outside the body of the musician. How far can the currently fashionable theories of embodied and extended cognition shed light on musical notation?\n\nAbstracts of up to 350 words (or 500 for collaborative papers) should be sent to Pierre Saint-Germier by 21 December 2018 with the subject âReconceiving Musical Notation.â\n\nAll submissions to the Free Sessions and Associates Sessions will be considered by blind review by the programme committee:\n\nDr Jeremy Coleman (University of Aberdeen)\n\nDr Andrew Huddleston (Birkbeck, University of London)\n\nProfessor Derek Matravers (Open University)\n\nDr Matthew Pritchard (University of Leeds)\n\nFriedlind Riedel (Bauhaus-University Weimar)\n\nProfessor Martin Stokes (Kingâs College London)\n\nDr FÃ©rdia Stone-Davis (University of Cambridge)\n\nDr Naomi Waltham-Smith (University of Warwick)\n\nPlease contact our chair FÃ©rdia Stone-Davis with any queries about the call for papers.

The conference aimed to understand, and possibly bridge, the gap between music and philosophy. With over 80 speakers, this was the largest conference in the series so far, and was packed-full of intriguing parallel panel sessions on diverse themes ranging from music history, theology, and perception, to music ontology, language, and sound art. As such, this report will form a selective overview, and will not do justice to the true extent of research conducted over the two days. The main questions addressed by the three keynote lectures and panel sessions were:\n\nCan we, and should we, make music intelligible?\n\nHow might particular kinds of music bear on philosophical accounts of musical expression and emotion?\n\nTo what extent are the disciplines of music and philosophy conducted democratically?\n\nThe conference kicked off with a keynote lecture by Jenefer Robinson (University of Cincinnati) â âMusical emotionsâ as Aesthetic Emotions â where it was argued that aesthetic emotions are ordinary emotions but with a special set of objects. Discussion raised the issue of context, and that we should be cautious about glossing over important differences in cultural, racial, and gendered analyses of musical works. This issue of universality versus particularism became a dominant theme of the conference. A selection of panels followed on topics including: medieval philosophy and music; how we talk about music; musical transcription; and music-making and the mind. The first day closed with the second keynote by Alexander GarcÃ­a DÃ¼ttmann (UniversitÃ¤t der KÃ¼nste, Berlin) â Why Opera is a Bit Much â which asked whether we can have an opera for (almost) all.\n\nThe second day began with a very useful early-career workshop with Peter Nelson (University of Edinburgh) editor of Contemporary Music Review, and Maria Witek (University of Birmingham). More parallel sessions followed on topics including music-philosophical arguments, voice in architectural soundscapes, Sikh aesthetics, and musical notation.\n\nThe last keynote by Julian Johnson (Royal Holloway, University of London) â Language, Sense, and the Muteness of Music â formed an illuminating conclusion of the two days. It addressed how the concrete particulars of musicology, the abstract reasoning of philosophy, and the âabsent bedfellowâ of music itself in this discursive triangle, might be tied together. Johnson saw the âgapâ between music and philosophy as a vibrating site of constant negotiation, and he emphasised the importance of listening, both to music, and to one other.\n\nThe conference also drew attention to the nature of interdisciplinarity, and the importance of informal discussion. As any interdisciplinary conference participant will testify, accessibility is crucial. While itâs sometimes difficult to communicate across disciplines, several talks at this conference managed to straddle these divides, proving that research can be conducted transparently, in a way that stimulates better, and more democratic, discussion. Lastly, it was noticed that the breaks over coffee and in corridors between sessions were just as, or even more, fruitful as the formal presentations. These more intimate encounters formed a unique space in which to understand how to speak (or not speak) about music and sound; the clatter and chatter of ideas noisily whizzed around in these spontaneous moments. Now thatâs how you do a music conference: as a cacophony. Luigi Russolo would have been proud.\n\nDaisy Dixon\n\nPeterhouse, Cambridge\n\nJuly 16th 2019\n\nImpressions from the event\n\nPhoto credit: Joseph Gabor"
