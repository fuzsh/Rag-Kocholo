Entitled “Self-­Portrait in Darmstadt” and taken between 1939 and 1940, it’s one of a series of experimental self-­portraits he made contemplating the role of the photographer and photography as “a visual technology.”1 Here, two figures wear dark suits, white shirts, and roundish, dark-­rimmed spectacles, but the man on the left holds up a camera half ­blocking his face. It’s aimed at a man foregrounded on the right, whose mouth is stretched wide open in a wordless shout, scream, or song. Wordless to us, because as viewers we cannot hear the voice in the image, only imagine it. The photograph calls to us to fill in the empty “O” of his mouth, the conjured presence of this exaggerated voice, all the more powerful because it is elusive and ungraspable. The disorienting composition, augmented by a second camera lying slightly out of focus on the table, also demands that we come up with a scenario that explains the unusual setup and the identity of the figures. The man holding the camera must be Jin Shisheng himself, but then he had to have taken the photograph in a mirror. Jin’s oeuvre shows that he was fond of including multiple self-­images and cameras in a single photograph, and at first glance the two figures do look deceptively similar. Upon closer scrutiny, however, the second man is clearly someone else. Who was he, and what were the two of them doing in Darmstadt then? According to the photographer’s son, the man with his mouth open was a German friend of his father’s, who was mocking Hitler giving a speech.2 This piece of information completely transforms our view of the photograph. The aggressive gesticulation, grimacing brow, and roaring mouth all fall into place now. The visuals suggest that photos or newsreels of Hitler would have\n\nxii\n\npr e fac e\n\nf i g u r e 0.1. Jin Shisheng, “Self-­Portrait in Darmstadt,” 1939–­1940. Courtesy of Jin Hua.\n\nfurnished a model, but for the sound of the speech, the disembodied voice of der Führer inundating the radio waves—­the ghost in the machine—­was terrifyingly inescapable in Darmstadt in 1939–­1940. This photograph is a fitting entry point into The Voice as Something More because it resonates with many of the approaches to voice explored in this book. The photo compels us to reflect on the role of technology in mediating the voice and in framing it as an “object” available for study. Yet it also exposes the limitations of both technology and the objectification of voice. It suggests the extent to which all voices can be assumed, borrowed, or ventriloquized, and points to the paradoxical status of voice as something that hovers between embodiment and disembodiment, and thus raises the\n\npr e fac e\n\nxiii\n\nuncertainty of determining to whom a voice belongs.3 The story behind the photo and its caption reinforces the need to situate specific voices within a specific historical time and place, yet the overall puzzle of capturing voice that this visual image so cunningly stages can’t be solved solely by recourse to history, biography, politics, or technology. There’s always something more to the voice—­a remainder, a gap, a reverb, an echo. To get at these more phantasmatic dimensions requires additional modes of inquiry, including the psychoanalytic, the literary, the mythic, and the philosophical. This photograph also appeared on the poster and program for a three-­day international conference entitled “A Voice as Something More,” held at the University of Chicago in November 2015. Organized by the present editors, the conference served as a staging ground for the rethinking of voice studies that engendered this volume. Berthold Hoeckner’s paper was committed elsewhere and regrettably does not appear here, but we thank him and panel chairs Jim Chandler, Jacob Smith, and Paola Iovene for contributing so much to the intellectual success and liveliness of the proceedings. The conference in turn grew out of the Voice Project, a faculty research seminar initiated by an interdisciplinary group of faculty and sponsored by the University of Chicago’s Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society between 2013 and 2016. In addition to the three principal investigators of the Voice Project—­Martha Feldman (2013–­2016), David Levin (2013–­2014), and Judith Zeitlin (2014–­2016)—­the core participants included Seth Brodsky, Daniel Callahan, Tom Gunning, Sarah Nooter, Jessica Peritz, Marcelle Pierson, Steven Rings, and Neil Verma. For two years, we met several times per term, each of us taking turns curating one of these meetings. Jim Chandler, Nicholas Harkness, and Jacob Smith also presented to the group, while Nina Sun Eidsheim and James Q. Davies gave presentations at a one-­day Voice Project symposium held in spring 2014. Naturally, contributors to the present volume represent a broader range of institutions and fields. Our book is greatly enriched by contributions from the French film scholar and composer Michel Chion and the Slovenian philosopher Mladen Dolar. Both reprise their respective roles at the 2015 conference, Chion as keynote speaker and Dolar as conference respondent. Zakir Paul’s English translation, initially commissioned for use at the conference, preserves the spoken quality of Chion’s lecture, with all its digressions and wit. By happy coincidence, Dolar turned out to be teaching at the University of Chicago during the fall of 2013 when the Voice Project began meeting in earnest, and he joined our group. His presence affected the kinds of questions we were asking from the inception, and while the group moved on in other\n\nxiv\n\npr e fac e\n\ndirections after his departure, we periodically returned to these questions with fresh insights. As should be clear, the title of this volume is an affectionate riposte to Dolar’s field-­shaping book A Voice and Nothing More. His latest reflections on the chapters published here appear in the form of an afterword, which offers a major commentary on his highly influential book, ten years and more after its publication, while providing a gracious and fitting conclusion to the Voice Project and this book. A project of this duration and magnitude inevitably runs up a sizeable debt to many institutions and individuals. We gratefully acknowledge the indispensable support of the Neubauer Collegium, which sponsored not only the Voice Project but also the 2014 symposium and 2015 conference. We also thank the Franke Institute for the Humanities and the Department of Music for providing substantial additional funding for the conference. In recognition of the interdisciplinary value of voice studies, an impressive number of other entities on campus contributed further support or in-­kind help: the departments of Cinema and Media Studies, Classics, Germanic Studies, and East Asian Languages and Civilizations; the Center for East Asian Studies; the Center for Theater and Performance Studies; the Film Studies Center; and the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts. We would also like to acknowledge with gratitude the hard work and important contributions of several other key individuals: first and foremost, the Voice Project’s two graduate research interns, Marcelle Pierson (2013–­2014) and Jessica Peritz (2014–­2015), as well as Anne Rebull and Yiren Zheng, the graduate student coordinators for the conference, and Zhuqing (Lester) Hu, who served as rapporteur.4 At the Neubauer, successive faculty directors David Nirenberg and Jonathan Lear, along with their then-­staff Jamie Bender, Madeline McKiddy, and Matt Hess, deserve particular thanks. We’re grateful to Seth Brodsky for a canny reading of parts of the introduction to the book. For dropping everything at the last minute to help whip the manuscript into shape for submission, we wholeheartedly thank Shawn Marie Keener. To Marta Tonegutti, our editor at the University of Chicago Press, for her acumen and vision in shepherding this project from beginning to end, we express our deepest gratitude. Editorial director Alan Thomas saw the book through a crucial stage in its evolution. Editorial associates Susannah Engstrom and Tristan Bates, marketing director Levi Stahl, our designer Natalie Sowa, our copyeditor Marianne Tatom, and our production editor Tamara Ghattas all deserve thanks for their keenly intelligent contributions and enthusiastic support, along with others at the press. Finally, we thank Dean\n\nxv\n\npr e fac e\n\nAnne Walters Robertson and the Humanities Division at the Uni­versity of Chicago for a generous publication subvention. Notes 1.

It does so by trying at once to identify tangible aesthetic, political, ethical, literary, and musical voices and recognizing that nothing could be more elusive than a human voice, nothing more confounding. Put that dilemma together with the fact of radical divergences in talk about voice, and you have a phenomenon that is highly refractory to analysis and dialogue. Voices nowadays are caught up in fundamentally different realms of discourse, to say nothing of practice and culture: between sounding and nonsounding voices (phonic and “aphonic”), material and nonmaterial ones, between voice as a literal phenomenon and voice as a metaphorical one. No wonder voice has become the subject of so much writing in recent years, producing a “vocal turn” to rival the linguistic and visual turns of the later twentieth century.1 Here we add to the conversation by recognizing the valuable contributions to these divergences that have been made by psychoanalytic theory, with its focus on interiority, at the same time as we move in a more materialist direction. What does this materialism consist of? The timbre or “grain” of the sounding voice. The flesh, membrane, mucus, and cartilage of the mechanism that produces it. The masks, veils, and scrims that hide, throw, conceal, disguise, or displace it. The vocoders, phonographs, synthesizers, and microphones that enhance, distort, or play with it. The sheer sonic pleasure voice produces but also the fears, anxieties, and tensions that set it in motion, and thus even our sonic fantasies insofar as they “stick” to our “worldly experience” and persevere “in them and through them.”2 Materiality admits of no easy boundaries, yet in its substantive guise it nevertheless erects a lithic, obdurate counterweight to the psychoanalytic voice as it’s usually evoked.\n\n4\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nIn what follows, we begin by expanding on issues that produced our title and proceed to unpack the various essays between its covers. Along the way, we interrogate a variety of subjects related to the voice, which are to varying degrees explored within this introduction, particularly self and other, language, “grain,” technology, music, and race. Approaching the Voice 1 Let’s begin with a rich, if simple, notion: namely, that of all the sounds made in the world, only the sound of the voice “implies a subjectivity which ‘expresses itself ’ and itself inhabits the means of expression.”3 This is what we read in Mladen Dolar’s A Voice and Nothing More, a book that has had a profound effect on humanistic projects over the past decade and more. Yet there is a big “but” that follows: But if the voice is thus the quasi-­natural bearer of the production of meaning, it also proves to be strangely recalcitrant to it. If we speak in order to “make sense,” to signify, to convey something, then the voice is the material support of bringing about meaning, yet it does not contribute to it itself. It is rather like the vanishing mediator (to use the term made famous by Fredric Jameson for a different purpose)—­it makes the utterance possible, but it disappears in it, it goes up in smoke in the meaning being produced.\n\nThe voice may be linked to subjectivity, we’re told, but it is reliably neither sense-­making nor sense-­reinforcing (though, unreliably, it can be both). Nor is it ever identical to either one. That qualification haunts the relationship between voice and language in Dolar’s book, much as similar qualifications haunt the relationships between voice and body and even voice and sound. To appreciate why Dolar’s voice is not commensurate with language or body or sound means getting a handle on some basic Lacanian operations relevant to the subject, for the voice pursued by Dolar, here and elsewhere, is a so-­called “object-­voice,” the voice of Lacan’s objet a or objet petit a (object a or object small a)—­meaning that it is not “an object” in the everyday sense of the word but rather the attempted objectification, or even inverted projection, of a constitutive lack in the subject. It is a lack inverted into a surplus. As such, it is a voice always in excess of bodies, languages, and sounds (including musical sounds), functioning as it does as an elusive (object-­)cause of desire. Neither the body (“the physics of the voice”) nor language (“the linguistics of the voice”) nor sound can\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n5\n\nbillet all its locations, meanings, and maneuvers, uttered or internal. Always left over, or on the escape, is something in the voice that cannot be accommodated or internalized, and therefore that contributes to maintaining it as a kind of other that is forever mysterious and alien to the self.4 In this, the Lacanian voice departs from “ordinary” meanings of voice, which see it (as Dolar stresses) as the bearer of semantic meaning or the source of aesthetic admiration (in addition to promoting such Western commonplaces as voice as a token of identity or a metaphor for individuality or sovereignty).5 The former notion, voice as bearer of semantic meaning, would understand it rather unproblematically as that which conveys signification, carrying signs to their proper destinations where they become available for decoding. It would see a large zone of overlap between semantic meaning and phonic utterance, if not their total congruence. The latter notion, voice as source of aesthetic admiration, would see it as that which produces (or claims to produce) such feelings as delight, sorrow, or yearning, rather than understanding voice skeptically, and would perceive in it a bulwark against threats, fetishistic disavowals of castration (I attach myself passionately to this beautiful aesthetic object so as to deflect my attention from the real object that disturbs and threatens me). We return to both points below. In delineating each of these, Dolar places voice in a position of prominence, and one that revises and virtually opposes, if somewhat orthogonally, Derrida’s critique of voice. In Derrida, voice—­in particular the silent inner voice of the subject—­is essentially demoted from its lofty position in the metaphysics of Husserl, where it is a special token of subjective self-­presence or “autoaffection” and is exposed rather as a site of difference and alterity in the subject. Dolar, like his countryman and sometime collaborator Slavoj Žižek, instead elevates voice. Far from perceiving voice as being of a piece with the subject or even situated alongside the subject at all, voice for Dolar and Žižek situates itself not on the side of what the subject is or produces but on the side of what the subject perceives and above all desires.6 Voice for the Lacanian subject exists as an object. And what the subject perceives in that object is an illusory figment of desire, with desire understood as a linguistic force that voids and cuts up the subject, yet is at the same time continuous and unconscious.7 Since the thing desired is illusory insofar as it technically does not exist, the subject can only circle around it, trying to hitch a ride with it, so to speak, to hook onto it in some way, meandering toward, around, and about it in order to find this presumed target, but forever missing it. That failed encounter, that missing of the object or object-­cause (objet a), is something the subject fails even to experience as a “lack” or a “gap,” for it is so covered over in fantasy. And yet that lack or gap, in all its negativity, is defining.8\n\n6\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nWhat justifies this emplacement of voice in a relation of alterity and desire to the subject, rather than keeping it within the subject? To answer that question, we need to understand that in Lacanian accounts of early psychic development, an “object” is most often another person (classically, a parent), who, by virtue of a relationship, most often indirect, helps bring the subject to self-­ consciousness. Initially it is part-­objects—­not persons, but things, like breasts or, in our case, voices—­in relation to which the subject develops. Crucially, the object-­voice does not in and of itself act as a kind of substitute. On the contrary (and to go back to the ordinary meanings of voice above): anything that does act as a substitute for this object-­voice—­a fantasy that represses desire, more precisely—­does so by repressing it as something disturbing. Hence music can have the force of a substitute, in particular when it departs from language, or from what Dolar calls “textual anchorage,” such that even the sound of a flute or oboe or a vocal melisma might function as a disavowal of the inner psychic disturbance that the object-­voice represents.9 What has been striking about this theory to both critics and fans is that it leads a true Lacanian to the conclusion, faute de mieux, that all voices are acousmatic, their source never visible or otherwise fully accessible to their bearers or hearers. The term goes back to Michel Chion’s usage in The Voice in Cinema and before him to that of his teacher, electronic composer Pierre Schaeffer, though there the acousmatic is a particular and marked phenomenon that occurs with respect to voice, not a universal condition of it.10 For Dolar, by contrast, there can be no such thing as what he calls “disacousmatization” (alternatively: “de-­ acousmatization”), the revelation of the source of the voice, since all voice is constitutively obscure and intangible to the desiring subject: in a word, acousmatic.11 Dolar’s object-­voice has prompted a series of extensions and divagations. In an ambitious and probing gloss, musicologist Freya Jarman-­Ivens ventures a queering of Dolar’s psychoanalytic approach, extending his sense of voice as “operator of a divide” to encompass gender within what in her treatment becomes a kind of third space. In the process, she shows how voice navigates between body and language, speaker/singer and listener, inside and outside such that there is no fixity of category, no set borders for voice, thus opening up new possibilities for understanding voice as a medium of intersubjective identification.12 Philosopher Karmen MacKendrick explores the acousmatic dimensions of Dolar’s object-­voice as a starting point for thinking about disjunctions between bodies and voices—­voices that are always embodied, but in no one-­to-­one voice/body relationship and in ways that always involve vocal borrowings from others.13 For theater and performance studies scholar Lynne Kendrick, the object-­voice inspires an inquiry into dramatic,\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n7\n\nimaginative uses of acousmatic voices that are constitutive of subjects in contemporary theater.14 Scholar of rhetoric Jason David Myres portrays the mechanical voice of Stephen Hawking in Dolarian fashion as an objet petit a for Hawking’s ambivalent publics, even proposing that Hawking’s publics function as a collective object-­voice (“Our publics . . . are never more potent than when we cannot see or hear them”).15 East Asianist Ken C. Kawashima reads in Dolar’s politics of voice “a force of political organizing, especially in a state of emergency,” as regards sovereignty and its relations to life and what Giorgio Agamben calls bare life (homo sacer), adducing the instance of Emperor Hirohito making and broadcasting his surrender speech after the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.16 And communications scholar Joshua Gunn invokes the object-­voice as a help in confronting “the now widely assumed critique of the dreaded ‘metaphysics of presence’ by Jacques Derrida.’ ”17 If there have been detractors, they have not diminished the power of Dolar’s text as a stimulus to thought across a wide range of disciplines, nor have their net effects unseated the text from its position of prominence.18 2 To be sure, the object-­voice limned by Dolar and engaged by others is not the only voice in psychoanalytic writing, nor is it the one that dominates Dolar’s own field of philosophy or its offshoot, phenomenology, much less the fields of musicology, anthropology, literary studies, gender studies, cinema studies, political theology, communication theory, or any number of others. Why then the grip of A Voice and Nothing More on the humanistic disciplines? First, and putting aside the wit and lure of Dolar’s own writerly voice, there is something attractive about a voice that functions as an object of desire, steering a course with no real object, a course that does not really want satisfaction or cessation but only wants of itself in its endless process of not being able to reach an indefinite it. Dolar gives us a voice that eludes our grasp, slithering out of arm’s reach in a continually recursive movement. Second, and relatedly, there is something seductive about the intermedial status that Dolar’s object-­voice sanctions, even if that intermedial status overlaps with a Lacanian voice without being tantamount to it. The object-­voice operates not inside the mouth and throat, nor even inside the mind or ego, but in some still harder to grasp inside and outside, on an edge between both body and language. As Dolar illustrates (and as noted above), it is the middle term in a Venn diagram, the “operator of a divide.”19 Third, philosophically speaking, Dolar furnishes a more or less coherent theory of voice that is otherwise hard to come by, most especially in Lacan, a voice that reaches out in a number of different directions and gives\n\n8\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nus, from each direction, something metabolized by combining psychoanalysis and philosophy with other fields of thought. And lastly, even beyond any of the above, in telling us readers (and writers) about voice as an object of desire, Dolar has also, importantly, turned the voice itself into a kind of discursive object of desire. It might not be too much to say that that has been his greatest effect. In assembling this volume, we make no attempt to offer a systematic assessment of Dolar’s work. Many here use Dolar as a starting or ending point, while others bypass it to ask different questions about the stuff and stakes of voices, what we designate as the “something more” that our authors are after. The sounding voice, the music-­producing voice, the radiophonic voice, the cinematic voice, the gendered voice, the screaming voice, the racialized voice, the recorded voice, the modernist voice, the manufactured voice, the composer’s voice. The voices of mimicry, cinema, terror, politics, race, myth, media archaeology, writing, archiving, preserving. Far from being a systematic, much less philosophical or psychoanalytic confrontation with Dolar’s object-­voice, ours is more like an aleatory set of encounters that produces some crucial remainders. If a single propensity unifies us, it is, again, a propensity toward materiality—­toward reinstating the phonic, sounding voice, thinking about the technological and cultural mediations of voice, attending to vocal listeners and producers, considering how voices are borrowed, owned, mythologized, gendered, “raced,” and imitated, attending to auditors, speakers, singers, and interlocutors, testing the limits of voice, and yes, also wondering how phonic musical and literary voices might expose defects in the circuitry that mobilizes the psychoanalytic one. 3 Our concentration on materialities takes us back to what is by now an origin myth in studies of voice—­the notion of “grain” as expressed in Roland Barthes’s “The Grain of the Voice,” which Jonathan Dunsby has aptly characterized as something of a slogan.20 Barthes’s essay is of course a trope on Julia Kristeva’s notion that all signifying systems, including nonverbal ones such as music, are semiotic systems. Taking off on Kristeva’s neologisms “phenotext” (coded semiotically) and “genotext” (coded socially and physiologically), and wanting to get around the persistence of the adjective (“the predicable”) in approaching music,21 Barthes proposes that in music there is “pheno-­song” and “geno-­song.” Pheno-­song “covers all the phenomena, all the features which belong to the structure of the language being sung, the rules of the genre, the coded form of the melisma, the composer’s idiolect, the style of the interpretation. . . .”22 More relevantly for us, geno-­song\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n9\n\nis the volume of the singing and speaking voice, the space where significations germinate “from within language and in its very materiality”; it forms a signifying play having nothing to do with communication, representation (of feelings), expression; it is that apex (or that depth) of production where the melody really works at the language—­not at what it says, but the voluptuousness of its sound-­signifiers, of its letters—­where melody explores how language works and identifies with that work. It is, in a very simple word but which must be taken seriously, the diction of the language.23\n\nIn short, geno-­song is the grain of the voice. In the grain is “the tongue, the glottis, the teeth, the mucous membranes, the nose.” In the grain is the body. It’s easy to poke holes in Barthes’s theory, and many have. His evidence, consisting of a mere two singers—­a French one he deeply loved and a German one he disdained, each passion seared with nationalistic ardor—­makes for a case that is far too small for its claim, such that the essay ends up as an erotics of Barthes’s own experience of listening with no tethering to a wider cultural world.24 Still, no amount of quibbling with the argumentation or premises of Barthes’s text has been able to significantly lower its impact. For, together with a new longing for voice and a sounding out of its ethics, there has been an urge to restore bodies to voices that modernism threatened to annihilate. In this, Barthes might be viewed as a virtual antithesis to Dolar (notwithstanding the psychoanalytic resonances in his text), inasmuch as what Barthes wants, what he longs for, is above all not just a material voice but a body in the voice, a phonic, envoicing body, and a voice that bodies forth.25 Language matters not because of diction or “meaning” in their conventional senses, but because one of Barthes’s avowed aims in making recourse to vocal music is “to displace the fringe of contact between music and language,” and thereby open things up to voice itself and the body with it.26 In one sense, the opening Barthes thereby allows is a narrow and confounding one, vested in the French critical tradition yet highly idiosyncratic. It has nonetheless occasioned queered and “raced” readings in the likes of Jarman-­Ivens and Elias Krell, who critique its cultural and political failures but nevertheless value the support it lends embodied, identificatory practices of listening and practices of musicking (specifically “voicing”) that tend to afford agency to precarious and marginalized peoples.27 4 Anyone concerned with the relationship between voice and language, as well as the odd crevices of social life, would do well to turn to Michel de Certeau, especially (for the former) to his essay on glossolalia (of speaking in tongues) but also his writings in The Mystic Fable, volume 1.28 Certeau opens\n\n10\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nup a new strategy for exploring voice by means of the “vocal utopia” of glossolalia. For Certeau, speaking in tongues is a mere “illusion” of speech that in itself expresses nothing and signifies nothing. In this regard, glossolalia is not really as exceptional an idiom as may seem at first blush, since it “already pushes up through the cracks of ordinary conversation: bodily noises, quotations of delinquent sounds, and fragments of others’ voices punctuate the order of sentences with breaks and surprises.”29 As a kind of “secondary vocalization,” glossolalia, along with its kin (think of vocalise, babble, stuttering, aphasia, groaning), is opposed to what Certeau calls “the major voice,” the supposed “messenger of meaning” (even though here too there is a convergence of the major and secondary voices because the former is always already compromised). Only when the major voice radically “liberates itself from its disquieting twin” (secondary vocalization) by engaging in propositional discourses such as the political, scholarly, or religious—­discourses that largely close themselves off from the ruptures of voice—­can alternative voice be suppressed and speaking circumvent dialogue. Only then can speaking defend itself from the messiness of dialogue and by the same token circumvent the Other, or at least appear to.30 In contrast to propositional speech, what conversation does—­and we will see this strongly in song—­is precisely to open discourse to the noises and vexations of otherness. Conversation and dialogue challenge speech, for “as it approaches its addressee, speech becomes fragile.” As voices take possession of discourse, voodoo-­like, they “trouble, break, or suspend” the autonomy of a speaker. They do so as a kind of Lacanian Other (although Certeau never calls them that)—­an indefinable, ungraspable object: “Here and there, they spirit . . . [discourse] away from me, without my knowing what they are or whence they come. What other thing within me gives rise to them?” Noise or gibberish or senseless speech—­“secondary vocalizations”—­are thus manifestly about subject/object relations. While starting with the subject’s ego, however, those relations ultimately lead to an un-­Lacanian place, namely to the explicit dimensions of the social and to actual sounding voice: From the clamor of voices [sabbat de voix] overrunning and breaking up the field of statements comes a mumble that escapes the control of speakers and that violates the supposed division between speaking individuals. It fills the space between speakers with the plural and prolix act of communication and creates, mezza voce, an opera of enunciation on the stage of verbal exchange.31\n\nGlossolalia, like other “mumblings,” shines the spotlight on the phenomenon of speakers losing control of and violating divisions between one another. It\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n11\n\nstands in for the complex relation of language and meaning as conveyed by voice in what are largely if not purely social domains. For glossolalia and the like enable a passage between what Certeau calls “can not say” (i.e., muteness) and “can say” (i.e., speech) by introducing an illusion or fable into that passage, which organizes its receivers politically by ushering tale-­telling into the symbolic order. Glossolalia can thus be thought of as a virtual stand-­in for the slippery social and political effects of voice as the vehicle for verbal exchange. In The Mystic Fable, volume 1, Certeau is concerned with related urges toward unsaying and the ambiguous place between saying and not saying, language and not language. The mystic experience and utterance represent for him the unstable relationship of voice to language. Mysticism gives speech license to make use of excess, directly so in theological writings, and in ways that undo the coherence of signification. As a prime example, Certeau invokes the seventeenth-­century case of the mannerist Diego de Jesús, introducer of John of the Cross, the destination of whose discourse—­its “addressee” or mode of address—­“takes precedence over the validity of the statement” (141). However much Certeau recognizes that Diego’s excess is connected to his mannerist style, he keeps his ear fixed on how the edges of language intersect with voice through extravagant troping, deviations of meaning, and “monstrous” oxymorons, comparable to the wider colonialist offenses of early modernity evinced in Ambroise Paré’s monstrous bodies or Jean de Léry’s “dissimilar beings.”32 Speech then becomes an excessive in-­between that is akin to voice without being equivalent to it; and mystic discourse increases the number and complexity of such kinds of speech.33 It’s tempting to think that Certeau, in calling attention to the voice/language relationship, was also broaching the notion of social performance, intersubjective communication, and attendant notions of listeners.34 When he draws attention to Rabelais’s famed fable of the “melted words”—­an acousmatic specter of shipwrecked voices sunk to the ocean depths and then raised from the dead as they start to speak in the thaw of a gelid winter—­he asks: “Will words that time has frozen become voices again (addressed by whom to whom?)?” The recital of those lost voices, and their urge to be heard, prompts Certeau to remind us that, according to Émile Benveniste, the circumstances of a mystic utterance are precisely those of a performance in a social domain. They are “the conversion of language into discourse.”35 Speech becomes performance. The leap from phonic verbal performance, with its interrelational implications, to the performative preoccupations of much of the most dynamic work that’s been done on voice in the past twenty-­five years is not that great. We might date it to the publication of The Queen’s Throat, when Wayne\n\n12\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nKoestenbaum blew the lid off voice thinking with his canny and hilarious romp through the overlapping terrains of gay desire, performance, and divadom in the opera house and the living room.36 More recently, there’s been some meticulously grounded cultural work that studies the edges of performance as they relate to vocality, and shows their effects on matters of identity. These take shape in studies of queer voices by Krell, Jarman-­Ivens, Judith Halberstam, and Deborah Vargas,37 but also in a variety of ethnographic traditions. Amanda Weidman’s Singing the Classical, Voicing the Modern, for example, analyzes the elision of voice with classicism in twentieth-­century performances that map out a concertedly modern space of Indianness. In Songs of Seoul, Nicholas Harkness shows how clean vocalizing, especially in classical singing, becomes identified with Christianity and with the modernity of the nation in South Korean singing practices, training close attention on both their bodily and phenomenological dimensions. 5 What relationship do these various projects have to that most performative and stylized of all speech acts—­music uttered through the mouth and throat, and even nonvocal musics that recall or index the voice (as with Seth Brodsky’s essay in this volume)? It hardly needs saying that understanding vocal performance as the object of a fetish is not the view of an academic majority and certainly not the layman’s view. Vernacularly, voice is asserted as the most revealing manifestation of a unitary self, and something that can set voice apart from language. As singer Jeff Buckley put it in a famous Paris interview: Your voice is your essence. Ask any singer, it’s the most revealing thing you could possibly do. . . . The voice gives you information. You know how people talk in two languages, the words that they give you and the information that is really conveyed through the sound of their voice? That’s how children learn to speak, that’s how people know the truth.38\n\nHeedless of exhortations we hear nowadays to discern in voices a multiplicity of others, Buckley—­famed (ironically) for masterfully imitating but also transforming numerous styles and voices in a richly internalized brew—­ suggests that voice aligns with a pure interiority of the self.39 Yet even as Buckley asserts this, he describes a voice that does not sync up perfectly with language, but often works around it in perpetuating untruths. Hence its division from language remains.40 That divide of sound and sense and the varied relations it animates is the subject of numerous writings on voice, many of them oriented in music\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n13\n\nand lyric voice. Aaron Fox’s Real Country, for example, notes that “singing and vocal movements in the direction of song mark the embodied and emplaced sociality of language, which may even achieve temporary dominance over referential sense.”41 Sarah Nooter’s The Mortal Voice in the Tragedies of Aeschylus makes this proposition a starting point for an astutely lyrical understanding of Aeschylus’s sound world.42 Bonnie Gordon wants to overturn the Rousseauian philosophical tradition that claims that words and music were fused in some originary mythic gloss by looking at how the machinic body of the castrato (whose intentionally altered voice and anatomy “brings materiality of voice to the fore”) is mediated through the intervention of voice “as matter instrumentalized.”43 And the relation is paramount in Gary Tomlinson’s study of Aztec song in the era of contact between Europeans and American “others,” which attempts to characterize what is particular in the relation voice : language by expanding the Derridean dyad of speech and writing (by which the subject has long been implicated in Western metaphysics) to a triad encompassing speech, writing, and vocalization that carves out a special place for voice. It is worth dilating on this last, precisely because for Tomlinson the addition of vocalization to the speech/writing dyad is essential to the business of listening closely to others.44 It shapes his study and explains why he launches his narrative with an instance of the terror produced in seafaring Europeans by a sound that seemed to them to escape the semantic order—­the terrifying yet all-­too-­human cawing of cahows, Bermudan seabirds whose screeching explorers found so demonic that it caused them to abandon the isle.45 Other examples follow as Tomlinson listens for the cultural work that various contact-­era American songs aimed to accomplish, and that Euro­­ pean travelers readily ignored (the cosmogonic work of songs among the Inca, the sacred immanence in songs of the Aztecs, the sheer fullness and excess of Tupi songs in Brazil). Yet even as these vocal sounds and musics model something of what Certeau called, in a rather Lacanian formulation, “the insurmountable alterity from the subject’s desire,” the desire they mobilize arguably moves American song through, around, or alongside language and signmaking, not totally outside them.46 Contact-­era American songs thus deserve a special place in the pantheon where previously speech and writing competed for rule.47 If these historical and ethnographic projects attempt to think through the material relations of language, voice, and music, philosopher Adriana Cavarero, in her much-­read For More Than One Voice: Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression, gives us a far more sweeping project: namely to elevate the status of voice, including the singing voice, as a way to upend the millennia-­old\n\n14\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nphilosophical centrality of language, logos, and the symbolic order.48 Central to this effort is her valorization of the uniqueness of all sounding voices, what she calls a “vocal ontology,” contra Aristotle, for whom only semantic utterance counts as voice, entangled as it is in his conglomerated entity “signifying voice” (phone semantike). Counterpoised to Aristotle here is Derrida, whose notion of voice is still sutured to logos as a site of meaning-­intention—­of autoaffective presence—­where it remains problematically (for Cavarero) silent, speaking inwardly only to the self. In her imagining, neither phone semantike nor that silent voice can tell us anything about voices that sound and resound such that each is uniquely indicative of a particular person. Only a body to which a sounding voice is attached can tell us that. Whether Cavarero’s axiom of uniqueness holds water is a matter for debate. Brian Kane has disputed it for philosophical and epistemological reasons (how can the uniqueness of all voices be established?), and studies of vocal mimicry, like Laurie Stras’s and Tom Gunning’s in this volume and Steven Connor’s on ventriloquism, would seem implicitly to challenge it on empirical ones (if voices can so easily imitate, how can they be unique?).49 We might bracket such criticisms on grounds that Cavarero’s focus on uniqueness is more ethically and politically motivated than philosophically so, and read her text as a recalibration of metaphysics carried out to shift authoritarian attention away from the semantic regime and toward the body, including the musicking body. If we’re right in doing so, then we could say that music in Cavarero overturns the centrality of language all told by introducing a voice that hums and sings, allowing in her work what Ryan Dohoney calls “a space of contestation between voice and signification.”50 For Cavarero, a lifelong feminist, this antimetaphysical music also introduces pleasure into the body/ language nexus as part of a feminine logic, as against the masculine logic of logos/semantics.51 Music is commensurate with unique souls interacting within an “interrelational plurality,” which in turn constitutes a utopian feminist space that accommodates difference. 6 Does music do all these things for voice? And does voice do something that cannot be comprehended under the auspices of sound alone? Recent tendencies in the academy push us toward rethinking music as a subset of the larger category of sound and away from our past focus on music as a unique, exalted domain preternaturally bent on edging out others by colonizing them or representing them as noisy (non-­Western) alterities.52 Yet in considering voice some find reason to preserve a bit of music qua music. For Nina Sun\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n15\n\nEidsheim, the argument—­turning the anticolonialist one on its head—­is ethical, drawing its case from the realm of experimental vocal music to think against the “figure of sound” as static, symbolizing, and thus essentializing and in favor of a “principle of vibration” as the basis for voice and music as flexible, relational, and listener-­oriented.53 By what other name would we call the organized, expressive vocality of Neanderthals, which in Gary Tomlinson’s account precedes the symbolic by as much as 250,000 years?54 The most sustained arguments on questions of music and voice in the American and continental critical traditions have come from Carolyn Abbate in work that now spans nearly three decades.55 At the outset, Abbate mapped out a peculiarly personal view of voice, not as vocal performance per se but as “certain isolated and rare gestures in music, whether vocal or nonvocal, that may not be perceived as modes of subjects’ enunciations” (the wordless coloratura in Lakmé’s “Bell Song” or the melismas in the Queen of the Night’s arias, for example).56 At the same time, Abbate’s “voice” has also generally been a “voice-­object,” hence something the search for which is persistent and which the presence of a performing body can actually impede. Indeed, what makes the voice/body/music relationship operative for Abbate is that the music-­oriented object-­voice tends to generate the uncanny—­a condition that emerges when music is in the mix but its partner language is destroyed and the performer thus terrifyingly dehumanized, affecting onlookers much like the inscrutable cahows of Tomlinson’s Bermudan narrative.57 Music of course has a curious part in all this. In nineteenth-­century Europe, philosophers wanted it to be voiceless and better yet textless in order to be pure and transcendent. Yet Abbate shows that while music may escape language, it has a privileged relationship with voice, and even did then. In Search of Opera clarifies and deepens our sense of that relationship by reorienting our thinking about European opera around a range of transhuman and largely material (if sometimes intangible) media: vessels, mediums, ghosts, inanimate objects.58 Think of the Commendatore in Don Giovanni or the mother Antonia in the last act of Les Contes d’Hoffmann, characters that “amplify” (an Abbatean concept) our sense of things by offering themselves as phantasmic, incorporeal presences, and in ways that are at once epistemological (because omniscient), psychological (because persuasive), and imaginary (because loud). Both music and voice carry the danger that what lies behind the trickery is something that is made to seem human but isn’t: a mere ghost in the machine.59 Engendering the uncanny, those ghosts are also manifest in technologies of vocality. Abbate’s disembodied voice, musical and non, almost always suggests chicanery, power, and authority in the guise of a bedeviling apparatus. So it is\n\n16\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nwith Dolar, whose opening gambit is a foray into automata the phenomenal effects of which, like the circuitry of Lacanian desire, belie their cause. But notions of disembodied voice that are bound up with media have also gone beyond the Lacanian gloss. In “Sound Object Lessons” (2016), Abbate thinks in unpredictable ways about technological affordances, especially the microphone as used in film, in relation to voice and sound. “Amplification” remains a grounding trope, but now in the form of the “sound close-­up,” auditory equivalent to the cinematic (visual) close-­up whereby experience of the enlarged thing might do something to the relevant sense but will not do it unidirectionally (thing working on sense), but multidirectionally (things, bodies, notions working on senses and senses on things, bodies, notions). The cash-­ out is not a single argument but a series of insights, privileging something like Deleuzian flatness over argumentational hierarchy in a way that is amenable to the very object that voice is. 7 Media and the apparatus have similarly preoccupied writers on ventriloquism, including Kane and Connor, as well as writers on the posthuman voice—­the voice transmitted through prostheses or manipulated by other technological means—­which in turn has ended up foregrounding questions about race and voice.60 How did this happen? An early instance comes from Alexander Weheliye’s now indispensable critique of N. Katherine Hayles’s How We Became Posthuman (1999), a critique that says that the subject of Hayles’s “posthuman body,” far from being a human subject in all its infinite variety, is in fact the liberal enlightened white subject of the later eighteenth century.61 For Weheliye, as for others working in the vein of critical race theory, the body of the black subject is a different matter, and it is most spectacularly manifested in formations of blackness produced in technologically leveraged modes of music-­making and in any number of technologically driven genres tied to black creativity, from rap and hip-­hop to dub, zook, funk, house, afropop, and so on. In this, the black body, he asserts, is not fully given (or “a given”), but conjured, most compellingly by such now-­classic black writers of the last century as W. E. B. DuBois, Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin, all of whom worked to discover a new black subject that has been brutally owned, commoditized, circulated, stolen, slain, and generally laid low.62 Blackness is never simply and already in the voice and body that materialize that subject (though in part it is); rather, for Weheliye and others, black voice and body also insinuate themselves into different\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n17\n\ndiscourses and techniques: writing, phonography, and machinic technologies of recording, sampling, and special effects (cell-­phone rings, vocoder effects, and so on) that rematerialize and restage those bodies and voices (cf. Andrew F. Jones’s essay in this volume). Black voices in popular music here are thus like Deleuze and Guattari’s “desiring machines,” where desire and its object are effectively one and the same. Technologies and bodies find their way into other writings on race and voice, if differently motivated. Josh Kun’s Audiotopia: Music, Race, and America (2005) is mobilized by its focus on identity as the sine qua non of music as it concerns bodies, voices, and races.63 Strikingly for our purposes, Kun tracks the technology of identity-­making through Baldwin, whose memoir The Devil Makes Work (1975) recounts how his experiences with movie-­watching start out by forcing him to watch a stranger but end up with the stranger watching him. They turn into acts of making the strange familiar inasmuch as watching the stranger makes the viewer into a stranger to himself. Baldwin’s account explains for Kun the mechanism of difference, helping ground the claim that music (especially popular music) is permanently entangled with race, functioning like Foucault’s “heterotopias” or Certeau’s “delinquent spaces” to allow “a kind of effectively enacted utopia,” an “identificatory contact zone” delineated through heard songs and voices.64 Nowhere was that contact zone stronger for Baldwin than with the sound of a blues voice, especially the voice of Bessie Smith, mediated by the alterity of the phonograph to unlock “airless, labeled [identity] cells,” queerly and racially charged.65 Race writings on voice are hardly reducible to any single genre or tilting. Recent ones instead find common footing in the restoration of agency to listeners and above all performers, especially vocalists of color, as witnessed in essays by Stras, Jones, Feldman, and Rings in this volume. For the voice of color, agency means above all vocal heterogeneity and difference, sounding out in what Fred Moten calls “the break,” operating in the in-­between.66 Not infrequently, this involves forms of borrowing that amount to thievery, as Daphne Brooks insists in the case of Amy Winehouse (the thief) and Maureen Mahon in the case of Big Mama Thornton (the one thieved from).67 It involves what Brooks, Malik Gaines, and Joshua Chambers-­Letson all think of as using voice to resist and negate the impossible negativity of the condition of color, and what Beth Coleman thinks of as deploying vocal and other technologies as a resource for making racial agency.68 And it comports with intersectional theories of race and gender that see in voice a new opening onto modes of agency, relationality, mobility. It would be hard to think how restitution of the body of the voice could be more urgent for our time.\n\n18\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nThe Chapters The chapters in this volume constitute a clamor of voices in yet another sense from that sketched above. We have organized the book to highlight the eclecticism and plurality of the contributions by disrupting obvious groupings by discipline, geography, historical period, or genre. Instead, we deliberately mix it up so that a sinologist brushes up against a theorist of contemporary pop music, a media archaeologist of radio against an analyst of high modernist music, a classicist against a historian of cinema, and a historiographer of kabuki against a critic of Jamaican dancehall. The point is to make the authors converse with one another outside their comfort zones, in an effort to capture the freewheeling give-­and-­take of the Neubauer faculty seminar and capstone conference at the University of Chicago out of which these essays emerged. Not minimizing or papering over gaps and breaks between the chapters is a deliberate strategy adopted in this book for several other reasons. As a concept, the “gap” has proven extraordinarily productive for theorizing about voice, particularly in the Lacanian vein developed by Dolar in his influential work. On a thematic level, the “gap” plays a recurrent structuring role throughout many of the contributions to the volume, most prominently in Martha Feldman’s essay on virtuosic vocal failure, which is simply entitled “Voice Gap Crack Break.” Then, too, in a new, messy field like voice studies with so many avenues still to be explored, omissions and disjunctions are inevitable, completeness or comprehensiveness neither possible nor desirable. What all the chapters do share is a tendency to push back against the blind spots or conventional wisdom in their respective fields, to challenge certain commonplaces in thinking about voice. Each contribution in its own way also grapples with the materiality of the voice by keeping concrete, contextualized voices in the foreground, rather than allowing voice as an object of analysis to fade into pure metaphor or figurative generalization. So Robert Polito’s chapter takes on that indispensable chestnut, the trope of the poet’s voice, via James Merrill’s monumental poem The Changing Light at Sandover, which incorporates large swaths of voices from beyond the grave, dictated to him through the Ouija board. Neil Verma’s chapter tackles the scream not as the exemplar of voice prior to or exceeding language (“the voice as it screams”), but as a concrete problem of aesthetics and technology in radio horror drama (“a voice as it screams”). The subtlety of Seth Brodsky’s arguments in dismantling another sacred cow is offset by the bluntness of his title: “There Is No Such Thing as the Composer’s Voice.” And James Q. Davies’s chapter proudly wears its polemics on its sleeve, declaring itself in its title to be “Against the Voice Itself.”\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n19\n\n1 In the opening section, “Sound-­Producing Voice,” both music theorist Steven Rings and Chinese opera historian Judith Zeitlin approach the physical, sounding voice as residing on a kind of continuum. For Rings, the continuum of interest lies between speech and song, with the difference between them being one of degree, rather than of kind. Although he posits that porousness between speech and song is the norm, the two idioms nonetheless coexist in what he calls “a contextual asymmetry” so that in any given context, one of them will predominate, “setting off its other like a figure against the ground.” And it is within this “other,” this marked figure, that the materiality of the voice comes to the fore. In ordinary life, song is the marked term, speech the unmarked one, but within the world of Anglophone popular music, which furnishes the test case for his study, this dynamic is reversed. Here, singing becomes the norm, and speaking the marked term (with early hip-­hop/rap being a notable exception). Ranging over recordings by stars from country music, punk rock, R&B, folk revival, and hip-­hop, Rings pinpoints what exactly happens and what is at stake in those moments where speech emerges from within song. Far from a mere formal experiment, Rings’s chapter probes how such interplay between song and speech affects the meaning of the lyrics, the persona of the singer, and modes of address to the audience, buttressing his conclusion that voice, more than any other “sonic element” in a song, matters as “a vehicle for social interactions.” Zeitlin confronts a different problem as she tries to figure out how the human voice was theorized in Chinese thought before the modern era, in a system where voice was not overladen with extensive figurative meanings and never built up into a master trope on the order of “identity,” “agency,” “subjectivity,” and “style.” She argues that linguistically and conceptually, the default in Chinese discourse has been to situate the voice on a continuum with other sounds rather than isolating it as a separate category. Her strategy therefore is to uncover certain key moments where the human voice is distinguished as something different and valorized. This leads her to trace the emergence of different models of the sounding voice from antiquity to the eighteenth century. She locates a pivotal change in court literature of the Six Dynasties (third–­fifth century CE), where the voice is championed as superior to other musical instruments because more “natural.” This discourse of “naturalism” produces new theorizations of the human voice: as a carnal instrument whose material substrate is flesh, thus linking it to the sensual body of an entertainer; as a conduit of communication beyond language requiring no external tool; and as the origin of music, which is inherent in the human organism\n\n20\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nthrough the tonal qualities of (the Chinese) language itself. She concludes with another pivotal change, this time appearing in an eighteenth-­century pedagogical treatise for the voice by physician Xu Dachun during the heyday of Kun opera. This treatise, she argues, develops a kind of modern technê for instrumentalizing the singer’s body in a utopian attempt (a defensive fantasy, we might say psychoanalytically) to invest voice with the ability to bridge the gap separating musics of the past and the present. 2 If Rings and Zeitlin track variation across a normative continuum, Marcelle Pierson and Neil Verma swing to the other extreme in the following section to offer “Limit Cases” for apprehending the voice—­that of sung text in high musical modernism for Pierson, and the scream in radio for Verma. Pierson sees the status of voice as coming into conflict with the ideology of musical modernism in the work of postwar Darmstadt composers because associated with old-­fashioned melody, emotion, and humanism. She reads two cases, both instances of texts set to music using serial techniques in the late 1950s, as taking diametrically different approaches to the problem of voice defined in opposition to the other: Luigi Nono’s Il canto sospeso (“The Suspended Song”) and Karlheinz Stockhausen’s Gesang der Jünglinge (“Song of the Youth”). Although Nono’s piece was written for live performance, and Stockhausen’s for the recording studio, both selected texts of acute historical and emotional significance in the wake of the Second World War, and both strove to make words themselves unintelligible, dismantling and disfiguring them as a way to recuperate, however paradoxically, the viability of the human voice in their music. In Verma’s witty chapter, the scream turns the “extreme” voice, the voice “on edge,” the voice beyond language, into a technical and ontological problem for radio. It’s unclear from listening to recordings of live radio dramas from the 1940s, for instance, whether a given scream was made by a vocal performer or as a special effect by an engineer, whether it was made live on air or by putting in prerecorded sound. As such, Verma’s examples also point to another sort of unknowable gap in the disembodied, acousmatic voice(s) of and on radio, which enhances their effect of uncanniness. At the heart of his chapter is a tour de force reading of a classic radio horror play from the 1940s called “The Thing on the Fourble Board,” in which he treats the scream as a “source of critical approach to radio listening rather than a problem to be solved by one.” The shocking revelation of the Thing’s identity provides him with a platform to stage an allegorical reading of the “ritualized birth\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n21\n\nof a voice” hovering somewhere between audibility and inaudibility, which in turn provides him a key for excavating the buried history of radio as a medium. 3 Robert Polito’s contribution initiates a new section (“Vocal Owners and Borrowed Voices”), but his chapter, no less than Pierson’s and Verma’s, focuses on a limit case, where, to borrow Polito’s borrowing of T. J. Clark, “the pressures and capacities of a particular mode of representation . . . tend to be clearest because the capacities are pressed to the breaking point.”69 For Polito, the problem is voice in modern poetry and the limit case is James Merrill’s The Changing Light at Sandover, published—­all 560 pages of it—­in 1982. By channeling composite, occult voices obtained through his séances at the Ouija board, Merrill’s experiment results in what Polito describes as a “sustained dismantling of a lyric voice.” Sandover makes manifest the language of possession, animism, and ventriloquism shadowing modern theoretical approaches to poetic voice: as something physical, given breath and sound by the poet or reader; as a metaphor for an author’s distinctive style; or as a reductionist cliché equivalent to the self (“no poet has a voice, only voices,” just as no poet has a self, only selves). In so doing, Sandover confounds any normative grasp of the voice in modern poetry while substantiating the uncanny truths on which “the chronic enigma of poetic voice” depends. Virtuosity is a word Polito never uses, but the verbal pyrotechnics of Merrill’s masterpiece, whatever the collaboration with the Ouija board, demand attention to the poet himself and his command of these voices. (Listen to Merrill read some passages aloud and you’ll be struck by how seamlessly the othered words of the dead or of cloned bats dissolve into the poet’s own patrician tones.) Performance is another word that Polito never uses, but it lies at the heart of Laurie Stras’s case study of a song recorded in 1925 by blueswoman and actress Ethel Waters. Entitled “Maybe Not at All,” the song showcases Ethel’s virtuosity as a singer by mimicking the styles of her rivals, Bessie Smith (“Empress of the Blues”) and Clara Smith (“Queen of the Moaners”). Like Polito, Stras is interested in how assuming someone else’s voice destabilizes notions of voice as a marker of authenticity and subjectivity, but she reframes the issue as a measure of the versatility and self-­positioning of the artist. Stras’s essay uses mimicry as her limit case for the idea of self in vocality, specifically mimicry of a celebrity voice familiar through recorded sound that is recognized as belonging to a particular person. Like a sonic signature, a\n\n22\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nfamous voice may possess the capacity to verify and authenticate, and hence can be forged or illegally appropriated (an issue that, Stras notes, has been the target of recent lawsuits claiming copyright over ownership and usage). Vaudeville impressions, however, depend on the audience being in on the game, upon knowing that the voices being heard are not the “real” voice of the singer. Such imitation is therefore meant not to deceive but rather to elicit appreciation for the impressionist’s prowess by exposing “the constructedness of both the model’s vocality and . . . [the singer’s] own.” (Fast-­forward to Tom Gunning’s chapter for the opposite case of a vocal mimicry meant to defraud.) Stras shows how such chameleonic mastery, while troubling the idea of any fixed bonds between voice, body, and authenticity, can paradoxically end up becoming “representative of a single individual’s identity” all the more. “I Am an Essentialist,” proclaims James Davies in the title of his provocative, political chapter—­in quotation marks to show that he is putting on a voice, to drive home the idea, as Stras does, that any voice is to some extent “put on” and cannot simply be hailed as the free, autonomous expression of self. His principal target is the fetishization of “pure” voice—­the holy grail of the voice itself—­in the elite world of opera in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. For Davies, this cult of the voice is epitomized by its sacerdotal priest Pavarotti, who even intones: “My voice is my possessor. . . . I’m the servant of my voice.” Davies’s counterargument is that “vocal aura is less a byproduct of voice’s detachment from the world than an effect of voice’s deep connection to that world.” What makes voices powerful is their ability to inspire “social belief and social belonging.” Whizzing us through a brief history of how the operatic voice has been imaged and imagined since the mid-­nineteenth century, the essay demonstrates that “no straightforward, causal relationship” exists between “the voice” and “the body” (or even individual body parts), because our knowledge and experience of the two is never “natural” but always culturally and socially determined and therefore politically implicated and fraught. Bodies are not just “sculpted by vocal training” but “phenomenologically constructed in voice,” just as the cultivation of a certain type of voice also requires cultivating a certain understanding of embodiment. 4 The four chapters in the next section, as signaled by its heading, “Myth, Gap, Wound,” all confront voice, in one way or another, as fantasy in a Lacanian sense—­as a defensive mechanism supporting the subject’s desire by means of fantasy, which papers it over and, as Brodsky puts it, “lends the world a\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n23\n\nconsistency it wouldn’t otherwise have.” This is the part of the volume that engages most directly with Dolar’s ideas. Two of the contributors even cite the same crucial passage from his book about voice being “a structural illusion, the core of a fantasy that the singing voice might cure the wound inflicted by culture,” with the concomitant disavowal of the fact that voice’s “allegedly miraculous force stems from its being situated in this gap.” Each of the chapters takes a concrete, material case or problem whose exposition enables the author to push Dolar’s arguments in another direction so they might become “something more.” “Is the Voice a Myth?” asks Shane Butler, cleverly playing on several senses of myth in his title. These include something that is reputed to exist but does not, a core cultural narrative with legitimating and explanatory value, and classical mythology as written by Ovid in his great poem the Metamorphoses. Butler’s complex and wide-­ranging essay returns us to the problem of the poet’s voice raised by Polito, but takes us down a path of many twists and turns as befits the essentially recursive nature of both voice and myth. This is why the myth of Echo and Narcissus figures so prominently in Butler’s reading, with Echo rather than Narcissus revealed to be the central figure in the story. Signifying lack as a protagonist, Echo turns out to be the ventriloquized voice of Ovid himself, who calls his poem a “continuous song,” and claims immortality for himself in the final lines: “I shall be read by the mouth of a people,” and so, “I shall live.” Echo’s fate also substantiates Butler’s point that “the truth of myth is revealed only in the retelling,” as he revisits some of the now canonical refractions of classical myths related to voice, language, and the body in Boccaccio, Shakespeare, Freud, Lacan, Derrida, and last but not least, Dolar. Martha Feldman’s chapter reinserts a material substrate of concrete, empirical voices into the psychoanalytic discussion of the gap. But not just any voice. Her subject is the virtuoso singer’s willful deployment of vocal failure, those instances where the voice cracks, strains, or seems to run out of breath at strategic instances in a song. Like Verma, then, Feldman takes on “the extreme voice,” “the voice on edge,” but as a musicologist, the vocal breakdowns that interest her are more subtle and supple. To work, they require a genre with a clear-­cut decorum of good singing and an audience of knowledgeable listeners who will recognize—­and invest in—­the risk-­taking and the vulnerability exposed. Accordingly, she draws her examples from classical bel canto and jazz, culminating in Nina Simone’s indelible recording of an old jazz standard, “I Get Along without You Very Well (Except Sometimes).” Like Davies, Feldman refutes the idea that the virtuoso’s power must be based on a perfect, autonomous voice; rather, she shows how the extreme pleasure a\n\n24\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nfan derives from flashes of masterful imperfection depends on voice being “transactional,” transaction being a process in which singer and listener mutually engage in an attempt to forestall loss. Virtuosic vocal failure points to “gaps in the very status of the voice,” exposing the “messy surplus” and the “in-­betweenness of voice” as something exceeding both language and music, exposing the pull of desire and the impossibility of fulfilling it. Like Feldman, David Levin is interested in exploring the role that vocal failure can play in rendering—­rather than disavowing—­the gap in which Dolar situates voice. Levin’s chapter, however, takes a very different approach by examining the public staging of a singer’s failure and its consequences within the diegetic work of opera. Or, more precisely, within two specific operas. Levin dissects a key scene of staged vocal performance from Zemlinsky’s opera Der Zwerg (The Dwarf, 1919–­1921), in which the Dwarf sings for the Infanta of Spain and is ridiculed by her. This scene he reads dramaturgically as a modernist reframing of the famous singing contest in Wagner’s Die Meistersinger of 1862, in which Beckmesser is bested and humiliated by the hero Walther. Both operas present the singer as grotesque and deformed, the Dwarf physically and Beckmesser symbolically as a “Jew” figured in Wagner’s terms. A key difference, Levin argues, is where the audience is located vis-­à-­vis the failed singer. Whereas in Meistersinger, the audience is primed to embrace Walther as “the Cure to the wound opened up by Beckmesser’s spectacular failure” and to approve Beckmesser’s aggressive expulsion, in Zemlinsky’s opera, the Dwarf, as an outcast and victim, is allowed to elicit the audience’s empathy and induce a modernist understanding that the human subject itself is riven. In other words, the singing voice of the Dwarf doesn’t perform the act of suturing over a wound and restoring loss, but instead serves “as a testament to the inevitability of that loss and the impossibility of that restoration” within opera. The topic (and rhetorical method) of Seth Brodsky’s essay is disavowal itself. “The composer’s voice is the same as nothing,” he says, where “nothing” exists as an absolute value or positive essence. (Think of the Cyclops’s answer “Nobody” to the question “Who blinded you?”) Brodsky returns us to the challenge voice poses to the modernist composer raised earlier by Pierson, but pursues this “voice of modernism” obliquely through the string quartet rather than through sung verse. Proceeding backward through time, his four examples start from Helmut Lachenmann’s Second String Quartet (1989) and Nono’s Fragmente (1979–­1980), then move to Berg’s Lyric Suite (1926), and finally end up with Beethoven’s late quartet, op. 130. Like Levin, Brodsky is interested in the composer’s theatricalization of voice in music, though not as dramatized in an operatic work. Rather, his paradoxical claim is this: The\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n25\n\nmodernist composer’s voice is “fundamentally operatic”. . . . but involves a staging of the impossibility of making something appear . . . an endeavor not simply to make nonappearance appear, but to make it “sing.” 5 Michel Chion—­doyen of theories of voice in cinema—­takes a fresh look at the subject in the playful interlude that follows. Entitled “Vowels/Consonants: The Legend of a ‘Gendered’ (Sexual) Difference Told by Cinema,” his chapter extends ideas originally developed in his recent book Écrit sur L’ecran, first published in French in 2013 and now available in Claudia Gorbman’s English translation as Words on Screen.70 Here he asks: What happens to voice when there is writing onscreen? Are words pronounced by a character in the film or silently sounded out by a spectator in the audience? Or are letters onscreen even vocalizable at all? Specifically, he explores diverse cases in which the screen shows words in languages based on the Latin alphabet, especially when composed of incomplete, fragmented, or scrambled letters. Taking us on a virtuosic adventure through cinematic treatments of the letters A, O, and I, and ending with labial clusters like bud, Chion finds the gendered binaries that film maps onto the distinction between vowels (woman/speech/ song) and consonants (man/writing/words) to be surprisingly durable.71 In all this, he refuses the implicit linguistic uniformity that, in his view, Derrida presumes for writing—­a uniformity that occludes writing’s inherent linguistic plurality, with or without its association with voice. (Indeed, Chion also acknowledges still wider linguistic differences that come with the nonalphabetic system of writing in a cinematic tradition like that of China, which lies outside his empirical domain.) 6 If it seems ironic that our final section, “Technology, Difference, and the Uncanny,” should begin with Sarah Nooter’s chapter on Ancient Greece, we should remember that (as many contend) there is no absolute break between the prerecorded “natural” voice and the technological voice today, no absolute disconnect that “modernity” initiates.72 For Nooter, classical sources from Aristophanes and Pindar to Plato and Aristotle show early glimmerings of the interest in the “vocalic uncanny” that we find in recent technologies, such as Auto-­Tune, Amazon’s Echo, and Apple’s Siri. Like Brodsky, however, she approaches the issue of voice via sound made with musical instruments, rather than voices. Her essay’s most daring and controversial move is to\n\n26\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\npropose substituting the term “musical prosthesis” for “musical instrument.” She proposes that both of her examples, the aulos (an oboe-­like instrument heard as mimicking the human voice) and the salpinx (a kind of war trumpet heard as an invulnerable weapon striking terror in the human heart), be considered prostheses in the sense of being attachments to the mouth and extensions of the breath. As physical attachments, these wind instruments “become part of the human body and adjust its contours.” They can also be considered stand-­ins for the voice because when playing them a musician cannot speak or sing, and because in ancient Greek, voice (phone) is understood as “part of the utterance that comes from the mouth but does not necessarily produce linguistic meaning.” By displacing and “ventriloquizing” the voice while altering its timbre, volume, and projection, these sonic prostheses are invested with an inhuman, uncanny power. This effect is amplified when a human becomes a vocal prosthesis for a god—­that is, a bodily instrument (medium) through which a divine breath is blown, whether in the guise of a priestess serving as a mouthpiece for the prophecies of Apollo, or a poet possessed by the spirit of the Muse. Andrew Jones foregrounds the political relationship between the vocalic uncanny and sound technology in his essay on Vybz Kartel, the Jamaican dancehall music superstar convicted for murder and the self-­styled “Voice of the Jamaican Ghetto.” (The “duppy” in his title is a Caribbean term for “ghost.”) The paradox that grips Jones isn’t the familiar one of how a voice “predicated on its singularity” can “ventriloquize the speech of the multitude,” but rather how the use of an electronically mediated, robotic-­sounding voice affects that claim. In particular, what he’s after is the “ubiquitous creative misuse” of Auto-­Tune pitch-­correction software to distort the voice in genres of black popular music such as dancehall and rap in acts of agency, even political agency (cf. the discussion of Weheliye in part 1 above, and Rings’s point in his chapter about how Auto-­Tune turns mumbled speech into song). In a manner reminiscent of Nooter’s approach, Jones characterizes the Auto-­Tuned voice as hovering on “the border between the organic and prosthetic, the human and not-­quite human,” with Auto-­Tune even being “used as a second-­order instrument for playing the voice.” Like Feldman and like other writers on voices of color, then, he’s interested in the interrelational “in-­ betweenness” of voice and the “transactional” spaces that techniques of deliberate vocal imperfection can open up between singers and their publics. But Jones situates the technological, sonic, and political uses of Auto-­Tune within a specific sonic history of Jamaican postcolonial popular music, including earlier genres like classic reggae and dub. In his examples, culminating in Kartel’s 2009 anthem “Life We Living,” technically induced reverb, echoes,\n\nthe cl a mor of voices\n\n27\n\ngaps, and distortions, combined with lyrics explicitly conjuring past slavery or social inequality in the dehumanized ghetto, turn such songs into haunted spaces and the singer into a medium, “opening channels through which other voices . . . demand to be heard.” Yet within the live combative social space of dancehall, rival deejays can also put Auto-­Tune to more aggressive use, wielding it against one another as “sonic armor” on “diss tracks” to “render the voice of the performer invulnerable to attack.” The uncanny, because missing, voices that concern Jonathan Zwicker belong to kabuki actors. The conundrum his chapter pursues is primarily a historiographical one: the near erasure of voice as a medium from the Japanese history and archives of prewar kabuki theater, at least until very recently. This despite the hundreds of extant SP (78 RPM) records of kabuki plays produced between 1907 and 1945 and evidence that in 1890 the earliest public demonstrations of phonography in Japan showcased a brief recording of kabuki actors. One of the actors on this earliest sound recording, superstar Ichikawa Danjūrō IX, also furnished the kabuki dance performance that is the subject of the oldest surviving Japanese film recording, made in 1899 but, as stipulated, publicly screened only after his death. Zwicker attributes the disproportionate weight that pioneering prewar Japanese theorists, historians, and preservationists gave to image and gesture in their conception of kabuki to the perspective of filmic technology—­specifically to the combined absence of the actor’s voice onscreen and the fantasy of the actor’s presence afforded by the cinematic image, which enabled scholars and critics “to reimagine the visual record of Kabuki’s past as protocinematic.” The ontology of the absent voice started to be understood as a historical problem for kabuki only in the early 1930s, he argues, with the emergence of broadcast radio and talkies alongside phonography, that is, once the mechanically reproduced voice could be reconfigured as “an auditory trace” or remembrance of a moment that had already passed and was now “potentially archivable.” “To whom does a recorded voice belong, to the living or the dead?” This question, posed by Tom Gunning in his chapter on the popular mythology of the technological voice as a source of uncanny terror, is also the central riddle he finds embedded in key films by Roberto Rossellini and Fritz Lang. Gunning addresses it by showing how the rhetoric and fantasies of the technologically mediated voice reveal their role in “merging the psychological and the political, thereby generating both intimacy and terror.” That merging also founds the notorious relationship between the technological voice and the ideology of fascism, with radio as the weapon of choice. For, as he argues, the disembodied, ungraspable, invulnerable voice of broadcast radio (especially once coupled with the playback capacity of sound recording)\n\n28\n\nm a r t h a f e l d m a n a n d j u d i t h t. z e i t l i n\n\nacquires the ghostly ability to breach barriers of time and space at will, to infect listeners and stealthily swap out their voices, to penetrate human bodies and possess them. Gunning traces this fantastic rhetoric backward to the historical emergence of modern technologies of communication in tandem with the nineteenth-­century Spiritualist movement (which reminds us that Merrill’s Ouija board is the planchette’s last parlor-­game remnant). Laterally, he connects this fantastic rhetoric both to its real uses of the all-­powerful, all-­ penetrating radio voice in fascist propaganda and intimidation, and to psychotic fantasies of persecution and surveillance via the “influence machine” and “dissolution of ego boundaries” in psychoanalytic theory. Weaponizing the technological voice may have a precedent in Nooter’s classical prosthetic voice and a descendant in Vybz Kartel’s Auto-­Tuned dancehall voice, but in Gunning’s film examples, the best defense against a vocal weapon is comic debunking, when a voice is shown to be technological and nothing more.

For a far fuller and more analytical appraisal of Dolar’s “qualifications” (or negations) than we can muster here, see Brian Kane, Sound Unseen: Acousmatic Sound in Theory and Practice (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 206–­22. Kane calls these, in philosophical terms, “reductions.” We are indebted to his analysis of them without either endorsing or refuting his assertions about ethical conundrums in Dolar, the theopolitical dimensions of which are also the subject of Jodi Dean, “The Object Next Door” (review of A Voice and Nothing More by Mladen Dolar; The Neighbor: Three Inquiries in Political Theology by Slavoj Žižek, Eric L. Santner, and Kenneth Reinhard [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005]; and The Parallax View by Slavoj Žižek), Political Theory 35, no. 3 (June 2007): 371–­78, at 375. 5. Dolar, A Voice, 4 and passim. 6. For Žižek’s take, see especially Looking Awry: An Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991), as well as many others of his books. Those new to psychoanalytic discourses on voice will want to read the engaging and lucid account of Alice Lagaay, “Sound and Silence: Voice in the History of Psychoanalysis,” e-­pisteme 1, no. 1 (2008): 53–­62. 7. See Dylan Evans, “Desire,” in An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis (London: Routledge, 1996), 36–­39. Evans’s Lacanian abecedarium has an entry for “gaze” but none for “voice,” which, at least for most American and continental audiences, seems to have remained something of an arcane subset of Lacan’s thinking until the publication of Gaze and Voice as Love Objects, ed. Slavoj Žižek and Renata Salecl (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1996), brought out in the same year. 8.
