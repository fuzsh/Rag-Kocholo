        "text": "With the exponential expansion of information technology, it is superfluous to expound the virtues of computers in reproducing and making written works available to large numbers of readers. It is however crucial to understand that such technology is not simply a neutral vehicle for conveying words and messages, for the fundamental reason that language is not primarily about meaning and communication of ideas. It therefore becomes apparent that the complementary acts of reading and writing necessarily involve the material and the subjective (understood in logical terms as Lacan’s subject of the unconscious) dimensions of human existence. We can then see that Computer technology entails the eradication of the material aspect of writing: kept at an incalculable distance behind a screen, the book becomes ‘virtual’. At least two consequences can be observed. Firstly, one can read only the page which appears on the screen, the rest vanishes. Secondly (the ‘Google effect’), we are lead to believe that nothing is forgotten or lost, that everything is immediately available thanks to a search engine. What is lost is the material and tactile aspect of reading and writing: both concern the material and physical trace on the page, that correspond to the original inscribing of the subject’s body into the humanizing world of language. Thus, reading, for example, requires the dialectic movement back and forth through the pages of a physical book, a movement that involves alternation between forgetting and recall, rediscovery and anticipation. The same physical dimension involved in inscribing is called upon in all forms of creation (dance, painting…). Our research thus aims to explore what is at stake for individual liberty and creativity, taking into account the physical – or even carnal dimension – of existence that is systematically evacuated from post-modern approaches. Keywords: Book, Computer, Writing, Psychoanalysis, Memory, Language Stream: Books, Writing and Reading Presentation Type: 30 minute Paper Presentation in English or French Paper: Books and Computer Technology, Books and Computer Technology\n\nIn the 'techno-culture' of present age we have become cyborgs and the realization of this truth has given rise to a critical perspective known as Technocriticism. An application of Technocritical ideas to literary production and studies helps in interrogating the basic concepts of literature such as text, narrative and linearity which is an interesting discourse in contemporary critical theory. Technocritics challenge the Aristotelian concept of literary plot with its linearity and organizational unity in which the reader was passively engaged and privilege the non-linear and non-authoritative hypertext in which the reader becomes a part of virtual reality. Technology has attained an indispensable place in our life today. The use of computer and information technology in the form of software, internet, World Wide Web, email, blog, social sites, e-commerce, e-journals, e-texts and online services has acquired such an important place in our life that nothing remains out of the grip of technology. Computer and digital media based learning has given birth to a new type of electronic text known as Hypertext which is impacting the traditional literary texts to a great extent. Gone are the days when Literature and Technology were considered pole a part things. In the age of Information Technology Revolution, technology has given new direction to literary studies by opening up new avenues to the production and dissemination of literary knowledge. This influence of technology on literary theory is known as TECHNOCRITICISM which offers an altogether new way to read, write, comprehend and think about the textuality of literature. In the 'techno-culture' of present age we have become cyborgs and the realization of this truth has given rise to a critical perspective known as Technocriticism. It is an acceptable fact now that technology has deeply penetrated our culture of which literature is an important"
