Moses has been in the tdp for twelve years now and that too, in ‘the most difficult event of them all: the 400m hurdles.

Supremacy BY forcing an emphatic win, by eight wickets on the eighth day of the eighth month of the year, the West Indies team has established their supremacy as the unofficial world champions. It was a very near black wash for England. So the lion was tamed in her own den by a convincing margin of 4-0.

IT was nice to see Chris Evert moving towards retirement in a graceful manner. First, the marriage to Andy Mill and now, she says that she will play a couple of major tournaments before she retires at the end of this year.

Please come with us.\" The journalists were somewhat perplexed but followed the Amritrajs. Soon, they were in the spacious, spotless main Idtchen of the Taj where tables and chairs had been arranged for the press conference. “Please sit down,” invited Robert Amritraj . “Vijay will be here any moment.” The journalists made themselves comfortable, and looked around them curiously. None of them had ever been inside the main kitchen of a five-star hotel before! “Good morning and welcome, ladies and gentlemen,” boomed the hearty voice of Vijay Cooking For The Indian Amnr Amritraj . The journalists looked around and gasped in surprise. The hero of many of our Davis Cup ties was dressed up as a chef. . .a sparkling apron and a starched chef cap. It took sometime for the journalists to recover from their shock. In the meantime, neatly-turned out waiters put down plates of eatables—dosa. idli, samosa, vada, cutlets, patties, sandwiches, pizsa and a variety of sweets—in front of them. “Ladies and gentleman, please start,\" boomed Vijay as he mounted a small platform specially erected for him. “You will be delighted to know that all these dishes have been cooked by none other than ME, that's vyay Amritraj. Of course, with a little help from brother Anand. We are together in this too,” The journalists looked at each other. Finally, one of them set the ball rolling for the press conference. What follows are excerpts: . “Why are you dressed up like this? Is all this part of a scene for one of your films?” “Certainly not. I’m now a full fledged cook and I am proud of it. I want to exhibit my talents to my friends in the press.” i “But why do you have | to switch over to | cooking? What about | your tennis?” j “My days as a tennis I player are coming to an I end. I feel I can serve my j country better and } longer as a cook.” i \"How are you doing j that?” j “I have volunteered to cook for the Indian army. I will be very happy to begin by cooking for our peace-keeping force xn Sri Lanka. That’s my wife’s covintry.” “What prompted you to volunteer your services as a cook?” “Well, if Bobo, that’s Slobodan Zivojinovic can make news by being called upon to cook for the Yugoslav army, why shouldn’t I do the same for my country? Bobo may be able to thrash me , in straight sets, but as for as gimmicks are conceraed. I’m streets ahead of him.” “But army service is compulsory in Yugoslavia. And Bobo is only 24. You ar^ 35 plus. . .You may not even be accepted as a cook in the army.” “You just wait and see. Our government knows that I had been an unofficiaj ambassador for our country and had even discussed state affairs with George Shultz. I am equally sure tliat my offer would generate lots of media coverage, without which I feel lost.” “Are you sure you can do justice for your new proposed assignment?” Of course. I have been training hard under French chefs. North Indian 'maharajs’and Palgh&t brahmin cooks who are xinrivalled experts. Unlike tennis, cooking does not call for any killer instinct and I am bound to be a great hit.” “Do you think you will be happy in the kitchen?\" “Certainly. Of couine, I have made two conditions. Brother Amritraj will have to be my assistant and papa and mama Amritrag be appointed kitchen supexwisors and public relations officials. And then 1 am ready to start. By the way, how do you find the masala dosas and the pizzas?” FOCUS CRICKET AND CHINAMEN! A LINK BETWEEN CRICKET AND THE MYSTERIOUS ORIENT C ricket has had its roots in China now for nearly 150 years. Although never quite established in the interior, on thb southern periphery the British merchants and sailors based in the port towns of Shanghai and Hong Kong saw to it that the imperial game was well represented. By the Treaty of Nanking, 1842, the island of Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain as a result of the 1st Opium War 1839-™42.The Hong Kong Cricket Club was born in 1851 and exchanged regular cricket tours with Shanghai Cricket Club from 1866. The inter-port rivalry lasted till about 1948 when it appears that there were not sufficient able or keen Englishmen in Shanghai to keep the flag flying. But in the Crown Colony of Hong Kong cricket found a firm base. Regular exchange of visits of teams from Singapore, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), Batavia and Malaya popularised the game in the latter part of the 19th century. Since then cricket in Hong Kong has not looked back. They have been hosts to teams from all over the world. Eminent names like Boycott, Dennis, Amiss, Fletcher (with MCC), Sobers. Nurse (with Jim Swanton’s side), Jaisimha, Baig(^ith Hyderabad Blues) and Graveney (with Worcestershire) among others have paraded their talents at the picturesque setting of Hong Kong's Chater Road ground. Hong Kong however was rather slow to visit the Home of Cricket. That tour materialised only in 1 976 blit once it began there was no holding back. Another visit was undertaken in 1978 and then in 1979 it was to Australia. Gretting a feel of the international exposure at the higher level of competitive cricket Hong Kong did not hesitate to take part in the ICC Trophy of 1982. Such enthusiasm had to bear results and so it did. In 1984 Hong Kong took part in the South East Asian Cup and narrowly lost to Bangladesh, the hosts. Although the people of Chinese origin have never really taken very seriously to cricket it would not be correct to infer that cricket has not been played in China. History has very clearly proved that in the sea ports of southern China there has been a long tradition of cricket especially among the British merchants. Thus when Hong Kong loses its current crown colony status and goes back to China by the end of this century cricket history will no longer be able to disregard the presence of China in the international cricket map. Amazingly, however. China lends its presence I to a cricketing term. Way back in the late 208 ' there appeared in Trinidfitd a stocky left arm spinner of Chinese descent. Ellis Achong by name, popularly referred to as ‘Puss’. Achong was of the orthodox variety and bowled an occasional left-arm wrist spin with the ball curving in to the right-handed batsman. It was this unorthodox delivery on which his fame rests. It transpires that in a Test match he had the well-set RWV Robins stumped as his left-handed leg break went between the legs of the batsman. So baffled was Robins that he blurted out, “Fancy being out to a Chinaman!” Legend has it that ever since the left-hander’s leg break to the right hand batsman has been described as a Chinaman. Thus it fell to Achong to give his forefather’s nationality to a cricketing term. Achong was not only the first of Chinese origin to play in first-class cricket but he also went on to become the first from that race to play in Test cricket. Although remarkably accurate, he did not meet with much success in the 6 Test matches that he took part in, all against England in the 8 308. However his resilience in the 1933 tour of England was noted and he did not forsake the invitation to stay back and enjoy a long lease in the Lancashire Leagues. Later he served as a Test selector. Test umpire and coach. Thus China s contribution to cricket can hardly be ignored. Another player of Chinese extraction who just missed Test selection was yet another Trinidadian, Rupert Tang Choon, a brilliant all-rounder, whom the former West Indies captain Jeff Stollmeyer regarded as among the best players never to have represented the West Indies. Later in 1 978 in India arrived another West Indies cricketer of Chinese origin. He was Herbert Chang. Unfortunately his debut and swansong coincided at Madras. Another Chinese to have come into prominence in Test cricket was the West Indies Test umpire, Douglas Sang Hue. He was destined to rule a batsman out on a particular day and recall him to continue the innings on the following day! It was the Kallicharran incident where the batsman was run out by Tony Greig for having left the crease before the umpire called ‘time*. However the decision was reversed when requests were made that the original appeal, though lawful, was not in accordance with the spirit of the game. Thus it shows that even the rare Chinese has had his share of controversies in this delightful game. ofChnwseorigiii haveMverreiily takm very seriously to cricket, H would notbeceiTecttoinfer thet cricket has not So on August 20'”“ coincidentally the same date as when the first and only cricket match was played at the Olympics in 1900— when Bobby Simpson and Tony Greig, Doug Walters and Rick McCosker tcxik the field at the Peking Sports University Hockey field they wore not the first Test cricketers to play in China but the first Test cricketers to play in Beijing. R«iu Mukherji AUSTRALIAN DIARY Bew Dtjukeis Better Sport to find a way of condensing the multi-syllable name: The Swan Premium Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix. Try saying all that after you’ve grappled a few Swans! And execute me for understatement if you must, but there will be a few beers downed this year. Statistics show that Bond Brewing (Castlemaine and Swan) and Carlton United Breweries (Foster’s) control roughly 90 per cent of the local Australian market. A total of 1 .8 billion (with the b, not the m) litres of beer gurgles down parched Australian throats every year. If it’s per capita figures you’re looking at, each person accounts for 1 1 litres. That explains why the beer barons are so eager to have their brands associated with various sports. Both Bond and Carlton United Brewing are chasing overseas markets as well, which explains why international motor sport is getting richer here in Australia. Meanwhile, there is absolutely no truth in the rumour that winners atop the rostrum will be spraying beer instead of champagne. A n anti-apartheid group has claimed it will disrupt next year’s Australian Open tennis tournament unless South African players are banned from the T he beer drinker, believe it or not, is essential to Australian sport. Not because he plays it. Not because he pays to watch it. Not because he makes up the numbers in the stands. But because the stuff he drinks is what pays the sponsorship bills. There is plenty of beer money in Australian sport, with more zeros than the annual film budget in Bombay. You name the sport; the beer barons have fought each other tooth and nail to get it endorsed. Horse racing. Cricket. Football , not as you and I know it (the natives refer to that, with a sneer, as soccer) but Australian Rules, known locally as ‘footy’. Tennis. Golf. Motor racing. The last named is the gold mine. That is where the beer industry pours (pardon the pun) the major share of its promotional budget. It’s a marketing war zone, where the total stakes are worth an estimated $ 3 billion annually. No, that is not a misprint. It is billions, not millions. The Adelaide Formula One Grand Prix is sponsored by Foster’s Lager and now another beer brand enters the high-speed stakes . Bond Brewing has announced | that one of its popular brands, Swan, will lend its name to motorcycling. Which means that the headline-writers will have Motor racing is the gold mine. That is where the beer in- dustry pours the major share of its promotional budget...meanwhile there is absolutely no truth in the rumour that win- ners will be spraying beer 10 tournament. In January this year, when the tournament moved to Flinders Park from its traditional home of Kooyong, this group made its presence felt. When Pat Cash took the court for his first round match, they threw several black balls onto the court in protest against Cash having played in the South African Open. The protesters (black balls and all) were escorted out, but their cause had received valuable publicity on live television. Now, the group has claimed that Tennis Australia's policy, by which individual South African players are allowed to compete, is nothing more than a joke. The Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement has called for a ban on all players linked to South Africa in any way. Should Tennis Australia fail to comply, the group says it will disrupt the tournament through pickets and other forms of protest. Tennis Australia meanwhile says it will not budge from its original stance, by which individuals are welcome, but teams from South Africa are unacceptable The anti -apartheid group is determined to have its say however, but we’ll have to wait till January to find out whether they have progressed beyond throwing black balls onto centre court. T he cricketing Waughs continue to make the family name famous. Steve Waugh— he of the Indian fan club and the conviction that his twin brother Mark is a better cricketer — has stunned the English with his form for Somerset. Waugh replaced Martin Crowe midway through the season and though he reeled off his thousand runs with fluency, he was overshadowed by the feats of Graeme Hick. A hundred on debut for the county and a total of five big hundreds to his credit, .but Waugh still remains puzzled by all the fuss about his success! The modest New South Welshman merely says with furrowed brow that cricket was the reason he went to England. Yes, he still thinks he can improve further. No, he is not aware that he has rapidly outscored Australian captain Allan Border, who plays for Essex. Yes, he hopes to be back next year. But he won't be the only Waugh play ing cricket in England. Brother Mark, also hoping to break into Australian ranks, will also be completing the formalities of an English cricket contract.

P#: The Don At 80 Sir Donald Bradman celebrated his 80th birthday on August 27. Celebrated cricket writer John Arlott salutes the man considered to be the world’s best batsman and recalls his briUiant career 14 T his MONTH Sir Donald Bradman reached the age of 80. That event was widely celebrated in Australia for he is their cult figure as no English cricketer has ever been in this country-not even W.G. Grace. After all, WG was overshadowed by Queen Victoria. There is no Australian, though, to take the limelight from Donald George Bradman there. He has been saluted in books, films, radio and television programmes to a degree that no other sportsman has known in that country. In fact, he has filled a need for Australia, which cried out for a focal figure. He has also a considerable reputation in England. He came on four tours of this country- in 1930, 1934, 1938 and 1948. On the last occasion he did it again-a century at Worcester to start the tour, and finished top of the batting averages. Figures tell something, but by no means all, about most cricketers. The statistics of Sir Donald’s career, though, are quite remarkable because they show him in that respect far beyond reasonable competition. That is best illustrated by quoting his figures and then those of the next man in the non-race. For instance, he has Test figures of 6996 runs at an average of 99.94. But for that googly of Eric Hollies' at The Oval in 1948 surely Bradman’s Test average would have been over 100. The next comparable average is thatof C.S. Dempster-723 runs at 65.72. In all first-class cricket Bradman scored — — u. Ji./: - .-r 28,067 runs at 95. 14. Next behind him comes Vijay Merchant, 12,876 at 72.74. It has been said that Bradman could not play on bad pitches, and perhaps he was not the sticky- wicket master that, for example. Sir Jack Hobbs was. On the other hand, 1938 was a wet summer in England, yet Bradman averaged 1 15.66 (the first time? anyone had exceeded 1 00 in this country) for his 2429 runs. The next-best average was Walter Hammond-75.27 for 3011 runs- but from 16 more innings. Perhaps most impressively of all. he scored a century roughly once in every three innings (including his first on his debut for New South Wales against South Australia in 1927-28): he reached 1 00 hundreds in his 295th innings; next behind him ?s Denis Compton who achieved it in 552 iniJngs The tactic which was called ‘Bodyline' v/as designed specifically to deal with the threat of Bradman, yet m that 1932-33 series he was still top of the Australian averages with 396 runs in eight innings (he missed one Test) at 56.57. Certainly he was the most infallible punisher of the bad ball the game has ever known. He had, too, virtually all tlie strokes and once, in the Folkestone festival of 1 938 he struck 20-4 6 6 4 6 4--off a single over from Tich Freeman. He had few physical advantages; only 5ft 7ins tall, tests showed that his eyesight was quite normal- though many a bowler would find that hard to believe in view of his spped of reaction. Simply enough, he was an ordinary human being with a capacity for batting that can only be described as phenomenal. As a human being, he was extremely courteous to this writer, willing to discuss the game, fairly certain-with good justification- of the rightness of his own opinion, but often humorous and invariably considerate Once when the two were dinning together, and The Don was actually in that act of drinking soup, a man came up and said ‘Will you sign your autograph in my book?’ Without heat but with more than justifiable irritation Don said ‘Can't you see I am eating?’ The man swung on his heel and walked away muttering, and not pleasantly either. The Don put down his spoon and said ‘Now 1 suppose he will go away and tell his friends what a rude man lam.' Useless to tell him he BiiHoriliakn^«f fikHoKtriUM Oval ill 1948 iimly Budman’slilst avafagaaNwWlMvt bean over too. tlM nextcompaiibte averegebmof €.S.DMipstef^723 ii«iS8t6S.72’ . was perfectly justified; : he knew that; but he w£is j hurt in anticipation of what would be said about him. This is a degree of sensitivity , which it IS difficult to carry at that level of standing. The first Australian i cricketer to be knighted, | he settled in Adelaide-his second ; State, first New South Wales, then South Australia -and achieved all the honours tliat i might come to a cricketer in his country. Chairman of the Australian Cricket Board and the selectors, he also became a highly ! successful businessman. , He proved, too, one of the most penetrative cricket-writers in his i major book onthe game. I The A rt of Cricket . He wisely resisted the * temptation which must ; have been considerable : in financial terms, to go ; far beyond that, and | commit himself to a | no-holds-barred | autobiography. Indeed, more than four times as many books have been i written about him as he | himself has published. j Remarkably for a ! public figure and in Australia, he is virtually ; untouched by scandal . A ! dutiful family man, he * must have been deeply | grieved when his son j found himself unable to j continue under the burden of his father’s name and altered his own to Bradsen. It has all been very exciting; stimulating yet at times a fount of anxiety. If he wei e asked if it was all worth it he would probably answer just a trille ruefully ‘Yes’, and several million Australians, for their part, have no doubt about it. Courtesy VWisrtpn Cricket Mor^lhly | .. NEWS FROM IRE TENNIS WORLD mm How To Use A Racket T ennis rax^kets have been put to all sorts of bizarre use over the years. I remember when a teenaged Tim Mayotte and I took care of an unwanted house visitor For 20 minutes we chased a flying bat with outstreched rackets before Tim nailed the elusive creature with an overhead. In his syndicated “Washington Merry-Go-Round” column, Jack Anderson reports about a more sinister kind of racket. Clever drug smugglers have been hollowing out the handles of wooden tennis rackets and filling them with heroin. Alert Pakistani officials tore apart a shipment of I'OOO rackets bound for Holland and found cocaine in 200 of them. Tommy Htndtey Connors’ Bathroom Rule I F necessity is the mother of invention, Ken Farrar would have preferred that' the need had not been so pressing at the 1983 U.S. Open. Just before his final, with Ivan Lendl. Jimmy Connors alerted Farrar, a Men’s Tennis Council i supervisor of officials, i that he was suffering from a serious case of diarrhoea. There was no ' bathroom procedure then so Farrar decided — with his best Solomonic wisdom — to allow both players to go to the bathroom one time during the course of the match. Sure enough, recalled Farrar, “Early in the second set, Connprs . i yelled out, ‘I got to go, got to go!”’ Connors may have been relieved but Farrar certainly wasn't. “I was the most nervous wreck in the stadium after that. I thought to myself; what happens if Jimmy says he’s got to ! gro again during the match?” Fortunately, Jimbo kept his game and everything else together to notch his fifth U.S. Open singles title. But the bizarre incident and resulting dilemma prompted the historic 1984 Bathroom’ Rule. Thenceforth, when nature is calling, the rule says players would be allowed to dash from court to bathroom once during bestof-three-sets matches and twice during best-of-five-sets matches. You can look it up. % 'j ’‘y f-rf .»*»“<WSf^: ,.;> I |«.

Since the 1st Indira Gandhi International Hockey Tournament for men in early 1987, Play makers had been bailing out the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) during financial crises. Their latest good Samaritan act was the India-Pakistan hockey series. Since Partition, there have been three Indo-Pak hockey series in 1978, 1981 and 1986. However, the 1988 series was the first one to be sponsored. The sponsorship terms were generous. The contract signed on May 1 1 , indicated that Playmakers would sponsor the Indian leg (three tests and an exhibition tie at Agra) of the hockey series for Rs. 10.75 lakhs. For the IHF it was a financial bonanza. Their share of the bargain was just travel expenses of both teams and the neutral umpires C. Madden of Scotland and Sakeida of Japan and pcx?ket money to the players. The state associations which hosted the test matches, the Delhi Hockey Association, The Lucknow Sports Association and the Railway Sports Control Board (RSCB) at Gwalior bore the expenses of boarpl and lodging of the teams and umpires SS during matches. The IHF received Rs. 1 .25 lakhs as advance money from Playmakers. The remainder was to be paid in allotments after each test match. However, the IHF fumbled in fulfilling the duties assigned to them in the contract and this led to a controversy. Two major duties the IHF did not fulfill. The sponsors and their corporate supporters Sahara India had all the stadia advertising rights in all stadia. Also the logo and name of Playmakers and Sahara India was to be prominently displayed on all publicity material. The IHF faltered on both issues, due to lack of co-ordination with the state units. Satish Dayal, managing director of Playmakers takes up the story. “Prior to the Delhi test, 1 noticed violations of the contract. Our names and logos were not used in any of the banners, tickets or advertisements in newspapers. The Delhi Hockey Association also made their own bargain with a cold drinks firm and Vampire tracksuits. Taking advantage of live coverage on television, the cold drinks firm prominently displayed their trolley and provided hats and jersies for the umpires. The ball pickers wore Vampire tracksuits. According to the contract, such publicity avenues were reserved for us and Sahara India. I wrote two letters to the IHF, the day before the match and on the afternoon of the match (July 30) but of no avail.\" Not only did the IHF' and DHA not respond to the sponsor’s pleas, they humiliated them as regards distribution of passes. On the morning of the match, after much cajoling, just a dozen passes were given to Playmakers and Sahara. The prior agreement was that the sponsors would get 200 passes in different sections of the stadium. In protest Satish Dayal boycotted the Delhi test match. In the exhibition match at Agra on August 3 another acrimonius dispute arose. It had been decided that the Indian team would play in a new sponsored kit, provided by Sahara India. The kit would have the India colours but the name Sahara would be written boldly at the back. Sahara made 21 new shirts, shorts, stockings and track-suits. When the kit was delivered to the Indian team, Sahara were curtly told by the manager Jhaman Lai Sharma that as there was no clearance by the IHF, the national team could not wear a sponsor’s jersey. Satish Dayal tried in vain to plead with Jhaman Lai Sharma and even showed him the letter of the agreement. The Indian hockey players were the real losers / Indim skipper Soimyya introduces Jagbir Singh to Mrs. Alva It had been decided that the Indian team would play in a new sponMredkit When the kit was delivered to the Indian team, Sahara were curdy told that as there was no clearance by the IHF, the national team could not wear a sponsored jersey in spite of the letter of agreement. again.\" As a result of all these misdemeanours. Playmakers have given an additional amount of Rs five lakhs only. So the total sponsorship deal is now just worth Rs 6.25 lakhs, a loss of Rs4,50 lakhs. IHF president Shri H Prasad pleaded helplessness at this lack of co-ordination. He said. \"We wrote a letter to all state associations on July 5, informing them about the terms of the deal. They chose to ignore it.\" If so, it is a characteristic case of “things fall apart, the centre cannot hold. \" The lack of rapport between 'fhe Sahara trophy caused controversy in the fourth and final test match at Gwalior. The IHF treasurer P. Govindan had unveiled the Sahara trophy at Lucknow and said it would be awarded to the winners ol the Indian leg. During the interval of the Gwalior test, Minister of State for Railways, Shri Madhavrao Scindia was asked to give away the trophy. Brig. Atif who headed the Pakistan contingent overheard this and objected to the award on the pi^emise that the IHF had failed to inform the visitors. So the trophies were displayed but not awarded. The winners trophy, worth Rs. 16,000, donated by Sahara still remains in the custody of the IHF. At Gwalior, the IHF representative Gufran-e-Aza.m, told the? sponsors that the trophy would be taken and awarded in Pakistan. However this was not done. Both Sahara and Playmakers were upset at the nondistribution of the trophy. Satish Dayal said, \"This was an insult to our prestige. We will not deal with the IHF the IHF and the affiliated state units is an ominous piortent. More was expected fi oin R. Prasad and his team But then of late the IHF seems to have a way of getting on the wrong side of sponsors. Novy Kapadfa, New Delhi OLYMPIC SELECTION Sebastian Coe: Kicked In Ike Teeth? No. Had Sebastian Coe been put on the plane to Korea, says Mike Walters, we might have been forced to watch him trundle home behind athletes who would not have been fit to spike his shoes a few years back. As it is now, Coe’s dignity will be intact forever... O NE of the most vivid sporting pictures I can recall of this decade (or any decade, for that matter) is of Sebastian Coe winning the 1 ,500 metres in the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Beaten, surprisingly, into second place in the 800 metres by his arch-rival, Steve Ovett, six days earlier, this was arguably the most satisfying win of Coe’s career. And his expression as he hit the tape in Moscow remains one of the most heartwarming freeeze-frame photographs any camera can have captured. Sebastian Coe’s digni^ will be intact for ever. His omission from the squad for Seoul unll enable us to remember him as the man who showed the rest a clean pair of heels in .Moscow and Los Angeles... 22 Arms spread wide in triumph, eyes cast heavenwards in a thrilling mixture of ecstasy and relief, Coe's joy was the perfect illustration of the Olympic movement’s attraction. Four years later, in Los Angeles, he was at it again, leaving a daunting, world-cla^ field for dead in far-from-ideal conditions (searing heat in a city infamous for its pollution and humidity). This time, Coe permitted himself a little gesture at the assembled Press throng, as if to say: “Who’s a clever boy, then?” or ‘Tm still No 1 .” Both remarks, if they were, indeed, what he uttered, were singularly appropriate. It therefore seems almost unthinkable tliat we will not be treated to such gesticulations in Seoul this year following the circus that masqueraded as Great Britain’s 1988 Olympic selection process. The British Amateur Athletic Board’s powers-that-be, in their wisdom, decided that Olympic trials would be held and, similar to the system which has served the United States so well down the years on the track and field, selections would be based rigidly on a “first two past the post” basis. The third permitted slot in each event, it was decided, would be allocated to a “deserving” case — normally the man (or woman) with the fastest time over that distance to date this year. Coe was an outspoken critic of this selection process tram the outset. So was his middle^stanpe rival and fellow medal hopeful , Steve Cram. Ilie double Olympic champion, chasing a unique hat-trick of golds over 1 ,500 metres, chose to do the decent thing and put his reputation on the line at the trials. This was despite a series of nagging injuries and viral infections which had forced him to flee to the Swiss Alps for a sustained period of altitude training in rarefied mountain air. With Cram already almost certain to take the “deserving” case slot over 1 ,500 metres after his spectacular win in the Oslo Dream Mile earlier in the summer, it was imperative that Coe should finish in the top two at the trials if he was to book his ticket to Seoul. His semi-final heat, however, was a disaster. Coe trailed in fourth. The disconsolate figure which stood, hands on hips and head bowed, at the end of that race was a depressingly far cry fiom the man steeped in glory at the two previous Olympics. “I wanted to ‘kick’ off the bend over the last 200 metres, but there was nothing there,” explained Coe afterwards. “I don’t understand it. Altitude training had been going very much according to plan.” Coe spent a miserable weekend knowing— barring a sudden change of heart by the selectors — his Olympic career was over. The team announced on the Monday morning realised his worst fears. His father, coach and Steve Cram: deserving case mentor, Peter Coe, offered an indignant swipe at the selectors. “My son’s been kicked in the teeth he groaned, “People have been queueing up to knock him down. Now they’ve got their way, I hope His father, coach and mentor, Peter Coe, offered an indignant swipe at the selectors. \"My son’s been kicked in the teeth,” he groaned. Those comments were unfortunately those of a man whose heart was ruling his head they are satisfied.” Those comments were unfortunately those of a man whose heart was ruling his head. The sad truth of the matter is that Coe’s fastest time over 1 ,500 metres this year would not have even been sufficient to qualify for the final in Los Angeles. Kicked in the teeth? Coe shot himself in the foot, I would say. By risking his reputation in the trials, he left himself open only to disappointment in the event of an apocalyptic run — like the one he produced in Birmingham in the semi-final heat. A national newspaper organised a phone-in survey to discover the depth of public opinion on Coe’s omission from the Great Britain squad. Some 30,000 phoned in to say they thought Coe should go to Seoul; only 7,000 said he would be better off staying at home. The “Coe Must Go” bandwagon has thus amassed considerable momentum — though not, significantly, among his fellow athletes. Ed Moses, the American who has dominated the 400 metres hurdles event for a decade or more, says: “An Olympic champion has no divine right to defend his title.” When Peter Coe stops searching fruitlessly for scapegoat-hunters and cuts out lines about Seb being “stripped of his dignity,” he should come to realise his son’s dignity is, in fact, very much intact. Sebastian Coe’s dignity will be intact for ever. His omission from the squad for Seoul will enable us to remember him as the man who showed the rest a clean pair of heels in Moscow and Los Angeles. Had we put him on the plane to Korea, we might have been forced to watch Coe trundle home behind athletes who would not have been fit to spike his shoes a few years back. Seoul might have proved one Olympic tournament too many for him. As it is, he will always be able to talk of being denied that gold medal hat-trick by the selectors— rather than the man who failed, apologetically, to complete it. And ril be able to remember that marvellous sporting image of his Moscow Gold and whistle the theme music to Chariots of Fire to myself as I do so... instead of the Funeral March. T P continue from where we left off last we^, let us just run throug^h the points once again. We had discussed how tieonard Ofoss (himself hn author of a book on fitness) had approached .i)r Laurence E, Morehouse (also an author and respected authority in the field of fitness) to get some tips on how to improve his tennis. While Morehouse had chalked out some ground rules in his training, he also laid down a series of performance maxims that he called ‘Super Ks’ Applicable to any sport, at any level we play, th^ ‘Super Ks’, or the kinesiological secrets used by champions, are the basis of everything we do. Last week we had run tlfrough the first three; .l^seasmucb of your fxxiy in the motion as tlw play allows. Move ycmr oen ter of gravity and Oive each force in a movement enough time to peak. While the first one requires you to get yovur whole body into the . stroke, the second asks you to rotate your hips to gather extra force. The third 'Super K' tells us to let esich movement mature before passing on the momentum to the next part of jrour body. . What we’re basically looking for is an axtitiisitely timed chain . ration. Let’s run through the nextseven: 4) Take a windup that piits your muscles on a Wretch: Just like you can’t shoot a rubber band without stretching it first, you have to turn your back- - thereby stretching the back muectes-' to give your strcdce mcn^ power. 5) St&bilize supporting assents: Think of your trunk as the body framework and use the arms and legs in a whip-like manner. 6) Letyourbead control your movements: The head and neck are the control center for the body's skill motions. That’s why you have to keep your head steady and keep your eyes on the ball at all times. Move your head up and your body will follow. The result: a jerky shot. 7) Keep your body relaxed but together: There is a difference in relaxation in action and relaxation in repose. You’ve got to find the correct stage wh^ you’re tight enough to play but relaxed enough to think clearly. 8) Keep a tight grip: Try it. You’ll immediately notice the extra power that you get. YouTl also fael Uie pain that creeps into your wrist and foresu'm. You’ve got to be strong to maintain this tight , grip. 0) Finish the stroke; The last third of the stroke. . .that’s what sets the novice apart from the expert. Try and lit'-' ,Si complete the full range the stroke. 10) Stay aa low OB you can, consistent with yoursport.-'Vfe all tend to sway from side to side. Please make sure you’re not swasdng one way when the ball is beaded in the other direction. Try and keep your weight on deeui center with the knees slighUybent.

It s time you got admured R acket SPORTS, as a rule, don't tax the body to its titmbst. Sure it keeps you reasonably fit. but it doesn’t require as much aerobic capacity as running, it doesn’t require as much fiexibility as aerobics or as much strength as weight training. The problem with most of us fitness buffs is that every time we decide to ‘get fit’, we pull on a pair of sneakers and start jogging. That’s okay if stamma is all we’re looking for but if you re trying to get fit for any particular sport, then jogging isn’t going to do the trick. You’ve got to train withspaoi^,ty ha miiul The best wt^ to train for any Import, especially; racket |qiort8,'i8 to engage in movemeids specific to that event, fbr . a period of time equal to the tiipe you expert to play, and in the same mode and speed as those you’ll use when you . play. Another variable in determining how much you have to train is your quality of play. The better you are, the fitter , yoiihaveto be. . .obviously. But if you’re working your ,. way up, you’ve got to , determine for yourself how much is needed- Look at the mirror: if you like what you see ' there, then you’re not I doing too badly . Assuming that you’re reasonably fit, racket sports require two types of endurance. Muscle endurance to keep the legs moving; the muscles contracting time and again.

I’heir match-play was never above avei'age. often below And Dutta always had that cringy feeling of being pelted while •sitting with the reserves on t he sideline So he eho.se to sit behind the goal during the home team’s match against Tollygunge Agragami. The trouble with Dutta is that he gets fidgety the moment his team performs shabbily and constantly shouts at his players. It isn’t particulaily distracting shouting instructions from the sideline, but to indulge in it from behind the goal does call for a word of caution. He did exactly that and this distracted the Agragami players. He was hauled up by the IFA after the league subcommittee found him guilty on a c-om plaint made by the opposing club. Amal Dutta confessed that he felt insecure on the sideline and was therefore compelled to sit behind the goal Seci-etary Prodyut Dutta cautioned him and asked him to sit with his players on the BNR keeper Tai'un Dutta clears a Krishnendu Roy header. East Bengal won 2-0 sideline only. Humiliating, without a doubt. Embarrassed, he sta.yed home for Mohammedan SC’s return league match against, Taltolla Ekata Shangha. whohad shocked Mohun Bagan earlier. There was as a result some relief as no one shouted instructions. The team played better and scored twice. Senior players complain that Dutta insists on playing the juniors. With Dutta absent that day Jamshed was fielded. The Iranian was (yet again) a mere passenger, and it was only when Ranjit Karmakar came in his place that the attack sharpened. Ranjit, Chibuzor and Sandip Munshi played with purpose and speed endangering the rival citadel. Ekata finally fell when Sandip Munshi latched on to a precise Sunirmal Chakraborty through and scored. Six minutes later Karmakar increased the margin after gaining control , entering the box, playing a bout of wall passing with Chibuzor, forcing the goalkeeper Partho Chakraborty to leave his guard, and finally beating the keeper. After Mohun Bagan’s triumph over Mohd. SC, Prasanta Banerjee had said that this was the turning point in the league — which is wide open. He very nearly was made to eat his own Photographs by Santosh Ghosh words when Bagan was trailing by a Pradip Saha goal for 52 minutes in their tie against Railway FC. Not that Bagan were lackadiasical in their approach —they only tailed to score inspite of excessive territorial dominance. The goal had shaken them and for the last 18 minutes the RFC defence was reeling under continuous pressure. Subrata Bhattacharya joined the forwards to good effect. Satyajit Chatterjee equalised and Pranab Mondal scored five minutes from time to grab full points. Sisir Ghosh down on his knees in disgust after squandering a fine chance against Railway FC Against Sonali Sibir Sisir Ghosh missed a hat-trick. Bagan fielded a depleted side as a few key players were absent Achintya Belel was forced to sit on the bench after a couple of bookings; Saibal Chatterjee was on office assignment; Satyajit Ghosh had some household errands; Debashis Ray was playing truant and Prasanta chose not to play. The home team performed quite creditably all the same. Medios Amalraj and Satyajit Chatterjee Ux)k a lot of workload and helped the frontline to cripple the Sonali defence, finally winning 2 - 0 . The way East Bengal played against Bengal-Nagpur Railway It looked as though they weren’t particularly enthusiastic about winning. However, they did finally win— Uttam Mukherjee scoring ten minutes from time. When nothing was working upfront Tarun Dey w£ts asked to join the attack. The home side’s frontline was weakened due to the absence of Pradip Talukdar and Kai’tick Sett (both booked twice). Bikash Panji was quite indifferent in the first session but came back strongly into the game as it went on. This, in fact, was the tu/ming point of the game. It was, in fact, Panji who did the spadework for the goal. One may recall that East Bengal beat Kidderpore thanks to a penalty in the dying minutes of the game in their first appt?arance. But in the return tie the visitors went down 0-2 after holding the defending champions till the interval. From the start of the league East Bengal have been lethal from the right. But that aspect was missing against Kidderpore. Talukdar was off colour and Kartick Sett was only juggling with the ball. The rival defence looked comfortable and in control. Sett’s unforgiving error was when he kicked the ball straight into the hands of the keeper after a perfect pass, courtsey Panji. But-Sett calmed the agitated fans when he pushed the ball past the stopper and keeper into the net off an Uttam Mukherjee centre. Sett also paved the way for Panji to score the next goal. The goals came after a reshuffle in the midfield; Krishnendu Roy making the difference. Kidderpiore too came close to scoring, but Tanumoy Bose was efficient under the bar.

CONTEMPORARY ATHLETICS STARRING... CARL LEWIS * SERGEI BUBKA ★ SAID AOUITA * INGRID KRISTIANSEN -K T he stars make the sport. That’s irre- futable 'fhe names Bradman, Sobers, Gavaskar are synony- mous with criuket Pele, Maradona, Platini do the same for soccer With boxing it's Dempsey, Ali and Tyson. And with tennis you don’t have to look beyond McEnroe, Connors and Becker. . These men arc all win- ners . with a little extra. They inject their sport with a certain aura. A certain glamour. They- and the magic they weave into their chosen discipline — are some- times more important than their game itself. Athletics is no diffe- rent. While steadily im- proving world records and live television cover- age have gone a long way in dragging this sport out of the shadows of obscurity, the major credit has to go to the stars. They have — through themselves and their feats — created an image for the sport. An image that has lifted athletics into the same hallowed stratosphere as the one inhabited by cricket, soccer, boxing and tennis. Many have achieved star status. Names like Jesse Owens, Emil Zatopek, Lasse Viren, Marita Koch, spring to mind. They have all done their share of win- ning... and their share of upliftment for the sport. Now is the time of 48 1 people like Daley Thompson, Edwin Moses, Carl Lewis, Sergei Bubka. Said Aouita, Ingrid Kristian* sen. Jackie Joyner- Kersee. Now is the time of the super star. While the stars of old kept their fan following enthralled with their performances on the track, today’s star status asks more of the indi- vidual Not only do you have to be a winner. you Ve also got to project invincibility More im- portant, you’ve got to give your event some character. Imagine the decathlon without the cherubic smile of Daley Thomp- son. You’d have Sigfried Wentz. Jurgen Hingsen, Torsten Voss... all great athletes, all deserving champions. But, oh. so mechanically boring. It’s the distinctive Thompson flavour that ACKIEIOYNER-KERSEE DALEY THOMPSON ifEDWIN MOSES I makes the decathlon the attention-grabber that it is. His infectious exuber- ance. flis competitive attitude. And, of course, his domination of the event. All combine to make Daley Thompson as important as the de- cathlon itself, to assert his position as a star. Till Edwin Moses started his reign, the 400m hurdles was an ' almost unknown event. Now, 12 years later, this event is one of the most talked about races at any athletic meet. His 10- year unbeaten streak ..his steady im- provement over the dis- tance. his holding off the ever-mounting chal- lenge of Danny Harris They have— through themselves and their feats-created an image for the sport. An image that has lifted athletics into the same hallowed stratosphere as the one inhabrtedhy cricket, soccer, boxing and tennis and Harald Schmid Any of these are enough to give him star status. Said Aouita’s strangle- hold over the middle and long distance races. Sergei Bubka’s lonely reign at the dizzy height of 6 metres and over in the pole vault Ingrid Kristiansen’s voracious appetite tor running long distances fast. Jackie Joyner-Kersee’s superb all-round excell- ence that gives her top spot in the heptathlon. Carl liewis of the multi- faceted talents on the tartan trac^k All these people have engraved their names on the win- ners' list. They have done it so often, and with so much confi- dence. They are not merely winners. But much more than that All these athletes have the ability to draw crowds merely by beiriK* there. Not only are they worshipped in their re- spective countries ^ Morocco has made ‘Aouita a synonym for anything fast, including the Rabat to Casablanca express train— they are recognised by people all over the world as the last word in their chosen events Their participa- tion makes news Their winning -although ex- pected —makes news I Their losing makes the headlines That, truly, is the hallmark of a star Perhaps the lx‘st way All these athletes have the ability to draw crowds merely by being there.

And the Eighties, when Carl Lewis made millions of dollars, after winning- four Olympic gold medals at the IjOs A ngeles Olympics. 1^84. The contrast is amazing. The present ora of athletics has a completely different image to that of the past Athletics today, especially the champions, earn thousands of dollars in prize money and even higher amounts in endorsements and sponsorships Carl Lewis is a millionaire today. So also is Daley Thompson and Edwin Moses. Ever since the IOC decided that an athlete can earn or be paid money provided that it is hold in a trust by the national federations, the top echelon has been reaping their i-ewards. Today, with events being telecast worldwide, companies like Sony, Honda and Seiko have realised that they can get tremendous mileage if their product names are pinned on the athletes’ vest. Suddeny . athletics is going the tennis way: with managers and agents to look after their considerate income. With the increased monetary rewards has come a tremendous pressure to be successful. Because success equals mileage which translates into money. They will be interviewed on television, in magazines; Inteniationaf athletics has become topsytur^.

Sm 57 Doping: A Permanent Problem DOPING: the use of a product that artificially develops the performance of an individual. W HY, only recently, during the US Olympic trials a few athletes failed the drug test. Officials of the US Olympic Committee and the National Governing Body, while refusing to name the competitors, however, “confirmed the positive laboratory tests for substances banned by the IOC.” The unfair use of stimulants, as such, is nothing new. We can read in the Greek myths that the athletes of the ancient Olympic Games used to take stimulating tonics in order to improve their performance. In modern time, since the first decade of the century, there are many notable, yet isolated cases of doping, especially with strychnine, as no controls were effected. Only if a fraud wes caught in the act, a lenient punishment was meted out. Until 1960, doping in the track-and'field events remained a virtual taboo, that was treated with endless precautions. Whereas in other sports, particularly in cycling, stimulating and analgesic tonics were commonly used. Everything started in the Sixties. I remember having written on this subject for the very first time in L'Equipe after SixyiMN*ti onaofllM lETMtestditeiit mrowoni oi wm SUvrotteTfliad aiitlioritfdM iofNiMiiiimi ^tDlMTcront OfflN CilMIUHvlUI WM dOpilH MMiiiofir the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, when certain ^eat champions who were still actively competing, made some personal disclosures to me. This was how I got to know that steroids and anabolics, (synthetic hormones developed by chemical engineers and pharmacologists during the war in order to “reconstitute” the forces of the injured American soldiers and to enable them to put on weight quickly) had come into vogue of track-and-field competitions. Their usage coincided with a rapid progression in the performances, particularly in men’s shot-putting, later in women’s shot-putting: the people’s democracies did not waste any time to copy the Americans. When I first mentioned this subject to Adriaan Paulen, the then president of the European Committee, I encountered incredulous amazement. According to the officials, the reported i facts were only based on mere g^iess work. It was necessary that certain champions fully confirmed our assertions, to make the I AAF take this danger under consideration. But the evil had already arrived. Slowly, but surely, it spread to all the continents, fortunately not everywhere as quickly as in weight-lifting. Here, several scandals had forced the International Olympic Committee to be interested in the , problem since 1967. And ; on interventions by [ famous specialists, the I lAAF and the IOC threw I themselves into a I difficult and courageous I battle, that had, as its I first result, some I semi-official controls -effect since 1968. However, in a very bmited manner. At the instigation of Avery Brundage, a nedical commission of ^ he IOC was created in 967 , the chair of which as entrusted to the rince de Merode. He is ill its “patron”, irrounded by a team of illiant scholars and perts, and of these a w (especially Beckett id Donicke) have stood ) for the sake of ack-and-field. Yet, the edical commission oked a lot of sarcastic actions at the I ginning of its ' Livities. It was realized dt they used a sword rhout a blade, and that nothing could be prevented. Only the officialization of the controls, for which it was up to the lA AF to pave the way , allowed the rapid elimination of the use of stimulating and analgesic tonics, that were easy detectable. Since 1970, it was possible to detect steroids and anabolics in urine, owing to more sophisticated methods. The first cases of disqualification, that hit top men and women athletes, clearly proved that there was a kind of doping-proliferation that was always ‘one step ahead’, when compared to the means that the lAAF and the IOC disposed off. It was necessary to push the relevant efforts, to invest a considerable amount of money, to make official numerous laboratories, to associate world-renowned doctors and chemical engineers in order to try and ward off a danger. Around 1975-76, all the officials, doctors and coaches knew exactly where they stood. Six years ago, one of the greatest discus throwers of all time, the American Jay Silvester, had authorised me to publish one of his statements; “101 per cent of all the great champions use doping methods!” However, since that time the lAAF-controls prevented, in a satisfactory way, the usage of anabolics Still, at the same time natural hormones appeared on I the mai’ket : above all . testosterone, a man’s hormone with the same qualities like the steroids, but more difficult to detect. More than one Olympiad had to go by until it was possible to put these products on the foi’bidden list. And yet, the cortico-steroids appeared, then the somatotrophic hormones, the betablockers, (that were used without punishment until 1984) let alone the blood transfusions (the method which the specialists suppose today, might cause Aids). It is necessaiy to do justice to the lA AF and to its directors. First of Ed Moses with Dr Gatlin, director of anti-doping control In the US all to Adriaan Paulen, ex-president of the lAAF, and then to his successor Primo Nebiolo They started a campaign with perseverance and determination for they knew that the unity of sport v/as at stake. The IOC has played its part in this campaign, as well: from 1978 president Killanin was forced to admit that “doping is the most harmful danger in sport and it is much more difficult to combat than all political and financial problems together. ” Since 1984, a few countries like Norway and Great Britain had introduced a concept, permanent spot checks, even during training periods. According to us, this is the only way to stop all attempts at wild doping In Great BriUm, there are many athK tcs who went in volunt;*rily for such a method. This can only be applied to all member countries by an unconditional convention and with a neutral panel of judges. It IS easy to imagine the difficulties still to surmount until such an “institution\" is cieated But today . the 2 AAF holds important trumps to reinstall orde- within its organization and to prevent new problems, although it is cle;’ r that there are still ma ly abuses and many offenders. Thus, it is vital to simultaneously warn athletes against doping, to punish offenders, to inform on the negative results and to take drastic measures wherever necessary.
