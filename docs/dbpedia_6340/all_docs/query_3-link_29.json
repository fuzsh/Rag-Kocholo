The necessity of creation of such a work is con- ditioned by the numerous circumstances. First of all we have to emphasize the fact, that permanent aspiration of the Russian State to tear from Georgia its North- West part has already been the reason of the politization of history of that latter for already more than one century and consequently the brute falsification of the historical past of Abkhazia and together with it of the whole Western Georgia. Namely, at the beginning of the 20 th cen- tury on the soil of the falsificated history under the slogan \"Abkhazia is not Georgia\" was formed Apsua- Abkhazian political separatism- one of the verities of the Russian imperi- alism and its foothold in Georgia. The affair took a dramatic turn, as the non- legislative regime existing today in Abkhazia and its protectors in the person of the highest Heads of the Russian Federation announce the \"historical rights\" together with the\" people's will\", as the basis for the statehood independency of the ancient Georgian region\". With the aim of protection of the mentioned \" historical rights\" separatistically predisposed authors (S. Lakoba, O. Bgazhba. V. Chirikba, M. Gunba, E. Ajinjal, D. Dbar, etc), published tens of tendentious works in the Russian and English languages. Unfortunately, the separatists pursue and serve the illusory and rather dangerous political aims and not the scientific ones. The false historiography is under a special attention and protection of the Separatist Regime as well as the Highest Political Leadership of Russia. In the Soviet epoch studying and analyzing of the issues from the ancient history of Abkhazia, was practically forbidden for the Georgian historians and they had to defend themselves from the falsifiers of History. From the end of the 80-ies of the 20\" 1 cen- tury a number of interesting and significant work on the History of Abkhazia was pub- lished, the authors of which are: M. Lordkipanidze, T. Gamkrelidze, D. Muskhelishvili, T. Mibchuani, G. Gasviani, M. Inadze, E. Khoshtaria-Brosse, N. Lomouri, L. Toidze, A. Menteshashvili, Z. Papaskiri, T. Phutkaradze, G. Kalandia, J. Anchabadze, D. Chitaia, N. Berulava, B. Kudava, T. Koridze, L. Akhaladze, M. Baramidze, S. Bakhia-Okruashvili, T. Beradze, L. Bitadze, T. Gvantseladze, I. Gelenava, B. Gogia, K. Okujava, B. Khorava, D. Jojua and others. But, it is obvious, that the Georgian historiography has not yet worked out a single and whole approach towards the main problem: The negative influence of the Soviet historiography is not yet overcome during the study of such problems, as ethno political history of the Colkhis (Egrisi) Kingdom of the before the antique and especially antique periods, ethno genesis of the Georgian and Abkhazian people etc. This from its side, af- fects the comprehension of other important issues from the history of the region of the further period. This work being offered to the attention of the public is the translation of the same title books, being published in 2007 in Tbilisi in the Georgian language and 2009 in the Russian Language. In certain parts it is remade. The aim of the authors guiding with the integral, conceptual approach to the analyzed important problems is spotlighting of the ethno political history of the territory of modern Abkhazia (and not only Abkhazia, the borders of which did not always coincided with the modern ones), well-grounded refuta- tions of the conclusions of the separatist- falsifiers. The main arguments are the Georgian and foreign historical sources. The book is crammed full with the information from those 3 sources. One of the peculiarities of the study is that it has a complex character. In the book are used the newest scientific achievements of the historians and archeologists, special- ists of the historical geography, church architecture and the anthropologists, linguists, ethnologists and demographists. This work does not have and cannot have anything in common with working out the current policy and problems of defining the future status of Abkhazia. The aim of the present work is restoring of the historical truth. Though, the views and opinions of the Georgian and Abkhazian historians on this stage are incompatible, the authors of the book are ready for collaboration with the Abkhazian colleagues. The authors of the book thank for the advice and kind wishes Academician Mari- am Lordkipanidze, professors: Otar Zhordania, Vakhtang Japaridze, Geronti Gasviani, Gela Saitidze, Ioseb Chikava, Zurab Papaskiri, David Chitaia, Murman Papashvili, Igor Kveselava, Givi Rogava and others. We express our gratitude for the highly qualified professional help in preparing the book to the doctor of historical sciences: Khvicha Kardava and Nana Gogia, Nana Kvar- atskelia, Dinara Darsalia, David Zhvania, Salome Gamakharia and Sophia Gamakharia. The present work can be used as the additional text-book at the Universities and Insti- tutes in teaching the course of the Georgian history, political science, geopolitics, conflict resolution studies and other educational courses. 4 Chapter I. The Brief Historical-Geographical Review One of the corners of our country, the Autonomous Republic of Georgia - Abkhazia is located in the North- West part of Georgia, on the banks of the Black Sea, between the rivers Inguri and Psou. The river Psou and the main watershed range of the Caucasus separates the republic from Russian Federation and the river Inguri and spurs of the Big Caucasus - Kodori and Abkhazian-Svanetian ranges from the neighboring Georgian regions - Svaneti and Same- grelo. The area of Abkhazia equals 8, 7 thousand square kilometers, which comprises 13% of all the territory of Georgia. The capital of the Autonomous Republic Sokhumi is one of the most ancient and famous Georgian towns. Toponyme Sokhumi derives from the Georgian word Tskhomi/Tskhumi and means beech. In the ancient Greek sources (Pseu- do-Skilak of Kariand- IV centuries B. C. ) it is mentioned as Dioskuria. According to the antique traditions this name originates from the mythical Dioskures. Dioskures- Greek Dioskurio, (exactly - sons of Zeus) - twin brothers Kastor and Polidevkes (Polluks). It was believed that, the town was established by the coach-men of the Dioskures, the Argo- nauts Telkius and Amphyst. But, the names of the town must be the Greek comprehension of the old Georgian word combination. It is significant, that \"dia\" in several dialects of the Georgian language and among them in Megrelian means mother and \"Skuri\" means wa- ter. The Romans in the I century B.C. renamed the town into Sebastopol in honor of The Roman emperor Gai Octavian Augustus (27 B. C- 145 A. N. ), carrying together with the title Augustus the title \"Sebastos\" (Great). Throughout the whole medieval centuries the name of the town is met in the Georgian sources in two variants - Tskhomi and Tskhumi. At the beginning of the 14 th century the Arabian author Abu-Al - Pheda for the first time mentions it as \"Sukhum\", which is the Arabian form of the Georgian name \"Tskhum\". Turk-Ottomans, who appeared in the Black sea area in the second half of the 15 th century, also called the town Sukhum//Sokhum. In the oriental languages (Turkish, Arabian) the sound \"ts\" is absent and pronunciation of the two consonant sounds one after another is also impossible. Thus, from the Georgian name Tskhumi//Tskhomi is got the Turkish Tskhum//Tskhom, being established in Georgian in form of 'Sokhumi \"and in the Russian language in form of \"Sukhumi\". The Abkhazians call the capital town -\"Aqua\". In 1561 this Abkhazian Geographical name is fixed for the first time on the map of the Italian cartographer J. Gastald in the form of \"Aqua\" in the middle flow of the river Kuban (see here map N14). And only in 1737 on the map of the West Georgia being compiled in the Georgian language it is denoted on the territory of Sokhumi in the form of Aqua, though next to it is designated the \"Tskhum Fortress\" (see here map N13). From the North Abkhazia is bordered by the main Caucasian watershed range being spread from the North- West to the South -East. Within Abkhazia are located such peaks of the Caucasus, as Dombi-Ulgen (4046m), Gvandra (3985m), Ertsakhu (3910m), Pshish (3790m), Agepsta (3257m), Sanchar (2292m), Adzapsha (2497m), Alashtrakhu (2723m), Nakhar (2931m), Marukh (2746m) and Klukhor (2781m). All across the pass, pedestrian paths go to the North Caucasus. The main watershed range steeply descends to the can- yons of the rivers Bzip, Chkalta, Sakeni. The mountainous middle part of Abkhazia is occupied by the spur of the Caucasus - Gagra, Bzip, Chkhalta (Abkhazian), and Kodori 5 (Panavi) ranges having numerous branches from its side. Abkhazia is a mountainous country. Its 74% are occupied by the mountains and foot- hills and the rest part by the valleys and lowlands. In some places the mountains come directly to the sea, in other places there is a significant gap between them. On the North- West, on the left bank of the river Psou, between the sea and the Caucasus is situated the 10-15 kilometer valley. From the South-East the Gagra range comes directly to the sea. To the South-east from Gagra the mountainous massive gradually withdraws and the narrow seaside valley zone passes onto the Pitsunda lowlands. To the South-East from Pitsunda the mountains approach the sea and in the outskirts of Akhali Atoni edge it. To the South- East from Sokhumi the seaside zone gradually widens and starting from the left bank of the river Kodori, passes into the Kolkhida lowlands. The seaside zone is quite straight; The Sokhumi, Gagra Bays, Sokhumi and Pitsunda capes are remarkable. To the North of the Kodori range, in the middle flow of the river Kodori is situated the highland region Tsebeli and in the upper reaches of the river another highland region Dali. In the upper flow of the river Bzip, between the Caucasian and Bzip ranges the mountain- ous region of Pskhu is located. There are a lot of lakes in Abkhazia: The Ritsa, Adueda Adzij , Derikvara Adzish, Kvarash, Small Ritsa, Amtkel, Blue Lake, Inkit, Bebesir, Papantskvili etc. Abkhzia is covered with the dense net of the rivers of the Black Sea basin: Psou, Bzip, Kodori, Gumista, Kelasuri, Galidzga, Mokvi, and Inguri. The bordering river of Georgia and consequently Abkhazia and Russia - the Psou flows from the mountain range of Aibga and falls into the Black Sea near the village Leselidze. To the South-East from it flows the river Mekhadir, the sources of which are located on the South- West slopes of the Gagra range. It falls into the Black Sea near the village Gantiadi. To the South-East from the village Gantiadi the river Begerepsta - the same Cold River falls into the sea. The longest river of Abkhazia is Bzip. Its sources are located on the South slopes of the Caucasian range, at the Adange pass. It is 110 kilometers long. On the greatest part of its flow till the place where the river Iupshara falls into it, it flows to the West and then turns to the South. In the upper flow the gorge is narrow and deep. At the village Pskhu it widens and the river comes apart into branches, lower the gorge is narrow and canyon like. At the village Bzip it comes to the valley and near the Pitsunda cape flows into the Black Sea. It is significant, that \"Bzip is a comparatively new name of the river. Till 20~ ies of the 1 9 th century it was called \"Kapoetis Tskali (river Kapoeti). This is a Georgian name and comes from the name of the fish Kapoet\". Fish Kapoeti belongs to the trout-salmon family. This large variety of trout dwells in this river. The opinion about the Georgian origin of the hydronime \"Bzip\" was also expressed, being associated with the name of the plant \"Bza\" (box tree, pussy-willow). The main river of Abkhazia flowing along the box-tree or the gorge of Bzip is called box-tree or Bzip. In the gorge of the right tributary of the Bzip - the river Iupshara at the height of 884m above the sea level the picturesque lake Ritsa is located. It was formed as a result of the avalanche of the mountain Pshegishkha and overhead of the river Lashipsa. The banks of the Ritsa are surrounded with the mountain slopes being covered with the needle and mixed forests, thus making it one of the most picturesque lakes of the Caucasus. 6 On the right bank of the river Bzip a small, but extremely beautiful Blue Lake is located. To the South-East of the Bzip flows - the karst river Mchishta or Shavtskala (Black River) taking its start from the South slopes of the Bzip range and falling into the Black Sea to the West of the town of Gudauta. In the middle centuries it was called \"Mitsis Tska- li\", id. est \"Ground River\" (Underground River) as its great part flows under the earth. It's Abkhazian (Mchishta) and Russian (Black river) names are the translation of the original Georgian name of the river - \"Shavtskala\" (Black water). To the South-East of Mchishta flows - the river Khipsta, having the sources on the South slopes of the Bzip backbone and flowing into the Black Sea near the town of Gu- dauta. Its Russian name \"Belaia Rechka\" (White River) is the translation from the Geor- gian original name of the river - \"Tetrtskhala\" (White water ). In the middle centuries it was called Zupu (Zup River). On its banks the village Zupu is located (now Likhni). After which it was named. The right tributary of Khipsta is the river Egri. To the South-East of Khipsta flows the river Aapsta taking its source in the East part of the Bzip range and flows along its South slope and falls into the Black Sea between Gudauta and Akhali Afoni. It is also called Baklanovka, though historically the river was called Agatso. The name comes from the same name village. In 19 th century this river was called Aaths, which is the Abkhazian form of the Georgian name \"Agatso\". The village even nowadays has the name of Aats. To the North- West from Akhali Atoni a small river Psirtkha falls into the Black Sea. In the middle centuries it was called Anakopiis Tskali - the river of Anakopia, after the town- fortress Anakopia (now the modern Akhali Afoni). To the South-East from Psirtskha flows the river Gumista. It is formed as a result of confluence of the rivers West Gumista and East Gumista. It goes out to the Sea to west of Sukhumi. In the middle centuries it was called Tskhomi or Tskhumi River after the name of town Tskhumi (modern Sukhumi). Within modern Sukhumi the karst river Besleti, having taking its source from the karst springs falls into the Black Sea. The 4 kilometer karst tunnel connects the Besleti with the river Kelasuri falling into the Black Sea from the eastern side of Sukhumi in the village of Kelasuri. It takes its source on the South slope of the Bzipi range on the glacier Khimsa. The name \"Kelasuri\" comes from the Greek \"Klisura, \" which means the narrow mountainous path. To the South-East from Kelasuri the biggest river is Kodori, the second longest river of Abkhazia. It forms in the Dali gorge as a result of merging of the rivers Gvandra and Sakeni. The Kodori first flows to the west, then turns to the south-east and falls into the Black Sea to the South of the village Adziubj a (historical village Shkatskari or Shuatskali (Georgian name) - which means between the rivers - the translation of which is Adziubja. Its length is 84 kilometers. On the right bank of the river Kodori the Dranda cathedral, one of the religious centers of the West Georgia of the 10-1 7\" 1 centuries is located. According to the information given by the prominent Georgian historian and geographer Vakhushti Bagrationi (1696-1758), \"Kodori\" initially was the name of the village, later acquired by the river as well. The village Kodori in the form of \"Skotori\" was first mentioned in the 7 th century by the Bizantine author Thodosius Gangr. The name Kodori is Georgian by root as well as the grammar formation. The main tributary of Kodori is: Chkhalta (in 7 Abkhazian Atsgara), Mramba and Jampala together with Amtkel. In the gorge of the river Amtkel the lake Amtkel or Azanta is situated, having been formed in 1891 as result of the avalanche, which covered the river Amtkel. To South of Kodori flows the river Tskenis Tskali. Its name in the Greek translation (river Gipp) is met in the work of Phlavius Arian. The significant Abkhazian River is also Mokvi. It starts from the South slopes of the Kodori range and falls into the Black Sea not far from the town of Ochamchire. One of the main religious centers of the West Georgia of the 10- 17 th centuries the Mokvi cathedral is situated on the spot, where with the river Mokvi confluencies with its right tributary the river Gvab. To the east of Ochamchire the river Galidzga flows into the Black Sea. (The name Galidzga is of the Megrelian origin and means bank of the river and initially was the name of the seaside village), taking its start from the east slope of the Kodori range not far from the peak Khodjal. In the medieval centuries it was called \"Egristskali\", in Georgian the river Egrisi. On the South slope of the Kodori range starts the river Okumi and falls into the Sea near the village Gudava. On its left bank the historical village Okumi is situ- ated after which the river was named. The right tributaries Okumi are: the rivers Tsarche (according to the medieval Georgian sources Dadistskali) and Okhodje, on the bank of which is situated one of the most famous religious centers of the West Georgia of the 10- 18 th centuries-the cathedral of Bedia. The left tributary of the river Okumi is called Didi Eristskali - the same Ertistskali. To the East from Okumi flows the fast and deep river Inguri. It takes its source in Svaneti from the glacier situated on the height of 2714 meters over the sea level and falls into the Black Sea near the village Anaklia. In some places its lower flow separates the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia from Megrelia. Abkhazia is situated on the extreme North border of the subtropical belt. The main watershed range protects it from the north cold winds. Warm, never freezing sea and mountain rapid rivers create mild, humid subtropical climate. The significant part of Ab- khazia, approximately 55% is covered with forests. More than 2 000 plants including 150 species of trees and bushes are spread here. Others are represented in the grass forms. Nearly 400 endemic species of plants of the Caucasus are located in Abkhazia and more than 100 species are met only in Abkhazia. Out of the trees must be specially mentioned: Oak, beech, pine, chestnut, fir tree, nut-gall, box-tree, abies, elm tree, hornbeam, maple, lime etc. Here dwell the species of animals familiar for the valleys and mountain forests and the highlands: aurochs, doe, and chamois, in the Ritsa woods - Deer. Besides are met: Bear, wolf, boar, jackal, fox, lynx, forest cat, marten, mink, weasel, budger, otter, ermine, hear etc. At the beginning of the 20 th century the Caucasian aurochs was exterminated. Out of birds the following are widespread: eagle, hawk, merlin, kite, Caucasian mountain turkey, pheasant, partridge, seagull, hoopoe etc. In rivers and lakes dwell: trout, Kolkhid- ian moustache - fish, sheat-fish, salmon and sturgeon are met in some places in the sea. For protection of the useful Flora and Fauna Ritsa- Avadkhara, Pskhu, Pitsunda, Gumista and Miusera preserves have been formed. Abkhazia is rich with useful fossil. We have to mention Tkvarcheli and Bzipi coal bed. There are a lot of lead, zinc and copper deposite, plaster, lime, ceramic clay etc. The gorg- es of Kodori, Sakeni, Bzipi, Avadkhara etc. are especially rich with the mineral medical 8 waters. There are thermal medical waters in the outskirts of Tkvarcheli, Sukhumi, Novi Afon and Gagra. Magnificent and gorgeous nature and unique sources turn Abkhazia into the richest climatological health-resort. The main population of Abkhazia is Georgians and Abkhazians. The modern Abkha- zians (Apsua) ethnically belong to the people of the Abkhzian-Adigean family and their language belongs to the north-western Abkhazian- Adigean group of the Iberian-Cauca- sian family. Together with the Abkhazian language in the mentioned group enter the Aba- zian, Adigean, Kabardinian, Ubikh and other languages which is spoken by the relative people of the North Caucasus - The Abazians, Adigeans, Kabardinians, and Cherkess etc. From the ethno cultural point of view till the late medieval centuries the Abkhazians were Georgians like the population of other provinces of Georgia (Kartalinians, Kakhe- tians, Megrelians, and Svans etc. ), and were the active participants of the formation of the Georgian Statehood and culture. In the late medieval centuries as a result of the onset of the mountaineers - invasions and purposeful migration to Abkhazia of the residents of the Mountainous zone of the West Caucasus radical ethnical changes had place. As a result of the mixing of the alien mountaineers and local Georgian population the modern Abkhazian ethnos (Apsua) was formed. According to the census of 1989, the population of Abkhazia comprised 525. 061 peo- ple. The national structure was the following: Georgians - 239. 872 (45, 7%), Abkhazians - 93267(17, 8%), Armenians - 76. 541(14, 6%), Russians- 74. 914(14, 2%), Greeks -14, 664(2, 8%) and other ethnical groups - 25. 804 (4, 9%0) (see ibid, chapter XXII). According to the administrative - territorial division of 1 99 1 , in the Autonomous Re- public of Abkhazia are included 5 administrative regions - Gali, Ochamchire, Gulripsh, Sukhumi, Gudauta and also the territory under the control of the Gagra town council: 4 villages - Akhali Atoni, Pitsunda, Gantiadi and Gulripsh. Formation of Abkhazia within its modern borders is the result of the complex histori- cal processes having place during the centuries and having been completed at the end of the 20-ies of the 20 lh century. There were times when Abkhazia did not exist as an independent administrative-ter- ritorial unit. In 15-2 nd centuries B. C. the territory of modern Abkhazia was the part of the Kolkhidian kingdom and was fully populated with the tribes and communities of the Georgian origin. In the 1st century B. C. and find A. D. The Georgian communities under the name of Sanigs, Apsils andAbazgs are fixed on those territories. In the 2- 8 th centuries the territory of modern Abkhazia was included within Egrisi (Lazika). According to the information of the historical sources, in the 6-8 th centuries the South-East part of the named territory between the rivers Kodori and Inguri subdued the Odishi Eristavs of the Egrisi kingdom. In the upper reaches of the Kodori-Darial gorge lived the Svan community of the Mis- imians, being subordinated only to the ruler of Egrisi. The Apsils dwelling on the Black Sea side, between the rivers Kodori and Anakopiis Tskali also were subdued to the Egrisi administration. Further, to the North- West till the river Akheunt (modern Shakhe), was located the Principality of the Abazgs being subdued to the Lazik kingdom. In the 9-10 th centuries the territory of modern Abkhazia was the part of the independent 9 Western Georgian kingdom, traditionally named as the \"Kingdom of the Abkhazians\", ac- cording to the name of the ruling dynasty. In that kingdom the territory between the rivers Inguri and Kodori was included into the Odishi Principality. Dali gorge subordinated the Svaneti Prince (Eristav). The former Apsilia was occupied by the Tskum principality, to the North-west of which was located Abkhazian principality being spread along the sea- side till the river Nikopsia (modern Negopsujkho in Russia). After the unification of Georgia, the administrative-territorial division of the region was not changed during 2, 5 centuries. At the beginning of the 14 th century Tskhumi prin- cipality was annexed to the Odishi principality. After this the border between the Odishi and Abkhazian principalities went along the river Anakopiis Tskali. In the 70-90-ies of the 15 th century the integral Georgian State fell to pieces. The Terri- tory of modern Abkhazia with the previous administrative-territorial division entered into the Western Georgian (Imereti) kingdom. Princes (Eristavs) of Abkhazia were in the vassal bondage at one and the same time from the Imereti kings and Odishi possessing princes. In the 50-ies of the 16 th century Guria, Odishi and Abkhazia in fact separated from the Imereti kingdom. Initially the border between Odishi and Abkhazia went along the river Anakopiis Tskali. But from the 80-ies of the 16 th century the border shifted to the South-east and went along the river Kelasuri. But, in that period the rulers of Abkhazia recognized the superiority of the Odishi possessing princes (mtavars). In the 16-1 7 th centuries, as we have already mentioned in Abkhazia radical ethnical changes took place, connected with the migration of the highland tribes of the Western Caucasus. With their help and the crucial support of the Ottoman Empire , the Abkhazian princes at the end of the 17 th and beginning of the 18 th centuries managed to widen the borders to the South-East till the river Egristskali (modern Galidzga), and later the river Inguri. Little by little between the rivers Inguri and Galidzga the small feudal estate- Samurzakano was formed. From 1 702 till 1 840 this region was included into the Odishi (Megrelian) principality, excluding the short period from 80-ies of the 18 th century till 1805 when it was subdued to the possessing ruler of Abkhazia. In 1810 the Russian Empire took Abkhazian principality (from the river Bzip till the river Galidzga, without Tsebelda and other highland communities) under its \"protection\", with the purpose of its following occupation and annexation. In 1864 Russia annihilated the Abkhazian Principality and included the territory from the river Inguri to Gagra into the Sukhumi military division, later (1883) being renamed as Sukhumi region. The territory of Abkhazia, practically with its modern borders (excluding sector of Mekhadir-Psou) was officially called \" Abkhazia\" for the first time in May of 1919, when the government of the independent Georgian Democratic Republic recognized its autono- my and the National Board of Abkhazia passed the special resolution about the renaming of the region. Abkhazian autonomy with its modern borders was finally formed in 1929, when RSFSR gave back to the Georgian SSR the territory between the rivers Mekhadir and Psou. 10 Chapter II.

Stone Age (1 800 000-50 000) The Stone Age is the oldest and the most prolonged period in the development of the mankind on the earliest stage of which the investigators as a rule distinguish two main periods - Shel and Ashel. But, they must be preceded by one-the oldest stage known as the Olduvai culture. This stage is characterized with the applying of the stone tools called eoliths without the additional working up. Under that epoch the beginning of the Quater- nary period, approximately from 1 800 000 B. C. must be meant. The Quaternary period is sometimes also called the anthropogenic (associated with the process of anthropogenesis - origin of a human being). The four glacier and three intergla- cial periods are singled out. On the Caucasus the trails of the glaciations or reduction in the temperature are relatively weak and not denoted. Due to its vertical zoneness a human being practically always had the conditions for living here. Simultaneously with the fall in temperature a human being descended onto the lower warmer zone, and after warming ascends to the mountainous zone again. The vertical location of the places of dwelling of a human being is characteristic not only for the stone age, but is fixed in the following ep- ochs as well. Thus, it is obvious, that the geographical location and climate are the crucial factors and should to be taken into consideration in studying the process of settling of a humane. On the territory of Abkhazia all the vertical zones are present: the narrow coastal zone of the Colkhis lowland, foothills, 80-100 meters high terraces, mountainous-hilly and alpic zones. These circumstances together with the climate change created the condi- tions for the inner, local migration of the population. The modern territory of Abkhazia is widely known with its monuments of the Stone Age. In this respect we have to mention the works of S. Zamiatin 1 , B. Kuftin, L. Soloviev, A. Lukin, and Ju. Voronov, V. Bzhania - 2, N. Berdzenishvili, A. Kalandadze, L. Tsereteli, G. Grigolia and L. Korkia 3 3. Their merit in discovering, excavation and scientific study of the monuments is great. On the basis of the above-mentioned works dozens of monuments of all the stages of the Stone Age are fixed on the territory of modern Abkhazia. 4 Among them most sig- nificant and worth mentioning is the Jashtukh camp. It is located on the slope and foot of the mountain Jashkhtva in the north-west part of Sukhumi. The whole territory of the settlement (70 hectare area) is covered with the cultural remains. Existence of all the necessary materials for the production of the tools, good climate and location created the favorable conditions for dwelling of the primitive man on the given territory. The slopes 1 S. N. Zamiatin Paleolith of Abkhazia, Sukhumi 1977; of the same author Articles on the Paleolith. M-L. , 1961. 2 B. A. Kuftin Material for Archeology of Colkhis, v. I. Tb., 1999; A. L.

Nucleuses, rough plates, points, scrapers. Rarely are met the massive axes. Axes made by means of the bifacial technique are widely spread among the monuments of that epoch; they actu- ally represent the main farming tools and weapon. Usually they have the oblong-oval and in some cases pointed shapes. The studied material obviously belongs to the Ashel epoch; though some samples have more archaic preashel signs. 5 This problem needs the further verification. 6 The lower Paleolithic monuments of the Caucasus are quite numerous and fixed nearly in all the climatic zones. About 100 points are fixed only on the territory of Abkhazia, where Mustie artifacts were found. They are located practically in every vertical zone, beginning from the Lowlands till the Highlands. The growth of the population in that epoch makes the settling of the new living spaces of a paramount importance. In the late Ashel and Early Mustie epochs the climate dramatically changed, the temperature fell and the population had to leave the highlands. In the late Mustie period it became warmer and the population returned to the mountainous regions. Materials of the developed and late Mustian period are found in the Kodori gorge up the village Ajara, practically in the Alpic zone. But as for the early Mustian and the following epoch monuments of Gali, Ochamchire, Kelasuri, Bzip grotto etc. are located in the plain and foothill zones. From the point of view of the history of the region the fact, that Mustian monuments are met in the bordering with Abkhazia Sochi region is especially significant. Unlike Abkhazia there the open dwellings were not found and the Mustian epoch is fixed only in the Navalishen, Akhtir, Vorontsov, Khostian and other caves; this must have been caused by the influence of the climate. We have to denote, the fact that in the Stone Age monuments of Abkhazia the cra- niological material is practically absent and this hinders the process of father judgment about the process of ontogenesis. The only discovery is the anthropological remains be- ing found in the late Mustian layers of the Akshtir cave. The opinion that the Akhshtir Paleonthrop is close to the modern human and belongs to the so-called Palestinian people with some characteristic features of the modern man is also expressed. Small number of anthropological material from Sakajia, Djruchula, Tsutjavati and especially Akhshtira supposedly prove that the human of the modern physical type-Homo sapiens must have been developed precisely from this group. Not every researcher shares this opinion. The situation radically changed after the Dmanisi discovery, in the light of which the South Georgia and in the wider sense the West Trans Caucasus must be recognized as one of the main hearths of the formation of a modern humane. Namely, the regions of Abkhazia, Achara and Upper Imereti are meant. In conditions of the primitive technical equipment the primitive people had to live in small groups and lead a quite active mode of life in conditions of collectionism. In time of the developed Mustie the density of population is fixed and the early stage of the primi- tive society gradually became obsolete and the preambles for the formation of the clan society are formed. At the begin ning of the Upper Paleolith on the whole territory of the Caucasus the 5 L. Soloviev. The Primitive Society on the Territory of Abkhazia, p. 27, 35. 6 1. 1. Korobkov.

A human being leaves the mountainous regions and occupies warmer plains and deep gorges and canyons. Thus, the bone and plant remains being found in the culture layers are typical for the glaciations Upper Juraic period. Two main regions are densely populated - The basin of Rioni-Kvirila and North- West Colkhis. The chronological scale has been worked out. 7 This period is relatively short and lasts for 25 000 years. The technique of stone work up changes. New forms emerge - scrapers, chisels, points, oblong plates, nucleases. The fact of developing of geometrical microlits, bone tools being worked up with the retouch are worth mentioning. In several monuments (Mgvime grotto) are noticed unsystematic lines being cut on the walls. On the territory of Abkhazia the paleolithic material is more profoundly studied in three points: Apiancha, Supinipshakva (Cold Grotto) and Okumi. Interesting monuments are explored in the caves of Sochi -Adler region - Akhshtir, Novolisheno, Khosta and others. The upper Paleolithic layer of the Akhshtir cave is dated with 19 500 + 500 ac- cording to the radiocarbon method (Dating by means of the calibered method shows more ancient results). Precisely, those upper paleolithic monuments cover the region of the North- West Colkhis, though the opinion about the local differences with the synchronous monuments of the West Georgia is still doubtful. Among the monuments of Abkhazia the most significant and fully studied is the cave Apiancha. 8 The common thickness of the cultural layers come up to 12 meters. A human being settled there in the epoch of Mustie and lived during the Upper Paleolith, Mezolith and the end of Neolith. Thus, the picture of the continuous development of the culture through the three stages of the Stone Age is clear. From the aspect of the stratigraphical sec- tion of Apiancha is actually unique and model for studying the stone age of the Caucasus. In the upper Paleolithic layers of Apiancha (2 levels) were found the tools of all the above mentioned types. Most significant is the existence of the abundance and variety of the microlithic tools. In those layers the polished bone tools emerge: needles, pins, awis, knife type and harpoon like tools etc. The analogues materials are discovered at the sources of the rivers Kodori and Amtkel in the two layer cave \"Cold Grotto\" (Khupinipshashkhva). The remains of animals are also worth mentioning. Among them we have to pick out: cave bear, noble deer, boar and various birds. It is clear, that hunting together with the collectionism comprises the basis for the farming. Probably fishing played an important part. From the social point of view the Upper Paleolithic is the primitive clan society. The Upper Paleolithic population is concentrated mainly on the territory of the west Georgia and supposedly from this place starts its dissemination to other regions of the Caucasus. From this respect the fact that the given materials have a lot in common with the monuments of the North Caucasus attracts our attention. The contacts and typological resemblance with the Iran-Iraq and Azov coast materials are observed. This fact points to the common character of the Caucasian (includ- ing Abkhazia) Upper Paleolithic being conditioned by the same type historical processes. Lack of the craniological materials does not give us the possibility of determining 7 S. N. Zamiatnin.

Sup- posedly it is the following stage of the development of the Neanderthaljntelligent of the Lower Paleolithic for which there were all the conditions in Georgia. The following stage of development of the Lower Paleolithic_culture is known under the name of \"Mezolith. \" This period first of all can be characterized by the dramatic change in climate. There ends the ice stage and the modern geological period- the Golot- sen starts. Mezolith develops on the basis of the local Upper Paleolith. The fact, that in the above- mentioned monuments (Apiancha, White Cave, Rioni-Kvirila Basin) mezolithic layers come directly after the Upper Paleolithic ones covering them. 9 Typological analyses of the achieved materials reveals the evolutionary picture of the gradual development. My- icrolithic industry being born in the Upper Paleolithic gradually refines and reaches the perfection. A humane still dwells mainly in caves; though warming of the climate gives him a possibility of the repeated pioneering of the plains and mountains. This is the rea- son, why during the Mezolith period all the landscapes and climatic zones were settled, though the leading part still belongs to Rioni-Kvirila and Abkhazia. On the territory of the latter are fixed and partly studied the monuments of paramount importance such as: Kvachara (Kvabchaar), Cold Grotto, Jampal, Jashtkhv open dwelling and others. Study of the materials enables us to distinguish two periods of these monuments - early and late. Father development of the microlythic technology and emerging of the geometrical fig- ures (segment, trapezium, and triangle) are characteristic for this period. Simultaneously, emerge combined tools made of wood and bone, in the special groove of which with the help of special sticky substance microlyths having the form of a geometrical figure were attached. In case of damage of the inset it was not difficult to replace it. It is supposed, that the combined tools were used in the collectionist farming, forgetting of the vegetation products. Their applying in processing the animal remains (F. E. hides) is quite possible. Household and economy of the primitive man had a possessing character and was based on the collectionism and hunting, that is proved by the bone remains. In getting the vegetation products, the bone points and stone hoes were used like tools. This period may be considered an initial phase of the farming. From this point of view the findings in Apiancha is quite significant (Gulripsh region). Certain changes in the character of farming and economy caused the alteration of the social-community sphere. The basis for the clan society and its oldest stage - early Matriarkhat are formed. This stage supposes existence of the settled, early tribal communities. Population lives on the one and the same place for a long time, does not migrate, that would be impossible without the existence of a rather organized and cohesive collective body. The first organization of such type must have been the clan community being based on the Matriarchal principles. The like communities would become the unions of the tribes, the embryo of which are seen starting with the Upper Paleolithic epoch. Existence of several tribal communities is supposed in the Black Sea coast Georgia during the Upper Paleolithic. Later the relative tribes settle all over the territory of the West Caucasus causing disintegration of the common Caucasian 9 O. Japaridze. Archeology of Georgia, p 34-39 (in Georgian). The same author: On the Problem of the Ethnic History of the Georgian tribes, p. 25-29: L. Tsereteli. Mezolith Culture, p. 77 etc. 14 cultural union. Reflection of the named processes must be emerging of the local re- gions. But mainly the uniform character of the material culture gives us the possibil- ity of saying that there were no serious ethnical changes on the territory of the west Caucasus. This process had to take place at the end of Paleolithic and Mezolith. Neolith or the New-Stone age (9-5 millenniums B.C.) - is one of the most signifi- cant stages in development of the human society. At that time the essential changes occur in the type of farming. The possessing farming of Paleolithic moves to the producing basis. During the Neolith rise and development of the main types of the producing farming -agriculture and cattle-breeding had placed. Emerging of the new forms and their development caused great changes almost in all spheres of the social relations. A human being is closely connected with the land and firmly settles on it. The settlements of the village type with the man-made dwellings are formed. Tools of a new type, new technical skills and methods emerge: grinding-polishing, drilling, macrolithic processing of a stone. Neolythic axes are made using this technique. This is quite effective and practical tool, which appeared on the late stages of the Stone Age. Emerging of the farming influenced all types of the social life. This is the reason why this phenomenon is called \"Neolythic Revolution. \" Economical revolution must have had place where the conditions were optimal. Because of this Neolythic culture did not occur simultaneously in different places. In this respect the most prepared appeared to be the front Asian region, including the Trans Caucasus and among them Abkhazia. Formation of the Neolythic culture there had place as a result of the evo- lutionary development of the local Mezolyth, which is clearly seen in the microlythic technique of the stone processing. The monuments of the Neolithic culture are less studied. Their concentration is obvious in the West Georgia. Two steps can be pointed out - early and late Neolith. Shift to the farming or manufacturing is clearly reflected in the monuments of the later period. On the territory of Abkhazia Neolithic monu- ments are fixed in different points. 10 The most ancient seems to be the Gumurishi settlement, which can be included into the monuments of the \"Non-Ceramic Neolith. \" Chronologically, the closest to it is Gali -I and then -Lesa, Kistrik, Chkhortoli and Atara. A special closeness is noticed with the materials of near Kuban (Kamenomost- skaia) and probably we deal here with one and the same local variant. The second such local variant is the group of the monuments of the lowland part of West Georgia (Anaseuli I-II, Odishi, Gurianta, Paluri, Mamati, Tetramitsa, Sataplia and others). All of them are characterized by the specific features (emergence of the ceramics of hand- made type), enabling their grouping according to the stages. Mainly the one-type character of the material gives the possibility of distinguishing of two local variants of one integral material culture of the West Trans Caucasus. 10 Nebieridze.

Epoch of Eneolith - Middle Bronze (Middle of the Vth and Middle of the II millennium B. C. ) \"Eneolith\" is the Latin word and means bronze-stone age and is often called \"Khalkolit\", from the Greek word \"Khalkos\" (Copper, Bronze). Now in the special literature this period and culture are referred under the term of \"Early Rural Culture. \" Monuments of this culture are abundantly presented in Abkhazia. But we have to mention here, that one of them has not been yet fully unearthed. This of course, makes the complete reconstruction of the building technique used in constructing villages and other objects of the farming importance difficult. 11 The monuments of the early rural epoch (eneolith) of Abkhazia are of the two types: open and cave dwellings. En- eolythic monuments of Abkhazia mainly consisted of one type material: stone, bone, pottery; in this epoch the first metal things start to appear. They were made by means of the cold wrought from the crude copper. The Eneolythic culture of Abkhazia is genetically connected with the previous Neolith epoch. Continuation and development of the traditions of the neolith culture are vividly presented in such leading elements as the type of settlement, kinds of farming, stone industry, ceramic production and decor. Two types of settlements of the eneolythic period are stated: cave dwellings and open settlements. Of the cave type are: Okumi, 12 the Vorontsov cave - \"Hearth Grotto\" 13 , \"Akhshtir. \" 14 . The open type settlements are: Psou 15 , Atara 16 , Machara 17 , Gvandra 18 etc. The trails of the solid buildings were not discovered, though the specialists think, that in Machara and Gvandra the existence of the dug outs and semi dug outs, the upper part of which might be the watted dub constructions of \"Patskha\" type are supposed. Archeological material being discovered in those settlements is mainly of one type. This is stone, flint, ceramics. Rarely are met the productions of bone and horn. The mate- rials are as a rule concentrated on the stamped fields of the supposed dwellings around the stone paved containing ash hearths. The stone industry is the basis of the fanning in the eneolithic society. Typological and morphological analyses of the stone tools reveal the trails of the Neolithic traditions. The tools made of cobble-stone, basalt, serpentine and other sorts of stone are widely used. The most significant are the ground-polished one sided and wedge like axes, cutters, 11 G. Pkhakadze.

Also in neolith takes its origin the new tech- nique of chipping and compression point processing of the surface, later being developed and acquired its universal character in the early eneolithic and early bronze epoch. The most part of the eneolithic tools: axes, chisels. Cutters, hoes, tools of the lance type and others are made using the above-named technique. Lengthwise split pebbles, later after additional processing used as a scraper, cutter etc. were widely used. A special place in the stone industry was occupied by the stone hoes. Hoes of the Sochi-Adler type are characteristic for the Sochi-Adler region. In the Sukhumi region the hoes have the oval shape and are called the hoes of the \"Sukhumi type. \" Both types of the hoes are simultaneous and continue their existence in the early bronze epoch as well. The flint tools are not numerous. These are splinters and rough oblong plates without retouching. Okumi cave is an exception. The geometrical microliths, trapezium, segments and retouched plates are found there. In the like complex are represented the flint tools in Akhshtir cave+neolitical traditions are observed in the ceramic production. The composi- tion of the clay, ornament and shape point to it. The grotto \"Ochajni\" is distinguished with its numerous two piece polished flint arrow heads. The above-mentioned tools show, that eneolithical cultural layers of the caves are older than the open dwellings (Machara, Gvandra). This fact is proved not only by the degradation of the stone industry, but by the ceramic production as well. For defining of the age of the eneolithic monuments of Abkhazia we use the date hav- ing been obtained through the method of radio carbon analyses of the wooden remains of the IVth layer of the Machara settlement 38 10+, as a foothold, though according to the verified caliber method this culture is dated with the Vth millennium B.C. Morphological analyses of the stone and flint tools point to the fact, that in the settle- ments being located in different geographical zones different types of farming is fixed. In the settlements of the open terrace type (Machara, Gvandra, Psou, Guadikhu) lance type, hoe type tools are in abundance due to the agricultural activity. Hoes of the \"Sukhumi\" and \"Sochi-Adler\" type and grain grinders are connected with the agriculture. Round and oval sinkers plummets for the fishing nets being found on these territories illustrate the significant part of fishing in economy. In the settlements of the cave type (Okumi, Ochajni, Akhshtir) are not found the ag- ricultural tools. Arrow heads and spears heads prove the dominant role of hunting in economy of those settlements. Eneolithic materials, stone tools and especially hoes speak about the close resem- blance with the monuments of the front Asia (Khasun, Sialk, Djemdet - Nasr, Suza etc. ). The concrete materials show a certain connection with the simultaneous materials of the caves of the Rioni -Kvirila river basins. A number of the leading elements of culture of the materials of both west region of the Caucasus give the basis for associating them with the early Maikop culture of the North Caucasus. 19 The direct continuation of the eneolith culture is the Bronze Epoch, which in its turn is divided into three periods: early, middle and late bronze. By the end of the IVth century B. C. in the life of the West Caucasus are revealed the significant changes, being conditioned by the historical processes. Through the follow- 19 A. A. Formozov. Stone Age - Eneolyth of the Cuban Area. M., 1965. 17 ing millennium intensification of agriculture has place, as well as emerging of the new cattle farms, development of the trades and first of all metallurgy conditioning the further development of the producing abilities and manufacturing relations being reflected in the material culture. Agriculture and cattle breeding together with the highly developed metallurgy created the firm basis for the new economy, causing the serious social shifts in the public life. By that time the settling of the territories of the West Caucasus including Abkhazia completes, though all the cultural layers of the monuments are of the different might. In the cave (Vorontsov Grotto) and on the river and sea coast settlements (Machara, Gvandra) early bronze is the direct continuation of eneolith. The cultural layers seem more intensive on the slopes of the natural heights and artificial-settlements (Ochamchire, Pichori). The III millennium B. C. is the chronological frame of the early bronze period. This is the period when metallurgy was the basis for the economical, cultural and social develop- ment of the society. Metal (copper together with its admixture), which in the previous eneolithic epoch was represented by the single objects being made by means of the cold wrought experiences the sharp ascend. The ancient metallurgists knew how to obtain copper from the ore and add to it for improving the quality of the alloy different admixtures in the appropriate quantities: first arsenic and antimony and then lead. Discovery of the molding methods gave the society of the early bronze epoch the possibility of producing of the various tools of farming and weapon. Out of the common group of the population a specific group of the craftsmen skilled in the metal processing and smelting. One of the main markers of the early bronze epoch is the serial character of producing of the metal tools. The poof of it is numerous open and two - sided casting forms met in abundance in the settlements of that period (Pichori). The local population mined the ore in the upper sources of the river Bzip. In the cop- per mines of Bashkapsara both - the open minings and adits of the III -VHIth millennium B. C. are found. In the west Trans Caucasus of that period is fixed the second powerful metallurgic hearth in the upper flow of the rivers Rioni and Kvirila. On the early stage of the early bronze period carst caves were not used (\"Kolokolni\" and \"Zalejni\" Grotto). 20 The traces of the clay floors with the built-in hearths are found there. In the sea cost coastal settlements of the North- West Colkhis - Maxhara 21 and Gvandra dug-outs and semi dug-outs are met. These are round plan, flat bottomed pits, surrounded by the holes for adjusting of the wooden poles. It is supposed that the wooden frame were woven from the special plant of the bamboo type. Then the whole construc- tion was plastered by the clay coating. The grounds for the dwellings were preliminary tramped. 22 Quite different picture is seen on the artificial hill like settlements and the monuments of the developed, final stage. The Hills are usually not high, natural or artificial, being located close to each other and surrounded by the moats and connected with each other with the ditch-c anals. (Ochamchire, Pichori, Nakargali, Ganmukhuri etc. ). 20 For more information see: G. Pkhakadze.

(L. Soloviev 23 , B. Kuftin 24 ). The cultural layer was beneath the sea level. The tramped clay grounds being paved with the cobble stone with the wattle dub dwellings of the \"Patskha\" type were found. In the second monument object near the river Gumista (Sukhumi region) the architec- tural trails are not found. The borrows was excavated therein which the dead corpses laid in the crouched position on their sides. 25 The materials being found in the settlements of Ochamchire and Gumista - ceramics and stone tools are identical with other stone and ceramic production of the same epoch. The early bronze culture by the place of its discovery is called the \"Ochamchire \"cul- ture. (L. Soloviev, V. Bzhania, I. Tsvinaria). But at the same time in literature the term \"Protocolch culture\" was also popular. (T. Mikeladze) 26 . Lately, on the basis of the old and new materials we came to the conclu- sion that one type middle bronze culture covered the East coast of the Black Sea, Colkhis lowland with the foothill line and as a result the term \"Colchian early bronze culture\" emerged. (G. Pkhakadze), 27 as wider and all- embracing notion corresponding to the real situation. In spite of the commonness and one typness three local zones can be picked out: North- West Colkhis (Abkhazia), Central Colkhis and South- West Colkhis (Achara-Gur- ia). Among the settlements of the early bronze a special place is occupied the settlement Pichori (Gali region). It may be considered a model monument, as on the central hill 8 cultural layers are fixed being dated with the second half of the III millennium B. C. till the beginning of the III century B. C. 3 The VII and VHIth payers can be considered the early bronze period of 9 width 0-3 centimeters). In the VHIth cultural layer the traces of the constructions on the piles with the wooden platforms and clay floors are recorded. We can conclude from the traces of the clay coating with the trails of the wooden twigs, the dwelling walls were woven and clay coated. In the 8 lh layer there is an open cult facility on the floor of which around the hearth various pottery, stone tools, wooden ploughs, me- tallic objects and 50 clay two - piece melting forms for casting of the tubular- butt axes, hoes and four sided forms for the 4 different objects. Study of the Pichori settlement and artifacts being found there enabled the researchers (M. Baramidze, G. Pkhakadze, and L. Jibladze) restore the complete picture of life, farming, economics, technical equipment and cult rituals of the early bronze society. Early bronze culture of Abkhazia - is the direct heir of the local eneolith. The stone industry demon strates the strong eneolithic traditions: the tools made of pebble stones are 23 L. N. Soloviev.

Flint industry experiences decline, as the nucleases are amorphic like the most part of the splinters. The oblong plates are absent. Scrapes, cutters and scrapers are small in num- ber and atypical. Only three arrow heads were found. All of the three have the asymmetric shape. One of them is hefty. The spear heads have the same shape. The flint inset of the sickles having the two sided polishing and toothed edge is worth mentioning. The most part of the pottery is hand-made. The clay dough is with the admixtures of calcite, shamot, lime and quartz. The baking is grayish-brown and pink, or reddish and grayish brown, grayish and light-brown. The shapes are the following: jars, pots, bowls, mugs, big vessels. Most of them have parallel lines on the surface- the trails of the prelim- inary to the plaster-work smoothing by the comb-like object. Functionally they represent the table-ware for keeping of the provision and liquids. The handles are characteristic for all the types of pottery. They are mainly adjusted to the corolla and shoulders of the vessel, as for the big vessels (pots) they are adjusted to the neck and body. The mostly met type of ornaments are nipple like, thorn like, prolongated, oval, saddle like, cone like and other stucco moldings. The relief belts are met around the shoulder. In the Pichori and Ochamchire settlements together with the above-described tradi- tional pottery radically different table-ware modeled from the well-kneaded clay is also met. It can be distinguished from the general bulk of the ceramic vessels and is closely connected with the materials of the East Georgia, of the so-called Bedeni group. The age of the early bronze monuments is defined by the 8\" 1 layer of the Pichori settlement dated with C14 2290+60, which after calibration traces back to the first part of the III millen- nium B. C. The soil is cultivated by the wooden ploughs. Two different type wooden ploughs are found in Pichori. Thus, agriculture is of the plough type and this means usage of the draught force. The figurines of bulls being spread all over the Trans Caucasus, part of them having the holes in the neck area are the proof of this. The appearance of vehicles is connected with this period. In the Pichori settlement a great deal of the remains of cultural cereals are found: wheat, oats, and rye etc. The bones of the small and large (ox, cow) livestock and also of the pigs are found. It speaks about the significant part of the cattle breeding in the farming of that epoch. The real basis for the economic rise of the society on this given stage is the sudden and rapid development of metallurgic manufacturing. The serial molding of the fanning and military tools and weapons are organized. The Pichori settlement demonstrates unique samples of metallurgy: 60 two - sided shapes for molding of axes and hoes, four sided open shapes for four different objects (spoon, dagger, spear head and unidentified object). Namely, in this place was discovered the set of objects proving the process of metallurgic manufacturing. Together with the shapes these are: ash-boxes, dippers, pipes, bowl like vessels with the remains of the melted metal, slag, 8 bronze hoes etc. It is supposed that in the bronze metallurgy the copper deposit of Abkhazia and Upper Racha was used. 20 Magnificent metal articles are found in the middle sized dolmens tracing back to the early bronze period: floppy-butt axes, lifelike daggers, ornamented pitchforks with the open and closed plugs, pins etc. In order to produce them the methods of molding, wroughting and smoldering by the wax model were used. Some articles are first molded in a shape and then additionally wrought. 28 Metal articles are made of arsenic copper. Depending on the usage of the article admixture of arsenic was 2, 7 or 6, 73%. Development of metallurgy and the intense development of agriculture put forth the para- mount part of a man in farming that resulted in the final formation of the patriarchal society. In the epoch of eneolith and especially of the early bronze on the whole coast and foothill line of the Eastern Black Sea coast mainly one type material culture was spread. Ethnical belonging of the tribes is difficult to define, but according to the archeological material, this territory at that time must have been settled by the group of the kin of blood tribes. In the one type culture local regions are also depicted. Abkhazia is one of such regions the main characteristic and specific feature of which is dolmens. Early small-sized dolmens trace back to the middle of the III millennium B. C. They are located both in the coastal and mountainous zones (Eshera, Azanta, Otkhara, Kulanurkhva, Shroma, Doi). A very important part in there studying and excavating be- longs to A. Lukin, L. Soloviev, B. Kuftin, O. Japaridze, and I. Tsvinaria. 29 All the known today dolmens are of one type. They are trapezium megalithic burial constructions. Dol- men is generally constructed by means of four vertically placed massive, solid flat slabs and covered with the same type slab. In some dolmens the floor is covered with the stone plates. In the front wall always having the South or South-East orientation is made a round hole being locked by the plug. Dolmen is a collective clan burial. The dolmens are used for the secondary burial ritu- als. The dead being wrapped in the hides were hung on the trees. The bare, fleshless bones were put into the dolmen through the front hole. Small and middle sized dolmens are of the early bronze period. The large dolmens are attributed to the following epoch and were used till the late bronze period. As it is known, dolmens are widely spread in the North Caucasus, especially on the Novosvobodnenski stage, but by the external shape and the materials being found there, it is clear, that dolmens of Abkhazia are older than the North Caucasian ones. 30 Monuments and culture of Abkhazia of the early bronze period are developed in the middle bronze epoch. It is one of the most poorly investigated periods. The reason is the lack of the monuments and their incorrect dating. On the basis of the Dikhagudzuba I and II prof. T. Mikeladze was the first to distinguish the middle bronze stage of the multilayer settlements of the West Georgia and defined them as \"Protocolkhis II\". 31 Stratygraphical slit, cut on the central hill in Pichori confirmed T. Mikeladze 's classification. Existence of the two cultural layers of the middle bronze period corrected the chronological scheme. Two chronological stages of the middle bronze were distinguished - \"Protocolkhis Ha 28 G. G. Pkhakadze. Eastern Black Sea Coast in the second half of the IV-III millennium B. C.

In the Protocolkhis II ceramics production of three groups are picked out. In the first group are united the so-called black polished or brown polished pottery. Among the shapes the most widely used is the egg-shaped large vessel with the flat, ribbon like handles, being attached to the neck, wide necked mugs, vases on the tall stem, flat bottomed bowls, frag- ments of the thin table-ware especially the handles, ornamented with the cut, geometrical, wavy or zigzag lines. 33 Samples of the black polished ceramics are met in the VHI-VIIth layers of Pichori, Ochamchire and lower layers of Ispani. Black polished production of the interesting for us period is found in Vl-IVth layers of Pichori I, Pichori - VI, Nakargali, Anaklial and II, in the upper layers of Ispani etc. Almost in every monument black polished and brown polished ceramics is represented with single objects. Even in Pichori where pottery pro- duction is more than in other monuments, it does not exceed 1% of the common ceramic entity. Arising out of it, acknowledging this group as a local Colkhis ceramic production is doubtful (T. Mikeladze), since if the society possesses the technology of production of such a high quality production is natural, that it prefers it. But, here the mass production (99%) is represented by the rough ceramics of the low quality and absolutely of differ- ent shapes, Part of the researchers consider it to be imported (L. Soloviev, B. Kuftin, M. Baramidze, L. Jibladze, E. Gogladze). 34 Sometimes the hearth of the production of this type of ceramics is considered Maikop. But in it the viselike goblets, the same type bowls, long ribbon like handles and carved ornament are not met. Another part of the research- ers (Ju. Voronov, J. Apakidze) 35 think, that this kind of pottery originates from the Front Asia (Anatolia). But it is significant, that in that region the like type carved pottery is not spread. Here, mainly the brown-polished production is more common, as for the black polished, it is represented with single objects. More real ways of finding the origin of the black polished ceramics is on the territory of Eastern Georgia. Pichori ceramics most of all resembles the articles of the so-called \"Be- deni circle\" and precisely shapes (bowls, viselike goblets, double vessels, ritual ceremonial vessels with the ribbon like handles) carved ornament and metallic shine. These elements unite the two regions and enable posing the question of their common origin. Appearance of the black polished ceramics in Colkhis actually coincides with the golden age of the Beden-Martkopi culture. In the second group of ceramics articles of rough clay with admixture of sand and basalt are united. Baking is gray and brown and rarely black. This is typically protochol- chian production spreading of which is noticed in Colkhis from the middle of the III and middle of the II millennium B. C. It is natural, that in the course of this time a certain development of some shapes, though the common look of these vessels is mainly of the same type. Among the s hapes are distinguished large pithoses with the open corollas and hori- 32 M. Baramidze. Eastern Black Sea Coast..., p. 117-145; L. Jibladze. Settlements of the Colkhis Lowlands, P. 103-126. 33 M. Baramidze. Eastern Black Sea Coast..., p. 117-126. 34 Ibid. 35 Speech of J. Apakidze at Signagi InternationalSimposium, 1995. 22 zontal handles. The most characteristic ornament is the relief belt with the fingerlike or hatch like prints and sometimes pouch like nods. The latter is especially characteristic for North- West Colkhis; together with it the table-ware with the vessel with the three handles, bows with the vertical holes or the nipple like cones, jars with the cylinder body and vertical, often double handles and ornamented upper part; round pots with thin walls and remains of plants or wattle on the bottom. Hornlike andrions are also met. In the middle bronze period the third type of the ceramic production characteristic for the following late bronze period is also met. For this group are characteristic the bowlike shapes, fine-grained well-kneaded dough, even baking, black polished surface. The pot- tery is decorated with the concentric circles, half arches and chevrons round the cone like projections or the false handle. The ceramics of this group has certain connection with the production of Terramar culture in Europe. 36 It might have been the Eastern-European cultural influence. It is worth mentioning, that Colchian ceramics of the VH-VIth centuries B. C. reveal certain impulses of the early settlements in Bolgaria that speaks about the peri- odical contacts of the Eastern Europe and Caucasus being reflected in the material culture. This kind of pottery appear in the IVth layer of Pichori I together with the ceramics of the I and II groups being described above. Thus, the materials of the IVth layer of Pichori are of the mixed character. The typical \"protocolhian ceramics\" of the early and middle bronze together with the articles of the following late bronze period. It is clear, that we are dealing here with the transitional stage between the middle and late bronze cultures and it is no use in including them in any of them. It is significant, that the like mixed material was fixed in the lower (VI) layer of Namcheduri III layer of Anaklia I, Layer of Nosiri and IV-V layers of Ergeti. Thus, in the Colchian settlements a number of monuments are obviously uniting the middle and late bronze stages. This opinion is supported with the appropriate dating being performed by the interdisciplinary methods with the middle of the II century B.C. Study of the protocolchian ceramics of the II stage according to the strati graphical sec- tion of Pichori enables us to divide this period in two chronological stages: protocolchian Ha and lib. To the protocolchian Ha belong the 6th cultural layer of Pichori 1, 1ST layer of Machara III, Gumista I, and the upper layer of Gvandra, Akhra Kapsh and Pal. The detail characteristic for this stage defining its chronological frames are long, ribbon like handles of vessels originating from the VIII- VII layers, but disappearing in the Vth layer. Chrono- logically the protocolchian stage Ha includes the period from the middle of the 20th till the end of the 18 th century B. C. To the II stage belong the Vth layers of Pichori I, Pichori VI, IV-VI horizons of Nakargali, the upper layer of Anaklialland III layer of Anaklia I. For this period are characteristic the vessels with the concave, fiber traced bottom or horizontal, pair or cut from the top handles and also bowls with the nipple cones and vertical holes, hornlike andrions, imitations of the black polished ceramics with the carved ornaments! ribbonlike or wide, flat handles etc. Chronologically the II stage includes 17- 16 th and prob- ably the first part of the XVth century B. C. Out of the metallic components of the middle bronze culture the various variants of the tubular butt axe are worth mentioning. The first variant unites the axes of the so-called 36 B. A. Kuftin. Materials on Archeology of Colchida, V. II, p. 237-240; T. Mikeladze. Findings..., p. 21. 23 Sachkhere type (In Imereti) being met on the final stage of the early bronze period and spread me the mountainous and foothill Abkhazia. The second variant unites the axes from the dolmens of Abkhazia and early necropolises of Trialeti (Eastern Georgia). They differ from the second variant with relatively short plug, concave but quite massive, solid body and slightly widened blade. Chronological gamut of the axes being found in Pichori (third variant) and their mold- ed shapes is quite widespread in the 13-15* centuries B. C. They are characterized by the straight, six sided body, ornamented in the upper part with the relief stripes, short socket, and rounded blade. Original shape of those axes gives the basis of uniting them into the separate, \" Pichori\" variant of the tubular butt axes. Approximately analogues articles are found in Krasnodar, Gantiadi and Svaneti. It somehow resembles the weapon from Urup and Paskau. Prototypes of the North Caucasian weapons can be searched in the \"Pichori variant\", which is proved by the straight body and concave blade. We have the entire basis to consider the articles from Pchori the prototypes of the Colchian axes. The stone axes are characterized by the prolonged, cylinder shape, rounded butt, and wedge-shaped wide blade. In the middle part is drilled a hole. They appear at the end of the early bronze epoch. The most part of it is found in the North- West Colkhis and they might have been considered the peculiarity of that region. The dagger is one of the rarest sorts of weapon. There are several samples from Sach- khere, dolmens and two articles from Pichori I. They are flat, short and with the usually weakly pronounced haft. They are traced back to the early bronze period, though their appearance in the Vlth layer points to the fact, that they were spread at the beginning of the middle bronze epoch. Daggers of the second type were also spread. The combined molding shape form Pichori I is the proof of it on one of the facets of which the dagger is sub-triangular, prolonged and haftless overdue. Typologically it resembles the articles of the following period. Copper hoes are fixed in several points of the East Black Sea Coast. The three hoes being found in the 8 th layer of Pichori I have the oval and sub-triangular_shape and ap- proximately ten moldering shapes reveal three main variants of the hoe. They appear in the last fourth of the III millennium B. C. though exist in the middle bronze epoch as well. Flint tools are represented with the inlets of the sickles and arrow heads and spears. For the middle bronze period thorn like from one side inlets, sometimes concave form the back side narrow shapes are characteristic. They are very old and do not need the chrono- logical differentiation. Arrow heads of the triangular shape with the symmetrical shoulders are characterized for the monuments of the late bronze and early iron of Colkhis. The shapes with the asym- metrical - concave shoulders of the Pichori type are characteristic for the protocolchian culture. Analyses of the material culture reveals that the II stage of the protocolchian culture has the genetic connections with the previous and following stages and it is impossible to sepa- rate them. That small number of material of the middle bronze period shows, that we have the entire basis to divide the protocolchian culture into the two stages - earlier and later. The problem of relation of the Middle and Late Bronze cultures of Colkhis is interest- 24 ing. Till recently those connections seemed problematic and suspicious. The excavations of Pichori settlement gave a clue for solving of this problem. In the IVth layer of the central hill, as it was mentioned earlier was found the mixed material and this probably means penetration and merging of the two local-chronological variants of Colkhis culture. In this respect Pichori is not an exception. Such kind of mix is characteristic for Ergeti settlement, 37 Illrd layer of Anaklia I, IVth layer of Nakargali, Vlth layer of Namcheduri, II layer of Nosiri. This fact gives basis for dating those monuments with the transitional period between the middle bronze and late bronze epochs. In that period a part of the population - metallurgists actively pioneer the mountains, as the need in copper ore in- creases. Another part of the population - farmers stay in valleys and plains and keep to the traditions of the protocolch culture. This is the period when on the Caucasian range slopes are fixed hundreds of copper mining pits which gave thousands of tons of ore. The tribes dwelling in the South territories move to the vacant lands and occupy part of it. The pain- less merging of micro cultures has place. The firm genetic connection of those cultures is better seen in the metal production than in ceramics of the transitional period. From this point of view interrelation of the tubular butted axes with the Colchian ones; the same is with hoes, arrow-heads, spears and daggers. They confirm the fact, that in the North- West Colkhis on the transitional stage of the middle and late bronze epochs the ethnical struc- ture of the population was not changed. The denoted innovations must have been connected with an additional phenomenon solving of which is crucial in explaining of the historical processes having place in the Caucasus. In the early and middle bronze periods in the North- West Colkhis as it was mentioned earlier the dolmen culture with the specific constructions, rituals and stock was spread. 38 Dolmen as a burial place unexpectedly disappears by the middle of the II millen- nium B. C. and gave place to the new necropolis (Cromlech, Osuari) though the genetic connection in the burial ritual and stock is obvious. When the part of the population leaves the lowland regions among them are the carriers of the dolmen culture as well. The proof of it is the vaults of the Bril burial, 39 being built of the shale plates using the dry laying method. With its architectural details and stock (mainly ornaments) it repeats some com- plexes of the late layer of Abkhazian dolmens and complexes from Gari, Tlia, Sachkhere, and Nuli. The Bril necropolis resembles the burial N16 of the upper Rutkha in Koban. 40 Comparison of the Bril and Tlia complexes means that the upper Rutkha N16 is to be dated back to the 14 th century B. C. The rout from Colkhis to the territory of Koban culture across Racha can be traced. This process being proved by the archeological facts fixes impulses and innovations coming from the South to the North Caucasus. 41 Actually this is the first stage of spreading the southern influence to the North and is connected 3 7 T.

The Late Bronze - Early Bronze Epochs. Starting form the second half of the II millennium B.C. practically in all the Caucasus is noticed changes in the local material culture and everyday life. The cultural contacts with the outer world obviously decrease and a certain \"cultural isolation\" is observed. Within the Caucasus a homogeneous and at one and the same time specific line of devel- opment is noticed. On the territory of Georgia in this period like the earlier epochs two archeological cultures are formed: in the East - Central Trans Caucasian and in the West- West Georgian (Colchian). In each of them homogeneous material culture and the mode of development are noticed. At the same time it is possible to pick out local regions and in them micro local manufacturing hearths. The North- West Colkhis (The territory of the modern Abkhazia) is considered the local variant of the integral Colkhis culture. 42 It has to be mentioned here, that this period is characterized by the abundance of the monuments. A sharp rise of different trends of farming, especially bronze and iron metal- lurgy resulted in a specific \"demographical outburst\", which covered both the plain part of Colkhis and the mountainous zone of the Caucasus. The rise of the manufacturing production and especially in pottery and metallurgy is characteristic for this period, as well as population increase and a number of necropolises and settlements. In some settle- ments (Pichori, Mziuri, and Nakargali) are fixed the embryos of the urbanistic civilization (fortifying of the settlements with the man-made ditches, manufacturing producing etc. ). Thus, we have all the right to consider this period \"protourbanic civilization, \" or the period preliminary to the formation of the early class state. On the territory of Abkhazia are fixed almost 300 objects of that period. They are repre- sented with the settlements, necropolises, manufacturing hearths and hords, I. E. With all the cultural components characteristic for the archeological monuments. It is natural, that not all of them turned to be the objects of the scientific investigation and study, though the studied objects give the possibility of restoring the general picture of that period. One fact is clear, that Colkhis culture emerged on the basis of the original local culture and neither cataclysm, and not the ethno-cultural changes can be stated here. The studied material enables us to pick out three micro regions: I micro local vari- ant consists of the settlements of the low flow of the river Inguri, II-III layers of Pichori settlement and adjusting to it hills N2-10 and also artificial hills - settlements of Mziuri, Abaju, Tagilon and Tsarche the archeological material of which with some specific ele- ments is mainly the replica of the findings of the Colkhis valley plain and lowlands and settlements of Southwest Colkhis. The II micro local variant is represented by the settle- ments of Mokvi and Tarnish. Tarnish is the complex of artificial hills and Mokvi is the settlement on the natural terraces. The Archeological findings resemble the product of the I variant and at the same time it reveals a certain connection with the findings of the III variant settlements. 42 O. Japaridze. Archeology of Georgia, p. 200 (in Georgian); M. Baramidze. East Black Sea Coast . of the same author: On the Problem of the Relations of Colkhis and Coban Cultures, p. 49. 26 Settlement of the III micro local variant (Kistrik, Bombora) are represented with the cultural layers being discovered on the low coastal terraces. Wattle semi dug-outs of the Patskha type are fixed being met in the settlements of the II variant. The buildings of the I variant are the wooden constructions typical for the ethnographical everyday life of the West Georgia. The wooden architecture has the uniform character and does not change throughout the history of Colkhis. In fact, the same can be said about the \"patskha\" with the woven walls and clay coating. 43 During the late bronze period simultaneously with the wooden architecture of the construction of other types practically is not met. An ex- ception is a settlement \" Abaju\" in the village Pirveli Gali, where in the lower layers (8-7* centuries B. C. ) are discovered the trails of the rectangular, open from the west side of the 3-1,6 meter, more than 400 square m. construction being cut in the sandy rock (\"Tiri\"). 44 The like constructions are not known in archeology of Colkhis. Their function is not clear, though the idea, that it was the temporary camp for the cattle run. 45 But, in this case its original construction, special size, usage of the wooden posts in covering etc. is obscure. We can suppose that they were the guar system locking the gorge in the past. This con- struction must have been the ritual one as well. The like picture is stated throughout the whole Colkhis lowland territory. 46 It is worth significance, that in arrangement of the artificial hills a certain peculiarity is observed. One of the hills - the central one- from the very start was dominant. After the example of Pichori settlement is obvious, that the central hill existed during 20 centuries till the beginning of the 3 rd century B. C. ((layers I- VIII). Only in the I part of the I millennium B. C. (layers III -II) the population starts to settle the territory around the hill. By the 9-8 lh centuries B. C. around the central hill 10 artificial hills develop in two rows, in which are mainly presented the layers of the pre-antique. Hellenistic epoch (8-3 rd centuries B. C. ). In this period the settlement already occupies almost 10 hectares of the area. It was a large settlement and according to the modern type it belongs to the settlements of the small village type. The like picture is observed in a number of monuments of Colkhis: Mziuri, Nakargali, Ganmukhuru, Tarnish (Abkhazia), Namarnu, Tskemi, Nosiri, Namcheduri (Colkhis low- land) etc. Around the each hill in Pichori and the whole system there is an artificial ditch, which must have been filled with water from the river Zorgati and in the South-East was con- nected with the Sea. It is significant, that the information by the Greek author of the IVth century Hippocrates is the direct poof of the existence of the Colkhis canals and their usage as road arteries. He says: The houses of the Colchs are built on the water. As mate- rial trees and reed are used. They rarely go on foot, only to town or market. They usually travel in boats up and down the numerous canals. \" 47 It is clear, that the canals play the role of the road arteries, though they probably had another function as well. They was used in the defense system and for drainage. It was multifunctional system. 43 M. Baramidze. Eastern Black Sea Coast..., p. 57-72; T. Chigoshvili.

S-Pb, 1895, p. 58. 27 The system of canals of the Pichori settlement is well preserved and can be seen throughout 4 kilometer extent to the North. On this rout in two kilometers is located an artificial hill \"Djvaralebi\" and in 4 kilometers \"Nakargali. \" From this place the canal sup- posedly turn to the South-East and after 3 kilometrees comes to the Ganmukhuri dwelling complex (5 hills). Then the canal turns to the South to the sea. Thus, it is clear, that 4 syn- chronous to each other settlements ((villages) are located within one system of canals. It is significant, that the canals of that type are fixed in central Colkhis in the Abahsha-Senaki region (Hills Tskhemi-Dzigura-Ketilari and Sangvichio and the system of Namarna in the Lanchkhuti region). The described system of the settled hills shows us, that by the end of the late bronze pe- riod the whole territory of Colkhis - the west Georgia was densely populated. A great area of settlements, system of fortification, producing character of farming, existence of the group of masters of ceramics, mining of the metallurgic ore, toll, weapon and jewel mak- ing point to the fact, that we deal with the protourbanic civilization and signs of the state- political formation. Dozens of necropolises were discovered and studied on the territory of Abkhazia. Among them are worth mentioning such famous clan family necropolises as the Red Warf, Guadikhu, Eshera, Djantukh, Akarmara, Merkheuli, Pichori etc. The fact, that all of them are synchronous is extremely interesting. The chronological frames of those monuments of the 8-5 th centiruesB. C. ypologically belong to the so-called Colch monuments being studied during the decades in Pilauri, Larilari, Brili, Mukhurcha, Ureki, and Ergeta etc. In dating of those monuments one common peculiarity is noticed. Tombs of the late bronze early stage (the second part of the 2 nd mill. B. C. ) Are not yet discovered in the Colkhis lowlands. There are dwelling layers, treasure, occasional findings, necropolis complexes in the mountainous part, but synchronous to them necropolises on the Colkhis lowlands. It is difficult to explain this fact. Researches of problem are the main task of archeology of Colkhis. Without solving it, it is impossible to understand the chronological stratigraphy of the separate monuments. Arising out of these circumstances all the above-mentioned necropolis complexes are sometimes sum- marily dated with the late bronze epoch, which is the source of contradictions. 48 The fact is that the tombs being discovered on the territory of Abkhazia are especially significant with their diversity. There are sandy necropolises with the corpse position, secondary burial ritual, cremation, semi cremation etc. The most significant is the ritual of the sec- ondary burial, characteristic for the Colchian necropolises and spread on the whole terri- tory of Colkhis. 49 In the ethnographical everyday life of Megrelia, Imereti and Abkhazia is testified, that the given burial ritual is equally characteristic for the whole territory of the West Georgia and this points to the fact, that the population was homogeneous on this territory and is the valid source in studying of the problems of the ethnical history of the region. One type of burial is especially peculiar and is spread only to the North- West of Sukhumi and is known with its clay ossuaries. The burial ritual is secondary. This fact is the characteristic sing of the micro local variant of Colkhis culture. This variant is char- acterized by the group of bronze ornaments - radiant beads, animal headed belts, birdlike 48 O. Bgazhba, S. Lacoba. History of Abkhazia, p. 39-41. In this work the late complexes are practically arbitrarily dated with the early period. The total shift of chronology and separate articles belonging to the well-studied types have place. 49 M.

Tb., 1997, p. 13-14 (in Georgian). 28 pendants etc. For this group is typical ceramics of the archaic form, terracotta or grayish color with relief inlayed or carved ornament. Colchian diversely ornamented ceramic production is not numerous. Flint arrow heads, sickle insets, stone grinders, and other are relatively abundant material. Specificity of the region is conditioned by its peripheral location in the Colchian culture. Area of spreading of this group of archeological material includes the region of modern Adler, which is recognized the North border of spreading of the Colchian culture. One of the most specific components of the Colchian culture is the so-called dune set- tlements. They are spread practically along the whole Black Sea Coast, including the ter- ritories of Achara and Abkhazia. The like settlements are discovered and partly studied in Batumi, Kobuleti, Ureki, Kulevi, Gagide, Gagra etc. They are the sandy bank earth wall of 1, 5-3, 5m height, on which several layers (from 203 to 12) of blackish-grey color are fixed. These layers are large spots (40-50 cm. width and 10-15 cm. long). As an exception some monuments have adobe floor (Gudava II). The archeological material discovered in the layers is numerous and homogeneous. \"Tub like\" oval and square vessels with fiber print on the bottom and hornlike or pointed top andrions were discovered. The pottery is rough, with the admixture of sand of the reddish color. Almost all the vessels of tub type have the trails of being in fire. According the accompanying Colchian ceramics and bronze articles those settlements emerged by the beginning of the 8 th century and ceases their existence to the middle of the 6 lh century. In the scientific literature theses settle- ments are considered to be either the salt-works, or having the other function. 50 One part of the researchers even today share this opinion. 51 On the basis of the historical sources and new interpretations of the archeological data. The idea is expressed about the dune settlements as the remains of the metallurgical ore mining work-shops from the magnetite sand. 52 This fact is proved by the existence of the iron ore in the magnetite form practically in all the camps and its processing obtaining from the sand is quite real. 53 This process being restored by A. Ramishvili, probably arises some issues, but the general picture is acceptable and convincing. The fact is that the iron ore is the leading element of the Col- chian culture from ten VHIth century B.C. Though its first appearance on the territory of Abkhazia must have happened earlier this date. It is significant, that the first iron articles are exact replicas of the bronze shapes and are the imitation of the local, Colch bronze shapes. 54 It has to be specially pointed, that the iron metallurgy fully replaced the bronze one. Bronze was used only for the ornaments. Judging from the scale of metallurgic manufacturing, part of the iron ore simultane- ously with the copper ore was the product of change and import. The circumstance, that the most part of the investigators connects the origin of the metallurgy with the name of 50 L. Soloviev.

Tb., 1967. 29 the Kartvelian tribe of the Khalibs has to be taken into consideration. These problems were studied by academician D. Khakhutaishvili. The scientists point to the fact, that the ore metallurgy being emerged in the South Georgia (Guria-Achara, Lower Kartli) must be dated with at least the 14 lh century B. C. 55 It might have happened, that namely from this place spread the iron ore metallurgy to the other regions of Georgia, but not simul- taneously, but in different chronological periods. On the territory of modern Abkhazia its spreading was dated with the beginning of the I millennium B. C. 56 The high level of the iron metallurgy together with the dune camps confirm the existence of the iron smelt- ing work-shops being studied on the territory of Achara-Samegrelo. It is significant, that analogues work-shops are studied in Abkhazia, namely in the Gali region - on the terri- tory of Mziuri. The work-shops of the four iron molding forges with the residue of the metallurgic slag are excavated. Typologically they belong to one and the same type with the forges of Achara, Samegrelo and are obviously simultaneous with the dune camps and can be referred to the preantique period.
