        "text": "At Charles Hutton we’ve set out to create a British inspired watch brand that brings affordability and accessibility to a space too dominated by fully priced luxury pieces. Inspired by timeless British style and design, our watches were created for the ordinary man that’s looking to compliment his own style.\n\nWe’ve made a choice when starting our designs to specialize in chronographs and their complications. This is because of a shared belief within our team that these watches with their complex dials would give us a margin for creativity within a classic DNA. Additionally, we wanted to provide the market with luxury chronographs at affordable prices without sacrificing quality or style. This was a challenge which we’d dare say we managed to overcome.\n\nFor our inspiration, we’ve looked up to the iconic British racing history and the lifestyle that came with it; Lotus, Brabham, Mclaren and Benetton to name a few. With CH you’ll relive the glamour, speed and style that these racing teams symbolized. But we’ve also looked towards the definition of a “gentleman” and constructed our vision around it.\n\nOverall, we’d define ourselves as a brand inspired by the classic British heritage but built for the modern man in a way comparable to today’s James Bond.\n\nWe hope you’ll find something that suits you in our collections. Stay sharp and head to our journal for styling tips and more great fashion advice from our team here at CH.\n\nWe also would love your feedback so don’t hesitate to contact us for any issue or question you might have."
