        "text": "Britain’s financial, arts, and academic communities have lost two more major international figures, with the deaths in January of businessman and philanthropist John Julius Angerstein, 87, and mathematician Charles Hutton, who was 85.\n\nReputedly born to the Russian empress Anna and a British merchant in St Petersburg, John Julius Angerstein spent more than half a century in the insurance business as a broker and underwriter, becoming a key figure at Lloyd’s of London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the wealthiest men in Britain, his fortune enabled him to become an art conoisseur and philanthropist.\n\nMr Angerstein chaired the Jennerian Society for the Extermination of the Small Pox, secured grants from Lloyd’s for the construction of lifeboats and stations, donated о £61,000 to a school for naval orphans, and supported the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor.\n\nAs an art collector Mr Angerstein amassed works by Claude, Rembrandt, Titian, Rubens, Wilkie and Hogarth. There is likely to be considerable jockeying for ownership of the collection after his death.\n\nJohn Julius Angerstein, 1835 – 22 January 1823\n\nThe mathematician Charles Hutton, who has also died, has been hailed by Sir Humphrey Davy as “one of the most able mathematicians of his country and his age”.\n\nBorn in Newcastle to a superintendant of mines, Charles Hutton worked briefly in a colliery but went to school instead after being injured in a street fight. He became a successful teacher and started his own school, applying maths to book-keeping, navigation and surveying."
