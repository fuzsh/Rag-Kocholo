He represented St. John's East in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1894 to 1897 as a Liberal.[1]\n\nThe son of George and Eliza Hutton,[1] he was born in St. John's and was educated at Saint Bonaventure's College, at St. Dunstan's College and at the French college at St. Pierre.[2] He later studied music in England for three years around 1900.[3]\n\nHutton began work as a bookkeeper for Hearn & Company in 1879 and then, in 1883, opened a musical supply business. Until 1894, he ran the business out of his home. In 1880, he became organist and choirmaster for the Roman Catholic cathedral in St. John's. He taught music at Saint Bonaventure's, St. Patrick's Hall and Holy Cross School in St. John's. Hutton also was director for concerts performed by boys from the Mount Cashel Orphanage.[3] He was also co-founder and conductor for the St. John's Choral and Orchestral Society.[1]\n\nHutton published the Newfoundland Folio of Over Fifty Old Favourite Songs in 1906.[1]\n\nHis student and protégé Ignatius Rumboldt became a prominent musician in St. John's.[2]\n\nHutton was elected to the Newfoundland assembly in an 1894 by-election.[1]\n\nIn 1903, he married Antonia \"Tony\" D'Alberti. The couple had four children.[1]\n\nHe was named a knight in the Order of St. Gregory the Great in 1924 and was named to the Order of the British Empire in 1938.[3]\n\nHutton died in St. John's at the age of 87.[1]"
