        "text": "One of my favorite things about learning about my ancestors is discovering ones with whom I share similar traits. For example, my 10th great-grandfather, Dirck Goris Storm, was a skilled writer who penned a history of the Old Dutch Church in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Last year, I discovered a creative streak on another branch of my family tree.\n\nIt started with a little zine from Leodrune Press that mentioned Pennsylvania Dutch folk art, particularly barn stars (often called “hex signs” by outsiders). I knew that a number of my ancestors immigrated from Germany to Pennsylvania; although some of them were Mennonites who probably wouldn’t have engaged in barn decoration, not all of them were. So, I thought it would be interesting to see if there were any barn star motifs particular to my ancestors or the places they lived.\n\nI quickly learned that barn-star styles are determined much more by the artist than by the family that hires someone to paint their barns. There’s a popular misconception that these stars were painted on barns to keep witches away (hence “hex signs”) and protect the livestock inside. Instead, they’re more likely inspired by celestial themes that were common among the Pennsylvania Dutch, both before and after they came to the United States. Other patterns of shapes, such as flowers and hearts, are also common.\n\n(That being said, farmers did hire folk magicians — practitioners of Brauche/Braucherei or “Powwow” — to bless and protect their barns and livestock, and to perform healing spells for sick cattle and other animals. Petitions written on small slips of paper were occasionally found tucked into barn walls and other places, reflecting this practice.)\n\nI didn’t find any barn stars specifically associated with my ancestors, but did find something else: An intricately carved and detailed dower chest made by one of my ancestors’ brothers and nephews.\n\nMy 6th great-grandfather, Conrad Bieber, was born in 1725, probably in Germany. He immigrated to Pennsylvania sometime before 1743. Conrad’s father, Johannes, was also born in Germany and arrived in Pennsylvania in 1739. Conrad had a brother, Jacob, born in 1731 before the family immigrated.\n\nWhile Conrad moved to the Shenandoah Valley in the 1750s to join a Mennonite community there, along with his wife, Maria Magdalena Kneisley, Jacob remained in Pennsylvania, specifically in the Oley Hills area of Berks County, and began a woodworking business with his son, John. I knew I had ancestors from the Oley Hills area, and when I searched for the location and the name Bieber, these beautiful wooden chests popped up.\n\nAn article in Reading Eagle about one of the chests reads, “Thinking that John or Jacob Bieber made a mistake with his compass drawing of a perpendicular hex sign, we noticed that this unusual designed chest had six edelweiss flowers sprouting from three white flat hearts on each corner of the dower chest with the elaborate tulip shaped escutcheon design in the middle. They were not barn stars, but an edelweiss flower theme which spread their flower like petals standing upright in each cheek of the flat hearts! A native Rhineland symbol of love used by John Bieber in the 1780s on his dower chests.”\n\nI recently discovered that GEDmatch allows you to match your DNA against samples from different “archaic” DNA finds, such as Ötzi or the Kennewick man. I thought it would be fun to try it and see what came up.\n\nBefore I talk about my results, let me first explain something about how DNA is measured. Bear with me.\n\nThere’s a unit of measure, the centimorgan*, that you may have heard if you’ve had your DNA analyzed by 23andMe, Ancestry or another service. According to Wikipedia, “One centimorgan corresponds to about 1 million base pairs in humans on average. The relationship is only rough, as the physical chromosomal distance corresponding to one centimorgan varies from place to place in the genome, and also varies between men and women since recombination during gamete formation in females is significantly more frequent than in males. Kong et al. calculated that the female genome is 4460 cM long, while the male genome is only 2590 cM long.”\n\nI know that’s dense, but it’s helpful to understand, because services like 23andMe and GEDmatch figure out who you’re related to based on how much your DNA overlaps with others, and how long your matching segments are. For example, I share 50% of my DNA with my father, across 23 segments (the 23 chromosomes I inherited from him). In total, our shared segments are 3720cM long. By comparison, I share 10% of my DNA with one of my paternal cousins. She and I share 24 segments of DNA, but those shared segments total just 760cM.\n\nAs relations grow more distant, the number of shared segments – and, more significantly, the length of those segments – goes way down. This can be distance across the population (say, how closely related I might be to Kevin Bacon), or across time (how closely related I am to my 6th great-grandfather, Johannes Harbard Winegardner, who was born in Germany in 1718, immigrated to thee U.S. in 1752 and died in Virginia in 1779).\n\nAny match below about 10 cM is dubious (Ancestry uses 8cM), less so if you can trace your and your match’s family tree back to a common ancestor. So the fact that GEDmatch begins matching your DNA against archaic samples at a threshold of .5cM should raise some eyebrows. But these matches allegedly don’t indicate direct lineage – a match with Ötzi doesn’t mean he’s your direct ancestor. Instead, it may just be chance, or it may indicate common migration patterns, meaning your ancestors lived in the same place, at roughly the same time, as these people whose remains we’ve sampled millennia later.\n\nWhen I looked at my “Archaic DNA” matches at .5 cM, I had lots and lots of matches. Knowing they were dubious, I slowly increased the threshold until I still had some matches with several matching segments, and picked out several of those, the ones with the most overlaps, to research further. Here’s what I found, from oldest to most recent.\n\n1. Ust-Ishim, Siberia, 45,000 years ago\n\nThis DNA comes from a femur found in western Siberia, and is the oldest genome for homo sapiens on record. It belonged to a male hunter-gatherer who likely descended from a group who left Africa more than 50,000 years ago to populate other regions, but later went extinct. About 2 percent of his genome came from Neanderthals. You can see an image of the femur here.\n\n2. Bichon, Switzerland, 13,700 years ago\n\nThis DNA comes from the skull of a man found in the Grotte du Bichon, a cave in the Jura Mountains on the French-Swiss border. I love all the detail on this one. His bones were found “intermingled with the bones of a female brown bear, nine flint arrowheads and traces of charcoal.” Evidence suggests that the bear was wounded by arrows and retreated into the cave. The man followed, and made a fire to fumigate the bear from the cave, but was killed by the dying animal.\n\nHe belonged to the Western European hunter-gatherer lineage, based on comparisons to other fossils from the European mesolithic period. He was about 5-foot-five, 130 pounds, muscular, probably right handed, and had a mostly meat-based diet.\n\n3. Kotias, Georgia, 9,700 years ago\n\nThis DNA comes from a man who was buried in Kotias Klde cave in the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia. He was one of a previously unknown group of hunter-gatherers in the Caucasus, and their DNA survives in many of today’s Europeans. He shares some DNA with the later Yamnaya culture across Europe, a semi-nomadic people known for burying their dead in pits with stelae and animal offerings, and often covered in ochre. You can see the Kotias skeleton here.\n\n4. Loschbour, Luxembourg, 8,000 years ago\n\nThis man’s skeleton was found in 1835 under a rock shelter in Mullerthal, in eastern Luxembourg. He was part of European hunter-gatherer culture, and represented a transition between the dark skin of our African forebears and the light skin of many modern Europeans. His DNA reveals an “intermediate” skin tone, brown or black hair, and probably blue eyes. He was 5-foot-3, about 130 pounds, and was lactose-intolerant. He died in his mid-30s. Flint tools were found with his remains, and the cremated remains of another person, probably an adult woman, were found nearby. Her bones showed signs of scraping, suggesting that her bones were defleshed before burning. You can see the man’s skeleton here.\n\n5. Stuttgart, Germany, 7,000 years ago\n\nThis DNA belonged to a person who was part of the Linearbandkeramik (Linear Pottery Ceramic) culture that was prominent in Germany during the Neolithic period. This culture – and this individual – were farmers, growing emmer and einkorn wheat, crab apples, peas, lentils, flax, poppies and barley. They raised some animals, including cows and sheep, and lived in small villages of longhouses near waterways.\n\n6. Ballynahatty, Northern Ireland, 5,200 years ago\n\nThis DNA comes from the remains of a Neolithic woman found in a tomb chamber in Ballynahatty, near Belfast, in Northern Ireland. Her genes are similar to modern people from Spain and Sardinia, but her ancestors likely came to Europe from the Middle East. She was lactose-intolerant and carried a genetic variant for hemochromatosis, which can cause excessive iron retention.\n\n7. Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland, 4,000 years ago\n\nThis DNA comes from one of two male skeletons found on Rathlin Island, just north off the coast of Northern Ireland. Unlike the woman found in Ballynahatty, these Bronze Age men could digest milk and their genetics are more aligned with modern Irish, Scottish and Welsh peoples. A third of their DNA came from ancient cultures who lived in the Pontic Steppe, a region now divided between Russia and Ukraine. Both men carried a variant for hemochromatosis, but a different one from the Ballynahatty woman. Ireland’s modern population has one of the highest frequencies of lactase persistence, as well as hemochromatosis. I’m partly Irish – 4%, according to Ancestry, and 79% British and Irish, according to 23andMe – and carry both of these variants.\n\nIf nothing else, this exploration has allowed me to learn more about some early DNA finds, as well as what they mean for the migration patterns of my ancestors before they turned into the Northwestern European residents I can trace through genealogical records. It’s fascinating, and as always, I’m tempted to visit some of these places to see what it feels like to stand on the same ground.\n\n*Named after American biologist and geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan, born in 1866, part of a line of Southern plantation owners and enslavers on his father's side. He was a nephew of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan.\n\nTop photo: Linearbandkeramik Culture farmhouse, photographed by Hans Splinter. (CC BY-ND 2.0)\n\nOne of the fun things about tracing one’s family tree is occasionally coming across well-known people who shaped our cultural history in some way. Of course, you have to be careful; genealogy sites are full of crowdsourced information, much of it duplicated across family trees without fact-checking. But if you follow the actual documentation, occasionally you find you’re related to someone people write Wikipedia articles or even books about.\n\nI discovered recently that D. is distantly related to Stephen Bachiler, who was D’s 10th great-grandfather. What first caught my attention was discovering that one of D’s ancestors was buried on Halloween, 1656, in the infamous Bedlam Burial Ground in London. I have deep interests in London, cemeteries and historical treatments for mental illness, so discovering something like this makes my brain all kinds of curious. But when I looked Bachilor up online, I learned a lot more.\n\nBachiler was born June 23, 1561, attended Oxford University and was one of its early graduates. In 1587 he became the vicar of Wherwell, Hampshire, England, but was kicked out in 1605 because he was too Puritanical for the changing tastes of the British monarchy. He married four times. The first was Ann Bates, in 1589; they had six children together, including Theodate Bachiler (D’s ninth great-grandmother), who married Christopher Hussey and became one of the early settlers of New Hampshire. Christian Weare became Bachiler’s second wife in 1623; she died three years later, and then he married Helena Mason in 1627. I’ll get to his fourth wife in a moment.\n\nIn 1630, Bachiler was a member of the Company of Husbandmen, in London. They formed the Plough Company and secured a 1,600-square-mile land grant in Maine. They named it Lygonia, after Lygonia for Cecily Lygon, mother of New England Council president Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and Bachiler was going to be its leader and minister. He and Helena sailed to North America in 1632 and landed in Massachusetts, but by then the plans to establish Lygonia had already been abandoned. Puritan lawyer and leader John Winthrop later said that once the Plough Company families arrived and got a look at the land for themselves, they didn’t like it and settled elsewhere.\n\nBachiler bounced around New England for several years, establishing a church in Lynn (then Saugus), Massachusetts, where he managed to piss off the Puritan theocracy in Boston, apparently because of \"his contempt of authority” and some sort of church “scandal.” Back in England, Bachiler and his son Stephen were sued by a local clergyman after they allegedly wrote “scandalous verse” about him and had been singing these songs around the village. But the scandal in Massachusetts was over something that eventually became a core American value: the separation of church and state. From his early days in England, Bachiler called for a “holy house without ceremonies,” a church free from the state’s control. In October of 1632, Winthrop was the governor of the state (the literal opposite of a separation between church and state) and had Bachiler arraigned for his stance on the church and state issue, forbidding him from “exercising his gifts as a pastor … until some scandles be removed.”\n\nBachiler later moved to Newbury, New Hampshire, with Theodate and Christopher, where they established a plantation at Winnacunnet. Bachiler named the town Hampton when the town was incorporated in 1639, and is credited as its founder. In 1644, Bachiler was invited to become minister of a new church in Exeter, Massachusetts, but that fell through when the state’s General Court postponed the establishment of a new church there. He returned to New Hampshire, working as a missionary in Strawbery Banke (now Portsmouth) and, in 1648, he married Mary Beedle. Three years later, she was indicted and sentenced for adultery with a neighbor, potentially inspiring the character of Hester Prynne in “The Scarlet Letter.”\n\nEven so, the courts would not grant Bachiler a divorce. He returned to England in 1653, where he died on Oct. 28, 1656. He was buried three days later in what was then called the New Churchyard, a municipal cemetery in London next door to Bethlem Hospital, known for housing and (debatably) caring for the mentally ill. An estimated 20,000 people were buried in this plot of land in the 16th and 17th centuries, but city development eventually overtook the area. Headstones were removed and a few graves were relocated, but many more remain. Today this cemetery is located beneath the Liverpool Street Crossrail station, about a half-mile north of the Tower of London.\n\nIf you enjoyed this and would like even more detail on the life of Stephen Bachiler, check out this 1961 article by Philip Mason Marston, Professor of History and Chairman of the Department at the University of New Hampshire.\n\nMAN-MADE CAVERN\n\nBy Bill Arter\n\nPhotos by Jack Hutton\n\nColumbus Dispatch Magazine\n\nSunday, October 31, 1965\n\nTHERE'S this big stone wall with a great big solid-oak door with great, huge iron hinges and iron all over it, right down at the bottom of the bluff in the woods.\" Thus, all in a rush and with little by way of introduction, began my young son. At least he was young then; it's been more than 20 years ago. Having caught my interest, he proceeded from allegedly observed fact to hearsay: \"The kids say it leads into a cave that runs all around and has big stone rooms and everything and finally runs right up into that rich guy's basement.\". \"What rich guy?\" I asked, more or less idly, being convinced that young Bill had been having his leg pulled. \"The guy that invented Ethyl gas,\" he replied. “You know, the big white house with the swimming pool that sets way back from Wilson Bridge Road.\"I began to feel a flicker of interesting hope that this wonderful tale might be true.\n\nCertainly our neighbor, Tom Midgley, could afford a private cavern, if he wanted it. And, as it turned out, he had wanted it and he did have it every bit as grand as the description. Thomas Midgley came by his inventiveness naturally. His father, born in London, England, was an inventor and natural mechanic who contributed a great deal to the development and manufacturing of bicycles. He came to America at an early age and was living in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania when Thomas was born May 19, 1889. The family soon moved to Columbus where his father became superintendent of the old Columbus Bicycle Company. Young Tom grew up here; he attended Hubbard and Fifth Avenue schools and graduated from old North High School.\n\nHe went on to graduate from Cornell in 1911 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Surprisingly, his most significant inventions were in another field altogether--in chemistry.\n\nTom's first job was with the National Cash Register Company in Dayton. Then he and his father took a flyer--establishing the short-lived Midgley Tire & Rubber Company in Lancaster. The enterprise was not a success but it left Tom with a life-long interest in rubber--and in chemistry. Years later (and well before the critical, wartime need) he did tremendously significant work toward developing synthetic rubber. He was working at the time for the General Motors Chemical Company.\n\nIn 1916 he joined Charles Kettering at General Motors Research. It was to be a lifelong association and “Boss Ket\" shares the glory for some of Tom's greatest developments. Tom's two most celebrated (and personally profitable) inventions were tetraethyl lead additive to make the familiar. Ethyl gasoline and freon, the first safe refrigerant. In his short career he was granted more than 100 patents, including one for extracting bromine from sea water--to break a bottleneck in the production of Ethyl gasoline. He was showered with professional honors. He became president of the American Chemical Society, received honorary doctorates from two universities and won five important medals for scientific achievement.\n\nIn 1929 he came back to Columbus. Up along Wilson Bridge Road, between High Street and the Olentangy River Road he built a stately Colonial home. In spite of its immense size be installed a complete air-conditioning system, perhaps not the first such in all the land. He intended it for a retirement home for his father but made it his own home, too. He was there very little, dividing most of his time between Dayton, Detroit, Washington and New York.\n\nThe house was hardly completed when the great depression began. Midgley hired as many men as he could possibly use, building roads, landscaping and otherwise furbishing his estate. But, finally, everything was complete. The distress of the jobless still worried him. Then he had his great idea.\n\nHe had shared with most boys a feeling of fascination for caves. As he cast about for ways to make work, the old lure beckoned. The very immersity of what he envisioned was its chief advantage. It would take a lot of men a long time to dig and line with stone a system of caverns and rooms ranging inside the big bluff behind his house. And it would take a lot of money, which Midgley had. He lost no time getting on with the project.\n\nTed Severance, who now lives on nearby Worthington-Galena Road, was Midgley's estate manager. He became superintendent of what a lot of people thereabout considered the craziest project of all time. Some of them criticized Midgley for pouring good money into a \"gigantic anthill.\" But most were gratefully aware that it was Tom's way of sharing his wealth--that the cavern was, in truth, a byproduct.\n\nTed recalls that the job took more than a year to complete, and that as many as 50 men at a time burrowed and dug to create two separate caverns (that were finally joined) and special rooms. The vaulted ceilings, the walls and floors were all built of limestone, blue and white, from nearby quarries. Ted and his father laid it all with meticulous care. The wrought-iron hardware – hinges, straps, bolts and candle sconces--were made by Mr. Kirker, a skilled Worthington blacksmith. At last the great undertaking was completed and things were back to normal.\n\nTom Midgley, it is said, got his money's worth out of the astonishment of his guests. It was his custom to invite them to the baronial-size recreation room and then swing open a heavy door at one end. Inside was a stone-lined room with a candle guttering in a grinning skull. With guests trailing in open mouthed wonder, he'd lead the way through another great door and, via vaulted passageways and endless steps, start the tour by candlelight. Visitors from all parts of the world came away wondering if they had really seen it or only dreamed of those tombless catacombs beneath peaceful Ohio soil.\n\nMidgley continued his ceaseless professional activities until suddenly, in 1940, he contracted polio. Soon his legs were practically useless. Even so he continued to be the scientist. In 1942 he addressed the National Inventors' Council on behalf of the war effort from his home, via closed-circuit radio. For himself he invented a system of harness and slings so that he could move from bed to wheelchair with the strength of his arms. It was his final and fatal invention.\n\nThursday morning, November 2, 1944, his wife found him strangled by his own device. Thomas Midgley died at 55.\n\nIn 1945, the beautiful Midgley estate was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Gail Winegarner. They had fallen in love with its spacious grounds and house but, even more importantly, they saw in it the perfect place to raise their five active sons. It has proved to be everything they desired.\n\nMore than a year ago I was passing the estate and, on sudden impulse, drove back its long, curving driveway to the house. I was received most kindly by Mr. Winegarner. I told him how much I always admired the place and said I'd like to make a painting of it. To my dismay he answered that I'd have to get on with it; that it would all be destroyed when the north Outerbelt went through. The distressing news brought to my mind the never personally confirmed story of the caves. Somewhat diffidently I asked if the famous “catacombs” really did exist. He assured me that they did and asked me if I'd like to inspect them. I jumped at the chance.\n\nThe pictures tell of what I saw. But they can't possibly convey the weird and wonderful sensation it was to step from the brilliantly lighted home into a gloomy cave, lighted by a glinting electric torch ahead, with inky blackness closing in behind. We traversed all of its many levels and explored all the passageways and rooms before returning to the house. Once there I asked eagerly if I might do a story about the caves for The Sunday Magazine. Mr. Winegarner smiled a rueful smile and said, “Not until the bulldozers are at our door.\" Then he explained why: Years ago the Winegarners became aware that the huge door to the cave at the foot of the bluff had been forced. They learned it by investigating noises from the caverns. They learned that boys (strong, well equipped boys) had been unable to resist the challenge of thię mysterious door. It developed that they had grown bolder and bolder, roistering in the caves and even trying to force their way into the house. A final blow came during a court hearing. It concerned a youthful gang that was accused of stealing. There was testimony that the gang had made the cave their headquarters and had hidden their loot in it.\n\nStronger bars on the bottom door didn't stop the intrusions. It was literally destroyed. The best estimate Mr. Winegarner could get for building a duplicate was $400. And then the bidder backed out.\n\nDetermined to stop the prowling, the Winegarners closed the lower entrance with a masonry wall. To their utter amazement and chagrin, the new wall was attacked with crowbars and sledgehaṁmers before the mortar was dry and soon pulled down. A second and far more formidable wall, at last, foiled the would-be trespassers. Not long afterward the family investigated noises down in the ravine and discovered evidence that an especially determined gang had been attempting to blast through the new wall. The presence of the alluring novelty became a real tribulation.\n\nWhen Jack Hutton and I returned to the cave to take these pictures, Mrs. Winegarner added a new chapter to the vandalism saga. Quite recently she smelled smoke in the house and traced it to the rapidly filling recreation room. She then discovered that a second level door to the cave, halfway up the bluff had been forced (the door literally torn from its hinges) and that kids had built a roaring fire in one of the passageways. She insisted that a deputation of them come up to the house and see what was happening to the smoke.\n\nWith the second door gone, uninvited visitors have prowled the caves at all hours. Jack and I noted, just inside the forced entrance, a cache of matches and candles tucked between the stones. The Winegarners, before final destruction of the house, almost gave up trying to keep out trespassers; their concern being the danger of someone's being hurt. For that reason, primarily, they wanted no further publicity for the catacombs before roadwork began.\n\nI could, of course, understand their feeling. Thus I kept my peace until now. The bulldozers will have started laying bare Tom Midgley's caverns by the time this appears in print and one of the strangest examples of privately financed welfare projects will be gone for good.\n\nOne branch of my family tree includes many folks who were among the first settlers of the legendary town of Sleepy Hollow in New York. Even better, their family name was Storm.\n\nA side note before we get started: Sleepy Hollow wasn’t always called Sleepy Hollow. The little village north of Tarrytown was most often called North Tarrytown from its incorporation in the late 19th century until 1996, when it officially changed its name, staking its claim to the Washington Irving story.\n\nOne of my earliest ancestors to settle in Sleepy Hollow (in Haudenosaunee territory) was my 10th great-grandfather, Dirck Goris (or Gorisszen) Storm. He was born in 1630 in Leiden, in the Netherlands. He married Maria van Montfoort in 1655, and they had a son, my 9th great-grandfather, Gregoris Storm, in 1656. The family, including two other children, traveled to North America in 1662; Maria gave birth to a daughter during the journey.\n\nBefore arriving in North America, Storm had served as the Town Clerk for Oss, in the Netherlands. When they arrived by boat -- at the foot of Wall Street in Manhattan -- Storm became involved in local affairs right away. He owned property, including a tavern on Beaver Street, and later served as Town Clerk for communities in Brooklyn. In 1670 he became Secretary of the Colony. In 1691 the British sent him north to Tappan, where he became the first Secretary and Clerk of the Sessions for Orange County, New York. Later that decade, Dirck and Maria were recorded as members of the Old Dutch Church in Sleepy Hollow, not long after the church was built.\n\nSleepy Hollow was well established by 1820 when Washington Irving -- who had lived in nearby Tarrytown and socialized in Sleepy Hollow -- wrote his famous short story about the Headless Horseman. The character of Katrina Van Tassel was inspired by a flesh-and-blood daughter of the Van Tassel family. Although historians believe the actual girl was Eleanor Van Tassel; her aunt, Catriena, inspired the name. Eleanor’s grandparents were Jacob Van Tassel and Aeltie Alberts Storm. They married in 1724 in the First Reformed Church of Tarrytown.\n\nDirck Goris Storm’s descendants remained in and around Sleepy Hollow for generations. Gregoris lived in North Tarrytown much of his life and is also buried in the Sleepy Hollow cemetery. Likewise his son, Derck Storm, who was born in 1695 and died in about 1762. His son, Hendrick, was born in 1709 and lived until 1793; his son, Gregorus, was born in 1731, baptised in North Tarrytown, and lived until 1807. Most or all have headstones in Sleepy Hollow. (So does Washington Irving.)\n\nThe latter Gregorus Storm and his wife, Jannitje Williams, had at least three children, including my 5th great-grandmother, Mary Storms, who was born in 1760 in Haverstraw, just up the Hudson River (and on the other bank) from Sleepy Hollow. It’s unclear to me why she went by Storms instead of Storm; her brothers, Jacobus and Johannis, didn’t. Mary married Joseph Allison in 1781 and they had 11 children together. Mary died in 1829. The Allison lineage carried down to my grandmother, Frances Allison Nesbitt, whose middle name comes from that line.\n\nAs with the other ancestors I’ve written about, I’d love to visit Sleepy Hollow, walk the streets they may have walked, visit their bones at the Sleepy Hollow cemetery, and find out just how haunted the village really is.\n\nBlacks who are descended from enslaved people face unfair challenges when they try to trace their ancestry. It wasn’t until the 1870 census, in the United States, that many enslaved black Americans were counted as free people, and by their first and last names. Before that, the genealogical path becomes one of piecing together the 1860 and 1850 slave schedules and the wills or sale receipts of their enslavers, who may have listed them only by first name and age.\n\nMuch of my maternal line came over from Western Europe and settled in the Southern part of the U.S. by the early 1700s, and almost every branch includes one or more enslavers. I’ve done my best to document these enslavers, and the people they enslaved, in the hope that it might make the road easier for their descendants, hoping to find out more about where and who they came from.\n\nThe information in this post is everything I have been able to find, to date, on these people, but please reach out if you have questions.\n\nFor more help researching enslaved ancestors, I highly recommend the Facebook group I’ve Traced my Enslaved Ancestors and their Owners."
