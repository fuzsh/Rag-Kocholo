        "text": "The earliest information I have on George and Charles Hutton comes from George’s Revolutionary War Pension papers.George was in York County Pennsylvania in 1773 and in 1775.He enlisted in Colonel Thomas Hartley's regiment and served in the Pennsylvania Line - Final tour of duty against Indians on Upper Susquehanna in late 1778 - Some point in time he moved to Mason County, Kentucky and was on the tax list in 1800.In 1808 George was in Nile Township, Scioto County, Ohio.He died in Nile Twp., Scioto Co., Ohio in 1842.In 1840 he was living in the home of John Patton.There is a connection between John Patton and George Hutton but I have not determined what it is.In an affidavit signed by Sarah Patton, she states that she was at the house of the said George Hutton in York County in the State of Pennsylvania when he enlisted as a soldier in the Company commanded by Capt John Forrester and when he with the rest of the Company were marched by Capt Forrester for Little York.And was present upon his return 3 years later.\n\nCharles may have served in the war but because he never drew a pension there is no record of him serving.Harold Hutton in his book “History and Genealogy of the Hutton Family” states on page 174;\"It is practically certain that Charles Hutton met Ruth, his wife-to-be in York County.When and where they were married is not known.In 1786 they were living near Fort Ligonier: their first child was born while they were still in Pennsylvania.Before the decade was out they were on their way down the Ohio by flatboat.It appears that there was a stopover of uncertain length on the Virginia side of the river.During that time some children were born; then they went on to Tennessee and settled near Nashville.Here the rest of the children were born.In 1801 Charles bought land west of Nashville on Indian Creek, a minor tributary of the Cumberland River.Here he lived out his remaining years.He made his will on January 12, 1813: it was presented in court in the January session and approved for record.\n\nRuth, wife of Charles Hutton, stated on an affidavit that she was acquainted with George Hutton in York County , Pennsylvania two years (1773) before the Revolutionary War.And in the year of the Declaration of Independence she knows that the said George Hutton enlisted for three years in a company commanded by Capt. John Forrester of the Regiment of Col. Hartley and Division under the Command of General Wayne.\n\nMy information has been gathered over the past 40 years, from research, personal interviews with family members, letters, pictures, bibles and through contacts with all the special “cousins” I have found or have found me over the Internet who so graciously supplied me with information and pictures on their Hutton family line.\n\nI have researched both George and Charles’ descendants because they are both my 5th Great-grandfathers.George’s son Charles P. married his cousin Mary, daughter of his Uncle Charles.\n\nPlease do not accept the information on this site as gospel.Some of the information I received from family I have proved wrong through my own research.I am very open to new information and gladly will make corrections if I have made errors in the information I have on the family."
