        "text": "My only real connection to Brazil is by marriage and through my son Rafael's birth certificate. Other than that, passport stamps aside, I'm as gringo as they come, sadly perhaps. What's always puzzled me about Brazil though, alongside how anyone could bear to watch the staggeringly mind-numbing television there, is why people are content to rely on authors who are long dead to put forward as the country's literary base?\n\nHistorically, Brazil can point to a proud and enviable literary heritage among Latin American countries. Though largely influenced by European trends on account of the successive waves of immigrants, the foundation of the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1896 saw its dominance on the continent asserted. Of that era, Macedo, Machado and Alencar are still celebrated as the country's finest literary triumvirate, having endowed its national spirit during the formative years of post-colonial rule with their literary affirmations of its independence. Even the political decision to relocate the nation's capital from bustling Rio de Janeiro to a patch of tropical wasteland now known as Brasilia, completed in 1960, derived its cultural legitimation from an 18th century futurist prophecy by the Italian Catholic writer Don Bosco. Decades of dictatorship and political violence have left their impression on several generations of writers, but what now?\n\nOn the face of it, Brazil's literature in translation should be thriving. After all, to our British eyes, all we know of the country is the fact that you can apparently buy books from vending machines in Sao Paulo subway stations and there's a rather nice literary festival held each year in the Rio state beach town of Parati, run by the avowedly Brasilophile Liz Calder of Bloomsbury publishers fame. We're content to propagate stereotypes in London through bars like Favela Chic and showings of films about Afro-Reggae at the ICA, but we're unable to form a literary understanding about the country through the eyes of its own inhabitants, not least because of the sheer lack of translations of Brazilian novels available in England. Of those actually available here, most tend to reflect the country's independence era in the 19th century or the likes of the late Jorge Amado and Clarice Lispector. The recent Salon \"guide\" to the country merely fell back on the stock of long dead authors, as if to suggest that no one in Brazil, other than cheesemeister Paulo Coelho, can be bothered to write anymore. Bloomsbury's recent City of God by Paulo Lins was already a blockbuster film and only made it into translation a decade after its original publication, possibly mounting an argument that the country's cultural vibrancy often works better on the screen than on the page. But such thinking denigrates the work of younger writers, who for economic reasons, don't make it across the Atlantic - though they should.\n\nThe country's turbulent political history, not to mention its national vices and sporting prowess, lends itself to non-fiction, with works such as Peter Robb's A Death in Brazil and Alex Bellos' Futebol (both published here by Bloomsbury, incidentally) finding a receptive audience overseas. But non-fiction's gain is fiction's loss, as prominent younger Brazilian novelists would struggle to get recognised by their own embassy if they ever set foot in London. That's not to say that there aren't writers willing to take on subjects like poverty, entrenched police corruption and sex - rock star-cum-author Clarah Averbuck for one - but they never make it as far as the translator's hard drive. It's not all samba and football either, most English readers would recognise the profoundly Iberian-influenced style that many younger Brazilian writers employ.\n\nOn top of the issues worth writing about, the hum of Brazilian daily life, its physical environment is a literary wet dream. The concrete structures in the areas of the country where Oscar Niemeyer was allowed to impose his feminine take on brutalism (check out those curves), most notably Sao Paulo and Brasilia, are positively Ballardian in the impression they carve into visitors. I look forward to one day reading about them rather than just seeing them from a firmly wound up car window."
