        "text": "While carrying out research to prepare his master's thesis, defended in 2010 at Unicamp, on the fictional production of the young Machado de Assis, Rodrigo Camargo de Godoi came across a character often cited in historiography, but until then little studied: the typographer , black bookseller and publisher Francisco de Paula Brito. Once the work was completed, the historian decided to take Paula Brito's trajectory as the topic of his doctoral thesis, also defended at the University, in 2014. This second study gave rise to the book An editor in the Empire: Francisco de Paula Brito (1809-1861), which will be launched on April 11th, starting at 19pm, at Livraria da Vila, at Galleria Shopping, in Campinas.\n\nBefore the launch of the book, on the same day, starting at 16pm, in the Congregation Room of the Institute of Philosophy and Human Sciences (IFCH), the author will participate in a round table that will discuss the work of editors in XNUMXth century Brazil. Professors Márcia Abreu, from the Institute of Language Studies (IEL), and Silvia Hunold Lara, from IFCH, will also take part in the debate.\n\nEdited by the Editora da Universidade de São Paulo (Edusp), the volume corresponds to the content of Godoi's thesis. “However, I made an effort to write a book accessible to all people who are interested in history, more specifically about the history of the press and books in Brazil”, highlights the author. Godoi’s work is included in the segment that experts call “historical biography”.\n\nIn his book, the author brings to light aspects of Paula Brito's professional career, but also of her involvement with social and political issues that marked Rio de Janeiro and Brazil in the first half of the 20th century. According to the historian, the editor was the son and grandson of freed slaves. “Paula Brito was part of a black intelligentsia that was born between the end of the 30th century and the first decade of the XNUMXth century. Young black people who were between XNUMX and XNUMX years old during Brazil's Independence process. In other words, understanding the citizenship of 'men of color' in the empire permeates the study of the paths to freedom in the Colony”, reports Godoi.\n\nAccording to the historian, one of Paula Brito's first professional activities was as a typographer, a relatively new job in Brazil, given that the press arrived late in the country, starting in 1808. “Paulo Brito joined the Tipografia Nacional as a typographer's apprentice. It is important to remember that this was a specialized role, which required a good command of the Portuguese language, which was not a problem for a young man from a family of ex-slaves who was already literate.”\n\nThe entrepreneurial profile of the character biographed by Godoi would only emerge at the beginning of the 1830s, when Paula Brito bought the bookstore from her cousin, the brown Silvino José de Almeida, and later transformed it into one of the largest printing houses of the Second Reign, having the emperor D. Pedro II and Empress Tereza Cristina among its shareholders. At that time, bookstores operated as “haberdashery stores”, selling soap, cigars, wallets and, obviously, books and periodicals.\n\nFollowing a movement that took place almost simultaneously in other cities, such as Boston, Paris and New York, Paula Brito began publishing in Rio de Janeiro shortly before founding her Empresa Typográfica Dous de December. Later, it was elevated to the status of one of the largest graphics parks in Rio de Janeiro. “At that moment, Paula Brito realized that she needed to invest in Brazilian writers who wrote narratives about Brazilian themes. Only in this way would he be able to stand out in a publishing market marked by the massive consumption of French narratives.” In the 1840s, the chosen writer was Antonio Gonçalves Teixeira e Sousa, also of African descent. Machado de Assis would appear in the publisher's catalogs at the end of the 1850s, according to the book's author.\n\nTo achieve prominence as an editor, points out Godoi, Paula Brito got closer to the political elite of the time, especially active members of the Conservative Party, which gave her advantages such as access to financing for her projects. “An important aspect to highlight is that Paula Brito’s company was born at the moment when the slave business was being dismantled in Brazil. In 1850, when the transatlantic slave trade was definitively abolished, immense capital became inactive. A substantial part of these resources was then allocated to the creation of several limited and anonymous companies in Rio de Janeiro, including Empresa Dous de Outubro”.\n\nThe success of Dous de December lasted until 1857, when the company went bankrupt. Paula Brito tried to rebuild her business by applying for loans from the government, but was unsuccessful. “He died in 1861, leaving many debts to his widow, Rufina Rodrigues da Costa Brito”. According to Godoi, Paula Brito's trajectory helps to broaden the understanding of several episodes in Brazilian history, such as the formation of black intellectuals, the constitution of the first laws relating to the press and the reconversion of capital from the slave trade, applied to the creation of several businesses, one of them that of Paula Brito. “What I tried to do was precisely contribute to the construction of knowledge around these themes, drawing on the experiences of such a rich character”, concludes the historian.\n\nService\n\nDegree: An editor in the Empire: Francisco de Paula Brito (1809-1861)\n\nAuthor Rodrigo Camargo de Godoi\n\nPublishing company: edusp\n\npages: 392"
