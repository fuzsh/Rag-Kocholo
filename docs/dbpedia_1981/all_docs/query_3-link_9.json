        "text": "Inspired by similar lists of movies and books in the United States, Rio's weekly magazine Manchete asked a group of eight experts from Rio and São Paulo to present their 50 favorite novels produced this century by Brazilian writers. Grande Sertão: Veredas by João Guimarães Rosa came in first with 315 points out of a possible 400, just slightly ahead of Mário de Andrade's Macunaíma. with 300.\n\nBorn June 3, 1908 in Cordisburgo state of Minas Gerais, Rosa, the greatest Brazilian author since Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis (1839-1908), came from a wealthy patrician family. He earned a medical degree and worked as a doctor and a diplomat before publishing in 1946 his first book, Sagarana, a collection of short stories. Grande Sertão: Veredas (Big Backlands: Pathways, The Devil to Pay in the Backlands in the American translation) was published in 1956.\n\nRosa was responsible for inventing a new language mixing regional slang to Indian dialects and modern and archaic Portuguese and foreign languages. Grande Sertão: Veredas is the pinnacle of this accomplishment. The novel's story is an endless monologue told in the first person by Riobaldo, an ex-bandit, who with unfinished sentences and invented words recalls what happened to him and sexually-ambiguous character Diadorim in the backlands, starting at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nHe died at his home in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, on November 19, 1967, of a heart attack just three days after being formally received at the Academia Brasileira de Letras. The author, who had a nearly fatal heart attack in 1962 was chosen in 1963 to become an \"immortal\", but refused to join the other 39 members of the Academy of Letter fearing \"the emotion of the moment.\"\n\nA sample from Grande Sertão: Veredas extracted from the episode known as the \"Slaughter of the Ponies,\" which was eliminated from the US translation:\n\n\"I can't remember how many days and nights it was. I'd say six, but I may be telling a lie. And if I hit on five or four, I may be telling a whopper. I only know it was a long time. It dragged on for years, sometimes I think. And at other times, when I consider the problem, in a different light, I think it just flitted by, in the whiz of a minute that seems unreal to me now, like a squabble between two hummingbirds.... We were trapped inside that house, which had become an easy target. Do you know how it feels to be trapped like that and have no way out?... I can tell youand say this to you so you'll truly believe itthat old house protected us grudgingly: creaking with complaint, its dark old rooms fumed. As for me. I got to thinking that they were going to level the whole works, all four corners of the whole damn property. But they didn't. They didn't, as you are soon to see. Because what's going to happen is this: you're going to hear de whole story told.\"\n\nModern\n\nTimes\n\nMário de Andrade (1893-1945) was the most important representative of the modernist movement in literature at the first half of the century in Brazil. After studying at the São Paulo Conservatory of Music and Drama he dedicated himself to learn about Brazilian myths and folklore. His book of verses, Paulicéia Desvairada (Insane São Paulo), came out in 1922, the same year of the Week of Modern Art, a mark in the Brazilian culture. Macunaíma, the book elected as second in this list, was published in 1928. The \"hero without a character\" as Andrade calls Macunaíma, was inspired by an Amazonian folk hero. The book is a patchwork of Brazilian myths and legends including those from Indians, Blacks and European immigrants, written in an invented language. The title character's motto: \"Oh, but I feel so tired.\" While the book is now hailed as a masterpiece, when it was first published at Andrade's expense, critics and the public alike dismissed it as too hermetic and obscene.\n\nCompleting the list's top-ten literary works we have:\n\n3. Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma (Policarpo Quaresma's Sad End) by Lima Barreto (283 points)\n\n4. São Bernardo (Saint Bernard) by Graciliano Ramos (271)\n\n5. O Tempo e o Vento (The Time and the Wind) by Érico Veríssimo (247)\n\n6. Memorial de Maria Moura (Maria Moura's Notebook by Rachel de Queiroz (242)\n\n7. Menino de Engenho (Sugar Mill Boy) by José Lins do Rego (238)\n\n8. Fogo Morto (literally Dead Fire, means a mill that stopped working) also by José Lins do Rego (208)\n\n9. Memórias Sentimentais de João Miramar (João Miramar's Sentimental Memories) by Oswald de Andrade (192)\n\n10. Vidas Secas (Barren Lives) by Graciliano Ramos (180)\n\nPolicarpo Quaresma, who gives name to the third book in the list, is a tragicomic ultranationalist hero. Lima Barreto (1881-1922) initially published the story in 1911 in installments in Rio's Jornal do Commercio, as a feuilleton. The book would only appear four years later.\n\nInternationally-renowned Baiano (from Bahia) writer Jorge Amado is the champion of appearance in the list with his works mentioned five times although he first appears on 25th place with Capitães da Areia (Sand Captain). He is remembered again from 29th to 32nd places with Terras do Sem Fim (Endless Lands), Jubiabá, Gabriela Cravo e Canela (Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon), and Mar Morto (Dead Sea).\n\nThe list covers the whole century. The oldest book chosen is Euclides da Cunha's Os Sertões (Rebellion in the Backlands) from 1902, and the most recent Quase Memória (Almost Memory) by Carlos Heitor Cony, published in 1995.\n\nOversights and overratings are de rigueur in such lists. Two of the more conspicuous are the absence of Machado de Assis, Brazil's greatest writer ever, from the top ten, and the low rating (a 24th place) given Euclides da Cunha's Os Sertões, which is considered by many the best book written in Brazil this century. There is an explanation for both cases though.\n\nMachado de Assis (1839-1908) published the majority of his books and the best ones like Dom Casmurro (Dom Casmurro) and Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas (The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas) in the 19th century. The only two released this century were Memorial de Aires (Aires's Notebook) and Esaú e Jacó (Esau and Jacob). The latter, published in 1904, obtained a 12th place and was the number one in three of the lists presented to Manchete by the jurors.\n\nAs for Os Sertões it seems that critics still don't know how to classify the masterpiece, presented as an extensive news report by some and as fiction by others. And how to explain that a genial author like Curitibano (from Curitiba, capital of Paraná) Dalton Trevisan who only writes short stories found a place among the chosen with Vampiro de Curitiba (Curitiba's Vampire)? No explanation there. The juror just wanted to recognize a great writer. And they probably will contribute to divulge authors that few people know nowadays, people like Dionélio Machado, Cornélio Pena, Octavio de Faria, and Armando Fontes.\n\nBy the way it would be hard to find a more qualified jury, which was composed of eight recognized writers and critics from Rio and São Paulo: Ivan Ângelo, Ignácio de Loyola Brandão, Carlos Heitor Cony, Roberto Freire, Leyla Perrone-Moysés, Eduardo Portella, Silviano Santiago, and Antônio Carlos Villaça,\n\nCony and Ignácio de Loyola, who were judges, have their books in the list. An odd situation to be in. Or the authors are too modest and omit their work hurting their chances or are too eager to win and overrate their literary contribution. How to ask for total exemption in this case? For your information, the number one choice of each judge received 50 points, the second place 49 points, and so on.\n\nThe Top 50\n\n1.
