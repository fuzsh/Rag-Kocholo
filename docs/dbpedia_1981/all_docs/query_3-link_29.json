        "text": "August is Women in Translation month.\n\nThe project was created back in 2014 by Meytal Radzinski to raise awareness of women writers translated into English.\n\nInspired by her and her project, I decided to create our own “Brazilian women writers translated into English” list to raise awareness of Brazilian literature written by women translated into English.\n\nHere’s the list of 44 authors (in alphabetical order) and (some of) their translated books kindly suggested by people on social media:\n\n1. Adriana Lisboa\n\nTranslated books and their translators: Crow Blue, Alison Entrekin; Hut of Fallen Persimmons, Sarah Green; Symphony in White, Sarah Green.\n\nRead Alison Entrekin’s interview in my Greatest Women in Translation series here.\n\n2. Alice Brant\n\nTranslated book and its translator: The Diary of “Helena Morley,” Elizabeth Bishop.\n\nInteresting fact: This was the only book written by Alice under the pen name Helena Morley. It’s a diary she started writing when she was 13. Her book is considered one of the best Brazilian literary works of the 19th century.\n\n3. Alice Sant’Anna\n\nTranslated book of poems and its translator: Tail of the Whale, Tiffany Higgins.\n\n4. Ana Cristina Cesar\n\nTranslated book and its translators: At Your Feet, Brenda Hillman, Helen Hillman & Sebastião Edson.\n\n5. Ana Maria Machado\n\nTranslated books and their translators: The History Mistery, Luisa Baeta; Me in the Middle, David Unger; From Another World, Luisa Baeta.\n\nInteresting fact: Ana is also a translator and has translated Alice in Wonderland into Brazilian Portuguese.\n\n6. Ana Miranda\n\nTranslated book and its translator: Bay of All Saints and Every Conceivable Sin, Giovanni Pontiero.\n\n7. Ana Paula Maia\n\nTranslated book and its translator: Saga of Brutes, Alexandra Joy Forman.\n\n8. Angélica Freitas\n\nTranslated book and its translator: Rilke Shake, Hilary Kaplan.\n\n9.

Camila Fernandes\n\nTranslated short stories and their translator: The Other Bank of the River, Christopher Kastensmidt; The Best of the Three, Christopher Kastensmidt.\n\n11. Carol Bensimon\n\nTranslated book and its translator: We All Loved Cowboys, Beth Fowler.\n\n12. Carola Saavedra\n\nTranslated book and its translator: Blue Flowers, Daniel Hahn (coming on January 2020).\n\nRead Daniel Hahn’s guest post about the TA First Translation Prize here.\n\n13. Carolina Maria de Jesus\n\nTranslated book and its translator: Child of the Dark: The Diary of Carolina Maria de Jesus, David St. Clair.\n\n14. Cecília Meireles\n\nInteresting fact: Cecília was also a translator.\n\nP.S.: I couldn’t find any formal translation of her works. Feel free to comment below if you know any.\n\n15.

Mazzare; Discovering the World, Giovanni Pontiero; The Hour of the Star, Giovanni Pontiero; The Stream of Life, Elizabeth Lowe & Earl Fitz.\n\nInteresting fact: Clarice “was one of the first Brazilian women to graduate from law school and to become a journalist.” “Being famous for her striking beauty did not make her popular, which mattered to a woman whose talent was proportional to her sensitivity.” She’s the most widely translated and the best known woman writer in Brazil.\n\n16.
