Over the past decade, I accumulated many intellectual debts in conceptualizing and writing this book. I am grateful to my colleagues at Stanford University who took time to read sections and listen to my ideas about the study of society through literature. David Como, J. P. Daughton, Sean Hanretta, Franco Moretti, Paula Moya, Richard Roberts, Paul Robinson, and Peter Stansky were especially generous with their time and insights. Many Stanford students contributed directly to the project. The list is long: Taylor Clark, Ryan Delaney, Michael Dinerstein, Fred Freitas, Hanah ­Gilula, Alexis Guadarrama, Maya Krishman, Lucas Manfield, Veriene Melo, David Sabetti, Kevin Scott, Robert Torres, Noemi Walzebuck, and Andre Zollinger all worked directly on the project in its various manifestations over the years as research assistants. Both Van Tran and Annalise Lockhart read an early version and helped improve the prose throughout the manuscript. Former students, now colleagues, Marcelo Bucheli, Aldo Musaccio, Ian Read, Heather Roller, Lise Sedrez, and Kari Zimmerman read sections, offered suggestions and leads, and otherwise encouraged me. The lab staff in the Spatial History Project contributed to the collection of spatial data and its visualization. I am grateful, in this regard, to Whitney Berry, Jake Coolidge, Mithu Datta, Kathy Harris, Toral Patel, and Erik Steiner. Ryan Heuser and Mark Algee-Hewitt of the Literary Lab helped with textual analysis and conceptualizing the study of Brazilian plays. Finally, I wish to thank Gabriel Wolfenstein and Mark Braude, colleagues and friends, for reading the entire manuscript and for turning me on to Carl Schorske. The list beyond Stanford is also long. Colleagues around the country have given time and advice to this project. Thanks to Vince Brown, Amy Chazkel, Mariana Dantas, James Green, Lyman Johnson, Linda Lewin, Jeffrey Needell, Daniel O’Neil, and especially my teacher and mentor, Joseph Love. In Brazil, I have had the luck to count on the intellectual support of Afonso de A ­ lencastro\n\nx AC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\n\nGraça Filho, Claudio Batalha, Tarcísio Botelho, Sidney Chalhoub, Regina Coeli, Luís Ferla, Iris Kantor, Silvia Lara, Douglas Libby, Flávio Saliba Cunha, and Robert Slenes. Sandra Vasconcelos, while visiting Stanford, gave me an after­ noon of incisive ideas regarding Sonhos d’Ouro. Finally, the whole project would have been impossible while raising two kids and teaching more or less nonstop the past decade without the dedicated research assistance of Tereza Cristina Alves in Rio de Janeiro. Tereza Cristina, I am forever grateful for your work, which went far beyond the mere collection of data. You are a historian. Finally, as ever, I am grateful to my friends and family. Without Steve and Rosalyn Tran, there never would have been time in the day for all of this. Without Tram-Anh, Paulo, and Gabriela, there would not have been motivation to keep going. Thanks to all. I share with you whatever success this book finds. The errors and omissions are all on my account.\n\nP R E FAC E\n\nI have written a dozen versions of this preface over the years, as this project has grown and changed direction more than once. Started as a largely empirical study of inequality in nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro, the research gradually shifted to the plane of culture and everyday practices. Dissatisfied with the blank face of data, I started to think of literature as a source of illustration that could liven up the dreary tables I generated. After several years of struggle, I reached an impasse. No longer satisfied with the tables, I was equally unhappy with the treatment of literary sources as illustrations. Naturally, I tried mixing the two together, with inconclusive results. During this period, I presented some of these ideas at conferences and seminars and found that my audience was as perplexed as I was. Literature did not help make sense of the tables and figures; data did not improve the interpretation of literary material. It was time to make a clean break. So I started to read more literary history, particularly from the Marxist perspective, and less traditional history. I followed an idiosyncratic path into social theory. Franco Moretti led me to Georg Lukács and Georg Simmel; E ­ rving Goffman to George Santayana and William James; and Roberto Schwarz to Antonio Candido and Augusto Meyer. Above all, I read and reread Brazilian literature. What did I learn? From the Brazilian literary critics, I learned to emphasize an internal reading of the novels rather than try to match what I read in literature directly to what I read in traditional historical sources. My readings focused on the problems the author placed in front of his characters and the possible solutions hinted at or demonstrated through the unraveling of the plot. This new understanding of the social problems described in literature allowed me to make connections to the broader empirical base of historical material I had collected over the years regarding the social structures of Rio de Janeiro. The key was maintaining the relative autonomy of the two kinds of analysis. In ­effect, I\n\nxii P R E FAC E\n\ndiscovered that to write this book, I would have to write drafts of two books, which is what I have done. The final step is placing the two manuscripts side by side and discovering the points of contact and reinforcement. This is how I have read Rio de Janeiro and then written about it. What were the problems literature set out to delineate and perhaps solve? The answer is relatively simple, although the exploration required to come to it was intricate and ranged well beyond the borders of Brazil. A major focus of the canonical novels written in Brazil during the second half of the nineteenth century is the entry and incorporation of the individual in society. In a word: the bildungsroman—novels of education, finding a path to a career, and marriage. Weighty problems indeed: work and love, the crafting of an identity, and the reproduction of foundational social relationships. Many of the concerns in my parallel manuscript, the quantitative and empirical study of social structures, dealt with work and marriage, incomes and inheritances—points of contact. Finally, the novels create a sense of the city itself as a protagonist in history. Men and women arrive from the provinces and attempt to read the social topography of the metropolis in many classic versions of the bildungsroman. They project their desires onto the city and discover new desires and new disappointments as they make their way into the urban world. Ideas about the city inform both strategy and tactics. Individuals struggle to comprehend the vastness of the city. They navigate through it. It changes and its spaces are contested and redefined. There is nothing wrong with declarations of love in prefaces. I have loved Brazilian literature for a long time. Braudel confessed his love of the Mediterranean in a preface. I have no Braudelian aspirations in this book, but love makes a difference: It made me want to write this book, and it encouraged me to share my love of these authors with my readers. One last note on historiography before we begin: My intention is neither to perform literary analysis per se nor to write the social history of literature. I want to do something else, something without an established name and methodology—something that combines close readings of literary texts, distant readings of corpora, sociological theories of the city and of human interaction, and economic and social history grounded in quantitative empirical evidence. The rhetoric of academic publishing can give the impression that scholarship comes from a neutral place, that it is the natural outgrowth of an engagement with a cumulative enterprise—hence the literature review at the\n\nP R E FAC E xiii\n\nbeginning of nearly every history book, the space given over to historiography, the tendency to privilege recent works over “superseded” old ones, the belief in the cumulative that emphasizes the new. Well and good. Why not try something different?\n\nMaps The maps presented in Reading Rio de Janeiro were created using ESRI’s ­ArcMap suite of software. They reflect the physical layout of the city circa 1866, based on Gotto’s detailed map of that same year. The use of a digitized version of the Gotto map was made possible by generous colleagues in the Cecult Center, University of Campinas, São Paulo. Cartographic design, wherever it is present, is attributable to the able hands of Erik Steiner, of the Spatial History Project, Stanford University.\n\nImages There are two kinds of pictures presented to the reader in this book. The first kind is images drawn from contemporary newspapers. They reflect the style and attitudes of the era and illustrate some of the social relations and concepts discussed in the text. The other kind of picture includes two original drypoint intaglio etchings commissioned for the purpose of illustrating this book with particular scenes from the novels and plays that make up the bulk of its source material. These etchings were made by Steve Baird in 2012–2013 based on photos and textual descriptions of the style of clothes worn and the physical locations of the scenes during the era in question.\n\nMoney In Brazil during the nineteenth century, the primary unit of currency was the mil-réis. One thousand mil-réis made up 1 conto, which was the highest unit and would be written as 1:000$ (1 conto and 0 mil-réis). During most of the period contemplated in this book (1840s–1880s), the mil-réis was worth about 50 cents. Thus a rich estate of 300 contos, like that of Quincas Borba, would have been worth approximately $150,000. This conversion rate for mil-réis to dollars comes from archival documents and from Holloway, Policing Rio de Janeiro.\n\nCorpora The primary texts for this study are the novels and plays written and set in nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro. In all cases the base texts were derived from\n\nxiv P R E FAC E\n\nthe definitive collected works of the authors. For the novels, I used the volumes published by Editora Aguilar. The plays of Alencar, Macedo, and França are found in the volumes published by Serviço Nacional de Teatro. Martins Pena’s collected comedies are found in the three volumes published by Martins Fontes. PDF versions of all the texts were also obtained online for network and content analysis. Where possible, citations to the texts include both the page number in the definitive editions and the chapter or scene number in order to facilitate identification of passages in other editions.\n\nx Unless otherwise noted, all translations, whether of fictional or scholarly works, are my own.

This version of modernity was as incomplete and fragmented as the characters in these novels, and it drew its force from financial capital and bourgeois values while sharing space and power with older forms of commerce and older systems of social and cultural mores.1 The master themes of the genre—youth, education, self-determination, and socialization—are at the center of cultural formation.2 Transposed to the plane of social and cultural history, the bildungsroman provides vital evidence regarding two poles of historical experience that are notoriously difficult to connect: individual, every­ day, ad hoc, tactical, idiosyncratic choices; and the structural, social forces that buffet and shape individual and collective trajectories. Choices and forces: micro and macro. Choices and forces seen, predominantly to be sure, from the point of view of members of or aspirants to the middle or upper reaches of society. In this kind of novel, as E. M. Forster observes wryly in Howards End, the very poor are “unthinkable” as protagonists.3 A limited view and a partial history, then. Not fit for every taste. Even so, the genre leaves the historian a lot to work with. As Franco Moretti points out, the nineteenth-century bildungsroman held the individual and the collective in a delicate balance.4 For this brief period, the middle and upper classes could see themselves reflected in the bildungsroman as neither masters nor the mastered. Individuality and socialization were knitted together in\n\n2 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\na complex give-and-take; the dominance of institutions and the nation-state still loomed over the edge of the horizon, although the world was already saturated in capitalist relations of production and consumption. If the purpose of the bildungsroman is to reconcile the individual to the world, what were the terms of this reconciliation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s imperial capital? Asking this question opens up an ample field of research: What are the primary signposts associated with growth, maturity, and socialization? What trajectories do the men and women depicted in the novels follow? What aspects of the world, spatial and material, provide the opportunities and constraints facing these characters? In what ways does the dance between the individual and society go catastrophically wrong? These are fundamental questions, to which we can turn to literature for answers.\n\nLiterature and History Everything in the relationship between literature and history hinges on the questions we ask. Literature speaks to history directly and eloquently when we ask questions regarding the relationship of the individual to society—questions of a biographical nature. What was it like to live as a certain kind of person in a particular time and place? More important, what was it like to live a life over time in a past place? Historians ask many other questions, which the literature of Bildung answers only by illustration and texture. These questions touch on the development and activity of the police, the ebb and flow of politics, the discourse and practice of public health, and thousands more topics hinted at in Forster’s bald assertion that the poor are unthinkable as protagonists in forming independent social identities—the subject matter of Howards End. These kinds of historical processes are not questions posed directly by novels of B ­ ildung, although they certainly appear as part of the general context of life, the backdrop for the choices and forces relating to the protagonist. In this way we perceive the distance between social and political history, as it is usually practiced, and imaginative literature, as it is normally read. Yet literary history and the archive of imaginative prose are not restricted to the domain of culture. The question of the individual and society touches politics and the economy at every point in these novels. Indeed, it is the holistic depiction of human experience and the connection between individual agency and fate and historical structure and process that marks out the realistic novel as the preeminent source for answers to abiding historical questions. The key is to start with the right questions, to start with the problems and answers posed\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 3\n\nin novels read historically. Character, plot, and language come first; history follows. Accordingly, in this book I seek to reverse the terms of analysis normally associated with historical writing. Rather than begin with conventional historical problems, I begin with literary problems. The novels set the terms, and the historian interprets and accommodates them. History, then, is treated as a source for literature rather than the other way around. With this shift in perspective, literature regains its autonomous force. It is not an imaginative mirror of the historical past to be fact-checked against a conventional archive. Instead, literature poses and attempts to answer problems of deep historical interest, but it does so for its own coherent purposes, not as ersatz history. Specifically, it does this in the nineteenth-century novel, as Bakhtin suggests, through “the assimilation of real historical time and the assimilation of historical man that takes place in time.” Not all novels, to be sure, but particularly novels of emergence through experience—“man in the process of becoming.”5 If we read the right novels, we follow the development or, more often than not in the late nineteenth century, the underdevelopment of the protagonist in a rich and complex dance with time, with history. Following the lead provided by literary historians, it is possible to read novels as answers to conundrums of historical structure and change, viewed through human-scale hermeneutics of plot and language. How to live and how to fit in? Imperatives posed as ­questions. Thus, as the literary historian Joshua Esty argues, the bildungsroman in societies undergoing change takes on a particular cast. It becomes the vehicle for exploring failed development, the impossibility of fitting in.6 Or, to extend ­Roberto Schwarz’s metaphor: misplaced lives in addition to misplaced ideas. 7 Misplaced but belonging, incoherently coherent in historical time—the oxymoron of capitalist modernity. This experiment in literary-historical analysis begins by focusing on novels written by three of Brazil’s canonical authors. Each writer poses a similar set of questions yet provides very different answers to the possibility of integration of the individual in a changing society, because this relationship was particularly unstable between the 1840s and 1880s, when these novels are primarily set. Brazil posed particular challenges to the integration of the protagonist through growth and experience. It underwent a profound capitalist transition and at the same time occupied a peripheral position in an emerging global economy. It was home to the only lasting monarchy in the Americas, yet it was also ruled by a constitution inflected with the currents of liberalism and the Enlightenment.\n\n4 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\nIt was a nation filled with a recently coined aristocracy invented out of whole cloth (sometimes titles were simply purchased) and often involved in commerce (bourgeois aristocrats?) yet without the roots of heredity for sustenance. It was a slave society gradually losing all its slaves. The fractures in national historical time ramified inside and out, disrupting the possibility for narratives that reconcile individuals to a coherent chronotope of idealized progressive national time. Space and time were out of joint, and the protagonists could not fit in. Following Bakhtin, one can conceive of the Brazilian bildungsroman of this period as grappling with a fractured national chronotope, where the protagonist “emerges along with the world and reflects the historical emergence of the world itself . . . no longer within an epoch, but on the border between two epochs, at the transition point from one to another. . . . This transition is accomplished in him and through him.”8 Such a transition, if it is distorted or blocked, reflects the nature of that historical discontinuity between epochs. It describes an incomplete process of transition in a peripheral capitalist society. Growth and transformation are always problematic, even in a classic bildungsroman, such as Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister. In Brazil, during the latter part of the nineteenth century, our authors suggest that for many individuals, cutting across gender and class lines, these problems of growth and integration were nearly insurmountable. Thus, the novels in question are filled with failed promises, delayed reckonings, unconsummated relationships, and incomplete socialization, all of which calls to mind Esty’s category of unseasonable youth, found in novels of failed Bildung. For Esty, the coherent container of national time is disrupted by capitalist transformations that take place on a global scale. Individuals cannot be reconciled to a national time that has burst its bounds, whether internally, as he deduces in his reading of George Eliot’s Mill on the Floss, or externally, as at the fringes of empire in Joseph Conrad’s Lord Jim.9 The approach I take in this volume is comparative and holistic. Rather than isolate a particular author or book, I focus on a genre and an overarching problem: the growth of the individual and his or her integration into society. A particular kind of society existed in Rio de Janeiro in the latter half of the nineteenth century—one in which both capitalism and bourgeois norms were ascendant— but it was also a slave society shot through with the residue of colonialism, the ancien régime. In this, I adopt a position suggested by the Brazilian critic ­Roberto Schwarz and consider the degree to which the Brazilian bildungsroman addresses or is otherwise marked by these contradictions.10 Following Antonio Candido, the Brazilian master of literary sociology or the sociology of literature,\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 5\n\nI ask not only how these novels correspond to an underlying social reality (an important question, no doubt) but also how the social is manifest as an internal dimension of the novel.11 The social reality, however necessary and useful for historical purposes, is largely limited by its empiricism to registering correspondence and furnishing illustration and color to history. The internal social dimension is inherently interpretive. It engages with questions of power, structure, and agency, as expressed in the logic of character and plot, and it allows for the field of analysis to embrace the individual and the social in an integrated fashion. In this sense, rather than hold a mirror up to an external world, I argue that by internalizing critical elements of the social field, the novel brings society inside. My subjects are the novels of José de Alencar, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, and Aluísio Azevedo—the three A’s. Without question, Machado is the “great” novelist in the trio. Stylistically inventive, ironic, and sarcastic, ­Machado’s books can still surprise in the twenty-first century. Because of this fertility, there is an ever-lengthening shelf of books and articles that focus on him: Machado the sociologist,12 Machado the economist,13 Machado the historian.14 The Stanford library lists 335 books with Machado de Assis in the subject field. If, in this study, I can manage to say anything new about Machado de Assis, this alone will have made the effort (of writing; I leave the rest of the judgment to the reader) worthwhile. Of the other two writers, Alencar is best known for his historical novels, such as O Guarani and As Minas de Prata (in which he attempts in the vein of Walter Scott to write the origins of the Brazilian nation), and for his mythmaking ­indigenista novels, such as Iracema.15 He is also generally credited, along with his contemporary Joaquim Manuel de Macedo, with introducing the genre of the novel in Brazil. Less well-known, though by no means obscure, are his urban novels, which genuflect to Balzac, not Scott, and offer a rich depiction of life in Rio de Janeiro in the 1850s–1870s. Last among this trio, Azevedo’s fiction is marked by a strong commitment to Naturalism. If Balzac was Alencar’s model, Zola is the master in Azevedo’s universe. Azevedo is known best for his novel O Cortiço, sometimes translated as “the slum,” though this is hardly an adequate word to capture the gist of Azevedo’s subject. O Cortiço is a staple on reading lists in Brazil, but it is an earlier work, O Coruja, to which I turn to find Azevedo’s version of the bildungsroman. At the risk of oversimplification in the service of intelligibility, our Brazilian novelists’ temperaments follow a sequence, which is, after all, historical: Balzac, Flaubert, Zola.16 Alencar sought to capture his society in all its variety.\n\n6 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\nHe wrote urban novels and rural novels: an attempt at an abbreviated Brazilian Comédie humaine, though Alencar clearly lacked what Henry James referred to as Balzac’s “appetite of an ogre for all kinds of facts.”17 It is not so much a lack of detailed descriptions of dress and interiors, particularly in the urban novels. What is missing is the obstinate desire to see through things and describe how they work in great detail. In Alencar’s novels, the world of work, of manufacture, of retail, of construction, is largely absent. Given Alencar’s manifest project of narrating the reconciliation of traditional (provincial) virtue and capitalist (metropolitan) modernity, this absence is telling. A critical term is missing from the equation, and this forces Alencar to place greater emphasis on the role of individual character and to underplay the actual workings of the world that the individual must conquer to be redeemed.18 The contrast with Azevedo’s Naturalism is stark in this respect, and it is the struggle for meaningful work and the social mobility that it entails that distinguish O Cortiço and O Coruja from the field. Machado was more tightly wound and much more stylistically creative than the other two authors contemplated here. His mature novels are cynical and elliptical eviscerations of human frailty and social stupidity. They possess a bit of the spirit of Flaubert’s Bouvard et Pécuchet and the Dictionary of Received Ideas. Lukács, in characterizing Flaubert’s L’Education Sentimentale, might as well be describing the title character and structure of Machado’s Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas. No attempt is made here to counteract the disintegration of outside reality into heterogeneous, brittle and fragmentary parts by some process of unification or to replace absent connections or valences of meaning by lyrical mood imagery: the separate fragments of reality lie before us in all their hardness, brokenness and isolation. The central figure is not made significant by means of limiting the number of characters, by the rigorous convergence of the composition on the centre, or by any emphasis upon the central character’s outstanding personality: the hero’s inner life is as fragmentary as the outside world, his interiority possesses no lyrical power of scorn or pathos that might set it against the pettiness of reality.19\n\nYet Machado goes further. By shuffling the sequence of time and adopting a first-person narrative style, he further underscores the brittle, fragmentary consciousness of Brás in the face of the “unique and unrepeatable stream of life.” Just as in Frédéric Moreau’s Paris of the 1840s, the Rio de Janeiro of a simi-\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 7\n\nlar period narrated in Memórias Póstumas is crosscut with economic, social, and political currents, which fragment the world and disrupt any possibility of easy integration into homogeneous national time. The fractured narration of the defunct protagonist serves to emphasize the way the pieces of the puzzle can fit, but only badly. The difference between the novelistic worlds of Alencar and Machado mirrors, in profound ways, the difference between Balzac and Flaubert. In Alencar, as Vargas Llosa has noted in his reading of Balzac, “The imagination of humanity is still capable of making its dreams come true and of renewing life.” In contrast, for both Machado and Flaubert, “Imagination is a crime that reality punishes by breaking those who try to live their dreams.” In this regard, Vargas Llosa suggests “Balzac finds life logical while Flaubert finds it absurd.”20 As we will see in Chapters 1 and 2, both positions have merit in the context of nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro. Finally, in yet a third register, Azevedo’s fiction evinces the values and limitations of Naturalism. Characters come to represent types, the individual fades into the background, and the social dominates. In this, Azevedo follows the path set out by Zola: “We must work with the characters, the emotions, the human and social facts, as the chemist and the physicist work with matter, as the physiologist works with living bodies. Determinism dominates everything.”21 Azevedo’s debt to Zola was such that he was at times accused of plagiarizing the master’s plots. Some critics find in O Cortiço a virtual copy of the basic elements of L’Assommoir.22 I leave the literary detective work to the experts. In any case, my quarry is different. It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that I really do not care a whit whether most of these novels are copies. In fact, I would be disappointed if they were not. What Azevedo’s fiction allows us to perceive is a third argument posed by literature with respect to the problematic individual and his or her integration into society. If in Alencar, choices are tragic, and in Machado, capricious or absurd, then in Azevedo, they are largely determined. This volume is divided into two parts. First, I analyze three novels in detail: Alencar’s Sonhos d’Ouro, Machado’s Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas, and Azevedo’s O Coruja. These novels were published first in newspapers, in 1872, 1880–1881, and 1885–1887, respectively, and then in book form. Of the three, Sonhos d’Ouro and O Coruja are unquestionably novels in the tradition of the bildungsroman.23 Memórias Póstumas is notoriously hard to pin down, but it shares enough elements of the genre—namely, the story of a central character’s youth,\n\n8 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\neducation, and insertion into society—to warrant inclusion for my purposes. In this compressed period of the 1870s and 1880s the bildungsroman registers a profound engagement with the structure of Brazilian society. If, as Doris Sommer argues, the middle years of the nineteenth century were the time of national novels—those romances of consolidation and sexual-political reconciliation— then the last three decades of the century were the time of Bildung, narrating the integration of the individual into this problematic new national society.24 Of the three novels selected, only Memórias Póstumas is truly well-known and widely read; it is considered the single most important work of fiction in the Brazilian canon.25 Each novel is given an extensive gloss in conjunction with the analysis, providing, it is hoped, sufficient material for readers to orient themselves to the plots, characters, and basic structural properties of each book. Although two of the three books are little known and more seldom read, it is my hope that by describing them in detail and by analyzing their distinctive answers to the problem of social integration, readers will be inspired to pick them up and learn from them as I have. I have chosen to analyze three novels by three canonical authors precisely to allow for triangulation among different points of view and distinct aesthetic commitments. In the second and concluding part of the volume, Chapters 4 through 6, I broaden the scope to include the whole novelistic oeuvre of each author, with additional references to other novelists, Brazilian and otherwise, and I attempt to show the full range of possible trajectories, material conditions, and successful (or unsuccessful) processes of reconciliation between individuals and their changing society. In this respect, I seek to show how reading certain Brazilian novels alongside major European works can throw light on the aesthetic choices and antecedents discernible in the Brazilian works. But there is more to the comparison than this. Through these parallel readings, we also see depictions, mutatis mutandis, of universal struggles to imagine the integration of youth into society under the changing and unsettling conditions of nineteenth-century capitalism. In this sense the Brazilian novels are far more than mere copies of European novels transposed uncomfortably to the tropics; rather, they are aesthetic and historical contributions to world literature worth reading alongside such books as Balzac’s Lost Illusions or Eliot’s Middlemarch. The corollary: In order to read Brazilian novels in their full artistic and historical context, we need to read L’Education Sentimentale, Tristram Shandy, and their ilk. There is a further advantage to be gained in this procedure: familiarity. Even if one has not read Sonhos d’Ouro, one has probably read Balzac and,\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 9\n\ntaken together, the analysis of the one and the familiarity with the other will, it is hoped, make the arguments in this book both meaningful and accessible.\n\nHistorical Framework The cardinal points in the social structure framing the tension to be resolved in the selected novels are slavery, capitalism, immigration and internal migration, and Europeanization. Each point is unstable, and its valence depends on internal factors in transformation and on simultaneous relationships with the other points. Slavery, in the era during which the novels analyzed here were published, was a dying institution. It cast a long shadow, but it would be a mistake to place it alone at the center of analysis. Capitalism is a moving target. In the period after 1850, particularly in Rio de Janeiro, it took an increasingly financial and speculative shape. The curves of slaveholding and financial capitalism cross in this era, with the rapid growth of capitalism and the decline of slaveholding. The population of Rio de Janeiro roughly doubled between 1821 and 1849 and then doubled again by 1890. Slaves, Portuguese immigrant caixeiros (retail countermen), and provincial parvenus poured into the Corte, as Rio de Janeiro city and immediate environs were known during the period of the empire (1822–1889), mixing with the native population and providing an impetus, a sense of dynamism, and heightening levels of competition and social complexity. In the realm of ideas and cultural norms, European imports, especially from France but also from England, Italy, and Germany, influenced patterns of consumption and contributed to the formation of elite consciousness, which diffused or found emulation in the middling and even poorer classes living in the capital over time.\n\nSlavery Slavery and capitalism went hand in hand in the nineteenth-century Atlantic world. This close association should be understood as being both vestigial and symbiotic. It is vestigial because the origins of slavery in the Americas can be traced back to the earliest years of European settlement, when the world economy was quite different from that of the 1800s. In this regard, a deep social and cultural crust had formed over Brazil, creating what Ira Berlin has called a slave society in contrast to a society with slaves.26 The institution permeated all facets of life. Slaves were ubiquitous in both rural and urban settings. The association between slavery and capitalism is symbiotic in the sense that the rise of industrial and financial capitalism in Brazil was associated with\n\n10 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\nfortunes made in part through the illegal slave trade and was in a significant sense underwritten by the labor of slaves, native and imported, particularly in the booming coffee plantations located in the economic core region of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and Minas Gerais. To reiterate, slaves provided both capital (indirectly) and labor to fuel the growth of the Brazilian economy in the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century. Slaves and slavery were central to the whole social structure. Yet this centrality was already eroding by the 1850s. This is why one can characterize slavery as a dying institution—indeed, an institution in certain areas and among certain segments of Brazilian society that was undergoing a shift from the realm of the slave society to the society with slaves, from a central place to the periphery of social life. Slavery was also dying because its social legitimacy declined at roughly the same time as the illegal importation of new slaves from Africa was definitively suppressed around 1850.27 The death of slavery was notoriously slow in Brazil. Half-measures and gradualist abolition schemes were the order of the day right down to 1888 and the so-called Golden Law of emancipation.28 This slow death meant that for a prolonged period, from the 1830s through the 1880s, the topic of slavery was discussed as a problem and, in literary circles, the institution came in for sustained, if never intense, criticism. The fact of the matter is that after the suppression of the Atlantic trade, one of the chief objects of criticism was ameliorated. Literary texts abound with harsh characterizations of the infamous negreiros (slave traders), and characters with fortunes rooted in the not too distant illegal slave-trading past continued to be portrayed as villains even after they were no longer active in the trade.29 After the Atlantic trade ended, other significant measures followed, including most importantly the so-called Law of the Free Womb in 1871. This law guaranteed that all children born to slave mothers would henceforth be considered free, consigning slavery to a gradual end by means of attrition.30 Despite the importance of these laws and the political debates swirling around different emancipation schemes, slavery and slaves appear as themes or characters only rarely in the fiction and drama of the 1860s through 1880s. Why the strange absence? Two major reasons. First, as slavery lost social legitimacy, it ceased to figure in the imagined social lives of fictional characters. To give a prosaic example, in a sample of novels by the three authors under consideration, the word piano occurs twice as often as words for slave in all its permutations. Nonetheless, when slaves or slaveholding appear in the imaginative\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 11\n\nliterature of the era, we have good reason to sit up and pay close attention— rarity should not be confused with insignificance. Second, slavery really was in terminal decline by the 1870s. The proportion of slaves in the city of Rio de Janeiro declined from 46% in 1821 to 38% in 1849 and then more precipitously to 16% in 1872.31 By the time the books analyzed in this study were written, slavery was well on its way out.32 In making these observations, it is not my wish to excuse the neglect of the theme in so much literature of the era, though it is easy with moral hindsight to cast stones. Surely human beings and their suffering are more important than pianos! Rather, my intention is to explain why for many writers and even more for their readers, the subject of slaves could be left on the margin. It is always there, but other institutions and social forces hold center stage because the central problematic of the novel is the integration of the free, white, usually male individual into what has become, in the most advanced segments of Rio de Janeiro, a society with slaves on the wane.\n\nCapitalism The economic order we call capitalism is the pivot on which the whole of my analysis turns. This is not the place to enter into the long and never resolved debate concerning the origins and foundational characteristics of capitalism. That would be another book. Having said this, some working concepts are in order, both in general terms of definition and in specific reference to the Brazilian case. Let me begin with what capitalism is not. It is not an ahistorical “economic system” untethered to historical specificity. The ahistorical version of capitalism tends to focus on markets and trade rather than on relations of production or institutions.33 Where there are markets, there is capitalism. This is, I hold, quite mistaken. In taking this position, I follow Robert Brenner, who famously argued against what he called neo-Smithian Marxism—a vision of capitalism in which exchange and markets dominate.34 Capitalism, then, has two faces, and they cannot be separated. There are markets and there are relations of production (pace Douglass North, governed by formal and informal institutions), which, according to Marx, must necessarily involve the accumulation and circulation of capital in a context where labor is free but cut off from the ownership of the means of production. Where these two aspects intersect in specific ways, we have capitalism. This does not imply that all relations of production in an economy are necessarily based on free labor. Nor does it imply that all the modern institutions of capital—banking, finance, stock market—are fully\n\n12 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\nformed and predominant. Rather, because capitalism is historical, it emerges and evolves discontinuously against a backdrop of other social formations. Because this emergence is utterly transformative of social relations, politics, and culture, it is violent (in the broadest sense) and disruptive. In its birth and adolescence, it makes social integration especially problematic. If the old ways no longer will do, the new ways are contested and socially disorienting. Capitalism in urban Brazil, and this distinction is critical, grew in strength and sophistication and took up an increasingly important place in the imaginative literature of the era. In particular, the speculative financial capitalism of the second half of the nineteenth century posed special problems for narrating individual lives in historical time. Banking, joint-stock companies, and the stock market became favorite targets for literary depiction and critique just as they grew to dominate the economic scene in Brazil’s capital city.35 With these institutions came new forms of social mobility, new questions about the provenance of wealth, and new elites with complex ideologies shot through with the warp of capitalism and bourgeois values and the weft of the paternalism of the ancien régime. Emilia Viotti da Costa captures this process well, suggesting ways in which the old and the new coexisted throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, building up tensions that were released with the qualitative and quantitative transformations of capitalism after 1850. She identifies the emergence of a bureaucratic and professional group, which, rather than forming a new class, was “integrated into the clientele of the agrarian elite, to whom they were often tied by links of family and patronage, and whose world view they shared.”36 This accommodation was increasingly strained by the rise of financial capitalism and the growing incorporation of Brazil into the world economy. In 1850 the slave trade was definitively suppressed. In 1854 a new land law expanded markets and codified property rights in keeping with capitalist norms. Viotti da Costa goes on to suggest that after midcentury, the growth of the economy “­created opportunities for the emergence of new groups that made a critique of the social and political order, in the name of liberal ideals and bourgeois notions.”37 These critiques were not limited to the economic and political spheres. They were at the heart of Brazilian literature in the 1870s and 1880s. Sometimes, a graph is worth a thousand words. Evidence I collected from a large sampling of estate inventories from the city of Rio de Janeiro tells the tale of emergent financial capitalism against the backdrop of slavery’s waning as the lynchpin of economic relations (see Figure 1).38 The curves cross and a new, unsettled world appears.39\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 13\n\nF IG U R E 1 . Shifting composition of wealth: Estate inventories in Rio de Janeiro, 1810– 1880s. Lines show percentage of net inventoried wealth by category over time. source: “Inventários,” Arquivo Nacional, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy in Figure 1 is the velocity of economic change. Financial wealth measured in credit, stocks, bonds, and cash explodes, whereas wealth measured in slaves dives toward zero. Processes that took shape in gradual movements during the 1840s and 1850s accelerated. Perhaps even more socially disruptive was the rise and changing composition of inequality. The forms of wealth changed, but so too did the distribution. By using a subset of 705 estate inventories with the most complete and detailed information available concerning the internal distribution of assets within each estate, it is possible to trace out the evolution of wealth inequality in the city over time. Table 1 decomposes inequality into its constituent parts. The radical change in the last decades of the nineteenth century, already demonstrated in Figure 1, now takes on even greater social significance. Inequality was rising along with capitalist competition and financial wealth—taken together, this is what is meant by the concept of an emerging capitalist modernity. Last, along these lines, evidence from the records of business partnerships registered with the Junta Comercial in 1870 and 1888 shows how entrepreneurs in the world of trade and finance came to occupy the top rungs of the economic elite. Businessmen, especially traders in commodities such as coffee, formed the most highly capitalized partnerships. In 1870, 40 out of 344 firms were clearly designated as belonging to this category of economic activity. The average paid-in capital of these partnerships was 94 contos, whereas the average for\n\n14 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\nTA B L E 1 .\n\nDecomposition of Inequality (Nonhuman Wealth) Contribution to Inequality (%) Before 1850\n\n1850s\n\nAfter 1880\n\n36.5\n\n31.0\n\n24.4\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\n0.4\n\nForm of wealth Urban houses Furnishings Credit\n\n13.1\n\n7.3\n\n13.0\n\nCash and bank deposits\n\n9.5\n\n11.0\n\n9.4\n\nStocks and bonds\n\n4.7\n\n6.1\n\n22.1\n\nBusiness\n\n1.2\n\n9.3\n\n10.0\n\nGeneral statistics Gini coefficient Number of observations\n\n0.71 185\n\n0.69 233\n\n0.79 287\n\nsource: Inventários, Arquivo Nacional, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nall other firms was 42 contos. By 1888 the gap had widened, with the broker and commission firms capitalized at 126 contos (47 firms) and the rest (261 firms) capitalized at just 38 contos on average.40 Taken together, the evidence shows a generalized shift toward financial capital, an increase in inequality driven in large part by this shift, and the growing economic power of businessmen and investors engaged in partnerships that rely on and contribute to these changes. I hesitate to pile on more statistics, because the point of this study is to interpret history through literature rather than write an economic history of the last third of the nineteenth century. Still, it may be worth including a few lines about incomes as opposed to wealth holding. Inequality in income tends to be significantly less pronounced than inequality in wealth. The lower the levels of inequality in both dimensions, the greater the degree of social mobility. Because income data are extremely hard to come by in sufficient quantity and coherence to allow for measurements of inequality, we are forced to use the best available resource: voter qualification rolls. These lists are obviously problematic on several accounts. First, they pertain only to Brazilian citizens qualified to vote, and there was an income requirement, albeit a low bar, to getting listed in the first place. Second, the values given in the rolls are self-reported in round figures. They are nothing like a true value one might find in a tax return today. With these caveats in mind, the analysis of voter rolls provides two useful pieces of information. First, among voters, the self-reported income figures\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 15\n\nyield a Gini coefficient of 0.48, which we can interpret as moderate to high income inequality.41 The second useful clue is found in the spread between incomes by occupation. The highest income group, capitalists and property ­owners, reported earning just over 8 contos (presumably from capital), whereas artisans reported incomes of just over 1 conto (mainly from labor). Taken together, the wealth and income inequality measures and the spread between the two suggest a society in which a modicum of social mobility coexisted with rising levels of wealth inequality, driven by the constant forces of inheritance and the variable winds of marriage and financial speculation. A new social order first emerges and then becomes hegemonic over the course of two generations. The Brazilian bildungsroman confronts this transformation and offers diagnosis and orientation, in different measure, with respect to the place of individuals in a rapidly changing urban social world: a new world with new people in it and new problems to resolve. The character of the capitalist strides confidently toward center stage, embodied in historical figures such as the Baron of Mauá or, more negatively, in bankrupts such as A. J. A. Souto.42 Money, particularly financial wealth, and material possessions increasingly rival the older marks of distinction in ancestry and education. Money, abundant but unstable, feeds back into these older forms of status and transforms their meaning, shoring up the winners and undermining the losers. Perhaps the best illustration of this process is found in the sale of nonhereditary titles of nobility, often to successful capitalists, during the latter decades of Pedro II’s reign. Titles had been granted, even sold, before the 1850s, but usually in small numbers. After the emergence and consolidation of the financial elite, the pace of title creation and sale quickened; social distinction, like everything else, was for sale to men on the make, something of which our novelists were keenly aware.43 Of course, every age probably thinks that money plays an outsized and distorting role in status and social structure. The point here is that, particularly the 1850s–1880s, some of the fundamental characteristics of the economy had shifted, and with this shift came new structures of feeling and new artistic attempts at understanding the consequences of these changes.\n\nImmigration and Internal Migration Immigrants from Portugal and elsewhere in Western Europe provided much of the motive force behind the rise of industrial and financial capitalism in Rio de Janeiro. They were to be found in every position in the economic hierarchy, from banker down to retail clerk. More than half of all partners in\n\n27,251 8,968\n\nWhite female Single Married\n\n10,858 81\n\n4,818 27\n\n11,957 112\n\nPreto Single Married\n\nParda Single Married\n\nPreta Single Married\n\n174 7\n\n96 4\n\n122 2\n\n65 3\n\n265 171\n\n669 150\n\nSão Paulo\n\n247 11\n\n120 1\n\n246 4\n\n91 8\n\n258 179\n\n782 244\n\nMinas Gerais\n\n61 2\n\n87 0\n\n85 0\n\n64 0\n\n69 23\n\n226 68\n\nCeará\n\n184 2\n\n71 1\n\n185 0\n\n51 0\n\n60 40\n\n237 76\n\nMaranhão\n\n601 3\n\n176 2\n\n496 4\n\n150 3\n\n250 135\n\n546 258\n\nBahia\n\n114 0\n\n70 1\n\n86 0\n\n60 0\n\n225 190\n\n559 210\n\nRio Grande do Sul\n\na.

This absence stands in sharp contrast to the frequent appearance of foreigners in dramatic works throughout the century—a subject about which I write at length in a planned companion volume on nineteenth-century plays. Once again, as with that other underrepresented population, slaves, the underlying characteristics of the bildungsroman make immigrants from Europe peripheral to stories of education and social integration into the world of the bourgeois, the capitalist, and metropolitan society. A Portuguese immigrant could play a central part in a Naturalist exposé of tenement life, as in the case of Jerônimo in Azevedo’s O Cortiço; in the Bildung of Teobaldo and André, the protagonists of O Coruja, no such character is called for. More important for the story I am going to tell are the many migrants to the city of Rio de Janeiro from Brazil’s far-flung provinces. To give the reader a sense of the scale of internal migration and its basic demographic profile, in Table 2 I present information from Brazil’s first modern census. Note that this is a sampling of provinces and categories and not a complete rendering of the census data. As the data suggest, most of the population in the city was native to the province of Rio (and, we can infer, in most cases, the city itself). What is particularly important for the purpose of the present study is the significant presence of “white” men from the provinces in the Corte, because these figures make up an important social category in Brazilian literature of the time—­ indeed, two of the three authors on whom this study focuses belong to this group. These are the strivers, the parvenus, and the country bumpkins who will play important parts in the novels discussed in this volume. The figures in Table 2 also suggest two other salient facts. First, far more unmarried provincial men were wandering about Rio de Janeiro than unmarried provincial women. When we add to this the fact that there were far more foreign men of European origin in the Corte at the same time than there were foreign women of the same extraction, we are immediately made aware of one of the determining factors in the competitive marriage market. Finally, in contrast, the experience of slaves could not be more different. Marriage was virtually unknown among this group, even though the demographic balance\n\n18 I N T R O D U C T IO N\n\nbetween women and men was much more favorable. These facts are not new. Still, it is well to be reminded in cold numbers of the reality that marriage had a color and a class in nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro. Again, for the purpose of the present volume, the key thing to remember is the surplus of single provincial men fighting over scarce brides, their dowries, and jobs and social positions in the growing city.\n\nThe Novel and European Cultural Influences Brazil is the child of European settler colonialism—conquest, expropriation, native removal—yoked to the labor of millions of enslaved Africans. There is no question then of the authenticity of European cultural artifacts and practices in Brazil. They are authentic but at times strangely out of place. This is Schwarz’s great insight: Certain ideas, in specific conjunctures, expressed in literary form, do not fit easily with Brazil’s fractured history and hybrid society. Nineteenth-century novels in the realist tradition, with their European (bourgeois) concerns, are thus akin, in Brazil, to the wearing of black wool suits from Paris in the summer heat of Rio de Janeiro. This must not be seen to say that European ideas are always out of place owing to geography or the unique essence of nationhood in Brazil. Indeed, in the West during the nineteenth century, with few exceptions, there are no ideas other than European ideas, just as there are no suits other than black wool ones. It must be remembered that the importation of European ideas and attendant material culture was a discontinuous and heterogeneous process. Old regime concepts and practices persisted. These too came from Europe and were sometimes “modernizing,” as in the case of Pombaline administrative reform and urban style. Older European forms steeped in Brazilian realities overlapped with the liberal, modernizing spirit of nineteenth-century Europe, which itself was riven by conflicts between the forces of liberalism and conservatism, the old and the new. Thus, the Europeanization of Brazil during the 1800s must be seen both as something taking place in a specific, unique cultural and social environment (e.g., the city of Rio de Janeiro) and as a global process in which the novel, in its quintessential European form, is constituted by and inserted into these struggles over the meaning of the nation and the interpretation of individual destinies that are woven into a changing social fabric shot through with past, present, and visions of the future. In this, the novel is hardly alone. The realms of architecture and urban design, fine art, politics, law, finance, and every­day consumer society all participated in the same broad\n\nT H E B R A Z I L IA N B I L D U N G SR OM A N 19\n\nprocess.46 Classical architecture on a monumental scale patterned on European models, commercial codes governing the issue of stocks and bonds, and ladies’ fashion in hats and gloves seen at the theater where traveling opera companies presented the latest European compositions—all provided signs for novels to use and interpret, just as they read the signs of the slaves working in the streets selling sweets or of the muleteer from Minas Gerais with his cargo of bacon and cheese.\n\nx Together the factors described in the previous sections—slavery, capitalism, immigration, and European culture—framed the conditions under which individuals could be imagined as educated and integrated into society. With these points in mind, let us delve into the novels themselves.\n\n1\n\nSONHOS D’OURO\n\nJ O S É D E A L E N C A R rededicated himself to his writing after seeing his political star eclipsed—losing a ministerial post and being passed over by the emperor Dom Pedro II for senator despite receiving the most votes in his native Ceará— although he also stayed involved in politics as a member of the lower Chamber of Deputies.1 In 1871 the so-called Law of the Free Womb was passed on September 28. Although the law meant that henceforth no child would be born a slave in Brazil, ensuring the eventual extinction of the institution, the mothers remained slaves and their children remained wards of their mother’s owners for up to twenty-one more years.2 This gradual emancipation scheme nonetheless drew Alencar’s ire. Although no friend of slavery, Alencar was a classic conservative concerned with the protection of private property rights and the maintenance of social order.3 He did not hold the citizenship capacity of slaves in high esteem and believed that slaves were genuinely better off with their paternalistic masters than cut loose and left to their own devices.4 Alencar’s novel Sonhos d’Ouro does not address the issue of slavery or property rights head on, but it can be read as an attempt to offer a solution to the problem of modernity in a prospectively post-slavery urban metropolis. The rub: Reining in the excess of the new capitalist wealth required joining the new rich to the traditional values (if not the slaveholding) of the interior. It is against this backdrop, while Alencar was living in the hills of Tijuca, which became one of the central settings of the novel, that Sonhos d’Ouro was written. Perhaps Alencar chose Tijuca, on the mountainous rural fringe of Rio\n\n22 C HA P T E R 1\n\nde Janeiro, as his refuge after his stinging political defeats because it reminded him of happier days; he had met and courted his wife, Georgiana Cochrane, the daughter of a wealthy Englishman, in that same rural neighborhood.5 Certainly, life and fiction entwined. Published in 1872, on the heels of a series of devastating personal and professional setbacks, Sonhos d’Ouro deserves to be considered among the finest novels of Alencar’s career. The book recounts the story of Ricardo Nunes, a young lawyer from São Paulo, and Guida Soares, the daughter of a wealthy Rio de Janeiro businessman. Ricardo represents the virtuous but poor man marked by talent but lacking connections; Guida is the capricious and spoiled rich girl with a good heart. Bringing these two characters together, Alencar writes as an alchemist: Virtue and wealth together transmute into a golden dream. From the start, the theme of virtue in relation to wealth is sounded out. Ricardo’s first internal monologue begins: Gold . . . gold . . . You reign over the world, absolute monarch, autocratic ruler of all the world’s riches! You, yes, you reign and govern, without law, without opinion, without Parliament. . . . Law? What law have you save for the caprice with which you toy with men? Ouro! . . . ouro! . . . És o rei do mundo, rei absoluto, autocrata de todas as grandezas da terra! Tu, sim, tu reinas e governas, sem lei, sem opinião, sem parlamento. . . . Lei. . . . Que lei é a tua, senão o capricho com que escarneces dos homens?6\n\nThese thoughts pour out of Ricardo as he rests on the side of a trail in the bucolic woods of Tijuca, drawing the outline of a golden wildflower in his sketchbook. He has come to Rio de Janeiro seeking his fortune; or perhaps it is better to say that he has come seeking to close the chapter of his youth and, upon earning the 20 contos he needs to establish a household of his own, return to São Paulo to marry and raise a family. His needs are not great. But Ricardo has no money and no connections. Amassing such a sum seems nearly impossible to him as he reclines in the grass and reflects on life. Twenty contos, he thinks, when “millionaires have paid much more than that just to have the right to a five letter name.” Barão (baron). Conde (count). Four contos per letter.7 His needs seem small in comparison. How might one get such a quantity of money quickly? Winning the lottery, in a card game, through an unexpected inheritance.8 As Ricardo ponders these possibilities, he becomes aware that he is being watched. Looking up, he sees a beautiful young woman astride an\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 23\n\nArabian horse. She stares down at him. Without thinking, he kisses the golden flower he has been holding while sketching. The girl laughs. Although Ricardo senses that there is some malice in the girl’s demeanor, he returns laughter with laughter. Thus Ricardo and Guida meet for the first time: poor virtue meets golden caprice.9 Later, Ricardo will draw Guida’s beautiful figure in his sketchbook alongside the flower and discover that she is the daughter of one of the richest men in Rio de Janeiro. Critically, for Alencar’s purposes, her father will be rich but scrupulously honest and humble, the antithesis of those men who paid “four contos per letter” for a flimsy title of nobility.10 In Illustration 1, which was commissioned for this volume and etched in drypoint intaglio by Stephen Baird, the critical first meeting between Ricardo and Guida is presented for the reader. Guida has taken advantage of her fast horse to lose her chaperone, the prim Mrs. Trowshy. Ricardo is absorbed in a typical bourgeois pastime: taking the air in the forest and sketching a flower. Thus they meet for the first time, alone, in the poses of youth seeking experience. In Alencar’s version of the Brazilian bildungsroman, the twin paths of Ricardo and Guida represent the ways in which youthful pride and voluble caprice interact and complicate courtship and social integration. Ricardo is too proud at first to admit his love for Guida, fearing that he will appear as nothing more than another treasure hunter chasing the girl’s rich dowry; Guida, unthinking, allows herself to take advantage of her situation, her power, in abusive games and pranks. Ricardo explains to his friend Fábio: In a millionaire’s house, in the midst of people accustomed to luxury and status, what kind of figure would we cut? I believe it would best be said to lie at the balance between parasite and servant; we’d be the links in the chain betwixt the two. Em casa de um milionário, no meio de uma sociedade habituada ao luxo e às grandezas, qual seria nossa posição? Creio que a classifico bem dizendo que faríamos o ponto de transição entre o parasita e o criado; formaríamos o elo desses dois anéis da cadeia.11\n\nTo which Fábio responds, “Indeed, such modesty slips into pride” (“Com efeito! Modéstia tão requintada degenera em orgulho”). Pride, then, his friend suggests, is the barrier to social progress, not to mention pretty and rich young girls. Ricardo willfully misses Fábio’s point, replying, “I have my dignity, not pride” (“Não tenho orgulho, mas dignidade”).12\n\nI L LU S T R AT IO N 1 . Guida and Ricardo meet for the first time in the hills of Tijuca. Original artwork in drypoint intaglio by Stephen Baird.\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 25\n\nIn the meantime, in contrast to the identification of Ricardo with the sin of pride, Alencar refers to Guida with the term caprice no less than twenty-five times over the course of the novel. Guida, a free spirit by upbringing and character, admits her capricious nature openly. She has been brought up to do and say as she pleases. At the midpoint of the novel, Ricardo and Guida have a long conversation while riding on horseback through the forest paths of Tijuca. Ricardo has been trying to avoid Guida but to no avail. The girl is persistent. She calls herself rash. Ricardo adds capricious and naughty (see Illustration 2). Guida replies, “What do you want from me? I am of the habit of being pleased” (“Que quer? Estou habituada a me fazerem todas as vontades!”).13 Ricardo, ever the serious one, responds with a sermon on the dangers of following one’s whims. Although Alencar doubtless has in mind a moral to his story—one in which it is Guida who ultimately submits to the discipline of virtue—the novel itself contains a distinct reading in which Ricardo can be seen playing an inverse role as the chaste partner in the marriage dance. This inversion springs from his need to retain his “dignity” and to make his own way in the world without the helping hand of Guida, the vile Visconde de Aljuba (a character introduced\n\nI L LU S T R AT IO N 2 . “Barometer of Love: Variable Woman.” This image, showing woman as young and capricious, appeared along with seven other images as a jocular “barometer of love.” The other two images, in which women hold the center ground, represent “stormy” and “cold.” source: Semana Illustrada, 43 (1861): 340.\n\n26 C HA P T E R 1\n\nmidway through the text to tempt Ricardo with easy but illicit gain), or anyone else for that matter. The central contradiction is the preservation of the spirit and one’s dignity when faced with the need for money. Antonio Candido says: The young man of talent, who in [Alencar’s] books is always seeking love and social consideration, has in his path the problem of ascending in the capitalist world without breaking faith with his honor. O moço de talento, que nos seus livros parte sempre a busca do amor e da consideração social, tem pela frente o problema de ascender a esfera do capitalista sem quebra da vocação.14\n\nCandido goes on to dismiss Alencar’s solution, “marrying him off to the daughter of a rich man” (“casando-o com a filha do ricaço”), in Sonhos d’Ouro and in many other novels.15 This claim, given the tenuous nature of the postscript of the novel, is at best half-true. Ricardo’s choice is more complex. He is caught in a double bind with commitments to his mother and his cousin Isabela that cannot be reduced to this formula. Guida adds a third dimension. Less central to the plot is the Luisinha-Fábio engagement, involving Ricardo’s sister and best friend, which adds a fourth dimension. It is not even quite true that Ricardo seeks social ascent or a place in the world of capital. His aim, the equivalent of $10,000 at the time, is a sum far below the minimum level of wealth required to enter society, whether in its economic sphere or that of the salon. Not an insignificant sum, to be sure, but far from constituting a fortune circa 1870.16 Alencar is, I argue, making a profound and subtle point more in keeping with Roberto Schwarz’s observation regarding the impossibility of making an honest living in Rio de Janeiro at this time. The point is that a man of great talent, “top of his class,” cannot, without “protection,” earn a living commensurate with his abilities or, for that matter, commensurate with the incomes of mediocre businessmen or second-rate public employees.17 The distance from 0 to 20 contos is practically unbridgeable without sacrificing his values. Through Ricardo, Alencar asks, What kind of society is this? The novel presents Ricardo with a series of trials. He states early on in a conversation with Fábio the dangers of succumbing to the temptation of easy money. Gold is the touchstone of conscience; the plumb line that sounds the depths. I believe I am an honest man, but I’m not certain, because I have yet to see proof, choosing between the scruples of probity and the certain profits of a less worthy act.\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 27\n\nO ouro é a pedra de toque da consciência; o prumo que lhe sonda a profundidade. Creio que sou um homem honesto; mas não tenho a certeza disso, porque ainda não me vi à prova, entre os escrúpulos da probidade e os lucros certos de uma ação menos digna.18\n\nThroughout the novel Alencar has Ricardo give little sermons on virtue and the value of independence in the face of these trials. Ricardo’s chastity is doubled, as it reflects outward and condemns easy money gained through questionable means or marriages of convenience. The idea that easy money and corrupted marriage join to form the worst possible combination recurs in Alencar’s works. In Senhora it is practically the entire plot—a man sells himself for 100 contos to a vengeful bride.19 The difference between Sonhos d’Ouro and the better-known novel Senhora is worth considering here in more detail. Roberto Schwarz, in his study of the works of Alencar and Machado, dissects Senhora with skill and perception. Although he mentions other so-called urban novels from Alencar’s pen, he does not cite Sonhos d’Ouro. This is an odd omission, because the novel is discussed at some length in Antonio Candido’s foundational study of Brazilian literature.20 The fact is, Sonhos d’Ouro does not fit easily in Alencar’s oeuvre, nor does it quite fit the model that Schwarz erects around his reading of Senhora.21 In any event, throughout Sonhos d’Ouro Ricardo holds out against all temptation, although in the end Alencar arranges a romantic solution that allows the happy ending—the wished-for marriage between Ricardo and Guida—to take place in a none-too-convincing postscript. Here we see Alencar’s imagination struggling to conjure an alternative social order. The fact that the imagined world where virtue and wealth can wed is tacked on in the postscript should tell us something. Throughout the novel itself this “third” point in the triangle of desire is kept at a great distance.22 It is not presented as within the grasp of the characters, and it is out of reach not because society is too strong but because duty and virtue will not permit it. Setting aside the postscript, Sonhos d’Ouro offers no easy solutions to the thorny problem of marriage between poor virtue and capricious wealth: The girl pursues the boy; virtue is tested and wins out; no immediate resolution is offered; the very boundaries of virtue, where dignity ends and pride begins, are open to question. In his interactions with Guida, Ricardo acts like a poor Mr. Darcy: He chastises her for her willfulness, shows himself master of the situation, and withdraws behind a mask of dignity. Guida, full of life, has the spark if not reminiscent of Elizabeth, then perhaps of Emma. Alencar is no Jane\n\n28 C HA P T E R 1\n\nAusten, and Sonhos d’Ouro is no Pride and Prejudice. Alencar’s chaste hero and capricious heroine lack charm and depth. Ricardo is stiff and earnest; Guida, although livelier, particularly when her exploits are recounted thirdhand, strikes the same two contrasting chords: caprice and generosity.23 Even so, the fact remains that Alencar manages to evoke the intractable barrier between Ricardo and Guida in such a way that he remains true to the social realities that underpin the context of the story. Leaving aside the problematic postscript, the effect generates a genuine sense of longing in the elliptical circuits of affection closed first in the hills above Rio and then held together intermittently and realistically for the remainder of the body of the novel. Space. Longing. Impasse. These terms have to be added to the shopworn themes of provincial virtue and metropolitan vice. Money does provide the touchstone of conscience, but it neither triumphs nor fails. This is interesting in its own right, and for this reason alone Sonhos d’Ouro deserves to be considered among the highest achievements in Alencar’s oeuvre. Sonhos d’Ouro is rich in atmosphere and detailed descriptions of people and places. Alencar describes with loving care the bucolic setting of Tijuca, where Ricardo and Guida have no less than seven chance meetings. In doing so, he maps an important terrain of elite courtship: a space defined by rustic beauty and opportunities to “get lost,” to escape the patriarchal gaze of fathers and their dependents. Although Alencar does not indicate this directly, it can be inferred from the construction of the novel that Tijuca is a privileged, perhaps really the only, place for a meeting, usually on horseback, between the worlds of Guida and Ricardo. The young man eventually succumbs to Guida’s insistence and visits her in her father’s house, but this occurs only after the seven chance meetings on the trails of the forested hillsides of Tijuca. It is there in the setting of steep trails and shady nooks that Ricardo first sees Guida and returns laughter with laughter; it is on a steep and dangerous stretch of trail that Guida’s dog is knocked off a cliff after nearly causing Ricardo’s horse, Galgo, to tumble down with its rider; it is in the woods of Tijuca that Ricardo shows his bravery and horsemanship in an episode in which Guida rashly attempts to descend a steep slope to pluck a golden wildflower, a sonho d’ouro. All these chance meetings, Ricardo reflects, culminate in an effect much more powerful than any planned courtship could have obtained.24 By virtue of their spontaneity and their marked equality (in these occasions both characters are usually mounted on horseback) these encounters offer a space of equality, predicated on the space of the forest and the social practices of pass-\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 29\n\ning weekend days riding the trails, necessary for Ricardo and Guida’s initial meetings and incipient courtship. To a significant degree, the combination of open space and horses cancels out the inequality in positions. This exception to the rule drawn by Candido with regard to Alencar’s male protagonists’ social inferiority highlights the way that different kinds of opportunities and encounters were encoded in the space of the city and its environs.25 The contrast between the relatively open and egalitarian space of the forested slopes of Tijuca and the claustrophobic environment of Comendador Soares’s mansion in Larangeiras is drawn out in clear lines by Alencar’s description of the presence of Guida’s suitors at a luncheon shortly after Guida has seen Ricardo again on the trails of Tijuca and learned from one of her suitors, the dilettantish Guimarães, that Ricardo is a poor lawyer without social connections.26 Out on the trail, Ricardo has his dignity and his fine Brazilian horse. In the house of Guida’s father, he would be seen as a parasite or a pretender to Guida’s dowry. The luncheon serves to introduce Guida’s three principal suitors: the lawyer who does not practice law and lives off loans taken against his eventual inheritance, Guimarães; the lawyer who seeks political fame, Nogueira; and the wealthy stockbroker Bastos.27 Despite her immaturity and volubility, Guida has for her part, as Ricardo puts it, “a scruple of conscience, I’d even say, a reservoir of goodness” (“escrúpulo de consciência, direi mesmo, um fundo de bondade”).28 With this bit of conscience, Guida can hardly be expected to find any of her “official” suitors appetizing. Guimarães is a cad, the antithesis of the dignified and hardworking Ricardo. Nogueira is a self-absorbed climber who thinks he is more eloquent and expert than he really is. Bastos is just a man who happens to have a bit of money and therefore orbits in the gravitational pull of Comendador Soares’s millions. Ricardo surpasses all his rivals but lacks money, the fundamental source of independence and social position. Without money he cannot be at ease in Comendador Soares’s house; without 20 contos, he cannot fulfill his life plan and return to marry his cousin in São Paulo. Thus the dilemma confronting Ricardo at the outset—whether or not he will bend his scruples to ease his path to those 20 contos (or much more in the case of ­Guida’s dowry)—is enacted spatially. On the paths of Tijuca, he is independent and in control; entering Guida’s private world, he is uncomfortable, tempted, no longer in control of the situation. Inside the house people and objects fall into other spatial arrangements and configurations. The space is filled with rich furnishings, huge dining tables, ­salons for gathering and listening to music played on the piano. Characters interact in\n\n30 C HA P T E R 1\n\nthis space and make tactical moves that take advantage of the material at hand. For instance, in a crucial scene with Ricardo where the conversation reaches an impasse, Guida gets up and walks over to the piano; this concludes the conversation and initiates a different kind of encounter, a different “definition of the ­situation,” as Goffman would put it.29 Once again, we see the utility of this instrument in Guida’s everyday life. Staying seated would mean continuing a conversation that is going nowhere. Getting up and leaving the room would send a strong negative signal. Picking up a book would seem antisocial. The piano is there as a prop. When she needs something to do that frees her from conversation but is entirely neutral with respect to the others in the room, the piano is there for her. Seen in this light, a piano is more than merely a symbol of elite culture or an instrument for the refinement of young women. These immanent characteristics emerge in literary sources, not in the traditional documents of history.\n\nProtection The tension produced in the passage from the open space of Tijuca to the closed space of Comendador Soares’s mansion hinges on Ricardo’s desperate need for money. Ricardo begins the book with a soliloquy on the caprice of money and its ubiquitous social power. He laments his inability to obtain the 20 contos he needs through licit means. At the same time, he imagines how such a sum might be obtained: lottery tickets, card games, unexpected inheritances, the protection of a millionaire.30 It is noteworthy that all these imaginings involve obtaining the money through chance or happenstance, or at the very least by the grace of God. As Roberto Schwarz notes regarding the economic realities of the time, “An honest, independent life does not lie within the reach of a poor person,” and for the large population of free but poor residents of the city, this results in a situation of dependency.31 This situation, the asymmetric but reciprocal relationship between a person of wealth and power and a dependent, Schwarz insists, is founded on the practice of favor. It will do no violence to Schwarz’s argument to add the word protection as a category of favor. The concept of protection has the added advantage of linking the Brazilian bildungsroman more tightly to its European model—both literary and social. In doing so, it does cut against the implicit exceptionalism of Schwarz’s arguments about favor. With his law degree but without “protection” on the part of well-connected individuals, there is no legitimate pathway for Ricardo to earn enough money to fulfill his plans. Protection is a word that recurs in the novel and conjures\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 31\n\nup the pervasive power of paternalism, of client-patron relationships, in Rio at the time. When Ricardo expresses his distaste for Guida and his disinclination to attempt to pursue the connection, Fábio reminds him, “We must make relations, acquire friends; otherwise we’ll get nowhere” (“É preciso fazermos relações, adquirir amigos, do contrário nada alcançaremos”).32 Later on, when Guimarães reveals Ricardo’s identity and social position to Guida, the following exchange takes place: Guida: What’s he doing now? Guimarães: I don’t know. Lawyering I guess; but wasting his time; he’s not getting anywhere. Guida: Why not? Has he no talent? Guimarães: Sure, but what use is talent if no one’s heard of him? He’d be better off with half the talent and the other half protection. Guida: Protection? Guimarães: See here: Businessmen to give him good cases and recommend him to their friends. Guida: Que faz ele agora? Guimarães: Não sei. Creio que está aqui advogando; mas perde o seu tempo; não faz nada. Guida: Por quê? Não tem talento? Guimarães: Mas de que lhe serve se ninguém o conhece? Servia-lhe mais ficar com metade do talento que tem, e a outra metade de proteção. Guida: Como proteção? Guimarães: Ora: negociantes que lhe dêem boas causas e o recomendem a seus amigos.33\n\nCare should be taken before assigning a particularly Brazilian interpretation to this concept of protection. Yes, we are dealing with a society still very much based on personal connections and client-patron relations.34 But consider Madame d’Espard’s comment to Madame de Bargeton on the subject of Lucien, whom Madame de Bargeton is trying to sponsor and thereby introduce into society: “He looks good, but he appears to be a fool and he can’t stand properly or speak; all in all, he’s a poor study. Why ever do you protect him?” (“Sa figure est belle, mais il me parait fort sot, il ne sait ni se tenir ni parler; enfin il n’est pas eleve, par quel hazard le protegez-vous?”).35 It would probably also be a mistake to take these cases of Ricardo and L ­ ucien and ascribe a unique importance to protection for the provincial ­arriving in the\n\n32 C HA P T E R 1\n\nmetropolis, though this is implied by both Alencar and Balzac. As Raymundo Faoro points out in his rambling and always fertile study of Machado de Assis, the theme of introductions and stamps of approval appears throughout Machado’s works and does not depend on a city-country distinction.36 Clearly we are dealing with a range of situations, where the provincial might indeed be said to need protection during the entry period into society in a way that differs from the city dweller with his or her larger social network. On the other hand, the provincial interloper does not necessarily draw the worst cards in the game. The possibility of creating a new persona with the help of a protector is greater for those without too many local entanglements. Choosing the right protector, then, is of the utmost importance. The problem, in terms of Bildung, is that protectors tend to choose the protected as much or more so than the other way around.\n\nMarriage Read superficially, the plot of Sonhos d’Ouro conforms in many respects to the rules of the classic marriage plot, particularly if the postscript is taken into account. Two people, destined one day to marry, meet and undergo a series of trials and overcome a number of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. A classic ingredient present in the novel is the discrepancy between the social positions of the protagonists, although we have seen that this can be partly effaced in certain settings and circumstances. Guida is unimaginably rich; Ricardo has practically no money. Missing, however, is a second typical ingredient: parental opposition. Comendador Soares gives Guida full freedom to choose a husband. The element of parental opposition, which is present in nearly every marriage plot and which certainly reflects truths about social relations and the manner in which marriage was perceived as a kind of transaction between families, is replaced in Sonhos d’Ouro by a different obstacle: prior commitment. For all his talk of independence and dignity, Ricardo has already sold himself to his uncle through his promise to marry his cousin Isabela. The connection to Isabela, to be sure, is not one based on money; neither he nor she has any to speak of. Rather, it is based on “childhood affection,” which we can take as common enough between cousins. Ricardo’s promise to Isabela to make something of himself and thereby allow a marriage, in combination with debts owed to his uncle for assistance during his legal studies, creates a great obstacle for him.37 He cannot marry Isabela without first getting his hands on some money, as Isabela’s father will not consent without first seeing Ricardo established. His pride, in any case, would not allow for it. On the other hand, Ricardo cannot\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 33\n\nwithdraw his commitment to his cousin, because love and scruples prevent him from abandoning his betrothed. Moreover, he is constrained by the significant debts his father left his mother from a mortgage on her house and property that, with interest, had ballooned to 20 contos.38 As the son on whom his family has put all its hopes, Ricardo shoulders the responsibility of repaying his mother’s debts and thereby allowing her to live out her life in poor but dignified fashion. Finally, to further complicate matters, Ricardo needs to repay his mother’s debts so that his sister Luisa can marry his best friend, Fábio. For her part, Isabela faces the difficulty of waiting for Ricardo to make his 20 contos and fending off her father’s demands that she marry another man with a ready fortune. Luisa likewise waits for Ricardo to clear the path for her to marry Fábio. Finally, upon turning 18, Guida begins to feel pressure from her father to make up her mind and choose a husband. Thus the power of patriarchy in Sonhos d’Ouro regarding marriage is expressed through the relationship of fathers to daughters, not in opposing marriage but in demanding it. The tangled knot of commitments created by Alencar for his protagonists underscores several critical issues regarding marriage in Rio circa 1870. First is the obvious issue of money. Young men and women of a certain class did not marry without it. Here, the question is both quantitative and cultural. It is quantitative because the threshold of wealth (or income) associated with the ability to marry can be measured with a degree of precision. This threshold underscores Alencar’s realism, his Balzacian command of the facts of his time.39 It is also clearly a question of culture because the threshold was determined not by objective conditions but by social expectations. What were these expectations? First, to paraphrase Jane Austen, it was a truth universally acknowledged that a sole heiress would be in want of a husband.40 She would find herself besieged by suitors, hence the traditional roles of the father as final arbiter and the mother as coach in these proceedings. In Guida’s case there is only the father, her mother having died some years before. Suitors, then. The shady and tranquil grounds of Comendador Soares’s estate and its enormous dining room with a table to seat thirty provide a critical space of courtship. There, in a choreographed sequence of small talk, food, drink, music, and cigars, the suitors, among the invited guests, maneuver. Gaining entry, this is the first step a suitor must take. As Ricardo makes clear in his debate with Fábio about whether to accept Guida’s invitation, there is no way for a single man of any talent and ambition to appear as anything other than a suitor in the presence of the rich\n\n34 C HA P T E R 1\n\nand available young woman. Marriage ceremonies take place on a single day; as a central concern in life it is always present, coloring the everyday routines of fathers and daughters, suitors and stand-ins alike. From the roster of suitors present together at multiple points in the novel, the following facts emerge. All the pretenders to Guida’s hand are either rich or holders of law degrees. As for age, this ranges from men in their 40s down to Ricardo and Guimarães, who are in their late 20s. Guida is just 18. The dominant cultural expectation, at least among the wealthier and more educated, was thus for marriage to involve a young bride, still in her teens, and an older man, already established with social status vouchsafed by education, pedigree, and money, preferably plenty of it. This leads to an important conclusion: The period of a girl’s Bildung, her education and growth and creation of an individual personality, was extremely compressed by these cultural expectations. After marriage, of course, she would\n\nI L LU S T R AT IO N 3 . “Marriage Markets and Patriarchy Lampooned.” This illustration, which appeared in the November 24, 1861, issue of Semana Illustrada, captures the essence of bourgeois anxiety relating to marriageable daughters. The text at the bottom translates to “In Botafogo there lives a father with four daughters. The gentleman has a mania: he wants to marry off all his daughters at one time. The difficulty is in finding the four bridegrooms . . .” The fat, top-hatted bourgeois father has the girls on a leash, but can he hold on? source: Semana Illustrada 50 (1861): 396.\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 35\n\nengage in a continued process of growth, but the cultural expectation was that this would be entirely subordinated to the career and needs of her husband and later her children. Growth as a wife meant learning to carry out wifely duties with elegance and, most fundamentally, to become a mother, to reproduce. Taking this compression of identity formation into account casts a different, more nuanced light on Alencar’s depiction of Guida’s youthful follies. As a moralist, Alencar doubtlessly condemns Guida’s caprice, in keeping with the mores of his time; but in his Balzacian mode as amanuensis of urban society in Rio, he cannot help but reveal something else: the foreshortened and intense struggle to create a personality, which, in the case of a rich heiress like Guida, takes a particular form.41 Guida’s pranks can be read as rehearsals for the use of the power of money. She is learning to manipulate when she summons the most famous doctor in Rio to her father’s estate to treat Sophie, her dog.42 She tests boundaries while out riding her Arabian horse in the hills of Tijuca. Her playful exchanges with Mrs. Trowshy, her English tutor and companion, underscore her irreverent and independent nature. Taken together, these episodes and descriptions reveal an independent and willful personality. Guida’s youthful caprice is not just a phase she will grow out of, ending in maturity and marriage. It is a strategy for prolonging her youth and holding her suitors at bay; it is the promise of an individuality and independence that will transcend the cultural expectations of marriage. Guida’s unwillingness to marry early and her volubility point the way to an alternative path, one in which her Bildung creates an excess of personality that ensures that her eventual marriage, her eventual integration into the mature world of adulthood, will not obliterate her former self. In this sense, Sonhos d’Ouro is especially interesting from a historical perspective, because it forces the reader to reconsider the relation between everyday practices, youth, and the formation of personality, particularly with respect to women. It calls forth the image of a shortened but highly significant period of Bildung for young women of wealth, and it traces out the means by which an individual personality emerges through everyday practices. In the case of Guida, these are given a particular charge, or valence, in the direction of independence and agency: horses and pianos, trails and salons, elements drawn together in settings—and choices, positionings, the emergence of an individual personality. Guida takes the givens, the mundane everyday she is structurally condemned to live, and makes a personalized version of that world. Moretti, following Baudrillard, points out that “if everyday life is a system of interpretation, the same\n\n36 C HA P T E R 1\n\nholds true for personality: both are ways of reshaping the world.”43 Thus, to ride recklessly is to create space—or, better yet, distance—from the clichéd plodding of the idle rich in the forests of Tijuca, an opportunity to “wander and get lost.”44 To tease and play pranks is to create space, elbow room in which to move in the claustrophobic social space of the mansion, the salon, and the manicured garden. A reputation for caprice allows Guida to flirt without needing to fear the consequences. A key passage in the heart of Sonhos d’Ouro demonstrates this manifold operation of personality in creating space. Guida: Have you heard the news? Ricardo: What? Guida: You still haven’t been congratulated? Ricardo: For what? ... Guida: Very well, I ought to tell you. You are set to marry me. Ricardo: I don’t understand! ... Guida: . . . Don’t worry, I was uncomfortable with these impertinences at first too; now I’m used to them; and I’m even thankful, in this case, they haven’t given me a crazy or useless fiancée, as so often in the past.45 Guida: Sabe a novidade? Ricardo: Qual? Guida: Ainda não lhe deram os parabéns? Ricardo: Por que motivo? ... Guida: Pois então, deve-me as alvíssaras. O senhor está para casar comigo. Ricardo: Não entendo! ... Guida: . . . Não se importe! A princípio também me incomodavam essas impertinências; agora estou habituada; e ainda agredeço quando não me dão por noivo algum bobo ou algum traste, como já tem sucedido.\n\nIn this exchange Guida shows her command of the situation, both in conveying the thinly veiled provocation—you do want to marry me, don’t you—and in showing how she has turned the incessant siege of suitors and the rumors in their regard to her advantage, shielding her from having to take any one of them seriously. Still, she concludes, thoughtfully: “Be patient; tomorrow they’ll\n\nS ON H O S D’OU R O 37\n\ninvent a new fiancée for me; and you can rest easy. I’m the one, unfortunately, who hasn’t anyone who can get me out of the limelight” (“Tenha paciência; amanhã me inventarão outro noivo; e o senhor ficará descansado. Eu é que infelizmente não tenho quem me tire da berlinda”).46 A reputation for caprice allows Guida to keep her suitors at a distance. It does not, as she says, get her out of the limelight. Until she marries, there will be men circling; the subtext of every event and every conversation will be marriage. In the end, this is tiresome. One suspects that a fair number of wealthy young women simply wore down under the constant pressure and chose whoever was close at hand. Guida’s father, meanwhile, has not abdicated all authority. With respect to the rules of courtship and Guida’s eventual choice, he clarifies matters with Nogueira, one of Guida’s long-standing admirers: “On the subject of marriage, my dear doctor, I am the crown and Guida is the Parliament. She has the right to legislate the project and I limit myself to the right to veto” (“Nesta matéria de casamento, meu caro doutor, eu sou a coroa, a Guida é o parlamento. Ela tem o direito de votar o projeto; eu limito-me à sanção do veto”).47 As for his daughter, Comendador Soares made a bargain on her sixteenth birthday. Rather than pressure Guida into an immediate marriage, he would allow her to remain unattached until she is 18, whereupon she would choose a mate subject to his veto and be settled. In the event that there was disagreement regarding the choice, there would be a one-year observation period during which the father might be persuaded to change his mind. As it happens, 18 comes and goes, and Guida insists that the bargain was only that she marry during her eighteenth year. Her father’s concern to see her well married is, along with conforming to social norms, a sign of his care for her future.
