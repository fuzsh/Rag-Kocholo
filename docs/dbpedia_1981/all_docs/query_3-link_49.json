The plot revolves around Santiago, a young shepherd from Spain who journeys across the arid Andalusian area. Santiago is forced to seek refuge with his herd in an abandoned ancient church along the way, and one of his thoughts reminds him that he is destined to uncover Egypt's pyramids and all the wealth they conceal.\n\nThe dream haunts Santiago, and after meeting a wise alchemist, he accepts his fate and departs from the Andalusian farms to fulfil his destiny in Africa. Along the voyage, Santiago and the alchemist meet various strange personalities, and the young shepherd discovers a better understanding of himself.\n\nThe book was a significant success, propelling Paulo into the world literary arena after being translated into 35 languages and selling millions of copies. The Alchemist is a must-read for everyone interested in Paulo's work.\n\nClick here to buy The Alchemist book.\n\nThe Devil and Miss Pyrm\n\nThe Devil and Miss Prym, published in 2000, is a novella that urges readers to think about greed, cowardice, and fear. The plot revolves around an odd stranger who comes to the secluded French village of Viscos with a suitcase loaded with 11 gold bars and one essential question: 'Are people good or evil?'\n\nChantal Prym, a local barmaid, becomes pivotal to the plot when she seduces the stranger in the hope that he will be able to provide her with a more exciting existence than the one she had grown weary of in Hamlet. The stranger gives Chantal and the villagers a choice: they may share his wealth if they agree to murder someone. In this book, Coelho examined the underlying character of mankind and its inclination to perpetrate atrocities for the sake of greed through the lens of this evil proposition.\n\nClick here to buy The Devil And Miss Pyrm book.\n\nManuscript Found in Accra\n\nThe Manuscript found in Accra was published in 2013. The story is set in 11th-century Jerusalem. It depicts the narrative of the inhabitants who lived beyond the old city's walls as crusaders approached, bringing with them the eventual slaughter of the local populace. Like the previous two Paulo Coelho novels, he draws directly on the anxieties and concerns of the city's residents, allowing the reader to reflect on their own emotions. A mysterious individual known as 'Copt' plays a significant part in the plot, delivering talks to fearful people that push them to confront their feelings.\n\nDespite the fact that the crusader army is almost within hearing distance, Copt instructs the scared people to evaluate all elements of their existence rather than allowing terror to drown out everything else that is vital.\n\nClick here to get this book.\n\nThe Witch of Portobello\n\nThe Witch of Portobello, published in 2006, chronicles the story of another mystery individual, Athena, a young Transylvanian woman. Many other characters, some of whom had never met Athena, narrate her narrative, encouraging the reader to ponder essential values such as love, passion, and sacrifice. The book begins with Athena's death and then proceeds backwards to her birth. As the tale is told from multiple viewpoints, it becomes evident that Athena's life is filled with instability and tragedy. Her mother abandoned her as a child because her father was a foreigner. A wealthy Lebanese couple eventually adopts this orphaned girl, and she ends up studying in London, attempting to compensate for the shortcomings of her childhood, only for it all to end tragically.\n\nClick here to buy this now.\n\nThe Pilgrimage\n\nThe Pilgrimage, published in 1987, was one of Coelho's first works. The novel is based on Paulo's personal experience travelling the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain during his hippy years. Paulo's trek carried him throughout Spain, concluding at the northern city of Santiago de Compostela.\n\nThe plot revolves around self-discovery. Like many others who embarked on a long journey with only a map and a bag, Paulo spent a lot of time contemplating himself and the world as he journeyed alone and engaged with pilgrims from all walks of life.\n\nAs usual, the novel has a mysterious figure. This time, Petrus encourages Paulo to think for himself and question society's standards that frequently keep people away from following their true desires in life. If you're seeking inspiration for personal progress, this is one of Paulo Coelho's best book suggestions.\n\nClick here to get your copy now.\n\nVeronika Decides to Die\n\n'Veronika Decides to Die' is a lovely story about hope and happiness. The plot centres around Veronika, a young Slovenian woman with everything a woman in her prime might desire. She has a wonderful career, many boyfriends, and a loving family. She is, however, dissatisfied with her existence and commits suicide. She takes sleeping medications and waits for her death, which never comes.

Veronika falls in love with a person suffering from schizophrenia within the confines of a mental hospital.
