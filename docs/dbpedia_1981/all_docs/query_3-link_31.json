        "text": "This article is part of Overlooked, a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.\n\nIn the 1940s, Clarice Lispector, barely out of college, rocked the Brazilian literary establishment with the publication of her debut novel, “Perto do Coração Selvagem” (“Near to the Wild Heart”). Critics lauded the jagged unpredictability of the book, which charted the stream-of-consciousness reflections of a young female protagonist determined to live freely in a world ordered by men.\n\nThe novel’s publication marked the beginning of a long public fascination with its author, particularly because she was a woman in Brazil’s male-dominated literary world. Even her name drew attention: Though she had lived in Brazil since infancy, she carried her surname from her birthplace, a hamlet in the Soviet Union. One influential critic called the name “strange and even unpleasant.” Others surmised that it was a pseudonym. And though Portuguese was her first language, a partial speech defect that flattened her R’s added an extra layer of mystery.\n\nBut nothing was more compelling about Clarice, as she came to be known among fans, than her words. She would publish eight more novels, 85 short stories, five books for children and countless letters and newspaper columns, cementing her reputation in Brazil and abroad as a writer of great, if cryptic, power.\n\n“Lispector pushes Portuguese (and language itself, I would argue), to its limits,” Magdalena Edwards, the Chilean-born scholar and translator, wrote in an email. “She writes about people who are questioning themselves, their world, existence as such, and her use of language reflects this process.”\n\nLispector and her characters — women “on the verge of exaltation, greatness, dissolution, spiritual ecstasy,” the translator Katrina Dodson noted in a 2018 essay for The Believer magazine — have taken their place in the 20th-century Latin American literary canon and continue to enrapture new readers. And part of what draws them is at the heart of the question, Who is Clarice Lispector?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
