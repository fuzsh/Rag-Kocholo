        "text": "Step 1: Writing\n\nThis might sound obvious, but we can’t overlook the writing process!\n\nWaking up every day and putting in the work to write a book is no easy feat.\n\nHere are a few of our favorite writing tips and resources to get your book ready for the next step: 7 Essential Writing Tips for Authors.\n\nWriting a book is a huge accomplishment. If you’ve made it that far, we hope you take a moment to stop and congratulate yourself on a job well done. Now, let’s get ready to share it with the world!\n\nStep 2: Book Editing\n\nThere are a few different types of editing—and each serves a unique purpose for a manuscript. You’ll have to assess your work to determine what level of editing to start with.\n\nThings to Consider\n\nStep 3: Book Design\n\nThe next step is designing your book! There are two main steps in the book design process: interior design and book cover design.\n\nInterior Book Design\n\nInterior design might not sound like the most exciting part of the design process, but it is necessary to create a professionally published book. Typesetting, commonly referred to as book formatting, has “rules” for widows, orphans, hyphens, and various other elements within a book to make it more readable, ensuring a pleasant reading experience for your audience.\n\nBook Cover Design\n\nYour book cover design is the first impression readers have of your book. While it’s important to be unique, it’s equally important to pay attention to what comparable covers in your genre look like.\n\nVisit your local bookstore and look at the books in your genre. What are the trim sizes? What do the front covers look like? The spines? Take note of the imagery, the fonts, the colors, and more. Observe and ask yourself, what elements of these book covers do I like? How can my book cover stand out—in a good way?\n\nThe back cover of the book will be made up of common elements such as book reviews, the book description, author bio, and barcode. The spine often contains the name, author, and publisher logo. Study these elements to make sure that your book will fit in on the shelf, and booksellers will feel comfortable stocking it.\n\nA professional book cover designer can help steer the creative direction—but you know your book best, and it’s important for you to bring your own ideas to help create a cover that brings your book to life.\n\nStep 4: Book Metadata\n\nWhat exactly is book metadata, and why is it important?\n\nBook metadata may sound complicated, but it’s relatively straightforward. It consists of all the information that describes your book, including your title, subtitle, price, trim size, author name, book description, and more.\n\nBook Title\n\nWriters often ask for tips on how to come up with a book title.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to follow the PINC Acronym, coined by Michael Hyatt.\n\nMake a Promise: let readers know what to expect from reading your book.\n\nCreate Intrigue: engage a reader; entice them to pick up your book.\n\nIdentify a Need: if there’s a common problem that your book has the answer to, identify this common ground and promise (back to P!) a solution.\n\nState the Content: keep it simple and straightforward. What is your book about?\n\nYou Want Your Title to Be\n\nAs you’re brainstorming ideas for your book title, keep in mind that you have an opportunity to enhance your short title with a longer subtitle. A good book subtitle varies from one genre to another, but here are a few subtitle examples to get you started.\n\nNovel: Venetian Blood: Murder in a Sensuous City\n\nMemoir: The Art of Waiting: On Fertility, Medicine, and Motherhood\n\nSelf-Help: No Excuses: Nine Ways Women Can Change How We Think About Power\n\nBook Description\n\nThe cover of your book draws a person in…the title intrigues…and the book description closes the deal.\n\nSo, how do you write a good book description?\n\nKeep it simple and straightforward\n\nAim for 150-200 words\n\nUse paragraph breaks, bold, and italic formats to provide emphasis when necessary\n\nInsert bullet points when applicable\n\nAvoid time-sensitive language like “coming soon”\n\nAnother tip for writing your description—look up reader reviews for books that are similar to yours. What language are they using? Let their descriptions of similar books help guide you as you write yours.\n\nYour description is more than just text on the back cover of a book. It’s detailed, descriptive copy that will be used in your marketing and help your book’s discoverability. You want your description to appeal to a person picking it up off the shelf at a bookstore, as well as Google’s search algorithm. The keywords in your description impact your book’s discoverability online—so be sure to keep keywords in mind as you write and incorporate them into your description when it’s natural and appropriate.\n\nISBNs\n\nYou’re probably wondering what is an ISBN?\n\nISBN stands for International Standard Book Number. It’s an internationally recognized identification number, similar to any product number you would find on other products you buy, like a box of cereal or a pair of shoes.\n\nDo you need an ISBN?\n\nYou need an ISBN if you want your book to be available for sale in bookstores or with an online retailer or wholesaler. You’ll want to purchase this before your book designer begins work on the cover of your book, so that it can be included in the back barcode.\n\nIf you don’t want your book available for sale, IngramSpark can assign a SKU to your book for printing and manufacturing purposes only. If the book is not available for sale with an ISBN, then you will be the only person capable of ordering a copy of your book. You might select this option if you’re printing a book for personal use or as a gift for a friend.\n\nMany self-publishing platforms offer indie authors the opportunity to use a free ISBN. At IngramSpark, we highly recommend that you purchase your own ISBN.\n\nHow many ISBNs do you need?\n\nYou’ll need an ISBN for each format of your book. Let’s say you want to publish hardcover, paperback, and ebook versions of your upcoming book—that means you’ll need to purchase three unique ISBNs.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an ISBN and a barcode?\n\nAn ISBN acts like a product number, while the barcode is how the actual number is translated and readable by a scanner. If you want your book to be made available in brick-and-mortar bookstores, you’ll want to include a barcode with your ISBN.\n\nBISAC Codes\n\nBISAC codes essentially identify what your book is about – the primary genre(s), topic(s), and theme(s). While a reader might not be trained to search for books based on a BISAC code, retailers and booksellers will use your BISAC code to determine in which category to place your book on their website, or where to shelve it in their bookstore.\n\nFor a full list of available BISAC codes, see BISG’s Complete BISAC Subject Headings List.\n\nHow to Choose BISAC Codes\n\nStep 5: Publishing\n\nIf you haven’t yet, now is the time to choose how you’re going to share your story with the world.\n\nThere are various self-publishing companies to choose from—but IngramSpark provides many features that you won’t find anywhere else.\n\nIngramSpark offers indie authors and publishers the ability to create professional print books (paperback and hardcover) and ebooks. With IngramSpark, you can self-publish a book and make it available to 40,000+ retailers and libraries—in stores and online—through our global distribution network.\n\nIn addition, IngramSpark authors receive:\n\n24/7 customer support\n\nOnline sales reporting\n\nFree publishing tools and resources\n\nAffordable advertising opportunities\n\nDiscounts with outside experts on publisher services\n\nSome self-publishers simply wish to print a select number of copies, and not enable their title for distribution—and you can do that! However, if you’re looking to reach the masses, IngramSpark’s distribution network has you covered.\n\nStep 6 : Distribution\n\nIf you haven’t yet, now is the time to choose how you’re going to share your story with the world.\n\nBook distribution used to be a major stumbling block for self-published authors. They would spend weeks, months, even years writing their book. They would go through the editing, design, and printing process—and then would have no way to get it into bookstores and libraries.\n\nNow, indie publishers can receive the same book distribution channels available to major traditional publishers. IngramSpark makes titles available to 40,000+ retailers, libraries, schools, and e-commerce companies including Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Indigo, Foyles, Waterstones, and more across the globe.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Ingram has developed relationships and connections within the book industry to allow your book to be available to the masses. We have print facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, and we have print channels in China, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, and Brazil. By self-publishing with IngramSpark, you’re giving your book the best chance of reaching a global audience.\n\nStep 7: Marketing\n\nLearning how to market a book is essential for indie authors.\n\nWhen you take the time to write, edit, and design a book, it’s easy to get wrapped up in the to-do list and never stop to think about marketing until a few weeks before your publication date. This is a big mistake for self-published authors!\n\nWhile this is one of the last steps in our self-publishing process, we highly suggest that you begin thinking about your marketing strategy during the writing process. Building an author platform doesn’t happen overnight.\n\nConsider the following tactics to market your book:\n\nAuthor Website\n\nIt’s important to have your own website when you publish a book. This lends credibility to your name as an author and is a great place for readers to go to learn more about you, your book, your events, and more. If you hope to create an engaged audience over time, a website is the first step.\n\nSocial Media\n\nIf you aren’t already on social media, then it’s time to look at creating some social accounts. You don’t have to be active on all social channels. Pick two or three that you enjoy—but make sure you ask yourself, where are my readers? If you wrote a young adult novel, you won’t have success promoting it on LinkedIn. Consider the demographics of each channel before devoting your time and energy to it.\n\nAdvanced Reader Copies (ARCs)\n\nARCs are copies of your book that are printed in advance to generate buzz for your book. You can send ARCs to a bookseller to inquire about stocking copies for the release date or to book reviewers to gain reviews for your book before your publication date. ARCs are also used to get endorsements, which can be added to the final cover of your book before printing.\n\nTip Sheets\n\nA tip sheet can also be referred to as a “sales sheet” or a “one sheet.” This one-page paper contains high-level, relevant information about your book—basically, your high-level metadata such as the title, subtitle, publisher, publication date, etc. You can send this to bookstores alongside an ARC, or to the press when requesting media.\n\nAuthor Events\n\nWhether it’s your book launch party or an author reading, events are a great way to connect with readers in your community. Bookstores and libraries are great options, but you should also think outside the box. What other venues might want to feature your book? If you wrote a cookbook, perhaps there’s a local winery or brewery where you can pair some of your tasty food with some local beverages.\n\nMarketing your book can be fun when you take the time and effort to understand your audience and provide them with a valuable reason to join your tribe and ultimately, purchase your book!\n\nStep 8: Join the Indie Publishing Community\n\nThe indie publishing community is a tight-knit, supportive group of creators, entrepreneurs, and go-getters.\n\nFind like-minded people who want to see you succeed. Share your work with them and ask for feedback along the way.\n\nThere’s an online #WritingCommunity that’s incredibly active. Whether you’re on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, every day there are writers and authors sharing tips and encouragement to help each other succeed.Your community might have a writing collective that offers courses, workshops, and meetups. Your local independent bookstore likely has resources to help you succeed in publishing, and the booksellers can help you understand what they look for when they choose whether or not to stock a book. Your local librarians can give you insight into what they look for in a self-published book, and what the local community is most interested in reading. Take the time to immerse yourself in your local literary community before you publish your book. This will make your job much easier when it’s time to turn around and ask for their support.\n\nThe cost to self-publish a book varies depending on your budget, the type of book you’d like to print, and ultimately, your publishing goals.\n\nBelow are the six most common areas in which you may spend money to successfully publish a book.\n\n1. Book Editing\n\nThe cost to edit a book varies widely based on a few factors.\n\nQuality of Manuscript: some manuscripts require more work than others to produce a professional, ready-to-publish piece.\n\nGenre: cost varies by genre. Historical fiction and nonfiction, for example, require more time dedicated to fact checking.\n\nExperience: the cost to hire an editor with more experience will be higher than a newer, less-experienced editor.\n\nSome editors charge per word, some charge per page, and some charge per hour. The Editorial Freelancer Association provides rough guidelines to give you an idea of common editorial rates.\n\nDevelopmental Editing (estimated pace 1-5 ms pgs/hr): $45-55/hr\n\nSubstantive or Line Edit (estimated pace 1-6 ms pgs/hr): $40-60/hr\n\nBasic Copyediting (estimated pace 5-10 ms pgs/hr): $30-40/hr\n\nProofreading (estimated pace 5-10 ms pgs/hr): $30-40/hr\n\nWhen you’re ready to hire an editor, do some research and request a few different quotes. Meet with them, if possible, or have a conversation to get to know whether or not they’ll be the best editor for your book’s content. Have they edited in that genre before? Do you feel like they understand your writing style? Ask them for references or examples of their work to make the most informed decision.\n\n2. Interior Design\n\nThe typesetting process mainly focuses on readability, such as proper spacing and fonts. The cost to typeset a book will vary depending on length, genre, and whether or not you’d like to package it with a final proofread.\n\nAccording to data from Reedsy, a marketplace for book publishing professionals:\n\n17% of people pay less than $500 for book formatting\n\n47% of people pay $500-$1,000 for book formatting\n\n19% of people pay $1,000-$1,500 for book formatting\n\n16% of people pay $1,500+ for book formatting\n\nThe price of typesetting will increase based on the number of images, graphs, and tables in your book.\n\n3. Book Cover Design\n\nThe typesetting process mainly focuses on readability, such as proper spacing and fonts. The cost to typeset a book will vary depending on length, genre, and whether or not you’d like to package it with a final proofread.\n\nThe price of cover design is directly related to a designer’s experience. If you’re going to publish both print and ebook versions (which we recommend), make sure to look for a cover designer who can design both the print and ebook cover. Ask to see examples of a designer’s work before signing a contract and expect to spend at least $500 for a professional cover design.\n\n4. Publishing\n\nOne publishing expense you’ll incur is purchasing an ISBN, if you choose not to use a free ISBN. This is necessary if you’d like to enable your book for distribution, and each format of each book you publish must have its own unique ISBN.\n\nAs part of our catalog integrity initiative, we require that ISBNs are valid and properly acquired.⁠ Each country has a single approved and designated agency that issues ISBNs for publishers and self-publishers located in that country. Bowker is the official ISBN agency for the US; Nielsen is the official ISBN agency for the UK and Ireland; Thorpe-Bowker is the official ISBN agency for Australia. IngramSpark does business in many other countries, so we encourage each customer to ensure they are acquiring their ISBN from their country’s approved ISBN Agency. You can find the approved ISBN agency for your country on the International ISBN Agency's Website.\n\nFor U.S. customers, ISBNs can be purchased from Bowker directly through your IngramSpark account for $85 each. You can also buy a block of ten ISBNs from Bowker for $295. At IngramSpark, we believe it's in your best interest to be recognized as the owner of your work and a publisher in your own right, which is why we encourage publishers to purchase their own ISBNs.\n\nIf you want your book to be available in brick-and-mortar bookstores, you’ll need a barcode in addition to your ISBN. Some ISBN services sell barcodes, as well as ISBNs, but you can use IngramSpark’s book cover template generator to get a free barcode.\n\n5. Printing & Shipping\n\nThe cost to print and ship a book with IngramSpark depends on the following:\n\nTrim Size\n\nInterior Color and Paper\n\nBinding Type (paperback or hardback)\n\nLaminate Type (gloss, matte, or textured)\n\nPage Count\n\nQuantity\n\nShip-To Address\n\nIngramSpark has a Print and Ship Calculator to help you understand how much it will cost.\n\n6. Book Marketing\n\nWhen you determine your overall publishing budget, make sure that you factor in a portion for marketing.\n\nAccording to a NetGalley study, \"as authors' budgets increased, so did their corresponding spend on marketing and advertising.\"\n\nInvesting in marketing initiatives with which you can track dollars directly to sales is a good tactic for those with a smaller budget and less freedom to experiment. Whether you’re putting in the work yourself or hiring a book marketing expert, it requires careful planning to successfully execute a marketing campaign."
