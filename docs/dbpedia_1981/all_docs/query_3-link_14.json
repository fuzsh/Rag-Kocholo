        "text": "Brazilian literature has a tremendous amount of depth, character, and history, so we’ve collated a list of the best Brazilian authors and novelists of all time.\n\nBrazil is globally recognized for its rich history, incredible food, cultural diversity, and colorful street festivals. The diversity of South America’s most populous country is reflected in the books and novels written by Brazilian writers.\n\nMany of the most respected Portuguese language authors, such as Euclides da Cunha and Clarice Lispector, are Brazilian, and the English translations of their books have been sold worldwide. The Latin American titans of literature in this post have profoundly impacted writers from every country, especially within 20th-century modernism and magical realism circles.\n\nAlthough the influence of Brazil’s old colonizer, Portugal, is still evident in much of the country’s literature since gaining independence in the 19th century, Brazilian novelists have developed a unique style and voice. Consider adding the 15 Brazilian writers in this list to your reading list if you want to expand your knowledge of Latin American literature.\n\nPopular Brazilian Authors\n\n1. Euclides da Cunha, 1866 – 1909\n\nEuclides da Cunha is one of Brazi’s most respected 19th-century writers. Cunha was born in Rio de Janeiro and built a successful career as a soldier, sociologist, engineer, and author. Although Euclides da Cunha was born several decades after Brazil successfully kicked out the Portuguese, the country continued to suffer severe socio-economic turmoil.\n\nAs a result, Cunha’s work often covered the most pressing issues facing independent Brazil. He made a name for himself as a war correspondent during the War of Canudos, which saw the Brazilian state suppress a rebellion in the Bahia State in the 1890s.\n\nCunha’s book on the war titled Backlands: the Canudos Campaign is the go-to book for anyone looking to learn more about the War of Canudos and the political state of Brazil in the late 19th century. The book has been translated into several languages, and the English translation was re-published by Penguin Classics in 2010. The Backlands solidified Cunha’s place among the top Latin American writers of the 19th century.\n\nIn light of all this, we are held in sway by a mournful impression as we cross this unknown stretch of the backlands.\n\nEuclides da Cunha\n\n2. Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, 1839 – 1908\n\nBorn in Rio de Janeiro a decade after Brazilian independence, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis is one of the founders of Brazil’s literary movement as an independent country. He is primarily known for his poetry, short stories, and novels. Joaquim was born into a humble family and lost his mother at an early age. Despite receiving no formal education, he learned German, French, and Greek.\n\nAs a multi-lingual young man, he was always drawn to books and worked odd jobs at his local library and printing shop. He started writing short stories and quickly gained a reputation in Portuguese literary circles. His outstanding ability was formally recognized in 1897 when he became the president of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.\n\nPublished in 1899, Dom Casmurro is one of the most important pieces of Latin American literature from the late 19th century. The novel is a fictional memoir of a jealous husband with overtones of dark comedy portrayed through Joaquim’s unique realism style.\n\nIf you enjoyed our round-up of the best Brazilian authors, we have many more articles on the best authors from around the globe. You might want to check out our list of the best Mexican authors. Or use the search bar at the top right of the page to search for authors in a country or region you are interested in.\n\nThere is nothing worse than giving the longest of legs to the smallest of ideas.\n\nJoaquim Maria Machado de Assis\n\n3. Jorge Amado, 1912 – 2001\n\nJorge Amado is one of the best-known Brazilian writers on the global stage, as his work has been translated into more than 40 languages. He started writing at an early age, and at 18, he published his first novel, The Country Of Carnival.\n\nAmado grew up on a plantation in the Brazilian state of Bahia, and much of his work integrates his early life experiences into captivating fictional narratives. His work is very varied, with his stories flipping from serious themes of racism and poverty to lighthearted tales of love and misfortune.\n\nCaptains of the Sands follows a group of orphans who survive using their cunning and ingenuity in the impoverished slums of Bahia. The story is both tragic and amusing at the same time and a perfect read for people looking to learn more about the difficulties many Brazilians faced in the 20th century.\n\nDona Flor and her Two Husbands is Amado’s most well-known title. The novel follows the story of a terrible gambler and an unlikely love affair.\n\nI am a writer who has written about the life of my people, the character of my people. What I can say is that the greatest hero of the Brazilian novel is the Brazilian people.\n\nJorge Amado\n\n4. Clarice Lispector, 1920 – 1977\n\nThe Ukrainian-Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector is a 20th-century novelist and short story writer born to Jewish parents in Soviet-ruled Ukraine USSR who fled to Brazil to escape persecution.\n\nShe went on to study law but was distracted from her legal career by her passion for writing. She became a respected journalist when Pan Magazine published her story Triunfo in 1940.\n\nShe continued writing novels while working as a journalist. In her early 20s, she became a well-known Portuguese language writer with her novel Near to the Wild Heart, which followed the story of a young writer told using an inner monologue style that was completely new in the Brazilian literary world. Another brilliant novel by Clarice Lispector is The Passion According, which follows a wealthy Brazilian who suffers a moral crisis after crushing a cockroach.\n\nEverything in the world began with a yes. One molecule said yes to another molecule and life was born.\n\nClarice Lispector\n\n5. Hilda Hilst, 1930 – 2004\n\nHilda Hilst, the 20th-century Brazilian novelist, playwright, and poet, was one of the leading female Brazilian authors who often explored themes of women’s rights, sexual liberation, and insanity.\n\nHer reason for focusing on insanity stems from the fact that her father, a coffee plantation holder, had schizophrenia. Her interest in women’s rights and sexual liberation is believed to be connected to her mother, an ultra-conservative immigrant.\n\nIt wasn’t until the 21st century that Hilst’s work gained respect globally as publishers began to show interest in translating her stories into English. With My Dog Eyes: A Novel was published in English by Melville House in 2014 and is widely regarded as Hilst’s finest work. The collection of short stories explores a professor’s descent into insanity. If you enjoyed this guide on the best Brazilian authors, you might be interested in our round-up of the best Ukrainian authors.\n\nHe had understood only in that instant. And now, never again? He recalled everything perfectly.\n\nHilda Hilst\n\n6. Rubem Fonseca, 1925 – 2020\n\nThe Brazilian novelist and short story writer Rubem Fonseca was born in Minas Gerais and worked as a police commissioner before becoming a professional writer.\n\nAs a police officer, Fonseca got to know the darker side of Brazilian society in the middle of the 20th century when the city where he worked, Rio de Janeiro, was a hotspot for violent crime.\n\nWhile working the beat, Rubem Fonseca spent his spare time writing short stories. In the 70s, his hobby snowballed into a profitable side hustle and later a full-time job.\n\nNaturally, his life experience meant he took inspiration from what he saw and people he met as a police officer for his crime fiction novels. Fonesca’s short story collection, The Crimes of August, is a fantastic book for crime fiction fans looking to discover one of Latin America’s most entertaining modern writers.\n\n“No writer really likes to write. I like to make love and drink wine. At my age I shouldn’t lose time with anything else, but I can’t stop writing. It’s a disease.”\n\nRubem Fonseca\n\n7. Paulo Coelho, 1947 –\n\nThe Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho is one of Latin America’s most well-known literary figures. His work has been translated into dozens of languages, and he’s sold over 30 million copies. He uses bizarre lead characters to build fantastic stories that weave together aspects of fantasy with hard truths about life and profound ideas about the meaning of life.\n\nDuring his extensive career, he has traveled the world, often wandering off the beaten track and meeting people from all walks of life. The richness of his life experience is reflected in the captivating characters he creates in his novels.\n\nAlthough it’s hard to recommend just one of Coelho’s books, arguably the best place to start is with The Alchemist, which follows a young Spaniard’s epic journey to find a lost treasure in Egypt. For an extensive list of Paulo Coelho’s work, check out our list of his 12 best books.\n\n“It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”\n\nPaulo Coelho\n\n8. Moacyr Scliar, 1937 – 2011\n\nMoacyr Scliar was born to Jewish parents in Eastern Europe who fled to Brazil to escape Nazi persecution. He was born in Porto Alegre, a part of Brazil well-known for its large German population, which grew after the end of World War II.\n\nHis work focuses on the Jewish experience in Brazil in the 20th century. Scliar published over 100 works during his career, with the most famous being Max and Cats.\n\nThe book follows the story of a young Jewish man forced to flee Germany. On his way to Brazil, he finds himself stuck on a small boat with no one for company other than a jaguar that was traveling in the hold. The journey is symbolic of the threats Jews faced in Europe.\n\nMax and Cats plot will ring a bell for anyone familiar with Yann Martel’s Life of Pi which was published two decades later. Some people have pointed out that Martel’s work could have been plagiarized.\n\n“We weren’t quite sure what concubines were, but we guessed: a concubine … Concubines! One thousand!”\n\nMoacyr Scliar\n\n9. Adriana Lisboa, 1970 –\n\nThe Brazilian writer from Rio de Janeiro, Adriana Lisboa, has already impacted Brazilian literature and is expected to release plenty more fantastic books in the second half of her career. At a young age, Adriana Lisboa moved to France to study and later settled down in the United States. She’s experienced life on three continents, so her novels often tap into themes related to moving and migration.\n\nShe has also worked as a translator bringing some of the most important Brazilian novels onto the global stage.

Naturally, many characters are pessimists as they’ve grown up surrounded by poverty and violence. In his book Vidas Secas (Barren Lives), he tells the story of poverty through a cyclical timeline that follows the relationship between droughts and famine in Brazil.\n\n“Writing should be done the way Alagoan laundry-women do their work. They start with an initial washing, wetting the dirty clothes at the edge of a pond or stream, wringing out the cloth, wetting it again, then again wringing it.“\n\nGraciliano Ramos\n\n13.

Iracema is a story about the creation of modern Brazil through the eyes of a colonist who falls in love with a native woman.

Drummond often highlights the struggles and tragedies of the 20th-century lifestyle. His poetry is especially critical of modernity, exploring the plight of both the modern man and woman. Multitudinous Heart: Selected Poems is a collection of Drummond’s best poems that tell stories of life in his small mining town in Minas, touch on themes of social issues, and explore the concept of individualism.\n\n“Be happy for no reason is the most authentic form of happiness.”\n\nCarlos Drummond\n\n15.

She began writing at an extremely young age, and by the time she turned 18, she was a published poet. Her work focuses heavily on Brazilian culture, often employing powerful imagery to emphasize some of the more unique aspects of Brazil and its people.\n\nShe spent countless hours writing as a child, and she firmly believed that if more children find their passion for literature, they would live richer lives.

It’s a great read if you want to learn more about Brazilian culture through poetry.\n\n“Here is my heritage:\n\nThis solitary sea —\n\nOn one side it was love\n\nAnd on the other forgetfulness.”\n\nCecilia de Meireles\n\nThe Final Word On Brazilian Authors\n\nFrom the metropolises of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to the small mining towns and countryside, Brazilian writers from all walks of life have produced some fantastic novels, books, and poems in the past two centuries. Brazil is a country of contradictions, full of color and life, as well as poverty and strife making Brazil a true melting pot."
