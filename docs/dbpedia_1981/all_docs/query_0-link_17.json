        "text": "The sociologist and anthropologist Gilberto Freyre (1900-1987), author of The Masters and the Slaves (1933), and historian Sérgio Buarque de Holanda (1902-1982), author of Roots of Brazil (1936), are considered two of the main interpreters of Brazilian society, having both produced works that continue to impact the understanding of Brazil. According to some, these were the works that \"invented Brazil\". In this essay, I seek to analyze these authors' experiences while abroad and the impact this had on the production process of their best-known works. In the case of Gilberto Freyre, I highlight his academic training in the United States, and in the case of Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, his free training in Germany. As this work shows, different academic and cultural experiences abroad led to different interpretations of Brazil. Based on the analysis of their biographies and best-known works, I highlight how some of the main interpretations of Brazilian society were made possible by the particular \"intellectual diaspora\" in which they participated, and identify some of the key influences permeating their work.\n\nAbstract submitted for ‘VI International Conference of ABIL’ University of Exeter, 7-8 September 2015, Exeter, UK Manuela Moreira Graduate Student - Faculty of Arts – University of Porto, Portugal Revising Brazil’s history in “Visitação” by António Franco Alexandre My paper aims to illustrate how António Franco Alexandre’s poetry, which is often perceived as deprived of meaning, can actually convey a wide range of meanings. For example, in a long poem called “Visitação”, based on an actual tour by the Portuguese poet to and through Brazil, one is left with a sense of unease whilst reading the poem. However, the allusions found in its fragments offer the possibility of engaging in a reading which puts together the pieces, thus enabling the reader to build a story that subverts the history of Brazil, as narrated by the Portuguese. Hence, the reader embarks on a journey which unveils the history of Brazil’s colonization, by foregrounding the plight of the people who suffered at the hands of the colonizer. Furthermore, the speaker pays tribute to Brazilian literature and language variety. As a matter of fact, the originality of this poem lies in reading Brazil’s history through the lens of postcolonial studies, despite its authorial voice being located in the space of the former colonial power."
