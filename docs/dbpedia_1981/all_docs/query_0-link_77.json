Metropolitan Union of Education and Culture, University Center for Agricultural and Health Sciences. Lauro de Freitas / BA, Brazil., 2 -Bachelor of Physical Education from the Federal University of Vale do São Francisco - UNIVASF. Petrolina / PE, Brazil.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChronic non-communicable diseases are responsible for about 60% of deaths worldwide, including Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). In turn, CKD is a risk factor for the onset of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). These disorders affect the quality of life of individuals who have it. In this context, physical exercise becomes an important ally in the treatment and reduction of MDD, in addition to bringing other benefits such as reduced body adiposity, decreased blood pressure and improved lipid profile of its practitioners.\n\nAIM\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between physical activity and major depressive disorder in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis study followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and consists of a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA search was performed in 4 databases, Scielo, Pubmed, Embase and Scopus, where 51 clinical trials were found, excluding 7 duplicate articles, but only 3 were eligible for meta-analysis. All studies used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to classify patients as mild, moderate and severe. The average in years of dialysis was 7.7 and 6.1 in the intervention group of 2 works. All patients who had severe, mild or moderate depression in the intervention group at the end of the studies did not present any degree of depression. Cycling was used as an intervention. The frequency of physical exercise was 3 times a week. None of the patients were using psychotropic or antidepressant agents. The meta- analysis showed benefits for reducing major depressive disorder [- 1.30 (–2.01, –0.59), p < 0.0003].\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPhysical exercise is an effective tool with intervention to reduce symptoms in patients with mild, moderate and severe depression associated with chronic kidney disease.\n\nThromboembolic complications in patients with acute myeloid leukemia\n\nAleksandar Kara-Jovanović1, Jelisaveta Rudan1, Mirjana Mitrović2\n\n1 - Medical Faculty University of Belgrade, 2 - Institute of Hematology, Clinical center of Serbia, Medical faculty University of Belgrade\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe risk of thromboembolic events (TE) in patients with hematologic malignancies was thought to be lower in comparison to solid tumors. Still, new research suggests it is similar or even higher in those with hematologic illnesses. Incidence of TE in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) varies in different studies between 2 and 13%. Additionally, there is no clear data on predictive factors for TE, nor guides for thromboprophylaxis.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of this study is to acquire data on the frequency of TE, therapy, localization, disease stage upon diagnosis and prognostic factors for their onset.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis retrospective study will include 150 patients diagnosed and treated for AML in the Hematology Clinic at the Clinical Center of Serbia, diagnosed according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations.\n\nRESULTS\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) developed in 18% (n = 27) patients. Most frequently, it was the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 17.33%, 16% of patients with central venous catheter (CVC) related thromboembolism, and 0.67% with pulmonary embolism (PE). Arterial thrombosis was not noted. Thrombosis usually occurred during the phase of administration of consolidation therapy (41.94%). Discrepancy between the groups with and without VTE was statistically relevant, concerning: gender (p = 0.009), D-dimer (p < 0.001) and lethal outcome (p = 0.002). Patients with VTE lived longer in comparison with the group without VTE (p = 0.001, SE = 0.482, 95% CI 3.056 – 4.944). The group of AML patients with thrombosis (median 10 months (0.5 – 46); SE = 3.92, 95% CI 2.324 - 17.676) had a higher five-year survival rate than the one without (median 3 months (0 – 38); SE = 0.533, 95% CI 1.955 – 4.045). After thrombosis, 24 patients were treated using anticoagulant therapy.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur study showed a higher incidence of VTE then in previously published studies. Furthermore, our study showed that male patients in consolidation with a CVC and an initial high D-dimer should be considered for thromboprophylaxis.\n\nComparison of Vitamin D Level in Preterm and Term Infant–Mother Pairs\n\nMinoo Fallahi1, Ali Sheikhy2\n\n1 - Neonatal Health Research Center (NHRC), Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Mofid Hospital, Tehran, Iran, 2 - Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the general population. Pregnancy and preterm delivery are known as risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Consequently, vitamin D level in women with preterm deliveries might vary from those with term pregnancies.\n\nAIM\n\nIn this study we aimed to compare vitamin D level in term and preterm infant-mother pairs.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of Mahdieh Hospital in Tehran, Iran in 2013. Serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in preterm infant-mother pairs (≤ 32 weeks of gestation and birth weight ≤ 1500 g) was compared with term infant-mother pairs within the first 24 hours after delivery.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn total, 62 infant-mother pairs were recruited in this study, including 33 preterm (53.2%) and 29 term (46.8%) newborns; overall, 32 (51.6%) infants were male. the mean maternal age was 27.3 years in the preterm group and 26.4 years in the term group. The mean serum vitamin D level in preterm infants and their mothers was 13.91 ng/ml (range: 4–59 ng/ml) and 14.91 ng/ml (range:8–62 ng/ml). Also, the mean vitamin D level in term infants and mothers was 13.39 and 13.7 ng/ml. In total, 48.5% and 65.5% of preterm and term groups had vitamin D deficiency, respectively. Among all newborns, 56% had vitamin D deficiency, although the difference between term and preterm neonates was not statistically significant. Also, there was no significant correlation between the infants’ serum vitamin D level and birth weight. Based on the findings, serum vitamin D levels in mothers and newborns were significantly correlated (P < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccording to the present study, there was no significant correlation between gestational age and vitamin D level in infant- mother pairs; however, vitamin D levels in mothers and newborns were significantly correlated.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nThe authors would like to thank the Neonatal Health Research Center for their support and the nursing staff of Mahdieh Hospital for their cooperation in data collection.\n\nComparison of Maternal Serum and Umbilical Cord Blood Leptin Level in IUGR Neonates\n\nHedyeh Saneifard1, Aida Fallah Zadeh2\n\n1 - Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, 2 -Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGestational weight gain is an impressive factor in the fetal outcome. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is one of the most important problems during fetal period that may lead to many perinatal and long-term complications and growing neonatal morbidities and mortalities.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to ascertain the relationship between umbilical cord blood leptin concentration and fetal growth in neonates born with intrauterine growth restriction.\n\nMETHODS\n\nMaternal serum and umbilical cord blood leptin concentration were measured by immune radiometric assay at term gestation. The study was conducted on 22 women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies as control group (group A) and 22 women with fetal growth restriction in singleton pregnancies as case group (group B). All subjects had normal pregravid body mass index (BMI).\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe results of the study showed that maternal serum leptin concentrations were significantly higher in group B comparing to group A (44ng/ml [28.9–58.2] vs. 24.6ng/ml [18.8–33.3]; P < 0.001). However, umbilical cord blood leptin levels were significantly lower in group B comparing to group A (8.6 ng/ml [range 4.5–12.7] vs. 14.6 ng/ml [11.7–16.7]; P < 0.001). Moreover, umbilical cord blood leptin levels were directly correlated with maternal BMI and neonatal birth weight in both groups.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn growth-restricted fetuses at term, umbilical cord blood leptin concentrations were significantly lower than normal fetuses, suggesting that fetal adipose tissue is a major source for leptin production. Maternal serum leptin concentrations were higher in the presence of a growth restricted fetuses. This increas may be due to early hypoxia or an intrinsic placental mechanism, by which small placenta produces more leptin as a compensatory mechanism. Human recombinant leptin may have some roles in the treatment of IUGR fetuses in future.\n\nImpact of the risks factors, age and gender on radiographic presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis\n\nEsma Kadrić1, Ivana Đurošev2\n\n1 - Pulmonology Clinic of the Clinical Centre of Serbia, 2 -Cardiology Clinic of the Clinical Centre of Serbia\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTuberculosis is still one of the leading causes of death in bacterial infections today. Therefore, knowledge of the risk factors and their impact on the beginning of the disease is crucial for the early diagnosis and course of tuberculosis.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of this study is to determine the influence of the risk factors, age and gender on radiographic presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients who were treated at the Pulmonology Clinic of the Clinical Center of Serbia.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe study was conducted in the Clinic for pulmonology in the Clinical Centre of Serbia as a retrospective observational study, which enrolled patients with tuberculosis from 2017–2019. The variables included in the study, in addition to gender and age, are diabetes, alcoholism, smoking, HIV, drug addiction and socioeconomic conditions.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 46 patients were analyzed, among which were 24 men (52.2%) and 22 women (47.8%). The average age of patients was 52.90 ± 17.41 years. The results indicate that there is no statistically significant correlation between risk factors, age, sex with the radiographic presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis (p≥ 0.05). In contrast, the changes were most often found in the right upper lobe (52.2%). Smokers and alcoholics had the most frequent changes in the left upper lobe, and diabetics and patients who live in poor socioeconomic conditions in the left lower lobe.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the study population, lung changes were predominantly localized in the right upper lobe in middle-aged patients. These results could represent a basis for further research on the correlation between the tuberculosis distribution in the lungs in vulnerable groups.\n\nComparison of predictive value of risk scores regarding the short-term and long- term prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention\n\nIvana Durosev1, Esma Kadric1\n\n1 - University of Belgrade, Faculty of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPrimary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) presents standard treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In order to predict the prognosis of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), several risks scores risk have been developed.\n\nAIM\n\nWe aimed to compare the predictive value of three validated risk scores, regarding intrahospital, short-term (30-days) and long-term (1-year) mortality among patients with a diagnosis of STEMI treated with pPCI in the Catheterization lab, CCS.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis retrospective study included 311 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of STEMI treated with pPCI in 2017. Patients with cardiogenic shock at admission were excluded. Data were analyzed from the electronic database. For every patient the value of CADILLAC, ZWOLLE and TIMI score was calculated. The predictive ability of the risk scores was compared by area under (AUC) the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves. The short-term and long-term outcome of the patient was assessed by telephone and clinical contact.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe study population was 311 patients, with an average age of 61 ± 11 years, of which 237 (76.2%) were male. Rates of intrahospital, mortality at 30 days and at one year after pPCI were 1.9%, 3.2%, 6.1%. All three test scores showed very good predictive value in predicting short-term mortality, both intrahospital (0.962; 0.986; 0.964, p = ns within scores) and after 30 days (0.920; 0.956; 0.861, p = ns within scores), while after 1 year accuracy of CADILLAC and ZWOLLE was better than TIMI score (0.921; 0.905; 0.786, p vs. TIMI 0.009 and 0.056). Age, three vessel coronary disease and lower admission hemoglobin were identified as independent predictors for one-year mortality by logistic regression analysis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCADILLAC and ZWOLLE showed very good predictive ability for intrahospital, short and long-term mortality, while for TIMI score, comparable accuracy was observed only for a period up to 30 days following pPCI.\n\nRelation between blood potassium concentration and in-hospital complications in patients with STEMI\n\nAlgirdas Rėkus1, Gediminas Jaruševičius2\n\n1 - Faculty of medicine, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania, 2 -Department of Cardiology, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAbnormal potassium levels are a frequent finding in patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) and are associated with poor hospital prognosis. Precise pathophysiological mechanism of reducing or increasing serum K levels impairs the prognosis of patients with STEMI is uncertain. STEMI-induced stress is associated with several systemic metabolic changes, such as increased plasma catecholamine concentrations, free fatty acids, glucose, glycerol, cortisol, and cyclic adenosinophenophosphate [1,2]. Moreover, increased catecholamines in acute myocardial infarction stimulates the Na + −K + −ATPase pump, which can lead to intracellular migration of potassium, which may explain hypokalemia in the acute phase [2]. Therefore, STEMI patients with established potassium abnormalities are at risk for in-hospital adverse events. For this reason, this study will attempt to illustrate the outcome for patients who have been found to have low, normal, or excessive blood potassium levels.\n\nAIM\n\nTo determine the correlations between potassium levels in patients experiencing STEMI and the most common in- hospital complications.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis retrospective study involved 734 patients diagnosed with STEMI in the LSMUL KK Cardiology Clinic. Patients were divided into three groups according to their initial potassium concentration. Patient inclusion criteria: hypokalemia (count, < 3.5 mmol / L), normokalemia (count, 3.5 - 5.5 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (count, ≥ 5.5 mmol/L). The endpoints of the study were defined as early complications during in-hospital period (stroke, pulmonary edema (PE), death, atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular extrasystole (VE), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and atrioventricular disease II-III ° block (AVB)). The identification and contact details of the survey participants are not used in the survey and the results, thereby ensuring the confidentiality of the participants. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25.0. Chi- square (χ2) criteria were used to compare qualitative characteristics and study correlations. Student's T-test was used to compare the average of two variable parameters in independent samples. Compare the average values of two nonparametric variables in independent samples - Mann-Whitney U-test. The value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe study identified 158 patients (21.5%) who met the criteria for hypokalaemia, 562 (76.6%) for normokalemia, and 14 (1.9%) for hyperkalaemia. During hospitalization, 7 (15.2%) patients in the hypokalaemia group, 35 (76.1%) in the normokalemia group, and 4 (8.7%) in the hyperkalaemia group died. In the hyperkalaemia group (n = 14), 4 deaths (28.6%) were found to be statistically significantly associated with patient mortality (p = 0.002). PE correlates statistically insignificantly with blood potassium levels. The study identified 35 in-hospital patients with II-III ° AVB. AVB was not statistically significantly associated with potassium test (p = 0.541). VF (n = 49) was not statistically significantly associated with potassium concentration. 61 patients experienced VE during in-hospital stay, of which 12 (19.7%) belonged to the hypokalemia group, 49 (80.3%) to the normokalemia group, and 0 to the hyperkalaemia group. Potassium concentration was not statistically significantly associated with the incidence of VE (p = 0.478). A total of 6 patients experienced strokes, of which 5 (83.3%) belonged to the normokalemia group and 1 (16.7%) to hypokalemia. The incidence of strokes was not statistically significant in the groups (p = 0.899). AF was experienced by 85 patients, of whom 25 (29.4%) belonged to the hypokalaemia group, 57 (67.1%) to the normokalemia group, and 3 (3.5%) to the hyperkalaemia group. Potassium concentration and AF were not statistically significantly related (p = 0.069)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn STEMI patients, hyperkalaemic status was an independent factor related to increased mortality. Meanwhile, the potassium concentration during the hospitalization period does not affect the development of pulmonary edema, II-III ° atrioventricular block, ventricular fibrillation frequency, ventricular extrasystoles, stroke, atrial fibrillation.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Porto, Portugal\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn soccer players, the acute hamstring injuries are frequent, counting 15–20% of all the injuries.\n\nAIM\n\nThe current study aims to verify the impact that a hamstring strengthening program (based on the Nordic hamstring exercise protocol) has in injury prevention amongst soccer players, as well as to evaluate the functional impact of the strengthening program.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA randomized controlled trial including 90 semi-professional soccer athletes in both genders (including 16 females) was conducted. The participants were divided in two groups: the Intervention Group (IG) and the Control Group (CG).\n\nRESULTS\n\nAt the end of the muscle strengthening program (12 weeks), IG showed more strength in isokinetic assessment in both quadriceps (Peak Torque (Nm): 156.48 ± 35.69 vs 176.56 ± 38.97 p = 0.0125) and hamstring muscles (Peak Torque (Nm): 145.99 ± 29.08 vs 168.08 ± 35.25 p = 0.0017), as well as, better sprint performance (4.568 ± 0.857 vs 4.190 ± 0.743 p = 0.0279). At the end of the season, the IG showed better performance in isokinetic assessment, in both quadriceps (Peak Torque (Nm): 149.93 ± 31.66 vs 170.19 ± 40.13 p = 0.0093) and hamstring muscles (138.06 ± 26.10 vs 160.35 ± 31.27 p = 0.0004), as well as, better sprint performance (4.788 ± 0.941 vs 4.279 ± 1.081 p = 0.0194). The IG registered a lesser number of injuries at the hamstring level (IG vs CG: 5 vs 13, p = 0,035), and a lesser number of re-injuries (IG vs CG: 0 vs 3). The average absence number of days due to injury was also smaller in the IG (IG vs CG: 17,4 ± 7,1 vs 22,1 ± 6,6 p = 0,0016).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe hamstring strengthening, had a relevant impact in injury prevention and in functional performance in soccer players.\n\nClinical characteristic of patients with chronic heart failure accompanying atrial fibrillation fibrillation\n\nJustyna Kacperczyk1, Krzysztof Pietrończyk1, Leszek Gromadziński, MD PhD2\n\n1 - Students scientific society of Cardiology and Internal Medicine, Collegium Medicum, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, 2 - Cardiology and Internal Medicine in Clinical University Hospital in Olsztyn\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAccording to WHO, cardiovascular diseases are main cause of death in the world. Chronic heart failure (CHF) concerns up to 1 million of Polish population and almost 10 million are likely to be affected by this disease in the future because of their lifestyle. It is a cause of death for up to 60 000 (30% of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases) people and 150 000 patients are hospitalised because of it every year. Atrial fibrillation is a dangerous arrhythmia common among elder population, concerning about 23% of patients over 65 y.o. and 33% over 85 y.o. [1]. It is a risk factor of diseases such as stroke, which may be lethal.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to characterise patients with chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation in terms of accompanying diseases and admitted drugs.\n\nMETHODS\n\nOne hundred and seventy-nine patients suffering from chronic heart failure and atrial fibrillation, who were hospitalised in Clinic of Cardiology and Internal Medicine in Clinical University Hospital in Olsztyn were included into this study. Data were extracted from hospital intranet and analysed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAmong 179 patients (92 F, 87 M) the average age was 81 (F) and 73 (M) y.o. The most common accompanying disease were arterial hypertension (81%), DM type 2 (38%), stroke in medical history (16%), obesity (15%), cholelithiasis (11%), BPH (10%), hyperthyroidism (10%) and COPD (9%). Patients were taking drugs such as beta-blockers (88%), loop diuretics (76%), ACEI (73%), spironolactone (39%), digoxin (32%). Patients were taking anticoagulants: vit. K antagonists (41%), NOAC (31%), antiplatelet drugs (17%), LMWH (11%).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPatients suffering from CHF with atrial fibrillation are high risk patients for accompanying other disease. Multipharmacotherapy presents risk of organism strain, ineffective therapy and multiplying side effects, so the complex care and optimal pharmacotherapy are crucial for these patients.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Z.

The identification of the GCK or HNF1A mutation has important implications for clinical management during pregnancy.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to assess clinical management and pregnancy outcomes among women with GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed medical records of 36 pregnancies: 18 pregnancies from 13 GCK-MODY patients and 18 pregnancies from 14 HNF1A-MODY women. Patients’ characteristics, their mode of treatment, glycaemic control assessed by the Hb1Ac level, daily mean blood glycaemia (MBG) as well as maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe body weight gain during pregnancy was higher among GCK-MODY patients: 18.5 ± 4.37 vs. 13.16 ± 5.37 kg, p < 0.05. There were no differences on week of pregnancy at first admission to the clinic between GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY group (12 ± 8 vs 10.0 ± 8 week, p = 0.31), pregnancy planning (50% vs 46%, p = 0.84), HbA1c at admission (6.2 ± 0.36 vs 6.0 ± 1.17%, p = 0.14). 66.7% of GCK-MODY and 33.3% of HNF1A-MODY patients changed the mode of therapy during pregnancy. The percentage of basal insulin was significantly higher in the first (40.43 ± 13.75 vs 27.48 ± 13.61%, p = 0.027) and the second trimester (33.07 ± 11.54 vs 20.69 ± 12%, p = 0.017) in GCK-MODY women. There were no differences in mean newborn birth weights (3412.5 vs. 3307 g, p = 0.59) and rates of obstetric complications (27.7 vs 44.4%, p = 0.49). The caesarean section rate was high in both GCK-MODY and HNF1A-MODY patients (83.3 vs. 81.25%, p = 0.89).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nGCK-MODY pregnant women received a higher daily dose of insulin compared to HNF1A-MODY patients. The higher dose of given insulin could be responsible for the greater weight gain among GCK-MODY patients.\n\nThe value of Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) in the assessment of possible intestinal complications in both pediatric and adult patients with Crohn's disease\n\nMonika Piekarska1,4, Maryla Kuczyńska1,2, Monika Zbroja1,4, Weronika Cyranka1,4, Magdalena Grzegorczyk1,4, Małgorzata Nowakowska1,4, Karolina Siejka1,4, Magdalena Maria Woźniak3,4, Agnieszka Brodzisz3,4\n\n1 - Students’ Scientific Society at the Department of Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology Lublin, 2 -Department of Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology Lublin, 3 -Department of Pediatric Radiology Lublin, 4 -Students’ Scientific Society at the Department of Pediatric Radiology Lublin\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCrohn's disease (CD) is one of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Magnetic resonance Enterography (MRE) can demonstrate mural and extramural inflammatory sings and complications which makes it a valuable diagnostic modality.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to demonstrate the value of Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) in the assessment of possible intestinal complications in both pediatric and adult patients with Crohn's disease.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe study included 76 adults and 36 children diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Each patient underwent MRE with intravenous administration of a contrast agent. All the studies were performed using Siemens Aera 1.5T scanner according to a local study protocol. Whenever applicable, MR findings were verified with endoscopy.\n\nRESULTS\n\n40 adults and 36 children had active phase of CD according to MRE criteria. In both groups a thickened edematous ileum wall was the most common manifestation of an active disease. 58% of adults (N = 23) and 89% (N = 32) of children presented with edematous swelling of Bauhin's valve, whereas inflammatory infiltration of the mesenteric adipose tissue was observed in 34% (N = 9) adult and 64% (N = 23) pediatric patients. Penetrating complications of Crohn's disease were particularly found in adult population (40%, N = 16). 18 fistulas (14 adults, 4 children) and 6 abscesses (2 adults, 4 children) were detected.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMRE is a non-invasive and reliable method in the evaluation of Crohn's disease activity. CD manifestations seem to be age-dependent – focal edomatous lesions are more often encountered among children, while there are more penetrating complications in adults.\n\nEffects of vitamin D supplementation on colorectal cancer risk and adenomas: a meta-analysis.\n\nSylwia Skocelas1, Krzysztof Więckowski1, Paulina Pietrzyk1, Patrycja Kojm1\n\n1 - Jagiellonian University Medical College\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEpidemiological studies to-date provided inconsistent findings about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenomas.\n\nAIM\n\nThe purpose of this review is to examine recent literature on the relationship between high and low vitamin D supplemantation and risk of CRC incidence and presence of any adenomas among man and woman above 45 years of age.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe conducted a meta-analysis of prospective and rectrospective studies that looked at high and low vitamin D supplementation, CRC incidence and presence of hyperplastic, advanced or serrated adenomas. Pertinent studies were identified by searching Embase and Pubmed up to May 2020. Of 719 titles evaluated, 7 met the inclusion criteria. There were 2589 CRC cases and 4563 cases of adenomas. Random-effect model was used to combine the results.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAnalysis of the differences beetwen high and low vitamin D supplementation found an association for decreased risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas (OR: 0.91; 95%CI 0.85, 0.98).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis meta-analysis provided further evidence supporting the beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation and decreased incidence of CRC and adenomas.\n\nMilk intake and stroke risk: a meta-analysis.\n\nPaulina Pietrzyk1, Sylwia Skocelas1, Patrycja Kojm1, Krzysztof Więckowski1\n\n1 - Jagiellonian University Medical College\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEpidemiological studies to-date provided inconsistent findings on the effects of milk consumption and the risk of stroke.\n\nAIM\n\nThe purpose of this review is to examine recent literature on the relationship between high and low milk consumption and the risk of stroke incidence and mortality for men and women above 34 years of age.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe performed a meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective studies that looked at high and low milk consumption and stroke incidence and mortality. Pertinent studies were identified by searching the Embase and Pubmed databases up to January 2020. Of 1017 titles evaluated, 7 met the inclusion criteria. There were 6,853 stroke cases. Random-effect model was used to combine the results.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAnalysis of the differences between high and low milk consumption did not find an association for decreased or increased risk of stroke (OR: 1.00; 95%CI 0.89, 1.12).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis meta-analysis provided no further evidence supporting the beneficial nor harmful effect of milk consumption and the risk of stroke.\n\nThe prevalence of White Coat Hypertension in patients evaluated with Telemedicine and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring in Brazil\n\nPedro Guimarães Moreira da Silva1, Arthur Marot de Paiva1, Mariana Braga Teixeira1, Victoria Alves Melo1, Gabriel Baeta Branquinho Reis1, Vinícius Sousa Santana1, Larissa de Moura Goulart Assis1, Fernanda Marinho Machado Guimarães2, Patrícia Mendonça Leite1, Luis Henrique Akutsu Hirako1\n\n1 - Federal University of Goiás, 2 - Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhite Coat Hypertension (WCH) is characterized by persistently high blood pressure (BP)(≥140/90mmHg) measured in the doctor's office and a normal BP (≤135/85mmHg) at home.[1] In order to detect this disorder, avoiding improper drug management, home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is crucial.[2]\n\nAIM\n\nEvaluate, in hypertensive treated patients, the behavior of BP with office and HBPM, and the prevalence of WCH.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA retrospective cross-sectional study of hypertensive patients in treatment, evaluated by HBPM between May/2017 and September/2019. The exclusion criteria were: inconsistent medication use, 3 or more drug-combination, or in spironolactone or alpha-2-agonists monotherapy. The variables: number of valid measurements (NVM), mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP), and mean diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) levels by office evaluation and HBPM and data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and a parametric t-test.\n\nRESULTS\n\n6,731 patients met the aforementioned criteria. The average NVM was 23.5 (±1.6). The MSBP in the office was 132.8mmHg and 84.0mmHg of MDBP. The MSBP in HBPM was 126.2mmHg and MDBP was 79.6mmHg. The difference between the MSBP and MDBP was 6.6mmHg and 4.4mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively. Evaluating the BP control according to the goal of <140mmHg and 90mmHg for the office and <135mmHg and 85mmHg for the HBPM, in agreement with current guidelines[1,3], we found rates of 57.0% and 61.3%(p<0.001) of controlled patients, respectively. The prevalence of WCH was 15.4%(p < 0.001). These results were persistent with treatment strategies with statistical significance.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe literature demonstrates an association between the WCH and worse prognosis regarding patients’ BP.[1,4,5] The collected data revealed the presence of the WCH phenotype in the observed population by the decrease of SBP and DBP when evaluated by HBPM, with a prevalence that is consistent with international studies.[6] These results also show that evaluation and management of BP should not be done considering the office measurement alone and that the HBPM enables the BP control and WCH by providing more accurate values.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Porto, Portugal.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHandball, as a contact sport, foresees technical skills which reflects the dynamics and methodology of physical training, being the handball players’ dynamic balance abilities vital for their performance success.\n\nAIM\n\nThe current study aims to evaluate the effects of Dynamic Tape on single leg hop test and in the dynamic balance in handball athletes.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA randomized controlled trial including 40 semi-professional male handball athletes was conducted, randomly allocating the athletes in two groups of 20 elements each: the intervention group with Dynamic Tape (DT) and the Control Group (GC). The Single leg hop test and Y balance test were performed before and 24 hours after bandage application, according to the group. The statistical meaningfulness was determined by the level of p < 0,05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAt the final moment (M1), the DT group showed better performance in both functional assessment in the Single leg hop test (CG vs DT 1,52 ± 0,18m vs 1,66 ± 0,14m, p = 0,009), and in balance assessment in Dynamic anterior balance (CG vs DT 0,82 ± 0,09m vs 0,89 ± 0,07m, p = 0,009) and in Dynamic posterolateral balance (CG vs DT 0,84 ± 0,19m vs 0,94 ± 0,11m, p = 0,0487). These differences were not found at M0 evaluation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThus, Dynamic Tape has a positive effect in the one-leg horizontal jump and in the dynamic balance when applied in the lower limb of young handball athletes. Therefore, its application as an auxiliary measure to the practice of this sport, might contribute to better sports performance and results.\n\nEvaluation of thyroid function in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure\n\nAna Rita Leite1, João Sérgio Neves1,2, Marta Borges-Canha1,2, Catarina Vale1, Madalena von Hafe1, Davide Carvalho2,3, Adelino Leite-Moreira1,4\n\n1 - Department of Surgery and Physiology, Cardiovascular Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal, 2 -Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Porto, Portugal, 3 -Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Portugal., 4 -Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Porto, Portugal\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThyroid hormones (TH) are crucial for cardiovascular (CV) homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests that acute CV alterations, particularly acute heart failure (AHF), significantly impair the thyroid axis. However, the impact of these TH variations in the clinical evolution of AHF remains largely unknown.\n\nAIM\n\nTo evaluate the association of thyroid function with inpatient cardiovascular parameters, and short- and long-term clinical outcomes in AHF patients.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe performed a single-centre retrospective cohort study including patients hospitalized for AHF between January 2012 and December 2017. Patients missing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement within 72 hours after admission or taking medications that could interfere with thyroid function were excluded. We used linear regression models to analyse the association of TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) with several inpatient cardiovascular parameters, and logistic regression models to evaluate the association of TH with in-hospital mortality, 30-days readmission for heart failure and 30-days all-cause mortality. Associations between TH and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Two models were used: 1) unadjusted, and 2) adjusted for age and sex.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe included population (n = 226) had an average age of 77.5 ± 10.4 years and 58% were female. Diastolic blood pressure was positively associated with TSH levels [b = 2.51 (0.08 to 4.93); p = 0.043 in the adjusted model]. Ejection fraction was negatively associated with FT4 [b = −26.80 (−50.29 to −3–32); p = 0.027 in the adjusted model]. A trend for a positive association was found between 30-days all-cause mortality and FT4 levels [OR = 3.63 (0.93 to 14.18); p = 0.064 in the adjusted model]. Neither TSH nor FT4 were relevant predictors of long-term all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThyroid function variations in AHF patients are associated with markers of cardiovascular function during hospitalization. FT4 may be useful in predicting the risk of short-term adverse outcomes in these patients.\n\nInfluence of Anemia in Heart Failure Progression\n\nDjordje Jevtic1\n\n1 - University of Belgrade School of Medicine\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a chronic and deadly disease, accompanied by comorbidities which severely affect quality of life and survival of HF patients. Studies have conflicting opinions if anemia is such a risk factor, although most have proven its predictive value.\n\nAIM\n\nTo examine characteristics, readmission and survival of anemic HF patients.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe prospectively observed 285 patients admitted for HF. Patients were stratified into anemic and non-anemic, using World Health Organization criteria: Hemoglobin (Hb) < 12 g/dL in women & < 13 g/dL in men. Following parameters were analyzed and compared between the groups: history & physical (H&P), electrocardiography, echocardiography, laboratory, therapy, readmission & survival. Follow-up was 33 months.\n\nRESULTS\n\nOut of 285 HF patients, 45.6% were anemic with a mean Hb of 10.9 ± 1.5 g/dL. Hb depleted patients had higher incidence of ascites (p = .05) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV (37.6% vs 28.3%) on H&P. Echocardiography showed higher mean ejection fraction (EF) of 36% (p = .052, borderline statistical significance) and lower mean left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) of 60 mm (p = .041) in anemic patients. Inotropic therapy prescription (p = .042), length of hospital stay (p = .02) and readmission rates (p < .01) were higher in anemic patients. At discharge, only 13% received iron therapy and mean Hb persistently stayed below 12 g/dL during the follow-up. Death rates were double in anemic compared to non-anemic patients (26.9% & 13.5%, p < .01) and Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed worse survival (Log-rank test, p = .003).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur study yields two important conclusions about anemic HF patients. First is that seemingly better left-side echocardiographic parameters don’t necessarily indicate better prognosis. Second is that, even though it severely affects readmission & survival, anemia is a commonly undertreated comorbidity (evidenced by continuously low Hb). Therefore, clinicians should be aware of anemias influence in HF progression and apply adequate therapeutic protocols to treat it.\n\nSIZES ALWAYS WERE A PROBLEM: Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome in female population of Tetovo Region\n\nDijedona Murtishi1, Atilla Rexhepi1\n\n1 - Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, State University of Tetovo\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is to clarify the impact of age, race and ethnicity, basically at women, being the main focus for study among the researchers, especially taking into consideration the social, economic and lifestyle factors which also affect the occurrence of MetS.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of this study is to gain overview data for Tetovo region, in order to determine the factors that impact the prevalence of MetS in women and therefore be able to tackle them and promote healthy lifestyle.\n\nMETHODS\n\n320 women, a questionnaire was provided, according to the WHO STEPS Instrument for Chronic Disease Risk Factor Surveillance modified for current conditions. The questionnaire consisted of 5 parts. The first part contains general and socio-demographic data relating to ethnicity, marital status, education, occupation, employment, and family income. The second part deals with behavioral data (habits) such as tobacco use, alcohol, fat, salt, fruit and physical activity. The third part contains medical history with hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases. The fourth part with anthropometric measurements and the fifth part with biochemical parameters.\n\nRESULTS\n\n178 participants responded with MetS prevalence rate of 28.25%, of whom 109 (61.24%) were women, with significantly lower HDL-C values compared to men and also 190 women (30.16%), with visceral adiposity. Ethnicity based, Albanian women had greater prevalence rate of MetS, than Macedonian women (34.72% vs 26.83%) between the age 30-39.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn addition, the influence of socioeconomic status, age, gender and ethnicity, associated with education level, family income, physical activity on MetS prevalence rate suggests a MetS prevention strategy planning, including pharmacological treatment that should be directed towards programs to promote healthy lifestyle, awareness for physical activity and body weight care, with the main focus being the categories with lower socioeconomic status.\n\nIgM antibodies and maternal age: risk factors for the development of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in patients with congenital rubella\n\nRodrigo Dominic Cerqueda Audirac1, Laura Escobar2\n\n1 - Universidad Nacional Autónoma de mexico, 2 -Harvard medical university\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRubella is an RNA virus classified as a Rubivirus from the Tongaviridae family. The congenital disease is the worse form of infection by rubella. Some of the consequences of congenital rubella are stillbirth, miscarriage, and preterm birth, as well as organ damage. The eyes are most affected organs, presenting diseases such as cataracts and retinopathy. Factors associated to heart defects, like patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal defect, remain unknown.\n\nAIM\n\nCongenital rubella, risk, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)\n\nMETHODS\n\nA retrospective cohort study was performed to compare two groups of people that accounted for a total sample of 18 patients from the Tigoni Hospital (Kenya). The patients from both groups were confirmed to have congenital rubella; however, only 7 (38.8%) developed PDA whilst 11 (61.1%) did not. The inclusion criteria were: (1) maternal age between 20 and 40 years of age at the moment of pregnancy, (2) patients with congenital rubella from 1 to 6 months of age and with a birth weight between 3.5 kg and 4 kg.\n\nThe variables assessed in the mother and the rubella positive patients were the following: advanced maternal age (older than age 35), month of pregnancy in which the birth occurred, obesity, tobacco use, drug consumption, and presence of IgM antibodies against rubella virus during the pregnancy. Odds ratio was used to determine factors correlation and a Chi square test, to determine the statistical significance.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMaternal age had an OR of 3 (p = 0.04) and the presence of IgM antibodies against rubella virus, an OR of 1.8 (p = 0.049)\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe risk of developing PDA is 3 times higher in patients who have congenital rubella when the mother's age by the time of pregnancy is older than age 35 and 1.8 times higher when IgM antibodies against rubella virus are present during the pregnancy.\n\nThe acute cardiotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil - electrophysiological observations.\n\nMichał Jurczyk1, Magdalena Kinga Król1, Aleksandra Midro1, Paulina Stach1, Kamil Skowron1, Krzysztof Gil1\n\n1 - Department of Pathophysiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Kraków, Poland\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAccording to the recent reports, every sixth death in the world is associated with a cancer and about half of the population will be diagnosed with the cancer at some point of life. One of the most commonly used antineoplastic agent placed on WHO List of Essential Medicines is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) which is also at the second place of the cardiotoxic drugs list, after anthracyclines. Many studies reported, that the patients treated with 5-FU are at the highest of cardiotoxic symptoms after the first dose of 5-FU, although the reason and mechanisms are unknown.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to assess the electrophysiological basis of an increased cardiotoxicity risk after the first dose of 5-fluorouracil.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe study included 30 Wistar rats. The ECG measurements were performed 6 times: before the first injection of 5- fluorouracil, 3 days after every injection of 5-FU (4 doses in total with 2 weeks interval) and 2 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Intervals, waves, and segments of the QRS complex were assessed and calculated.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe highest increase in Pdt and the highest values of QRSt were both observed after the first dose. Furthermore, after the first injection even a stronger increase was observed in aQRSt. The values of QT, aQT, cQT and Tt were similarly at the highest level then.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAfter the first dose of 5-fluorouracil we observed numerous ECG parameters disturbances. These changes represent disruption of ventricles depolarization (QRSt and aQRSt) as well as repolarization (Tt) processes. The electrophysiological findings may contribute to better understanding of the mechanisms of an underlying growth in incidence of cardiotoxicity after the first injection of 5-fluorouracil.\n\nResults in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: six-year experience\n\nNikola Bakić1, Violeta Knežević1,2, Gordana Stražmešter Majstorović1,2, Aleksandra Popović3, Djurdja Cvjetković3, Marko Bogić4\n\n1 - University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine Novi Sad, Department of Internal Medicine, 2 -Clinical Centre of Vojvodina, Nephrology and imunology clinic, 3 - University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine Novi Sad, Department of Physiology, 4 -University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine Novi Sad\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nContinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is one of the modalities for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). One of the biggest problems with this method is the complications and comorbidities associated with CAPD.\n\nAIM\n\nThe goal of the study was to determine the prevalence of complications and comorbidities in patients on CAPD. Also to identify the reasons for transitioning patients to hemodialysis and determine whether there is a correlation between transitioning patients to hemodialysis and particular complications and comorbidities.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe study was clinical, retrospective and it included 35 patients. From complications, we analyzed infections like peritonitis and tunnel infections, dialysate leakage around the catheter, catheter malfunction and herniation. From comorbidities we analyzed: diabetes, hypertension and digestive diseases.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPeritonitis and peritoneal catheter malfunction were the most common complications (51.4%). Next in frequency were exit site leaks (28.6%) and hernias (20%), while tunnel infections were least present (8.6%). From comorbidities, hypertension was the most common (94.7%), digestive diseases (54.3%) and diabetes (42.9%) were present in a slightly smaller percentage. Patients who had peritonitis (p = 0.003), peritoneal catheter malfunction (p = 0.018), and digestive disease (p = 0.007) were more frequently transitioned to hemodialysis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn patients on CAPD, complications and comorbidities that affect the length of peritoneal dialysis and transitioning patients to hemodialysis, as a method of renal function replacement, are present in a large proportion.\n\nThe relationship between body mass index and body fat percentage in medical students from a University in the Middle-West of Brazil\n\nRonan Vieira Borba1, Anna Klycia Monteiro Magalhães1, Kerolainy Estefane Freire Santos1, Pedro Guimarães Moreira da Silva1, Murilo Souza Vieira da Silva1, Lyna Mariana Alves da Costa2, Fernanda Marinho Machado Guimarães3, Maria Eduarda Freire Santos1, Renata Machado Pinto1\n\n1 - Federal University of Goiás, 2 - University of Rio Verde - Aparecida de Goiânia, 3 - Pontifical Catholic University of Goiás\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nObesity, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is defined as excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.[1] Body mass index (BMI) is a commonly used index to evaluate anthropometry, although it is not complex enough to identify the body fat proportion. The bioelectrical impedance serves as an adequate device for the purpose of this evaluation, once it is capable of providing fat levels.[2,3,4]\n\nAIM\n\nAnalyze the relationship between BMI and body fat percentage among medical students at the Federal University of Goiás (UFG).\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis is a cross-sectional analytical study performed with medical students at UFG, in which we evaluate a sample of 180 students (27%), chosen randomly. A Pearson chi-square test with a 5% significance level was adopted. The variables were: age, sex (>18 years), and year of graduation. BMI assessment and bioelectrical impedance were performed using the OMRON-Body Composition Monitoring.\n\nRESULTS\n\n177 students met the criteria and were selected. In accordance with the guidelines[4], the classification of the students’ nutritional status using the BMI revealed that 112 (63.27%) had adequate weight, 56 (31.6%) were above normal and 9 (5.08%) were low weight (p < 0.05). The average percentage of fat was 24.4%, being 31.55% for females and 20.97% for males (p < 0.1). 119 (67.23%) students were above the normal fat percentage, considering a normal range of 8–20% for men and 13–28% for women[4].\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe results are consistent with a high rate of students with elevated body fat indexes, regarding the current consensus.[3,4] The anthropometric assessment also identified that even though 63.27% of the students were within adequate limits of BMI, a high rate also found to have elevated rates of body fat (67.23%). The study limited itself to the descriptive analysis of the data, although it may indicate an uncalculated rate of normal weight obesity among the students. This concept is known to be related to increased cardiovascular risk, metabolic syndrome, and mortality.[3,4,5]\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] World Health Organization (2020, April 1st) Obesity and Overweight.

The levels of creatinine, urea, total protein, albumin, α1- microglobulin, and β2-microglobulin were measured in urine. The research ethics committee of the Bukovinian State Medical University (Chernivtsi, Ukraine) approved the study.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe Median levels of urinary creatinine were 895.0 μmol/l in Group I, 975.0 μmol/l in Group II, 1316.5 μmol/l in Group III (рІ-ІIІ = 0.0089, рІI-ІІІ = 0.0097), of urinary urea – 52.0 mmol/l, 72.0 mmol/l, and 67.0 mmol/l respectively (рІ-ІІ = 0.0354). The Median levels of urinary β2-microglobulin were 4.89 mg/l, 3.4 mg/l, and 6.15 mg/l respectively (рІI-ІІІ = 0.0011), while that of urinary α1-microglobulin – 24.6 mg/l, 17.1 mg/l, and 22.6 mg/l respectively (рІ-ІІ = 0.0169, рІI-ІІІ = 0.0158). There was no significant difference in levels of urinary total protein and albumin between groups of study found\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis result demonstrated that most critically ill PNs have some aspects of impaired of tubular and glomerular functions. This is evidenced by changes in new urinary biomarkers. We found direct correlations between GA and urinary creatinine (r = 0.40, p < 0.05), urinary α1-microglobulin (r = 0.37, p < 0.05), and urinary β2-microglobulin (r = 0.51, p < 0.05) [5]. Longer longitudinal cohort studies on PNs are required to determine the prognostic and diagnostic criteria of RI in these patients.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nWe thank the staff of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Maternity Hospital №2, Chernivtsi, Ukraine.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) provides the means to detect this disorder.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the behavior of blood pressure (BP) with office and HBPM and the prevalence of uncontrolled masked hypertension.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThis is a retrospective cross-sectional study of hypertensive patients in treatment, evaluated by HBPM between May/2017 and September/2019. The exclusion criteria were: inconsistent medication use, 3 or more drug-combination, or in spironolactone or alpha-2-agonists monotherapy. The variables: number of valid measurements (NVM), mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP), and mean diastolic blood pressure (MSDBP) levels by office evaluation and HBPM and data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and a parametric t-test.\n\nRESULTS\n\n6,731 patients met the criteria, among 22,446 selected ones. 61.3%(4,127) of them were considered controlled by the HBPM guidelines, which establishes the home adequate systolic pressure of <135 mmHg and 85 mmHg for diastolic BP.[4] Additionally, the study also showed that 744 patients with controlled BP at the office (<140/90mmHg) had an increased BP when evaluated with HBPM. These values represent 11.1% of the patients and are consistent with masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe study indicated that even though 61.3% of the patient's blood pressures were controlled by the HBPM, 11.1% of the patients with controlled BP at the office fit the phenotype of MUCH. This condition is related to worse prognosis regarding BP management and treatment, as well as to increased cardiovascular risk within the hypertensive population.[5,6] In this context, the HBPM qualifies as an effective apparatus to detect and control the MUCH, allowing medication adjustments in patients under antihypertensive therapy.[6]\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Trudel X, Brisson C, Gilbert-Ouimet M, Duchaine CS, Dalens V, Talbot D, et al.

The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) is key regulator of cellular oxygen. HIF-1α protein is highly unstable under normoxia condition. Hypoxia leads to stabilization of HIF-1α and its expression. This protein is thought to be responsible for activation of a vast number of genes and involvement in pathogenesis of many diseases. Moderate and severe OSA is associated with a significant increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to compere serum HIF-1α protein levels among OSA patients with and without CVD.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe study group (n = 60) underwent polysomnography (PSG) examination and were diagnosed with OSA. CVD encompasses heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrythmia. CVD diagnosis was based on patient's medical documentation. Peripheral blood samples were collected in the evening before and in the morning after PSG. The HIF-1α concentration was assessed using ELISA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIt was found that the serum HIF-1α protein level was increased in individuals with CVD (n = 18), both in the evening (median, 1071.2 vs 1504.9 pg/ml; p = 0.049) and in the morning (median, 1193 vs 1694.4 pg/ml; p = 0.045), as compared with patients without history of CVD (n = 42). In the applied ANCOVA model, only the presence of CVD differentiated serum HIF-1α protein levels in the evening and in the morning: F = 4.737, P = 0.032 and F = 5.477, P = 0.022, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) and apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) did not affect the observed differences in serum HIF-1α protein levels.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSerum HIF-1α protein levels are increased in OSA patients with comorbid CVD independently from AHI and BMI. The results suggest the involvement of HIF-1α in the development and manifestation of CVD.\n\nComorbidities and antibiotic-resistance bacteria occurrence in chronic rhinosinusitis\n\nDaniel Surgot1,2, Iga Grabarczyk1,2\n\n1 - Department of Otorhinolaryngology, 2 -Jagiellonian University Medical College\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a condition where symptoms of sinusitis are present longer than 12 weeks and there are at least two symptoms like nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion, nasal discharge, face pain/pressure and reduction or loss of smell. Currently the correlation between CRS, bacterial flora and coexisting diseases is poorly understood.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to analyse the prevalence of diseases like asthma, aspirin-exacerbated asthma, allergy or GERD, as well as to determine frequency of individual bacteria occurrence and their antibiotic resistance in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.\n\nMETHODS\n\nTo accomplish the study a group of 100 patients with a primary diagnose of CRS, treated in Department of Otorhinolaryngology JUMC, was selected. Each patient was asked to fill in a questionnaire concerning their health and had a swab from the middle nasal meatus taken. Collected data was analysed in relation to comorbidities.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe occurrence of comorbidities was observed in 71 patients. Asthma and allergy were the most common (each in 47 patients), whereas AERD and GERD were rarer (each in 24 patients). In most patients coexisting diseases overlapped – only 27 patients had one of them. The most frequent combination was the prevalence of CRS, asthma and allergy (16 patients). 5 patients had all four comorbidities. 15 different species of bacteria were identified from the swabs collected from the middle nasal meatus. The most common bacteria were S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. coli. Antimicrobial resistance was observed frequently. Most of the patients with comorbidities had 1 or 2 species of bacteria and one patient had 5 bacteria.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn patients with CRS there is a frequent occurrence and usually concomitance of asthma, AERD, allergy and GERD. What ought to be emphasized is that there is a wide variety of microbiota indicated by differences in the occurrence of individual species and their resistance.\n\nBIOMARKERS FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS OF NEONATAL SEPSIS: INDIVIDUAL AND COMBINED USES\n\nBruna Natália Rausch.1, Amanda Saccol.1, Thayane Kühl.1, Fernanda Maurer D’Agostini.2, Liliane Simara Fernandes.2, Marcelina Mezzomo Debiasi.2\n\n1 - Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina - Brazil, 2 - Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina - Brazil\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSepsis presents itself as a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates. For instance, numerous studies seek biomarkers to assist in the early clinical diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis (NS). As a result, the C Reactive Protein (PCR), Procalcitonin (PCT), Interleukin 6, and Interleukin 8, become more noticeable, being great biomarkers.\n\nAIM\n\nThe objective of this study was to verify articles addressing the efficiency of PCR, PCT, IL-6, and IL-8 used individually or combined, in the diagnosis of early and late-onset neonatal sepsis.\n\nMETHODS\n\nAccordingly, research was carried out in the PubMed database in English, containing articles from 2015 to 2020. The descriptors were “Neonatal Sepsis” and “Early Diagnosis,” generating 91 results.\n\nRESULTS\n\nDuring the study, it was indicated that biomarkers contain numerous degrees of viability for use in the diagnosis of Neonatal Sepsis. Thus, there was a greater sensitivity, specificity, and precision of results in the diagnosis of NS of IL-6, when compared to IL-8. Simultaneously, PCT showed greater diagnostic precision, while PCR showed greater specificity, however, both showed very close sensitivities. The use of IL-6 highlighted greater effectiveness in the diagnosis of early- onset NS, with its peak on the first day of infection, with good sensitivity and specificity. PCR, which was the most used in studies, revealed greater efficiency in the identification of late-onset NS, with its peak on the fourth day, demonstrating reduction efficiency in the identification of early NS, in addition to highlighting high Negative Predictive Value and Positive Predictive Value. During the review, the use of IL-6 and PCR concurrently proved to be promising in the efficient identification of early and late-onset neonatal sepsis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt is inferred in this study that the biomarkers analyzed are essential in affirming SN diagnostic hypotheses, however, it emphasizes the union of an efficient clinical evaluation by health professionals.\n\nAnalysis of the quality of colonoscopy preparation in a high-demand outpatient unit in Belo Horizonte: a retrospective cross-sectional study\n\nJosé Celso Cunha Guerra Pinto Coelho1,2,3, Anna Cecília Santana do Amaral4, Ana Campos Pires5, Enzo Luiz Rezende Novaes5, Isadora Catão Silva Lara5, Jacqueline Araújo Lima5, Lucas Oliveira Nacif5, Maria Paula Costa Lima de Castro Miserani5, Nathalia Lacerda Eller Costa5, Rafael Faleiro Guerra Pinto Coelho5\n\n1 - Head of gastrointestinal endoscopy unit at Vera Cruz Hospital (HVC), 2 -Director of Gastrocenter Clinic, 3 -Dean of Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte - Brazil, 4 -Endoscopy unit at HVC Belo Horizonte - Brazil, 5 -Faculdade de Ciências Médicas de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte - Brazil\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn Brazil colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type among men and the second among women. Colonoscopy is the gold standard screening method for detection of polyps and cancer. Colon preparations is a key point for detection. and is considered one of the quality indicators for its performance.\n\nAIM\n\nAnalyze the quality of this preparation in patients who underwent colonoscopy, in a high-demand outpatient unit in Belo Horizonte - Brazil, in comparison with the values required by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).\n\nMETHODS\n\nRetrospective cross-sectional, descriptive and documentary study, about medical records of 757 patients submitted to colonoscopy from november 2017 to november 2018. All patients received writing information regarding colon preparation added with images by a trained nurse. During the colon preparation all patients received a call to check if everything is doing fine and for clarify any further doubts.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3.43% of the patients (26) had an unsatisfactory preparation for performing CL in this outpatient unit. Thus, 96.57% of patients underwent a satisfactory colorectal preparation for the exam.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccording to ASGE, the rate of patients with inadequate preparation for CL should not exceed 15%, otherwise the protocols must be reviewed. [1] [2] Writting information with images explained by a trainned professional and call phones during the preparation should be responsible for results 5 times lower than that required by ASGE achieved at this study.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

There is still a strong need to develop an optimal way of CAP management.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to compare the risk of CAP-induced cardiac tamponade between different coronary arteries.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe retrospectively collected data from seven centers of invasive cardiology in southern Poland over 16 years. During that period, 81 patients (mean age 70 ± 9 years; 56% of men, 80% with acute coronary syndromes [ACS]) with contrast streaming or cavity spilling at angiography (i.e. iatrogenic CAP type III by the Ellis classification) were eligible for the study.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCAP occurred more frequently in left artery descending artery (LAD) (51%, n = 41) in comparison to right coronary artery (RCA) (24%, n = 19), left circumflex artery (LCx) (16%, n = 13) and marginal branches (7%, n = 6), and left main coronary artery (2%, n = 2). The percentage of patients who required urgent pericardiocentesis was estimated at 24% for LAD, 19% for RCA and 33% for LCx. Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed in 67% of patients with CAP in LCx, whereas in only 33% of subjects in CAP in a non-LCx artery (p = 0,03). The tendency remained consistent regardless of treatment strategy: prolonged balloon inflation (PBI) only (n = 26: 67% vs 13%) or PBI with subsequent stent implantation (n = 55: 55% vs. 24%). No differences in demographical, clinical and biochemical characteristics were observed between patients according to the need of urgent pericardiocentesis.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIatrogenic LCx perforation appears to lead to more frequent severe clinical implications compared to other coronary arteries. This association may possibly be linked to distinct features of LCx anatomy and/or well-recognized delays in diagnosis and management of LCx-related ACSs.\n\nEffects of the left ventricle outflow tract obstruction on sudden cardiac death probability in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nAleksandra Budkiewicz1, Łukasz Żydzik1, Monika Kaciczak1, Krystian Mróz1, Arman Karapetyan1, Mateusz Winiarczyk1, Matylda Gliniak1, Aleksandra Karabinowska, MD2, Paweł Rubiś, MD2\n\n1 - SSG of Heart Failure at Department of Cardiac and Vascular Diseases of the Jagiellonian University Medical College in John Paul II Hospital in Krakow, 2 - Department of Cardiac and Vascular Diseases of the Jagiellonian University Medical College in John Paul II Hospital in Krakow\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically determined cardiac disease characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Depending on LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient, HCM can be classified as obstructive and nonobstructive. Both types can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends HCM Risk-SCD calculator to guide SCD management strategy, including prophylactic implantation of cardioverter- defibrillator (ICD). Based on: age, maximal LV wall thickness, LVOT gradient, left atrial diameter, family history of SCD, history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (nsVT) and unexplained syncope, the 5-year probability of SCD is calculated.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to compare parameters of the HCM Risk-SCD calculator among patients with nonobstructive (LVOT gradient <30mmHg) and obstructive (LVOT gradient > = 30mmHg) type of HCM.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe included 245 HCM patients enrolled between 2011 and 2019; 133 males (54.29%), mean age 56 ± 14 years, mean NYHA class 1.83 ± 0.77. The clinical data were obtained retrospectively from phone calls, discharge summaries, and other medical records.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBased on LVOT gradient, 107 (43.67%) patients were classified as obstructive HCM. The comparison of SCD predictors between patients with nonobstructive and obstructive HCM is presented below.\n\nAge [years]\n\nLVOT < 30mmHg: 53.9 ± 14.8 LVOT > = 30mHg: 58,1 ± 13.5 p = 0.02\n\nMaximal wall thickness [mm] I: 20.1 ± 4.6 II: 21.1 ± 4.3 p = 0.04\n\nLeft atrium diameter [mm]\n\nI: 43.6 ± 7.9 II: 44.2 ± 6.7 p = 0.46\n\nLVOT gradient [mmHg]\n\nI: 10.7 ± 5.5 II: 87.7 ± 40.1 p<0.001\n\nFamily history of SCD\n\nI: 12 (8.7%) II: 8 (7.5%) p = 0.73\n\nnsVT\n\nI: 29 (21%) II: 16 (14.9%) p = 0.22\n\nSyncope\n\nI: 16 (11.6%) II: 18 (16.8%) p = 0.24\n\n5-year risk of SCD\n\nI: 2.7 ± 1.9 II: 3.8 ± 3 p < 0.01\n\nRecommendation ICD is not indicated\n\nI: 116 (84.1%) II: 78 (72.90%)\n\nICD can be considered\n\nI: 13 (9.4%) II: 17 (15.9%)\n\nICD should be considered\n\nI: 9 (6.5%) II: 12 (11.2%) p = 0.10\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nExcept for the LVOT gradient, obstructive and nonobstructive HCM patients differ also in terms of age and maximal LV wall thickness. Although numerically 5-year risk of SCD significantly differs between obstructive and nonobstructive HCM, nevertheless, the ESC recommendations regarding prophylactic ICD implantation are similar between two HCM types.\n\nInteraction between hypoxia and circadian rhythm in obstructive sleep apnea patients\n\nSzymon Turkiewicz1, Marcin Sochal, MD1,2, prof. Piotr Białasiewicz1, Agata Gabryelska, MD, PhD1\n\n1 - Department of Sleep Medicine and Metabolic Disorders, 2 - Department of Sleep Medicine and Metabolic Disorders\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic condition that is characterized by intermittent hypoxia. Key regulator of oxygen metabolism is hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), which consist of two subunits: α and β. Circadian clock is composed of set of gens functioning as activators (CLOCK and BMAL1) or repressors (PER1 and CRY1). Under hypoxia, HIF-1α heterodimerizes with HIF-1β and binds to E-box-like hypoxia response elements in the promoter regions of hypoxia-induced genes, which include circadian clock genes.\n\nAIM\n\nThe aim of the study was to assess the relationship between HIF-1α, HIF-1β, BMAL1, CLOCK, PER1, CRY1 and polysomnography (PSG) variables in healthy individuals and severe OSA patients.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe study included 20 individuals, who underwent PSG and based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were divided into severe OSA group (n = 10; AHI≥30) and healthy controls (n = 10; AHI < 5). All participants had their peripheral blood collected in the evening (9:00–10:00 pm) before and in the morning (6:00–7:00 am) after the PSG. Protein concertation measurements were performed using ELISA.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSignificant difference was observed in the following protein measurements between study groups: evening and morning HIF-1α (p = 0.020 and p = 0.043, respectively), evening HIF-1β (p = 0.047), evening and morning CLOCK (p = 0.037 and p = 0.019, respectively) and morning BMAL1 (p = 0.016), evening and morning PER1 (p = 0.004 and p = 0.029, respectively) and evening CRY1 (p = 0.035). In a multivariate general linear model with the concentration of all circadian clock proteins as dependent variables, evening HIF-1α protein level was the only significant covariant (p = 0.025). Evening HIF-1α protein level had an influence only on the evening PER1, while corrected models were significant for morning and evening PER1 (p = 0.008 and p = 0.006, respectively), evening CRY1 (p = 0.043), and evening CLOCK (p = 0.046).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nResults suggests OSA patients are in risk of circadian clock disruption due to present hypoxia. This process might be mediated by HIF-1α.\n\nThe study was financed by Polish National Centre Grant no. 2018/31/N/NZ5/03931\n\nRelation of the enzyme angiotensin converting 2 (ACE2) with gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with COVID-19\n\nLucas Lopes Fagundes1, Ana Laura Oliveira Santos Dias Guimarães1, Melanie Monteiro Rodrigues1, Marjorie Monteiro Rodrigues2\n\n1 - Centro Universitário FIPMoc - UNIFIPMoc, Montes Claros, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil., 2 -Department of Radiation Oncology, Centro Oncológico AZ do Noroeste, Patos de Minas, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is responsible for many respiratory manifestations in infected individuals through an interaction mechanism with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the presence of the enzyme in the enterocytes is also quite dense, explaining the gastrointestinal symptoms in infected patients.[1]\n\nAIM\n\nTo relate the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 with gastrointestinal symptoms presented in patients with COVID-19.\n\nMETHODS\n\nArticles published in English were selected, prioritizing studies conducted in 2020 and indexed in the PubMed database. Descriptors used were: gastroenterology and coronavirus infections. The literature search returned a total of 93 results, of which 4 were included in the final analysis.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the target cell begins with the interaction between the glycoprotein Spike and ACE2. Then, the Spike protein is processed by a plasma membrane–associated type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), allowing the virus to fuse with the human cell and to develop the ability of reproduction.[2,3] The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastrointestinal tract, mainly in enterocytes, contributes to a modification in intestinal permeability, resulting in malabsorption by epithelial cells in this region. In addition, ACE2 is recognized as an important regulator of intestinal microbiota homeostasis. Its alteration may increase the susceptibility to inflammation and, consequently, contribute to the appearance of digestive symptoms such as abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.[2,4]\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nACE2 is capable of influencing gastrointestinal symptoms manifested by patients with COVID-19, due to its synergic action with TMPRSS2, especially in enterocytes, inducing manifestations such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Hence, it is required special attention by health professionals regarding digestive symptoms presented by patients with suspected disease to improve early diagnosis and direct effective treatment, as needed.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

One of the most prevalent etiology in children is Haemophilus influenzae (Hi). In order to reduce the morbimortality from Hi, Brazil adhered in 1999 the vaccine against Hi serotype b (Hib) to its vaccination schedule, but only in 2001 it became a nationwide effective campaign.\n\nAIM\n\nCompare the overall meningitis mortality rate in children between the period of 4 years before and after the implementation of Hib vaccine in the nacional schedule, considered as 2001.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe collected data about the overall and per sex mortality rate from 1998 to 2019 due to all etiologies of meningitis, and the overall and per sex incidence of Hi from 2001 to 2019 in pediatric patients (0–14 years old) from DataSUS database. Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test was performed to describe the normality pattern. The Student's T test was performed to compare between the period of 4 years before (1998–2001) and after (2002–2005) the campaign implementation. We compared between the sexes the meningitis mortality rate using Student's T test and the incidence of Hi using Kruskall- Wallis test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe mean of mortality rate from meningitis in group 1 (1998–2001) was 5.798 (sd = 0.56718), while in group 2 (2002- 2005) was 4.085 (sd = 0.50573), with a difference of 41,93% (p = 0.002). From 1998 to 2019, the male mean from all cause of meningitis mortality rate found was 3.10 (SD = 1.3882), while the female mean was 3.7 (SD = 1.6582) with difference non-statistically relevant 19.35% (p = 0.337). The incidence of Hi between 2001 and 2019 had more expression in the male group, the median was 56, while the female median was 43, with difference of 30.23% (p = 0.007).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccording to our findings, the Hib vaccine campaign could be the responsible for the reduction seen in the mortality rate of meningitis in children.\n\nNeurosciences\n\nIntracellular Fragment of BDNF Receptor, TrkB-ICD: Impact on Genetic Expression\n\nJoão Fonseca-Gomes1,2, Maria Roque2, Juzoh Umemori3, Eero Castrén3, Ana M.

[1] One of the main hallmarks of AD is the accumulation of Amyloid-beta peptide, which induces the calpain-processing of the full-length tropomyosin- receptor kinase B (TrkB-FL) and lead to the production of a new truncated receptor (TrkB-T’) and an intracellular fragment (TrkB-ICD). [2] Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to TrkB-FL and, consequently, its truncation compromises phsyiological function of BDNF, such as neuronal survival, differentiation and sinaptic plasticity. [3,4] Recently we showed that TrkB-ICD is a stable protein that is translocated into the nucleus overtime. [5]\n\nAIM\n\nThis work aimed to evaluate the influence of TrkB-ICD fragment on genetic expression.\n\nMETHODS\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, neuronal cultures were transduced with TrkB-ICD-IRES-ZsGreen (expressing TrkB-ICD and a fluorescent marker, ZsGreen) and eGFP (control). After 7 days of expression, RNA was extracted and whole transcriptome analysis was performed by next generation sequencing in GeneCore EMBL Facility, Germany.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAfter classification of differentially expressed coding genes into functional groups by gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis, we observed several interesting findings. Particularly, we observed that TrkB-ICD overexpression was mainly associated with the up-regulation of genes involved in regulatory responses of neurotransmitter activity and neural development. Whereas TrkB-ICD fragment promoted the down-regulation of genes involved in functions related with chromosome structure stability and telomere organization. In addition, we also observed that TrkB-ICD was associated with the expression of genes related with some specific cellular compartments, for instance presynaptic area, endosome and phosphatase complexes.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this work we show, for the first time, that TrkB-ICD per se has a strong impact upon genetic expression, which could underly some pathophysiological features of AD.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nGabinete de Apoio À Investigação Científica, Tecnológica E Inovação (GAPIC) da FMUL; Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Duthey B. 2013.

It is though that dorsal-ventral patterning of the embryo is imperative during spinal cord development, namely through combinatorial expression of sets of transcription factors induced by patterning signals (1).\n\nPaired related homeobox protein-like 1 (Prrxl1) is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in both DRG and their putative central targets in the spinal dorsal horn, suggesting a functional role in establishing connectivity between first and second order nociceptive neurons. Accordingly, studies on Prrxl1-/- mouse embryos revealed that Prrxl1 is necessary for migration, differentiation, axon guidance and maintenance of nociceptive neurons (2–4). Furthermore, Prrxl1 appears to be involved in the differentiation of 2/3 of glutamatergic superficial dorsal horn neurons (5).\n\nAIM\n\nTo unravel the transcriptional network downstream of Prrxl1 in the developing dorsal spinal cord.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe performed a genome-wide study combining chromatin immunoprecipitation assays followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) with microarray expression profiling in Prrxl1-/- and Prrxl1+/+ mouse embryos at E14.5. Next, a subset of Prrxl1 direct target genes are being validated through in situ hibridization and real time quantitative PCR.\n\nRESULTS\n\nBy integrating ChIP-Seq and microarray datasets, we generated a comprehensive list of 244 potential direct Prrxl1 transcriptional targets. Further gene ontology analysis showed that the most enriched functional categories are associated with late aspects of neuronal development, which is in which is in accordance with the developmental defects observed in Prrxl1−/− mice. A subset of 17 Prrxl1 direct target genes, which attribute to Prrxl1 a novel function in the segregation of excitatory dorsal horn neuron subsets, are being experimentally validated through gene expression studies in Prrxl1−/− embryos.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTaken together, these results suggest that Prrxl1 controls the generation of diverse subtypes of dorsal horn excitatory neurons.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

For each patient we obtained their head CT and transformed image to obtain exact contour of ICH. We extracted circular area around contour, with circle centre in its centroid and perimeter equal to distance between two furthest point on contour. For such area, we calculated four moments of a distribution: standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variance (CoV, variance/mean), skewness (S, third moment) and kurtosis (K, fourth moment). Upon admission patients were assessed using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and upon discharge using Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). ICH expansion was defined as any increase in ICH volume on control CT. Poor outcome was defined as GOS < 3.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 34 (56.67%) patients had poor treatment outcome and 15 (25%) had ICH expansion. Patients with poor outcome had lower GCS upon admission (4.97 ± 3.24 vs. 10.84 ± 4.52; p < 0.01) and were older (69.18 ± 12.56 vs. 55.58 ± 17.91; p < 0.01). They also had higher SD (32.18 ± 9.70 vs. 27 ± 9.04; p = 0.039), CoV (8.43 ± 4.62 vs. 5.36 ± 3.16; p < 0.01) and S (0.16 ± 0.84 vs.\n\n−0.25 ± 0.67; p = 0.045). Patients with ICH expansion had higher SD (34.87 ± 11.37 vs. 28.29 ± 8.59; p = 0.021) and CoV (9.6 ± 5.6 vs. 6.27 ± 3.46; p < 0.01) and lower K (−0.61 ± 0.72 vs. −0.07 ± 0.86; p = 0.034). In multivariate logistic regression analysis higher CoV (OR: 1.711; 95% CI: 1.113–3.289; p = 0.048) and age (OR: 1.103; 95% CI:1.024–1.229; p = 0.03) and lower GCS (OR: 0.691; 95% CI: 0.513–0.852; p < 0.01) remained associated with higher risk of poor treatment outcome. Lower K (OR: 0.382; 95% CI: 0.132–0.879; p = 0.042) was associated with higher risk of ICH expansion.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nComputational analysis of perihemorrhagic density can be useful in determining outcome and risk of ICH expansion.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nTutors of study: Kornelia Kliś MD, PhD, Roger Krzyżewski MD, Borys Kwinta MD, PhD\n\nDoes embolization of cerebral aneurysms influence arterial tortuosity? – Single center retrospective analysis\n\nMałgorzata Ewa Czuba1\n\n1 - Students’ Scientific Group at Department of Neurosurgery and Neurotraumatology, Jagiellonian University Medical College\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nArterial tortuosity is a phenomenon that affects hemodynamics of blood flow. It is influenced by patients age, atherosclerosis, collagen defects and deficiencies. Impact of surgical procedures of aneurysms on arterial tortuosity is still unknown.\n\nAIM\n\nWe decided to determine, whether tortuosity of internal carotid artery (ICA) is affected by performing coiling of cerebral aneurysm.\n\nMETHODS\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed 52 patients with single intracranial aneurysm, treated with endovascular procedure. Based on their Digital Subtraction Angiography images, obtained prior to the procedure and after first follow-up examination (avg. 15 months), we analyzed tortuosity of ICA, both on the side of embolization and on the other side. Following tortuosity descriptors were calculated: relative length (RL), sum of angle metrics (SOAM), triangular index (TI), product of angle distance (PAD), and inflection count metric (ICM). To represent changes in tortuosity, for each descriptor we defined Δ as value of the descriptor on follow-up examination minus value of the descriptor before procedure.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn the follow up the tortuosity of ICA changed on both coiled and not coiled side. Mean ΔRL was smaller on coiled side (-0.02 ± 0.03 vs -0.01 ± 0.03; p = 0.002) in comparison to the other side. ΔPAD (1.06 ± 0.98 vs 0.54 ± 0.92; p = 0.007) and ΔICM (2.41 ± 2.18 vs 1.1 ± 1.85; p = 0.001) were bigger on the embolized side. Furthermore, male patients had higher ΔTI (- 0.04 ± 0.12 vs 0 ± 0.07; p = 0.018) of both ICA. Additionally, patients taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) had smaller ΔSOAM (−0.12 ± 0.17 vs 0.58 ± 0.59; p = 0.011) and ΔPAD (0.12 ± 0.25 vs 1.16 ± 0.98; p = 0.023). We also observed that there is a negative correlation between age and ΔTI (R = −0.23; p = 0.018). Logistic regression analysis showed that embolization independently influenced the increase of ΔICM (OR 1.29, 95%CI: 1.04–1.65; p = 0.027) and reduction of ΔRL (OR 0.18, 95%CI: 0.03–0.92; p = 0.046).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nCoiling procedures performed on cerebral aneurysms as well as patients’ age, sex and ACEI intake may influence the tortuosity of ICA.\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nTutors of study: Roger Krzyżewski MD, Kornelia Kliś MD, PhD, Borys Kwinta MD, PhD\n\nSpinal cord injury induces time-dependent changes in the urethra.-induced histological and innervation changes in the urethra.
