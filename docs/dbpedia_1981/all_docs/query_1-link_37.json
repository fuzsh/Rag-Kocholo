In the fall, she taught “Modernism in the time of Decolonization,” with Rebecca Johnson, which gave rise to a Myers conference in January, “Forms of Liberation.” She is growing ever more excited for [Huguette Caland: Shape and Form in Four Languages] (working title) at the Reina Sofia in the fall of 2024, and working hard to that end. Work for books about Algerian abstract painting in the 1960s and about Walid Raad advanced as did a co-edited volume (with Rachel Haidu) about art writing, currently titled [Things we are not yet writing]. She was thrilled to see the special issue of Regards about mysticism and faith in Southwest Asia that she co-edited (with Kirsten Scheid) published, and even happier to have been able to include writing by Hamed Yousefi and Ruslana Lichtizer in the dossier. Articles appeared about temporality, love, and grammar in contemporary art, an interview with Hito Steyerl (in an exciting volume co-edited by Antawan Byrd!), and a text about Ahlam Shibli will be published by October in summer. Feldman shared her research at the Core Program, Harvard, UPenn, L’ École nationale supérieure de la photographie, Arles, The Block, and at AUB. She is proud of her former PhD mentees, Thomas Love (2023) and Azadeh Safaieian (2023), both of whom defended brilliant dissertations and took positions at the University of Missouri and the University of Illinois at Chicago, respectively.\n\nPeter Fenves (German)\n\nOver the course of the last several years, two of Professor Fenves’ books (Late Kant and The Messianic Reduction) were translated into Spanish and will appear this coming fall; one of the translators, Mauricio Oportus Preller, is an advanced graduate student in our CLS program, while another, Rudy Pradenas, was a visiting scholar at Northwestern and is currently finishing his doctoral degree at the University of Michigan. One of Professor Fenves’ essays, “Democracias, según Benjamin y Derrida,” recently appeared in a volume titled Jacques Derrida (Buenos Aires and Madrid). Another of his essays, “Benjamin, Studying, China,” translated by Li Sha, who was also a visiting scholar at Northwestern, recently appeared in an issue of the Guangzhou University Journal. Professor Fenves’ follow-up reflections on Benjamin’s relation to Chinese thought, “Detour and Dao: Benjamin, with Jullien, contra the Ontology of the Event,” was published this spring in Theory, Culture& Society.\n\nMarianne Hopman (Classics)\n\nAfter stepping down from her role as department chair in August 2022, Marianne Hopman spent the 2022-23 academic year working on her ongoing monograph on the fifth-century BCE tragedy, [Prometheus Bound], as well as related projects. She wrote chapters on violence, embodiment, and politics in the play; gave a talk (in French) on “Prometheus as spectacle” at the University of Montreal; and workshopped a chapter entitled “Emplotting Cosmography” forthcoming in a volume on [Cosmographies of Greece, Rome, and the Classical Tradition], edited by R. Gagné and A. Kachuck. In her capacity as director of the Graduate Classics Cluster, she organized a series of well-attended events and lectures, culminating with an outing to see [Gospel at Colonus] at the Court Theatre in June 2023.\n\nJörg Kreienbrock (German)\n\nProfessor Jörg Kreienbrock was on leave during the 2022-23 academic year. He spent his time abroad as a Visiting Scholar at the Erich Auerbach Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Cologne, the Institute of Media Studies at the University of Bochum, and at La Sapienza University, Rome doing research on a new book project investigating representations of poverty in literature, art, and philosophy. While abroad he gave talks and held workshops at several German universities and published articles on the idea of repair work in Alexander Kluge, the relation of poetry to philosophical conceptualizations of property, and the precarious status of opening sentences in novelistic writing.\n\nNeil Verma (RTVF)\n\nAssistant Professor Neil Verma served as conference director and chair of the third Radio Preservation Task Force meeting at the Library of Congress and Smithsonian in Washington DC in April. The largest event of its kind, the four day conference had 80 panels and workshops and more than 350 speakers and panelists. In attendance were keynote speakers The Kitchen Sisters, Jad Abumrad of Radiolab, archivist Rick Prelinger and the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden. The conference brought together academics, broadcasters, government agencies, archivists and others to explore ways to preserve radio and podcasting recordings for posterity, and to launch new projects, including the Black Women in Radio historic initiative.\n\nSam Weber (German)\n\nProfessor Sam Weber, who is currently into the second year of a four-year “phased retirement” program with a reduced teaching schedule, followed up his spring 2022 undergraduate seminar on “Kafka’s Uncanny Animals” with a spring 2023 course, attended by both undergraduates and graduate students, on “The Uncanny in Theory and Literature” — the theory being that of Sigmund Freud and Martin Heidegger, and the literature being that of the German Romantic author, E. T. A. Hoffmann, whose story, “The Sandmann” exemplifies the Uncanny for Freud; whereas Heidegger chooses the Greek tragedy, Sophocles’ Antigone, as his exemplary uncanny text. Otherwise, Professor Weber published a book-length, Preexisting Conditions— Recounting the Plague (Zone Books)which examines how plagues have been narrated in literary, dramatic, and other forms. He also gave a series of lectures for Shanghai University on “Literature as Compassion.”\n\nJennifer Weintritt (Classics)\n\nThe highlight of Jennifer Weintritt’s teaching this year was reading the entire [Aeneid] not once, but twice with her advanced Latin class and first year seminar. The poem also made a brief appearance in her third course, \"Women of the Trojan War: Ancient and Modern Adaptations.\" The fun with the [Aeneid] carried right on through to the end of the spring quarter, with a visit from Professor Erika Valdivieso (Yale) to speak on Vergil’s reception in South America. Reading the same text with different students and emphases all year long while working on her book project was delightful.\n\nAs for research, Jennifer held a successful manuscript workshop with senior colleagues from UPenn, UChicago, and Urbana-Champaign in November. She also presented her work, freshly updated from the workshop, at the Society for Classical Studies in New Orleans. Her article “More Useful and More Trustworthy: The Reception of the Greek Epic Cycle in Scholia to Homer, Pindar and Euripides” is set to appear in the American Journal of Philology in summer 2023."
