        "text": "Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world, and it’s common for Brazilians to refer to it as a continent unto itself. While Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are its most famous postcard attractions, Brazilian culture extends far beyond the beaches of Copacabana and the hustle and bustle of Avenida Paulista.\n\nA deep dive into the myriad cultures that Brazil has to offer is impossible to do in one trip, but fortunately there is a wealth of Brazilian literature that offers a deep insight into its 26 states — not including the Federal District.\n\nAs a result of regional uniqueness, different literary styles, and even different time periods, writers from all over Brazil have produced a rich collection of literary works. Some of these writers, such as Jorge Amado from Bahia and Machado de Assis from Rio de Janeiro, have transcended the boundaries of their states and time, becoming timeless references for Brazilian literature at home and abroad.\n\nHere is a list of the most important authors and reference works to help you expand your knowledge of Brazil:\n\nAcre: Galvez, O Imperador do Acre (Galvez, The Emperor of Acre)\n\nThis historical fiction is based on the true story of the Spanish adventurer Luis Gálvez Rodríguez de Arias, who founded the Republic of Acre in 1900 in the latex-rich middle of the Amazon jungle. Eventually, after many conflicts with rubber tappers and Brazilian authorities, Acre was annexed by Bolivia and became a Brazilian state.\n\nAlagoas: Vidas Secas (Barren Lives)\n\nOne of the most important works of 20th century Brazilian modernism, this text is said to reflect the harsh life of Brazilians in the desert areas of the Northeast. Graciliano Ramos, its acclaimed author, lived and worked in Alagoas, so one could say that the saga of a miserable working-class family trying to escape poverty and severe drought was heavily inspired by life in this Brazilian state.\n\nAmapá: A Casa Amarela (The Yellow House)\n\nThis novel is set during Brazil’s military dictatorship, which began in 1964. It focuses on how the coup affected the city of Macapá, especially the Picanço Cardoso family, whose son is tortured and killed by the regime.\n\nAmazonas: Dois Irmãos (Two Brothers: A Novel)\n\nThe story of a bitter dispute between the twins Yaqub and Omar illustrates the golden age and eventual decline of Manaus, once known as the “Paris of the Amazon.” Narrated by the fictional housekeeper’s illegitimate son, Dois Irmãos is a profound critique of the customs of Brazilian society at the time. It also pays homage to Brazil’s rich history of Lebanese immigration. In 2017, the novel was adapted into a miniseries by Rede Globo, Brazil’s largest television network.\n\nBahia: Gabriela, Cravo e Canela (Gabriela, Clove and Cinnamon)\n\nOne of the most famous works by world-renowned author Jorge Amado, this book has inspired two soap operas and holds a special place in the hearts of many Brazilians. With a great deal of sarcasm, humor, and skillful writing, Amado tells the story of Gabriela, a poor and innocent but beautiful woman who flees the drought of Brazil’s interior to Ilhéus..."
