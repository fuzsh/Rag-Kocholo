        "text": "Georgia Hunter Hello Thomas!\n\nI had the honor of meeting Eliska in my research, before she passed. What an incredible woman she was. I wrote a blog post about my time with her:\n\nhttps://georgiahunterauthor.com/on-va...\n\nI've been in close touch since with her grand-daughter, Emma, who's been a wonderful resource. Feel free to contact me via email if you'd like to connect me with your father!\n\ngeorgia@georgiahunterauthor.com\n\nWarmly,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Donna,\n\nThanks for your message, and I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve enjoyed ‚ÄúWe Were the Lucky Ones‚Äù in both book and television form!\n\nIn the 1950s, several years after the families were settled in Brazil and the United States, Sol and Nechuma (born in the 1880s) and Genek and Jakob died of natural causes.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Bailee,\n\nI‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre inspired to write about your family history! I know it will be rewarding.\n\nI was 15 when I first learned, thanks to a high-school research assignment, that I came from a family of Holocaust survivors. I started researching and writing in earnest in my 20‚Äôs. Once I got the blessings of all my living relatives, I was happy to share the story with the world.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in your own writing project!\n\nWarmly,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Hello Genevieve, yes Kurc is my family's real surname. My grandfather Americanized his name to Courts when he moved to the States but his siblings and their descendants still go by Kurc. Sounds like have some parallels in our family histories. Thank you for sharing!\n\nGeorgia Hunter Hi Sarah, thank you for the kind words üôèüèº I love knowing how moved you were by my family‚Äôs story - it was a true labor of love to research and record ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks for the read and again for taking the time to write! Warmly, Georgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Susan,\n\nApologies for the long delay in responding to your question! As far as I know, Jakob and Genek's deaths (of heart and lung disease, respectively) were not directly related to their wartime experiences.\n\nI'm so glad you enjoyed the book - I loved coming to understand my roots though the decade-long journey of unearthing and recording my family's story!\n\nWarmly,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Thanks, Maribeth!\n\nI appreciate the kind words. It was a true labor of love to research and record my family's story. I, too, was inspired by the love that they shared, and the persistent hope that one day they'd reunite.\n\nMy next book is due out next year! I'm working on it now...stay tuned :)\n\nWarmly,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Raul,\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed We Were the Lucky Ones! I am currently at work on another historical fiction book, also taking place during World War II but this time set in Italy. I'm hoping it will be ready to publish in 2022. If you'd like, you can sign up for my blog to receive the latest news on my various projects (via georgiahunterauthor.com).\n\nWarmly,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Jerri,\n\nI'm so glad you liked my book! I'm currently hard at work on the next one, which will come out next year. If you'd like, you can sign up for my blog to receive the latest news on my various projects (via my site, georgiahunterauthor.com).\n\nThanks for writing!\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Maria,\n\nThanks for your thoughtful question. Genek's death was not directly related to his wartime experiences, although we can't know for sure whether the conditions and lack of medical attention during those years had an indirect effect on his health. And in general, the family was so focused on building their new lives after the war that impact from their wartime experiences was not evident. They certainly had painful memories, but somehow managed to maintain positive attitudes for their fresh starts far away from the battlegrounds and killing fields.\n\nIn case you haven't seen it, there's a little more background about the family members, as well as my research, on my website (georgiahunterauthor.com), which you can search by name, if you are interested!\n\nWarmly,\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Christine,\n\nThanks for your note, and I hope your book club enjoys discussing \"We Were the Lucky Ones!\" In case you haven't already come across it, there's a discussion guide on my website that you might find useful.\n\nThe working title for my next book is \"One Good Thing\" - but that could change. (I had a few names for my first book before settling on \"We Were the Lucky Ones.\") Publication is expected sometime in 2022. Dates are a little variable these days, in light of the effects on every aspect of the industry by the pandemic. But I'm hard at work on the manuscript!\n\nThanks again for writing, and stay well!\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia Hunter Dear Missy,\n\nThanks for your question. The main reason my grandfather left Brazil was that he married an American - my grandmother - and they wanted to raise a family in America. Also, he had always dreamt of a life in the United States, which he viewed as a land of rich cultures and opportunities. And his brother Jacob had already emigrated to the Chicago area.\n\nMy grandfather kept in close touch with the family that remained in Brazil through frequent visits and by inviting several of the nieces and nephews to stay with his family in Massachusetts as they were growing up. Those experiences help to cement lifelong bonds across generations.\n\nWith warm regards,\n\nGeorgia"
