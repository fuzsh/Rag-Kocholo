        "text": "Friends,\n\nKiraly Salomon, Salomon I, King of Hungary, per ES married Judith/Sophie v.\n\nSchwaben, daughter of Kaiser Heinrich III and had two daughters before he\n\ndied. Judith Sophie married (2) Wladyslaw I, Wladyslaw Herman Polski. The\n\nsecond daughter of Salomon by Sophie was reportedly the Sophie v. Ungarn who\n\nmarried Poppo v. Berg Schelklingen (again from ES). Given the need for\n\npolitically advantageous marriages, the step-daughter of Wladyslaw married\n\nto Poppo is somewhat puzzling. Who was he? What family or other ties gave\n\nPoppo station to marry this princess? Does anyone have his pedigree?\n\nAny and all help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
