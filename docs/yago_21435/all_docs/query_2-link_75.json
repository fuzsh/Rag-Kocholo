        "text": "1. THE FOUNDATION AND NATURE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE POLANIE-PATRIKIOS\n\nClearly the inauguration of the Royal House Polanie-Patrikios was an example of the exercise of the ecclesiastical fons honorum – as the patent says, “by the ecclesiastical authority vested in us” indeed. The Royal House is unusual but not entirely unprecedented in that it has never reigned. It was part of an exiled Belarusian community that was centred upon the Church, and indeed that regarded the Church as the only extant remnant of Belarusian national consciousness.\n\nThere have been other situations whereby sovereignty has been proclaimed and intended but not effected in terms of control over land. The most obvious reason for this is that the monarch is actually not sovereign over land, but of a nation composed of people. Sometimes this is stated explicitly, for example, the King of the Belgians is not king of Belgium, but of the Belgian people, wherever they may be located, and a similar situation applies to the King of the Hellenes. In this and other cases the nation is not defined by territorial boundaries, and the monarch is an ethnarch. This is the more significant when the territory of a nation is under occupation by a hostile power. Governments-in-exile are a key example of the continuation of some sovereign rights without control of territory.\n\nThe division of the Belarusian exile community in the USA between republicans and monarchists does not deny the effectiveness or significance of the latter. Both were effectively successors to the Byelorussian Democratic Republic in Exile (Rada BNR) of 1918, which had been proclaimed as the rightful ruler of Belarus but which had never established effective control and had been suppressed by Germany. However brief and abortive, these months in 1918 were highly symbolic and important as they marked the rebirth of the Belarusian nation. Both divisions exist today; but while the Rada BNR in Toronto, Canada, is easily recognized by outsiders as a government-in-exile[i], the Belarusian monarchist movement, known for short as Royal Belarus, has been largely hidden to the wider community because of its unification with the Church which forms its visible structure. That wider community is also more open to the Rada BNR because it is a specifically pro-democracy movement, rather than Royal Belarus which is directed towards a traditionalist theocratic monarchism.\n\nThe position of Royal Belarus in exile is as previously stated by Philip Marshall Brown,“There is still deeper significance to this anomalous condition of sovereignty in exile. There is no automatic extinction of nations. Military occupation may seem final and permanent, and yet prove to be only an interregnum, though a prolonged nightmare for the inhabitants. A nation is much more than an outward form of territory and government. It consists of the men and women in whom sovereignty resides. So long as they cherish sovereignty in their hearts their nation is not dead.It may be prostrate and helpless and yet revive. It is not to be denied the symbols or forms of sovereignty on foreign soil or diplomatic relations with other nations.”[ii]\n\nThe Orthodox Church is not by nature well-suited to republics; as discussed previously, there is a strong concept within the Orthodoxy of the Rus of sacred monarchy and of the role of the Church as the decisive power in the coronation of the monarch. It was inevitable that when a sector of Belarusian nationalism became centred upon the Church during the 1950s, that it would also turn towards monarchy. It was equally inevitable that the candidate for the throne would not be a representative of the House of Romanov, which was after all an occupying power, but instead someone who recalled a much earlier Belarusian royal ancestry.\n\nThe exile circumstances meant that uniting the Church and monarchy was not only a historically and culturally astute step, but one that would allow for a more secure embodiment of the nation than a purely secular prince would have done. The Church had shown itself through the exile period to be able to continue to embody the national consciousness. Even if small and impoverished, it could continue to do so wherever it was to be based in the future. The idea of creating an ethnarchy in exile would be entirely in keeping with these principles.\n\nIn the view of the exiled Belarusians, there was no legitimacy in an argument that “might makes right” and that their nation was simply to be subsumed into either the Soviet Union or Germany. As such, there are some parallels with ethnic groups seeking self-determination within occupied territory, such as the Kurds, Chechnyans, Basques and so on.\n\nCox, as we have already seen, refers to this in saying, “As the concept of state sovereignty declines in relevance, so notions of racial sovereignty have grown. The idea that a given population group is, or ought to be, sovereign within a larger country is not confined to New Zealand.”\n\nWe might also recall other ethnic examples of a monarchy being created as part of a self-determination movement, such as that of Araucania and Patagonia (whose king Achille I was among the patrons of the Order of the Crown of Thorns). The status of various African and Native American ethnarchs would also be relevant.\n\n2. THE GENEALOGY AND ROYAL DESCENT OF THE ROYAL HOUSE POLANIE-PATRIKIOS\n\nThe ancestry of Prince Kermit of Miensk is important. He was among the heirs-general of most of the European Royal Houses, and theoretically was therefore in remainder to the British throne (as sixteenth cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II).\n\nMore significantly, however, he was the descendant of two royal lineages that accorded him particular dynastic rights. The first of these was the descent from the Byzantine Emperor Leo V Patrikios and several other Byzantine Emperors. This is as follows:\n\nLeo V Patrikios[iii] “the Armenian” (775-820), Byzantine Emperor m. Theodosia\n\nAnna (d.820)[iv] Hmayeak Maiactes Mamikonian (d.797), Prince of the Mamikonids\n\nKonstantinos (785-c.828/40) m.

Mary Pugh (1762-1849) (see the previous table)\n\nThrough this line, descent is traced from the legendary first Kings of Poland and Princes of Gniezno – from whom the “Polanie” element in the Royal House Polanie-Patrikios derives:\n\nPiast the Wheelwright (740/1-861) m. Rzepicha\n\nSiemowit\n\nLeszek (c.870-80-), Duke of the Polans\n\nSiemomysl (d.c.950-60), Duke of the Polans\n\nMieszko I (c.940-92), Ruler of the Polans and Prince of Gniezno m. Doubravka of Bohemia\n\nBoleslaw I “the Brave” (967-1025), King of Poland m. Emnilda\n\nMieszko II Lambert (c.990-1034), King of Poland m. Richeza of Lotharingia\n\nCasimir I “the Restorer” (1016-58), Duke of Poland m. Maria Dobroniega, daughter of St Vladimir, Prince of Kiev and Prince of Polotsk\n\nWladyslaw I Herman (c.1044-1102), Duke of Poland m. Judith of Bohemia\n\nBoleslaw III “Wrymouth” (1086-1138), Prince of Poland m. Zbyslava, daughter of Sviatopolk II, Grand Prince of Kiev and Prince of Polotsk\n\nWladyslaw II “the Exile” (1105-59), High Duke of Poland and Duke of Silesia m. Agnes of Babenberg\n\nRicheza of Poland (c.1140-85) m. Alfonzo VII, Emperor of All Spain\n\nSancha of Castile (1154/5-1208) m.

Beatrice of Savoy\n\nEleanor of Provence (c.1223-91) m. Henry III, King of England (1207-72)\n\nEdward I, King of England (1239-1307) (see previous table)\n\nIt can be seen that all royal descents for the Royal House Polanie-Patrikios are through the female line, and moreover no claim is made that the head of the Royal House is the senior heir-general of any royal ancestor. Some claims rest upon illegitimate descent. Lastly, the current Head was adopted for the purpose of heirship rather than being the biological son of his predecessor.\n\nThe basis on which the Royal House can claim to be the dynastic representative of its royal predecessors is therefore restricted to those predecessors where headship could devolve both in the female unrestricted line and to illegitimate and adoptive kin.\n\nNOTES:\n\n[i] As of 2020, its head is Ivonka Survilla. It claims the title of the oldest extant government-in-exile, although since Royal Belarus developed from a common root, it would have an equal claim to that distinction. It should be noted that the Rada BNR awards a number of Orders and medals, including the Order of the Pahonia, the Order of the Iron Knight, and the Partisan Medal.\n\n[ii] Philip Marshall Brown, Sovereignty in Exile in American Journal of International Law, no. 35, 1941, pp. 666-668.\n\n[iii] Information on the Byzantine Emperors is taken from The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 1991.
