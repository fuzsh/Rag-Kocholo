        "text": "The article shows that images of the “other” in the “Annales” are far more than just representations of the chronicler’s opinions. Długosz combines various episodes to convey a message to his readers. The tales about Germans and Jews do not aim at understanding the “other”, but at explaining important issues of the “own”. “Strangers” matter to the chronicler only in so far, as they are relevant for the message to his audience, therefore his phenomenology of strangers is not absolute (valid/important in itself), but responsive.\n\nThe birth of a male heir to Jogaila in autumn 1424 saved the new dynasty from the unfortunate fate of the Angevin line in Poland. To celebrate this blessing, a curse for Poland’s enemies to the west, the king invited the pope (as per tradition, judging from the case of his first daughter, Bonifacja) and emperor to stand as godfather to the baby prince and compater to himself along with other important diplomatic partners such as the grand master of Prussia, the doge of Venice, the duke of Milan and leading cardinals of the Roman Church active in eastern and central European diplomacy. These men were represented at the ceremony by proxies selected from among the archbishops and bishops of Poland-Lithuania. Leading Malopolskan monastic lords (the three ‘crowning abbots’) and Cracovian clerics also took part in the ceremonies.\n\nThe article discusses whether there was a specific ‘female affinity’ towards Mendicants among Polish princesses between the 14th and 16th century. It suggests a threefold approach by examining 1) personal encounters, 2) interactions and 3) forms of agency. Case studies presented in this article are: Jadwiga of Anjou (1373-1399), Queen of Poland; Elizabeth of Habsburg (1437-1505), Queen of Poland and Anna Fiodorówna (1476-1522), duchess of Mazovia.\n\nThe article concerns the attitude of Wladyslaw Jagiello and Polish intellectual elites to Jerome of Prague, and his teaching. The main element of the author's analysis is a visit of the Bohemian reformer to the kingdom of Wla-dyslaw Jagiello in 1413, as well as the activities of the Polish delegates at the Council of Constance in the process of Jerome which led to his death at the stake.\n\nThe present guide grew out of a first draft prepared for a Summer Institute held at CEU in cooperation with CARA in 2000. We decided to enlarge and revise it for the session at the 40th Medieval Congress in Kalamazoo, with the help of friends and graduates of the Medieval Studies Department at Central European University (Budapest) and the support of the Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Toronto. None the less, it is still a draft, but we felt that half a loaf is more than none. The printed version is an abbreviated one; a more complete guide, with a list of major source-publications of the region will be available on CD-ROM as well as on the homepages of Medieval Studies, CEU and of the Centre of Medieval Studies in Toronto. The final editing and formatting of both the printed and electronic version was done by Zsolt Hunyadi, whom we all owe many thanks."
