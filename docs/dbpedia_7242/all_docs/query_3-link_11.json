        "text": "naval officer. Pinkerton�s tour of duty ends in a few years and he returns to America. Cho-Cho-San, who is pregnant, continues to love and languish for him. When he eventually returns - with his American wife, Kate � he has lost interest in Cho-Cho-San. Kate wishes to adopt the boy, who is named Trouble. Cho-Cho-San gives up her son and then commits suicide.\n\nThe 1904 version of the opera Teatro alla Scala was less than a success and Puccini altered the opera. Revised by 1906, the work has become one of the most frequently performed works in the international operatic repertory.\n\nJohn Luther Long (1861-1927), a Hanover native, became a Philadelphia lawyer. He never visited Japan but the idea for the short story came his sister Jennie Correll, a Lutheran missionary who'd been to Japan a year earlier.\n\nLong�s Madame Butterfly was first published in Century Magazine and then republished in book form. David Belasco, an American playwright, adapted Long's story into a play that was performed in London. In Belasco�s Madame Butterfly, unlike Long's, Cho-Cho-San commits suicide when Pinkerton discards her. It was Belasco's London version of the story that Puccini used as the basis of his opera."
