        "text": "Overview\n\nMadam Butterfly is the English adaptation of the tragic Italian opera Madama Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini. It opened in Milan in 1904, and the orchestral score was first published in 1906 by Giulio Ricordi. Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa wrote the libretto (text of the opera). Puccini based his opera on the play by David Belasco and story by John Luther Long, as well as the novel Madame Chrysanthème by Pierre Loti. These sources, and Puccini’s work, were part of the Japonisme artistic movement of 19th-century Western Europe.\n\nThe original version of the opera was poorly received, but Puccini’s work has seen many adaptations since its debut. Notable adaptations include several English and Japanese direct adaptations of the opera to film, including Fritz Lang’s Harakiri and Marion Gerling’s Madame Butterfly in the early 20th century. Other adaptations take the same basic story but change the location from Japan to a different colonial space, such as Vietnam in the West End musical adaptation Miss Saigon, or Colonial China in David Henry Hwang’s Broadway musical M. Butterfly.\n\nThis guide cites the 1984 edition of English National Opera Guide 26, edited by Nicholas John, based on the translation by R. H. Elkin. This edition includes both the 1904 and 1906 versions of the opera in English and in Italian. Madam Butterfly includes the themes of Infidelity in Love and Faith, The Power of Love and Fate, and Cultural Conflict and Exotification.\n\nContent Warning: The source material contains marriage of a minor to an adult and self-harm. Additionally, there are some outdated, offensive attitudes toward and descriptions of Japanese people (Orientalism) in the source material.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nMadam Butterfly takes place in and around the Nagasaki house purchased by US Navy Lieutenant Pinkerton in 1904. Goro, a marriage broker, shows Pinkerton around the house, which contains sliding screens, and briefly introduces Pinkerton to three servants, including Suzuki, his fiancée’s servant. As Goro and Pinkerton discuss his fiancée, Butterfly, the US Consul, Sharpless, arrives.\n\nPinkerton tells Sharpless that he plans to marry not only Butterfly, but also other women in other countries. Sharpless advises against this, arguing that Butterfly deserves a faithful husband. Pinkerton says he will eventually settle down with one woman—an American.\n\nButterfly and her friends arrive. She tells Sharpless that her family was once wealthy, but they lost their fortune and the women had to become geishas to survive. Butterfly also tells Sharpless that her father is dead and whispers her age—15—to him. The High Commissioner, Registrar, and Butterfly’s family arrive. Butterfly shows Pinkerton her possessions, including a dagger. Goro explains that Butterfly’s father used the dagger to die by suicide. Butterfly throws away her Ottoke (religious statues), saying she is converting to Pinkerton’s religion.\n\nThe couple is officially married. Sharpless, the Commissioner, and the Registrar leave. At the reception, as Pinkerton proposes a toast, Butterfly’s uncle, the Bonze, arrives. He reveals to all the guests that she converted to Pinkerton’s religion and curses her. Pinkerton tells the guests to leave, and Butterfly’s family members renounce her and storm off with the Bonze.\n\nWhen everyone has left, Butterfly kisses Pinkerton’s hand while Suzuki can be heard praying in another room. Butterfly has Suzuki put up a screen and help her get ready for bed. Pinkerton watches. After Suzuki leaves, Butterfly and Pinkerton discuss her love and his possessiveness. They talk about the stars and go to bed.\n\nThree years later, Suzuki and Butterfly discuss how Pinkerton has not returned, as he left shortly after their wedding. Butterfly believes he will come back, and Suzuki thinks he has abandoned them. Butterfly describes what his homecoming will be like. Goro and Sharpless arrive. Butterfly offers Sharpless a pipe and a cigarette while he tries to tell her about a letter from Pinkerton. Goro laughs at Butterfly when she admits that she believes Pinkerton will return.\n\nYamadori, Butterfly’s new suitor, arrives with flowers. Despite Goro encouraging Butterfly to seek divorce for abandonment and to marry the rich Prince Yamadori, she refuses. After Yamadori leaves, Sharpless tries to read Pinkerton’s letter to Butterfly, but she continually interrupts him. Then, he asks what she would do if Pinkerton didn’t return. She says she would work as a geisha or die by suicide. Sharpless encourages her to marry Yamadori. Butterfly tells Suzuki to show Sharpless out but relents and allows him to stay.\n\nThen, Butterfly introduces Sharpless to her and Pinkerton’s son. She asks Sharpless to tell Pinkerton about the child and declares that it would be better to die than work as a geisha again. Sharpless embraces the child, agrees to tell Pinkerton, and leaves. Suzuki finds Goro sneaking around outside. When he tells Butterfly that the child will be treated poorly in America, she threatens him with her dagger.\n\nAfter Goro leaves, Suzuki and Butterfly see Pinkerton’s ship in the harbor. Butterfly has Suzuki put all the flowers from the garden in the house. After they scatter the flowers all around, Butterfly has Suzuki help her with her hair and makeup. Butterfly changes into her wedding clothes. Suzuki, Butterfly, and the baby watch for Pinkerton’s arrival all night, but he does not come.\n\nIn the morning, while Butterfly is upstairs with the child, Pinkerton and Sharpless arrive. Pinkerton tells Suzuki to not tell Butterfly that he has arrived. Suzuki sees Pinkerton’s American wife, Kate, in the garden. Sharpless tells Suzuki that Pinkerton wants to take his son from Butterfly and have him raised by Kate. The flowers upset Pinkerton, and, after giving Sharpless some money for Butterfly, Pinkerton leaves.\n\nButterfly comes downstairs and becomes upset when she sees Sharpless and Kate. She learns that the woman is Pinkerton’s new wife and wants to take her son to America. Butterfly eventually agrees to give up her son but refuses to take Pinkerton’s money. After Sharpless and Kate leave, Suzuki does not want to leave Butterfly alone. Butterfly holds her son, tells him she is making a sacrifice for him, blindfolds him, and goes behind a screen."
