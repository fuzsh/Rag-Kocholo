        "text": "I don’t know what it is about ice skating, but there’s a big nostalgia factor for us adults who don’t get out on the ice much anymore.\n\nMaybe it was that story many of us read in school, “Hans Brinker; or, the Silver Skates: A Story of Life in Holland.” Speed skating along a frozen river for the prize of a beautiful pair of silver skates sounds so romantic.\n\nOr maybe you remember pickup hockey games as a kid in your neighborhood. The “Miracle on Ice,” when the U.S. won gold at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, certainly sparked the dreams of many a skater.\n\nIt was nothing fancy, but my high school friends and I still reminisce on Facebook about winter days spent skating at our local park that was flooded just so we could skate on it. We’d freeze our buns off and then warm up by a fire somebody built on the ice. Then we’d do it all the next day.\n\nGrowing up in suburban New Jersey, ice skating for us was like a trip to the country. A brook ran near my parents’ home, and when it froze, we could skate for several miles. If we got tired, branches that stretched out across the ice created nature’s perfect resting places. We relished in the adventure of discovering a whole other world along the way.\n\nSeeing what was in the yards that backed up to the brook as we glided along made us feel we were the first ones to come upon the scene. There was one yard that had a Japanese-style garden with a small footbridge that spanned the brook. The garden seemed so out of place to us, like we’d stepped through the looking glass. A few years ago, I learned that the 1915 silent movie “Madame Butterfly,” starring Mary Pickford, as well as other films, were filmed there. Now, that was exotic!\n\nWhere were our parents? Certainly not skating with me and my sister. In those days, kids were allowed out alone all day until suppertime.\n\nWe would often skate as far as the next town, where the brook ran behind the local Sears. To us kids, it seemed like miles and miles, but it was probably less than two or three. There were no cellphones then, and once in a while we would skate so far it was dark by the time we returned home.\n\nIn Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” — I love the film with Winona Ryder best — skating on thin ice is the cause of one of the story’s most dramatic moments. Our \"Green Brook” was also deep enough in places to be a little bit dangerous if you fell through the ice, so there was always that thrilling element.\n\nNot cold enough for pond skating\n\nOver the years, various flood prevention projects on the brook reduced its flow, and winters there no longer get as cold to freeze it. I’m sad for today’s kids; how much they miss.\n\nHere today in MetroWest and Greater Milford, outdoor skating is also weather- and snow-dependent. If we have a cold enough winter, folks scrape out an area on some local ponds to play hockey or take a turn. But there’s always a safety factor — our ponds are deep — so be sure to check with your local recreation or police department about ice thickness.\n\nA few families have backyard rinks and a few towns sometimes build outdoor rinks at a local park or the center of town. The results aren’t always the smoothest — again, the weather — and vandals sometimes take it upon themselves to ruin everyone else’s fun.\n\nIf you have higher aspirations for a hockey or figure skating career — and an extra $4.1 million — you might want to invest in this Sudbury home that comes with its own covered sports court that can be turned into an ice rink. The Zamboni, boards, glass and all can be purchased extra from the sellers, according to the real estate listing.\n\nIt isn't cold enough yet for outdoor skating here. Below, we've cobbled together a list of (mostly indoor) area rinks that have public skating, many with hours during school vacation week.
