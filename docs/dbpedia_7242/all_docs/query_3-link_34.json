        "text": "This article is a revised version of the script that was initially written for a group video assignment in partial fulfillment of the Music History course during the Jan-Apr 2020 semester.\n\nRevised by: Zoe Wong\n\nOriginal Contributors: Zoe Wong, Avery Chan, Ejane Tham, Kimmie Ch’ng\n\nGiacomo Puccini, in full Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini, was born in Lucca, Tuscany, Italy in 1858. He was known as one of the greatest exponents of operatic realism who virtually brought the history of Italian opera to an end. His early works were rooted in traditional late 19th century romantic Italian operas while his later works were successfully developed in verismo style. Having composed many well-celebrated works, including operas such as La Bohème (1896), Tosca (1900), Turandot (posthumously completed), and Madama Butterfly (1904), Puccini was also called ‘the greatest composer of Italian opera after Verdi.’\n\nAfter the successful premiere of his first opera, Pucinni’s second opera, Edgar (1889) was unfortunately a failure due to the incompetence of his librettist, Ferdinando Fontana. This led him to initially decide to write his own libretto for his next work but was convinced by Guilio Ricordi, not to do so. Thereafter, he had difficult relationships with his librettists because of his frequent revisions of his libretti in terms of both structure and text. Only two out of the four librettists, Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, remained working with Puccini. Giacosa, a dramatist, was responsible for the stories while Illica, a poet, worked primarily on the words themselves. This led to a collaboration between the two men on the texts of La Bohème (1896), Tosca (1900), and Madama Butterfly (1904).\n\nMadama Butterfly was written based on the short story Madame Butterfly (1898) by John Luther Long, which in turn was based on stories told to Long by his sister Jennie Correll and on the semi-autobiographical 1887 French novel Madame Chrysanthème by Pierre Loti. While in London in 1900, Puccini attended a performance of American theatrical producer and playwright David Belasco’s one-act play Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan, which recounted the ill-fated love story from Long’s version. Although he knew no English, Puccini responded to the play’s poignancy and asked his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, to obtain the story’s operatic rights. Illica even travelled to Nagasaki to investigate local colour, while Puccini set about researching Japanese music. He visited with the wife of the Japanese ambassador to Italy, who sang Japanese folk songs to him and acquired for him sheet music for further study. The music for the opera basically reflects on what Puccini had learnt and even makes a few direct references to the Japanese songs he had been exposed to during that period.\n\nPlot\n\nAct I of the opera unfolds the story of a heartbreaking unrequited love as Pinkerton, a U.S. naval officer, arranges a marriage of convenience during his stay in Japan. With the help of Goro, a marriage broker, Pinkerton acquires a young Japanese bride named Butterfly (Cio-Cio-san) and holds the wedding at his newly rented house that overlooks the vibrant Nagasaki harbour. Sharpless, the American Consul, pleads him to be kind to Butterfly upon seeing her apparent affection towards him. However, Pinkerton dismisses Sharpless nonchalantly, saying that he will eventually marry his true American bride and abandon Butterfly when he returns home. Blinded by love, the excited Butterfly renounces her ancient religion and secretly converts to Christianity to marry an American. Consequently, Butterfly’s enraged uncle interrupts the wedding and accuses her of committing an abomination. Words of congratulations from guests immediately turned to foul imprecations, causing the young bride to burst into tears. When the couple is finally alone, Pinkerton comforts Butterfly. The act is concluded with a passionate love duet as they prepare to spend their first night together.\n\nIn Act II, three years has passed since Pinkerton’s departure shortly after the wedding. Faithfully, Butterfly remains adamant that her husband will return from America despite Suzuki’s efforts in trying to convince her otherwise. Meanwhile, Goro besieges Butterfly with countless marriage offers from other men as soon as Pinkerton left, including one from the rich Prince Yamadori. In spite of the financial difficulties faced, Butterfly firmly rejects all the offers and remains loyal to her husband. Sharpless arrives to deliver the news of Pinkerton’s return to Japan. With Butterfly’s continuous joyful interruptions, Sharpless could not bring himself to finish reading the letter’s contents. She also reveals that she had given birth to Pinkerton’s son. Pinkerton has no knowledge about the child as he departed before her pregnancy was evident. The blond, blue-eyed, curly-haired little boy was named Sorrow at birth, and as soon as Pinkerton arrives, he shall be called Joy. From the hill house, Butterfly and Suzuki sees Pinkerton’s ship arriving at the harbour. Alas, her love is vindicated. Patiently, Butterfly stays up all night waiting for him to arrive.\n\nAs the scene transitions into Act III, Butterfly remains vigil till dawn the next day. Suzuki answers a knock at the door, and to her astonishment, she sees Pinkerton and Sharpless. She rushes off to tell Butterfly of the long-awaited good news but is stopped by them. After a moment of confusion, she finally understands why when she spots a strange woman standing in the garden. To her devastation, she learns that this woman, Kate, is Pinkerton’s new American wife. Sharpless pleads Suzuki to persuade Butterfly to give up her child to Kate. Filled with remorse, Pinkerton is unable to face Butterfly, and rushes out as they deliver the news to her. Suppressing her anguish and heartbreak, Butterfly agrees to give up her son on the condition that Pinkerton comes for the child himself. Overwhelmed with grief and disappointment, Butterfly blindfolds Sorrow and gives him a mini American flag to greet his father just before stabbing herself with her father’s sepukku knife with the inscription: “Die with honour, when it is impossible to live with honour.” By the time Pinkerton rushes into the house, Butterfly is already dead.\n\nReception\n\nThe original two-act version of the Madama Butterfly was premiered on 17 February 1904 at La Scala, Milan. It was poorly received, partly due to Puccini’s late completion of the opera, which gave inadequate time for rehearsals. Puccini revised it, splitting the overly long second act into two, in which he added the Humming Chorus as a bridge to what became Act III, and making other changes. With this version, success ensued, starting with the first performance on 28 May 1904 in Brescia. The opera was revised another three times, the last version being today’s standard version but the original version is still occasionally performed.\n\nPuccini’s sensitivity to the theatrical, extraordinary ability to build immediately accessible and recognizable melodies and remarkable gift for creating just the right aural atmosphere to emphasize every dramatic situation and intensify the emotional expressions of the text allowed him to create a brilliant approach to orchestration. Exquisite tone-painting is also frequently used in this opera to reflect on the meaning of the text, as the locale and text offer the composer so many opportunities to do so in this verismo style opera by intertwining two exotic cultures for the Italians through intricate linguistic and musical fusion.\n\nVerismo Style\n\nMadama Butterfly is an exemplary work in the repertoire of verismo operas by Puccini. The verismo style is an operatic composition style based on the slightly earlier Italian literary verismo, which was itself influenced by French naturalism. Like naturalism, the verismo literary movement sought to portray the world with greater realism. In doing so, Italian verismo authors such as Giovanni Verga wrote about subject matters such as the lives of the poor, that was not generally seen as a subject fit for literature. In turn, the operatic verismo is marked by melodramatic, often violent plots with characters drawn from everyday life. Musical devices included passionate declamation by solo voices and emotionally charged harmonies and melodies with extended techniques such as blending singing with shouting, shrieks, sobs, and laughter. Unlike the bel canto style, verismo music is more through-composed rather than being organized into recitative and aria.\n\nSakoku\n\nKnown as Sakoku, Japan used to be a closed country, whereby relations and trade were severely limited. Nearly all foreign nationals and the Japanese were barred from entering and leaving the country. So, how did Puccini and his librettists manage to create such a groundbreaking opera by linking both cultures?\n\nIn 1853, American Commodore Matthew C. Perry threatened to bombard the Japanese capital if they did not open up to trade with the West. Thus, Japan opened up itself to foreign influence. A vast cultural and artistic exchange began between the two disparate regions of the world and Japanese goods flooded the European markets which made a profound impact on the arts of the Western world, which ultimately led many French artists to experiment with Impressionism. It is also due to this historical event, that Puccini and his librettists were able to research on the Japanese culture and their music through the natives, books, and on-site visits.\n\nMusical Style\n\nThe opera begins with a short orchestral prelude with a busy fugal opening theme, followed by a second theme of a more overtly Japanese character, leading straight into the opening scene.\n\nLieutenant Pinkerton, is identified with the Star-Spangled Banner motif, the Navy anthem then, which is heard as an introduction to Dovunque al mondo.\n\nAs for the dainty Butterfly, she is identified with two thematic ideas, both of which come into play during her entrance with the relatives. The first can be heard at the beginning of her entrance played by solo violin and viola, then by various other combinations of instruments as the motive goes up and up through various keys, creating a mysterious and haunting tune that reflects on her character whose love is her existence, fragile and elusive like her namesake the Butterfly, yet capable of tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of her loved ones.\n\nThe second idea is an immediate outgrowth of the earlier tune, on Butterfly’s line D‘amor venni alle soglie in Ah! Ah! Quanto cielo!…Ancora un passo or via of Act I. Puccini separates these two tunes and uses them interchangeably in identifying Butterfly at various points in the opera.\n\nIn the extremely pathetic song to the baby, a somber and striking theme is principally heard in unison, denoting the sacrifice which the mother will eventually make for the sake of her son’s future.\n\nWhat makes this opera special?\n\nIn a new era characterized by industrialization, rapid social change, emerging cultural trends, and advances in science and the social sciences, modernists felt a growing alienation incompatible with Victorian morality, optimism, and convention. New ideas in psychology, philosophy, and political theory kindled a search for new modes of expression. Madama Butterfly highlights modernist themes with a culture clash between the East and the West, the protagonists being engulfed in incompatible points of view, and a highly personal psychological drama of tragic disillusionment.\n\n1. Exoticism\n\nExoticism is understood as an imaginative act of representing, perceiving, and classifying people, places and cultural practices of a foreign country from the composer’s and audience’s viewpoints through acts of representation and perception.\n\nTo create a vivid sense of what Japan is like, Puccini sets the opera in Nagasaki, the capital and largest city of Nagasaki Prefecture on the northwest coast of the island of Kyushu. Unusual for a Japanese city, Nagasaki was built around foreign interaction and was Japan’s second oldest port open to foreign trade after Hirado. In the mid-16th century, Portuguese missionary traders made the first European contact with Japan in this very city, which was just a small fishing enclave before flourishing into a trading port through the European trade. However, in 1633, Japan was cut off from the outside world by the Tokugawa Shogunate, Japan’s feudal military during the Edo period, under Tokugawa Iemitsu through a series of edicts and policies which remained in effect until 1854. In 1853, Commodore Matthew C. Perry led an expedition to convince the Japanese government to enter into formal trade and diplomatic relations with the West by threatening them with naval warships.\n\nWhen Japan opened up for international trade with the Western world after a treaty was signed in 1854, it marked the end of the intense domestic civil upheaval period. The 1868 Meiji Restoration also led the new Japanese government to absorb and impose Western knowledge in an attempt to modernize rapidly. Historically equipped to handle foreigners as an ideal port for international trade and to host the foreigners overseeing it, the Westerners were able to experience Japanese culture for the first time ever.\n\nNow, even with access to the Japanese culture, one will never be able to fully understand it with its centuries of history. Therefore, the Westerners developed certain exotic stereotypes towards the people of Japan and their culture through a vague idea on what the country is like. Madama Butterfly shows how European people, more specifically the Italians, view Japan. The opera transcends the typical Japonisme elements such as cherry blossom and the geisha culture to tell the sobering truth behind the fantasy of Japan, with all the intense excitement, joy and sorrow of the cosmopolitan life in the late 19th-century.\n\nAnother concern is the legal accuracy in the scenes of the opera, especially in regard to the couple’s divorce. Although Puccini’s librettists visited Japan, they did not have the privilege to access the Japanese law, let alone studying it in detail. Not long after their marriage, Pinkerton leaves Nagasaki but promises to come back for Butterfly. Three years later, Pinkerton finally returns with his American wife, Kate, to bring his half-Japanese son to America. According to the law, his marriage with Kate is considered null as he is already validly married to Butterfly and marriage is monogamous in both countries. In the plot, it is also said that Pinkerton can divorce Butterfly unilaterally by abandonment with ease due to the laxity of the Japanese law. However, this was an inaccurate depiction of the Japanese legislation.\n\n2. Stereotype and Gender Discrimination\n\nBesides that, Madama Butterfly also portrays the sad truth of gender inequality in Japan. As the treaty ports prospered, pleasure quarters were built to satisfy the Western men staying in Japan. Instead of patronizing such establishments, many of them would take temporary wives as live-in partners. Temporary marriage was a sad reality and widespread practice in Japanese treaty ports at the end of the 19th-century. During his stay in Japan, Pinkerton marries Butterfly out of convenience so that he could enjoy a young, innocent woman. However, Pinkerton treats this marriage as a temporary union just to satisfy his sexual desires during his stay in Nagasaki, and intends to abandon Butterfly in about a month after the marriage, believing that he could walk away easily without any harm done to his prospective wife back in America. Thus, this illustrates how Pinkerton sexually objectified the young and naive Butterfly. Like a plaything, she is betrayed and abandoned by a morally bankrupt man who returns to America to find a “real” American wife that is deemed worthy for him.\n\n3. Orientalism\n\nIn Orientalism (1978), Edward Said redefined orientalism as a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the East, shaped by the attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nTo recreate the music with an oriental expression, non-Western exotic scales such as whole-tone scales and pentatonic scales are used. Puccini had no time for such authenticity as the use of true Japanese instruments, but he gives his audience the next best thing by recreating the effect by reducing the instrumentation to flute, piccolo, harp and glockenspiel. The closest Puccini gets to using authentic instrumentation is the use of campanelli giapponese, Japanese bells, Japanese tam tam, cymbals, chimes, triangle to recreate the sound of a Japanese gagaku, a type of Japanese music to give the opera a peculiar “oriental” colour.\n\nIn line with the touches of Orientalism found in the orchestral score are the attempts made by the composer to identify authentic Japanese folk melodies that could be woven into the fabric of the work.\n\nBesides that, there is the Japanese national anthem, Kimigayo, a tune which Puccini uses to announce the Imperial Commissioner’s arrival just prior to the wedding ceremony in L’imperial commissario of Act I.\n\nA tune called the Sakura can also be found in the oboe part as Butterfly takes her personal possessions out of her sleeves and gives them to Suzuki for safe keeping.\n\nThe Nihon Bashi, another Japanese traditional melody, can be heard soaring in the violins immediately after the marriage ceremony is complete in Act I, just before Butterfly corrects her friends and relations and refers to herself as “Madama B. F. Pinkerton”.\n\nMiyasan can be heard in association with the arrival of Prince Yamadori in Act II.\n\nPucinni’s Madama Butterfly is no doubt a unique work despite being accused of misogyny and gross stereotyping. In truth, it tells the passion of youth and the consequence of choice. Like any other girl, Butterfly only dreams of being loved. Throughout the opera, Butterfly is portrayed as a symbol of innocence, love, trust and devotion. She gives her heart and soul to what she believes to be a scared union bound by love, only to be betrayed by the callous Pinkerton who has no regard to the consequences of his actions.\n\nReferences\n\nBailey-Harris, Rebecca. “Madame Butterfly and the Conflict of Laws.” The American Journal of Comparative Law 39, no. 1 (1991): 157-77.
