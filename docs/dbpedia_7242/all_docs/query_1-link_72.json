        "text": "Profiles: The Vocal Mission - George London\n\nNew Yorker, October 26, 1957 p49-92\n\nJoseph Wechsberg\n\n[George] borrowed some money from a benevolent uncle and paid a visit to the West Fifty-seventh Street studio of Enrico Rosati, a singing teacher who had had a hand in training the voices of a number of distinguished singer, including Beniamino Gigli and Giacomo Lauri-Volpi. Rosati listened unenthusiastically while London sang for him, and then told him curtly that he had \"a lot to learn.\" He consented to accept him as a pupil, however, and during the next year London, living in a third rate hotel on upper Broadway, did the best he could to learn a lot, singing scales and practiing solfeggio. Another pupil of Rosati's at the time was Mario Lanza, whom London had known in Los Angeles. Listening to Lanza sing brought back memories of London's Victrola-playing days in Montreal, for it seemed to him that his friend had a natural tenor voice second only to Caruso's - an opinion he still holds.\n\nDuring such moments of respite from their strenuous regimens Rosati allowed them, London and Lanza began preparing for a concert tour that the Columbia Artists Management was arranging. In 1947, Rosati pronounced the young met fit for the tour, and they set out with the American soprano Frances Yeend, who was better known than either of them. The were billed as the Bel Canto Trio, and they travelled from coast to coast and from Newfoundland to Mexico. As the biggest box-office attraction, Miss Yeend received forty-five percent of the take; Lanza, being a tenor and thus commanding a higher price than a baritone, got thirty; and London had to content himself with the remaining twenty-five.\n\nThe Trio performed duos and trios, to piano accompaniment, and each member had two or three solo specialties, London's being the serenade, \"Vous qui faites l'endormie,\" from gounod's \"Faust,\" and Leporello's aria \"Madamina, il catalogo,\" from \"Don Giovanni.\" By and large, the critics praised the trio, and all went well as long as the singers were on the concert platform. Things were not so smooth off-stage. \"As far as Miss Yeend was concerned, the way Lanza and I behaved left something to be desired,\" London said not long ago. \"He and I overate, over drank, overslept, and just generally overdid things.\"\n\nThe personal difficulties of the three singers were aggravated by the fact that Lanza refused to go anywhere by plane, although their schedule was a tight one; Miss Yeend and their accompanist usually took a plane to the next stop, to set things up for their appearance, and she was often kept wondering uneasily if they would all be together in time for the concert, while Lanza and London - the latter preferred the easygoing companionship of his friend while traveling - trailed along by train or bus. Once, Lanza and London slept late, missed a through bus to Mexico City, and had to take a local jitney, which, as it stopped in one hamlet after another, became laden with mothers vainly trying to hush squalling babies, and men whose baggage included quite a lot of livestock. It was fearfully hot, and Lanza and London slaked their thirst with a few bottles of the vin du pays, after which they burst into full-throated song, to terrific ovations from their fellow passengers. The singers reached Mexico City just in time for the concert, but both were hoarse, and Miss Yeend's expression was steely as she took her bows with them on the platform.\n\nAt the end of the tour, Lanza signed a movie contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and the next season [1948), when the Bel Canto Trio set out once more, Mario Berini, who is now a successful publisher's representative and has a hand in, among other things, the export of comic books, succeeded him as its tenor. It was in the course of this tour that London, taking advantage of a hole in the ensemble's schedule as it travelled through Iowa, stopped off at Estherville to give his first solo recital. He was rewarded with a check for three hundred dollars and enough applause to prompt him to sing several encores, including \"Ol' Man River\" - a number that, over the years, has almost become his trademark."
