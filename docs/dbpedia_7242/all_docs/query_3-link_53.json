        "text": "The first bars take the listener to Japan, and he leaves that land of flowers only when the last chord has brought down the curtain. The music allotted to Pinkerton and Sharpless has naturally no Japanese flavour, and the love music is not specially Oriental in character, for love is cosmopolitan and its language universal; but the rest of the work is essentially Japanese. Particularly so are certain parts distinguished by archaic intervals and restless tonality. Indeed, in several cases Japanese melodies have been incorporated in the score, notably the melody which accompanies Goros enumeration of the guests, the Butterfly motive, and the Yamadori theme, so strongly reminiscent of the Mikados theme in Sullivans masterpiece. Yet the composers nationality betrays itself in orchestration and otherwise, and certainly none but an Italian could have written the great Love-Duet.\n\nIf Puccinis own melodies are in themselves not always original -- they occasionally remind us of Gounod, Verdi, and others -- his treatment of them is uniformly happy. In some cases they are very beautiful and haunting; for example, the melodies of the first chorus and the Love-Duet, the Consuls motive, and perhaps finest of all, Butterflys farewell to her child. Concerted vocal writing is not the composers forte, judging from his handling of the trio in the last scene, which would have afforded a greater master an excellent opportunity of displaying his skill in this branch of composition\n\nPuccini, like Wagner, discards all conventional forms except such as arise naturally out of the subject under consideration. Thus it happens that in \"Madam Butterfly\" the chorus work is slight (what there is, by the way, scarcely showing the composer at his best), and there is an absence of what may be called \"set numbers.\" The music runs on continuously from start to finish, and the chief melodies are often given to the orchestra, which here plays a more important part than in any of Puccinis earlier operas. The characters are aptly illustrated in the music assigned to each of them; and the leit-motive is used with consistency and discrimination. The work as a whole is full of interest and charm, and in the last scene rises to a great height of dramatic power, spiritual insight, and musical beauty.\n\nACT 1.-- There is no overture or prelude to the opera. The lively and characteristic theme of the short introduction at once creates the atmosphere of Japan, and prepares us for the scene that meets our eyes on the rising of the curtain. This phrase, which is given out by the first violins, and here developed fugally by the other strings, recurs frequently during the earlier scenes, and may be regarded as typical of a Japanese marriage and all the gaiety and bustle of the ceremony and reception. It is repeated again and again until Goro begins to enumerate the guests, when he is accompanied by a delightful figure, suggestive of their short tripping step, a figure which is heard later on as the relatives arrive.\n\nThe first of the party, Sharpless, is introduced by a tuneful phrase, throughout associated with the\n\nConsul, and descriptive of his kindly, sympathetic nature. After Pinkerton has commented upon the elastic nature of Japanese houses and contracts, he sings a suave strain characteristic of his easy-going, optimistic temperament. The opening phrase in the orchestra will be recognised as the melody of \"The\n\nStar-spangled Banner.\" It is heard several times in the course of the work, when Pinkertons nationality is referred to.\n\nThat his convenient gospel may have fatal consequences, Sharpless points out in a phrase that recurs in the last scene, where the Consul is justified in his philosophy:\n\nDuring Goros absence, Pinkerton describes how he has been fascinated by the little Japanese girl in a dainty, piquant melody, set out with delicate touches of orchestration, suggestive of her grace and butterfly-like charm. A second time Sharpless warns him, now in the following themes, also heard in the second Act, telling him that this child is not to be\n\ntrifled with. He drinks to Pinkertons friends and relatives at home, to the accompaniment of the warning motive (3a), and when the Lieutenant also raises his glass to his future American wife, the phrase (3b) continues the timely advice. Now Goro returns, announcing the approach of the bridal party. He sings a quaint Japanese phrase that forms an accompaniment to the first strains of their voices, heard in the distance, then nearer, and at last in full force on the stage. In this lovely chorus the girl-friends of the bride sing in praise of nature -- the sea, sky, and flowers, as seen from the path leading to the house, and Butterfly at the same time reveals her anticipation of great happiness, supported by the delicious flowing melody of the orchestra. The broad themes of this movement are afterwards used in the duet at the end of the Act, where the lovers declare their mutual passion, intensified by the beauty of the night and the surrounding scene. As the number closes with a burst of ecstasy, Butterfly appears\n\non the stage with her friends, and the motive representing her is given out in the orchestra. Just as the theme (2a) seems to depict the light-hearted American,\n\nso this mysterious, haunting tune admirably characteristics the dainty, delicate creature, whose love is her existence, fragile and elusive like her namesake the Butterfly, yet capable of tragic self-sacrifice for the sake of the adored one.\n\nDuring the simple and artless recital of the story of her life, Butterfly sings to the words-- \"But the strongest oak must fall, when the storm-wind wrecks the forest\" -- a phrase which must be noted. It is developed from one occurring in the unison passage of eastern tonality that ushers in her girl friends. Here the phrase refers to the poverty which caused her to become a Geisha. Later on it recurs twice -- in the First Part of the second Act, when Goro tries to persuade Butterfly that she is deserted by her husband, and, being very poor, ought to marry the wealthy Yamadori; and again in the opening bars of the orchestral introduction to the Second Part, where it indicates that her desertion by her husband will lead to a tragic end. Another important motive is introduced when the death of Butterflys father is referred to, the motive of self-destruction, which has a peculiarly crude Japanese flavour. This theme,\n\nhere incomplete, will soon be heard in a more developed form. Refreshments are brought from the house into the garden to the accompaniment of the marriage theme, and the figure heard before, when Goro enumerated the guests, announces the arrival of the Commissioner, the Registrar, and the relatives. This merry, fascinating measure is continued while the new-comers express their very candid opinions of the bridegroom. As the chorus proceeds, Sharpless offers Pinkerton his congratulations in a bold, striking phrase that stands our from the chattering of the other guests, with which it is cleverly combined.\n\nWhile the Consul, with the other officials, gets the bond ready and the guests are regaling themselves, the bridegroom approaches the bride, and the\n\nbeautiful and passionate love melody (4a) rises pianissimo from the orchestra. When Goro whispers to Pinkerton that the dagger, Butterflys greatest treasure, was sent to her father by the Mikado, the motive of self-destruction (6) occurs in its complete form. Presently Butterfly sings her own theme, (5) telling how she has renounced her religion to adopt her lovers.\n\nAfter the wedding ceremony the orchestra breaks into a quick, rollicking measure while the relatives are feasting. Then with the Bonzes denunciation there is heard a weird, uncanny phrase, signifying that Butterfly is cursed and cast off by her kindred. This theme (7a), consisting of an archaic progression of three major thirds, continues to assert itself till all the relatives have left the stage, when it passes into the gloomy motive of self-destruction (6), which, after more execrations, growing fainter in the distance, and more of the (7a) figure, reasserts itself, as the lovers are left in peace and the daylight wanes.\n\nAt this moment Suzuki is heard within chanting her evening prayer, the marriage theme sounds from the orchestra, and there commences the exquisite Love-Duet. One of the finest parts of the work, it is remarkable for wealth and beauty of melody, for grace and charm of character, and for passionate abandonment. The movement begins with the communing of the lovers, accompanied by a sweet, soothing melody, which with its dreamy, rhythmic flow is wonderfully suggestive of the restful stillness of the summer night, and presents a delightful contrast to the noise and bustle of the wedding ceremony. It is interrupted by a snatch of the marriage motive, when Butterfly retires to a corner at the back to change her wedding garment for one of pure white, and again when the curse (7a) theme breaks in and accompanies her recollection of the Bonzes male-dictions.\n\nAt last all but their mutual love is forgotten as the couple go out on the terrace, and under the starry heavens give fervid expression to the bliss in their hearts. Pinkertons flowing phrases are answered by Butterflys characteristically dainty measures. Then, becoming more responsive, Butterfly pours out her absorbing devotion in exalted strains, echoed by the orchestra. Even yet, however, she cannot entirely forget her relatives harshness, and again the curse motive (7a) intrudes for a moment on her happiness. But she immediately recovers herself, and continues more ardently, expressing her contentment and felicity in her lot. Following the words, \"Yes, I am happy,\" there is the first suggestion of a phrase, afterwards to play an important part in the second Act. It is\n\ndeveloped from the curse theme and may be taken to signify the fulfilment of the curse in the death of the heroine. In this place it suggests that her bliss will end in despair, that her trusting love will bring her great suffering.\n\nMeanwhile she tenderly beseeches her husband to \"love her a little, just a very little,\" in a simple pathetic melody, to which the orchestra whispers an ethereal accompaniment. This short, haunting phrase rises higher and higher, and is finally taken up by Pinkerton, when it culminates in a passionate outburst, in which he declares that she is aptly named his Butterfly, and the orchestra resumes the broad, exalted strain already heard. Thereupon the bride reminds her lover of the fate of the butterfly in his country, and at this point the curse motive (7a) rises once more like a presentiment that her own fate may be similar -- that her heart may be pierced by the one who has caught her. Her fears are quickly dispelled by her husbands assurances and caresses. The music becomes still more passionate, the orchestral accompaniment grows more intense, until the love theme is heard in its entirely, and is worked up by both voices and orchestra to a magnificent climax fortissimo, and then merges into Butterflys motive in the orchestra alone. This fascinating air diminishes to a tender pianissimo, as Pinkerton leads his bride from the garden, and together they disappear into the house. Here may be noted the unusual close on the sixth of the key, as the curtain falls on this wonderfully touching and poetical love idyl.\n\nACT 2, FIRST PART. -- After a few bars of introduction, seemingly evolved from the death motive (7b), the curtain rises. The curse theme (7a) is heard in the orchestra, then the death motive (7b). this is followed by Suzukis prayer that her mistress may be comforted. Presently a forceful, decisive theme accompanies Butterflys fears that the gods of Japan will be little use of them. This theme, which appears to denote her belief in her husbands loyalty, recurs in the orchestra in a persistent manner. In a phrase associated with her husbands return and also later on with the child, the faithful Butterfly recalls his promise to come back to her when the robins are nesting, the chirping of the birds being indicated in the accompaniment; and she displays her trust in his fidelity by describing their happy reunion in a charming song. The introduction here\n\nof the death motive in unison appears to presage that she will not survive the meeting. When the concluding symphony dies away, the Consuls motive, and the marriage theme with its attendant strains, announce the arrival of Sharpless in the company of Goro.\n\nDuring the scene between the Consul and Butterfly, the warning phrase (2b) is repeated frequently, pointing to the fulfillment of Sharpless prophecy in the first Act. Here also a theme\n\nrepresenting Yamadori is heard for the first time. Its occurrence at this stage seems to hint that Sharpless is going to favour the suit of this wealthy lover. When Butterfly inquires of the Consul concerning the nesting-time of the robins in America, the twittering of the birds is again suggested in the orchestra. As the Prince enters, his melody is proclaimed fortissimo, the basses in unison accompanied by the full orchestra. This melody, and the music of this scene generally, have a specially Japanese character. During the interview Butterfly lets them all understand that she still considers herself married to Pinkerton, and therefore, however poor she may be, she cannot accept Yamadori. At this point there is given out in the orchestra the theme already referred to first sung by Butterfly to the words -- \"But the strongest oak must fall, when the storm-wind wrecks the forest.\"\n\nPresently the poor girl grows excited, and the music reflects the state of her mind, as she expounds her idea of the American law of divorce. Tea is handed round to a phrase in dainty show waltz rhythm, then Yamadoris theme accompanies his departure, after which Sharpless motive is repeated as he settles down to read Pinkertons letter to Butterfly. Here a passage occurs, which was heard first in the Love-Duet, when the fate of the Butterfly was referred to. The symphony which accompanies the letter, and which will be heard again at the end of this part of the Act, consists of a repetition of a short phrase for the lower strings, with pizzicato and wood-wind accompaniment, and as the reading proceeds a charming melody is whispered by the higher strings.\n\nWhen Butterfly runs off to fetch her child, the orchestra bursts fortissimo into the love motive (4a), now in more jubilant rhythm. It merges into a theme, already associated with her husbands return, and here associated with the baby, as the mother shows her treasure to the Consul. This melody is continued in the orchestra, while she is speaking of the child, but it is interrupted by snatches of the \"Star-spangled Banner\" theme; by the phrase expressing her belief in her husbands return, as she exclaims, \"Can such as he be forgotten?\" and afterwards by a reminiscence of the love motive (4a), when she says he was born after his fathers departure. In the extremely pathetic song to the baby, a somber, striking theme, principally heard in unison, seems to denote the sacrifice which the mother will eventually make for the sake of her sons future. This melody and the phrase associated with the first appearance"
