        "text": "In a nutshell\n\nThe composer: Giacomo Puccini. Italian. 20th Century. Also famous for La bohÃ¨me, Tosca and Turandot.\n\nThe music: There are numerous Japanese influences in this opera, with the inclusion of both bells and tam-tams often seen in Japanese songs and arrangements.\n\nThe big hit: The heartbreaking 'Un bel di vedremo' (One Beautiful Day) is the aria that every soprano dreams of singing.\n\nThe setting: Nagasaki, Japan\n\nThe history: The opera gathers together Balascoâs play (based on John Luther Longâs short story) and material from Pierre Lotiâs novel Madama ChrysanthÃ¨me to create the full, three-act tale of Cio-Cio-Sanâs betrayal.\n\nA quirky fact to impress your date: Puccini rewrote it five times â and the fifth and final is the one usually performed around the world.\n\nWho was the composer?\n\nGiacomo Puccini. Born in Tuscany in 1858, Puccini is an Italian composer who took Verdiâs crown as the most prominent composer of Italian opera in his day.\n\nRenowned for his love affairs, Puccini left a trail of broken hearts across Italy, but also left us music-lovers 10 beautiful operas, three of which are regularly in the top 10 of operas performed around the world.\n\nWhat makes Puccini, Puccini?\n\nPucciniâs music is sweeping, uplifting, enchanting and always intensely moving. His real genius, however, was to combine that music with stories about ordinary people.\n\nThe composer himself once said his success was due to putting âgreat sorrows in little soulsâ.\n\nWhat happens in the story?\n\nThe American naval officer, Pinkerton, is exploring the world in the name of war and pleasure. He sets his sights on the best and fairest of the land: the stunning Japanese beauty Cio-Cio-San.\n\nFascinated by her exotic beauty, Pinkerton marries her on sight, while Cio-Cio-San, enthralled by his American ways and promise of a modern life in America, falls wholeheartedly in love with the stranger. But Pinkerton already has a foot out the door, looking forward to the day he will marry âa real wife, a wife from America.â\n\nYears pass, and Cio-Cio-San waits faithfully for her husbandâs return from distant shores. Long abandoned by her family, she is alone with her servant Suzuki and a living memento of her American love. She refuses all offers of marriage, singing of her great hope for the day Pinkerton will return. The faithful Suzuki tries in vain to convince her to abandon hope.\n\nBut when his ship comes in, Pinkerton is not alone. As dawn breaks, what will become of Butterflyâs great hope?\n\nWhat's the big hit?\n\nThe heartbreaking 'Un bel di vedremo' (One Beautiful Day) is the aria that every soprano dreams of singing. Butterfly is imagining the day her beloved Pinkerton will return â but even as the music soars with her eternal optimism, there is a suggestion of melancholy in Pucciniâs score, foreshadowing the morning.\n\nWhere have I heard that?\n\nButterflyâs music is used to startling effect in the film Fatal Attraction.\n\nSomething to listen out for\n\nYou canât miss the famous strains of The Star Spangled Banner, which play as the American Pinkerton waits for his Japanese bride and again as Butterfly dreams of her American life.\n\nThereâs plenty of Japanese influence in Pucciniâs score too â he includes Japanese bells and tam-tams in the orchestra and uses the pentatonic scale to create an âexoticâ sound.\n\nA little history\n\nPuccini was in the audience in London to see David Belascoâs one-act play Madam Butterfly in 1900. He was captivated, and wrote to the publisher, âThe more I think about Butterfly, the more excited I become. Ah, if only I had it here with me to work on!â\n\nThe resulting opera gathers together Belascoâs play (based on John Luther Longâs short story) and material from Pierre Lotiâs novel Madama ChrysanthÃ¨me to create the full, three-act tale of Cio-Cio-Sanâs betrayal.\n\nWhen Butterfly premiered in 1904, it was a fiasco. Puccini described it as âa real lynchingâ¦ an orgy of lunatics, drunk on hateâ.\n\nHe reworked the opera, adding Pinkertonâs agonised âAddio, fiorito asilâ aria to the music and making theatrical changes to give Butterfly both more dignity and a greater isolation, to add to the final tragedy.\n\nPuccini rewrote it five times â and the fifth and final is the one usually performed around the world."
