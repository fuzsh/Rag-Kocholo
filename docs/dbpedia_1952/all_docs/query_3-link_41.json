BAG INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY New Delhi Published for Indian National Commission for History of Science by The Indian National Science Academy Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi- 110002 © INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY First Print 1997 Single volume Price Rs. 1200.00 US $ 350.00 Designed and printed by National Institute of Science Communication (CSIR) Dr. K.S.Krishnan Marg, New Delhi- 110 012 FOREWORD There is ample testimony for the emergence and evolution of several advanced large human settlements from about 2500 BC in the Indian sub continent from a variety of artifacts testifying to creativity and skills in areas of agriculture, water management, animal husbandry, construction, tool making, textiles, fired clay pottery, carved stoneware, smelting for metals, alloys and shaped materials for transport, weapons as well as jewellery, decorative objects, toys and instruments for music & games. Natural materials, living renewable resources as well as minerals have been processed to evolve colours, pigments, preservatives, flavours, perfumes adhesives, lubricants, protective coatings and medicinal preparations. The availability in the last 50 years of new scientific techniques of micro analysis, spectroscopy photogr^hy, computer modelling have enabled persuit of new scientific studies and for precise definition of dates, origin and nature of materials, simulation of processes. The Indian National Commission for the History of Science functioning in the Indian National Science Academy has embarked on the major mission of preparation of a four volume History of Technology in India. The Commission has mobilised several scholars in many disciplines of social, historical, physical and biological sciences for authoritative articles and chapters. I am happy Volume I covering the period from antiquity to 1200 AD, has been completed and is now ready for publication. The other volumes for the periods 1200 — 1800, 1801—1947 and 1947 to the present time are being planned and of these, volume HI for the period 1801 — 1947 is in its final stages. These volumes resulting from sustained research, critical assessment of knowledge from several sources, with tables, photographs, sketches and references to sources are very valuable documents. The Indian National Science Academy is deeply grateful to the authors and editors for their painstaking and scholarly contribution to this volume, The services of the Members of the Indian National Commission for the History of science and the Members of Advisory Boards are much appreciated. These volumes will undoubtedly fulfil long felt aspirations and will become inajor reference sources to scholars and the public all over the world. . (S. VARADARAJAN) Chairman, Indian National Commission for History of Science and President Indian National Science Academy INTRODUCTION Each age has its own technology and the technology carries the stamp of its age. ITus is a well-known dictum. But this two-way relationship between society at any epoch and itsWhnology, becomes meaningM only when each topic is t^en by itself and linked with other areas of technology upon which it was dependent or the age in which it was developed. This approach has not always been made possible since in ancient times there was as such no strict boundary of regions, and material techniques moved with movement of people, through trade, commerce and for livelihood. The modon specialists, on the other hand, are mostly bound by their individual speciality, age, and sometimes their individual country. Availability of document and their exact decipherment are problems to this kind of approach. In a book of technology, the technical details are also of primary importance. Keeping these in mind the series was restricted to technology of Indian subcontinent only based on the survey of literary sources, archaeological reports and materials of different periods and dynasties; and studies made on them from time to time. The volume contains contribution of thirty Indian experts and begins with Stone Age and Bronze Age technologies to have some idea of the Indian subcontinent in global context. Various Prehistoric cultural terms like Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age etc. are used in Indian context following European and Mediterranean cultures. There is abundant evidence of Stone Age cultures from the time of Pleistocene and these have been described as early, middle and late Stone Age on the basis of major type of Stone industries found in Soan and Beas Valleys (Punjab & Himachal Pradesh) and river of Narmada (Adamgarh, Jabalpur area, Bhera Ghat, Barasimla, Maheshwar etc.), Krishna Bridge, Ganga & Sone valleys (Barkaccha, Sidhpur, Lekhand etc.) and other places around Bombay and Madras. The fashioning of Stone Age tools and techniques, indicates that there was a continuous struggle by prehistoric man for survival which changed skills of fashioning of crude pebNes or lithic tools stage by stage. The next phase of Neolithic culture is marked by some kind of mixed farming, domestication of animals, use of potteries, building of dwelling houses etc, in which the stone is still the basic material of protection. The Bronze (copper + tin) is found in use in Indian subcontinent at quite an early phase and became a distinctive feature of the Indus Valley Culture (Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Chanhu-daro & other sites). The materials known to the Indus Valley people are gold, silver and copper in dloy with tin (bronze) and with arsenic and lead. From 200 sample analysis, it is found that 23% copper was alloyed with tin, 12% with arsenic and 5% with lead. Tin and arsenic alloy (with copper) were common with Harappan culture whereas tin alloy (with copper) were exclusively used in post-Harappan Banas, Jorwe and other Chalcolithic cultures. The varied range of copper and bronze implements, weiqions and house-hold utensils point to vili large exploitation of metals and flourishing industry of mining, metallurgy and manufacturing trade. Harappan culture witnessed a remarkable standarization of ceramics, brick sizes, both burnt and mud bricks. The skill of brick layers is visible in great public buildings of the citadel complexes, great bath of Mohenjo- daro and granaries of both Mohenjo-daro & Harappa. There is ample evidence of agricultural activities, textiles, town planning, fabrication of houses, domestication of animals, transportation, arts & crafts attesting the antiquity of many other organised technical activity in later times in which India was well-known. What is that supported this vast technological, economic and social activities ? Is it surplus Agriculture ? Huge brick built granaries is of course an indicator. Trade also assisted in two way diffusion of culture and technology. Rgvedic civilization (c.1500 - 1000 B.C.) has been underrated by few paradigms like Aryan invasion, rural civilization (with reference to urban Harappan civilization), absence of cosmic order (rtam) including scientific spirit. These criticisms are not found meaningful. These get added significance when examined against a backdrop of high monistic order, civil war of oppressed agriculturists living in Haryana & Punjab, semi-urban surroundings of people living side by side and other factors. Iron-use got slowly a new lease of life in Karnataka in South U.P.,Rajasthan area in Ahar,Atranjikhera (c.l 150 B.C.), and West Bengal - Bihar area in Pandu-rajar Dhibi Sc Barudih (c 1200 B.C.). This led to some kind of urbanization and power struggle and a complex process of class structure. Originally there was division of labour but no institution of caste. Gradually the impact of caste system categorized people as well as metals, woods and even mundane things into castes and subcastes, a stigma for free exchange of knowledge. The revolt against tradition and conservatism brought in many new ideas and new pursuits. The period from c. 1000 B.C. to the beginning of the Christian era saw new technology with the vedic people. The power struggle and rivalry promoted technology further to protect and augment the power structure. Nanda and Maurya empires flourished. Rapid growth took place in mining, metallurgy, semi- precious gems and weaving industry to manage state control economy. This is clear from the Arthasastra of Kautilya which had prescribed duties for superintendent of mines, metals, coins and mints, ocean-mines etc. The head Superintendent of metals was entrusted to carry, on the manufacture of coins, the ocean mine superintendent was for the collection of conch shells, diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals and regulate commerce on the above activities. There is also reference to guilds of workmen and those who carry on the co-operative along with the details of manufacturing and processing techniques. The work shows unique specialization. To assess the extent of this knowledge, papers have been grouped for better understanding. The details of copper mining from Singhbhum oelt and Khetri areas, gold mining from Karnataka & Andhra, lead, zinc and silver mining from Rajasthan & Karnataka region show that these were based on traditional techniques. The quantitative analysis by modern methods of some of the metal objects available during this period testify the indigenous source on the basis of their composition, temperature at which these were made, nature bf furnaces employed for the purpose, selection of raw materials etc. This furthur corroborates that the forging, lamination ix and smelting techniques were undoubtedly very old. Carburization of iron was known as early as 6th century B.C. The technique of corrosion-resistant forge- welded structures is still a mystery. The methods of coin-making through punching, casting, reponse and die-struck techniques were well-known. The broad chalcolithic phase also witnessed the growth of hand-made,, wheel-thrown and wheel-turned potteries with painted decorations. The BR (the Black & Red) wares of Harappan and post-Harappan sites -Lothal, Ahar, Rangpur, Prakash etc. are unique, and possibly influenced the growth of LR (Lustrous Red) wares of Saurashtra and other sites. The PG (Painted Grey) and NBP (Northern Black Pplished) wares found at Atranjikhera, Hastinapur, Alamgirpur etc. are associated with Iron Age and is contemporaneous with Vedic culture (c. 1200 B.C.) in India. The glass objects were valued primarily as objects of art. The evidence of vitreous paste, frit, faience,glazed etc are evolutionary stage of glass making. The manufacturing details, colouring agents and tools used for fabrication of these materials are now fairly known. The beads, steatite beads, limestone, gypsum, alabaster, lapis lazuli, turquoise, quartz or beryl were also considered by the Indians under the categories of gems possibly for their shining* surfaces and commercial interest. Intersting details are found on the classification of gems, their sources, etymology, and mining. The manufacture of such a wide varities of material objects indicates that the ancient Indians could control various degrees of heat through multi-faced ovens leading possibly to furnace technology. Life, in ancient India was conceived as the manifestation of body, senses and spirit. People were equally prone to new fashion and decorated their own bodies, their homes, temples and gods. Effort was also made to upkeep body and mind and free it from diseases. Obviously plant and animal products got their use very early. But how early metals and metallic compounds began to be used in drugs is not known. The classical works (Brhat Trayi) have mentioned the use of mercury and metallic compounds. Later works have given explicit details of conversion techniques of mercury and metals into pharmaceutically suitable components through different alchemical processes. Sandle paste, flower and flower extracts were common as traditional cosmetics and perfumes used in temples and houses. Early works contain details of various ingredients for cosmetics, their manufacturing process and various combinations. The dyes, pigments and mordants were well-known for the colouring of textiles and painting of potteries, metallic surfaces and pictures. When the hand woven technique of textile changed with the discovery of loom, the changes both in the composition of fibers and natural dyes and their combinations became faster. Colouring materials were obtained from vegetable products of indigo (nila), lac (Idksd), turmeric (haridrd), madder (manjisthd) etc. Minerals like lapis lazuli, calamine ferric oxide lime, lead, blue vitriol etc. were also used. The Surgical techniques developed With the process of survival and was obviously considered as one of the important divisions of Ayurveda. The problems like peptic ulcer, perforation, paracentasis, cauterisation, blood-letting, piles and fistula, problems of stone, laparatomy, hydrocele, rhinoplasty etc were tackled. How were these operations possible in the absence of anaesthesia? The nature of operations, dressing, use of alkali of various strengths both for internal and extern^ application, and the use of 101 blunt and 20 sharp instruments indicate that both pre- and post operative phases were taken care of For correct diagnosis of disease, examination of patients and diseases were recommended through different technical procedures. Clinical observations, diagnosis and cure prospered under medical profession. Critically investigative philosophy came into vogue. The therapeutic techniques for appreciating the cause and nature of the diseases with the systematic medicine through trido^a theory was a unique contribution. The soul (dtma), mind (mana), and body (s'anra) as three components of living entities were considered very important for a holistic treatment towards patients in classical Indian medicine. Agriculture is an old practice and ancient Indians had good knowledge of soil, seeds and sowing method including transplantation, seasons of plantation, use of pesticide, manuring and irrigation. Post-harvest operations of crops, for consumption like grinding, pounding, winnowing, domestic operation like baking, firing, grilling, steaming, cooking under pressure, churning butter and kitchen utensils etc were conunon. The Soma juice and other fermented drinks with details of base materials, ferments and manufacturing techniques were known from ancient times. The period from beginning of the Christian era to c. 500 A.D. saw a lot of transition through Greco-Roman influences. Mathura and Ujjayini became important trade centres. Many important texts were compiled and written. Both national and international trade helped diversification of knowledge & craft of various types and growth of some kind of urbanisation in the South. Town-planning during this period was the part of construction including proper orientation of buildings, sanitary, drainage, temples and use of right types of building materials (stones, bricks, rocks, wood, mortars, plasters). Fortification or erection of a physical barrier against a possible danger was a common practice. The test for stability of soil before any construction of temples, and judicious selection of foundation materials were compulsory. The temples were broad based tapering to a point giving built-in stability. All activities of the construction starting from quarrying of stones of right texture, shade, consistency in sculpting, dressing, setting in proper positions and various other related works were supervised by the ancient architect. Construction of reservoirs, canals, sluices, embankments for irrigation work were common both in north and south India. Various type of water lifting devices for continuous and discontinuous water supply were recommended. The examination of roads, bridges, wells, rivers, were part of the system to meet war & domestic requirements through transportation. Animals like cattle, elephants, equines, camels etc became apart of the organized activity and veterinary science developed following ayurveda with reference to diseases, treatment, training and breeding etc. Water transportation also flourished since it was profitable and easy to move in spite of many risks. Arts and crafts also flourised. The jewellery made of precious metals, gold, silver & other metals and gems have a special place in Indian tradition. Not only is it an asset, it increases the aesthetic beauty as well. Indian gods and goddesses are also found to have been decorated with forehead, ear, neck, arms, ankle, finger ornaments and ornaments with inlay work and studding of gems. Wooden furniture for household or other purposes were quite common for sittings, reclining, rest, and for different categories of persons and dignitaries fiike BrShmanas & Kings). Both xi hard and soft materials like board & dust, birch-bark, palm leaves, leather, cotton, cloth, paper and ink were used as writing materials. Harder materials were mostly used for engraving and embossing. Leather, leather crafts including processing of skin and their uses, leather dresses, leather boats, boxes, parchments, drums and musical instrunaents were also important as part of social life. Standardisation in technical crafts and weights and measures were attempted. This is visible in units of length, breadth, area, volume, weight and also time. Indians believed always in a kind of limited & limitless universe. This is also reflected in the system. The concepts of past, present and future have also been found interesting in its various dimensions. The Suhga dynasty initiated fudalism and caste systeni rigidly. The system continued during Kus3na, Gupta and ^atvShanas. The late Gupta ruler, V^^^a kings, Bhoja, Cera & Colas continued the practice with rights for management of properties and administration which in turn introduced middlemen through system of lease. Feudal class became an organisation of exploitation and carried little responsibility to mitigate the responses from artisans and ordinaiy people. The Delhi Iron Pillar ( c. 4th century A:D.), Konarak Temple at Bhuvaneshwar, Dhar Iron Pillar built by Bhoja (c. 1050 A.D.) represented power, technological skill and knowledge. The volume gives an idea of some of the important technological practices that developed despite social limitations. This has created also gaps and uncovered areas for study. It is hoped that these gaps will be filled up by experts in future. The work is an oul-come of a collaborative effort. The editor is concious of the difficulties for editing such a volume in which a large number of experts and their perceptions arc involved. All efforts have been made to make it meaningful and interesting. The editor is indeed thankful to all the contributors for their co operation. However, he will be thankful for any suggestion for improvement. He expresses his sincere gratitude to the members of the Advisory Board (anpient period) and the Indian National Commission for History of Science for general advice and guidance from time to time. He is equally grateful to Dr. N.R. Banerjee & I^of. S.K. Mukherjee for active help & many valuable suggestions. Thanks are also due to Mr. R.N. Ghosh, Mrs Shabnam Shukla, Mrs Kiran Arora & Mr. K. Jayan of the Indian National Science Academy for their ready support in sorting out documents and all possible help. I am no less thankful to Ms. Sharmila Ghosh who has helped in the computerisation of the volume.

The artificial chipping of stones is termed in prehistory as Tlaking'. In all the three stages of Stone Age, e.g., the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, various ways or methods of flaking were initiated and practised. It was only in the Neolithic period, modification of tool-surfaces was also done by grinding. It may, therefore be held that, the history of lithic technology is more or less an account of flaking techniques. Methods of tool making during Stone Age are marked by two noteworthy trends viz., process of evolution or development of techniques from crude to refine, and universality in the succession of technological stages through out the world. The first pattern has been discussed in ±is paper a little later. The second trend does not bear direct relevance to the present theme. But, it may be mentioned that the element of universality has been explained by the anthropologists in terms of the ‘psychic unity of man kind’ (Herskovits, 1955, p. 1 1 1 ). Inspite of this general pattern of development each of the region has its own set of evidence which has contributed, in one way or the other. It is more in case of the history of techniques of the Stone Age, as the remains of the prehistoric period are of very fragmentary nature. Data obtained from various regions, thus, needs to be woven together in such a way that the acquired set of evidence is critically viewed against the known history, and also adds towards enriching the knowledge further. Our understanding of Stone Age technology depends on the collective efforts of the international galaxy of scholars. The experiments conducted by French prehistorians such as Bordes (1947; 1961),-Tixier (1963), the British prehistorian Leakey, L.S.B. (1967), and the American prehistorian Crabtree, D. (Bordes & Crabtree, 1969), are glaring examples. Not only have they explained various methods of tool making, but they have also provided objective terminologies and ways for the study of the lithic collections (Leakey, 1967; Bordes, 1961; Movius, 1948; Tixier, 1963). Utilization of the important methodologies and the related terms is imperative for the study of prehistoric evidence for any region. Unfortunately, due to historical reasons, there have been shifts and changes of 2 VIDULAJAYASWAL terminologies in the studies of Stone Age in India. The terms denoting periodization, as well as, techniques were effected by this. For example. Palaeolithic- Mesolithic set of terms was replaced by the Stone Age set, e.g., Early Stone Age for Lower Palaeolithic, Middle Stone Age for Middle Palaeolithic and Late Stone Age for Mesolithic. But about a decade later the Palaeolithic-Mesolithic set was again found useful (Misra, 1962 pp. 113-124; Jayaswal, 1978, pp. 10-11; Agrawal, & Ghosh, 1972, pp. 504-509). Similarly, ‘Prepared Core’, ‘Faceted Core’, ‘Faceted Striking Platform’ etc., were the names which replaced the term Levallois technique in Africa {PROP A , 1952, p. 9). This was followed in India, Such changes have apparently added much confusion to the study of prehistoric remains. The author supports Bordes’ plea (Bordes 1961, p,13) and holds that the terms related to technique denote a specific process or method of working only. These do not suggest any cultural implications even if the name has been coined after a site of some far distant foreign land (Jayaswal, 1978, pp. 19-22). It may be mentioned that this author prefers to use all such nomenclatures which have wide acceptance in the literature on World Prehistory. This includes all terms denoting periodization, techno-culture stages, tool-types and techniques. On the basis of these reasons, the proposed study of Stone Age technologies in India has been viewed against the background of the evidence retrieved from all the important regions of the world. The account of the technologies has been divided initially within three parts - the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic and the Neolithic. The technological features of India in each of the section has been discussed after a resume of important techniques which were prevalent during each of the three stages. It may also be put to record that the observations made on technological characteristics of the Palaeolithic remains in India are based on the author’s own studies. While working on the Palaeolithic techniques and problem of Pebble-tools, all the important prehistoric collections of the country were examined by Jayaswal (1978; 1982). Besides, relevant published reports were also found useful, particularly in view of chronological observations. L Techniques of the Palaeolithic Period Numerous techniques which were prevalent during Palaeolithic Period, on the basis of the aims of their utility can be grouped within three categories. A. Techniques used for shaping tools B. Techniques for detaching flakes and blades C. Techniques for modifying edge or tip of tools A. Techniques used for shaping Tools Tool making in human history was initiated at about 1 .8 to 2 million years ago. The Pleistocene sequence and the absolute dates, which are obtained from the Olduvai Gorge and other sites of East Africa, provide evidence for this incident (Leakey L.S.B., 1965; Clark, 1982, ‘ pp. 30-34). The earliest form which man made STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 3 was, one edged crude chopping or cutting implement (Leakey L.S.B., 1951)., The only effort made in this case was to acquire an edge on small to medium sized pebble or cobble. Flaking of one surface (unifacial) at an end of the select piece of rock, or from both the surfaces (bifacial) of the same edge (Fig. I), could provide the desired form of working implement. On account of the nature of flaking this group of tools are broadly divided into Chopper (the one with unifacially flaked edge), and Chopping tool (the bifacially flaked specimen). These terminologies received wide acceptance after being introduced by Movius (Movius, 1948, pp. 329-420). As their techno-typological categories are made mostly on pebbles, the other frequently used nomenclature for this group is Pebble tools (Bordes, 1968; Jayaswal, 1982). Fig. I. Chopper, Chopping tool & By-product flake 4 VIDULA JAYASWAL Besides East Africa where Pebble tools or ‘Oldowan culture (a term used after the type site Olduvai Gorge) remains’ occur in the earliest context (Leakey, 1951), the spread of this tool tradition in a little later context is also reported from North and South Africa, western Europe, Central, South and South- east Asia (Bordes, 1968, pp. 83-97). Pebble tools in India have concentration in the north and north-west, which appears to form part of the south-east Asian spread of this tradition (Jayaswal, 1982, p.2). Besides, there are also a few small pockets in peninsular India where chopper and chopping tool tradition existed in culture isolation (Jayaswal, 1982, pp. 57-83). Chopper and chopping tools of the earliest facies were made by direct percussion stone hammer technique. In the later period the same morphology of these tools were attained also by the use of the direct percussion cylinder hammer or soft hammer technique. AA Direct Percussion Stone Hammer Technique In this method the selected piece of stone which is to be converted into a tool, is held in one hand (generally in left hand). A medium sized, round stone hammer is held in the other hand (the right). Hard blows are delivered on the tool’s surface by hitting the hammer {Fig.2). Due to the use of heavy and hard hammer and the delivery of strong blows, the flakes which are detached from the surface of the tool under making are generally Fig.2. Direct Percussion Stone Hammer Technique STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 5 thick and of medium size. The resultant scars appearing on the tool surface are deep and rudimentary, and provide crude look to the worked specimen. In correspondence with this, the by-product flakes, which come out during the process of flaking the part of the tool, in case of the direct percussion stone hammer technique, retain mostly natural stone .or eortexed surface on the upper part (dorsal) and also have similar unprepared striking platform (Fig.l). Besides these completely unprepared flakes, in the flaking debris of Pebble tools some partly or fully flaked dorsal surfaced and striking* platformed flakes could also be found. Such by-product flakes are usually the result of reflaking of the same edge or surface in more than one series, or flaking at very close intervals as to cover the part of the earlier flaked surface {Fig.3). The direct percussion stone hammer technique in India was widely practiced during the Lower Palaeolithic period. The Pebble tool complex of the north and the north-western part of this sub-continent was made primarily by this technique (Jayaswal, 1982, p. 45). Not only chopper and chopping tools of such sites as Guler (Lai, 1956), Bilaspur (lAR : 1962-63, pp.37- 38) in Beas and Banganga valleys and Lahchura in Uttar Pradesh (Pant, 1982, pp. 39-44) are characterized by deep, crude flaking, but also many of the flakes which are found in association with these tools have eortexed dorsal and unprepared striking platforms (Jayaswal, 1978, pp. 89-95, Jayaswal, 1982, pp. 45-63). But it may be noted that use of this technique in India appears to be much later in date than the African evidence. For the deposits in the Potwar region which retains the remains of this technique are datable to the Middle Pleistocene period (De Terra & Paterson, 1949, p. 295), Fig.3. Abbevillian Handaxe 6 VIDULA JAYASWAL while African evidence suggest an Early Pleistocene date (1.8 million is the date accepted for the beginning of the Pleistocene) (Clark, 1982, p. 36). Pebble tool tradition in India is named as the ‘Soanian/Sohanian culture’ after the concentration of their find spots in the valley of Soan or Sohan of Pakistan (De Terra & Paterson, 1939, p. 2). It may be put to record that though initiated at a very early date, the direct percussion stone hammer technique continued to be used all over the world in all the succeeding periods. But, later on when this very technique was utilized for making another form, the handaxe, this method was given a different name i.e. ‘Abbevillian’. According to the evidence obtained from Africa, the basic form of handaxe had evolved from chopper and chopping tools (Bordes, 1968, p. 5 1). It is therefore, logical to presume that the same technique which was used for the making of the chopper and chopping tools were being practiced for making of the earlier forms of handaxes. A.2 Abbevillian Technique This technique has derived its name from the site L Abbeville in France, where it was recognized for the first time (Bordes, 1968, pp. 52-54). This infact has the same types of flaking scars which are found to be on the Pebble tools made by the direct percussion stone hammer technique. Some time back there was a belief that use of this term would suggest culture contact of Africa or Asia with Europe, where Abbevillian was also recognized as an early stage of handaxe based culture. But this term is now used both for technique and culture stage quite independent from each other. In Europe Abbevillian stage is characterized by crude handaxes having deep flake-scars. The rough pointed tip, unflaked butt and zig-zagged sides suggest that these stone hammered specimens were proto-types of later finely made handaxes of the Acheulian tradition {Fig.3). Not a single collection of the Indian sub-continent has been identified as Abbevillian. But some times the glimpses of this technique can be found in a number of techno-typologically advance industries..Occurence of crude handaxes, for instance, showing stone hammered scars in Acheulian collection evidence practice of the technique under consideration. There is a possibility that such specimens were the ones in which later stage of fine finishing could not be complied. However, there are a few sites such as Mahadeo-piparia (Supekar, 1 968), Bariarpur (Joshi, 1961) etc., where along with Pebble tools, handaxes made by stone hammers are reported (Jayaswal, 1 982, pp. 7 1 -74). Fine Acheulian working in these are restricted. A.3 Direct Percussion - Soft/Cylindrical Hammer Technique The continuation of the direct percussion technique was modified in later times by the use of hammers of elongated shape and of softer material such as bone, antler and wood etc. (Bordes, 1968, p. 24). The advantage of the use of such hammer was that the delivered blow could take out only small and shallow flakes {Fig.4). This helped in controlling the chipping process. It was thus possible to make fine tips and well formed shapes of specialized implements like handaxe and cleaver (Fig.5). FigA. Cylinder Hammer/Acheulian Technique Some times edge of chopper and chopping tools were also made by this technique. The reminiscents of this technique in the form of small and shallow flake scars, were recognized at Sant Acheul site of France, after which the technique is also known asAcheulian technique (Bordes, 1968, pp. 51-52). In Afirica, some time back this technique was named as ‘Chellean’ . The handaxes made in Acheulian technique are the characteristic form of the Acheulian culture, which appears to have originated in Africa around 1.5 million years ago (Clark, 1982, p. 41). but, its complete successive stages are well documented in western Europe. The Lower, Middle and Upper or Advanced Acheulian stages besides typological modification also evidence development of Acheulian technique. It was the Advanced Acheulian stage which was particularly widespread in European, African and perhaps parts of Asian continents. Numerous sites which are reported from peninsular India are characterised by Advanced or Late Acheulian features. The typo- technological characters of our industries compare well with the Isimila, Olorgesaile and Kalambo fall industries of Africa. These Acheulian collections were studies with a view to comparing the India data, by this author at University of California, Berkeley (USA). It was noted that besides finely made lanceolate and ovate forms of handaxes, the flake cleavers of Indian Acheulian tool- kit also have much technological similarities with the African industries of the later facies of Acheulian. In the absence of the absolute dates, and due to the typo- technological similarities with Advanced Acheulian of Africa, Indian Acheulian appears to be datable between one million and 0.5/0.4 million years. The Acheulian remains of the Indian sub- continent was named as ‘Madrasian Culture’ , after the discovery of first cleaver, and also after the concentration of sites yielding handaxes and cleavers near Madras in the later investigations (Krishnaswami, 1948). But, the Acheulian term has also attained wide acceptance in India. Some of very finely worked handaxes of refine Acheulian technique have been reported from Attirampakkam (Krishnaswami, 1938; Indian Archaeology 1964-65: A Review, 20), Vadamadurai(//zJ/art Archaeology 1966-67: A Review,20-2l\\ Jayaswal, 1985), STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 9 Fig. 6, Flake Gudiyam {Indian Archaeology 1963- 64:A ReviewA9) in Tamilnadu, Bhimbetka (Misra,V.N.,1985) and Adamgarh in Madhya Pradesh (Joshi, 1978), and Paisra in Bihar (Pant & Jayaswal, 1991) etc. B. Techniques for obtaining flakes & blades All the lithic implements discussed above belong to the category of core tools, as these were chipped from a lump of rock or stone. There are, however, majority of tools, in all the three phases of the Palaeolithic period,which are made on flakes (F/g.6). A specialized form of flake e.g. long (length more than double or more the breadth), parallel sided and thin is referred to as blade, which evidence culmination of flake detaching technique. For, the attainments of this technique were the input of minimum labour, wastage of very little raw material, but output of large working edges. It may not be just a coincidence that the blade technology was perfected by the Homo Sapiens the proto-type of the modern man. Implements made on flakes though were common during many of the Lower Palaeolithic industries, it was the Middle Palaeolithic period in which flake element predominated and* the technology of obtaining various forms of flakes were perfected. It is interesting to note that the prehistoric man, contemporary to this period, the Neanderthal man, had cranial capacity at times more than even some of the present day men. STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 11 The basic factor which controls the size and shape of flake is known as mass manipulation or the manner in which the delivered force on a core travels. It has been explained by the prehistorians that the force which is applied on the surface of a stone, traverses through the weaker zones and avoids the regions with accumulated mass. In other words the depressions on the core forms the weaker areas through which force spreads easily and is effective, while the raised or thicker parts of the lump are the obstructions which is avoided by the force. In this mechanism by chipping the surface of lump of stone various kinds of weaker- zones and masses could be artificially created on the core, which could predetermine the form and size of the flake. Prehistoric man had understood this by experience, and could utilize this process to his advantage. Experiments conducted by prehistorians (Bordes, 1961; Hordes & Crabtree, 1969) has helped in replicating and, thus, understanding various flake/blade detaching mechanism of the prehistoric times. Flakes (Fig.6) which are important clues for the Palaeolithic technology can be classified in many ways. For instance, on account of the objective of their detachment these form two broad groups viz., the by-products and the intentionally detached flakes meant for making implements. The by-products or the dressing flakes may be the result of the tool working or core dressing process and are the flaking debris. But, the flakes which were obtained for making tools were also acquired by various methods, such as the Clactonian, the Levallois and the Mousterian etc,, which we shall discuss later. But, separation of flakes into a few broad gr*oups and their sub- groups is not easy and beyond debate. Due to this reason, the present author adopted a descriptive criterion for classification of flakes denoting various flaking techniques of the Palaeolithic period of India (Jayaswal, 1978, pp. 15-17). The classification was based on the nature of the dorsal surface and the striking platform. These categories were fifteen {Fig.7). Though descriptive terminologies were used for these categories, a few well defined terms as Levallois flake, Levallois point and blade etc., were retained. A brief description of the proposed classification and important features of the Palaeolithic technology which had emerged from our study has been mentioned below. Classification of Flake/Blade Types 7. Unprepared Flake : The flakes of this group had no preparatory marks. That is to say the dorsal surface and the striking platform in this case are cortexed (pebble surface or natural nodule surface). 2- Flakes with unprepared dorsal surface but prepared and unfaceted striking platform : The dorsal surface of this flake type is similar to the above, but the striking platform, being prepared by single blow, shows an unfaceted plain surface. 3. Flake with Unprepared Dorsal Surface and Prepared & Faceted Striking Platform : Dorsal surface is similar to the types 1 & 2, but the striking platform of the flakes of this group have prepared striking platform having more than one negative scar ridges or facetes. 4. Flake with Partially Flaked Dorsal Surface and Unprepared Striking Platform : The specimens with partially flaked dorsal surface have only one or two 12 VIDULA JAYASWAL and rarely three half negatives or preparatory scars and nearly half of the surface of the dorsal and entire striking platform retaining unworked surface. 5. Flake with Partially Flaked Dorsal Surface and Prepared, Unfaceted Striking Platform, 6. Flake with partially flaked dorsal surface and prepared, faceted striking platform. 7. Flake with Prepared Dorsal Surface and Unprepared Striking- platform: The flake of this group, though having prepared or flaked dorsal surface, do not exhibit any definite pattern of preparation and thus could be classified as Levallois flake. 8. Flake with Prepared or Flaked Dorsal Surface and Prepared, Unfaceted Striking Platform. 9. Flake with Prepared or Flaked Dorsal Surface and prepared, faceted striking platform. 10. Levallois Flake with Unfaceted Striking Platform : The dorsal surface of this type of flake has quite a few centrally directed half negative scars, forming a hump in the centre of the specimen. 11. Levallois Flake with Faceted Striking Platform. 12. Levallois Point : The flake of the group are triangular shaped with a central ridge or a small point/triangular negative scar. The striking platform of these flakes are broad and faceted. These flakes are detached from specially prepared triangular shaped cores with central ridge and/or triangle-scar and ridge, and broad faceted striking platform at the wider end (Hordes, 1961 , p. 1). 13. Blade with Unfaceted Striking Platform. 14. Blade with faceted Striking Platform. 15. Blade with Micro Striking Platform : This group has very tiny striking platform, which is negligible in comparison to the prominent cone. The evidence of the application of pressure flaking is demonstrated in this category. In correspondence with the above mentioned flake/blade types, nine major types of cores were recognized in the Palaeolithic collections of India (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 18). 1. Unprepared Core. 2. Core with Unprepared Dorsal Surface and Prepared Striking Platform. 3. Core with Partially Prepared Dorsal Surface and Unprepared Striking Platform. 4. Core with Partially Prepared Dorsal and Prepared Striking Platform. 5. Core with Prepared Dorsal Surface and Unprepared Striking Platform. 6. Core with Prepared Dorsal Surface and Prepared Striking Platform, 7. Levallois Core : The core of this group are also named Tortoise core’. The centrally directed preparation scars form a hump in the centre which resembles the shape of the turtle back. The striking platform is generally prepared at one of the part of the periphery of the core at nearly 90 angle to the dorsal face (Fig.8). STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 13 8. Bifacial Discoidal Core : It is a bifacially prepared roughly circular or oval core with bi-convex cross-section. The flake- scars on the two surfaces denote that the usually elongated centripetal flakes have been removed from them, alternately, after the usual Levallois type of preparation (Fig,9). The flaking agree perfectly with thatofthe discoidal Mousterian cores, but at the same time it differs from them at least on one point. The specimens of the Indian Palaeolithic industries have been Fig. 8. Levallois Core Fig. 9. Mousterian Core 14 VIDULAJAYASWAL flaked bi-facially, while in the case of the European cores it is limited to the dorsal surface only (Bordes,1961, pp.72-73). 9. Blade Core : Cores for detaching blades are generally elongated specimens with ridge or ridges running throughout the length or a major part of the length. These may have one or two striking platform located on the end/ends, at a low angle to the dorsal face. The unprepared flakes and cores have been found in varying proportions in all the three Palaeolithic phases of the Indian sub-continent. As many as four types within this group has been noticed (Jayaswal,1978, pp.20-21). These are (1) Massive flakes, (2) Massive cleaver-shaped flakes, (3) Small flakes, and (4) By-products. (1) Massive Flakes - Unprepared : This group is also known as Clactonian flakes or flakes detached by Block-on-block technique (Bordes, 1 96 1 , p. 13). Named after the type site of Clacton-on- Sea in England, the Clactonian technique is said to be characterized by the use of block-on-block method. Big blocks of stones are hit against the stationary block or anvil to acquire flakes. The resultant flakes are massive having wide angle (about 120) between the striking platform and the ventral surface. Due to the heavy blow and hard hit these flakes retain prominent cone of percussion. In India such flakes have been found associating the Pebble tool industries of the Potwar region (De Terra & Paterson, 1939), and the Lower Palaeolithic industry of the Narmada basin (Khatri A.P. 1963, p. 186). In the tradition of typical Clactonian flakes they are characterized by unprepared dorsal surface and striking platform and high angle between the striking platform and the ventral surface. These are also massive sized specimens. (2) Massive Cleaver-shaped Rakes - Unprepared flakes: Though similar in technique and size to the preceding one, this group is characterized by cleaver-shaped flakes. Unique to the Nagarjunakonda valley, the flakes of this category have unprepared dorsal surface and striking platform, but are cleaver shaped (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 20). Technologically they exhibit a very striking feature. Only those boulders which showed projecting natural curvatures of cleaver shape were selected for detaching these flakes (Fig. 10). Thereafter, a single heavy blow at the centre of the curvature was sufficient to produce a broad flake having a cleaver-edge on one side. It may, thus, be said that without preparation, the shape of the flake was determined before its separation from the core. These flakes also seem to be detached by block-on-block technique, but one wonders whether these can be logically grouped under Clactonian flakes, as their shapes could be predetermined on the core in accordance with the available natural curvatures. (3) Small Flakes - Unprepared : Frequently found in the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic industries, this group of flakes are smaller than the above two, but larger than the by-products. A sizable percentage of these are retouched and converted into finished tools such as side-scrapers, points etc. The technique STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 15 Fig, 10. Cleaver from Nagarjunkonda Valley applied for obtaining this group appears to be the direct percussion stone hammer technique. (4) By-products : This group of flakes frequently occurs in the Pebble tool industries. The stone hammer direct percussion technique, whenever applied for manufacturing crude implements like chopper and chopping tools, produces a number of these flakes. But, the separation of by-products from the small intentionally detached flakes of the third group, needs caution. Though it may not always be possible to group them with confidence, this author has suggested a 16 VIDULA JAYASWAL tentative method (Jayaswal 1978, pp. 7, 17). It was observed that the by-products are usually much smaller than those flakes of an industry which have either been converted into finished tools or were seemingly meant to be so. These are comparatively smaller than the biggest scar appearing on the artifact of an industry. Often they are not retouched and do not carry definite marks of preparation. It may be mentioned that some of the flakes with partially flaked dorsal surface and flaked but unfaceted striking platforms also belong to the by-product categories. It may be mentioned that in the proposed classification there are three other flake types namely, flakes with unprepared dorsal surface but prepared striking platform, partially prepared flakes, and prepared flakes which deserve a few line of explanation. If compared with some of the flakes of the typical Clactonian industries of England, several specimens of the first two types may be found strikingly similar to them. The partially prepared flakes usually bear one or two half negatives on the dorsal surface. It can hardly be proved that these half negatives are marks of core preparation. But at times it is equally difficult to disapprove it either. Many specimens which have been grouped by us as prepared flakes, similarly may be termed as Levallois, if attempts were made to find parallels in some of the European publications (Bordes F. 1961). There are others in this very group which seem to be the result of imperfect Levallois technique and may be termed as ‘Proto- Levallois’ or even ‘Atypical Levallois’ (Bordes, 1961, p. 13). Levallois technique : It is one of the most misunderstood techniques of the Palaeolithic period. Not only there has been debate for the use of nomenclatures, which was mentioned earlier in this paper, but even the processes involved in this technique are not always clear. F. Borde’s explanations have been found to be most logical and are based on practical experience (Bordes, 1961, pp. 17-20). His definitions and technological classifications have been mostly followed here. The broad definition of Levallois technique includes more than one method of obtaining flake and blade. The principle underlying this technique is that the form of the flake^lade is predetermined on the core before it is detached. This is achieved by the preparation of cores. Preparation of core is confined primarily to the dorsal or the surface from which the flake is to be obtained, and the striking platform on which the final blow is delivered. The dorsal surface is prepared with a view to diverting force in various ways, such as to have circular, oval, cleaver-shaped, triangular or rectangular periphery. The distribution of the applied force in these manners could yield flakes of the desired shapes. On the other hand the nature, extent and position of striking platform (the angle between the dorsal and the platform) also needed preparation. The position and strength of blow was another important factor for the process. Due to various ways of the core preparation at least four distinct categories of flakes could be obtained by application of the Levallois technique. These are - Levallois technique for oval and circular flakes, Levallois point technique, Para-Levallois, and Levallois blade technique, (1) Levallois Technique for detaching Oval and Circular Flakes: Made on medium sized oval or circular lump of stone, this technique is also known as Tortoise core techniques’. The dorsal surface of a typical tortoise core is prepared by centrally directed preparatory flakes, which form a hump in the centre. The STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 17 striking platform is prepared at one of the ends by removing small chips or facetes (Fig. 8). The applied blow on the striking platform in this case result in the breakage of circular or oval flake depending on the form of the core and the placement of the hump on the core. In our classification the oval and round shaped flakes of types 10 and 1 1 belong to this category. In the Paleolithic collections of India the use of Levallois technique is quite well represented. For example, in the Lower Palaeolithic industries the proportion of Levallois flakes occupies upto 15%, while in some of the Middle Palaeolithic industries they form 42% of the flake group (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 199). This feature is quite contrary to the general belief that Levallois technique is poorly represented in the Indian sub-continent. (2) Technique of Levallois Point : The type 12 of our flake/blade classification includes those triangular flakes which were detached by Levallois technique. Levallois point in general are very rare in all the Indian Palaeolithic phase (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 199). In the Lower Palaeolithic phase only though almost fifty percent of the industries had Levallois points, yet their number were found to be very limited (Jayaswal, 1978, Table - 2, pp.138-139). The percentage of Levallois points in the Lower Palaeolithic industries never exceeded 1 .9%. In comparison to this, the type is well represented in the Middle Palaeolithic industries of 'the sub-continent (Jayaswal, 1978, Table - 6, pp 170 - 171). But only three industries viz., Vedullacervu, Tamkur and Mahadeo-piparia evidence the use of this technique. This feature is very different from Europe, particularly the western part, where Levallois technique in general and Points in particular were predominating typical Mousterian industries. (3) Para-Levallois Technique : This technique is also known in the literature on the Palaeolithic period as Victoria - west and Vaal technique, after the regions in Africa, where Acheulian cleavers made on broad flakes were found in plenty (Bordes, 1968, p. 69). The sides or the periphery of large boulder or block of stone is prepared by removing a few large flakes from top and bottom. Striking platform is prepared on a part of the top face. A heavy blow when delivered at the striking platform, results in abroad cleaver-shaped flakes with sharp and broad cutting edge (FigJl). A little working on the side or sides of such a flake should make a perfect cleaver. In the Palaeolithic industries of India the presence of this technique is found in most of the advanced Achulian industries e.g., Attirampakkam, Paisra, Belan valley etc. Dominant proportion of such cleavers and cleaver- flakes were noticed by this author in the tool-kit of Lalitpur and Chirki Nevasa (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 22). The raw material used for Lalitpur industry is granite while for Chiriki-Nevasa the dolerite was used. The big blocks of stones in both of the cases were obtained from the nearby outcrops of Bundelkhand granite and dyke of dolerite. The angular and irregular surfaces of the blocks were prepared in the manner of Para-Levallois, and cleaver-shaped flakes were detached. The flakes detached were mostly broad and were of such perfection that only a little secondary working was needed to covert them into perfect finished cleavers. 18 VIDULAJAYASWAL Fig.lL Para-Levallois Cleaver-flake from Paisra (4) Levallois Blade Technique : Blades detached by Levallois technique evidence a transition between the flake detaching technique and the blade techniques. In fact it is imperfect or proto-technique of obtaining blade. The broad and rectangular specimens of this category many a times have lesser length in comparison to the ratio of breadth. Thus, they fall short of the definition of true blades. Presence of this technique, to the best of our knowledge is neither reported nor has this author observed in the Indian Stone Age collections. Various scholars have experimented on the different ways of obtaining blades. The result acquired helped understanding and elaborating the processes of blade detaching techniques. Experiments carried out by Bordes and Crabtree (1969), has well demonstrated the process. They write, “ the first step of core preparation is to eliminate the rounded surface and establish at first striking platform for preparation of a ridge which is to guide the first blade. Once a striking platform is established by a side blow at one end, one can immediately begin taking off blades, the first of which will have its dorsal side completely covered with cortex\" (Bordes & Crabtree 1969, pp. 3-4>. In many types the striking platform is almost at a right angle to the plane of the core. Various methods like ‘pressure flaking’ (Sankalia, 1964, pp 34-8), and indirect percussion have been suggested for detaching a series of blades by rotating a single core. The cores could be of a various shapes i.e., rectangular, pyramidal and prismatic etc. STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 19 Blades are rare in the Lower and the Middle Palaeolithic industries of India (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 199). The maximum frequency points of the two phases are 6% and 12% respectively. But, the industries of the Upper Palaeolithic period of the Chittoor and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh, Belan valley of Uttar Pradesh and Upper Son valley of Madhya Pradesh indicate that more than fifty percent of flake/blade group belonged to the category of blade. It was also observed that the blades of the Belan and the Son valleys were comparatively longer than those of the Andhra Pradesh group (Jayaswal, 1978, p. 192). But, in comparison to Europe the blade and blade tools of the Upper Palaeolithic phase of India are marked by less perfect techniques and restricted typological forms. The detailed technological studies which were carried out by the present author some time back have brought to notice some interesting features. For instance, it was noticed that the technological attainments of the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic periods in India did not differ widely from each other. Ho.wever, there seems to be a general preference for cruder techniques in the Lower Palaeolithic industries. The proportion of advanced techniques such as Levallois and blade detaching techniques are slightly better in the Middle Palaeolithic phase. This position is very much different than that of Europe, where the Levallois technique is one of the diagnostic traits of the Middle Palaeolithic phase. Similarly, it was observed that, the broad and oval shaped flakes were more common in the Lower Palaeolithic phase of India, while the elongated and round flakes were somewhat more frequent in the Middle Palaeolithic. Besides, no evidence could be retrieved to suggest that particular shapes of flakes were acquired for some typical tool forms. The only exception to this observation was the cleaver-shaped flake of the Acheulian industries. Further, it was noted that the shape of the parent core, its preparation, the angle of stroke given to detach the flake and the amount of force applied for the purpose, were the major factors responsible for determining the shape of flake/blade. During the course of our analysis of the Palaeolithic technology, it was noted that raw material is the other factor which seems to have influenced the techniques and size of flakes and blades (Jayaswal, 1978, pp. 206-211). The form and nature of raw material in a particular region i.e., the size, shape and form of nodules, pebbles and block of stones along with their composition appears to be the guiding factors. For instance, if only small pebbles were available as raw material in a region, then the prehistoric man of the region was not in a position to make very big tools out of them. On the contrary, if big blocks of stones were to be selected for the purpose in another region, the first action of the prehistoric man for manufacturing implements would be to avail manageable flakes from them and then work them out into desired tools. The Lower Palaeolithic industries from the factory sites of the Belan-Seoti valley provide illustrative example of the latter instance. Though the Lower Palaeolithic industries in general are dominated by artifacts made on core, yet the Belan group of industries chow the predominance of flakes and flake-tools. For, it was necessary in this region to detach flakes first, from the big quartzite blocks and then convert them into finished tools or some times into cores for detaching flakes and blades. 20 VIDULA JAYASWAL It was also attempted to determine the influence of the composition of raw material on technology, during our study of Palaeolithic techniques (Jayaswal, 1972-73, pp. 64-70). For this, twelve Middle Palaeolithic industries were selected and classified within three groups on the basis of the use of raw material. These were - (1) Industries made on quartzite (rough grained rock); (2) Industries made on quartzite and minerals (rough grained and fine grained siliceous stones); and, (3) Industries consisting of tools of minerals only (fine grained siliceous rocks like chert, jasper, chalcedony etc.). The industries of Vedullachervu, Nandipalle, Vadamanu and Ramgarhwa belonged to the first group, while Mahaeo-piparia, Adamgarh, Anagwadi and Kurnool show the use of both the types of stones. The last group is formed by the industries of Tamakur, Nalgonda, Luni and Kovalli. The percentages of Levallois element (both flake and point) indicated that this technique was more frequently employed in areas where quartzite was used for manufacturing tools. Conversely, it was least in vogue in those industries which were made on fine grained stones. In case of such industries where both the kinds of stones were used, it is quartzite which seems to be more suitable for manufacturing Levallois flakes and points. Technological variation within a typological group of industries of the Lower Palaeolithic phase also depended on the nature of raw material. The industries of Nagarjunakonda- 1 and Chirki-Nevasa, for instance, belonged to one typological group viz., cleaver dominated Acheulian group. Though cleavers were found to be dominating both of these industries, great variation was noticed in the techniques of detaching cleaver-flakes. In Nagarjunakonda valley big boulders of quartzite were available to the Acheulian man. He cleverly exploited their natural curvatures for obtaining cleaver-shaped flakes without artificially preparing the surface of the cores (Fig. 10). In contrast to this at Chirki-Nevasa, the raw material was obtained from the nearby dykes of dolerite. The angular blocks of stones needed a thorough preparation before detaching desired flakes. The cleaver-flake of Chirki-Nevasa tool-kit evidence use of Para-Levallois (Fig.ll). The form of raw material, thus seems to be one of the significant factors responsible for the predominance of unprepared cleaver- shaped flakes in the Nagarjunakonda industry and of the prepared and Levallois flakes in Chirki-Nevasa industry. C. Techniques for modifying edge & tip of tools Careful and controlled flaking was done to modify the edge and tip of artifacts throughout the Palaeolithic period, which is referred to as retouching. This effort was particularly needed to give shape, increase sharpness of the edge and even blunting the edge of a flake or a blade. Various types of scrapers and pointed implements were made by retouching. Retouching during the Palaeolithic period was performed by direct percussion technique and by using both stone hammer or soft and cylindrical hammer. These are categorized within two types e.g., the low angle retouch and the high angle retouch. Low angle retouching was done primarily during the Lower and the Middle Palaeolithic phases when edge of flake needed to be sharpened. The angle of the retouched portion in this case range around 60^ - 70°. But, with the prevalence of blade technology when both the edges were sharp there was a need to blunt one of the edges for hafting purposes. It was due to this STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 21 requirement that retouching at high angle (more than 70® - 75®) had to be initiated. During Upper Paleolithic various forms of backed blades or knives were made by high angle retouching or blunting. In India though both the types of retouchings were done, the amount of modiEcation of the form of edges were not a very general practice. With the result, our Palaeolithic tool-kits appear mediocre in comparison to the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic implement collections of Europe. The bone and antler industry which had flourished during, the Upper Palaeolithic phase of Europe (Hordes, 1968, pp.147-166), is not well represented in India. Though there are a few claims for bone tools, these are either lost or if available do not evidence good workmanship. Biit, the specimen which has been reported from Gravel III of Belan, Uttar Pradesh, and referred to as ‘Mother goddess figurine’ (Misra, V.D. 1977, PI. V) evidence good craftsmanship, but appears to be an isolated example of its kind. In correspondence with the paucity of bone craftsmanship, the Upper Palaeolithic collections in India, in general, lack presence of burins. Even when present this type is simple formed and much restricted in number (Jayaswal 1978, pp. 174- 193). It may be recalled that burin is a specialized implement form which was used for working and engraving bone, antler and ivory (Jayaswal, 1987, pp. 42 - 45). It may not be a mere coincidence that both burin industry and the bone/ivory craftsmanship flourished in Europe during upper Palaeolithic times. IL Techniques Of the Mesolithic Period The diagnostic tool group of the Mesolithic period, throughout the world has been identified as Microliths. The tiny artefacts of this category are characterized by two features. One that these are made on bladelet (micro-blade having breadth 12 mm or less). The other, that at least one of the edges of these specimens was deliberately blunted by high angle retouching. There are a group of implements in Mesolithic tool-kit which fulfil these two criteria. Microliths were made in geometric forms such as triangular and trapezoidal shapes, and non- geometrical forms, lunate or various types of a backed bladelets (Fig.12). The provision for hafting (by blunting of edge) and the small size are so pronounced in case of microliths that the presumption hold good that this group was used in composite form, (putting together more than one tool) on a base of wood or bone (Jayaswal, 1989, vide Fig.lO). The technology of microlith making appears to be of local origin in India (Jayaswal, in Press). The appearance and the earliest existence of microliths in our area of study is in association with the fulfledged blade, industries of the Upper Palaeolithic period. The techno-typological features borne by microliths indicate that this technocratic group was modification and development over the blade technology. The dimension of the blade element was reduced to form bladelets. Besides, the earlier tradition of modifying edge/edges at high angle was also adopted as an essential process fOr giving shapes to the implements. Besides, the beginnings of microlith making in central India is datable to circa twenty-fourth millennium B.C. The archaeological remains from Gravel III of the Belan-Seoti valley (Pant, 1982, pp. 101-102) and the Son valley (Sharma & Clark, 1983, p. 22 VIDULA JAYASWAL Fig. 12. Microliths 287), indicate that the Upper Palaeolithic industries which are dated by the Radiocarbon method between 24,000 and 18,000 B.C. are associated with microliths. Itis interesting to note that right from the beginning when pigmy tools formed only a small proportion (10%) of the tool-kit, the microlithic technology appears in developed form. But the implement forms are mostly non-specific. For, the microlithic group is dominated by backed- bladelets and presence of a few lunates. Such perfect geometric forms as triangle and trapeze are either absent or when present (triangles are generally found in this phase), these are in negligible proportion and mostly atypical forms (Pant, 1982, pp. 104-105), It may, therefore, be concluded that, making of microliths emerged in the last phase of the Pleistocene period. The technological trait seems to have developed from the blade industries and thus was innovation. Similar situation is also found in Europe where microliths STONE AGE TECHNIQUES 23 appear in the Upper Palaeolithic industries of the later Pleistocene epoch. The tool-kit of Magda-lenian culture is associated with microliths (Bordes,1968, p.l64) Microliths predominate (up to 80% of the finished tools) all the Mesolithic industries of India, be it of ‘Early’ or ‘Advanced’ stage. Geometric forms p^ticularly triangle, became more popular during Mesolithic times (Jayaswal, in Press). All the other remaining techno-typological features remained almost unaltered. It has also been shown by this author that microlithic technology continued to persist for a very long period in Central India. Undisrupted continuation of this technology is evident in the hills of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, even up to the Historical period (Jayaswal, In press). In this' case, microliths existed as parallel technological trait with Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Iron Age cultures. It was observed that though there is a gradual decrease of frequency of microliths from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic periods, there is a sudden fall in the proportion of microliths during the early Historical period (Iron Age). Besides, the general techno-typology of the microlithic toolkit remains somewhat unchanged during the earlier three culture stages, while there is marked increase in trapeze during the Iron Age. HI. Techniques of the Neolithic Period The lithic technologies of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic times are marked by a process of development in which two tendencies were pronounced. One, the economy of labour and raw material, which can be seen in terms of the Levallois technique to the blade detaching technique. In case of the latter, expenditure of very limited time and wastage of stone was able to produce much larger and sharper working edges, than was acquired by the flakes obtained by Levallois techniques. Second, during the course of this development the size of implements was gradually decreasing, the culmination of which can be seen in the case of the microliths. Contrary to this the lithic technological attainment appears to reverse back to the earlier technological stage during the Neolithic period. For instance, not only large to very large size tool making was initiated, which compares well with Acheulian tools of the Lower Palaeolithic times, but also input of laborious processes were being involved. The Neolithic technological innovation is marked by the Ground stone tools or axes. Many forms of axes, chisels, picks, hoes, were made which together form tool-kil of a carpenter. Ma"
