        "text": "[Effects of postnatal growth retardation on early neurodevelopment in premature infants with intrauterine growth retardation].\n\nPubMed\n\nCai, Yue-Ju; Song, Yan-Yan; Huang, Zhi-Jian; Li, Jian; Qi, Jun-Ye; Xiao, Xu-Wen; Wang, Lan-Xiu\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo study the effects of postnatal growth retardation on early neurodevelopment in premature infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 171 premature infants who were born between May 2008 and May 2012 and were followed up until a corrected gestational age of 6 months. These infants were classified into two groups: IUGR group (n=40) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) group (n=131). The growth retardation rates at the corrected gestational ages of 40 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, as well as the neurodevelopmental outcome (evaluated by Gesell Developmental Scale) at corrected gestational ages of 3 and 6 months, were compared between the two groups. The growth retardation rate in the IUGR group was significantly higher than in the AGA group at the corrected gestational ages of 40 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. All five developmental quotients evaluated by Gesell Developmental Scale (gross motor, fine motor, language, adaptability and individuality) in the IUGR group were significantly lower than in the AGA group at the corrected gestational ages of 3 months. At the corrected gestational age of 6 months, the developmental quotients of fine motor and language in the IUGR group were significantly lower than in the AGA group, however, there were no significant differences in the developmental quotients of gross motor, adaptability and individuality between the two groups. All five developmental quotients in IUGR infants with catch-up lag in weight were significantly lower than in IUGR and AGA infants who had caught up well. Growth retardation at early postnatal stages may adversely affect the early neurodevelopment in infants with IUGR.\n\nDietary nucleotides and early growth in formula-fed infants: a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinghal, Atul; Kennedy, Kathy; Lanigan, J; Clough, Helen; Jenkins, Wendy; Elias-Jones, Alun; Stephenson, Terrence; Dudek, Peter; Lucas, Alan\n\n2010-10-01\n\nDietary nucleotides are nonprotein nitrogenous compounds that are found in high concentrations in breast milk and are thought to be conditionally essential nutrients in infancy. A high nucleotide intake has been suggested to explain some of the benefits of breastfeeding compared with formula feeding and to promote infant growth. However, relatively few large-scale randomized trials have tested this hypothesis in healthy infants. We tested the hypothesis that nucleotide supplementation of formula benefits early infant growth. Occipitofrontal head circumference, weight, and length were assessed in infants who were randomly assigned to groups fed nucleotide-supplemented (31 mg/L; n=100) or control formula without nucleotide supplementation (n=100) from birth to the age of 20 weeks, and in infants who were breastfed (reference group; n=101). Infants fed with nucleotide-supplemented formula had greater occipitofrontal head circumference at ages 8, 16, and 20 weeks than infants fed control formula (mean difference in z scores at 8 weeks: 0.4 [95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.7]; P=.006) even after adjustment for potential confounding factors (P=.002). Weight at 8 weeks and the increase in both occipitofrontal head circumference and weight from birth to 8 weeks were also greater in infants fed nucleotide-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula. Our data support the hypothesis that nucleotide supplementation leads to increased weight gain and head growth in formula-fed infants. Therefore, nucleotides could be conditionally essential for optimal infant growth in some formula-fed populations. Additional research is needed to test the hypothesis that the benefits of nucleotide supplementation for early head growth, a critical period for brain growth, have advantages for long-term cognitive development.\n\nBreast Milk Lipidome Is Associated with Early Growth Trajectory in Preterm Infants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoyon, Thomas; Antignac, Jean-Philippe; Qannari, El Mostafa; Croyal, MikaÃ«l; Soumah, Mohamed; David-Sochard, AgnÃ¨s; Billard, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Legrand, Arnaud; Boscher, CÃ©cile; Darmaun, Dominique; RozÃ©, Jean-Christophe\n\n2018-01-01\n\nHuman milk is recommended for feeding preterm infants. The current pilot study aims to determine whether breast-milk lipidome had any impact on the early growth-pattern of preterm infants fed their own motherâs milk. A prospective-monocentric-observational birth-cohort was established, enrolling 138 preterm infants, who received their own motherâs breast-milk throughout hospital stay. All infants were ranked according to the change in weight Z-score between birth and hospital discharge. Then, we selected infants who experienced âslowerâ (n = 15, â1.54 Â± 0.42 Z-score) or âfasterâ (n = 11, â0.48 Â± 0.19 Z-score) growth; as expected, although groups did not differ regarding gestational age, birth weight Z-score was lower in the âfaster-growthâ group (0.56 Â± 0.72 vs. â1.59 Â± 0.96). Liquid chromatographyâmass spectrometry lipidomic signatures combined with multivariate analyses made it possible to identify breast-milk lipid species that allowed clear-cut discrimination between groups. Validation of the selected biomarkers was performed using multidimensional statistical, false-discovery-rate and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) tools. Breast-milk associated with faster growth contained more medium-chain saturated fatty acid and sphingomyelin, dihomo-Î³-linolenic acid (DGLA)-containing phosphethanolamine, and less oleic acid-containing triglyceride and DGLA-oxylipin. The ability of such biomarkers to predict early-growth was validated in presence of confounding clinical factors but remains to be ascertained in larger cohort studies.

Study design Prospective longitudinal study following infants (n=1046) born to women who had previously participated in a cluster randomised trial of micronutrient supplementation (ANZCTR:12610000944033), Ha Nam province, Vietnam. Antenatal and early infant factors were assessed for association with the primary outcome of infant length-for-age z scores at 6â months of age using multivariable linear regression and structural equation modelling. Results Mean length-for-age z score was â0.58 (SD 0.94) and stunting prevalence was 6.4%. Using structural equation modelling, we highlighted the role of infant birth weight as a predictor of infant growth in the first 6â months of life and demonstrated that maternal body mass index (estimated coefficient of 45.6â g/kg/m2; 95% CI 34.2 to 57.1), weight gain during pregnancy (21.4â g/kg; 95% CI 12.6 to 30.1) and maternal ferritin concentration at 32â weeks' gestation (â41.5â g per twofold increase in ferritin; 95% CI â78 to â5.0) were indirectly associated with infant length-for-age z scores at 6â months of age via birth weight. A direct association between 25-(OH) vitamin D concentration in late pregnancy and infant length-for-age z scores (estimated coefficient of â0.06 per 20â nmol/L; 95% CI â0.11 to â0.01) was observed. Conclusions Maternal nutritional status is an important predictor of early infant growth. Elevated antenatal ferritin levels were associated with suboptimal infant growth in this setting, suggesting caution with iron supplementation in populations with low rates of iron deficiency.

We compared IGF-I and its relation to growth in early childhood in very-low-birth-weight infants and term appropriate for gestational age born infants. We included 41 very-low-birth-weight and 64 term infants. Anthropometry was performed at all visits to the outpatient clinic. IGF-I and insulin were measured in blood samples taken at 6 months and 2 years corrected age (very-low-birth-weight children) and at 3 months, 1 and 2 years (term children). Over the first 2 years of life growth parameters are lower in very-low-birth-weight children compared to term children, but the difference in length decreases significantly. During the first 2 years of life IGF-I is higher in very-low-birth-weight children compared to term children. In both groups there is a significant relationship between IGF-I and (change in) length and weight over the first 2 years of life and between insulin and change in total body fat. Considering the relation of IGF-I to growth and the decrease in difference in length, higher IGF-I levels in very-low-birth-weight infants in early childhood probably have an important role in catch-up growth in length.\n\nAntenatal and early infant predictors of postnatal growth in rural Vietnam: a prospective cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHanieh, Sarah; Ha, Tran T; De Livera, Alysha M; Simpson, Julie A; Thuy, Tran T; Khuong, Nguyen C; Thoang, Dang D; Tran, Thach D; Tuan, Tran; Fisher, Jane; Biggs, Beverley-Ann\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo determine which antenatal and early-life factors were associated with infant postnatal growth in a resource-poor setting in Vietnam.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 238 Korean mild preterm infants from birth up to 6âmonths of corrected age regarding four of the biological and sociocultural factors such as health risks (at birth and discharge), maternal employment status, and the infant sex. There were four noteworthy findings on growth variation in Korean mild preterm infants during early infancy: (i) the secular trend of intrauterine growth; (ii) the cumulative adverse effects of four risk factors; (iii) the possible burden of maternal employment if insufficient support; and (iv) the possibility of the cultural favoritism to male infants regardless of the modern industrialized society. The study suggests that, in a modern society, while mild preterm infants could sustain typical fetal growth, the early postnatal growth may vary based on health risks and sociocultural circumstances related to child-bearing and -rearing practices surrounding them.

Our aim was to examine whether head growth in the first 3 years differed between children with ASD from a high-risk (HR) sample of infant siblings of children with ASD (by definition, multiplex), HR siblings not diagnosed with ASD, and low-risk (LR) controls. Method: Participants included 442 HR and 253 LR infants from 12 sites of the international Baby Siblings Research Consortium. Longitudinal HC data were obtained prospectively, supplemented by growth records. Random effects non-linear growth models were used to compare HC in HR infants and LR infants. Additional comparisons were conducted with the HR group stratified by diagnostic status at age 3: ASD (n=77), developmental delay (DD; n=32), and typical development (TD; n=333). Nonlinear growth models were also developed for height to assess general overgrowth associated with ASD. Results: There was no overall difference in head circumference growth over the first 3 years between HR and LR infants, although secondary analyses suggested possible increased total growth in HR infants, reflected by the model asymptote. Analyses stratifying the HR group by 3-year outcomes did not detect differences in head growth or height between HR infants who developed ASD and those who did not, nor between infants with ASD and LR controls. Conclusion: Head growth was uninformative as an ASD risk marker within this HR cohort.

We hypothesised that growth during hospitalisation would impact neurological outcome differently, depending on infant gender. Surviving infants born between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2009 with a gestational age <33â weeks, and enrolled in Loire Infant Follow-up Team, a regional cohort in western France, qualified for the study. Growth during neonatal hospitalisation was assessed by the change in weight z-score between birth and discharge, and infants where ranked into 5 classes, depending on their change in z-score (<-2, -2 to -1.01, -1 to -0.51, -0.50 to 0.01 and â¥0), the last class being the reference. The main outcome criterion was neurodevelopmental outcome at 2â years of corrected age. For each class of changes in weight z-score, crude or adjusted OR for non-optimal outcome was calculated for each gender, and compared between genders. 1221 boys and 1056 girls were included. Gender and early growth interact, (p=0.02). Moreover when change in weight z-score varied from <-2 to (-0.50 to -0.01), adjusted OR for non-optimal outcome varied from 3.2 (1.5-6.8) to 2.2 (1.2-4.1) in boys versus 1.8 (0.7-4.2) to 0.95 (0.4-1.9) in girls. For each class, the OR was significantly higher in boys. In very preterm infants, male neurodevelopment appears to be much more sensitive than female to poor postnatal growth.

Our objective was to determine whether early aggressive protein intake improved growth outcomes of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. ELBW infants were included in the study if they had no major congenital anomalies or renal failure and were still hospitalized at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. In 25 infants (HP) the early protein intake was planned to be 20% greater than in 31 historical controls (SP). The 2 groups were similar in the baseline characteristics. The mean protein intake during the first 14 days of life was significantly greater in the HP group (3.1 +/- 0.2 vs 2.5 +/- 0.2 g/kg/d; P<0.0001). HP group showed lower postnatal weight loss (-3.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -5.9, -0.2) and earlier regain of birth weight (-4.1 days; 95% CI -6.6, -1.7). Mean blood urea nitrogen and bicarbonate levels were similar; mean serum glucose level was lower in the HP group (-21,7 mg/dL; 95% CI -41.9,-1.5). HP infants had a reduced fall in weight z score (-0.57; 95% CI -1.01, -0.12) and in length z score (-0.51; 95% CI -0.97, -0.05) from birth to discharge. Early high protein intake was associated with improved weight and length growth outcomes at discharge. These findings highlight the benefits of aggressive protein intake immediately after birth.\n\nEarly nutrition, growth and cognitive development of infants from birth to 2Â years in Malaysia: a study protocol.\n\nPubMed\n\nNurliyana, Abdul Razak; Mohd Shariff, Zalilah; Mohd Taib, Mohd Nasir; Gan, Wan Ying; Tan, Kit-Aun\n\n2016-09-29\n\nThe first 2Â years of life is a critical period of rapid growth and brain development. During this period, nutrition and environmental factors play important roles in growth and cognitive development of a child. This report describes the study protocol of early nutrition, growth and cognitive development of infants from birth to 2Â years of age. This is a prospective cohort study of mothers and infants recruited from government health clinics in Seremban district in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Infants are followed-up at 6, 12, 18 and 24Â months of age. Pre-natal factors that include mother's pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, blood glucose and blood pressure during pregnancy, infant's gestational age, birth weight and head circumference at birth are obtained from patient card. Post-natal factors assessed at each follow-up are feeding practices, dietary intake, anthropometric measurements and cognitive development of infants. Iron status is assessed at 6Â months, while infant temperament and home environment are assessed at 12Â months. Maternal intelligence is assessed at 18Â months. Early life nutritional programming is of current interest as many longitudinal studies are actively being conducted in developed countries to investigate this concept. The concept however is relatively new in developing countries such as Malaysia. This study will provide useful information on early nutrition and infant development in the first two years of life which can be further followed up to identify factors that track into childhood and contribute to growth and cognitive deviations.\n\nEarly weaning from incubator and early discharge of preterm infants: randomized clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nZecca, Enrico; Corsello, Mirta; Priolo, Francesca; Tiberi, Eloisa; Barone, Giovanni; Romagnoli, Costantino\n\n2010-09-01\n\nThe goal was to assess the feasibility of earlier weaning from the incubator for preterm infants. This was a prospective, randomized study with preterm infants with birth weights of <1600 g who were admitted to a neonatal subintensive ward. Findings for 47 infants who were transferred from an incubator to an open crib at >1600 g (early transition group) were compared with those for 47 infants who were transferred from an incubator to an open crib at >1800 g (standard transition [ST] group). The primary outcome of the study was length of stay. Secondary outcomes were the number of infants returned to an incubator, the growth velocity in an open crib and during the first week at home, the proportions of breastfeeding at discharge and during the first week at home, and the hospital readmission rate. The length of stay was significantly shorter in the early transition group than in the standard transition group (23.5 vs 33 days; P=.0002). No infants required transfer back to the incubator. Only 1 infant in the standard transition group was readmitted to the hospital during the first week after discharge. Growth velocities and individual amounts of breastfeeding were similar between the 2 groups. In this study, weaning of moderately preterm infants from incubators to open cribs at 1600 g was safe and resulted in earlier discharge.\n\nInfant pain-related negative affect at 12 months of age: early infant and caregiver predictors.\n\nPubMed\n\nDin Osmun, Laila; Pillai Riddell, Rebecca; Flora, David B\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo examine the predictive relationships of early infant and caregiver variables on expressed pain-related negative affect duration at the 12-month immunization. Infants and their caregivers (N = 255) were followed during immunization appointments over the first year of life. Latent growth curve modeling in a structural equation modeling context was used. Higher levels of initial infant pain reactivity at 2 months and caregiver emotional availability averaged across 2, 4, and 6 months of age were related to larger decreases in the duration of infant negative affect over the first 6 months of life. Longer duration of infant negative affect at 2 months and poorer regulation of infant negative affect over the first 6 months of life predicted longer durations of infant negative affect by 12 months. Infant negative affect at 12 months was a function of both infant factors and the quality of caregiver interactive behaviors (emotional availability) in early infancy.\n\nThe Chinese-born immigrant infant feeding and growth hypothesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBolton, Kristy A; Kremer, Peter; Hesketh, Kylie D; Laws, Rachel; Campbell, Karen J\n\n2016-10-11\n\nRapid growth in the first six months of life is a well-established risk factor for childhood obesity, and child feeding practices (supplementation or substitution of breast milk with formula and early introduction of solids) have been reported to predict this. The third largest immigrant group in Australia originate from China. Case-studies reported from Victorian Maternal and Child Health nurses suggest that rapid growth trajectories in the infants of Chinese parents is common place. Furthermore, these nurses report that high value is placed by this client group on rapid growth and a fatter child; that rates of breastfeeding are low and overfeeding of infant formula is high. There are currently no studies which describe infant growth or its correlates among this immigrant group. We postulate that in Australia, Chinese-born immigrant mothers will have different infant feeding practices compared to non-immigrant mothers and this will result in different growth trajectories and risk of overweight. We present the Chinese-born immigrant infant feeding and growth hypothesis - that less breastfeeding, high formula feeding and early introduction of solids in infants of Chinese-born immigrant mothers living in Australia will result in a high protein intake and subsequent rapid growth trajectory and increased risk of overweight and obesity. Three related studies will be conducted to investigate the hypothesis. These will include two quantitative studies (one cross-sectional, one longitudinal) and a qualitative study. The quantitative studies will investigate differences in feeding practices in Chinese-born immigrant compared to non-immigrant mothers and infants; and the growth trajectories over the first 3.5Â years of life. The qualitative study will provide more in-depth understanding of the influencing factors on feeding practices in Chinese-born immigrant mothers. This study will provide evidence of the potential modifiable feeding practices and risk of overweight faced\n\nEnteral nutrition for optimal growth in preterm infants\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEarly, aggressive nutrition is an important contributing factor of long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. To ensure optimal growth in premature infants, adequate protein intake and optimal protein/energy ratio should be emphasized rather than the overall energy intake. Minimal enteral nutrition should be initiated as soon as possible in the first days of life, and feeding advancement should be individualized according to the clinical course of the infant. During hospitalization, enteral nutrition with preterm formula and fortified human milk represent the best feeding practices for facilitating growth. After discharge, the enteral nutrition strategy should be individualized according to the infant's weight at discharge. Infants with suboptimal weight for their postconceptional age at discharge should receive supplementation with human milk fortifiers or nutrient-enriched feeding, and the enteral nutrition strategy should be reviewed and modified continuously to achieve the target growth parameters. PMID:28194211\n\nBirth weight and infant growth: optimal infant weight gain versus optimal infant weight.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiong, Xu; Wightkin, Joan; Magnus, Jeanette H; Pridjian, Gabriella; Acuna, Juan M; Buekens, Pierre\n\n2007-01-01\n\nInfant growth assessment often focuses on \"optimal\" infant weights and lengths at specific ages, while de-emphasizing infant weight gain. Objective of this study was to examine infant growth patterns by measuring infant weight gain relative to birth weight. We conducted this study based on data collected in a prospective cohort study including 3,302 births with follow up examinations of infants between the ages of 8 and 18 months. All infants were participants in the Louisiana State Women, Infant and Children Supplemental Food Program between 1999 and 2001. Growth was assessed by infant weight gain percentage (IWG%, defined as infant weight gain divided by birth weight) as well as by mean z-scores and percentiles for weight-for-age, length-for-age, and weight-for-length calculated based on growth charts published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). An inverse relationship was noted between birth weight category and IWG% (from 613.9% for infants with birth weights <1500 g to 151.3% for infants with birth weights of 4000 g or more). In contrast, low birth weight infants had lower weight-for-age, weight-for-length z-scores and percentiles compared to normal birth weight infants according to CDC growth charts. Although low birth weight infants had lower anthropometric measures compared to a national reference population, they had significant catch-up growth; High birth weight infants had significant slow-down growth. We suggest that growth assessments should compare infants' anthropometric data to their own previous growth measures as well as to a reference population. Further studies are needed to identify optimal ranges of infant weight gain.\n\nA comparison of three infant skinfold reference standards: Tanner-Whitehouse, Cambridge Infant Growth Study, and WHO Child Growth Standards.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiller, Elizabeth M\n\n2015-10-01\n\nAs researchers increasingly focus on early infancy as a critical period of development, there is a greater need for methodological tools that can address all aspects of infant growth. Infant skinfold measures, in particular, are measurements in need of reliable reference standards that encompass all ages of infants and provide an accurate assessment of the relative fatness of a population. This report evaluates three published reference standards for infant skinfold measurements: Tanner-Whitehouse, Cambridge Infant Growth Study, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards. To assess these standards, triceps skinfolds from a population of rural Kenyan infants (nâ=â250) and triceps skinfolds and subscapular skinfolds from infants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 (NHANES; nâ=â1197) were calculated as z-scores from the lambda-mu-sigma curves provided by each reference population. The Tanner-Whitehouse standards represented both the Kenyan and US populations as lean, while the Cambridge standards represented both populations as overfat. The distribution of z-scores based on the WHO standards fell in the middle, but excluded infants from both populations who were below the age of 3 months. Based on these results, the WHO reference standard is the best skinfold reference standard for infants over the age of 3 months. For populations with infants of all ages, the Tanner-Whitehouse standards are recommended, despite representing both study populations as underfat. Ideally, the WHO will extend their reference standard to include infants between the ages of 0 and 3 months.

Sarcopenia is an important risk factor for falls but it is not known whether poor early growth is related to falls. We investigated this in the Hertfordshire Cohort Study where 2148 participants completed a falls history. Grip strength was used as a marker of sarcopenia. Birth weight, weight at one year and conditional infant growth were analysed in relation to falls history. The prevalence of any fall in the last year was 14.3% for men and 22.5% for women. Falls in the last year were inversely related to adult grip strength, height and walking speed in men and women as well as to lower conditional infant growth in men (OR 1.27 [95% CI 1.04, 1.56] per SD decrease in conditional infant growth, p=0.02). This association was attenuated after adjustment for grip strength. Our findings support an association between poor early growth and falls in older men which appears to be mediated partly through sarcopenia. The lack of relationship with birth weight suggests that postnatal rather than prenatal influences on muscle growth and development may be important for risk of falls in later life.

Nutrition is important to promote optimal growth and organ development in order to reduce late neonatal complications. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of early nutritional intakes on growth and risks of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in a high-risk population. This population-based cohort study includes infants born before 27 0/7 weeks of gestational age without severe malformations and surviving â¥10 days. Intake of energy and protein on postnatal days 4-6 and association with weight standard deviation score (WSDS) from birth to day 7, as well as intakes of energy and protein on postnatal days 4-6 and 7 to 27, respectively, and association with composite outcome of death and BPD and separate outcomes of BPD and ROP were examined, and adjusted for potential confounders. The cohort comprised 296 infants with a median gestational age of 25 3/7 weeks. Expressed as daily intakes, every additional 10Â kcal/kg/d of energy during days 4-6 was associated with 0.08 higher WSDS on day 7 (95% CI 0.06-0.11; pÂ <Â 0.001). Between days 7 and 27, every 10Â kcal/kg/d increase in energy intake was associated with a reduced risk of BPD of 9% (95% CI 1-16; pÂ =Â 0.029) and any grade of ROP with a reduced risk of 6% (95% CI 2-9; pÂ =Â 0.005) in multivariable models. This association was statistically significant in infants with â¤10 days of mechanical ventilation. In infants with >10 days of mechanical ventilation, a combined higher intake of energy and protein was associated with a reduced risk of BPD. Early provision of energy and protein may reduce postnatal weight loss and risk of morbidity in extremely preterm infants.

Much effort has therefore been devoted to manipulation of the composition of the microbiota through 1) the role of early infant nutrition, particularly breast milk, and supplementation of infant formula with prebiotics that positively influence the enteric microbiota by selectively promoting growth of beneficial bacteria and 2) oral administration of probiotic bacteria which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. While the complex microbiota of the adult is difficult to change in the long-term, there is greater impact of the diet on infant microbiota as this is not as stable as in adults. Decreasing excessive use of antibiotics and increasing the use of pre- and probiotics have shown to be beneficial in the prevention of several important infant diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis and atopic eczema as well as improvement of short and long-term health. This review addresses how the composition of the gut microbiota becomes established in early life, its relevance to infant health, and dietary means by which it can be manipulated.

Stunting malnutrition (suboptimal linear growth) also has long-term negative effects on childhood development. Linear growth deficits accrue in the first 1000 d of life. Understanding the patterns and timing of linear growth faltering or recovery during this period is critical to inform interventions to improve infant nutritional status. Objective: We aimed to identify the pattern and determinants of linear growth trajectories from birth through 24 mo of age in a cohort of Zimbabwean infants. Design: We performed a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from a subset of 3338 HIV-unexposed infants in the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies trial. We used k-means clustering for longitudinal data to identify linear growth trajectories and multinomial logistic regression to identify covariates that were associated with each trajectory group. Results: For the entire population, the mean length-for-age z score declined from â0.6 to â1.4 between birth and 24 mo of age. Within the population, 4 growth patterns were identified that were each characterized by worsening linear growth restriction but varied in the timing and severity of growth declines. In our multivariable model, 1-U increments in maternal height and education and infant birth weight and length were associated with greater relative odds of membership in the leastâgrowth restricted groups (A and B) and reduced odds of membership in the moreâgrowth restricted groups (C and D). Male infant sex was associated with reduced odds of membership in groups A and B but with increased odds of membership in groups C and D. Conclusion: In this population, all children were experiencing growth restriction but differences in magnitude were influenced by maternal height and education and infant sex, birth weight, and birth length, which suggest that key determinants of linear growth may already be established by the time of birth\n\nEffect of Early Expressed Human Milk on Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 and Short-Term Outcomes in Preterm Infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nSerrao, Francesca; Papacci, Patrizia; Costa, Simonetta; Giannantonio, Carmen; Cota, Francesco; Vento, Giovanni; Romagnoli, Costantino\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPreterm breast milk contains high levels of bioactive components, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), that are reduced by Holder pasteurization. Animal studies have shown that milk-borne IGF-1 is likely absorbed intact in a bioactive form by the intestines. The aim of this study was to assess if early non-pasteurized expressed breast milk nutrition may affect IGF-1 plasma levels in premature infants. We also investigated the possible association between early expressed milk nutrition and short-term outcomes. Fifty-two preterm infants with gestational age < 31 weeks were divided into two groups according to expressed breast milk intake (< or â¥ 50 mL/Kg/day) until 32 weeks of postmenstrual age when blood sampling for IGF-1 analysis was performed. In our population, early expressed breast milk does not affect IGF-1 plasma levels (p 0.48). An association was observed between early expressed milk nutrition and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, feeding intolerance, need for parenteral nutrition and length of hospitalization. Contrary to the results in some animal studies, our results did not seem to show that early expressed breast milk can help to maintain postnatal IGF-1 near foetal levels in preterm infants. The observed protective effect of expressed breast milk on short-term outcomes can be the starting point for further study of the effects of non-pasteurized human milk in preterm infants.\n\nExploring the association between maternal prenatal multivitamin use and early infant growth: The Healthy Start Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSauder, K A; Starling, A P; Shapiro, A L; Kaar, J L; Ringham, B M; Glueck, D H; Dabelea, D\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPrenatal multivitamin supplementation is recommended to improve offspring outcomes, but effects on early infant growth are unknown. We examined whether multivitamin supplementation in the year before delivery predicts offspring mass, body composition and early infant growth. Multivitamin use was assessed longitudinally in 626 women from the Healthy Start Study. Offspring body size and composition was measured with air displacement plethysmography at birth (<3âdays) and postnatally (median 5.2âmonths). Separate multiple linear regressions assessed the relationship of weeks of daily multivitamin use with offspring mass, body composition and postnatal growth, after adjustment for potential confounders (maternal age, race, pre-pregnant body mass index; offspring gestational age at birth, sex; breastfeeding exclusivity). Maternal multivitamin use was not related to offspring mass or body composition at birth, or rate of change in total or fat-free mass in the first 5âmonths. Multivitamin use was inversely associated with average monthly growth in offspring percent fat mass (Î²â=â-0.009, pâ=â0.049) between birth and postnatal exam. Offspring of non-users had a monthly increase in percent fat mass of 3.45%, while offspring at the top quartile of multivitamin users had a monthly increase in percent fat mass of 3.06%. This association was not modified by exclusive breastfeeding. Increased multivitamin use in the pre-conception and prenatal periods was associated with a slower rate of growth in offspring percent fat mass in the first 5âmonths of life. This study provides further evidence that in utero nutrient exposures may affect offspring adiposity beyond birth.

Brain growth from the newborn period to middle childhood has not been explored because longitudinal data have been lacking. To examine the pattern of growth of cerebral tissue volumes from hospital discharge to childhood in VPT infants and to determine perinatal risk factors for impaired brain growth and associations with neurobehavioral outcomes at 7 years. Prospective cohort study of VPT infants (<30 weeks' gestation or <1250 g) born between April 11, 2001, and April 26, 2004, and followed up at 7 years' corrected age. The setting was The Royal Women's Hospital and The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Of 224 VPT infants and 46 full-term (FT) infants, usable magnetic resonance imaging data at either infancy or 7 years were collected for 214 VPT children (95.5%) and 46 FT children (100%), while 126 VPT children (56.3%) and 31 FT children (67.4%) had usable magnetic resonance imaging data at both time points. Follow-up was conducted from April 28, 2008, to August 9, 2011. Our final analysis was on March 3, 2016. Prematurity. Absolute tissue growth, defined as change in absolute tissue volume, between infancy and 7 years was calculated for cortical gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), and subcortical GMV. IQ, language, and motor function were measured at 7 years. The study cohort comprised 260 participants. Their mean (SD) age was 7.5 (0.2) years, and 49.2% (128 of 260) were female. Early GMV deficits in VPT infants were magnified by 7 years, with less growth than FT controls. Growth differences were 31.4 (95% CI, 14.8-48.1) cm3 for cortical GMV and 1.7 (95% CI, 0.5-2.8) cm3 for subcortical GMV. Within the VPT group, greater growth was observed in boys for cortical GMV (31.9; 95% CI, 16.8-46.9 cm3), WMV (31.7; 95% CI, 19.7-43.7 cm3), and subcortical GMV (1.8; 95% CI, 0.8-2.8 cm3).

Guidelines for optimal growth and the nutritional intakes, particular of protein, required to achieve this are not well defined. Due to delays in postnatal feeding and a lack of energy stores developed in the last trimester of pregnancy, preterm infants often suffer early postnatal catabolism until feeding is established. There are indications that infants born with intrauterine growth restriction have perturbations in protein metabolism. Therefore, they may have different protein requirements than appropriate for gestational age infants. This review summarises what is known about protein requirements and metabolism in the fetus and preterm infant, with particular emphasis on the distinct requirements of the growthârestricted infant.

This study investigated the independent effect of maternal perinatal depressive symptoms on infant's growth and motor development in rural Bangladesh. A cohort of 720 pregnant women was followed from the third trimester of pregnancy to 6-8 months postpartum. For growth and developmental outcomes, 652 infants at 2-3 months and 6-8 months were assessed. Explanatory variables comprised maternal depressive symptoms, socioeconomic status, and infant's health and temperament. Outcome measures included infant's underweight, stunting and motor development. Multiple linear regression analyses identified predictors of infant growth and development. Maternal postpartum depressive symptoms independently predicted infant's underweight and impaired motor development, and antepartum depressive symptoms predicted infant's stunting. Infant's unadaptable temperament was inversely associated with infant's weight-for-age and motor development, and fussy and unpredictable temperament with height-for-age and motor development. Repeated measures design might threaten the internal validity of the results 8.3% of the participant does not participate in the measurements at different times. As the study was conducted in two sub-districts of rural Bangladesh, it does not represent the urban scenario and cannot be generalized even for other rural areas of the country. This study provides evidence that maternal ante- and postpartum depressive symptoms predict infant's growth and motor development in rural Bangladesh. It is recommended to integrate psychosocial components in maternal and child health interventions in order to counsel mothers with depressive symptoms. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Heather\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the association of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) use during pregnancy with early growth parameters in HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants. Design US-based prospective cohort study of HEU children to examine potential adverse effects of prenatal TDF exposure. Methods We evaluated the association of maternal TDF use during pregnancy with small for gestational age (SGA); low birth weight (LBW, <2.5kg); weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ), length-forage z-scores (LAZ) and head circumference-for-age (HCAZ) z-scores at newborn visit; and LAZ, HCAZ, and WAZ at age one year. Logistic regression models for LBW and SGA were fit, adjusting for maternal and sociodemographic factors. Adjusted linear regression models were used to evaluate LAZ, WAZ and HCAZ by TDF exposure. Results Of 2029 enrolled children with maternal antiretroviral information, TDF was used by 449 (21%) HIV-infected mothers, increasing from 14% in 2003 to 43% in 2010. There was no difference between those exposed to combination regimens with versus without TDF for SGA, LBW, and newborn LAZ and HCAZ. However, at age one year, infants exposed to combination regimens with TDF had significantly lower adjusted mean LAZ and HCAZ than those without TDF (LAZ: â0.17 vs. â0.03, p=0.04; HCAZ: 0.17 vs. 0.42, p=0.02). Conclusions TDF use during pregnancy was not associated with increased risk for LBW or SGA. The slightly lower mean LAZ and HCAZ observed at age one year in TDF-exposed infants are of uncertain significance but underscore the need for additional studies of growth outcomes after TDF use during pregnancy.

However, preterm infants are at greater risk than term infants. Undernutrition is more common and 'programmed' growth rates are almost six times faster. Thus, even short periods of nutritional deprivation may have significant effects. Recent advances have led to an improvement in early growth but very low birthweight infants remain small for gestational age at hospital discharge. Studies suggest that a 'window of opportunity' exists after hospital discharge, in that better growth between discharge and 2-3 months corrected age is paralleled by better development, and poorer growth is associated with poorer development. However, interventions aimed at improving growth and development have yielded varying results. This may partly be related to differences in study design as well as the composition of the nutrient-enriched formulas. Irrespective, one point is concerning, i.e. infant boys appear to be at a developmental disadvantage when fed a term infant formula after discharge. A single study has also suggested that dietary intervention can improve brain growth in term and preterm infants with perinatal brain injury. However, concern has been expressed about rapid 'catch-up' growth in preterm infants and the development of insulin resistance and visceral adiposity. Data from our group do not support the idea of increased or altered adiposity in preterm infants fed a nutrient-enriched formula after hospital discharge. Copyright (c) 2010 S.

Ultrasound measurements were performed in early, mid-, and late pregnancy. Estimated fetal weight was calculated using head and abdominal circumference and femur length. Infant development was measured with the Minnesota Infant Development Inventory at 12 months (SD 1.1mo, range 10-17mo). Information on postnatal head size and body weight at 7 months was obtained from medical records. After adjusting for potential confounders and for postnatal growth, faster fetal weight gain from mid- to late pregnancy predicted a reduced risk of delayed social development (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.95, p=0.008), self-help abilities (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73-0.98, p=0.023), and overall infant development (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.49-0.87, p=0.003). Similar findings were observed for fetal head growth from mid- to late pregnancy. Faster fetal growth predicts a lower risk of delayed infant development independent of postnatal growth. These results suggest that reduced fetal growth between mid- and late pregnancy may determine subsequent developmental outcomes.\n\nMaternal postnatal psychiatric symptoms and infant temperament affect early mother-infant bonding.\n\nPubMed\n\nNolvi, Saara; Karlsson, Linnea; Bridgett, David J; Pajulo, Marjukka; Tolvanen, Mimmi; Karlsson, Hasse\n\n2016-05-01\n\nPostnatal mother-infant bonding refers to the early emotional bond between mothers and infants. Although some factors, such as maternal mental health, especially postnatal depression, have been considered in relation to mother-infant bonding, few studies have investigated the role of infant temperament traits in early bonding. In this study, the effects of maternal postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and infant temperament traits on mother-infant bonding were examined using both mother and father reports of infant temperament. Data for this study came from the first phase of the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study (n=102, father reports n=62). After controlling for maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety, mother-reported infant positive emotionality, measured by infant smiling was related to better mother-infant bonding. In contrast, infant negative emotionality, measured by infant distress to limitations was related to lower quality of bonding. In regards to father-report infant temperament, only infant distress to limitations (i.e., frustration/anger) was associated with lower quality of mother-infant bonding. These findings underline the importance of infant temperament as one factor contributing to early parent-infant relationships, and counseling parents in understanding and caring for infants with different temperament traits.

METHODS One hundred fifty-four ELBW infants were followed to 20 months corrected age. Growth failure was defined as a decrease in weight z score (standard deviation score) of over 0.67 during one of three periods: between 40 weeks and four months (period I), between four and eight months (period II), and between eight and 20 months corrected age (period III). A decrease in weight z score of this magnitude is comparable to crossing major growth percentiles (eg, from 25th to 10th percentile). Developmental outcomes were assessed at 20 months. RESULTS Growth failure occurred in 8% of infants during period I, 28% during period II and 12% during period III. This resulted in poorer growth attainment and motor function at 20 months. Significant predictors of growth failure included chronic lung disease during periods I and III, and cerebral palsy during period III. Growth failure during period II, while more common, was not associated with specific sequelae of prematurity. It may represent a physiological process comparable to shifts in weight percentiles in term-born infants. CONCLUSIONS Postdischarge growth failure is common among ELBW infants and contributes to poorer growth outcomes. It is associated with poorer motor outcomes when it occurs early after discharge or later in infancy. A decrease in weight z score of over 0.67 can serve as a useful indicator of growth failure in ELBW infants.

A total of 120 preterm infants under 33 weeks' gestation were recruited and divided into 26-29(+6) weeks group (n=64) and 30-32(+6) weeks group (n=56) according to the gestational age. The growth rate of corpus callosum was compared between the two groups. The correlation between the corpus callosum length and the cerebellar vermis length and the relationship of the growth rate of corpus callosum with clinical factors and the neuromotor development were analyzed. The growth rate of corpus callosum in preterm infants declined since 2 weeks after birth. Compared with the 30-32(+6) weeks group, the 26-29(+6) weeks group had a significantly lower growth rate of corpus callosum at 3-4 weeks after birth, at 5-6 weeks after birth, and from 7 weeks after birth to 40 weeks of corrected gestational age. There was a positive linear correlation between the corpus callosum length and the cerebellar vermis length. Small-for-gestational age infants had a low growth rate of corpus callosum at 2 weeks after birth. The 12 preterm infants with severe abnormal intellectual development had a lower growth rate of corpus callosum compared with the 108 preterm infants with non-severe abnormal intellectual development at 3-6 weeks after birth. The 5 preterm infants with severe abnormal motor development had a significantly lower growth rate of corpus callosum compared with the 115 preterm infants with non-severe abnormal motor development at 3-6 weeks after birth. The decline of growth rate of corpus callosum in preterm infants at 2-6 weeks after birth can increase the risk of severe abnormal neuromotor development.\n\nIs the Macronutrient Intake of Formula-Fed Infants Greater Than Breast-Fed Infants in Early Infancy?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHester, Shelly N.; Hustead, Deborah S.; Mackey, Amy D.; Singhal, Atul; Marriage, Barbara J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFaster weight gain early in infancy may contribute to a greater risk of later obesity in formula-fed compared to breast-fed infants. One potential explanation for the difference in weight gain is higher macronutrient intake in formula-fed infants during the first weeks of life. A systematic review was conducted using Medline to assess the macronutrient and energy content plus volume of intake in breast-fed and formula-fed infants in early infancy. All studies from healthy, term, singleton infants reporting values for the composition of breast milk during the first month of life were included. The energy content of colostrum (mean, SEM: 53.6 Â± 2.5âkcal/100âmL), transitional milk (57.7 Â± 4.2âkcal/100âmL), and mature milk (65.2 Â± 1.1âkcal/100âmL) was lower than conventional infant formula (67âkcal/100âmL) on all days analyzed. The protein concentration of colostrum (2.5 Â± 0.2âg/100âmL) and transitional milk (1.7 Â± 0.1âg/100âmL) was higher than formula (1.4âg/100âmL), while the protein content of mature milk (1.3 Â± 0.1âg/100âmL) was slightly lower. Formula-fed infants consume a higher volume and more energy dense milk in early life leading to faster growth which could potentially program a greater risk of long-term obesity.

The current study aimed to: (a) confirm and extend upon previous findings of early generalized overgrowth in ASD; and (b) determine if there were any differences in the rate of growth between infants and toddlers with ASD compared to their TD peers. Measurements of HC, height, and weight were available for 135 boys with ASD and 74 TD boys, from birth through 3 years of age. Size and growth rate in HC, height, and weight were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Infants with ASD were significantly smaller in size at birth for HC, body length, and weight compared to TD infants (all Pâ<â0.05); however, they grew at a significantly faster rate in HC and height in comparison to the TD children (Pâ<â0.001); there was no significant difference between the groups in growth rate for weight (Pâ>â0.05).

The use of early \"aggressive\" parenteral nutrition (PN), with >2.5 g/(kg Â·d) of amino acids and at least 40 kcal/(kg Â·d) of energy from the first day of life, has been shown to provide nutritional intakes in the range recommended by international guidelines, reducing nutritional deficit and the incidence of postnatal growth restriction in preterm infants. However, nutritional practices and adherence to recommendations may vary in different hospitals. Two ready-to-use (RTU), premixed parenteral solutions (PSs) designed for preterm infants have been prospectively evaluated: a binary RTU premixed PS from our hospital pharmacy and a commercially premixed 3-chamber bag (Baxter Healthcare). These premixed PSs provide nitrogen and energy intakes in the range of the most recent recommendations, reducing or eliminating the early cumulative nutritional deficit in very-low-birth-weight infants, and avoiding the development of postnatal growth restriction. A further rationale for RTU premixed PSs is that preterm infants require balanced PN that contains not only amino acids and energy but also minerals and electrolytes from the first day of life in order to reduce the incidence of metabolic disorders frequently reported in extremely-low-birth-weight infants during the early weeks of life.\n\nBreast feeding, infant growth, and body mass index at 30 and 35 years.\n\nPubMed\n\nFergusson, David M; McLeod, Geraldine F H; Horwood, L John\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThis study examined the associations between duration of breast feeding, early infant growth, and body mass index (BMI) at 30 and 35 years, in a birth cohort studied to age 35. Data were gathered on duration of exclusive and non-exclusive breast feeding (months), early growth (kg; 0-9 months), and BMI at ages 30 and 35 from the Christchurch Health and Development Study. The Christchurch Health and Development Study is a study of a birth cohort of 1265 children, born in Christchurch in 1977. Population-averaged generalised estimating regression models showed statistically significant associations between: duration of breast feeding and mean BMI; and early growth and mean BMI. After adjustment for perinatal, family, and social background factors, statistically significant associations were found between: longer duration of breast feeding and lower adult BMI (Bâ=â-0.424 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.708, -0.140]); and increasing early growth and higher adult BMI (Bâ=â0.393 [95% CI 0.080, 0.707]). When breast feeding and infant growth were entered into the regression model and adjusted for covariates, breast feeding was no longer statistically significantly associated with BMI (Bâ=â-0.250 [95% CI -0.553, 0.054]), while early growth remained statistically significantly associated with BMI (Bâ=â0.355 [95% CI 0.039, 0.671]). A test for mediation showed that the association between breast feeding and BMI was mediated by early growth (Pâ=â0.01). The association between longer duration of breast feeding and later lower BMI scores in adulthood was mediated by lower early growth. Breast feeding may be included as one component of multicompartment programmes targeted at early growth and later obesity.

The study subjects were recruited from 60 communities in twelve cities in China. A participating infant's birth weight was measured within the first hour of the infant's life, and birth length and head circumference within 24 hours after birth. Repeated weekly and monthly anthropometric measurements were also taken. Multilevel (ML) modelling via MLwiN2.25 was fitted to estimate the growth curves of weight-for-age (WFA), length-for-age (LFA), and head circumference-for-age (HFA) for the study sample as a whole and by child sex, controlling for mode of delivery, the gravidity and parity of the mother, infant's physical measurements at birth, infant's daily food intaking frequency per day, infant's medical conditions, the season when the infant's physical measurement was taken, parents' ages, heights, and attained education, and family structure and income per month. During the first four weeks after birth, breastfed infants showed an increase in weight, length, and head circumference of 1110g, 4.9 cm, and 3.2 cm, respectively, among boys, and 980 g, 4.4 cm, and 2.8 cm, respectively, among girls. Throughout infancy, the total growth for these three was 6930 g, 26.4 cm, and 12.5 cm, respectively, among boys, and 6480 g, 25.5 cm, and 11.7 cm, respectively, among girls. As expected, there was a significant sex difference in growth during the first year. In comparison with the WHO growth standards, breastfed children in our study were heavier in weight, longer in length, and bigger in head\n\nFeeding preterm infants after hospital discharge: growth and development at 18 months of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nCooke, R J; Embleton, N D; Griffin, I J; Wells, J C; McCormick, K P\n\n2001-05-01\n\nWe have shown that preterm infants fed a preterm formula grow better than those fed a standard term infant formula after hospital discharge. The purpose of this follow-up study was to determine whether improved early growth was associated with later growth and development. Preterm infants (< or =1750 g birth weight, < or =34 wk gestation) were randomized to be fed either a preterm infant formula (discharge to 6 mo corrected age), or a term formula (discharge to 6 mo), or the preterm (discharge to term) and the term formula (term to 6 mo). Anthropometry was performed at 12 wk and 6, 12, and 18 mo. Mental and psychomotor development were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II at 18 mo. Differences in growth observed at 12 wk were maintained at 18 mo. At 18 mo, boys fed the preterm formula were 1.0 kg heavier, 2 cm longer, and had a 1.0 cm greater occipitofrontal circumference than boys fed the term formula. Boys fed the preterm formula were also 600 g heavier and 2 cm longer than girls fed the preterm formula. However, no differences were noted in MDI or PDI between boys fed the preterm formula and boys fed the term formula or between the boys fed preterm formula and girls fed the preterm formula. Overall, boys had significantly lower MDI than girls (mean difference, 6.0; p < 0.01), primarily reflecting lower scores in boys fed the term formula. Thus, early diet has long-term effects on growth but not development at 18 mo of age. Sex remains an important confounding variable when assessing growth and developmental outcome in these high-risk infants.\n\nAccelerated fetal growth in early pregnancy and risk of severe large-for-gestational-age and macrosomic infant: a cohort study in a low-risk population.\n\nPubMed\n\nSimic, Marija; WikstrÃ¶m, Anna-Karin; Stephansson, Olof\n\n2017-10-01\n\nOur objective was to examine the association between fetal growth in early pregnancy and risk of severe large-for-gestational-age (LGA) and macrosomia at birth in a low-risk population. Cohort study that included 68 771 women with non-anomalous singleton pregnancies, without history of diabetes or hypertension, based on an electronic database on pregnancies and deliveries in Stockholm-Gotland Region, Sweden, 2008-2014. We performed multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between accelerated fetal growth occurring in the first through early second trimester as measured by ultrasound and LGA and macrosomia at birth. Restricted analyses were performed in the groups without gestational diabetes and with normal body mass index (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ). When adjusting for confounders, the odds of having a severely LGA or macrosomic infant were elevated in mothers with fetuses that were at least 7 days larger than expected as compared with mothers without age discrepancy at the second-trimester scan (adjusted odds ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.23-2.64 and adjusted odds ratio 2.15; 95% CI 1.55-2.98, respectively). Additionally, mothers without gestational diabetes and mothers with normal weight had an elevated risk of having a severely LGA or macrosomic infant when the age discrepancy by second-trimester ultrasound was at least 7 days. In a low-risk population, ultrasound-estimated accelerated fetal growth in early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of having a severely LGA or macrosomic infant.

These include nutrition, burden of infection and the psycho-social environment. Nutrition in young children is dependent on individual level factors such as fetal experience, infant feeding and weaning practices, and on societal factors such as education of women and economic conditions. The relationship of early postnatal growth to adult disease may be indicative or causal, and may reveal both biological and sociological processes. Although non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity are risk factors for ischaemic heart disease, the relationships of these three conditions to infant growth differ. Poor infant growth has been associated with higher levels of NIDDM and ischaemic heart disease, but lower levels of adult obesity. Most research has been of populations living in developed countries at different stages of nutritional transition. However, differences in context are not simply limited to the stage of the nutritional transition. They also need to consider the nature of that transition and its social correlates, which may result in the clustering of aetiological influences such as increased body mass and poverty. The size of effect of the relationship of infant growth to adult disease is important not only to determine its relative aetiological importance but also for its potential for public health policy. Such policy also needs to consider the relationships of infant growth to a range of outcomes, both health and human capital, which are not the subject of this workshop.\n\nNeurodevelopmental outcome and growth at 18 to 22 months' corrected age in extremely low birth weight infants treated with early erythropoietin and iron.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhls, Robin K; Ehrenkranz, Richard A; Das, Abhik; Dusick, Anna M; Yolton, Kimberly; Romano, Elaine; Delaney-Black, Virginia; Papile, Lu-Ann; Simon, Neal P; Steichen, Jean J; Lee, Kimberly G\n\n2004-11-01\n\nClinical trials evaluating the use of erythropoietin (Epo) have demonstrated a limited reduction in transfusions; however, long-term developmental follow-up data are scarce. We compared anthropometric measurements, postdischarge events, need for transfusions, and developmental outcomes at 18 to 22 months' corrected age in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants treated with early Epo and supplemental iron therapy with that of placebo/control infants treated with supplemental iron alone. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network completed a randomized, controlled trial of early Epo and iron therapy in preterm infants < or =1250 g. A total of 172 ELBW (< or =1000-g birth weight) infants were enrolled (87 Epo and 85 placebo/control). Of the 72 Epo-treated and 70 placebo/control ELBW infants surviving to discharge, follow-up data (growth, development, rehospitalization, transfusions) at 18 to 22 months' corrected age were collected on 51 of 72 Epo-treated infants (71%) and 51 of 70 placebo/controls (73%) by certified examiners masked to the treatment group. Statistical significance was determined using chi2 analysis. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in weight or length or in the percentage of infants weighing <10th percentile either at the time of discharge or at follow-up, and no difference was found in the mean head circumference between groups. A similar percentage of infants in each group was rehospitalized (38% Epo and 35% placebo/control) for similar reasons. There were no differences between groups with respect to the percentage of infants with Bayley-II Mental Developmental Index <70 (34% Epo and 36% placebo/control), blindness (0% Epo and 2% placebo/control), deafness or hearing loss requiring amplification (2% Epo and 2% placebo/control), moderate to severe cerebral palsy (16% Epo and 18% placebo/control) or the percentage of infants with any of the above-described neurodevelopmental\n\nPredictors for early introduction of solid food among Danish mothers and infants: an observational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKronborg, Hanne; Foverskov, Else; VÃ¦th, Michael\n\n2014-10-01\n\nEarly introduction of complementary feeding may interfere with breastfeeding and the infant's self-controlled appetite resulting in increased growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate predictors for early introduction of solid food. In an observational study Danish mothers filled in a self-administered questionnaire approximately six months after birth. The questionnaire included questions about factors related to the infant, the mother, attachment and feeding known to influence time for introduction of solid food. The study population consisted of 4503 infants. Data were analysed using ordered logistic regression models. Outcome variable was time for introduction to solid food. Almost all of the included infants 4386 (97%) initiated breastfeeding. At weeks 16, 17-25, 25+, 330 infants (7%); 2923 (65%); and 1250 (28%), respectively had been introduced to solid food. Full breastfeeding at five weeks was the most influential predictor for later introduction of solid food (OR = 2.52 CI: 1.93-3.28). Among infant factors male gender, increased gestational age at birth, and higher birth weight were found to be statistically significant predictors. Among maternal factors, lower maternal age, higher BMI, and being primipara were significant predictors, and among attachment factors mother's reported perception of the infant as being temperamental, and not recognising early infant cues of hunger were significant predictors for earlier introduction of solid food. Supplementary analyses of interactions between the predictors showed that the association of maternal perceived infant temperament on early introduction was restricted to primiparae, that the mother's pre-pregnancy BMI had no impact if the infant was fully breastfed at week five, and that birth weight was only associated if the mother had reported early uncertainty in recognising infant's cues of hunger. Breastfeeding was the single most powerful indicator for preventing early introduction to solid food\n\nFeeding Practices and Infant Growth: Quantifying the Effects of Breastfeeding Termination and Complementary Food Introduction on BMI z-Score Growth Velocity through Growth Curve Models.\n\nPubMed\n\nHorodynski, Mildred A; Pierce, Steven J; Reyes-Gastelum, David; Olson, Beth; Shattuck, Mackenzie\n\n2017-12-01\n\nInfant feeding practices are a focus of early obesity prevention. We tested whether infant growth velocity increased after breastfeeding termination and complementary food introduction. Our secondary analysis included a sample of 547 mother-infant dyads from a longitudinal randomized controlled trial conducted in Michigan and Colorado. Infant anthropometrics at birth, baseline, and 6- and 12-month follow-up were standardized to BMI-for-age z-score (ZBMI) according to World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts. We used growth curve models with time-varying predictors to quantify effects of breastfeeding termination and timing of complementary food introduction on growth velocity. Median breastfeeding duration was 2.0 months [confidence interval (CI)â=â2.0-2.5]; median introduction of complementary foods occurred at 3.0 months (CIâ=â2.8-3.2). Breastfed infants not yet introduced to complementary foods had an average ZBMI growth velocity of 0.050 (CIâ=â-0.013 to 0.113) z-score units per month [zpm], not significantly faster than WHO growth trajectory (pâ=â0.118) defined as 0âzpm. Breastfeeding termination had negligible effect on ZBMI growth velocity (Î³ 11 â=â0.001, CIâ=â-0.027 to 0.030, pâ=â0.927). Introduction of complementary foods increased ZBMI growth velocity relative to an average child in the sample, but not significantly (Î³ 12 â=â0.033, CIâ=â-0.034 to 0.100, pâ=â0.334). Growth velocities for infants receiving complementary foods both before and after breastfeeding termination were significantly faster than the WHO growth trajectory (0.083âzpm, CIâ=â0.052-0.114, and 0.084âzpm, CIâ=â0.064-0.105, respectively, p'sâ<â0.001). Average postcomplementary food introduction growth velocity was significantly higher than WHO growth trajectory, but did not differ from the sample's initial average trajectory.

We evaluated postdischarge growth patterns and growth failure in 81 Korean VLBW infants through a retrospective study. Weight and height were measured and calculated based on age percentile distribution every 3 months until age 24 months. Growth failure was defined as weight and height below the 10th percentile at 24 months. For the subgroup analysis, small-for-gestational age (SGA) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants were evaluated. The growth patterns based on the Korean, World Health Organization (WHO), or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standard were serially compared over time. At postconception age (PCA) 40 weeks, 47 (58%) and 45 infants (55%) showed growth failure in terms of weight and height, respectively. At PCA 24 months, 20 infants (24%) showed growth failure for weight and 14 (18%) for height. Growth failure rates were higher for the SGA infants than for the appropriate-weight-for-gestational age infants at PCA 24 months ( P =0.045 for weight and P =0.038 for height). Growth failure rates were higher for the ELBW infants than for the non-ELBW infants at PCA 24 months ( P <0.001 for weight and P =0.003 for height). Significant differences were found among the WHO, CDC, and Korean standards ( P <0.001). Advancements in neonatal care have improved the catch-up growth of VLBW infants, but this is insufficient. Careful observation and aggressive interventions, especially in SGA and ELBW infants, are needed.\n\nAflatoxin exposure in utero causes growth faltering in Gambian infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nTurner, Paul C; Collinson, Andrew C; Cheung, Yin Bun; Gong, Yunyun; Hall, Andrew J; Prentice, Andrew M; Wild, Christopher P\n\n2007-10-01\n\nGrowth faltering in West African children has previously been associated with dietary exposure to aflatoxins, particularly upon weaning. However, in animal studies in utero exposure to low levels of aflatoxin also results in growth faltering. This study investigated the effect of in utero aflatoxin exposure on infant growth in the first year of life in The Gambia. Height and weight were measured for 138 infants at birth and at regular monthly intervals for one year. Aflatoxin-albumin (AF-alb) adduct level was measured in maternal blood during pregnancy, in cord blood and in infants at age 16 weeks. The geometric mean AF-alb levels were 40.4 pg/mg (range 4.8-260.8 pg/mg), 10.1 pg/mg (range 5.0-189.6 pg/mg) and 8.7 pg/mg (range 5.0-30.2 pg/mg) in maternal, cord and infant blood, respectively. AF-alb in maternal blood was a strong predictor of both weight (P = 0.012) and height (P = 0.044) gain, with lower gain in those with higher exposure. A reduction of maternal AF-alb from 110 pg/mg to 10 pg/mg would lead to a 0.8 kg increase in weight and 2 cm increase in height within the first year of life. This study shows a strong effect of maternal aflatoxin exposure during pregnancy on growth in the first year of life and thus extends earlier observations of an association between aflatoxin exposure during infancy and growth faltering. The findings imply value in targeting intervention strategies at early life exposures.\n\nWeight centile crossing in infancy: correlations between successive months show evidence of growth feedback and an infant-child growth transition.\n\nPubMed\n\nCole, Tim J; Singhal, Atul; Fewtrell, Mary S; Wells, Jonathan Ck\n\n2016-10-01\n\nEarly rapid weight gain is associated with later overweight, which implies that weight centile crossing tracks over time. Centile crossing is defined in terms of the change or deviation in weight z score during 1 mo, and the correlations between successive deviations are explored at different ages. Two Cambridge (United Kingdom) growth cohorts were used: Widdowson (1094 infants born during 1959-1965) and the Cambridge Infant Growth Study (CIGS; 255 infants born during 1984-1987), each with weights measured monthly in the first year. Weights were converted to WHO age- and sex-adjusted z scores, deviations were calculated as the change in z score between adjacent measurement occasions, and the correlations between deviations were studied. In both cohorts, the correlations between successive monthly deviations were positive in the first 6 mo and highest at ages 3-4 mo (r = 0.3, P < 0.0001), whereas after 6 mo they were negative and were lowest at ages 10-11 mo (r = -0.3, P < 0.0001), with the correlation decreasing linearly with age between these extremes. Thus, during the first 6 mo of age, infants crossing centiles in 1 mo tended to continue crossing centiles in the same direction the following month, whereas after 6 mo they tended to cross back again. This represents positive and negative feedback, respectively. At age 12 mo, the correlation was close to zero, which suggests an infant-child transition in growth. The results confirm that weight centile crossing tracks over time, with the correlations between successive periods that change with age suggesting a complex feedback mechanism underlying infant growth. This may throw light on the link between early rapid weight gain and later overweight. Clinically, the correlations indicate that when predicting future weight from current weight, recent centile crossing affects the prediction in an age-dependent manner.\n\nImplementation of a Nutrition Program Reduced Post-Discharge Growth Restriction in Thai Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nJapakasetr, Suchada; Sirikulchayanonta, Chutima; Suthutvoravut, Umaporn; Chindavijak, Busba; Kagawa, Masaharu; Nokdee, Somjai\n\n2016-12-17\n\nVery low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants are vulnerable to growth restriction after discharge due to cumulative protein and energy deficits during their hospital stay and early post-discharge period. The current study evaluated the effectiveness of the preterm infant, post-discharge nutrition (PIN) program to reduce post-discharge growth restriction in Thai VLBW preterm infants. A prospective, non-randomized interventional cohort study was undertaken to assess the growth of 22 VLBW preterm infants who received the PIN program and compared them with 22 VLBW preterm infants who received conventional nutrition services. Infant's growth was recorded monthly until the infants reached six months' corrected age (6-moCA). Intervention infants had significantly greater body weights ( p = 0.013) and head circumferences ( p = 0.009). Also, a greater proportion of the intervention group recovered their weight to the standard weight at 4-moCA ( p = 0.027) and at 6-moCA ( p = 0.007) and their head circumference to the standard head circumference at 6-moCA ( p = 0.004) compared to their historical comparison counterparts. Enlistment in the PIN program thus resulted in significantly reduced post-discharge growth restriction in VLBW preterm infants. Further research on longer term effects of the program on infant's growth and development is warranted.\n\nInfant Growth Trajectories from Birth to 12 Months of Age: Findings from Delta Healthy Sprouts Comparative Impact Trial\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nDelta Healthy Sprouts was designed to test the comparative impact of two maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting curricula on weight status, infant growth, and other health behaviors of women and their infants residing in the United Statesâ Lower Mississippi Delta region.

Recent research suggests that early NICU-related stress contributes to socio-emotional impairments in VPT infants at 3 months through epigenetic regulation (i.e., DNA methylation) of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). In the present longitudinal study we assessed: (a) the effects of NICU-related stress and SLC6A4 methylation variations from birth to discharge on brain development at term equivalent age (TEA); (b) the association between brain volume at TEA and socio-emotional development (i.e., Personal-Social scale of Griffith Mental Development Scales, GMDS) at 12 months corrected age (CA). Twenty-four infants had complete data at 12-month-age. SLC6A4 methylation was measured at a specific CpG previously associated with NICU-related stress and socio-emotional stress. Findings confirmed that higher NICU-related stress associated with greater increase of SLC6A4 methylation at NICU discharge. Moreover, higher SLC6A4 discharge methylation was associated with reduced anterior temporal lobe (ATL) volume at TEA, which in turn was significantly associated with less-than-optimal GMDS Personal-Social scale score at 12 months CA. The reduced ATL volume at TEA mediated the pathway linking stress-related increase in SLC6A4 methylation at NICU discharge and socio-emotional development at 12 months CA. These findings suggest that early adversity-related epigenetic changes might contribute to the long-lasting programming of socio-emotional development in VPT infants through epigenetic regulation and structural modifications of the developing brain.\n\nEffect of early nutritional intake on long-term growth and bone mineralization of former very low birth weight infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nChristmann, V; van der Putten, M E; Rodwell, L; Steiner, K; Gotthardt, M; van Goudoever, J B; van Heijst, A F J\n\n2018-03-01\n\nPreterm infants are at risk for impaired bone mineralization and growth in length later in life due to inadequate nutritional intake in the early postnatal period. To investigate whether increased nutritional supplementation of calcium, phosphate and protein in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants during the first 14days after birth was associated with improvement in length and bone development until 9-10years of age. Observational follow-up study of VLBW infants (birth weight<1500g or gestational age<32weeks) born in two consecutive years (eligible infants: 2004 n: 63 and 2005: n: 66). Cohort 2005 received higher intake of calcium, phosphate and protein with parenteral nutrition compared to Cohort 2004. Anthropometric data were collected during standard follow-up visits until five years, and additionally at 9-10years of age including measurements of bone mineral content, bone mineral density of the whole body and lumbar spine determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Long-term growth trajectories of both cohorts were evaluated separately for participants born appropriate (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA), stratified by gender. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the effect of nutritional intake and clinical covariates on length and bone mineralization. Both cohorts achieved a catch-up in length to SDS within the normal range by 6months (length SDS: estimated mean (95% confidence interval (CI): 6months: Cohort 2004: -0.7 (-1.1, -0.3) Cohort 2005: -0.5 (-0.8, -0.2)). Bone mineral content and density were within the normal range and not different between the cohorts. SGA children achieved a catch-up in length at 5years with bone mineralization comparable to AGA children. Only for girls birth weight was significantly associated with length SDS (per gram: Î² 0.001; 95% CI (0.000, 0.003); p=0.03) There was no evidence of an association between early nutritional intake and bone mineralization.

Whether these benefits extend to mental health remains largely unknown. We examined if faster growth in infancy is associated with better self-reported mental health in young adults born preterm at very low birth weight (VLBW) (< 1500 g). As young adults, participants of the Helsinki Study of Very Low Birth Weight Adults self-reported symptoms of depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 157) and other psychiatric problems (n = 104). As main predictors of mental health outcomes in linear regression models, we used infant weight, length, and head circumference at birth, term, and 12 months of corrected age, and growth between these time points. Growth data were collected from records and measures at term and at 12 months of corrected age were interpolated. Additionally, we examined the moderating effects of intrauterine growth restriction. Size at birth, term, or 12 months of corrected age, or growth between these time points were not associated with mental health outcomes (p-values >0.05). Intrauterine growth restriction did not systematically moderate any associations. Despite the high variability in early growth of VLBW infants, the previously described association between slow growth in infancy and poorer cognitive functioning in later life is not reflected in symptoms of depression, ADHD, and other psychiatric problems. This suggests that the development of cognitive and psychiatric problems may have dissimilar critical periods in VLBW infants.\n\nInfant Growth after Preterm Birth and Mental Health in Young Adulthood\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSammallahti, Sara; Lahti, Marius; PyhÃ¤lÃ¤, Riikka; Lahti, Jari; Pesonen, Anu-Katriina; Heinonen, Kati; Hovi, Petteri; Eriksson, Johan G.; Strang-Karlsson, Sonja; JÃ¤rvenpÃ¤Ã¤, Anna-Liisa; Andersson, Sture; Kajantie, Eero; RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen, Katri\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjectives Faster growth after preterm birth benefits long-term cognitive functioning. Whether these benefits extend to mental health remains largely unknown. We examined if faster growth in infancy is associated with better self-reported mental health in young adults born preterm at very low birth weight (VLBW) (<1500g). Study Design As young adults, participants of the Helsinki Study of Very Low Birth Weight Adults self-reported symptoms of depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 157) and other psychiatric problems (n = 104). As main predictors of mental health outcomes in linear regression models, we used infant weight, length, and head circumference at birth, term, and 12 months of corrected age, and growth between these time points. Growth data were collected from records and measures at term and at 12 months of corrected age were interpolated. Additionally, we examined the moderating effects of intrauterine growth restriction. Results Size at birth, term, or 12 months of corrected age, or growth between these time points were not associated with mental health outcomes (p-values >0.05). Intrauterine growth restriction did not systematically moderate any associations. Conclusions Despite the high variability in early growth of VLBW infants, the previously described association between slow growth in infancy and poorer cognitive functioning in later life is not reflected in symptoms of depression, ADHD, and other psychiatric problems. This suggests that the development of cognitive and psychiatric problems may have dissimilar critical periods in VLBW infants.

This study focused on the effect of maternal hypothyroxinemia during early pregnancy on growth of the fetal and infant head. In a population-based birth cohort, we assessed thyroid status in early pregnancy (median 13.4, 90% range 10.8-17.2), in 4894 women, and measured the prenatal and postnatal head size of their children at 5 time points. Hypothyroxinemia was defined as normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and free thyroxine-4 concentrations below the 10th percentile. Statistical analysis was performed using linear generalized estimating equation. Maternal hypothyroxinemia was associated with larger fetal and infant head size (overall estimate Î²: 1.38, 95% confidence interval 0.56; 2.19, P = .001). In conclusion, in the general population, even small variations in maternal thyroid function during pregnancy may affect the developing head of the young child.\n\nInfant Responsiveness, Alertness, Hemoglobin and Growth in Rural Sidama, Ethiopia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAubuchon-Endsley, Nicki L.; Grant, Stephanie L.; Thomas, David G.; Kennedy, Tay S.; Berhanu, Getenesh; Stoecker, Barbara J.; Hubbs-Tait, Laura; Hambidge, K. Michael\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSeveral recent studies have supported relations between infant behavior (alertness and responsiveness) and nutrition (e.g. Dempsey 2008, Wachs et al 2005) in addition to investigating infant behavior within the context of changes in iron status over time (e.g. Black et al. 2004, Murray-Kolb & Beard 2009). Existing research is typically limited to investigation of the effects of a single vitamin or mineral and no studies have been found that examined the influence that early alertness and responsiveness have on growth in early infancy, despite the fact "
