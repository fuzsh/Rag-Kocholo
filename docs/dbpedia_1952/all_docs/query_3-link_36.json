Lewis R. First, Editor-in-Chief, <strong>Pediatric</strong>s, Professor and Chair, Department of <strong>Pediatric</strong>s, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, VT With increasing pressures to learn the knowledge, skills, and other competencies required for fellowship training, teaching of medical students and residents has the tendency to become less of a priority at this level of training. Yet fellows are frequently called upon to teach trainees in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Effective, efficient, and innovative teaching strategies are needed, and this workshop will provide attendees with such strategies. A variety of teaching techniques including the use of “trigger” videotapes, live demonstrations and discussion will be used to highlight key take-home concepts that are designed to improve the teaching skills of participants. 4:15 Break 4:30 Recognizing Common Biostatistical Errors in the Literature Thomas B. Newman, University of California, San Francisco, CA This will be an abbreviated and/or accelerated version of the workshop of the same name I have co-led at PAS for many years. The errors covered will depend partly on the interests of the group. They may include standard error vs. standard deviation, nonindependence, use of paired measurements, meaning of P-values, confidence intervals and effect sizes, risk ratios, and odds ratios. Designed to meet elements of the core curriculum for pediatric fellowship subspecialty training. 6:00pm–9:00pm 0600 APA New Century Scholars Dinner Sheraton Downtown, Windows 7:00pm–9:00pm 0900A PES President’s Poster Reception Sheraton Downtown, Plaza Ballroom A/B Saturday, April 30 7:00am–7:45am 1020 APA Young Investigator Awardee Breakfast Sheraton Downtown, Governors Square 11 7:00am–8:00am 1030A Interpretation of Genetic Tests PES Workshop~Room 205 Target Audience: <strong>Pediatric</strong>ians, subspecialists, geneticists.
