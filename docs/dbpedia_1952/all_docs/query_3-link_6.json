However, a lack of bioactivity and binding ability to natural bone tissue has significantly limited PEEK for many challenging dental implant applications. In this work, nanocomposites based on PEEK reinforced with bioactive silicate-based bioceramics (forsterite or bioglass) as nanofillers were prepared using high energy ball milling followed by melt blending and compression molding. The influence of nanofillers type and content (10, 20 and 30 wt.%) on the crystalline structure, morphology, surface roughness, hydrophilicity, microhardness, elastic compression modulus, and flexural strength of the nanocomposites was investigated. The scanning electron microscopy images of the nanocomposites with low nanofillers content showed a homogenous surface with uniform dispersion within the PEEK matrix with no agglomerates. All nanocomposites showed an increased surface roughness compared to pristine PEEK. It was found that the incorporation of 20 wt.% forsterite was the most effective in the nanocomposite formulation compared with bioglass-based nanocomposites; it has significantly improved the elastic modulus, flexural strength, and microhardness. In vitro bioactivity evaluation, which used biomimetic simulated body fluid indicated the ability of PEEK nanocomposites loaded with forsterite or bioglass nanofillers to precipitate calcium and phosphate bone minerals on its surface. These nanocomposites are expected to be used in long-term load-bearing implant applications and could be recommended as a promising alternative to titanium and zirconia when used as a dental implant material.

Essentially, multi-gate filling involves a sequential valve gate system, which helps to spread the filling front with fewer weld lines. Based on the presetting of the sequential scheme of the valve gates, actual measurements of pallet flatness using the ATOS scan system were compared to numerical warpage measurements of a pallet derived by Moldex3D 2020. In this study, we propose a sequential scheme by actuating the valve gates to open once the flow front spreads towards them; then, actual warpage measurements of a pallet are compared with numerical measurements. The results show that the warpage of the top surface of the pallet is 5.144 mm in actual measurements and 5.729 mm in simulation. The results all indicated small warpage with respect to the pallet size. The simulation and actual measurements of flatness are in excellent agreement; the difference in top flatness between the simulated and actual pallet is 0.59 mm, while the bottom flatness difference is 0.035 mm. By adjusting the cooling water temperature, increasing the mold temperature, and decreasing the material temperature, overall flatness and warpage displacement can be reduced.

The as-prepared fillers were incorporated with polypropylene (PP) as a polymer matrix through a twin-screw extruder. From surface morphology analysis, the agglomeration of the silica/CNF hybrid fillers was prevented in the PP matrix and they exhibited moderate transparency, around 17.9% and 44.6% T at 660 nm. Further, the chemical structures of the polymer composites were identified by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis. According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the insertion of silica as a co-filler to the PP matrix resulted in an increase in its degradation onset temperature and also thermal stability. In addition, the mechanical properties of the PP composites also increased after the blending process with the hybrid fillers. Overall, sample PP-SS/CNF exhibited the highest tensile strength, which was 36.8 MPa, or around 73.55% compared to the pristine PP. The improvements in tensile strength were attributed to good dispersion and enhanced efficiency of the stress transfer mechanism between the silica and the cellulose within the PP matrix. However, elongation of the sample was reduced sharply due to the stiffening effect of the filler.

Compared with anthocyanins from other natural sources, red cabbage anthocyanins (RCAs) are of great interest in food packaging because they represent an acceptable color spectrum over a broad range of pH values. The current review addressed the recent advances in the application of RCAs in smart bio-based food packaging systems and sensors. This review was prepared based on the scientific reports found on Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from February 2000 to February 2022. The studies showed that the incorporation of RCAs in different biopolymeric films could affect their physical, mechanical, thermal, and structural properties. Moreover, the use of RCAs as colorimetric pH-responsive agents can reliably monitor the qualitative properties of the packaged food products in a real-time assessment. Therefore, the development of smart biodegradable films using RCAs is a promising approach to the prospect of food packaging.

However, traditional PDMS foam materials usually present poor chemical resistance and easily swell in various solvents, which greatly limits their potential application. Herein, novel fluorosilicone rubber foam (FSiRF) materials with different contents of trifluoropropyl lateral groups were designed and fabricated by a green (no solvents used) and rapid (<10 min foaming process) foaming/crosslinking approach at ambient temperature. Typically, vinyl-terminated poly(dimethyl-co-methyltrifluoropropyl) siloxanes with different fluorine contents of 0–50 mol% were obtained through ring-opening polymerization to effectively adjust the chemical resistance of the FSiRFs. Notably, the optimized FSiRF samples exhibit lightweight (~0.25 g/cm−3), excellent hydrophobicity/oleophilicity (WCA > 120°), reliable mechanical flexibility (complete recovery ability after stretching of 130% strain or compressing of >60%), and improved chemical resistance and structural stability in various solvents, making them promising candidates for efficient and continuous oil–water separation. This work provides an innovative concept to design and prepare advanced fluorosilicone rubber foam materials with excellent chemical resistance for potential oil–water separation application.

Bone-related injuries affect both physical and mental health and increase the morbidity rate. Biopolymers, metals, ceramics, and various biomaterials have been used to synthesize bone implants. Among these, bioactive glasses are one of the most biomimetic materials for human bones. They provide good mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and osteointegrative properties. Owing to these properties, various composites of bioactive glasses have been FDA-approved for diverse bone-related and other applications. However, bone defects and bone injuries require customized designs and replacements. Thus, the three-dimensional (3D) printing of bioactive glass composites has the potential to provide customized bone implants. This review highlights the bottlenecks in 3D printing bioactive glass and provides an overview of different types of 3D printing methods for bioactive glass. Furthermore, this review discusses synthetic and natural bioactive glass composites. This review aims to provide information on bioactive glass biomaterials and their potential in bone tissue engineering.

In this context, substantial research efforts have been made to promote the use of biodegradable films as sustainable alternatives to conventionally used packaging materials. Among several biopolymers, poly(lactide) (PLA) has found early application in the food industry thanks to its promising properties and is currently one of the most industrially produced bioplastics. However, more efforts are needed to enhance its performance and expand its applicability in this field, as packaging materials need to meet precise functional requirements such as suitable thermal, mechanical, and gas barrier properties. In particular, improving the mass transfer properties of materials to water vapor, oxygen, and/or carbon dioxide plays a very important role in maintaining food quality and safety, as the rate of typical food degradation reactions (i.e., oxidation, microbial development, and physical reactions) can be greatly reduced. Since most reviews dealing with the properties of PLA have mainly focused on strategies to improve its thermal and mechanical properties, this work aims to review relevant strategies to tailor the barrier properties of PLA-based materials, with the ultimate goal of providing a general guide for the design of PLA-based packaging materials with the desired mass transfer properties.

This work aims to develop new hydrophobic composite membranes with active ethylene carriers and to demonstrate their potential for ethylene/ethane separation in gas-liquid membrane contactors. For the first time, hybrid membrane materials based on polyoctylmethylsiloxane (POMS) and silver tetrafluoroborate, with a Si:Ag ratio of 10:0.11 and 10:2.2, have been obtained. This technique allowed us to obtain POMS-based membranes with silver nanoparticles (8 nm), which are dispersed in the polymer matrix. The dispersion of silver in the POMS matrix is confirmed by the data IR-spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence analyses. These membranes combine the hydrophobicity of POMS and the selectivity of silver ions toward ethylene. It was shown that ethylene sorption at 600 mbar rises from 0.89 cm3(STP)/g to 3.212 cm3(STP)/g with an increase of Ag content in POMS from 0 to 9 wt%. Moreover, the membrane acquires an increased sorption affinity for ethylene. The ethylene/ethane sorption selectivity of POMS is 0.64; for the membrane with 9 wt% silver nanoparticles, the ethylene/ethane sorption selectivity was 2.46. Based on the hybrid material, POMS-Ag, composite membranes were developed on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) porous support, with a selective layer thickness of 5–10 µm. The transport properties of the membranes were studied by separating a binary mixture of ethylene/ethane at 20/80% vol. It has been shown that the addition of silver nanoparticles to the POMS matrix leads to a decrease in the ethylene permeability, but ethylene/ethane selectivity increases from 0.9 (POMS) to 1.3 (9 wt% Ag). It was noted that when the POMS-Ag membrane is exposed to the gas mixture flow for 3 h, the selectivity increases to 1.3 (0.5 wt% Ag) and 2.3 (9 wt% Ag) due to an increase in ethylene permeability. Testing of the obtained membranes in a gas-liquid contactor showed that the introduction of silver into the POMS matrix makes it possible to intensify the process of ethylene mass transfer by more than 1.5 times.

Following this principle, actuator beams composed of thin veneers out of normal and compression wood cut from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were prepared by using two types of adhesives. The mismatch of the swelling properties of the two layers in tight combination resulted in an expressed bending deflection in response to set humidity changes. The resulting curvatures were measured and analyzed by the Timoshenko bi-metal-model, as well as with an enhanced three-layer model, with the latter also considering the mechanical influence of the glueline on the actuator bending. The thermally induced strain in the original model was replaced by another strain due to moisture changes. The strain was modelled as a function of wood density, along with changes in wood moisture. Experiments with free movement of the bilayer to measure curvature, and with constraints to determine forces, were performed as well. Deformation and magnitude of actuators movements were in close agreement with the enhanced bilayer-model for the phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde adhesive, which deviated substantially from the casein adhesive glued actuators. The obtained results are seen as critical for wood-based actuator systems that are potentially used in buildings or other applications.

Mutations have been reported in first- and second-line drug targets, causing resistance. However, pncB1 and pncB2 mutational data are not available, and neither of their mutation effects have been investigated in protein structures. The current study has been designed to investigate mutations and also their effects on pncB1 and pncB2 structures. A total of 287 whole-genome sequenced data of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan were retrieved (BioSample PRJEB32684, ERR2510337-ERR2510445, ERR2510546-ERR2510645) from NCBI. The genomic data were analyzed for pncB1 and pncB2 mutations using PhyResSE. All the samples harbored numerous synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in pncB1 and pncB2 except one. Mutations Pro447Ser, Arg286Arg, Gly127Ser, and delTCAGGCCG1499213>1499220 in pncB1 are novel and have not been reported in literature and TB databases. The most common non-synonymous mutations exhibited stabilizing effects on the pncB1 structure. Moreover, 36 out of 287 samples harbored two non-synonymous and 34 synonymous mutations in pncB2 among which the most common was Phe204Phe (TTT/TTC), present in 8 samples, which may have an important effect on the usage of specific codons that may increase the gene expression level or protein folding effect. Mutations Ser120Leu and Pro447Ser, which are present in the loop region, exhibited a gain in flexibility in the surrounding residues while Gly429Ala and Gly127Ser also demonstrated stabilizing effects on the protein structure. Inhibitors designed based on the most common pncB1 and pncB2 mutants may be a more useful strategy in high-burden countries. More studies are needed to elucidate the effect of synonymous mutations on organism phenotype.

Our ultimate goal is to define the molecular characteristics of the polyolefinic structural layer that improve compatibility with the tie layer during mechanical recycling. We have investigated the melting temperature depression of single crystals of various polyethylenes embedded in commercial polymeric matrices with various functionalities (ester, acrylate, acetate and methacrylic acid sodium ionomer), which can be potentially used as tie layers. We demonstrate how the concentration and molecular architecture of the matrices affect the melting temperature of the embedded single crystals differently depending on the latter’s molecular architecture. The main finding indicates that the tie layers are more compatible with linear polyethylene than with branched polyethylenes. Indeed, our results show that the heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta linear low-density polyethylene is incompatible with all of the tie layers tested. The depression of melting temperatures observed are in excellent agreement with the results obtained by investigating the rheological behaviour and morphological features of solution-mixed blends in which segmental interactions between polymeric chains have been, in theory, maximized. Because Ziegler–Natta linear density polyethylene is one of the most commonly used polymers as a structural layer in multi-layer applications, the findings of this study are useful as they clearly show the unsuitability of this type of polyethylene for recycling from an eco-design standpoint. The specific molecular requirements for polyethylene layers (branching content less than 0.5/100 carbon atoms) can be specified for use in packaging, guiding the eco-design and valorisation of recycled multi-layered films containing this material.

In addition to direct carbonization, attention has recently been paid to the preparation of porous carbons from liquid cellulose-based precursors. Possible pathways of cellulose conversion to a liquid state suitable for the preparation of porous carbons are summarized in this review. Hydrothermal liquefaction leading to liquid mixtures of low-molecular-weight organics is described in detail together with less common decomposition techniques (microwave or ultrasound assisted liquefaction, decomposition in a strong gravitation field). We also focus on dissolution of cellulose without decomposition, with special attention paid to dissolution of nonderivatized cellulose. For this purpose, cold alkalines, hot acids, ionic liquids, or alcohols are commonly used.

Thus, the fields of application of epoxy–clay nanocomposites along with their hybrid glass/carbon fibre reinforced composites have grown tremendously during the last few decades. The present review paper covers the research work performed on epoxy clay nanocomposites. It includes the influence of the processing techniques and parameters on the morphology of the nanocomposite, the methods of characterization and the effects of adding nanoclay on the mechanical and physical properties of composite. The improvements in the liquid barrier properties brought about by the addition of nanoclay platelets to epoxy resin are discussed. The variation of physical and mechanical properties with nanoclay type and content are reviewed along with the effects of moisture uptake on these properties. The advances in the development, characterization and applications of hybrid glass fibre reinforced epoxy–clay nanocomposites are discussed. Findings of the research work on the influence of nanoclay addition and exposure to water laden atmospheres on the behaviour of the hybrid glass fibre epoxy–nanoclay composites are presented.

The weight ratios of chitosan: PVA in the blends were 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 to produce three hydrogels symbolized as H13, H11, and H31, respectively. For a comparison, H10 was also prepared by crosslinking pure chitosan with trimellitic anhydride isothiocyanate. For further modification, three H31/silver nanocomposites (AgNPs) were synthesized using three different concentrations of silver nitrate to obtain H31/AgNPs1%, H31/AgNPs3% and H31/AgNPs5%. The structures of the prepared samples were emphasized using various analytical techniques. PVA has no inhibition activity against the tested microbes and biofilms. The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm formation activities of the investigated samples was arranged as: H31/AgNPs5% ≥ H31/AgNPs3% > H31/AgNPs1% > H10 > H31 > H11 > H13 > chitosan. H31/AgNPs5% and H31/AgNPs3% were more potent than Vancomycin and Amphotericin B against most of the tested microbes. Interestingly, H31 and H31/AgNPs3% were safe on the normal human cells. Consequently, hydrogels resulting from crosslinked blends of chitosan and PVA loaded with AgNPs in the same structure have significantly reinforced the antimicrobial and inhibition activity against the biofilms of PVA.

A new approach was developed using a cold plasma treatment to incorporate MFEO to improve the optical, physical, and bacterial inhibition properties of the film. The MFEO was added as coarse emulsion (CE), nanoemulsion (NE), and Pickering emulsion (PE) at different concentrations. The PE significantly affected (p < 0.05) the optical, physical, and chemical properties compared with CE and NE films. The addition of MFEO to low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film significantly reduced water vapor permeability (WVP) and oxygen permeability (OP) and showed marked activity against E. coli and S. aureus (p < 0.05). The release rate of PE films after 30 h was 70% lower than that of CE and NE films. Thus, it can be concluded that the fabrication of active packaging containing MFEO is a potential food packaging material.

In VRFB, polymer membranes play a significant role in transporting protons for current transmission and act as barriers between positive and negative electrodes/electrolytes. Commercial polymer membranes (such as Nafion) are the widely used IEM in VRFBs due to their outstanding chemical stability and proton conductivity. However, the membrane cost and increased vanadium ions permeability limit its commercial application. Therefore, various modified perfluorinated and non-perfluorinated membranes have been developed. This comprehensive review primarily focuses on recent developments of hybrid polymer composite membranes with inorganic TiO2 nanofillers for VRFB applications. Hence, various fabrications are performed in the membrane with TiO2 to alter their physicochemical properties for attaining perfect IEM. Additionally, embedding the -SO3H groups by sulfonation on the nanofiller surface enhances membrane proton conductivity and mechanical strength. Incorporating TiO2 and modified TiO2 (sTiO2, and organic silica modified TiO2) into Nafion and other non-perfluorinated membranes (sPEEK and sPI) has effectively influenced the polymer membrane properties for better VRFB performances. This review provides an overall spotlight on the impact of TiO2-based nanofillers in polymer matrix for VRFB applications.

To improve the flame retardant effectiveness of Mg-Al LDH in polyethylene (PE), 2-carboxy ethyl (phenyl) phosphinic acid (CEPPA) was adopted as a flame retardant modifier to prepare CEPPA-intercalated LDH (CLDH) by the regeneration method, which was then exfoliated in PE by melt blending in the form of a masterbatch prepared from solution mixing. By compounding CLDH with intumescent flame retardant (IFR) composed of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER), the thermal degradation and combustion behaviors of the flame retardant PE-based composites were investigated to reveal the flame retardant mechanism between CLDH and IFR in PE. The reactions between CLDH and IFR were revealed to make a predominant contribution to the compact and fully developed char of PE/IFR/CLDH, which enhanced the flame retardancy of the composites.

Herein, we constructed a solvent-tuned aggregated PFO film with the aim of retarding the material’s thermal degradation behavior which causes a significant decline in optical properties as a result of phase transformation. The tuning of the aggregate amount and distribution was executed by applying a poor alcohol-based solvent in chloroform. It emerges that at a lower boiling point methanol evaporates quickly, limiting the aggregate propagation in the film which gives rise to a more transparent film. Furthermore, because of the modulated β-phase conformation, the absorption spectra of PFO films were red-shifted and broadened. The increase in methanol percentage also led to a rise in β-phase percentage. As for the thermal degradation reactions, both pristine and aggregated PFO films exhibited apparent changes in the UV-Vis spectra and PL spectra. In addition, a 97:3 (chloroform:methanol) aggregated PFO film showed a more defined emission spectrum, which demonstrates that the existence of β-phase is able to suppress the unwanted green emission.

The samples were subjected to water aging at a temperature of 80 °C, and in an aqueous ionic solution of CuSO4 at room temperature. The diffusion coefficient results indicated that the ion migration was not at the same rate in the aging conditions. The diffusion coefficient–D–of the sample immersed in an aqueous CuSO4 solution was lower than the hydrothermally aged specimens. The hydrophobicity of aged specimens decreased considerably compared to unaged samples. The distribution of trapped charges was quantitatively characterized. The presence of shallow trap energy states were observed in unaged XLPE, whereas the deep trap sites were noticed in aged specimens. In addition, the charge trap characteristics were different for positive and negative charge deposition. Various material characterization techniques, viz. dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), tensile, contact angle, and LIBS, were further employed on the aged and virgin specimens. The tensile behavior of the hydrothermally aged specimen was degraded due to the oxidised regions, which had formed a weak spot against the mechanical stress. Reduced glass transition temperature and increased loss tangent measurements were noticed for aged specimens over their unaged counterparts. Machine learning techniques, such as the principal component analysis (PCA) and the artificial neural network (ANN) analysis, were performed on LIBS spectral data of the samples to classify the aging mechanisms qualitatively.

Fire testing was conducted using modern UL-94, LOI and cone calorimeter test setups. It is demonstrated that thermal conductivity can significantly influence the time to ignition, although offering little fire resistance once ignited even in highly filled systems. Thus, for PA6 formulations containing solely 70 wt.% G, the peak heat release rate (pHRR) measured in cone calorimeter tests was 193 kW/m², whereas PA6 formulations containing 20 wt.% EG/50 wt.% G did not exhibit a measurable heat development. Particular attention was paid to effect separation between thermal conductivity and residue formation. Good thermal conductivity properties are proven to be particularly effective in test scenarios where the heat impact is comparatively low and the testing environment provides good heat dissipation and convective cooling possibilities. For candle-like ignition scenarios (e.g., LOI), filling levels of >50 wt.% (G or EG/G) are shown to be sufficient to suppress ignition exclusively by thermal conductivity. V0 classifications in UL-94 vertical burning tests were achieved for PA6 formulations containing ≥70 wt.% G, ≥25 wt.% EG and ≥20 wt.% EG/25 wt.% G.

Both the resin and the 3D printer used in this research are general-purpose commercial materials, not specifically intended for the implementation of microwave networks. The manufacturing and metallization procedures used to produce substrates for the design of planar microwave circuits are described, introducing the characterization process carried out to determine the electrical properties of the resin used. The ultrasonic techniques that allow the structural analysis of the manufactured substrates are also described. The electrical characterization provides a relative dielectric permittivity of 3.25 and a loss tangent of 0.03 for the resin used. In addition, the structural analysis shows a homogeneity and a finish of the manufactured parts that is not achievable using fused deposition modeling techniques. Finally, as a proof of concept, the design and manufacture of a complex geometry stepped impedance filter on a multi-height substrate using stereolithography techniques is presented, which allows for reducing the size of the traditional implementation of the same filter while maintaining its high-frequency response performance.

The morphologies of mixture in the center slice of sphere were focused. Two cases are considered: one is that the nanoparticles interact with the B blocks and the other is that the nanoparticles preferentially wet the B blocks. Under the two conditions, through changing the block ratio of the ABA star polymer, the concentration and radius of the nanoparticles, the phase behaviors of the mixtures confined the soft sphere are studied systematically. With increasing the concentration of nanoparticles, the entropy and the steric repulsive interaction of nanoparticles, and the nanoparticle density distributions along the perpendicular line through the center of sphere are plotted. The phase diagram is also constructed to analyze the effects of the nanoparticle volume fraction and radius on morphologies of ABA star polymers, and to study the effect of confinement on the phase behaviors. The results in this work provide a useful reference for controlling the ordered structures in experiment, which is an effective way to fabricate the newly multifunctional materials.

Thus, the search for new anti-inflammatory agents is increasing. Lectins are carbohydrate-interacting proteins that can modulate immune response and the release of inflammation mediators. The Microgramma vacciniifolia frond lectin (MvFL) was previously reported to be an immunomodulatory agent in vitro. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of MvFL on the in vivo inflammatory status in the carrageenan-induced peritonitis and paw edema, using female Swiss mice. The animals were pretreated intraperitoneally with MvFL (5 and 10 mg/kg). In the peritonitis assay, the total and differential migration of white blood cells was evaluated, as well as the levels of cytokines, nitric oxide (NO), and total proteins in the peritoneal fluid. In the paw edema evaluation, the paw volume was measured in the early (from 30 min–2 h) and late (3–4 h) phases of edema formation. MvFL (5 and 10 mg/kg) was efficient in reducing neutrophil infiltration, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α), NO, and protein content in the peritoneal fluid. It also repressed the edema formation in the late phase of the assay. In conclusion, MvFL showed inhibitory effects in in vivo acute inflammation, which encouraged future studies exploiting its immunomodulatory ability.

The stratum corneum (SC) is the outermost keratinized layer of skin through which only molecules with less or equal to 500 Da (Dalton) in size can freely move through the skin. Unfortunately, the conventional use of a hypothermic needle for large therapeutic agents is susceptible to needle phobia and the risk of acquiring infectious diseases. As a new approach, a microneedle (MN) can deliver therapeutically significant molecules without apparent limitations associated with its molecular size. Microneedles can create microchannels through the skin’s SC without stimulating the proprioceptive pain nerves. With recent technological advancements in both fabrication and drug loading, MN has become a versatile platform that improves the efficacy of transdermally applied therapeutic agents (TAs) and associated treatments for various indications. This review summarizes advanced fabrication techniques for MN and addresses numerous TA coating and TA elution strategies from MN, offering a comprehensive perspective on the current microneedle technology. Lastly, we discuss how microneedling and microneedle technologies can improve the clinical efficacy of a variety of skin diseases.

The purpose of this control system is to adaptively maintain the consistency of product quality by minimize the mass variation of injection molded parts. The adaptive control system works with the information collected through two sensors installed in the machine only—the injection nozzle pressure sensor and the temperature sensor. In this research, preliminary experiments are purposed to find master pressure curve that relates to product quality. Viscosity index, peak pressure, and timing of the peak pressure are used to characterize the pressure curve. The correlation between product quality and parameters such as switchover position and injection speed were used to produce a training data for back propagation neural network (BPNN) to compute weight and bias which are applied on the adaptive control system. By using this system, the variation of part weight is maintained to be as low as 0.14%.

Thus, existing as well as newly built houses have adequate interiors maintaining their temperature, warming, or cooling due to the environment compensation. One way to create this is to reduce the heat loss in buildings. An option to achieve this is the application of thermal insulations. Nowadays, the use of super insulation materials such as aerogel and vacuum insulation panels and other nano-structured insulations, such as graphite doped expanded polystyrene, is becoming increasingly justified. These are relatively new materials, and we know only a little about them. This paper presents research results based on temperature-induced investigations of nanostructured graphite expanded polystyrene, to reveal its thermal stability after long-term and short-term thermal annealing, simulating the ageing of the material. Firstly, with a differential scanning calorimeter, we will explore the thermal stability profile of the specimens. After this, the paper will present temperature-induced changes in both the thermal properties and the structure of the samples. We will also present changes in the thermal conductivity, modifications in the surface, and compressive property variation induced by thermal annealing. The samples were thermal annealed at 70 °C for 6 weeks, at 100 and 110 °C for 1 h. Besides the thermal conductivity measurements with Netzsch 446 heat flow meter equipment, we will present specific heat capacity measurement results executed with the same equipment. Moreover, sorption isotherms of the as-received and annealed samples were registered and completed with hydrophobic experiments, too. Furthermore, from the measurements, we showed that temperature should affect a significant change in the thermal conductivity of materials. Moreover, the changes in the graphite expanded polystyrene before and after thermal annealing were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy, as well as optical microscopy. The structural changes were further followed by an X-ray diffractometer and the IR absorption capability was tested, too.

For this purpose, the influence of modified fillers, such as silica modified with alumina, bentonite modified with quaternary ammonium salt, and hybrid filler lignin/silicon dioxide, on the functional properties of composites based on glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET-G) was investigated. In the first part of the work, using the proprietary technological line, filaments from unfilled polymer and its composites were obtained, which contained modified fillers in an amount from 1.5% to 3.0% by weight. The fittings for the testing of functional properties were obtained using the 3D printing technique in the Melted and Extruded Manufacturing (MEM) technology and the injection molding technique. In a later part of the work, rheological properties such as mass melt flow rate (MFR) and viscosity, and mechanical properties such as Rockwell hardness, Charpy impact strength, and static tensile strength with Young’s modulus were presented. The structure of the obtained composites was also described and determined using scanning electron microscopy with an attachment for the microanalysis of chemical composition (SEM/EDS) and the atomic force microscope (AFM). The correct dispersion of the fillers in the polymer matrix was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis (WAXS). In turn, the physicochemical properties were presented on the basis of the research results: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). On the basis of the obtained results, it was found that both the amount and the type of fillers used significantly affected the functional properties of the tested composites.

It has been employed in the removal of impurities from raw materials, separation of products and by-products after reaction, and separation of pollutants from water. Given the global problem of water pollution, this approach is efficient in removing hazardous substances from water bodies. Conventional processes are based on thermodynamic equilibria involving a phase transition such as distillation and liquid–liquid extraction. These techniques have a relatively low efficacy and nowadays they are not recommended because it is not sustainable in terms of energy consumption and/or waste generation. Pervaporation emerged in the 1980s and is now becoming a popular membrane separation technology because of its intrinsic features such as low energy requirements, cheap separation costs, and good quality product output. The focus of this review is on current developments in pervaporation, mass transport in membranes, material selection, fabrication and characterization techniques, and applications of various membranes in the separation of chemicals from water.
