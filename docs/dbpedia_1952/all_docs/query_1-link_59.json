        "text": "The social and cultural changes that occurred between the medieval and modern periods in urban contexts are well documented; however, those in rural contexts are less well understood. This research aims to bridge this gap by analysing changes in dietary practices and oral health conditions between the medieval and modern eras, and by identifying their relationship with the social status of individuals buried at the rural site of the church of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul in Joué-lès-Tours (Indre-et-Loire, France). The objectives of this study are to jointly analyse the isotopic data concerning the diet of 37 individuals and the osteological and archaeological data, and to tie these results in with local historical and archaeozoological data. While the burial practices identified between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries suggest social distinctions between groups of individuals, the study of diet (δ13C and δ15N) and the state of oral health point to a homogeneous social group characterized by the preferential consumption of pig meat, poultry and freshwater resources, and a degraded state of health. The available parochial registers and regional archaeozoological knowledge tend to confirm this hypothesis. This study confirms the relevance of the isotopic tool, which supplies dietary information to reinforce the archaeo-anthropological framework of interpretation, and also provides a critical examination of some of the criteria used to discuss the social composition of a set.\n\nThe historical link between wealth, food and health is a highly complex one. In this respect one of the most influential historical narratives has been developed for the late medieval period. In the 14th century, demographic decline would have resulted in “Das Goldene Zeitalter des Handwerks”: labour had become scarce, and nominal wages rose while prices remained stable or decreased. As a consequence, diet and nutrition intake would have improved for large parts of the population, peasants as well as urban wage-earners. Instead of the monotonous grain-based diet of the 12th and 13th centuries, food became more varied. Especially meat and fish, sources of proteins and iron, became affordable for larger parts of the population - Europe was more than ever turning into “l’Europe carnivore” eating up to 100 kilograms of meat per capita a year in the 15th century according to Wilhelm Abel . In recent years both the regional variation of this diet improvement and its presumed positive impact on health and mortality have been questioned in the historiography. The link between diet improvement, disease and mortality in the wake of the Black Death turns out to be an uncertain one, with important regional variations, and biased by epidemiologic, environmental and social conditions . As to the supposed increase in meat consumption, Massimo Montanari advocated a more nuanced approach, indicating important regional and chronological divergences within late medieval Europe, as well as the lack of evidence for increased overall meat consumption on the late medieval countryside: in many rural regions beef-eating remained uncommon and both the extension of animal husbandry and the booming international oxen trade were more than ever oriented towards the urban markets . In this paper we will take up Montanari’s remarks for one of the core regions of “L’Europe carnivore”: the county of Flanders. For the towns of the densely populated and urbanized Southern Low Countries, a significant increase in meat consumption from the late medieval period on has already been noticed by Herman Van Der Wee in 1966 . However the main problems remain unsolved: did late medieval diet indeed improve for large numbers of the both the urban and rural populations? We can further question whether such ‘improvement’ consisted solely of an increase in the quantities of meat consumed or conversely, whether more qualitative changes were also visible. Finally, it remains an open question whether the improved nutrition intake was sufficient to change health conditions and mortality on a more than individual base. In what follows we will concentrate on meat consumption, although the presumed nutritional changes of the late medieval period also concerned other foodstuffs like fish, cheese and butter. We will try to argue that an ‘overall’ increase in meat consumption in late medieval Flanders is highly problematic. Regional and social variations in food consumption were often more significant than ‘general’ chronological evolutions. As we will see, this wide variety of diets can only be explained by linking food consumption to regional economic and environmental conditions . In our Flemish test-case this will be illustrated by comparing the inland part of the region, where a more traditional small-size family survival economy had developed and where animal husbandry was focused on manure and dairy production, and not on private meat consumption, with the coastal area, where extensive and commercial cattle-breeding developed from the late medieval period on."
