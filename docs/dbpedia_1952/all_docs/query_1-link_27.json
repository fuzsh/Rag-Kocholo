A Norwegian national cohort of 231 children born EPT from 1999 to 2000 and separate study data on 556 children born at term in 2001 were compared. Parental questionnaires mapped the children's current sleep habits at 11 years of age, namely the prevalence of sleep problems throughout childhood until this age and five categories of sleep problems. In addition, the EPT children were clinically assessed at five years of age. The EPT children had different sleep habits than the controls, for example they went to bed earlier. EPT children had a higher prevalence of sleep problems than the controls throughout childhood (26% versus 14%, p < 0.001) and this was also higher for the 93 EPT children with no NDD (20%) than for the controls (14%) and increased with increasing NDD to 67% (p = 0.015) for the six children with severe NDD. EPT children had different sleep habits to term-born controls at 11 years of age, including those with no NDD. The prevalence of sleep problems increased with increasing NDD.

It is unclear whether these adverse outcomes extend to adulthood and apply to all of her children, or only those born when she was a teen. We examine the associations between young adult functioning and being born to a teen mother aged â¤20 years at the time of birth (current teen), and being born to a teen mother later in her life (>21 years, prior teen). The 1983 Ontario Child Health Study (OCHS) and 2001 follow-up are used, including 2,355 participants 4 to 16 years old in 1983 with 2001 data. Using multilevel modeling we assessed the association between being born to a current versus prior teen mother, relative to a nonteen mother, and 2001 outcomes, controlling for individual and family level characteristics assessed in childhood. Being born to a teen mother (versus a nonteen mother) is associated with poorer educational achievement, life satisfaction, and personal income. Accounting for time of sample children's birth in teen mothers' lives, individuals born to current and prior teen mothers showed a ~0.8-year educational deficit, relative to individuals born to nonteen mothers in fully adjusted models. Individuals born to current teen mothers reported lower life satisfaction and personal income (-$7,262). There were no significant group differences at follow-up in mental or physical health between individuals born to nonteen mothers and those born to current or prior teen mothers. Although being born to a teen mother exerts a pervasive adverse effect on educational attainment, the adverse effects on life satisfaction and personal income appear to be selective for individuals born to a current teen mother. Further research is required to understand these differential effects. Copyright Â© 2011 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Six-year-old children born preterm (n=36; gestational age 22-32wks) and at term (n=43) underwent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and behavioural assessments. Tracts were selected a priori based on findings from a study of 6-year-old children born at term: the left-hemisphere arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus, and right-hemisphere uncinate fasciculus. Using linear regression, we assessed associations between fractional anisotropy of tracts and phonological awareness and receptive and expressive language scores. We investigated whether associations were moderated by prematurity. Fractional anisotropy of the left-hemisphere arcuate fasciculus contributed unique variance to phonological awareness across birth groups. The association between fractional anisotropy of the right-hemisphere uncinate fasciculus and receptive and expressive language was significantly moderated by prematurity. A left-hemisphere tract was associated with phonological awareness in both birth groups. A right-hemisphere tract was associated with language only in the term group, suggesting that expressive and receptive language is mediated by different white matter pathways in 6-year-old children born preterm. These findings provide novel insights into similarities and differences of the neurobiology of pre-reading skills between children born preterm and at term at reading onset. White matter properties and pre-reading abilities were associated in children born preterm at the onset of reading. The neurobiology of phonological awareness was similar in children born preterm versus children born at term at 6 years. The neurobiology of language was different in children born preterm versus children born at term at 6 years.

Acquiring sufficient speech skills is crucial to good school performance. A prospective study was conducted in 2006 to evaluate speech development in 55 children born very prematurely in 2000 at the Rouen Teaching Hospital (Rouen, France), free of cerebral palsy, compared to 6-year-old born at full term. A computerized speech assessment tool was used (Bilan InformatisÃ© du Langage Oral, BILO II). In the premature-birth group, 49 % of 6-year-old had at least 1 score below the 25th percentile on 1 of the 8 BILO II tests. Significant speech impairments were noted for 2 components of speech, namely, comprehension and phonology. Oral comprehension scores no higher than the 10th percentile were obtained by 23 % of prematurely born children (P<0.02 vs controls). On word repetition tasks used to test phonology, 21 % of prematurely born children obtained scores no higher than the 10th percentile (P<0.01 vs controls). An evaluation of sensorimotor language prerequisites (constraints) in 30 of the 55 prematurely born children showed significant differences with the controls for word memory, visual attention, and buccofacial praxis. The speech development impairments found in 6-year-old born very prematurely suggest a distinctive pattern of neurodevelopmental dysfunction that is consistent with the motor theory of speech perception.

Children born preterm show reduced physical and psychosocial function compared to children born at term. This may influence their level of physical activity. Reports on moderately preterm children's physical activities during childhood are limited. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the leisure time physical activity at age 9-11Â years of moderately preterm children with that of children born at term. Data from 4941 mother-child pairs from the Aarhus Birth Cohort (1989-91) were used. The cohort gathered clinical information, including gestational age at delivery. Information about parental socio-demographic and lifestyle factors was obtained from questionnaires completed during the second trimester of pregnancy. Information about children's physical activities was reported in a 9- to 11-year follow-up questionnaire completed by parents detailing how many times per week their child participated in sports activities outside of school, hours spent per week playing outside, and hours per week engaged in sedentary activities. Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression with the lowest activity group as a reference group. A total of 158 children (3.2%) were born moderately preterm, i.e., between 32 and 36 completed weeks. Children born moderately preterm participated in sports activities as often as their peers born at term; they also participated in frequent sports activities (â¥ 4 times per week) as often as their peers. There were no differences in hours per week spent playing outside or in sedentary activities between the two groups. Nine- to 11-year-old moderately preterm children participated in sports activities outside school to a similar extent as their peers and engaged in outdoor activities and sedentary activities for the same duration of time per week as their peers born at term.\n\nJoint Laxity in Preschool Children Born Preterm.\n\nPubMed\n\nRomeo, Domenico M; Velli, Chiara; Lucibello, Simona; Ferrantini, Gloria; Leo, Giuseppina; Brogna, Claudia; Cota, Francesco; Ricci, Daniela; Gallini, Francesca; Romagnoli, Costantino; Vento, Giovanni; Mercuri, Eugenio\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo evaluate the prevalence of joint laxity in children born preterm assessed in the first 2 years, the relationship between joint laxity and motor performance at preschool age, and possible changes over time in a subgroup of children followed longitudinally. The revised scale of Beighton Score was used to evaluate joint laxity in a population of 132 preschool children born preterm between 24 and 32 weeks of gestational age. All were assessed for joint laxity between 12 and 24 months of age. Children also performed the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition between the age of 3 years and 6 months and 4 years; the age at onset of independent walking also was recorded. The total Beighton Score ranged between 0 and 8. Twenty percent of the cohort showed joint laxity. No differences related to sex or gestational age were observed. Children born preterm with joint laxity achieved later independent walking and achieved lower scores on Movement Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition than those without joint laxity. In 76 children born preterm, an assessment for joint laxity was repeated once between 25 and 36 months and again after >36 months. No statistically significant difference was observed between the 3 assessments. The Beighton Score can be used to assess generalized joint laxity in children born preterm. As the presence of joint laxity influenced motor competences, the possibility to early identify these infants in the first 2 years is of interest to benefit from early intervention and potentially improve gross motor skills and coordination.

The Perinatal Risk Index (PERI) might provide a predictive measure of these problems. This study compared the cognitive development of prematurely born children at 4 and 5 years of age with age-matched peers born at term. The secondary objective was to determine whether a correlation exists between perinatal risk and performance on neuropsychological tests among premature children. A total of 54 children between four and five years of age were evaluated; 27 were born very premature (premature group; PG), and 27 were born at term (term group; TG). Executive function, attention, memory, language, visual perception, and spatial structuring were evaluated. Subtests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, the Rey Complex Figure Test, the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Test A, Trails A and B, the spatial structuring questionnaire from the Child Neuropsychological Maturity Questionnaire, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children were used. A PERI score was also obtained for the PG. The PG showed significantly lower scores than the TG in all the studied cognitive domains. Visual-perceptive scores were significantly and negatively correlated with the PERI scores of the PG. The PG showed neurocognitive deficits compared with the TG. The PERI can be used to predict the development of visual-perceptive abilities in children between four and five years of age. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants were 30 children with ages between 4 and 7 years, who were divided into two groups: Group 1 (children born preterm), and Group 2 (children born full-term). The auditory processing results of Group 1 were correlated to data obtained from the behavioral auditory evaluation carried out at 12 months of age. The results were compared between groups. Subjects in Group 1 presented at least one risk indicator for hearing loss at birth. In the behavioral auditory assessment carried out at 12 months of age, 38% of the children in Group 1 were at risk for central auditory processing deficits, and 93.75% presented auditory processing deficits on the evaluation. Significant differences were found between the groups for the temporal order test, the PSI test with ipsilateral competitive message, and the speech-in-noise test. The delay in sound localization ability was associated to temporal processing deficits. Children born preterm have worse performance in auditory processing evaluation than children born full-term. Delay in sound localization at 12 months is associated to deficits on the physiological mechanism of temporal processing in the auditory processing evaluation carried out between 4 and 7 years.\n\nImpact of neonatal factors and nutrition on kidney size in 5-year-old preterm-born children.\n\nPubMed\n\nGalu, Sorana C; Hascoet, Jean-Michel; Vieux, Rachel\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe aim of this article is to evaluate the influence of neonatal factors on kidney size in 5-year-old preterm-born children. Preterm-born children were examined at 5 years with kidney ultrasound. A total of 20 children were evaluated. Their gestational age (GA) was 29.3âÂ±â1.5 weeks, birth weight 1,321âÂ±â323 g. On Day 28, protein intake was (median, range) 2.8 (1.7-3.6 g/kg) g/kg, protein/total calories ratio 2.8 (range, 1.7-3.3 g/100 kcal) g/100 kcal. At 5 years, their systolic blood pressure was 97âmm Hg (range, 84-115âmm Hg). All had normal estimated glomerular filtration rate. Protein intake on Day 28 and protein/calories ratio on Day 28 were associated with a low total relative renal volume, respectively, Î²â=ââ-â37âÂ±â15, pâ=â0.03; Î²â=ââ-â50âÂ±â19, pâ=â0.03, after adjustment on GA, neonatal morbidities, and body mass index (multivariate linear regression). Kidney size was not associated with protein intake at 5 years. Improving protein prescription in the neonatal period could have an impact on kidney size in childhood in preterm-born children.

Two-hundred and thirteen prematurely born and 217 children born at term were included. Accommodative amplitude and near-point convergence were assessed, together with best-corrected visual acuity (VA). A questionnaire was answered regarding possible problems at school. Binocular accommodation (P = 0.03) and convergence (P = 0.003) were significantly poorer in prematurely born children. Accommodation was correlated to neurological findings in the preterm group, but not to the degree of prematurity or stage of ROP. Regarding convergence there were no correlations to neurology, stage of ROP, or degree of prematurity. For neither accommodation nor convergence were any correlations with distance and near VA found. Preterm children had a higher prevalence of school problems, and there was an association with poor accommodation. Prematurely born children had poorer accommodation and convergence than full-term children, but no association with near VA was found. The reduction of accommodative amplitude and convergence was small and was probably of little clinical significance. However, it may have additional effects on other ophthalmological problems and school problems in the preterm group.\n\nGrowth and development in children born very low birthweight\n\nPubMed Central\n\nScharf, Rebecca J; Stroustrup, Annemarie; Conaway, Mark R; DeBoer, Mark D\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective To examine the relationships between growth (birth to age 2 years) and developmental outcomes in children born with very low birthweight (VLBW). Design Motor and mental development in children born with VLBW were regressed on anthropometric measurements at birth, 9 months and 2 years using multivariable regression. Setting The Early Childhood Longitudinal StudyâBirth Cohort, a longitudinal cohort, community sample, designed to be representative of children born across the USA. Patients 950 children born with VLBW (<1500 g). Main Outcome Measures Motor and cognitive scores on the Bayley Scales at 9 months and 24 months chronological age. Results A high proportion of children exhibited poor growth, with length-for-age z-scores <â2 (ie, stunting) in 21.3% of children at 9 months (adjusted for prematurity) and 34.2% of children at 2 years. Compared with children having z-scores >â2, children with growth shortfalls in head circumference, length and weight had a higher adjusted OR (aOR) of low Bayley motor scores at 9 months and 2 years (aOR ranging from 1.8 to 3.3, all p<0.05), while low Bayley cognitive scores were predicted by 9-month deficits in length and weight (aOR 2.0 and 2.4, respectively, both p<0.01) and 2-year deficits in length and head circumference (aOR 2.9 and 2.8, both p<0.05). Conclusion Anthropometric measures of growth were linked to current and future neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born with VLBW. While careful length measures may be a particularly useful marker, deficits in all anthropometric measures were risk factors for developmental delays.

We aimed to investigate neurodevelopmental outcome and use of special health care at 5 years of age in a population-based cohort of very preterm children. We included all 2901 livebirths between 22 and 32 completed weeks of gestation from nine regions in France in Jan 1-Dec 31, 1997, and a reference group of 667 children from the same regions born at 39-40 weeks of gestation. At 5 years of age, children had a medical examination and a cognitive assessment with the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC), with scores on the mental processing composite (MPC) scale recorded. Data for health-care use were collected from parents. Severe disability was defined as non-ambulatory cerebral palsy, MPC score less than 55, or severe visual or hearing deficiency; moderate deficiency as cerebral palsy walking with aid or MPC score of 55-69; and minor disability as cerebral palsy walking without aid, MPC score of 70-84, or visual deficit (<3/10 for one eye). In total, 1817 (77%) of the 2357 surviving children born very preterm had a medical assessment at 5 years and 396 (60%) of 664 in the reference group. Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in 159 (9%) of children born very preterm. Scores for MPC were available for 1534 children born very preterm: 503 (32%) had an MPC score less than 85 and 182 (12%) had an MPC score less than 70. Of the 320 children in the reference group, the corresponding values were 37 (12%) and 11 (3%), respectively. In the very preterm group, 83 (5%) had severe disability, 155 (9%) moderate disability, and 398 (25%) minor disability. Disability was highest in children born at 24-28 completed weeks of gestation (195 children [49%]), but the absolute number of children with disabilities was higher for children born at 29-32 weeks (441 children [36%]). Special health-care resources were used by 188 (42%) of\n\nGrowth and development in children born very low birthweight.\n\nPubMed\n\nScharf, Rebecca J; Stroustrup, Annemarie; Conaway, Mark R; DeBoer, Mark D\n\n2016-09-01\n\nTo examine the relationships between growth (birth to age 2â years) and developmental outcomes in children born with very low birthweight (VLBW).

Methods 26 full-term and 107 very preterm 7-year-old children (born <30 weeksâ gestational age and/or <1250 g) underwent T1- and diffusion-weighted imaging. Global white matter fiber networks were produced using 80 cortical and subcortical nodes, and edges created using constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography. Global graph theory metrics were analysed, and regional networks were identified using network-based statistics. Cognitive and motor function were assessed at 7 years of age. Results Compared with full-term children, very preterm children had reduced density, lower global efficiency and higher local efficiency. Those with lower gestational age at birth, infection or higher neonatal brain abnormality score had reduced connectivity. Reduced connectivity within a widespread network was predictive of impaired IQ, while reduced connectivity within the right parietal and temporal lobes was associated with motor impairment in very preterm children. Conclusions This study utilized an innovative structural connectivity pipeline to reveal that children born very preterm have less connected and less complex brain networks compared with typically developing term-born children. Adverse perinatal factors led to disturbances in white matter connectivity, which in turn are associated with impaired functional outcomes, highlighting novel structure-function relationships.

Until now, the impact of these factors on neurological development of children born to transplant mothers has not been established. A comparison of neurological examinations performed in 36 children of kidney transplant women (study group) and 36 children born to healthy mothers (control group). The children from both groups were born at a similar gestational age and in the similar time period from 12/1996 to 09/2012. Neurological examinations were performed from 07/2010 to 11/2013. Each examination was adjusted to the patient's age and performed after the neonatal period. Three years later children were re-consulted, if they presented neurological deviations or were less than 12 months old at the time of the first examination. Normal neurological development was found in 86% of children in both groups (pâ=â.999). Mild neurological deviations were observed in four (11%) children born to kidney transplant mothers and in five (14%) children born to healthy mothers (pâ=â.999). Moderate deviations were diagnosed in one premature child born to transplant mother, whose pregnancy was complicated with a severe preeclampsia and foetal growth restriction. In the study population, no severe neurological disorders were found. Almost all (8/10) children with neurological deviations were born prematurely in good general conditions. The neurological deviations observed in the first year of life were mild and transient. In children over 1 year of age, deviations were more pronounced and continued to maintain. The neurological development of children of kidney transplant women is similar to that of the general population and possible deviations seem to be the result of intrauterine hypotrophy and prematurity. Therefore, in clinical practice, it is necessary to plan post-transplant pregnancies especially in women at high risk of these complications.\n\nYoung Adult Outcomes of Children Born to Teen Mothers: Effects of Being Born during Their Teen or Later Years\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLipman, Ellen L.; Georgiades, Katholiki; Boyle, Michael H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective: Children of teen mothers exhibit adverse outcomes through adolescence. It is unclear whether these adverse outcomes extend to adulthood and apply to all of her children, or only those born when she was a teen.

In a prospective, multicenter, observational study, 889 of 966 eligible children born in 2002 to 2004 were evaluated at two and tenÂ years for neurological morbidity. Complementing questionnaire data to determine a history of seizures, all caregivers were interviewed retrospectively for postneonatal seizures using a validated seizure screen followed by a structured clinical interview by a pediatric epileptologist. A second pediatric epileptologist established an independent diagnosis based on recorded responses of the interview. A third epileptologist determined the final diagnosis when evaluators disagreed (3%). Life table survival methods were used to estimate seizure incidence through tenÂ years. By age tenÂ years, 12.2% (95% confidence interval: 9.8, 14.5) of children had experienced one or more seizures, 7.6% (95% confidence interval: 5.7, 9.5) had epilepsy, 3.2% had seizure with fever, and 1.3% had a single, unprovoked seizure. The seizure incidence increased with decreasing gestational age. In more than 75% of children with seizures, onset was after one year of age. Seizure incidence was comparable in both sexes. Two-thirds of those with epilepsy had other neurological disorders. One third of children with epilepsy were not recorded on the medical history questionnaire. The incidence of epilepsy through age tenÂ yearsÂ among children born extremely premature is approximately 7- to 14-fold higher than the 0.5% to 1% lifetime incidence reported in the general pediatric population. Seizures in this population are under-recognized, and possibly underdiagnosed, by parents and providers. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The study group consisted of prematurely born 40 children. Their mean gestational age at birth was 27.8 Â± 1.6 weeks (range 24-30 weeks). The control group consisted of 40 healthy children born with normal birth weight (>2500âg). The neuromotor function was assessed using Touwen neurological examination criteria. During the examination, the attention was focused on the hand preference, laterality, synkinesis, and asymmetry. In addition, children's weight, height, and BMI index were measured. Premature children showed much worse results than full-term ones in hand function ( p < 0,001). They obtained the best results in paper tearing while crossing the body midline turned out to be the most difficult. Considering the quality of walking, the biggest difficulty for the premature children was to walk backwards along the straight line while during normal walking they showed the best results. The results for the muscle tone subcategory in the study group were also significantly worse than those in control group ( p < 0,001), as well as the total outcome for the movement coordination and diadochokinesis subcategories ( p < 0,001). The nondisabled, prematurely born children have significantly lower average outcomes regarding hand function, quality of walking, muscle tone, coordination, and diadochokinesis at age of six to seven, compared to the full-term peers.\n\nCognitive development in children up to age 11 years born after ART-a longitudinal cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbuscia, Anna; Mills, Melinda C\n\n2017-07-01\n\nHow does the cognitive development of children conceived after ART (IVF and ICSI) - measured as cognitive skills at age 3, 5, 7 and 11 years - differ over time from those born after natural conception (NC)? Improved measures of cognitive development up to age 5 years were recorded in children conceived with ART compared to NC, which attenuates by 11 years, with ART children still scoring slightly better than NC children. Results on the cognitive outcomes of children conceived after ART have been highly contradictory. Some have shown that ART children have an impaired behavioural, socio-emotional and cognitive development and higher risk of mental disorders. Others have reported no increased risk or difference. Cognitive development has not been previously examined using latent growth curve models from ages 3 to 11 years, also including appropriate attention to confounding parental characteristics. Longitudinal data for the first five waves (2000-2012) of the UK Millennium Cohort Study were used, which is a two-stage sample of all infants born in 2000-2001 and resident in the UK at 9 months of age, drawn from the Department of Social Security Child Benefit Registers. A final sample of N = 15 218 children (125 IVF and 61 ICSI), from 14 816 families was used. Information was available for all waves for 8298 children. Four additional follow-up surveys were conducted in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2012. Our sample includes children born within a union (married or cohabiting parents) and where information on cognitive scores was available for at least two measurement points. Cognitive development was assessed with the British Ability Scales. At age 3 and 5 years (wave 2 and 3), children completed the naming vocabulary component, which measures expressive verbal ability. At age 7 years (wave 4), verbal cognitive abilities were assessed through the word reading test, and at age 11 years (wave 5) through a verbal similarity test. Two-tailed Student's t-tests examined differences\n\nThermal detection thresholds in 5-year-old preterm born children; IQ does matter.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Graaf, Joke; Valkenburg, Abraham J; Tibboel, Dick; van Dijk, Monique\n\n2012-07-01\n\nExperiencing pain at newborn age may have consequences on one's somatosensory perception later in life. Children's perception for cold and warm stimuli may be determined with the Thermal Sensory Analyzer (TSA) device by two different methods. This pilot study in 5-year-old children born preterm aimed at establishing whether the TSA method of limits, which is dependent of reaction time, and the method of levels, which is independent of reaction time, would yield different cold and warm detection thresholds. The second aim was to establish possible associations between intellectual ability and the detection thresholds obtained with either method. A convenience sample was drawn from the participants in an ongoing 5-year follow-up study of a randomized controlled trial on effects of morphine during mechanical ventilation. Thresholds were assessed using both methods and statistically compared. Possible associations between the child's intelligence quotient (IQ) and threshold levels were analyzed. The method of levels yielded more sensitive thresholds than did the method of limits, i.e. mean (SD) cold detection thresholds: 30.3 (1.4) versus 28.4 (1.7) (Cohen'sd=1.2, P=0.001) and warm detection thresholds; 33.9 (1.9) versus 35.6 (2.1) (Cohen's d=0.8, P=0.04). IQ was statistically significantly associated only with the detection thresholds obtained with the method of limits (cold: r=0.64, warm: r=-0.52). The TSA method of levels, is to be preferred over the method of limits in 5-year-old preterm born children, as it establishes more sensitive detection thresholds and is independent of IQ.

We explore the diet and physical activity knowledge and practices of Australian-born and overseas-born mothers with GDM history, for their three- to four-year-old children following antenatal health promotion education at a tertiary hospital. We conducted face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with 8 Australian-born and 15 overseas-born mothers with a history of GDM. Findings indicated that mothers of both groups were unaware of the increased health risks of their GDM for their children and could not recall receiving specific dietary or physical activity advice aimed at future child health. Their understanding of the diet and physical activity recommendations was inconsistent. Mothers of both groups expressed concern about the lack of reiteration of child health promotion messages following childbirth, particularly at postnatal follow-up visits. Diet and physical activity of the children of overseas-born mothers were adversely affected by inadequate maternal understanding of the recommendations due to language barriers, and child weight, healthy eating, and physical activity patterns derived from their home countries. We recommend enhanced health education for women with GDM on the future child health risks and their reduction by healthy lifestyle choices. This needs to be culturally relevant and reiterated after pregnancy.\n\nSocial development of children born very preterm: a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nRitchie, Kirsten; Bora, Samudragupta; Woodward, Lianne J\n\n2015-10-01\n\nTo review systematically studies examining the development of social competence in children born very preterm (VPT) (gestation <33 wks) and identify neonatal and family predictors. Peer-reviewed original articles were extracted from PubMed and PsycINFO following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Selection criteria included children born VPT and comparison children born at term, sample born after 1990, and children assessed between 0 and 17 years on at least one measure of social competence spanning social adjustment, performance, and/or social skills. Twenty-three studies were included. Seven focused on social competence and another 16 examined social competence within a range of outcomes. Study quality was low. Limitations included reliance on single informant data, cross-sectional measurement, use of brief screening tools, absence of child or peer report, and no conceptual model. In terms of social adjustment, 16 out of 21 studies found children born VPT had more peer problems and social withdrawal. Findings of social performance were mixed, with some studies suggesting differences in prosocial behavior (4/14) and others not. Social skills were assessed in four studies and showed children born VPT had poorer skills than children born at term. Predictors of social competence included gestational age, neonatal brain abnormalities, and family socio-economic status. Children born VPT have poorer social competence. These difficulties emerge early and persist throughout childhood.

The aims of the present study were to identify differences in white matter microstructure and connectivity of children born VPT compared to term-born children, as well as relations between white matter measures with cognitive outcomes and early brain injury. Diffusion images and T1-weighted anatomical MR images were acquired along with developmental assessments in 31 VPT children (mean GA: 28.76 weeks) and 28 term-born children at 4Â years of age. FSL's tract-based spatial statistics was used to create a cohort-specific template and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) skeleton that was applied to each child's DTI data. Whole brain deterministic tractography was performed and graph theoretical measures of connectivity were calculated based on the number of streamlines between cortical and subcortical nodes derived from the Desikan-Killiany atlas. Between-group analyses included FSL Randomise for voxel-wise statistics and permutation testing for connectivity analyses. Within-group analyses between FA values and graph measures with IQ, language and visual-motor scores as well as history of white matter injury (WMI) and germinal matrix/intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH/IVH) were performed. In the children born VPT, FA values within major white matter tracts were reduced compared to term-born children. Reduced measures of local strength, clustering coefficient, local and global efficiency were present in the children born VPT within nodes in the lateral frontal, middle and superior temporal, cingulate, precuneus and lateral occipital regions. Within-group analyses revealed associations in term-born children between FA, Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Full scale IQ within regions of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, forceps minor and forceps major.

With adjustments for gestational age (GA) and potential confounders, outcomes of children whose mothers had fewer years of education at the time of delivery and children whose mother advanced in education between birth and 10 years were examined.ResultsChildren of mothers in the lowest education stratum at birth were significantly more likely to score â¥2âSDs below normative expectation on 17 of 18 tests administered. Children of mothers who advanced in education (n=199) were at reduced risk for scoring â¥2âSDs on 15 of 18 measures, but this reduction was statistically significant on only 2 of 18 measures.ConclusionAmong EP children, socioeconomic disadvantage at birth, indexed by maternal education, is associated with significantly poorer neurocognitive and academic outcomes at 10 years of age, independently of GA. Maternal educational advancement during the child's first 10 years of life is associated with modestly improved neurocognitive outcomes.\n\nNeonatal brain abnormalities and memory and learning outcomes at 7 years in children born very preterm.\n\nPubMed\n\nOmizzolo, Cristina; Scratch, Shannon E; Stargatt, Robyn; Kidokoro, Hiroyuki; Thompson, Deanne K; Lee, Katherine J; Cheong, Jeanie; Neil, Jeffrey; Inder, Terrie E; Doyle, Lex W; Anderson, Peter J\n\n2014-01-01\n\nUsing prospective longitudinal data from 198 very preterm and 70 full term children, this study characterised the memory and learning abilities of very preterm children at 7 years of age in both verbal and visual domains. The relationship between the extent of brain abnormalities on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and memory and learning outcomes at 7 years of age in very preterm children was also investigated. Neonatal MRI scans were qualitatively assessed for global, white-matter, cortical grey-matter, deep grey-matter, and cerebellar abnormalities. Very preterm children performed less well on measures of immediate memory, working memory, long-term memory, and learning compared with term-born controls. Neonatal brain abnormalities, and in particular deep grey-matter abnormality, were associated with poorer memory and learning performance at 7 years in very preterm children. Findings support the importance of cerebral neonatal pathology for predicting later memory and learning function.\n\nLanguage functions in preterm-born children: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Noort-van der Spek, Inge L; Franken, Marie-Christine J P; Weisglas-Kuperus, Nynke\n\n2012-04-01\n\nPreterm-born children (<37 weeks' gestation) have higher rates of language function problems compared with term-born children. It is unknown whether these problems decrease, deteriorate, or remain stable over time. The goal of this research was to determine the developmental course of language functions in preterm-born children from 3 to 12 years of age. Computerized databases Embase, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and PsycInfo were searched for studies published between January 1995 and March 2011 reporting language functions in preterm-born children. Outcome measures were simple language function assessed by using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and complex language function assessed by using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Pooled effect sizes (in terms of Cohen's d) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for simple and complex language functions were calculated by using random-effects models. Meta-regression was conducted with mean difference of effect size as the outcome variable and assessment age as the explanatory variable. Preterm-born children scored significantly lower compared with term-born children on simple (d = -0.45 [95% CI: -0.59 to -0.30]; P < .001) and on complex (d = -0.62 [95% CI: -0.82 to -0.43]; P < .001) language function tests, even in the absence of major disabilities and independent of social economic status. For complex language function (but not for simple language function), group differences between preterm- and term-born children increased significantly from 3 to 12 years of age (slope = -0.05; P = .03). While growing up, preterm-born children have increasing difficulties with complex language function.\n\nChanging Neurodevelopment at 8 Years in Children Born Extremely Preterm Since the 1990s.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheong, Jeanie L Y; Anderson, Peter J; Burnett, Alice C; Roberts, Gehan; Davis, Noni; Hickey, Leah; Carse, Elizabeth; Doyle, Lex W\n\n2017-06-01\n\nSurvival of extremely preterm (EP; <28 weeks' gestation) infants has increased over the last 2 decades. Equivalent reductions in developmental morbidity in early childhood have not been consistently reported. The aim of this study was to determine trends in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 8 years of age of children born EP (22-27 completed weeks' gestation) over the past 2 decades. Population-based cohorts of all EP survivors born in the state of Victoria, Australia in 1991-1992, 1997, and 2005 were recruited at birth. At 8 years of age, general intelligence (IQ), academic achievement, and neurosensory status were assessed. Major neurosensory disability was defined as any of moderate or severe cerebral palsy, IQ <-2 SD relative to term controls, blindness, or deafness. Rates of major neurosensory disability were similar in all eras (1991-1992, 18%; 1997, 15%; 2005, 18%), as were rates of IQ <-2 SD, cerebral palsy, blindness, and deafness. Mean z scores for IQ were similar across eras, but there was some evidence that scores for academic achievement were lower in 2005 than in 1997, and the odds of having academic problems were higher in 2005 than in both earlier eras. These outcomes were not explained by differences in known perinatal care or sociodemographic variables between eras. Contrary to expectations, rates of major neurosensory disability have not improved, and academic performance is poorer at early school age in 2005 than in earlier eras for EP children born in the state of Victoria, Australia.

Both being born LGA and childhood overweight may influence the development of asthma, although the role of overweight in the association between LGA and childhood asthma is unclear. Importantly, recent studies have suggested that the association between overweight and asthma may be related to non-allergic pathways. If this also applies to the association between LGA and asthma, the association between being born LGA and asthma may be different for atopic and non-atopic children. We investigated the association of being LGA with the prevalence of asthma at age 8 in atopic and non-atopic children and the role of overweight in this association. Complete data on asthma, anthropometry and atopy at age of 8Â years, and potential confounders were available for 1608 participants of the PIAMA birth cohort. Odds ratios for the association between LGA and asthma in atopic and non-atopic children were estimated by logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. Overweight was assessed as a potential modifier of the association between LGA and asthma. Being born LGA was not significantly associated with asthma at age of 8 in atopic and non-atopic children. However, overweight at age of 8Â years modified the association between asthma at age of 8 and LGA. In non-atopic children, children who were born LGA and were overweight at age of 8Â years had a significantly increased odds of asthma compared to non-LGA, non-overweight children (adj OR 7.04; 95% CI 2.2-24). We observed that non-atopic children born LGA, who were overweight by 8Â years have an increased risk of asthma. If confirmed, these findings suggest that non-atopic children born LGA may be identified early in life as a high-risk group for asthma.

This study showed no overall increased risk of childhood cancer in individuals born after donor ART. Most large population-based studies have shown no increase in overall childhood cancer incidence after non-donor ART; however, other studies have suggested small increased risks in specific cancer types, including haematological cancers. Cancer risk specifically in children born after donor ART has not been investigated to date. This retrospective cohort study utilized record linkage to determine the outcome status of all children born in Great Britain (1992-2008) after donor ART. The cohort included 12 137 members who contributed 95 389 person-years of follow-up (average follow-up 7.86 years). Records of all children born in Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland) after all forms of donor ART (1992-2008) were linked to the UK National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) to determine the number who subsequently developed cancer by 15 years of age, by the end of 2008. Rates of overall and type specific cancer (selected a priori) were compared with age, sex and calendar year standardized population-based rates, stratifying for potential mediating/moderating factors including sex, age at diagnosis, birth weight, multiple births, maternal previous live births, assisted conception type and fresh/ cryopreserved cycles. In our cohort of 12 137 children born after donor ART (52% male, 55% singleton births), no overall increased risk of cancer was identified. There were 12 cancers detected compared to 14.4 expected (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 0.83; 95% CI 0.43-1.45; P = 0.50). A small, significant increased risk of hepatoblastoma was found, but the numbers and absolute risks were small (<5 cases observed; SIR 10.28; 95% CI 1.25-37.14; P < 0.05). This increased hepatoblastoma risk was associated with low birthweight.

Developmental outcomes of 40 children born after ICSI were compared with those of 40 children born after spontaneous conception (SC). Outcome measures included the Raven's Progressive Matrices Test, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Athina Test of Learning Difficulties. Regarding cognitive development, ICSI children tend to obtain a similar intelligence score with SC children on Raven's Test. No significant differences were noted on CBCL's syndrome and abilities' profiles, and on Athina Test. ICSI and SC children show a comparable cognitive and socio-emotional development and have the same chances of manifesting learning disabilities. None of the demographic factors taken into consideration (age, sex of the child, and educational level of the parents) nor the mode of conception seem to affect their well-being.\n\nMotor trajectories from birth to 5 years of children born at less than 30 weeks' gestation: early predictors and functional implications. Protocol for a prospective cohort study.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpittle, Alicia J; McGinley, Jennifer L; Thompson, Deanne; Clark, Ross; FitzGerald, Tara L; Mentiplay, Benjamin F; Lee, Katherine J; Olsen, Joy E; Burnett, Alice; Treyvaud, Karli; Josev, Elisha; Alexander, Bonnie; Kelly, Claire E; Doyle, Lex W; Anderson, Peter J; Cheong, Jeanie Ly\n\n2016-10-01\n\nMotor impairments are one of the most frequently reported adverse neurodevelopmental consequences in children born < 30 weeks' gestation. Up to 15% of children born at < 30 weeks have cerebral palsy and an additional 50% have mild to severe motor impairment at school age. The first 5 years of life are critical for the development of fundamental motor skills. These skills form the basis for more complex skills that are required to competently and confidently participate in schooling, sporting and recreational activities. In children born at < 30 weeks' gestation, the trajectory of motor development from birth to 5 years is not fully understood. The neural alterations that underpin motor impairments in these children are also unclear. It is essential to determine if early clinical evaluations and neuroimaging biomarkers can predict later motor impairment and associated functional problems at 5 years of age. This will help to identify children who will benefit the most from early intervention and improve functional outcomes at school age. The primary aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of motor impairment from birth to 5 years of age between children born at < 30 weeks and term-born controls, and to determine whether persistent abnormal motor assessments in the newborn period in those born at < 30 weeks predict abnormal motor functioning at 5 years of age. Secondary aims for children born at < 30 weeks and term-born children are: 1) to determine whether novel early magnetic resonance imaging-based structural or functional biomarkers that can predict motor impairments at 5 years are detectable in the neonatal period; 2) to investigate the association between motor impairments and concurrent deficits in body structure and function at 5 years of age; and 3) to explore how motor impairments at 5 years (including abnormalities of gait, postural control and strength) are associated with concurrent functional outcomes, including physical activity, cognitive\n\nTwo-Year Data from a Long-Term Phase IV Study of Recombinant Human Growth Hormone in Short Children Born Small for Gestational Age.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchwarz, Hans-Peter; Walczak, MieczysÅaw; Birkholz-Walerzak, Dorota; Szalecki, Mieczyslaw; Nanu, Michaela; Woehling, Heike; Schuck, Ellen\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThis ongoing, prospective, open-label, non-comparative, multicenter phase IV study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH; Omnitrope(Â®), Sandoz GmbH) in short children born small for gestational age (SGA). Here we report data from patients who have completed 2Â years' treatment. Eligibility criteria included prepubertal children born SGA with growth disturbances defined as current height standard deviation score (HSDS)Â <-2.5 and parental adjusted SDSÂ <-1; birth weight and/or lengthÂ <-2 SDS; and failure of catch-up growth [height velocity (HV) SDSÂ <0 during the last year] by 4Â years of age or later. The primary study objective is to assess the long-term effect of Omnitrope treatment on the development of diabetes in short children born SGA. Secondary objectives include evaluation of efficacy, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), occurrence of malignancies during treatment, and detection of anti-rhGH antibodies during treatment. In total, 278 children have been enrolled and received study medication; 249 have completed 2Â years of treatment. No child has developed diabetes mellitus during the first 2Â years; no fasting glucose or 2-h oral glucose tolerance test value exceeded the pre-defined limits ofÂ >126 orÂ >200Â mg/dL, respectively. No adverse alterations in body mass were noted. Treatment-emergent AEs were experienced by 211 (76.2%) children; most of these were of mild-to-moderate intensity (99.3%) and considered unrelated to study medication (97.6%). Treatment with Omnitrope was effective; mean HSDS wasÂ -3.39 at baseline,Â -2.57 at 1Â year and -2.15 at 2Â years of treatment. Mean HVSDS (peak-centered) also improved, from -2.13 at baseline to +4.16 at 1Â year and +2.23 at 2Â years. In this second interim analysis, short children born SGA were safely and effectively treated with rhGH (Omnitrope), and 2 years' treatment had no major adverse impact on carbohydrate metabolism or body mass.

The aim of the study was to make a neurological assessment of infants and children born to liver transplant recipients (LTRs) born between December 4, 2001, and February 11, 2013, in the 1(st) Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Warsaw. The study involved 88 children, of whom 44 children were born to LTR mothers, and 44 children born to women who were not organ recipients and delivered at a similar gestational age. The gestational age of neonates ranged from 33 to 41 weeks, and the birth weight ranged from 1420 g to 4100 g. The neurological examination was performed in children from 7 weeks to 10 years of age. The neurological development was assessed by a specialist in pediatric neurology. The results of the examination were divided according to the following criteria: 1) normal development, 2) slight disorders, 3) moderate disorders, and 4) severe disorders. The Fisher's exact test was used for statistical analysis. Normal development was found in 35 of 44 (79.54%) children in the LTR group and 39 of 44 (88.63%) children in the control group (P = .3827). Slight disorders were observed in 6 of 44 (13.63%) children in LTR group and 5 of 44 (11.36%) children in the control group. Moderate disorders were found only in 3 of 44 (6.81%) children in the LTR group. No severe disorders were observed in both groups. Neurological development of children born to the liver recipients who were exposed to chronic immunosuppressive treatment in their fetal lives is the same as that of children whose mothers have not undergone organ transplantation.\n\nThe relationship between sleep problems and working memory in children born very preterm.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcCann, Marie; Bayliss, Donna M; Anderson, Mike; Campbell, Catherine; French, Noel; McMichael, Judy; Reid, Corinne; Bucks, Romola S\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn two studies, the relationship between sleep and working memory performance was investigated in children born very preterm (i.e., gestation less than 32Â weeks) and the possible mechanisms underlying this relationship. In Study 1, parent-reported measures of snoring, night-time sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness were collected on 89 children born very preterm aged 6 to 7Â years. The children completed a verbal working memory task, as well as measures of processing speed and verbal storage capacity. Night-time sleep quality was found to be associated with verbal working memory performance over and above the variance associated with individual differences in processing speed and storage capacity, suggesting that poor sleep may have an impact on the executive component of working memory. Snoring and daytime sleepiness were not found to be associated with working memory performance. Study 2 introduced a direct measure of executive functioning and examined whether sleep problems would differentially impact the executive functioning of children born very preterm relative to children born to term. Parent-reported sleep problems were collected on 43 children born very preterm and 48 children born to term (aged 6 to 9Â years). Problematic sleep was found to adversely impact executive functioning in the very preterm group, while no effect of sleep was found in the control group. These findings implicate executive dysfunction as a possible mechanism by which problematic sleep adversely impacts upon cognition in children born very preterm, and suggest that sleep problems can increase the cognitive vulnerability already experienced by many of these children.\n\nDiffusion Tensor Tractography of the Cerebellar Peduncles in Prematurely Born 7-Year-Old Children.\n\nPubMed\n\nShany, Eilon; Inder, Terrie E; Goshen, Sharon; Lee, Iris; Neil, Jeffrey J; Smyser, Christopher D; Doyle, Lex W; Anderson, Peter J; Shimony, Joshua S\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to correlate neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm-born children and their perinatal clinical and imaging characteristics with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of the three cerebellar peduncles at age 7. Included in this prospective longitudinal study were 140 preterm-born children (<30Â weeks gestation) who underwent neurodevelopmental assessment (IQ, motor, language, working memory) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at age 7Â years. White matter tracts in the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles were delineated using regions of interest drawn on T2-weighted images and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. Diffusion measures (mean diffusivity (MD) and FA) and tract volumes were calculated. Linear regression was used to assess relationships with outcome. The severity of white matter injury in the neonatal period was associated with lower FA in the right superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) and lower tract volumes of both SCPs and middle cerebellar peduncles (MCPs). In the MCP, higher IQ was associated with lower MD in the whole group and higher FA in right-handed children. In the SCP, lower motor scores were associated with higher MD and higher language scores were associated with higher FA. These associations remained significant in multivariable models. This study adds to the body of literature detailing the importance of cerebellar involvement in cognitive function related to reciprocal connections with supratentorial structures.\n\nPredictive value of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition at 4Â years, for motor impairment at 8Â years in children born preterm.\n\nPubMed\n\nGriffiths, Alison; Morgan, Prue; Anderson, Peter J; Doyle, Lex W; Lee, Katherine J; Spittle, Alicia J\n\n2017-05-01\n\nTo assess the predictive validity at 4Â years of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition (MABC-2) for motor impairment at 8Â years in children born preterm. We also aimed to determine if sex, cognition, medical, or social risks were associated with motor impairment at 8Â years or with a change in MABC-2 score between 4 years and 8Â years. Ninety-six children born at less than 30Â weeks' gestation were assessed with the MABC-2 at 4 years and 8Â years of age. Motor impairment was defined as less than or equal to the 5th centile. The Differential Ability Scales - Second Edition (DAS-II) was used to measure General Conceptual Ability (GCA) at 4Â years, with a score <90 defined as 'below average'. There was a strong association between the MABC-2 total standard scores at 4Â years and 8Â years (59% variance explained, regression coefficient=0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.91, p<0.001). The MABC-2 at 4Â years had high sensitivity (79%) and specificity (93%) for predicting motor impairment at 8Â years. Below average cognition and higher medical risk were associated with increased odds of motor impairment at 8Â years (odds ratio [OR]=15.3, 95% CI 4.19-55.8, p<0.001, and OR=3.77, 95% CI 1.28-11.1, p=0.016 respectively). Sex and social risk did not appear to be associated with motor impairment at 8Â years. There was little evidence that any variables were related to change in MABC-2 score between 4 years and 8Â years. The MABC-2 at 4Â years is predictive of motor functioning in middle childhood. Below average cognition and higher medical risk may be predictors of motor impairment.

Very preterm children (n = 200; mean age, 8.2 Â± 2.5 years) born between 1996 and 2004 were compared with 230 term-born children (mean age, 8.3 Â± 2.3). The Dutch National Pupil Monitoring System was used to measure preschool numerical reasoning and early linguistics, and primary school simple and complex word reading, reading comprehension, spelling, and mathematics/arithmetic. With univariate analyses of variance, we assessed the effects of preterm birth on performance across grades and on grade retention. In preschool, very preterm children performed comparably with term-born children in early linguistics, but perform more poorly (0.7 standard deviation [SD]) in numerical reasoning skills. In primary school, very preterm children scored 0.3 SD lower in complex word reading and 0.6 SD lower in mathematics/arithmetic, but performed comparably with peers in reading comprehension and spelling. They had a higher grade repeat rate (25.5%), although grade repeat did not improve their academic skills. Very preterm children do well in early linguistics, reading comprehension, and spelling, but have clinically significant deficits in numerical reasoning skills and mathematics/arithmetic, which persist with time.

The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of SGA and short stature in children born SGA who qualify for GH treatment at 3âyears of age in a Japanese population. A population-based study was conducted in Kobe, Japan with 27 228 infants who were born between 2006 and 2008 and followed until 3âyears of age. Prevalence of birthweight (BW) or birth length (BL)ââ¤â-2.0 standard deviation scores (SDS) for gestational age (GA; definition of SGA) was calculated. Short children born SGA who qualify for GH treatment at 3âyears of age were estimated using the following criteria: BW and BL below the 10th percentile for GA, BW or BLââ¤â-2.0 SDS for GA, and 2.5 SDS below the mean height for age. The prevalence of SGA was 3.5%. The estimated prevalence of short stature in children born SGA who met the criteria for GH treatment was 0.06%. The prevalence in infants born <34âweeks (0.39%) was significantly higher than that in infants born 34-41 weeks GA (0.05%, Pâ=â0.02). The prevalence of SGA and short stature in children born SGA who qualify for GH treatment is approximately 1 of 30 infants and 1 of 1800 children, respectively. The risk is increased when children are born <34âweeks GA.

We recruited 100 very preterm (â¤32â weeks gestational age) child-parent dyads and a control group of 50 term-born dyads born between 2001 and 2004 with follow-up at 7 years. Parents completed the Parenting Stress Index, Ways of Coping Questionnaire, Child Behavior Check List, Beck Depression Inventory and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires. Child IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale-IV. After controlling for maternal education, parents of preterm children (95% CI 111.1 to 121.4) scored higher (p=0.027) on the Parenting Stress Index than term-born controls (95% CI 97.8 to 113.2). Regression analyses showed that child externalising behaviour, sex and parent escape/avoidance coping style, predicted higher parenting stress in the preterm group. Parents of preterm girls expressed higher levels of stress than those of boys. Maladaptive coping strategies contribute to greater stress in parents of very preterm children. Our findings suggest that these parents need support for many years after birth of a very preterm infant. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Aims To compare the social competence of very preterm (VPT) and full term (FT) born children at age 4 and identify infant, social and family factors associated with later risk. Study design Prospective longitudinal study. Subjects A regionally representative cohort of 103 VPT (â¤32 weeks gestation) children and a comparison group of 105 FT children (36-41 weeks gestation) born between 1998 and 2000. Outcome measures At corrected age 4 years, a range of parent report, observational and laboratory measures assessed children's emotional and behavioral adjustment, emotional regulation, social interactive behavior and theory of mind understanding. Extensive perinatal, social background and family functioning data were also available from birth to age 4. Results Compared to their FT peers, VPT born children had poorer emotional and behavioural adjustment, were less effective in regulating their emotions, had lower levels of positive peer play and had less synchronous interactions with their parents. Within the VPT group, predictors of poor social competence included family socioeconomic disadvantage, extreme prematurity, severity of cerebral white matter abnormalities and early childhood exposure to high levels of maternal anxiety and negative parenting. Conclusions VPT pre-schoolers are characterized by a range of subtle social difficulties likely to adversely affect their ability to establish and maintain positive relationships with others. These difficulties need to be monitored alongside other potential neurodevelopmental concerns and parents supported to actively nurture child social competence.

A retrospective analysis was performed on the pubertal development data of children born with ART in Peking University Third Hospital from 1994 to 2003 (ART group). The data in the cross-sectional study \"Reports on the Physical Fitness and Health Research of Chinese School Students in 2010\" were used as a control. The age at menarche and the age at spermarche were compared between the two groups. The status of pubertal development in the overweight and obese children in the ART group was evaluated to investigate the correlation between pubertal development and body mass index (BMI). A total of 200 children born with ART were enrolled in this study, and 72 of them (41 males and 31 females) completed the survey (response rate=36.0%). In the ART group, the mean age at spermarche and the mean age at menarche were 13.9 years (95%CI: 13.7-14.3 years) and 12.2 years (95%CI: 11.8-12.6 years), respectively. There were no significant differences in the age at spermarche and the age at menarche between the ART and control groups (P>0.05). In the ART group, there were no significant differences in the age at spermarche and the age at menarche between the overweight and obese children and the normal weight children (P>0.05). There were also no significant differences in overweight rate and obesity rate between the children in the ART group and the adolescents in Beijing (P>0.05). In the ART group, there was no significant correlation between the age at spermarche or menarche and BMI (P>0.05). No delayed or precocious puberty is observed in children born with ART. This is consistent with the normal control data. And there is no significant correlation between pubertal development and BMI in children born with ART.\n\nVisuospatial perception in children born preterm with no major neurological disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nButcher, Phillipa R; Bouma, Anke; Stremmelaar, Elisabeth F; Bos, Arend F; Smithson, Michael; Van Braeckel, Koenraad N J A\n\n2012-11-01\n\nMany investigations have found deficits in visuospatial perception in children born preterm, however, it is not clear whether the deficits are specific to visuospatial perception or the consequences of deficits in other functional areas, which often accompany preterm birth. This study investigated whether children born preterm show a specific deficit in visuospatial perception. Fifty-six 7- to 11-year-old preterm born children (gestational age <34 weeks) without cerebral palsy and 51 age-matched, full-term children completed four computerized tasks tapping different levels and types of visuospatial perception. Accuracy and speed of responses were recorded. Task formats were designed to reduce demands on attentional deployment. Measures of intelligence and parental education were included in the analysis. Children born preterm performed less accurately and/or less rapidly on all tasks. Their poorer performance did not reflect differences in speed-accuracy trade-off. Parental education and IQ, both significantly lower in the preterm children, contributed positively to performance on all tasks. IQ mediated the association between preterm birth and visuospatial performance on the most cognitively demanding task. Children born preterm performed more poorly than full-term controls on four visuospatial perceptual tasks. Although intelligence and parental education were also associated with performance, preterm birth contributed independently of these factors on three of four tasks. Many children born preterm are thus multiply disadvantaged on visuospatial tasks: the lower IQ scores and parental educational levels frequently found in this group increase the deficit associated with preterm birth.

Of particular interest was the identification of biological and socioenvironmental risk and protective factors that influence VPT children's early language development. Data were collected as part of a prospective longitudinal study of 110 VPT (VPT: â¤ 33 weeks gestation) and 113 full-term children (full term: 37-41 weeks gestation) born in Canterbury, New Zealand from 1998 to 2000. At corrected age 4 years, all children were assessed with the preschool version of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Extensive information was also collected about children's family social background, perinatal health, childrearing environment, education/intervention exposures, and neurodevelopmental progress from birth to age 4. At the age of 4 years, VPT children were characterized by poorer receptive and expressive language development than full-term children. These differences persisted after exclusion of children with neurosensory impairment as well as statistical adjustment for the effects of social risk. Within the VPT group, the key predictors of children's overall language development were family social risk at birth (p =.05), severity of white matter abnormalities on neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (p =.49), observed parent-child synchrony (p =.001), and concurrent child cognitive ability (p =.001). Together, these factors accounted for 45% of the variance in children's total Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool scores. By preschool age, children born VPT show early emerging mild to moderate language delays that are likely to affect their school success and longer-term developmental progress. Findings highlight the importance of potentially modifiable factors such as early brain injury and parenting quality in predicting the language outcomes of children born VPT.\n\nResting-State Oscillatory Activity in Children Born Small for Gestational Age: An MEG Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoersma, Maria; de Bie, Henrica M. A.; Oostrom, Kim J.; van Dijk, Bob W.; Hillebrand, Arjan; van Wijk, Bernadette C. M.; Delemarre-van de Waal, HenriÃ«tte A.; Stam, Cornelis J.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGrowth restriction in utero during a period that is critical for normal growth of the brain, has previously been associated with deviations in cognitive abilities and brain anatomical and functional changes. We measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 4- to 7-year-old children to test if children born small for gestational age (SGA) show deviations in resting-state brain oscillatory activity. Children born SGA with postnatally spontaneous catch-up growth [SGA+; six boys, seven girls; mean age 6.3âyear (SDâ=â0.9)] and children born appropriate for gestational age [AGA; seven boys, three girls; mean age 6.0âyear (SDâ=â1.2)] participated in a resting-state MEG study. We calculated absolute and relative power spectra and used non-parametric statistics to test for group differences. SGA+ and AGA born children showed no significant differences in absolute and relative power except for reduced absolute gamma band power in SGA children. At the time of MEG investigation, SGA+ children showed significantly lower head circumference (HC) and a trend toward lower IQ, however there was no association of HC or IQ with absolute or relative power. Except for reduced absolute gamma band power, our findings suggest normal brain activity patterns at school age in a group of children born SGA in which spontaneous catch-up growth of bodily length after birth occurred. Although previous findings suggest that being born SGA alters brain oscillatory activity early in neonatal life, we show that these neonatal alterations do not persist at early school age when spontaneous postnatal catch-up growth occurs after birth. PMID:24068993\n\nGlobal and Regional Differences in Brain Anatomy of Young Children Born Small for Gestational Age\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDe Bie, Henrica M. A.; Oostrom, Kim J.; Boersma, Maria; Veltman, Dick J.; Barkhof, Frederik\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn children who are born small for gestational age (SGA), an adverse intrauterine environment has led to underdevelopment of both the body and the brain. The delay in body growth is (partially) restored during the first two years in a majority of these children. In addition to a negative influence on these physical parameters, decreased levels of intelligence and cognitive impairments have been described in children born SGA. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging to examine brain anatomy in 4- to 7-year-old SGA children with and without complete bodily catch-up growth and compared them to healthy children born appropriate for gestational age. Our findings demonstrate that these children strongly differ on brain organisation when compared with healthy controls relating to both global and regional anatomical differences. Children born SGA displayed reduced cerebral and cerebellar grey and white matter volumes, smaller volumes of subcortical structures and reduced cortical surface area. Regional differences in prefrontal cortical thickness suggest a different development of the cerebral cortex. SGA children with bodily catch-up growth constitute an intermediate between those children without catch-up growth and healthy controls. Therefore, bodily catch-up growth in children born SGA does not implicate full catch-up growth of the brain.

Twenty-seven participants received a neurological examination and a battery of neuropsychological assessments including Wechsler Preschool & Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition (WPPSI-III; cognitive development), Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition (PLS-4; language development), Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (visual motor abilities), Childhood Autism Rating Scales II (a screening test for autistic spectrum disorders), and the Miles ABC Test (ocular dominance). Parental questionnaires included the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Preschool Version (BRIEF-P; executive function), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Carey Temperament Scales Behavioral Style Questionnaire (socioemotional development and temperament), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Interview Edition, Second Edition (general adaptive behavior). Subjects' tests results were compared to each test's norms. Children born after PGD demonstrated scores within the normal or above-normal ranges for all developmental outcomes (mean Â± SD): WPPSI-III-VIQ 107.4 Â± 14.4 (p = .013), PLS-4-Total 113.2 Â± 12.4, p < .001), CBCL-Total 41.1 Â± 8.6 (p < .001), BRIEF-P-Global Executive Composite 44.8 Â± 9.5 (p = .009). Twelve (44%) of the PGD children had a significant difference between their VIQ and PIQ scores (compared to 27% in the general population). One subject was found to show possible signs of autistic spectrum disorder, although a family history of autism was noted. In conclusion, in this pilot study, children assessed at age 4-5 years and conceived after PGD displayed developmental neuropsychological outcomes within normal limits as compared to their chronologic peers. A larger study is needed to evaluate and follow the neuropsychological development of children born after PGD.\n\nLong-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born with gastroschisis: the tiebreaker.\n\nPubMed\n\nGorra, Adam S; Needelman, Howard; Azarow, Kenneth S; Roberts, Holly J; Jackson, Barbara J; Cusick, Robert A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe evaluated 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with gastroschisis. We reviewed the records of children with gastroschisis treated between August 2001 and July 2008. Children discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit were referred to the state-sponsored Developmental Tracking Infant Progress Statewide (TIPS) program. We reviewed TIPS assessments performed before age 2 years. School districts evaluated children referred by TIPS and determined their eligibility for early intervention services. Poor outcomes were defined as scores of \"failure\" or \"moderate/high risk\" on the screening assessment or enrollment in early intervention services by 2 years. Children with gastroschisis were compared with case-matched nonsurgical, nonsyndromic children of similar gestational age and birth weight. One hundred five children were born with gastroschisis, and 46 were followed up with TIPS. There was no statistically significant difference in performance on screening assessments or in the rate of enrollment in early intervention services between the gastroschisis children and controls. Children born with gastroschisis have similar 2-year neurodevelopmental outcomes as nonsurgical, nonsyndromic neonatal intensive care unit children of similar gestational age and birth weight. Both groups of children have a higher rate of enrollment in early intervention than their healthy peers. These data suggest that neurodevelopmental outcomes in gastroschisis children are delayed secondary to prematurity rather than the presence of the surgical disease. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Children were grouped into nine cohorts based on their year of birth. The UK National BMI percentile classification was used to classify the children as overweight and obese and to examine the prevalence and trends by year of birth, sex and ethnicity. Overall, more boys (10.1%; 9.7-10.6%) than girls (9.1%; 8.7-9.6%) were obese (P < 0.003). South Asian boys were more likely to be overweight (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.62-2.28; P < 0.01) and obese (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.28-1.89; P < 0.01) than South Asian girls. Overweight (1.77; 1.56-2.00; P < 0.05) and obesity (1.76; 1.50-2.06; P < 0.05) were significantly higher among South Asian boys compared with their White counterparts (baseline). After adjusting for sex, ethnicity and year of birth, South Asian children were 27% more overweight (P < 0.01) and 45% more obese (P < 0.01) compared with White children, and boys were 6% more overweight (P = 0.04) and 12% more obese (P = 0.003) compared with girls. There was an increasing trend in overweight among boys (P = 0.01) and girls (P = 0.003); and in obesity among boys (P < 0.001) and girls (P = 0.008) in children born from 1991 to 1999. There is a significant rise in childhood obesity among 5-7-year-old children. Overweight and obesity among South Asian boys are significantly higher than that among South Asian girls. This group may be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality related to obesity and may need to be targeted appropriately for interventions to reduce obesity.\n\nMortality throughout early childhood for Michigan children born with congenital anomalies, 1992-1998.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerger, Katherine H; Zhu, Bao-Ping; Copeland, Glenn\n\n2003-09-01\n\nCongenital anomalies are a leading cause of infant deaths, accounting for almost a fifth of all infant deaths. Few studies have researched the survival experience of infants born with congenital anomalies past the infant stage. Using birth and death files routinely linked to the Michigan Birth Defects Registry, we identified all singleton infants during calendar years 1992 through 1998 with reportable congenital anomalies for our study. A comparative file of children born without congenital anomalies during the same time period was developed using linked birth and death files. The mortality data were assessed by age at death (through age six) and race to determine mortality rates, relative risks, hazard ratios, and survival trends. Throughout early childhood, children born with congenital anomalies had a high risk of mortality compared with all other children. The overall 7-year hazard ratio comparing children with congenital anomalies with all other children was 7.2. Overall mortality rates for black children were significantly higher than white children through the age of seven, irrespective of whether they had congenital anomalies. Among children with congenital anomalies, this disparity disappeared after adjusting for birth weight, sex, mother's age, mother's education, and number of organ systems affected. Compared with children without congenital anomalies, children born with congenital anomalies had a higher risk of mortality well beyond the infant period. Racial disparities in mortality rates among children with congenital anomalies were due to confounding factors.\n\nThe growth and development of children born to adolescent mothers in Taiwan.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Wei-Ya; Li, Chi-Rong; Kuo, Ching-Pyng; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Lee, Meng-Chih\n\n2016-08-31\n\nAdolescent pregnancy carries a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. Currently, there are very few longitudinal studies that have investigated the growth of children born to adolescents. This study explores the birth outcomes and determinants in adolescent pregnancies with subjects enrolled from the Taiwan Birth Cohort Study (TBCS). Using the data of Wave I (6Â months old), II (18Â months old), and III (36Â months old) of TBCS, a national sample of 19,381 pairs of mothers and their children were included for analysis. Out of these subjects, therewere560 pairs of adolescent mothers and children. Through completed field interviews with structured questionnaires, surveys with mothers or other family members, and with references to each child's birth certificate and Passport of Well-baby Care, the differences in birth outcomes, personal, pregnancy, and social profiles of the mothers were analyzed. A total of 560 adolescent mothers (<20Â years old) and 18,821 adult mothers (20-34 years old) were included in this study. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of parameters of children growth and development. The numbers (proportions) of failure in milestones at 3Â years old in gross motor functions, fine motor function, language, and social/personal development of children born to adolescent mothers are 13(2.32), 34(6.07), 10(1.79), and 24(4.29Â %), respectively; while there are 392(2.08), 1015(5.39), 308(1.64) and 512(2.72Â %) for those born to adult mothers, respectively. The risk factors of failure in children development were identified as \"the mother isn't the night-time caregiver\" and \"family dysfunction\". There was no significant difference in development at 3Â years old among children born to adolescent and adult mothers.\n\nDecreased birth weight, length, and head circumference in children born by women years after treatment for hyperthyroidism.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhrling, Hans; TÃ¶rring, Ove; Yin, Li; Iliadou, Anastasia N; Tullgren, Ove; Abraham-Nordling, Mirna; Wallin, GÃ¶ran; Hall, Per; LÃ¶nn, Stefan\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWhether hyperthyroidism influences the birth characteristics of children born several years after treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to compare birth characteristics in singleton newborns delivered by women previously treated for Graves' disease (GD), toxic nodular goiter (TNG), or nontoxic goiter (NTG). This was a nested case-control design within a national cohort registry study from 1950 through 2006. The study was conducted at a university and a hospital center in collaboration. The birth characteristics of newborns (n = 3421) delivered in a cohort of 43 633 women treated for GD or toxic nodular goiter by radioiodine or surgery (exposed group) at least 1 year prior to pregnancy were compared with newborns (n = 2914) of 45 655 mothers, previously operated for NTG (unexposed group). The primary outcome was birth weight, length, and head circumference. The secondary outcome was malformations, gestational age, and type of hyperthyroidism. The birth weight of exposed children was 3431 Â± 607 g (mean Â± SD) compared with the unexposed, 3520 Â± 641 g (P < .001). The cumulative odds ratio (OR) for lower birth weight was 1.29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.43]. The average birth length for the exposed children was 50.0 Â± 2.7 cm compared with the unexposed of 50.4 cm Â± 2.6 cm (P < .01) [cumulative OR 1.25 (95% CI 1.13-1.37)]. The head circumference was 34.5 Â± 1.9 cm among exposed and 34.7 Â± 1.8 cm, respectively (P < .001), with an OR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.13-1.35). No differences in birth characteristics were observed between children born after maternal GD or toxic nodular goiter. Previous GD or TNG may influence the birth characteristics several years after radioiodine or surgical treatment.\n\nBehavioral, cognitive, and motor performance and physical development of five-year-old children who were born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection with the use of testicular sperm.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeijerink, Aukje M; Ramos, Liliana; Janssen, Anjo J W M; Maas-van Schaaijk, Nienke M; Meissner, Andreas; Repping, Sjoerd; Mochtar, Monique H; Braat, Didi D M; Fleischer, Kathrin\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo evaluate at the age of 5Â years the behavioral, cognitive, and motor performance and physical development of children born after testicular sperm extraction (TESE) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). A prospective longitudinal cohort study. Two university medical centers. A total of 103 5-year-olds who were born after TESE-ICSI. The follow-up of the children was performed by questionnaires at birth and again at 1Â year and at 4Â years of age. Five-year-old children were invited for individual assessment. Behavioral performance was assessed with the use of the Child Behavior Checklist for parents and teachers. Cognitive performance was assessed with the use of the Dutch Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence test, 3rd version. Motor performance was assessed with the use of the Dutch Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd version. Physical development was assessed by means of physical examination and medical history. Behavioral, cognitive, and motor performance and physical development. Eighty-nine children were completely assessed, and 14 were partially assessed at the age of 5Â years. The 5-year-old cohort assessed significantly better on behavioral and cognitive performance and significantly worse on motor performance-but still in the normal range-compared with the theoretic distribution in the general population. Four children (3.8%) of the 5-year-old cohort had developmental problems/delays. Two of them were previously diagnosed with a form of autism (pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified). Two children had developmental problems based on our behavioral, cognitive, and/or motor assessments. The long-term effects "
