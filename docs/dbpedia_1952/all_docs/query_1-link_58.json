        "text": "Team Leclair\n\nG Cayden Primeau: Primeau was pretty sharp in nets for Team Leclair, displaying solid side-to-side quickness and impeccable rebound control. In fact, Primeau barely surrendered any rebounds period, as he gobbled up dangerous changes from in close. The kid looks like he has a strong relationship with his posts — he takes care of them and they take care of him. Primeau was the best of the four goaltenders who participated.\n\nG Jake Oettinger: Oettinger did everything right except put his rebounds where they were supposed to go. He’s a top-end goaltending prospect and likely gets picked pretty high in the draft. But he’s not going to always have elite defensemen playing in front of him to clear up the gifts he leaves in the slot. To be fair, he’s proven to control them in previous games. He just needs to be more consistent.\n\nLW Grant Mishmash: Mismash was his typical self, finding his way into scoring areas and getting a handful of pucks on net. He opened the scoring by whipping a loose puck from the slot past Adam Scheel. Mismash played on the top line but didn’t get top-line minutes, if that makes any sense. He was one of several players who came within a hair from connecting on a nice play.\n\nC Ryan Poehling: A lot of eyes were on the big Minnesotan, who used a dominant Hlinka to springboard into the top 30 of our initial 2017 draft rankings. He was the nominal top-line center for Team Howe, and on occasion displayed his ridiculous puck control that ranks him among the best of any draft eligible. He picked up an assist on Mishmash’s goal but it was a busted play off a blocked shot. He didn’t do well on the few faceoffs he took but positioning himself properly and used his long reach to break up passes for a counterattack. Poehling has an excellent shot but tried to be more of a passer in this one.\n\nRW Logan Hutsko: Hutsko is a crafty player with very good vision. He liked to stop on a dime and look for trailers after entering the zone, and his passes were hard and accurate. He displayed speed and a nice set of hands by creating a 2-on-1 and batting home his own blocked pass. Hutsko was one of Team Leclair’s consistent shift-to-shift performers.\n\nLW Jacob Tortora: Tortora was flying both inside and out, using a change of pace to give himself an extra bit of room. The puck was on his stick a lot, and he properly identified the open point man rather than dump it behind the net. The timing of his lead passes were off by a nose, but you can say that for more than half a roster that was understandably fighting through chemistry issues.\n\nC Sasha Chmelevski: Chmelevski had a strong game, enhancing his reputation as a kid who doesn’t choke on quality chances. This kid is a finisher and does so with authority, and you can see why it stung Sarnia to trade him to Ottawa, even if Travis Konecny was the returning piece. Chmelevski slipped away from detection quite a few times (his on-ice awareness is impeccable) and with that shot and finishing abilities, you wonder if he’s better suited at wing.\n\nRW Vanya Lodnia: Lodnia has a cannon of a shot, which probably explains why he led Team Leclair with five shots on goal. On one shift in particular, he found a way to take the puck up ice with authority and fire a shot on net despite spending the majority of the shift in his own end. He blew past Max Gildon for a 2-on-1 break, then slowed it down as he neared the slot before firing a wicked shot past a helpless Keith Petruzelli for the go-ahead marker in the third.\n\nLW Kyle MacLean: A hard-working kid from nearby Basking Ridge, NJ, MacLean was strong on the puck and played fearless. He didn’t have an issue getting his nose dirty and lending support to beleaguered linemates during board battles, and he has the confidence to escape from a scrum in his own end and power the puck up the ice. He’s a lot more creative than you’d think and had a couple of chances near the net.\n\nC Evan Barratt: Barratt is a two-way forward who is generally reliable in his own end. He made up for a rough night at the dot (1-9) by getting in the way of shots and legally picking off either his man or someone else’s after the puck dropped. His best chance came off a gorgeous set up from linemate Sean Dhooghe, who fed Barratt for a hard one-timer from the slot that forced Petruzzelli to make a tough shoulder save.\n\nRW Sean Dhooghe: Dhooghe was the most exciting player to watch of either team from the moment the puck dropped to the final whistle. He has all the tools – speed for days, elite vision and a sixth sense for finding open ice. There was one play where he turned a 1-on-4 situation into an actual scoring chance. Dhooghe is bad for an opposing coach’s health, and his dizzying speed and shifting of gears makes him difficult to contain. And while a lot of players can skate, dangle and dish, only a few can break down and visualize the game the way Dhooghe can.\n\nLW Austin Pratt: Pratt played well within what seemed like a defensive role, assuming a position on one of the penalty killing units and finding himself with a lot of defensive zone starts. We always viewed Pratt as a shooter, but he displayed puck control and stickhandling while curling around pressure. He’s a big boy, and defenders struggled getting in front of him.\n\nC Mark Kastelic: Kastelic had a fine game defensively and looked like a real shutdown center. He’s very strong on the puck and difficult to contain without it. Kastelic went 7-2 on draws and didn’t allow his man to get open, and was a fierce competitor while battling for pucks in the low slot and along the boards.\n\nRW Brannon McManus: McManus did everything for Team Leclair – play on the both special teams units, set up goals and even buried one himself. Both of his assists could be considered broken plays, but good things happen the more you have the puck. McManus has an excellent shot, and he transitioned after his sixth or seventh shift from looking to pass to firing it on net with confidence. He knows how to make room for himself and create his own shot, and the hustle he displayed without the puck shows he’s more than just a point producer.\n\nLHD Mikey Anderson: Anderson handled the puck a ton and grew confident as the minutes ticked down. All you see on his stat line is a “+1”, but his defensive-zone play was critical towards limiting the amount of chances his goalies faced. He made mistakes like everyone else, but his ability to recover from them in the form of positioning is what stood out most. Anderson has a very good shot but had his attempts blocked.\n\nRHD Phil Kemp: Kemp is a no-nonsense shutdown defender who looks like he improved his footwork in the offseason. The game was tightly checked, and a big kid like Kemp is one of the reasons why. He didn’t give puck carriers any room, and if he did, he closed on and eliminated them rather quickly. You’re not going to get much offense from him, but he gets kudos for contributing in other aspects.\n\nLHD Nate Knoepke: Knoepke had the best game of any defender, playing with savvy and making the right choices. He scored a goal with a laser of a wrist shot from just inside the blue line, but also showed he can pass the puck with both accuracy and authority from distances beyond center ice. Knoepke loves to shoot the puck – he was credited with only one shot but had several attempts — and will send the puck towards the net immediately after a teammate was open for a tip-in attempt.\n\nRHD Reilly Walsh: There aren’t many defenders who can move their feet as well as Walsh, and it served him well when evading forecheckers and moving laterally for a shooting lane to open. Walsh has very good closing speed and showed he’s not risk averse by dashing up the ice and filling into the gap below the opposing circles. He’s a very good stickhandler and finds the open man without hesitation, but he was a little loosey-goosey with his gap and reaction to plays in front of the net.\n\nLHD Tyler Inamoto: We liked that Inamoto played the AAPG as if it were a Game 7, throwing his body around and busting it on every shift. He’s a very good skater who made precision plays inside his own end, and he played his odd-man rushes perfectly. Inamoto had a slight malfunction when a blown tire deep in the offensive zone almost led to a break the other way, but he recovered in time to seal it off.\n\nRHD Ronald Brickey: Brickey played in a lot of defensive-zone situations and was utilized for the penalty kill. He was partnered with swift puck mover Jack Rathbone, and the pair seemed to have chemistry while moving the puck past the forecheck. There was one lengthy shift when he was trapped in his own end for a while, but he stayed with his man and didn’t retaliate to some vicious crosschecks before moving the puck to safety.\n\nLHD Jack Rathbone: We wanted him to have more of an opportunity to shine – there just wasn’t enough ice for him in this one. Rathbone is very crafty, from using the boards for a clean bank passes to a hard, crisp head man to split the zone coverage. He was used on the penalty kill with effectiveness and bailed out his forwards when they made rash decisions with the puck near his own blue line.\n\nTeam Howe\n\nG Adam Scheel: Scheel didn’t face many shots, but he was burned by a stoppable shot by Mismash in the first period and later whiffed on a deep wrister from Knoepke. He was slow to react to Chmelevski’s marker from the right circle in the second period but seemed to settle down thereafter. It was tough to evaluate him on his puck-stopping abilities because he wasn’t all that busy.\n\nG Keith Petruzelli: Petruzelli displayed nice form and control of his rebounds, but he melted down in the third period by allowing goals on three separate 2-on-1s – all from the shooter side. He’s too big of a kid to get beat up high with regularity, so challenging the shooter while fine-tuning his net presence may help him in the long run. His puck handling, however, seemed to improve.\n\nLW Patrick Khoderenko: Khoderenko had one heck of a game defending his own end and covering up for his linemates’ up-ice antics. Not bad for a player who is expected to dominate offensively. He has the speed and strength to meet the challenge of knocking big wingers off the puck, and there were several rushes up the ice when the defender seemed reluctant to physically challenge him.\n\nC Casey Mittelstadt : Chalk up another solid high-profile event to this top prospect’s resume, as the future Minnesota Golder Gopher scored twice while showcasing a speed-power combo that gave fits to the opposing team. His game is reminiscent of a young Rick Nash, but one who looks quite comfortable at center – Mittelstadt was dominant at the dot, winning 12 of 14 draws.\n\nRW Kailer Yamamoto : Yamamoto is an offensive force who looks to create quality scoring chances every shift. A byproduct of this mindset is overpassing, and what you get is a feast-or-famine result – Yamamoto picked up a pair of assists but tried to force things into the middle of the ice with opposing checkers on the prowl. Nonetheless, his chemistry with Mittelstadt cannot be denied. The former U18 teammates picked up right where they left off in April.\n\nLW Logan Cockerill : One of the fastest players on the ice, Cockerill played fearless while making every shift memorable. He was credited with a goal in the third period after bombing down the wing into the goal which forced the puck across the line. Cockerill also played on the penalty kill and pressed the point men rather than afford them the chance to shoot. His own shot is slightly above average but accurate.\n\nC Michael Pastujov: Pastujov is coming off a dominant Hlinka where he was a scoring-chance machine, but his game in Philadelphia was somewhat quiet. He played the body quite a few times and came an inch or two from a couple of easy tap-ins.\n\nRW Cole Coskey: Coskey had a solid game identifying and connecting with the open man and maintaining control of the puck while sticks were swatting all around him. He came close to linking up with Pastujov for quality chances near the slot, but seemed content with Logan Cockerill handling the puck as often as he could.\n\nLW Jason Robertson: Robertson is a sniper who lived up to his billing, firing off a team-high five shots and scoring a goal off a rebound in front of the net. He’s a big kid with deceptive speed who fired off shots before an opposing stick was there to alter it. He too was guilty of fooling around with the puck at his own blue line, albeit on just a shift or two. He made up for it, however, with a gorgeous behind-the-back pass from the far boards that sprung Josh Norris for a breakaway attempt.\n\nC Josh Norris: Norris has a reputation of being a top two-way forward, and you saw glimpses of it in Philadelphia. He has a strong grasp of play development and seems to know exactly where the puck will move next. Norris has enough quickness to appear out of nowhere and turn what seems like a harmless cross-ice feed into a counterattack going the other way. He picked up an assist after he made a nice give-and-go with Jason Robertson for his goal at the side of the net.\n\nRW Scott Reedy: Reedy plays a heavy game, and this game’s in-your-face style seemed to suit him. He’s a load to handle and almost impossible to thwart when he has his feet moving forward, but the five-man collapse within the defensive zone coupled with the quality of one-on-one defenders limited him to a secondary assist. It was a curious decision to see Reedy flank center Josh Norris, as both are competing for the NTDP’s top line pivot slot. He caused havoc in the crease to free up Robertson for a goal in the second period, and the meanness to his style is something we can get used to.\n\nLW Mick Messner: Go figure. The kid who keeps getting depth roles during high-profile events yet again finds a way to stand out. Messner is a coach’s dream, hustling in all three zone and using his speed and awareness to pick passes off and quickly head the other way. Placing a player in a defensive role takes on a new meaning when said player not only does it at a high level, but counters with offense as well. Messner, who was Team USA’s defensive specialist extraordinaire at the Hlinka, had three shots and a well-earned assist on Mittlestadt’s tying tally late in the second period, controlling the puck while falling off to the side of the net before sending it in front for Mittelstadt to bury.\n\nC R.J. Murphy: Murphy centered Team Howe’s “energy line” with Messner and Matt Miller on the flanks. The trio consistently put pressure on the opposing defensemen and didn’t give the forwards much room in the neutral zone. Murphy is a solid stickhandler who didn’t panic with the puck, and even had a shift where he had both a quality scoring chance and a set-up.\n\nRW Matt Miller: Smart and energetic is the best way to describe the way Miller played, as he was always positioned properly thanks to quick feet and direct routes towards the areas he needed to be in. He will make a fine penalty killer at higher levels.\n\nLHD David Farrance: It was a joy to watch this smooth-skating New Yorker effortlessly carry the puck in and around checkers, and it’s a shame there wasn’t much room for him to show his true abilities. Farrance has a quick first step but knows when it’s time to slow it down and reassess his options.\n\nRHD Luke Martin: Martin is a sound positional defender who displayed a hard wrist shot and quick feet when racing to the wall to keep pucks in the offensive zone. He was very good positionally, even when he correctly covered his man near the crease when an open Chmelevski fired one home from the right circle. Martin didn’t have it easy, as he was constantly reacting to the risky passes being made in the middle of the ice by the Mittelstadt line. He even won the majority of his footraces to the puck.\n\nLHD Ben Mirageas: This is one elusive cat who plays calm and makes smart plays. Mirageas is an offensive defenseman with very good mobility, but his calmness and soft touch helped him slip passes around or under pressure before joining the rush. Forecheckers had a tough time rattling him, and he furnished a hard, accurate shot. He was paired with the bigger Max Gildon, who seemed comfortable deferring the breakouts to Mirageas.\n\nLHD Max Gildon: Gildon has a lot of tools at his disposal and displayed them on occasions. He played it safe for the first half of the game, showing little creativity when he took the puck up the ice and across the red line. He struggled to contain Vanya Lodnia for a tie-breaking goal early in the third period. Gildon didn’t have a bad game — he broke up dozens of plays in the low slot and released properly when chasing puck carriers down low.\n\nRHD John Maniscalco: A local kid with the crowd to support him, Maniscalco looked quite comfortable and poised for a teenager playing on his favorite team’s rink. He was fine handling the puck and didn’t buckle under pressure, using the boards to lead teammates into the zone and spinning away from forecheckers before taking it up the ice himself. Maniscalco has soft hands to deaden tough passes and is not afraid to drop down into the circles.\n\nRHD Tommy Miller: Miller’s noticeable asset is skating, which he used to break free from forwards and increase the likelihood of an odd-man attack. He has an extremely long reach as well, and he knocked forwards off the puck with a simple shove. Miller is capable of creativity and is confident with the puck, reminiscent of former NTDP’er and current New York Rangers prospect Brady Skjei. With his size, speed and IQ, something tells me he will be a fast riser.\n\nLHD Clayton Phillips: Phillips displayed his swift-skating abilities while quarterbacking one of the power play units and made timely step-ups to break up oncoming rushes. He used his stick with purpose, swatting away pucks as attackers neared the low slot. He looked comfortable for one of the youngest players of either side — Phiilps missed eligibility for the 2018 draft by just seven days. He wasn’t physical, but allowing the bigger forwards some room didn’t hurt him as he kept them to the outside.\n\nG Adam Scheel (6’3/189, Notre Dame): This was the best Scheel has looked in any of our viewings, and there was little he could do on four of the five goals — the last being a bomb from the point through a maze of players. His rebound control was impeccable in every sense of the term, and only once did we see him put a rebound in front of him, and that was when he batted a puck well beyond the slot. Scheel timed dump-ins with quickness and did well with communicating with his defenders. He made a save of his early season — a left pad split at the goal mouth to thwart a saucered centering feed off a 2-on-1.\n\nLW Grant Mishmash (6’0/184, North Dakota): Mismash picked up the primary assist on Randey Hernandez’s goal when his hard wrist shot was too tough to handle. But it was an otherwise quiet performance by one of Team USA’s better goal scorers, who on several occasions put his linemates at risk by forcing passes to them when they were covered. He made a few low-percentage plays and took a tripping penalty. Mismash played on Scott Reedy’s line with Hernandez and came across as a bit of a passenger.\n\nRW Randy Hernandez (6’0/177): Hernandez was probably Team USA’s best forward, firing off a team-high four shots on goal and displaying excellent vision. He skates with his head up while juking his way into the offensive zone, and he seemed quite comfortable handling the puck. Hernandez’s passes were accurate for the most part, and connected with linemates with authority.\n\nLW Graham Slaggert (5’11/184, Notre Dame): Slaggert is a two-way forward who can fill in at either center or wing. He was on Dhooghe’s left flank and did a lot of yeoman’s work, taking hits and using his speed to skate the puck out of harms way. He won all three of his draws after filling in for his overzealous center, and connected on all the passes he was supposed to make. Slaggert — a Notre Dame commit — was another forward who was effective on the penalty kill\n\nLW Joey Cassetti (6’3/187, Boston College): Cassetti played a crash-and-bang style suitable for the way the evening transpired, hustling every shift without giving away anything in terms of positioning and defensive responsibilities. He displayed good separation speed and puck protection by taking a stretch pass for a breakaway during a Team USA power play, only to have the puck bounce on him right before reaching the low slow. Cassetti is a cerebral player when it comes to board battles, positioning his body and stcik properly while using soft, subtle chip or bank passes to allow teammates to escape up ice with numbers.\n\nLW Jacob Tortora (5’7/162, Boston College): Tortora was one of Team USA’s better players, using his dynamic speed and tenacity to generate chances through a dense network of Crimson sticks and bodies. He didn’t get his name on the scoresheet, but Tortora made several high-end plays to not only elude the sticks of bigger opponents, but lure them towards him so he could thread the needle with passes that created chances. He’s very slippery and tough to contain, but what we liked most is how physically engaged he played and how he finished his checks on bigger players. Tortora played on the top power play unit, positioning himself in the slot area. He also revealed a very hard wrist shot that missed the net.\n\nC Evan Barratt (5’11/187, Penn State): Barratt showed good chemistry centering linemates Jacob Tortora and Brady Tkachuk, but it was his cross-ice assist onto the tape of Nate Knoepke for a power play goal that stood out the most. He centered the top power play unit and played on the penalty with an average night on faceoffs (6-8). He too finished his checks and was effective in using his stick to swat away opposing centering feeds and zone entry attempts. Barratt revealed a hard, accurate backhander that he was able to roof from in close\n\nRW Sean Dhooghe (5’3/138, Wisconsin): Dhooghe is a tough customer who was the least bit intimidated against Harvard’s bigger player. He had an excellent night at the dot (11-5), and used his speed and edge work to remain unpredictable as he zipped though the neutral zone with speed. Unfortunately for Dhooghe, there wasn’t a whole lot of room for him, and the Crimson defenders were able to lean on him with ease. And when he found the time and space in the form of a 3-on-2, his tape-to-tape pass to a cutting Tyler Inamoto was mishandled.\n\nRHD Phil Kemp (6’3/201): Another solid effort from Kemp who is looking more and more like a stay-at-home defender. He had trouble with only a few of his breakouts, but he dished out a couple of big hits and never once did we catch him wandering from where he was supposed to be. Kemp is a heavy-hitter who was rewarded with some power play time that only reinforced how he should be groomed to only clean up messes in his own end.\n\nLHD Nate Knoepke (6’3/01, Minnesota): Knoepke was Team USA’s best defender from wire to wire, and it wasn’t only for his roof-shot power play goal. His size and long stride allowed him to deal with the forecheck, and he was confident with his puck handling. We’re starting to think he’s going to be our top NTDP blueliner as the draft nears, as he’s done nothing to dispel a rise up our rankings.\n\nLHD Tyler Inamoto (6’2/196, Wisconsin): Inamoto had a long night, beginning with a turnover right to Adam Fox for the game’s opening score. He had a handful of misplays with the puck and looked to make up for it with open-ice hits. From the dots down, he’s a suitable defender. His problems, however, may stem from overconfidence with the puck — Inamoto’s an excellent skater and tries to involve himself in every play. He could stand to work on his gap control, as he was cleanly beaten to the outside on a seemingly average one-on-one situation.\n\nLW Logan Cockerill (5’9/164, Boston University): Cockerill is an explosive skater who joined linemates Sean Dhooghe and Graham Slaggert to create a handful of turnovers. Harvard did a solid job of recovering from turnovers, thus limiting the amount of room the trio had to work with. Although Cockerill was quiet at even strength, he did an excellent job during the penalty kill by pressing points and using a quick stick to deflect passes out of the zone.\n\nRW Michael Pastujov (6’0/192, Michigan): Pastujov may have been a dominant player at the Ivan Hlinka tournament, but his season has since been rather quiet. He was neutralized for most of the game, but did make a gorgeous rush into the zone and dangled a defender before rifling a shot just over the crossbar. He played on a line with center Josh Norris and Joey Cassetti — a trip that was pinned in its own end on several occasions. Pastujov has issues with clearing attempts and turned the puck over more than once.\n\nC Josh Norris (6’1/192, Michigan): Norris displayed his high-end potential in spurts, but Harvard was otherwise effective in limiting Team USA”s top-line center from creating scoring chances. He has ridiculous hands and can control the puck in the tightest of spaces, and more than once we saw him strip the puck from an unassuming defender headed up ice. Norris has a brutal nigh on faceoffs (5-13) at first glance, but his instincts allowed him to be quick to the puck and cut down the amount of time the Crimson had to create off of successful draws.\n\nRW Scott Reedy (6’1/202, Minnesota): Reedy seemed ticked off from the second the puck dropped, banging everything in site and mixing it up after the whistle. He registered a secondary assist in a goal by Hernandez — a play made possible by his difficult keep-in of a Harvard clearing attempt. Reedy stood out in two ways — first, he has eyes in the back of his head. Reedy found ways to sneak drop or lead passes to a cutting linemate while not only looking away, but with multiple opponents collapsing around him. Second, his footwork is exceptional, as he starts and stops on a time, and will change direction in a deceptive fashion. Need a guy on that wall? Call Reedy, who went 5-3 on draws but didn’t receive the amount of ice time he deserved.\n\nLHD David Farrance (5’11/191, Boston University): That’s two straight viewings where Farrance has impressed us with just about everything. He quarterbacked the top power play unit, where he used speed and gear shifting to slice through the neutral zone and set up plays. His hand-eye coordination is exceptional, and he needed it to corrall some tough passes in his skates or beyond his reach. He made a coast-to-coast rush for a stuff-in attempt, and used a 150-foot bank pass to spring a teammate for a clean zone entry. Farrance is an offense-first defender whose current command of the ice is veteran like, but he’ll need to get stronger to deal with the kind of power forwards who gave him trouble over the weekend. He had four shots on goal but passed up a handful of open looks.\n\nLHD Max Gildon (6’3/188, Wisconsin): The night was a bit of an adventure for this big defender, and we were a bit disappointed that the crash-and-bang style of the Harvard game made him seem uncomfortable. He had a body in his face every time he turned to get the puck, leading so some inaccurate breakout passes and hasty clearing attempts. Gildon made an excellent 100-foot head man that led to a scoring chance, but he was caught gazing and overcommitted for a 2-on-1 that went the other way. Gildon has promise — you notice his upside even in the face of a struggle. But the logjam of quality two-way defenders at the NTDP level tells us the native Texan would be better off heading to the CHL (The WHL’s Vancouver Giants own his rights) where he’ll probably have a better opportunity to showcase his size/skill combination. He did, however, play very well on the penalty kill.\n\nRHD John Maniscalco (6’1/200): It looked as if Maniscalco was Team USA’s eighth defenseman and the high amount of special teams play is probably why we didn’t see him on the ice as much. The only time he was noticed was when he overcommitted and was slow to react to a puck rusher that had an open lane to the cage.\n\nRHD Tommy Miller (6’2/177, Michigan State): Miller was one of two Team USA defenseman (Knoepke being the other) who was responsible with the puck from start to finish. As stated in previous reports, he’s not flashy. But the score would have been far more lopsided had the NTDP’ers lack the kind of defensive-zone reliability Miller consistently provides. He saw a lot of action against Harvard’s power play and was always positioned to interdict point shots and cross-ice feeds.\n\nLHD Quinn Hughes (5’9/167, Michigan/2018 Draft): Hughes is an excellent skater — probably the best the NTDP’s had in terms of recent defensemen. His instincts and reads were strong, and not once did we see him hesitate or look unsure the second the puck was on his stick. Hughes got the chance to quarterback a late-game power play, displaying incredibly soft hands and the kind of confidence to take the puck to the net via the shortest routes possible. He’s not big (5’9, 167), but he took hits to complete plays and was one of the better Team USA blueliners in terms of handling Harvard’s pressure-packed forecheck.\n\nLW Brady Tkachuk (6’2/194, Boston University/2018 Draft): Tkachuk was a wrecking ball who played fearless, at times a bit out of control. It was a chippy affair, so Tkachuk naturally involved himself any chance he could. He seems to have a quicker first step than brother Matt but lacks in the playmaking department. He’s still a pup and has a two full seasons to hone his game before the 2018 draft rolls around."
