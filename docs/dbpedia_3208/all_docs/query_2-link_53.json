        "text": "Updated: 2021-03-20\n\nThis list highlights the differences between Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. It started as an exam night’s note, the kind we scribble while preparing for our exams. In preparation for my MCSE exams (70-290 and 70-270,) I created this list in OneNote. Over a year, I expanded it. All of this was before 2004.\n\nHaving been written in a OneNote notebook, this note survived the exam day and the day after it. It stayed where it was until September 2010, when I wrote this blog post. I was trying to give a semblance of order to my poorly organized notes that day. I deleted many of them, as they had outlived their usefulness. I didn’t feel like deleting this one, though. Instead, I copied and pasted it in my blog. Call me nostalgic if you want, but emotions run deep in us humans.\n\nI, however, never anticipated how popular it may become, given that at the time of its publication, it was already outdated. Each year, it is among the ten most-read posts. So, I decided to make it look less like a piece of garbage whose existence is an offense to the English language.\n\nIdentity\n\nNotwithstanding all their similarities and differences, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 identify themselves differently. Windows XP identifies itself as “Microsoft Windows NT 5.1”. Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP x64 Edition identify themselves as “Microsoft Windows NT 5.2”. Microsoft has since added new functions to the Windows API to help the apps determine whether they are running on Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.\n\nPhilosophy and target market\n\nServer computers running Windows Server 2003 operate unattended round the clock, with no keyboard or monitor attached. A server computer is perhaps most productive without a user having logged onto its console. A user session consumes resources, after all.\n\nIn contrast, Windows XP computers operate only when a user is sitting in front of them. Without a user, it is optimal to turn them off to avoid unnecessary power consumption.\n\nDefault security settings\n\nInternet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration: This is an exclusive feature of Windows Server 2003 and prevents people from browsing the web comfortably on mission-critical servers. When enabled, Internet Explorer challenges every attempt to open a URL outside its Trusted Zone. When disabled, Internet Explorer still warns the users about the dangers of web surfing on servers.\n\nShutdown Event Tracker: By default, this feature is enabled on Windows Server 2003 and disabled on Windows XP. It challenges every attempt to shut the machine down with bureaucracy! If the computer loses power, this feature will interrogate the user about it on the next startup.\n\nShutdown restriction: On Windows XP, anyone can issue a shutdown command without even logging in. Windows Server 2003, however, the shutdown command requires administrative privileges.\n\nError Reporting Queue Mode: This is an exclusive feature of Windows Server 2003. Unless disabled, it causes Windows to postpone Error Reporting prompts until the next logon. Server apps usually run unattended. So, when they crash, there is nobody to see the Error Reporting prompt. This feature is not perfect, though. It suppresses the Error Reporting prompts even when there is someone at the console. It leaves the user to wonder why an app window vanished without a trace.\n\nSecure attention requirement: By default, this feature is enabled in Windows Server 2003 and disabled in Windows XP. Once enabled, Windows requires the user to press the Ctrl+Alt+Delete key combination each time before logging on or unlocking the computer. The goal of this feature is to prevent logon spoofing. Windows kernel is specifically on the lookout for this key combination, preventing malware from mimicking it. The only way to wrest control of the Ctrl+Alt+Delete handling from Windows is to subvert its kernel.\n\nVolume automounting: The Enterprise and Datacenter editions of Windows Server 2003, by default, do not automatically assign a drive letter to newly installed fixed disks, while Windows XP and other editions of Windows Server 2003 do so. The rationale for this behavior is SAN support. One can configure the volume automounting behavior in these editions of Windows via the DiskPart.exe command-line utility.\n\nNo-Execute (NX) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP): This feature protects the operating system and its apps from buffer overrun attacks. By default, on Windows XP, this feature only protects apps that specifically request it. Nearly all Microsoft and Adobe apps at the time did so. Windows Server 2003, however, applies this feature to all apps except those that administrators exclude.\n\nMemory dump: Windows creates a memory dump file after a stop error (also known as the Blue Screen of Death.) By default, Windows Server 2003 creates a complete memory dump while Windows XP only creates a small memory dump. Wanna-be security resources never fail to mention that an intruder may be able to gain highly valuable information from a complete memory dump. However, they conveniently fail to mention that a complete memory dump is at least as large as the system memory plus one megabyte and is saved in the Windows folder. Therefore, intruders are going to have a hard time accessing it. By the time they reach it, they already have full control of the server.\n\nUser experience\n\nProcessor scheduling: While allocating CPU attention, Windows Server gives priority to background process while Windows XP favors visible windows.\n\nMemory usage: Unlike Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 allocates more memory to the system cache instead of running programs.\n\nWindows Update: (There is something different here, but I forgot what.)\n\nFirewall: By default, this feature is disabled on Windows Server 2003 but enabled on Windows XP. Note that with Windows Firewall disabled, simple Internet Connection Sharing also doesn’t work.\n\nThe Start menu items: Windows Server 2003 configures the default Start menu differently to bring the administrators up to speed. For example, Control Panel is in menu mode.\n\nWindows Media Player 11: Windows Server 2003 SP2 comes with Windows Media Player 10. One cannot install Windows Media Player 11 on it. For a very long time, one couldn’t install it on Windows XP x64 Edition either.\n\nWindows Messenger: Windows Server 2003 does not come with the vaunted Windows Messenger. Good riddance.\n\nServices\n\nWindows Server 2003 comes with many of its services disabled to improve performance and reduce the attack surface. After all, it is common to have server boxes without any displays, mice, or keyboards, let alone optical disc writers, scanners, webcams, speakers, headphones, or joysticks.\n\nBy default, the following services are disabled on Windows Server 2003:\n\nThemes\n\nIMAPI CD-Burning COM Service\n\nWindows Image Acquisition\n\nWindows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing (altogether excluded from some editions of Windows Server 2003)\n\nWindows Audio\n\nAdditionally, Windows Server 2003 doesn’t enable DirectDraw, Direct3D, and hardware acceleration for the video subsystem. One must use DXDIAG.EXE to activate DirectDraw and Direct3D. After that, one can use the Advanced Settings page of the Display applet in the Control Panel to set the hardware acceleration level to “full”.\n\nDevice driver support\n\nThe device drivers included with Windows XP are different from those included with Windows Server. For instance, Windows Server 2003 comes with a broader set of drivers for network adapters. In contrast, Windows XP comes with additional drivers for gaming hardware. They can still download the missing device drivers from Microsoft.\n\nMissing components\n\nThe following components are not included in Windows Server 2003:\n\nSystem Restore\n\nSimple File Sharing\n\nFast User Switching\n\nUser Accounts applet in the Control Panel\n\nWelcome Screen\n\nSecurity Center\n\nClassic games\n\nMini-Setup\n\n3-D arcade pinball game\n\n48×48 user account avatars\n\nSome minor shell services\n\nExclusive components\n\nThe following features are exclusively included with Windows Server 2003 but note that the list is incomplete. The full list fills books.\n\nWindows Server kernel (Supports more diverse options for symmetric multiprocessing)\n\nActive Directory (Later renamed Active Directory Domain Services, this is the main reason for installing Windows Server)\n\nClustering services (Enables network load balancing and failover clustering)\n\nDHCP Server services\n\nDNS Server services\n\nFull version of dynamic volume support and NTFS file system (Supports spanned, stripped, mirrored and RAID-5 volumes)\n\nFull version of file and printer sharing services (No longer restricted to 10 concurrent connections)\n\nFull version of Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0\n\nFull version of Microsoft networking stack including IPv6, SMB, TCP/IP, 802.1x and Kerberos\n\nFull version of Terminal Services (later renamed Remote Desktop Services)\n\nLicensing services\n\nManage Your Server (It gathers the configuration and monitoring tools in one screen. It starts each time an administrator logs into the server.)\n\nMicrosoft Certificate Services\n\nMicrosoft Storage Services, including Distributed File System\n\nMicrosoft Windows Media Services\n\nRouting and remote access services\n\nShadow Copy\n\nWINS services\n\nWindows Desktop Deployment Services (formerly Remote Installation Services)\n\nWindows SharePoint Services (not to be mistaken with Microsoft Office SharePoint Services)"
