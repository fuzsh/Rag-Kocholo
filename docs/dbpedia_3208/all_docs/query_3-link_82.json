But now I have to upgrade since I can't get my USB-wlan drivers to install (the old PCMCIA network card broke).\n\nI would prefer to install Windows XP but I have no spare licence, but I do have a Windows Server 2003 licence.\n\nDo you think it's possible (and usable) to squeeze in 2003 on this computer?\n\nEdit:\n\nUnfortunately 2003 simply refuses to install on the laptop. It hangs with an error message (paraphrased)\n\n2003 has detected a problem with your computer and has halted the installation to prevent damage. And then some error codes\n\nThis happens very early in the installation while it's copying the installation files just after I accepted the licence.\n\nSo I give up for now."
