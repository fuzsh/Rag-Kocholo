We can Ping and RDP to the Servers using the host name and IP.\n\nAlso we can access the shares on the Windows 2003 shares via IP, but not by host name.\n\nHowever on the Windows 2003 boxes I can access all shares.\n\nAny ideas? I am at a last now.\n\nWAG here, if you are trying to access the shares on those old servers with Windows 10 or greater it’s likely they won’t connect due to old, insecure connection types.\n\nUsing EOL servers is a bad idea, not just for security reasons, but for situations like this.\n\nPlease let us know what OS your clients are using."
