To no avail.\n\nI have also tried putting the probe service account in the list of users in Component Services\\Computers\\My Computer properties\\Access Permissions, even though the probe service account is part of Domain Administrators and should already have been included through that group. To no avail.\n\nI also tried using SNMP instead of WMI; no success.\n\n– These issues only happen with Windows Server 2003, our 2012 and 2016 machines work fine.\n\nHi Michael!\n\nI have indeed tried the WMI Tester, but I have no idea what it should give on a succeeded attempt nor on a failed attempt. At the very least, it doesn’t give the RPC thingy not found error.\n\n–\n\nIs this what it should be giving on a success? I am running this from our probe server, contacting one of the 2003 VM’s\n\nThank you Michael,\n\nI have just gotten this confirmed by your coworker Dariusz Gorka through the support@paessler.com as well.\n\nFurthermore he added:\n\n\" There are also no plans to change that or to address that as those operating systems are no longer supported by Microsoft. Especially Windows Server 2003 is considered as EOL since a couple of years (July 14, 2015). Windows Server 2008 becomes EOL next year (January 14, 2020).\"\n\nIt is unfortunate for me, but completely understandable from Paessler’s point of view.\n\nMaybe I finally have the turning argument now to use against my C.E.O. to allow the replacement of these servers"
