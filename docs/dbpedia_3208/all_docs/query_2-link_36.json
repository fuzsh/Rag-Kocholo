        "text": "As discussed in our last blog, after 12 years of service, Microsoft is finally pulling the plug on Windows Server® 2003, as extended support ends today. To avoid problems with software compatibility, security weaknesses and general operating system failures, any business still reliant on Server 2003 must take action immediately.\n\nHere, we outline the pros and cons for each of the available operating systems, so you have the information you need to make a more informed purchasing decision.\n\nThe Low-down on Windows Server® 2008\n\nOffering support for both i386 and x64 architectures, Windows Server 2008 was the last Microsoft operating system to work with 32-bit processors. Server 2008 is the second oldest Microsoft operating system still in use and it assists with older hardware, but does not offer many benefits for an updated data storage architecture.\n\nPros\n\nWindows Server 2008 still supports 32-bit architecture, making it the only “up to date” option for old i386 systems.\n\nProvides native support for Windows® XP and Vista clients.\n\nCons\n\nNow four generations out-of-date, Windows Server 2008 is decidedly behind the curve in supporting new technologies.\n\nMainstream support for Server 2008 has already ended, expiring on January 13th There will be no further developments or enhancements to this product in future and you may have to take out a maintenance agreement with Microsoft\n\nWindows Server® 2008 R2 - what's different?\n\nWindows Server 2008 R2 marked the end of the road for the venerable i386 processor architecture by becoming Microsoft’s first 64-bit only release. The need for increasing computing power meant that the 3.2GB memory limit inherent in the 32-bit architecture was holding back development, and so it was decided to remove i386 support.\n\nDespite sharing the same name as its predecessor, Windows 2008 R2 is considerably different under the user interface, being the server equivalent of Windows 7.\n\nPros\n\nIncludes all of the benefits of Server 2008 plus:\n\nPerfect for managing a Windows® 7 desktop environment.\n\nSolid, robust and trusted platform that has proven its worth in the workplace.\n\nExtended support is ongoing until 2020, giving Server 2008 R2 users another 5 years to upgrade or migrate.\n\nLast version of Windows Server to support the Itanium processor range.\n\nCons\n\nLegacy 32-bit applications may run slightly slower than on Server 2008.\n\nThree generations old, Windows Server 2008 R2 is still behind the curve in supporting new technologies like Windows® 8.1 and the forthcoming Windows® 10.\n\nMainstream support for Server 2008 has already ended, expiring on January 13th There will be no further developments or enhancements to this product in future.\n\nExtended support is a paid service and may require enrolment in a maintenance program.\n\nIncoming Windows Server® 2012\n\nBuilding on the solid code base behind Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 added a number of new security features designed to help businesses cope with the challenges of modern computing like Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and virtual computing. Also of particular interest was the introduction of an automated data deduplication system designed to help systems administrators manage their ever expanding information store by identifying and removing duplicate data and files.\n\nPros\n\nMicrosoft will fully support the product until September 2018, during which period the product will still have enhancements and improvements. Extended support ends in October 2023.\n\nOffers the best blend of security and functionality for a Windows 7 desktop environment.\n\nA new Hyper-V version that offers significant improvements for virtual server computing.\n\nCons\n\nWindows Server 2016 will replace Server 2012 at some point early next year.\n\nDoes not support the Itanium range of processors.\n\nCannot upgrade directly from Windows Server 2003 or 2003 R2.\n\nWindows Server® 2012 R2 - newly improved\n\nDesigned to assist with the management of the new Windows® 8 desktop operating system, Server 2012 R2 improves upon many of the features first seen in Server 2012 and is the most up-to-date server operating system currently available from Microsoft.\n\nPros\n\nIncludes all of the benefits of Server 2012 plus:\n\nThe best choice for managing a Windows 8 and 8.1 desktop environment.\n\nMicrosoft will fully support the product until September 2018, during which period the product will still have enhancements and improvements. Extended support ends in October 2023.\n\nIs the most up-to-date version of Windows Server available.\n\nCons\n\nWindows Server 2016 will replace Server 2012 at some point next year.\n\nAnd... What About the Future?\n\nAs mentioned above, Windows Server® 2016 is less than a year away, offering further core improvements including native support for the new Windows 10 desktop operating system. Other enhancements that have already been shown to developers and early adopters include storage replication for better management and protection of data, a soft restart function that avoids full reboots by resetting software and a new IIS 10 web server component.\n\nUltimately it usually pays to choose the latest version of any operating system because it provides the best balance between longevity, features and return on investment. That said, there are occasionally reasons to choose an older version of Windows Server, such as hardware limitations like those described above. Just to note, when buying a completely new server, Windows 2012 R2 is the only option that Microsoft approves."
