        "text": "As of December 2nd, 2019, Rapid7 will start the End-of-Life (EOL) process for Windows Server 2003 support on the Insight Agent. This process will conclude on December 2nd, 2020, after which the Insight Agent will no longer officially support Windows Server 2003 as an endpoint operating system.\n\nAs Rapid7 moves toward more scalable solutions for our customers, we are enhancing the functionality of our Insight Agent, which allows you to collect data from across your IT environment—in the cloud and on-premises.\n\nTo improve performance and security and increase the speed of feature development, we will be using the latest version of Python. The latest version, Python 3.8.0, which was released October 14th, 2019, doesn’t support Windows Server 2003. Please see https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/ for more information.\n\nEvent\n\nDescription\n\nDate\n\nProduct/Feature Migrations\n\nIf you are currently using Windows Server 2003, you can:\n\nContinue to use the Insight Agent on Windows Server 2003 without support from Rapid7.\n\nUpdate the Windows operating system to a Rapid7 supported version.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThe Insight Agent will likely continue to run on your Windows Server 2003 endpoints after the EOL date. However, any interoperability defects due to the Windows Server 2003 operating system will not be addressed by Rapid7. In addition, customers running Windows Server 2003 will not benefit from improved performance and security with future releases of the Insight Agent.\n\nYes, the Insight Agent will continue to receive content updates that specify the data needed to be collected in order to assess the system for vulnerabilities. It is likely, however, that most of these updates will not be applicable to Windows Server 2003 systems as security patches are rarely published by Microsoft for EOL software.\n\nMore Information\n\nContact your Rapid7 Customer Success Representative or Support team.\n\nFor new customers interested in the Insight Agent, contact sales@rapid7.com."
