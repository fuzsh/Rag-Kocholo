        "text": "It has been well publicized that on July 14th, 2015 Microsoft discontinues product support for its Windows 2003 Server software, which was released in 2003. This means that running Windows 2003 Server when the product is obsolete (after support ends), will increase the risk of technology being affected by cybercriminals attempting to do harm. Also Windows Server 2003 is a 32-bit software, and virtually everything is 64-bit now. Companies are abandoning 32-bit apps for 64-bit apps. So don't expect to update your old applications.\n\nThe end of Microsoft Windows 2003 Server edition support means...\n\nMicrosoft will no longer provide hot fixes, product updates, technical support, and-most importantly-security updates. Without critical updates, your Server(s) will be susceptible to attacks that take advantage of vulnerabilities. These attacks not only cause downtime but can also put your customers' information or your own business data at risk.\n\nOnce support ends on July 14th, 2015, , your organization will likely fail to meet industry compliance standards such as HIPAA, PCI, SOX and Dodd-Frank, just to name a few. People in fields impacted by this regulation will likely shut you out and refuse interconnections.\n\nMost software and hardware vendors will no longer support products that are running on Windows 2003, as they are unable to get Windows updates.\n\nDowntime: The risks of system failure and business disruption could increase because of the End of Support, lack of supported software, and aging Server hardware running Windows 2003, even a system running an updated anti-virus.\n\nThe best option is to migrate to a modern operating system like Microsoft Windows 2008 or Windows 2012."
