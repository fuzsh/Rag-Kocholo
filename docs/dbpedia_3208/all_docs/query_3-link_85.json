It's just a lag between it being officially released and the site updating to its official final status. Also, SP2 is now a high priority update on Windows Update which means it's RTM not RC2.

I'll play with it at work, since it will be coming down the line.\n\nI found some discrepanices between the my MS Press book and the supplied Server 2003 software. Expecially in the first section - installing AD and DNS. There seemed to be additional steps in what Sever 2003 showed to what the book described. I feel this could be dangerous espcially if the 70-290 uses a lot of simulation tasks.\n\nAdding SP2 to the Server may change a particlular way of changing settings or doing something etc. within 2003.\n\n0 ·\n\nthank you for this heads up.\n\ndownloading it now and will deploy in productions server soon.\n\nlets see what it breaks. hehe....maybe it breaks VSS again...haha\n\nthank you.\n\nmean people SUCK !!!

In any case, I just use the defaults. But, in their Figure 1-4, they seem to have been able to configure a static IP - an option I don't get this option following their steps. They also seem to have DHCP installed. Again, I don't get this option. And these aren't mentioned in any of their steps.\n\nI have tried this on a stand alone network but get the same discrepancies.\n\n0 ·\n\nWindows Server SP2\n\nThings it has broken at various sites I support :\n\n- ISA 2004 (suddenly blocked SBS DHCP server )\n\n- RRAS VPN\n\n- Internal Outlook 2003 (could not see exchange server)RPC connector issues.\n\nThis can all be fixed if latest NIC drivers are installed and a couple of reg hacks.\n\nThanks Microsoft for the many sleepless nights.\n\nIsn't Bill such a Great Guy!!!!\n\n0 ·\n\nSWM wrote:\n\nWindows Server SP2\n\nThings it has broken at various sites I support :\n\n- ISA 2004 (suddenly blocked SBS DHCP server )\n\n- RRAS VPN\n\n- Internal Outlook 2003 (could not see exchange server)RPC connector issues.\n\nThis can all be fixed if latest NIC drivers are installed and a couple of reg hacks.\n\nThanks Microsoft for the many sleepless nights.\n\nThanks for the info.
