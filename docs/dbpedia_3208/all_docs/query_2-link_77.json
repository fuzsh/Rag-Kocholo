I encourage you to support this as we have a great need of it. We are using Acronis and don't want to use that anymore since Veeam is much better. Let me know after you speak to the devs/managers if you can simply remove the restriction and let us use it on windows server 2003 at our own risk or something to that effect.\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Mike Resseler » May 08, 2015 3:08 pm this post\n\nHi Joshua,\n\nTrust me, we know your pain. Unfortunately, just removing the restriction won't help your cause as we are using technology in the product that simply doesn't exist in Windows server 2003.\n\nBut if you really, really want to try anyway (but I have no idea what the results are going to be at all...) you can use a zip tool to open the exe, find .msi files inside and use Orka (or something) to bypass the restriction (I have heard that is the way people are doing it to test it on Windows 10 and server vNext...)\n\nBut that is of course not supported\n\nMike\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Dima P. » May 08, 2015 4:37 pm this post\n\nMike,\n\nbut I have no idea what the results are going to be at all...\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not going to work anyway.\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by AIM_joshuag » May 11, 2015 12:52 pm this post\n\nCan we install the missing technology that is required for Veeam to work on Server 2003?\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Mike Resseler » May 11, 2015 12:54 pm this post\n\nNo,\n\nThat technology is inside the OS and is just not working on 2003 (not even on 2008... it needs to be 2008 R2 SP1 or later)\n\nSorry\n\nMike\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by SimonEdwardsLP » Apr 13, 2017 9:35 am this post\n\nIs there any 3rd party tools that can be used to back up Win2003 and still allow it to be stored on the Veeam repository?\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Dima P. » Apr 13, 2017 6:09 pm this post\n\nSimon,\n\nYou may try native windows backup tools, but that won’t integrate with VBR\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by DannyMurphy » Jan 03, 2018 1:14 pm this post\n\nApologies for replying to an older thread.\n\nIs there any possibility of this happening now with the new update? Using B&R to manage it on it a different server perhaps?\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Dima P. » Jan 03, 2018 3:38 pm this post\n\nHello and welcome to the community Danny,\n\nUnfortunately, Windows Server 2003 remains unsupported.\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by DannyMurphy » Jan 03, 2018 5:14 pm this post\n\nB&R can backup a virtual machine running 2003 though correct? At least for a workaround that way?\n\nRe: Windows 2003 support\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Dima P. » Jan 03, 2018 5:25 pm this post\n\nDanny,\n\nYes, VM backup can be used to protect Windows Server 2003 SP1 VMs. Kindly, take a look at Platform Support article for Veeam B&R."
