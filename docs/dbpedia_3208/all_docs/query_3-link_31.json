        "text": "After years of development and months of beta testing, Windows Server 2003 R2 has finally gone RTM. The R2 update is the first major update to the OS since last year's Service Pack 1, and includes some major new functionality in addition to the requisite batch of bugfixes and random changes.\n\nDuring the development process, Microsoft actively engaged the IT community to help identify the features and improvements that enterprises needed most. The result is a list of features including branch office network optimizations, improved identity and access management, an improved storage stack, and a refresh of Microsoft's latest web server technologies. Also included is an updated licensing model for Virtual Server, a technology that allows for multiple virtual instances of Windows Server on one physical server.\n\nThe benefits are particularly great for remote offices: Microsoft has added a robust Distributed File System Replication service (DFS-R) that leverages modern bandwidth-saving technologies such as differential transfers and local caching for improved WAN availability. Even the remote management tools get a boost, with a greater set of capabilities present in MMC and PMC that are designed to eliminate the need for administrators to go on site.\n\nHowever, these improvements aside, this is a largely incremental release of the platform. No major SDK or DDK changes are included. Microsoft has a history of being slow to change the Server product, and IT departments have a corresponding reluctance to change what's working. The next server release (aside from service packs) will likely be Longhorn Server, but that is still a couple of years away at this point."
