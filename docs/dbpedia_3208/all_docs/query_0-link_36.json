Now we get\n\nThe following error occurred attempting to join the domain xxxxx\n\nThe specified network name is no longer available.\n\nIP is good. Connectivity is good. Can see DCs and, when tried, get DHCP from them.\n\nDNS points to good servers. Servers return valid IPs for other machines.\n\nTried deleting PC from AD. Tried recreating record.\n\nTried joining domain under a different name. No good.\n\nTried removing/rejoining other PCs. No problem.\n\nRecent changes since last reboot: demoted an old DC in the same site and removed its DNS and DFS roles.\n\nThe 2003 server in question is a simple setup with file sharing and runs a light app that uses MSSQL.\n\nScoured the net to no avail. Any help is welcome.\n\n@Microsoft\n\nYou said DNS is good, but is it using your internal DCs for DNS? If no, make it so, If yes try joining the domain by using a DCs IP address - this if it works indicates a DNS issue.\n\nWhy is a server using DHCP anyway?\n\nCan you connect to \\IPaddressofDC\\admin$ - are you prompted for credentials?\n\nBackups: I have the data backed up. But, of course, the restore program is on the server. It’s an old copy of CA Backup. We’re re-installing that now so we can recover the files.\n\nThe system as a whole isn’t backed up to the point where I could do a bare-metal restore. It’s a legacy system and we were in the process of trying to unwind ourselves from it. It ran everything.\n\nEvent viewer isn’t showing any error that appears to be directly related to the attempt to join.\n\nYes, it’s using the internal DC for DNS. It uses a fixed IP, but we tried DHCP to verify that it could talk to the server at all. It’s back on fixed.\n\nTried to map a drive to \\10.40.8.1\\admin$\n\nError = The mapped network drive could not be created because…The specified network name is no longer available.\n\nFrom the server, I can ping 10.40.8.19 and 10.40.8.29 (DCs) both by IP and name. But I cannot browse to them.\n\nthe NIC has DNS set to 10.40.8.19 and 10.40.8.29.\n\nTried changing the nic dns to 10.30.8.19 and 10.30.8.29. Join domain failed."
