        "text": "Hi @WinTechie ,\n\nAs Dave mentioned, there's no support available for Windows Server 2003 anymore.\n\nMicrosoft did release hotfixes for the WannaCry / Petya vulnerabilities:\n\nhttps://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/\n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-old-techniques-petya-adds-worm-capabilities\n\nAs your application servers are no longer supported and at high risk for vulnerabilities, I would highly advise to keep them in a as closed environment as possible to lesser the chance of vulnerability risk.\n\n----------\n\n(If the reply was helpful please don't forget to upvote and/or accept as answer, thank you)\n\nBest regards,\n\nLeon\n\nHi,\n\nThank you for posting in our forum.\n\nAs the two MVPs said, the 2003 version is too old and Windows Server 2003 no longer supports it.\n\nHope this information can help you\n\nBest wishes\n\nVicky"
