        "text": "Upgrading reduces your energy costs, brings you cost-effective storage and built-in disaster recovery. In the long term, servers running Windows Server® 2012 R2 REDUCE your costs and improve security.\n\nAside from the obvious security risks, here are the top 3 benefits you’ll receive from upgrading to Windows Server® 2003:\n\n1) Run Your Systems with the Latest Technology\n\nCapabilities: Windows Server® 2012 R2 is a big step forward and brings new capabilities and features including virtualization, cost-effective storage, remote access and reliable disaster recovery.\n\nVirtualization: Virtualization allows users to get more from each server and eliminate server sprawl (i.e. poor hardware resource utilization, poor system and software level security, and wasted energy).\n\nReduce Your Energy Costs: Old hardware and software cost more to run and maintain than newer, energy efficient systems. Upgrading can actually reduce your energy costs.\n\n2) Receive Improved Security and Full Support\n\nWindows Server® 2012 R2 brings increased security, built-in disaster recovery and includes warranties for parts and service. In 2013, Microsoft released 37 critical updates for Windows Server 2003.\n\nAfter July 14th, 2015, NO new updates will be released. This means unsupported servers are more likely to be attacked by malicious parties. As we’ve seen with other types of software vulnerabilities, without question, your business will be at risk if you are running Windows Server 2003 after support has ended.\n\n3) More Powerful Servers and Peace of Mind\n\nBetter Performance: With better performance and scalability, Windows Server® 2012 R2 is designed to meet the needs of businesses.\n\nFrom easier remote access, to a consistent user experience, as your company grows and expands into the future, you’ll have the resources and flexibility you need in a server.\n\nFast and Easy Set-up: Pre-installed for simplicity, set-up is faster and easier with improved performance, simplified management and more affordable storage options.\n\nPeace of Mind: With end of support near, many businesses are making the upgrade simply for the peace of mind, knowing if the unexpected occurs, their business will recover quickly and their data is protected.\n\nRemember, end of support for Windows Server® 2003 is July 14, 2015, which will be here before you know it.\n\nA smooth migration is dependent upon having enough lead-time, so this is not the time to procrastinate since the risks and costs significantly increase the longer you wait.\n\n“But We Don’t Have the Time or Resources to Handle a Migration Project Right Now.”\n\nThat’s why we’re here. It’s easier to upgrade now than waiting until end of support makes things more challenging.\n\nYou might be surprised (as many of our clients are) that upgrading is more reasonable than you expected and certainly, that the benefits far outweigh the risks.\n\nContact Ontech Systems at (262) 522-8560 or schedule a Free Network Discovery where we can put together a plan that will show you exactly what it would take."
