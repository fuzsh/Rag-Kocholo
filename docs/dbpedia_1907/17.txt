MAC Techno Cumbia Blush Duo

MAC Techno Cumbia Blush Duo ($29.00 for TBA oz.) is blush duo that features a split-pan with more of the deeper shade (Blunt) and a smaller portion of the lighter shade (Ven Conmigo). The smaller blush is hard to apply on its own, as it doesn’t accommodate the average blush brush well, and even my smaller blush brushes were too large and I had to pinch the brush head to get it to narrow and fit in the area. This was the weakest product in the collection, so I figured we’d get it out of the way.

Blunt is described as a “muted golden brown.” It’s a dark, rosy brown–almost plummy–with a mostly matte finish. It looked warmer and more like that “golden brown” in the pan, but it darkened up a lot and looked much cooler in tone (though still warm overall) swatched on my arm as well as on my cheeks. I am warm-toned, so things looking cooler than they do in the pan is usually not something I experience! The texture was fairly soft, moderately blendable, but it wasn’t the best texture for such an intense, pigmented blush as it required extra work to blend and diffuse the color. It wore well for almost nine hours on me before I noticed fading. Chanel Plum Attraction (LE, $45.00) is lighter, cooler (90% similar). MAC Tea Petal (P, $21.00) is lighter, brighter (85% similar). Make Up For Ever S404 (P, $23.00) is lighter, brighter, warmer (80% similar). MAC Earthshine (LE, $34.00) is more shimmery (90% similar). ColourPop Trippin' (LE, $12.00) is more shimmery, lighter, cooler (85% similar). Viseart Bronze #3 (PiP, ) is lighter, warmer (85% similar). MAC Film Noir (P, $24.00) is darker (80% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side.

Ven Conmigo is described as a “beige pink.” It’s a soft, medium rosy mauve with warm undertones and a matte finish. The texture was firm and difficult to get color out of; I had to scrape at the top layer to get enough powder off the surface to even show up on the skin. It wore well for six hours on me before fading.

Tarte Royal (LE, $29.00) is cooler (90% similar). Makeup Geek Puppy Love (P, $10.00) is darker (90% similar). LORAC Cinematic (P, $23.00) is darker (90% similar). Anastasia Blank (PiP, ) is darker (90% similar). See comparison swatches / view dupes side-by-side.
