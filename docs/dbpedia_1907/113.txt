Techno Cumbia (English Translation) Lyrics

Artist: Selena

Album: 12 Super Exitos

Please remember! This translation is my personal work. It is sometimes difficult to translate word for word from Spanish to English, so it may sound awkward in one languange when it is perfectly natural in the other. But I think you can get the general idea!

If you've come to dance

Well then let's have some fun

If you've come to sleep,

Get out of here

This is the rhythm of my cumbia

that's going to move you

the techno-cumbia that I bring you

will please you

so that you move your body

from head to foot

And now that we're partying,

everybody say:

Hey, hey, oh, oh

Hey! Don't leave me alone

This blowout (burst) is for everyone

If you've come to dance

Well then let's have some fun

If you've come to sleep,

Get out of here

Because this song isn't for any lazy people

If you're still sitting, throw your chair to one side

Dance, dance without stopping

There's no time for resting

This dance is for you

I want to see you sweat

Move it over here, move it over there

This is the new dance called technocumbia

I look around and I'm noticing something

that there are some people who are not dancing

Dance, dance without stopping

There's no time to rest

This dance is for you

I want to see you sweat

Move it over here, move it over there

This is the new dance called technocumbia

Look at Juan he can't even move

well his shoes are heavy

he must have tracked in a lot of mud

Look at Maria she doesn't move from her seat

that's what always happens

when you eat too many tortillas

Look at Jose well he's just sitting there

He drank too many beers

and now he walks sideways

Look at Rosa she doesn't want to get up

because her stockings are torn

Don't go looking at her

Move it, move it, and stop

Move it, move it, and stop

Move it, move it, and stop

Don't move it so much, stop
