        "text": "Welcome to Lifestream, where Teen Vogue's writers take music one step further and discuss how the biggest and best songs on your favorite playlists turn into the soundtracks of our lives.\n\nThe summer of 1995 was the one that my dad listened to Selena's last album — Dreaming of You, the one that was released posthumously — on repeat. I remember this vividly: It was hot, as summers in Los Angeles always are, and we'd drive around in the black Suburban, love songs on full blast. The CD would skip every time we hit a speed bump, and every time \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" ended, I'd ask to listen to it again.\n\nSometimes we'd listen to the radio instead, but it didn't matter. We heard Selena there, too. It wasn't just the Spanish-language stations, either; the DJs who played the top 40 hits kept the Tejana singer on repeat. And if we couldn't find her on the radio, we'd go back to the CD.\n\nEvery time I asked my dad to tell me about Selena, he would talk about how important it was to support artists and music from Mexico. \"Even if some of these songs aren't in Spanish?\" I'd ask, citing the songs whose words I actually understood. As if to underscore a point, he'd turn on Amor Prohibido and that was that.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't matter, he'd tell me. She's Mexican. Language doesn't change that.\n\nHe did not tell me, his 5-year-old daughter, that Selena was also American, born in Lake Jackson, Texas. Or that she did not grow up speaking Spanish at home but wanted to learn anyway — a fact I wish he told me because I didn't, either. He'd say she had been shot by the manager of her fan club, but wouldn't elaborate any further. He didn't tell me she was dead — he always talked about her in the present tense — and that the radio stations and the CD and the T-shirts people sold in downtown LA were all to commemorate the loss of a superstar. To me, Selena was very much alive. She sure sounded that way in her music, which we listened to over, and over, and over. We'd hit a speed bump, and I'd go right back to mimicking the call and repeats in \"Techno Cumbia.\" I didn't know what I was saying, but it didn't matter. I sang along anyway.\n\nMy dad came to America before he learned English. Even after he took classes, I remember him practicing with me while I did my homework. We got a lot of verb tenses wrong. My teacher would go over my homework methodically, explaining the concepts I — we, really — didn't understand. I didn't mind, though. It felt special, like we were in on this together.\n\nIt never struck me as odd that we didn't speak Spanish much at home. My mom understood the language, because she learned it after she and my dad met. But whenever our family came to visit, they'd practice their English on me and my brother. On our trips to Mexico City, cousins and their friends would ask us to list every bad word we knew. My brother would oblige, but I'd get confused when they talked to me in Spanish; he was always better at translating his thoughts into words than I was.\n\nEven though we looked no different from the rest of our family, we were the American kids, which marked us as other. Their version of going home was to my grandma's house, where my dad and his sisters had grown up, every Sunday. My version of going home was taking a plane back to Los Angeles. When you're little, things like borders don't make much sense. I just knew that something separated me from my cousins, and it was the reason why I didn't understand most of the words they said.\n\nWe agreed on music, though. There were a lot of artists that the Mexican music video channels played that I wasn't so familiar with — I remember one summer where Bon Jovi's \"It's My Life\" played nearly every hour, and there were a lot of artists who I guess were more popular in Europe than they were in the U.S. But they loved the same boy bands I did, and we loved Selena. They listened to the English-language stuff, too, which was surprising to me; wouldn't they want to listen to her other albums, or the ones she released with her family band, Selena y los Dinos? No, they sang along with \"I Could Fall in Love\" phonetically, just like I did with \"Como La Flor.\" Just like Selena did when she first began recording songs in Spanish.\n\nI have spent much of my life trying to figure out where I fit in as a Mexican-American woman — more time than I'd like to admit, if we're being honest. For a long time, my primary aim was to prove to people that I was Mexican enough, maybe to compensate for the fact that I was experiencing less and less of the culture firsthand. When my parents divorced, I grew up with my American mother, while my brother and sister lived with my dad. I learned French in school because the Spanish classes were filled up by the time I enrolled, and I stopped going to Mexico every summer when I turned 16 and got a job. And over time I learned that a lot of people didn't think I was Latinx when they first looked at me, either because I didn't tell people I was right off the bat, or because Hollywood's scope of what a Latinx person looks like is frustratingly narrow.\n\nBut there is always music.\n\nI know where I am and who I am when \"Despacito\" plays on the radio, and when I hear \"Suavemente\" at a party. I feel differently when Jennifer Lopez cues up on a playlist, and my friends notice, too. It's more than something being \"my song.\" It's who I am. Selena's music is that way; it's who I was when I was 5 years old, and who I am now, in English, in Spanish, and all the guitar chords and dancing in between.\n\nLast month, a woman at Walmart yelled at another woman to \"Go back to Mexico!\" when she heard her speaking Spanish. Justin Bieber lost much of the good will he had earned by spearheading the \"Despacito\" remix when he forgot the lyrics to the song and mockingly replaced them with words like \"burrito\" on stage. We have a sitting president who announced his presidency by calling Mexicans entering the country \"rapists\" and campaigning on a platform that promised a border wall. (Let former Mexican president Vicente Fox Quesada explain it – in perfect English, no less: if that wall ever gets built, the country isn't paying for it.)\n\nSpeaking Spanish and not just proclaiming but celebrating your Latinx heritage can feel loaded sometimes. Latinx people are being deported and families are being ripped apart. The cousins who once wanted to visit us don't ask anymore, and I don't blame them. But it's times like these when it feels like celebrating that heritage is more important than ever. They expect fear. We won't give in.\n\nAnd there are moments, mostly when I'm sitting at dinner with my dad, mostly when we're surrounded by people who aren't Latinx, that things feel OK anyway. He'll tell me something in Spanish, and while I may not be able to reply perfectly, I understand. So he lets me listen to him talk about the car or the house or his job and I absorb his words, and the culture he gave me, and I smile because I know.\n\nSelena Quintanilla was from Lake Jackson, Texas. Her father once owned a Tex-Mex restaurant. She and her siblings sang at quinceañeras and at fairs. Her style was influenced by icons like Madonna and Janet Jackson, yes, but it was also influenced by the women around her, the women whose identities existed on both sides of a country line. You can rattle off as many Selena facts as you want, and the through line is usually this: It is impossible to separate the Mexican part of her identity from the American. Because there are no \"parts,\" and you can't parcel a person up like that. They are everything all at once, and she was Mexican and American and Tejana and Chicana all together.\n\nSeeing someone own all of those parts of themselves like she did, on a platform as large as hers, is important. It gave me a roadmap to own all the parts of myself that were similar to, or different from, her or from anyone else in my life. She didn't just use her heritage as an edge to set herself apart from the crowd — in fact, her father was worried that the male-dominated Tejano circuit would reject his daughter's work. It was just a fact about who she was."
