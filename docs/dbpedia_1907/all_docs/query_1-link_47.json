        "text": "La Doña - “Confesiones\"\n\nWe’ve heard singer-songwriter and Bay area activist La Doña fuse the sounds of electronic-pop and cumbia and experiment with hypnotic dembow rhythms on releases like last year’s Can’t Eat Clout EP. Now with her latest single “Confesiones,” La Doña pulls inspiration from the more traditional music that soundtracked her childhood, like banda music and rancheras. The result is a dramatic corrido complete with aching hooks, blazing horns, and a galloping bassline. The track comes as a preview of her forthcoming album, Los Altos De La Soledad, out September 6th, which will coincide with a fall tour across the U.S. – Nayeli Portilo\n\nJass Reyes - “Ellos Si Saben”\n\nLeading her venture as a solo act, Jass Reyes (of Playa Limbo) shares her latest single “Ellos Si Saben.” Produced by Border Boyz, the track is doused in influence from different sonic corners from R&B, dembow and even some electronic moments blended in. The result is a sensual, sun soaked melody finding itself as a backdrop for a relationship in flux between loyalty and the current day common allure of social media temptation. Although topics of validation and the desire for reassurance are on display, the single isn’t one of despair or desperation. Instead, it’s one of self-empowerment, knowing one’s worth and a seductively playful reminder to a partner of what’s in front of them in real life. – Jeanette Diaz\n\njonás, Diego Raposo - “Si De Vdd Me Tienes Ganas”\n\nFollowing the critical success of last year’s Yo No Era Así Pero De Ahora En Adelante, Sí LP, genre-non-conforming Dominican producer Diego Raposo has begun teasing a new batch of projects that’ll come to light throughout August. The first is an atmospheric mini-album titled Buena Vida, Mala Fama, crafted alongside longtime collaborator and Cibaeño crooner Jonás, and unfolding as a delicious melange of R&B, trap, and salsa. Among the many highlights, “Si De Vdd Me Tienes Ganas” is a perfect balance of melancholy and nostalgia. While Raposo whips up beats reminiscent of N.E.R.D.’s Y2K-era supremacy, jonás weaves an anxious tale of romantic limbo, hopelessly crushing on a paramour stuck in a toxic relationship. The song is an unabashed bop that also plucks at your heartstrings, primed for drunken late-night dedications and wistful sobbing in the privacy of your bedroom. – Richard Villegas\n\nANGEL22 - \"Chimbita\"\n\nANGEL22 is out with mid-summer smash “Chimbita,” the next single in the string of tunes released in the past year. As group members Sofia, Laura, Wendii, and Alondra have unique Latin American backgrounds from each other, they embrace different musical styles in total harmony on “Chimbita.” Dancehall, dembow, and reggaeton are just some in the track’s eclectic mix, but it never feels overdone. The quartet recently debuted the new track at Mexico City’s Oye Fusión 2024 music festival, so fans will surely be excited to hear the electrifying studio version. — Chelsea Quezada\n\nLemuell - “Marquesa”\n\nAt just 19-years-old, rapper Lemuell has a whole life ahead of him but is happy to act as if every moment matters like there’s no tomorrow. In his newest single, “Marquesa,” he indulges in the tried and true bedrock of thousands of reggaetón songs: the sexual tension between partners and suitors that gives every glance between them that extra jolt. He celebrates being frisky and flirty, daring each other to make the first move. Back in February he dropped his debut album, F.O.M.O., but didn’t slow down in the least. His youthful exuberance stands out, not just in his work ethic, but in the spirit of his giddy perreos. — Juan J. Arroyo\n\nMariposa - “Myers”\n\nFirst of all: Yes, the “Myers” in the title of this song from Colombian rapper Mariposa refers to the killer in the popular Halloween movie franchise. But make no mistake, this is not horrorcore. Instead, Mariposa uses this film icon as a metaphor for feeling out of place and overcoming negativity surrounding you, like the final girl beating the villain of the movie. For Mariposa, her weapons to achieve this are her sharp lyrical rhymes and her fuel is the shiny digital drill-inspired beat, giving us a fresh hip-hop sound that goes beyond expectations. “Myers” is as much a rave banger as well as a pick-me-up anthem. — Marcos Hassan\n\nDARUMAS - “La Llamada”\n\nLatine trio DARUMAS — formed by Aldana Aguirre, Ceci Leon, and Vedala Vilmon — released their debut self-titled project, which includes their newest single “La Llamada.” The track oozes elements of easy-going pop and funk led by a groovy bass with electronica and synth tinges to tie the song’s production together. Lyrically, the trio delivers an offering about being knowingly head over heels with someone special which is all too easy to relate to. DARUMAS is the band’s first album spanning genres like pop, disco, and funk. – Jeanette Hernandez\n\nSopro - “Luz Azul”\n\nBrazil’s Arthur Nogueira, Leonardo Chaves, and Mateus Estrela debut as a trio under the name Sopro with their single “Luz Azul,” taken from their eponimous EP dropping this month. “Luz Azul” exists right at the intersection of an array of influences, from French house and UK garage to Berlin techno and tropical house, tying the music into the song lyrics about our online selves. They see the internet as a separate reality that shows us in a filtered version, and where we can enjoy dopamine releases from quick interactions. — Cheky\n\nGepe & Monsieur Periné - “21 de ENERo”\n\nChilean folk-pop artist Gepe captures those moments of tenderness that come from emotional growth on “21 DE ENERO,” the latest glimpse from his forthcoming album. Gepe sings with calm clarity as he recounts moving through what he describes as the “chaotic universe of adolescence” in this ode to painful but positive and life-altering transformation. Catalina Garcia of Colombia’s Monsieur Perine joins the singer for spotless harmonies that build up the serenity factor on this bright guitar-driven single. – Nayeli Portillo\n\nDark Chisme - “Fangs”\n\nThe project of DJ and producer Christine Gutierrez and bandmate E, Seattle-based dark wave band Dark Chisme recently shared their debut EP by the same name. Feature track “Fangs” is an instant standout that pays homage to dark wave and post punk influences of the past while interpolating the duo’s cultural knowledge and expansive musical library into the mix. At play is a haunting, techno-laced dark wave single that fuses moody bilingual (and rather timely) lyricism around not being afraid in the face of blood sucking energies and even seamlessly pulls off an electro synth segway into a cumbia bridge breakdown. The single is as invigorating as it is innovative, and marks the band as an exciting one to watch. – Jeanette Diaz\n\nCynthia Fión - “Dónde Duele Más”\n\nWe’ve long told you to keep your eyes and ears on Central America, and this week, Guatemalan singer-songwriter Cynthia Fión unveiled “Dónde Duele Más,” a slice of dark, melancholy trip-hop and yet another fantastic 2024 release out of the region. Produced by Chapin scene mastermind Bumont, the song’s moody electronics cushion Fión’s R&B-inflected vocals as she mourns the demise of an all-consuming affair. “Un solo corte y dónde duele más,” she coos sorrowfully, underscoring the heart’s fragility and the sting of loving with all your might; a risk always worth taking. – Richard Villegas\n\nEbony - “24hrs”\n\nRising pop-rap superstar Ebony’s newest single “24hrs” from her upcoming mixtape has some real bite to it. In collaboration once again with fellow Brazilian songwriter and producer biggie diehl, the two artists have produced a zesty instrumental and authoritative energy. Ebony’s vocal never wavers from her self-assured cadence as she raps in Portuguese about a woman focusing on her career with no time for a man. At just over two minutes, “24hrs” is the solution for those looking for a new summer hype song. — Chelsea Quezada\n\nFABIOLA - “SUMMER LOVE”\n\nAfter a whirlwind handful of weeks doing promos across TV and radio, budding star FABIOLA finally dropped her debut EP last week. The six-track project, BLUE DREAMING, offers a grab bag of songs where she highlights her range: from the sweaty perreo of “NOCHES DE SAOCO” to the rap-sonnet hybrid of its title track. Her new single, “SUMMER LOVE,” is another standout. In it, she glides through an afrobeats-tinged soundscape as she sings about a past summer fling — one that she’d love to come across and repeat every season. Blue dreams might signal melancholy, but a few hot dates over summer evenings are the perfect antidote. — Juan J. Arroyo\n\nMagdalena Bay - “Tunnel Vision”\n\nFuture pop duo Magdelana Bay has not been shy about stretching the limits of the pop song mold, but “Tunnel Vision” is perhaps their most daring track the band has attempted so far. Going for pure maximalism, the tune sees them embrace both live and programmed drums, sugary melodies and dissonance, and loud/soft dynamics. The beating heart of the song lies in the ‘90s R&B-inspired hooks while their experimental side gets a thorough work out during the outro, which sounds like a futuristic iteration of psych rock. Magdalena Bay remains a vanguardist act that is several years ahead of the curb. — Marcos Hassan\n\nLos Sufridos - “Lleno Contigo (feat. Anthony Santos)”\n\nDominican group Los Sufridos teamed up with bachata artist Anthony Santos for their newest collaboration, “Lleno Contigo.” With a distinctive guitar, percussion, and strong bass, the new joint track highlights traditional elements that bachata is known for, all while making it their own. Together, the artists solidified a captivating track about heartbreak, utilizing Santos’ passionate croons to complement Los Sufirdos’ emotional soundscape. – Jeanette Hernandez\n\nPhran - “Recipe (feat. Marta Szewczyk, Club Nuclear)\"\n\nBarcelona-based producer Francisco Mejía, aka Phran, takes a break from his usual techno-laden output on his forthcoming Laguna EP, which finds him in a more ambient, personal space. “Recipe” serves as a first preview of this exploration, where crackly textures clash with dubby stylings and downtempo-referencing beats to create a contemplative space enhanced by Marta Szewczyk’s stern spoken words and moody woodwind atmospheres created by fellow Venezuelan musician Club Nuclear. — Cheky"
