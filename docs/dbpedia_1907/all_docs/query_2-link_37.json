        "meta_description": "NYH320 Sangre De Lobo - Sangre Cumbia by New York Haunted, released 02 March 2023\n\n1. NYH320 01 Sangre De Lobo - El Lobo Esta Esperando\n2. NYH320 02 Sangre De Lobo - Sangre Cumbia\n3. NYH320 03 Sangre De Lobo - La Muerta Cumbia\n4. NYH320 04 Sangre De Lobo - Sangre De Mi Corazon\n\nAt a certain point in time, about 13 years ago, I got obsessed with the sound of Cumbia, the dragging, slow, narcotic sound of South America. I almost never get send demos in this style, because most people in SA still consider this to be &#39;peasant music&#39; or just something out of their past they don&#39;t want to deal with. It&#39;s actually a hybrid that incorporates a large cultural African diaspora, blended with traditional SA music and culture. Nowadays, producers blend it with electronics and pop. \r\n\r\nI was super happy to get these tracks sent over by Sangre De Lobo, which translates to &#39;Blood of the Wolf&#39; from Argentina. Imagine my surprise when it also turned out to contain a sample by my favorite metal band. This is the real deal, hazy, doomy, slow and experimental in the style of Vampiros Deejay and Sonido Martinez. An unusual sound for NYH, sure, but I feel it&#39;s closer to what we do that most mainstream techno. Check it out and get seduced to tapping your feet and shaking your hips, now stand up and let the riddim lead you! Arriba Las Manos!",
