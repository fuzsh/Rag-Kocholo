        "text": "I will take the term “urban popular music” in Latin America to refer to a music that is a massmediated, a mass-culture phenomenon, and an agent of modernization. It is massmediated in the sense that the music industry and technology structure the relationships between musicians and publics, as well as those between music and musicians, who receive their art primarily by listening to recordings. It is mass-circulated because it reaches millions of people simultaneously, globalizing local sensibilities and creating trans-social and transnational alliances. It is modern because of its symbiotic relation with to the culture industry, technology, and communication, from which it develops its capacity to express the present, a fundamental historical moment for the young audience that sustains it.\n\nThis article discusses the way that young people in Lima establish themselves as heirs to Arguedas, specifically through the analysis of music by contemporary fusion bands Crónica de Mendigos and Tayta Bird. I argue that they use Arguedas as a signifier in their music to show their cultural capital, legitimize their musical projects, search for belonging as young limeños with roots in other places in Peru, and celebrate cultural diversity. These two bands—in contrast to those founded in the 1990s that have been studied in relation to Arguedas—actually include excerpts of Arguedas’ texts or sound clips of him singing in their songs. Unlike academics, however, these musicians are not trying to establish whether or not Arguedas was ‘right’, and more often dialogue with ideas about Arguedas—his notion of mestizaje as celebratory multiculturalism, his idea of an inclusive nation as one of todas las sangres, his own search for belonging as a mestizo—rather than with the texts themselves. Through establishing themselves as heirs to Arguedas and creating music which mixes autochthonous and global genres, these musicians establish themselves as cosmopolitans who ‘belong’ both in the Andes and in Lima or any other global city.\n\nThe relationship that Spain has with its ancient colonies in Latin America is a complex one. Unlike the relationship that the United States has with Australia and United Kingdom, for instance, Spain is not a military ally of any of the big Latin American countries. Commercial exchanges are perceived by the common citizen as an affair of the economical elites and the presence of Spanish banks and corporations are seen suspiciously as a neocolonial activity. Asymmetrical economic relations make that immigrants from Latin American countries to are mostly unqualified workers while Spaniards travelling to the Americas do so in search of exoticism or commercial advantages […] Independently of the above considerations, the fact of sharing a common language has facilitated the consumption of cultural products such as literature, music, cinema and television series on both sides without regard to their provenance. Only the characteristics of the product and the entertainment or satisfaction value they offer counts. We have a situation where a web of complex and paradoxical relationships oscillates between the recognition of a common culture and the need of asserting historical differences. It is in this unstable scenario that the diffusion, reception and consumption of Spanish urban popular music takes place. Perhaps for this reason many songs produced in Spain have not been really understood in Ibero-America. Nevertheless some of them have been cultural and vital landmarks for thousands of individuals. They have been a defining element in the mechanisms of construction of the identity and the subjectivity of successive generations in sundry social groups. They are an integral part of the private life of many individuals and of the history of Latin American music. In this article I shall examine some facets of this complex relationship. I will emphasize above all, the processes and types of transnationalism of Spanish music in Latin America in cases that go from the reproduction of stereotypes of Spanish culture to the constitution of real transnational musical scenes lacking any marks of national culture and sharing a mental imagery and worlds of signification.\n\nIn this study, I undertake a comparative analysis of New York, Puerto Rico and Cuba’s Latin music scenes, both prior to as well as after the Cuban Revolution. Three questions are addressed in particular: How did the musical relations between New York and Puerto Rico’s Latin music scenes develop? How did these two music scenes relate to Cuba’s music scene? What is the significance of the New-York-Puerto-Rico connection in the emergence and early development of salsa music? My thesis is that out of the fusion of New York and Puerto Rico’s social music aesthetics and performance practices the main stylistic characteristics that eventually came to define salsa music came about. The study, thus, strives to illustrate the significance of the location in the production of popular music, while proposing concomitantly a new theoretical framework for such an analysis."
