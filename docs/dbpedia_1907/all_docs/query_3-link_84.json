        "text": "Selena is the queen of Tejano. The king, even. There’s no disputing that.\n\nBut her music goes far beyond regional appeal. It’s vast and varied, combining traditional elements with pop, R&B and dance music. It’s apparent on her last albums, “Amor Prohibido” and “Entre a Mi Mundo.” Even in their earliest days, Selena & Los Dinos mined a sound that no other Tejano act was exploring.\n\nBEYOND THE HITS: These 24 Selena songs don’t get played enough\n\nEvery album has its reward, but here’s a (subjective) ranking of Selena’s albums. To avoid repetition, I’ve left out most repackagings and compilations of hits.\n\n1. “Amor Prohibido” (1994): Selena’s final album before her death solidified her status as the genre’s biggest star. It spawned seven hits, including bouncy pop tune “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom,” the reggaeton-flavored “Techno Cumbia” and standout ballad “No Me Queda Mas.”\n\n2. “Entre a Mi Mundo” (1992): This album include signature hit “Como la Flor,” which introduced Selena to an international audience. It was clearly a product of the pop influences she and brother AB Quintanilla listened to growing up.\n\n3. “Live — The Last Concert” (2001): Selena’s Feb. 26, 1995 RodeoHouston show at the Astrodome is immortalized on this album, a stunning showcase for her talent, charisma and confidence. Every song, from the “Disco Medley” to an epic take on “La Carcacha,” is a standout.\n\n4. “Ven Conmigo” (1990): Selena established herself as a singer with appeal beyond Texas on this album, which features future favorite “Baila Esta Cumbia” and dancefloor favorites “Ya Ves” and “Ven Conmigo.” It’s also the first appearance of pop songs “Enamorada de Ti” and “No Quiero Saber.”\n\n5. “Dreaming of You” (1995): Selena was recording her English-language crossover album at the time of her death. The four completed songs — “I Could Fall in Love,” “Captive Heart,” “I’m Getting Used to You” and the title track — showcase some of her best vocals yet and are a bittersweet reminder of her potential.\n\n6. “Selena” (1989): Selena is coming into her own on her EMI Latin debut, which includes the adventurous “Sukiyaki” and “Besitos,” one of her best early cumbias.\n\n7. “Live” (1993): Selena won a Grammy for this live album, recorded in Corpus Christi. It’s also notable for a trio of new studio tracks: “No Debes Jugar,” “La Llamada” and “Tu Robaste Mi Corazon,” a duet with the late Emilio Navaira.\n\n8. “Ones” (2002): If you get just one hits collection, this is the one to get. Aside from the beautiful packaging, it includes “Con Tanto Amor,” a three-song medley of “Amor Prohibido,” “Si Una Vez” and “Como la Flor” recast as ballads. It gives each song added poignancy.\n\n9. “Dulce Amor” (1988): This was one of Selena’s best early releases. Among the highlights is a ranchera version of Juan Gabriel’s classic “Costumbres.”\n\n25 YEARS LATER: Selena is with me every day, literally\n\n10. “Preciosa” (1988): Songwriter Ricky Vela contributed the standout ballads “Como Te Quiero” and “Sabes” — precursors to “No Me Queda Mas,” one of the biggest hits he wrote for Selena.\n\n11. “Mis Primeras Grabaciones” (1984): Selena wasn’t even a teenager when Selena & Los Dinos’ debut album was released. But her voice hints at the greatness to come. Even here, they had an eye toward crossover success and included a pair of English-language songs.\n\n12. “Selena — The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack” (1997): Jennifer Lopez lip synced to a series of Selena songs in the 1997 film, all of which are included here. Amon the gems are an epic “Cumbia Medley,” the pulsing club track “Is It the Beat?” and the soaring ballad “Where Did the Feeling Go?”\n\n13. “Female Vocalist of the Year/And the Winner Is” (1987): The album’s title references Selena’s wins at the Tejano Music Awards, which would continue for several years. It includes a pop version of “La Bamba,” Jose Alfredo Jimenez ballad “Cuando Nadie te Quiera” and the cumbia “Salta la Ranita.”\n\n14. “Muñequito de Trapo” (1986): Among the more standard fare are standouts, including wistful ballad “Muñequito de Trapo” and doo-wop ditty “A Million to One,” which would later surface in a remixed version on a pothumous collection.\n\n15. “Alpha” (1986): This hard-to-find album includes “Dame un Beso,” one of Selena's first minor hits, and “Pa Que Me Sirvela Vida,” a torchy ballad that makes good use of her maturing voice.\n\nEven more Selena music\n\n“16 Super Exitos Originales” (1990): An overview of Selena's early career.\n\n“Siempre Selena” (1996): “Siempre Hace Frio,” one of Selena's best, is the keepsake.\n\n“Anthology — A 30 Song Retrospective” (1998): Three discs — pop/English, mariachi and cumbia — that span 1985-1995.\n\n“All My Hits/Todos Mis Exitos Vol. 1” (1999): The first collection of Selena’s signaature hits.\n\n“All My Hits/Todos Mis Exitos Vol. 2” (2000): Early pop ballads and live recordings of “No Me Queda Mas” and “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.”\n\n“Greatest Hits” (2003): Selena’s English-language recordings.\n\n“Momentos Intimos” (2004): This compilation includes two reorchestrated tracks and an unreleased demo.\n\n“Unforgettable” (2005): Live recordings, hits, videos and the “Selena Remembered” documentary.\n\n“Through the Years/A Traves de los Años” (2007): Includes a recording of a seven-year-old Selena singing “Feelings” and a DVD of live TV performances.\n\n“La Leyenda” (2010): Another box set, notable for the lush, purple packaging and booklets.\n\n“Enamorada de Ti” (2012): Selena’s hits remixed and recast as duets with Selena Gomez, Don Omar, Santana and others."
