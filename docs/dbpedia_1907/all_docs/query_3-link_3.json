        "text": "Musical rhythms and folk dance traditions of Latin America\n\nCumbia refers to a number of musical rhythms and folk dance traditions of Latin America, generally involving musical and cultural elements from American Indigenous peoples, Europeans and enslaved Africans during colonial times.[1] Cumbia is said to have come from funeral traditions in the Afro-Colombian community.\n\nCumbia traditionally uses three drums (tambora, tambor alegre [es] and llamador), three flutes (gaita hembra and gaito macho, both forms of Colombian flute [es], and flauta de millo) and has a 2\n\n2 or 2\n\n4 meter.[2] The sound of cumbia can be characterized as having a simple \"chu-chucu-chu\" rhythm created by the guacharaca.[3] The genre frequently incorporates brass instruments and piano. In order to properly understand the interlocking relationship between cumbia's roots, its Pan-American (and then global) routes, and its subgenres, Colombia's geocultural complexities must be taken into account.\n\nMost Hispanic American countries have made their own regional version of Cumbia, some of them with their own particularity.\n\nExamples of cumbia include:\n\nColombian cumbia, is a musical rhythm and traditional folk dance from Colombia.[4] It has elements of three different cultures, American Indigenous, African, and Spanish, being the result of the long and intense meeting of these cultures during the Conquest and the Colony.[5] The Colombian cumbia is the origin of all the other variations,[6] including the tradition of dancing it with candles in the dancers' hands.\n\nPanamanian cumbia, Panamanian folk dance and musical genre, developed by enslaved people of African descent during colonial times and later syncretized with American Indigenous and European cultural elements.\n\nHistory of Colombian cumbia\n\n[edit]\n\nCumbia's background came from the coastal region of Colombia.[7] To be more specific, its dance came from a coastal traditional culture, as cumbia had multiple ethnic influences that originated from this region. One of the biggest factors of its heritage is the African influences that was brought over by the African slaves imported from the colonization of the Spaniards. The influence came from the costeño[8] dance. Another influence was the integration of Spanish people. The Spanish folksongs with influences from the indigenous caused the fusion of races and the elements of their cultures were likewise fused.[9]\n\nThe history of cumbia has evolved throughout the years, known as a street dance but had a period of transiting into a ballroom dance.[10] Cumbia is commonly known for having many subgenres from different countries which contributes to the different dance styles known. Cumbia can be referred to as a folk dance while also being known globally as a street dance. To better understand what the dances of cumbia resemble it's better to know the basics of the dance. Cumbia is danced in pairs, consisting the amorous conquest of a woman by a man. This is crucial since the dance from the Atlantic coast[11] has the woman holding a candle in her right hand. This serves as two narrative functions; one to light the way for the dancing woman and the latter for a more serious motif. The latter can be portrayed in an imaginative sentence as a weapon by which the woman defends herself against the advances of her partner.[11]\n\nSince the 1950s, cumbia has been an art form that is stylized, orchestrated and lyricized, contrary to the traditional form. This has diverged through the years and the world-known genre even had a brief period in the 1970s where it lost its popularity.\n\nExpansion into Latin America\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the genre evolved, it expanded throughout Latin America. The expansion has led to the creation of new variations on the form, and international recognition of the genre changed public perceptions. Cumbia almost disappeared in Colombia in the 1970s after the introduction of salsa. Although that was detrimental it could be argued that cumbia found stability in Central America, Mexico, and Peru.[12] The transformation of cumbia in other countries to better align with the taste of populations with very different aesthetic traditions from the strongly African-derived coastal culture[13] from which it originally emerged.\n\nRepresenting cumbia being perceived as expressing the harmonious outcome of racial and cultural blending, this socially affected the public views on the region's highly discriminated mestizo working class. Socially and economically some changed their views on mestizos due to cumbia being a large factor in shaping their perspective - except in Argentina, where it's still largely seen as vulgar and offensive by much of the middle class and has thus mostly helped reinforce lower class stereotypes.[14]\n\nRegional adaptations of Colombian cumbia\n\n[edit]\n\nArgentina\n\n[edit]\n\nArgentine cumbia\n\nCumbia villera, a subgenre of Argentine cumbia born in the slums\n\nCumbia santafesina, a musical genre that emerged in Santa Fe, Argentina\n\nBolivia\n\n[edit]\n\nBolivian cumbia\n\nChile\n\n[edit]\n\nChilean cumbia\n\nNew Chilean cumbia\n\nColombia\n\n[edit]\n\nCumbia (Colombia)\n\nCosta Rica\n\n[edit]\n\nCosta Rican cumbia\n\nEcuador\n\n[edit]\n\nEcuadorian cumbia\n\nTurbocumbia\n\nEl Salvador\n\n[edit]\n\nSalvadoran cumbia\n\nCumbia marimbera, a subgenre of Cumbia that is widely popular in Southern Mexico and Central America\n\nGuatemala\n\n[edit]\n\nGuatemalan cumbia\n\nCumbia marimbera, a subgenre of Cumbia that is widely popular in Southern Mexico and Central America\n\nHonduras\n\n[edit]\n\nHonduran cumbia\n\nCumbia marimbera, a subgenre of Cumbia that is widely popular in Southern Mexico and Central America\n\nMexico\n\n[edit]\n\nMexican cumbia\n\nSoutheast cumbia or chunchaca, a variant of Mexican cumbia\n\nNorthern Mexican cumbia, a variant of Mexican cumbia, developed in northeastern Mexico and part of Texas (former Mexican territory)\n\nCumbia sonidera, a variant of Mexican cumbia\n\nCumbia marimbera, a subgenre of Cumbia that is widely popular in Southern Mexico and Central America\n\nNicaragua\n\n[edit]\n\nNicaraguan cumbia\n\nCumbia chinandegana\n\nCumbia marimbera, a subgenre of Cumbia that is widely popular in Southern Mexico and Central America\n\nPanama\n\n[edit]\n\nPanamanian cumbia; A subgenre that involves Panamanian folk dance and the cumbia musical genre, developed by enslaved people of African descent during the expansion of Spanish rule in Panama and later syncretized with American Indigenous and European cultural elements.\n\nParaguay\n\n[edit]\n\nCachaca, a fusion of cumbia sonidera, norteña, vallenato and cumbia villera\n\nPeru\n\n[edit]\n\nPeruvian cumbia also known as chicha or psychedelic cumbia[15]\n\nChicha [es] or Andean tropical music\n\nAmazonian cumbia or jungle cumbia, a popular subgenre of Peruvian cumbia, created in the Peruvian Amazon\n\nCumbia piurana, a set of styles and sub-genres linked to cumbia that have been produced in Piura, a region on the north Peruvian coast, since the mid-1960s\n\nCumbia sanjuanera, a subgenre of cumbia piurana\n\nCumbia sureña, a subgenre of Peruvian cumbia, a fusion of Andean cumbia and techno\n\nUruguay\n\n[edit]\n\nUruguayan cumbia\n\nVenezuela\n\n[edit]\n\nVenezuelan cumbia"
