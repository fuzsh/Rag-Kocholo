        "text": "(music: Los Mirlos â âLa Danza del Petroleroâ)\n\nFelipe\n\nSo there, heâs just saying, âThis is the dance of the petrol man, the king of the black gold.â\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nRight, right, right. That was, there was all of a sudden a massive influx of Americans and foreigners trying to get a piece of Peruâs natural resources.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nItâs interesting you said that. With those guys, American and British rock music came in as an influence. Guitars arrived, and it was being mixed up with Cumbias to make what became known as Chicha. At the same time, were locals listening to a lot of British and American music? Or just appropriating the instruments into Cumbia?\n\nFelipe\n\nProbably, yes. Mostly in Lima, I think. And the Chicha became a rhythm because there was this kind of Cumbia from the Amazon, and it was mixed with rock, and some of the Andean influence that was â all the people from the Andes were coming to Lima at that time because there was more money there. It became a really centralized country from there on.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo Chicha, Chicha essentially was one ofâ¦ It was this moment in time where a music genre that was very much Peruâs, right? It was very much Peruâs own style of music. Itâs named after a drink, the Chicha drink. Tell us a little bit about Chicha, and historically, what was Chicha the drink, and what did Chicha music mean to Peruvians at the time?\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, Chicha comes from chicha de jora, which is a drink made ofâ¦\n\nFelipe\n\nYou have corn brewed, and you keep it, I think, one week until it ferments, and you have the alcohol.\n\nRafael\n\nItâs really hardcore.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhat would happen to me if I drunk a couple of bottles of Chicha?\n\nFelipe\n\nBottles?\n\nRafael\n\nBottles, woah.\n\nFelipe\n\nUsually, itâs served in a big glass like this with ice on top, and it seems like dirty water. Itâs brownish.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nIt translates to fire water, right? Is that the literal translation of Chicha?\n\nFelipe\n\nI think the Chicha was the pot they used for theâ¦\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nHow bad is my hangover going to be if I haveâ¦?\n\nFelipe\n\nThatâs terrible.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nRight.\n\nFelipe\n\nBut itâs really good. It looks a little bit weird, but the taste is nice.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nOkay, so another thing that you mentioned before is with the Amazon and the psychedelic influence. Of course, everyone knows someone whoâs at some kind of house party somewhere who plans to go to the Amazon to do an Ayahuasca ceremony, or maybe in some cases knows someone who has actually done it. Ayahuasca, it must be noted, that the ceremony comes from Peru, right? What kind of role does it play? How is Ayahuasca and shamanism and this side of things, how is it regarded in Peruvian society?\n\nRafael\n\nFor a long time, it was taken like somethingâ¦\n\nFelipe\n\nTaboo.\n\nRafael\n\nLike a taboo, mm-hmm [affirmative]. Lately, I think people are starting to rescue those ways of life, and I think now itâs very much accepted.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nMaybe, again, Iâm sure a lot of people in this audience know what Ayahuasca is, but there might be some that donât. Talk us through Ayahuasca, the ceremony. What region in Peru does it originate from, and how is it regarded in popular culture?\n\nRafael\n\nWell, itâs a root. Itâs a mixture of roots from the jungle of Peru and Brazil.\n\nFelipe\n\nLeaves as well, like Chacaruna and Ayahuasca. Ayahuasca is the root, and Chacaruna is the leaf from another plant that makes the psychoactive... Like, hits you.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nPeople will go into the ceremony, and in three days theyâll have a very spiritual and crazy experience?\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, actually it depends a lot in which part of the jungle you are. For example, in Brazil, they take it really mild, and they drink it all the time. They donât stop drinking it, but just in a really mild mixture. They dance in groups, and itâs about doing it in a whole community thing. In Peru, itâs more like you take just a little small glass but really strong, and you have a shaman, which will just help you guide your trip. Heâs not telling you what to do or how to experience it. He will just take care of you, and if he feels like youâre not having a good time, he will just sing to you. He will just, I donât know, carry the thing with music, which is awesome.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nHow did this part of culture have an impact on the music at the time? Were a lot of these artists, theses Chicha artists going and seeing a shaman, going through this experience?\n\nFelipe\n\nItâs different because in the Andes, that I think is more the influence of the Chicha, they do different stuff. Itâs another culture. They use shamans as well, but they donât take psychoactives that much. Itâs more about spirituality and respect for the earthly gods. But for the people of the jungle and the psychedelic Cumbia, I think it was very important.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nEspecially around this time in the â60s, but then moving forward in the â70s and especially the â80s, Lima became really overpopulated. I think it almost doubled in population from three million to about six million because all of a sudden, a lot of people coming from the jungle, a lot of people coming from the Andean side of Peru. How were these different cultures respected in Lima? Theyâd come to the big cityâ¦\n\nRafael\n\nActually, when this thing changes from the â70s to the â80s and Chicha was born, the word Chicha was actually a really bad word.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nLike a derogatory expression?\n\nRafael\n\nExactly. You could use it as just something like, âOh, this is Chicha.â Like something really kitsch and bad. And those people were not really well-taken in Lima. They were all there, but people would just say, âOh no, this is Chicha people. We donât like them.â I think now that is changing a lot.\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, itâs a lot of classism and racism everywhere in the world, and itâs because of this centralism that the city has. Lima now is very big, but itâs the same way as before, and itâs growing and growing every time. We have like maybe 40 million people now, and itâs more than half of the country, entirely in the capital.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nFor you guys, you mentioned before, you grew up with Cumbias and all this and almost in a way rejected it. You had a moment at a party in Buenos Aires where you started hearing what other people were doing with Cumbias, and then you started digging deep, and youâve been digging deep back into the music of Peru. For you guys, now that youâve been researching, finding all this music, what do you love about both cultures, the Amazonian side of Peruvian jungle that youâve discovered yourself, and the Andean side? What do you love about that and what it brings to the culture of Peru on a whole?\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, I love mostly, if you go to the jungle, the people is very happy and joyful, and they like to party a lot. In the Andean side, itâs very quiet and respectful. So I think I like a little bit of everything. The people on the coast is more relaxed and chilled out.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nDo you guys travel there regularly, to both regions?\n\nFelipe\n\nI used to travel a lot when I was a bit younger. I had a lot of time. But now itâs a little bit hard. Sometimes, we play abroad from Lima.\n\nRafael\n\nBut not very much actually. Peru is very centralized in Lima, so these not really a place to have gigs around in other cities. Thatâs really difficult, and thatâs something we really want to change. Him and some other friends were trying to make some festivals outside Lima to help that change.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nThe track that you played before, the âPetrol Man,â would you say thatâs a good example of the Andean influence, or is that more...?\n\nFelipe\n\nThat was more about the Amazonian.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nOkay, have we got something with more of an Andean influence?\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, we want to play Los Shapis. That is kind of the creators of Chicha.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nHeâs quite a charismatic, small man.\n\nRafael\n\nChapulin.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nYeah.\n\nFelipe\n\nA very special guy.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nA tiny guy with the biggest personality in Peru.\n\n(music: Los Shapis â unknown)\n\nSo one more time, that was a track byâ¦\n\nFelipe\n\nLos Shapis.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAnd theyâre still performing today?\n\nRafael\n\nYeah.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, they are performing a lot, actually, and they play all over the country.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo, weâve kind of like come from the â60s and through the â70s and the rise of Chicha.\n\nFelipe\n\nThis is more like for late â70s or â80s, I think.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhich is kind of a pretty interesting time for Peru. Globally, Peru was getting headlines for all the wrong reasons. There was a lot of terrorism. There was like an internal conflict. There was a group called the Shining Path. Without getting too political, can you just give us an idea of the landscape of Peru throughout the â80s and the impact that that had on music?\n\nFelipe\n\nI think it was like a class war between the worker class and the upper class, but they had that wrong actually, because they were bombing everyone. I also got my house bombed. And... Nobody died, but it was terrible for us, a big loss.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nThis is a pretty everyday reality for people. You go out shopping, just random houses. It wasnât like they were that organized.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, they were saying, âOK, this is high-class people, letâs bomb them.â\n\nRafael\n\nWe had blackouts almost every day, and almost all of the people that came to Lima, they came to Lima because of that. It was really difficult for them to be in the Andes, mainly with all the terrorism that was going on there.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nThey were recruiting people from every town.\n\nRafael\n\nThey would go from town to town to recruit people, so either youâre with them or you die.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, and, well, the army was the same. It was very hardcore because they were thinking that everyone was a terrorist, so they were killing people for nothing. It was like a civil war.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhat kind of impact did that have on music? What happened to Peruvian music during this time?\n\nRafael\n\nI think thatâs how maybe Chicha was created, because before, when the Cumbia Masonica was the thing, it was mainly instrumental. And then when Chicha came, the lyrics started coming, and they were mostly about suffering and very melancholic. Because there was so much trouble around the country that they needed to express that in some way. So I think Chicha was really important for that.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nHave you got an example of another track to play that kind of marks this period?\n\nFelipe\n\nThis is Grupo Celeste. It was the first band of Chacalon that is like one of the biggest names in Chicha.\n\n(music: Grupo Celeste â âComo un Aveâ)\n\nRafael\n\nI think this song is definitely talking about love, but it also relates, of what we were just talking, that itâs saying, âI am like a bird, I am looking for a nest.â\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, and heâs lost in the way.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nDuring this whole time, this kind of incredibly tumultuous social times, you were both really young. When did things start to get easier in Lima? And I guess my next question is when you guys finally got to the age where you were going out and experiencing the city, and experiencing music. When did this happen?\n\nFelipe\n\nI think this was maybe during â96, or â97, you know? Because before it wasâ¦\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWeâre talking 16 years of intense civil unrest.\n\nFelipe\n\nYes. But itâs actually still a bit dangerous, and itâs like you canât take your equipment out with a backpack because youâre probably going to get robbed. So you have to take care of that. Now, with tourism and everything, itâs coming a bit better.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nFor you guys, as you know, youâre 16, youâre 17 years old. I donât know if youâre using fake IDs to get into clubs or whatever back then, if you needed to or not, but paint us a picture of the Lima that you guys found as you were just starting to really get into music.\n\nRafael\n\nWell, Limaâs always been, I think, behind the whole music thing. When we were around 17 or 18, it was maybe the â90s, no?\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah.\n\nFelipe\n\nAnd people were listening to music from the â70s.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, and then, when during that, all the music from the â90s was heard in the 2000s, and youâre like ten years of gap.\n\nRafael\n\nBut that gap is closing, you know.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nOkay, so youâre 16, 17 years old, and youâre on a dancefloor, dancing to music. When you were that age, what were the big tracks?\n\nFelipe\n\nMostly â80s music, I think. It was â80s music playing all over the radio until now. Music from the â80s. Youâd have like only radios from music from the â80s and thatâs it, stuff like that. I used to listen to a lot of punk rock music, like Bad Religion and groups from the States.\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, mainly, the biggest influence in Peruvian music from outside, it comes from the US, I think. And also, well, Latin pop, now.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhat was the moment, you think, for Lima where the first foundations of an underground electronic music thing started to happen? Was there a pivotal club night? Was there a radio show? When would you say the first seeds were planted in Lima?\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, the first time I went to an electronic party was â96, I think, and there were maybe 100 people, and there was a club called Loboda. They used to play lots of really tribal house and stuff like that. It went on, and now they have a really strong electronic scene, mostly deep house and like that kind of stuff. Four on the floor, you know? But there wasnât really an underground experimental scene, it was little, just a few people making music.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nBy this stage, youâre 16, 17. You are listening to punk rock. Are you hating Cumbia at this stage? Is it still in that hate phase of the relationship?\n\nFelipe\n\nNot hating it, because I used to like Los Shapis, but my mom was telling me, âIf you donât hear the music, thatâs bad.â I was like, âBut why?â Then, when I was into punk rock, I was away from that.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhat was the moment for you both individually? First of all, how long have you two guys known each other for?\n\nRafael\n\nMaybe eight, nine years?\n\nFelipe\n\nEight to ten years.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nRight, right, right. So individually, before you guys actually met each other, what was that moment where for you where, as young dudes growing up in Lima, youâre like, âI want to contribute to music. I want to start making music. I want to start DJing?â When did these sorts of things start to happen?\n\nFelipe\n\nFor me, since I was maybe 12 I started playing guitar and drums, so I had two or three ones at the same time with some friends. We all knew each other. We were making bands. But when I was like 16, I discovered, I bought a computer, and I discovered Fruity Loops. So I started from there, from â98 until now, making electronic music.\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, and for me, I always wanted to make music and contribute, but I never really learned how to play an instrument. So when I discovered a computer around 2000, it really changed my life to be able to make music with the computer. Maybe I didnât have the ability to compose, but I could just find the beats, and it was really like a changed game for me.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nFor the both of you, were you very much, at that point, did you feel connected to a scene? Was there a scene in Lima that you thought you were kind of contributing to, or were you very much on your own behind your computer just making music?\n\nFelipe\n\nIt was a bit hard. I didnât think I was going to become a DJ or anything, but it just came along. I started DJing some tracks that I used to play, I used to make. Then, I become a DJ, and Iâm a part of an electronic scene. But I didnât think... To be like that.\n\nRafael\n\nI felt actually a bit disconnected. It was like a big-room house thing going on, so I just didnât feel it.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nYou said eight or nine years ago, you guys met for the first time. It must be noted at this point that Dengue Dengue Dengue! only started, what, four years ago?\n\nFelipe\n\n[nods] Four years.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo I guess, how did you guys meet? First impressions of each other?\n\nRafael\n\nBecause of this, we didnât feel connected to the scene that was going on, we gathered together with him and other friends and created a collective so we can start doing parties and trying to do our own thing. Thatâs how we met. We met through another friend, which is a producer, and we became friends.\n\nFelipe\n\nHe was making parties in this really underground space. And we met there and started making some like, techno parties. And he was doing more like drum & bass parties, and then we got together and made that collective.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhat was the name of the collective? And I guess, in the early stages, once you... âCause it wasnât just you two, there were a whole lot of other like-minded individuals... What was it that you guys were trying to do? What were you trying to create in Lima that didnât exist already?\n\nRafael\n\nWell, the collective is called Auxiliar. We only had, as I said, like big-room house parties, so we wanted to bring other kind of beats to the city. And it was kind of difficult. In the party that we met, we would maybe run the party for two years, and we had 20, 30 people showing up. So it was really easy to meet everyone there.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nI guess during this time, obviously, the Internet is an established thing by this stage. But, in a city like Lima... For all of us we take it so much for granted when we live in a New York or a London or any European city where you can see some of your favorite artists all the time. I mean, Iâm from a city called Auckland in New Zealand, so it was much less frequently that youâd get big artists touring through. But in a city like Lima, is it difficult to create and maintain a scene and get people to come to your city to perform?\n\nRafael\n\nWell, yeah, itâs super difficult. Weâve been doing it for like eight years, and we still struggle a lot with getting people to show up to a party unless itâs some really huge name. But when we started to do this tropical thing, you know, it relates a lot to the people there, so that changed a lot. That was really changed a lot. We have parties now with 1000, 1500 people showing. But we still do the other parties. We still do the drum & bass thing or the bass, no? Well, itâs evolving, not really drum & bass now, but itâs evolving. But we still do that. We do the tropical thing. We get the money from there, and thatâs the way we do the other thing because we need to push the scene.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAnd pre-Dengue Dengue Dengue!, you both produced music, under your own artist names. Zolcan Breaker?\n\nFelipe\n\nYes, Zolcan Breaker.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAnd MacUmba?\n\nRafael\n\nYes.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nOkay, tell us about the individuals. Who was Zolcan Breaker? What kind of thing did he do? Who was MacUmba?\n\nFelipe\n\nZolcan was more like kind of experimental drum & bass, but very melodic. I was very influenced at that time by maybe Aphex Twin or Âµ-Ziq, kind of. It was very mellow and sentimental, so itâs very different from now, you know?\n\nRafael\n\nAnd for me, around 2000, I moved to London, so I was really into the whole drum & bass, and bass stuff, so I was kind of doing that with MacUmba. And I also like a lot the IDM thing, like Aphex Twin. So we really tried to do tracks like that.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nI guess, you know, youâve known each other already at this point for about four years, and all of a sudden, youâre like, âWell, why donât we just do it together?â And Dengue Dengue Dengue! is born. Letâs listen to a track right now. Maybe something off the album, or an earlier Dengue track.\n\nRafael\n\nOkay. This is âDumbia Murdahsâ from the La Alianza Profana album.\n\n(video: Dengue Dengue Dengue! â âSimioloâ)\n\n[applause]\n\nDid the shaman have to sing to you during the trip? Or did it end out alright?\n\nFelipe\n\nItâs kind of a trippy environment.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nOne of those things, I remember when I saw that video for the first time. I always feel really bad saying this thing, because you feel like youâre being so ridiculously patronizing when you say it, but seeing that video for the first time, it made you go, âOh my god, wow! This is what Peruvian artists are doing.â It was just like the music was incredible, but the video really incredible, great idea, really well executed, and it makes you go, âOh wow, thereâs a scene. Thereâs thing happening.â Which is a bad, stupid way to think, but you know what I mean. It was really impressive. And I guess for you guys, how important was it from the get-go that the way you, the video side of things, the way that you market yourselves through that, how important was it to make it sure it was of a certain quality?\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, for us it was the most important thing to have a video and to have something to give away to people for knowing you, and to have the idea of the visual aspect of the project. I think without the video, we could not make what we have achieved now.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nHow important was that video for you as a business card?\n\nRafael\n\nIt was definitely, maybe the most important thing weâve ever done.\n\nFelipe\n\nThe most expensive thing. It wasnât that expensive, but for us, it was very expensive.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAt the same time, when you think about everything thatâs happened over the last year, well, two years since that video has come out, and when you think about festival fees and tour fees, would you say that investing in a video like that has been worth it for you?\n\nRafael\n\nOh, totally worth it.\n\nFelipe\n\nTotally worth it, man.\n\nRafael\n\nWe did it because of that, we were thinking that we needed toâ¦ Itâs our business card.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAm I allowed to ask what kind of budget you make a music video like that with?\n\nRafael\n\nI think that video was around $7000.\n\nFelipe\n\nDollars.\n\nRafael\n\nBut, I mean, everybody was doing that for free. The director...\n\nFelipe\n\nThe costumer.\n\nRafael\n\nThe cameraman... We just spent $7000 doing for costumes and renting some stuff. But almost everyone was working for free there.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhose concept was it? Do you guys come up with all the concepts, or you know, youâve got a team of people around you that help you with the visual side of things?\n\nRafael\n\nI think it was us and [Mikael Stornfelt] the director. You know, the director played a big role there. Actually, this video is like a stripped down version of another video that we wanted to do, but maybe it would have cost $30,000 or $40,000.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhat was the original concept?\n\nRafael\n\nIt was a whole story, and almost all of the, how you say? The characters in the video are the characters from the story. We just couldnât do the story, so we said, âOkay, letâs just put them one after the other and try to make some sense of it.â\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAnd I guess, at this point in time, so before this video came out, it must be noted that you put out the album yourselves. The first album, which that track was taken off, put out by yourself, whatâs happening at this point in time? Did you feel like it was easy? Was it easy putting out an album by yourselves?\n\nFelipe\n\nI think never. Itâs never easy, at least in Lima. We had the label for quite a time at this point, but we were releasing only as a net label, free stuff, Zolcan Breaker albums and other stuff from our friends.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nYou said it was hard. Just give us an idea of what is the music industry like in Lima? Does a music industry actually exist, and what are the difficulties being an artist trying to release music in Lima?\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, I mean, itâs really difficult. In no way were we thinking about getting the radio or stuff like that. No, we were just thinking we need to release the album. So luckily, we had the collective, which made a platform for us to do the record. I think thatâs the most important thing, is that we were doing the collective. Which I think without it we wouldnât be able to release the video or the album or almost anything.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, you need a platform to present your stuff, because the industry there is like only focused on pop culture and more tropical pop music, and thatâs it, no more. So a rock artist as well and every different kind of music has to make the platform themselves.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nExactly what we were talking about at the very beginning when I introduced you guys... What I think is really incredible about your guysâ story is this whole feeling of, when you live in Lima, when you grow up in Peru, you feel so disconnected. And even with the Internet now, yeah, of course everyoneâs more connected than ever before, but meeting someone face-to-face, sitting down, having a beer, doing all those kind of things still goes so much further. And you can still feel so, so disconnected, and thereâs a number of people in this audience who come from very far-off countries and can feel disconnected. Putting that album out by yourselves, coming up with a great concept for a video, shooting and making a great video. What were the next steps that you guys took? How did you all of a sudden go from, youâve got this great product, but all of a sudden you managed to get it out there and get a lot of peopleâs attention?\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, we started working with a booker, an agency that is from France, but they are based in Lima because they do a festival in the jungle once a year, and a few other stuff in the city. So thatâs very important to us to start working with them so that we can go and tour and everything, just because of that. They are making all the connections for the festivals and everything. Without that, I think it would be almost impossible for us.\n\nRafael\n\nI think, also the parties that we run in Lima played a big role there, because we started to make the party, and it started to grow and grow and grow, and suddenly we were having emails from people from all the parts of the world saying, âHey, I want to play in your party.â That meant that some people were checking it out.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nTell us a bit about... Well, weâve got a video, actually, but Iâd love to know a bit about your parties. How often do you do your parties? What can I expect at your party if Iâm going there for the first time? Whatâs the vibe like?\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, at first, they were a bit small, maybe 300 or 400 people, and then suddenlyâ¦\n\nRafael\n\nWhich at that time, felt like a lot.\n\nFelipe\n\nIt was a lot. And we started making that, and suddenly, the next party was 500, and the next party was 800, and suddenly, we said like, âOkay, we have to move to a big club.â So the next party was 1000 and, you know, started growing and growing. I think the vibe there was really nice, no fights at all. Everyone was, a lot of drinking going on.\n\nRafael\n\nThe great thing about this party is that it unites two scenes that were really far away before, the tropical scene and the electronic scene. Before we started to do this party with all the people, I think most of the electronic people that liked electronic music were like, âNo, no, thatâs tropical music. I really donât want to do nothing with it,â and the same thing from the other side. When we started doing this party, we could see all of those people together. That was maybe one of the greatest things.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nNow, as a byproduct of that, are there a number of producers in Lima that have found themselves on the dancefloor at your parties, have been inspired and are now doing their own experimentations and bringing those two worlds together?\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, I think there were a lot of people doing the same thing at the same time, and itâs very cool, because each one will have his own take on it. Itâs very interesting to hear all that in the same party. Because we work with these guys, because itâs not too much projects going on, maybe like five or six, and I think thatâs the main cool thing about the music of the parties.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nWhere does it fit into Lima today? Lima in 2014, obviously youâve given us a bit of a context for how Limaâs been historically, but yeah, Lima right now. Whatâs it like to be going out, to be making music in Lima?\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, I think itâs great time to be there in Lima, no? Itâs the first time we have an actual scene that is ours, so that feeling, itâs all over the place. The crowd are feeling it, the producers are feeling it. So we just feel the creativity in the air there. Thereâs maybe, like Felipe said, maybe at the beginning there were just five or six producers going, but now there are lots of little kids trying to do it as well.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nShould we watch the video from Lima, the party video?\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, this is like a short video about the parties and the scene. Okay.\n\n(video: Lima Cumbia documentary)\n\n[applause]\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo thatâs, thatâs the club night, right? Thatâs filmed at the, it happens once every two months, yeah?\n\nFelipe\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative].\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nI think Iâve got to ask the question. The masks. Theyâre very cool, and anyone that knows a little bit about Dengue Dengue Dengue!, the mask thing comes up. Tell us about the masks, what do they represent, and how important has it been for you guys to have that look as well?\n\nRafael\n\nWell since weâve been working together for eight years, we already had other projects going on. So for us, it was a way to make a difference between those projects and Dengue. So it was not Felipe or Rafael. It was just Dengue. Because even most of our friends didnât know it was us at the beginning. We just put the mask, and they were like, âWho are those guys?â Which was great. Another thing about using the masks was that we wanted to maybe represent, in our own way, the parties that were going on around Peru, the typical parties. So they wear masks, and they are very colorful, and I think for this project in particular, it just made sense to be playful.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo the masks, in terms of the colors, the designs in them, theyâve got connection to Peruvian historical culture?\n\nRafael\n\nSome of them.\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, the neon colors are used a lot in the Chicha movement, and they use the big, like posters, and they are printed in three colors that are like pink, green, and yellow, neon. Thatâs like kind of a relation we make.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nI donât know if youâve actually, any of the reasons behind it were along this line of thinking, but how important do you think it is in this day and age, especially with the way social medial works, to have something a little bit different? Anyone thatâs been to a Dengue concert performance will know that as soon as you guys jump on, youâre getting far more Instagram shares than the dude in the t-shirt before you, you know? Was that something you thought about? That people love to...?\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, I donât know. When you have a mask on, you become someone else, you know? And people like it very much because you donât have this quiet dude mixing their likeâ¦ [imitates DJ] You know? You have some crazy guy like, âWhaa,â [pumps fist in the air] going crazy there, and... So I think thatâs cool for the audience.\n\nRafael\n\nYeah, and as you said, it helped us make a difference between us, other projects that we also have and also other projects from other people.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nI think we should hear something. Weâre going to throw it out to you guys very, very soon, got time for a few more things. Recently, just a few months back, you released an EP on Branko, who is actually here RBMA, his label Enchufuda. How did that come about releasing that EP and then linking with JoÃ£o [Barbosa]?\n\nRafael\n\nWell, it was great. At the beginning, we heard this Boiler Room thing that they did with Buraka, which they introduced this Zouk Bass thing, and we were like, âWow, man, whatâs that?â We wanted to have our own take on that, mix it a little bit with a Cumbia, because the tempos are quite similar. So we did a track called âLa Cumba,â and just at the time they asked us for a track for the series they have, and we sent that track. They liked it, so from then on, we just felt comfortable with them. They are a great team. So we said, âYeah, OK, letâs release an EP with you guys.â\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nItâs kind of interesting in this day and age, anything that is rhythm-based music, rhythm-based club music that comes from South America, Africa, or the Caribbean, itâs all... Thereâs this term, tropical bass, or global bass. [laughs] How do you guys feel about everything being sandwiched under the one umbrella term?\n\nRafael\n\nSometimes it applies well, but sometimes itâs just... I donât know, itâs just weird. Because I mean sometimes we are doing some Cumbia or Zouk thing, but sometimes weâre just thinking about the techno side, or... So I donât know, maybe sometimes it doesnât really capture the whole thing, I think. I donât know, thereâs no other way to describe it, I think, so we just need to use that.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nFelipe? The term? You donât mind it?\n\nFelipe\n\nWhat?\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nIt being everything, everyone being kind of put under âtropical bass.â\n\nFelipe\n\nThe thing is that now, I think, itâs like we donât even do Cumbia anymore. [laughs] Itâs just like our take on roots of music and tropical music, at first from South America, but now we also like stuff from Africa, so thatâs what weâre talking... Weâre traveling a lot now, so we just like to be influenced by everything weâre listening to or, be in the street with different cultures and maybe go to the market on Saturday and buying some weird vegetables or whatever... Being influenced by that, I think, has changed a lot what our take on music.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nIn the last six months to a year, musically, what have been the biggest kind of new inspirations that have come as a byproduct of traveling, would you say?\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah.\n\nRafael\n\nAfrican music.\n\nFelipe\n\nAfrican music, I think, because we just make this connection between the roots of South American music, and it was mixed a lot with African music because of the colonies that were there. They were bringing slaves from Africa at that time. And then the slaves were free, and with all this came a lot of music from Senegal and different parts of Africa. Itâs really interesting. In Lima, there was this huge movement during the â50s called Criollo music as well that is influenced in African music mixed with Spanish that was the colonizers at that time. I just want to play a little bit of that, because itâs really something.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo Criollo music. Music of Criollo.\n\nFelipe\n\nCriollo music.\n\n(music: Arturo âZamboâ Cavero â unknown)\n\nRafael\n\nOkay, so with this rhythm, which is based on this wooden box, which you sit down on it and play it like this [mimes playing], called Cajon. And also the donkey jaw, which has a really crunchy sound.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, itâs like the bone of the jaw of the donkey that has theâ¦\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nOh, a donkey jaw.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, the teeth are still on, so that when you hit it they shake and make this like, âShh-shh-shh!â-kind of sound.\n\nRafael\n\nSo with that, with this one.\n\nFelipe\n\nSo a sample of the same guys called Arturo âZamboâ Cavero. It was a big thing on Criollo music.\n\n(music: Dengue Dengue Dengue! â unknown)\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nDid you sample this? Is this one of yours?\n\n[music continues]\n\nFelipe\n\nItâs not mastered, so itâsâ¦\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nSo thatâs forthcoming. Thatâs something forthcoming from you guys. Thatâs not been released yet. Iâll stop it here and pass it out to any questions. Whatâs interesting is that in one way for you guys, going back to revisit old Cumbias and music of Peru was in some way going full circle. But when you think back to the history of Cumbia, itâs like going even more full circle.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nAnd constantly exploring old rhythms, right? Experimentation and percussions.\n\nFelipe\n\nAlso from electronics, like if we start liking another rhythm, were going to try to mash it up with something. It always works.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nHas anyone got any questions?\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me?\n\nFelipe\n\nOkay.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThanks for coming. I was wondering where you source your drums. Do you play a lot of live drums when you record tracks? Do you use a lot of samples?\n\nFelipe\n\nSometimes we use a machine, but itâs really like programming, and I really like 808 sounds, and I have this huge bag of every drum kit you can imagine, so I just choose whatever goes better with the samples that I use.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI was thinking more about the samples though?\n\nFelipe\n\nOh, the sampling.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThe breaks andâ¦\n\nFelipe\n\nAh, sometimes we use stuff from old Cumbia, for example, or these old recordings, but sometimes I just use the rhythm, and I reproduce it in an electronic way, but I take the timing and everything from there.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThank you.\n\nFelipe\n\nThank you, man.\n\nAudience Member\n\nHi.\n\nFelipe\n\nHello.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOkay. Iâm from Italy, and right now there are quite a lot of producers that are making stuff really inspired by Latin rhythms, etcetera. What are your feelings about somebody appropriating of your culture?\n\nFelipe\n\nNot at all...\n\nRafael\n\nI think we love it.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, we love that. I donât feel like anyone is appropriating, because itâs a mixture of a lot of stuff, so itâs not just ours. It comes from other places as well. And yeah. I really like the Clap! Clap! Itâs what we like. We like this kind of take.\n\nRafael\n\nWe encourage people actually to do it.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm glad to hear that because I love Clap! Clap! I love NiÃ±os du Brasil. Iâm also making some kind of stuff like that, so better to know that. Iâm allowed to do stuff.\n\nFelipe\n\nCool, man. Thatâs amazing.\n\nAudience Member\n\nOkay, sorry. I was really curious about the longer story, the longer version of your video. I wonder if we could get like a little exclusive summary of the story.\n\nFelipe\n\nWell, thatâs what we could make for a day of filming. It wasnât too much material really. We have another one.\n\nRafael\n\nThe original story was, do you remember the guy that was playing the cowbell?\n\nAudience Member\n\nYeah.\n\nRafael\n\nOkay, so he was driving us to a party. Heâs kind of like a bodyguard for us. We get inside the party, and we have no faces, and we are in the party, and for example, weâre trying to drink something, and because we donât have a mouth, it just spills down, or stuff like that. And then at some point, we have a bag, and from that bag, we pull a mask, and when we put that mask on, the whole place changes with the artwork of the mask. And we have like three different masks.\n\nFelipe\n\nIt was like five at the first time.\n\nRafael\n\nEvery time we change it, the whole thing changes with us. So imagine the budget for that.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, it was like a big party. It was a lot of people, so it was really hard to get to that point.\n\nRafael\n\nI think that at some day we will do it, I think.\n\nFelipe\n\nYeah, weâll make the complete version of it, like a short or something.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI hope to see that.\n\nNick Dwyer\n\nIs that it? Rafael and Felipe, thank you so much for coming.\n\nFelipe\n\nThank you guys.\n\nRafael\n\nThanks for having us.\n\nFelipe\n\nItâs really nice to be here again."
