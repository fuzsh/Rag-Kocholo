        "text": "Coming to a strange part of copyright. This song was written by Suno 3.5. I took the singing from the rendering Suno did, and replaced all the other instruments to make it clearer-sounding (Though I admit Suno did a better job mixing).\n\nNow I’ve done a partial cover of a song that no one wrote.\n\nHow does this work legally?\n\nDo I need to credit the “no one” as the composer?\n\nI get a fair number of requests for CDs and signed things, and I’ve never sold any of that. It didn’t seem cool.\n\nBut premium multi-color vinyl with a signed poster? Okay, that’s cool.\n\nThe folks over at Battle For Dream Island have been working on this with me. I’m pretty excited about it!\n\nMiniFAQ\n\nWhen will this come out?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nHow much will this cost?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nWhere can I order it?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nHow will you sign the posters?\n\nMetallic Sharpie. Gold, Silver, and Copper.\n\nOne of my Holy Grails of music production has been made!\n\nYou can put any audio file in, and it will make sheet music for you.\n\nAnthemScore 4\n\nThere is a 30 day free trial, so you certainly see if it works for you.\n\nSergio’s Magic Dustbin\n\nThis piece starts very slow and builds… like Bolero. Unlike Bolero, this piece builds beyond the safety limit and gets crazy. I recommend you check out the piece from 1 minute 48 seconds in. There are several break points you can start from to get to the crazy payoff faster, or use the whole thing!\n\nYou can purchase from iTunes here!\n\nBrain Dance\n\nImmerse yourself in the pulsating beats of “Brain Dance,” a sonic experience that plunges you deep into the heart of the Sixth World. Conjured amidst the neon glow and astral currents of a dystopian Seattle, this track is the essence of a Decker’s paradise.\n\nSynthwave textures weave an intricate matrix around you, leaving you entangled in its cybernetic allure. Deck in, chummer, and let the futuristic soundscape rewrite your reality. Wait… what universe is this set in?\n\nYou can purchase from iTunes here!"
