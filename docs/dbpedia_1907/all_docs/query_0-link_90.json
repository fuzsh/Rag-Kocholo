        "text": "Welcome back to Selections, a series of artist-curated playlists from those in the know.\n\nVery few underground musicians have been able to ascend into the mainstream as seamlessly as Eliza Rose has over the past few years. The B.O.T.A. (Baddest Of Them All) star, alongside DJ Interplanetary Criminal, dominated global charts throughout the summer of 2022 with their uptempo, platinum-certified banger. Since then, they’ve both been on a roll.\n\nRose, however, isn’t some overnight sensation. The DJ and vocalist from Hackney has always admired sound system culture and blissful vocals, a foundation for her future, unique sound. Her first job was at the popular independent record store Flashback Records in Shoreditch as a teen, where she amassed her first collection of heaters spanning from peak 90s garage to glossy R&B from the States, legacy soul, Eurodance and more.\n\nThis passion for music and innate ability to get people moving now translates into her hybrid live show – a dynamic combination of her infectious vocals and mixing that makes her one of the most lively acts touring today.\n\nRose’s next stop is a trip to Bristol for Beavertown’s Collaboration Sessions this Saturday (10 August). The British brewery has invited her to perform a special b2b with femme culture co-founder Elkka for their open-air party at the city’s newest venue, The Prospect Building. Other acts billed include Future Bounce boss and Radio 6 selector Jamz Supernova, UK afro-jazz collective Nubyian Twist and ragga music icon General Levy.\n\nTo celebrate the party, Rose has blessed us with “a selection of new and old skool goodies to get you moving” – an assorted mix featuring Elkka, Timbaland, MJ Cole, Wisdom Teeth’s K-Lone and UK R&B legends Loose Ends.
