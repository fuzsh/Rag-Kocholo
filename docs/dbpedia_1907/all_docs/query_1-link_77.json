        "text": "Techno Cumbia (English Translation) Lyrics\n\nArtist: Selena\n\nAlbum: 12 Super Exitos\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease remember! This translation is my personal work. It is sometimes difficult to translate word for word from Spanish to English, so it may sound awkward in one languange when it is perfectly natural in the other. But I think you can get the general idea!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you've come to dance\n\nWell then let's have some fun\n\nIf you've come to sleep,\n\nGet out of here\n\nThis is the rhythm of my cumbia\n\nthat's going to move you\n\nthe techno-cumbia that I bring you\n\nwill please you\n\nso that you move your body\n\nfrom head to foot\n\nAnd now that we're partying,\n\neverybody say:\n\nHey, hey, oh, oh\n\nHey! Don't leave me alone\n\nThis blowout (burst) is for everyone\n\nIf you've come to dance\n\nWell then let's have some fun\n\nIf you've come to sleep,\n\nGet out of here\n\nBecause this song isn't for any lazy people\n\nIf you're still sitting, throw your chair to one side\n\nDance, dance without stopping\n\nThere's no time for resting\n\nThis dance is for you\n\nI want to see you sweat\n\nMove it over here, move it over there\n\nThis is the new dance called technocumbia\n\nI look around and I'm noticing something\n\nthat there are some people who are not dancing\n\nDance, dance without stopping\n\nThere's no time to rest\n\nThis dance is for you\n\nI want to see you sweat\n\nMove it over here, move it over there\n\nThis is the new dance called technocumbia\n\nLook at Juan he can't even move\n\nwell his shoes are heavy\n\nhe must have tracked in a lot of mud\n\nLook at Maria she doesn't move from her seat\n\nthat's what always happens\n\nwhen you eat too many tortillas\n\nLook at Jose well he's just sitting there\n\nHe drank too many beers\n\nand now he walks sideways\n\nLook at Rosa she doesn't want to get up\n\nbecause her stockings are torn\n\nDon't go looking at her\n\nMove it, move it, and stop\n\nMove it, move it, and stop\n\nMove it, move it, and stop\n\nDon't move it so much, stop"
