        "text": "Hey Desta it’s great to catch up with you and how’s 2024 been for you so far and what have been the highlights?\n\nDefinitely being on tour earlier this year and being able to make some new music in Texas with some great musicians. I learned so much. I have a cumbia song in the pipeline with Pricipe Q, who is actually Selena Quintanilla’s nephew. We met last year which was a trip in itself but we really got along and both decided we really wanted to make music together. We made a pretty sick cumbia and have some really great musicians on the track. I learned soooo much about cumbia Tejana have a new found respect for it.\n\nYou’re about to headline the LatinoLife In The Park festival and for those that don’t know your music how would you describe it in terms of sounds etc?\n\nI genuinely find it hard to explain, everything shifts so much depending on song, mood, project but I guess I explore sounds from genres from Latin America, and mix them up with some of my other influences like RnB, Hip Hop, Jazz and Afrobeat.\n\nHow important do you think the LatinoLife In The Park Festival is to London and what’s your greatest takeaway from having such an event in your hometown?\n\nIt’s great that there is a place where Latinos can go and connect with each other. It’s important that events like this happen as it’s a place where we and the whole of London can celebrate shared memories and also become aware of rising Latino talent in the UK.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to on the day?\n\nI’m going to be performing a couple of Classics and I think the audience will really enjoy it. I don’t do covers all that often but being able to sing some in front of such a big Latino audience is going to be magical, especially with a full band. Rehearsals should be fun.\n\nYou first exploded on the scene with your “Shame” single and can you talk us through your key releases so far and how they changed things for you?\n\n“Shame” was the first time I was introduced to the music scene in the UK and beyond. It was on so few plays on Soundcloud when it was picked up by Colors in Berlin at a time when they were really still quite niche and new. This allowed me to work with more producers in the industry although at that time I hadn’t yet ‘found a sound’ and had virtually no experience playing live. I remember being so so scared and could barely open my eyes. I’ve thought about what kind of performance I would bring there now that so much of what I do has changed and developed.\n\n“San Lazarus” which I released in 2020 was another key moment for me. I had turned down quite a nice deal for some music I had made, but I decided to put this project out instead. It was my first bi-lingual project following a really testing 2 years and it really felt like a ‘coming of age’ type moment with the music and in life. Things just flowed and it felt important. One of the songs on there was played on Radio 1xtra by Jamz Supernova and it was fully in Spanish. I kinda knew that it was a moment for me, but also for future artists releasing music in a similar vein here.\n\nDo you have a favourite release and what’s so special?\n\nProbablemente “Alguien”. I was able to work with some musicians in Colombia who have worked on some of my favourite records and my mum’s favourite bands like El Grupo Niche and Herencia De Timnbiqui. It was produced by Giovanni Caldaz who is from Cali, and it was so nice to work with someone from where I’m from in Colombia.\n\nWhen did you start making music and who and what were your early inspirations?\n\nEarly inspiration was a lot of Jazz music, RnB and Salsa. I started making music just after uni with a producer I met but had been singing with since I was in school. I was in a lot of musicals growing up too.\n\nWhat is your most memorable studio session and who was it with and where was it and which track felt the most exciting while in the process of making it?\n\nI have had many amazing sessions. A recent one that springs to mind was during my recent trip to Texas. I was in Corpus Christie which is where Selena was born. I went to see her statue by the beach and was making music with her nephew, Principe Q, who’s a great friend now. It felt like some kind of pilgrimage…I couldn’t believe It. It was definitely like I had manifested it myself. We spent the day at Dusty’s studio, who is an electronic Cumbia legend, so the whole thing was just a trip for me. We made a cumbia called ‘Chamba’ which will be out soon.\n\nOf Colombian and Italian heritage, how did you first get into music and what were the early sounds that inspired you and how did you hear them?\n\nThe first sounds were definitely what my mum was listening to which was Salsa and Cumbia around the house and at family parties.I didn’t realise the impact of this influence that would feature in my music until much later. When I first started singing over records it was more jazzy, RnB and I’m still inspired by lots of American style rnb artists like Toni Braxton. I was always attracted to music that was way older than my years even when I was really young\n\nThe first sounds I remember hearing at home were Cumbia, Salsa and Vallenato. Also a bit later when I found some friends, reggaeton. I also listen to a lot of Jazz, Soul and Hip Hop. My ears were never drawn too much to popular music. I feel I was a very melancholic and beat my own drum type of kid.\n\nWhat was your first big break and what did it lead on to?\n\nNot sure that I have had a big break. As I said before when ‘Shame’ came out I got a lot of attention as a new bubbling artist. I have since toured Mexico and the USA and had some shows independently and they always use that video to push it so it’s definitely has an impact and continues to peak people’s interest and I’m grateful for that\n\nYou have just curated your first Latinas of London showcase at the Jazz Cafe with your platform ‘La Chonga’ and how did it go? Are there plans to do more shows?\n\nIt was really incredible. Two years prior to this I had a sold-out show there and was so proud as I don’t believe other Latina UK artists making music in English and Spanish had done that before. So when I was offered another ahow I knew this was the right thing to do. I feel passionate about supporting other female artists, especially seeing how hard it has been to push my music and I wish that I had someone I trusted who showed that kind of support. There’s another Latinas Of London show planned for January,\n\nYou’re also behind the ‘Tia Mia’ night which celebrates women in latin music and after your Moth Club debut, how was the reaction and again are there plans to host more of these events?\n\nYes, it’s such fun. We have a line up of the sickest LatinX DJs in the heart of Hackney and I feel a lot of pride being able to showcase how rich our culture is in a space that fully embraces everyone regardless of sex, age and gender. It’s a really powerful night and by far my favourite club night in the UK. We will drop the next one at another venue but the Moth Club has been a great home for the last few events.\n\nYou’ve lived in Mexico, toured some of America and appeared at the SXSW Festival and can you talk us through some of the most exciting moments you’ve experienced touring and living in another country?\n\nJust being able to do shows with a band in another continent is amazing in itself. I made so many great friends who now make up part of my band out there and collaborators I will always work with. Mexico really is so special to me. It’s a cliche but when I went out there I was in need of a big spiritual hug and that’s what my time out there was like. Good for my spirit and soul…from the people, the music to the temperature of life out there.\n\nWho are your major musical influences and how have they informed your music making?\n\nTo many to mention. At the moment I’m obsessed with a band called Los Sufridos. I love Daniel, me estás matando. Most things on Fania Records. Then there’s Angel Canales, Ile, Hurricane G…it’s shifts! As you can see.\n\nDesta French headlines LatinoLife In The Park Festival alongside Jimmy Saa, Dukus, Classico Latino and many more on Saturday 20th July at Ealing’s Walpole Park, Mattocks Lane, W5 5EQ.
