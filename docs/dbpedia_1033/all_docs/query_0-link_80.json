Robert W. Grow\n\nThe history of cavalry begins well before classical times and ends, it may be argued, at the turn of the twenty-first century. The saga of the warhorse is a roller coaster through millennia as cavalry gained, lost, then regained ascendancy via technical and doctrinal metamorphosis. Mechanization imposed an epiphanic moment that resurrected cavalry, yet finally abandoned the warhorse to its temporal restrictions—though not its temperament and style. By the mid-twentieth century, cavalry had embraced tanks and had resurrected so-called armored cavalry. Converts to mechanization argued that this restored prowess and that massed tanks, like Mongol armies, were well nigh to a strategic arm. The Second World War, the apex of armored warfare, was also the last great theater for mounted cavalry operations. The warhorse, dragooned into service beside the tank, endured a few years of dramatic activity and then was pronounced obsolete. It persevered via technical transmutation as armored cavalry—a modern cathedral to medieval tactics. At the acme of its operational triumph (1991), cavalry was a multifaceted, all-arms juggernaut. Following the Gulf War, the cataphract host was declared an anachronism as the U.S. Army embraced the cybernetic revolution. Robotic reconnaissance devices and collections of digitized formations appeared with enthusiastic fanfare. Anxious cavalrymen, veterans of the last great cavalier host that fought in the Arabian Desert, sounded the alarm as military progressives dictated the future of air-mobile, mix-and-match armies:\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track The current organizational design and intellectual underpinning of our Future Force do nothing less than signal the demise of Cavalry within the conventional forces of the United States Army, assuring its placement on the ash heap of history along with coastal artillery.1\n\nIn the spring of 2006, the Pentagon announced plans to close Fort Knox (the revered “Home of Armor and Cavalry”) and move its chattel to the Infantry School. The future of armored cavalry may rest in philosophical definition, specifically the thesis presented by Maj. General Robert W. Grow. The cavalier general, a decorated commander of the 6th Armored Division and veteran of spectacular romps through Normandy and spirited panzer battles in Lorraine, concluded that “Cavalry is a state of mind.” General Grow’s thesis offered hope to modern cavaliers. There exists the predictable caveat: any defense of cavalry threatens to become a polemic for the warhorse. Guilty. Warhorse is a quixotic term and has many references—from musical (Beet­ hoven’s Fifth Symphony, Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons, “Hail to the Chief ”) to personalities (Gen. Robert E. Lee referred to General Longstreet as his Old War Horse). The term suggests a solid, trustworthy persona. The warhorse and its tribal collective, the cavalry, evolved from a tactical arm to an operational, even strategic, instrument of war. The horse, despite the triumph of technology, continues to occupy a beloved and special place in modern society. Man loves the horse. During the 2006 running of the Preakness Stakes, a thoroughbred named Barbaro pulled short after the start with a badly broken leg—victim of an accidental contact with another horse. Barbaro was spared and initially rescued via costly surgery and rehabilitation. The drama made the evening news and front pages for months. When Barbaro was subsequently diagnosed with systemic laminitis (a disease of the hoof) in his other hind leg, that too made front-page news and shared copy with wars, typhoons, and terrorist attacks.2 Barbaro, though a pampered prima donna, could not have been more appreciated had he carried the secretary of war into a Taliban stronghold. Conversely, had a rocket or road mine destroyed an Abrams tank lovingly stenciled Barbaro across its 120 mm gun, its reduction to junkyard status would not have merited any more notice than a fender-bender in New York City.3 Therein lies the difference between cavalry and tanks. Man’s affection for the horse embraces visions of a noble loyal steed. It is, of course, true. But the horse is also a nasty bit of work—moody, skittish, and vindictive. It requires expert care, patient training, and expensive accoutrements. It enjoys a snotty class system—the best-looking chargers are not necessarily the best warriors but certainly the most popular. The classic Arab is far more appreciated than the shaggy little Afghan. Both went to war. Some breeds emerged by accident, and others after careful husbandry to produce either mobility or the stamina to carry armored warriors. Cataphract cavalry\n\nCavalry and the Operational Art\n\n(from the Greek for “armored cavalry”) appeared regularly throughout history; it reached a zenith during the Middle Ages, particularly after gunpowder appeared. Europeans encased themselves in metallic suits and strapped themselves onto gargantuan steeds. The characteristics of the warhorse are essentially maneuver mixed with shock. As the last vestige of chivalry, the armored warhorse was a plodding furniture van—the same nickname given to Tiger tanks by their crews during the Second World War. When Gen. Jean Baptiste Chedeville noted, in 1918, that “Le Char est très délicat” (The tank is delicate), he was referring to its operational limitations. The tank’s initial similarities to the warhorse were a fragile constitution, a constant need for attention, and vulnerability to both rough ground and high-velocity weapons. It also mirrored the warhorse’s best martial quality—the capability to deliver shock. However, the tank carried none of the horse’s symbiotic associations or charming tendencies. A Warhorse Lexicon The military terminology associated with the cavalry and the operational art, a vocabulary that includes Auftragstaktik and deep battle, begs some clarification—if only by means of a selected lexicon. Strategy and tactics are familiar yet misleading terms. The military lexicon includes a cornucopia of terms inspired by technology, and though dated, many survive, ubiquitous enough to remain useful. Auftragstaktik (German: auf, “from”; trag, “task”) refers to mission-directed tactics that are inspired actions by subordinates, which, while not specifically ordered, serve to secure the higher goals and visions of a great commander in chief. These lend themselves well to cavalry operations but require inspired leadership from a captain blessed with Fingerspitzengefühl [finger spitz en ghe full], which is a sixth sense, intuitive comprehension: “thinking in the saddle.” Auftragstaktik includes the expectation that junior leaders will use their initiative “even if it entails deviating from the mission and/or disobeying orders [emphasis added].”4 A modern German interpretation of Auftragstaktik contends its origins were Prussian introspection after the defeat. Helmut von Moltke, the creator of operational command and control, defined it as how “the subordinate is to act within the guidelines of his superior’s intent.”5 Other Cavalry Terms Reconnaissance or Recce [Rhe kee] (Cavalry Slang) This refers to getting information about the enemy. In addition to being a strike or pursuit force, the cavalry provides commanders with early warning and intelligence via reconnaissance patrols or operations. Modern reconnaissance\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nis increasingly electronic, but traditional reconnaissance operations were conducted by cavalry for about four millennia. The last formal military reconnaissance using both the horse and tank was conducted by the French and Russian armies, although the new century has recently witnessed surreal incidents in the mountains of the Hindu Kush. Cavalry Screens Cavalry patrols are thrown out in front of an advancing army or in the path of an invader to act as a trip wire. The so-called screen sniffs out the enemy and often resorts to sneaky-peeky tactics, but offensive screens must be robust and capable of fighting for information. The defensive screen is more than a cordon sanitaire; it also provides vital information. Its aim is to offer enough resistance to force the enemy to push harder and reveal his intent—the direction of his attack. Effective reconnaissance requires aggressive horsemen and inspired leadership. Great generals cannot practice the operational art without precise reports. Vanguards Represent the leading edge of an attacking force. This first formation is partly reconnaissance in that it seeks information and develops the situation. It is usually a combination of all arms (infantry, cavalry, armor, artillery, engineers, and immediate logistics). The vanguard moves quickly and secures key terrain or frustrates countermaneuver. It is strong enough that if it cannot defeat the enemy to its front, the commander of the main body is made aware he faces a mass of the enemy or has found a spot the enemy intends to defend resolutely. Blitzkrieg The term blitzkrieg [bliz kreeg] means, literally, “lightning war”—a grand tactical cocktail that used air attack and mechanized armies to disrupt the enemy via speed and shock. Blitzkrieg has many fathers and many variations, but the original tank with airplane version is German, circa 1930s, inspired by the British military philosophe General John Frederick Charles Fuller, and developed by a succession of Prussian generals from von Seeckt to Guderian. Blitzkrieg begins with a formal attack to achieve breakthrough. The central effort (Schwerpunkt 6) creates a rupture large enough to introduce armored divisions. These units, combining tanks and armored infantry, race deep into the enemy territory creating terror and collapse. It is intimately supported by ground attack from its air force. Blitzkrieg, as so-called grand tactics, is a major part of the mechanized operational art and causes enough chaos to create military and political collapse—good examples are Attila the Hun in the fifth century, the German invasion of France in 1940, and both American invasions of Iraq.\n\nCavalry and the Operational Art\n\nDeep Battle The term deep battle refers to big-league tactics—the ultimate operational statement. The technique thrusts a large mobile or mechanized force deep into enemy terrain. The extent of the penetration is gargantuan and capable of surrounding capitals or entire groups of armies. Deep battle can dispatch a nation or series of nations. It requires great sophistication and a complex organization. It can also be practiced by a force culturally disposed to do so—Attila the Hun’s or Genghis Khan’s armies. Deep battle was made modern by the Russians. Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevskii called it Glubokii Boi (Hlib as in “glib,” boi as in “boy”). It continues to be practiced by modern armies as a dynamic solution—a step beyond blitzkrieg. Recent examples are Operation Cobra in Normandy (1944), the Destruction of Army Group Center, eastern front (1944), and Operation Cobra II, the 2003 tsunami against Iraq. Basic Military Organizations The Troop versus the Platoon Both are essentially the same thing—the smallest tactical unit led by an officer, usually a lieutenant. Each is approximately 30 soldiers. Troops are cavalry organizations but are used by artillery and engineers in many armies. A troop is the horsy equivalent of the platoon. Squadrons versus Companies Squadron is again a cavalry term but is often used by other arms and services. It is a larger grouping of troops. The American cavalry squadron is equivalent to a battalion or regiment. Regiment A regiment is a grouping of at least two squadrons—more than four is rare. It is often confused with the term battalion. Regiments may be tactical organizations or ad hoc groupings. A regiment is also a tribal term or a parent company. Regiments carry the traditions and historical battle honors of their particular clique. They may spawn siblings, each a carbon copy of the parent organization. For example, the Black Watch, Royal Highland Regiment raised several battalions for war—identified as 1st or 2nd Black Watch. American examples include the United States Marine Corps—the First Marine Regiment comprises four battalions (its 4th Marine battalion is sometimes referred to as “the Fourth of the First”). While British Commonwealth regiments are parental administrative organizations, many countries (the United States and Russia, for example) also use the term regiment as a tactical unit. The largest cavalry outfit is the American Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), a robust\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nformation festooned with tanks, scouts, artillery, and helicopters—the final word in cavalry clout. Brigades These are a collection of battalions. The brigade is often the first organization to offer formal groupings of so-called arms. The combat arms comprise three types of fighting troops: infantry, cavalry, and artillery (combat engineers were formally included after the technological contests of the Second World War). Two or more brigades make up a division. Two or more divisions make a corps—these are the largest organizations to actively deal in maneuver and combat. Two or more corps form an army—although the term army is regularly used to describe any larger fighting corporation. Modern brigades, divisions, and particularly corps are large corporate toolboxes. They feature complex headquarters, various attached specialized units, and cadres that include everything from medicine to public relations. A corps, often augmented by specialist brigades, is capable of operational maneuver. It is much like a holding company—it sends out its divisions to conduct tactical battles while it controls a campaign (a series of battles). Corps are capable of strategic results; for example, a couple of panzer corps reached the English Channel in 1940, cutting apart the French army, which soon led to the surrender of Paris and an armistice. The Three Classic Tactical Maneuvers There are three great tactical maneuvers in military history: the frontal attack and single envelopment (the battle of Gaugamela, Alexander the Great); the double envelopment (the battle of annihilation at Cannae, Hannibal); and the feint and flank attack (Leuthen, Frederick the Great). In the 1960s, the American army added a fourth classic maneuver via the helicopter—the vertical envelopment. The Operational Art This is a relatively modern term that describes the mechanics of warfighting. Initially a Russian (Soviet) idea introduced by Alexsandr Svechin, it was carefully ignored during most of the cold war—as were all Red Army achievements. The West, particularly the U.S. Army, embraced the concept of operation art during its military renaissance and the writing of its own deep battle doctrine, AirLand Battle, during the 1980s. Operational art deals with the business of war and incorporates the three strata: tactical, operational, and strategic. Doctrine Doctrine refers to a body of teachings or prescribed methods. In the military, it simply means “how we do things.” This carries social baggage because\n\nCavalry and the Operational Art\n\ndoctrines invariably reflect the culture and beliefs of the practicing army. Doctrine is influenced by the weapons available, such as the horse, and technology; it also reflects the cultural philosophy of the originating nation. The concept is best explained by the grand master of the operational art, Eric von Manstein: “It has always been the particular forte of German leadership to grant wide scope to the self-dependence of subordinate commanders. . . The German method is really rooted in the German character . . . [which] finds a certain pleasure in taking risks.”7 However, in an age where the movements of even individual tanks can be followed via satellite and laptops, freedom to take risks or deviate from prescribed plans is virtually impossible. Doctrine is like haute couture. Changing and dynamic, exciting doctrines are slavishly emulated by all armies. Tactics The word tactics comes from the Greek Taktikē, the art of managing military forces. It is concerned with the techniques of combat, sometimes cobbled with a new term, warfighting. Tactics reflect doctrine. For example, a submarine can fire a tactical missile at a target—this constitutes a tactical strike. However, if the weapon is nuclear and takes out Beijing or Tel Aviv, it is at once a strategic strike. One of the favored definitions is one that despite apparent simplicity, is both accurate and functional: Tactics is kicking over the pail of milk. Strategy is killing the cow. The Russian military philosopher, A. A. Svechin, notes that “tactics makes the steps from which operational leaps are assembled; strategy points out the path. . . Battle is the means of the operation. . . Tactics are the material of operational art.”8 Strategy Strategy suggests decisions with large-scale, long-term consequences (from the Greek strategos, or “general’s art”). Modern strategists include politicians as well as military philosophes: from foreign policy to titanic visions of the conduct of mass war, from J.F.C. Fuller to Tukhachevskii, from Alexander to Napoleon, from Sun Tzu to Carl von Clausewitz. The difference between tactics and strategy is simply size. This manuscript is a selected review of the operational history of cavalry with special emphasis on the horse as it morphed from symbiotic weapon to partner with the rude mechanical and, finally, a manifestation of its former medieval self as armored cavalry.\n\nChapter 2 The Classical Horse\n\nWhy did this animal that had prospered so in the Colorado Desert leave his amiable homeland for Siberia? . . . He wandered into France and became the mighty Percheron, and into Arabia, where he developed into a lovely poem of a horse, and into Africa where he became the brilliant zebra, and into Scotland, where he bred selectively to form the massive Clydesdale. He would also journey into Spain, where his very name would become the designation for gentleman, a caballero, a man of the horse. There he would flourish mightily and serve the armies that would conquer much of the known world. —James Michener\n\nThe association of the horse with warfare is buttressed with romance and routinely gives away to wistfulness. The horse became the preferred battle partner because of its attendant attributes: handsomer and easier to maneuver than the war elephant, smarter than the rhino and more effective than a war dog. Its complicated affiliation with the military is less influenced by bellicose bravado than veterinary knowledge and breeding techniques. The evolution of the horse as weapon of war, from harbinger of galloping conquest to doctrinal nuance, is based on mass. Cavalry was most effective when there was lots of it. The raising of cavalry forces was best achieved in lush valleys and open steppes—from Macedonia to the American prairie. The appearance of the horse on the North American plains, via Spanish trading and clever rustling, created an aboriginal horse culture that evoked a particular type of chivalry that dominated the buffalo and European immigrants. The North American warhorse was a renaissance marking the return to its place of origin of Eohippus,\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\na 10 inch, four-toed mammal, which had appeared one million years ago. Its eastern migration through Alaska and into Asia resulted in the Asian and European equus. The Bering Sea washed closed the land bridge to the Americas; predators, climate change, and disease eliminated the last of the American ponies. The horse, much like the Polish ancestors of the American buffalo, flourished in Asia and Europe where vast Mongolian prairies, steppes, and pushta generated great herds. Until man learned to domesticate it, the horse initially was hunted as another source of food. Thousands of years passed before the horse was ridden. Catching horses was difficult; trapping risked death and injury. Eventually the tribes of the Euphrates domesticated the horse; excavations in Syria produced the earliest evidence of horsemanship. The Mesopotamian kingdom of Nineveh, associated with the king Sennacherib and the epic of Gilgamesh, boasted light cavalry, but they were defeated by the Babylonians who had developed the war chariot. The chariot was less cavalry and more personnel carrier. In the close assault the warhorse was the symbiotic cohort to its warrior master. Bucephalus carried Alexander into the midst of enemy armies, ignoring the disruptive exotic smells of camels and elephants as well as their riders. The warhorse responded to control by knee or thigh, not reins. A good fighting horse demonstrated steadiness in confused situations and cooperated usefully with the method of attack or melee. Warhorses differed from working or sports horses in that they were specifically bred and trained for combat and required a subtle blend of individual bravado and group dynamics. They had to respond to commands that were often mere pressure by the rider’s thigh, and they were taught to ignore the sounds of war—consisting of cries of the wounded as well as the blare of accompanying martial music and drums. Considerable time was spent to overcome the horse’s aversion to the smell of blood and its natural disinclination to trample a human. Horses were trained to cripple and kill by slamming, bodychecking, and butting with their chest or flanks. They were deadly with kick, stomp, or bite. Napoleon’s cavalier, Capt. Marcellin, the Baron de Marbot, described his mare, Lisette, at the battle of Eylau: “She sprang at the Russian and at one mouthful tore off his nose, lips, eyebrows and all of his face, making him a living death’s head, dripping with blood.”1 Classical and medieval cavalry was built around the champion warrior— the armored knight. The challenge was to breed a warhorse with speed and litheness yet capable of bearing heavy metal. Battle chargers remained the private accessories of the rich and socially prestiged. The expense of training and equipping a mass of armored cavalry meant that only organized kingdoms with sizeable treasuries meddled in the operational art’s most glamorous tool—massed cavalry. The tactical result was rather standard. The cavalry charge at Crécy was much like the ones at Cannae or Waterloo: measured approach breaking into either controlled canter or fanatical gallop, followed by a\n\n10\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nconfused, determined melee. The charge was but the last act in a complex procedure of training and drill that could easily go wrong in an instant. Mounted attack was an intricate combination of courage, bravado, skill, and occasion. It was as much a triumph of the will, both human and animal, as it was a shrewd bit of timing or maneuver. The Horse as Battle Taxi A chariot of lapis lazuli, brass, ivory and golden wheels shall you have. On it pulled by horses created from thunderheads. —The Epic of Gilgamesh, Tablet VI: The Hero Returns\n\nWhile chariots are on the periphery of cavalry attack, they represent an important stage in the evolution of the warhorse. Juggernaut is a term derived from Sanskrit (Jagannatha, “Lord of the universe”) and cited to describe unstoppable, all-crushing armies. It also suggests a gargantuan war wagon but is only loosely applicable to an offensive by mass chariots. Nevertheless, during its brief domination of mobile warfare, the chariot was a fearsome weapon. Horse driven and combining the attributes of infantry assault with mobility, it preceded the tank. Like armor, it was beset with technical breakdown and thwarted by terrain and steady, disciplined infantry. The first chariots (from Latin, carrus), were four-wheeled carts pulled by oxen, tamed asses, or onagers. There were various types, and eventually the two-wheeled horse-drawn chariot proved most popular and efficient. Used for transport as well as warfare, they were common to the Bronze and Iron Ages; their use was limited to open terrain, and their weakness was the power train and suspension. The horses were relatively small—no more than ponies—while axles and wheels quickly deteriorated under the stress of weight and uneven ground, much like modern tanks. The spoked wheel improved mobility and control. Still they were no more than “battle taxis” for heroes—permitting great warriors to quickly close and duel with enemy champions. Massed chariots were more a type of self-propelled artillery delivering direct and indirect fire: a barrage of arrows and javelins or lunges with spear and sword to clear off skirmishers and archers and then disrupt steady formations. The vulnerability of chariots was that the engine was at the front and easily wounded by missiles or direct assault. Chariots with scythe blades rotating from the axles were awesome and deadly if driven through troops in open order. Direct attack depended entirely on the horse’s willingness to throw itself onto a wall of armed infantry. A phalanx’s unwavering wall of spears reduced attack to harassment at a distance. The ability to shock was mostly psychological—horses could not be made to break into formed steady masses covered by sharp objects, whether spears or bayonets. This was as true at Waterloo as it was at Arbela.\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\n11\n\nThe costs associated with the chariot limited its use. The principal warrior depended on a chauffeur and an armed subordinate like the squire of medieval knights. The subsequent battle was pretty much a raid by the rich and famous. Expensive chariots suddenly appeared and disgorged gold-chained, Armaniclad fellows swaggering into battle accompanied by pipes and Arcadian rap. Chariots delivered attackers but, perhaps more important, permitted quick escape. A noble facing capture or the onslaught of more dangerous opponents counted on his driver, parked with the chariot conveniently facing the rear, to be at the ready to deliver him to safety. The chariot’s tactical popularity appears to have peaked with the pharaoh Ramses and an action sometimes dubbed “the mother of all battles” fought in what is today Syria: the battle of Kadesh (1274 b.c.). Ramses’ invading army consisted of Egyptian infantry and a strike force of war chariots, comprised mostly of nobles, who were well matched by Hittite charioteers. Hittite vehicles, drawn by two horses, were made of wood and were tougher than the rattan vehicles used by Ramses. Lighter wheels and a better axle gave them good cross-country performance; the crew did not dismount but fought from the vehicle via long spears and javelins. The Hittites supplemented their mounted attack with attendant infantry runners who killed off wounded enemy charioteers or crippled horses left behind by an initial charge. The attending infantry were delivered into battle by chariot but dropped off before\n\n12\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\na maneuvering attack; the dismounted cadre could also be employed as skirmishers, slingers, or archers. The Egyptian army (about 20,000) was surprised by the Hittite king, Muwatallish, who outmaneuvered them with a force of about 2,000 chariots and 35,000 foot, of which over 2,500 were runners in support of the chariots. The Hittites surrounded the Egyptian camp and then assaulted from several directions and began to loot, which proved to be their undoing. Muwatallish’s aim should have been to destroy Egyptian high command (Ramses and his nobles); this was a tactic Alexander used dramatically at Gaugamela, 900 years later. It was to become the essence of blitzkrieg doctrine—cripple the decisionmaking leadership. Ramses was saved by the timely arrival of reinforcements and Hittite avarice. In the confusion of the pillage, Ramses organized a desperate breakout which soon became a counterattack. Leading a small force of chariots, the Egyptians attacked Hittite groups in sequence, gobbling them up and snatching victory from defeat. In North Europe, Celtic Britons confronted Julius Caesar with bravado and light chariots: “They drive about in all directions and throw their weapons and generally break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between the troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot.”2 The Celtic chariot carried a driver and a warrior; tactics included a rapid approach, close quarter battle, and timely withdrawal. Once dismounted, the Celts fought with a berserker ferocity that unnerved garrison troops. Forced to melee against veterans, the Britons were soon disorganized and eventually dispatched by armored and better drilled opponents. Celtic chariots had iron wheel rims and wicker work for upper armor; this combination made for a lighter battle taxi with good all-terrain capability. The Roman occupation of Britannia was challenged in a.d. 60 by Boudicca, queen of the Inceni, who lived in what is now Norfolk. “Boudicca, with her daughters before her in a chariot, went up to tribe after tribe, protesting that it was indeed usual for Britons to fight under the leadership of women.”3 Her ferocious attacks badly mauled the IX Hispania Legion and drove the Romans out of several towns, including London. The legions fled to the continent which made the emperor Nero consider abandoning Britannia all together. Regrouping in Gaul, the Romans returned with two battle-hardened formations (XIV Gemina and the XX Valeria Victrix) and gave battle in a skillfully chosen defile. Desperate charges by Inceni chariots and foot were easily defeated by an experienced heavy infantry and disciplined horse: “The cavalry, at the same time, bore down upon the enemy, and, with their pikes, overpowered all who dared to make a stand.”4 The continental chariot was considered obsolete by 400 b.c., particularly when confronted by armor and firepower. Longer ranged bows and cataphract cav-\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\n13\n\nalry relegated the war chariot to the circus maximus. Its most famous version was the four-horsed quadriga and is perpetuated via magnificent equestrian sculptures atop the Wellington Arch in London, Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, Venice’s Triumphal Quadriga, and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Classical Cavalry—The Greeks and Alexander In 480 b.c. Persian cavalry under a general Masestivs had an authentic shock action and melee. —George Patton Jr.5\n\nCavalry armed with javelin, short swords, and mail shirts appeared circa 705 b.c. The Assyrians used cavalry organized in pairs; one warrior was armed with a bow, while the other, who was unarmed, directed the horse of his companion. This soon evolved into one rider, an archer with reins around his neck, giving fire while at the gallop. In 595 b.c., the Persian monarch, Cyrus the Great, armored his cavalry and organized it into groups of one hundred, armed with lances for throwing or charging. The narrow valleys and rocky ground of the Peloponnesus did not lend itself to the raising of cavalry forces. The arm of tactical decision, the axis of Greek military strength, was the phalanx. Sparta raised infantry, Athens developed a formidable fleet, but Philip of Macedon fielded a formidable cavalry comprised of well-equipped horses including a squadron of royal horse guards. This required considerable economic and political clout.6 Mycenaean Greeks made some use of chariots, but it was Alexander’s use of cavalry as a shock weapon that gave the Greeks military dominance via a tactical balance of the heavy infantry phalanx and supporting arms. In battle, Greek cavalry hovered near the phalanx—an anvil upon which lesser arms broke. But properly led, cavalry could hammer out victory. When Alexander invaded the great empire in 334 b.c., the Persians still preferred the chariot for the attack. They are credited with having developed the original four-horsed chariots augmented with a devilish infantry-slicing sickle blade on each wheel hub. This scattered skirmishers and infantry in unsteady formations but did not worry disciplined hoplites (armored infantry). The phalanx, a veritable hedgehog of spears, stood as a rock in a sea of chariots. Alexander instructed his army to create open lanes when threatened by chariot attack. The advancing horses simply followed the path of least resistance and galloped through, falling victim to flank assaults from missiles, javelins, or spears. The wheeled fighting vehicle would not make a dynamic reappearance until the combustion engine made armored cars and tanks practical cross-country weapons.\n\n14\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nBucephalus—Archetypal Warhorse The warhorse of the Heroic Age was not large, averaging 13–14 hands. A “hand” is 4 inches—this unit of measure for equines is based on the width of a palm. The average Peloponnesian warhorse stood about four and a half feet from hoof to withers (the prominent ridge where the muscles of the neck and the back join, considered the horse’s highest constant point). The best Greek horses came out of Thessaly and regularly bred with Persian, Scythian, and much prized Ferghana horses from Turkistan. The small-bodied Greek horses were subsequently improved by masses of horses imported from the East.7 After defeating Darius, Alexander demanded a war tribute of 50,000 horses, which dramatically enhanced Mediterranean cavalry. Alexander’s warhorse, Bucephalus, rivaled the mythic status of his master. His legend was enhanced by the Delphic oracle, which foretold that the destined master of the known world would be a warrior whose horse carried the symbol of an ox head. Bucephalus may have carried this mark, but it is more likely Alexander named him Boukephalos (Greek for “ox-head”) because he had a full-bodied head, like that of a bull. Alexander bet with his father he would ride Bucephalus—a feat none of the royal handlers had managed. “ ‘And if you do not,’ said Philip, ‘What will you forfeit for your rashness?’ ‘I will pay,’ answered Alexander, ‘the whole price of the horse.’ At this the whole company fell a-laughing.”8 This was only partly bravado, for Alexander had studied the horse and noted that Bucephalus bolted at the sight of his own shadow. He led him to face the sun and then lightly stroked his neck. The “horse whisperer” technique was known in Greece where good riders sought to control a horse via calm presence, smell, and finally, touch. Force or words of command were considered unnecessary, particularly with intelligent, spirited horses: “Stroking him gently when he found him begin to grow eager and fiery, he let fall his upper garment softly, and with one nimble leap securely mounted him, and when he was seated, by little and little drew in the bridle, and curbed him without either striking or spurring him.”9 The act moved Phillip: “shedding tears . . . kissed him as he came down from his horse, and said, O my son, look thee out a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee.”10 As a cavalry general, Alexander had more than one war horse. Bucephalus was but one of his chargers; however, it was his favorite and brought him good fortune. “So long as [Alexander] was engaged in drawing up his men, or riding about to give orders or review them, he spared Bucephalus, who was now growing old . . . but when he was actually to fight, he sent for him again.”11 The horse inspired the army. From the phalanx to the cavalry, it was easily recognized on the battlefield: “There is something about this horse that strikes a responsive chord in even the most jaded viewer.”12 The spirited black charger (although an ancient fresco portrayed him as a bay) proved itself in a\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\n15\n\nscore of battles and was wounded in several. His larger than life status evoked spectacular myth. Bucephalus was depicted as anthropophagous—a man-eater, a combatant that ripped foes and tore into their flesh. After carrying Alexander through his victories at Issus, Granicus, and the greatest of them all, Gaugamela, Bucephalus’ luck ran out at Battle of the River Hydaspes, 326 b.c., where he succumbed to his battle wounds. Plutarch says Bucephalus was “thirty years old”13 when he died—rather old for a warhorse. Alexander mourned him as he would his bravest captain, ordering a state funeral and personally leading the procession. A new city, Bucephala, was founded in his warhorse’s honor. It survives as the Pakistani river city of Jhelum, where the Military College Jhelum is based. Alexander’s Cavalry Battles—Gaugamela, the Classic Frontal Read over and over again the campaigns of Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus, Turenne, Eugene and Frederic. . . . This is the only way to become a great general and master the secrets of the art of war. —Napoleon Bonaparte, Military Maxims\n\nGaugamela (also known as Arbela, 331 b.c.) is taught by staff colleges as the first of the three great maneuvers in warfare—the frontal attack. It featured a decisive assault at a central point, followed by penetration and the envelopment of one wing. Its most effective result was the direct paralysis and elimination of the Persian army command. Although Alexander’s army was outnumbered, his heavy infantry was superior to Darius’ infantry, despite the presence of Greek mercenaries and Persian royal bodyguards known as the Immortals. Darius enjoyed a distinct advantage with masses of cavalry, chariots, elephants, and foot consisting of at least 250,000, perhaps as many as 600,000, against 50,000 Greeks who arrived with only 7,000 horse and 40,000 infantry. The Macedonian heavy cavalry, Alexander’s bodyguard Companions (the Hetairoi), numbered about 1,700 men in eight cavalry regiments called hipparchies. During the Persian campaign, the entire Greek cavalry was organized into five regiments, each hipparchy with an attached squadron of Companions. Alexander’s immediate consort was a squadron of 300 selected Companions. Horse furniture comprised a bridle and shabraque (horse blanket); combat was given without saddles and, more importantly, without stirrups. Heavy cavalry was armed with long heavy spears, round shields, cuirasses of metal and leather, and helmets. The Greeks’ longer spears gave them considerable advantage over the Persian cavalry who were equipped with short stabbing javelins.14 The emperor Darius could not manage his army and dabbed at the Greeks with uncoordinated piecemeal attacks. Alexander responded with maneuver.\n\n16\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nHe marched his army obliquely across the Persian front and unnerved Darius who began to lose tactical control. Maneuver should not have troubled the Persians as they fielded enough men to swamp the Greek force, but they seemed mesmerized by Alexander, the essence of dynamic leadership. He was called Eskandar in Persian—a synonym for “expert.” Alexander cast himself as the avenging angel, resplendent in shimmering armor. One painting has him wearing a golden helmet made to look like the leering face of a god—he was an overwhelming spectacle. Catching sight of Darius’ chariot just beyond a slight gap in the front line, he charged. As the Companions cut toward the Persian emperor, command was lost. Darius became petrified, fixated with the approaching storm as Alexander clearly had one goal, to kill him: “The lances of Alexander’s cavalry and the pikes of the phalanx now pressed nearer and nearer to him. His charioteer was struck down by a javelin at his side; and at last Darius’ nerved failed him.”15 Darius fled. His abandoned army, leaderless and broken in spirit, collapsed. It would be unfair to characterize Gaugamela as a cavalry victory. The steadiness of the phalanx offered Alexander a base of attack as well as a safe haven; however, this action emphasized the effectiveness of the dynamic offensive. Shock action was limited; without stirrups, the classical warhorse did not produce the jolt of medieval cavalry, but Alexander smartly made up the difference with flamboyant leadership and a sudden thrust at the point of greatest decision. The mounted attack created enough psychological shock to develop exploitable momentum. Equally important was Alexander’s good fortune. His victories were hard fought, he constantly risked death and often emerged with heavy wounds—the penultimate captain of cavalry. It may be argued that cavalry victories began with Alexander, even though Greek warfighting centered on the heavy infantry. Alexander’s mounted successes took classical warfare beyond the hoplite, elevating cavalry to an arm of decision. His personal élan secured victory, with a brief nod to the other half of the symbiotic partnership, his warhorse. Horses, Infantry, and the Odd Elephant: Hannibal versus Rome Despite Alexander’s use of elite cavalry, heavy infantry continued to dominate ancient wars. The Roman legion treated its cavalry as auxiliaries and was content with hiring conquered tribes to fill in. The advent of Hannibal briefly changed this attitude. Phoenician cavalry (a mix of African and Spanish levies) was superior to the Roman horse in quality, though not in breeding or size. The Latin warhorse was sturdy: “His neck is carried erect; his head is small; his belly short; his back broad. Brawny muscles swell upon his noble chest. A bright bay or a good grey is the best colour; the worst is white or dun.”16\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\n17\n\nRoman mounts were trained for close combat and, like all spirited chargers, sensed battle and were drawn toward it: “If afar the clash of arms be heard, he knows not how to stand still; his ears prick up, his limbs quiver; and snorting, he rolls the collected fire under his nostrils.”17 The introduction of war elephants created a temporary tactical advantage centered on shock and momentum. The exotic smell also terrified European horses. Hannibal’s elephants were few and, like tanks in the early twentieth century, relatively delicate. The journey from Africa to Spain, through Southern France, across to snow covered passes of the Alps and finally the northern valleys of Italy eroded their numbers. It is a tribute to the veterinary skills of the Carthaginian army that any elephants arrived at all. The first major action fought between the Roman Republic and the Carthaginian invader was the Battle of Trebia in December of 218 b.c. It was the tactical precursor to Cannae and a good example of lessons learned turning against the student. It introduced the war elephant to the Romans and demonstrated the superiority of the Carthaginian cavalry. Carthaginian elephants and cavalry drove into the Roman front and blitzed the Roman horse away from the flanks of the attacking army. The Gauls, terrified by the war elephants, broke first. The trapped Romans kept their cool and fought with determination, actually breaking through the Carthaginian center. This brief success was soon savaged from three sides as Hannibal’s disciplined cavalry returned and the remaining elephants trampled through the cohorts. Trebia alarmed the Senate, which promptly raised four new legions and commanded the army to drive Hannibal out of Italy. This did not occur. The better led and faster marching Carthaginians completely out maneuvered the Romans and looted the rich countryside. Finally, Hannibal lured the Romans to Lake Trasimine (217 b.c.) where he sprang a devastating ambush. When the Romans restored the army, their generals would lead it into the worst defeat in the empire’s history. Cannae—The Classic Model Every ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate the classic example of Cannae. —Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nThe battle of Cannae (216 b.c.), the second great maneuver of military studies, remains the magnum opus for modern general staffs. Although cybernetic technology has just about taken surprise out of operational maneuver, Cannae continues to be studied at staff colleges as the pas de cheval of tactical ballet. The lesson the Romans chose to learn from Trebia was that disciplined Roman heavy infantry, using its ripping assault, could tear the heart out of any formation. The Senate’s new commander, Gaius Terentius Varro, was\n\n18\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\ndetermined to repeat the frontal attack. The maneuver problem, which featured superior Carthaginian cavalry and the threat of turned flanks, was given secondary concern. The Romans fielded 70,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry; Hannibal managed less than 50,000 infantry, 40,000 of which were armored, but all his elephants were dead. However, he could deploy 8,000 cavalry, and they were to be the dramatic key to the battle of annihilation. Varro, recalling Hannibal at Trebia and Trasimine, selected open ground where everything was in the shop window. The plain favored cavalry operations but initial betting favored Varro. Roman legionnaires were a homogeneous lot, whereas Carthaginian forces varied. Hannibal placed his best infantry on the wings while his cavalry covered the flanks. As Varro began his advance to contact, the Carthaginian cavalry attacked the Roman cavalry and drove it off the field. The Carthaginians followed in hot pursuit. Herein lay the key to cavalry operations: discipline and control. According to Denison, “[Carthaginian] cavalry must have attained a very high degree of discipline, or they could never after a victorious charge have been kept so well in hand and recalled so readily.”18 Hannibal deployed by offering his front—his army deployed as a bulge, inviting, daring a Roman attack. The cohorts promptly and systematically hacked through the center formations until the concave bulge had developed into a convex protrusion like a balloon stretched, about to burst. Hannibal permitted his infantry to fall back, thus drawing Varro’s cohorts into a center mass, anticipating an imminent collapse. As the Romans crowded into the salient, Hannibal sprang loose the heavy infantry on his right and left; like two swinging doors they drove into Varro’s flanks. This was the classic double envelopment, the vaunted pincer movement. The Romans began to appreciate the looming disaster when Carthaginian cavalry returned and delivered a demoralizing attack against the Roman army’s rear, cutting them down mercilessly. The army became a panicking mass. Roman historians recorded as many as 60,000 dead, including consuls, tribunes, and senators. The status of Cannae as the perfect battle has been lauded by modern strategists: A battle of annihilation can be carried out today according to the same plan devised by Hannibal in long forgotten times. The enemy front is not the goal of the principal attack . . . The annihilation is completed through an attack against the enemy’s rear . . . To bring about a decisive and annihilating victory requires an attack against the front and against one or both flanks.19\n\nCannae’s fame rests on its result—total annihilation. According to Will Durant, “it was a supreme example of generalship, never bettered in history . . . and [it] set the lines of military tactics for 2,000 years.”20 This invites debate and discussion regarding ancient command and control as well as battlefield\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\n19\n\nmaneuver. Cannae was a fortunate result, made possible via shrewd deployment by a general who knew his army and owned an effective cavalry that arrived at the right moment to instigate chaos. Hannibal met his end in North Africa. The battle of Zama (October, 202 b.c.) concluded the Punic Wars and destroyed Carthage. The contest featured the Roman army at its best and the Carthaginian at its worst. Few veterans of Trebia or Cannae remained, and the hastily assembled force did not boast the superb cavalry that had so effectively contributed to Roman disasters. Like Alexander facing Darius’ chariots, Scipio ordered open lanes, in effect, killing zones, to tempt the 80 war elephants. Hannibal’s “tanks” cooperated and ignored the Roman formations; rather than trampling through the maniples, they ambled past them, taking savage attack to their exposed flanks and rear from thrown pilums (javelins). Scipio’s defeated Carthaginian horses then regrouped to deliver a coup de grace attack upon Hannibal’s rear. The Carthaginian army and the once great empire collapsed.\n\n20\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nThe Roman legions went on to conquer the Mediterranean world. The civil war that followed Julius Caesar’s assassination (44 b.c.) ended with a division of the empire amongst the members of the Triumvirate. One of its more greedy members, Marcus Licinius Crassus, was drawn into a campaign that shocked the empire into an appreciation of light cavalry: the eastern horse archer. The Parting Shot and the Golden Cocktail The Battle of Carrhae (53 b.c.) is the first recorded example of a defeat of heavy infantry by horse archers. The Parthians (remnants of the Persian Empire, modern Iraq) decisively vanquished Rome’s legions, pitting an all-cavalry field force of 9,000 mounted archers supported by 100 cataphract cavalry against that most ubiquitous military tool box, the legion. The Roman army was impressively larger and comprised about five legions (28,000 foot) but failed to match the Parthian mounted arm deploying only 400 cavalry, mostly mercenary. Crassus confronted the Parthian general Surena on the arid plain just north of the Syrian border near present day Harran, Turkey. An ambitious military amateur, Crassus refused professional advice, maneuvered away from the Euphrates River, and allowed himself to be drawn into the desert in pursuit of Parthian plunder. The outnumbered Parthians played their one trump card of mobility. Their horse-based army permitted strategic gambit. Parthian King Orodes II divided his force into two parts; he sent his infantry into Armenia to punish Crassus’ only effective ally, while his cavalry force was dispatched to torment, then destroy, the invading Romans. The Parthian cavalry comprised two elements: cataphract horse (armored warriors, capable of blunting any attack by Roman cavalry) and horse artillery (missile-launching regiments of horse archers armed with the composite bow, which was allegedly able to pierce through two men at once). The horse archers practiced every form of maneuver warfare, but their most effective tactic was the feigned retreat. Forces drawn into the pursuit were subjected to the so-called Parthian shot—archers turning and delivering well-aimed volleys of arrows into the chasing force. Stirrups were not used, but an early form of loop stirrups (cord or rings for the big toe) appeared in the Middle East circa a.d. 1. The Parthians depended on strong thighs and splendid balance to deliver fire. The archers tormented the enemy with a rain of arrows, and then, if attacked by heavy cavalry, pretended to rout, encouraging reckless pursuit. The tactic survives in the English lexicon to this day, as the “parting shot” or last jibe in spirited debate. The horse archers required considerable arrows, which were provided via the camel trains. After a battle, the Parthians generally were left holding the open ground, and spent arrows were retrieved. The attack by fire was accomplished by a Parthian circle. Tactical groups, the drafshi (about 1,000 horse archers) or the washt (a squadron equivalent\n\nThe Classical Horse\n\n21\n\nto about 300 horse archers), approached to give stand-off fire and then trotted in a lazy ring. As the archers reached the arc closest to the enemy, they let loose with a deadly barrage and then fitted new arrows at leisure as they moved with the circle. Both the arrow circle and Parthian shot were an “attack by fire.” The only defense was lots of cavalry, archers, or a seeding of caltrops (“star nail” or makibishi: four or more iron spikes forged together) to impede cavalry advance. Scattered before an advancing force, the caltrops pierced the soft hooves of horses and camels or elephants and barefooted infantry. The greatest advantage of the horse archer was eliminating the need to close with the target and expose the horse to either weapon fire or ambushing ground spikes. It had worked in previous battles: “The Legion strewed the field of battle with caltrops, and the horses that drew the chariots, running full speed on them, were infallibly destroyed.”21 Not this time. The battle was a gradual slaughter in the blazing sun. The legionnaires suffered the storm and attempted a missile defense via the testudo, or “tortoise,” wherein legionnaires hoisted shields over their heads to form an overlapping armored roof against arrows or slingers’ shots. The Parthians gave direct fire against the exposed torsos; the testudo also invited probing charges from spear-equipped cataphract cavalry. Plutarch recorded “When [Crassus’ son] exhorted them to charge the armoured horsemen, [the Legionnaires] showed him that their hands were riveted to their shields and their feet nailed through to the ground, that they were helpless to either flee or fight in self-defence.”22 The combination of thirst, heat, and constant attack eventually made the Roman infantry incapable of effective defense, and the Parthians turned the battle into dusty target practice. Crassus’ army broke. The greater part was hunted down or captured in one of the most complete defeats in Roman history, second only to Cannae. Crassus was captured and brought before Surena. He was a multimillionaire better suited to politics and the grain market than war command. Surena contemptuously reminded his prisoner that it was his greed for pillage that led him to invade and pronounced a sentence he considered apt for an avaricious affluent foe: molten gold was poured down Crassus’ throat. One legacy of the battle was the introduction of silk into the Roman Empire. Campaign survivors described seeing luminous, iridescent standards; this allegedly led to the Silk Road and initial trade with China. The greater military effect was the realization that heavy infantry could not defeat a balanced cavalry army in open terrain.\n\nChapter 3 The West in Decline: Mongol Cavalry\n\nThe nation of Huns surpasses all other Barbarians in wildness of life. And though the Huns do just bear the likeness of men (of a very ugly pattern), they are so little advanced in civilization that they make no use of fire, nor any kind of relish, in the preparation of their food, but feed upon the roots which they find in the fields, and the half raw flesh of any sort of animal. —Ammianus Marcellinus, History of Rome1\n\nThe Roman Empire’s decline was hastened by barbarian invasions; the cavalry army of the Hun Empire was particularly devastating. The Huns swept through the Roman Empire isolating Constantinople and penetrating as far west as France before being defeated at the Battle of Châlons. They were a nomadic confederation of Eurasian tribes seemingly devoted only to war. They had no system of writing, no capital; their world was the horse, and their patria the saddle. Initially the Huns had no monarchs, but by the middle of the fourth century, they were led by an emperor. The western borders of their empire were formed by the Rhine and Danube rivers, including present-day Germany, Hungary, Russia, Romania, Poland, and Ukraine. The Huns’ ability to conduct hit-and-run raids was coupled with their skill in establishing a feudal stranglehold over conquered lands, ensuring compliance through terror and vengeance. The Huns are synonymous with what may be described in modern terms as strategic operational maneuver. Their equestrian army was in a constant state of operational readiness and capable of both maneuver and shock. Hunnish 22\n\nThe West in Decline\n\n23\n\nhorses were particularly suited to the rigors of a campaign, exhibiting extraordinary endurance for work and resistance to cold and hunger. The Huns likely used the toe-ring stirrup, but early versions of the traditional model may have been introduced. Their bow was a devastating technological advancement made from horn, sinew, and wood. The reflex composite bow was particularly suited to cavalry in that it was smaller than the longbow, was powerful, had a better range, and was easy to use on horseback. The Huns engaged their foes directly in a reasonably accurate barrage, often before their opposite numbers had loosed their first volley. The reputation of Hun archers prompted false bravado: “We fear neither the Huns nor their hornbows.”2 Hun cavalry, like the Mongols 800 years later, did not use horseshoes. Protection for horses’ feet was known to the early Romans but not in general use: “Mules and beasts of burden were sometimes provided with a metal or wooden shoe (called a solea), which was held in its place by thongs of leather crossed over the hoof. This however seems to have been the exception rather than the rule.”3 Roman cavalry may have been shod, but terrain was the deciding feature. Traditional nailed-on shoes were used during Celtic occupation, but the strapped-on hippo sandal, or detachable horseshoe, was common. Detachable shoes made attack at the gallop extremely difficult, if not impossible. Nailed shoes were common by the sixth century but required forges and smiths. Large cavalries trusted to the sturdiness of their horses’ feet and good veterinary care. It appeared as if the Huns fought in no fixed order or set doctrine; in fact, the simple sophistication of an all-cavalry force required both discipline as well as central command. The sudden appearance of cavalry on flanks or the reappearance of a force believed to have been broken and dispersed belied the experienced technique of a professional cavalry force. Barbarians by definition only, Attila’s horde conducted deep battle and maneuver warfare with the grace and agility of a drilled corps de ballet. The ability of their vanguard to spread terror, yet deny information, permitted sudden unexpected attacks. Speed added to their terror. Their startling arrival and merciless slaughter swept Europe like a mass of hungry locusts. The sighting of even small reconnaissance bands created panic—the Huns seemed to be everywhere, at once. A cavalry army is impossible to entrap unless it is confronted with an equally skilled force of light horse. It was clear that the Huns’ army depended on silage, but short of laying waste to every meadow in Western Europe, it was impossible to deny them rations or cut their supply lines as there were no lines of supply. A cavalry army must travel reasonably dispersed to permit forage and efficient pillage; it must also be able to concentrate quickly for selected attack. Operational maneuver in an age where only the crudest maps existed and information was passed verbally, was practically impossible without a highly developed system of reconnaissance and command and control. While\n\n24\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\ntactical maneuver demands esprit and almost reckless bravado, in-the-saddle decisions demand a good eye and dynamic leadership. The Huns employed aggressive screens to fix the main body and then smack them in the flank or rear. Their approach marches were difficult to determine, particularly since, in juxtaposition to the forces they faced, the Hun hordes could turn on a dime. Their assault featured fire and maneuver before melee: The oriental never has used the cohesive shock of lines of horsemen. He gallops at his foe in loose unaligned masses and from his first appearance in history, is spoken of as circling. He uses a horizontal cut to increase the drawing effect of his weapon and takes his time to kill his man, continually circling him until he sees an opening and trusting to the agility of his horse for his parries.4\n\nThe apparent rustic simplicity of Hun cavalry masked the complex dexterous machine that made war with terrible efficiency. Attila versus Rome Rome initially managed to check Asiatic probes by hiring Goths to reinforce the legions. The Huns’ recurring peripheral raiding became serious with the appearance of a new leader in the western confederacy—the great cavalry captain, Attila. Attila’s effect on the greater European psyche was second only to that of Adolf Hitler; his horrifying successes and demonic aura created continental anxiety and a psychological necessity for his elimination. To the rural peasant or town burgher, he was the devil incarnate. However, for a barbarian, he was reasonably sophisticated. Indeed, he could have passed for a patrician. Attila the Hun was more of a returning tourist. He had been educated in Rome where he was held as a political hostage since the age of 12 and raised in the court of Emperor Honorius. The Roman diplomat Priscus, who met Attila, described him as “a short, squat man with a large head, deep-set eyes, flat nose, and a thin beard.”5 He was comfortable in the customs and peccadilloes of Roman society and had grown accustomed to the opulence and decadence of the eternal city. Attila had been made to attend ambassadorial conferences and been schooled in protocol and bureaucratic procedure; had he not become a captain of apocalyptic cavalry, he could have easily succeeded as a high placed official in the Roman or Byzantine courts. Although inheriting a taste for the empire’s luxuries, he left with contempt for its culture. After 14 years of Roman finishing school, Attila returned to the East. In a.d. 432 King Ruga, who had united the Hun tribes, died in his capital in present-day Hungary. Royal succession was bestowed to his nephews Bleda and Attila. The ceremony was conducted in a manner befitting an empire based on the warhorse. Attila and Bleda met with the representatives of the Hun impe-\n\nThe West in Decline\n\n25\n\nrial diet, all of whom were seated on horseback. They were given sectors of the empire and immediately set about securing and expanding their personal domains. Attila reappeared on the Roman borders in a.d. 440 and, after harassing commerce, crossed the Danube in a formal test of the empire’s defenses. It was not a daunting task. When he assumed control, he inherited the perfect force with which to challenge an empire groaning under bureaucratic corruption and an unchanged conservative operational art. Attila’s field force flooded past the crumbling levees of Danube forts. Every Balkan city fell before the army, which behaved with particular cruelty to any opposition, slaughtering entire tribes but ensuring that a few survivors were set free to spread news of the coming terror. Before long, Attila was called “the Scourge of God.” His offensive stopped at Constantinople because the Huns did not have the engineers to conduct a grand siege and because they were offered tribute by the emperor. The arranged peace and bribe simply whetted Attila’s appetite. In a.d. 445, after Bleda mysteriously died (rumored to have been killed by Attila himself), Attila took the throne as undisputed lord of the Huns. He again turned his attention toward the empire, returning to his western seat on the Danube and hovering menacingly over the peripheries of Roman control. In a.d. 447 Attila invaded; his cavalry overwhelmed Roman and Gothic coalitions and again threatened Constantinople. During the negotiated armistice, the Roman emissary observed Attila during a banquet in his tented cavalry encampment: A luxurious meal, served on silver plate, had been made ready for us and the barbarian guests, but Attila ate nothing but meat on a wooden trencher. In everything else, too, he showed himself temperate; his cup was of wood. . . The sword he carried at his side, the latchets of his Scythian shoes, the bridle of his horse were not adorned, like those of the other Scythians, with gold or gems or anything costly.6\n\nA neurotic cavalier, Attila once remained seated on his horse during an entire fête. The Huns did not take well to peaceful coexistence. One of the drawbacks of having a dynamic force of cavalry is that the horses, warriors, and their captains are high strung, easily grow restless, and function best when they are on campaign. Attila could not simply administer a fighting horde in grassy retirement. He soon received a serendipitous rationale for going to war again. Châlons: A Cavalry Battle Quadrupedumque putrem cursu quatit ungula campum. [And the hoof of the horses shakes the crumbling field as they run.] —Virgil, The Aeneid (XI, 875)\n\n26\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nThe Battle of Châlons featured a Roman coalition led by General Flavius Aëtius, the empire’s designated supreme allied commander. Aëtius commanded a European force that included the Visigoth king, Theodoric. Their alliance confronted the operational might of Attila’s equestrian horde, ostensibly bent on restoring honor, but mostly after plunder. The battle was sort of a Helen of Troy affair kindled by Princess Honoria, the disgraced sister of the Western Roman Emperor Valentinian. She had conducted a scandalous affair with her chamberlain and had been implicated in a plot to overthrow her brother. Her lover was executed, and Honoria, allegedly pregnant, was exiled to a secluded convent. She smuggled out a letter to Attila, seeking to make him her champion; the letter included a ring, as a sign of trust. Attila chose to interpret this as a proposal of marriage and immediately demanded from Valentinian a fitting dowry of half the empire. When the emperor refused, the cunning Attila professed immeasurable anguish from the imperial insult and invaded Western Europe. Was Honoria the face that launched 30,000 warhorses? Unfortunately, no pictorial record remains. The Hun horse archers crossed the Rhine early in a.d. 451 and penetrated into Gaul, capturing a dozen important centers including Paris. But as Orléans was besieged, Attila was confronted by the grand alliance. Patricius (supreme military commander) Aëtius led a coalition of Visigoths, Alans, and Burgundians: “The Visigoths, who at that time were in the mature vigor of their fame and power, obeyed with alacrity the signal of war, prepared their arms and horses, and assembled under the standard of their aged king.”7 A mirror to Attila, Aëtius, as a child, had lived as hostage among the Huns in exchange for Attila. The two had met before Attila departed for Italy and may have been friends. The Hun army numbered about 30,000, while the allied field force was nearly 50,000. The mass of Gallic tribes reinforcing the Romans was a surprise. Attila had not expected a dynamic response. The allied force was well balanced and fielded a vast amount of first rate cavalry. Attila’s operational raison d’être was movement, and he quickly abandoned Orléans. A series of sweeping maneuvers concluded with both forces meeting near Châlons-enChampagne. The battlefield was dominated by a ridge, and the battle was a seesaw struggle for control of that ground of tactical importance. Aëtius and Theodoric deployed first as Attila waited and watched, secure inside his wagon laager. Whether in accordance with Hun custom or being simply superstitious, the normally sophisticated Attila summoned a shaman to examine the entrails of his sacrifice to the gods. The omens were dark, foretelling a debacle, but divined that one of the Roman leaders would die in battle. Attila decided it was to be Aëtius and gave orders. He had delayed until the afternoon, allowing the enemy the advantage. When his reconnaissance re-\n\nThe West in Decline\n\n27\n\nported the Roman force deploying upon the high ground, he dispatched his first echelon of horse archers. They raced the French cavalry to secure the ground. With thunderous advance, each side established opposing flank positions and then fought for the center crest. The alliance cavalry was quicker and secured the ridge before the Huns. In the fierce struggle, both sides took heavy casualties. Aëtius attempted a double envelopment, hoping to roll up Attila’s flanks. King Theodoric, wounded in a running melee, was ridden over and trampled to death, proving the diviner’s forecast correct. His son, Thorismund, led the cataphract cavalry and counterattacked, retaking the key terrain. The Huns withdrew, confused and demoralized. Aëtius ordered the pursuit. Cataphract cavalry intercepted Attila’s own Guard cavalry and engaged them with such ferocity that Attila was forced to retreat to the safety of his camp. Faced with certain defeat, Attila ordered a cavalry funeral pyre (a mound of saddles) and determined to “cast himself into the flames, that none might have the joy of wounding him . . . [that he] might not fall into the hands of his foes.”8 Finally, realizing Aëtius had no intention of rushing his camp, Attila took a chance and conducted a breakout battle. The Huns did what they did best—maneuvering, dispersing, and regrouping elsewhere. It worked. The horse army managed to extricate themselves and retreat to the Danube. The Roman Empire was euphoric. The battle’s most important result was that it demonstrated the Huns’ vincibility. Gibbon identifies Châlons as “the last victory which was achieved in the name of the Western Roman Empire.”9 In hindsight, Châlons fame rested in that simply, Attila had been defeated for the first time. Aëtius’s conduct of the campaign drew deserved criticism, for he failed to follow up his victory and permitted Attila to escape. Attila licked his wounds and rebuilt his cavalry. The next year he returned. The Huns ravaged Italy, laying waste to Venetia, sacking Milan, and then descending on Rome. However, Attila spared the city, evidently moved by the brave piety exhibited by Pope Leo I who advanced barefoot in snow to beg the Hun emperor to show mercy for the eternal city. Other accounts suggest that the pope arrived at Ravenna with a flock of priests, and they negotiated on horseback. This time the Romans caved in. Ambassadors visited Attila’s camp and, amidst the intimidation of snorting horses and archers, offered ransom, including Princess Honoria. Interestingly enough, Attila declined. Honoria was abandoned, forced to marry a senator, and disappeared from history. Within a decade the empire collapsed, leaving the Huns to become a dim nightmare. This did not, however, end the Roman Empire’s attraction for Asiatic horsemen. The last great horsed invasion by equestrian barbarians occurred in the thirteenth century when Mongol riders (“the Devil’s Horsemen”) thundered into Western Europe.\n\n28\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nThe Perfect Weapons System—Nomadic Cavalry Armies of the Golden Horde The Mongols are by nature good at riding and shooting—they took possession of the world through the advantage of bow and horse. —Chinese maxim The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them bathed in tears, to ride their horses and clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters. —Genghis Khan10\n\nEight hundred years after Attila, Asian cavalry again appeared in the west as a mounted horde led by Genghis Khan. The conquest of Europe by a cavalry army composed of nomadic Mongolians retarded the development of Russian and Ukrainian states. It also shook up the remaining part of the old Roman Empire—the Byzantine realms of Constantinople. The term Golden Horde (Russian, Zolotaya Orda—“Golden Rule” or “Government”) refers to political divisions of the Mongol Empire (The Golden Horde, The Blue Horde, etc.). The Asiatic method of describing cardinal directions: blue (east), red (south), white (west), and yellow or gold (north) may have also accounted for the naming of hordes. The nomadic Mongols comprised a moving flood, a sea of horses that like an irresistible tsunami, swamped empires, washing away opposing armies in a torrent of hoofs and arrows. They are further described in a passage from The Golden Horde: “A numberless multitude swept across the hill crests and like waves of a black ocean did they sweep down upon us. Their arrows fell like clouds of biting flies from the darkened sky. The death screams of our warriors were o’erwhelmed by the drumming of infinite hooves so that only the endless thunder was heard at the last.”11 The Great Khan poured out of the eastern Siberian plains onto the steppes of the Ukraine and in short order sacked all the major commercial centers of Eastern Europe and the Greek Christian cities of Byzantium along the Black Sea. The Mongol cavalry, numbering more than 200,000 light horse archers, fought battles against heavy European cavalry, often outnumbered. Their defeat of Teutonic Knights and powerful Polish cataphracts brought them to the gates of Vienna. The Devil’s Horsemen slaughtered over 80 percent of the Slavs in their initial invasions. The Kyiv Empire never recovered but continued a loosely organized rebellion led by their own indigenous steppe cavalry—the Cossacks. The steppes of the Ukraine became a struggle between Christian Cossacks and the seigneurs of the Golden Horde, the Tartars. The Cossacks pronounced it Tatar [tah tarr], the term said to reflect the initial terror all cavalry bestows, the pounding rhythm of advancing hooves: tatar, tatar, tatar.\n\nThe West in Decline\n\n29\n\nSubsequent Mongol campaigns invaded the Middle East, defeating the great Caliph and capturing Baghdad. Parthian and Scythian tactics were chaff before the whirlwind that was the Mongol mounted assault. About the only thing that thwarted the Mongol cavalry was geography. The rock-strewn terrain of Syria initially hindered the Mongols who did not use horseshoes. When the Mongols reached Egypt the Mamluks burned their pastures, delaying the inevitable. The Mongol tide was stopped by an imperial death and a resulting civil war. Genghis Khan’s death in 1227 (appropriately, he fell off his horse) did not remove the Mongol presence from Eastern Europe, but it did introduce a new foreign policy. Subsequent Mongol rulers were far more interested in China than the backward barbaric Christians or Arabs that comprised the west. Nomadic by temperament, the Mongols concentrated on sacking, devastation, and massacre. They were content with tribute and a general indifference to local religions. Nonetheless, they eventually established an efficient feudal state administered with some skill. The Mongol cavalry was often at least as barbaric as those they conquered and had no difficulty terrorizing their more sophisticated opponents. Despite their cruelty and no-quarter philosophy, the Mongols apparently did not seek to torture or mutilate their enemies: “The Mongols did not partake in the gruesome displays that European rulers often resorted to elicit fear and discourage potential enemies—none of the stretching, emasculating, belly cutting and hacking to pieces . . . The Mongols merely slaughtered, preferring to do so at a distance.”12 Conversely, Mongols unlucky enough to be captured in battle could count on humiliation and the most excruciating death, all for the amusement of their Christian or Islamic captors. The Mongols are credited with introducing examples of stirrups, which was an advantage in mounted battle, as valuable a tech improvement as steel versus bronze. The stirrup offered stability and permitted the archer to stand in the saddle while shooting—even at the gallop. The stirrup’s origin is, however, debated. The Sarmatians or Scythians are credited with working stirrups in the first century. They settled along what is Ukraine and Caspian Russia and evolved into various Cossack tribes. Sarmatian heavy cavalry used a long heavy lance and wore armor: “[they] were probably the first troops to charge bodies of infantry in the accepted cavalry fashion.”13 The standard stirrup was probably Asian, perhaps perfected by the nomadic Turkil tribes bordering China.14 The victory of Gothic cavalry over Byzantine legions at Adrianople in a.d. 378 is sometimes credited to the use of the stirrup. The Mongol armies likely used both the early loop stirrup (toe loops at the end of a strong cord) as well as wood and metal combinations attached to leather straps fastened to a saddle. The stirrup was finally introduced to Europe around the eighth century and, coupled with the storm of horse archers, inaugurated an era of cavalry dominance. Horse armies, Mongolian archers, and heavy cataphract formations dominated warfare into the medieval period.\n\n30\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nEuropeans were shocked at the power, range, and penetration of the Asiatic composite bow. It was easily the equal of the Welsh longbow. The composite reflex bow originated on the Asian steppes. Unstrung, it looked like an inverted art deco C; when forced back and made taut, it became a bow much more familiar to modern westerners than a longbow—it was the embodiment of the stylized Cupid’s bow. The enormous tension and energy created from bending the bow inside out created a weapon of formidable range and penetration. The bow was a combination of select wood strips sandwiched between elastic sinew and horn bone bonded, then laminated, with fish glue, which imparted strength yet resilience and protection from moisture. Bowstrings were made from horsehide, which was supple in very cold weather.15 Bows were custom made; construction including fitting and compressing, curing and drying and took at least a year, making acquisition of a Mongol bow equivalent to purchasing a good car. The bow’s dynamic power catapulted arrows about a football-field length beyond that of the longbow: 350 yards versus 250 yards average distance. Skilled archers exceeded this; Mongol cavalry delivered punishing barrages from at least 200 paces and began to penetrate armor at 100 yards.16 Horse archers shot using the Mongolian release, “a special ring on which the string is hooked before release. This thumb ring . . . is typically made from Chinese jade or agate, but leather, metal and bone is also known to have been used.”17 Mongolian cavalry included women. Chinese and Persian chronicles note women were part of the cavalry army and were trained for military campaigns: “[Chingis Khan] ordered women accompanying the troops to do the work and perform the duties of the men, while the latter were absent fighting.”18 Marco Polo tells of Kublai Khan’s nephew and rival Kaidu’s daughter Aigiarn (“Shining Moon”) who was famous for her “unparalleled feminine beauty as well as her immense strength of body . . . so strong that she surpassed every male Mongol warrior in physical strength and skill. Consequently, she accompanied her father on his campaigns and took great pleasure in the thrills of fighting.”19 The Mongol warriors wore rough campaign dress but preferred Chinese silk shirts. Silk was a tough fiber and used as part of a cuirasse. Latin arrows shot from a great distance did not easily penetrate, and if an arrow pierced flesh, the silk generally held so that the arrow could be drawn out by twisting then pulling, thus preventing poison from entering the bloodstream. Mongol body armor comprised a composite wood, leather, and silk, treated with resilient fish glue lacquer. The result was impervious to most arrows, swords, and knives and was comfortable on the march. Mongol warriors also wore metal and leather helms: “Each rider had a sharpening stone for keeping the metal arms in top shape. Since self-sufficiency was the order of the day, in addition to the indispensable knife, an awl, needle and thread were carried by each rider,\n\nThe West in Decline\n\n31\n\nto enable quick and effective repair of almost any type of equipment in the field.”20 The Mongol army was a superlative Glubokii boi (“deep battle”) force. The advantage of being able to cross any terrain in the most adverse weather with no baggage gave the Mongols incredible advantage and defined the concept of maneuver warfare. Offensive maneuver featured extensive recce and advance along a central axis by the main body in a loose crescent formation much like a Zulu impi. The core of the crescent threatened the enemy while each “horn” attempted to flank or encircle. If the enemy answered with creative maneuver, the Mongols adopted a feigned retreat known as the mangudai. Mongol doctrine emulated the Parthian and Hun tactics of maneuver and shooting on the move. This included tactical ruses and contrived retreats, for staged routs induced the foolhardy into pursuit. The aristocracy of Europe and the Middle East was only too keen to test their mettle against light cavalry but invariably discovered tactical reality within a cunning killing zone. After volley fire, the horde closed on a disorganized foe to deliver a withering penetrating fire at less than 100 yards. Each horse archer carried two types of arrows: crippling barbed ends or small-tipped armor-piercing tips. Adventurer Giovanni da Pian del Carpine recorded, “Everyone must have at least these weapons: two or three bows or at least one good one, and three large quivers filled with arrows, a battle-axe, and ropes for dragging machines. . . The length of their arrows is two feet . . . the heads of the arrows are very sharp and cut on both sides like a two-edged sword.”21 Arrow assault was followed by a devastating melee. Closequarter fighting featured aggressive horses and awesome hardware. The two preferred melee weapons were the Zhanmadao or “horse chopping sword” (developed in China) and the Mongol saber, a heavy slashing weapon that could cut deeply into the muscles of man or mount. The horse archer carried his saber wrapped in a rough fur scabbard, next to his quiver and tied to his wrist to prevent loss in close-quarter action where swords were either knocked out of grasp or stuck in the flesh of the enemy and had to be yanked out. Genghis Khan imposed force unity by breaking up ethnic or tribal affilia­ tions and mixing his troops into teamlike subunits. The Mongols were intuitively metric, and their army was organized in multiples of 10: initial family-like groupings of 10 archers, troops, then 100 warrior squadrons (jaghun), 1,000 strong regiments (mingghun), and 10,000 man brigades (tjumen). Transfers between units were not permitted, and discipline was ruthless and uncompromising. Essentially a nomadic nation on horseback, the Khan’s cavalry was used to harsh winters and long-distance travel. They also excelled at sieges and mass river crossings, and the Danube, Prut, Dnieper, or Volga proved no obstacle. The Khan was practical enough to include Chinese and Arab engineers in his specialist formations. While the Chinese invented gunpowder, and the Mongols introduced it to the Middle East,\n\n32\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nit was the Arabs who refined the chemical compounds to create a stable and effective explosive that could service siege artillery and, eventually, firelocks. Mongol engineers astonished Christian and Islamic cities with sophisticated assault incorporating modern siege engines to destroy fortifications and conquer walls. Their greatest weapon was terror. The psychological effect of an approaching Mongol horde was often enough to break an opposing army. They advertised their own barbarity by ensuring that select survivors were freed to spread the tales of the slaughter they had witnessed. The Mongol warhorse was half-wild, unshod yet sure footed, impervious to harsh climate and little fodder. It was a shooting platform, an attack vehicle as well as transport. On campaign the horse was a source of protection, warmth, and sustenance. Its milk was gathered for drink or turned into yogurt on the march. Poured into a bladder and tied to the saddle, the milk was churned into a sustaining beverage. In emergency, a starving rider made a small incision in the neck and drank his horse’s blood to give him enough energy to carry on. Crippled horses or battle casualties provided meat and rawhide. Bone marrow enriched the diet. The Khan’s mounts were allowed to go shaggy for warmth, and sported a variety of color. Dark brown or black were standard, although grey and Chagaan (white) were much prized. Mongol horses were hardy but diminutive (4 feet high at the withers) and resembled modern ponies. The best example is Prezwalski’s horse, a surviving species of Mongol horse discovered in Asia in 1879: “Their horses are fed upon grass alone and do not require barley or other grain. The men are habituated to remain on horseback during two days and two nights without dismounting; sleeping in that situation whilst their horses graze . . .”22 Mongol horse furniture included a bridle and stirrups secured to a leather and wood saddle kept snug with sheep’s fat. Mongolian horse blankets, actually horsehair pads, were particularly effective in that they did not “sweat” and gave protection to the horse’s back in the most foul climate. The Terlik, or Mongol horse pad, was made at the beginning of winter when the horses did not need long tails to swat away flies. Attached saddlebags carried hard rations, water, and yogurt pouches. The Mongols enjoyed Kumis, a drink made from fermenting mare’s milk in a horsehide pouch. The result was mildly alcoholic and could be further distilled into a serious spirit called Araka: “It leaves a taste of milk of almonds on the tongue, and it makes the inner man most joyful and also intoxicates weak heads, and greatly provokes urine.”23 The Mongols’ diet gave them operational superiority over their opponents who required grains and constant resupply from depots or well-organized forage collection. One legacy of the Mongol cavalry style may be steak tartare. Legend has it the scrupulous horsemen cut off a share of meat from any tough, stringy carcass available, whether beef, goat, or horse, and slapped it under their saddle: “They give it a kind of cooking by placing it between their own thighs and the backs\n\nThe West in Decline\n\n33\n\nof their horses.”24 After a day’s ride the meat was tenderized and made piquant with a natural vinaigrette made from the horse’s sweaty flanks. The final product made for a quick meal à la russe or briefly warmed over a fire. The modern version tastes better with chilled vodka or champagne. The traditional Achilles’ heel of a marching army, the “logistic tail,” did not exist. Horse milk and horse blood were staples of the Mongolian cavalry diet. Anything beyond what was carried on horseback was foraged and taken as plunder. Like members of a particularly savage Bushkazi team, each Mongol archer owned one extra horse—most averaged three to five spares. According to Marco Polo: “Their horses are so well broken in to quick changes of movement, that upon the signal given, they instantly turn in every direction.”25 The total dependence on their mounts led to Mongol shaman bestowing spiritual denotation and including horses in precampaign ritual. The horse was both a symbiotic comrade in battle and a sacrosanct artifact. Mare’s milk was scattered before battle, and in some cases, horses were sacrificed to ensure transportation to heaven. The cavalry invasions of Europe gave impetus to social, economic, and military reform on the continent. The evolution of trading leagues, technological change, or tactical doctrine ambled along with almost a casual pace. Change was gradual. The central problem was stable government and nothing as efficient as Roman rule emerged from the Dark Ages. Eventually, a political system, based on hereditary monarchial rule anchored on Catholic mysticism, produced demonstrable social and political change with an affected graciousness. This transformation was centered on the horse.\n\nChapter 4 The Medieval Cavalry\n\nThe history of the use of the horse in battle is divided into three periods: first, that of the charioteer; second, that of the mounted warrior who clings to his steed by pressure of the knees; and third, that of the rider equipped with stirrups. —Lynn White, Medieval Technology and Social Change I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse. —Attributed to Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, 1500–58\n\nThe Hundred Years’ War found the warhorse triumphant and the center of the operational art. By the time the last arrow hit the ground at Agincourt, it was a spent force relegated to the role of “supporting arm” in a martial world dominated by infantry and gunpowder. The conduct of the war on the medieval battlefield may appear less bizarre if certain aspects are considered: the knight’s equipment and heraldic advertisements, and, his drive train, the great feudal warhorse. The specifics of the mounted attack in time and space must be explained vis-à-vis the technical characteristics of what proved to be the warhorse’s greatest opposition—the longbow. Finally, a review of two battles that challenged the dominance of chivalry—Crécy and Agincourt—is appropriate to trace the warhorse in its devolution. The concept of chivalry or knighthood originated with the French. Chivalry and chevalier (cheval means horse) refers to mounted aristocracy within the feudal or medieval period. European feudalism extended from early references in the eighth century to a violent termination in France in the eighteenth 34\n\nThe Medieval Cavalry\n\n35\n\ncentury. Aspects of feudalism remained; seigneurialism was practiced in French Canada until the 1830s, and Czarist Russia was essentially an autocratic feudal society at the time of the revolution. Chivalry was based upon reciprocal obligations coupled with exaggerated class values that included the concept of courtly love and ideal knightly virtues. Its most durable and most romantic symbol is the knight and his warhorse—an aristocratic symbiotic relationship. The Catholic feudalism advocated an absolute system of faith and politics; thus it was only logical that its noblesse should adopt an absolute system of tactics. Cavalry served as a resplendent icon of fighting aristocracy as well as the acme of martial influence. Chivalry epitomized the trinity of maneuver warfare (armor, mobility, and shock) that would remain the goal of cavalry into the new millennium.\n\nThe Armored Cavalier No other Knight in all the land Could do the things that he could do. Not only did he understand The way to polish swords, but knew What remedy a Knight should seek Whose armour had begun to squeak. —A. A. Milne, The Knight Whose Armour Didn’t Squeak\n\nThe mounted knight, clinquant in steel and heraldry, dominated the field of battle, and his mere appearance reduced infantry to also-ran status. The distinctions between the two traversed social, economic, and martial strata. The warhorse and armor were simply unaffordable, as was the time required to produce a competent warrior. One cavalry officer compared it to running a Formula 1 racing team—“buying the beast, training, maintenance, and keeping the driver at peak condition.”1 A suit of armor retailed at between £8 and £16. A year at Oxford, with tuition, board, and clothes, cost £8 (a pound or livre was equivalent to a pound of pure silver). A good warhorse cost about £80, which was equivalent to a Ferrari. Unmatched in weapon craft, riding skill, or protection, the knight concentrated on combat with the only opposite worthy to challenge him—another knight. This social distinction, with its attendant mannerisms and styles, influenced the conduct of medieval warfare: A young knight from France, called sir Tristan de Roye, who was desirous of displaying his courage. . . . He sent a [herald] to the English army, requesting, that since peace had put an end to the combat, some one would have the kindness to tilt with him three courses with the lance before the city of Badajos. When this request was brought to the army, they consulted together, and said it ought not to be refused. A young English squire then stepped forth, called Miles Windsor,\n\n36\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nwho wished honourably to be created a knight, and said to the herald, “Friend, return to thy masters, and tell sir Tristan de Roye, that to-morrow he shall be delivered from his vow, by Miles Windsor, before the city of Badajos, according to his request.” On the morrow morning, Miles Windsor left the army of the earl of Cambridge, and went towards Badajos . . . well accompanied by friends . . . there were upwards of one hundred knights on the spot, where the tournament was to be performed. Sir Tristan de Roye was already there, accompanied by French and Bretons. When the combatants were completely armed, with lances in their rests, and mounted, they spurred their horses, and, lowering their spears, met each other with such force that their lances were twice broken against their breast-plates, but no other hurt ensued. They then took their third lance, and the shock was so great that the heads of Bordeaux steel pierced their shields, and through all their other armour even to the skin, but did not wound them: the spears were shattered, and the broken pieces flew over their helmets. This combat was much praised by all the knights of each side who were present. They then took leave of each other with much respect, and returned to their different quarters, for no other deeds of arms were performed.2\n\nFor professional warfighting, the feudal army required a main battle tank; this was, by mid-fourteenth century, a mounted knight in plate armor and the subject of apotheosis in song and chronicle. Style and color formed an important part of the knightly image. The martial art, and here is meant heraldry, was an eccentric combination of the effete and the macho. What was considered militarily in 1346 today borders on the laughable—a smorgasbord of decor and family tree devices. Tournament attire comprised a splash of colors and symbols, which included fantastic papier mâché or leather creations atop helmets, from lions to swans. Many knights’ helmets included a torse (a twisted cord or wreath) representing Christ’s crown of thorns—a fashion brought back by crusaders. Armor was polished or blackened steel since black armor collected less heat than shiny metal. The knight’s outfit was layered against the elements, searing sun or rusting rain. Combinations varied. Western knights used chain mail, leather (hardened in boiling wax as cuir bouille), scale, plate armor, or creative bricolage; full plate did not dominate until the end of the fourteenth century. The ensemble included the gambeson, a thick padded garment worn under mail. The main armor, in custom-fitted sections, was meticulously forged for comfort and flexibility. The complete suit included the helm, pauldrons (shoulder plates), gauntlets, gorget (a neck protector), breastplate or cuirasse, and greaves, the equivalent of shin guards. This was covered by a knee-length fabric chemise or surcote. The surcote was as important as armor. Adorned with the knight’s heraldic arms, it clearly identified him in a sea of faceless metal. This prevented friendly fire from archers or an errant bash from a comrade in the heat of\n\nThe Medieval Cavalry\n\n37\n\nmelee. Surcotes helped squires rescue their masters from a throng of mudspattered bodies or distinguished the bearer as someone worth sparing for ransom: The pathetically quixotic Duke of Brabant, whose loyal retinue had left him on his own for fear that by crowding around him in his captivity they would draw attention to his rank and riches. His captor had removed his helmet, but seeing nothing in his features, nor in the eccentric makeshift surcoat he was wearing over borrowed armour, to indicate the value of his prize, had decided he was not worth preserving and cut his throat.3\n\nOnce the ensemble was strapped on and adjusted, scratching an itch or quashing a biting flea became impossible. The old saw of a flea in the knight’s ear was all too true. Personal comfort, including toilet duty, was difficult, if not impossible. Genitalia were protected with a codpiece, the precursor to the modern athletic support. Made of metal or chain mail, affixed with leather straps to ensure a snug fit, the contraption made relieving oneself, scratching, or sudden passion an irritating challenge in or out of the saddle: “Already in a rage of lust, mad after a wife, and vehemently hot upon untying the codpiecepoint; I itch, I tingle, I wriggle.”4 Resplendent nobles in flashy accoutrements drew archers’ attention, but then martial vogue was supposed to attract attention. Most knights flew personal banners or guidons (corruption of Guide Homme—“Guide Man”). A banner was a square reproduction of heraldic arms and colors and a particularly accomplished knight might have a schwenkel streaming from the end of his banner. Very accomplished knights were permitted two, which was the origin of the swallow-tailed guidon used by modern cavalry. A red schwenkel was a mark of great honor; they were particularly long, and three or more feet was not uncommon. A retinue of the rich and famous could surround a king with a virtual forest of banners, pennons, guidons, and flying schwenkels. Pennons were more personal displays, depicting the primary “charge” or a badge of the bearer. They were long, always tapered to a single point, and restricted to royal peers and knights who displayed them on lances. The knight’s armor was relatively thin (about 60–80 pounds) and finely articulated: “the helmet and cuirasse of one Knight, Ferry de Lorraine, weighed ninety pounds.”5 Tests conducted at the Tower of London confirmed an armored knight could mount, kneel, stand, and certainly fight in his suit of armor, which was evenly distributed proportionately over his entire body as opposed to the harness and rucksacks of twentieth-century soldiers, which constituted a dead weight on their backs and shoulders. The battle-ready version of the knight was streamlined for action. Excessive paraphernalia was discarded, but the kaleidoscope of color and heraldic devices remained, if only to discourage fratricide. The final product, an explosion of color and thundering\n\n38\n\nCavalry from Hoof to Track\n\nhooves atop a powerful horse with flying pennon, was a larger than life force and a daunting spectacle that intimidated opponents. It was as much a mind game as a bloody sport. The Warhorse and Its Furniture Armored combat demanded a powerful war engine: “the great horse” or destrier. Percherons, Belgians, Clydesdales, and shire horses, including modern day draft horses are descended from the destrier and trace their lineage to jousting requirements, which was far more exotic than pulling a beer wagon. The destrier was twice as large as a riding horse, and its iron shoes were reinforced with hobnails for support and additional clout against infantry. Horseshoes were de rigueur for the Western warhorses; Asiatic horses appear to have had tougher hooves as the Mongols conquered their empire with horses au"
