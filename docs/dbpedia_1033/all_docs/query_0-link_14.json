        "text": "Township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, US\n\nTownship in New Jersey, United States\n\nHolmdel Township ( ) is a township in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located near Raritan Bay in the Raritan Valley region, the township is a regional commercial hub of Central Jersey, home to Bell Labs and PNC Bank Arts Center, and a bedroom community of New York City in the New York Metropolitan Area.[19][20][21]\n\nAs of the 2020 U.S. census, the township's population was 17,400,[9][10] an increase of 627 (+3.7%) from the 2010 census count of 16,773,[22][23] which in turn reflected an increase of 992 (+6.3%) from the 15,781 counted in the 2000 census.[24]\n\nHolmdel Township was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 23, 1857, from portions of Raritan Township (now Hazlet).[25] The origin of the township's name is unclear, with some sources indicating that it was named for the Holmes family, who were early settlers of the area, while others point to Dutch language words holm and del, meaning 'pleasant valley'.[26][27]\n\nHolmdel is located 15 miles (24 km) west of the Jersey Shore. The township is notable for its historical and present connection to Bell Labs. Important evidence for the Big Bang was discovered using the Holmdel Horn Antenna at a Bell Labs facility by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, both of whom won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work here.[28] In addition, former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu earned a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on laser cooling in Holmdel.[29]\n\nHolmdel's picturesque beauty, proximity to New York City, and main highways, award-winning public schools, large homes, rich history, the PNC Bank Arts Center, and the presence of many high paying jobs within commuting distance led the township to be ranked the #1 \"Six-Figure Town\" by Money magazine and CNN for 2009.[30]\n\nThe township has been one of the state's highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2013–2017, Holmdel Township residents had a median household income of $155,842, ranked 10th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.[31] Based on data from the 2006–2010 ACS, Holmdel had a per-capita income of $62,120, ranked 46th in the state.[32]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Lenape people were present in the 1600s when Europeans first showed up in the area that is now Holmdel. Holmdel was part of the Monmouth Tract setup by the English in 1675. The area was part of Middletown township when that was set up in 1693, but, split off in 1848 to form part of Raritan township (now Hazlet) which in turn split off Holmdel Township (February 23, 1857).[35][25]\n\nThe earliest work on radio astronomy was conducted by Bell Labs engineer Karl Guthe Jansky in 1931 in Holmdel.[36][37][38] In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson of Bell Labs discovered evidence for cosmic microwave background radiation while performing research with the Holmdel Horn Antenna, earning them the Nobel Prize in Physics.[39]\n\nThe PNC Bank Arts Center is a 10,800-seat outdoor amphitheatre concert venue located in Holmdel. PNC Financial Services agreed to a deal in 1996 under which it would pay $9.2 million for the naming rights, as part an effort by the Parkway Authority to avoid toll increases, a deal that was extended for another five years in 2006.[40][41] The facility, which originally opened in 1968, was commissioned by the Garden State Parkway Authority and built based on a design by architect Edward Durell Stone at a cost of $6.75 million (equivalent to $59.1 million in 2023).[42][43] Adjacent to it is the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which opened on May 7, 1995.[44]\n\nIn 1977, Bruce Springsteen wrote and recorded many of his songs from his album Darkness on the Edge of Town in an old farmhouse in Holmdel.[45]\n\nVoIP provider Vonage Holdings, Inc., relocated its world headquarters from Edison to Holmdel in November 2005, occupying the building that formerly housed Prudential Property Casualty & Insurance.[46]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 18.05 square miles (46.75 km2), including 17.85 square miles (46.22 km2) of land and 0.20 square miles (0.53 km2) of water (1.13%).[1][2] Holmdel Township is located roughly 35 miles (56 km) south of Manhattan.\n\nCrawford Hill, located at (40.3904, −74.1840),[47] is Monmouth County's highest point, standing 391 feet (119 m) above sea level.[48] The top portion of the hill is owned by Alcatel-Lucent and houses a research laboratory of Bell Laboratories.\n\nThe township borders the Monmouth County communities of Aberdeen Township, Colts Neck Township, Hazlet Township, Marlboro Township and Middletown Township.[49][50][51]\n\nUnincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include:[52] Beers, Centerville,[citation needed] Crawford Corners, Everett, Morrells Corner and Pleasant Valley Crossroads.[citation needed]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18601,334—18701,4156.1%18801,57511.3%18901,479−6.1%19001,190−19.5%19101,058−11.1%19201,1004.0%19301,1918.3%19401,2010.8%19501,38014.9%19602,959114.4%19706,117106.7%19808,44738.1%199011,53236.5%200015,78136.8%201016,7736.3%202017,4003.7%2023 (est.)17,402[9][11]0.0%\n\nIn 2009, the average annual family income was $159,633, making it one of the highest in the country.[30]\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 16,773 people, 5,584 households, and 4,612 families in the township.

Shaw Arboretum), covering 22 acres (8.9 ha) and established in 1963, which offers examples of the trees, shrubs and plant life of Monmouth County.[67]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government\n\n[edit]\n\nHolmdel Township is governed under the Township form of New Jersey municipal government, one of 141 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form, the second-most commonly used form of government in the state.[68] The Township Committee is comprised of five members, who are elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the November general election in a three-year cycle.[7][69] At an annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another as Deputy Mayor. The Township Committee exercises control over the conduct of municipal business by means of legislation through ordinances or resolutions, approval and adoption of the annual budget and the formulation of policy to be carried out by the staff.[3]\n\nAs of 2024 , members of the Holmdel Township Council are Mayor Rocco Impreveduto (R, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2024), Deputy Mayor Brian Foster (R, term on committee ends 2025; term as deputy mayor ends 2024), Kim LaMountain (R, 2025), Domenico \"DJ\" Luccarelli (R, 2026) and Joseph Romano (R, 2026).[3][70][71][72][73]\n\nIn November 2021, voters approved the establishment of a Charter Study Commission that would review the township's options for changing its form of government and would make recommendations to be considered by the public.[73][74] In April 2022, the commission recommended that the township adopt the Council-Manager form of government available under the Faulkner Act, in which the main change from the current government would be that day-to-day operation of the township would be in the hands of a professional administrator.[75]\n\nIn the November 2019 general election, a recount put two independent candidates in office, with Prakash Santhana winning the second of the two seats by a margin of two votes over the Republican candidate.[76][77]\n\nDeputy Mayor Serena DiMaso left office in January 2012 to fill the vacant seat of Robert D. Clifton on the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders.[78] Joseph Ponisi was selected to fill Dimaso's vacant seat and took office in January 2012, then was elected to the remainder of her term in the November 2012 general election.[79][80]\n\nFederal, state, and county representation\n\n[edit]\n\nHolmdel Township is located in the 3rd Congressional District[81] and is part of New Jersey's 13th state legislative district.[82][83][84]\n\nPrior to the 2010 Census, Holmdel Township had been part of the 12th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[85]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 3rd congressional district is represented by Andy Kim (D, Moorestown).[86] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[87] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[88][89]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 13th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the New Jersey Senate by Declan O'Scanlon (R, Little Silver) and in the General Assembly by Vicky Flynn (R, Holmdel Township) and Gerard Scharfenberger (R, Middletown Township).[90]\n\nMonmouth County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of five members who are elected at-large to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats up for election each year as part of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, the board selects one of its members to serve as director and another as deputy director.[91] As of 2024 , Monmouth County's Commissioners are:\n\nDirector Thomas A.
