Revolving Door jobs at War Toy companies and Rand Think Tank jobs help influence peaceful colleagues to assent to war. Read this article By Bryan Bender from Boston Globe -- December 26, 2010\n\nWASHINGTON  An hour after the official ceremony marking the end of his\n\n35-year career in the Air Force, General Gregory Speedy Martin\n\nreturned to his quarters to swap his dress uniform for golf attire. He\n\nwas ready for his first tee time as a retired four-star general.\n\nBut almost as soon as he closed the door that day in 2005 his phone\n\nrang. It was an executive at Northrop Grumman, asking if he was\n\ninterested in working for the manufacturer of the B-2 stealth bomber as\n\na paid consultant. A few weeks later, Martin received another call. This\n\ntime it was the Pentagon, asking him to join a top-secret Air Force\n\npanel studying the future of stealth aircraft technology.\n\nMartin was understandably in demand, having been the general in charge\n\nof all Air Force weapons programs, including the B-2, for the previous\n\nfour years. He said yes to both offers.\n\nIn almost any other realm it would seem a clear conflict of interest \n\npitting his duty to the US military against the interests of his\n\nemployer  not to mention a revolving-door sprint from uniformed\n\nresponsibilities to private paid advocacy.\n\nBut this is the Pentagon where, a Globe review has found, such apparent\n\nconflicts are a routine fact of life at the lucrative nexus between the\n\ndefense procurement system, which spends hundreds of billions of dollars\n\na year, and the industry that feasts on those riches. And almost nothing\n\nis ever done about it.\n\nThe Globe analyzed the career paths of 750 of the highest ranking\n\ngenerals and admirals who retired during the last two decades and found\n\nthat, for most, moving into what many in Washington call the\n\nrent-a-general business is all but irresistible.\n\nFrom 2004 through 2008, 80 percent of retiring three- and four-star\n\nofficers went to work as consultants or defense executives, according to\n\nthe Globe analysis. That compares with less than 50 percent who followed\n\nthat path a decade earlier, from 1994 to 1998.\n\nIn some years, the move from general staff to industry is a virtual\n\nclean sweep. Thirty-four out of 39 three- and four-star generals and\n\nadmirals who retired in 2007 are now working in defense roles  nearly\n\n90 percent.\n\nAnd in many cases there is nothing subtle about what the generals have\n\nto sell  Martins firm is called The Four Star Group, for example. The\n\nrevolving-door culture of Capitol Hill  where former lawmakers and\n\nstaffers commonly market their insider knowledge to lobbying firms  is\n\nnow pervasive at the senior rungs of the military leadership.\n\nAmong the Globe findings:\n\n¦ Dozens of retired generals employed by defense firms maintain Pentagon\n\nadvisory roles, giving them unparalleled levels of influence and access to\n\ninside information on Department of Defense procurement plans.\n\n¦ The generals are, in many cases, recruited for private sector roles well\n\nbefore they retire, raising questions about their independence and\n\njudgment while still in uniform. The Pentagon is aware and even supports this\n\npractice.\n\n¦ The feeder system from some commands to certain defense firms is so\n\npowerful that successive generations of commanders have been hired by the\n\nsame firms or into the same field. For example, the last seven generals\n\nand admirals who worked as Department of Defense gatekeepers for international\n\narms sales are now helping military contractors sell weapons and defense\n\ntechnology overseas.\n\n¦ When a general-turned-businessman arrives at the Pentagon, he is often\n\ntreated with extraordinary deference  as if still in uniform  which can\n\ngreatly increase his effectiveness as a rainmaker for industry. The\n\nmilitary even has name for it  the bobblehead effect.\n\nWe are changing the perception and maybe the reality of what it means to\n\nbe a general, said retired General Robert Doc Foglesong, who retired as\n\nthe second-ranking Air Force officer in 2006.\n\nThe fundamental question, he said, is whether this is shaping the\n\nacquisition system and influencing what the Pentagon buys. I think the\n\nanswer is yes.\n\nA post-retirement business\n\nSome members of Congress who served in the military said the system needs\n\nmuch stricter disclosure rules. With few exceptions, all the Pentagon\n\nrequires now is for retired officers to wait one year before directly\n\nadvocating for a contract before the specific military branch they served in.\n\nA lot of these guys earn two to three times their retirement money,\n\nsaid Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and West Point graduate. If\n\nyou are deriving a significant portion of your nonpension income from defense\n\ncompanies actively engaged in contracting  especially if you are also\n\ninvolved in these advisory panels  that should be disclosed.\n\nWhen I was an officer in the 1970s, most general officers went off to\n\nsome sunny place and retired, he added. Now the definition of success of a\n\ngeneral officer is to move on and become successful in the business world.\n\nRepresentative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania, a retired three-star admiral,\n\nsaid that when he was in uniform he saw firsthand the influence retired\n\nadmirals have when they are brought in to advise the Navy.\n\nRank did mean something. The principal guy in the room really drove the\n\nthing. There is a hesitancy to question them, he said. If there isnt\n\ntransparency or knowledge of who they are working for when they are\n\nadvising the Pentagon, you are building a military that is not all it can be.\n\nMartin and other generals interviewed by the Globe maintain that their\n\npostretirement consulting business is ethical and beneficial for Americas\n\ndefense. They said it matches private-sector expertise with crucial\n\nPentagon missions.\n\nAccess sounds sleazy, but it brings a value, Martin said. I am\n\ninterested in doing things that I think the Air Force or [Department of\n\nDefense] might benefit from.\n\nMartin and Northrop Grumman declined to discuss the details of his\n\nactivities on behalf of the company. Martin said his ongoing role as\n\nchairman of the Air Force Studies Board is mostly limited to deciding what\n\nto study, not making specific recommendations.\n\nI do not substantially influence the findings of studies that could help\n\nmy clients, Martin said.\n\nYet judging the validity of such assertions is difficult. Even fellow\n\nparticipants in the two-year stealth aircraft study, for example, said\n\nthey were not told of Martins industry clients. Seth Bonder, a member of the\n\nNational Academy of Engineering who also participated on the panel, said,\n\nI never knew what Speedy was doing elsewhere. I dont inquire what he has in\n\nterms of industry connections.\n\nBonder said disclosure of potential conflicts would be desirable, to\n\nprevent confidential data from reaching contractors at an early stage.\n\nYou get privied information, he said. Clear potential for conflict\n\nThere was a clear sense of urgency as top Army officials and advisers\n\nconverged on the National Defense Universitys campus on the banks of the\n\nPotomac River for a high-level meeting in June 2009.\n\nTheir goal: develop ideas for the Armys next ground combat vehicle. The\n\nArmy badly needed to get a new tank program rolling after its previous\n\neffort resulted in an embarrassing, $14 billion flop.\n\nA veil of secrecy surrounded the event. The Army did not publicly disclose\n\nthe guest list for the meeting. It required participants to sign\n\nnondisclosure agreements.\n\nAnd to block potential bidders from gaining an unfair advantage, defense\n\ncontractors were pointedly excluded.\n\nYet, defense contractors had a robust presence inside.\n\nAt least six retired generals invited by the Army were also consultants or\n\nexecutives of defense companies that would bid on the new tank contracts,\n\naccording to a meeting roster obtained by the Globe. The roster did not\n\nlist their private-sector affiliations. Each was listed by the Army only as\n\ndistinguished participant.\n\nContacted by the Globe, several generals said they disclosed their\n\npotential conflicts of interest to the Army, on ethics questionnaires, before\n\narriving at the meeting.\n\nThe Army refused to comment on the ethical issues raised by the generals\n\npresence and declined to release copies of the ethics disclosure forms,\n\nciting privacy concerns. It confirmed, however, that no one was\n\ndisqualified from participation based on their responses.\n\nA look at some of those attending suggests that there was ample potential\n\nfor direct conflicts.\n\nRetired Army Lieutenant General William H. Campbell oversaw all of the\n\nArmys information systems before leaving the service in 2000. Since 2002, he has\n\nbeen employed as a senior vice president at BAE Systems, one of the Armys\n\nprimary weapons suppliers and a major bidder for the new ground combat\n\nvehicle.\n\nCampbell said in e-mail responses that he did not have a conflict of\n\ninterest because he works in the electronics division of BAE, not the\n\nground combat division, which is bidding to build the new tank. Campbell and BAE\n\ndeclined to say how much, if any, of the electronics system in the new\n\ntank might be produced by Campbells division at BAE.\n\nBut Campbell suggested that other generals at the meeting may have been\n\nskating closer to the edge.\n\nI think there is a danger of a real or perceived conflict of interest\n\nwhen an individual who is working on a defense program provides external advice\n\nto the military on the very same program, in either an official or\n\nunofficial capacity, he said.\n\nCampbell did not name names.\n\nBAE had another representative in the meeting room: retired Lieutenant\n\nGeneral Joseph L. Yakovac, formerly the top deputy to the Armys senior\n\nacquisition official, who was advising BAE on the ground combat vehicle as\n\na private consultant.\n\nIt was Yakovac who had overseen, while in uniform, the failed, $14 billion\n\nfuture combat system program. And the office he once ran was in charge\n\nof devising the new combat vehicle. Some of the active-duty officers now\n\nrunning the unit previously worked for Yakovac, including Major General\n\nJohn Barley. Nevertheless, Yakovac said he was assured by Army lawyers he could\n\noffer advice without running afoul of any ethics rules.\n\nThe new system is considered a separate contract by the military, freeing\n\nhim to take an advisory role. As a rule, Yakovac said, he does not seek to\n\ninfluence former Army colleagues on matters involving his private defense\n\nclients. And he said he provides clients with advice that is based solely\n\non publicly available information.\n\nYou spend 35 years in an ethical place, he said. You dont leave that\n\nat the door.\n\nAnother retired general at the session was General John H. Tilelli, who\n\nwas the vice chief of staff of the Army before retiring in 2000. He now runs\n\nCypress International, which has a consulting agreement with Science\n\nApplications International Corporation, another bidder on the ground\n\ncombat vehicle program, confirmed Melissa L. Koskovich, a corporation\n\nspokeswoman.\n\nRetired General William S. Wallace, who ran the Armys Training and\n\nDoctrine Command before retiring in 2008, said he was not representing one of the\n\nprospective bidders at the time of the meeting. Like the other\n\nparticipants, however, one of the ethics questions he was asked to answer, according to\n\na blank copy, was whether he intended to consult in the future for a client\n\nthat may have a direct interest in bidding on the new tank.\n\nWallace declined to say how he answered that question. Wallace confirmed\n\nthat he is now a consultant for General Dynamics Land Systems Division,\n\nwhich is seeking to win the ground combat vehicle contract. But he\n\ninsisted he does not use his Army contacts to further the business interests of his\n\nclients.\n\nOn this point, the public is essentially left to trust the word of Wallace\n\nand other retired generals that they do not improperly trade on their\n\ninfluence and access. Thats because they are almost never required to\n\ndivulge their clients, or say how much they get paid. The few rules that\n\ndo guide the Pentagon influence trade prohibit only a narrow range of sales\n\nactivities.\n\nNavigating ethical issues\n\nThe one-year cooling off period prohibits a retired general or admiral\n\nfrom directly making a sales pitch to their former military branch. For\n\ntwo years after retirement, the Pentagon prohibits them from participating in\n\nparticular matters, meaning ongoing contracts greater than $10 million\n\nthat were under their command. New editions of older weapon systems  like\n\nthe new ground combat vehicle  are not considered particular matters.\n\nEven if restrictions apply, behind the scenes work is permitted, so\n\nessentially they can assist a new employer as long as they dont place the\n\ncall or show up at meetings, said Scott Amey, the general counsel at the\n\nProject on Government Oversight, a watchdog group.\n\nThe generals who navigate these ethical minefields said they are capable\n\nof managing potential conflicts without oversight, because of their own\n\nintegrity.\n\nYou have to have a firewall in your head, said industry consultant and\n\nformer Vice Admiral Justin D. McCarthy.\n\nBut a number of retired generals contacted by the Globe said they are\n\nuncomfortable with the laxity of the system and refuse to use their\n\nPentagon contacts to win private clients.\n\nAir Force Lieutenant General Kenneth E. Eickmann, who frequently dealt\n\nwith defense contractors when he was on active duty, is among them.\n\nI always felt uncomfortable dealing with former generals working for\n\nthose companies, said Eickmann, who retired in 1998 and is now a senior fellow\n\nat the Energy Institute at the University of Texas. Sometimes I felt like\n\nthey were relying on a past friendship to get me to do something.\n\nWilliam Buck Kernan, a retired Army four-star general who recently left\n\nMilitary Professional Resources, Inc., a company that provides training,\n\nlogistics, and other support to the military, believes trading on such\n\naccess and influence raises difficult questions.\n\nI didnt like people doing it to me when I was a four-star, a three-star,\n\neven a two-star  using a previous relationship as an entree to selling me\n\nsomething, he said. The perception from the outside of a previous\n\nsuperior now dealing with a previous subordinate can cause all kinds of\n\nquestions.\n\nNavy Admiral William J. Fallon said he turned down consulting offers after\n\nlearning that defense industry clients were seeking tactical\n\ninformation from inside the Pentagon. Said Fallon: I didnt want to be a walking\n\nRolodex.\n\nHumvee lobbying pays off\n\nThe Humvee is perhaps the most visible icon of modern warfare  bulky,\n\ntough, and ubiquitous on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq. But this\n\nyear the Army said it would build them no more.\n\nInstead, it proposed shifting half a billion dollars in money for new\n\nHumvees to a program of fixing up old models, which Army officials\n\ndetermined would be more cost-effective.\n\nWhether or not it was a good move for the Army, it was a looming debacle\n\nfor the Humvees exclusive manufacturer.\n\nThe firm  AM General, of South Bend, Ind.  fielded a trio of former\n\nmilitary leaders with major Beltway clout, including retired Army General\n\nJack Keane, to try to reverse the plan.\n\nA commanding presence at 6 foot 5, Keane, 66, turned in his fatigues seven\n\nyears ago for a pinstriped suit. He is now one of the most influential\n\nretired generals in Washington, holding a seat on a high-level Pentagon\n\nadvisory panel, the Defense Policy Board, and counting among his defense\n\nindustry clients McAndrews and Forbes, the New York holding company that\n\nowns AM General.\n\nKeane contacted Army General Peter Chiarelli, as vice chief of staff the\n\nArmys second-ranking officer, to make the case that the service should\n\ncontinue buying new Humvees, Keane confirmed in an interview. He said he\n\ntold Chiarelli that he believes the Army needs to maintain a strategic\n\npartnership with AM General, whose relationship with the military dates\n\nback to building Jeeps during World War II.\n\nChiarelli declined through a spokesman to be interviewed for this article.\n\nKeane also helped AM General make its case to influential members of\n\nCongress, according to a former defense industry official with direct\n\nknowledge of the discussions.\n\nKeane was involved in the effort on the Hill even though he is not a\n\nregistered lobbyist. He maintained in an interview that he was not\n\nrequired to register because he does not spend more than 20 percent of his time\n\ncontacting Congress, as the lobbying disclosure laws stipulate. He said he\n\nonly helps clients reach the right decision makers in the Pentagon or on\n\nCapitol Hill.\n\nIn addition to Keane, AM General was paying the Spectrum Group, a defense\n\nconsulting firm with a roster of retired generals, about $20,000 a month\n\nto help arrange access to key decision makers, according to a former Pentagon\n\nofficial with direct knowledge of the contract. According to a former AM\n\nGeneral executive, the AM General account at Spectrum was overseen by\n\nretired Army Lieutenant General John Caldwell.\n\nCaldwells last job before retiring in 2004 was as the deputy to the\n\nservices top acquisition official. Before that he served as commander of the Armys\n\nTank-Automotive Command, the Michigan-based unit that is responsible for\n\nacquiring Humvees and all other ground vehicles in the Army. Spectrum did\n\nnot return several calls for comment.\n\nA third retired general helping AM General was General Paul J. Kern, a\n\nmember of the Pentagons Defense Science Board, an official military\n\nadvisory panel. Kern, who declined a request for an interview, retired in\n\n2005 as the chief of the Army Materiel Command and was previously the\n\nservices top acquisition officer. Kern, who served as president of AM\n\nGeneral from 2009 to 2010, is also an associate at The Cohen Group, the\n\nconsulting firm that includes a number of high-profile retired generals\n\nand admirals.\n\nAll that muscle appeared to pay off for AM General, which did not respond\n\nto a request for an interview.\n\nIn July of this year, Congress denied the Armys request to shift more\n\nthan $500 million to the refurbishment of Humvees and ordered the service to\n\nuse the money to keep buying new ones.\n\nTom Christie, a former senior Pentagon acquisition official, said the\n\nHumvee debate is a prime example of how defense companies gain by deploying\n\nretired generals. They are very useful in opening doors.\n\nA convincing proposal\n\nAs envisioned by Northrop Grumman, the Fire Scout  a nimble,\n\nremote-controlled surveillance helicopter  would help troops pinpoint\n\nenemies hiding beneath a jungle canopy. With hovering capability, it could\n\npeer into places a Predator drone could not.\n\nBut before Northrop could get to work building Fire Scouts, it first\n\nneeded to convince the Army the project was a good idea. For persuasive\n\nassistance, it turned to Burdeshaw Associates Ltd.\n\nBurdeshaw was founded in 1979 and is one of the oldest rent-a-general\n\nconsulting firms. It has a reputation for zealously guarding the identity\n\nof its clients, and even its headquarters seems deliberately low profile,\n\nhoused above a Safeway grocery store in suburban Bethesda, Md.\n\nTo get the Fire Scout off the ground, Burdeshaw did more than just set up\n\nmeetings with key Army decision makers. It was hired by Northrop Grumman\n\nto write a concept of operations for the aircraft, according to retired\n\nGeneral William Richardson, a former commander of the Training and\n\nDoctrine Command and an adviser to Burdeshaw.\n\nThe concept of operations is an official document that is a crucial step\n\nin defense procurement. It lays out exactly how a weapon is supposed to work\n\nand what its mission will be, and provides the justification for pursuing\n\nits development.\n\nAfter the Army adopted the concept, it gave Northrop a 10-year deal and\n\npaid the firm $109 million to build eight Fire Scouts. But they are still\n\nsitting at Northrop Grummans Mississippi plant, unused. With little explanation,\n\nthe service decided earlier this year that it didnt need the aircraft\n\nafter all.\n\nThe Army would not respond to questions about why it canceled the Fire\n\nScout. Notifying Congress early this year that it was killing the program,\n\nit said it was focusing on other priorities.\n\nBurdeshaws chief executive, retired Army General William Hartzog, who\n\nuntil 1998 commanded the Army Training and Doctrine Command, did not respond to\n\nrepeated requests to discuss his companys business.\n\nAn official at Northrop Grummans Aerospace Systems Division who was not\n\nauthorized to speak publicly disputed Richardsons characterization of\n\nBurdeshaws work, saying the firms consultants crafted a series of\n\nbriefing papers that helped make the case for the project, not an official concept\n\nof operations. Northrop Grumman declined to comment on the record about\n\nBurdeshaws work on the Fire Scout program.\n\nThe Army Aviation Center in Alabama, which is responsible for all Army\n\naircraft, did not respond to several requests to comment on how the\n\ndocuments provided by Burdeshaw were used.\n\nRetired officers frequently help industry and the military branches\n\ndevelop the concept or justification for weapons, according to interviews with\n\nmilitary and industry participants. In other cases they try to influence\n\nweapons projects more indirectly: by passing along white papers and\n\nother documents drafted by their clients that question the rationale for\n\nawarding contracts to their competitors.\n\nWallace, the Army four-star who retired in 2008 as the commander of the\n\nTraining and Doctrine Command, said the phenomenon has grown in recent\n\nyears. He cautioned that the Army should only use such private-industry\n\nanalyses as a starting point for further work.\n\nI hope [the Army] wouldnt just take it and put an Army logo on it and\n\nsay its ours, said Wallace, who now consults for General Dynamics on the\n\nground combat vehicle program, among other companies. Doesnt sound like\n\na good idea to me.\n\nTapping a niche market\n\nThe Four Star Group certainly lives up to its name. The heavyweights on its consulting roster, all retired from the Air Force, served as chief of staff; deputy chief of staff; chief of the Space Command; head of the Materiel Command (Martin); and commander of the Air National Guard. The newest adviser for the group is former Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters.\n\nWhat sets these retired generals apart in the military consulting world \n\naside from the blatant way their brand touts their old command authority \n\nis their market niche. They are using their influence and knowledge of the\n\nPentagon to build a business in equity investing.\n\nThe partners in the Four Star Group have an exclusive arrangement with a\n\n$3 billion private equity firm in Los Angeles, the Gores Group, which awards\n\nthem an equity stake in companies that Gores acquires based on their\n\nadvice. What Gores gets in return is knowledge about which companies are drawing\n\nattention from key Washington decision makers, or are developing\n\ntechnologies that will be in demand by the Pentagon.\n\nThrough their relationship with Gores, the generals own shares, or could\n\nown shares in the future, in firms that make communications devices for\n\nsoldiers, blast-resistant glass for embassies and military installations,\n\nand radar equipment.\n\nThe Globe identified several other equity firms with defense expertise\n\nthat also are deploying retired generals as part of an investment strategy.\n\nCritics say this emerging line of retirement business for generals raises\n\nthorny questions about their access to privileged Department of Defense\n\ninformation.\n\nThe big question is should they be using their contacts in the military\n\nto benefit their new investment? said Charles Elson, director of the\n\nWeinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. At what\n\npoint does your fidelity to the military dissipate or go away? Do the\n\ncontacts they have in the military benefit their new operations?\n\nBut Bill Patton, a former corporate executive who helped set up The Four\n\nStar Group and is its chairman and chief executive, said the firms\n\nprincipal owners scrupulously avoid trading on privileged information.\n\nI think this is how a company of ethical retired generals should operate,\n\nhe said. The generals role, he said, is limited to acting as assisters,\n\nadvisers, and introducers.\n\nThe demand for the generals who can guide investment decisions is expected\n\nto grow in the future, say observers of the trend.\n\nRetired Army General Wesley K. Clark, who now works as a lobbyist and\n\ninvestment banker for companies seeking alternative energy contracts,\n\nbelieves the growing hunger among private equity firms and Wall Street\n\ninvestors to enlist retired generals is a consequence of a broader\n\nphenomenon: the increasing importance of the military to Americas\n\nindustrial base.\n\nIt is the militarization of the economy, Clark said in a recent\n\ninterview.\n\nNote: what we didn't read was HOW MANY GENERALS are on BILDERBERGERS BOARD, the planet's decision making insider group!\n\nBryan Bender can be reached at bender@globe.com.\n\nhttp://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2010/12/26/defense_firms_lure_retired_generals/?page=full\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nOur POSTER is ANITA SANDS HERNANDEZ, Los Angeles Writer, mother of 4 and career Astrologer.
