        "text": "The purpose of this chapter and the following one is to give a succinct overview of the history of North Africa from antiquity to independence, with an emphasis on its Berber components, particularly in the territories that constitute modern-day Algeria and Morocco. This is not a Berberist reading, per se, although such a reading can hardly be ignored either. In any case, the intent is to dispassionately present the main developments of Maghribi history from the mists of time to the end of modern colonialism-political, social, cultural, religious, and legalfrom the angle of the Berber-speaking populations, and their interactions with other social and political groupings and forces. Guiding this brief overview is the notion that the numerous manifestations of being Berber, including the existence of various forms of a single language, social organization, territorial cores, and daily praxis, were durable enough to enable the inclusion of Berbers within the broad category of premodern ethnies expounded by Anthony Smith.1 This Berber-centered account confirms Miroslav Hroch's stipulation that the nation-formation process \"is a distinctively older phenomenon than the modern nation and nationalism.\" From this perspective, Hroch's insistence that any interpretation of modern national identity cannot ignore the peculiarities of premodern national development, or degrade it to the level of a mere myth, resonates loudly.2 Ironically, the Berbers rate nary a mention by Smith himself, apart from a map of the Mediterranean world between 200 BC and AD 400 in one of his books, which denotes the territory of Numidia (encompassing portions of modern-day Algeria and Tunisia).3 In any event, most ethnic identities are like that of the Berbers: \"nuanced, mutable, their boundaries and characteristics changing with time.\"4\n\nEven for the non-expert observer of the Maghreb, the Berber parameter has now become an essential element of the political, social, and cultural scene in both Algeria and Morocco. In Algeria, since 1989, a whole series of spectacular actions confirmed the significant adherence of the Kabyle population to the Berber claim. The latest demonstrations across the region by Kabyle youth in June- July 1998, following upon the assassination of Lounes Matoub, remind us that the embers of Berberism are ready to be fanned into flames at any time. In Morocco, the August 29, 1994 royal address in favor of the teaching of Berber took place in a quieter landscape, but it truly represents the rise of a Berber aspiration. Albeit admittedly lacking organization and political character, the Moroccan political power machine undoubtedly wanted to anticipate and neutralize it to avoid a possible evolution in \"the Algerian way.\" This paper will be limited to a presentation of an update of the situation of the \"Berber question\" in Algeria, the forces involved, its actors, and the recent and current development"
