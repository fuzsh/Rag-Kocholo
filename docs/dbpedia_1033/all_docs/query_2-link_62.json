This is evident in relation to lack of the access and ownership of natural resources, social opportunities such as education, access to information and decision making means and the influence of cultural-hereditary characteristics of coastal society. The thesis examines learning in Lunga, the key institutions, their roles and importance. Drawing on Mamdani’s concept of bifurcated state, it outlines the historical background of the formal education system that is a necessary frame for understanding many specific problems of education in contemporary Mozambique. In this setting, the thesis reflects on formal, traditional and Islamic education and their different forms of valorisation in the past and present. The study examines the coastal habitus – the problems of life on the periphery, and the social, political and physical distance....\n\nThe Journal of Comparative Studies and International Education (JCSIE) is a quarterly peer-reviewed publication that aims to provide scholars, practitioners, professors, administrators, decision makers, policy makers, and other interested stakeholders with an innovative, interdisciplinary, cross-sectorial, cross-cultural and high quality platform for publication and dissemination of original research, conceptual and theoretical frameworks, findings from fields observations, and innovative practices in comparative studies, comparative and international education, global education, glocal education, and transnational education."
