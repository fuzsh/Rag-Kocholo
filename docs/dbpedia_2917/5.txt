Participation in Significant Complex Litigation and Trial Experience:

For more than 35 years, Kevin Roddy has represented plaintiffs in many significant class actions, representative actions, and derivative actions litigated in federal and state courts throughout the United States. He has represented individual and institutional clients. Mr. Roddy has served as appointed lead counsel in representing plaintiffs in many significant cases, and has helped secure recoveries exceeding $2 billion. Results achieved in prior matters are not meant to be a guarantee of success as the facts and legal circumstances vary from matter to matter.

Mr. Roddy’s efforts in these complex cases have been praised by federal and state courts. In approving a worldwide settlement of a civil RICO and consumer protection class action brought on behalf of approximately 18 million people who used Western Union’s money transfer services to transfer money from one country to another, in which Mr. Roddy served as Co-Lead Counsel for Plaintiffs, Senior U.S. District Judge Charles Sifton of the Eastern District of New York lauded Mr. Roddy’s “extensive experience handling civil RICO cases and class actions.” This comment, made by a judge in a particular case, is not an endorsement of the attorney's legal skill or ability. The Court noted that the team of plaintiffs’ counsel, led by Mr. Roddy, had “secured a significant recovery, including injunctive relief that requires [Western Union] to materially change the consumer disclosure forms and receipts that it uses throughout the world, in a complex, risky class action, and confronted defense counsel from highly respected law firms.” In re Western Union Money Transfer Litigation, Master File No. CV-01-0335 (CPS) (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2005) (Memorandum and Order, at 13, 16). That case was settled in 2005 on a worldwide basis for consideration exceeding $65 million and the imposition of worldwide injunctive relief.

In coordinated cases brought in the Superior Court of Sacramento County, California, In re Ford Explorer Cases, JCCP Nos. 4266 & 4270, Mr. Roddy was chosen Co-Lead Counsel for the California Plaintiff Class, which consisted of over 450,000 vehicle owners. In 2005, Coordination Trial Judge David DeAlba certified a statewide (California) class. During 2007, Mr. Roddy, along with other Plaintiffs’ counsel, tried the class action for 50 days in the Sacramento County Superior Court. The same year, the parties announced a proposed four-state class action settlement on behalf of nearly one million vehicle owners residing in California, Illinois, Texas and Connecticut. That settlement was approved by Judge DeAlba in 2008.

In another class action that was prosecuted simultaneously in state courts in California and Florida, In re Rexall Cellasene Cases, Mr. Roddy was chosen Co-Lead Counsel for the nationwide consumer class and, working together with attorneys from the Federal Trade Commission, in 2003 he successfully negotiated a $20 million settlement that provided consumers with a full-dollar recovery and imposed precedent-setting injunctive relief governing the entire dietary supplement industry.

In Smith v. FirstEnergy Corp., Case No. 20-03755 (S.D. Ohio), Mr. Roddy and co-counsel represented a class of Ohio ratepayers (consumers and businesses) in civil racketeering action brought against officers and directors of a large public utility arising out of a legislative bribery scheme. After extensive litigation, see Smith v. FirstEnergy Corp., 518 F. Supp. 3d 1118 (S.D. Ohio 2021), and mediation before a retired federal judge, Mr. Roddy, and co-counsel negotiated a $49 million class action settlement for the benefit of the taxpayers. The settlement was approved by Judge Edmund Sargus in 2022.

In DCG&T f/b/o Battaglia v. Knight, 68 F. Supp. 3d 579 (E.D. Va. 2014), a shareholder derivative action, Mr. Roddy was chosen co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, and he successfully negotiated a $12 million settlement for the benefit of REIT unit holders who objected to a corporate merger.

In Roberts v. C.R. England, Inc., Case No. 2:12-CV-00302 (D. Utah), working with co-counsel from throughout the country, Roddy secured nationwide class certification of a class consisting of more than 14,000 long-haul truck drivers, and successfully negotiated a $98 million settlement. The class action settlement was approved by Judge Robert Shelby of the District of Utah in 2019.

Mr. Roddy has tried more than a dozen cases in federal and state courts in New Jersey, California, Colorado, Virginia, Arizona, Tennessee, and North Carolina. In In re American Continental Corp./Lincoln Savings & Loan Securities Litigation, he was one of the lead trial counsel for a class of 23,000 defrauded shareholders and bondholders; that case (including a five-month jury trial in the District of Arizona) resulted in settlements of approximately $250 million and a jury verdict against the non-settling defendants exceeding $3 billion. In The Industry Network System, Inc. v. Armstrong World Industries, he was co-lead trial counsel in a 68-day antitrust conspiracy jury trial in the District of New Jersey. In Stilwell Developments v. Wing Wah Chong, he was lead trial counsel for the plaintiff smoke alarm manufacturer in a two-month intellectual property trial involving the enforcement of patents and copyrights; that case resulted in a $7 million jury verdict for the plaintiff, which was successfully enforced in ancillary proceedings in the Hong Kong courts.

In CGC Holding Co., LLC v. Hutchens, Case No. 11-1012, a RICO class action arising out of an advance fee lending scheme and pending in the District of Colorado, he was appointed co-lead counsel for plaintiffs and the certified class of consumers who were allegedly defrauded. In May 2017, Mr. Roddy served as co-lead trial counsel during a 10-day jury trial. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs and class members, found the defendants to be liable for RICO violations, and awarded $8.4 million in compensatory damages. On September 26, 2017, Judge Blaine Jackson awarded treble damages and entered a judgment awarding more than $24 million to plaintiffs and class members.

On December 18, 2017, Judge Jackson issued his Rulings on Additional Post-Trial Motions, directing the clerk to enter a final judgment in the amount of $25 million, including costs and interest, and imposed a constructive trust over defendants’ properties. Describing the litigation as “a complex, intensely litigated, and difficult case,” Judge Jackson described the performance of Mr. Roddy and his co-counsel as “an excellent job.” CGC Holding Co., LLC v. Hutchens, Civil Action No. 11-cv-01012-RBJ-KLM, Docket No. 890 (D. Colo.). This comment, made by a judge in a particular case, is not an endorsement of the attorney's legal skill of ability.

The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s rulings. CGC Holding Co., LLC v. Hutchens, 780 Fed. Appx. 604 (10th Cir. 2019), subsequent opinion, 974 F.3d 1201 (10th Cir. 2020).

Expert Witness Experience:

Mr. Roddy has served as an expert witness in both federal and state court. In one case litigated in the Northern District of Texas, he served as an expert witness for the defendant law firms in a legal malpractice action arising out of class action settlements. In another case litigated in the Orange County, California, Superior Court, he served as an expert witness for the defendant lawyers in a malicious prosecution case arising out of a consumer protection class action. In August 2016, Mr. Roddy testified as an expert witness on behalf of the defendant attorney in a federal criminal case tried in the Southern District of Mississippi. In February 2018, Roddy testified as an expert witness on behalf of the defendant attorney in a federal criminal case tried in the Western District of Texas.

Appellate Court Experience:

Mr. Roddy has extensive experience in the appellate courts. For example, in March 2006, Mr. Roddy argued a civil RICO case in the United States Supreme Court. The resulting decision, Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451 (2006), established the standard for evaluating proximate causation in such cases.

Some of his significant federal circuit court cases include the following:
