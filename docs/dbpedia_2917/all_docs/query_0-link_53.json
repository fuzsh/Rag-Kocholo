        "text": "(a)\n\n(1) Regulations and procedures governing the bill of lading, documentation, payment, and audit of transportation services acquired by the United States Government are prescribed in 41 CFR part 102-118, Transportation Payment and Audit.\n\n(2) For DoD shipments, corresponding guidance is in DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II.\n\n(b) Under 31 U.S.C. 3726, all agencies are required to establish a prepayment audit program. For details on the establishment of a prepayment audit, see 41 CFR part 102-118.\n\n(c) The agency designated in paragraph (a)(3) of the clause at 52.247-67 shall forward original copies of paid freight bills/invoices, bills of lading, passenger coupons, and supporting documents as soon as possible following the end of the month, in one package for postpayment audit to the General Services Administration, Transportation Audit Division (QMCA), Crystal Plaza 4, Room 300, 2200 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202. The specified agency shall include the paid freight bills/invoices, bills of lading, passenger coupons, and supporting documents for first-tier subcontractors under a cost-reimbursement contract. If the inclusion of the paid freight bills/invoices, bills of lading, passenger coupons, and supporting documents for any subcontractor in the shipment is not practicable, the documents may be forwarded to GSA in a separate package.\n\n(d) Any original transportation bills or other documents requested by GSA shall be forwarded promptly. The specified agency shall ensure that the name of the contracting agency is stamped or written on the face of the bill before sending it to GSA.\n\n(e) A statement prepared in duplicate by the specified agency shall accompany each shipment of transportation documents. GSA will acknowledge receipt of the shipment by signing and returning the copy of the statement. The statement shall show-\n\n(1) The name and address of the specified agency;\n\n(2) The contract number, including any alpha-numeric prefix identifying the contracting office;\n\n(3) The name and address of the contracting office;\n\n(4) The total number of bills submitted with the statement; and\n\n(5) A listing of the respective amounts paid or, in lieu of such listing, an adding machine tape of the amounts paid showing the Contractorâ€™s voucher or check numbers.\n\n(a) 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 1 3712 rates may be applied to shipments other than those made by the Government if the total benefit accrues to the Government, i.e., the Government shall pay the charges or directly and completely reimburse the party that initially bears the freight charges. Therefore, 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 1 3712 rates may be used for shipments moving on commercial bills of lading in cost reimbursement contracts under which the transportation costs are direct and allowable costs under the cost principles of part 31.\n\n(b) 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 1 3712 rates may be applied to the movement of household goods and personal effects of contractor employees who are relocated for the convenience and at the direction of the Government and whose total transportation costs are reimbursed by the Government.\n\n(c) The clause at 52.247-1, Commercial Bill of Lading Notations, will ensure that the Government receives the benefit of lower 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 1 3712 rates in cost-reimbursement contracts as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.\n\n(d) Contracting officers shall-\n\n(1) Include in contracts a statement requiring the contractor to use carriers that offer acceptable service at reduced rates if available; and\n\n(2) Ensure that contractors receive the name and location of the transportation officer designated to furnish support and guidance when using Government rate tenders.\n\n(e) The transportation office shall-\n\n(1) Advise and assist contracting officers and contractors; and\n\n(2) Make available to contractors the names of carriers that provide service under 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 1 3712 rates, cite applicable rate tenders, and advise contractors of the statement that must be shown on the carrierâ€™s commercial bill of lading (see the clause at 52.247-1, Commercial Bill of Lading Notations).\n\n(a) Origin of shipments. The contracting officer shall include in solicitations full details regarding the location from which the freight is to be shipped. For example, if a single location is shown, furnish the shipperâ€™s name, street address, city, State, and ZIP code. If several or indefinite locations are involved, as in the case of multiple shippers or drayage contracts, describe the area of origin including boundaries and ZIP codes.\n\n(b) Destination of shipments. The contracting officer shall include full details regarding delivery points. For example, if a single delivery point is shown, furnish the consigneeâ€™s name, street address, city, State, and ZIP code. If several or indefinite delivery points are involved, describe the delivery area, including boundaries and ZIP codes.\n\n(c) Description of the freight. The contracting officer shall include in solicitations-\n\n(1) An inventory if the freight consists of nonbulk items; and\n\n(2) The freight classification description, which should be obtained from the transportation office. If a freight classification description is not available, use a clear nontechnical description. Include additional details necessary to ensure that the prospective offerors have complete information about the freight; e.g., size, weight, hazardous material, whether packed for export, or unusual value.\n\n(d) Exclusion of freight. The contracting officer shall-\n\n(1) Clearly identify any freight or types of shipments that are subject to exclusion; e.g., bulk freight, hazardous commodities, or shipments under or over specified weights; and\n\n(2) Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 52.247-7, Freight Excluded, when any commodities or types of shipments have been identified for exclusion.\n\n(e) Quantity.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall state the actual weight of the freight or a reasonably accurate estimate. The following are examples:\n\n(i) If the contract covers transportation services required over an extended period of time, include a schedule of actual or estimated tonnage or number of items to be transported per week, month, or other time period.\n\n(ii) If the contract covers a group movement of household goods, give an estimate of the aggregate weights and the basis for determining the aggregate weight.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.247-8, Estimated Weights or Quantities Not Guaranteed, when weights or quantities are estimates.\n\n(a)\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall include in the solicitation a statement that the charges in the contract shall not exceed the contractorâ€™s charges for the same service that is-\n\n(i) Available to the general public; or\n\n(ii) Otherwise tendered to the Government.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.247-17, Charges.\n\n(b) The contracting officer shall include in the solicitation a tabulation listing each required service and the basis for the rate (price); e.g.,\"unit of weight\" or \"per work-hour,\" leaving sufficient space for offerors to insert the rates offered for each service.\n\n(c) The following guidelines apply to the composition of a tabulation of transportation or of transportation-related services and their rate (price) bases:\n\n(1) Combination of pricing bases. If various types of services with different bases for assessing charges are required under the same contract, show each service separately and the applicable basis for that service.\n\n(2) Hourly rate basis. If charges are based on an hourly rate, state the method for charging for fractions of an hour; e.g.-\n\n(i) A period of 30 minutes or less is charged at one-half the hourly rate; and\n\n(ii) The hourly rate applies to any portion of an hour that exceeds 30 minutes.\n\n(3) Shipments of varying weights. If charges are based on weight and shipments will vary in weight, request rates on a graduated weight basis. Include a table of graduated weights for offerors to insert rates.\n\n(4) Multiple origins and/or destinations. Specify whether rates are requested for each origin and/or each destination or for specific groups of origins and/or destinations.\n\n(5) Multiple shipments from one origin. If multiple shipments will be tendered at one time to the contractor for delivery to two or more consignees at the same destination, request the rate applicable to the aggregate weight. If such shipments are for delivery to various destinations along the route between origin and last destination, request the rate applicable to the aggregate weight and a stopoff charge for each intermediate destination.\n\n(i) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.247-18, Multiple Shipments, when multiple shipments are tendered at one time to the contractor for transportation from one origin to two or more consignees at the same destination.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.247-19, Stopping in Transit for Partial Unloading, when multiple shipments are tendered at one time to the contractor for transportation from one origin to two or more consignees along the route between origin and last destination.\n\n(6) Estimated quantities or weights. The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations the provision at 52.247-20, Estimated Quantities or Weights for Evaluation of Offers, when quantities or weights of shipments between each origin and destination are not known, stating estimated quantity or weight for each origin/destination pair.\n\n(7) Additional services. If services in addition to those covered in the basic rate are anticipated; e.g., inside delivery, state the conditions under which payment will be made for those services.\n\n(a) Explanation of delivery term.\"F.o.b. origin\" means free of expense to the Government delivered-\n\n(1) On board the indicated type of conveyance of the carrier (or of the Government, if specified) at a designated point in the city, county, and State from which the shipment will be made and from which line-haul transportation service (as distinguished from switching, local drayage, or other terminal service) will begin;\n\n(2) To, and placed on, the carrierâ€™s wharf (at shipside, within reach of the shipâ€™s loading tackle, when the shipping point is within a port area having water transportation service) or the carrierâ€™s freight station;\n\n(3) To a U.S. Postal Service facility; or\n\n(4) If stated in the solicitation, to any Government-designated point located within the same city or commercial zone as the f.o.b. origin point specified in the contract (the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration prescribes commercial zones at Subpart B of 49 CFR part 372).\n\n(b) Contractor responsibilities. The contractor shall-\n\n(1)\n\n(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or\n\n(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements to protect the goods and to ensure assessment of the lowest applicable transportation charge;\n\n(2)\n\n(i) Order specified carrier equipment requested by the Government; or\n\n(ii) If not specified, order appropriate carrier equipment not in excess of capacity to accommodate shipment;\n\n(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the carrier, and load, stow, trim, block, and/or brace carload or truckload shipment (when loaded by the contractor) on or in the carrierâ€™s conveyance as required by carrier rules and regulations;\n\n(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods-\n\n(i) Occurring before delivery to the carrier;\n\n(ii) Resulting from improper packing and marking; or\n\n(iii) Resulting from improper loading, stowing, trimming, blocking, and/or bracing of the shipment, if loaded by the contractor on or in the carrierâ€™s conveyance;\n\n(5) Complete the Government bill of lading supplied by the ordering agency or, when a Government bill of lading is not supplied, prepare a commercial bill of lading or other transportation receipt. The bill of lading shall show-\n\n(i) A description of the shipment in terms of the governing freight classification or tariff (or Government rate tender) under which lowest freight rates are applicable;\n\n(ii) The seals affixed to the conveyance with their serial numbers or other identification;\n\n(iii) Lengths and capacities of cars or trucks ordered and furnished;\n\n(iv) Other pertinent information required to effect prompt delivery to the consignee, including name, delivery address, postal address and ZIP code of consignee, routing, etc.;\n\n(v) Special instructions or annotations requested by the ordering agency for commercial bills of lading; e.g., \"This shipment is the property of, and the freight charges paid to the carrier(s) will be reimbursed by, the Government\" ; and\n\n(vi) The signature of the carrierâ€™s agent and the date the shipment is received by the carrier; and\n\n(6) Distribute the copies of the bill of lading, or other transportation receipts, as directed by the ordering agency.\n\n(c) Contract clause. The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-29, F.o.b. Origin, when the delivery term is f.o.b. origin.\n\n(a) Explanation of delivery term.\"F.o.b. destination\"- means-\n\n(1) Free of expense to the Government delivered, on board the carrierâ€™s conveyance, at a specified delivery point where the consigneeâ€™s facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which shipment can be made) is located; and\n\n(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consigneeâ€™s wharf (if destination is a port city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of the contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or \"constructive placement\" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including \"piggyback\") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for \"heavy or bulky freight.\" When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarder for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.\n\n(b) Contractor responsibilities. The contractor shall-\n\n(1)\n\n(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or\n\n(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;\n\n(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;\n\n(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;\n\n(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;\n\n(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and\n\n(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.\n\n(c) Contract clause. The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-34, F.o.b. Destination, when the delivery term is f.o.b. destination.\n\n(a) If it is advantageous to the Government, the contracting officer may authorize the contractor to ship supplies, which have been acquired f.o.b. origin, to domestic destinations, including DoD air and water terminals by common carriers on commercial bills of lading. Such shipments shall not exceed 150 pounds by commercial air or 1,000 pounds by other commercial carriers and shall not have a security classification.\n\n(b) The contracting officer may authorize the shipments under paragraph (a) of this subsection to be consolidated with the contractorâ€™s own prepaid shipments for delivery to one or more destinations, if all appropriate f.o.b. origin shipments under one or more Government contracts have been consolidated initially. The contractor may be authorized to consolidate less-than-carload or less-than-truckload Government shipments with its own shipments so that the Government can take advantage of lower carload or truckload freight costs. The Government shall assume its pro rata share of the combined shipment cost. Agency transportation personnel shall evaluate overall transportation costs before authorizing any movement to ensure savings to the Government consistent with other contract and traffic management considerations. When consolidation is authorized, a copy of the commercial bill of lading shall be mailed promptly to each consignee.\n\n(c) Shipments under prepaid commercial bills of lading, as authorized in paragraph (a) of this subsection, do not require a contract modification. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the supplies move for the account of, and at the risk of, the Government. The supplies become Government property when loaded on the carrierâ€™s equipment and the contractor has obtained the carrierâ€™s receipt. The contractor pays the transportation charges and is reimbursed by the Government. Loss or damage claims shall be processed in accordance with agency regulations.\n\n(d) The contractorâ€™s invoice for reimbursement by the Government shall show the prepaid transportation charges as agreed (see paragraph (b) of this subsection), as a separate item for each individual shipment. The contractor shall support the transportation charges with a copy of the carrierâ€™s receipted freight bill or other evidence of receipt, except as follows:\n\n(1) A Government agency may determine that receipted freight bills or other evidence of receipt are not required for transportation charges of $100 or less.\n\n(2) A Government agency may pay an invoiced but unsupported transportation charge of $250 or less per transaction (i.e., purchase, invoice, or aggregate billing or payment for multiple purchases), if-\n\n(i) The contractor cannot reasonably provide a receipted freight bill; and\n\n(ii) The agency has determined that the charges are reasonable. Determination of reasonableness may be based on-\n\n(A) Past experience (authenticated transportation charges for similar shipments);\n\n(B) Rate checks;\n\n(C) Copies of previous freight bills submitted by the contractor; or\n\n(D) Other information submitted by the contractor to substantiate the amount claimed.\n\n(3) Receipted freight bills in support of invoiced transportation charges of $100 or less are not required for reimbursement by the Government, if-\n\n(i) The underlying contract specifies retention by the contractor of all records for at least 3 years after final payment under the contract; and\n\n(ii) The contractor agrees to furnish evidence of payment when requested by the Government.\n\n(e) Shipments and invoices shall not be split to reduce transportation charges to $100 or less per transaction as a means of avoiding the required documented support for the charges. See paragraph (d)(2) of this subsection for unsupported transportation charges of $250 or less.\n\n(f) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.247-65, F.o.b. Origin, Prepaid Freight-Small Package Shipments, in solicitations and contracts when f.o.b. origin shipments are to be made.\n\n(a) The contracting officer shall determine f.o.b. terms generally on the basis of overall costs, giving due consideration to the criteria given in 47.304.\n\n(b) Solicitations shall specify whether offerors must submit offers f.o.b. origin, f.o.b. destination, or both; or whether offerors may choose the basis on which they make an offer. The contracting officer shall consider the most advantageous delivery point, such as-\n\n(1) F.o.b. origin, carrierâ€™s equipment, wharf, or specified freight station near contractorâ€™s plant; or\n\n(2) F.o.b. destination.\n\n(c) In determining whether f.o.b. origin or f.o.b. destination is more advantageous to the Government, the contracting officer shall consider the availability of lower freight rates (Government rate tenders) to the Government for f.o.b. origin acquisitions. F.o.b. origin contracts also present other desirable traffic management features, in that they-\n\n(1) Permit use of transit privileges (see 47.305-13);\n\n(2) Permit diversions to new destinations without price adjustment for transportation (see 47.305-11);\n\n(3) Facilitate use of special routings or types of equipment (e.g., circuitous routing or oversize shipments) (see 47.305-14);\n\n(4) Facilitate, if necessary, use of premium cost transportation and permit Government-controlled transportation;\n\n(5) Permit negotiations for reduced freight rates (see 47.104-1(b)); and\n\n(6) Permit use of small shipment consolidation stations.\n\n(d) When destinations are tentative or unknown, the solicitation shall be f.o.b. origin only (see 47.305-5).\n\n(e) When the size or quantity of supplies with confidential or higher security classification requires commercial transportation services, the contracting officer shall generally specify f.o.b. origin acquisitions.\n\n(f) When acceptance must be at destination, solicitation shall be on an f.o.b. destination only basis.\n\n(g) Following are examples of situations when solicitations shall normally be on an f.o.b. destination only basis because it is advantageous to the Government (see 47.305-4):\n\n(1) Bulk supplies, such as coal, that require other than Government-owned or operated handling, storage, and loading facilities, are destined for shipment outside CONUS.\n\n(2) Steel or other bulk construction products are destined for shipment outside CONUS.\n\n(3) Supplies consist of forest products such as lumber.\n\n(4) Perishable or medical supplies are subject to in-transit deterioration.\n\n(5) Evaluation of f.o.b. origin offers is anticipated to result in increased administrative lead time or administrative cost that would outweigh the potential advantages of an f.o.b. origin determination.\n\nWhen preparing f.o.b. origin solicitations, the contracting officer shall refer to 47.303, where f.o.b. origin clauses relating to standard delivery terms are prescribed. Supply solicitations that will or may result in f.o.b. origin contracts shall also contain requirements, information, provisions, and clauses concerning the following items:\n\n(a) Delivery in carload or truckload lots f.o.b. carrierâ€™s equipment, wharf, or freight station.\n\n(b) The requirement that the offeror furnish the following information with the offer:\n\n(1) Location of the offerorâ€™s actual shipping point(s) (street address, city, State, and ZIP code) from which supplies will be delivered to the Government.\n\n(2) Whether the offerorâ€™s shipping point has a private railroad siding, and the name of the rail carrier serving it.\n\n(3) When the offerorâ€™s shipping point does not have a private siding, the names and addresses of the nearest public rail siding and of the carrier serving it. (This will enable transportation officers, when issuing routing instructions, to select the mode of transportation that will provide the required service at the lowest possible overall cost.)\n\n(4)\n\n(i) The quantity of supplies to be shipped from each shipping point.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer shall insert in f.o.b. origin solicitations the provision at 52.247-46, Shipping Point(s) Used in Evaluation of F.o.b. Origin Offers, when price evaluation for shipments from various shipping points is contemplated.\n\n(c) When delivery is \"f.o.b. origin, contractorâ€™s facility,\" and the designated facility is not covered by the line-haul transportation rate, the charges required to deliver the shipment to the point where the line-haul rate is applicable.\n\n(d) When delivery is \"f.o.b. origin, freight allowed,\" the basis on which transportation charges will be allowed, including the origin and destination from and to which transportation charges will be allowed.\n\n(e) If f.o.b. origin offers only are desired, a statement that offers submitted on any other basis will be rejected as nonresponsive.\n\n(f)\n\n(1) The methods of transportation used in evaluating offers. The Government normally uses land transportation by regulated common carriers between points in the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 52.247-47, Evaluation-F.o.b. Origin, in solicitations that require prices f.o.b. origin for the purpose of establishing the basis on which offers will be evaluated.\n\n(g)\n\n(1) When it is believed that prospective contractors are likely to include in f.o.b. origin offers a contingency to compensate for what may be an unfavorable routing condition by the Government at the time of shipment, the contracting officer may permit prospective contractors to state in offers a reimbursable differential that represents the cost of bringing the supplies to any f.o.b. origin place of delivery specified by the Government at the time of shipment (see the clause at 52.247-33, F.o.b. Origin, with Differentials).\n\n(2) Following are situations that might impose on the contractor a substantial cost above \"at plant\" or \"commercial shipping point\" prices because of Government-required routings:\n\n(i) The loading nature of the supplies; e.g., wheeled vehicles.\n\n(ii) The different methods of shipment specified by the Government; e.g., towaway, driveaway, tri-level vehicle, or rail car, that may increase the contractorâ€™s cost in varying amounts for bringing the supplies to, or loading and bracing the supplies at, the specified place of delivery.\n\n(iii) The contractorâ€™s f.o.b. origin shipping point is a port city served by United States inland, coastwise, or intercoastal water transportation, and the contractor would incur additional costs to make delivery f.o.b. a wharf in that city to accommodate water routing specified by the Government.\n\n(iv) The contractorâ€™s plant does not have a private rail siding and in order to ship by Government-specified rail routing, the contractor would be required to deliver the supplies to a public siding or freight terminal and to load, brace, and install dunnage in rail cars.\n\n(a) When supplies are acquired on the basis of the delivery terms in 47.303-8 through 47.303-16, the solicitation shall include a requirement that the offeror furnish the Government the following information:\n\n(1) When the delivery term is \"f.a.s. vessel, port of shipment,\" \"f.o.b. vessel, port of shipment,\" or \"f.o.b. inland carrier, point of exportation,\" the required data shall include-\n\n(i) A delivery schedule in number of units and/or long or short tons;\n\n(ii) Maximum quantities available per shipment;\n\n(iii) The quantity that can be made available for loading to vessel per running day of 24 hours (if acquisition involves a commodity to be shipped in bulk);\n\n(iv) The minimum leadtime required to make supplies available for loading to vessel; and\n\n(v) The port and pier or other designation and, when applicable, the maximum draft of vessel (in feet) that can be accommodated.\n\n(2) When the delivery term is: f.o.b. inland point, country of importation\" or \"f.o.b. designated air carrierâ€™s terminal, point of importation,\" the required data shall include-\n\n(i) A delivery schedule in number of units and/or long or short tons;\n\n(ii) Maximum quantities available per shipment; and\n\n(iii) Other data appropriate to shipment by air carrier.\n\n(3) When the delivery term is \"ex dock, pier or warehouse, port of importation\" or \"c.&f. (cost & freight) destination,\" the required data shall include-\n\n(i) A delivery schedule in number of units and/or long or short tons;\n\n(ii) Maximum quantities available per shipment; and\n\n(iii) The number of containers or units that can be loaded in a car, truck, or other conveyance of the size normally used (specify type and size) for the commodity.\n\n(4) When the delivery term is \"c.i.f. (cost, insurance, freight) destination,\" the required data shall include-\n\n(i) The same as specified in 47.305-6(a)(3); and\n\n(ii) The amount and type of marine insurance coverage; e.g., whether the coverage is \"With Average\" or \"Free of Particular Average\" and whether it covers any special risks or excludes any of the usual risks associated with the specific commodity involved.\n\n(5) When the delivery term is \"f.o.b. designated air carrierâ€™s terminal, point of exportation,\" the required data shall include-\n\n(i) A delivery schedule number of units, type of package, and individual weight and dimensions of each package;\n\n(ii) Minimum leadtime required to make supplies available for loading into aircraft;\n\n(iii) Name of airport and location to which shipment will be delivered; and\n\n(iv) Other data appropriate to shipment by air carrier.\n\n(b) When supplies are acquired for known destinations outside CONUS and originate within CONUS, the contracting officer shall, for transportation evaluation purposes, note in the solicitation the CONUS port of loading or point of exit (aerial or water) and the water port of debarkation that serves the overseas destination.\n\n(c) The contracting officer may also, for evaluation purposes, list in the solicitation other CONUS ports that meet the eligibility criteria compatible with the nature and quantity of the supplies, their destination, type of carrier required, and specified overseas delivery dates. This permits offerors that are geographically remote from the port that normally serves the overseas destination to be competitive as far as transportation costs are concerned.\n\n(d) Unless logistics requirements limit the ports of loading to the ports listed in the solicitation, the solicitation shall state that-\n\n(1) Offerors may nominate additional ports (including ports in Alaska and Hawaii) more favorably located to their shipping points; and\n\n(2) These ports will be considered in the evaluation of offers if they possess all requisite capabilities of the listed ports in relation to the supplies being acquired.\n\n(e) When supplies are to be exported through CONUS ports and offers are solicited on an f.o.b. origin or f.o.b. destination basis, the contracting officer shall insert in solicitations the provision at 52.247-51, Evaluation of Export Offers. The contracting officer shall use the provision with its-\n\n(1) AlternateI, when the CONUS ports of export are DoD water terminals;\n\n(2) AlternateII, when offers are solicited on an f.o. b. origin only basis; or\n\n(3) AlternateIII, when offers are solicited on an f.o.b. destination only basis.\n\n(f)\n\n(1) When the supplies are to move in the Defense Transportation System (DTS) (see 47.301-3), the contract shall specify that-\n\n(i) A Transportation Control Movement Document (TCMD) must be dispatched to the appropriate DoD air or water clearance authority in accordance with DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II, procedures for all shipments consigned to DoD air or water terminal transshipment points; and\n\n(ii) An Export Release must be obtained for supplies to be transshipped via a water port of loading to overseas destinations, except for shipments for which an Export Release is not required, generally shipments of less than 10,000 pounds, (see DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part II).\n\n(2) When shipments will be consigned to DoD air or water terminal transshipment points, the contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-52, Clearance and Documentation Requirements-Shipments to DoD Air or Water Terminal Transshipment Points.\n\n(g) When a contract will not generate any shipments that require an Export Release, only the DoD CONUS ports that serve the overseas destination shall be listed in the solicitation, except that the responsible contracting officer may limit the water ports listed when such limitation is considered necessary to meet delivery or other requirements.\n\n(h) The award shall specify the United States ports of loading that afford the lowest overall cost to the overseas destination.\n\n(i) When supplies will be from origins outside CONUS to destinations either within or outside CONUS, the contracting officer shall use the appropriate f.o.b. term and include evaluation-of-offers information.\n\n(j) In furtherance of the Cargo Preference Act of1954 ( 46 U.S.C.1241(b)), to encourage and foster the American Merchant Marine, the port of delivery of supplies originating outside the United States and shipped by ocean vessel shall be based on the availability of United States-flag vessels between the ports involved, unless the acquiring activity has given other specific instructions. (See subpart 47.5-Ocean Transportation by U.S.-Flag Vessels.)\n\n(k) For application of the Fly America Act to the transportation of supplies and personnel when the Government is responsible for the transportation costs, see subpart 47.4-Air Transportation by U.S.-Flag Carriers.\n\n(l) Military and civilian agencies shall obtain assistance from transportation offices in connection with all export shipments (see 47.105).\n\n(a) Transit privileges.\n\n(1) Transit arrangements permit the stopping of a carload or truckload shipment at a specific intermediate point en route to the final destination for storage, processing, or other purposes, as specified in carrier tariffs or rate tenders. A single through rate is charged from origin to final destination plus a transit or other related charge, rather than a more expensive combination of rates to and from the transit point.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall consider possible benefits available to the Government through the use of existing transit arrangements or through efforts to obtain additional transit privileges from the carriers. Solicitations incorporating transit arrangements shall be restricted to f.o.b. origin offers, as f.o.b. destination offers can only quote fixed overall delivered prices at first destination.\n\n(3)\n\n(i) Traffic management personnel shall furnish information and analyses of situations in which transit arrangements may be beneficial. The quantity to be awarded must be of sufficient tonnage to ensure that carload/truckload shipments can be made by the contractor, and there should be reasonable certainty that shipments out of the transit point will be requested in carload/truckload quantities.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations the provision at 52.247-56, Transit Arrangements, when benefits may accrue to the Government because transit arrangements may apply.\n\n(b) Transit credits.\n\n(1) In evaluations of f.o.b. origin offers for large quantities of supplies that contractors normally have in process or storage at intermediate points, contracting officers shall make use of contractorsâ€™ earned commercial transit credits, which are recorded with the carriers. A transit credit represents the transportation costs for a recorded tonnage from the initial point to an intermediate point. The remaining transportation charges from the intermediate point to the Government destination, because they are based on through rates, are frequently lower than the transportation charges that would apply for the same tonnage if the intermediate point were the initial origin point.\n\n(2) If transit credits apply, the contract shall state that the contractor shall ship the goods on prepaid commercial bills of lading, subject to reimbursement by the Government. The contracting officer shall ensure that this does not preclude a proper change in delivery terms under the Changes clause. The shipments move for the account and at the risk of the Government, as they become Government property at origin.\n\n(3) The contractor shall show the transportation and transit charges as separate amounts on the invoice for each individual shipment. The amount to be reimbursed by the Government shall not exceed the amount quoted in the offer.\n\n(4) The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-57, Transportation Transit Privilege Credits, when supplies are of such a nature, or when it is the custom of the trade, that offerors may have potential transit credits available and the Government may reduce transportation costs through the use of transit credits.\n\n(a) Required shipping weights. The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-59, F.o.b. Origin-Carload and Truckload Shipments, when it is contemplated that they may result in f.o.b. origin contracts with shipments in carloads or truckloads. This will facilitate realistic freight cost evaluations of offers and ensure that contractors produce economical shipments of agreed size.\n\n(b) Guaranteed shipping characteristics.\n\n(1) The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts, excluding those at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, the clause at 52.247-60, Guaranteed Shipping Characteristics, when shipping and other characteristics are required to evaluate offers as to transportation costs. When all of the shipping characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of the clause at 52.247-60 are not required to evaluate offers as to transportation costs, the contracting officer shall delete the characteristics not required from the clause.\n\n(2) The award document shall show the shipping characteristics used in the evaluation.\n\n(c) Minimum size of shipments. When volume rates may apply, the contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-61, F.o.b. Origin-Minimum Size of Shipments.\n\n(d) Specific quantities unknown.\n\n(1) When total requirements and destinations to which shipments will be made are known, but the specific quantity to be shipped to each destination cannot be predetermined, solicitations shall state that offers are to be submitted on the basis of delivery \"f.o.b. origin\" and/or \"f.o.b. destination\" and that offers will be evaluated on both bases.\n\n(2) The contracting officer shall insert in solicitations and contracts the clause at 52.247-62, Specific Quantities Unknown, when total requirements and destinations to which shipments will be made are known, but the specific quantity to be shipped to each destination cannot be predetermined. This clause protects the interests of both the Government and the contractor during the course of the performance of the contract.\n\n(a) If a U.S.-flag air carrier cannot provide the international air transportation needed or if the use of U.S.-flag air carrier service would not accomplish an agencyâ€™s mission, foreign-flag air carrier service may be deemed necessary.\n\n(b) U.S.-flag air carrier service is considered available even though-\n\n(1) Comparable or a different kind of service can be provided at less cost by a foreign-flag air carrier;\n\n(2) Foreign-flag air carrier service is preferred by, or is more convenient for, the agency or traveler; or\n\n(3) Service by a foreign-flag air carrier can be paid for in excess foreign currency (unless U.S.-flag air carriers decline to accept excess or near excess foreign currencies for transportation payable only out of such monies).\n\n(c) Except as provided in paragraph 47.403-1(a), U.S.-flag air carrier service shall be used for U.S. Government-financed commercial foreign air travel if service provided by U.S.-flag air carriers is available. In determining availability of a U.S.-flag air carrier, the following scheduling principles shall be followed unless their application would result in the last or first leg of travel to or from the United States being performed by a foreign-flag air carrier:\n\n(1) U.S.-flag air carrier service available at point of origin shall be used to destination or, in the absence of direct or through service, to the farthest interchange point on a usually traveled route.\n\n(2) When an origin or interchange point is not served by a U.S.-flag air carrier, foreign-flag air carrier service shall be used only to the nearest interchange point on a usually traveled route to connect with U.S.-flag air carrier service.\n\n(3) When a U.S.-flag air carrier involuntarily reroutes the traveler via a foreign-flag air carrier, the foreign-flag air carrier may be used notwithstanding the availability of alternative U.S.-flag air carrier service.\n\n(d) For travel between a gateway airport in the United States and a gateway airport abroad, passenger service by U.S.-flag air carrier shall not be considered available if-\n\n(1) The gateway airport abroad is the travelerâ€™s origin or destination airport and the use of U.S.-flag air carrier service would extend the time in a travel status, including delay at origin and accelerated arrival at destination, by at least 24 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier; or\n\n(2) The gateway airport abroad is an interchange point and the use of U.S.-flag air carrier service would require the traveler to wait 6 hours or more to make connections at that point, or if delayed departure from, or accelerated arrival at, the gateway airport in the United States would extend time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier.\n\n(e) For travel between two points outside the United States, the rules in paragraphs 47.403-1(a), (b), and (c) shall be applicable, but passenger service by a U.S.-flag air carrier shall not be considered to be reasonably available if-\n\n(1) Travel by a foreign-flag air carrier would eliminate two or more aircraft changes en route;\n\n(2) One of the two points abroad is the gateway airport en route to or from the United States and the use of a U.S.-flag air carrier would extend the time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier, including accelerated arrival at the over seas destination or delayed departure from the overseas origin, as well as delay at the gateway airport or other interchange point abroad; or\n\n(3) The travel is not part of the trip to or from the United States and the use of a U.S.-flag air carrier would extend the time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier including delay at origin, delay en route, and accelerated arrival at destination.\n\n(f) For all short-distance travel under either paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) of 47.403-1, U.S. air carrier service shall not be considered available when the elapsed travel time on a scheduled flight from origin to destination airport by foreign-flag air carrier is 3 hours or less and service by a U.S.-flag air carrier would involve twice such travel time."
