Assisted the Portland mineral sands train Fri.14.8 * - Thurs.20.8 GM36-S300 Headed west on the mineral sands train S300 swapped for S302 which arrived light with T386 * - GM36 and S300 headed west with the mineral sands train on Fri.14.8 before assisting a grain service to Mallala and they were shunted off at Diapur overnight on Sun.16.8 to take up the ballast duties. Thurs.20.8 - Thurs.21.10 S302-GM36 S302 swapped for S300 after arriving light engine with T386 S302 returned light engine with T386 Thurs.21.10 - Fri.13.11 C501-GM36 C501 swapped for S302 after arriving light engine with T386 C501 returned light to Maroona with T342\n\nthen hauled rake of empty conflats to Melbourne Fri.13.11 - S302-GM36 S302 swapped for C501 after arriving light engine with T342 Both GM36 and S302 assisted the Portland mineral Sands train, 9768, into Melbourne on the morning of Fri.20.11, but they both returned west later that day on the return mineral sands service, 9767, to remain available for the ballast workings.\n\nThe ballast loading site moved briefly from Wail to Murtoa from Fri.6.11 but has now moved on to Glenorchy since around Mon.16.11. The motive power for this train has reverted back to S302 and GM36 since Fri.13.11 when the S replaced C501 on the down end of the train. - Wed.18.11\n\nLast week (Thurs.22.10), Pacific National transferred one trainset of 50 VHGF hoppers and two XR class locomotives (XR555 and XR559) from New South Wales to Dimboola in preparation for the upcoming harvest, with their main contract with bulk handler GrainCorp. This complements the contracts El Zorro have with AWB Ltd and GWA have with Viterra (formally ABB Ltd) for the movement of export grain to the ports of Melbourne and Geelong, and significantly grain is also scheduled to be exported from Portland in the new year giving rise to the hope of grain trains returning to the Maroon to Portland line for the first time in three or four years. - Tues.27.10\n\nThe trains delivering the new concrete sleepers for the western line resleepering project operate in push pull mode whilst unloading the sleepers, with two 81 class locomotives being the usual combination.\n\nCurrently the most common arrangement is for these trains to run from New South Wales with one locomotive and the second unit is added at Maroona before the train continues to the worksite. On the return trip, the extra unit is shunted off at Maroona to assist the next loaded train. Occasionally a double or triple header is reported through Gheringhap when the extra units need to return for servicing purposes.\n\nThe sleepers are currently being unloaded in the Deep Lead area.\n\nThe exceptions the single or double 81 class combinations are listed below. - Tues.27.10\n\nThurs.23.7 8177-8153-8166 Up Empty (9758) Sat.8.8 T409-8121 Down Loaded (9759) Sat.8.8 8177-8173-T409-8121 Up Empty (9758) Sat.5.9 8171-8173-8153 Up Empty (9758) Thurs.10.9 8173-X46 Down Loaded (9759) Sun.20.9 8177-X46 Up Empty (9758) Locomotive combinations as reported through Gheringhap Loop\n\nThe ballast train has spent the last week operating out of the Wail siding and ballasting towards Horsham. The delivery of the new sleepers has progressed beyond Horsham to the east. and the installation of the new sleepers has reached Horsham. - Fri.2.10\n\nNew concrete sleepers were being unloading at Horsham on Thurs.17.9.. - Fri.18.9\n\nThe worksite for the installation of concrete sleepers on the western line had progressed through Dimboola by Mon.7.9, and the loading of ballast had moved to the siding at Gerang Gerung. - Mon.7.9\n\nThe delivery of new concrete sleepers to locations west of Dimboola continues, with the unloading site having advanced to east of Salisbury Loop by Sat.8.8. The motivepower on this day also included the first appearance of a T class on these services - T409 accompanied 8121 in lieu of the usual second 81 class.\n\nOn Tues.21.7 after the sleeper train had unloaded west of Dimboola, one of the locomotives in the form of 8166 was taken off the train and stabled in the yard at Dimboola before the empty train departed for New South Wales via Melbourne to reload. The plan is that 8166 will be added to the next loaded train upon its arrival at Dimboola the following morning and the train will proceede to the work site in push - pull mode to unload. On its way back the extra locomotive will be stabled at Dimboola in preparation for the cylce to be repeated the next day.\n\nDue to late running of the train on Tues.21.7, 8153 and its empty wagons were stabled at Inverleigh and combined with Wednesday's up empty service which formed the combination of 8177-8153-8166 when it passed through Gheringhap at 04 24 on the morning of Thurs.23.7. - Fri.7.8\n\nThe first week in August saw the motive power off the ballast trains, S311 and T386, return to Melbourne, and the rake of ballast wagons stabeld in the silo siding off Diapur Loop. - Thurs.13.8\n\nThe ballast train is now being hauled by S311 and T386 and is being loaded at the siding at Miram as at Tues.28.7, although this is anticipated to move to Diapur once the stockpile has been exhausted. - Wed.29.7\n\nIt is antcipated that the ballast trains in conjunction with the new concrete sleeper installation in the Miram to Diapur to Salisbury sections west of Dimboola will recommence around the middle of the week starting on the 20th of July, with the ballast loading point moving from Callington in South Australia to Miram or Diapur.\n\nObservations on Sat.18.7 revealed ballast stockpiled beside the siding at Miram.\n\nThe motive power for this next series of shuttles, C501 and T386, was taken off an up loaded El Zorro grain service at Dimboola on the morning of Tues.21.7, although it is still unclear where the ballast wagons are stabled as they were not sighted at Nhill, Diapur, Miram or Kaniva on the weekend. These locos were not present at Dimboola later that evening, so it is assumed that they had already headed west to collect their wagons. - Tues.21.7\n\nLocomotives C501 and 4836 off the El Zorro ballast trains to Western Victoria returned to Melbourne as a light engine movement on Wed.8.7. The location of the rake of ballast hoppers is unknown. - Wed.15.7\n\nBy late June, the El Zorro ballast train was being hauled by 4836 and C501 and was working as far east as the Miram to Diapur section. - Fri.3.7\n\nIn conjuction with the delivery of new concrete sleepers outlined below to far western Victoria, this week sees the start of their installation and a the commencement of a series of ballast trains operating out of Callington west of Murray Bridge in South Australia. El Zorro has the contract to operate these trains and initially C501 and T386 were the motive power.\n\nThe fourth week in May saw C501 and T386 return to Melbourne, via Portland to assist the mineral sands train, before C501 and 4836 in Austrac colours returned west to resume ballast duties.\n\nThese ballast trains are now operating to the east of Kaniva in western Victoria from their loading base at Callington. - Sat.20.6\n\nPacific National Sleeper Train\n\nThe first revenue train since October last year ventured out onto the Yaapeet branch on Thurs.19.3 when G528 hauled 14 empty grain wagons for loading at Rainbow. - Thurs.19.3\n\nThe management of the Maroona to Portland corridor was transferred from V/Line to ARTC on the afternoon of Sun.22.3. - Wed.18.3\n\nA couple of incidents held up an Adelaide bound train at Dooen, east of Horsham, just after midnight on Tuesday night. - Tues.6.1\n\nFire fighters stop chemical explosion on Horsham freight train - [Herald-Sun Online] - [Read Article]\n\nTractor fall damages Melb-Adel rail line - [ABC Online] - [Read Article]\n\nTrain driver averts rail line 'explosion' - [theage.com.au] - [Read Article]\n\nCrews derail blast threat - [Wimmera Mail-Times] - [Read Article]\n\nMajor grain carrying rail lines will be upgraded as part of $38.7 million announced by the Victorian Government today. - Mon.20.10\n\n$38.7 million for Victoria's rail - [Weekly Times On-line - Mon.20.10] - [Read Media Release]\n\nAustralian premier agribusiness, ABB Grain, and rail-freight transportation operator, Genesee & Wyoming Australia, are close to signing a five-year broad gauge agreement to annually move up to 300,000 tonnes of Victorian grain.... - Wed.17.9\n\nABB Grain and Genesee & Wyoming's new rail agreement - [ABB Ltd] - [Read Media Release]\n\nThe first down empty Iluka mineral sands train to Portland was reported through Gheringhap on Sat.13.9 consisting of T386 hauling 21 container flats with three containers on each, although G532 was dropped at Maroona from an up grain train and it is anticipated that this loco will be collected for the sand train.
