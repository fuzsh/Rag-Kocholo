        "text": "The G Class 2-6-0+0-6-2 Garratt, steam locomotives were built in the 1920s for the 2 ft 6in (762mm) narrow gauge branch lines of the Victorian Railways.\n\nHistory[]\n\nTwo of these locomotives were built, at Beyer, Peacock & Co. Ltd. in Manchester, England for the Victorian Railways. No. G41 and G42, thought to help increase train sizes, therefore profit for the Victorian Railways. Built in 1926, the Garratt locos almost had the tractive effort of a K Class, on a narrow gauge line. G41 was put to work on the Colac to Beach Forest and Crowes line in the states (Victoria) south-west. G42 was located on the Moe to Walhalla line in the states south-east. The locos were based on their lines, only coming back to the Victorian Railways Newport Works for heavy repairs. In 1954 the Walhalla line was closed, so G42 was moved to Colac and work along side G41. In 1962 the Colac to Beach Forest and Crowes line, was closed, and G42 was put into storage. Sadly G41 was seen to be not fit for operation and scrapped at the Newport Works. In 1964 G42 was bought by the Puffing Billy Preservation Society and put into the Menzies Creek Railway Museum, which was created in 1968. In 1986 the Puffing Billy Preservation Society started to restore the loco, though G42 had already had some rebuilding since it got to the museum. It was not until 2004 that this restoration was completed. It now hauls special trains on the Puffing Billy Railway, on a semi-regular basis. Its schedule was developed to prolong its service life.\n\nSpecifications[]\n\nThe engine weighs 70 tonnes with an axle load of 9.60 tonnes. The boiler has a maximum pressure of 180 psi, and the locomotive produces 26,860 lbf of tractive effort at 85% boiler pressure. The firebox possesses a greate area of 22.6 square feet (2.1 m^2). The driving wheels are 36 inches (941 mm) in diameter. The locomotive has 4 cylinders that are 13.25 inches in bore by 18 inch stroke (340 x 460 mm)\n\nThe engines have a coal capacity of 3.5 tons of coal and a water capacity of 1680 gallons (7600 litres)\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nPuffing Billy\n\nWikipedia.org\n\nUsers.powernet.co.uk/hamilton"
