The terminology and the actual processing that controls allocations will vary from one software system to another. A standard allocation is an aggregate quantity of demand against a specific item in a specific facility, I have heard standard allocations referred to as normal allocations, soft allocations, soft commitments, regular allocations. Standard allocations do not specify that specific units will go to specific orders. A firm allocation is an allocation against specific units within a facility, such as an allocation against a specific location, lot, or serial number. Firm allocations are also referred to as specific allocations, frozen allocations, hard allocations, hard commitments, holds, reserved inventory. Standard allocations simply show that there is demand while firm allocations reserve or hold the inventory for the specific order designated.\n\nAlongside\n\nA phrase referring to the side of a ship.

Availability calculations are used to determine this status. Availability calculations vary from system to system but basically subtract any current allocations of holds on inventory from the current on-hand balance. An example of an availability calculation would be: [Quantity Available] = [Quantity On Hand] -[ Quantity On Hold] – [Quantity Allocated To Sales Orders] – [Quantity Allocated to Production Orders].\n\nAvailable to promise\n\navailable to promise takes the simple availability calculation, adds time phasing and takes into account future scheduled receipts. Available to promise may be calculated for each day or broken down into larger time buckets. The first time period will take on-hand inventory and add any scheduled receipts for that period. It will then deduct any allocations scheduled prior to the next scheduled receipt (which may be several periods in the future). Subsequent periods without any scheduled receipts will have the same available to promise as the previous period. Subsequent periods with scheduled receipts will generally start with a fresh calculation, ignoring any remaining available to promise from previous periods. There are many variations on exactly how available to promise is calculated and it is also important to note that available to promise often works independently of allocation systems. This can sometimes create conflicts. See also Available, Allocations.\n\nAverage cost\n\nInventory costing method that recalculates an item’s cost at each receipt by averaging the actual cost of the receipt with the cost of the current inventory.\n\nTotal cost, fixed plus variable, divided by total output.\n\nAverage Inventory\n\nThe average inventory level over a period of time.\n\nAverage\n\nSee Marine Cargo Insurance\n\nAvoirdupois Pound\n\nSame as 0.4535924277 kilograms.\n\nAWB\n\nSee Air Waybill\n\nAWWL\n\nAlways within Institute Warranties Limits (Insurance purpose).\n\nD\n\nD&H\n\nAbbreviation for “Dangerous and Hazardous” cargo.\n\nD.B.A\n\nAbbreviation for “Doing Business As.” A legal term for conducting business under a registered name.\n\nD.O.T\n\nDepartment of Transportation.\n\nDangerous Goods\n\nArticles or substances capable of posing a significant risk to health, safety, or property, and that ordinarily require special attention when transported.\n\nSee also Hazardous Goods.\n\nData collection\n\nSee Automated Data Collection (ADC)\n\nDC\n\nDistribution Center\n\nDDC\n\nAbbreviation for “Destination Delivery Charge.” A charge, based on container size, that is applied in many tariffs to cargo.

(Under vessel chartering terms, the amount to be paid if the ship is loading/discharging slower/faster than foreseen.)\n\nDEMURRAGE\n\nA penalty charge against shippers or consignees for delaying the carrier’s equipment beyond the allowed free time. The free time and demurrage charges are set\n\nforth in the charter party or freight tariff.\n\nDensity\n\nThe weight of cargo per cubic foot or other unit.A physical characteristic measuring a commodity’s mass per unit volume or pounds per cubic foot; an\n\nimportant factor in ratemaking, since density affects the utilization of a carrier’s vehicle.\n\nDensity rate\n\nA rate based upon the density and shipment weight.\n\nDependent demand\n\ndemand generated from scheduled production of other items.\n\nDepot, Container\n\nContainer freight station or a designated area where empty containers can be picked up or dropped off.\n\nDeregulation\n\nRevisions or complete elimination of economic regulations controlling transportation.

Actual weight and dim weight are compared, and the larger\n\nweight is used for the freight calculation. Dim weight is calculated by Dim weight= (Length x Width x Height)/194 . All dimensional measurements are in inches.\n\na.k.a. Dim weight\n\nDirect product profitability (DPP)\n\nCalculation of the net profit contribution attributable to a specific product or product line.\n\nDirect ship\n\ndirect shipping and drop shipping are two terms generally used interchangeably. They describe a process whereby three parties interact with the sales\n\ntransaction (the buyer, the seller, and the supplier). The buyer initiates a purchase from the seller, who then arranges with the supplier to ship the product\n\ndirectly to the buyer. The seller does not carry inventory of the product and the supplier does not have any direct communication with the buyer. The buyer\n\npays the seller and the seller pays the supplier. Though both terms (direct ship and drop ship) are generally used to describe the same process, I’ve always\n\nconsidered a small distinction between the two that relates to where you are in the supply chain. To the seller, direct shipping describes both the process and\n\nan inventory/sales strategy, however, the supplier will frequently just use the term “drop ship” to describe the process whereby he is shipping the product to\n\nan address other than that of his customer (the business that is paying him for the product). Sometimes the term drop ship also describes the process of shipping\n\nto any location that is different from the customer’s normal shipping location. This subtle distinction is sometimes evident in the terminology used in software\n\ndocumentation. Direct shipment, Drop shipment.\n\nDirect store delivery (DSD)\n\nA logistics strategy to improve services and lower warehouse inventories.\n\nDISA\n\nData Interchange Standards Association.\n\nDischarge Port\n\nThe name of the port where the cargo is unloaded from the export vessel.

This can also be considered the first discharge port.\n\nDiscrepancy Letter of Credit\n\nWhen documents presented do not conform to the requirements of the letter of credit (L/C), it is referred to as a “discrepancy.” Banks will not process L/C’s\n\nwhich have discrepancies. They will refer the situation back to the buyer and/or seller and await further instructions.\n\nDiscrete manufacturing\n\ndescribes manufacturing of distinct items (items you can easily count, touch, see) such as a pencil, a light bulb, a telephone, a bicycle, a fuel pump, etc.\n\nDiscrete as opposed to Process manufacturing. Also see Process Manufacturing.\n\nDispatching\n\nThe carrier activities involved with controlling equipment; involves arranging for fuel, drivers, crews, equipment, and terminal space.\n\nDisplacement\n\nThe weight, in tons of 2,240 pounds, of the vessel and its contents.

Many DCs also contain specialised handling/storage equipment and IT systems and also serve as warehouses. Also regional DC (or RDC), national DC\n\n(or NDC) and international DC (or IDC).\n\nDistribution Channel Management\n\nThe organizational and pipeline strategy for getting products to customers. Direct channels involve company sales forces, facilities, and/or direct shipments to\n\ncustomers; indirect channels involve the use of wholesalers, distributors, and/or other parties to supply the products to customers.

A blanket purchase order may provide estimated required dates for specific quantities, but actual releases to ship against the\n\nblanked order are triggered by separate requests from the customer to the supplier; the specific quantities and dates of these separate requests (releases) may or\n\nmay not be similar to the estimated dates and quantities. Providing a blanket order to a supplier may reduce lead times and increase on-time shipments from the\n\nsupplier and may provide a greater discount on purchases.\n\nBlanket Rate\n\nA rate applicable to or from a group of points.

This can be particularly\n\nuseful when products are received well in advance of sale or when a portion of the product received may eventually be returned or scrapped (thus preventing paying import\n\nfees on items not sold). Bonded warehouses are licensed by the government. I believe the same concept can also be applied to specially taxed domestic products such as\n\nalcohol and tobacco products.

This would include rail cars, tanker trucks, or silos full of a single material. However, this term can also have a variety of\n\nother definitions based upon the specific industry or facility. For example, a small-parts picking operation may refer to a case storage area as “bulk”, while a case-picking operation may refer\n\nto the full-pallet area as the “bulk area”.\n\nBulk Area\n\nA storage area for large items which at a minimum are most efficiently handled by the palletload.\n\nBulk Cargo\n\nNot in packages or containers; shipped loose in the hold of a ship without mark and count.” Grain, coal and sulfur are usually bulk freight.Goods not in\n\npackages or containers.

The EPC tag itself identifies the\n\nmanufacturer, product, version, and serial number. It’s the serial number that takes EPC to the next level. This is the key to data related to specific\n\nlots/batches as well as potentially tracking the specific unit’s history as it moves through the supply chain. This data is stored somewhere else (the internet\n\nor other network) but a standardized architecture allows you to access the data much like you would access a web page (though this would be happening automatically\n\nbehind the scenes).

These systems usually have extensive set-up options that\n\nallow you to customize their functionality to your specific business needs. Unfortunately, in the real world, ERP systems rarely are sufficient to meet all\n\nbusiness needs and a myriad of other software packages such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Advanced Planning\n\nand Scheduling (APS), Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Transportation Management Systems (TMS) are being sold to make up for these deficiencies.\n\nA cross-functional/regional planning process supporting regional forecasting, distribution planning, operations centers planning, and other planning activities.\n\nERP provides the means to plan, analyze, and monitor the flow of demand/supply alignment and to allocate critical resources to support the business plan.\n\nEntry\n\nCustoms documents required to clear an import shipment for entry into the general commerce of a country.\n\nEntry Form\n\nThe document that must be filed with Customs to obtain the release of imported goods and to allow collection of duties and statistics.

ESFR sprinklers may\n\neliminate the need for in-rack sprinkler systems in many warehouses, thus reducing the cost of installation and, more importantly, the risk of water damage\n\ncaused by damage to in-rack sprinklers. Retrofitting ESFR into older warehouses is not always feasible due to limited water pressure in old systems.\n\nETA\n\nEstimated time of arrival.\n\nEthylene\n\nA gas produced by many fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening and aging processes.\n\nEvent management\n\nsoftware functionality that triggers specific actions based upon the occurrence of a specific event or combination of events.

They show any irregularities in packaging or actual or suspected\n\ndamage to the cargo. Exceptions are then noted on the bill of lading.\n\nException Rate\n\nA deviation from the class rate; changes (exceptions) made to the classification.\n\nExcess Inventory\n\ninventory quantities above a specific need. Some businesses may designate excess inventory as inventory beyond a certain time period of demand.\n\nFor example, any inventory greater than 60 day’s demand. Others may designate it as inventory beyond their current safety stock plus lot size (order quantity).\n\nThe second method assumes you have formulas for adjusting safety stock and lot sizes as demand changes. This method basically calculates how much more inventory\n\nyou have than you would have if you started with nothing and stocked based on current demand and ordering practices.
