        "meta_description": "Abstract. A reduction in anthropogenic methane emissions is vital to limit near-term global warming. A small number of so-called super-emitters is responsible for a disproportionally large fraction of total methane emissions. Since late 2017, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) has been in orbit, providing daily global coverage of methane mixing ratios at a resolution of up to 7Ã5.5âkm2, enabling the detection of these super-emitters. However, TROPOMI produces millions of observations each day, which together with the complexity of the methane data, makes manual inspection infeasible. We have therefore designed a two-step machine learning approach using a convolutional neural network to detect plume-like structures in the methane data and subsequently apply a support vector classifier to distinguish the emission plumes from retrieval artifacts. The models are trained on pre-2021 data and subsequently applied to all 2021 observations. We detect 2974Â plumes in 2021, with a mean estimated source rate of 44âtâhâ1 and 5â95th percentile range of 8â122âtâhâ1. These emissions originate from 94 persistent emission clusters and hundreds of transient sources. Based on bottom-up emission inventories, we find that most detected plumes are related to urban areas and/or landfills (35â%), followed by plumes from gas infrastructure (24â%), oil infrastructure (21â%), and coal mines (20â%). For 12 (clusters of) TROPOMI detections, we tip and cue the targeted observations and analysis of high-resolution satellite instruments to identify the exact sources responsible for these plumes. Using high-resolution observations from GHGSat, PRISMA, and Sentinel-2, we detect and analyze both persistent and transient facility-level emissions underlying the TROPOMI detections. We find emissions from landfills and fossil fuel exploitation facilities, and for the latter, we find up to 10 facilities contributing to one TROPOMI detection. Our automated TROPOMI-based monitoring system in combination with high-resolution satellite data allows for the detection, precise identification, and monitoring of these methane super-emitters, which is essential for mitigating their emissions.",

        "text": "Anthropogenic methane emissions have caused at least 25â% of human-induced global warming (Ocko etÂ al.,Â 2018; IPCC,Â 2021). Methane's atmospheric concentration has increased by a factor ofÂ 2.5 since the pre-industrialized era (Szopa etÂ al.,Â 2021), and the rate of increase has accelerated in recent years (NOAA,Â 2022). Due to its relatively short atmospheric lifetime and large global warming potential (81Â times that of CO2 over a time span of 20Â years (IPCC,Â 2021)), methane has an important role in the rate of climate warming (Nisbet etÂ al.,Â 2020; Ocko etÂ al.,Â 2021; Szopa etÂ al.,Â 2021). Reducing global methane emissions is therefore vital to achieve the goals set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Accords (Nisbet etÂ al.,Â 2020). Since NovemberÂ 2021, over 125Â countries have signed the Global Methane Pledge (European Commission,Â 2021; CCAC,Â 2022) and committed to reducing their methane emissions by 30â% in 2030 compared to 2020Â levels. This could help avoid 0.2ââC of global mean warming by 2050 (CCAC,Â 2022; UNEP and CCAC,Â 2021). In order to reduce global methane emissions fast and effectively during this decade, it is paramount to identify the largest anthropogenic sources of methane and mitigate those. We therefore propose an automated detection and monitoring system using satellite data with machine learning models to detect methane super-emitters.\n\nThe dominant anthropogenic methane emission sources are agriculture (livestock and rice cultivation), oil and gas exploitation, waste management, and coal mining; the exact locations and magnitudes of emissions are still uncertain (Saunois etÂ al.,Â 2020). Large fractions of methane emissions in various sectors could be mitigated using existing technology, with about a quarter of those at no net cost (Nisbet etÂ al.,Â 2020; Ocko etÂ al.,Â 2021; Lauvaux etÂ al.,Â 2022). Moreover, a small number of emitters is responsible for a disproportionally large fraction of total anthropogenic emissions (Zavala-Araiza etÂ al.,Â 2015; Jacob etÂ al.,Â 2016). These concentrated point sources are often referred to as âsuper-emittersâ and are difficult to account for in global bottom-up inventories (Zavala-Araiza etÂ al.,Â 2015), as they are often caused by severe malfunctioning or abnormal operating conditions, e.g.,Â dysfunctional natural gas flaring systems (Irakulis-Loitxate etÂ al.,Â 2022a, b; Plant etÂ al.,Â 2022). Super-emitters are not limited to oil and gas production and also occur in the coal mining and waste sectors (Cusworth etÂ al.,Â 2020; Sadavarte etÂ al.,Â 2021; Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022b). Detection, localization, and global monitoring of these methane super-emitters provides a large opportunity to reduce emissions (UNEP and CCAC,Â 2021; Parry etÂ al.,Â 2022).\n\nOne way to obtain more insight with respect to where super-emitters occur is to perform measurements on the ground, with drones, or with aircraft campaigns. Several regions with known frequent and large methane emissions have been mapped in detail with aircraft campaigns (e.g.,Â Frankenberg etÂ al.,Â 2016; Duren etÂ al.,Â 2019; Yu etÂ al.,Â 2022; Plant etÂ al.,Â 2022). While ground-based or airborne measurements are limited in spatial and temporal coverage, satellite observations have the potential for global monitoring of methane point sources with frequent revisits (Jacob etÂ al.,Â 2016; Cusworth etÂ al.,Â 2019; Jacob etÂ al.,Â 2022). The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) (Veefkind etÂ al.,Â 2012) was launched in 2017 and observes atmospheric dry-air methane column mixing ratios XCH4 with a pixel size down to 7âkmâÃâ5.5âkm and daily global coverage (Hu etÂ al.,Â 2018; Lorente etÂ al.,Â 2021), resulting in a point source detection limit down to â¼5âtâhâ1 under favorable conditions (Jacob etÂ al.,Â 2016). TROPOMI data have been used to quantify global- (Qu etÂ al.,Â 2021) and country-level (Chen etÂ al.,Â 2022) distributions of methane emissions and large area sources, such as oil and gas basins like the Permian Basin (Zhang etÂ al.,Â 2020; deÂ Gouw etÂ al.,Â 2020; Schneising etÂ al.,Â 2020; Shen etÂ al.,Â 2022). Lauvaux etÂ al. (2022) performed a study into oil- and gas-related methane super-emitters using TROPOMI data. Several individual super-emitters have been studied in detail using TROPOMI XCH4 data, includingÂ natural gas well blowouts (Pandey etÂ al.,Â 2019; Cusworth etÂ al.,Â 2021; Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022a) and various persistent sources (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2019; Sadavarte etÂ al.,Â 2021; Tu etÂ al.,Â 2022a, b).\n\nDownload\n\nGiven the intermediate spatial resolution of TROPOMI, it can only be used to pinpoint the sources of emissions from the largest and most isolated point sources. For more challenging sources, high-resolution instruments are more suitable to detect and identify the exact location of super-emitters. So far, the only in-orbit satellite instruments specifically designed to do so are the GHGSat instruments that have a spatial resolution of â¼25âmâÃââ¼25âm over targeted â¼15âkmâÃââ¼10âkm scenes (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2019; Jervis etÂ al.,Â 2021; Ramier etÂ al.,Â 2020; MacLean etÂ al.,Â 2021). More recently, it was shown that several Earth surface imagers with spectral sensitivity in the short-wave infrared (SWIR), although not designed for this purpose, can detect signals from methane super-emitters under favorable conditions. As such, the hyperspectral PRISMA instrument (Cogliati etÂ al.,Â 2021) was used to retrieve atmospheric methane plumes related to fossil fuel exploitation, using targeted scenes of 30âkmâÃâ30âkm at a spatial resolution of 30âmâÃâ30âm (Guanter etÂ al.,Â 2021; Cusworth etÂ al.,Â 2021). Varon etÂ al. (2021) demonstrated that the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), a band-imaging instrument on board the Sentinel-2 satellite (Drusch etÂ al.,Â 2012), is capable of retrieving large methane plumes with a pixel resolution of 20âmâÃâ20âm for continuous, 290âkm wide swaths over favorable terrain. TROPOMI's daily global coverage is particularly well suited to guide observations of these high-resolution instruments that often have limited viewing domains and to identify large sources of methane at the facility level (Irakulis-Loitxate etÂ al.,Â 2022b; Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022b).\n\nTROPOMI has collected over 5Â years of methane data, which include numerous methane emission plume signals that cannot feasibly be identified manually. To monitor the growing volume of data for super-emitters, an automated approach is needed. The vast amount of data provides an opportunity for machine learning techniques that require a substantial amount of representative training data. Applications of machine learning in satellite remote sensing have mostly focused on studying the Earth's surface and also include monitoring anomalous atmospheric conditions to identify plume signatures in large datasets (Valade etÂ al.,Â 2019; Finch etÂ al.,Â 2022). Detecting methane plumes in TROPOMI data is particularly challenging because not every retrieved methane enhancement is a genuine methane emission plume, as retrieval artifacts and natural variability can seem like methane plumes. We therefore use a two-step machine learning method to identify methane emission plumes. We first use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect plume-like structures in TROPOMI XCH4 data and then use a support vector classifier (SVC) to evaluate these potential plumes using additional information to distinguish real plumes from artifacts. We train the machine learning models on verified TROPOMI methane plumes from 2018â2020 and then apply the trained models to 2021 data. Based on the 2021 detections, we use observations of three high-resolution satellite instruments (GHGSat-Cx, PRISMA, and Sentinel-2) to determine the origin of the emissions down to the facility level. The combination of the automated global monitoring based on TROPOMI with the high resolution of the targeted instruments allows the detection and characterization of super-emitters around the world.\n\nWe use two machine learning models in sequence to detect plumes in the TROPOMI methane data. First, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect plume-like structures in the TROPOMI atmospheric dry-air methane column mixing ratios XCH4 , and then we use additional atmospheric parameters and supporting data to further distinguish between genuine methane plumes and retrieval artifacts using a second machine learning model.\n\nFigureÂ 1 illustrates the full machine learning pipeline and training process. SectionÂ 2.1 describes the pre-processing step to generate scenes used by the CNN and the feature engineering algorithms. SectionÂ 2.2 describes the training process of the CNN (Fig.Â 1, CNN training). SectionÂ 2.3 describes the feature engineering algorithms, which are used to generate feature vectors for each TROPOMI scene. The SVC uses those feature vectors during its training process (Fig.Â 1, SVC training), covered in Sect.Â 2.4. Then, we apply the full, trained, machine learning pipeline to 2021 TROPOMI observations that the models have not been trained on (Fig.Â 1, CNNâ+âSVC application). Based on the resulting TROPOMI detections, we perform further analysis (Sect.Â 2.5) and use (targeted) high-resolution methane observations (Sect.Â 2.6) to pinpoint the responsible sources for 12Â of those detections.\n\n2.1âTROPOMI\n\nWe use data over land from the TROPOMI XCH4 LevelÂ 2 scientific data product versionÂ 18_17. This product version is consistent with operational versionÂ 02.03.01 (Lorente etÂ al.,Â 2021; Hasekamp etÂ al.,Â 2022) but re-processed for the full time span of the mission resulting in a homogeneous data product (SRON CH4Â L2 team,Â 2022). We use albedoâbias-corrected data with a quality assurance value (QA)â¥0.4, methane precisionâ<â10âppb, SWIR aerosol optical depthâ<â0.13, near-infrared (NIR) aerosol optical depthâ<â0.30, SWIR surface albedoâ>â0.02, mixed albedo (2.4ââ âNIR surface albedoâââ1.13ââ âSWIR surface albedo)â<â0.95, and SWIR cloud fractionâ<â0.02. The loosened filtering compared to the recommended QA=1 filter provides more coverage but also retains more biased retrievals, especially at the borders of clouds or along coasts. The methane data are destriped, following the approach introduced by Borsdorff etÂ al. (2018).\n\nTo train a machine learning model to recognize methane plumes in TROPOMI data, we created a dataset of scenes consisting of 32Ã32 pixels, both with and without methane plumes. The 32Ã32 pixels correspond roughly to an area of â¼176Ã232 âkm2 at nadir and up to â¼176Ã448 âkm2 for larger viewing angles. For scenes with plumes, we use data over 60Â persistently emitting locations identified using long-term wind-rotated averages (Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022b). By manual inspection, we compile a dataset of 828Â positive scenes from 2018â2020 with plumes, of which 195Â originate from coal mines, 203Â from landfills/urban areas, and 430Â from oil and gas infrastructure (Fig.Â 1, CNN training). An example scene is shown in Fig.Â 2a, including the local wind field at the time of observation.\n\nA set of (negative) scenes without an emission signal was obtained through a manual inspection of six full orbits in different sections of the orbital repeat cycle, covering a diverse set of surfaces and (meteorological) conditions. We obtain 32Ã32 pixel scenes using a moving window algorithm with 50â% overlap, resulting in a dataset of 2242Â scenes without a plume signal. The moving window algorithm later ensures that if a plume is cut in half in a particular scene, then it will be at the center of the adjacent â and partially overlapping â scene. Scenes with <20â% valid XCH4 pixels are discarded. This processing is applied to full orbits; the scenes with plumes originating from known locations were processed to match the same format. When combined, the dataset contains 3070Â scenes used for training. The difference in the number of positiveÂ (828) and negativeÂ (2242) scenes is corrected for later on, using class weights. For each scene, we store 46Â other channels of supporting information from the same TROPOMI LevelÂ 2 methane data product, including co-retrieved atmospheric properties, meteorological parameters, and geometric properties. These channels are used in later steps of the machine learning pipeline.\n\nIn order to correct for differences in local background concentrations (e.g.,Â due to difference in latitude or surface altitude), each scene is normalized fromÂ 0 toÂ 1. Values below the mean methane concentration of the scene minus 1 standard deviation are set toÂ 0. Values above the mean plus 100âppb minus 1 standard deviation are set toÂ 1, and values in between are linearly distributed. Filtered pixels are set toÂ 0. This pre-processing preserves the information of plume-like enhancements above the local background. Examples of the normalization input and output are shown, respectively, in Fig.Â 2b andÂ c.\n\n2.2âConvolutional neural network (CNN)\n\nWe use a convolutional neural network (LeCun etÂ al.,Â 2010) to detect methane plumes in the TROPOMI methane data that have been split into 32Ã32 pixel scenes. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of machine learning model commonly applied in image recognition and object detection problems (Cheng etÂ al.,Â 2020). A CNN consists of multiple layers, where information moves from an input image, through the layers of the CNN at an increasingly abstract coarse resolution to the output, which is the classification of the image. To condense the information of the image to coarser resolution, the CNN uses âconvolutional blocksâ that consist of two or more convolutional layers, followed by a (max-) pooling layer. A convolutional layer produces âfeature mapsâ that indicate where certain features (e.g.,Â curves, edges, or more abstract features) are detected within the image. These feature maps are obtained by convoluting the input image with a convolutional kernel, which is a small matrix with weights that are optimized during training to best detect the features relevant to the particular classification problem. The resulting feature maps (one for each kernel applied) are then the input for the next layer (LeCun etÂ al.,Â 2010; Cheng etÂ al.,Â 2020). A max-pooling layer scans the previous layer with a 2Ã2 kernel and returns the maximum value, thereby creating a feature map at half the resolution that is focused on dominant features (LeCun etÂ al.,Â 2010). After the last convolutional block, the resulting feature maps are flattened and interpreted by one or more fully connected (dense) layers, consisting of neurons, between which the connections have trainable weights. This part of the network aggregates the information into a single output value. During training, the trainable weights, in the convolutional kernels and dense layers, are optimized to best perform the classification task, based on the training dataset (LeCun etÂ al.,Â 2010; Cheng etÂ al.,Â 2020). The trained CNN can then be used to classify new images, which are in this case labeled as âplumeâ versus âno-plumeâ images.\n\nThe main advantages of the CNN compared to regular neural networks or other machine learning models are that (1)Â the CNN is capable of better retaining spatial information which is lost in fully connected networks or machine learning models like decision trees or support vector machines (Selvaraju etÂ al.,Â 2020); (2)Â the training of a CNN can be done with image-level labels (plume or no plume), and there is no need to indicate where the feature of interest is located within the image, as the CNN learns to localize these features during training; (3)Â the same convolutional kernels are convoluted with the entire image, which is more computationally efficient compared to fully connected networks (LeCun etÂ al.,Â 2010; Cheng etÂ al.,Â 2020); and (4)Â the model is rotationally and translationally invariant when properly trained (LeCun etÂ al.,Â 2010).\n\nThis last model property is essential for the automated detection of plumes, as a plume can be located anywhere within a scene, and the wind can be in any direction. The CNN's output is a prediction betweenÂ 0 andÂ 1, indicating the confidence of the model about the presence of a plume-like structure. Scenes with prediction scoresâ>â0.5 are classified as plumes. Although we use this output for binary classification, the value holds additional information regarding the confidence of the CNN (i.e.,Â 0.6 versusÂ 0.98), which we use for the second model.\n\nWe first select a high-level architecture for the CNN with standard hyperparameters, which we later optimize. Hyperparameters are model settings, separate from the trainable weights, such as the number of convolutional layers and kernel sizes and also parameters that influence the training process, such as the learning rate. As high-level architecture we selected two convolutional blocks followed by two fully connected layers and an output neuron (Fig.Â 3). We found that deeper networks (e.g.,Â ResNet, He etÂ al.,Â 2016, or VGG-16, Simonyan and Zisserman,Â 2014) did not yield an improvement in performance for this problem with relatively low-resolution, small-sized (32Ã32 pixel) scenes.\n\nDownload\n\nOur training dataset mostly contains clear positivesÂ (828) and clear negativesÂ (2242) to effectively learn the distinguishing features. Our dataset has many more negative than positive scenes. When training our CNN, however, we want both categories of training samples (classes) to have equal impact in order to obtain optimal performance (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar,Â 2019). This balancing can be achieved by applying class weights during training (Johnson and Khoshgoftaar,Â 2019), giving positive scenes more weight. We set the class weight parameter to the inverse of the ratio between the number of positives and negatives. We randomly split the data into a training (80â%) and test (20â%) set. Then, 20â% of the training scenes are used as validation subset (TableÂ A1). The validation dataset is used to infer whether there is a generalized performance increase during the training of the CNN to prevent overfitting. We then augment the data in order to obtain larger training and test sets; all scenes are rotated 90â thrice and flipped, thus enlarging the datasets by a factorÂ 8.\n\nWe use the training dataset of 19â648Â (augmented) scenes (TableÂ A1) to train the CNN (Fig.Â 1, CNN training). The CNN was designed and trained using the machine learning framework Keras (Chollet etÂ al.,Â 2015; Chollet,Â 2021) by first using the default values for the hyperparameters. The model is trained for a maximum of 100Â epochs (iterations of the training process). During training, we optimize the validation loss, which measures the error made on the subset of the training data not used in that epoch. We use binary cross-entropy as the loss function and Adam (an improved version of stochastic gradient descend algorithm; Kingma and Ba,Â 2014) as the optimizer. We use a 0.4Â dropout layer (randomly disabling 40â% of the neurons) in the first fully connected layer during training to prevent overfitting and make the model more robust (Srivastava etÂ al.,Â 2014). The activation function modifies the output before it is passed to the next layer; we apply the ReLU (rectified linear unit, which outputs zero when the input is negative and otherwise outputs the input value) activation function in all layers, except for the final layer where we apply sigmoid (11+e-x ), which normalizes the output. To force the model to focus more on plume-like signatures during training, the loss weight of plume scenes is set to double that of the negatives scenes. Training is halted after the validation loss does not improve for several epochs, and the best model weights found up to that point are used. After training, the model performance is inferred by classifying the labeled test dataset.\n\nAfter training this initial âdefaultâ model version, the hyperparameters were further optimized using the KerasTuner optimization framework (O'Malley etÂ al.,Â 2019) and Hyperband (Li etÂ al.,Â 2018). With these methods, we perform a grid search to find the best hyperparameters for our particular problem. The optimal hyperparameters depend on the size of the training dataset, architecture of the CNN, number of classes, and problem type. The search space for the optimization was defined using insights from the initial training, theoretical foundation, and design constraints. We inspected the hyperparameters of the topÂ 10 performing setups and selected the optimal hyperparameters by combining the results of this optimization with expert judgment on this particular problem. FigureÂ 3 shows a schematic overview of the CNN with optimized hyperparameters.\n\nWe evaluate the performance of the CNN using performance evaluation metrics (Eq.Â 1) calculated from the number of true positives and negatives (TPs and TNs), and false positives and negatives (FPs and FNs; Johnson and Khoshgoftaar,Â 2019). Cohen's Îº score (Cohen,Â 1960) is a weighted accuracy which takes into account the class imbalances and chance agreement. The recall indicates which fraction of plumes present in the test set is correctly identified, and the precision indicates which fraction of scenes identified as plumes is actually a plume; the F1Â score incorporates both into a single metric.\n\n(1) Accuracy = TP + TN TP + TN + FP + FN Precision = TP TP + FP Recall = TP TP + FN F 1 = 2 â precision Ã recall precision + recall\n\nDownload\n\nTo test the influence of the split of the training and test datasets (which can be an issue for datasets of a limited size), the training of the model with optimized hyperparameters was repeated 50 times with different splits. We found that model performance is relatively insensitive to different training splits, with Îº=0.943Â±0.012 , recallâ=â0.956Â±0.014, and F1â=â0.958Â±0.009 (standard deviations). We further found that small changes in the hyperparameters have an even lower effect when compared to different training splits. The consistent performance on the corresponding test datasets shows that the model is robust and well generalized. We focus on recall over precision because the key focus is to have as few potential plumes as possible go undetected. We selected the model which scored best on Îº, second best on F1Â score, and third best on recall. The performance metrics of the selected CNN are shown in Fig.Â 4a. Manual inspection of the misclassified scenes (30Â FNs and 37Â FPs out of 4912Â augmented test scenes) indicates that these are borderline cases with difficult-to-discern morphological structures that are even challenging to a human expert.\n\nThe trained CNN is applied to all 2020 data. Processing of the 5193Â orbits of 2020 resulted in 752â890Â scenes (only taking into account scenes with >20â% valid pixels), of which 25â626Â scenes (3.4â%) are identified as containing plume-like morphological structures by the CNN. This number does include artifacts and duplicates, due to the moving window algorithm, as these are filtered later on. We use a subset of these scenes to train the second step of the machine learning pipeline (Sect.Â 2.4).\n\n2.3âFeature engineering\n\nDue to the difficult nature of methane retrievals, not every plume-like morphological structure in the XCH4 field is an actual methane plume. Different types of surface variability and atmospheric or meteorological conditions are known to affect the retrieval (Lorente etÂ al.,Â 2021); if there is a strong correlation between the methane enhancement and retrieval parameters, e.g.,Â the surface albedo or the aerosol scattering coefficient, then the retrieved methane enhancement might be caused by the albedo or aerosol variation and could therefore be a retrieval artifact. Other common examples of artifacts are those on the borders of clouds and coastlines or when the direction of the enhanced structure is not in agreement with the wind field but with surface structures instead.\n\nIn order to automate the necessary further inspection, we compute numerical values for several features of potential plumes through feature engineering. Feature engineering is a commonly applied approach in machine learning problems and is especially helpful when limited amounts of labeled training data are available. These features are a representation of the information that a human expert would use to inspect the potential plumes in order to determine whether a scene contains a genuine plume or an artifact. We construct feature vectors consisting of features based on the corresponding scene. These vectors are then used to train the second model of the machine learning pipeline, which is the SVC (Fig.Â 1, SVC training). An overview of all the developed features is presented in TableÂ C1.\n\nFundamental to many of those features is masking the plume in order to isolate the plume pixels from the background. For this purpose, we use information about which part of the scene has triggered the CNN detection. For this, we use the class activation map (CAM) to visualize the localized activations of a CNN corresponding to a certain class on which it was trained (Zhou etÂ al.,Â 2015). We apply Grad-CAM (Selvaraju etÂ al.,Â 2020), which allows the computation of the CAM for our CNN that includes fully connected layers. In our binary classification problem, the CAM visualizes which regions of the deepest (coarsest) feature maps (max poolingÂ 2 (8Ã8) in Fig.Â 3) contribute strongest to an activation of the plume class (outputâ>â0.5) for a given input image. This spatial activation is calculated using the gradients (Selvaraju etÂ al.,Â 2020) between the 64Â feature maps (each of 8Ã8 resolution, resulting in a 64Ã8Ã8 array; Fig.Â 3) of the deepest max-pooling layer (max poolingÂ 2) and the first fully connected or dense layer (denseÂ 1 in Fig.Â 3). In order to obtain a CAM with a sufficient resolution, we limit the depth of the CNN to two convolutional blocks. The CAM is upsampled to match the input resolution (Selvaraju etÂ al.,Â 2020). FigureÂ 5b shows that the CAM correctly identified the plume-like structure in the XCH4 scene in Fig.Â 5a, thus disregarding the noisy high-enhancement pixels elsewhere in the scene.\n\nDownload\n\nIn addition to using the CAM to analyze CNN performance, we also use it to generate a binary plume mask. We multiply the CAM with the enhancement above the mean XCH4 value minus the scene's standard deviation. The output is a map highlighting pixels with high methane enhancements that are identified as part of the plume by the CNN; we identify the pixel with the maximum value as the starting point for the plume mask. To compute a âhigh-confidenceâ plume mask, we start from the corresponding pixel in the XCH4 image and dilate outwards (including diagonally). We only add adjacent pixels with enhancements of 1.8Â standard deviations above the mean (Fig.Â 5c). We repeat this process with a lower threshold of 0.8Â standard deviations to also obtain a âlow-confidenceâ mask; both thresholds were established empirically. This approach ensures that noise in other parts of the image is excluded from the plume mask. A plume mask can consist of any number of pixels, depending on the scene. The minimum is 1Â pixel, but this is rare, as the average is around 20Â pixels. Several statistics of the (potential) plume can be computed using these masks with supporting data.\n\nOne of the major indicators of an artifact is a strong correlation with one or more retrieval parameters. If an enhancement in the XCH4 field is caused by a surface (albedo) feature or by (enhanced) scattering in the atmosphere which is represented by the aerosol optical thickness, then we expect their spatial patterns to be similar. Therefore, we calculate the correlation between XCH4 and the surface albedo (SWIR), aerosol optical thickness, Ï2 (an indicator for retrieval fit quality), and surface pressure across the plume mask. We calculate these correlations for the high- and low-confidence plume masks, 1-Â and 2-times dilated versions of the low-confidence mask, and the entire scene. We account for pixels outside of the plume mask, as we would expect a strong correlation around the enhancement if it is an artifact. The correlations over the entire scene reflect large-scale patterns that do not necessarily imply artifacts.\n\nAnother major indicator for artifacts is a mismatch between the direction of the plume and the direction of the local 10âm wind field from the ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach etÂ al.,Â 2020) included in the TROPOMI LevelÂ 2 data product (Hasekamp etÂ al.,Â 2022). By applying a principle component analysis (PCA), we compute the two main axes of the pixels in the high-confidence plume mask, after re-projecting the pixel centers to meter space and weighting them by their enhancement relative to the background. We use the ratio of the variances described by the axes as a measure of the plume's elongation. For elongated plumes (e.g.,Â Fig.Â 5), the variance of the primary axis is much larger than the variance projected to the secondary axis, while for less elongated, blob-like plumes, this ratio is small. Furthermore, we compare the angle of the primary axis of the potential plume to the angle of the wind direction (averaged across the plume mask); the smaller the difference, the more confidence we have in the plume following the wind. We also use the wind field to identify the pixel that most likely contains the plume's source by taking the most upwind pixel within the high-confidence plume mask (Fig.Â 5c).\n\n2.4âSupport vector classifier (SVC)\n\nA support vector classifier (SVC) constructs hyperplanes as the optimal decision boundary to separate multiple classes in a high-dimensional feature space. SVCs in general perform better with datasets of limited size compared to deep learning algorithms and are in general less prone to erroneous influence from outliers. We use 843Â labeled scenes from 2020 classified by the CNN to contain plume-like structures as a training dataset for the SVC (Fig.Â 1, SVC training). About half of the scenes are randomly selected from within seven geographical zones with specific types of predominant artifacts, and the other half is selected randomly. Scenes are labeled as âplumeâ (444Â scenes), âartifactâ (341Â scenes), or âemptyâ (58Â scenes, indicating there is not a clear plume or artifact). We have only included scenes with unambiguous labels. The fact that there are relatively few empty scenes in this subset indicates that the CNN performs well. We use balanced class weights to correct the imbalance in the number of training samples per class, and the weights are inversely proportional to the number of scenes in each class.\n\nThe data format we use for the SVC is a vector of 41 features, and each feature vector corresponds to a 32Ã32 pixel scene. This feature vector includes correlations with retrieval parameters for different plume masks, the angle between the wind and elongated direction of the plume, the elongation ratio of the plume, several intermediate outputs of the source rate estimate (Sect.Â 2.5.1), and several statistical properties (all engineered features are listed in TableÂ C1). We do not include features such as latitude and longitude or distance to a known source or known infrastructure in order to be unbiased with respect to where a scene is located. We train the SVC to find the optimal classification boundary within this 41Â dimensional space, based on the 843Â labeled feature vectors. Each feature is standardized by subtracting the mean and scaling the value to the unit variance of that feature in the entire training set. We use a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and set the regularization parameter toÂ 1.2; this hyperparameter was optimized using a simple grid search optimization. The gamma value is scaled inversely to the number of features (41Â in this case) multiplied with the variance of the training dataset, as is common practice, and helps to homogenize the features which have different units and ranges of values (TableÂ C1).\n\nWe randomly split the labeled dataset into a training set (80â%) and a test set (20â%). Contrary to the CNN, when training an SVC, no validation set is used. Correctly detecting plumes is of predominant interest; therefore, we combine non-plume scenes (artifact and empty classes) when evaluating the performance. We train the model 2000Â times for different splits of the dataset. The distribution of these different realizations shows convergence with binary Îº=0.78Â±0.04 and recallâ=â0.88Â±0.03 (standard deviations), indicating that the model setup is not too dependent on the data split. We select a model with relatively high Îº and recall, where performance is similar between the training and test sets. FigureÂ 4b shows the three class performances on the test set, indicating that distinguishing between plumes and artifacts is the most challenging distinction for the SVC. The binary Cohen's Îº score of the selected model isÂ 0.83. A Îº score of aboveÂ 0.8 is generally seen as being a good classification performance. The recall isÂ 0.93, meaning that 93â% of the scenes with plumes which were present in the test set are successfully identified, and only 7â% of the plumes are missed.\n\nTo evaluate which features are important for the SVC to classify a scene, we performed a permutation importance analysis perturbing each feature 40Â times (Breiman,Â 2001). Based on the resulting mean feature importance, the most important features are the correlation of XCH4 with Ï2, the CNN score, the albedo correlation, the enhancement of the plume, the fraction of valid pixels, the angle with the local wind, and the average quality flag of plume pixels (the topÂ 10 ranking of feature importance metrics is presented in TableÂ C1). These correspond to what is important to a human expert labeler.\n\n2.5âPlume characterization\n\n2.5.1âSource rate quantification\n\nTo estimate the source rates of the plumes observed by TROPOMI, we apply the integrated mass enhancement (IME) method (Frankenberg etÂ al.,Â 2016; Varon etÂ al.,Â 2018). Some intermediate outputs of the IME method (such as the plume length) are used as features in the feature vector for the SVC (Sect.Â 2.4). We perform a full source rate quantification, including uncertainty estimates, for the plumes that pass the machine learning pipeline and are manually verified. The IME method relates the emission rate (Q) to the observed methane enhancement in the plume (IME) and the local wind field as follows (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2018):\n\n(2) Q = 1 Ï IME = U eff L IME IME = â j = 1 N Î Î© j A j ,\n\nwhere ÎÎ©j denotes the methane column mass enhancement above the local background of pixel j, with the footprint Aj. The local background is calculated as the median value of the scene's pixels outside the high-confidence plume mask. The IME of all N pixels in the plume is related to the source rate, using the average residence time Ï of methane particles in the plume, with Ï being given by the ratio between the plume length L and the effective wind speed Ueff. The plume length L is approximated as L=AM , where AM is the area of the plume mask (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2018). Ueff can be expressed as a function of the local (reanalysis) wind speed. Frankenberg etÂ al. (2016) and Varon etÂ al. (2018) developed the IME method for high-resolution instruments, for which the 10âm winds are most representative of Ueff values. For the larger scale of TROPOMI plumes, both 10âm (U10) and boundary layer average (UPBL) winds have been used (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2019; Schneising etÂ al.,Â 2020; Cusworth etÂ al.,Â 2021; Tu etÂ al.,Â 2022a). As the most representative wind can vary from case to case, we use the mean of the quantifications using ERA5 10âm winds (Hersbach etÂ al.,Â 2020), GEOSÂ FP 10âm winds, and GEOSÂ FP planetary boundary layer (PBL) winds (Molod etÂ al.,Â 2012).\n\nWe calibrate the relation between Ueff and these local wind speeds by quantifying 15â336Â plumes simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with a Chemistry module (WRF-Chem), versionÂ 4.1.5 (Skamarock etÂ al.,Â 2019; Grell etÂ al.,Â 2005). The model uses 38Â vertical levels and three nested domains at a horizontal resolution of up to 4Ã4âkm2. Physical parameterizations and meteorological initial and boundary conditions are as described in Dekker etÂ al. (2017). We release passive tracers with emission rates mostly between 10â100âtâhâ1 at various locations in western Asia, Mexico, and Argentina for JuneâSeptemberÂ 2019 and 2020. We sample the plume at the TROPOMI overpass time and quantify them as described above.\n\nUsing the model wind speeds and known emission rates, we find that Ueff's dependence on the PBL wind is best described by a linear relationship, where Ueff=Î±1â UPBL+Î±2 , with Î±1=0.47 and Î±2=0.31 (r2=0.78). For the dependence on U10, we also find a linear relation to be optimal and constrain Î±2 to be non-negative, where Ueff=Î±1â U10+Î±2 , with Î±1=0.59 and Î±2=0.00 (r2=0.77). We use the mean of the three resulting Ueff values to quantify emissions.\n\nTo estimate the uncertainty, we create an ensemble of estimates by varying the parameters influencing the quantification. For each of the different input wind speeds, we vary the threshold for masking the plume from 1.3Â to 2.3Â standard deviations (stepÂ 0.1), adjust the background concentration by Â±2 times the mean XCH4 uncertainty in the scene (stepÂ 0.4), vary the wind values from â50â% to +50â% (step 10â%), and vary Î±1 and Î±2 for â5â% to 5â% (step 1â%). We report the standard deviation of the resulting 43â923Â member ensembles as being the uncertainty for each plume.\n\n2.5.2âRemoval of duplicate scenes\n\nDue to the moving window algorithm, each group of 16Ã16 pixels is seen by the machine learning pipeline up to four times as a different corner of a 50â% overlapping 32Ã32 pixel scene. This ensures that the plumes do not go undetected because they are cut in half and allows multiple nearby plumes to be detected in adjacent scenes but also leads to duplicate detections. Therefore, plumes for which the generated plume mask overlaps with a plume mask from another scene are grouped into a group. For each group, the scene with the highest IME value is selected.\n\n2.5.3âAnthropogenic source sector estimation\n\nTo assess which anthropogenic activity might underlie a detected plume, we use the estimated source location to find the local dominant source type in gridded bottom-up inventories. We exclude sectors that are unlikely to produce point source emission signals in single overpass TROPOMI data, such as rice cultivation and livestock. We include 2019 oil, gas, and coal emissions from the updated Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEIÂ v2; Scarpelli etÂ al.,Â 2022a) and 2018 landfill emissions from EDGARÂ V6.0 (Crippa etÂ al.,Â 2021). We identify the dominant source type as being the source type with the largest annual flux in a 0.7âÃ0.7â square centered around the estimated source location. Based on known emitters, we found that using a window of this size mitigates errors in the estimated source location and spatial errors in the emission inventories. We do not use this approach to attribute detections to wetlands. However, we do inspect 2019 fluxes from the WetCHARTsÂ v1.3.1 ensemble (Bloom etÂ al.,Â 2021) to identify regions where detections might be influenced by strong wetland fluxes, such as in central Africa (Pandey etÂ al.,Â 2021).\n\n2.5.4âComparison with a previously studied super-emitter event\n\nIn order to test the automated pipeline and feature engineering algorithms, we apply it to data over a SeptemberÂ 2019 super-emitter event in Louisiana, USA (Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022a). The model detects the emission event on multiple days, including on the first day with large emissions and significant TROPOMI coverage (25Â September). The CNN score isÂ >0.999, and the SVC classified the scene as a plume. The estimated source location of the plume is 2.2âkm away from the source, and our automated quantification estimate is 121Â±46âtâhâ1. Our estimate is in good agreement with the quantification by Maasakkers etÂ al. (2022a) of 101â(49â127)âtâhâ1, which scales a plume simulated with the WRF atmospheric transport model to match the enhancements seen in TROPOMI using a Bayesian inversion.\n\n2.6âHigh-spatial-resolution methane satellite instruments, retrievals, and source rate quantification\n\nWe use observations from three high-spatial-resolution instruments, GHGSat, PRISMA, and Sentinel-2, to inspect the sources of the detected methane plumes. This section describes the main characteristics of these instruments.\n\n2.6.1âGHGSat\n\nGHGSat-Cx instruments are FabryâPÃ©rot imaging spectrometers that were launched in 2020â2022 (C1âC5), building on the GHGSat-D instrument (Jervis etÂ al.,Â 2021). The instruments have a spatial resolution of 25âmâÃâ25âm over targeted scenes of â¼10âkmâÃââ¼15âkm (Ramier etÂ al.,Â 2020; MacLean etÂ al.,Â 2021). They sample the SWIR part of the spectrum between 1630Â and 1675ânm at â¼0.3ânm spectral resolution, retrieving the methane column density with a precision of 1â% of the background concentration and a theoretical detection threshold of down to â¼100âkgâhâ1 at a wind speed of 3âmâsâ1 (ESA,Â 2022). During a controlled release experiment comparing the methane observing capabilities of different high-resolution instruments by Sherwin etÂ al. (2023), a plume of â¼200âkgâhâ1 was successfully detected. We use data from GHGSat-C1 and GHGSat-C2 and estimate the source rates using the IME method, as described in Maasakkers etÂ al. (2022b), for point sources with 10âm wind data from GEOSÂ FP (Molod etÂ al.,Â 2012). The uncertainty in the quantification is estimated, as described by Varon etÂ al. (2019), taking into account the error contributions from measurement noise, the wind speed, and the IME method, similar to Maasakkers etÂ al. (2022b).\n\n2.6.2âPRISMA\n\nThe Italian Space Agency's hyperspectral instrument PRISMA was launched in March 2019 and generates publicly available targeted hyperspectral 30âkmâÃâ30âkm images at a spatial resolution of 30âmâÃâ30âm and â¼10ânm spectral resolution (Cogliati etÂ al.,Â 2021; Guanter etÂ al.,Â 2021; Cusworth etÂ al.,Â 2021). The revisit time can be as short as 7âd, using the instrument's Â±20â% across-track pointing (Cogliati etÂ al.,Â 2021). The smallest source rate tested during a controlled release experiment (Sherwin etÂ al.,Â 2023) is â¼2500âkgâhâ1. The theoretical detection threshold is lower (â¼300â900âkgâhâ1 for homogeneous scenes) and strongly depends on the surface type/homogeneity (Guanter etÂ al.,Â 2021). The PRISMA instrument is not a continuous mapper, but a data archive of past (targeted) observations is publicly available. PRISMA can also be used to target a location of interest in the future. We perform methane retrievals and IME quantifications, as described in Guanter etÂ al. (2021), using plume masking, following Varon etÂ al. (2018), and GEOSÂ FP 10âm wind data (Molod etÂ al.,Â 2012).\n\n2.6.3âSentinel-2\n\nThe Sentinel-2 surface-imaging mission (consisting of Sentinel-2A launched in 2015 and Sentinel-2B launched in 2017) was demonstrated by Varon etÂ al. (2021) to be capable of detecting methane super-emitter plumes under favorable conditions. Both satellites carry a MSI, with a pixel resolution of 20âmâÃâ20âm for the B11 (â¼100ânm) and B12 (â¼200ânm) SWIR bands, with a sensitivity to methane. The instruments have a 290âkm wide swath, resulting in a global 2â5âd revisit time (Drusch etÂ al.,Â 2012). Sentinel-2 observes continuously (as opposed to GHGSat and PRISMA) and provides an extensive, publicly available archive going back years. A methane absorption signal has to be strong in order to stand out within the aggregated signal of the entire band; therefore, only relatively large quantities of methane can be retrieved, and the detection limit worsens considerably over non-homogeneous terrain. The detection limit is estimated at â¼1â2âtâhâ1 for homogeneous scenes (GorroÃ±o etÂ al.,Â 2023), which is in agreement with Sherwin etÂ al. (2023), where a â¼1800âkgâhâ1 emission was detected and quantified. We apply the methane retrieval and IME quantification approach from GorroÃ±o etÂ al. (2023), who, like Varon etÂ al. (2021), use a reference day without a plume to isolate the difference caused by methane concentration enhancement. We again use GEOSÂ FP 10âm wind data (Molod etÂ al.,Â 2012).\n\nWe apply the trained and optimized CNN and SVC models (Fig.Â 1, CNN training and SVC training) in sequence on all 2021 TROPOMI XCH4 data (Fig.Â 1, CNNâ+âSVC application). Analyzing the full year with the machine learningÂ pipeline takes approximately 3âh on a single core. From the 794â395Â (32Ã32 pixel) scenes, the CNN identifies 26â444Â scenes (3.3â%) that contain plume-like XCH4 morphological structures. The SVC classifies 10â430Â of these scenes as plumes. After duplicate removal, 4869Â scenes are identified as unique. These 4869Â scenes are manually inspected to assess the performance of the pipeline. We confirm 2974Â scenes as being confident plumes. Another 745 scenes are labeled as potential plumes; accepting these scenes as plumes results in a precision of 76â% for the full pipeline. These potential plumes could not readily be verified as being real methane plumes but are valuable for further inspection. The remaining scenes are either labeled as artifacts or not containing a (concentrated) plume. These misclassifications can be used to further optimize the machine learning pipeline. Here, we will focus on the 2974 confident plumes and present the result of our high-resolution satellite instrument analysis to pinpoint the exact sources of 12 (clusters of) detections.\n\n3.1âOverview of the confirmed detections in 2021\n\nFigureÂ 6 shows the spatial distribution of all 2974Â detected and confirmed 2021Â plumes, which are attributed by source sector, based on the three bottom-up inventories (Sect.Â 2.5.3). We find that 1031Â plumes predominantly relate to urban areas and/or landfills, 720Â to gas infrastructure, 612Â to oil infrastructure, and 581 to coal mines. As super-emitters are usually not the result of regular operations and are therefore not well represented in bottom-up inventories, especially large transient emissions may be misattributed by this approach. Wetlands are not expected to result in point source emissions, but strongly emitting wetlands in central Africa, such as South Sudan and in the Niger delta, can produce large enhancements in the TROPOMI data (Pandey etÂ al.,Â 2021; Shaw etÂ al.,Â 2022). In the absence of large anthropogenic emissions, we label the plumes from these two regions as âunclassifiedâ. Wetlands might also contribute to detected signals in areas with large anthropogenic emissions, for example, around the city of Dhaka, located in the GangesâBrahmaputra Delta (Bangladesh), or in the Mississippi Delta (USA).\n\nThere are many clear hotspot locations with frequent detections. To group the detections into clusters with a common source, we apply the DBSCAN clustering algorithm (Ester etÂ al.,Â 1996; Schubert etÂ al.,Â 2017). We cluster based on the distance between detections in meters and set a threshold of fiveÂ detections within 30âkm as the minimum to identify a cluster. We identify 94Â clusters; this is a conservative estimate for the number of persistent locations, as some known persistent emitters have fewer than fiveÂ detections in 2021. We also observe several areas with extensive plumes from multiple emitters, such as the west coast of Turkmenistan, which are grouped into one big cluster. We find the majority of detected plumes (74.8â%) to be clustered at a persistent urban or fossil fuel exploitation source and classify the remaining plumes as transients. Zoom-ins of the clusters in several distinct regions and source rates for all detections are shown in Fig.Â 7.\n\nSeveral of the identified clusters are located over well-known oil and gas production regions, such as the west coast of Turkmenistan (Fig.Â 7a), previously studied by Varon etÂ al. (2019) and Irakulis-Loitxate etÂ al. (2022b), Algeria (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2021), Libya, and multiple basins in the USA (Shen etÂ al.,Â 2022), including the Eagle Ford Basin, Haynesville Basin, and most prominently the Permian Basin (Fig.Â 7b), where Zhang etÂ al. (2020) quantified emissions based on TROPOMI, and we find individual clusters of detections over the Midland and Delaware sub-basins. The fact that many of the detections are clustered around known large sources gives confidence in the performance of the models that did not use prior location information. We also identify oil and gas production clusters which have not been studied in detail, such as in northern Libya, Yemen, and northeastern India.\n\nWe also find large transient plumes along the major gas transmission pipelines in western Russia (Fig.Â 7c), similar to what Lauvaux etÂ al. (2022) found for 2019â2020. Clusters of detections are seen over coal mining areas in China (Chen etÂ al.,Â 2022), southern Poland (Tu etÂ al.,Â 2022b), South Africa, Russia, and northeastern Australia (Fig.Â 7e), where Sadavarte etÂ al. (2021) quantified large emissions from these clusters of coal mines. Our approach allows us to detect which specific locations within a larger area of fossil fuel exploitation cause large methane plumes; examples are the super-emitter clusters within the large, spread-out Shanxi coal mining region in China (Fig.Â 7d).\n\nThe majority of our detections are related to urban areas around the world, including four cities with large fluxes (Buenos Aires, Mumbai, Delhi, and Lahore), which were also identified by Maasakkers etÂ al. (2022b) based on long-term wind-rotated TROPOMI averages. Urban areas comprise a range of source types, but individual landfills can make up a large fraction of total urban emissions (Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022b). When we zoom into the area around Casablanca, Morocco (Fig.Â 7f), we see strong convergence into a cluster. Most plumes within the cluster (19Â out ofÂ 23) are quantified below 25âtâhâ1, of which eightÂ are quantified below 15âtâhâ1. The estimated source locations of the plumes are on average 12âkm away from a landfill later detected and quantified using GHGSat (Fig.Â 8; Sect.Â 3.2). Other urban clusters include Madrid in Spain, sevenÂ cities in Pakistan, Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, Bucharest in Romania, and Mexico City and Guadalajara in Mexico. The most frequently detected (104Â detections) urban cluster is centered around Dhaka, Bangladesh. In India, we see eightÂ urban clusters and several cities with at least two detections. Detections over India are seasonally limited by meteorology, as there are hardly any TROPOMI data during the MayâSeptember monsoon season because of the persistent cloud cover.\n\nThe distribution of the estimated source rates of all 2974 verified plumes is shown in Fig.Â 7g. Our IME-based quantifications show mean emissions of 44âtâhâ1, with a large 5â95th percentile range of 8â122âtâhâ1. Many detections are quantified below the detection threshold of previous TROPOMI plume identification and quantification methods of 25âtâhâ1 (Lauvaux etÂ al.,Â 2022; Jacob etÂ al.,Â 2022). We find 1143Â plumes quantified under 25âtâhâ1, including 241Â plumes under 10âtâhâ1. Many of these originate from persistent emission clusters, where emissions have been confirmed using high-resolution instruments. Although the applied mass balance quantification method has significant uncertainty, this shows that the plume detection limit of TROPOMI is better than previously reported in the literature.\n\nIn order to present a rough estimate for total emissions represented by the detected plumes, we assume that each emission event is active for 24âh (the minimum sampling frequency of TROPOMI). For some transient plumes, such as pulse emissions at compressor stations, the 24âh estimate can be an overestimate, but we take these to be representative of similar transient events occurring outside of the TROPOMI observation window. Using these assumptions, we find detected emissions of 3.1Â±1.3âTg for 2021. As a conservative uncertainty estimate, we use the sum of the standard deviations of the individual ensembles. The number of detected plumes is an underestimate of the true number of plumes, as observations are limited by clouds and illumination.\n\nTo account for the limited TROPOMI coverage and obtain an indication of the annual emissions that our detections are representative of, we scale our detected emissions by the fraction of days with coverage. We estimate the local number of days with coverage from our 794â395Â valid scenes by first mapping their spatial footprints to a 0.1Ã0.1â grid and removing the duplicate coverage from overlapping scenes in the same orbit. We then correct for local variations in coverage (such as persistent areas without data) by convoluting this field with the summed footprints of all 2021 TROPOMI data at 0.1Ã0.1â. We finally aggregate our detected emissions to a 1Ã1â grid and divide those by the fraction of days in 2021 with coverage resulting from the coverage map averaged to 1Ã1â. We find a scaled-up annual emission flux of 10.3âTg, which is approximately 2.7â% of the total bottom-up 2017 anthropogenic emissions (380âTgâyrâ1; Saunois etÂ al.,Â 2020). Super-emitter plumes from landfills account for 4.1âTgâyrâ1 (6â% of global emissions), those from coal 2.1âTgâyrâ1 (4.7â%), those from oil 2.2âTgâyrâ1, and those of gas 1.9âTgâyrâ1 (4.9â% of global oil and gas; Saunois etÂ al.,Â 2020). These estimates are only small fractions of the total anthropogenic emissions, as our conservative upscaling approach only takes large TROPOMI-detected super-emitter plumes into account. Emissions from smaller point sources and area sources make a large contribution to the total but are not part of our upscaling. Such emissions are better captured by an atmospheric inversion.\n\n3.2âSynergy of automated TROPOMI detections with high-resolution instruments\n\nWe use the detection of persistent methane plumes in TROPOMI data to target high-resolution observations (GHGSat-C1 and GHGSat-C2) and data analysis (PRISMA archive and Sentinel-2), following Maasakkers etÂ al. (2022b). Furthermore, we investigate large transient emissions with data from non-targeted instruments, such as Sentinel-2.\n\nFigureÂ 8 shows a TROPOMI plume (14.6Â±8.8âtâhâ1) detected near Casablanca in Morocco on 12Â JuneÂ 2021. We detected 23Â plumes in the area in 2021, with source rates ranging from 8.9Â±5.1Â to 40.5Â±18.0âtâhâ1, with a mean of 18.8âtâhâ1, indicating a persistent source (Fig.Â 7f). Based on a wind rotation analysis (Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022b), we find the landfill located in between Casablanca and Mediouna to be the optimal target for high-resolution observations. Based on this TROPOMI analysis, we observe this location. The inset image shows a targeted GHGSat-C2 observation on 19Â AugustÂ 2021, which indeed shows a methane plume (quantified at 7.4Â±3.3âtâhâ1) originating from the landfill and extending downwind.\n\nFigureÂ 9 shows two methane plumes detected with TROPOMI in northern Kazakhstan on 14Â MayÂ 2021 at 07:53âUTC, quantified at 35.2Â±13.2âtâhâ1 for the northern plume and 28.1Â±11.2âtâhâ1 for the southern plume. The same locations were also detected in an adjacent orbit at 09:33âUTC, but the closest days with coverage before and after 14Â MayÂ 2021 do not show emissions, which indicates that the plumes are transient. The bottom-up inventories show natural gas systems as being the locally dominant anthropogenic source sector because of the presence of a gas transmission pipeline. In Sentinel-2 observations taken 38âmin before the first detection, we find two emitting locations close to the pipeline in the upwind part of the TROPOMI plume masks. The source rates of the Sentinel-2 plumes are 180Â±59Â and 75Â±23âtâhâ1 for the northern and southern plume, respectively. The rather large discrepancy between the TROPOMI and Sentinel-2 quantifications can be explained by the uncertain low wind speeds, the not well-developed plume in TROPOMI increasing the uncertainty in the IME, and possibly the partial pixel enhancement effect described by Pandey etÂ al. (2019).\n\nFiguresÂ 8 andÂ 9 show how TROPOMI detections can be combined with high-resolution observations for both persistent and transient emitters. FigureÂ 10 shows 10 additional locations analyzed with GHGSat (sevenÂ scenes), PRISMAÂ (two), and Sentinel-2Â (one), based on TROPOMI detections. These 12Â selected locations show the range of typical anthropogenic source types and intermittencies we have observed with both TROPOMI and high-resolution instruments. TablesÂ B1âB3 in the Supplement provide details on these high-resolution observations and associated (not necessarily on the same day) TROPOMI scenes (TableÂ B4). We find facility-level source rates from 0.3Â±0.1âtâhâ1 up to 16Â±5âtâhâ1. Because of the different spatial footprints, sensitivities, and detection dates, these emission rates cannot be directly compared to the TROPOMI emission estimates (Maasakkers etÂ al.,Â 2022b).\n\nThe different specifications of the high-resolution instruments make them suitable for different purposes. The methane-designated GHGSat-Cx instruments have the lowest detection limit and are capable of retrieving methane over areas with challenging surface structures, such as urban areas. Southeast of Madrid, we observe plumes from two separate landfills located 7âkm apart. The methane plumes originate from the active areas of the landfills where waste is added. In TROPOMI, the signals from these two landfills appear as a single point source. In the gas production region around Shreveport, Louisiana, USA, we observe three emission plumes originating from distinct infrastructure, including from two facilities that are only â¼500âm apart. Over a coal mining area in Russia, we see in a GHGSat observation that a single TROPOMI-based target has contributions from 10Â different point sources, with source rates from 0.2Â±0.1 to 2.4Â±1.1âtâhâ1. The emissions originate from coal mining facilities, such as underground mine vents, adding up to 8.8âtâhâ1. In the Assam oil and gas fields, we find five plumes adding up to 12.9âtâhâ1, showing that the GHGSat-Cx instruments are also capable of retrieving methane plumes over non-homogeneous areas including forest and agricultural lands. We also use GHGSat to target two less challenging desert scenes with oil and gas production. A GHGSat observation over Libya shows two sources downwind of each other, and the most upwind source is an unlit flare stack. At the border of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (listed as Uzbekistan in Fig.Â 10), we find emissions at three distinct locations within a single natural gas facility, with source rates ranging from 3.6Â±1.0 to 6.4Â±1.8âtâhâ1. These emissions appear to originate from unlit flaring stacks, similar to what Irakulis-Loitxate etÂ al. (2022b) and Varon etÂ al. (2019) found for other natural gas facilities in the region.\n\nFor scenes with more homogeneous surfaces or extremely large emissions, PRISMA and Sentinel-2 can also be used. The PRISMA observation in Turkmenistan shows three plumes with an aggregated emission rate of 9.0Â±2.9âtâhâ1. The emissions originate from distinct pieces of gas infrastructure (quantified at 3.5Â±1.1, 3.0Â±1.0, and 2.5Â±0.8âtâhâ1), and the sources are located within the footprint of a single TROPOMI pixel (the same source is shown in Figs.Â 2 andÂ 5). We also use the PRISMA archive to detect a plume originating from a coal mine ventilation shaft in Liuzhuang village in Shanxi, China. Finally, we use Sentinel-2 to investigate a single location in Iran with complex observation conditions (elevation), where we only had a single TROPOMI detection in 2021. The emissions therefore appeared to be transient at first, but with Sentinel-2, we find three emission plumes ranging from 1.3Â±0.4 to 10.0Â±3.0âtâhâ1 that originate from the same oil facility in a time span of 2 months. Extensive monitoring of a location of interest over a longer time span is feasible when using Sentinel-2 (Varon etÂ al.,Â 2021).\n\nWe detected methane emission plumes in 2021 TROPOMI data using an automated, machine-learning-based pipeline. We have trained a convolutional neural network with a relatively small set of manually identified plumes in pre-2021 TROPOMI methane data to detect plume-like morphological structures (ÎºÂ score ofÂ 0.97 and recall ofÂ 0.98 on the test set). We then used a support vector classifier to distinguish real plumes from retrieval artifacts using additional information from the scene and supporting data (Îº score ofÂ 0.81 and recall ofÂ 0.93 on the test set). This two-step approach can also be applied to other instruments in the future. We tested our detection, source localization, and emission quantification estimate for a specific, well-characterized natural gas well blowout and found that it was accurately captured by our monitoring system. After the application of our pipeline to the 2021 data, we targeted high-resolution observations and analyses to find the facilities responsible for 12 (clusters of) plumes seen in TROPOMI.\n\nUsing our automated machine learning pipeline, we scan all 794â395Â scenes of 2021 in 3âh on a single core. Of these scenes, 4869Â are automatically classified as plumes, of which 2974Â are manually verified as being confident plumes and 745Â as being potential plumes, thus giving the automated pipeline a precision of 61â%â76â%. The most challenging distinction for the SVC is between plumes and artifacts, which is a distinction that can be inconclusive even for a human expert in difficult cases. We focus on the manually verified plumes; the remaining 39â% of the scenes are mostly difficult to classify and can still be followed up with manual inspection or be used to further train the models. We find that most plumes (74.8â%) originate from 94 clusters of detections around both known and new, persistent source locations. The other plumes are mainly caused by transient emission events, such as along natural gas transmission pipelines in Russia. We most often detect plumes (based on bottom-up emission inventories) from urban areas and/or landfills (1031Â plumes), followed by 720Â plumes from gas infrastructure, 612Â from oil infrastructure, and 581Â from coal mining. Many of the identified clusters are located at well-known fossil fuel exploitation regions or urban areas known to emit methane. We also identify several previously unstudied sources such as in Libya and Assam (India) and identify specific super-emitting locations within spread-out fossil fuel production regions like the Shanxi coal mining area in China. Based on IME quantifications of all plumes, we found mean emissions of 44âtâhâ1 with a 5â95th percentile range of 8â122âtâhâ1, which is an indication of the TROPOMI detection limit. With 1143Â detections under 25âtâhâ1, including 241Â plumes under 10âtâhâ1, our automated approach has a better detection limit than previously published methods based on TROPOMI data. When we assume that all 2944Â detected anthropogenic emissions are active for 24âh, we find detected 2021Â emissions of 3.1Â±1.3âTg. Accounting for the limited coverage of TROPOMI, these detected emissions are representative of 10.3âTgâyrâ1, which is approximately 2.7â% of global annual anthropogenic methane emissions.\n\nFor 12 locations, we used high-resolution satellite observations (GHGSat-C1 and GHGSat-C2, PRISMA, and Sentinel-2) to identify the exact sources responsible for the detected plumes in TROPOMI. We utilized the different strengths of the high-resolution instruments; we made targeted observations with GHGSat over scenes with complex surface reflectance, whereas the archive of Sentinel-2 is used to analyze large transient emission events and track intermittent emissions. We found point sources from landfills and fossil fuel exploitation with emission rates from 0.3Â±0.1 to 180Â±59âtâhâ1. Most fossil-fuel-related TROPOMI plumes had contributions from multiple point sources, with one GHGSat observation over Russia revealing emissions from 10 different sources.\n\nOver the next few years, the number of global, regional, and point source mapping instruments capable of retrieving methane plumes will vastly increase, includingÂ Sentinel-5, CO2M, MethaneSAT, and Carbon Mapper (Jacob etÂ al.,Â 2022). Our monitoring system can incorporate these fast-growing data volumes and can already be used to automatically detect plumes in the operational TROPOMI data, track temporal variability in super-emitter plumes, and tip and cue high-resolution satellite instruments to find the associated super-emitting facilities. This identification and monitoring of super-emitters with large mitigation potential is paramount to reach the goals of the Global Methane Pledge.\n\nASI â Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (Italian Space Agency): The PRISMA data portal, https://prismauserregistration.asi.it (last access: 20Â April,Â 2023), 2023.âa\n\nBloom, A., Bowman, K., Lee, M., Turner, A., Schroeder, R., Worden, J., Weidner, R., McDonald, K., and Jacob, D.: CMS: Global 0.5-deg Wetland Methane Emissions and Uncertainty (WetCHARTsÂ v1.3.1), ORNLÂ DAAC [data set], https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1915, 2021.âa, b\n\nBorsdorff, T., Aan DeÂ Brugh, J., Hu, H., Hasekamp, O., Sussmann, R., Rettinger, M., Hase, F., Gross, J., Schneider, M., Garcia, O., Stremme, W., Grutter, M., Feist, D.
