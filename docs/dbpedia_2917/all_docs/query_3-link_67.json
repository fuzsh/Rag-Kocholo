        "text": "VENICE is equipped with a 36x24mm full-frame image sensor, designed specifically for high end cinematography, and can capture images up to a maximum resolution of 6048 x 4032. By switching imager modes, VENICE can natively support Super35 24.3 x 18.0mm, 4096 x 3024 resolution (equivalent to 4-perforation motion picture film) and Super35 24.3 x 12.8mm, 4096 x 2160 resolution (equivalent to 3-perforation motion picture film). In other words, VENICE’s new full-frame sensor can capture in almost any format, including full 18mm-height Super35 Anamorphic and spherical and full-frame 24mm-height Anamorphic and spherical. Almost any aspect ratio can be conjured up: 1.85:1, 2.39:1, 17:9, the list goes on in full-frame or Super35.\n\nWith VENICE, Sony is giving users the option to customize their camera by only enabling the features as needed, according to individual production requirements. Licenses are available to expand the camera’s capabilities including 4K anamorphic and 6K full-frame.\n\nFull-Frame Full width 36 mm 6K\n\nIn full-frame, you can use the full 6048 pixel width of the sensor for widescreen spherical 2.39:1 or Large Format Scope. Full-Frame can be used creatively in a number of ways – for example, to allow for extra shallow depth of field or super-wide shooting.\n\nSuper35 full height 2.0x squeeze Anamorphic\n\nFor anamorphic shooting and production, Super35 full height 2x squeeze anamorphic is supported.\n\nSuper35 17:9 and 16:9\n\nThese popular imager sizes are natively supported by VENICE. Current Super35mm PL mount lenses can be used.\n\nThe VENICE Digital Motion Picture Camera was created out of intense dialogue with cinematographers to capture stunning visuals in almost any format, including full frame 36x24mm, Super35 and Anamorphic. It is also certified for the ‘Filmed in IMAX’ program due to its stunning imaging quality and integration with IMAX proprietary post-production workflow process. The IMAX program provides best practice guidelines to take advantage of each cameras’ highest possible capture qualities and settings in order to maximize The IMAX Experience® – including IMAX’s exclusive expanded aspect ratio.\n\nThe optional High Frame Rate license allows VENICE to shoot at speeds of up to 120fps at 4K 2.39:1, and 60fps at 6K 3:2 as well as up to 110fps at 4K 17:9, 90fps at 6K 2.39:1, 72fps at 6K 17:9, 72fps at 6K 1.85:1 and 75fps at 4K 4:3 with anamorphic license.\n\nChoose from the growing eco-system of E-mount lenses and, via third party adaptors, the world of SLR and rangefinder lenses. Lever lock operation provides added security with large lenses and in most cases lens support rigs don’t need to be removed when changing lens. Switching from PL Mount to E-mount is can be done by simply removing six hex screws while E-mount lens iris operation is controllable via assignable button.\n\nThe VENICE and VENICE 2 have a fully modular design and even the sensor block is removable. This allows filmmakers to separate the sensor from camera body with the Camera Extension System*. VENICE 2 owners have the ability to change between the original 6K sensor or the all-new 8K sensor, similar to film stock. In order to improve ergonomic balance for operators, the top handle and viewfinder are easily adjustable. As the height of the camera from the bottom to the optical sensor of the lens mount is the same as the F55, base plates and other accessories used for the F55 can be used with VENICE. The AXS-R7 recorder can be attached to VENICE with just four screws.\n\nCamera Extension System (CBK-3610XS and CBK-3620XS) gives you flexibility for many mounting setups to VENICE\n\nVENICE is the world’s first camera of its class with a servo-controlled 8-step mechanical ND filter mechanism built into the camera chassis. It offers a massive ND of 0.3 (1/2 = 1 stop) to ND2.4 (1/256 = 8 stops) range that reduces time lost on set changing external filters. The ND filters also greatly increase VENICE’s flexibility when being controlled remotely on drones and cranes, or in an underwater housing.\n\n*Based on Sony market research.\n\nVENICE has control displays on both sides of the camera, with the main control display on the camera outside for fast access to the camera settings by the camera assistant while shooting. The camera operator’s OLED mini display allows intuitive control of commonly accessed features such as ND filter, shutter, FPS, White Balance and Exposure Index. The control interface is an all-new design based on extensive researches with camera operators.\n\nCamera operators always appreciate a warning when mic booms or other distractions\n\nthreaten to enter the frame. Using Surround View mode, the viewfinder and on-set monitors can display a 5% margin around area being recorded.\n\nNOTE: Surround View is available on 3.8K 16:9, 4K 17:9 and 4K 4:3 imager modes on VF, SDI 3/4 and HD Monitor outputs. Maximum supported frame rates are up to 29.97fps (project) and 48fps (variable).\n\nApple ProRes including ProRes 422 proxy formats are popular in postproduction, and are supported by VENICE. This means there’s no need for transcoding; you can simply handle these formats directly from the camera.\n\nRAW\n\nThis ultimate 16-bit linear RAW format preserves all the information captured in 4K, with 16 times more tonal values than 12-bit RAW.\n\nAnd X-OCN XT captures the highest quality imagery when using the AXS-R7 portable memory recorder. X-OCN XT is ideal for demanding visual effects work and productions requiring the utmost image quality from VENICE. The new X-OCN XT profile maintains economical file sizes comparable to Sony’s RAW file size, making the workflow affordable and efficient. In comparing X-OCN with Sony’s RAW format, X-OCN has superior reproduction in low light areas and high light areas. In VENICE’s 4K 17:9 imager mode, users will have the flexibility to record three X-OCN profiles (XT, ST, LT) and Sony RAW.\n\nACES is a free, open, device-independent colour management and image interchange system that can be applied to almost any current or future workflow. It was developed by hundreds of the industry’s top scientists, engineers and end users, working together under the auspices of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Sony is committed to supporting ACES-based workflows in the highest quality possible.\n\nRead more >\n\n6G/12G-SDI switchable output enabling single 4K SDI output during RAW/X-OCN and HD simultaneous recording using a single BNC cable to simplify on-set operations.\n\nFor highest quality on-set monitoring, Sony’s PVM-X1800 and PVM-X2400 TRIMASTER 4K HDR monitors offer precision reproduction at ultra-high definition with a resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels and an impressive brightness of all-white luminance of 1000 cd/m2. To empower filmmakers to make critical imaging decisions, their wide colour gamut matches the industry-leading BVM-HX310 TRIMASTER HX master monitor. The PVM X Series are highly portable to support 4K HDR production for applications such as on-set monitoring for a DIT cart and/or Video village."
