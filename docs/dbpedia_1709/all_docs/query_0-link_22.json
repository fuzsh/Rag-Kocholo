It is dedicated to the exploration of a little-processed long-period comet, possibly entering the inner Solar System for the first time, or to encounter an interstellar object originating at another star. The objectives of the mission are to address the following questions: What are the surface composition, shape, morphology, and structure of the target object? What is the composition of the gas and dust in the coma, its connection to the nucleus, and the nature of its interaction with the solar wind? The mission was proposed to the European Space Agency in 2018, and formally adopted by the agency in June 2022, for launch in 2029 together with the Ariel mission. Comet Interceptor will take advantage of the opportunity presented by ESA’s F-Class call for fast, flexible, low-cost missions to which it was proposed. The call required a launch to a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point. The mission can take advantage of this placement to wait for the discovery of a suitable comet reachable with its minimum ΔV capability of 600 ms−1. Comet Interceptor will be unique in encountering and studying, at a nominal closest approach distance of 1000 km, a comet that represents a near-pristine sample of material from the formation of the Solar System. It will also add a capability that no previous cometary mission has had, which is to deploy two sub-probes – B1, provided by the Japanese space agency, JAXA, and B2 – that will follow different trajectories through the coma. While the main probe passes at a nominal 1000 km distance, probes B1 and B2 will follow different chords through the coma at distances of 850 km and 400 km, respectively. The result will be unique, simultaneous, spatially resolved information of the 3-dimensional properties of the target comet and its interaction with the space environment. We present the mission’s science background leading to these objectives, as well as an overview of the scientific instruments, mission design, and schedule.\n\nKeywords: Comets, Spacecraft, Instruments – spaceborne and space research\n\nIntroduction\n\nComets are the surviving remnants of the original building blocks of the Solar System. A significant amount of pristine material from the formation of the Solar System persists in the Oort Cloud (OC), which extends out to at least 1 light year from the Sun, unmodified or barely modified since the earliest days of the Solar System. All other material to which we have access – asteroids, meteorites, lunar and planetary surface samples and atmospheres – has been significantly or heavily modified, both physically and chemically since its formation. While multiple comets have been studied in situ, all, with the exception of 1P/Halley, have arguably been low-activity, short-period, highly-evolved comets, which have changed radically since their formation, having spent considerable time in the inner Solar System. Even Comet Halley, with its longer period and high activity is thought to have made several thousand returns to perihelion. Such objects are highly depleted in volatiles (A’Hearn et al. 1995), particularly low-temperature volatiles, at least in their outer layers. While all the comets studied in situ to date share certain characteristics (e.g., low albedo, jet activity, …), the observed nucleus morphology shows considerable differences between objects, suggesting that they have experienced radically different evolutionary processes, possibly due, at least in part, to their orbital instability that leads to considerable variations of perihelion distance and thus insolation over timescales of decades and centuries. These highly evolved objects also show significant morphological differences with the only small Kuiper-Belt object to be observed to date, 2014 MU69 (Arrokoth), studied by the New Horizons mission during a ∼3540 km flyby at a relative speed of 14.3 km s−1, around 3 times further and likely slower than the proposed Comet Interceptor encounter.\n\nDynamically new comets arriving from the OC have, by definition, never visited the inner Solar System before. They are expected to be rich in the low-temperature volatiles retained from their formation and close to their pristine state, particularly in the case of a pre-perihelion encounter. Given the long lead-up times required to plan and launch a space mission, it has been impossible prior to Comet Interceptor to contemplate encounter missions with such objects, to observe a pristine, or minimally evolved nucleus and study its morphology, its activity, and its interactions with the interplanetary medium. The opportunity to observe, in situ, a dynamically new comet that is entering the inner Solar System for the first time will allow the data from previous comet encounter missions and from ground-based campaigns to be placed in its proper context. Such an encounter will allow the composition, both chemical and isotopic, of the protosolar nebula to be studied. This will offer valuable insights into the chemical and isotopic evolution of the Solar System since its formation.\n\nIt has been known for many years that there is a population of dynamically new objects that are lost to the Solar System. These objects’ paths are perturbed in the inner Solar System into hyperbolic orbits and, thus, escape solar influence. It has long been assumed that there is a similar population of objects external to the Solar System that enter it from interstellar space: these objects have been expelled from the stellar system where they formed and thus present the opportunity of sampling primordial material formed around other stars, in different conditions to the formation of our Solar System. Such an interstellar wanderer manifests itself by having a sufficiently large hyperbolic excess of velocity to demonstrate that it could not have originated in the OC. Two such objects are now known: 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, discovered in 2017 and 2019 respectively. While the probability of detecting such an interstellar object that satisfies the targeting conditions for Comet Interceptor is low, it is non-zero: such an object would be potentially an extremely high-value target scientifically. It is expected that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will increase considerably the detection capability, not just of dynamically new objects, but also of this population of interstellar comets.\n\nComet Interceptor was proposed to the European Space Agency by an international consortium of scientists and engineers, in response to a call for mission proposals issued by ESA in July 2018. The project was selected in June 2019 as the prime candidate for the agency’s first F-class mission in its Cosmic Vision Programme. Phase A started in 2020, with two parallel industrial studies. In April 2021, Comet Interceptor moved into Phase B1. During Phase A and B1, the Science Study Team and Science Steering Committee studied and validated the science case, supported by the ESA study team and members of the proposal consortium, organized into working groups. The mission was formally adopted by ESA in June 2022.\n\nThe mission aims to intercept a long-period comet, LPC, ideally a dynamically-new comet, DNC, one of a subset of LPCs that is approaching the inner Solar System for the first time, or even an interstellar body. The intercept will involve a close-approach flyby scenario using three elements: a mother spacecraft, spacecraft A, and smaller probes named B1 and B2 that are carried as payloads until the flyby, and delivered to different flyby trajectories. This will allow the gathering of remote and in situ multi-point observations of the comet and its coma (Fig. ).\n\nComet Interceptor follows the successful history of European exploration of comets, following in the footsteps of ESA’s Giotto and Rosetta missions, as well as the substantial contribution of scientists from European countries to the two Soviet-led VEGA missions. A preliminary description of the mission as proposed to ESA was published by Snodgrass and Jones (2019). In this work, we describe the scientific rationale for the mission, as well as the mission itself, in much greater depth. This includes a description of the project’s mature payload and mission design as they stand shortly after mission adoption.\n\nScientific Context\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile the Giotto flyby of 1P/Halley was the first mission to provide good resolution images of a cometary nucleus, the Rosetta rendezvous was conceived, e.g. Glassmeier et al. (2007), as the first mission to monitor the changing activity of a cometary nucleus before and after perihelion, which it achieved (Taylor et al. 2017). Both missions revolutionized cometary science. Rosetta showed that the composition of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (referred to as 67P) is rich in organics and has a different water isotope ratio to Earth’s (Altwegg et al. 2015); that its surface structure and morphology (Sierks et al. 2015) are controlled by seasonal activity (Hässig et al. 2015), with starkly contrasting areas dominated by erosion and by dust fall-back (El-Maarry et al. 2015, 2016); and that the comet’s inner coma is highly dynamic, changing in time and space, e.g., Della Corte et al. (2015), Feldman et al. (2015), Lee et al. (2015). Rosetta also raised important new questions:\n\nWhat properties are primordial, and reflect the process of comet formation, and what are evolutionary features?\n\nHow do these properties control cometary activity?\n\nAre the differences in composition seen in the coma and solar wind interaction spatial or temporal in origin?\n\nWe detail these problems in the following Sects. 2.2 and 2.3, divided into two themes that address Nucleus and Coma science, respectively, and present the Comet Interceptor mission to address them by making unique multi-point measurements at a much more pristine type of comet. The exact sources and mechanisms driving activity in comets remain a puzzle after Rosetta. Due to the flyby nature of the mission, Comet Interceptor will not be able to monitor changes in activity. However, detailed observations of the surface and the coma will be combined to address this point (i.e., potentially linking the coma structures to nucleus surface features). These are described within Sect. 2.3, in the Coma theme, below.\n\nTheme 1: Comet Nucleus Science\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis science theme focuses on the nucleus, looking to answer the following questions. What are the:\n\nsurface composition,\n\nshape,\n\nmorphology, and\n\nstructure\n\nof the target object?\n\nThese questions can only be answered by in situ (as opposed to remote sensing from the Earth) measurements, in particular given the relative size of the nucleus with respect to the coma which hides the nucleus for observations from Earth and near-Earth based observatories.\n\nCharacterisation of the nucleus by Comet Interceptor will provide information on its bulk properties (shape, rotation rate, surface structure, etc.), which will in turn provide constraints for surface features’ formation timescales. It is unknown whether there might be craters, depressions, layers, regolith, or boulders present – these could provide unique insights into early surface evolution. Do primordial small bodies display a singular primordial surface type, or do they show surface diversity at different size scales? Any impact crater population might provide an unmodified record of early bombardment in the Solar System, as few impacts are expected in the OC. This will give a unique insight into the early Solar System’s accretion processes and the characteristics of primordial small planetesimals.\n\nAll comets already visited by spacecraft have undergone shape changes through sublimation and specific surface evolution processes during repeated perihelion passages. Recent results suggest that bi-lobate nuclei are common (e.g., Giotto, Rosetta, and other Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) missions). A comparison between a Long-Period Comet, LPC, and New Horizons studies of 486958 Arrokoth will be particularly instructive, as both these volatile-rich bodies are largely unaltered since formation, but have likely formed and subsequently resided in different Solar System contexts. An LPC (and even more-so a Dynamically-New Comet, DNC) would have experienced few changes due to insolation in recent times, when compared to JFCs, but could have had significant processing earlier in its lifetime. Characterisation of the difference and similarities will be invaluable, examining surface morphology and comparing to comets imaged by previous missions. In addition to this, composition measurements of a primordial surface, in comparison with Rosetta results, may tell us about chemical processing as comets evolve.\n\nThe Origin of Different Classes of Comet Nuclei\n\nComets of all kinds formed in the outer part of the Solar System’s protoplanetary disc, where ices could condense, and the giant planets also formed. As these planets settled into their final orbits, the small bodies in this region were scattered to form the various comet reservoirs that we know today: the Scattered Disc of the Kuiper Belt (KB), the source of low-inclination JFCs; the OC at the edge of the Solar System, which supplies the population of LPCs; and the recently identified probable reservoir of icy bodies in the main asteroid belt that occasionally show activity as Main Belt Comets. The taxonomy of Levison (1996) splits comets into low-inclination ‘Ecliptic’ comets from the KB, of which JFCs are the dominant subset, and ‘Nearly Isotropic Comets’ (NICs), which can have any inclination, including highly retrograde orbits, from the OC (Fig. ). NICs are subdivided into the LPCs (orbital periods >200 years) and the Halley Type Comets (HTCs) with shorter periods. There is some debate on the origin of HTCs, with competing models suggesting that these can also come from the Scattered Disc (e.g., Levison et al. 2006; Wang and Brasser 2014; Fernández et al. 2016, and Nesvorný et al. 2017). LPCs can be further divided into DNCs and returning comets, depending on whether or not a previous perihelion distance that an object had was thought to be within the planetary region.\n\nPlanetary systems naturally scatter and eject most of the planetesimals that they form from their primordial discs of dust and gas. These planetesimals travel the Galaxy as interstellar objects (ISOs).\n\nIt was thought that the OC was primarily populated by bodies that formed near to Jupiter and Saturn, while the objects that would populate the KB formed more or less in situ at their current distances from the Sun (e.g., Dones et al. 2004; Duncan and Levison 1997), but modern thinking suggests a broader mixing of comets from different original locations in the protoplanetary disc being scattered to the various reservoirs (e.g., Dones et al. 2015). Results from the Stardust mission showed that material that must have formed in the warmer regions in the inner Solar System was incorporated into comets, suggesting widespread mixing within the disc (Brownlee 2014). It is therefore likely that all Solar System comets have broadly similar initial properties (although perhaps differing in composition, especially at an isotopic level, depending on where the majority of their component ices condensed from gas; see Sect. 2.2.4 and Rubin et al. 2020 for details). What we can expect to be different between JFCs (and perhaps HTCs) and LPCs is the degree to which they have subsequently evolved: the more distant OC stored comets in a colder environment (∼10 K vs. ∼40 K in the KB; Weissman et al. 2020), and LPCs (and especially DNCs) enter the inner Solar System directly from this cold reservoir, while JFCs have evolved through a period (∼104 years) in the Centaur region (Volk and Malhotra 2008), with orbits between the giant planets, where significant activity can be expected to modify at least the surface layers. As such, even a ‘new’ JFC can be expected to be significantly modified from its primitive state, while LPCs should retain largely similar properties from the time that they were first ejected into the OC (discussed in more detail in Sect. 2.2.5).\n\nThe motivation for a mission to a less evolved comet is clear: new comets retain, to some degree, the properties of the building blocks of planets, and are at least highly primitive bodies, essentially unaltered since their ejection into their respective reservoirs, expect for cosmic ray processing, e.g. Garrod (2019). How much processing comets underwent during their formation in the disc, prior to ejection, is the subject of considerable debate (see, e.g., Weissman et al. 2020) and another reason to visit a comet from the OC, which retains the surface properties from the last interactions it had before ejection. There are two main theories of comet formation still under consideration following Rosetta, both of which are supported by evidence from the mission, but neither is entirely satisfactory. These are hierarchical accretion (e.g., Davidsson et al. 2016) and accretion of ‘pebbles’ by streaming instabilities (e.g., Blum et al. 2017). Both make predictions for the size scale of typical constituent building blocks of comets, and both sets of scale in features can be found in Rosetta data. Whether or not these features are primordial or evolutionary is the key question to advance this debate. There is also considerable interest in the question of how many collisions cometary nuclei have undergone, and the effects that these collisions would have on the properties of their ices, focussing on the period before the comets were ejected from the disc to their reservoirs. While the OC is so vast that collisions between bodies after ejection are virtually impossible, Jutzi et al. (2017) and Schwartz et al. (2018) both show that collisions large enough to alter the bulk shape of nuclei (perhaps forming the typical bilobed structure seen in many comets) were almost impossible to avoid in the disc prior to ejection. Investigating a comet that has not been significantly further altered since its last pre-ejection collision would be of great value to better constrain these models, and reveal how much these collisions locally alter material, compared with the (supposed) unaltered nucleus ices further from the collision site(s).\n\nBulk Properties\n\nThe current understanding of the bulk properties of comet nuclei is a result of both remote telescope observations and spacecraft visits. Spacecraft in situ observations provide precise measurements of the physical properties of individual nuclei. On the other hand, telescopes both in the optical and in the thermal infrared allow the coarse characterization of numerous nuclei, therefore enabling population studies. One of the easiest to constrain nucleus properties is size. Since the effective radius of comet nuclei (the radius of a sphere having the same volume as the comet nucleus) can in principle be derived from single-epoch observations, the sizes of over 200 comets have been determined (Knight et al. 2023). This large database reveals a broad diversity of comet sizes: from hundreds of metres to a few tens of km (see Fig. ) and has been used to derive the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of comets. The SFD of comet nuclei is believed to bear evidence of the processes involved in their formation and subsequent collisional and/or activity-driven evolution. De-biased Comet SFD studies show interesting trends indicating that the average size of LPCs is larger than that of JFCs (Bauer et al. 2017). Yet important questions such as whether there is a paucity of objects smaller than 2 km (see Bauer et al. 2017) and whether comets are a collisionally evolved population remain unresolved (see Weissman et al. 2020).\n\nAnother parameter broadly used to analyse the formation and evolution of comet nuclei is shape. The shapes of six nuclei have been studied in detail from in situ observations. The observations from the Rosetta mission to 67P stand out with their unprecedented resolution, which enabled a global 3D shape model with resolution down to metre scale (Preusker et al. 2017). In at least eight exceptional cases in which the comets approached the Earth sufficiently and could thus be observed by radar, shape models could be constructed (see Knight et al. 2023). For other comets, however, nucleus shapes can only be studied in terms of elongation. Measuring the peak-to-peak amplitude of the rotational lightcurve, Δm, provides a lower limit of the axial ratio of a/b of the comet nucleus. In principle it is possible to derive convex shape models of comet nuclei, provided that the comets are observed at a wide variety of different observing geometries, but this technique has so far only been applied to 67P in preparation for Rosetta (Lowry et al. 2012). Compiling elongation estimates from the different methods, Kokotanekova et al. (2017) determined a median axial ratio of a/b = 1.5 for JFCs, similar to the previous estimates from Lamy et al. (2004) and Snodgrass et al. (2011). As it can be seen in Fig. , the measured minimum a/b spans a range of ∼1.0 to >3.0. The largest known axial ratio belongs to 103P (Thomas et al. 2013) which is one of the four comet nuclei visited by spacecraft that has a bilobate shape (the others are 1P Keller et al. 1986, 19P Britt et al. 2004; Oberst et al. 2004 and 67P Sierks et al. 2015). Moreover, the radar observations of 8P are also best modelled by assuming a contact binary shape (Harmon et al. 2010). This noticeable overabundance of highly elongated/bilobate objects in comparison to other small-body populations suggests some important difference in formation and/or evolutionary processes, which has not yet been fully explained. Whether or not the first LPC nucleus to be imaged in situ also shows a contact binary morphology will provide an important constraint on this question, and point to whether it is more likely attributable to a formation or an evolutionary process.\n\nRosetta’s observations were also the first to enable the characterization of 67P’s opposition effect; the non-linear increase of its phase function close to α=0∘ (Fornasier et al. 2015; Masoumzadeh et al. 2017; Hasselmann et al. 2017). Few of the other comets visited by spacecraft, or observed remotely from the ground, have been observed close to opposition and all other comet phase curves are well described by linear phase functions. It is possible that the phase function slope at moderate phase angles (α ∼5–60∘) can be used to reveal the level of erosion of the comet surface (see Longobardo et al. 2017; Kokotanekova et al. 2018; Vincent 2019). It remains to be seen if this also applies to LPCs, with very different surface evolutions, as all phase function data so far is on JFCs.\n\nIt is important to note that the average colours of JFCs, LPCs and dormant comets are indistinguishable within the uncertainties for each class (Jewitt 2015). Finally, Rosetta has revealed that the surface spectrum of 67P changes as the comet passes through perihelion due to the comet’s seasonal water-ice cycle: the nucleus’ mean spectral slope changed by ∼30% or 50% (Fornasier et al. 2016; Filacchione et al. 2020). Polarimetric studies of comet surfaces have not yet been performed during a spacecraft visit. There are only two JFCs for which polarisation studies from the ground have been published, 2P/Encke (Boehnhardt et al. 2008) and 209P/LINEAR (Kuroda et al. 2015). These data are too limited to extract any general conclusions about the bulk polarisation properties of comet nuclei besides pointing out the similarities of these two comets and known dark asteroids (Kiselev et al. 2015).\n\nThermal properties dictate the temperature distribution throughout the nucleus, and are thus key to describe physical and chemical processes occurring in response to solar illumination. The thermal inertia of a comet nucleus, for instance, drives its ability to adapt its temperature to a change in local insolation. A material with a large thermal inertia takes longer to adapt its temperature to changing illumination conditions compared to a material with low thermal inertia. Low thermal inertia – and therefore low thermal conductivity – means that the interior of nuclei remains cold when the surface is heated by the Sun, and can therefore retain more volatile ices (i.e., can be more ‘pristine’). Estimates for comets made from spatially unresolved observations of the nucleus allowed a value lower than 50 JK−1m−2s−1/2 to be derived. Owing to spacecraft flybys in the 2000s, thermal inertia has since been derived from radiance measurements, from which temperature can be inferred, on the surface with spatially resolved maps of comets 9P, 103P and 67P. They point toward a low thermal inertia, between 50 and 200 JK−1m−2s−1/2 for 9P (Davidsson et al. 2013), and less than 250 JK−1m−2s−1/2 for 103P (Groussin et al. 2013). The suite of instruments on-board Rosetta indicates that 67P’s thermal inertia is between 5 and 350 JK−1m−2s−1/2 (Leyrat and Blain 2015). It varies across the surface (Leyrat and Blain 2015), perhaps due to variations in material properties such as density or porosity, between consolidated and unconsolidated terrains. Additional estimates in the near-subsurface were possible, down to 1 and 4 cm below the surface: they point to a thermal inertia of the order of 10 to 60 JK−1m−2s−1/2, and lower than 80 JK−1m−2s−1/2 (Gulkis et al. 2015; Choukroun et al. 2015; Schloerb et al. 2015; Marshall et al. 2018). Finally, the MUPUS measurement at the landing site of Philae suggests a local thermal inertia of the order of 120 JK−1m−2s−1/2 (Groussin et al. 2019). These thermal inertia estimates depend strongly on the model used to derive them: they should be taken only as an indication that cometary material close to the surface has a low thermal inertia.\n\nIndeed, temperatures are not directly measured with remote sensing instruments, but rather the infrared or sub-mm flux is detected, or the brightness temperature is measured. The kinetic temperature, which gives information on thermal properties of a surface, must be retrieved through models. Measurements in the near infrared can be contaminated by reflected solar radiation (Keihm et al. 2012). Instruments detect a nonlinear average of potentially very different temperatures in the field of view, with large and small-scale topographic features and perhaps compositional heterogeneities. On Rosetta, MIRO measurements were affected by both the thermal and the optical properties of the material, which made the interpretation challenging. A yet larger caveat comes from the lack of a thermal infrared instrument on the Rosetta payload. Lower limits for the temperature derived from VIRTIS-M were effectively restricted to the dayside of the nucleus (Tosi et al. 2019). Kinetic temperatures over complete diurnal cycles and for the same layer could not be retrieved, and thermal inertia maps were derived with large error bars (Groussin et al. 2019). Resolved images of both the day and night sides in the thermal infrared are required to put stronger constraints on thermal models of cometary nuclei.\n\nMorphology of Nuclei\n\nAs cometary surfaces are almost impossible to resolve in Earth-based observations, our information about surface morphology of comets is based on flyby or orbital missions (with Rosetta currently the only mission to orbit around a comet for a prolonged amount of time). Figure shows the shape and general morphology of all of the comets that have been imaged in situ. It is useful to draw comparisons between the morphologies observed on comets (mostly JFCs) and Arrokoth, the cold classical KBO visited by NASA’s New Horizons Mission in 2019. Whereas Arrokoth signifies a nearly primordial body characterised by low colour diversity, uniform textures, lack of topographical complexity, and a general lack of putative impact craters, circular features overall, or evidence of tectonics (McKinnon et al. 2020), comets that have spent a significant amount of their life in the inner Solar System display clear evidence of surface evolution and overall weathering as is demonstrated by the higher degrees of surface roughness, topographical complexity, morphological diversity of terrains, and presence of smooth regions suggestive of weathered and eroded fine-scale materials (e.g., Keller et al. 1986; Britt et al. 2004; A’Hearn et al. 2005, 2011; Veverka et al. 2013; Sierks et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2015).\n\nRosetta demonstrated how activity caused by seasonal sublimation of volatiles (mostly water-ice but also other types of ice), as comets cross the snow-line during the perihelion part of their orbit, can account for various fine-scale morphology on cometary surfaces, with clear evidence of seasonal evolution, e.g., El-Maarry et al. (2017, 2019). However, it is unlikely that major landscape evolution occurs that way, at least on seasonal scales (El-Maarry et al. 2017): seasonal erosion causes changes on scales of order 1–10 m, while there are pits (Fig. , left) approximately 100 m in diameter, and the cliff (Fig. , right) above the ‘neck’ region between the two lobes of 67P is around a kilometre high.\n\nTherefore, we can treat or consider JFCs, and KBOs such as Arrokoth, as two opposite end-member points in a spectrum of bodies in varying stages of evolution. Visiting a more pristine LPC would add a pivotal midpoint across that evolutionary path that can further explain how primordial KBOs transition to heavily evolved comets, and at which stage major landscape processes occur. JFCs go through a transitional “Centaur” phase as their orbits dynamically evolve to shorter orbits that place them in the inner Solar System. It is possible that comets undergo substantial changes during that time as hypervolatiles can sublimate beyond the water ice snowline. However, the degree of that change is currently unknown. A major question that can be answered by Comet Interceptor is where would LPCs, or generally comets that have not gone close to the Sun many times in their lifetime, place in that evolutionary path? Would they be closer in morphology to KBOs, or would they have developed some morphological and textural variety already during their early formation stages (see Sect. 2.2.6 below)? Do they show evidence for collisions before their ejection to the OC, and if so, what record do they retain of the primordial impactor population (e.g., crater size distribution)? Therefore, the possibility to encounter and investigate either an LPC, or especially a DNC, would offer more insights to the evolutionary path of comets and the conditions in the early Solar System more generally.\n\nComposition of Nuclei\n\nMost of our knowledge on the composition of comets comes from measurements (either in situ by spacecraft, or remotely via spectroscopy) of the gas coma, which is discussed in detail in the coma science section below (see Sect. 2.3). Broadly, we understand the composition of nucleus ices indirectly, by working backwards from sublimated gasses in the coma, or from the products of further gas phase photochemistry. However, direct measurement of the nucleus composition is of great importance to comet science:\n\nto discover the starting point for these sublimation/ chemistry models,\n\nto understand how (in)homogeneous the nucleus is,\n\nand to assess the composition of the original building blocks of comets (and planets) independent of our (lack of) understanding of evolution and activity processes.\n\nWe are limited to measurements of the surface composition, as the only attempt to directly measure the interior composition of a comet nucleus, the SD2 drill on the Philae lander, failed to collect a sample (Boehnhardt et al. 2017). Mass spectroscopy results for surface dust returned by Philae were inconclusive, but did show a high proportion of organic compounds (Boehnhardt et al. 2017), consistent with remote sensing measurements. As discussed in Sect. 2.2.3 above, spectroscopy, both unresolved from telescopic observations and resolved from spacecraft encounters, reveals comet nuclei to be largely featureless in the visible and near infrared, with reddish slopes (but shallower than many KBOs) and very low albedo (e.g., Quirico et al. 2016). A broad 3.2 μm absorption was identified by the Rosetta VIRTIS instrument at 67P, which has been interpreted in a variety of ways, including salts, organic compounds, and/or silicates (Poch et al. 2020; Raponi et al. 2020; Mennella et al. 2020). Features due to water ice are, perhaps surprisingly, limited in their presence, but detected at comet 9P (Sunshine et al. 2006). They are only seen in Rosetta data in localised spots (Barucci et al. 2016; Fornasier et al. 2023), where fresh subsurface layers (e.g., Fig. ) have been uncovered (e.g., by cliff collapse; Filacchione et al. 2016a), or as short-lived frosts deposited during the comet night time (De Sanctis et al. 2015)). A region of CO2 ice was also identified at 67P (Filacchione et al. 2016b). Nuclei are mostly too faint to be detected at shorter and longer wavelengths from Earth-based observations, but UV spectroscopy from the Alice instrument on-board Rosetta revealed a featureless blue slope (Feaga et al. 2015). At sub-mm wavelengths, Rosetta/MIRO could only constrain nucleus thermal emission, not give compositional information. Unresolved mid-infrared spectroscopy with the Spitzer space telescope shows broad features attributed to silicates, with similarities to D-type asteroids and Jupiter Trojans (Kelley et al. 2017). Spacecraft observations, made in situ at these wavelengths, have yet to be attempted, but are a promising direction to take. These wavelengths contain a wide array of features seen in common minerals and organic ices, and could reveal both composition and its variation across the nucleus surface, in resolved spectroscopy and/or imaging.\n\nEvolution of Cometary Nuclei\n\nBoth the mechanical and thermal processing of comet nuclei (Weissman et al. 2020) occur during distinct phases of a nucleus’s life, e.g.:\n\nduring formation and early evolution in the protoplanetary disc.\n\nduring the long period of storage in the comet reservoirs.\n\nand as an active comet upon return to the inner Solar System.\n\nThe active comet phase is the one that is best understood, following the results from Rosetta, as the evolution of the nucleus is driven entirely by the comet’s activity and therefore by the energy it receives from the Sun. Erosion of the surface has long been understood as a consequence of sublimation of nucleus ices, with metres of the surface lost, on average, per perihelion passage (e.g., Whipple 1950; Britt et al. 2004; Veverka et al. 2013; Keller et al. 2015). However, a surprising result from the Rosetta mission was the importance of fall-back of material lifted into the inner coma, with some areas of the nucleus blanketed by deep layers of fine material (e.g., Thomas et al. 2015; Marschall et al. 2020; Cambianica et al. 2021). In models of the nucleus consisting of pebbles, fall-back of decimetre-sized chunks leads to both surface morphology changes (Fig. ) and evolution of near-surface composition, as subsequent activity from the fall-back material is driven by water ice retained within these ‘chunks’, which have a lower abundance of the more volatile ices whose activity lifted the chunks from other areas in the first place (Fulle et al. 2020a). The many cycles of activity seen by short period comets mean that their surfaces have undergone significant evolution, while an LPC encountered at 1 au will have relatively little recent evolution, depending on where exactly its activity began on the inbound leg (models range from 35 to 85 au; Jewitt et al. 2021; Fulle et al. 2020b), and on model-dependent levels of erosion and fall-back during this time.\n\nThe earliest phase in comet evolution, which the nuclei spent in their formation zone at 5–30 au, could last anywhere from 2.5 to several hundred million years (various models have different timing for the instabilities in the giant planet orbits that scattered comets into their reservoirs, e.g., Nesvorný et al. 2018; Morbidelli et al. 2018; Pirani et al. 2019, 2021). The OC could not have been populated while the Sun was still in its embedded star cluster phase – whose duration was perhaps a few Myr (e.g., Adams 2010; Pfalzner and Vincke 2020; Parker 2020) – because the Sun’s tidal radius was too small (Tremaine and Dones 1993; Wyatt et al. 2017). When it comes to the survival of volatile species, this phase is significant: Davidsson (2021) reports that nuclei in the protoplanetary disc with diameters ranging from 4 to 200 km can lose all their condensed CO ice on short timescales (smaller than the minimum time to eject them in the reservoirs), through a combination of protosolar and long–lived radionuclide heating. This may have been avoided if cometesimals formed late enough (Davidsson et al. 2016), or in a region of the disc with relatively low abundance of radionuclides, which has been suggested by some observations (e.g., analysis of four Stardust samples indicate that 81P never contained any appreciable 26Al; Levasseur-Regourd et al. 2018). The drivers of evolution in this phase can also be expected to include collisions (Jutzi et al. 2017; Schwartz et al. 2018), although models of the timescales for CO-driven cometary activity suggest that erosion of ice-rich cometesimals in this early environment could dominate evolution over collisions (Fulle et al. 2020b).\n\nSubsequently, and because the time of residence in the OC or the KB is very long, a significant fraction of the bulk of most comet nuclei can be affected by superficial heat sources, even if the thermal diffusivity is extremely low. Davidsson (2021) reported that, for objects large enough to have any pure condensed CO ice remaining in their bulk when they are ejected in their reservoirs, the long-term survival of supervolatile ices largely depends on whether nuclei are scattered in the OC, or in the KB. Indeed, objects reaching the OC could get subsurface temperatures low enough for CO gas, if diffusing from the deep interior, where it was heated due to radiogenic decay, to condense near the surface. In the KB, the equilibrium temperature ranges from 30 to 50 K, so that, for objects typically smaller than 4 km, all hypervolatiles initially present as pure ices should sublimate during the time of residence in this reservoir, even without any radiogenic heating (De Sanctis et al. 2001; Choi et al. 2002; Jewitt 2004; Davidsson 2021).\n\nWe emphasize again that, for OC comets, the thermal processing prior to the injection in this reservoir does not guarantee that a nucleus stored there can preserve a pristine inventory of hypervolatiles. In terms of internal structure expected for OC comets, Davidsson (2021) suggests that any nuclei exposed to the proto-Sun’s intense heating would lose not only hypervolatiles condensed as pure ices, but also CO2, down to a depth of ∼30 m. In addition, partial crystallization could occur in the upper ∼200 m. As a consequence, the near-surface layers of a comet nucleus may be significantly processed: even DNCs cannot be completely pristine, and some might have lost a significant amount of hypervolatiles prior to their scattering into the OC. In addition, Stern and Shull (1988) suggest that up to 20% of comet nuclei stored in the OC could have been heated to at least 30 K down to several dozen metres below the surface, due to the passage of luminous stars during the history of the Solar System. Most of them may have been heated to 45 K in the uppermost 1 m-layer due to stochastic supernovae events. This would lead to the formation of a surface layer depleted in hypervolatiles. Stern (2003) further reports that passing stars and supernovae heating events could modify the primordial composition of comet nuclei down to 5 to 50 m (for heating due to passing stars), and to 0.1 to 2 m (for heating due to supernovae events).\n\nHowever, an extremely significant difference between JFCs and DNCs coming from the OC lies in their subsequent orbital evolution, which brings them to the orbits on which we observe them. Indeed, an intermediate evolution phase exists almost exclusively for Centaurs, of which a fraction become JFCs, during which comet nuclei are perturbed into their final orbit through a chaotic orbital evolution in the giant planet region. Processing during this phase intensifies, due to increasing equilibrium temperatures, and close passages to massive planets. Because the time spent in the giant planet region is significant (typically 10 Myr, Levison and Duncan 1997; Tiscareno and Malhotra 2003) the resulting processing is also substantial. This phase is non-existent for nuclei coming from the OC, which come from this reservoir to the inner Solar System in a more rapid and direct pathway.\n\nHuebner et al. (2006) discussed the outcomes of such different injection types, which may result in extensive changes of the internal composition and structure of comets. Similarities between the structures resulting from the two types of orbital evolution are:\n\nSurface temperatures, driven by the surface heat balance, and\n\nWater and CO2 gas production, which are controlled by erosion, keeping both water and CO2 ice close to the surface.\n\nHowever, the significant differences resulting from the two orbital evolutions are mostly related to the location of the CO sublimation front (and hypervolatiles in general), and the amorphous/crystalline ice interface. The CO sublimation front for JFCs should be located hundreds of metres below the surface, while it remains very close to the surface for DNCs. In terms of activity, this is reflected in the fact that CO production is typically continuous for JFCs, or at least with a pattern which does not follow the water emission, and the production rate for the JFC nucleus is significantly smaller (ten times lower in their example) than for a DNC. Water and CO2 sublimation remain, however, characterized by peak emissions towards the perihelion of each orbit. The simulations reported in Huebner et al. (2006) also showed the formation of a transient dust mantle, which was destroyed when the last orbital change occurred.\n\nIn conclusion, any comet nucleus coming from the OC would be significantly less altered and more informative of the processes that shaped the Solar System in its early phases, when compared to the JFCs explored in space thus far.\n\nTheme 2: Comet Environment Science\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis theme focuses on the coma, looking to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat is the composition of the gas and dust in the coma?\n\nHow does it connect to the nucleus (i.e., how does cometary activity work)?\n\nWhat is the nature of its interaction with the solar wind?\n\nThese topics are addressed through observations of the gas, dust and plasma that are described in the subsections below. They are linked to each other, and also to the studies of the nucleus described in the previous section, through the processes of cometary activity; ices sublimating to gas, and lifting dust, followed by the decoupling of these and the photochemistry that generates the products we observe on large-scales. Data from telescopic observations and previous space missions have given us clues to understand all of these steps, but many puzzles remain. Measuring the composition and distribution of volatile species in the coma will help in understanding the activity processes of an LPC compared with the more evolved objects visited to date:\n\nWhat are the relative abundances of molecules of high volatility such as CH4, CO and CO2 with respect to water in an LPC versus JFCs (67P) and HTCs (1P) at similar heliocentric distances?\n\nIs there evidence for or against hyperactivity, i.e., significant activity being driven by sublimation from icy ‘chunks’ in the coma, as seen at 103P by EPOXI?\n\nAre there differences in isotopic composition, e.g., in D/H, and other species if sufficiently abundant?\n\nFor each of these questions, Comet Interceptor will test whether or not the phenomenon is evolution-related, and will inform the interpretation of ground-based observations of other comets. Comet Interceptor will also perform unique observations of the coma from three different positions simultaneously, due to its multispacecraft configuration. This will allow gas, dust, and plasma distributions or boundaries to be described in a 3-D way. This was not possible with previous missions, which sampled only a single location at a time, and will allow separation of spatial and temporal variations. The multipoint in situ plasma measurements will be complemented by Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations, which may provide a more continuous observation of the variability of the solar wind, giving a clearer picture of which plasma variations are due to external influences.\n\nBulk and Isotopic Composition, and Distribution of Gas and Dust\n\nThe bulk of our knowledge of the composition of comets comes from studying the gas coma. Remote observations give a comparatively less detailed picture but of a larger number of comets, while in situ measurements with mass spectrometers, in particular from Rosetta, have revealed a wealth of detail of just a few. Unfortunately, there have not been any good opportunities yet to link these approaches. Although a campaign of remote observations did support Rosetta (Snodgrass et al. 2017), 67P was not particularly bright around its 2015 perihelion and could not be studied with high resolution spectroscopy, for example. The comet also presented a poor observation geometry, being located on the other side of the Sun with respect to Earth. Much of our knowledge of comet composition (especially on an isotopic level) from telescopes is based on LPCs, which are often more active and brighter. A mission to a bright LPC would present an opportunity to compare high resolution spectroscopy at a range of wavelengths with in situ mass spectrometry measurements, calibrating our understanding of the much wider observed population. Modern infrared and sub-mm facilities, such as the ESO Very Large Telescope and the other 8–10 m class telescopes, and the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array, which did not exist at the time of Giotto, are suitable for observing molecular species thought to be directly released from the nucleus.\n\nIt is well established that within about 3AU from the Sun the main driver of cometary activity is the sublimation of water ice. At larger distances, more volatile species like CO or CO2 are likely to play a major role (e.g., Meech et al. 2017). There remains a lot of uncertainty about where and how the transition between driving species takes place, and whether or not there are differences in this between new and returning comets. It has long been observed that DNCs tend to be brighter (more active) than periodic comets (the ‘fading problem’: Oort 1950; Dones et al. 2004); the most significant difference between DNCs and returning comets appears to be greater activity at larger distances in the former population, which implies different driving species (Meech and Svoren 2004). Comet Interceptor will measure the absolute and relative densities of the main neutral volatiles (H2O, CO, and CO2) along the flyby trajectory, allowing us to derive production rates from these measurements, and show which is dominant in an LPC at ∼1 au.\n\nAlthough ground-based composition observations do not rival the comprehensive information that can be provided by in situ spacecraft measurements, remote observations still provide extremely valuable data on bulk composition (e.g., Fig. ). Differences of composition between JFCs and more pristine comets coming from the OC are starting to emerge from ground-based observations, with the most highly volatile species (such as CO, CH4, C2H6, and C2H2) being depleted in JFCs compared to OCCs (Dello Russo et al. 2016). However, this has not been confirmed in situ. Ground-based observations of highly volatile molecules in infrared/radio domains are rarely simultaneous: for example, CO in the M-band and other organics in the L-band are not observed simultaneously, although most species are usually observed with H2O, or its proxy OH, to derive mixing ratios with respect to H2O. This makes the measurement and comparison of relative abundances difficult in some cases, especially for data taken by old-fashioned infrared spectrometers. A large dispersion of mixing ratios observed in ground-based observations might be partially explained by such non-simultaneous observations. Comet Interceptor will provide an unprecedented opportunity to measure gas composition in situ and compare the abundance of molecules of high volatility such as CO, CH4, C2H6, and CO2 with respect to water in an LPC versus JFCs (67P) and evolved HTCs (1P).\n\nAside from the volatiles mentioned above, Comet Interceptor will make detailed compositional measurements that are only possible in situ. The Rosetta spacecraft revealed the presence of complex and diverse organic molecules in the coma of 67P, including key species for prebiotic chemistry, some being observed in the coma of a comet for the first time (see Altwegg et al. 2017a). These organics cannot be detected through ground-based observations with current technology, preventing us from assessing the variation of their abundances between comets and, in particular, between primitive LPCs and processed JFCs. Obtaining an inventory of (complex) organic molecules and other species important in prebiotic chemistry in a primitive LPC will delve further into the role of comets in transporting organic matter to the early Earth (Marty et al. 2016). A surprising result of Rosetta was the abundant molecular oxygen observed in the coma (Bieler et al. 2015b), while circumstantial evidence for O2 was also found in comet 1P (Rubin et al. 2015). Several formation mechanisms have been discussed, from radiation of water ice and cold temperature chemistry in the ISM, to various in situ formation mechanisms. Comet Interceptor will assess how ubiquitous O2 is in comets: a more pristine LPC or DNC target will narrow down possible formation mechanisms (cf. Luspay-Kuti et al. 2018). Evidence of ammonium salts in 67P found by Rosetta (Altwegg et al. 2020) was also unexpected and may change the traditional view of species parentage and how molecules are stored in cometary ices; for example, NH4CN (if present in the coma) can produce NH3 and HCN, which were previously believed to be “parent” molecules released directly from the nucleus.\n\nIsotopic ratios, being very sensitive to physico-chemical conditions, provide crucial information on the provenance of cometary material, and therefore provide information for comet and planet formation models. For instance, the D/H ratio in cometary water has been used to infer whether or not comets could be a source of the water on Earth (Hartogh et al. 2011). To date, all comets with known D/H either exhibit a terrestrial ratio or an elevated ratio (Altwegg et al. 2017b). A recent study suggests two distinct sources of water with different D/H: one source on the surface of the nucleus and the other in the form of sublimating icy grains in the coma (Lis et al. 2019). Fulle (2021) models these observations with ‘pebbles’ of different ice content. Depending on the type of the activity of the target comet, Comet Interceptor may obtain measurements of both reservoirs during the flyby. The D/H ratio of a less evolved object may furthermore give some insight into outgassing-related fractionation processes. These measurements will also help in interpreting differences or similarities between remote and in situ D/H measurements, in particular if simultaneous measurements can be made from the ground, which is likely to be the case if Comet Interceptor’s target is a relatively bright LPC, as expected. Measurement of the 18O/16O in H2O by Rosetta revealed an enrichment in 18O compared to the terrestrial value (Altwegg et al. 2019). Models of chemical evolution in the protoplanetary disc or natal molecular cloud of our Solar System do not yet explain these results, and demonstrate the value of isotopic measurements in furthering our understanding of the topic of planetary system formation in general (Hily-Blant et al. 2017; Wirström and Charnley 2018; Furuya and Aikawa 2018). Even though D/H is the primary objective, if the target is sufficiently active, Comet Interceptor will investigate isotopes in other species including, e.g.: 18O/16O in H2O, 13C/12C in CO2, and 34S/32S in OCS and CS2.\n\nMany pre-solar signatures have been observed in the isotopes of volatiles in 67P (Hoppe et al. 2018). Similar bulk abundances of volatile molecules were observed in Comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp and 67P, and within objects in the ISM (Bockelée-Morvan et al. 2000; Drozdovskaya et al. 2019). The detailed in situ measurement of an LPC or a DNC will probe the potential locations of origin of its ices at a molecular, elemental, and isotopic level.\n\nSpatial Distribution and Structures of the Neutral Gas Coma\n\nThe spatial distribution of volatiles in the coma is of particular interest as it can provide information on how the ices are distributed in the nucleus. However, this aspect is a difficult issue to address. Ground-based observations only allow mapping of the distribution of volatiles on very large scales, missing the crucial transition region between the nucleus and the inner coma. As Rosetta orbited the comet for an extended period, it built up maps of coma composition of mother and daughter species at much smaller scales above different areas (Fig. ). Rosetta confirmed that comets have heterogeneous comas dominated by large fluctuations in composition, often linked to diurnal and seasonal variations in the major outgassing species such as H2O, CO2, and CO (e.g., Hässig et al. 2015). A general large-scale anticorrelation between H2O and CO2 was observed by Rosetta (e.g., Mall et al. 2016; Migliorini et al. 2016). The gas density in the coma is strongly affected by nucleus concavities and sun illumination conditions, even when the distribution of ices on the nucleus surface is quite uniform (Bieler et al. 2015,b).\n\nSeparate but simultaneous measurements from spatially distributed sub-spacecraft will provide snapshots of different coma regions at the time of flyby. This method actually has advantages over Rosetta’s approach, as it will allow, for the first time, separation of spatial and temporal variations. Interpretation of Rosetta results instead requires complex models to understand how the comet changed with time and space, because measurements of different coma areas were taken at different places and times along Rosetta’s orbit. The unique multi-spacecraft architecture of Comet Interceptor will allow the addressing of important questions on how dynamic effects in the coma relate to each other: Which are due to the changing position of the spacecraft relative to the nucleus, and which to the comet’s time-varying behaviour? (cf. Hansen et al. 2016).\n\nDust Coma\n\nThe refractory component of the comet coma is referred to as ‘dust’. It is made up of minerals and organic components lifted from the surface with sizes ranging from sub-micron to metre-scale chunks. The properties of the dust are important to understanding comet composition and formation. For example, the similarity in size of the dominant particles in 67P’s coma and those predicted to form planets via streaming instability was used to argue in favour of that model, assuming that particles reflect the original size distribution (Blum et al. 2017). Measuring the dust size distribution down to nm size in an LPC will provide some information towards testing the universality of this assumption: if it is similar to JFCs it would imply a link with primordial dust distribution, and support streaming instability models, whereas a difference would imply that comet material has been processed at μm scales and that dust properties reveal evolutionary processes.\n\nWhether or not solid material lifted from the comet’s surface also contains ice is important for our understanding of activity processes, as sublimation from dust in the coma could form a distributed source of water or other gasses. Rosetta found that little water is provided by sublimation from particles beyond a few nucleus radii, so there is no significant distributed source for water at 67P. That does not preclude distributed sources for minor constituents: for instance, evidence has been found for a distributed source for the hydrogen halides (De Keyser et al. 2017) and some of the lesser volatiles including organics (Altwegg et al. 2016, 2017a). This is in stark contrast to the earlier EPOXI flyby of comet 103P (A’Hearn et al. 2011) and remote observations of the innermost coma of comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, where a significant fraction of the outgassing occurred from a distributed source of icy grains (Fougere et al. 2012, 2013). Still, assessing the existence of a distributed source is difficult, even during a fast flyby where one can consider gas and dust production to be basically constant: cometocentric longitude, latitude, and distance all change simultaneously, and therefore it is not straightforward to extract purely radial density profiles from which one can ascertain the existence of a distributed source. To detect and identify distributed sources, it is necessary to scan a very large range of radial distances and, simultaneously, to assess the dust and gas abundances at a minimum of two points in the coma: again, the multi-point architecture of Comet Interceptor will give it a unique advantage in addressing this question. Constraining the dust-to-ice ratio in the coma (individually for icy particles, or in bulk by comparison of dust and gas production rates), and by inference in the nucleus, will also provide information for planet formation models. The question of how much ice is present in larger chunks in the coma is a critical parameter to understand the overall dust-to-ice ratio within a comet, which is a very important number to constrain the properties of the formation location of the comet, and one that is still the subject of intense debate following Rosetta (see, e.g., Fulle et al. 2019; Choukroun et al. 2020). Measurements at a less evolved LPC would be very valuable to understand this intrinsic ratio.\n\nDust Reflectance Properties\n\nGround-based observations of the intensity, colour, and degree of linear polarisation of light scattered by cometary dust particles are used extensively for retrieving information on their physical properties, including their morphology and structure, as defined by Güttler et al. (2019) (Fig. ). However, they are usually limited to certain observational geometries. Observations from spacecraft offer the opportunity to sample a wider range of geometries at a single time, from within the comet’s coma. The analysis of the Rosetta dataset has exposed challenging contradictions between the properties of cometary dust as modelled from ground-based and from in situ observations. The Rosetta OSIRIS camera system provided unique observations of the intensity of light scattered by dust within 67P’s coma (Bertini et al. 2017). The observed phase functions show a peculiar U-shape with a minimum at a phase angle around 100∘ (compared with the minimum at ∼55∘ in the Halley-Marcus function. Those data would indicate the presence of large grains. Further, ground-based observations of the degree of linear polarisation of 67P show a negative polarisation branch (NPB) at small phase angles and a maximum observed DLP (Degree of Linear Polarisation) of ∼8% at a phase angle of 32∘ obtained after the 2015 perihelion (Myers and Nordsieck 1984; Chernova et al. 1993; Hadamcik et al. 2016). Micron-sized particles may reproduce the shape of the DLP curve, but certainly not the U-shaped OSIRIS phase function The major challenge is reconciling conclusions about the properties of cometary dust obtained from the analysis of both datasets, which demands a common framework to interpret consistently all the datasets available (Moreno et al. 2018; Markkanen et al. 2018; Levasseur-Regourd et al. 2019; Muñoz et al. 2020).\n\nRosetta did not provide in situ polarimetric observations, but these were obtained by Giotto’s HOPE (Halley Optical Probe Experiment) instrument, which took observations along the line-of-sight of the spinning spacecraft at different wavelengths free of gas emission. These allowed an estimate to be made of the density of the cometary dust, which was found to be low (about 100 kg m−3), and of its geometric albedo (0.04, matching that of the nucleus). The polarisation was highest when crossing dust jets and lower in the inner coma region. During the Giotto Extended Mission flyby of 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup, HOPE hinted at the presence of pebbles ejected from the nucleus. Since then, polarisation imaging of active comets have confirmed the existence of lower polarisation in the innermost coma and increased polarisation along large-scale dust jets. Interstellar comet 2I/Borisov presented unique polarimetric features: the polarisation increased steeply with phase angle, reaching values substantially higher than typically measured in small Solar System bodies (Bagnulo et al. 2021). These polarimetric properties distinguish 2I from dynamically evolved objects such as JFCs, and suggest that 2I was a highly pristine object, with a coma probably characterised by relatively small-sized aggregates. This also suggests that detailed in situ polarimetric observations at a DNC or LPC will be very valuable in revealing differences in dust properties between pristine and evolved comets.\n\nDust Structure and Distribution\n\nNumerical simulations based on the reflectance properties described previously conclude that dust particles are irregular, porous, built of smaller grains and possibly fractal in nature. Additionally, experimental simulations under different conditions (including microgravity) suggest the presence of fluffy aggregates with comparable amounts of minerals and organics (Levasseur-Regourd et al. 2015). This agrees with the results from Rosetta’s in situ sampling, in particular microscopic imaging of grains by the COSIMA (Langevin et al. 2020; Kimura et al. 2020) and MIDAS instruments (Mannel et al. 2019).\n\nIn situ measurements (typically measuring dust flux from momentum transferred in collisions with a target on the spacecraft) naturally sample only a single coma location at a time. Rosetta’s GIADA measured grains’ cross-sectional area, velocity, and impact momentum. It could therefore separate fluffy and compact particles. The instrument also characterized the submicrometre- to micrometre-sized dust mass flux at 67P, finding a differential size distribution index of ≈−3.0, which confirms that particles of size ≥0.1 mm dominate the dust coma cross-section during that comet’s entire orbit (Della Corte et al. 2019). On flyby missions, the velocity of impacting particles is dominated by the relative spacecraft velocity to the comet, which is well known in all cases, so particle masses can be directly inferred from momentum sensors, as achieved, for example, by instruments on the Giotto and the Stardust mis"
