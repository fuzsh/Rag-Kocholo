        "meta_description": "Antibubbles are ephemeral objects composed of a liquid drop encapsulated by a thin gas shell immersed in a liquid medium. When the drop is made of a volatile liquid and the medium is superheated, the gas shell inflates at a rate governed by the evaporation flux from the drop. This thermal process represents an alternate strategy for delaying the antibubble collapse. We model the dynamics of such \"thermal\" antibubbles by incorporating to the film drainage equation the heat-transfer-limited evaporation of the drop, which nourishes the gas shell with vapor, as for Leidenfrost drops. We demonstrate that the inflation of the gas shell is drastically inhibited by the thermalization of the initially colder drop. Because of this thermalization effect, smaller drops evaporate much faster than larger ones.",
