In my case, those 4 queries are independent as I already know the path of each: I could fire them all at the same time.\n\nI have learned from Frank van Puffelen that Firebase is able to pipeline several queries inside the same connection (see here).\n\nThis is very useful as it avoids to trigger sequentially n queries and to loose round-trip time.\n\nIn Javascript, we can do this wrapping the queries into an array of promises, and by firing them all together.\n\nJavaScript\n\nconst arrayOfPromises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3, promise4]; Promise.all(arrayOfPromises);\n\nMy question is how to proceed in Swift ?\n\nI have tried to make an array of DatabaseReference and to observe childValues from it :\n\nSwift\n\nlet refs = [Database.database().reference().child(\"node1\"), Database.database().reference().child(\"node2\"), Database.database().reference().child(\"node3\"), Database.database().reference().child(\"node4\")] refs.child(uid).observeSingleEvent(of: .value, with: { (snapshot) in //Do something }\n\nBut it seems that observeSingleEvent can only be fired from a single DatabaseReference (and not from an array of DatabaseReference)"
