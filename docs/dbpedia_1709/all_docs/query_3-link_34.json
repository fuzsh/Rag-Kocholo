        "text": "Deformation and burst of a liquid droplet with viscous surface moduli in a linear flow field\n\nNatasha Singh and Vivek Narsimhan\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 063601 (2020) – Published 1 June 2020\n\nWe investigate conditions for the breakup of a droplet with viscous surface moduli, under the assumption of weak flow and negligible Marangoni forces. The viscous interface is treated as a homogenous fluid obeying the Boussinesq–Scriven constitutive law. We observed that the presence of surface shear viscosity stabilizes the droplet, while that of surface dilational viscosity destabilizes it. The destabilizing effect of surface dilational viscosity appears similar to surfactant convection effects, while the stabilizing impact of surface shear viscosity appears similar to surfactant dilution.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nShape evolution of compound droplet in combined presence of electric field and extensional flow\n\nSomnath Santra, Devi Prasad Panigrahi, Sayan Das, and Suman Chakraborty\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 063602 (2020) – Published 1 June 2020\n\nWe study the unique morphodynamics of a compound droplet resulting from the interplay between an imposed electric field and an extensional flow. The nonintuitive findings include the interconversion of shape-evolution patterns of the compound droplet system depending on the background flow strength, electric field strength, electrophysical properties, and here unveiled post-breakup dynamics. We also show that including an electric field causes an intricate dependence of extensional viscosity on the electrical properties of the inner droplet - a paradigm not prevalent in pure extensional flow.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nLifetime of a single bubble on the surface of a water and ethanol bath\n\nElise Lorenceau and Florence Rouyer\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 063603 (2020) – Published 8 June 2020\n\nThe time a single bubble stays on a liquid bath surface depends on deterministic drainage. However, for pure water, stochastic local disturbances also affect bubble death. For binary systems like water/alcohol mixtures (WAM), preferential evaporation of one component is crucial. We examine stochastic and deterministic effects on WAM bubble lifetime statistically using an automated bubble generator. The bubble lifetime probability density and the increase in its average with ethanol concentration depends on stabilizing Marangoni stresses arising from evaporation-induced heterogeneities.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEditors' Suggestion\n\nMicrofluidic slug transport on traveling-wave surface topographies by mechanowetting\n\nEdwin de Jong, Jaap M. J. Den Toonder, and Patrick R. Onck\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 063604 (2020) – Published 8 June 2020\n\nA theoretical study shows that mechanowetting can transport fluid compartments by means of traveling surface waves. Mechanowetting is a propulsion mechanism that exploits capillary forces at fluid interfaces and deforming surface topographies, enabling fluid slugs to be transported at the speed of the surface waves. The effectiveness of the method for microfluidic propulsion is quantified by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations and an intuitive theoretical model.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nUltrasound-enhanced mass transfer during single-bubble diffusive growth\n\nÁlvaro Moreno Soto, Pablo Peñas, Guillaume Lajoinie, Detlef Lohse, and Devaraj van der Meer\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 063605 (2020) – Published 11 June 2020\n\nThe effect of ultrasound on the diffusive growth of a single spherical bubble growing on a substrate in supersaturated carbonated water is quantified. It is found that the diffusive growth of surface bubbles can be easily enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude during volumetric resonance. This convective growth is shown to be caused by vigorous acoustic microstreaming arising from the nonspherical bubble oscillations.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nJet ejection following drop impact on micropillared hydrophilic substrates\n\nAnayet Ullah Siddique, Marcus Trimble, Feng Zhao, Mark M. Weislogel, and Hua Tan\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 063606 (2020) – Published 15 June 2020\n\nThe jetting phenomenon from impinging droplets on partially wetting hydrophilic substrates composed of cylindrical micropillars is studied. Impact velocity and fluid viscosity are varied to characterize the jets. It is found that the jetting phenomenon arises for certain ranges of Weber and Ohnesorge numbers. Jet speed, height, and diameter scale linearly with the Weber number. The scaling analysis indicates that the jet is produced by pure inertial focusing of radial flow due to the collapse of an air cavity formed at the center of the drop during the recoiling phase of the impact.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nDynamic one-equation-based subgrid model for large-eddy simulation of stratified turbulent flows\n\nR. Ranjan, M. K. Venkataswamy, and S. Menon\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064601 (2020) – Published 3 June 2020\n\nThe locally dynamic one-equation based subgrid-scale is extended for large-eddy simulation of stably stratified turbulent flows. It is comprehensively assessed by simulating turbulent channel flow for a range of Reynolds and Richardson numbers. It captures all the key flow features, such as suppression of vertical turbulent transport, presence of internal waves and pycnocline, and decrease of the friction coefficient and Nusselt number. The turbulence statistics show good agreement with the reference results thus demonstrating its applicability to stratified flows with variable mean shear.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nTransition from non-swirling to swirling axisymmetric turbulence\n\nZecong Qin, Hugues Faller, Bérengère Dubrulle, Aurore Naso, and Wouter J. T. Bos\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064602 (2020) – Published 3 June 2020\n\nAxisymmetric turbulence is shown to exhibit a critical transition between two flow states. This transition is triggered by the anisotropy of the forcing of the system.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nCharacteristics of quasistationary near-wall turbulence subjected to strong stable stratification in open-channel flows\n\nAmir Atoufi, K. Andrea Scott, and Michael L. Waite\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064603 (2020) – Published 5 June 2020\n\nTurbulent open channel-flow under strongly stable thermal stratification is investigated. It is shown that the dominant effects of strong stable stratification on the characteristics of near-wall turbulence are transient. The budget of turbulent kinetic energy, the budget for the tangential Reynolds stress, and the relevant length scales are discussed. It is shown that near-wall turbulence at quasistationarity is approximately insensitive to the choice of upper thermal boundary condition.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nEnergy cascade at the turbulent/nonturbulent interface\n\nY. Zhou and J. C. Vassilicos\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064604 (2020) – Published 9 June 2020\n\nInterscale energy transfers at the turbulent/non-turbulent interface are from small to large scales near the interface’s tangent plane where motions are predominantly stretching, but from large to small scales in other directions where motions are predominantly compressive. This predominance is partly due to extreme compressive motions which can be significantly more likely than extreme stretching motions even where motions are on average stretching.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nVelocity and acceleration statistics in particle-laden turbulent swirling flows\n\nSofía Angriman, Pablo D. Mininni, and Pablo J. Cobelli\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064605 (2020) – Published 11 June 2020\n\nParticle-laden turbulent flows in von Karman laboratory experiments and in Taylor-Green direct numerical simulations display remarkable similarities, both for tracers as well as for inertial particles. A method to test models for particle dynamics in turbulent flows, exploiting these similarities, is presented. The effect of the mean flow is also considered, showing how it impacts scaling properties of particles’ statistics, and how it affects inertial range behavior.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nLow-dimensional model of the large-scale circulation of turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection in a cubic container\n\nDandan Ji and Eric Brown\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064606 (2020) – Published 12 June 2020\n\nLow-dimensional models are desirable for turbulent flow problems that are otherwise impractical to solve. A model describing the dynamics of the orientation of convection rolls as diffusion in a potential determined by the shape of the cell is tested. In a cubic Rayleigh-Bénard convection cell, measurements confirm the model prediction of a four-well potential, along with advected oscillation modes centered around potential minima at corners, driven by turbulent fluctuations with a restoring force due to the noncircular shape of the cell cross section.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nData compression for turbulence databases using spatiotemporal subsampling and local resimulation\n\nZhao Wu, Tamer A. Zaki, and Charles Meneveau\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064607 (2020) – Published 15 June 2020\n\nA data compression methodology for fluid dynamics is introduced. The simulation domain is divided into subdomains with equal size, and the simulation data is compressed by storing it only on the subdomain boundaries. When data is requested by users, a re-simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations within the subdomain is performed using the stored boundary data. The data storage scheme is carefully designed to avoid any errors during the compression-decompression process. A 40:1 lossless compression ratio is easily achieved.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nChaos and information in two-dimensional turbulence\n\nDaniel Clark, Lukas Tarra, and Arjun Berera\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064608 (2020) – Published 16 June 2020\n\nUsing fully resolved direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and attractor dimension are measured across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. In contrast with the three-dimensional case, these quantities are dependent on the system size and forcing length scale, providing further evidence of nonuniversality in two-dimensional turbulence.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nSeparating adverse-pressure-gradient and Reynolds-number effects in turbulent boundary layers\n\nC. Sanmiguel Vila, R. Vinuesa, S. Discetti, A. Ianiro, P. Schlatter, and R. Örlü\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064609 (2020) – Published 17 June 2020\n\nWall turbulence is characterized by a near-wall cycle of streaks and quasistreamwise vortices apparent as an invariant inner peak in the premultiplied energy spectra. A second, outer peak is known to emerge in this spectral view and become energized with increasing Reynolds number (Re) as well as adverse pressure gradient (APG). An analysis of experimental data sets examines how this outer peak scales with Re and APG and whether their imprint on the near-wall small scales are different.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nRole of the forcing dimensionality in thin-layer turbulent energy cascades\n\nBasile Poujol, Adrian van Kan, and Alexandros Alexakis\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064610 (2020) – Published 19 June 2020\n\nThe transition from forward to inverse energy cascade in turbulent flows in thin layers, varying the functional form of the forcing and the thickness of the layer, is investigated. As the forcing function becomes more three-dimensional, the inverse cascade is suppressed and the critical height hc, where the transition occurs, is decreased.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nDrag reduction for swept flat plate flow\n\nMarian Albers and Wolfgang Schröder\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064611 (2020) – Published 23 June 2020\n\nDrag reduction in turbulent boundary layer flow via swept transversal surface waves is investigated by large-eddy simulations. For partially downstream traveling waves, a decreased friction drag reduction and positively contributing pressure drag are determined while the opposite occurs for partially upstream traveling waves. It is also shown that an amplification of the outer layer turbulence can coexist with a drag-reduced near-wall state.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nProper orthogonal decomposition analysis and modelling of the wake deviation behind a squareback Ahmed body\n\nBérengère Podvin, Stéphanie Pellerin, Yann Fraigneau, Antoine Evrard, and Olivier Cadot\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064612 (2020) – Published 23 June 2020\n\nThe global wake dynamics of an Ahmed body are correctly captured by a proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD)-based low-dimensional model. The POD modes include the quasisteady wake deviation with intermittent switches, both vortex shedding modes and bubble pumping mechanisms.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nPermanence of large eddies in decaying variable-density homogeneous turbulence with small Mach numbers\n\nO. Soulard, J. Griffond, B.-J. Gréa, and G. Viciconte\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064613 (2020) – Published 23 June 2020\n\nDensity variations modify the way pressure transports information over large distances. As a result, the long-range correlations of the velocity field behave differently in constant- and variable-density flows. This raises the question of the permanence of large eddies in variable-density turbulence. Does this principle also hold in this context? If yes, how is it expressed? An exploration of these issues is presented.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nSingle-particle Lagrangian statistics from direct numerical simulations of rotating-stratified turbulence\n\nD. Buaria, A. Pumir, F. Feraco, R. Marino, A. Pouquet, D. Rosenberg, and L. Primavera\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064801 (2020) – Published 2 June 2020\n\nTurbulent fluid flows such as those in the ocean and the nocturnal atmosphere are strongly affected by Earth’s rotation and a stable density stratification. Using direct numerical simulations of the governing equations, the Lagrangian dispersion of particles in such flows is investigated. The anisotropy of various Lagrangian statistics is quantified, and different flow regimes are identified based on underlying linear and nonlinear physical processes. Comparisons with theory are made when appropriate.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFrom waves to convection and back again: The phase space of stably stratified turbulence\n\nN. E. Sujovolsky and P. D. Mininni\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064802 (2020) – Published 8 June 2020\n\nAn efficient path for energy dissipation is often looked for in wave turbulence systems. Fluid elements in stratified turbulence are shown to alternate between two invariant sets of solutions: waves and local convection, the latter connected to effective dissipation of energy. The fast evolution between these solutions explains enhancement of extreme events and balance relations in stratified flows.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nHysteretic wave drag in shallow water\n\nG. P. Benham, R. Bendimerad, M. Benzaquen, and C. Clanet\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064803 (2020) – Published 16 June 2020\n\nWhen a boat is pushed at constant force from deep water to shallow water, the drag changes in such a way that two possible states emerge, corresponding to a slow speed and a fast speed. A study of the dynamical behavior in such a transition, including possible hysteresis routes, with reference to real applications such as rowing sports is presented\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFully nonlinear simulations of unidirectional extreme waves provoked by strong depth transitions: The effect of slope\n\nYaokun Zheng, Zhiliang Lin, Yan Li, T. A. A. Adcock, Ye Li, and T. S. van den Bremer\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064804 (2020) – Published 18 June 2020\n\nRecent studies of surface gravity waves propagating over a sloping bottom have shown that an increase in the probability of extreme waves can be triggered by depth variations in sufficiently shallow waters. A boundary element method is used to show that this increase in probability is greatest when the slope is steepest, i.e., for a step. A harmonic separation technique shows that the second-order terms in wave steepness are responsible for the change in the statistical properties near the depth transition.\n\nShow Abstract\n\nFlows induced by Coriolis-influenced vertically propagating two-dimensional internal gravity wave packets\n\nBruce R. Sutherland, Wyatt Reeves, and Ton S. van den Bremer\n\nPhys. Rev. Fluids 5, 064805 (2020) – Published 25 June 2020\n\nIn the absence of background rotation, the Eulerian flow induced by two-dimensional internal wave packets is well known to have the structure of long trailing internal waves. We show that rotation makes these waves evanescent and the structure of the flow over the waves in the wave packet qualitatively changes, with implications for the modulational stability of the waves.\n\nShow Abstract"
