        "text": "Sport is an integral part of society, playing a key role in human health and well-being, and cultural, political and economic development. As sport is becoming more complex, competitive, diverse, and increasingly reliant on technology, HFE theories, methods, and principles are progressively being applied to help understand and optimize sports systems.\n\nHuman Factors and Ergonomics in Sport: Applications and Future Directions showcases the latest in sports HFE research and practice. Including contributions from both HFE and sports science researchers, it provides a collection of state-of-the-art studies, reviews and commentaries covering a diverse set of sports and sporting issues.\n\n\"This book is an excellent resource for all academics and students in general. It provides updated theoretical foundations and applications that conceive a world where everything is connected and embedded in technology that allows us to capture, process and visualise actions and interactions, also at transdisciplinary levels.\"\n\nProfessor Jaime Sampaio, Head of the Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health and Human Development (CIDESD), University of Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, Portugal\n\n\"With the changing nature of work comes an ever-greater focus on leisure. Sport is a major dimension of this crucial form of human activity. Now comes Salmon and his colleagues who have assembled a panoply of world leaders who each provide their own individual perspectives on this intriguing world. Their emphasis on the human factors and ergonomics of these activities brings us new and exciting insights. A great read for the specialist and generalist alike.\"\n\nProfessor Peter Hancock, Pegasus Professor, Provost Distinguished Research Professor and Trustee Chair, University of Central Florida, USA.\n\n\"Finally, the complexity of sports and health is being considered in full. This book challenges contemporary thinking toward the prevention of injuries in sports, and provides tangible solutions to help our field into a new decade.\""
