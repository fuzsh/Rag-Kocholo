Sharma\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Plantar fasciitis is a degenerative tissue condition occurs at the site of origin of plantar fascia at the medial calcaneum tuberosity. Most common symptom is described as first step pain. The treatment include heat modalities, patient education, stretching and strengthening exercises, NSAIDS, injections (steroids, local anesthetics, PRP), and surgical interventions (fasciotomy). Materials and Methods: It is a prospective and interventional randomised comparative study. 80 cases (40 in each group) in otherwise healthy individuals with the diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis attending Outpatient department of PMR of VMMC and Safdarjung hospital were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis was made based on history and clinical examination. Patients who satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria was randomly assigned by computerised block method into two groups-both were treated with injection of 40 mg (1ml) methyl prednisolone, one group with palpation guided and other with ultrasound guided. All patients underwent pain intensity assessment by VAS, ultrasound examination and X-ray at preinjection (0 week), 2 weeks and 8 weeks after steroid injection. Results: Statistically significant improvement in pain (VAS) at the end of 2 weeks (3.25 ± 0.95 vs. 2.65 ± 0.83, P = 0.003) and 8 weeks (2.28 ± 1.24 vs. 1.12 ± 1.07, P = 0.0005) of intervention in both groups but more in the USG guided group. There was decrease in plantar fascia thickness at the end of 2 weeks (0.33 ± 0.02 vs. 0.31 ± 0.02, P = 0.0005) and 8 weeks (0.30 ± 0.02 vs. 0.28 ± 0.02, P = 0.0005) of intervention in both groups but more in the USG guided group, which was statistically significant. No statistically significant difference in heel pad thickness at the end of 2 weeks (18.08 ± 0.76 vs. 18.23 ± 0.80, P = 0.356) and 8 weeks (18.00 ± 0.75 vs. 18.12 ± 0.79, P = 0.444) of intervention in both groups. Conclusion: Ultrasound guided injection is better than palpation method as it enhances the accuracy of injection by precisely localising the lesion and needle placement giving more relief in symptoms and normalisation of plantar fascia thickness.\n\nKeywords: Heel pad thickness, plantar fascia thickness, ultrasound\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA1.02 PAIN - CHRONIC GENERALISED PAIN SYNDROMES (INCLUDING FIBROMYALGIA)\n\nISPR8-0397\n\nWhole body cryotherapy in fibromyalgia patients: effects on pain and functional mobility\n\nM. Vitenet, F. Legrand1, B. Bouchet2, F. Bogard3, R. Taiar3, G. Polidori3, A. Rapin, F. C.

Our objective was to determine whether Whole Body Cryotherapy (WBC) can result in improved functional status and pain in fibromyalgia patients. It was hypothesized that positive effects will be realized due to the cold-induced modulation of the inflammation-immune axis. Materials and Methods: This present study is a randomized controlled trial with one between-subject factor (WBC group vs. Control group) and one within-subject factor (measurement point with 4 levels: pre-study, J8, 2 weeks later, 1 month later). Several parameters assessing pain intensity and functional status were measured repeatedly. In the WBC group, 10 cryostimulation sessions were performed (in addition to usual care) in a two-stage cryogenic chamber over a duration of 8 days. Duration of each cold exposure session was set to 3 minutes at a temperature of -110°C. Subjects in the control group did not receive this intervention, and changed nothing in their everyday activities. Our primary study outcome measurement was recalled pain intensity over the last 7 days. Results: A convenience sample of 28 patients (Mage= 52.4 ± 10.3 years-old; 75% females) with fibromyalgia diagnosis were randomized (WBC, control). In pretest, the usual pain scores were respectively 7.50 ± 1.81 for the experimental group (WBC) and 5.92 ± 1.75 for the control group. It was a usual pain reduction at J8, 2 weeks and 1 month with respectively 4,88 ± 2,98 (P < 0,001), 3.13 ± 2.40 (P < 0.001), 3.25 ± 2.92 (P < 0.001) for WBC compared between 6.00 ± 1.47 and 5.62 ± 1.66 for control group. It was no change in the control group, WBC patients reported significant improvements on all secondary outcome measures (decreased disability/improved functional mobility). Conclusion: Patients with fibromyalgia were improved for pain and functional mobility after 10 whole-body cryostimulation (WBC) sessions compared the outcomes in the control group.\n\nKeywords: Fibromyalgia, mobility, whole body cryotherapy\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1899\n\nOutcome of treatment of myofascial pain syndrome using a sequenced multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol\n\nD. Sharan\n\nDepartment of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, RECOUP, Bengaluru, Karanataka, India\n\nE-mail: [email protected] and [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common cause of non-articular musculoskeletal pain. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and to describe the clinical features and outcome of treatment of MPS among persons with Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSD). Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among 20500 clients diagnosed with WRMSD, with a mean age of 33 ± 3 years. The relevant clinical data were extracted from the treatment chart of WRMSD patients who received treatment at a tertiary level Rehabilitation Centre or on-site Occupational Health Clinics. All the clients received a sequenced, multidisciplinary treatment protocol incorporating manual therapy techniques including trigger point therapy, muscle energy technique, myofascial release, psychological approaches, yoga, exercises and ergonomic modifications. Results: 87% of participants were diagnosed to have MPS. The commonest region affected was the upper back (54%), followed by the low back (44%). 76% were male and 56% worked for 8-12 hours. The commonest job categories of the participants were Managerial (33%), Software Engineers (32%) and Application Engineers (14%). Prolonged sitting, lack of rest breaks, lack of tray for keyboard and mouse, and poor posture was found to be the commonest risk factor. Associated co-morbidities were Hypovitaminosis D (26%), Hypermobile joints (24%), Osteopaenia/Osteoporosis (14%), Hypothyroidism (6%) and Hyperuricemia (6%). The commonest symptoms were Regional pain (78%), Stiffness (58%), Generalised pain (40%), Weakness (38%), Disturbed Sleep (38%), Fatigue (32%), Tingling (20%) and Numbness (18%). There was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in pain following the rehabilitation. Ninety-five percent of the subjects made a complete recovery and returned to their regular work. Conclusion: In view of the high prevalence of MPS in this study, healthcare professionals dealing with musculoskeletal pain need to be trained in the current approaches to diagnose and manage MPS. A comprehensive, protocol-based multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the successful management of MPS.\n\nKeywords: Muscle pain, outcome, rehabilitation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2315\n\nExtracorporeal shock wave therapy versus 1% xylocaine injection for myofascial trigger point release with novel analysis by sonoelastography\n\nA. Suputtitada, C. Schmitz1, N. Ngamrungsiri\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, bangkok, Thailand, 1Department of Anatomy II, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background:Introduction and Backgroun: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has become an alternative in the treatment of myofascial trigger points (MTPs). Sonoelastography has evidences in quantitative assessment of MTPs. Purpose: This study tested the hypothesis that both radial ESWT (rEWST) and injection of 1% xylocaine are effective and safe treatments for active MTPs with novel analysis by sonoelastography. Design: Prospective, randomized single blinded clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Patients (n = 20) with active MTPs of UTM were randomized to receive either rESWT (n = 10); three rESWT sessions; one session per week; 2000 rESWT impulses per session; positive energy flux density = 0.10 mJ/mm2) or 1% xylocaine (4 ml) injection (n = 10) (three injections; one injection per week). The outcome measure were the elasticity score of MTPs assessed with sonoelastography, pain (VAS score), active range of motion of the neck, and McGill scores three weeks after baseline. Results: Both rESWT and injection of 1% xylocaine resulted in statistically significantly (P < 0.05) reduced elasticity scores, VAS scores of UTM and McGill scores, as well as statistically significantly (P < 0.05) increased range of motion of the neck at three weeks after baseline. Except of a lower mean McGill sensory score after injection of 1% xylocaine compared to rESWT (-29%; P < 0.05) repeated measures two-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post-tests for pairwise comparisons showed no statistically significant differences between rESWT and injection of 1%xylocaine. Conclusion: Both rESWT and 1% xylocaine injection are effective and safe treatments of active MTPs of UTM. Ultrasound elastography appears useful for objectively monitoring treatment success.\n\nKeywords: Myofascial trigger points, radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy, sonoelastography\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA1.04 PAIN - MISCELLANEOUS\n\nISPR8-2720\n\nPatient pain satisfaction scores unaffected by opioid reduction protocol utilizing morphine equivalent dose calculations\n\nP. Kunj, R. McCarty, M. Rozak, E. Chandrasekhar, A. McCrate, B. Abramoff, M. Reed, B. Milton, D. Strasser\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine, Emory Rehabilitation Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Opioids are important for pain management during inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) stays, but are potentially overprescribed. Previously, we performed a prospective study utilizing an opioid reduction protocol to significantly reduce the opioid burden in patients admitted to an IRF. This study retrospectively analyzed patient pain satisfaction survey scores to determine the effect of the opioid reduction protocol on patient pain satisfaction. Materials and Methods: We included all patients admitted to an IRF at an academic institution during a two-month period in 2016 and calculated the Morphine Equivalent Dose (MED) for admission and discharge. We delivered informative lectures to prescribers regarding CDC recommendations, posted MED charts, calculated weekly MED scores and repeated MED calculations for all admissions and discharges over the following two months. Satisfaction surveys were sent to all patients upon discharge, with pain scored 0 to 5 (0-not controlled, 5-extremely well controlled). Results: Surveys were obtained from 34 of 75 patients in the pre-intervention group and 41 of 87 in the post-intervention group. There was no statistical difference in pain satisfaction between the two groups (P = 0.38) with an average satisfaction of 3.68 and 3.32 for the pre and post-interventional groups, respectively. MED was decreased from admission to discharge in the pre-intervention group by an average of 17.79, a 44% decrease, while the post-interventional group MED decreased on average by 24.08, a 49% decrease. These findings are an important, since the primary study showed dramatic reductions in MED between pre and post intervention groups, reducing the percent of patients whose MED was greater than 50 by nearly half (23% to 12%). Conclusion: This study demonstrates a method of tracking patient pain satisfaction whilst reducing opioid utilization in an IRF setting, and provides evidence that opioid weaning by tracking MED calculations does not negatively influence patient pain control satisfaction.\n\nKeywords: Opioid, pain, satisfaction\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1313\n\nFive days of rtms associated with motor imagery can decrease durably central neuropathic pain: results from a cohort of 47 patients\n\nE. Castel-Lacanal, M. Prudhomme, X. De Boissezon, M. Belle, P. Marque\n\nCHU Toulouse Rangueil Medecine Physique et Réadaptation, Toulouse, France\n\nE-mail: [email protected] and [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Neuropathic pain are frequent and often drug resistant, with an important impact on quality of life and function recovery. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of high frequency rTMS on motor cortex associated with motor imagery in patients with neuropathic pain. Materials and Methods: Between december 2014 and april 2017, 47 patients with central neuropathic pain were included. We studied clinical parameters (age, gender, pathology, pain duration and pain location) as well as cortical excitability. Before the treatment, a DN4 score and a BPI score were realized. Those two scores were repeated 48hours after the treatment, at the beginning and at the end of 5 days of treatment, and during the follow up (at M1, M3 and M6.). The treatment consisted in daily rTMS session, during five days, associated with motor imagery and mirror therapy. The primary outcome was a decreasing of the most intense pain of two points, defining responders. Results: Thirty-four men and 13 women, 56,5 years old mean, with neuropathic pain from 6,6 years on average, principally secondary to stroke (n = 24). Were included. Thirty percent of patients were responders at 48 hours, M1 and M3, and this diminution of pain was significant (all P < 0, 05). There was a significant association between responders at 48hours and responders at M1 and M3, as well as between pain duration and non responders at M3 (P < 0, 03). Conclusion: This study shows that high frequency TMS on the motor cortex associated with motor imagery can decrease neuropathic pain, as it is describes in literature, but durably with an effect until 3 months in our study. Furthermore, it may exist a link between responders at 48hours and responders in the long term.\n\nKeywords: Motor imagery, neuorpathic pain, repetitiv transcranial magnetic stimulation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.01 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - INFLAMMATORY JOINT DISEASES (E.G.

Materials and Methods: 220 patients participated in the SCLEREDUC trial, a 12-month, randomised controlled study comparing the efficacy on disability assessed by the HAQ-DI at 12-months of physical therapy compared to usual care in patients with SSc. Self-rated state and change in patient health at 12 months post-randomization were assessed by using 2 external anchoring questions from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form. Patients who self-rated their health as “excellent”, “very good” or “good” were considered as having an acceptable symptom state and those who self-rated their health change at 12 months as “somewhat better” were considered as minimally improved. PASS estimates were obtained using the 75th percentile method and the MCII estimates by using the mean change in scores method. Results: Answers to both anchoring questions at 12 months were available for 151/220 (68.6%) participants. PASS (95% CI) and mean (SD) MCII estimates at 12 months were respectively : 53.75 (34.00 to 68.00) and -6.74 (32.02) for the joint-pain visual analog scale (range 0-100), 1.41 (1.13 to 1.63) and -0.21 (0.48) for the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI, range 0-3), 1.27 (1.07 to 1.62) and -0.13 (0.45) for the scleroderma HAQ (sHAQ, range 0-3), 26.00 (17.00 to 37.00) and -3.38 (9.87) for the Cochin Hand Function Scale (range 0-90), and 19.40 (17.20 to 21.90) and - 5.69 (6.79) for the McMaster-Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire (range 0-30). For all PROs, higher scores indicate higher symptoms levels. Conclusion: The present study provides PASS and MCII estimates for commonly used PROs in SSc. These estimates are useful in interpreting the clinical relevance of outcomes used in patients’ care and in clinical trials.\n\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00318188.\n\nKeywords: Patient-reported outcomes, systemic sclerosis\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2043\n\nThe discriminative ability of fraxto identify prevalent post-sci lower extremity osteoporotic fractures\n\nR. Battaglino, G. Cobb1, N. Nguyen1, L. Morse1\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, UC Denver, Aurora, 1Craig Hospital, Research, Englewood, Colorado, USA\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: SCI causes rapid, severe osteoporosis. More than half of those with motor complete SCI will experience an osteoporotic fracture at some point following their injury. Despite the high prevalence, there is no SCI-specific fracture risk prediction tool. Therefore, we sought to compare the discriminative value of risk fracture scores used in the general population, (FRAX score, T-score, and Z-score) in adults with spinal cord injury. We also assessed the sensitivity and specificity of osteoporosis definitions based on FRAX and T-score. Materials and Methods: We assessed 318 adult men with chronic SCI (at least 1 year post-injury). Bone density at the hip (total hip, femoral neck), knee (distal femur, proximal tibia), and radius was determined by DXA scan. Ten-year major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture FRAX scores were calculated based on bone density at the femoral neck. Prevalent post-SCI fractures were categorized as osteoporotic or traumatic and only lower extremity osteoporotic fractures were considered in the analysis. The overall discriminative value of each score was assessed by calculating areas under the ROC curve. Results: The prevalence of post-SCI lower extremity osteoporotic fracture was 22%. When comparing bone density at the hip (AUC 0.7681-0.7858), bone density at the knee (AUC 0.7821-0.7733), bone density at the radius (AUC 0.6263), T-score (AUC 0.7890), Z-score (AUC 0.7040), and FRAX scores, 10-year major osteoporotic FRAX score (AUC 0.8381) had the greatest discriminative ability to identify prevalent post-SCI lower extremity osteoporotic fractures. Major osteoporotic FRAX score cut-point of >10% had greater sensitivity and specificity than the cut-point recommended in the general population (>20% probability of fracture) recommended in the general population. Conclusion: Ten-year major osteoporotic FRAX score may have clinical utility in fracture risk prediction after spinal cord injury. However, cut-points may need to be SCI-specific (>10%) to improve predictive value.\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0358\n\nThe effect of intraarticular injection of botulinum toxin type a, triamcinolone or saline plus rehabilitation exercise shoulder pain on patients with post-stroke\n\nX.

The aim of our research is to study the effect botulinum toxin type A and triamcinolone for shoulder pain on patients with post-stroke. Materials and Methods: Eventy-five patients with shoulder pain on post-stroke patients were randomly divided into three groups based on difference of injection (A:BoNT-A, B: triamcinolone, C: saline). Each group was injected once with ultrasound guidance. All groups received therapeutic exercise up to 4 weeks. The Evaluation of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and pain-free range of motion (ROM) were recorded for pain and quality of life at baseline and end of 4th week after injection. Results: The FMA of upper-limb were significantly improved in group A and group B patients between baseline and end of 4th week (P < 0.05). The VAS score in group A and group B significantly decreased from 6.9 ± 1.1 (baseline) to 2.7 ± 1.4, and from 6.3 ± 1.2 (baseline) to 4.4 ± 1.2 at 4 weeks (P < 0.05) respectively. The passive ROM and active ROM were significantly improved in group A and group B patients between baseline and 4 weeks (P < 0.05). The between-group comparison revealed significant differences in group A and group B, group B and group C with regard to the FMA of upper-limb, VAS score and ROM at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). No changes were observed for the group C after intervention. No adverse events was occurred in all group patients. Conclusion: The all treatments can significantly reduce shoulder pain and recovery function in patients with stroke, but BoNT-A combined with physical therapy seems to affect better for such patients.\n\nKeywords: Botulinum toxin type a, shoulder pain, triamcinolone\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.02 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASES (E.G.

Lim, S. J. Park\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine, SNUH, Seoul, South Korea\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Diagnosing a chronic full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear using ultrasound is challenging because tendon defects are usually obliterated with fibrous tissues, mimicking continuity of tendon. Among many direct and indirect ultrasonographic signs for full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears, diagnostic values of indirect signs, especially sagging peribursal fat sign (SPFS), have been undervalued. To investigate whether the presence of SPFS would be suggestive of a full-thickness tear, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of SPFS were analyzed by regarding arthrosonography as a standard reference. Materials and Methods: 104 patients with shoulder pain for more than 3 months, who underwent arthrosonography under the suspicion of full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear were included. Suspicion of full-thickness tear was determined by substantial loss (>50% of thickness) of fibrillary patterns in either the bursal or articular side with more than one of four indirect signs such as long biceps tendon sheath swelling, cortical irregularity, double cortex sign and SPFS. Patients with obvious tendon defect were excluded because diagnosis is too obvious to consider indirect sings. Arthrosonography was done by injecting 20ml of fluid into the glenohumeral joint capsule followed by careful sonographic evaluation on the subacromial subdeltoid bursal space to find any fluid leaking, which would confirm the existence of true full-thickness tear, serving as a communication channel between the joint capsule and superficial space overlying the rotator cuff tendons.\n\nResults: The SPFS was the most sensitive (88.4%) and specific (98%) to diagnose full-thickness tear among the indirect signs. When SPFS was combined with other indirect signs such as biceps tendon sheath swelling, cortical irregularity of humeral head, double cortex sign, the specificity and positive predictive value reached up to 100%. Conclusion: These results highlight that SPFS can be served as a strong evidence of full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear.\n\nKeywords: Rotator cuff tendon tear, shoulder pain, ultrasonography\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0026\n\nComparison between platelet-rich plasma and hyaluronic acid treatments for talar osteochondral lesions: a systematic review with a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials\n\nW. Li\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei City, Taiwan\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Both platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) with or without surgical intervention can enhance healing and improve function in talar OCLs. However, recent studies on OCLs have not thoroughly investigated the effects among PRP, HA, and conventional treatment. Our purpose is to synthesize evidence by comparing the effects (pain score and foot and ankle condition scores) among PRP, HA, and conventional treatment strategies for talar OCLs. Materials and Methods: All relevant research articles were included using related terms in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane library databases from their inception to June 2017. The screening criteria for this systematic review were as follows: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared PRP with HA, PRP with control, or HA with control in patients with talar OCLs. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data were extracted and recorded as weighted mean difference (WMD) and their standard deviations (SDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), consistency H, and I 2 for continuous data in the network meta-analysis. Results: A total of 1199 references were identified, of which five RCTs were included in the final synthesis. These studies randomized 197 patients into the PRP, HA, and control groups. PRP caused higher reductions in the visual analog scale score than HA and conventional treatment, and the WMDs were −1.109 (95%CI: −1.716, −0.502) and −2.301 (95%CI: −2.825, −1.777). Moreover, PRP improved the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score more than the other treatment methods, and the WMDs were 12.448 (95%CI: 7.224, 17.672) and 18.617 (95%CI: 13.536, 13.698). Conclusion: PRP reduced pain and improved ankle conditions to a greater extent than HA and conventional treatment. Therefore, PRP might be recommended for the treatment of talar OCLs. Further investigation is required to guarantee the safety and efficacy of different surgical treatments.\n\nKeywords: Hyaluronic acid, osteochondral lesions of talus, platelet rich plasma\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0096\n\nEfficacy of tele-rehabilitation compared with office-based physical therapy in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a randomized clinical trial\n\nS. Mohsenolhosseini\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of disability among the middle to senior age groups. Despite beingeffective, office-based physical therapy (OBPT) needs professional human resources and is both costly and time-consuming. We aimed to compare the efficacy of tele-rehabilitation (tele-rehab) compared with OBPT in patients with kneeosteoarthritis. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were assigned to participate ineither a 6-week home-based tele-rehab or an OBPT program between 2015 and 2016. Our primary outcome was the meanchange from the baseline until 1 and 6 month’s post-intervention in scores of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis OutcomeScore (KOOS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). We used analysis ofvariance for the repeated measure statistical test. Results: A total of 54 patients entered the final analysis, with 27 in each group. The mean age of the patients was 58.2–7.41years and 60.2% were female. In the tele-rehab and OBPT group, KOOS scores increased from baseline to 6 months post-intervention (50.6 to 83.1 and 49.8 to 81.8) respectively. There was no significant difference between tele-rehab and OBPTgroups in any of the studied scales. Conclusion: The tele-rehab program is as effective as OBPT in improving the function of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Considering the much lower time and cost consumed by tele-rehab, it is the recommended program for the older populationliving in remote sites.\n\nKeywords: Knee osteoarthritis, telerehabilitation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2286\n\nRasch analysis of the “forgotten joint” questionnaire\n\nD.

The “Forgetten Joint Score” was developed to evaluate the patient after total knee arthroplasty. The aim of this study is to validate the FJS-12 questionnaire according to Rasch model. Materials and Methods: Data from 263 subjects regarding the response to the FJS-12, KOOS and KUJALA scales as well as their ages, genders, body mass index, type of knee arthroplasty were collected. Rasch analysis was performed to verify item response categories, overall fit to the Rasch model, differential item functioning, unidimensionality of the scale, and internal consistency. The validity of the construct was also studied according to the Classical Test Theory. Results: The item-trait interaction shows a good fit with the Rasch model: Chi-squared = 24.34 and P = 0.23. The item difficulty ranges from -0.57 logits to 1.41 logits with residual average of -0.47 ± 2.26. Comparison of the subgroup estimates in each factor did not reveal a significant difference between the different subgroups. There was a good correlation between the estimates of the different subgroups: for ICC age = 0.97 and P < 0.001; for sex, ICC = 0.88 and P < 0.001. The reliability index of the scale is 0.87. Conclusion: The “Forgetten Joint Score” validated include 10 items with four response categories. It has good internal consistency. It has neither a ceiling effect nor a floor effect. It is one-dimensional and linear. It has excellent correlation with the KOOS and KUJALA scales.\n\nKeywords: Forgetten joint score, rasch analysis, total knee arthroplasty\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0526\n\nKnee osteoarthitis and platelet-rich plasma treatment : how to improve the efficency?\n\nC.

New studies have focused on modern therapeutic methods that stimulate cartilage healing process and improve the damage, including the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP is prepared from autologous blood by centrifugation to obtain a highly concentrated sample of platelets. Due to the mixed results from controlled studies, the clinical efficacy of PRP in the treatment of knee OA is unclear with shortcomings in the current literature. Materials and Methods: A comparison of the outcomes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the 3 most recent and high-quality meta-analyses to classify the different studies in 2 groups (bad responders group (BRG) and very good responders group (VGRG)). The minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) was defined to help determining whether an observed difference is clinically important. We used MCII values to classify the different studies in 2 groups depending on the outcomes: BRG < MCII and VGRG >2xMCII. Results: From the 19 RCTs analyzed, 7 trials were included in the VGRG and 4 in the BRG. In VGRG, 1 or 2 injections were performed in 4/7 trials, time between injections was 2 to 3 weeks in 4/5 studies with many injections, volume injected varied from 2.5 to 8mL, and single spinning technique was used in 5/7 studies. PRP classification was Mishra 4B and PAWP2Bβ in 5/7 studies. The use of PRP with leukocytes is only found in the BRG. Conclusion: Our study helped identify features of PRP recommended for knee OA treatment, such as the use of a single spinning technique, a platelet concentration lower than 5 times the baseline (from 3 to 4), and avoiding leukocytes and erythrocytes. We recommend leveraging this information about PRP for future studies.\n\nKeywords: Osteoarthritis, platelet-rich plasma\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0120\n\nStudy of effectiveness of lateral wedge insole in medial compartment of osteoarthritis of knee treated with viscosupplementation\n\nV. Kanaujia\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, AIIMS, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) of knee is one of most common musculoskeletal disorder affecting theelderly population in Asia-Pacific region. The goals of OA treatment include alleviation of pain andimprovement of functional status. Viscosupplementation (VS) is being a more widely accepted andpracticed mode of treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis of knee. In addition to this heat and coldtherapy, exercise, electro therapy, ADL modification, orthotic devices like Lateral Wedge Insole (LWI), shock absorbing insoles and knee brace are also available and widely prescribed in day to day practice. Materials and Methods: This study is a single center randomized interventional study in which total 60patients were selected from tertiary care center and divided in two equal groups using computerizedblock randomization. Group A got only VS while Group B got VS and LWI. Assessment was done atbaseline and then after 2, 4 and 12 weeks after the intervention by using VAS, WOMAC and HAQ. Results: In this study all the patients in both group showed statistically significant improvement in VAS, WOMAC and HAQ on all three follow ups over the previous assessment(P value and lt; 0.0005). On inter-groupcomparison, statistically significant better results were noticed in the WOMAC scores of group B at 2 and4 week (P value and lt; 0.0005) follow up over group A. Similar benefit or difference was not evident in terms of VAS or HAQ (P value and gt; 0.0005.) at any follow up in any of the two groups. The statistically better result in group B on WOMAC was not seen at the 12 week follow up. Conclusion: Bimodal approach of VS and LWI with different mechanism of action has a definite benefit in the management of OA knee. Lateral wedge on combination with VS results in faster onset of benefit within 2 weeks in function as tested by WOMAC scale. OA knee equalized by 12 week of follow up.\n\nKeywords: Knee osteoarthritis, lateral wedge insole, viscosupplimentation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1603\n\nMinimally invasive surgery leads to earlier recovery of quality of gait after total hip arthroplasty secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial\n\nD.

Previous analysis of early postoperative data showed that the time to reach complete functional independence (including walking 30 meters) wasn’t shortened with MHS compared to standard hip surgery (SHS). However there is only little evidence on the benefits of MHS on the quality of gait. Symmetrical distribution of load is a useful clinical tool related to it. The aim of this secondary analysis was then to compare the quality of gait in patients with MHS or SHS. Materials and Methods: One-hundres seventy patients were randomized into 2 groups, SHS and MHS. The major criterion was bilateral distribution of load assessed on a stabilometric platform 3 months after surgery. Other criteria were pain, lameness, need of a walking aid and difficulty in using stairs assessed by self-administered questionnaire at 3 and 12 months after surgery. Continuous and categorical variables of interest were compared using Student’s t and Chi-square tests. Results: Patients of the MHS group showed significantly more symmetrical distribution of load (48 VS 52% in the MHS group and 45.2 versus 54.8% in the SHS group, for operated and contralateral limb, respectively, P = 0.020) and less functional impairment: decreased lameness (6.4 vs. 21% in MHS and SHS groups, respectively, P = 0.021), need of walking aid (75.8 vs. 88.6% in MHS and SHS groups, respectively, P = 0.027), difficulty in using stairs (14.5 vs. 34%, in MHS and SHS groups, respectively P = 0.015) at 3 months after surgery. There were no more differences between groups 12 months after surgery and no difference in pain score. Conclusion: MHS allows earlier recovery of symmetric load and physiological gait. Difference in pain can’t explain the differences in functional abilities that could be the result of the decreased muscle trauma and of the deterioration of proprioceptive sensors.\n\nKeywords: Gait, minimally invasive surgery, total hip arthroplasty\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1644\n\nClinical and laboratory data are both essential to assess the locomotor patterns at 4 months post total-knee arthroplasty\n\nS.

Here we present the results of the laboratory analysis and the relationships with clinical outcomes for a subgroup of participants. The aim of this subgroup analysis (43% of the whole cohort) was to determine whether the clinical outcomes obtained from a physical assessment are sufficient to predict asymmetry during locomotor patterns at 4 months post-TKA. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four individuals (mean age and standard deviation: 66 (7.5) years) who had received 8 weeks of physiotherapy were assessed 4 months after TKA. In addition to clinical assessment (pain, ROM and strength, 6MWT and comorbidity, global function of the lower limb with WOMAC), the locomotor patterns during two tasks, sit-to-stand (three foot conditions) and walking at two speeds, were evaluated in the laboratory. Statistical analyses assessed the relationships between clinical outcomes and biomechanical data, more specifically locomotor asymmetry of performance. Results: Participants had moderate pain, and ROM and strength at the knee were inferior on the operated side. Mean values in the WOMAC, 6MWT and stair capacity were 84.7 (14.4), 411.4m (93.9) and 19.2 (23.5), respectively. They performed the STS with an asymmetrical use of the operated knee although they could perform more symmetrically when imposed. They were more asymmetrical at fast than normal speed during walking. The knee angles, moments, powers and force asymmetries correlated weakly with clinical outcomes except for the knee extensor strength asymmetry with STS. The clinical outcomes explained only a small part of the variance in the locomotor asymmetry. Conclusion: These results bring more evidence that laboratory assessment is essential to characterize the locomotor patterns post-TKA and that it provides useful information to the clinicians.\n\nKeywords: Gait, knee arthroplasty, sit-to-stand\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0664\n\nIntra-articular oxygen-ozone therapy in knee osteoarthritis: results of a 31-week randomized, single-blind study versus intra-articular hyaluronic acid\n\nA.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of IA O2O3 compared to ialuronic acid (HA) in terms of pain, knee function, and health-related quality of life in patients affected by KOA over 31 weeks. Materials and Methods: In this randomized, single-blind, controlled study patients aged ≥60 years affected by KOA have been enrolled and randomly allocated to receive 4 IA knee injections once per week for 4 consecutive weeks of O2O3 or HA (T0-T3) and a follow-up visit 4 weeks after the fourth injection (T4). Patients having a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ≥4 at 6 months follow-up visit (T5) underwent a second treatment cycle (T5-T8) and a 1-month follow-up visit (T9). All adverse events occurred, VAS, Oxford Knee Questionnaire, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, and European Quality of Life-5 dimensions scores have been assessed. Results: Forty-six patients (mean aged 70.8±2.4 years) were enrolled and randomly allocated to O2O3 (n = 23) or HA treatment group (n = 23). Nineteen patients reported a VAS ≥4 at T5, undergoing a second treatment cycle: 10 in O2O3 group and 9 in HA group. There were no significant differences in adverse events occurrence between the two groups. VAS scores showed a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.013) compared to baseline during both treatment cycles in both groups. At both follow-up visits (T4 and T9) the VAS score was significantly lower in the HA group compared to O2O3 group (P < 0.013). Conclusion: IA O2O3 therapy could be comparable to IA HA in terms of safety profile and effectiveness in reducing pain in patients with KOA, even on a multiple injection cycles and long term follow-up.\n\nKeywords: Hyaluronic acid, knee osteoarthritis, oxygen-ozone\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1457\n\nThe efficacy of land versus water exercise program on body composition in obese patients with knee osteoarthritis\n\nT. Tamin, N. Loekito\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Obesity and Osteoarthritis (OA) can affect each other and make a reciprocal causal chain with negative feedback that caused by physical inactivity. Water-based (WB) and land-based (LB) exercises are effective to improve body composition and physical activities. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of both exercise programs on body composition in obese patients with knee OA. Materials and Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was done involving 33 men and women aged 40–80 years old with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and knee OA grade 2 and 3 based on Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale. Subjects were randomly divided into LB (n = 18) and WB group (n = 15) with aerobic and knee-strengthening exercises for 8 weeks. Body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) were measured before and after the program. Data will be analyzed using SPSS 20.0 with independet t test, Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney test if necessary. Results: Participants who performed the LB exercise program showed significant improvement in BW (mean, 0.22 ± 0.92; P = 0.025), BMI (median, 0.36 (0.68–2.88); P = 0.040), and WC (mean, 2.13 ± 3.66; P = 0.024). While there was no significant improvement of body composition in WB group. However, when both groups were compared, BMI was the only variable that was significantly different (P = 0.048), with subjects of LB group showing better result than the WB group. Conclusion: Land-based exercise program was more effective to improve body composition in obese patients with knee OA due to the effect of gravity that improved muscle strengthening without buoyancy such as in the water. Warm water temperature gives relaxation effect that increases appetite. We suggest longer period of research and greater number of participants to better show a significant improvement for WC and BW variables.\n\nKeywords: Body composition, land-based exercise, obesity\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1547\n\nVolumetric findings of mri after platelet rich plasma injection in knee osteoarthritis.

In this study, we investigated the effect of PRP on cartilage characteristics by special MRI sequencings. Materials and Methods: In the double blind randomized clinical trial, patients with grade 1, 2 and 3 of osteoarthritis were included in this study. All of the knees divided to groups randomly and exercise was prescribed for all of knees. Beside, PRP was injected 2 courses with 4 weeks interval in PRP group. For all of patients before and 6 months after treatment VAS (visual analogue scale) and WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index) were fulfilled and MRI was performed. Sequencings of MRI were PD fat saturated (coronal and sagittal) and transverse TRUFISP 3D. Imaging was scored according to 4 cartilage’s characteristics including, Patellofemoral cartilage volume, Subarticular bone marrow abnormality, Medial and lateral meniscal disintegrity and Synovitis. Results: Twenty-three knees in case group and 23 knees in control group were studied. All of patients were female with mean age 57.57±5.9 years old and mean BMI 28.49 ± 3.24 (Kg/m2). Mean total WOMAC and VAS changes before and after treatment in control group were 11.61 ± 1.3 and 8.5± 1.1 respectively. In PRP group, mean total of WOMAC and VAS changes showed better improvement with 20±3.2 and 12.3 ± 1.6 respectively (P < 0.05). In PRP group all of the radiologic variables except subarticular bone marrow abnormality had significantly improvement (P < 0.05). In comparison between 2 groups, Patellofemoral cartilage volume and synovitis had significantly changes in PRP group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: In this study, in addition to the effect of PRP on VAS and WOMAC, there is effect on radiologic characteristics (Patellofemoral cartilage volume and synovitis) significantly. For more evaluation, Study with more sample size is recommended.\n\nKeywords: Magnetic resonance imaging, osteoarthritis, platelet rich plasma\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.03 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - BONE DISEASES (E.G.

Uddin\n\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, 1Department of Pathology, Delta Medical College and Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Osteoporosis is a risk factor for hip and other fractures. Hypertension is a progressive silent disease affecting bone mass and structure, leading to increased susceptibility to fractures. The aim of this study was to determine the role of hypertension for fracture risk in osteoporotic women. Materials and Methods: This comparative cross sectional study was conducted among 54 hypertensive and 34 non-hypertensive osteoporotic female patients at two tertiary centers in Dhaka city during the period of 1st January to 31st December, 2017. Data were collected by face to face interview using semi-structured questionnaire and checklist. Online assessment of fracture risk probability was done among the two groups by FRAX tool and statistical analysis was performed by Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS-23). Results: The study revealed that the mean ages were 61.94 ± 9.362 years in hypertensive and 59.18 ± 11.269 years in non-hypertensive patients. Majority were housewives in hypertensive (96.3%) and non-hypertensive (82.4%) patients. It was found that the mean duration of hypertension was 6.41 ± 4.049 years in osteoporotic women where as the mean duration of osteoporosis were 8.80 ± 5.022 years in hypertensive and 7.53 ± 5.920 years in non-hypertensive patients. The difference of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) risk by age was significantly (X2, P < 0.05) higher among the patients belonged to age group 60–79 years as well as comparatively higher in hypertensive patients. MOF risk by hypertension was comparatively higher among the hypertensive patients but it was not statistically significant (X2, Th P > 0.05). On the other hand, hip fracture (HF) risk by hypertension was comparatively higher among the hypertensive patients and it was statistically significant (X2, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The study reflected that the fracture risk was significantly higher in hypertensive patients.\n\nKeywords: Fracture risk, hypertension, osteoporotic women\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1181\n\nThe deep core stability back muscles training in rehabilitation of patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures\n\nL. Marchenkova, E. Makarova, M.

Materials and Methods: Sixty patients (M-12, F-48) aged 43–81 years (average age 62.75 ± 12.5) with primary osteoporosis and at least one non-traumatic VF were included in the study. The rehabilitation program focused on training of deep core stability back muscles and consisted of 4 kinesiotherapy methods (Dr. Wolff and CBS simulators, kinesiohydrotherapy in the pool and complex physical exercises by Gorinevskaya-Dreving) was prescribed for 21 days to all patients. Isometric core strength test (Back-Check) was performed at baseline, at the end of the rehabilitation treatment and at 21 day follow-up visit. Results: At baseline relative flexion strength (REL FS), relative extension strength (REL ES), left lateral flexion strength (LLAT FS), right lateral flexion strength (RLAT FS) were lower than recommended indexes: 113.01 ± 34.03% of 150% (P = 0.001), 75 ± 12.78% of 100% (P = 0.006), 85 ± 12.78% (P = 0.04) and 79.73 ± 9.2% of 100% (P = 0.003) accordingly. Ratio relative flexion/extension strength (FLE: EXT S) also was in imbalance in 38 of 45 patients. Lateral flexion ratio (LLAT: RLAT FS) showed imbalance only in 6 patients. The all isometric core strength test indexes improved significantly: REL FS up to 132.57 ± 47.08% (P = 0.0001), REL ES up to 86.45 ± 9.4% (P = 0.03), LLAT FS up to 90.7 ± 9.55% (P = 0.07), RLAT FS up to 89.4 ± 2.5% (P = 0.03) after the rehabilitation course. The muscle strengths stay better than the baseline indexes at the follow-up measurement: REL FS = 121.5 ± 39.9% (P = 0.002), REL ES = 79.78 ± 10.5% (P = 0.02), LLAT FS = 87.1 ± 11.07% (P = 0.06), RLAT FS = 80.14 ± 8.62% (P = 0.09). Conclusion: The basic dysfunction of deep core muscles and imbalance flexion/extension strength in osteoporotic patients with VF were estimated. Complex rehabilitation with kinesiotherapy showed the high prolong effect on improving back muscle strength in patients with VF.\n\nKeywords: Kinesiotherapy, osteoporosis, vertebral fractures\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2442\n\nCorrelation between sarcopenia and osteoporosis in patients with post poliomyelitis syndrome\n\nM. Lissens\n\nFaculty of Biomedical Behavioural and Social Sciences, Thomas More University College, Geel, Belgium\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Muscle mass,-strength and-density, sarcopenia, exercise and physical activity are correlated with bone mass, bone density and osteoporotic fractures. Bone and muscle decay and dysfunction are seen in ageing, but in neurological disorders with muscular atrophy, bone loss can be seen also at younger ages. Materials and Methods: Femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) is measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry in 30 patients with post poliomyelitis syndrome, 18 women and 12 men, with a mean age of 56,3 years (ranging from 37 till 70). Eight women were postmenopausal. Results: Mean femoral neck BMD was −22,76 % or −1.86 SD and mean lumbar BMD was −13,21% or −1.25 SD. Low femoral bone mass was found in 80% of the patients (12 men and 12 women, of whom 5 were postmenopausal) and low lumbar bone mass was seen in 63% (9 men and 10 women, of whom 8 were post-menopausal). Six patients (all women) had normal femoral BMD and 11 normal lumbar BMD, whereas 6 (3 male and 3 female) had osteoporotic femoral BMD-scores (<−2.5 SD) and 3 (1 man and 2 women) had osteoporotic lumbar BMD. The remaining patients had osteopenia: 18 showed femoral osteopenia (<−1 SD) and 16 lumbar osteopenia. A significant difference in femoral (cortical) BMD between men and women was found: −27, 72% or −2,24 SD in men and −19,46% or −1,62 SD in women. Only small sex differences were seen in lumbar (trabecular) BMD: −13, 85% or −1.37 SD in men and −12,78% or −1,17 SD in women. The lowest BMD scores were present in patients with visible and clear lower limb muscle atrophy. Conclusion: A correlation is shown between low muscle mass and low cortical BMD can be explained by neurogenic bone loss, both due to muscle atrophy and disturbed regulation of bone by the central nervous system.\n\nKeywords: Osteoporosis, poliomyelitis, sarcopenia\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.04 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROMES OF THE NECK AND UPPER EXTREMITY (INCLUDING ENTHESOPATHY, TENDINITIS AND OTHERS)\n\nISPR8-0353\n\nEvaluation of clinical efficacy on interscalene injections by ultrasound-guided for neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome and ultrasonic observation\n\nJ. Wang\n\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine, Shenzhen Nanshan Hospital, Shenzhen, China\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Neurogenic Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (nTOS) is a clinical diagnosis that describes the symptomatic manifestation of the compression of brachial plexus. The objective of this sduty is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of interscalene injections by ultrasound-guided for nTOS and observe the ultrasonic characteristics of brachial plexus and theirsurroundings. Materials and Methods: Thirty suspect patients with nTOS were received tow stages treatments. First stage, all patients were received one week conventional therapies, that included analgesics treatment and psychological treatment; After that, the patients were given drug discontinuance 3 days. Then patients were got into the second stage, that were treated with interscalene injections by ultrasound-guided [Figure 1]. The changes of Vsiual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores before and after 2 stages treatment were recorded. At the interscalne level, the sonography and anatomic variations of the brachial plexus, superior and middle scalene muscles were observed [Figure 2].\n\nResults: Before treatment the VAS sores were (8.25 ± 1.53), after 2 weeks of treatment, the VAS sores were (2.57 ± 1.06), comparisons of these tow VAS scores, there were significant differences (P < 0.05). At the interscalene level, the brachial plexus were identified in the transverse view as round to oval hypoechoic structures, anterior and middle scalene muscles showed hyperechoic structures [Figure 3]. There were 16 patients whose three trunks of the brachial plexus passed through between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, accounted for 53.33% of the total;10 patients’ superior trunks of the brachial plexus pierced the anterior scalene muscle, their middle trunks and lower trunks passed through between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, accounted for 33.33% of the total;4 patients’ superior and middle trunks pierced the anterior scalene muscle, their lower trunks passed through between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, accounted for 13.33% of the total. Conclusion: Accurate positioning of interscalene injections by ultrasound-guided for the treatment of nTOS could have certain efficacy.

Although, there are conservative and surgical treatment options for SIS, there isn’t a gold standart therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of steroid phonophoresis in patients with SIS. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients with SIS were participated in this prospective, single-blind randomized controlled study and randomly divided into 2 groups: intervention group (steroid phonophoresis) and control group (sham ultrasound). Hot pack and shoulder exercises including pendulum, range of motion (ROM) and strengthening exercises were given all patients. Steroid phonophoresis was applied with 1% hydrocortisone cream (2gr/session hydrocortisone with 1.5 watt/cm2 ultrasound for 7 minutes). All participants completed 15 treatment session and were assessed with visual analog scale for pain intensity, shoulder ROM, muscle strength, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Rating Scale, Shoulder Disability Scale (SDS) and Nottingham Health Profile(NHP) for quality of life at pretreatment, post-treatment and 3rd month of treatment. Results: Baseline demographic characteristics of two groups were found similar except of their ages (the mean age ± SD 49.57 ± 6.73 for intervention group, 53.97 ± 5.81 for control group). Statistically significant improvements were observed in all parameters in both groups at the end of the therapy and 3 months afterterwards. There was a statistically significant difference in pain severity, shoulder ROM, UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale, SDS and NHP (pain, energy, sleep, social isolation, mobility) between two groups (P < 0.05).

Küçükakkaş, O. V. Yurdakul\n\nFaculty of Medicine, Bezmialem University, Istanbul, Turkey\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Nerve conduction studies (NCS) are the most reliable methods in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Although there are many clinical finding associated with CTS, there are a limited number of studies in the literature indicating the objective value of these finding for diagnosing. To evaluate the reliability of clinical examination in diagnosing CTS, with the help of NCS and detection of comorbid diseases likely to be risk factors in the CTS. Materials and Methods: We accepted 463 patients, who visited our outpatient clinic and presented with paresthesia or pain at the median nerve distribution. Demographic datas, clinical findings and comorbidities were recorded. According to the NCS results, patients were divided two groups (positive or negative) and analyzed. Results: 51.1% of the patients were negative and 48.9% were positive according to NCS. The highest sensitivity was at Durkan’s test (95.6%) and lowest was at thenar atrophy (22.1%). The highest specificity and positive predictive value were at thenar atrophy (100%) and the lowest were at Tinel’s test (40.9% and 59.1). The highest negative predictive value was at Durkan’s test (94%) and the thenar atrophy was the lowest (57.4%). There was a significant difference between the clinical findings in NCS groups (P < 0.001). %46.9 of the patients were had comorbidities. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities. There was a significant difference between the groups for diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism and gout (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Thenar atrophy and sensory loss were highly specific in CTS but had limited value in early detection, due to their low sensitivities and observations in more advanced stage patients. For their low specifity, provocative tests seems to be insufficient to establish a definite CTS diagnosis. Maybe only Durkan’s test could be considered primarily with more balanced values. Diabetes, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism and gout were significantly increase the CTS risk.\n\nKeywords: Carpal tunnel syndrome, diagnosis, nerve conduction studies\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2734\n\nCharacterization of local muscle fiber anisotropy using shear wave elastography in patients with chronic myofascial pain\n\nM.

It is believed that MTrPs are local contractures within the extrafusal fibers of skeletal muscles. Further characterizing muscle pathophysiology is desirable to design effective treatments. This study was designed to measure muscle fiber architecture in the neighborhood of MTrPs using ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography (SWE), a novel approach for quantitatively assessing muscle fiber. We hypothesized that muscle containing active (symptomatic) MTrPs has disorganized fiber architecture. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four participants (14 women, ages 20–60 years) met criteria for chronic myofascial pain affecting the neck region. All underwent a clinical history and physical examination of the neck and upper trapezius to identify MTrPs and pain self-report. A Supersonic Aixplorer ultrasound imaging system with an L10-4 ultrasound transducer was used to image the upper trapezius muscle. A custom transducer holder [Figure 1] enabled imaging through a 20mm diameter window placed over the palpable MTrP or normal tissue, and rotation of the imaging plane to precise angles from 0° (along fibers) to 90° (perpendicular to fibers). Peak shear wave velocity (SWV) is observed longitudinally along muscle fibers (0°), and is minimum across fibers (90°). Muscle fiber anisotropy (a measure of fiber alignment and organization) was quantified as the asymmetry (degrees) in the shear-wave velocity profile around the peak SWV. Results: Muscles with active (symptomatic) MTrPs (n = 24) exhibited greater anisotropy (14.25 ± 11.01°), compared to normal, asymptomatic muscle tissue (n = 12), which is more isotropic (7.16 ± 6.70°) (P < 0.05) [Figure 2]. A positive correlation was found between the maximum anisotropy and average pain (Pearson’s r = 0.54). Conclusion: Muscle containing active MTrPs is anisotropic compared to normal muscle tissue, suggesting muscle contractures are in regions of anisotropy. The degree of anisotropy correlates with pain levels.\n\nKeywords: Anisotropy, myofascial trigger points, shear wave\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.05 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROMES OF THE PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITY (INCLUDING ENTHESOPATHY, TENDINITIS AND OTHERS)\n\nISPR8-0157\n\nThe effect of additional strengthening and stretching of hip rotator muscles in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome: a randomized controlled crossover study\n\nA.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-over randomized study including 109 patients with PFPS (75 females and 34 males aged of 31.6 ± 10.8 years). Patients were randomly assigned into first protocol A (G1, n = 67) of A-B arm with standard rehabilitation or protocol B (G2, n = 42) of B-A arm with standard rehabilitation associated to strengthening of hip external rotator and abductor musculature with stretching of hip internal rotators. Each protocol consisted of 3 sessions a week for 4 weeks. After a washout period corresponding to the recurrence of the same painful symptoms experienced by the patient rehabilitation programs were crossed-over. A visual analog scale (VAS) evaluating perceived pain, Functional Index Questionnaire (FIQ) and Kujala patellofemoral score were administered at baseline, at the end of each rehabilitation protocol and at 12 weeks after the completion of the second protocol for each group. Results: Pain and function were significantly improved in both arms for the total population (P < 0.001) until the last follow up. Protocol B provided a more significant improvement in terms of pain and function in G2 (VAS: P = 0.03; Kujala: P = 0.04) and G1 (VAS: P = 0.02; Kujala: P = 0.02). Conclusion: Associating strengthening of hip abductors and external rotators and stretching of hip internal rotators provided better outcome in terms of pain and function in patients with PFPS which was maintained until the end of the study.\n\nKeywords: Patellofemoral pain syndrome, rehabilitation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0862\n\nKnee painful arc, imaging by dynamic sonography: a novel technique 1muhammad dughbaj, 2diaa shehab, 3salem alkandari, 4levent ozcakar\n\nM.

We describe in this study a novel technique to visualize soft tissue impingement at and above patellofemoral joint using simultaneous goniometry and real time dynamic sonography and to coin the term Knee Painful Arc. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients referred to PMR MSK US Unit with anterior knee pain and tenderness over quadriceps tendon underwent simultaneous goniometric measurements of the painful ROM during Keen flexion Extension and real time dynamic US to visualize which soft tissues are impinged at and above the patellofemoral joint [Figure 1]. Results: Dynamic US examination of two patients showed quadriceps fat pads and bursa impingement underneath prominent superior patellar osteophytes (Pincer Type) [Figure 2a] reproducing pain at the last 30 degrees of extension Seven patients showed quadriceps tendon (QT) impingement over prominent anterior osteophyte arising from femoral condyle (Cam Type) [Figure 2b] reproducing pain during the range of 60 degree to full flexion and six patients showed mixed impingement of QT, fat pads and bursa between femoral and patellar osteophytes (Mixed Type) [Figure 2c] with pain free arc between 30 and 80 degree flexion. Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first study to use dynamic US and goniometry to diagnose and coin the term knee painful arc,though painful arc of the shoulder is well described in literature, this technique can help understand mechanism and type of soft tissue impingement, modify exercise prescription using pain free arc exercise and improve rehabilitation outcome.\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.06 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - BACK PAIN AND SPINE DISORDERS\n\nISPR8-0517\n\nPatient acceptable symptom state for patient-reported outcomes in 2 populations of patients with non-specific chronic low back pain: a secondary analysis of 2 randomized trials\n\nC.

Materials and Methods: Tw0-hundres fifty six patients were included: 135 patients with cLBP and an active disc disease participated in a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy on pain at 1 month of a single glucocorticoid intradiscal injection, and 121 patients with cLBP and without an active disc disease participated in a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy on pain at 4 months of 12 sessions of immersive virtual reality. Self-rated health status at 1 month was assessed by using an external anchoring question from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form. Patients who self-rated their health as “excellent”, “very good” or “good” were considered as having an acceptable symptom state. PASS for PROs was estimated using the 75th percentile method. Estimates were compared between the 2 populations using bootstrap resampling. Logistic regression was used to determine baseline variables contributing to PASS achievement. Results: At 1 month, 137/256 (53.52%) participants self-rated their health as acceptable. In the whole population, PASS (95% IC) were 47.50 (40.00 to 50.00) for the lumbar-pain VAS, 30.50 (30.00 to 40.00) for the radicular-pain VAS, 39.27 (33.60 to 45.26) for the QUEBEC score, 9.95 (9.16 to 10.00) for the HAD Anxiety subscale, and 6.70 (6.00 to 8.00) for the HAD Depression subscale. PASS estimates did not differ between the 2 populations. Symptom intensity was the only baseline variable contributing to having an acceptable symptom state at 1 month. Conclusion: Our study provides PASS thresholds for commonly used PROs in cLBP. Our findings can be useful in interpreting the clinical relevance of PROs values. ClinicalTrials.gov.

Functional disability was assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Back Pain Functional Scale (BPFS). Assessmentswere done twice – before and after the treatment. Results: Reduction of pain intensity was statistically significant (p<0.05) in all groups at each stage of the study. However, the differences among the groups were not statistically significant (p>0.05). In all groups the change in the degree of disability measured by the ODI was statistically significant (p<0.05). The improvement in functional ability in patients as measured on the BPFS was statistically significant in all groups (p<0.05). Statistically significant differences were noticed between group C and group D (p<0.05). Conclusion: (1) All the methods used caused reduction in pain which lasted for at least 4 weeks. (2) The best improvement in the functional capability of patients was caused by the combined therapy consisted of manual therapy and PNF. (3) The degree of disability as measured in Oswestry Disability Index lowered evenly in all groups.\n\nKeywords: Back pain, kinesiotherapy, manual therapy\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2090\n\nEffectiveness of an outpatient rehabilitation program with multidisciplinary approach on return to work for patients with non-specific chronic lombal pain\n\nR.

Materials and Methods: A monocentric controlled trial with a 12-months follow-up, conducted in the French Valley Loire region from May 2009 to April 2013. Participants were working-aged patients with chronic low back pain referred to a French chronic low back pain care-network to support medical and occupational issues. Three treatment strategies, each for five weeks were compared: (i) Intensive and multidisciplinary program conducted in a rehabilitation center; (ii) Less intensive outpatient program conducted by a trained private physiotherapist; (iii) Mixed strategy combining the same outpatient program associated with a weekly multidisciplinary intervention. The effects of treatment conditions were compared using an “intention to treat” approach: Number of days’ sick leave during the 12-months following treatment, and quality of life and social ability assessed by auto-questionnaires. Results: A total of 349 patients (52.2% men, 42.5 ± 8.7 years old, median duration of sick leave = 206.0 days (92.0–301.0)) were included. Sick leave duration significantly decreased during the 12-months following treatment in the three groups. Physical capacity improved in intensive program and mixed strategy groups. There was no significant difference for the evolution of participants’ quality of life, social ability, and personal beliefs between the three groups. Conclusion: This study confirms that disparate treatments might show similar effectiveness because they could all work through concomitant changes in beliefs, attitudes, and coping mechanisms. The original mixed strategy can treat a larger number of chronic low back pain patients, at a lower cost and provide local community-based care.?\n\nKeywords: Chronic lombal pain, clinical trial, rehabilitation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0226\n\nEffect of fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural steroid injection in degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis – a randomized controlled trial\n\nM. Srivastava, A. K. Gupta, B. K. Ojha1, D. Kumar, S. Mishra, G. Yadav\n\nDepartments of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and 1Neurosurgery, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) is a common source of pain and disability in the elderly population. Epidural steroid injections are often used to treat lumbosacral radiculopathy in DLSS. There is paucity of clinical trials comparing caudal epidural steroid injections plus local anaesthetics with conservative treatment. Moderate and high-quality evidence for nonoperative treatment is lacking and thus prohibits recommendations for guiding clinical practice. So, the aim of this study was to compare the effects of conservative treatment (physical therapy) and caudal epidural steroid injection with physical therapy in patients of DLSS (grade A and B). Materials and Methods: An Open Label, Parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted from January 2016-August 2017 and patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were enrolled after written informed consent. The Trial was registered under the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI). Patients were randomized in two groups – 32 in Intervention Group A (caudal epidural steroid injection with physical therapy) and 32 in Control Group B (physical therapy only) with concealed allocation method. The outcome was assessed by Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), standing tolerance test and walking tolerance test at 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Results: Significant improvement in NPRS, ODI and standing tolerance test was observed at 3, 6 and 12 weeks (Group A >> Group B). Equivocal effect in NPRS and ODI was seen at 24 weeks (Group A ~ Group B). Improvement in mean claudication distance was seen at each follow up from baseline (Group A>> Group B). The probability of improvement in intervention group (A) was more than in control group (B). Conclusion: Epidural steroid administration improved pain, physical ability and claudication distance (>200 metres) at 12 weeks aiding an early return to routine activities. Physical therapy also shows clinical improvement in patients of DLSS and can be an appropriate treatment modality.\n\nKeywords: Caudal, epidural steroid, lumbar spinal stenosis\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-2434\n\nEffects of high intensity training on pain, disability, exercise capacity and muscle strength in persons with nonspecific chronic low back pain: preliminary rct results\n\nJ. Verbrugghe, A. Agten, S. Stevens, B. O. Eijnde, F. Vandenabeele, A. Timmermans\n\nREVAL Rehabilitation Research Center, Hasselt University, Diepenbeek, Belgium\n\nPresenter Email: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) is a musculoskeletal disorder affecting many people worldwide. Exercise therapy (ET) is an important component of NSCLBP management. However, effect sizes remain low. High Intensity Training (HIT) is an effective training method for improving physical fitness and health related parameters in healthy persons as well as for decreasing pain and disability in persons with chronic disorders. The value of HIT in NSCLBP rehabilitation is unclear. The aim of this study is 1) to compare HIT to conventional ET, and 2) to compare the effects of different modes of HIT, with regard to pain, disability, exercise capacity, and muscle strength, in persons with NSCLBP.\n\nMaterials and Methods: A five-arm parallel RCT (n = 150) is carried out consisting of an ET program (24 sessions/12 weeks) organized at REVAL (Hasselt University, Belgium) in persons with NSCLBP. Participants are randomly assigned into one of four intervention groups performing various modes of HIT or a control group performing moderate intensity training resembling conventional care [Figure 1]. Participants are measured at baseline and after completing the program. Primary outcome measures are pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), functional disability (Oswestry Disability Index), exercise capacity (VO2max during exercise testing), and abdominal and back strength (Newton/kg during isometric strength testing).\n\nResults: Forty-three persons with NSCLBP have completed the program (group average: n = 9). All outcomes showed time-related improvements in all groups (P > 0.001). No between group differences were noted in any outcomes. Conclusion: Preliminary data of this RCT suggest that HIT has positive effects on pain intensity, functional disability, exercise capacity, and isometric abdominal/back muscle strength, in persons with NSCLBP. Patient recruitment is still ongoing to increase the power of this study and further analyse the differences between HIT groups with specific modalities and conventional therapy.\n\nKeywords: Exercise therapy, high intensity training, low back pain\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0307\n\nIntradiscal glucocorticoid injection in chronic low back pain with modic 1 changes\n\nI.

The objectives of this work is to estimate the clinical profit at 1, 3 and 6 months after an intradiscal injection of prednisolone acetate versus a lidocain one in low back pain with Modic. Materials and Methods: Fifty patients with low back pain in failure of the medical treatment for more than 6 weeks where included in this prospective, double blind, randomized study. Results: Pain intensity was significantly improved à 1 month in the prednisolone acetate group compared to the lidocain group. A significant diffrence is also observed at 1 and 3 months in the activities of the everiday life of DALLAS questionnaire in favour of the glucocorticoid group. There was no significant difference, throughout the follow up on Oswestry evolution, comsuption of analgesic or in professional condition. Conclusion: Intradiscal injection of prednisolone acetate in low back pain with modic 1 changes reduces pain intensity at 1 month but not at 3 and 6 month versus lidocain.\n\nKeywords: Low back pain, modic\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0249\n\nTranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens) versus physiotherapy for chronic low back pain\n\nM.

Materials and Methods: Prospective and randomized study, from september 2010 until December 2016, compared two groups: 95 patients with CLBP treated by TENS versus 66 patients treated by physiotherapy (Infrared and Ultrasound). The duration of treatment was 12 weeks, 3 sessions a week/patient, evluated by: pain intensity, visual analog scale (VAS), neurological signs, MRI, length of sick-leave and the recourse to surgery. Follow up time was 12 months. Results: In the short and long-terms, pain relief was significantly better in group “TENS” compared with group “physiotherapy” (P < 0.001). The average of sick-leave was shorter in group TENS. However; in the two groups, the main radiological symptom was disc degeneration diseases.

Weigl, P. Stephan\n\nDepartment of Orthopaedics, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Ludwigs Maximilians Universität, München, Germany\n\nE-mail: [email protected]; [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: In patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) guidelines recommend multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) if other treatments were unsuccessful. However, little is known about the long-term effects of MBR in patients older than 65 years. The objective of this study was to compare the 12 months course of effects of MBR in patients older than 65 years to younger patients. Materials and Methods: In this naturalistic prospective observational cohort study 118 participants of a 3-week MBR were included. The MBR comprised exercise therapy, hydrotherapy, occupational therapy, psychological interventions, patient education and instructions to home exercise programs. Outcome was assessed by the condition specific North American Spine Society (NASS) questionnaire pain/function scale and the generic Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). From the eight SF-36 scales only Physical Functioning (PF), Bodily Pain (BP) and Mental Health (MH) were included in the analyses. Data were collected at the beginning of treatment, after 3 months and after 12 months. Participants were grouped into “Old” or “Young” with the cut-off 65 years. Statistical differences between follow-up and baseline scores were tested by paired t-tests. Standardized Effect Size (ES) was calculated by dividing the difference between entry and follow-up by the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline score. Results: In this study 59 patients were older than 65 years and 59 were younger. The mean ages of the groups old/young were 70 years and 57years respectively. In the group old 64% of patients were female and in the young group 73% were female. The course of the outcomes and the statistical significance of changes are presented in [Tables 1 and 1].\n\nConclusion: This study shows that a MBR program in cLBP patients has similar beneficial long-term effects on pain and condition specific function in patients older than 65 years compared to younger patients.\n\nKeywords: Geriatrics, low back pain, rehabilitation\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-0511\n\nMuscular capacity of the scoliotic spine evaluated by isokinetic device after orthopaedic treatment on a population of 50 patients. comparison with an asymptomatic population\n\nJ.

After a conservative treatment, it is important to estimate the residual scoliosis but also the muscular capacity of the spine. The objective of this study is to estimate the strength and the power of the trunk muscles by isokinetic dynamometer for teenagers treated orthopedically for idiopathic scoliosis. Materials and Methods: Monocentric and retrospective study made from 2015 to 2017 within the framework of a global assessment of the spine in 1 year of the definitive ablation of the brace. The evaluation was realized on the Cybex isokinetic dynamometer on a population of 50 scoliotic female patients. The flexor and extensor spinal muscles were explored in a concentric way in 60, 90 and 120 °/s speed. The isokinetic results were analyzed according to the type of scoliosis and according to the angulation. Results: The 14–16-year-old group is the most represented with 40 patients. For this group, we have a majority of thoracic and lumbar scoliosis (17 of every). In global analysis, the scoliotic patients present lower MFM than the control group, for three speeds, and the F/E ratio is increased. The power is the parameter which is the most impacted by the scoliosis. The MFM has decreased, the ratios of MFM have increased, the power is strongly lower than the asymptomatic group; the ratio of power has increased. Conclusion: The presence of the scoliosis is systematically associated with a decrease of strength of the flexor and extensors muscles of the spine. Afterward, one must study the implication of the orthopaedic treatment on the spinal muscular weakening by comparing the population studied for this work with a similar population, but untreated orthopedically.\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA2.08 MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS - MISCELLANEOUS\n\nISPR8-1773\n\nIterative percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for dupuytren’s disease: functional results at 5-year follow-up\n\nJ.

Widal, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France\n\nPresenter Email: [email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: Treatments of Dupuytren’s disease are currently not aetiological but symptomatic. They aim at reducing the flexion contracture of fingers and improving hand function, without excluding the possibility of recurrence. Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA) can be used as an iterative treatment for repeated recurrences. However, it has only been assessed as a unique therapeutic sequence and its long-term functional results have not been described. The aim of the study was to assess functional results of iterative PNA for Dupuytren’s disease at 5-year follow-up. Materials and Methods: Patients with digital flexion contracture due to Dupuytren’s disease were prospectively included and treated using PNA. Iterative treatment was performed as necessary during the follow-up. Assessment criteria were Tubiana score at 1 month, URAM functional score at 1-month and 5 years, satisfaction and need of second line open surgery at 5 years. Primary outcome was URAM functional score at 5 years in patients who did not undergo second line open surgery at follow-up. Results: Thirty patients were included: age 72 ± 10, ratio Female/Male 0, 2, diabetes 3, Tubiana score 7 ± 3, URAM score 13 ± 10. Three sessions of PNA were performed per patient in mean at 5-year follow-up. Two adverse events were observed: skin fissure recovering in one week (1 case), digital paresthesia recovering in 2 years (1 case). PNA reduced flexion contracture (Tubiana 2 ± 3, range 0–13, n = 30, p < 0.05). The URAM score was improved at 1 month (7 ± 9, range 0–35) and at 5 years (10 ± 12, range 0–41, n = 27, p < 0.05). Three patients underwent second line open surgery. 72% of patients were satisfied by PNA at 5 years and 83% recommended the treatment. Conclusion: Iterative PNA is safe, reduces flexion contracture and improves hand function in patients with Dupuyren’s disease. Functional improvement persists at 5 years in 90% of cases. Only 10% require second line open surgery.\n\nKeywords: Dupuytren’s disease, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nISPR8-1660\n\nPain interference with physical functioning is associated with physical activity level in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain\n\nP.

[email protected]\n\nIntroduction/Background: In case of musculoskeletal pain, a decreased physical activity (PA) could favor deconditioning and chronicity. However, several studies have failed to highlight low PA in people suffering chronic pain. To explore this issue further, we analyzed PA level of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) with an inertial sensor. The objective was to assess whether pain interference (PI) with physical functioning correlated with PA level. Materials and Methods: We studied 267 CMP patients [age: 44 years (SD: 12)]. Pain sites were upper limbs (43%), spine (23%), and lower limbs (34%). The participants wore an accelerometer during two consecutive days. We assessed the daily duration of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), that is, all movements with an intensity above slow walking. We used the average score of the three interference items related to physical functioning in the brief pain inventory (BPI) questionnaire (0-10). We fitted a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with MVPA as the dependent variable. We defined PI as a continuous predictor, and pain site as a 3-level categorical covariate. Main effects and interaction (PI x Pain site) were included in the model. Results: The average duration of MVPA was 76 min (SD: 51), that is, 10% as high as the accelerometer wear time (13h, SD: 2.6). Average PI score was 5.3 (SD: 2.2). GLMM shows that PI was significantly and negatively associated with MVPA. The interaction result shows that the percent change for each PI point was upper limbs: -2%; spine: -10%; and lower limbs -3%. Conclusion: The results show that PA level correlates to how CMP patients perceived the interference between pain and physical functioning. The association is particularly strong in patients with back pain. This finding supports the hypothesis that chronic pain impairs PA through the interference with daily physical activities.\n\nKeywords: Chronic musculoskeletal pain, physical activity, physical functioning\n\nDisclosure of interest: The authors did not declare any conflict of interest.\n\nA3.01 NEUROLOGICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS - STROKE\n\nISPR8-2289\n\nThe plasticity of resting-state brain networks associated with motor imagery training in chronic stroke patients\n\nH.
