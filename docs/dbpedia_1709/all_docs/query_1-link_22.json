        "text": "GPT5 or Gemini, I believe both technologies possess impressive capabilities, it is important to remember that innovation knows no bounds. Each generation of AI brings with it powerful intelligence that builds upon the previous one. Google Gemini AI represents a significant step forward in harnessing the potential of AI for various applications. It's clear we are at the beginning of the AI realms of possibility, as with every passing generation of the tech, we will witness exponential growth in AI's capabilities. The advancements made by Google's Gemini and GPT5 are indicative of a future where intelligent machines will continue to astound us. I don't believe it's a a matter of competition between them; but an opportunity to embrace the possibilities they offer. Together, they are pushing boundaries and unlocking new possibilities, we have to adapt.. #AI #datascience #ml #automation #dataanalytics #artificialintelligence https://lnkd.in/ergdYfaP\n\nGoogle just launched Gemini 1.0 (Largest Model), Here's everything that you need to know 1) Multimodality 🤖 Gemini is built from the ground up to be multimodal. This includes: • Text • Code • Audio • Image • Video This means it can operate across and combine different types of information. 2) Size 🚀 Gemini is optimised in three sizes: Ultra, Pro, and Nano. • Ultra — The largest and most capable model for complex tasks • Pro — The best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks • Nano — The most efficient model for on-device tasks 3) Performance 🛠️ Gemini Ultra’s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks. With a score of 90.0%, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU). 4) Integration with Bard 🤝 Today, Bard will use a tuned version of Gemini Pro for advanced reasoning, planning and understanding. Early next year, Google will introduce 'Bard Advanced'. This will integrate and give the public access to Gemini Ultra. 5) Applications 💡 Gemini's multimodality gives you the potential to transform any type of input into any type of output. • Generate code based on different inputs • Generate text and images, combined • Reason visually across languages 6) Development 🗓️ Starting on December 13, developers and enterprise customers can access Gemini Pro via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI. Google is further refining the Gemini Ultra model before making it broadly available early next year.

The clash of the AI titans has the community buzzing. Let's dive into the battle: 🔹 The SemiAnalysis blog declares \"Gemini Smashes GPT-4 By 5X\" – sparking intense debate. (https://lnkd.in/gQXZ4i32) 🔹 Google's access to top-tier chips is a game-changer in the contest. 🔹 OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman defends GPT-4's position with a hint of skepticism. 🌟 The Duel Details: Gemini packs a punch with its computing power and multi-modal approach, aiming to outshine GPT-4. But does more advanced hardware truly mean superior models? 🤔 The Verdict: Quality isn't solely about computational might. Training processes, data quality, and model performance matter too. Let the data showdown commence! 💥 Exciting Times Ahead: With Meta's Llama 2 also in the mix, and Gemini's release on the horizon, 2023 shapes up to be a pivotal year for AI. Who will emerge as the AI champion? Stay tuned! #AIWar #GeminiVsGPT4 #AIAdvancements #AIInnovation #yogyaopensource #chatgpt #gpt4 #ai\n\nNEW GOOGLE CHROME UPDATE Google announces yesterday that they are updating their chrome experience using AI! There are a lot of really cool features such as their writing assistant and their organize tabs function to make organizing your workspace a lot simpler. We haven't had this update appear in our chrome here at J&K Online Development but we will keep you posted on our thoughts. Has anyone else seen this update? You can find it when you go to settings, there will be a tab on the left side that says \"Experimental AI\". Let me know what you think? https://lnkd.in/eAgz7D3d\n\nEnjoy! Google's latest AI announcement Product Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash (or mini version) Quick summary * Currently available to developers and enterprises only * Functionality is similar to Open AI's GPT-4o with text, voice and video inputs * Ingests 15x more info per request compared with GPT 4o * The term infinite context appears frequently. The claim is that Gemini 1.5 Pro remembers everything in every interaction to improve quality of its responses. Watch this space! Great article on its key features and use cases. https://lnkd.in/eCsj4uPF\n\nA new piece by me on Ben's Bites today on how AI is creating a viable on-ramp for AR-enabled work. 👉 Read it here (fyi paywall): https://lnkd.in/gZdXE-U7 👇 Quick snippet: AI might unlock the long-foretold promise of meaningful Augmented Reality (AR) for a broad spectrum of workers. All of the big players in AI—Microsoft, Google, OpenAI—are showing signs of this eventuality, with new releases around voice, video, and AI agents providing a glimpse into what our future interactions with computers might look like. Dan Shipper from Every noted from his conversation with Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott (https://lnkd.in/g_x37aFt) at the company’s Build conference last week that “agents are the future of software.” From Dan: Scott noted that he thinks “agent” interactions—like the ones that Copilot enables—are the future of software. “One of the things that will probably happen is that you’re going to be using agents more than you’ll be using [apps or websites],” he said. Pair this take from Scott with OpenAI and Google’s newest releases of voice, video, and agent assistants from their GPT-4o announcement and I/O developer conference a few weeks ago, respectively, and it’s clear that the leaders in AI are all focusing on developing new paradigms of human-computer interfaces, with AI at the core of these more nascent modalities of interaction. 👉 Read the rest here (fyi paywall): https://lnkd.in/gZdXE-U7\n\nGoogle and OpenAI: Advancing AI with Universal Agents This month, Google and OpenAI introduced major advancements in AI, enhancing the natural interaction capabilities of their agents. Google I/O 2024 Highlights - 🚀 **Project Astra**: A universal AI agent that identifies neighborhoods, describes objects, and provides in-depth knowledge, moving towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). - 🌐 **Gemini Integration**: Integrated into Google Docs, Sheets, Gmail, and Chat, allowing seamless work across text, images, video, and code. It offers personalized assistance by accessing emails and documents, though full benefits require deep integration into the Google ecosystem. OpenAI's 2024 Releases - 👁️ **GPT-4 Turbo with Vision**: Combines visual and textual data to analyze images and provide detailed responses, aiding applications like BeMyEyes for the visually impaired. - 🎥 **Sora**: A generative video model that creates high-quality videos from text descriptions, using advanced techniques to process video data in chunks. Key Dates - 📅 **Project Astra**: Announced May 2024. - 📅 **Gemini Integration**: Early 2024. - 📅 **Sora**: February 2024, in testing phase. - 📅 **GPT-4 Turbo with Vision**: Public preview November 2023."
