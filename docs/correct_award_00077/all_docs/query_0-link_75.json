        "text": "Today, the USPS issued the newest stamp in its Literary Arts series, honoring novelist Saul Bellow, recipient of three National Book Awards, a Nobel Prize, and a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nFittingly, the stamp depicts Bellow on a Chicago street, wearing a fedora and looking like he knows something you don’t. The stamp was designed by Ethel Kessler, with original art by illustrator Joe Ciardiello, based on photographs of Bellow from 1982. “To keep the writer’s image as the focal point, the artist painted much of the background in neutral colors using a pale-yellow wash and some brownish-grays and a bit of purple,” the USPS tells us in a press release."
