        "text": "DATE April 7, 2005 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nFiller: By policy of WHYY, this information is restricted and has\n\nbeen omitted from this transcript\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCommentary: Pros and cons of adjectives used to describe the\n\npresident's Social Security proposal\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\n`The personal is political,' people say, but the debates over the president's\n\nSocial Security proposals have given that phrase a new meaning. Our linguist\n\nGeoff Nunberg has these thoughts about the dueling adjectives that supporters\n\nand opponents of the plan have been using.\n\nGEOFF NUNBERG:\n\nNot many people are in a position to evaluate the administration's Social\n\nSecurity plan in all its gnarly details, so a lot is hanging on the way it's\n\nbranded. The White House has been insisting that the media should use the\n\nphrase `personal accounts' to describe the proposal, which allows people to\n\ndivert a portion of their payroll taxes into the stock market, rather than\n\ntalking about `private accounts' or `privatization.' President Bush says that\n\nprivatization is a trick word that's simply intended to scare people. And the\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee has called it a false and\n\nmisleading term.\n\nThe campaign has clearly had an effect on the media. As of last month, the\n\nproportion of stories that describe the accounts as personal rather than\n\nprivate had doubled since November.\n\nWhat makes this awkward is that advocates of the administration's plan were\n\ntalking about privatization and private accounts themselves, until recently\n\nwhen polls and focus groups showed that the words made voters nervous. That's\n\ncreated some delicate moments for the administration, particularly since old\n\nhabits die hard. A few months ago the president corrected a Washington Post\n\nreporter who asked a question about the administration's privatization plan.\n\n`You mean the personal savings accounts?' Bush said. `We don't want to be\n\neditorializing.' But when the reporter pointed out that the president himself\n\nhad talked about private accounts and partial privatization just a few months\n\nearlier, Bush said, `Maybe I did. It's amazing what happens when you're\n\ntired.'\n\nSome critics have described this linguistic recall campaign as Orwellian, but\n\nthat really isn't fair. This isn't a question of using a deceptive euphemism\n\nin place of an honest description, after all. The administration's merely\n\nswapping one vague tag for another when the first one turns out not to poll so\n\nwell. And with the wisdom of hindsight, supporters of the administration's\n\nplan are happy to explain why privatization was actually the wrong word all\n\nalong. `Privatization means you're going to take the program out of the\n\nfederal government and put it in the hands of private individuals totally,'\n\nsaid Republican Jim McCrery, the chairman of the House Ways and Means\n\nSubcommittee on Social Security. `Whereas with the president's plan,' McCrery\n\nsaid, `people's investment choices are very limited, and they can't use the\n\nmoney for anything but buying an annuity when they retire.' Critics respond\n\nthat private is an apt term for a plan that has people turning over their\n\npayroll taxes to Wall Street mutual fund managers.\n\nBut even if Republicans can fight the definition duel to a standoff, their\n\nreal problem is how to disown private without bailing out on the time-honored\n\nRepublican rhetoric that goes along with it. Back in 2001, for example,\n\nPresident Bush was saying, `I want to give younger workers the opportunity to\n\nmanage some of their own money in the private markets.' That reference to\n\npeople's own money is the sort of language that comes with the Republican\n\nsystem disk, along with words like `individual,' `ownership' and `choice.'\n\nBut it's hard to square that language with the recent assurances that people\n\nwon't actually have much control over their accounts.\n\nYou could hear the strain in the president's remarks at the White House\n\nEconomic Summit in December. `People are not going to be allowed to take\n\ntheir own money for their retirement account and take it to Las Vegas to shoot\n\ndice,' Bush said. But normally when a Republican starts a sentence by\n\ntalking about people's own money, you don't expect him to finish by saying\n\nwhat they're not allowed to do with it.\n\nThe rhetorical challenge here is to find language that suggests the idea of\n\nownership without actually implying possession. And no word splits that\n\nmetaphysical seam more neatly than `personal' does. The president can talk\n\nabout `your own personal account' without creating any of the unease that\n\n`your own private account' might engender. After all, `your own personal' is\n\nthe phrase that marketers use when they want to convey pride of possession\n\nwithout suggesting that they're conveying title in the bargain, as in, `not\n\nyour own exactly but just for you.'\n\nDo a Google search on `your own personal,' and you come up with a staggering\n\ntwo and half million hits: `Create your own personal coat of arms';\n\n`MovieTickets.com, your own personal box office'; `choose from thousand of\n\ntunes to select your own personal ring tone.' I got a letter from my bank\n\nonce telling me that I'd been assigned my own personal banker. I thought that\n\nwas pretty cool, until I realized that all it meant was that there was\n\nsomebody I could reach at an 800 number without always having to drill down\n\nthrough the phone menu.\n\n`Your own personal retirement account' seems to fit the pattern to a T. As\n\nthe Republican pollster and language consultant Frank Luntz puts it, when you\n\npersonalize something, whether monogrammed towels or Social Security, you\n\nenhance ownership by allowing the owner to leave his or her mark on it. The\n\ncomparison seems fair enough, though I don't know how far Luntz has thought it\n\nthrough. I mean, the thing about personalized towels is that they're not\n\nreturnable if it turns out they don't keep you dry.\n\nGROSS: Geoff Nunberg is a Stanford linguist and author of \"Going Nuclear:\n\nLanguage, Politics, and Culture in Confrontational Times.\"\n\nBillie Holiday was born 90 years ago today. Here's how she sounded in 1935\n\nwhen she was 20. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of song)\n\nMs. BILLIE HOLIDAY (Singer): (Singing) Ooh, ooh, ooh, what a little\n\nmoonlight can do. Ooh, ooh, ooh, what a little moonlight can do to you.\n\nYou're in love, your heart's a-fluttering all day long. You only stutter\n\n'cause your poor tongue just will not utter the words `I love you.' Ooh, ooh,\n\nooh, what a little moonlight can do. Wait a will a while till a little\n\nmoonbeam comes peeping through. You'll get bored. You can't resist him at\n\nall, you said, when you have kissed him as--ooh, ooh, what a little moonlight\n\ncan do.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nAnnouncer: This is NPR, National Public Radio.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, the always exasperated comic Lewis Black. We'll get to\n\nhear what he sounds like when he isn't angry. Black is a regular commentator\n\non \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\" and he has a new memoir. Also, we\n\nlisten back to a 1993 interview with the writer and teacher Frank Conroy. He\n\ndied yesterday at the age of 69.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Lewis Black discusses his new memoir, CD, his career\n\nand childhood\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nLewis Black is a stand-up comic and commentator on \"The Daily Show with Jon\n\nStewart,\" the nightly show of political satire on Comedy Central. Black's\n\npolitical and social commentaries always seem fueled by his anger and\n\nexasperation. The cartoonist Jules Feiffer has said, `Lewis Black has to\n\nshout because he knows that no one who counts is listening. We, who do not\n\ncount, depend on and are grateful for the common sense behind his comic rage.\n\nWhen power corrupts, Lewis erupts.' Now Black has a new memoir called\n\n\"Nothing's Sacred\" and a new CD released by Comedy Central Records.\n\nLet's start with a commentary he gave on \"The Daily Show\" last month.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\"; music and applause)\n\nMr. LEWIS BLACK (Comedian and Commentator): With our troops overextended,\n\nintelligence reform bogged down, gas prices at an all-time high and millions\n\nof kids without health care, it was comforting last week to see Congress take\n\non the most pressing issue of all: Do baseball players use steroids?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. BLACK: Here's a hint. Yes!\n\n(Soundbite of laughter and applause)\n\nMr. BLACK: On Thursday, seven former and current big-leaguers spoke before\n\nCongress in testimony far more riveting than an actual baseball game. The\n\nstar attraction, 6'5\", 220 pounds, able to bench press the mezzanine at Busch\n\nStadium: Mark McGwire. He'll be staring down a tough opponent: the truth.\n\nMr. MARK McGWIRE (Former Baseball Player): Well, sir, I'm not here to talk\n\nabout the past.\n\nMr. BLACK: Strike one!\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. McGWIRE: Like I said earlier, I'm not going to go into the past and talk\n\nabout my past.\n\nMr. BLACK: Strike two!\n\nMr. McGWIRE: I'm not here to talk about the past.\n\nMr. BLACK: Strike three! No one came off worse than Big Mac. At one point\n\nthe strain of not answering anything even made him start crying. Crying?\n\nThere's no crying in baseball testimony!\n\n(Soundbite of cheers and applause)\n\nMr. BLACK: Fortunately, Congressman Mark Souder wasn't letting him off the\n\nhook.\n\nRepresentative MARK SOUDER (Republican, Indiana): If the Enron people come in\n\nhere and say, `Well, we don't want to talk about the past,' do you think\n\nCongress is going to let them get away with that?\n\nMr. BLACK: A fascinating hypothetical.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. BLACK: What would happen if the Enron guys got dragged before Congress?\n\nUnidentified Man #1: I must respectfully decline to answer, on Fifth\n\nAmendment grounds, all the questions of this committee and subcommittee.\n\nUnidentified Man #2: Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response\n\nto all questions here today?\n\nUnidentified Man #3: Yes, I will. I respectfully decline to answer the\n\nquestion based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the\n\nUnited States.\n\nMr. BLACK: OK. But if the subject had been steroids, they really would've\n\nlet him have it.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: Lewis Black, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMr. BLACK: My pleasure.\n\nGROSS: Can you talk about how this commentary was written, like what the\n\ngenesis of it was?\n\nMr. BLACK: Well, I'm going to burst a bubble here. I don't write the\n\ncommentary, so--I perform it. Essentially for a long time my segment was an\n\nisland unto itself, and then Jon, once he had a vision of the show, began to\n\nbring me into the fold by giving us other kind of topics he wanted us to do.\n\nAnd then we would--so that was already narrowed down. We would do the same\n\nsort of thing; I would write, kick it back. And then my career kind of took\n\noff, and I began to travel more. I wasn't there as much as I could be, and\n\nso--and then by the time, which--now this is just about a year and a half, I\n\nguess, now, two years maybe, the writers at the show were writing me, you\n\nknow--they're writing a better me than I can.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: So when the writers write a piece for you, do you have a chance to\n\nmake any changes you want to?\n\nMr. BLACK: Oh, yeah. I can throw stuff back to them. I mean, what happens\n\nis they write it, and they send it to me. I look at it, but usually they--it\n\ngoes immediately back to the staff there--you know, the guys in charge. They\n\nlook at it again. They rework it and then they send it back to me, and then\n\nthey rework it again. And when I get it--the last time that I get it is\n\nusually when I'll throw some things in.\n\nGROSS: How would you describe your persona on stage?\n\nMr. BLACK: Just basically a very deeply frustrated individual who expresses\n\nhis frustration through anger.\n\nGROSS: And does that describe you off stage, too?\n\nMr. BLACK: No, I don't have the energy for that.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. BLACK: People always ask me, `Are you like that all the time?' And I\n\nsaid, `If I was like that, I'd be dead.'\n\nGROSS: How did you create this on-stage persona of the deeply frustrated,\n\nangry guy?\n\nMr. BLACK: It's always been a part of my personality, and I'd always kind of\n\nhad that. And I never really thought I'd become a comic. I thought I was\n\ngoing to be a playwright. And so I was doing it on the side for fun, and I\n\nwould kind of work on, you know, ways to approach it. And I never--nothing\n\nwas working. And then Dan Ballard, who's a very funny comedian who works out\n\nof Michigan, was watching me one night and came up and said, `You know, the\n\nnext time you go back on stage,' he said, `you know, you start yelling, OK?\n\nBecause, listen, you're angry. I yell on stage,' he said, `all the time. I'm\n\nnot angry, and I'm yelling. And I shouldn't be yelling. And you're angry,\n\nand you should be yelling.' And that was it, and that really released it all.\n\nGROSS: Did you model any of your approach on your father or on older people\n\nin your family?\n\nMr. BLACK: I think I modeled it a little bit on my mother and a bit from my\n\ngrandfather, who was--Wow!--he was Mr. Angry. He was...\n\nGROSS: What would he get angry about, and how would he sound when he was\n\nangry?\n\nMr. BLACK: Everything. I mean, you know...\n\nGROSS: Ah, great.\n\nMr. BLACK: ...he was in a constant state of complaint. But he seemed\n\nto--like my mother--it's like I've said about my mother: As long as there's\n\nsomething--you know, as long as there's something to be angry about, she will\n\nlive forever. And my grandfather pretty much had that going. I mean, he\n\nwould just go--the Vietnam War, he goes--he was like--you know, he sat there\n\nin the living room. We were watching the 6:00 news, and he goes, you know--he\n\nsaid, `If I knew it was going to be like this, I could've stayed in Russia.'\n\nAnd I go, `You don't want to be there.' I said, `You're crazy.' He says,\n\n`No.' And he'd go on: `This is crap.' And he would bitch, and I would find\n\nit funny.\n\nGROSS: In your new book, you write a little bit about what you were like as a\n\nkid, and you say, `For a time I was a square squared. My mother dressed me in\n\nirregular clothing, and my pants were always way, way too baggy. When I asked\n\nwhy they were so big, my mother replied, \"Because you have a big crotch.\" The\n\ntop button of my shirt was always buttoned, and I wore big tortoise-shell\n\nglasses, so I looked like a dump truck in heat.' (Laughs) So were you a nerdy\n\nkid?\n\nMr. BLACK: Yeah. I really hit that period of, like, 11, 12, which--those\n\nyears which are difficult and fragile at best. I was pretty nerdy.\n\nGROSS: Did having big glasses even when you were a kid affect your social\n\nlife?\n\nMr. BLACK: Oh, yeah. You know, you--and especially since--as I look back at\n\nthe pictures, I go, you know, `Was nobody fashion conscious?' My uncle was an\n\noptometrist, and so I was going, `What was he putting these glasses on my face\n\nfor?'\n\nGROSS: (Laughs) Now you say that your parents weren't observant Jews, except\n\nfor like the High Holy Days. But what--you went to a Yom Kippur service,\n\nwhich is the Day of Atonement for Jewish people, and it really shook you up.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nMr. BLACK: Well, when I was really young, my--the first--I'll never forget\n\nthe first Shim Kippur(ph), Yom Kippur service, because at first they'd play a\n\npiece of music that is--it's, I say, all the music that Alfred Hitchcock has\n\nin his films. The scary music is based on a thing called the Kol Nidre, where\n\nthis organ kind of plays--for a kid, it was too spooky for words. It's\n\nsupposed to, I believe, inspire awe, but when you're, you know, five to eight,\n\nit inspires panic. And you almost sense that there should be bats flying\n\naround.\n\nAnd my--and then the idea of it is that that is the day in which God writes\n\nyour name in the Book of Life or the Book of Death. And that was a concept,\n\ndeath, that had not crossed my table. No one in the family had died as of\n\nyet. I had never thought of it as something that was hooked up with God; that\n\nthere was some sort of a power figure that I was supposed to make sure that I\n\nkept at bay because he might decide to kill me. And it really had a big\n\neffect on me. It scared the hell out of me.\n\nGROSS: So you started praying compulsively. What were your prayers like?\n\nMr. BLACK: I did start praying compulsively. It began with--my idea was that\n\nif I had--because what you do is when you get in there, you apologize for all\n\nthe bad things you did during the year. And, you know, I was not respectful\n\nof my parents, I wasn't nice to my friends, all of this stuff. So whenever a\n\nthought or an action that I thought was a red-line situation crossed my desk\n\nafter this, I would immediately respond by having to say something to the\n\neffect of `I'm sorry, God.' And that started slowly, and then it built up to\n\nI'd say 10 `I'm sorry, Gods.'\n\nAnd then it grew as--thoughts kind of became a little worse because I think\n\nwhat occurs when you get into that tape as a child is that it's an\n\nobsessive-compulsive behavior. So the thoughts became worse, and then the\n\nprayers became--so then I'd have to say `I'm sorry, God.' And then after I'd\n\nsay, I'm sorry, God,' I had to thank him. So it was `I'm sorry, God. Thank\n\nyou, God.' Then I began to add breaths in between. So it'd be, `I'm sorry,\n\nGod' (inhales). I'd have to breathe in. Then I'd go, `God,' breathe out.\n\nAnd then I'd have to breathe in, `Thank you, God,' and then breathe out. I\n\nhad, like, breath patterns, too, that I got. It was an elaborate system that\n\nI had developed that I'm glad isn't on film today.\n\nGROSS: (Laughs) So did the rabbi know about this?\n\nMr. BLACK: Nobody knew about it. I never mentioned it to anybody. It was\n\nbetween me and my Maker, me and my God.\n\nGROSS: So how did you stop?\n\nMr. BLACK: My grades started to fall because--I've asked my parents; they\n\ndon't remember--they never caught me doing it. My friends at school, because\n\nof the breathing patterns, they would--there were kids sitting around me\n\nlooking at me going, `What is the matter with you?'--you know, because I'd\n\nstop in the middle of a test and go through this. And they took--my parents\n\ntook me to some sort of a counselor or psychiatrist at the University of\n\nMaryland, and I went once. And I knew I didn't really want to talk about it,\n\nso I'd better stop it. And I really did; it stopped me on a dime.\n\nGROSS: Well, Lewis Black, great to talk with you. Thank you so much.\n\nMr. BLACK: Well, this was really a pleasure. It's--I really had a good time.\n\nGROSS: Lewis Black has a new memoir called \"Nothing's Sacred.\" Tomorrow\n\nwe'll hear from \"Daily Show\" correspondent Stephen Colbert.\n\nComing up, we listen back to a 1993 interview with the writer and teacher\n\nFrank Conroy. He died yesterday at the age of 69. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nProfile: 1993 interview with Frank Conroy, who died yesterday at\n\nage 69\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThe writer and teacher Frank Conroy died yesterday at the age of 69 of colon\n\ncancer. For 18 years he directed the Writers Workshop at the University of\n\nIowa, where he helped shape the early work of some now-important writers. He\n\nalso wrote a 1967 memoir called \"Stop-Time\" that is now considered a classic.\n\nIn Conroy's New York Times obituary today, Charles McGrath describes\n\n\"Stop-Time\" as `a lucid and evocative memoir that has been a model for\n\ncountless young writers, the sort of book that is passed along like a trade\n\nsecret.' But after \"Stop-Time,\" Conroy's life fell apart. It wasn't until 18\n\nyears later that he completed his second book, a collection of short stories\n\ncalled \"Midair.\"\n\nI spoke with Conroy in 1993 after the publication of his novel \"Body & Soul,\"\n\nthe story of a young music prodigy who lives in poverty but finds a wonderful,\n\ndedicated teacher and goes on to become a great musician. I asked Frank\n\nConroy if there were any parallels between him and his character.\n\n(Soundbite of 1993 interview)\n\nMr. FRANK CONROY (Author): I've played the piano all my life. In fact, I\n\nplayed professionally as a jazz pianist for about five years and sort of\n\nbush-league for another five years. I played jazz, and I don't--the hero of\n\nthis book is a prodigy and is a very, very good pianist. I'm a competent jazz\n\npianist. I didn't have a teacher. In a way, that's probably--you know, every\n\nnovel contains fantasies, I think, and this one's fantasies about teachers and\n\nfather figures. And I didn't have a father. I didn't have a teacher, but\n\nClaude does, you see?\n\nGROSS: Your father left the family when you were about three or something.\n\nMr. CONROY: That's right. He was a manic-depressive, so he was\n\ninstitutionalized most of the time. They didn't have lithium in those days.\n\nGROSS: And what about not having a piano teacher? What was the reason for\n\nthat?\n\nMr. CONROY: Well, there was a boarder in our apartment who was a\n\nprofessional musician, and there was an attempt at--there was an attempt at\n\nhim giving me some lessons. But he was a sadistic psychopath, and it turned\n\nme off. It turned me off very rapidly. The whole idea of piano lessons--you\n\nknow, he used to squeeze my neck with his fingers and say--and he really was,\n\nhe was nuts. But--so I went back, and I learned myself--I learned very\n\nslowly. At first I learned the blues, boogie-woogie, which I picked up, you\n\nknow, off the radio from Harlem uptown. And I just stuck with it.\n\nIn fact, in this book--in the writing of this book, I had to go back and\n\nreally re-educate myself about music from the beginning on. And I had to\n\nlearn some new stuff, some stuff that I didn't know. The twelfth-tone, in\n\nparticular, was a challenge.\n\nGROSS: It's funny. Coming out of a background where you had no father figure\n\nand no teacher, you kind of went on to, among other things, become a very\n\nwell-known teacher as the head of the Writers Program at the University of\n\nIowa.\n\nMr. CONROY: Yes, and I also have three sons.\n\nGROSS: We're listening to a 1993 interview with writer Frank Conroy. He died\n\nyesterday. Conroy's influential memoir \"Stop-Time\" was published in 1967, but\n\nit was 18 years before his next book was published.\n\n(Soundbite of 1993 interview)\n\nGROSS: I'm sure you've been asked this a lot, but what happened in the\n\ninterim?\n\nMr. CONROY: A certain amount of trouble in my life, sort of serious trouble:\n\nthe end of my first marriage; I had to leave my two kids, which was difficult\n\nfor me because, you know, my father left. My mother died a very long, slow\n\nprocess, and there was, really, nobody else to look after her, except me, and\n\nthat was very draining. And it was a difficult time. Also, I didn't have any\n\nmoney, and I'd spent so many years writing I didn't--you know, I wasn't--I\n\nreally didn't have the training to do any kind of ordinary job. So it was\n\ntough. It was a tough time.\n\nGROSS: What was it like for you to be looking after your mother? From your\n\nmemoir \"Stop-Time,\" you get the feeling your mother didn't always do such a\n\ngood job looking after you.\n\nMr. CONROY: That's true. I hope I did a better job (laughs).\n\nBut, you know, I mean, good heavens, I mean, the woman was dying. I mean--and\n\nI had to--you know, I went to the--first of all, getting her into a hospital\n\nwas hard. She was in and she was out, and then I took her back in the last\n\ntime. If you've read my story \"Midair,\" there's a story in there where it's\n\nautobiographical, and it's one of these things--it really happened, but it's\n\none of those things you can't put into a story because it's too convenient.\n\nI was driving her to the hospital for what I knew would be the last time down\n\nthe Merritt Parkway from Connecticut into New York. And we had both been so\n\npreoccupied with this that we forgot. And as we were driving along, suddenly\n\nit got dark, and everything changed in the exterior world. It's because there\n\nwas an eclipse of the sun, you know? And that actually happened. So I put it\n\nin the story.\n\nGROSS: Boy, that is the kind of thing I think you might have been afraid to\n\nput in the story because it seems like it's too much of a metaphor.\n\nMr. CONROY: Yes, but it happened. I mean, not that that's really any\n\ndefense. You know, students will often say that to me: `But it happened,'\n\nyou know. And I say, `Well, I don't care if it happened. It isn't any good.'\n\nBut there I just couldn't stop myself from doing it. I put it in, and I\n\nthought it worked.\n\nGROSS: Frank Conroy recorded in 1993. He died yesterday at the age of 69.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Fund Drive).\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Let's get back to our 1993 interview with the writer Frank Conroy.\n\nHe's the author of the now-classic memoir \"Stop-Time.\" For 18 years he\n\ndirected the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. Conroy died\n\nyesterday of colon cancer. He was 69.\n\n(Soundbite of 1993 interview)\n\nGROSS: Your father was a drinker, and you went through a period when you were\n\ndrinking a lot, too. Did that make it even worse? Did you have this fear\n\nthat you were picking up some of the habits of a man you barely knew?\n\nMr. CONROY: Well, I don't think I felt I was picking up his. I mean,\n\nwhatever sins or stupid things or self-destructive things I was doing were,\n\nreally, not modeled after anyone. They were...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. CONROY: I found them myself, you know.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. CONROY: But, yes, indeed--I mean, it's funny. I've noticed this about a\n\nlot of artists: that, really, they have a very peculiar relationship to their\n\nbody, as you know, as if it's just some old suitcase you have to lug around\n\nwith you--some old, battered up suitcase. And so there's a--and I certainly\n\nhad that. I mean, I didn't take care of myself. I drank too much. I smoked\n\na lot. I finally stopped smoking. But, you know, yes, I didn't help matters,\n\nI think, by the various methods that I used to escape the depression and the\n\nconfusion that I felt.\n\nGROSS: Boy, I really like your description about how a lot of artists see\n\ntheir bodies as...\n\nMr. CONROY: Yeah. It--well, we live in our heads so much, you know.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMr. CONROY: I mean, the important stuff really takes place in some kind of\n\nhyperspace inside the brain or inside the imagination. And I know a number\n\nof--Marilynne Robinson--I was talking to her. And it turns out that, you\n\nknow--I write in bed. I always have, ever since the beginning. I put up\n\npillows behind my back, and, you know, I put the legal pad across my knees and\n\nwrite. And it's funny. I mean, I really need to do that. And I found out\n\nthat Marilyn also writes in bed, and I--we were laughing about it because what\n\nwe're trying to do, of course, is sort of deny the existence of our bodies at\n\nall. You know, you get in bed...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nMr. CONROY: ...as if, you know...\n\nGROSS: And it's time to dream and just, like, lose consciousness.\n\nMr. CONROY: Yes. Yes. And, you know, it's--you do everything to sort of\n\nminimize your physical awareness of your body while you enter the dream of the\n\nwork, you know, and you're concentrating very intensely. And, you know, you\n\nsee pictures and you hear sounds and smell smells, and you're doing all of\n\nthat. And your body seems to have nothing to do with it.\n\nGROSS: Well, did that ever change for you? Did you ever get to feel that you\n\nhad to take care of your body and kind of...\n\nMr. CONROY: Sure it did.\n\nGROSS: ...be a part of your physical self and all of that?\n\nMr. CONROY: Yeah, sure it did.\n\nGROSS: What brought you around on that?\n\nMr. CONROY: Well, a couple of things. One, I went too far, and so, you know,\n\nI finally woke up that, `Hey, Frank, you know,' I said to myself, `this is\n\ncrazy. You know, you could be--you'd better stop this stuff.' So there was\n\nthat. And then there was the birth of my third child, who is six years old,\n\nand that changes things, and advancing age. You know, I'm 57. So I stopped\n\nsmoking. I didn't stop drinking. I still drink a little bit in the evening,\n\nmaybe a little bit too much sometimes, but it's very much under control. And\n\nI live a very stabilized life and have for quite a while.\n\nGROSS: Your memoir \"Stop-Time\" begins and ends with you in a Jaguar driving\n\nvery fast from London to about 20 miles south of the city, where you lived.\n\nMr. CONROY: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And the prologue is about the release of that drive, the release of\n\ndriving really fast in a sports car.\n\nMr. CONROY: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: The epilogue is the car crash, where you nearly get killed, and you're\n\nmiraculously saved because the car nearly gets wrapped around a fountain.\n\nMr. CONROY: Yes. That was prophetic, wasn't it?\n\nGROSS: What do you mean?\n\nMr. CONROY: I mean, in \"Stop-Time,\" that's a warning, and in a sense maybe I\n\nwas warning myself because I--you know, it wasn't a car and a particular\n\nfountain, but I was living pretty dangerously later. And I was lucky to get\n\nout unscathed.\n\nGROSS: Do you still vividly remember the moment of the crash?\n\nMr. CONROY: No. I was pretty drunk, you know, and it was late. I remember\n\nit, but I can't--you don't--I remember more what I was thinking than I have an\n\nactual sense memory of the event, you know? I remember more what I was\n\nthinking, which is that I was really--it seemed to me that, you know, I\n\nclearly was--I could die. I mean--and I remember--it was interesting because\n\nit didn't particularly frighten me, which I...\n\nGROSS: You think that's 'cause you were drunk?\n\nMr. CONROY: No, it happened to me later when I was sober. I had a--at one\n\npoint about 10 years ago, I had a hemorrhaging duodena ulcer, and I, you know,\n\nwent to the hospital real fast. And the doctor told me later that I had--15\n\nminutes, you know, I had tops. If it'd been 15 minutes longer, I would have\n\nbeen DOA. But I knew when I was in that emergency room when--you know, when\n\nyou see that there are nine people around you, and every one of them is doing\n\nsomething, you know that you're in trouble. And, of course, I was bleeding.\n\nI was hemorrhaging. There was blood all over the emergency room, and I knew I\n\ncould die right then. And I didn't feel frightened, and that time I was\n\ncertainly quite sober. I felt--I didn't feel frightened. I felt like, you\n\nknow, sort of, `What a shame. I mean, this is too early. I've got stuff to\n\ndo.'\n\nGROSS: Frank Conroy recorded in 1993. He died yesterday of colon cancer. He\n\nwas 69.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)"
