        "text": "Biography of Saul Bellow\n\nSaul Bellow was born on June 10, 1915, in Lachine, Quebec, Canada. He lived with his parents who had immigrated to Canada from St. Petersburg. He had one older sister and two older brothers. Bellow was often sick as a child, struggling with respiratory problems. Bellow moved with his family to Chicago when he was 9 years old. Chicago would later greatly influence many of the settings in his novels.\n\nBellow's family was religious, but Bellow found it suffocating. However, he did enjoy reading the Torah, a Jewish religious text. It was during this period that he began to write. Bellow was influenced by Russian literature, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), and Shakespeare.\n\nWhile attending the University of Chicago and later Northwestern University, Bellows studied anthropology and sociology after he felt unwelcome by the literature department due to his religion. However, Bellow's anthropological background helped inform many of his later works. Bellow began working at the Works Progress Administration Chicago Branch in the 1930s and became involved with the Trotskyists.\n\nAfter becoming a naturalized citizen in 1941, Bellow joined the Merchant Marines during the Second World War. It was during this time he completed his first novel inspired by the war draft called Dangling Man (1944). After the war, while teaching at the University of Minnesota, Bellows wrote another novel The Victim (1947). After receiving a Guggenheim fellowship in 1948, Bellows went to Paris and wrote The Adventures of Augie March (1953) which solidified his position as a recognized author. He returned to Minnesota in 1958.\n\nIn 1961, he moved to Rio Piedra, Puerto Rico to teach at the University of Puerto Rico. By 1962, he was back in Chicago to teach at the University of Chicago. He taught on the Committee on Social Thought alongside his close friend Allan Bloom, an American philosopher and classicist. In 1964, Bellow wrote his first bestseller, Herzog (1964) which was focused on mental instability in a college professor. Mental instability would become a central theme in many of his novels.\n\nIn 1976, Bellow won the Nobel Prize in literature for his novel Humboldt's Gift (1976). Bellow also was selected for the Jefferson Lecture, the highest honor for achievement in the humanities granted by the United States. Between 1981 and 1982, Bellows was the Writer-in-Residence at the University of Victoria. In 1993, Bellow moved to Boston to co-teach at Boston University. He lived there until he died in 2005 at the age of 89."
