        "text": "Shruti Haasan (born 28 January 1986) is an Indian actress and singer who works in Telugu, Hindi and Tamil films. She is the recipient of various accolades, including two Filmfare Award South and six South Indian International Movie Awards. Haasan has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list of 2015 and 2016.\n\nBorn to actor-filmmaker Kamal Haasan and actress Sarika Thakur, she worked briefly as a child artist. She made her acting debut as an adult with the Hindi film Luck (2009). She made her Telugu debut with Anaganaga O Dheerudu and Tamil debut with 7aum Arivu both (2011), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut – South for both. Haasan established herself in South Indian cinema with the Telugu films Oh My Friend (2011), Gabbar Singh (2012), Balupu (2013), Yevadu, Race Gurram both (2014), Srimanthudu (2015), Premam (2016), Krack (2021) and Waltair Veerayya (2023). She won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for Race Gurram.\n\nHaasan has also played the leading lady in the Tamil films, Vedalam (2015) and Si3 (2017), and the Hindi films Gabbar Is Back and Welcome Back (both 2015) . For her performance in D-Day (2013), she received a nomination for the IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her highest-grossing release came with the Telugu film Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023).\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Haasan is also an established playback singer and has her own music band. She is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nShruti Haasan was born to actors Kamal Haasan and Sarika Thakur in Madras (present-day Chennai) in a Tamil family. Her father is a Tamilian Brahmin Iyengar, while her mother Sarika was born to a Maharashtrian father and Rajput mother. Her younger sister Akshara Haasan is also an actress. Actor and lawyer Charuhasan is her uncle. Her cousins are actresses Anu Hasan and Suhasini Maniratnam. She is dating Shantanu Hazarika. Haasan studied at Lady Andal school in Chennai and moved to Mumbai to study psychology at St. Andrew's College.\n\nHaasan focused on cinema and music, and eventually traveled to the US to continue to learn music at the Musicians Institute in California, before returning to Chennai.\n\nActing career\n\nDebut and early career (2000; 2009–2011)\n\nHaasan's first appearance in a feature film was as a child artist in a cameo role as the daughter of Vallabhbhai Patel in the Tamil-Hindi bilingual Hey Ram, based on a murder attempt on Mahatma Gandhi, directed by her father Kamal Haasan. After rejecting prominent film offers, most notably the lead role in Venkat Prabhu's Saroja, reports suggested in late 2007 that Haasan was set to make her actual acting debut in 2008 with a film opposite Madhavan, directed by Nishikant Kamat. Entitled Endrendrum Punnagai, the film was stalled before production began.\n\nHaasan eventually signed up to feature in Soham Shah's Hindi film Luck, opposite Imran Khan, in July 2008, and shot for the film for nearly a year. Khan, her childhood friend, had recommended her name to the director and Haasan signed on after listening to the entire script and accepted to play a dual role in the action film. She took part in action scenes during filming and worked out extensively. The film opened in July 2009 to unanimously poor reviews from critics and took a poor opening at the box office, with critics stating that she \"deserved a better launch vehicle\". Reviewers were critical of her performance, with Rajeev Masand of IBN stating that she delivers \"dialogues with deadpan expressions\", while another critic added that she is perhaps \"synthetic and fails to impress\". Haasan then went on to appear alongside Blaaze in the promotional videos for Unnaipol Oruvan and Eenadu, the bilingual films starring her father, which she had composed the music for. She made a further appearance in a promotional video for the horror film Hisss, starring Mallika Sherawat, where she had also sung a song composed by Dave Kushner.\n\nHaasan made her Telugu debut in January 2011, acting opposite Siddharth in the fantasy adventure film Anaganaga O Dheerudu, directed by Prakash Kovelamudi, son of director K. Raghavendra Rao. The film, co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, saw her play a gypsy with magic healing powers defended by a swordsman, played by Siddharth. The film opened to positive reviews, with her performance being praised, with a critic of Sify noting: \"Shruti looks quite attractive and makes a wonderful screen presence\", while a reviewer from Rediff.com wrote that she \"looks beautiful and has a mystical aura about her\".\n\nHer second Hindi feature film, Madhur Bhandarkar's romantic comedy Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji, saw her appear in an extended guest appearance alongside Emraan Hashmi. The film portrayed her as Nikki Narang, the step-daughter of an ex Miss India model, with Hashmi's character falling for both mother and daughter. Her performance gained poor responses from critics, with a reviewer citing that her character has been \"reduced to post-interval surfacing, last-ditch glamour\", while another labelled hers as \"so fake that she offers only disappointment\"; however, the film went on to become a commercial success at the box office.\n\nIn mid-2010, Haasan was signed by AR Murugadoss to star opposite Suriya in his next film 7aum Arivu, and the film's shooting began in June later that year. The director signed after he felt she looked the part of the scientist, mentioning that she seemed \"intelligent and beautiful\". She played Subha Srinivasan, a young scientist in the film, who hopes to re-activate the genes of 5th century Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, and her performance in the film won appreciation from critics. The film opened to mixed reviews, but became commercially successful. Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu noted: \"rarely is a heroine given near-equal footing in Tamil films\", describing her as \"ravishing but that she ought to work harder on spontaneity, and fine-tune her Tamil accent\", but concluded \"the point is the actor shows promise\". Her next Telugu release was Oh My Friend, a romantic comedy film alongside Siddharth again, which also co-starred Hansika Motwani and Navdeep. The film told the story of childhood friends, and that of their platonic friendship that went on in their adulthood as well, and for the role Shruti Haasan went on to learn the dance of Kuchipudi. The film opened to average reviews, with several critics claiming the film evoked a sense of \"déjà vu\", though B. V. S. Prakash of Deccan Chronicle noted: \"Shruti, on her part displays the same conviction.\"\n\nBreakthrough (2012–2013)\n\nAishwarya Rajinikanth's Tamil directorial debut 3, a romantic drama film co-starring Dhanush, marked a turning point in Haasan's career. Aishwarya revealed that she had written the script with Shruti in mind, but date problems meant that the film began its shoot with Amala Paul instead. However, in a turn of events, Shruti was re-signed to play the character of Janani, and the film gained much hype prior to release due to the collaboration of herself and Aishwarya, being the daughters of the two leading contemporary Tamil actors Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth, respectively, as did the success of the song \"Why This Kolaveri Di?\". The film opened in March 2012 to positive reviews, with Vishnupriya Bhandaram of The Hindu noting: \"Shruti Hassan has come a long way\", while L Romal M Singh of DNA India stated that the first half of the film belongs to her. The film only garnered average returns at the box office. Her second release in 2012 was Harish Shankar's Telugu film Gabbar Singh, a remake of the 2010 Hindi film Dabangg, featuring her opposite Pawan Kalyan. She played the role of Bhagyalakshmi, a village girl. The film went on to become a major commercial success at the box office and brought in more film offers for Haasan. Critics gave her performance a favourable verdict citing that she \"justifies her role\" and \"though she didn't have much of a role, she has left her mark.\"\n\nWith four releases in 2013, Haasan first appeared in the Telugu film Balupu opposite, Ravi Teja, which eventually became a \"super-hit\", at the box office. She received positive reviews for her performance, with a critic of Idlebrain stating that she \"provides the fun in the film with glamor and verve\". Later that year, she starred in two Hindi films, Prabhu Deva's Ramaiya Vastavaiya and Nikkhil Advani's D-Day. For the former, she played a Punjabi girl Sona alongside Girish Kumar. ..... She also sang a song for the film, entitled \"Alvida\". Reviewing the film for Rediff.com, Palomi Sharma found Haasan to be \"perfect as a Karachi ... with a haunting aura about her\". In her final release that year, Haasan played a social worker Ammulu, opposite Jr. NTR, in Telugu film Ramayya Vasthavayya. The film received an average response from critics.\n\nCommercial success and acclaim (2014–2019)\n\nHaasan's first release of 2014, the Telugu film Yevadu, opposite Ram Charan, emerged as a major commercial success. She played a college student Manju in the film.

Haasan won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for the film. She also had a Tamil release; Poojai, opposite Vishal, for which she also did costume designing and performed her first item number, in the Telugu film Aagadu, starring Mahesh Babu and Tamannaah.\n\nIn 2015, Haasan performed her second item number in the Hindi film Tevar, featuring Arjun Kapoor and Sonakshi Sinha.

A critic of The Hindu opined, \"Shruti seems to be getting better with each film and does her part with grace and earnestness, managing to hold her own in a film that worships the hero.\"\n\nHassan then appeared in Anees Bazmee's Hindi film Welcome Back, opposite John Abraham, playing Ranjana. Bollywood Hungama felt she played her part \"decently\". She next appeared in two Tamil films. Haasan played Pavazhamalli in Puli, co-starring Vijay, which was a box office success. A critic of HuffPost felt Haasan \"overshadowed\" Vijay, with her \"just competent presence\". In Vedalam, opposite Ajith Kumar, she played a lawyer, Shwetha. The film emerged as a commercial success. Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express noted, \"Shruti is adequate in the limited space given to her, but her character is sidelined when the sibling bonding makes its play.\"\n\nIn her first film of 2016, Haasan appeared in Rocky Handsome, opposite John Abraham for the second time. Renuka Vyavahare stated, \"Shruti Haasan looks pretty in her special appearance, adding life to the lovely song Rehnuma.\" Haasan then played a Marathi-Tamil lecturer Sithara, in the Telugu film Premam, opposite Naga Chaitanya, a remake of the Malayalam film of the same name.
