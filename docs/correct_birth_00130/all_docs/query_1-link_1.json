        "text": "Background\n\nKamal Hassan, born November 7, 1954, is a man of many talents. He is truly a jack of all trades and a master of all. He received the President’s Gold medal for the Tamil film “Kalathur Kannamma,” in which he debuted as a child artist. From then on, he continued to act and starred in five more films as a child. His father was very supportive and encouraged his son to join a theater company, T. K. S. Nataka Sabha. Here, his craft was shaped, and his interest in makeup also grew. Haasan took a seven-year hiatus from films and returned as a dance assistant. But, he still made the occasional film appearance, including some uncredited roles. He continued to play supporting roles or work as an assistant director until he landed his first lead part in the Malayalam film, “Kanyakumari,” for which he won his first Filmfare Award. His breakthrough in Tamil film came through in his role in “Apoorva Raagangal,” where he played a rebellious young man who fell in love with an older woman and bagged another Filmfare Award for the movie. By the end of the 1970s, he received six regional Best Actor Filmfare Awards, including four consecutive Best Tamil Actor Awards, thanks to a prodigious stream of films that brought him further accolades.\n\nIn addition to acting, Haasan is known for his offscreen contributions to the film industry. He has choreographed dance for various movies, written and directed, and produced films under his production company Raaj Kamal Films International. He has also trained as a makeup artist under Michael Westmore. Not content with sticking to one industry, Haasan also dabbles in publishing and writing. He formed a political party: Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), a regional political party in Tamil Nadu, on February 21, 2018.\n\nToday, Hassan has a record of 19 Filmfare Awards in five languages. Post his last award in 2000, he wrote to the film organization and requested that they give away awards to newer talents. He has received India’s highest honors, like the Kalaimamani in 1984, Padma Shri in 1990, and the Padma Bhushan in 2014. He has been married twice and has two daughters with his second wife. His eldest daughter is also in the movies."
