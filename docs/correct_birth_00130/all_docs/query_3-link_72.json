        "text": "India’s billionaire count just went up by one. The founder and CEO of a popular food delivery company has joined the ranks of the country’s richest individuals, with a staggering net worth of over Rs 8,300 Crore. What’s more — the surge in his personal capital has also made him India’s wealthiest professional manager. Fun fact: He was also featured as one of the judges of Shark Tank season three, a series that is greatly consumed by all audiences. Here’s everything you need to know.\n\nMeet India's newest billionaire, who left an MNC to start a food delivery platform, runs a Rs 1.9 lakh Crore company, has cars worth over Rs 16 Crore and a staggering net worth of over Rs 8,300 Crore\n\nFounder and CEO of Zomato\n\nDeepinder Goyal, who co-founded Zomato, one of India’s most popular food delivery services, and currently serves as its founder and CEO has become a billionaire after a record rally in the company’s shares — the stock has jumped over 300 per cent since the low of July 2023. With this, it has set a new record of Rs 230 on the BSE and gained approximately 2 per cent during the day, with its market cap surging past Rs 1.8 trillion, MoneyControl reports. As a result, Goyal, who has 36.95 crore shares (that is 4.24 per cent stake in the company), has become India’s richest professional manager and the country’s newest billionaire, with his net worth surging past Rs 8,300 crore.\n\nOne of the main causes for the Zomato share boom, according to a Goldman Sachs report, is the rapid growth of Blinkit, which the former acquired for $570 million (Rs 4,763 crore) in 2022. The report claims that Blinkit's indicated value has outdone even that of Zomato's core food delivery business, with Blinkit currently valued at $13 billion (Rs 1 lakh crore).\n\nThe idea for ‘Foodiebay’, later renamed ‘Zomato’\n\nGoyal was born on 26 January 1983 in Muktsar, Punjab. After completing his schooling at DAV College, Chandigarh, he enrolled in IIT Delhi for Mathematics and Computing. After graduation, Goyal secured a job as a Senior Associate Consultant at Baine and Company, as did Pankaj Chaddah, with whom he would later co-found Zomato.\n\nThe idea for streamlining the meal delivery system was derived from Goyal’s passion for food. In 2008, Goyal and Chaddah decided to take the plunge, and while still at Baine and Company, they founded FoodieBay.com. Within nine months, Foodiebay became the largest restaurant directory in Delhi-NCR, and two months post that, it began receiving funding from investors including Info Edge India, Sequoia, Vy Capital, Temasek, a Singaporean investment firm, and Ant Financial of Alibaba, Deccan Chronicle reports. The game-changing moment for the company, by then renamed to ‘Zomato’, came with a $200 million investment from Ant Financial, which led it to achieve its unicorn status in the 2018–19 fiscal year. However, Chaddha left the company that same year.\n\nShark Tank judge"
