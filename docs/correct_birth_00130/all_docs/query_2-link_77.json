        "text": "Family\n\nHaasan was born into a Tamil Iyengar family in the town of Paramakudi, in the Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu, to criminal defence lawyer D. Srinivasan and Rajalakshmi, a housewife. During 2013 his daughter Shruti Haasan appeared on an episode of Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi, where \"phone a friend\" option is availed to Shruti and when she called her father Kamal, he stated that his parents named him Parthasarathy before he was called as Kamal Haasan and his mother always used to call him by that name. In an interview with Karan Thapar, Haasan said his father was literate in Sanskrit. Haasan was the youngest of four children; his siblings are Charuhasan, Chandrahasan and Nalini (Raghu). His two older brothers followed their father's example and studied law. Haasan continued his education in Sir M.Ct. Muthiah Chettiar Boys Higher Secondary School and Hindu Higher Secondary School in Madras (now Chennai).\n\nRelationships\n\nIn 1978, at age 24, Haasan married dancer Vani Ganapathy. She acted with Haasan in the 1975 movie Melnaattu Marumagal. After marriage, Vani worked as Haasan's costume designer for several movies. They divorced ten years later.[citation needed]\n\nHaasan and actress Sarika began living together in 1988, marrying after the birth of their first child, Shruti (born 1986). Shruti is a singer and a Tollywood-Kollywood actress. Their younger daughter, Akshara (born 1991), was assistant director for 2013's Vishwaroopam and actress for 2019's Kadaram Kondan. Sarika stopped acting soon after their marriage, Sarika worked as Haasan's costume designer for the movie Hey Ram and won the National Film Award for Best Costume Designer. In 2002, the couple filed for divorce, which became final in 2004. After their divorce, Sarika acted in movies and TV serials, winning the National Film Award for Best Actress for the 2005 film Parzania.[citation needed]\n\nFrom 2005 until 2016, Haasan was in a relationship with actress Gautami,[citation needed], his frequent co-star during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gautami had announced on her blog that she had ended her relationship with him writing, \"It is heartbreaking for me to have to say today that I and Mr. Haasan are no longer together. After almost 13 years together, it has been one of the most devastating decisions that I have ever had to make in my life.\"\n\nEarly in his career, he co-starred in several films with Srividya. Haasan visited Srividya on her deathbed in 2006.\n\nPolitical career\n\nThevar Community Controversy\n\nOne of his early films Thevar Magan, which won five national prizes, including best film in Tamil, drew harsh criticism for associating the Thevar minority of Tamil Nadu with violence.\n\nHey Raam Controversy\n\nKamal Haasan wrote, directed, and produced a film called Hey Ram that won three national honours and was nominated for an Oscar. This bilingual film is based on Nathuram Godse's murder of Mahatma Gandhi. Because Gandhi was portrayed negatively in this film, there was a significant uproar among various left-leaning political parties.\n\nVishwaroopam Controversy\n\nVishwaroopam, an Indian movie released in 2013, faced a number of contentious problems. The Hindu Makkal Katchi party wanted a change from its existing Sanskrit title to a solely Tamil one in the first case of this nature. Theatre owners urged a retraction of this arrangement when Kamal Haasan announced a direct-to-home (DTH) release of the movie out of concern for significant revenue losses to DTH operators. Haasan consented to let the movie premiere in theatres first after threatening a complete theatre boycott of Vishwaroopam.\n\nLater, Muslim organisations in Tamil Nadu urged that the movie be stopped, claiming that it would offend Muslim sensibilities. Despite Tamil Nadu district collectors ordering theatre owners not to screen Vishwaroopam despite the film's approval by the Central Board of Film Certification of India, which cited law and order issues, the movie was released in neighbouring states with higher Muslim populations than Tamil Nadu. The ban in Tamil Nadu caused screenings in nearby Indian states as well as a few international markets to cease.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Jayalalitha, was accused of having political and commercial interests, which the Indian film industry denies, and her actions were criticised as a direct attack on freedom of speech in India. Kamal Haasan claimed that after repeated pressure to remove the supposedly controversial parts from the movie, he may be compelled to leave Tamil Nadu and India because he was \"tired of being pushed within a dirty political game.\"\n\nNathuram Godse Controversy\n\nAt a political rally in Aravakurichi, Tamil Nadu, Kamal Haasan said something controversial about the country's first terrorist. The Vishwaroopam actor claimed that Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi, was the first terrorist of independent India. As a good Indian who values equality, Kamal Haasan further stated that he would \"want the three colours in the tricolour to remain intact.\"\n\nPlebiscite in Kashmir\n\nThe actor became embroiled in controversy in February 2018 after he questioned why India was reluctant to conduct a referendum in Kashmir. This declaration was made following a treacherous attack in Pulwama by the Jaish-e-Mohammed that resulted in the deaths of 40 members of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). No soldier would perish, according to Kamal, if Indian and Pakistani politicians acted decently. He said, \"The Line of Control will be in control.\" He soon came under fire from a number of lawmakers and civilians, which forced him to retract his statement. His party, Makkal Needhi Maiyam, said in a news release that his remarks had been exaggerated.\n\nPoonool Controversy\n\nDuring a Q&A session on Twitter in July 2018, Kamal Haasan responded to a number of queries from his followers. Which books, or \"nool\" in Tamil, have had a significant influence on his life, one of his followers inquired. The performer remarked, \"I steered clear of one thread. I was greatly impacted by the thread, Poonool. I stayed away because of that.\" He drew harsh criticism for his remarks from the Brahmin community, who wear the sacred thread.\n\nDid You Know?"
