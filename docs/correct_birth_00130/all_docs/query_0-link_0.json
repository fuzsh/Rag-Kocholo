The film was a commercial success and was dubbed in Hindi as Mirch Masala, which was never released.[43]\n\n2000–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus from Indian cinema, Haasan decided against reviving Marudhanayagam. He directed his second film, Hey Ram,[44] a period drama, told in flashback, with a fact-based plot centering on the partition of India and the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Haasan produced and choreographed the film, writing its screenplay and lyrics; it was India's submission for the Academy Awards that year.[45] Hey Ram was a box-office failure in India but was successful worldwide. Also in 2000, Haasan appeared in the comedy Thenali as a Sri Lankan Tamilian with PTSD who is under a psychiatrist's care. Thenali, starring Malayalam actor Jayaram, was a box-office success. Haasan's next film was 2001's Aalavandhan, in which he played two roles: For one he had his head shaved and gained ten kilograms. To play the other Army major in Aalavandhan, he went to the NDA for a crash course.[46] The Hindi version was distributed by Shringar Films.[47][48] Despite pre-release publicity, the film was a commercial failure.[49]\n\nAfter a number of successful comedies[50] including Pammal K. Sambandam and Panchatanthiram and guest appearances, Haasan directed Virumaandi, a film about capital punishment which won the Best Asian Film Award at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival.[51] He also appeared in Anbe Sivam with Madhavan. Priyadarshan, its original director, left and Sundar C. completed the film. Anbe Sivam tells the story of Nallasivam, portrayed by Haasan as a communist. His performance was praised by critics, with The Hindu saying that he \"has once again done Tamil cinema proud\".[52]\n\nIn 2004 Haasan appeared in Vasool Raja MBBS, a remake of Bollywood's Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., with Sneha which was a box-office success. The following year, he wrote and starred in the comedy Mumbai Xpress. Released during Tamil New Year, it was a disappointment at the box office despite positive reviews. He appeared Kannada comedy film Rama Shama Bhama with Ramesh Aravind. In 2006 Haasan's long-delayed project, the stylish police story Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, was a success. Directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, the film is about a police officer sent to the US to investigate a series of medical murders. In 2008's Dasavathaaram, he played ten roles; the film was released in a number of languages (including Tamil, Telugu and Hindi) throughout India and overseas. Dasavathaaram, written by Haasan and director K. S. Ravikumar, is one of the first modern science-fiction films made in India. Starring Haasan and Asin Thottumkal, it was the highest-grossing Tamil film (as of 2008 ) and his performance was critically praised.[53] In Canada, Dasavathaaram was the first Tamil film distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.[54]\n\nAfter Dasavathaaram, Haasan directed a film tentatively titled Marmayogi, which stalled after a year of pre-production. He then produced and starred in Unnaipol Oruvan, a remake of the Bollywood film A Wednesday, where he reprised the role originally played by Naseeruddin Shah with Malayalam actor Mohanlal playing Anupam Kher's role.[55][56] It was released in Telugu as Eeenadu, with Venkatesh reprising the role played by Kher.[57] Both versions were critically acclaimed and commercially successful.[57][58]\n\n2010–present\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Controversial issues surrounding Vishwaroopam\n\nHaasan collaborated for the fifth time with Ravikumar in Manmadan Ambu, for which he also wrote the screenplay. The story concerns a man who hires a detective to find out if his fiancée is cheating on him.[59] The film was released in December 2010 to mixed reviews, with Behindwoods calling it \"an entertainer, but in parts\"[60] and Sify saying it \"lacks the punch to captivate the audiences\".[61]\n\nHaasan's next film after Manmadhan Ambu was 2013's Vishwaroopam, released in Hindi as Vishwaroop. It won two National Film Awards (Best Production Design and Best Choreography) at the 60th National Film Awards.[62] Muslim groups in Tamil Nadu demanded the ban of the film and claimed, that the film would hurt Muslim sentiments.[63][64] Although the film was cleared by Central Board of Film Certification of India, district collectors in the state of Tamil Nadu gave orders to the theatre owners to not show Vishwaroopam, citing law and order problems. However, the film was released in other states with greater Muslim populations than in Tamil Nadu. A mutual agreement with the Muslims of Tamil Nadu was finally settled on 2 February 2013, when Haasan accepted to mute five scenes. Vishwaroopam was the 2nd highest-grossing Tamil film of 2013.[65]\n\nIn May 2014, he was appointed as the official Indian delegate to the 67th Cannes Film Festival.[66] As of July 2014, he was working on three films: Uttama Villain, Vishwaroopam II, the sequel of Vishwaroopam[67] and Papanasam.[68] After 2 years of Vishwaroopam's release, Uttama Villain was released on 2 May 2015 with exceptional critical reviews and on 3 July 2015, Papanasam a Tamil remake of Malayalam film Drishyam[69] was released with positive reviews and became a huge success[70] followed by the bi-lingual Thoongaa Vanam and Cheekati Rajyam,[71] both doing moderate business.\n\nHe was set to reprise his role of Balram Naidu (a Telugu RAW Officer) from Dasavathaaram in a spin-off film directed by himself titled Sabaash Naidu. The film was to be made in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi (as Shabhash Kundu). The film's release date has been delayed owing to Haasan's entry into politics, and he pledged that he focus on working on Indian 2 instead.[72]\n\nOn 17 September 2020, director Lokesh Kanagaraj announced through his Twitter handle that his next venture will have Kamal Haasan in lead role with Anirudh handling the music with the movie titled as Vikram. It was Kamal Hassan's 232nd film as an actor.[73] The film was released on 3 June 2022 and was a huge commercial success grossing ₹423.8 crore (US$51 million) and went on to become the 2nd highest-grossing Tamil film of the year and third highest-grossing Tamil film of all time by beating the collections made by other Tamil films like Beast, Valimai, Etharkkum Thunindhavan and Don etc.[74] The first single of Vikram titled \"Pathala Pathala\" received several million views from Kamal Haasan's fans and was the most viewed song on YouTube.[75] The song also received praise for Kamal Haasan's dance performances which went viral. Despite facing controversies from the song, it became an instant hit.[76] In August 2022, the filming for Indian 2 resumed, after a break of almost a year. It is now scheduled for release in summer 2024.\n\nIn June 2023, he was cast in Kalki 2898 AD as the antagonist, marking his comeback in Telugu cinema. It was the first film in Indian cinema to attend the San Diego Comic-Con, in July 2023. Along with the director and producers of the film, Nag Ashwin, C. Aswani Dutt, and Swapna Dutt, he presented the panel of the film with Prabhas and Rana Daggubati. In October 2023, he gave a voice-over for his character in Leo, the third entry in the Lokiverse.[77] After Indian 2, he will be collaborating with H. Vinoth, for his 233rd film.[78][79][80]\n\nHe has also announced his reunion with Mani Ratnam for his 234th film, entitled Thug Life, which is currently in production.\n\nOff-screen contributions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to acting, Haasan is noted for his involvement in other aspects of filmmaking.[38] He has written many of his films, including Raja Paarvai, Apoorva Sagodharargal, Michael Madana Kama Rajan, Thevar Magan, Mahanadhi, Hey Ram, Aalavandhan, Anbe Sivam, Nala Damayanthi, Virumaandi, Dasavathaaram, Manmadan Ambu and Vishwaroopam. Haasan's production company (Raaj Kamal Films International) has produced several of his films, and he directed Chachi 420, Hey Ram, Virumaandi and Vishwaroopam. He considered directing full-time if Hey Ram was successful, but changed his mind when the film failed at the box office.[81] In his earlier career, he choreographed for MGR in Naan Yen Pirandhen, Sivaji Ganesan in Savaale Samaali and Jayalalithaa in Anbu Thangai[82] In 2010 Haasan said he wanted to do more directing, since young actors wished to work for him.

His two older brothers followed their father's example and studied law.[113] Haasan continued his education in Sir M.Ct.

In 1994, Haasan became the first Indian actor to charge 15 million per film.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2015, Haasan was criticised by the-then Tamil Nadu Finance Minister O.
