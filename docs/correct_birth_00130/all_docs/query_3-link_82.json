        "text": "Rising from rags to riches is nothing new for cricketers. Sadly though, life is unpredictable and fortunes can turn in a flash. Cricket players that had everything have lost it all out of the blue and ended up bankrupt. Basically, from riches they have fallen to rags.\n\nIt is not a new experience, nor is it something that is isolated. Several cricket players have gone through it and it is like a real life nightmare.\n\nSo who are those unfortunate souls who once had lots of money in their accounts and then had to struggle to make ends meet? These are names you have all heard of and even seen play. It is a pity that they have been reduced to this pathetic state.\n\nHere’s a look at players that completely lost everything:\n\n1. Vinod Kambli\n\nKambli is completely dependent on the Rs. 30,000 monthly pension money from the BCCI. He needs a job to make ends meet. Once India’s rising star, the man fell down hard from his pedestal.\n\n2. Adam Hollioake\n\nDue to the recession in 2008, Adam’s businesses were hit hard and he did not have enough money to pay off pending loans.\n\n3. Mathew Sinclair\n\nHe stopped playing cricket in 2013. After that, he struggled to find a job because he did not have enough qualifications to ply his trade elsewhere. A sad state of affairs indeed.\n\n4. Chris Cairns\n\nAfter 2013, Cairns went bankrupt. He was seen cleaning toilets and buses in order to survive and combat his health issues.\n\n5. Craig McDermott\n\nMcDermott was a victim of recession in 2008. He had to pay his investors 40 million Australian dollars and had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. The man who helped Australia win their first World Cup was no longer self dependent."
