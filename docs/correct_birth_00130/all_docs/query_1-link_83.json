Facing an extraordinary push by his friends and allies to end his political career, Biden has responded with defiance. For three weeks, he has dug in, denied polling evidence and vowed to stay in the race, claiming that he is the only one who can defeat former President Donald Trump. Only in the last few days have people close to him said they believe he is more receptive to\n\nThe New York Times\n\nThanks, but No Thanks\n\nCheck, Please Q: My first week at my job, the CEO took me out to lunch. He informed me that he takes one employee out to lunch every week on a rotating basis to discuss his or her position and give feedback on how things could run more smoothly. I found our first lunch to be very uncomfortable and began to dread the next one. My position is mostly answering phone calls, so work-related issues are resolved in much less time than the hour and 30 minutes allotted for the lunches. This means that th\n\nReuters\n\nWith Kamala Harris, Democrats would bet against US history of sexism, racism\n\nThe Democratic party will be taking a historic gamble if it turns to Vice President Kamala Harris to become its presidential candidate, betting that a Black woman can overcome racism, sexism and her own missteps as a politician to defeat Republican Donald Trump. In more than two centuries of democracy, American voters have elected only one Black president and never a woman, a record that makes even some Black voters wonder if Harris can crash through the hardest ceiling in U.S. politics. Harris would face other big challenges: if promoted to the top of the ticket, she would have barely three months to campaign and unite the party and donors behind her.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nA Lebanese photojournalist, wounded in Israeli strike, carries Olympic torch to honor journalists\n\nA Lebanese photojournalist who was severely wounded during an Israeli strike on south Lebanon carried Sunday the Olympic torch in Paris to honor journalists wounded and killed in the field. The torch relay, which started in May, is part of celebrations in which about 10,000 people from various walks of life were chosen to carry the flame across France before the Games opening ceremony on July 26. Christina Assi, of Agence France-Presse, was among six journalists struck by Israeli shelling on Oct. 13 2023 while reporting on fire exchange along the border between Israeli troops and members of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group.\n\nCNN\n\n‘I’m just sick of it’: More than a week without power leaves some Houston-area residents feeling hopeless and abandoned\n\nFor more than a week, some residents of the nation’s fourth largest city were left to sleep in their cars, shuffle perilously with canes and walkers across dark rooms and corridors, and watch food and medications spoil and critical medical equipment become inoperable.\n\nReuters\n\nFighting rages in southern Gaza, Israeli strikes hit central areas\n\nIsraeli forces battled Palestinian fighters in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on Sunday, and struck areas in the centre of the coastal enclave where thousands of Palestinians displaced from their homes have been seeking shelter. Residents in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, said fierce battles raged between Hamas-led fighters and Israeli forces, especially in the centre and in western areas where tanks advanced in the previous two days. The armed wings of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas Islamist militant groups said fighters confronted Israeli forces with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs.\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat turned independent, urges Biden to withdraw from the 2024 race\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat turned independent, urged President Joe Biden on Sunday to drop his reelection bid and focus on the remaining months of his presidency. Nearly three dozen Democrats in Congress have said it's time for Biden to leave the race. Four Democratic senators — Peter Welch of Vermont, Jon Tester of Montana, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Sherrod Brown of Ohio — have said the Democratic president should abandon his reelection campaign against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nSecret Service Says It Denied Earlier Trump Requests for More Federal Resources\n\nThe Secret Service acknowledged Saturday that it had turned down requests of additional resources sought by former President Donald Trump’s security detail in the two years leading up to his attempted assassination last week, a reversal from earlier statements by the agency denying that such requests had been rebuffed. Almost immediately after a gunman shot at Trump from a nearby warehouse roof while he spoke at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last weekend, the Secret Service faced accusations\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNepal’s new prime minister seeks vote of confidence in parliament, secure more than two-third votes\n\nNepal’s newly appointed prime minister secured overwhelming support in parliament on Sunday with more than two-thirds of members voting in his favor.
