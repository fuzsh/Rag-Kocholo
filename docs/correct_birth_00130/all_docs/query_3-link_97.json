        "text": "Tamil star Kamal Haasan is reprising his role as Senapathy in the upcoming movie Indian 2. It has been 28 years since the first movie in the franchise came out and his fans are excited to watch him in the savage and action role again. As the movie is set to hit the theaters in a few hours, its advance booking has already blown minds.\n\nFor the unversed, Senapathy is a freedom fighter who was born in 1918. Even after India became a free country, he continued to fight for his people. In the 1996 movie, he went on a killing spree and murdered several corrupt officials. The movie ended with Senapathy killing his son and announcing that he will be back when it is needed. Now, the movie features his return as corruption in the country increases.\n\nHow much did Kamal Haasan’s Indian 2 earn in advance booking?\n\nAccording to a report by Sacnilk, Kamal Haasan’s Indian 2 has already earned a whopping amount in its advance booking. The movie has so far earned a whopping $1.08 million in advance. It has even sold 513.5k tickets. The publication also confirmed that the movie would earn $1.87 million if its block seats were also included. Despite the massive clash with Akshay Kumar’s Sarfira, the movie is doing seemingly well. These numbers were confirmed at the time of writing and are expected to increase with time.\n\nBesides Kamal Haasan, the movie features a star-studded ensemble. Kajal Aggarwal, Siddharth, Rakul Preet, and others play pivotal roles. Soon after the movie’s trailer was released, fans began discussing Senapathy’s age. They were confused about how a 106-year-old man could fight goons with such power. However, its makers revealed that he is a Varma Kalai master and his body is much younger than his age."
