        "text": "Remember tuning to songs like, “tere mere beech mein ” and “aye Zindagi Gale Laga le”? We definitely need to thank Kamal Haasan for some of his heart warming songs especially on his birthday.\n\nA single person glittering as an actor, dancer, film director, screenwriter, producer, playback singer, lyricist and politician, no doubt KAMAL HAASAN is referred as “Ulaganayagan” meaning “Universal hero”. Even though he is an epitome in acting, his connection with songs and music is equally astonishing. He himself has stated, how being born in a Brahmin household influenced and shaped his musical tastes and choices. His debut song was “Nyayiru Oli Mazhaiyil” in the year 1975.\n\nHe has sung about 108 songs in the languages of Tamil, Hindi, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu. Among them, some of the hit numbers include Kanmani Anbodu, Inji Idupazhagi, Thenpandi Cheemayile, Raja Kaiya Vachchaa, Sundhari Neeyum Sundharan Njanum, Kadavul paathi mirugam paathi. Haasan debuted as a lyricist in Virumaandi featuring the song of “Unna Vida Indha Ulagatthil”. When it comes to lyrics, Neela Vaanam, Saagaavaram, Unnai Kaanadhu Naan are few of his great works. All these are the precious drops in his ocean of oeuvre. His songs don’t only stick to a particular genre but exhibit variance.\n\nThe best part is, teens who listen to regional songs could relate to his songs in any phase of his or her life. When you’re sad, when you’re happy, when you’re celebrating, when you fall in love, when you fall out of love, when you’re hurt, when you’re demotivated, when you’re healing, whatever the situation maybe, his songs can always lead a helping hand.\n\n“Anbe Sivam” is one such classic that evokes peace and brings positivity. He has not only done justice to his connection with music as a lyricist or a singer but as an actor, he has given his whole and soul to express the raw emotion in the songs. That immense attachment has made his songs equally significant to his movies. All of his evergreen songs are going to continue for the generations to come. He is an adept at everything that is thrown at him.\n\n~Manisha Kandaswamy, TYBA"
