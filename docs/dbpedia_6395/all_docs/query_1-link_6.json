Extremely bozo 80s sex scene in this with Sean Young and Kevin Costner, just clowning in the back of a limo as a song called \"No Way Out' plays as they drive by some classic Washington DC sights. There's another scene where Costner eats bugs off a windshield on romantic weekend retreat. Oh and he's also a secret Soviet spy.

He’s Tom Farrell, a Naval Officer who gets hot and heavy in the backseat of a limo with Susan (Sean Young), a would-be Washington socialite. Susan is the mistress of the Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman), and Brice's indecipherable jealousy towards the unknown lover leads to foul play.

Anything for Brice and his chief of staff Pritchard (Will Patton, a sycophant for power) to divert attention away from their guilt. But Farrell knows he is in jeopardy because…\n\n\"You have no idea what men of power can do!\"\n\nNoirvember #15\n\n(Warning: spoilers ahead, including the ending.)\n\nYou know how people like to say that everything old is new again?
