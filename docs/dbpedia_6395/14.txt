For two decades, I've had a passion for film locations and film-related travel. Now I'd like to share this passion and its fruits through this blog. I've amassed vast image archives that still need to be converted into posts, and there are many new findings that are still waiting to be photographed, so please be patient.

While some of these locations have been covered elsewhere, many others represent my own research and appear here for the first time. I hope you'll enjoy the site.
