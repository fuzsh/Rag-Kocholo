When a BPD lady is murdered by her lover, the secretary of defense, only one man can solve the case: another guy who was also fucking her. Extremely bozo 80s sex scene in this with Sean Young and Kevin Costner, just clowning in the back of a limo as a song called "No Way Out' plays as they drive by some classic Washington DC sights. There's another scene where Costner eats bugs off a windshield on romantic weekend retreat. Oh and he's also a secret Soviet spy. You find that out in the last 10 seconds of the movie and it doesn't matter.

Very underrated Kevin Costner thriller. He’s Tom Farrell, a Naval Officer who gets hot and heavy in the backseat of a limo with Susan (Sean Young), a would-be Washington socialite. Susan is the mistress of the Secretary of Defense David Brice (Gene Hackman), and Brice's indecipherable jealousy towards the unknown lover leads to foul play. Suddenly, Farrell is placed in charge of an under wraps investigation that can stay an internal matter as long as the suspect in question is given the false pretenses of being a KGB sleeper agent. Anything for Brice and his chief of staff Pritchard (Will Patton, a sycophant for power) to divert attention away from their guilt. But Farrell knows he is in jeopardy because…

"You have no idea what men of power can do!"

The next time you need to visualize someone living their best life, just look at this picture of the eldest son from The Brady Bunch…
