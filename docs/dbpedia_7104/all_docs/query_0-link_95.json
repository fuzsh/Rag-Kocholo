        "text": "Do you prefer pork chops or bacon?\n\nWhen George Harrison wrote ‘Piggies’ in 1966, he was in a cynical mood. His writing at the time focused on social issues and what he perceived to be injustice, consumerism and greed in society. With this theme in mind he wrote ‘Taxman’ and ‘Piggies’. As we all know ‘Taxman’ made it to the ‘Revolver’ album, but ‘Piggies’ was shelved until a couple of years later when The Beatles were looking for content to complete the ‘White Album’.\n\nAccording to George Harrison in his memoir ‘I, Me, Mine’, ‘Piggies’ was written as a satirical commentary that borrowed heavily from George Orwell’s 1945 novel, ‘Animal Farm’. This connection was concisely noted in an observation by musicologist Walter Everett when he observed Harrison’s gravitation to the Orwellian “fable of autocracy masquerading as democracy”.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nHere are the clever lyrics that George Harrison found in the attic of his childhood home in Liverpool, while visiting in the early part of 1968.\n\nHave you seen the little piggies\n\nCrawling in the dirt?\n\nAnd for all the little piggies\n\nLife is getting worse\n\nAlways having dirt to play around in\n\nHave you seen the bigger piggies\n\nIn their starched white shirts?\n\nYou will find the bigger piggies\n\nStirring up the dirt\n\nAlways have clean shirts to play around in\n\nIn their styes with all their backing\n\nThey don’t care what goes on around\n\nIn their eyes there’s something lacking\n\nWhat they need’s a damn good whacking\n\nEverywhere there’s lots of piggies\n\nLiving piggy lives\n\nYou can see them out for dinner\n\nWith their piggy wives\n\nClutching forks and knives to eat their bacon”\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nThe fact that George found this in the attic is noteworthy because it ties into a key contribution by his mother, Louise. While the songwriter was searching for the perfect way to rhyme the line “In their minds there’s something lacking”, Louise responded with,\n\nWhat they need’s a damn good whacking.”\n\nLouise Harrison\n\nWisely, George slotted it in because he knew Mother knows best.\n\nHere is a comment from George.\n\nPiggies’ is a social comment. I was stuck for one line in the middle until my mother came up with the lyric, ‘What they need is a damn good whacking’ which is a nice simple way of saying they need a good hiding. It needed to rhyme with ‘backing,’ ‘lacking,’ and had absolutely nothing to do with American policemen or Californian shagnasties!\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nThe closing senetence in this quote is a reference to interpretations in the United States that George was attempting to criticize the police. The fact that ‘pig’ is a slang term for police lent to this suggestion and it was only exacerbated by the turbulence across the pond around the time of the ‘White Album’s release. More on that in a moment.\n\nA couple of extra notes related to the lyrical composition need to be mentioned. As referenced in the opening line, George initially had the ‘piggies’ dining out on pork chops, but John Lennon suggested that they substitute bacon as their cut of choice. This became the official line.\n\nYou can hear the original ‘pork chops’ version on what became known as the ‘Esher Tapes’. It was later released on the Beatles ‘Anthology 3’.\n\nFurther observations regarding the lyrics of ‘Piggies’ speak to the original final verse that was subsequently edited out.\n\nEverywhere there’s lots of piggies\n\nPlaying piggy pranks\n\nYou can see them on their trotters\n\nDown at the piggy banks\n\nPaying piggy thanks\n\nTo the pig brother”\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nThe Orwellian connection is very apparent in this line, as is the clear contempt for corporate greed and rampant political corruptness. Harrison brought this line back during what would become his final concert in 1992.\n\nThis footage is admittedly poor, but the significance is undeniable on several levels. This concert from the early’90s came during a time when George was enjoying a massive resurgence. This is well documented through accomplishments in his solo career and his association with The Travelling Wilburys. The show in question is actually a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party, in London, England. The transnational party based its platform on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The concert took place at Royal Albert Hall. It was an exclusive event for candidates and supporters of the idealistic organization. It would become George Harrison’s last full concert as a performer. Here was his message.\n\nThe system we have now is obsolete and not fulfilling the needs of the people. Times have changed and we need a new approach.”\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nWith George Harrison, there is a frequent pattern to his words. They tend to remain relevant long after he initially shared his thoughts, not just in his native England, but all over the world. Please enjoy a couple of cover versions of ‘Piggies’ before I share my thoughts on the Ontario political scene as we sit on the precipice of a provincial election, poised to re-elect a PIG of gargantuan proportions.\n\nThe first of three cover versions Ted Tocks will share today is intriguing because it is a pure reflection of the times immediately following the Beatles ‘White Album’ release. This is Theo Bikel, who was a delegate at the 1968 Democratic convention in ‘Chicago’. This folksinger, actor and activist used the opportunity to share Harrison’s words, effectively illustrating the line between George Harrison’s observations and the swirling climate of tension.\n\nThe links to social upheaval only continued when the contents of the ‘White Album’ became inextricably linked to the Manson Family cult.\n\nBikel’s version of ‘Piggies’ appeared on his 1969 album ‘A New Day’.\n\nDo you remember Chumbawamba? Here is Danbert Nobacon of this group and a 1989 recording called ‘Piggies in Revolution 9’. It is a mashup of the two ‘White Album’ pieces from a compilation album called ‘Fuck EMI.\n\nTed Tocks Covers recommendation.\n\nPlease check out the cover of ‘Piggies’, but listen to this whole album. It is really good.\n\nLet’s jump ahead about five years to the early days of Phish. This is a ton of fun from Halloween ’94. A little bit of levity before I go on a bit of a rant.\n\nIn order to lead into this portion of today’s feature, Ted Tocks will use the words of George Harrison to summarize the need for such an expression.\n\nI don’t think there should be politicians. They seem to be the ones who mess everything up. I never understood politics, personally.”\n\nGeorge Harrison\n\nIt has been four years since Ontario elected our very own Donald Trump wannabe. His name is Doug Ford. From here on in I will refer to him as either Doug Fraud, or to continue the theme of today’s feature Boss ‘Hog’.\n\nBefore sharing a litany of atrocities that have taken place during his horrific reign of terror, I will note that, it is a simple series of abominations concisely shared by the Ontario Federal of Labour. Each of these points can easily be verified by numerous sources.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that Boss Hog is a FRAUD. He is an undeniable example of the worst of all negative characteristics that could ever comprise a human being. He embodies each of the seven deadly sins. Much like his Mar-a-Lago mentor, he is an immoral ingrate who has ridden a privileged life to power, employing nonsensical populist rhetoric and spewing it to a gullible throng of supporters who represent about 35% of this province’s electorate.\n\nBoss Hogg is a lifelong bully. He cares for nobody but himself. He channels his desire for power into some form of evangelical delivery that seems very popular among the sheep who eagerly gobble up his uneducated drivel like starving barnyard rats.\n\nIn order to gain power this vile human being took a page out of Lord Farquaad’s playbook and sold himself out to Ontario’s far right religious interests. These morons make perfect bedfellows. Hypocrites at every turn, they have aimed to systematically dismantle the province since 2018, in the name of cronyism and fake religious doctrine. They don’t even attempt to hide their disdain for the general population, people with disabilities, health care workers, teachers, environmentalists, the indigenous community, women’s rights advocates, the LGBTQ2S community and sadly the list goes on.\n\nEver the opportunist, Boss Hog managed to turn COVID-19 into an opportunity to further his agenda to privatize literally everything. Education and healthcare are at the top of his list. The way he exploited front line workers in this space, borders on inhumane. Absolute contempt, with zero apology. Once again, bully tactics, delivered from the pulpit, looking like a deer in the headlights most of the time, because he knew his inferior intellect was no match for the intelligent collection of reporters who had gathered to question his disgusting agenda. Boss Hog’s response was to shut out any questions, or limit the questioning to partisan media outlets. This created the illusion of acceptance that sadly, one third of Ontarians seem to accept as gospel.\n\nClearly, people have very short memories, or more likely my greatest fears have been realized. When it all comes down to it, people; your friends, family and neighbours truly do only care about their own needs and would, alongside a repugnant pig like Doug Fraud and his merry band of marauding henchmen and women, go along with the runaway train of divisive policy that will systematically destroy everything that is good about this province and country. A country that I no longer recognize. A Republican Lite quagmire of hopelessness and despair that promotes leaving vulnerable people behind, without any semblance of hope, all in the name of the almighty dollar.\n\nBoss Hog is an unapologetic con man with zero redeeming qualities.\n\nRead on and understand.\n\nIf you have not already voted, please reconsider any notion that would see you re-elect this fool and his pathetic minion M.P.P.s who seem unwilling and/or unable to express their true responsibility of actually representing their constituents.\n\nIf you don’t, many more people will be left behind.\n\nWe will then continue to reap the shit harvest we have sown.\n\nHere is a summary of his awful four-year record.\n\nWARNING: The list is looooooong.\n\nJune 2018\n\nCANCELLED ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED
