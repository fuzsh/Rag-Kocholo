        "text": "This picture has written on the back, Rose Farm School, 1925. The picture belonged to my Aunt, Gertrude Schmidt, who is in the picture as well as my father, Johann Schmidt. My Aunt has marked them with ink arrows. I am wondering if anyone else can identify other students, that might help with the exact location of this school. My Dads family arrived in Canada as a Mennonite immigrant from Russian , and I believe they attended this school while waiting to be placed on land. Also, my Dads older sister is not in the picture, as she was held back in South Hampton England for aprox 3 weeks, so they were also waiting for her.\n\nThanks for any info you can share with me, as I am trying to trace their movements upon arriving in Canada.\n\nPatricia Schmidt\n\nCastlegar BC\n\nAn additional note received from Merle Harrison, {Meadow Prairie / Barich School 2716},, Rosefarm School 2632 adds that \"Rosefarm School is 4 miles directly south of the town of Herbert,\" and that Henry Penner was one of the students of Rosefarm.\n\nExcelsior RM 166 School District Map includes:\n\nBeaver Flat NW 29 18 12 W3 Bethania SE 15 17 10 W3 Centre Spring NW 17 17 11 W3 Diamond Hill SW 7 17 12 W3 Donellyville SE 8 16 10 W3 Fox Friesen SE 10 19 12 W3 Funk NW 9 19 11 W3 Goethe NW 17 18 10 W3 Highfield NE 32 18 11 Hovdestad SE 24 19 13 W3 Leonard S 8 18 12 W3 Lobethal SE 29 19 10 W3 Los Angeles SE 28 18 10 W3 Main Centre Moscow NW 2 18 12 W3 Notman NW 20 16 11 W2 Reed Valley SW 1 18 10 W3 Rockside SW 31 17 10 W3 Rosefarm Rush Lake Rush Valley Salt Lake SE 27 18 11 W3 Spenst NE 16 17 12 W3 Swan Lake SW 4 18 11 W3 Turnhill NW 30 18 11 W3 Waldeck NE 21 16 12\n\nRosefarm School district is located southwest of Herbert, Saskatchewan.\n\nThe school district straddles RM 165 and RM 166.\n\nHerbert, Saskatchewan is located at South section 18 township 17- range 9-West of the 3rd meridian\n\nLatitude - Longitude : 50º 25' 35'' N, 107º 13' 30'' W OR 50.4264749, -107.2249944\n\nNearby Placenames are:\n\nBurnham Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nFauna Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nFlowing Well Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nGlen Kerr Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nHerbert Saskatchewan Town\n\nMain Centre Saskatchewan Hamlet\n\nOld Main Centre Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nPrairie View Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nRush Lake Saskatchewan Village\n\nTeakle Saskatchewan Unincorporated area\n\nFor more information:\n\nRosefarm School 2632 contemporary images submitted by Merle Harrison\n\nHistory of Rural Municipality of Excelsior No. 166 : 1910-1967\n\nby Lee, Charles\n\nThe Rural Municipality of Excelsior No. 166, Saskatchewan was originally called Waldeck No. 166, Saskatchewan\n\nBittersweet years : the Herbert story\n\nHerbert, Saskatchewan: Town of Herbert, 1987\n\nHighway one ran parallel to the railway\n\nSchool Maps\n\nCanadian Online Historical Map Digisitaztion Project"
