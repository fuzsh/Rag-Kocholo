        "text": "Council has passed three bylaws as of June 10 Regular Council meeting; Bylaw 2024-01 TO REGULATE OPERATION AND PARKING OF VEHICLES; BYLAW 2024-03 TO PERMIT THE OPERATION OF GOLF CARTS ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WITHIN THE LIMTS OF THE MUNICIPALITY & BYLAW 2024-06 TO LICENCE, REGULATE, CONTROL AND PROHIBIT THE OWNERSHIP AND POSSESSION OF CERTAIN ANIMALS. These bylaws can be accessed via the GOVERNANCE tab at the top of the homepage; choose BYLAWS & POLICIES from the drop down list.\n\nOne of the most noteable changes regarding the POSSESSION OF ANIMALS allows Herbert ratepayers three (3) hens maximum. Roosters are a no-go!\n\nThe Branch Pick-up schedule will begin Wednesday, May 1 & every second Wednesday, thereafter. Branches need to be placed in back lanes in manageable sized piles & pieces.\n\nWe will not pick up cut down trees, stumps, or branches exceeding 7 feet. This is meant as a quick service for an entire community. We encourage anyone with a vehicle & means to load & dispose of branches yourself.\n\nThe Town having to report streetlight outages is a thing of the past. SaskPower has now made it very easy for anyone to report a streetlight outage using their online reporting tool via www.saskpower.com. Simply select the Outages tab located at the top of the homepage > Power Outages > Report an Outage > online reporting tool > enter Herbert > click upon the appropriate street light icon, input any notable information, & follow remaining prompts to complete the submission process.\n\nThe Town office often receives requests for various landscaping materials, but as a municipality, we can only offer what we require for regular town maintenance. Landscaping materials can be sourced through our local supplier, Brent Doyle of B.A.D.'S Trucking; call 306-629-7778 for more information. Swift Current also hosts landscape suppliers depending on the product that's wanted. We'll give a shout-out to Nijo Yard Supplies Plus!\n\nIt's also important to note that a 3-yard maximum of any of the Town supplied materials is allotted per household for a cost, plus delivery at $20/load; be it a loader bucket (holds three yards max) or a skid steer bucket full at a time (carries one-yard max).\n\nWe offer: Gravel (3/4\" rock with sand) - $35/yd plus delivery\n\nCrusher dust - $40/yd plus delivery\n\nDirt (NOT TOPSOIL) from digs, etc. - $25/yd plus delivery (not recommended for lawns or gardens)\n\nSand (NOT SCREENED) - $20.00/yd plus delivery\n\nSand salt - $68/yd plus delivery\n\nThe Town has now gone live with an EMERGENCY Maintenance telephone number.\n\nCALL 639-926-7100\n\nThis is only meant for reporting a serious issue; for example, your basement is filling up with water & you haven't the means to shut the water off; the shut-off cannot be located, or the valve has seized making it impossible to shut the water off. This would be considered an emergency for Town staff. Staff would turn the water off at the curb to stop water from running into the house until the situation is resolved.\n\nIt is not meant for anyone with sewer issues. You'll need to call a sewer service or a plumber.\n\nClick on the highlighed link to view SAMA's informational pamphlet regarding: How Property Assessment Works in Saskatchewan. It clarifies SAMA's role in the assessment process.\n\nOnce the municipal assessment roll has been completed, homeowners are given the opportunity to appeal a property assessment. However, it's important to understand that the appeal process is about appealing an error in the assessed value of your property or classification of your property; homeowner's cannot appeal their tax levy.\n\nFor a better understanding, click on the following link: Assessment Appeals Guide in Saskatchewan for Citizens"
