The taxpayer or the taxpayer’s representative may confer with the commissioner or the commissioner’s duly authorized representative as to the proposed assessment within 30 days after the date of such notification. After the expiration of 30 days from the date of such notification, the commissioner shall assess the amount of tax remaining due to the commonwealth, or any portion thereof, which the commissioner believes has not been assessed.\n\n(2) In the case of 1 or more corporations that participated or were required to participate in a filing through the means of a combined report under section 32B of chapter 63, the commissioner may effect the issuance of a notice of the intention to assess or a notice of assessment to each corporation that participated or was required to participate in the combined report with respect to any tax liability due from such corporation under said chapter 63, whether relating to the income measure or non-income measure of the corporate excise or minimum excise tax liability, by issuing a single notice to the principal reporting corporation on its own behalf and as the agent for each corporation that is being assessed.

An application for abatement under section 37 shall not be required for overpayments resulting from assessments made pursuant to this section.\n\n(4) Failure to receive the notice provided for by this section shall not affect the validity of the tax.\n\nSECTION 101.
