DETROIT – Detroit Pistons legend Chauncey “Mr. Big Shot” Billups, renowned for his clutch performances, has been elected to the prestigious Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2024, a testament to his remarkable career in the NBA, as reported by NBA Insider Shams Charania.

The official announcement will be revealed on Saturday (April 6) at the NCAA Final Four.

Billups received the moniker of Mr. Big Shot because he delivered whenever the rubber needed to meet the road, no matter how crucial the plays were.

The current head coach of the Portland Trailblazers carved his path in the NBA over 17 seasons, showcasing his skills in various teams before making a lasting impact in Detroit.

He was selected No. 3 overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1997 NBA draft before playing for the Toronto Raptors, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Denver Nuggets before signing a lucrative five-year $35 million deal to revive the Pistons organization and fanbase in 2002.

In the mid-2000s, Billups helped the Detroit Bad Boys 2.0 achieve the ultimate prize with a five-game sweep against the vaunted Los Angeles Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals, becoming the series’ most valuable player.

During his run in the Eastern Conference, Billups was named a five-time NBA All-Star while leading the Pistons to their third title in franchise history.

For his accolades with the Pistons, Mr. Big Shot had his No. 1 jersey retired in 2016. During his 17-year career, Billups averaged 15.2 points and 5.4 assists per game, while his 89.4 free-throw percentage is sixth-best in NBA/ABA history.
