        "text": "The Detroit Pistons' representation in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame could grow this year.\n\nFormer Pistons great Chauncey Billups was named a finalist for Hall's class of 2024. Known in his time in Detroit as \"Mr. Big Shot,\" the guard was one of seven players listed to make the finalist cut. Longtime NBA coach Doug Collins, who headed the Pistons from 1995-98, was also named a finalist for his work as a coach and broadcaster by the Contributor Committee.\n\nSHAWN WINDSOR: Monty Williams' lineup choices are stunting Detroit Pistons development\n\nThe 14 finalists get one more vote before the new class is announced on April 6 at the NCAA tournament's Final Four in Phoenix.\n\nBillups was one of the main leaders on the 2004 NBA champion Pistons, winning Finals MVP in the five-game victory over the Lakers while averaging 21 points and 5.2 assists a game. Billups earned his nickname for his clutch ability for his seemingly innate ability to deliver in the biggest moments, which included his banked-in 40-footer against the Nets in Game 5 of the 2004 Eastern Conference semifinals,.\n\nBillups found a home in Detroit after playing for four teams before being traded to the Pistons in 2002-03, and the franchise retired his No. 1.in 2016. Billups is the current head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nCollins' time in Detroit doesn't come up often in the discuttions of his long coaching career, but it was his first job after being fired by the Bulls in 1989 (in part because Chicago couldn't get past the Pistons in the playoffs). He was brought in during Grant Hill's second season and led the Pistons to two playoff appearances, losing in the first round both seasons. Collins went 121-88 as Pistons coach before being fired 45 games into the 1997-98 season.\n\nAfter a stretch on TV, Collins returned to coaching with two seasons in Washington, where he went 37-45 in 2001-02 and 2002-03. His final NBA coaching job was in Philadelphia, where he went 110-120 over three seasons (2010-2013). In all, Collins went 442-407 (for a .521 winning percentage), though he finished in the top five in Coach of the Year voting in five seasons."
