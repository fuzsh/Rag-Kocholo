        "text": "When starting a business it is repeatedly stressed that the team formed at the beginning of the organization is worth far more than the idea itself. I think the importance of this statement can not be understated. Hiring your first 5 employees has an impact on how the organization will develop. By capitalizing on a team that is able to work together to achieve the goal of the organization, even a lackluster business can stay afloat.\n\nThis thought has led me to think about what makes a perfect team and if there is some sort of checklist that a team should have in order to succeed. In my opinion, some of the most dynamic teams in history have been formed away from the business, with success stories coming from music, movies and of course basketball.\n\nBut there are some elements of teams that have led me to dig deeper into dynamics between teams and what has been successful. Although most basketball fans would point toward the 95’-96’ Chicago Bulls — who were led by Michael Jordan to win 72–10 games and a championship — as the best team in history, I would argue they do not classify as a good team. This is because the 95’-96’ Chicago Bulls had problems with chemistry that were overshadowed by their ability to outpace their opponents night in and night out. The team had some problems getting along away from the court. In fact, It is rumored the Dennis Rodman never had a conversation with Scottie Pippen or Michael Jordan away from the court.\n\nI believe there are 3 elements to an effective team needs to have in order to be successful and the Chicago Bull’s miss one of the important elements, which is to “build comradery beyond your assigned task”. A lack of comradery and friendship away from the task a team is working towards can lead to a lack of desire to contribute to the team from members who might not have a central role. A great team is able to engage all personalities types and bring them into the collective group even away from a task.\n\nThe other 2 elements I believe make a team great are:\n\n1) Build A Sense of Individual Contribution by Separating Tasks 2)Find and Foster Team Members Comfort with an Ability to Step Into Leadership Positions\n\nThroughout this article, I will highlight how some of my favourite teams and leaders have been able to construct teams that are able to work to these strengths and some that could have improved. I will cover the 2004 Detroit Pistons, The Beatles, and Seven Samurai.\n\nBuild Comrodery Beyond Your Assigned Task\n\nThis element of teams is, in my opinion, the most difficult to build but can be done in a variety of ways. One of the most efficient ways of having this type of comradery is by finding people who you are able to become friends with. An MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory shows that when it comes to predicting the success of a great team, the most important element is how well the team communicates during informal meetings. With that in mind, the 95’-96’ Bulls were a major anomaly when it comes to creating a friendship.\n\nUnlike the Bulls, the 04’ pistons were able to build comradery that went far beyond basketball.\n\nThe Pistons in 04’ did something that has yet to be replicated by many. They were able to bring together a group of players who had had hard times in their careers into a unit that operated under a hard nosed mentality. The team was led by Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Ben Wallace, Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace. Unlike most teams who have a dominating superstar with all star talent across the roster, the Detroit Pistons were able to convince mid-level players to join the team and bring their talents together. Rasheed Wallace had played a decent 8-year career with Portland prior to the 04’ season, producing a solid 18/8 stat line year after year and developing a reputation for his temper. Ben Wallace excelled in rebounding and defense in Detroit. Tayshaun Prince was entering his 3rd year in the league averaging 14 ppg. Richard Hamilton was a dominant scorer who could complement many positions. And of course, Chauncey Billups was a point guard who had never really found his place in the NBA.\n\nOddly enough, this group of misfits was able to come together and win a championship against the infamous Laker’s dynasty.\n\nSomething obviously clicked, but what?\n\nIn my opinion, it was the Detroit Pistons ability to build a team that enjoyed each other’s company while working hard. Chauncey Billups was on the Vertical Podcast and said\n\n“The team often talks on a group text and say things — and we mean this when we say it — that what we did will never happen again in the fashion that it happened,” Billups said. “You’re talking about … a lot of throwaways that came together and played great basketball, loved each other, became brothers.\n\n“There was never any fights on our team, never any dissension, never ever, not one time, not one practice, and we competed hard every day. But we got it, so I just think what we did will never happen again. We didn’t have one guy making the max. It was just an anomaly. It really was.”\n\nDetroit was never dominant, they just won games. Time and time and time again. Their resume is never going to reflect how tough they were to actually play. They went to six consecutive conference finals. They each understood what they needed to do to help the team win and did it consistently. They were a perfect team and one that we can learn a lot from. Building a sense of friendship is the way they were able to make it through the tougher losses and able to pick each other up to win. When building a team, find people who you can see yourself building a friendship with. It is hard to do with everyone on the team but if the core is strong, the rest will follow in the right direction. It is a lesson truly emulated by the 2004 Detroit Pistons.\n\nCreate a Sense of Contribution by Separating Tasks\n\nMost good teams are led by a great leader or star like Michael Jordan. But only the great teams collaborate with their great leader. A lot of times a leader’s ability to be great in a task will also mean his tendency to be controlling in his pursuit of greatness. The best teams understand their role and collaborate with their leader. They understand what tasks they need to do in order to succeed and what to work hard on. When a leader sticks to the tasks that they excel in, the supporting cast can do the same and elevate the work of the group. My favourite example of this is in the movie Seven Samurai, by Akira Kurosawa.\n\nThe film is a story about a samurai who falls on hard times and takes a role protecting a village from bandits. He brings along a team of 6 other samurais and they protect the village from bandits together as a team. Seven Samurai is a film like no other. The first Samurai is named Kambei and is a wise old samurai willing to help people. Kambei understands his role as the coach of the samurai team he must build.\n\nHe is first joined by Katsushiro, a young apprentice to Kambei who is eager to learn from him. Officially the first Samurai to join the group of seven aside from Katsushiro is a man named Gorobei how Kambei recruits. Gorobei is quiet, observant and good-natured he is by no means the leader of the team but someone who will be able to stay calm during stressful situations. The next Samurai to join is a woodcutter named Heihachi. Heihachi is very cheerful and upbeat and agreed to join them, providing his role in lifting the team’s spirits. Next to join is Kyuzo. Imagine Kyuzo as the leading scorer on a basketball team as the most skilled swordsman of the group. Shichiroji comes along next — Kambei’s old friend from war — who joins his force simply to fight alongside him again. Last to join is Kikuchiyo, a ferocious mysterious samurai who fight ferociously — the loose cannon of the group.\n\nAll of these different attributes allow each individual samurai to specialize in their expertise and work to improve the team. By keeping responsibilities separate, everyone feels like an important member of the team and as a key contribution to the cause. Although this might seem intuitive on paper, it is hard to achieve such harmony within a team. When personalities care about a task, they are bound to overstep their roles. By creating a culture that understands that the best support of another team member is to double down on your responsibilities, a company can excel early on and avoid a lack of confusion internally. Seven Samurai is a perfect analysis of the was different dynamics, personalities, and responsibilities in a team end up leading to a more cohesive unit in the long run.\n\nFind and Foster Team Members Comfort with an Ability to Step Into Leadership Positions\n\nWhen most people mention some of the greatest teams of all time, it is hard not to mention The Beatles. It would take too long to list the accomplishments that The Beatles had throughout their career collectively. But looking back on their career there is one thing that sticks out as a flaw, which is their ability to foster a team where leaders were comfortable stepping back from the spotlight in order to give others a chance to lead.\n\nThis seems to be the case in the music industry time and time again. Bands breakup because egos and ambitions of leaders and their inability to share the spotlight with their bandmates.\n\nHad John and Paul been able to do this, and there might have been much more to The Beatles saga.\n\nMy favourite story that exemplifies this is the relationship George and Paul had with George Harrison. George is usually spoken of as the third member of the Beatles but in fact, he was instrumental in writing some of the band’s greatest hits. Harrison’s 1970 solo classic, All Things Must Pass, is universally regarded as the finest solo album by any ex-Beatle and rightly so. But even before his solo career, George was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nDuring 1969, after a small hiatus from the Beatles, George returned only to be disappointed with the inability of his leader to step away from the spotlight. Paul could not see what this was doing to the team. “At that point in time, Paul couldn’t see beyond himself,” Harrison told Guitar World in 2001.\n\n“He was on a roll, but … in his mind, everything that was going on around him was just there to accompany him”\n\nKiller songs written by George like “Isn’t it a Pity” and “Something” were turned down for more John and Paul tracks without even a second look. The same thing happened the following week when Harrison brought in “Hear Me Lord,” which he’d written over the weekend. Two days later, on January 8th, Harrison debuted the song “I Me Mine,” only to be met with more indifference. Tensions finally erupted during a lunch break on January 10th, which escalated to George leaving the group. That same day George went home, upset at the direction and recent breakup and wrote “Wah Wah”, one of the standouts on his solo album All Things Must Pass.\n\nIt is a sad story and one that could have easily been avoided with the leader ability to understand the group need of sharing leadership roles. As a leader, it is important to let the people you work with to have the spotlight when necessary. There is a great quote by Pablo Picasso that reads;\n\n“Good artists copy; great artists steal”\n\n& I believe that similarly;\n\n“Good leaders Lead, Great Leaders Follow”\n\nI only wish John and Paul would have understood this at the time of these arguments.\n\nThere is No Perfect Solution\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to note that even the most perfect teams are flawed. Some of the greatest successes can come from fragments. But there is a real joy in watching a great team operate and participating in one. Feeling like an important part of the bigger picture is a beautiful feeling.\n\nWriting this article has made me reflect on the great teams I have been apart of.\n\nWhen I was in grade 11, I was fortunate enough to be a part of a great volleyball team. As one of the youngest members of the team, it was less than likely that I was going to receive much time to play during games. But I never felt a lack of desire to contribute to the team because of our leader’s abilities to create a circle of friendship that went beyond volleyball. I understood my role and was able to challenge starters during practice and cheer our team during games. And I was given opportunities to step up for the team when needed. As a good athlete, it is strange to think back to the one team I didn’t play a central part of as the best team I have ever been on. I attribute that to the ability to build comradery beyond our task. Separate our roles and allow everyone the ability to lead. Our team ended up winning silver at OFSAA that year. It was one of the happiest memories I have."
