        "text": "After the Pistons’ most recent loss to the Denver Nuggets Sunday night, They currently hold a record of 3-33. One of the craziest things about this record is the attention the media has been giving it. I understand that the Pistons went down in NBA history as the team with the most consecutive losses in an NBA season with 28 defeats. The wildest thing about their season is, DESPITE being the media’s punchline of jokes, They are only two games back from not having the worst record in the league. The San Antonio Spurs are currently 5-30 this season, but no one talks about it because of Wembanyama.\n\nWatching the Pistons this season has me missing some of the greats that played here. Now understand this: I was born in July of 1989, so my memory of some of these players is built through YouTube and NBA classics. This week allows me to put together the best Detroit Pistons team I could put together with some of the all-time greats. Another thing I want you all to understand about this list is that I am putting together my lineup based on accurate POSITIONS! Let’s put together the greatest starting 5 in Detroit Pistons history, starting with the point guard position.\n\nThe Case For Dave Bing As The All-Time Pistons Point Guard.\n\nThe Pistons have had some influential guys who played the point. It started with the great Dave Bing, the 2nd pick in the 1966 NBA draft. Bing would put up some impressive numbers during his career with the Detroit Pistons during the nine seasons he played in Detroit.\n\n22.6 PPG\n\n4.2 REB\n\n6.4 AST\n\n1.4 STLS\n\n44% FG\n\n77% FT\n\nBing would also go on to achieve some tremendous individual success as well.\n\nNBA Rookie Of The Year (66-67)\n\nNBA All-Rookie (66-67)\n\n1967-68 Scoring Champ (27.1)\n\n6x NBA All-Star\n\n3x All-NBA Team (1x 1st team & 2x 2nd team)\n\n1975-76 NBA All-Star MVP\n\nWalter J. Kennedy Citizenship Award (76-77)\n\nNaismith Basketball Hall Of Fame (1990)\n\nCollege Hall Of Fame (2006)\n\nNBA 50 & 75th Anniversary Team\n\nDespite all that success, Bing could only lead the Pistons to winning seasons in two of the nine seasons he played for the team. In addition, Bing has only seen the playoffs sixteen times as a member of the Detroit Pistons. Some may see Bing as a significant success on the court, but what he did off the court will forever have him goated in Detroit.\n\nLife After Basketball\n\nAfter retiring from basketball, Bing would start Bing Steal with 225,000.00 in bank loans and 80,000.00 of his own money. Six months into the venture, Bing would lose all that money and realized it would be best to go from manufacturing to being the middleman. In his second year of business with General Motors as his first major client, THe Bing group would go on to supply metal stampings to the “Big 3.”\n\nThe Transition To Isiah Thomas\n\nWhen Bing was traded after the 73-74 season, The Pistons turned to Kevin Porter, who would average 11.9 PPG & 10.1 AST during the four seasons he played in Detroit. Like Bing, Porter could only lead the Pistons to one playoff and winning season. Knowing they needed a dynamic guard to help them win games, The Pistons drafted Isiah Thomas with the 2nd pick in the 1981 NBA draft.\n\nThe Case For Isiah Thomas As The All-Time Pistons Point Guard\n\nThomas had no interest in playing for the Pistons. Thomas did everything he could to fall to his hometown team, the Chicago Bulls. It didn’t work out how he wanted it to, as the Pistons still selected him. It didn’t take long for the Franchise to realize they had something special and needed to surround him with pieces that could take his game to another level. Now It was time to build a championship team around Zeke.\n\nGoing From Good To Great\n\nIt started with a trade for Bill Laimbeer, then continued with these moves.\n\nJoe Dumars was the 18th overall pick in the 1985 NBA Draft.\n\nJohn Salley was the 11th overall pick in the 1986 NBA Draft.\n\nDennis Rodman was the 27th overall pick in the 1986 NBA Draft.\n\nTraded Kelly Trapuckia and Keith Benson for Adrian Dantley.\n\nTraded Dan Roundfield for Rick Mahorn.\n\nTraded Adrian Dantley for Mark Aguirre.\n\nTraded Ron Moore for James Edwards.\n\nAnd just like that, The Pistons went from an exciting brand of basketball that didn’t win them many games to a physical style that won them championships. Isiah’s style of basketball was’ beautiful and unique. He had the offensive abilities to put up 20+ points and 10+ assists, as he did in four of the twelve seasons he played, but he could play gritty. Thomas never averaged less than 1.2 steals during his career, and he had five years where he averaged over two steals per game.\n\nAnother Dynamic Point Guard With Accolades\n\nJust like Bing, Zeke would have a pretty good career in Detroit.\n\n19.2 PPG\n\n3.6 REB\n\n9.3 AST\n\n1.9 STLS\n\n45% FG\n\n29% 3PT\n\n75% FT\n\nUnlike Bing, Thomas was able to achieve not only individual success but also team success.\n\n2x NBA Champion\n\nNBA Finals MVP (1989-90)\n\nNBA All-Rookie Team (1981-82)\n\nNBA Assists Champ (1984-85)\n\n5X All-NBA Team\n\n12x NBA All-Star\n\n2x NBA All-Star MVP\n\nNBA 50th & 75th Anniversary Team\n\nIt was unfortunate to see Zeke have to retire after tearing his ACL. It was even more regrettable for the Pistons not to be able to return to the glory it once had with Thomas at the head of the table. Grant Hill was drafted with the 3rd overall pick in the 1994 draft. Hill became the Piston’s benefacto point guard with no other guard to take the position.\n\nThe Transition To Chauncey Billups\n\nThe Pistons struggled to acquire a legitimate point guard in the early 2000s. Chucky Atkins was a part of the Grant Hill sign-and-trade deal that brought him and Ben Wallace to the Motor City. In the 81 games he played during the 00-01 season, Atkins averaged 12 points and 4.1 assists. During the 01-02 season, Atkins continued on a consistent trail, averaging 12.1 points and 3.3 Assists. Unfortunately for the Pistons, Atkins wasn’t the long-term solution as the team’s point guard. Chauncey Billups became available for free agency, and the Pistons signed him.\n\nOnce considered a bust\n\nChauncey came to the Pistons at the perfect time during his career. Drafted 3rd overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, Billups was surprisingly traded to the Raptors. With no clear direction from the Celtics coaching staff, Billups’s ability to play both the point and the two proved too much for the team to handle. In Toronto, Billups had a solid 29 games, averaging 11.3 Points and 3.3 Assists. That short sample size wasn’t enough to keep in Toronto, as he was traded to Denver in a 3-team deal on January 21, 1999.\n\nBillups couldn’t find his footing in Denver and was ultimately traded to the Orlando Magic but never played a game for the Magic. The label bust grew louder and louder for Billups until he signed on with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Under the mentorship of Terrell Brandon, Billups went from averaging 9.3 points during the 00-01 season to 12.5 points during the 01-02 season.\n\nThe Case For Chauncey Billups As The All-Time Pistons Point Guard\n\nOn July 17, 2002, The Detroit Pistons signed Chauncey Billups to a 6yr/35 million dollar contract. The Pistons solidified its guards with Billups and recently acquired Richard Hamilton for the next 6+ seasons. Unlike Bing & Zeke, Chauncey was a big, physical point guard who loved to post up smaller guards and punish them. There was nothing sexy about Chauncey Billups’ game, a match made in heaven with this Pistons team.\n\nIn the eight seasons Billups played for the Pistons, Billups put up some solid numbers.\n\n16.5 PPG\n\n3.2 REB\n\n6.2 AST\n\n1.0 STLS\n\n42% FG\n\n39% 3PT\n\n89% FT\n\nCompared to the other two greats, Chauncey doesn’t stack up, but what has Chauncey in this conversation is his ability to hit the most significant shots when the Pistons needed him to do so. Nicknamed Mr. Big Shot, Chauncey was a nightmare to see out on the court in close game situations. You knew where the ball was going for the Pistons, and you knew there was always a better chance for Chauncey to make the shot than missing the picture.\n\nThe Pistons Haven’t Been Good Since Trading Him\n\n“The Going To Work” Pistons was an exciting brand of basketball if you loved defense. RIP & Chauncey embraced the defensive philosophies that were developed, and that transition helped the team become an Eastern Conference powerhouse. Billups was finally getting recognition from coaches and fans alike.\n\n3x All-Star\n\n2x All-NBA (1x 2nd Team & 1x 3rd Team)\n\n2x All-NBA Defensive Team (2x 2nd Team)\n\nNBA Champion (03-04)\n\nNBA Finals MVP (03-04)\n\nInterestingly, the Pistons haven’t been good since the trade of Billups back to Denver. Instead, it’s been questionable trades for often injured superstars, signing players way past their prime, or overlooking players in the draft who come out and become stars.\n\nWho Gets The Starting Point-Guard Position On My All-Time Team\n\nAs much as I love Chauncey and respect Dave Bing, Isiah Thomas is the guy I am starting. Zeke’s impact on the Pistons made the team famous outside of Detroit. Say what you want about the Bad Boy Pistons; Teams were trying their best to emulate what they did night-to-night. Some of your favorite point guards today want to play like Isiah Thomas did. That should tell you everything you need to know about his impact.\n\nStart: Isiah Thomas\n\nBench: Dave Bing\n\nCut: Chauncey Billups"
