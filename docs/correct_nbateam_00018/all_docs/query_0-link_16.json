        "text": "It's a big honor for Mr. Big Shot.\n\nFormer Pistons great Chauncey Billups is heading to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame this fall, as part of the 2024 class that includes former Raptors great Vince Carter and Lakers star Michael Cooper. Former Pistons coach Doug Collins also was among the 13 chosed for induction by the selection committee.\n\nBillups, the point guard for Pistons' 2004 NBA championship team, was the Finals MVP that year and he becomes the second player from that championship team to be chosen for the hall of fame, where he will join former teammate Ben Wallace in Springfield, Mass. in August.\n\n“Chauncey is the ultimate leader and connector – not only in the way he played, but how he’s continued contributing to the game as a broadcaster and now as a head coach. He made his mark in Detroit, and it’s hard to overstate what he means to our franchise and our community,\" Pistons owner Tom Gores said in a team statement. \"His selflessness, poise and ability to step up in big moments helped define Pistons basketball for a generation. Chauncey is the latest in a long line of Pistons greats to enter the Hall of Fame. His legacy, including this well-deserved recognition, serve as inspiration for our younger players and a shining example of the rich tradition celebrated by our franchise.”\n\nWallace was inducted into the Hall in 2021. Now Billups joins him.\n\n“We all came, watched (Ben's) induction, and we all felt like we were already in, because he was in,” Billups said. “That's how we played. That's who we were. I'm just the next one up.”\n\nIn 1997, Billups was selected third overall by the Boston Celtics, and he played 1,043 career games during 17 seasons with Boston, Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, Detroit, New York and the Los Angeles Clippers. Billups signed with the Pistons as a free agent in 2002 and played seven seasons in Detroit, from 2002-08, before returning to play his final NBA season in 2013.\n\nBillups was a five-time All-Star, with consective selections from 2006-10, including three with the Pistons, from 2008-10. He also was named All-NBA three times, with a second-team selection in 2006 and third team in '07 and '09.\n\n“We don’t win a third NBA Championship without Chauncey’s leadership. When the ball was in his hands, you just knew he was going to make the right play,\" said Pistons icon Joe Dumars, who was the team president during that champioship era. \"His skillset and accomplishments on the court, his competitiveness and his sportsmanship validate this well-deserved honor.”"
