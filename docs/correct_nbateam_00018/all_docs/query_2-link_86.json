        "text": "Chauncey Ray Billups (born September 25, 1976 in Denver, Colorado) is a player for the NBA's Detroit Pistons. He played college basketball at the University of Colorado. He was drafted third overall in the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was traded midway through his first season. He played for the Toronto Raptors, Denver Nuggets and Minnesota Timberwolves before finding a home in Detroit as the team's starting point guard.\n\nBillups helped lead the Pistons to the 2004 NBA championship, averaging 21 points per game and 5.2 assists in the NBA Finals to earn the Finals MVP Award.\n\nBillups is an outstanding free-throw and 3-point shooter, which has earned him the nickname \"Mr. Big Shot.\" He has also received the nickname \"Smooth\" for his running of the floor. He is a good defender and a solid playmaker, and is a feared \"clutch player\", who often takes and makes the last shot for his team. He is versatile enough to play shooting guard if the need arises.\n\nHigh School Career\n\nChauncey Billups attended George Washington High School in Denver, Colorado. While there, he was a four time All-State first team pick, the Mr. Colorado basketball pick three times, and Colorado Player of the Year as a sophomore and as a junior. He also played in the 1995 McDonald's High School All-American game.\n\nExternal link"
