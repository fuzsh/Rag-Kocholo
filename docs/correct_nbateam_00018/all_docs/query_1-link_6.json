        "text": "By Dan Jenkins\n\n@DanTJenkins\n\nDetroit Pistons legend Chauncey Billups had some pretty remarkable moments at the Palace of Auburn Hills during his eight seasons with the team, culminating in winning Finals MVP when the Pistons won the 2004 NBA Championship.\n\nThe 40-year-old retired point guard sounded off on Twitter on Monday night, a day before team owner Tom Gores is expected to announce that the Pistons will be moving back to downtown Detroit after playing in Oakland County for almost 40 years.\n\nBillups likes the idea of the move, calling it \"good for the city and organization.\"\n\nBillups had his No. 1 jersey retired to the Palace rafters back in February. He now works as an NBA analyst for ESPN.\n\nBillups is second in Pistons history in 3-pointers made (890) -- behind Joe Dumars -- and first in free throw percentage (.892).\n\nThe Pistons will likely move in to the still-under-construction Little Caesars Arena with the Detroit Red Wings next fall. Rumors have swirled for months that Gores has been trying to work out a deal with the Ilitch family and Olympia Development to bring the Pistons back to Detroit, who last called the city home in 1978 at Cobo Arena.\n\nGores and Chris Ilitch will make the announcement on Tuesday at Cass Tech High School at 3 p.m."
