        "text": "Vince Carter and Chauncey Billups are set to be immortalized in basketball history. The Athletic reports that the two NBA legends were elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as members of the 2024 induction class. Reports state that an official announcement will be made on Saturday (April 6) during the 2024 Men’s NCAA Final Four. Dick Barnett, who became a two-time NBA champion with the 1970s New York Knicks, is another basketball great reportedly in the 2024 class.\n\nThe publication also detailed a slew of finalists for the coveted shrine. These names include Harley Redin, Walter Davis, Michael Cooper, Bo Ryan, Seimone Augustus—an eight-time WNBA All-Star; Charles Smith; Marian Washington—long-time coach of the University of Kansas women’s basketball team, Michele Timms, Doug Collins, Herb Simon, and Jerry West.\n\nVince Carter and Chauncey Billups had fantastic careers. The Golden State Warriors drafted Carter at No. 5 in the 1998 NBA Draft and traded him to the Toronto Raptors. That year, Carter proved his time as a North Carolina Tar Heel was just the beginning, winning the NBA’s Rookie of the Year award.\n\n“Vinsanity” then embarked on an adventurous career, playing for 22 years across eight teams. But he is best known for his time with the New Jersey Nets and the Raptors. Carter is synonymous with being one of the best dunkers in NBA history. His moment of glory arrived in the 2000 NBA Dunk Contest when he gave one of the all-time best performances of the All-Star event. Vince also led the Raptors to their first three playoff appearances in franchise history.\n\nAs for Chauncey Billups, he was drafted the year before in the 1997 draft. Billups was selected third overall by the Boston Celtics. Chauncey’s time with the Celtics was brief as he struggled his rookie year. Rick Pitino, head coach at the time, grew tired of Billups’ rookie behavior and felt he wasn’t cut out for the fast-paced squad. In one of the most controversial moves in NBA history, Pitino traded away their rookie asset, sending Chauncy on an adventurous journey through the NBA.\n\nBillups then played for the Raptors, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Denver Nuggets before finding a home with the Detroit Pistons in 2002. As a part of the Pistons, Chauncey became the 2004 NBA Finals MVP as he led his team to a 4-1 victory over Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Los Angeles Lakers."
