        "text": "I’m coaching my 13 year old son’s basketball team this year. Last year the team had a superstar who led the team in virtually every category. It was great watching him play but his tremendous skill also caused the other players on the team to take a backseat and rely on this one person to do everything every time down the court. The team ended up with a losing record and this one superstar decided to move on to a more competitive team. We were sad to see him leave but I believe it was the best move for both him as well as the team. This year every member of the team is challenged to step up and contribute. While it is early, it is really rewarding to see the team starting to gel as a cohesive and collective unit.\n\nIt got me thinking about the value of the group over individual performance within teams. When talking about company values, there is a thesaurus full of words that speak to the concept of working together. Whether it be described as “collaboration”, “partnership”, “teamwork” or something similar, it is a characteristic consistently sought after by people at all levels of the org. The idea that we win together and lose together creates the feeling of tribe that so many of us desire to feel in our professional lives in the same manner we choose family in our personal lives.\n\nI grew up an athlete. Mostly basketball. Like so many others who played team sports, the lessons learned sweating in musty gyms remain applicable in so many parts of life. The concepts of team, selflessness, communication, trust and cooperation rank at the top. But in my mind these concepts are better summed up in a single word: “chemistry”. Chemistry is a somewhat amorphous term and means different things to different people - which is why it is a powerful virtue. It can be applied on a situational basis. Personally I think of chemistry as what happens when the whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts. It occurs when each individual makes the teammates around them better. It fosters a faith in each other that allows for healthy friction and give and take while avoiding the toxic environment that can be any team’s own worst enemy. Chemistry allows for the ebb and flow of situations, for trends and circumstances, all while maintaining a constant core connection amongst the individual members. It is this chemistry that keeps groups together through the hard times and is a catalyst for overachievement when the unit is challenged.\n\nThere may be no better example of the value of good chemistry than the story of the 2004 NBA Finals. The Los Angeles Lakers had won the NBA Championship three of the previous four years. They were led by Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant, two of the top ten players of all time. They were coached by Phil Jackson who owns the highest winning percentage of any coach in the Hall of Fame. The Lakers seemed to be on the verge of creating a dynasty. This was LA in its sports glory: “Showtime” had returned, celebrities sat courtside, and teams feared being crushed on national television. And to this juggernaut the Lakers added Karl Malone, the second highest scorer in NBA history, and Gary Payton, widely considered one of the greatest point guards of all time and the only point guard to have won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Granted Malone and Payton were on the back end of their careers but they came to Los Angeles to win the title that had eluded both of them for so long. With this line up of four Hall of Famers, a Hall of Fame coach and several of the best role players and back-ups in the league, the Lakers were heavy favorites to win it all. They cruised into the Finals to represent the Western Conference.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, the Indiana Pacers had established the best record in the league, secured home court advantage throughout the playoffs, and were expected to battle the Lakers for the title. Meanwhile, however, the Detroit Pistons had been quietly building a strong contender. They pulled together several players who had been solid contributors on other teams but were not widely considered superstars. Pistons president Joe Dumars (a former NBA champion as a player) saw opportunity as he understood how to combine unique talent sets to complement each other and correspondingly dramatically improve the team. The team was led by journeyman guard Chauncey Billups and Rip Hamilton, who would each go on to be named all-stars three times while playing together as Pistons. The Pistons took a while to gel but eventually found their groove. Unlike the individual stars in Los Angeles, the Pistons thrived by playing team basketball. The Lakers were the third highest scoring team in the league while the Pistons were 24th. However, the Pistons were second in the league in team defense and a leader in team assists. This approach helped to lead the Pistons in their upset of the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals and set up a championship series against the formidable Lakers.\n\nOn paper the Finals looked to be a rout in the making. The Lakers were 8-to-1 favorites to win the title. Even Detroit’s hometown newspapers expected a humbling outcome. One writer in the Detroit News stated: “The question isn’t who wins, but how long the Los Angeles Lakers toy with the Detroit Pistons en route to a 10th NBA Championship. Five games? Six? Either way, you can count on the Pistons being exposed pretty quickly as just another Eastern Conference pretender.”\n\nHowever the chemistry enjoyed by the Pistons was greatly underrated and would prove a more daunting challenge than anticipated. The Lakers played as four individual contributors - incredible talents to be sure - but never were fully in sync for long periods of time. Shaq and Kobe were at odds, both making negative public remarks about each other and having to be pulled apart during one practice after Shaq literally threatened to murder Kobe. Kobe talked publicly about leaving the Lakers after the season and testing free agency. Shaq was very vocal about wanting a hefty contract extension. Karl Malone felt he was not getting enough shots and was injured for a large part of the season. It was the first serious injury in his career and deeply affected his mental toughness. Gary Payton became frustrated with his inability to be the floor general with so many competing egos. As is often the case, the media swarmed on the dissention, publishing rumors and opinions that only fueled the fire. Payton would later say the team’s inability to communicate honestly and transparently during those trying times created and exasperated wedges that even the best individual talents could not overcome. Laker back-up point guard Derek Fisher explained it this way: “We weren’t a team. We were a collection of very accomplished and high-achieving individuals...but we weren’t a team.”\n\nThe Pistons meanwhile stayed out of papers and simply focused on becoming a better as a unit. They played an 11 man roster with a calculated gameplan and a strong emphasis on team stats over individual stats. And most of all they believed that each player made the others around him better. Kobe would later say: ““They were a well oiled machine on both ends of the floor. They knew each other’s moves inside and out. They could anticipate each play and knew their role in it. They knew each other’s tendencies and how to react. We didn’t have that.”\n\nIn the end, the Pistons shocked the world and won the series 4-1 with the only Laker win coming on a last second shot by Kobe in Game 2. It could have easily been a sweep and is still considered one of the greatest upsets in NBA history.\n\nThe loss was devastating for the Lakers and they fell apart. Phil Jackson’s contract was not renewed. Shaq requested a trade and moved to the Miami Heat. Gary Payton was traded and Karl Malone retired. It would take Kobe another five years to get back to the Finals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pistons made it back to the NBA Finals the following year, albeit losing to the great Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs. The players on that 2003-04 team still talk about it being the best team they’ve ever been on, despite many of them being on other teams with more star power. To this day that team still maintains a group text amongst themselves.\n\nFor me this is story of two different ways of pursuing the same goal. I think Fisher summed it up well: “You can have great players, you can have great coaching - the way we did - you can have all the resources available to you and you can actually make it all the way to the Finals. But in the end, the best team will win that series every single time and that’s what the Pistons did.”\n\nThe 2003-2004 Pistons were, in my opinion, a perfect example of the power of chemistry. As a colleague recently mentioned, chemistry is not something you create - it is an outcome. You need to foster and enable it with actions, attitude, approach and appreciation for the greater good. It is about valuing an assist over a made basket, about team victories over individual stats. It is about keeping distractions, politics, ego, and fiefdoms at bay while emphasizing values such as communication, commitment, transparency, hustle and hunger. This applies regardless of the team sport you play - even if that sport is business. As leaders and managers our challenge is not just hiring the best people, it is hiring the people who can work best together and then providing all the support necessary to allow that team to achieve its own NBA title."
