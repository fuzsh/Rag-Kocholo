        "text": "Chauncey Billups has apparently decided he wants to finish his NBA career as a member of the Detroit Pistons, because the 36-year-old veteran guard has agreed to a two-year contract worth roughly $5 million, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports. The second year of the deal is a team option, according to Vincent Goodwill of The Detroit News. The entire roster from the 2004-05 NBA Championship team had already been dismantled in Detroit, but Billups will still have the opportunity to reunite with former teammate Rasheed Wallace, who has joined Maurice Cheeks' staff as an assistant coach.\n\nBillups only played in 42 combined games in the last two seasons, so the Pistons are hoping he will be healthy enough to fill a role as a veteran leader during his time in Detroit. The Pistons are looking to make a playoff push in 2013-14, and after executing a bold move to sign Josh Smith to a long-term deal, the team decided to take the extra step to add Billups as a mentor to Brandon Knight, Rodney Stuckey, Will Bynum and rookie shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\n\nIf Billups can recapture any of the magic from his time in a Pistons uniform, this deal will turn out to be fine for Detroit. It's been a slow climb back since tearing his Achilles tendon in 2012, but Billups did post a 60.1 percent true shooting percentage in limited action with the Clippers last season. He may still have some quality basketball in the tank.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• Flannery: The best (and worst) from NBA free agency\n\n• Ziller: 'Melo on the Lakers?
