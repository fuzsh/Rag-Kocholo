        "text": "After a thrilling win over Missouri (then ranked number nine) over the weekend, the University of Colorado’s men’s basketball team traveled to Manhattan, Kansas, last night to take on the Kansas State Wildcats, who started out the night as the number 20 team in the country. The unranked Buffaloes played hard until the end and managed to pull out a 74-66 win (recap via The Associated Press). Senior Levi Knutson led the way for the Buffs with 20 points, with sophomore Alec Burks and senior Marcus Relphorde each chipping in 12 (box score via CUBuffs.com). “This is a new Colorado,” Knutson tells Boulder’s Daily Camera. “We’ve got a bunch of senior leaders on this team, and that’s pretty cool to be creating some history for this school, creating some tradition.”\n\nKnutson’s claim of making history isn’t hyperbole. The Camera points out that the Buffs had lost 36 consecutive Big 12 road games before a win at Nebraska last March. They’ve now won their sixth consecutive game and improved to 2-0 in conference play (13-4 overall). Saturday’s win over Missouri snapped a 13-game losing streak in Big 12 openers, and the Buffs have won back-to-back games against ranked opponents for the first time ever. It’s also been 14 years since CU beat a top-25 team on the road (the school had lost 31 consecutive games against ranked teams). This weekend the Buffs host Oklahoma State and will play for their first 3-0 conference start since 1997, when the team was led by a promising young star named Chauncey Billups."
