        "text": "Mike Mulholland | MLive.com\n\nMr. Big Shot returns to Detroit\n\nBy Brandon Champion | bchampio@mlive.com\n\nDETROIT – Charismatic Pistons’ PA announcer John Mason said it best for nearly a decade.\n\n“No. 1, out of Colorado. In the Piston home red, blue and white, tonight. The 6-3, Chauncey B-B-Billups.”\n\nAnd while the man known as Mr. Big Shot won't be suiting up for the Pistons, or even for his 3-on-3 squad, the Killer 3s, due to injury, he did spend some time weighing in a slew of basketball-related topics ahead of Friday night's BIG3 games at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.\n\nBIG3 to bring Pistons' 'hero' Chauncey Billups back to Detroit\n\nAmong them: The 2004 Pistons, super teams, the current Pistons squad and the infamous Malice at the Palace involving his current BIG3 teammates Stephen Jackson and Metta World Peace. Here are his responses during a Q&A with MLive Reporter Brandon Champion earlier this week.\n\nAnd be sure to check back tonight for complete coverage of the BIG3 in Detroit.\n\nIn this June 25, 2017 file photo Big3 Basketball League founder Ice Cube applauds the crowd during a timeout in the first half of Game 2 in the league's debut at the Barclays Center in New York.\n\nAP File Photo | Kathy Willens\n\nJoining the BIG3\n\nBrandon Champion: The BIG3 is certainly different than the NBA. What do you like about it?\n\nChauncey Billups: I love everything about it. Some say it's half-court, 3-on-3 basketball and we all old. But I say this all the time, guys like myself, we didn't retire because we lost the love of basketball or to compete. We were fortunate enough to play long enough that those miles start to catch up to you and the league gets younger and the kids come in bigger, faster, stronger so you can't compete at the level you once did.\n\nWhich is why I think this opportunity to amazing. It’s all guys that played in the generation I did that still get out there, play, bump and grind. To get out there and do it again in a competitive fashion in 3-on-3 is nice.\n\nThe Killer 3s\n\nBC: The Killer 3s are 1-2 so far. What needs to happen to turn that around?\n\nCB: We let a tough one slip by last week. We have a tough, tough game this week against the defending champs, Trilogy. We have a good team. I wish I could be out there to help them I think I could take them over the top, but as you can see, I'm all about toughness. You can see the team I drafted. We even got Mike James on the team. One of our champions so it will be fun.\n\nBC: Well you're going up against Rick Mahorn, the coach of the Trilogy.\n\nCB: Yes sir. I've been talking stuff with Pretty Ricky all week.\n\nMetta World Peace (15) of Killer 3s and Carlos Boozer (5) of Ghost Ballers talk during the BIG3 game at United Center, on June 29, 2018, in Chicago. (Courtney Pedroza/Chicago Tribune/TNS)\n\nCourtney Pedroza\n\nMalice at the Palace\n\nBC: You play on the Killer 3s with Metta World Peace and Stephen Jackson. That makes me think of when the Pistons and the Pacers would go at it and of course the infamous brawl at the Palace. Do you guys talk about that?\n\nCB: We've talked about that many times over the years. It's so old now to us that we don't talk about it anymore, but from time and time it comes up. Stephen and I are really good friends and Ron is a good friend, too. So of course, we've talked about. Those guys still feel bad about what happened. It was a very unfortunate night and we all wish we could get a do-over, but we are where we are.\n\nAn overall view of the arena at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.

(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com)\n\n(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com)\n\nLittle Caesars Arena\n\nBC: Have you been to Little Caesars Arena before? What do you think?\n\nCB: Yeah, I went to a game last year. I think it's amazing. It's beautiful. The Pistons are sharing the arena with the hockey team. I think we need to get a little more Pistons feel down there.\n\nMike Mulholland\n\n\"I think the Pistons could be primed to have a really good season\"\n\nBC: What are your thoughts on the current Pistons?\n\nCB: I'm a diehard Piston and will be forever. I'm happy to see they got Dwane Casey who was the coach of the year last year and has been excellent the last several seasons. They're lucky to have him and the East is wide open now.\n\nBoston is strong, Toronto is strong, Philly, but I feel like the Pistons have two All-Stars in Blake and Dre and Reggie, when healthy has shown he can play at an All-Star level. Anytime you got that on your roster you have a chance to make some noise, so, I’m excited. I think the Pistons could be primed to have a really good season.\n\nIn this Jan. 15, 2015, file photo, Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, right, and Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James hug before the start of an NBA basketball game, in Los Angeles. (Paul Rodriguez/The Orange County Register via AP, FIle)\n\nPAUL RODRIGUEZ,\n\nSuper teams\n\nBC: I don't know how you feel about the so-called super teams. Do you feel like teams can win the way you guys did in 2004 and throughout the decade?\n\nCB: Never. It will never happen again, but in our minds were a super team, but to the vast majority of NBA fans we didn't have a superstar. Which was fair, but we showed that you didn't need one. And we beat a super team in 04. I'm not crazy about the super team thing, but it is what it is. We have to evolve. That's the way the game has gone, so you have to embrace it. But me as a competitor I'm not a fan of that. But the game is in great shape. That's just this generation of guys.\n\nMike Mulholland | MLive.com\n\nLooking back on Pistons career\n\nBC: When you think about your years with the Pistons, what comes to mind.\n\nCB: Some of the best years of my life were lived in Detroit. Some of the best relationships that I've built started and evolved in Detroit. One of the best actual days, winning the championship, happened in Detroit. I've always had this amazing affinity for the city and for the fans, and its reciprocated.\n\nI just believe in blue collar, rolling up your sleeves and going to work. Not worrying about the glitz and the glamour and just getting the job done. And that’s what the city’s all about. That’s what I’m all about and that’s why they embraced us in my opinion. I just love everything about the city, the fans and the people. I really do.\n\nMike Mulholland | MLive.com\n\nBig Ben, Sheed, Tayshaun and Rip\n\nBC: You still keep in touch with Tayshaun, Big Ben, Rip and the rest of the guys?\n\nCB: All the time, man. We're in a group chat. We speak in our chat at least every couple weeks. Talking about life, basketball, the games. How everybody's families are doing, when we're getting together. We're all brothers, man. We literally are brothers.\n\nMike Mulholland\n\nReturn to Detroit\n\nBC: What kind of reception are you expecting Friday night?\n\nCB: I'm sure its going to be great. There's no reason it shouldn't be. I'm hoping a lot of people show up because it's going to be a lot of fun. I think the people in Detroit who love the physical style of basketball will appreciate it, so I'm expecting it to be an awesome time.\n\nMike Mulholland | MLive.com\n\nChauncey Billups, the basketball \"hero\"\n\nBC: Ice Cube and Clyde Drexler both called you a hero in basketball and the BIG3. What's your reaction to that?\n\nCB: Those two dudes, I look up to both of them. I'm humbled for them to think that way of me. I always was a west coast rap fan, so Cube is one of the greatest off all time in my opinion, so I've always been a fan. But getting to know him, the dude is a savant. He's intelligent, he works extremely hard. You can see why he's been successful. He will remain that successful because of his work ethic. It's been a blessing getting to know him.\n\nAnd Clyde is obviously one of the greatest players of all time. One of the classier guys of all time, paving the way for guys like myself who believe in class and grace in the game of basketball, so that’s awesome."
