Halderson passed away in October and was honored throughout the Buffs’ 2023-24 season.\n\nHere’s how Buff Nation reacted to Chauncey’s call to the Hall:\n\nColorado football congratulates Chauncey\n\nProud Alumni C Club\n\nZach Ruebesam's favorite player\n\nMr. Big Shot is headed to Springfield\n\nDenver mayor Mike Johnston congratulates the King of Park Hill\n\nColorado's greatest\n\nColorado governor Jared Polis tweets out\n\nBasketball legend\n\nProud Darrin Chiaverini\n\nCU president Todd Saliman chimes in"
