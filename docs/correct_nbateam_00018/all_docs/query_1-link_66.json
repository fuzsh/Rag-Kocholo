        "text": "BROOKLYN, Mich. – Ben Wallace thinks the Detroit Pistons’ new coach is a good fit for the team.\n\n“I like the hire with Dwane Casey,” the former Pistons forward said Sunday at Michigan International Speedway. “I know Dwane Casey personally. I thought he was able to energize and build that Toronto team.\n\n“I think he’s definitely going to help the Pistons.”\n\nWallace, who was at MIS as honorary pace car driver for the Consumers Energy 400, also endorsed Chauncey Billups as a potential administrator for an NBA team – perhaps even the Pistons.\n\n“I would love to see Chauncey head operations with the Pistons,” Wallace said. “As a leader who won a championship here, I think the city itself would like to see Chauncey here getting it done in the front office.\n\n“As a teammate, I know he’s more than capable.”\n\nWallace and Billups were teammates on the Pistons’ 2004 NBA championship team that included Rasheed Wallace.\n\n“I’ve been in the locker room with him,” Wallace said of the former point guard. “I’ve been in the trenches with him.\n\n“He was able to keep me and Rasheed in line, so I know he can run a front office.”\n\nWallace, a four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is part owner of the Grand Rapids Drive, the Pistons’ affiliate in the G League. He played nine seasons with Detroit.\n\nCasey was fired by Toronto after the Raptors were knocked out of the playoffs last spring."
