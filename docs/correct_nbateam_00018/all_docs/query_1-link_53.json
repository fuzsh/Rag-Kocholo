        "text": "Vince Carter wowed the basketball world with his high-flying dunks for more than two decades. Chauncey Billups was a clutch guard and NBA Finals MVP for the Detroit Pistons.\n\nTwo icons from the 2000s era of basketball are headed to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 13-member class inducted Saturday includes former Lakers, Grizzlies and Warriors executive Jerry West, who was already inducted as a player and as a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team. Also in the class: players Seimone Augustus, Michael Cooper, Walter Davis, Dick Barnett and Michele Timms, coaches Charles Smith, Harley Redin and Bo Ryan, broadcaster/coach Doug Collins and owner Herb Simon.\n\nThe 2024 class will be enshrined into the Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, in August.\n\nCarter, 47, was an eight-time All-Star and the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1999 with the Toronto Raptors. He had the longest career in NBA history, playing 22 seasons for the Raptors, Nets, Mavericks, Grizzlies, Hawks, Magic, Kings and Suns, and finished with 25,728 career points, good for 21st in league history.\n\nHe played in college at North Carolina under coach Dean Smith.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 guard's longevity in the game was legendary, and he was a useful player deep into his 40s, hanging with players less than half his age. He averaged five points over 60 games at age 43 with the Hawks in his final season.\n\nBillups, 47, was a five-time All-Star and won an NBA championship with the Pistons in 2004. He was also the MVP of the Finals that season and is now the coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nBillups was the third overall pick in the 1997 draft by the Boston Celtics, but his pro career was a little slow to develop. He eventually found a home in Detroit, making his first All-Star team in his ninth season.\n\nPart of a balanced Pistons team that included Richard Hamilton, Rasheed Wallace, Tayshaun Prince and Ben Wallace, Billups averaged 21 points and 5.2 assists per game in the 2004 Finals. They beat the Lakers in five games for the title.\n\nThe 85-year-old West was inducted as a contributor. The 14-time All-Star was inducted as a player in 1980. He spent more than 20 years as an executive for the Lakers — helping the franchise win eight championships over a span from 1980 to 2002 — and was also the general manager for the Memphis Grizzlies and an executive with the Warriors.\n\nAugustus, 39, was a four-time WNBA champion with the Minnesota Lynx. The 6-foot-0 guard played in college at LSU, helping the program to three Final Fours. She's 13th in WNBA history with 6,005 career points."
