        "text": "Deni Avdija continues to acclimate to life as a basketball player in Portland. After being introduced last week as the newest player for the Blazers, he arrived Sunday in Las Vegas to watch the team play a summer league game, and on the way he was interviewed on the team's official website.\n\n\"I'm a late-developing player,\" Avdija said. \"When I arrived in the NBA, I focused mainly on the defensive side and the offensive development came later. Over time, I gained experience and my teammates and the coaches began to believe in me and trust me more - which allowed me to stand out. I hope it will be the same in Portland. I experienced ups and downs during my time in the league, but in the last season I showed what I know.\"\n\nHe also added about himself: \"I am a player who can help the team win. I can do whatever is needed.\" About his new coach, former player Chauncey Billups, he said: \"I am very excited to play under him. He is an excellent coach and was a great player. I hope I can learn from him.\" On his new friends on the team: \"I met some of them today. I think we'll have a fun team to watch. We're a young and good team, and I think that's all that's needed for good basketball.\"\n\nAvdija again referred to the announcement of the move from Washington to the Blazers, which caught him by surprise: \"On the night of the draft, I went to bed and asked my father to wake me up if something unusual happened - and then it happened. It was a very big surprise, and not in good taste, but when I think about it I get a chance to play in the Western Conference, and that's nice, in every team I play I'll try to be the best player I can be.\"\n\n\"I spent four years in Washington and it was a beautiful journey. Now I'm coming to a new place and hope to show what I know and help the team. I'm very excited to start my new path in Portland.\""
