DETROIT – Chauncey Billups, point guard and Finals MVP for the Detroit Pistons’ 2004 NBA Championship team, has been elected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2024. The announcement was made earlier today during an event held by the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Glendale, AZ. Billups becomes the second player from the 2004 championship team elected to the hall of fame and will be enshrined at the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, MA, on August 16-17, 2024.

“Chauncey is the ultimate leader and connector – not only in the way he played, but how he’s continued

contributing to the game as a broadcaster and now as a head coach,” Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said in a release. “He made his mark in Detroit, and it’s hard to overstate what he means to our franchise and our community. His selflessness, poise and ability to step up in big moments helped define Pistons basketball for a generation. Chauncey is the latest in a long line of Pistons greats to enter the Hall of Fame. His legacy, including this well-deserved recognition, serve as inspiration for our younger players and a shining example of the rich tradition celebrated by our franchise.”

Drafted third overall by the Boston Celtics in the 1997 NBA Draft, Billups went on to play 1,043 career NBA games over 17 seasons with Boston, Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, Detroit, New York and the Los Angeles Clippers. Billups signed with Detroit in free agency in 2002 and played seven seasons with Detroit from 2002 to 2008 before returning to play his final NBA season — and eighth with the Pistons — in 2013. Billups was named to five consecutive NBA All-Star teams (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010), including three straight while playing for Detroit (2006-08). Billups was an All-NBA Second Team selection once (2006), All-NBA Third Team selection twice (2007 and 2009) and an All-Defensive Second Team selection twice (2005 and 2006). He was also named the recipient of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship award in 2008, the Joe Dumars Sportsmanship Award in 2009 and the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year in the 2013.

During his first stint with Detroit (2002-08), the Pistons made the playoffs in all seven years, winning Eastern Conference Championships in 2004 and 2005 and the NBA Championship in 2004. Billups posted a (.676) winning percentage in a Pistons uniform, which is the highest win percentage by a player in franchise history (Min. 300 games), and his 2,984 assists rank fourth in franchise history. In 482 games with Detroit, Billups averaged 16.5 points, 6.2 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 33.8 minutes per game.

Billups, a native of Denver, Colo., averaged 15.2 points, 5.4 assists and 2.9 rebounds in 1,043 career games (937 starts) in the NBA. Billups is one of only eight players in NBA history to record at least 15,000 points, 5,500 assists and 1,800 threes (Bryant, Curry, Harden, James, Kidd, Lowry, Lillard). His No. 1 jersey was retired by the Pistons in 2016. Prior to being drafted, Billups was named Second-Team All American and First-Team All-Big 12 in 1997 for the University of Colorado, where he played two seasons (1995-97)

WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING:

Former Detroit Pistons Player, President of Basketball Operations and Hall of Famer Joe Dumars

“We don’t win a third NBA Championship without Chauncey’s leadership. When the ball was in his hands, you just knew he was going to make the right play. His skillset and accomplishments on the court, his competitiveness and his sportsmanship validate this well-deserved honor.”

Former Pistons Head Coach and Hall of Famer Larry Brown

“Seeing Chauncey elected to the Hall of Fame is so neat for me because his talent and leadership qualities are being rewarded at the highest level. Chauncey impacted the game every single time he stepped on the basketball court and truly refined his skills throughout the course of his career. He was an unselfish facilitator, tremendous scorer, willing defender and delivered in clutch moments. It was a joy to coach him, and he taught me as much as I hope I was able to teach him. His basketball story is a great example for all players in the way he overcame adversity early in his NBA career and ascended to an NBA All-Star, NBA Finals MVP and now a Hall of Famer.
