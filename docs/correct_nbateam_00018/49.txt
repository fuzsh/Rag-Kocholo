DETROIT (97.1 The Ticket) -- Chauncey "Mr. Big Shot" Billups' return to the Detroit Pistons officially came to an end Monday, with the team declining to pick up the veteran point guard's team option for the coming season.

According to Pistons official beat writer Keith Langlois, Pistons president and head coach Stan Van Gundy has decided to part ways with the one-time NBA Finals MVP, while dealing with a logjam at the backup point guard position which includes Will Bynum, Peyton Siva and rookie Spencer Dinwiddie.

Billups made his way back to the Pistons last summer -- signing a two-year, $5 million contract -- after he was traded from the team in 2008 for Allen Iverson.

Billups played in just 19 games -- starting seven -- in the 2013-14 campaign and averaged 3.8 points and 2.2 assists. Billups had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in February and missed the remainder of the season.

Billups has expressed interest in moving up to the front office of an NBA team after his playing career ends.
