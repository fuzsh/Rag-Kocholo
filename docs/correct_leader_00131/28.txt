KYIV, 3 June 2019 - The Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office in Ukraine and in the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG), Ambassador Martin Sajdik, today made the following statement:

“I sincerely welcome the appointment of the Second President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma as the Head of the Ukrainian delegation in the Trilateral Contact Group.

Leonid Kuchma is well familiar with the activities of the TCG and its working groups due to his former work in the same function. I am deeply convinced that the appointment of this wise politician, who is devoted to his country, will provide new impetus to our efforts in seeking a solution to the conflict in the east of Ukraine.

In the past, I could repeatedly convince myself of the profound commitment of Leonid Kuchma to the Minsk Agreements and to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

I am looking forward to personally welcome Leonid Kuchma at the next meeting of the TCG and its working groups in Minsk on 5 June.”
