        "text": "II. POLITICAL BACKGROUND\n\nThe appearance of temniki followed two years of political scandals involving President Leonid Kuchma and coincided with a precipitous decline in the president's public approval rating as well as with his introduction of new measures to address ongoing battles with the opposition. In 1999 Kuchma won reelection for a second five-year term with more than 56 percent of the vote.3 Soon after the presidential elections, Kuchma initiated efforts to consolidate his power and exert executive control over the Verkhovna Rada, ostensibly to end the deadlocks between the presidency and the parliament that had plagued the passage of legislation. Kuchma complained that the Rada had wrecked his attempts to secure market reforms and was responsible for prolonging the country's eight-year economic stagnation.4 In January 2000, Kuchma initiated a controversial referendum on constitutional amendments designed to reduce the Rada's powers in favor of increased authority for the president.5 Although between 80 and 90 percent of the electorate supported all of Kuchma's proposed changes, with more than 80 percent voter turnout, the Rada failed to ratify amendments that would have significantly reduced its own weight.\n\nTensions between the executive and legislative branches continued, with the president's credibility coming under severe attack in November 2000, when Socialist Party of Ukraine leader Oleksandr Moroz revealed the existence of secret tape recordings of conversations involving Kuchma and top political and financial figures made by former presidential security guard Mykola Melnychenko. The tapes implicate Kuchma and other prominent officials in numerous scandals, including the kidnapping and murder of investigative journalist Heorhii Gongadze in September 2000.6 Gongadze had been investigating corruption and was a vocal critic of President Kuchma's January referendum and the government's efforts to restrict press freedoms. The Melnychenko tapes also record Kuchma's authorization of the sale of sophisticated military radar systems to Iraq in violation of a United Nations arms embargo.\n\nThe scandal, dubbed \"Kuchmagate,\" and growing public concerns about corruption, worsening poverty, and unemployment inspired the development, in late 2000, of the \"Ukraine without Kuchma\" protest movement.7 In February and March 2001, students, pensioners, politicians, and others organized rallies throughout the country. Some of these demonstrations ended in violence and the arrest of hundreds of protesters. Sensing this growing antipathy and risk to his government, on March 6, 2001, President Kuchma demanded that all government officials \"sever publicly any links to the opposition within the week or submit their resignations.\"8\n\nIn this period President Kuchma also began removing key reform-minded figures from the government. In January 2001, Kuchma dismissed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Energy Yulia Tymoshenko, after the Office of the Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against her on charges of fraud and embezzlement during her leadership of Unified Energy Systems of Ukraine from 1995-1997.9 She had served as deputy prime minister for just over a year, and became an outspoken critic of the president soon after her removal from office. Analysts believe that the criminal case and subsequent dismissal are linked to Tymoshenko's efforts to reform the energy sector. Her reforms began to jeopardize the interests of the nation's oil and gas oligarchs, many of whom are closely associated with Kuchma and who have enjoyed growing political and economic power during Kuchma's second term.10 The businessmen most adversely affected by Tymoshenko's reforms were those connected to the pro-presidential SDPU(u), which controls the majority of district energy distributors.11 Tymoshenko was arrested and jailed for six weeks before a district court ruled that the charges against her were unfounded. In April 2002, a district court closed all proceedings against Tymoshenko, but in August 2002 the newly appointed prosecutor general, Sviatoslav Piskun, initiated a new criminal case against her on the same charges and in September 2002 opened yet another case against her for illegally calling for the ousting of President Kuchma.\n\nThree months after the dismissal of Tymoshenko, popular reformist Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko also came under attack. Despite Yushchenko's success in carrying out reforms, important industrial and financial figures believed many of Yushchenko's policies interfered with lucrative business arrangements. Communist Party deputies formed an alliance with the SDPU(u) and other pro-Kuchma parties representing the interests of leaders of some of Ukraine's most powerful business conglomerates to oust the Yushchenko government in a vote of no confidence in April 2001.12 During his sixteenth-month tenure as prime minister, Western analysts credited Yushchenko with curbing inflation, meeting domestic and international debt commitments, paying pension arrears, and overseeing the first period of real economic growth in Ukraine in more than a decade.13 The Rada replaced Yushchenko with Kuchma's proposed candidate, Anatolii Kinakh.\n\nIn the months following these changes, the Rada and the president fought over the passage of a new election law. Controversy would mar the March 2002 parliamentary elections throughout, with reports of illegal interference by public authorities, abuse of administrative resources, instances of violence, and intimidation of reporters and media outlets.14 Despite manipulation by the authorities, the pro-presidential bloc \"For a United Ukraine\" garnered 11.8 percent of the votes gained on party ballots, which account for half of the parliament's seats. Two opposition parties proved to be more popular in the party balloting; the \"Our Ukraine\" coalition led by Viktor Yushchenko won 23.57 percent, while the Communist Party of Ukraine secured 20 percent. Only three other parties surpassed the 6 percent minimum for winning seats: the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (7.26 percent), the Socialist Party of Ukraine (6.87 percent) and the SDPU(u) (6.27 percent).15 In the final composition of the Verkhovna Rada, however, \"For a United Ukraine\" held the greatest total number of seats, having won heavily in the election of individual pro-presidential candidates in local constituencies voting, which accounts for the other half of the parliament's seats.16\n\nThus, the opposition parties' popular electoral success did not translate into a strong position in parliament. In May 2002 the \"For a United Ukraine\" bloc and the SDPU(u) cooperated to secure the Rada chairman and deputy chairman positions. Two key appointments came soon thereafter: Kuchma named SDPU(u) Chairman Viktor Medvedchuk as head of the Presidential Administration in June 2002 and one month later won parliamentary approval of his candidate for prosecutor general, Sviatoslav Piskun. Beginning in this period, pro-presidential parties began to persuade many independent deputies and deputies from other parties and factions to join their ranks.17 A pro-presidential majority is important for Kuchma in order to facilitate passage of his proposed legislation and to stave off impeachment.18\n\nAlthough Kuchma managed to consolidate his position in parliament and in key executive agencies, during the summer his popularity continued to suffer in the face of ongoing scandals and unresolved social and economic issues. According to a September 2002 poll, just 5.9 percent of Ukrainians expressed complete support for Kuchma and nearly 72 percent supported his resignation.19 In September and October 2002, opposition parties-the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and \"Our Ukraine\"-staged anti-Kuchma protests around the country.20 The largest of these \"Rise Up Ukraine\" protests, held on September 16 in the capital, Kyiv, drew more than 20,000 participants.\n\nThe Ukrainian government went to great lengths to frustrate the opposition's actions by banning the protests from Kyiv's center and demanding that they be held in a stadium on the distant edge of the city.21 Schedules for Kyiv-bound buses and commuter trains were changed inexplicably for September 16, and traffic police denied cars and buses with non-Kyiv license plates entrance to the capital. As a result, thousands of people did not enter the city that day, irrespective of whether they intended to participate in the demonstrations. In the days prior to the demonstration, the police harassed students and members of opposition parties. The government also initiated an aggressive media campaign designed to dissuade people from participating and to obscure the scale of the protests and demands of the protesters.22 In addition, for no clear reason, currency exchange offices in many areas of the capital were closed in the days before and on the day of the Kyiv demonstration. The morning after the protest, police violently broke up the demonstrators' tent camp and arrested several dozen participants.\n\nIn the months following the demonstrations, opposition and pro-presidential forces in the Rada jockeyed for position and neither was able to form a stable majority. In response to parliamentary impasses, in November Kuchma dismissed Kinakh and appointed Donetsk Governor Viktor Yanukovych as prime minister, who was able to organize a majority in the Rada by mid-December.23 The impact of the Kuchmagate scandal on the president intensified in October 2002, after United States experts authenticated the Melnychenko tapes and the U.S. government took steps to isolate Kuchma over his approval of the Iraqi arms deal.24 Soon thereafter, Kyiv Appeals Court Judge Yurii Vasylenko opened a criminal investigation against Kuchma in connection with these and other charges, but in December the Supreme Court rescinded the orders for an investigation. In February 2003, the Supreme Council of Justice recommended that the Verkhovna Rada dismiss Vasylenko on charges that in initiating the criminal case against Kuchma, the judge violated the constitution.25\n\n3 Central Election Commission of Ukraine, \"Unified All-State Single-Mandate Election Constituency: Elections Result,\" November 14, 1999 [online], http://195.230.157.53/pls/vp1/webproc0e (retrieved November 19, 2002).\n\n4 In contrast to all other countries of the former Soviet Union, Ukraine did not report single year of growth between 1992 and 1999. GDP declined some 53 percent from 1989 to 1998. Privatization and deregulation proceeded very slowly.

The president would have had the authority to appoint members of the second chamber, which is intended to represent the interests of Ukraine's provinces. Ukrainian human rights groups and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe deemed Kuchma's proposal a threat to the rule of law and certain to disrupt the balance of powers enshrined in the constitution.

In 1997, Kuchma ousted his former protégé, Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, whose fortunes are linked to UESU. The prosecutor general initiated criminal proceedings against Lazarenko on charges of embezzlement and providing illegal political concessions to UESU. In the 1998 parliamentary elections, much of the widespread violence was believed to be associated with the ongoing rivalry between Lazarenko and Kuchma, including five bomb explosions in the headquarters of Lazarenko's opposition newspaper, Vseukrainskie Vedomosti [All-Ukrainian Gazette]. \"Constitutional Watch: Ukraine,\" East European Constitutional Review, vol. 7, no.2 (Spring 1998) [online],\n\nhttp://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/constitutionwatch/ukraine.html (retrieved December 20, 2002).

Since 1998, opposition parties have made numerous unsuccessful attempts to force a parliamentary vote on impeaching President Kuchma. For example, in 1998, opposition parties successfully brought the motion for impeachment into the agenda, but ultimately no vote was held. \"Constitutional Watch: Ukraine,\" East European Constitutional Review, vol. 7, no.1 (Winter 1998) [online], http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num1/constitutionwatch/ukraine.html (retrieved December 31, 2002). In June 2002, the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc proposed a motion for impeachment, but the item did not receive sufficient votes to be tabled in debates. \"Constitutional Watch: Ukraine,\" East European Constitutional Review, vol. 11, no. 3 (Summer 2002) [online], http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol11num3/constitutionwatch/ukraine.html (retrieved December 31, 2002).

However, his relationship to other opposition parties became much less ambiguous in late 2002, beginning with the September protests and culminating in Kuchma's December legislative victories (see note 23) after which Yushchenko called for new elections and a nationwide strike.
