        "text": "A former bodyguard of the ex-Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has been arrested.\n\nMykola Melnychenko was detained at Kiev airport after arriving from New York.\n\nMr Melnychenko claimed to have secretly recorded conversations implicating his boss in the notorious murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze more than 10 years ago.\n\nHe has been wanted by the Ukrainian authorities on charges of revealing state secrets since September 2011.\n\nMr Melnychenko says he also has recordings incriminating other top figures in Ukraine. His return comes just days before parliamentary elections in the country.\n\nGongadze, a critic of Mr Kuchma, was abducted in September 2000 and his headless body was found months later in a forest near the capital.\n\nThe Gongadze affair sparked massive street protests against Mr Kuchma's government."
