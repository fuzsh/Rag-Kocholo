His presidency marked a period of political transformation and a push toward European integration, with his tenure being inaugurated by the Orange Revolution, a series of widespread protests against election fraud and corruption that resulted in Yushchenko being named the rightful winner of Ukraine’s 2004 presidential election.\n\nAs Ukraine's counteroffensive campaign struggles to dislodge Russian forces, the country’s future remains full of uncertainties. What impact will Russia’s ongoing invasion have on Ukraine’s political trajectory? What role should international organizations and the West play in supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and democratic evolution moving forward? Join the Council and President Yushchenko for a conversation about the past, present, and future of Ukrainian democracy."
