        "text": "Viktor Yanukovych has the rare distinction of having been ousted twice from Ukraine's presidency after giant street protests.\n\nOpponents accuse him of having enriched himself, his family and cronies while in power.\n\nA protest against his decision to abandon a far-reaching European Union partnership deal in November 2013 morphed into a huge - and violent - campaign to push him from power.\n\nBut it was the deaths of at least 88 people, many of them protesters shot dead by uniformed snipers in 48 hours of bloodshed, that ultimately brought him down.\n\nThe killings sent shockwaves around the world.\n\nUnder EU pressure he signed a deal to transfer powers to parliament and hold early elections. But within hours he had fled the capital and his administration had crumbled.\n\nAs Ukraine's protest leaders and opposition moved to fill the power vacuum, Mr Yanukovych, 63, maintained he was still the lawfully elected president.\n\nAs he headed for neighbouring Russia, Kiev's new rulers issued an arrest warrant for his role in the \"mass murder of innocent civilians\".\n\n\"I came from a very poor family and my main dream in life was to break out of this poverty,\" he once told journalists.\n\nBeginning his career as a transport executive in the Soviet Union's key coal-mining industry in eastern Ukraine, he became a Doctor of Economics - the equivalent of a PhD - in 2000.\n\nHe became governor of the Donetsk region, home to more than three million people and the economic powerhouse of Ukraine, less than a year after entering the local administration.\n\nThe then President, Leonid Kuchma, appointed him prime minister in November 2002, in a government accused of corruption and economic mismanagement.\n\nAs the outgoing leader's protege, he went on to win the 2004 presidential vote. But, after huge protests in Kiev that became known as the Orange Revolution, the election was declared fraudulent and his reputation badly dented.\n\nHe rebuilt his political career while the victors of 2004, Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko, fell into constant conflict.\n\nHe served a second term as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 and became Ukraine's most popular politician.\n\nThe 2010 presidential election he won cleanly - according to international observers - defeating arch-rival Ms Tymoshenko.\n\nThe following year, she was jailed for seven years on charges of abusing her power, in a trial she insisted was politically motivated,\n\nDuring his presidency, Mr Yanukovych steered Ukraine towards a closer relationship with the EU.\n\nBut then, days before it was due to be signed, he rejected an association agreement in November 2013,\n\nStreet protests, the biggest since the 2004 Orange Revolution, erupted and continued for months, reaching a bloody climax between 18-22 February.\n\nWith the ousted president on the run, Ms Tymoshenko was freed.\n\nBack in 2004, Mr Yanukovych had openly been supported by Russia's President Vladimir Putin, but relations became strained, not least because of a dispute about the cost of Russian gas.\n\nMr Yanukovych tried hard to shed the image of being \"Moscow's man\" and when he became president he pointedly made his first foreign trip as president to Brussels, rather than Moscow.\n\nBut, with Ukraine's finances in a parlous state, he argued that free trade ties with the EU would jeopardise Ukraine's existing trade with Russia. The EU refused his demand for substantial compensation.\n\nRussia had already started tightening the economic screws with various measures, including a ban on imported Ukrainian sweets.\n\nBillionaire oligarch Rinat Akhmetov, a powerful industrialist and owner of Shakhtar Donetsk football club, was a political ally of Mr Yanukovych until the explosion of violence in Kiev. Energy tycoon Dmytro Firtash has also been a powerful voice in Ukraine's economic policy circles.\n\nAnd during his time in office, Mr Yanukovych's two sons were influential - businessman Olexander and Viktor Yanukovych Junior, an MP.\n\nWith his presidency ending in ignominy and his entourage apparently deserting him, it was sons who went with him as he fled. And it was to Russia that he looked for sanctuary.\n\nAt his first news conference after leaving Ukraine, given in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, he spoke against any military intervention or future division of his country.\n\nHe made clear he had fled Kiev in fear of life and would not return without guarantees of safety for himself and his family."
