I am deeply convinced that the appointment of this wise politician, who is devoted to his country, will provide new impetus to our efforts in seeking a solution to the conflict in the east of Ukraine.\n\nIn the past, I could repeatedly convince myself of the profound commitment of Leonid Kuchma to the Minsk Agreements and to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nI am looking forward to personally welcome Leonid Kuchma at the next meeting of the TCG and its working groups in Minsk on 5 June.”"
