        "text": "President Viktor Yushchenko sacked his government on Thursday as the team that led the Orange Revolution less than a year ago broke apart amid infighting and accusations of mass graft.\n\nYushchenko, who had promised to stamp out the widespread corruption under his long-serving predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, told a news conference he would ask regional governor Yury Yekhanurov to form a new team.\n\nYushchenko said that by sacking Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's cabinet he wanted to give a fresh start to an administration swept to power in mass protests last year only to fail to meet supporters' heady expectations.\n\nBut the move could set the stage for a standoff between Yushchenko and the charismatic Tymoshenko, a key figure in the revolution who heads her own party, when Ukraine votes in a parliamentary election in March 2006.\n\n\"These people remain my friends. It is very difficult but today I must remove this Gordian knot,\" Yushchenko said, accusing his outgoing government of lacking team spirit.\n\n\"I set one task for the new team — to work in a united team. I do not want any more the intrigues between two or three people that were determining the state policy.\"\n\nSome analysts said they hoped Yekhanurov, a low-key technocrat and Yushchenko loyalist, would bring discipline to Ukraine's economic policy, which under Tymoshenko was characterized by public rows and inconsistency.\n\nA crisis ended\n\nIn sacking Tymoshenko, whose fiery oratory brought thousands out on the streets in last December's pro-Western \"Orange Revolution\" , Yushchenko moved decisively to end a crisis that has threatened his credibility.\n\nThe crisis follows months of tension between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko over Ukraine's economic direction and came to a head last Saturday when his chief of staff quit alleging deep corruption in the administration.\n\n\"We need to halt the disappointment in society and make sure that the ideals (of the Orange Revolution) are not cast into doubt,\" he said.\n\nThe United States played down a political crisis in Ukraine after the sacking of the government but said it was vital he speed up the pace of reforms.\n\n\"They will name a new government, they'll have elections next year and I think we just have to keep our eyes focused on the long term and not look at short-term adjustments,\" State Department official Kurt Volker said in Brussels.\n\nUkraine's neighbors Russia and Poland each said the government's sacking should not be over-dramatized.\n\n\"I am convinced that the changes do not represent a reversal of the process ... that began with the Orange Revolution,\" said Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a Yushchenko ally.\n\nDiscrepancy between goals and reality\n\nHowever, opponents said the crisis highlighted the gap between the ideals of the revolution and the government's performance in implementing them.\n\nA steady drip of sleaze allegations — unproven but damaging — led some to believe the new administration was as corrupt as the one it replaced.\n\nThe graft claims even extended to Yushchenko's son who, a newspaper said, was driving a car he should not have been able to afford on his modest income.\n\nAt the same time, economic growth took a sharp downturn and inflation rose while the government's stewardship of the economy was erratic.\n\nAnalysts predict next year's parliamentary election will be hotly contested.\n\nNew parliament to choose government\n\nFollowing changes to the constitution, the new parliament, not the president, will choose the government.\n\n\"Sacking Tymoshenko ... sets things up for a clash between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko in the March 2006 parliamentary elections, which will split the reform camp,\" said Tim Ash, emerging markets analyst at Bear Stearns in London.\n\nThe sacked prime minister was due to make her first public comments on Ukrainian television on Friday.\n\nUkraine's acting prime minister Yekhanurov had in recent months publicly chided Tymoshenko for what he said was her poor management of the economy.\n\nHe was deputy to Yushchenko while the latter was prime minister in 2000. After the \"Orange Revolution\" he had been governor of the industrial Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nHe must be confirmed by parliament, where pro-Yushchenko forces do not have a stable parliamentary majority. Yekhanurov was meeting members of the old cabinet on Thursday evening."
