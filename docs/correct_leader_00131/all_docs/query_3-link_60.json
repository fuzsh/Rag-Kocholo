        "text": "Russia has massed troops near Ukraine, and the West has threatened economic sanctions if it launches an invasion. Moscow denies planning an invasion but has demanded sweeping Western security guarantees in a tense standoff.\n\nHere is a timeline of the main events in Ukraine’s political history since it won independence from Moscow in 1991.\n\n1991\n\nLeonid Kravchuk, leader of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, declares independence from Moscow. In a referendum and presidential election, Ukrainians approve independence and elect Kravchuk as president.\n\n1994\n\nKravchuk loses a presidential election to Leonid Kuchma, also a former communist, in elections deemed largely free and fair by observers.\n\n1999\n\nKuchma is re-elected in 1999 in a vote riddled with irregularities.\n\n2004\n\nPro-Russian candidate Viktor Yanukovich is declared president but allegations of vote-rigging trigger protests in what becomes known as the Orange Revolution, forcing a rerun of the vote. A pro-Western former prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, is elected president.\n\n2005\n\nYushchenko takes power with promises to lead Ukraine out of the Kremlin’s orbit, towards NATO and the European Union. He appoints former energy company boss Yulia Tymoshenko as prime minister but, after infighting in Ukraine’s pro-Western camp, she is sacked.\n\n2008\n\nNATO promises Ukraine it will one day join the alliance.\n\n2010\n\nYanukovich defeats Tymoshenko in a presidential election. Russia and Ukraine clinch a gas pricing deal in exchange for the extension of the lease for the Russian navy in a Ukrainian Black Sea port.\n\n2013\n\nYanukovich’s government suspends trade and association talks with the EU in November and opts to revive economic ties with Moscow, triggering months of mass rallies in Kyiv.\n\n2014\n\nThe protests, largely focused around Kyiv’s Maidan square, turn violent. Dozens of protesters are killed.\n\nIn February, parliament votes to remove Yanukovich, who flees. Within days, armed men seize the parliament of the Ukrainian region of Crimea and raise the Russian flag.\n\nMoscow annexes the territory after a March 16 referendum which shows overwhelming support in Crimea for joining the Russian Federation.\n\nIn April, pro-Russian separatists in the eastern region of Donbas declare independence. Fighting breaks out and has continued sporadically, despite frequent ceasefires, into 2022.\n\nIn May, businessman Petro Poroshenko wins a presidential election with a pro-Western agenda.\n\nIn July, a missile brings down passenger plane MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killing all 298 people on board. The weapon used is traced back by investigators to Russia, which denies involvement.\n\n2017\n\nAn association agreement between Ukraine and the EU is passed, opening markets for free trade of goods and services, and visa-free travel to the EU for Ukrainians.\n\n2019\n\nA new Ukrainian Orthodox church wins formal recognition, angering the Kremlin.\n\nFormer actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy defeats Poroshenko in an April presidential election, promising to tackle corruption and end the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine. His Servant of the People party wins a July parliamentary election.\n\nThen-US President Donald Trump asks Zelenskyy in July to investigate Joe Biden, then his rival in the US presidential race, and Biden’s son Hunter Biden over possible business dealings in Ukraine. The call eventually leads to a failed attempt to impeach Trump.\n\nMarch 2020\n\nUkraine goes into its first lockdown to curb COVID-19.\n\nJune 2020\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) approves a $5bn lifeline to help Ukraine stave off default during a pandemic-induced recession.\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nZelenskyy appeals to Biden, who is now US president, for Ukraine to join NATO.\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nZelenskyy’s government imposes sanctions on Viktor Medvedchuk, an opposition leader and the Kremlin’s most prominent ally in Ukraine.\n\nSpring 2021\n\nRussia masses troops near Ukraine’s borders. They are partly dispersed after what Russia says was a training exercise.\n\nOctober 2021\n\nUkraine uses a Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drone for the first time in eastern Ukraine, angering Russia.\n\nAutumn 2021\n\nRussia again begins massing troops near Ukraine.\n\nDecember 7, 2021\n\nBiden warns Russia of sweeping Western economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine.\n\nDecember 17, 2021\n\nRussia presents detailed security demands including a legally binding guarantee that NATO will give up any military activity in eastern Europe and Ukraine.\n\nJanuary 10, 2022\n\nUS and Russian diplomats fail to narrow differences on Ukraine, and subsequent talks also bring no major breakthrough.\n\nJanuary 14, 2022\n\nA cyberattack warning Ukrainians to “be afraid and expect the worst” hits Ukrainian government websites.\n\nJanuary 17, 2022\n\nPoroshenko returns to Ukraine to face charges in a treason case. Russian forces start arriving in Belarus, to the north of Ukraine, for joint drills.\n\nJanuary 24, 2022\n\nNATO puts forces on standby and reinforces eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets. Some Western nations start evacuating non-essential embassy staff from Kyiv.\n\nJanuary 26, 2022\n\nWashington presents a written response to Russia’s security demands, repeating a commitment to NATO’s “open-door” policy while offering a “principled and pragmatic evaluation” of Moscow’s concerns.\n\nJanuary 28, 2022\n\nPutin says Russia’s main security demands have not been addressed but that Moscow is ready to keep talking."
