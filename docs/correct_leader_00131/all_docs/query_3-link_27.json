        "text": "Leonid Kravchuk (born January 10, 1934, Żytyń Wielki, Poland [now Velykyi Zhytyn, Ukraine]—died May 10, 2022) was the president of Ukraine from 1991 to 1994. For 30 years a Communist Party functionary, he converted to nationalist politics after the collapse of the Soviet regime. He was the first democratically elected president of Ukraine.\n\nIn 1958 Kravchuk graduated from the Kiev T.H. Shevchenko State University and joined the Communist Party. He taught political economics in Chernivtsi and began a political career, rising in the 1980s to top posts in the propaganda and ideology departments for Ukraine. He became chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet in July 1990, and as such he soon became the effective leader of the republic. As the central government in Moscow grew weaker, Kravchuk began to warm to the Ukrainian independence movement. After the failure of the coup attempt by Soviet Communist hardliners in August 1991, he expressed unqualified support for independence. He was elected president in December 1991 but lost reelection to Leonid Kuchma in July 1994."
