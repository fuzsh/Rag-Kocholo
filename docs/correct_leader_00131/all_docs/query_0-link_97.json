        "text": "Ukraine's former President Leonid Kuchma has denied any involvement in the murder of investigative journalist Georgiy Gongadze in 2000.\n\nMr Kuchma said he was ready to go \"through hell\" to prove his innocence.\n\nHe was speaking after arriving for questioning at the prosecutors' office in Kiev, a day after a criminal case was opened against him.\n\nMr Gongadze, a critic of Mr Kuchma, was abducted in September 2000. His headless body was found months later.\n\nThe Gongadze affair sparked massive street protests against Mr Kuchma's government at the time.\n\n\"For 10 years I've lived under severe pressure. But today I am morally ready to go through all the torments of hell so everybody knows what I've done and what I haven't done.\"\n\nHe also reiterated his belief that the Gongadze affair was a \"horrible provocation against Ukraine and its president\".\n\nOn Monday, prosecutors said Mr Kuchma, who served as president from 1994 to 2005, was suspected of abuse of power and giving illegal orders to the interior ministry which led to the killing of the reporter.\n\nThe prosecutors also said the former president was now banned from leaving the country."
