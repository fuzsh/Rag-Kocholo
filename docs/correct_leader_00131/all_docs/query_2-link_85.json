This simple question is not so simple to answer,\n\nand it is impossible to answer with a 'yes' or 'no'. The short answer is\n\nthat Ukraine is a new and flawed democracy: limited in scope and legitimacy,\n\noligarchic, unhealthy and now under strain.\n\nBut it is a democracy with long-term promise, and the promise stems from the\n\nfact that Ukrainians as a people are quite democratically minded, certainly\n\nby comparison to their eastern and northern neighbours. Today, ordinary\n\nUkrainians do not believe that they are living in a democracy, and that is a\n\ngood thing. It is one of several indications that citizens put a value on\n\ndemocracy, that they have a set of standards about it, and they know that\n\nthe current state of affairs does not measure up to them.\n\nThere is also promise in the attitudes of a large number of Ukrainians who\n\nare not ordinary. Not only in the Verkhovna Rada, but in any number of\n\nstate structures - not just the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Cabinet\n\nof Ministers, Presidential Administration and Armed Forces - one also meets\n\nrespectable numbers of individuals who are democratically minded, and\n\nwhilst this includes people who are inclined to support the opposition, it\n\nalso includes people who are not.\n\nThis crossing of political lines is of critical importance, because it means\n\nthat there is an evolutionary path forward for Ukraine. It means that whilst\n\nthe growth of civic instincts is sharpening the divide between state and\n\nsociety, it is also creating points of friction within the state and a\n\ndynamic of evolution inside it. Will an undemocratic president reverse this\n\ndynamic or will he simply retard it? Perhaps we will have a chance to see.\n\nIf we can be optimistic about the future, we also need to be realistic about\n\nthe present, and the present is defined by a well entrenched and\n\nincreasingly aggressive status quo. Can the character of this status quo be\n\nexplained purely by the interests of people in power? Or is its endurance\n\nand 'maturation' not equally a result of a misunderstanding of how a healthy\n\ndemocratic political order differs from Ukraine's - and why it is needed in\n\nthe interests of the country?\n\nToday there are a number of misunderstandings, and paradoxically, the\n\ndemocratic West has contributed to them. This is because, with some\n\ndistinguished exceptions, Western governments and international\n\norganisations have tended to emphasise the mechanics of democracy\n\nrather than the culture of democracy.\n\nFree elections and a free press are mechanics of democracy: very important\n\nmechanics, but they are neither the core of democracy nor the soul of it.\n\n'Democracy' describes a relationship between the state and society, and\n\nthe key to this relationship is the character of institutions. Even if\n\nelections are 'free and fair', there will be no real democracy if state and\n\npublic institutions continue to behave in an arrogant, autocratic, arbitrary\n\nand self-serving manner. If they do, the vast majority of people will\n\ncontinue to feel that their country is not theirs.\n\nThe fundamental problem in Ukraine is the gap between state and society.\n\nIn more commonplace terms, it is the powerlessness of ordinary people.\n\nThis powerlessness is something that is experienced on a daily basis - or,\n\nat least, on any day when people have to deal with an institution, a\n\n'structure of power', even if it is local or small. This, too, was the core\n\nproblem of the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet collapse, some things have\n\nimproved, some things have worsened, and much has remained the same.\n\nIn Ukraine today, there has been some, but far too little devolution of\n\npolitical power. There has also been little devolution of economic power.\n\nTo a distressing degree, the networks of privilege that existed before are\n\nthe networks of privilege that exist now. Some of the exceptions are not\n\nvery flattering to the post-Soviet order: criminal networks, who once\n\noperated apprehensively and in the shadows but who, despite being termed\n\n'shadow structures', now operate with impudence and near impunity. And\n\non the other end of the spectrum, there is the decline in privilege of the\n\nvery people who under the old system deserved it: the scientifically,\n\ntechnically and intellectually skilled - skilled, that is, in every art\n\nexcept finance.\n\nTo be sure, there has also been real progress. In recent years, there has\n\nbeen solid economic growth (albeit less than official statistics suggest),\n\nthere has been the emergence of a real (but still vulnerable) middle class,\n\na surge of property ownership (but without firm contractual rights) and\n\nsigns of honest (but hampered and harassed) entrepreneurship. Yet\n\nUkraine remains a country of people who feel alienated from their political\n\norder.\n\nThe West has been slow to face these realities, and for several critical\n\nyears, it damaged its standing by appearing to praise any practice pursued\n\nin the name of profit, privatisation and the free market. With good reason,\n\nmany people in Ukraine have failed to see the difference between\n\nprivatisation and plunder or between free markets and rigged markets.\n\nTherefore, we should not be surprised by the fact that Western ideas are\n\nnot dominating discussion. We need to change the discussion.\n\nIf the relationship between state and society is the core issue, then\n\ninstitutions are the bridge between them. What kind of institutions does\n\nUkraine need?\n\nFirst, Ukraine needs institutions that operate within a culture of authority\n\nrather than a culture of power. Authority is power that is codified and\n\nlimited to legitimate and openly articulated purposes. And it is not\n\ncodified by the authorities themselves, but by the people's elected\n\nrepresentatives. Today, all manner of 'authorities', beginning with the\n\nmilitsia, have become very entrepreneurial with the powers they have.\n\nThat is not authority, but its abuse.\n\nSecond, Ukraine needs institutions that operate within a proper framework\n\nof law. A system of 'codified arbitrariness' (to quote the French authority\n\nFrancoise Thom) is not law. Laws derive from a coherent and\n\ncomprehensible legal system founded on Hart's principle: 'the unity of\n\nprimary and secondary rules'. And law enforcement must be separate\n\nfrom politics. This means that the institutions which enforce the law must\n\nbe politically neutral. In the United States, as in Ukraine, no one likes\n\nthe tax authorities. But they trust the tax authorities irrespective of\n\nwhich political party or interest is in power.\n\nThird, Ukraine needs institutions that operate within conditions of\n\ntransparency. At its most elemental level, transparency is the ability to\n\nsee. This means the ability to see who people are. When Ukrainian citizens\n\nvote for a Communist, Socialist or a member of Nasha Ukraina to sit in\n\nparliament, they expect them to advance the programmes of these factions\n\nand not appear inside another faction within weeks of taking up their seats.\n\nToday, not only in politics but in business, there is very little ability to\n\nknow who people are. During the next major privatisation, try asking who\n\nthe leading contenders are - who are the real owners? what is their\n\ncitizenship? what are their resources? where are they invested? - and see\n\nwhat kind of answers you get.\n\nBut transparency also means the ability to know what decisions are taken,\n\nwhere they are taken, by whom they are taken and, preferably, why. Was\n\nthe Melitopol accident in May (which destroyed an enormous quantity of\n\nmunitions and millions of dollars in property - and which, by a few months,\n\npreceded the dismissal of Ukraine's Minister of Defence) really an accident\n\nor the result of a decision? To be sure, Ukraine has had bigger scandals\n\nthan Melitopol.\n\nAfter nearly all of them, it has proved impossible to answer these basic\n\nquestions. Without credible facts, rumours become credible, even the\n\nmost incredible rumours, particularly if they are based on conspiracy.\n\nPeople who put their trust in conspiracies rarely put their trust in other\n\npeople. It is unlikely that such people will (pace President Kuchma, 1996)\n\n'pull together at a crucial moment'.\n\nThe absence of transparency not only produces an absence of accountability,\n\nwhich is essential to democracy, but cynicism, which is poisonous to it. It\n\nalso threatens national security, and this was clearly stated by the authors\n\nof the 1997 National Security Concept and re-echoed by the authors of the\n\n2003 Law on the Foundations of National Security. The good news is that\n\nthese are official documents. But they won't have a practical influence\n\nuntil someone implants the notion that information, like air, is a 'public\n\ngood' rather than a strategic commodity and an instrument of power.\n\nUkraine's political culture is not comfortable with this notion. Nor is its\n\nbusiness culture, which operates less according to the conventions of\n\nWestern competitiveness than according to the conventions of\n\nfinansovaya-informatsionnaya bor'ba (financial-informational struggle).\n\nThis last point leads to two areas that are rarely discussed when democracy\n\nis discussed. The first, indeed, is the culture of business. Today, there\n\nare two cultures of business in Ukraine, and two cultures of business are\n\ndrawing a line across Europe. In one a business transaction is designed to\n\nbenefit both buyer and seller. In the other, it is part of a Darwinian\n\nrelationship, a form of bor'ba za vlast' (the struggle for power). In the\n\nlatter, business norms are conspiratorial: inbred, collusive, opaque to\n\noutsiders, and based upon networks rather than markets - networks that\n\nstraddle the spheres of business, politics and, far too often, crime. These\n\nnorms are not only a threat to democracy and Ukraine's EU integration\n\nprospects, but to good business.\n\nTwo examples will suffice. When the blue eyed genius of Russian capitalism,\n\nAnatoliy Chubays, became Chairman of United Energy Systems, he\n\ndiscovered that this vast enterprise - by any reckoning one of the largest\n\nin the world - did not possess a budget. He should not have been surprised.\n\nIf there is no budget, how do you know who is making money, who is losing\n\nmoney, who is wasting it and who is stealing it? A friend of mine working\n\nin another large Russian business, co-located in Ukraine, had this to say:\n\nWe have three tiers of management: junior management, who are insecure;\n\nsenior management, who are involved in high politics (and whom we never\n\nsee) and middle management. And what they do is steal.\n\nSome years ago, another friend negotiated with the regional authorities to\n\nlease land for development. Not surprisingly, the negotiations were\n\ndifficult and protracted, but at last a contract was concluded. Over the\n\nnext year, he invested most of his capital in this enterprise, and the\n\nfollowing year his business became very profitable. At that point, the very\n\nauthorities who had so carefully negotiated every detail of his contract\n\ntold him that it was invalid. They presented him with a list of the 'laws'\n\nhe had supposedly violated and threatened to issue criminal charges unless\n\nhe transferred the land back to them. Since that point, he has spent a\n\nthird of his time negotiating, a third of his time in court and a third of\n\nhis time in hospital. Who can have faith in entrepreneurship if\n\nentrepreneurs end up in these straits? Who can have faith in political\n\nrights if no economic rights exist?\n\nThe second area that tends to be ignored in discussions of democracy\n\nis the culture of administration. It, too, tends to be authoritarian,\n\ncompartmented and opaque. In most advanced democracies, the\n\nadministrative culture values hierarchy, but it also values two antidotes\n\nto it.\n\nThe first antidote is the devolution of authority and initiative: the\n\nso-called 'bottom-up' culture. The second is an emphasis on horizontal\n\nintegration, both within institutions and between them: in short, the\n\nopposite of the 'administrative vertical' exalted in Russia and, very often,\n\nin Ukraine. Both depend on the sharing of information. This is what a\n\nsenior British general meant when he explained to a group of Ukrainian\n\ngenerals how he made a decision: 'I communicate one level up, one level\n\ndown, one level to the left and one level to the right'.\n\nBy 'communicate', he meant that he listened before giving instructions and\n\nthat he made recommendations before his superiors gave instructions to him.\n\nDo these practices not explain why the most motivated and productive\n\nWestern institutions are lean and why so many Ukrainian institutions are\n\nunderproductive and overstaffed? Can a democratic political system\n\ncoexist with an authoritarian system of administration? Yes it can, and\n\nthere are examples to prove it. But the coexistence creates an incongruity\n\nin a country's authority structure which is damaging to democracy.\n\nFinally, there is the area we dare not ignore, Ukraine's force structures:\n\nnot just the Armed Forces, but the Security Services, Interior forces,\n\nBorder Service, customs and, of course police. To transform these\n\nstructures - to train people according to today's values rather than\n\nyesterday's, to inculcate decent norms of professionalism, to make these\n\nprofessionals feel they are part of society - it is necessary to respect\n\nthose who try hold onto their professionalism in adverse circumstances, and\n\nit is necessary to understand the work that they do. Governments of former\n\ndissidents in Central Europe have often failed to do this, and the result is\n\nthat these most democratic of people have contributed to the democratic\n\ndeficit in their countries.\n\nGovernments must also provide these services with money. This is not\n\nan alternative to spending money on social welfare. It is part of social\n\nwelfare. If militsioneriy (police) are paid wages inconsistent with life,\n\nit is inevitable that they will cheat rather than die. Here as elsewhere,\n\nthe goal is not to 'eliminate corruption' - a goal which is as unrealistic\n\nin Britain as it is in Ukraine. The goal is to create a state of affairs in\n\nwhich corruption is a matter of choice, rather than a matter of survival.\n\nIf the state cannot afford to fund force structures, somebody else will,\n\nand democracy, welfare and national security will suffer.\n\nIn conclusion, the point is not to criticise the world, but to change it.\n\nWe will not change it unless we recognise that institutions matter. Perhaps\n\nthey matter more than presidents. Institutional cultures, subcultures,\n\nresources and resourcefulness have broken the power of presidents, no\n\nmatter how fairly elected or popular. So, if there is a proper election in\n\nUkraine and the opposition succeeds in winning it, only the first challenge\n\nwill have been surmounted. The more serious challenge will be to hold\n\npower and not simply hold office. The worst scenario for Ukraine is not\n\nthat Yushchenko loses the election. Far worse is that he wins and then\n\nfails.\n\nThis, too, may be decided by cultural factors. The current authorities are\n\nnot the product of a democratic culture, but a Leninist culture. The\n\nopposition might consider this an amoral culture, but it would be perilous\n\nto despise it. Leninists understand organisation, time-keeping, planning,\n\npragmatism and power. Let us hope that enough members of the opposition\n\nunderstand the same. -30-\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1] Disclaimer: The views expressed are the author's and not necessarily\n\nthose of the UK Ministry of Defence.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames Sherr, Conflict Studies Research Centre, Defence Academy of\n\nthe United Kingdom, Camberly, Surrey, England; e-mail:\n\njames.sherr@lincoln.oxford.ac.uk\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJames Sheer has worked on Ukrainian issues for many years especially\n\nin the defence area, including NATO.

DOUBTS EXPRESSED ABOUT POTENTIAL FOR FREE AND\n\nFAIR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN UKRAINE\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL)\n\nWashington, D.C., Monday, October 4, 2004\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - Two election campaign observers who recently\n\nvisited Ukraine expressed concern that a free and fair presidential election\n\nmay not take place on October 31. With two-thirds of Ukrainians\n\ndeclaring their doubts about a fair election, and with allegations surfacing\n\nabout the possible poisoning of an opposition candidate, both experts told a\n\nRFE/RL audience last week that this is a high-stakes election for the people\n\nof Ukraine.\n\nDonald L. Ritter, a former Congressman and senior member of the\n\nCommission on Security and Cooperation on Europe (aka U.S. Helsinki\n\nCommission), said that if stronger Western support is not given to ensure\n\na fair election, \"the doors to Ukraine might not be as open in another 5\n\nyears.\" According to Ritter, members of the \"[old] Soviet hierarchy\" make\n\nup the current power structure in Ukraine, and are \"hanging onto power to\n\nprotect their benefits and privileges.\" They are endangering Ukraine's\n\nfuture because \"without a free market, there can be no free people,\" Ritter\n\nconcluded.\n\nA former European Parliament member and European representative on\n\nthe World Bank's Inspection Panel, Maartje van Putten, stressed the\n\nimportance of an active European role in assisting Ukraine during its\n\ntransition to democracy and free market economy. While acknowledging\n\nthe role of U.S. support of democratic processes in Ukraine, particularly\n\nin funding election observer missions, van Putten said that, because Ukraine\n\nis on \"our continent,\" Europe should do more to help democracy develop\n\nthere. She expressed the hope that, \"as long as the borders remain open,\n\ncommunication can still take place.\"\n\nRitter and van Putten reported finding government-censored media\n\nthroughout Ukraine, and van Putten said there was little evidence that most\n\nof the 26 candidates for president were even conducting election campaigns.\n\nShe noted seeing avenues lined with government-endorsed candidate Viktor\n\nYanukovych's campaign billboards, but very few publicity materials\n\nsupporting other candidacies, including that of opposition leader Viktor\n\nYushchenko. Nonetheless, she found that Ukrainians were remarkably open\n\nabout expressing their concerns to the election campaign monitors. Van\n\nPutten also believes that people are \"communicating\" information by word\n\nof mouth about conditions and campaign issues.\n\nBoth Ritter and van Putten urged the Western press to write more about\n\nthe current Ukrainian presidential election campaign. Ritter asked, \"Why\n\nisn't the Western press concerned about the recent [alleged] poisoning\n\nof the leading opposition candidate?\" Van Putten agreed, saying that\n\n\"the Ukrainian people have been denied a free society for too long.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a private, international\n\ncommunications service to Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe;\n\nthe Caucasus; and Central and Southwestern Asia funded by the U.S.\n\nCongress through the Broadcasting Board of Governors.\n\nTo hear archived audio for this and other RFE/RL briefings and events,\n\nplease visit our website at http://www.regionalanalysis.org\n\nRadio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, 1201 Connecticut Ave NW,\n\nWashington, DC 20036, tel: 202-457-6900, fax: 202-457-6992\n\nCONTACT: Martins Zvaners (202) 457-6948, Melody Jones\n\n(202) 457-6949; http://www.rferl.org\n\n========================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.182: ARTICLE NUMBER FOUR\n\n========================================================\n\n4. \"UKRAINE'S NEW PRAGMATIC NATIONALISM\"\n\nBy Taras Kuzio, Professor, Elliott School International Affairs\n\nGeorge Washington University, Washington, D.C.\n\nPublished by Kyiv Weekly, Kyiv, Ukraine, Friday, 31 Oct 2004\n\nBritish experts on Russia were the first to define Russia's leaders, already\n\nunder President Borys Yeltsin, as \"pragmatic nationalists\" who supported\n\ncooperation with, but not integration into, the West. What these experts\n\nunderstood as \"pragmatic nationalists\" were derzhavnyky, the position that\n\nstate leaders adopt in any \"normal\" state. Such a definition is even more\n\napplicable to Russia since 2000 under Vladimir Putin who has removed the\n\noligarchs from running the state and, like U.S. President George W. Bush, is\n\na pragmatic nationalist.\n\nDuring the Kuchma era Ukraine did not become a \"normal\" country and the\n\nframework developed by British experts to define post-Soviet Russia could\n\nnot be readily applied to Ukraine as there was little evidence of \"pragmatic\n\nnationalists\" being in power. Instead, personal, clan or regional interests\n\ndominated over state (i.e. derzhavnysky) national interests.\n\nThis is now changing. Since Viktor Yanukovych became Prime Minister in\n\nNovember 2002, and especially this year as Ukraine approaches the end of\n\nthe Kuchma era, there are many signs of the development of Ukraine's own\n\npragmatic nationalism.\n\nIn this sense, sociologist Viktor Nebozhenko was correct to describe this\n\nyear's elections as a contest between \"two representatives of nationalism:\n\n(Viktor) Yushchenko's historical-cultural nationalism and (Viktor)\n\nYanukovych's economic nationalism. And this and that want the best for\n\nUkraine, but from different perspectives\" (Hromadske Radio, September 8).\n\nCHUMATSKY SHLIAKH\n\nUkraine's pragmatic nationalism seeks to rely upon one's own forces and\n\nchoose Ukraine's \"own way\" (Yanukovych). Such a view appeals to a large\n\ngroup of Ukrainians. 45 percent on the SDPUo web site www.temnik.com.ua\n\nreplied that \"Nobody\" when asked \"Who is Ukraine's main Friend?\" (13\n\npercent believed it was the USA while only 22 percent thought it was\n\nRussia).\n\nUkraine's newly emerging \"pragmatic nationalism\" refuses to \"blindly copy\"\n\nEurope or the West but instead to develop according to Ukrainian traditions,\n\nPresident Leonid Kuchma and Rada speaker Voldymyr Lytvyn have argued.\n\nPresident Kuchma told the Central European Initiative in Romania this year\n\nthat, \"Ukrainians have to learn to rely in the first instance upon our own\n\nresources\".\n\nThis view was first raised by then Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk in the mid\n\n1990s but at that time it fell on deaf ears because Ukraine was actually\n\nseeking (at least in rhetoric) to copy Europe by integrating into the EU and\n\nNATO. Now, both Kuchma and Yanukovych advise us that Ukraine is \"not\n\nready\" to integrate into the EU or NATO. Instead, Yanukovych explained that,\n\n\"Ukraine should build its own national security system\". This is because\n\nUkraine has its own \"strategic interests\" which will be defended, Yanukovych\n\nconfidently states.\n\nAnother aspect of Ukraine's \"pragmatic nationalism\" comes from deep feelings\n\nof post-colonial insecurity. In the 1990s Ukraine attempted to deal with\n\nits inferiority complex vis-à-vis Russia which did not then treat it as a\n\nserious state, but only as a temporary aberration.\n\nNow, this inferiority complex emphasis has shifted its focus towards the\n\nWest. Ukraine's centrist \"pragmatic nationalists\" refuse to \"kneel\" before\n\nthe West, Viktor Medvedchuk angrily asserted. Ukraine should not integrate\n\ninto Europe as a, \"younger sister. We have already gone through this\",\n\nKuchma said. Yanukovych added that, \"Ukraine will never agree to be anyone's\n\nyounger brother. We must never allow Ukraine to be humiliated anywhere\".\n\nBoth Kuchma and Yanukovych have rejected out of hand the alleged\n\n\"disrespectful\" tone of Western criticism of Ukraine's undemocratic\n\npractices.\n\nWHO IS MORE NATIONALIST: YUSHCHENKO OR YANUKOVYCH?\n\nOf the two leading presidential candidates Yanukovych is more nationalistic\n\nthan Yushchenko. Not, in ethno-cultural terms but in terms of being in\n\nfavour of Ukraine's own \"chumatsky shliakh\".\n\nUkraine's centrists, such as Yanukovych, do not desire to integrate with\n\neither Russia or the EU and NATO. Integration of whatever type would take\n\npower (i.e. sovereignty) from them. As this years elections are showing,\n\nUkraine's \"pragmatic nationalists\" also do not desire to share power with\n\nanybody domestically.\n\nThis wish to monopolise domestic and external power in Ukraine was clearly\n\nseen in the privatization of Kryvorizhstal in June. State Property Fund head\n\nMykhailo Chechetov described its purchase by Ukrainian investors as a\n\n\"patriotic\" deed. Such views are reminiscent of post-colonial nationalists\n\nin the non-aligned movement who champion \"national capitol\". Even candidate\n\nAnatoliy Kinakh describes his position as \"economic nationalism\".\n\nThis is very different to political leaders on the left and right. Both of\n\nthese groups desire to integrate with either Russia and the CIS (the left)\n\nor with the EU and NATO (the national democrats). Integration in any\n\ndirection automatically requires the giving up of sovereignty which the left\n\nand national democrats would have to agree to.\n\nOf the two leading presidential candidates (Yushchenko and Yanukovych) it is\n\nthe former who would be more interested in EU and NATO integration and\n\nhence would be forced to give up some Ukrainian sovereignty. In other words,\n\nYushchenko would no longer just voice rhetoric in support of integration, as\n\nwas the case until now.\n\nAnatoliy Halchynsky, director of the National Institute Strategic Studies,\n\ncriticises the Yushchenko camp as being in favour of \"To Europe at any\n\nprice\". He dislikes this position because it will mean integrating into\n\nEurope as a \"younger sister\".\n\nIf elected president, Yanukovych would evolve towards a Russian-style\n\nforeign policy. This would mean pragmatically cooperating with the West but\n\nfocusing most of his attention on Russia and the CIS United Economic Space.\n\nWhile reversing Ukraine's foreign policy focus, Ukraine would pragmatically\n\ncooperate with the West in some areas which were in its national interests.\n\nThis pragmatic approach is what guides Russia's dealings with the West and\n\nbest suits ideologically amorphous Russian and Ukrainian centrists.\n\nIn President Kuchma's last year in office there is a growing re-assertion of\n\nUkrainian (pragmatic) state-economic nationalism vis-à-vis the outside\n\nworld. This is because of a widespread view among President Kuchma and his\n\nallies that the West demands a lot from Ukraine but fails to itself deliver\n\non promises, such as the failure of the G7 to compensate Ukraine for closing\n\nthe Chornobyl nuclear plant. The lack of compensation is because Ukraine is\n\nnot respected, Kuchma believes, \"It is because they are \"big\" and we are\n\nsmall!\".\n\nPRAGMATIC NATIONALISM\n\nUkraine's pragmatic nationalism, like its Russian counterpart, does not see\n\nhow \"real patriots\" can be in opposition as they understand \"opposition\" as\n\nworking against the derzhava. Such views obviously mean the opposition are\n\ndenied legitimacy in Ukraine's political system.\n\nThey understand the Communists as being in opposition because they do not\n\nwant an independent Ukrainian state, but find it impossible to comprehend\n\nhow Yushchenko can be in opposition and still call himself a patriot? True\n\npatriots also allegedly do not talk negatively of Ukraine when they travel\n\nabroad. Ukrainian citizens (and members of the diaspora) should only\n\ntherefore talk positively of Ukraine when they are outside the country.\n\nStepan Havrysh talks of \"healthy nationalism\" as being the same as\n\npatriotism, or love for one's own country (obkom.net.ua, 30 August). Ukraine\n\n's Ministry of Transportation is headed by Transport Minister Heorhiy Kirpa\n\nwho is a well respected, energetic minister. Over the Summer Kirpa launched\n\nhis own political party, Renaissance (Vidrodzhenia), whose underlying\n\nideology is \"state nationalism\".\n\nCOOPERATION WITH EUROPE, TOGETHER WITH RUSSIA\n\nUkraine's new state-economic nationalism feels more at home aligned with\n\nRussia than with the West. One reason is that the former does not lay\n\npolitical demands upon Ukraine's elites.\n\nUkraine's pragmatic nationalists are not pro-Russian, just as they were\n\nnever pro-Western during the 1990s. Ultimately, they do not seek to\n\nintegrate fully with Russia and the CIS, just as they did not with the EU or\n\nNATO. Integration in any direction is a threat to their monopolisation of\n\npower.\n\nIn the 1990s Ukraine's centrist elites were threatened by Russia because it\n\nrefused to recognize either Ukraine's borders or sovereignty. This was\n\nmainly resolved by February 1999 when Russia's upper house ratified the\n\n1997 treaty, only 8 months before the end of Kuchma's first term in office.\n\nDuring Kuchma's second term the threat has changed from Russia to the\n\nWest. Ukraine's ruling elites are well established and Russia now recognizes\n\nUkraine's sovereignty and borders. It is now the West's demands to hold\n\nfree and fair elections, permit independent media, and improve democratic\n\nconditions that have become the main threat to Ukraine's centrist, ruling\n\nelites.\n\nUkraine's \"chumatsky shliakh\" is therefore an indirect admission that the\n\nrequirements made of countries to integrate into the EU and NATO are\n\nincompatible with Ukraine's elites remaining in power. In an age of\n\nglobalisation and integration such isolationist nationalism has little\n\nperspective. -30-\n\n========================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.182: ARTICLE NUMBER FIVE\n\n========================================================\n\n5. \"IN THE LAND WHERE SOVIET STYLE LIVES ON\"\n\nCommentary by Peter Savodnik, Outlook Section\n\nThe Washington Post, Washington, D.C.\n\nSunday, October 3, 2004; Page B03\n\nVladimir Putin's recent call for a new Russian authoritarianism -- and the\n\nnear-total support the president's proposal enjoys at home -- should rattle\n\nnot only Western diplomats but democratic opposition leaders throughout\n\nthe former Soviet Union. For them, Russia's reversal raises a fundamental,\n\neven existential, question: Are the people living in the 15 former Soviet\n\nrepublics capable of governing themselves? Do they yearn to be free? Or\n\nis it their nature to acquiesce to dictatorship when the apparent price of\n\nfreedom -- say, the massacre of hundreds of schoolchildren -- becomes\n\ntoo expensive?\n\nThis question of post-Soviet political identity is particularly salient in\n\nBelarus, Russia's immediate neighbor to the west: On Oct. 17, Belarusans,\n\nhaving rejected freedom in favor of security a decade ago, head to the polls\n\nfor parliamentary elections. Their dictatorial president, Alexander\n\nLukashenko, has shown little appetite for democratic reform. But the liberal\n\nactivists running for office -- a hodgepodge of social democrats, free\n\nmarketeers, reconstructed Marxists and others who call themselves the\n\nFive-Plus Coalition -- believe now is their moment.\n\nThis is, at least for the present, a dubious proposition. In Belarus, the\n\nfourth estate is more or less an organ of Lukashenko's regime, and elections\n\nare for show; fears of ballot tampering and last-minute disqualification of\n\ndemocratic candidates are rampant. Before liberal reform can sweep Belarus\n\nor Russia, Ukraine, Moldova or Georgia, the people of those nations will\n\nhave to choose whether they want to be subjects or citizens, whether they\n\nwant the right (and the responsibility) to build their own future.\n\nThis may sound odd to Americans, since most of us take it for granted that\n\nall peoples want to be the masters of their own destinies. But at a time\n\nwhen the United States is exporting, or attempting to export, democracy to\n\nthe Middle East, it's legitimate to ask whether, in fact, everyone\n\neverywhere wants to be like us. Our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, as\n\nwell as the uncertainty surrounding the post-Soviet world, should give us\n\npause.\n\nStanislav Shushkevich, the former head of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus and\n\ncurrent leader of the Social Democratic Party, voices skepticism about the\n\ndemocratic movement's chances of making any headway this year, even as he\n\nremains committed to the idea of democracy. He points out that Belarusans\n\nhave been conditioned by centuries of oppression to put up with almost\n\nanything; a quarter of the pre-war Belarusan population was murdered by the\n\nSoviets and the Nazis in the 1930s and '40s.\n\nTo many, Lukashenko is but a pale shadow of Stalin and Brezhnev, an utterly\n\nunexceptional postscript to socialist totalitarianism. Indeed, Lukashenko\n\nretains support among peasants living in pre-Soviet villages, and the\n\npensioners and World War II veterans whose lives were defined by the\n\nstruggle against fascism, five-year plans and the socialist march toward\n\n\"freedom.\"\n\nWhen I visited him in the capital city of Minsk last May, Shushkevich, who\n\nis nearing 70, speculated that the moment for peaceful transition may have\n\nbeen lost. A former nuclear physicist, it was he, along with Boris Yeltsin\n\nand Leonid Kravchuk, then president of Ukraine, who formally dissolved the\n\nSoviet Union in a Belarusan hunting lodge in late 1991.\n\nTen million Belarusans who had been rotting away in a \"workers' paradise\"\n\nhaunted by the gulag and made nearly uninhabitable by the Chernobyl disaster\n\nwere set free. A liberal regime took power, with Shushkevich at its head.\n\nBut the West, Shushkevich told me, missed its best opportunity to help build\n\na stable democracy when it failed to give Belarus low-interest loans. The\n\n\"shock therapy\" of privatization proved too great for Belarusans, he said.\n\nLukashenko, a parliamentary deputy at the time, was able to capitalize on\n\nwidespread discontent.\n\nAfter three years of independence, the Belarusans decided they'd had enough\n\nof democracy. With the 1994 election of Lukashenko, they made clear what\n\nthey wanted: Order, predictability and an all-powerful state to safeguard\n\nagainst drug traffickers, arms dealers and foreign investors looking to\n\ncarve up downtown Minsk. They also made it clear what they did not want:\n\nFreedom. The freedom to build a life, to express an opinion, to be more than\n\na cog in the communal organism.\n\nToday, Lukashenko is the unquestioned dictator of his country, having spent\n\nthe past decade marginalizing opposition leaders, shutting down independent\n\nnewspapers and squeezing business owners to the point of near-extinction.\n\nShushkevich doesn't foresee a peaceful evolution to a more democratic\n\nsociety. He believes that a challenge to Lukashenko is more likely to\n\nresemble what took place in Romania, where dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu\n\nwas murdered in 1989, than in Czechoslovakia, where a bloodless Velvet\n\nRevolution toppled the communist regime that same year. \"My parents and\n\ngrandparents would put it this way,\" he said of Lukashenko's long-term\n\nprospects. \"This man will not die a natural death.\"\n\nThis is indeed a critical time, and not only in Belarus. Ukrainians will\n\nvote for their next president on Oct. 31, and the recent suspected poisoning\n\nof opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko is just one of many signs that reform\n\nwill not come easily to the former Soviet Union.\n\nThere is a tragic inevitability to all this. \"In the course of the 20th\n\ncentury, successive regimes, wars, revolutions, gulags, eliminated the most\n\nactive, the most independent, the most energetic people,\" said historian\n\nRoman Szporluk, the recently retired director of Harvard University's\n\nUkrainian Research Institute. \"For people to survive under Stalin, under\n\ncommunism, you had to pretend to be stupid. If you go on this way\n\ngeneration after generation, you really create a certain mode of behavior.\"\n\nStill, the younger reformers -- the university activists, independent\n\njournalists, anarchists and human rights lawyers -- are more optimistic than\n\npeople like Shushkevich. They despise Lukashenko for his backwardness\n\nand his thick peasant accent. They fear the local KGB, the nighttime\n\narrests, the \"ideological managers\" who regulate their schools and\n\nbusinesses, the inanity and iniquity of a system that has no legitimacy\n\nor meaning. But they believe freedom is as inevitable as the classless\n\nutopia their great-grandparents were promised.\n\nValentina Polevikova, a former trade union leader and now a democratic\n\ncandidate from Minsk in the parliamentary elections, characterized the\n\nreform movement as an effort to change the way Belarusans think about the\n\nrelationship between the state and civil society. \"I want to talk to them so\n\nthat they understand that Lukashenko has been lying to them for 10 years\n\nthe way the Soviets lied to them for 70 years,\" she told me.\n\nPolevikova and other reformers said the elections two weeks from now will\n\nshow whether Belarusans' three-year experiment with freedom in the early\n\n1990s was an aberration or a promise of the possibility of a different kind\n\nof political identity. This may be putting too much emphasis on a single\n\ncampaign. The reformist coalition has spent more than a year recruiting\n\ncandidates, but it's unlikely they'll win even a handful of the 110\n\nparliamentary seats up for grabs.\n\nIn the longer term, though, there are reasons to be hopeful. First, Belarus\n\nis not a place like Iraq, with its ancient hatreds, war-torn cities and\n\nradical theocrats hellbent on annihilating all things Western. It is a\n\nEuropean nation with churches, newspapers and an intelligentsia that has\n\ngiven rise to a protest class of students, trade unionists, veterans of the\n\nAfghan war, even ex-KGB agents.\n\nMore importantly, it is not defined so much by language, ethnicity or race\n\nas by geography. \"I think ethnic origins don't mean anything,\" said poet\n\nNikolai Viniatski, while taking part in a protest against the regime in\n\nMinsk last spring. Belarus is populated by Orthodox Russians, Polish\n\nCatholics, even a smattering of Jews.\n\nIntermarriage is easy and ubiquitous. It was the Soviets who concocted this\n\nmix, as part of their plan to \"de-ethnicize\" the proletarian mass. And now,\n\nironically, it is that cultural reengineering of a half-century ago that is\n\nlaying the foundation for post-Soviet democracy, activists believe. In\n\nBelarus, Viniatski explained, there is no tribalism; the ethnic tension that\n\ncolors life in the Baltics, the conflagration that is the Caucasus, could\n\nnever happen here. People are, for the most part, comfortable with\n\ndifference. You might call them post-ethnic.\n\nYou might also call them post-ideological. In Belarus, they know that Marx's\n\nscientific materialism is dead. That dream turned out to be a joke for which\n\ntens of millions died. This has made Belarusans bitter and ironic. Over\n\nvodka, in their kitchens, they call their fearless leader a buffoon who\n\nlikes to work out with the national hockey team but has been barred from\n\nthe White House. They wonder when they will be able to join the community\n\nof nations.\n\nAll this can be to the good, even if the elections later this month are\n\nunlikely to spark a revolution. In Belarus's East European neighbors and\n\nelsewhere, after all, bitterness and irony have often served as a ripe\n\nmedium for change. -30-\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPeter Savodnik is political editor of the Hill newspaper.

MEDVEDCHUK DENIES PLOTTING TO DISRUPT ELECTION\n\nUkrayinska Pravda web site, Kiev, Ukraine, in Ukrainian 4 Oct 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, Mon, Oct 04, 2004\n\nKIEV - The head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, Viktor\n\nMedvedchuk, has dismissed allegations that he is plotting to disrupt the\n\nupcoming presidential election. In an article posted on 4 October on the\n\npro-opposition web site Ukrayinska Pravda, Medvedchuk said the\n\naccusations were nothing more than \"an act of provocation\" by the\n\nopposition.\n\nOn 30 September, Ukrayinska Pravda published an article by reputed Kremlin\n\nadviser Stanislav Belkovskiy, in which he said that Medvedchuk had secured\n\nPutin's support for a scheme to disrupt the 31 October election through\n\nviolations.\n\nMedvedchuk ridiculed Belkovskiy's statements, saying there is no way the\n\nanalyst could have possibly learnt what Medvedchuk and Putin discussed at\n\na recent meeting.

SUMMARY OF RUSSIAN TV'S SEPTEMBER REPORTS\n\nON UKRAINIAN PRESIDENTIAL RACE\n\nSource: BBC Monitoring research in English 2 Oct 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, Sat, Oct 02, 2004\n\nUkrainian PM and presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych was given top\n\nbilling by Russia's state-controlled Channel One and state-owned Russia TV\n\nin their reports on the presidential election campaign in Ukraine during\n\nSeptember. The month culminated in Yanukovych's privileged briefing for\n\nRussian media chiefs on 27 September. That event was made even more\n\nunique by the presence and - as was made amply clear in the reports -\n\nsupport of ambassador and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin\n\non behalf of Russia.\n\nThe 24 September \"attack\" on Yanukovych was widely reported. Meanwhile,\n\nonly one TV channel - Channel One - was monitored to report on 21\n\nSeptember on opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko's accusation that he\n\nhad been poisoned by state officials. The report's verdict was \"without\n\nproof\". No Russia TV report on the subject was monitored.\n\nRussia TV's \"Vesti\" main evening news on 2 September reported on a\n\nUkrainian book event during a Moscow fair. In the video, Ukrainian President\n\nLeonid Kuchma smiles from a photograph that greets visitors to the stand. \"A\n\npolitical biography of the Ukrainian prime minister is among the latest\n\neditions brought to Moscow,\" the report remarks once observations of a more\n\ngeneral nature are out of the way. \"It is called The Viktor Yanukovych\n\nEnigma.\"\n\nA report monitored the same day from Channel One (1400 gmt) fleshed out\n\nthe event as it told its viewers about \"books which look set to top the\n\nbestseller list\". (In the video, the same photograph of Leonid Kuchma that\n\nwas in evidence in the Russia TV piece competes for prominence with\n\nvolumes of Taras Shevchenko) \"And for the first time ever, the Ukrainian\n\npolitical genre has had a stand of its own\", with both Yanukovych and\n\nYushchenko the subject of recent biographical accounts.\n\n\"Valentyn Chemerys's book, The Viktor Yanukovych Enigma, represents\n\nthe first attempt to tell the Ukrainians about the real prime minister\n\nthrough his biography, pictures from a family album (some of which we see\n\non screen, one with Yanukovych in a hard hat and a boiler suit among coal\n\nminers underground) and previously unpublicized facts about his personal\n\nlife, \"the report goes on to say. The publisher states his interest in the\n\nhuman side of Yanukovych. Yanukovych smiles from the cover of the book.\n\nThe cover of Aleksey Lan's account of Yushchenko's career is rather less\n\ncomplimentary. A close-up reveals a sinister image of a hooded Yushchenko\n\nwho stares out at the reader over the title of the book - \"Yushchenko:\n\nHistory of an Illness\" - emblazoned in red below the grey image. It is a\n\nbook that contains \"documents about privatizations and billions paid into US\n\nbank accounts\", in the words of the report, all of it \"information about\n\nUkraine's former prime minister gathered by Lan during his service with the\n\ntax police\". \"These are all well-documented facts, based on real documents\n\nin the public domain,\" adds the author himself.\n\nYushchenko, we are told, is also the subject of \"well-known Kiev journalist\"\n\nAndriy Derepa's profile of the ex-prime minister and his wife - \"a US\n\nnational\" - with the publication's veracity once again emphasized in the\n\nreport. Derepa himself is on hand to assert that, \"as the book proves\n\nthrough documents, she was linked to what we call the special services,\n\nactive in the US Departments of State and of the Treasury\". \"The books\n\nare flying off the shelves,\" the report concludes.\n\nOn 5 September, Russia TV's \"Vesti Nedeli\" thought Yanukovych had the\n\nedge in the battle for the red vote (of importance in a second round): Petro\n\nSymonenko, the communist leader and himself a candidate, argued that\n\nalthough Yushchenko claims to make relations with Russia a top priority, his\n\nassociates are anti-Russian. In a further nuance, there was video footage of\n\na nationalist gathering some months ago, at which Yushchenko's brother\n\nmade a controversial speech in the presence of \"openly fascist\" elements.\n\nYanukovych is complimented on his cabinet's performance. Yushchenko\n\nis berated for a \"politicized\" visit to a region. And in a studio comment\n\nafterwards, Russian political commentator and Kremlin insider Gleb\n\nPavlovskiy was concerned at the prospect of destabilization and disorder\n\nin Ukraine if Yushchenko does not gain the number of votes he thinks he\n\ndeserves, as indeed is likely, Pavlovskiy asserts, on the basis of current\n\nopinion polls.\n\nOn 12 September, Channel One turned its attention to Lviv, where left-\n\nwing parties held protests to demand that a street in that city named after\n\nformer Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev be renamed following the\n\nevents in Beslan. This, it said, is opposed by one of the parties that form\n\nYushchenko's bloc. In the video report, which was filmed shortly after\n\nBeslan, we learn that a Ukrainian TV channel supportive of Yushchenko\n\ncontinuously called the hostage-takers \"partisans\", which Yanukovych\n\ncondemned. Finally, a political commentator said the current government,\n\nled by Yanukovych, is the best the country's ever had. The report predicts\n\nthat Yushchenko, ahead of Yanukovych by \"as little as\" 1 per cent, will be\n\ninevitably caught up with and overtaken.\n\nOnly one state TV channel - Channel One - was monitored to report on\n\nYushchenko's accusation that state officials had tried to poison him. In a\n\nthree-minute report on 21 September, a correspondent tells us how\n\nYushchenko, \"emotionally but without proof\", addressed parliament as a\n\nresult of which an inquiry would be set up. Thus, \"scandal first, work\n\nlater\", sums up the report, as it goes on to say that \"no less\" than next\n\nyear's budget, \"with its social guarantees\", has suffered. \"The budget,\n\nmeanwhile, is quite revolutionary,\" and provides for compensation for the\n\n1990s' savers. Yanukovych, in an interview, illustrates the figures. No\n\nRussia TV report on this subject was monitored.\n\nIn the TV channels' description of an \"attack\" on Yanukovych on the campaign\n\ntrail by a \"radically minded student\" on 24 September, Russia TV the same\n\nday was the most dramatic: it headlined its report as the Ukraine PM's\n\n\"several hours in intensive care\", asked \"Who is behind this?\" and screened\n\nfootage of the incident. In the piece, what Russian NTV said was an \"egg\"\n\nthrown at the PM became \"two heavy metal objects\". Yanukovych was\n\n\"wounded\" and rushed to hospital. There were reactions from spokesman\n\nTaras Chornovil, in whose version Yanukovych was hit by a stone, and\n\npresidential aide Vasyl Baziv, who commented on the \"vicious circle\" of\n\n\"hatred\". Yanukovych's reaction, in a press release, followed:\n\n\"Nationalism\", he said, \"is a disease.\"\n\nWe are told that the student has already confessed, and is a Yushchenko\n\nsupporter. \"I have no questions to the young people who treated me in this\n\nway, but I do have questions to their leaders - Yushchenko's entourage,\"\n\nwere the remarks further attributed to Yanukovych by a Channel One report\n\nthe same day. \"Elections come and go. Ukraine remains. Whether it remains\n\nunited or split is to be decided now,\" his election HQ echoed. It fell to\n\nNTV to pick up on the discrepancies mentioned above (we see a close-up\n\nof a splodge formed by a broken \"pre-election\" egg) and listen to the\n\nopposition's side of the story.\n\nThe subject recurred on all three channels on 26 September, as NTV showed\n\nYanukovych in hospital but included an interview with a member of the\n\nYushchenko team who said the incident seemed suspect, while Channel One\n\nand Russia TV rounded up developments in the campaign with an overview of\n\nthe Yanukovych, Yushchenko and Tymoshenko (Russian arrest warrant)\n\nepisodes. Meanwhile, Russia TV's \"Vesti Nedeli\" anchor appeared sceptical\n\nof Yushchenko's version of events but thought much of the \"well-documented\"\n\nattack on Yanukovych. Channel One the same day largely followed the same\n\npattern.\n\nFinally, in one of the latest reports on the subject of the campaign, both\n\nChannel One and Russia TV on 27 September gave prominence to\n\nYanukovych's privileged briefing for Russian media chiefs. The event was\n\nmade even more unique by the presence and - as was made amply clear in\n\nthe reports - support of ambassador and former Prime Minister Viktor\n\nChernomyrdin on behalf of Russia. Russia TV's report was the longer of\n\nthe two.\n\nIn it, we learn that with the speech over - in which Yanukovych complained\n\nthere was too little information about Ukraine in the Russian media (\"the\n\neditors-in-chief are promising to sort out the problem\") - questions were\n\ntaken. Somewhat inexplicably, that part of the proceedings took place\n\nwithout TV cameras present. \"At least three sensational statements\" were\n\nmade: Ukraine will not join NATO but will allow dual Russian-Ukrainian\n\ncitizenship and the use of Russian as the second state language.\n\nPavlovskiy, in his capacity as editor-in-chief of Russkiy Zhurnal, was on\n\nhand to argue the case for Russia and Ukraine as a \"single space\". Lastly,\n\nin the detail added by the Channel One report, Yanukovych quashed talk of\n\nYushchenko's prime ministership if he, Yanukovych, were elected president.\n\nHis argument? \"The prime minister should be a leader, not someone who is\n\nled.\" Of Yanukovych, meanwhile, Chernomyrdin left no-one in any doubt:\n\n\"He looks the part. He is strong, he is a sportsman.
