        "text": "CNN Insight\n\nOne Dead Man, One Defiant Leader In Ukraine\n\nAired March 2, 2001 - 5:00 p.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nJONATHAN MANN, INSIGHT (voice-over): A killing in Ukraine. The regime of President Leonid Kuchma has been accused of electoral fraud, mismanagement and corruption. Now, a different kind of scandal surrounding a mysterious murder and tantalizing tapes.\n\n(on camera): Hello, and welcome.\n\nInevitably, some people are calling it \"Kuchmagate.\" But by the standards of Watergate, the scandal unfolding in Ukraine is, in many respects, worse. A man was murdered. His murder is only a small part of the problem.\n\nKiev is independent of Moscow for the first time in more than three centuries. And yet its opportunity to reform and advance may have been wasted. Some people feel President Kuchma is to blame. And until late this week, protesters had taken to the streets of the capital.\n\nOn our program today - one dead man, one defiant leader in Ukraine.\n\nWe begin with CNN's Jill Dougherty.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nJILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The protest tent city stood on Kiev's main street for more than two months. Ukrainian authorities pointed to it as proof the country protected democratic rights.\n\nThursday, armed with a court order, police moved in. The tents were torn down. Forty-four activists were arrested and later released.\n\nSERHIY HOLOTAVY, OPPOSITION PARLIAMENT MEMBER: Since today, in Kiev, constitutional rights and guarantees for liberties, for demonstrations, meetings, freedom of expression does not exist.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Last week, President Kuchma told CNN let the tents stay there but warned a court order was pending. Thursday, he said police did the right thing.\n\nLEONID KUCHMA, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The authorities showed today that government power exists, and I consider that an absolutely correct decision. Everyone should know that in the future.\n\nDOUGHERTY: The action came four days after a rally on the main street demanding President Leonid Kuchma step down. The opposition accuses him of corruption and of urging the kidnapping of an opposition journalist. The headless corpse of that journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, was found in a shallow grave in the woods outside Kiev in November.\n\nThe allegations are part of what's being called Kuchmagate, a scandal involving audio tapes allegedly made of the president by a member of his own security service. Major Nikola Melnichenko (ph), now hiding in Europe, says he has hundreds more hours of recordings proving President Kuchma is corrupt.\n\nThe president claims the recordings were doctored. The tapes set off a political bombshell in the Ukrainian parliament. Signs demanding Kuchma's impeachment now hang from the balconies. But the opposition remains divided.\n\nPresident Kuchma's scandals are straining relations with the United States. Until two years ago, Ukraine was the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid. Washington is treading carefully, trying to avoid pushing Ukraine back into the arms of Russia.\n\nThis week, the U.S. State Department said it regretted the removal of the tent city. U.S. president George W. Bush, in a message to Mr. Kuchma, acknowledged the strained political atmosphere and urged Ukraine to remain committed to the rule of law, democracy and human rights.\n\nProtest leaders, meanwhile, are regrouping after the tent city arrests.\n\nYURI LUTSENKO, PROTEST COORDINATOR (through translator): We realize what kind of machine we're dealing with here. While the criminals in power continue to give orders to police, our resistance will only increase.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Leaders say they'll have new forms of protest and are planning action for March 9.\n\nJill Dougherty, CNN, Moscow.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMANN: Most Ukrainians have never heard the tapes at the center of the scandal. Instead, they're reading transcripts in newspapers and on the Internet, transcripts compiled by journalists who have had a chance to listen.\n\nThose journalists say they hear the president and other leading figures speaking, but experts have not been able to confirm it. President Kuchma, for his part, has denied saying the things that are attributed to him.\n\nWe thought we'd give you a sense of the confusing, potentially incriminating things that are being attributed to high government officials. The transcript of a conversation as translated by the Kiev Post. You'll hear references to Ukrainska Pravda, the Internet news service where Georgiy Gongadze worked, to Gongadze himself, to the Hrani online Web site and to some Ukrainian political leaders.\n\nHere now is how a short excerpt begins.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n(voice-over): \"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"And you give me this one at Ukrainska Pravda, and we'll decide what to do with him. He's simply gone too far already.\"\n\n\"I need a case.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Do I need a case?\"\n\n\"OK.\"\n\n\"A case, we'll make one directly into copies.\"\n\n\"No, I don't need a case.\"\n\n\"Ukrainska Pravda. Well, this is completely already (expletive) insolence (expletive).\"\n\n\"The Georgian, Georgian -- Gongadze.\"\n\n\"Well, who could be financing him?\"\n\n\"Well, he actively works with this - with Moroz, with Hrani. I will (inaudible) him with Matvienko on Saturday. To court maybe. Here, people's deputies. Let the lawyers take him to court. This goes to the prosecutor, right?\"\n\n\"No, let Kravchenko say about me and also about (indecipherable) and Khalandovich.\n\n\"It's just (expletive). There is some kind of limit (expletive).\"\n\n\"Deport him. (expletive) to Georgia and throw him the (expletive) out there.\n\n\"Drive him out to Georgia and throw him there. The Chechens need to steal him and throw him away.\"\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n(on camera): That's where that particular transcript ends. We'll take this opportunity to take a break. When we come back - man whose name was mentioned in that conversation, a man who helped make the tapes public. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMANN (voice-over): Oleksandr Moroz is the leader of the Ukrainian Socialist Party. His name came up in that short exchange we heard just before the break. Moroz is an opponent of President Kuchma and the origin of at least some of the tapes that are circulating in Ukraine.\n\n(on camera): Welcome back.\n\nMoroz was in Washington this week to meet with journalists and officials. He spoke to us yesterday at this time about the situation in his country.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nOLEKSANDR MOROZ, OPPOSITION PARTY LEADER (through translator): We do experience problems in economy and politics, but what is much more important that the country now is in a political crisis, and the consequences of this crisis might be very grave.\n\nMANN: The crisis hinges on some tapes that are very mysterious. But I read that you had a role in bringing them to the public's attention. Can you tell us where the tapes came from?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): The problem is that it's not the tapes are the main reason for the crisis. The main reason for the crisis is the assassination of the journalist Gongadze, and the tapes is just a documentary evidence of the presidential participation in putting pressure on media and persecuting the journalists and putting pressure and violating the human rights.\n\nBut at this time, the tapes are in the possession of the security officer who is currently abroad.\n\nMANN: Let me ask you about the murder of Mr. Gongadze. It is officially a mystery. Do you have any idea who took his life?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): I have no doubts that law enforcement agents has played certain role in that, and there was a respective conversation in the presidential office where the chief of security service received the clear instructions that the journalist should be murdered. And I believe that the final answer to this question will be received only when the investigation of this case is completed.\n\nMANN: And yet the president denies giving that instruction. How much do you trust and how much do the people of Ukraine trust him in that matter and in others now?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): Everyone in Ukraine knows about his involvement in this case. And that I never stated that he directly instructed the - to execute him, to murder him. But he instructed his cronies to remove this individual from Ukraine so that they did.\n\nMANN: The country believes anyway it is learning a great deal because of these tapes, and the question remains who made them and how did they get out? What can you tell us?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): The tapes actually were recorded by the professional who worked in the presidential security service, and he actually made it possible to take these recordings out of the country. And his friends actually helped him to escape from Ukraine. I don't know any technical details of how these recordings were made. But he is now out of the country and he's actually unable to give any evidence of how it was done.\n\nMANN: There has been enormous public reaction to these tapes. There has been enormous public anger with many events in Ukraine. Why hasn't then there been a more widespread opposition to Mr. Kuchma, a more widespread uprising against his leadership?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): The problem is that public opinion has a certain inertia, and as compared to last December when the general public was quite passive, currently it is very, very much active. And it's not that we're - and many people since then join the movement Ukraine Without Kuchma. But it's not that we're striving just to remove the president or replace the president with somebody else.\n\nOur main goal is to change the entire system of government, system of power so that the parliament would get more role and more significance and would prevent the country from ursupation (ph) of power by a single person.\n\nMANN: And yet it is said by people in Ukraine and people outside who are watching events there that the opposition is too splintered to succeed, that there are too many different personalities, too many different policies competing. Do you think that's true?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): No, it's not true. I would say that I would disagree with you with respect to the fact that our position is splintered. It's splintered in a way that opposition represents the entire political spectra of political parties and movements. I would say that only extreme right and extreme left actually united in their support of the current leadership, meaning the president.\n\nAnd I believe and once again I would like to point out that we are not trying to remove the president. We are trying to modify, to change the system of power which would probably give us the chance to either to create a coalition or - but in any event, that would lead to a democratic election where former participants in coalition could become competitors and thereby participate in competitive struggle for the parliament, for seats in parliament.\n\nMANN: Just one last question for you, sir. There was so much optimism in the West about post-Soviet Ukraine. Some help, some money - - perhaps even a great deal of money has been poured into the country. Is that optimism, is that effort, is that money squandered now, do you think?\n\nMOROZ (through translator): First of all, concerning the money flowing into Ukraine after the breakup of Soviet Union, I want to say that this flow was not as enormous as you said. But the main reason for what happened later is that investors expected something which could not have been expected because the transformation of the economy assumed that goes in a democratic society.\n\nHowever, we have inherited from the Soviet Union administrative system of government which converted this flow of money into corruption. What we are struggling at is a democratic society which will, in combination with the market economy, would give rise to effective economy and stable society. And I believe in that, and I will put a lot of effort in order to achieve this goal.\n\nMANN: Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Ukrainian Socialist Party, we thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMOROZ (through translator): Thank you.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMANN: We had hoped to have a representative of the Kiev government on this program to respond to these allegations or one of its diplomats in another capital. Instead, the government of Ukraine declined the opportunity.\n\nWe have to take another break. When we come back - concerns far from Kiev as well. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMANN (voice-over): U.S. lawmakers visited Ukraine a week ago to take stock of events there. And policy makers in Washington have been watching closely as well. For a few years, Ukraine got more U.S. aid than any country in the world outside of the Middle East. Now the U.S. has less money and less patience with the Kuchma government.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRICHARD BOUCHER, U.S. STATE DEPT. SPOKESMAN: We regret the actions by Ukrainian law enforcement authorities this morning. They disbanded what we saw as a peaceful demonstration, which has been in place along Kiev's main street for several weeks. We do call upon the Ukrainian authorities to observe their international commitment to freedom of assembly.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has stated its commitment to resolve political issues using constitutional means, to engage in dialogue with the opposition, to take steps to conduct and conclude a transparent investigation of the Gongadze case. And we would strongly urge the government to honor those commitments.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(on camera): Joining us now to talk about Ukraine, its troubles and its friends abroad is Charles King, assistant professor of government at Georgetown University. Thanks so much for being with us.\n\nLet me start by asking you, first of all, what kind of man you think President Kuchma is.\n\nCHARLES KING, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Well, he's someone who comes very much from the Soviet system. He wasn't at the top of the old Soviet leadership in Ukraine. In fact, he succeeded someone in 1994 who was. It's for that reason, really, that the West has been so hopeful that he would have brought real change.\n\nBut what we've seen over the last six or seven years that he's been in office is a progressive attempt to increase his own power at the expense of that of parliament. And now this is the latest episode in that. And that's why people like Oleksandr Moroz are so opposed to what's going on now.\n\nMANN: Is he in serious trouble?\n\nKING: He's in very serious trouble, I think. This is probably the most serious high-level political crisis that we've seen in Ukraine really since independence. It comes on the heels of several efforts by Kuchma to extend the powers of the president to create something like Vladimir Putin has created in Russia or Nazerbayev has created in Kazakhstan. That is an extremely strong presidential post that would be able to ride roughshod over the power of parliament.\n\nSo far, most of the opposition groups in parliament, whether they're on the sort of center left or left like Moroz's group or those on the right, have been opposed to that. And they see now a real opportunity to get him out of office.\n\nMANN: Is it clear where the people of Ukraine stand? It would seem that from the few hundreds of people in the streets of Kiev over the past few weeks, there aren't a lot of people who are willing to do a lot to try to oppose this guy.\n\nKING: Well, we haven't seen the kinds of massive demonstrations that one might have expected, especially considering the extremely grave charges brought against President Kuchma. But we have seen an effort by lots of opposition groups to try to bury their differences and to seize this opportunity to effect some more thorough-going change.\n\nHowever, the opposition groups within the Ukraine reflect the divisions within Ukrainian society. The country is extremely divided over basic issues of what it means to be a Ukrainian, what Ukrainian foreign policy ought to be, what relations with Russia ought to be. And so I think if Kuchma has a chance at this stage, it's to take advantage of the divisions within the opposition and to ride things out.\n\nMANN: Those divisions aside, Ukraine had an opportunity at least, an affluence and a kind of affluence. What kind of shape is the country in?\n\nKING: It's in very bad shape economically. The IMF has repeatedly suspended disbursements of aid to Ukraine because of a lack of fundamental reform. Most of the industries within Ukraine remain under state control and are largely centralized and have not gone through the privatization process we've seen in other parts of the former Soviet Union, much less the rest of Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nThe country is extremely poor, has gotten poorer over the last decade. And I think people, rather than being fed up and willing to take to the streets to oppose Kuchma, are fed up and would rather spend their time trying to take care of their own families. That's why, really, we haven't seen much mobilization yet.\n\nMANN: Is there any reason for anyone else in the world to really care about this?\n\nKING: Well, that's the main question that people, especially in the United States often ask? Why Ukraine? Who cares about Ukraine?\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that Ukrainian independence and a strong independent and hopefully democratic Ukraine is extremely important to balances of power across Eurasia. Ukraine just in the last two or three years has emerged in its foreign policy as a kind of regional leader, a balance against Russia and Russia's growing power within the CIS.\n\nUkraine is the leader of an informal caucus known as gulong (ph) that involves five countries outside the Russian Federation. They're thought to be a kind of brake on the expansion of Russian power throughout the entire zone. So in terms of Western foreign policy, the foreign policy of the EU, the United States, it's very, very significant. And that's why this is so troubling.\n\nMANN: The last time the West seemed really concerned about internal events in Ukraine was when there were still Soviet nuclear weapons based there. Whatever happened to them and that concern?\n\nKING: Well, this has been a major concern of the United States. And especially via a program called the Nunn-Lugar program, there's been an effort to get those weapons out. But even more importantly, an effort to deal with Ukrainian scientists, people whose livelihoods have really been on the line over the last 10 years and who look to places like Libya and Iran and even Iraq as places to whom they could sell their expertise.\n\nAnd there has been a lot of effort - U.S. aid and training and money - going to try to keep those people inside Ukraine and find other jobs for them.\n\nMANN: The mystery endures. The mystery of who killed Gongadze and who really organized a technically difficult and quite daring bugging of the president's office. Do you have any guesses?\n\nKING: Well, there have been several independent reports on those tapes, and the latest one from an independent journalist in Vienna, saying that it could neither confirm nor deny the authenticity of those tape.\n\nKuchma, though, has professedly back down on this issue. He had first said that it wasn't his voice on the tapes. Then he just last week admitted that, in fact, it was his voice. But all of the snippets were taken from separate conversations that had nothing to do directly with Gongadze.\n\nSo it's clear that the president himself is a bit worried about this. It probably is his voice on there. But especially when people like Oleksandr Moroz are very interested in taking advantage of this, someone who has been a long political opponent of Kuchma, we should be wary about believing every single thing that's on the tape.\n\nMANN: So just a mystery now?\n\nKING: It still is a mystery. But what is very clear is Gongadze is no longer there, that this is illustrative of the degree to which democracy has really not taken root as much as one would have liked in Ukraine and the degree to which there are plenty of politicians, whether on the right or the left or nationalists or neo-Communists, that are very much interested in making hay out of this problem.\n\nMANN: Charles King of Georgetown University, thanks so much for talking with us.\n\nKING: Thank you.\n\nMANN: Before we go, another observation about why Western governments may be wary of Russia's continuing influence in former Soviet countries. It's not just about politics. It's also business. Russian entrepreneurs are busy buying their way into failing companies all across Eastern Europe.\n\nAnd in Ukraine, Russian firms have taken large stakes in aluminum and oil companies, among others. The Ukrainian government has tried to stop the takeovers, but with little success. Western investors may balk at dealing with the bureaucracy of Ukraine, but for Russian companies, it's business as usual, and it's good business.\n\nThat's INSIGHT for this day. I'm Jonathan Mann. The news continues.\n\nEND\n\nTO ORDER VIDEOTAPES AND TRANSCRIPTS OF CNN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE THE SECURE ONLINE ORDER FROM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
