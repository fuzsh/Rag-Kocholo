        "text": "The crisis of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, developing in\n\nthe face of the growing threat of international terrorism and the\n\ndesire of some countries to obtain the most deadly of weapons,\n\nmotivates the international community to find new ways to\n\ncounteract these developments. In the early 1990s, the author of\n\nthis article participated in negotiations for the nuclear\n\ndisarmament of Ukraine, a former Soviet republic which received its\n\nfull independence in 1991. The ‘nuclear disarmament’ of Kiev, whose\n\nnuclear arsenals exceeded those of Britain, France and China\n\ncombined, took more than two years of negotiations. The following\n\ndetails reminiscences about those negotiations. I hope our\n\nexperience will be of use to those who must address similar\n\nproblems with other countries, in a totally changed global\n\nsituation.\n\nNEW NUCLEAR POWERS\n\nOn July 31, 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet\n\nUnion, the Soviet Union and the United States signed the Treaty on\n\nthe Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (START-1),\n\nthe first treaty of its kind in history. However, before it was\n\nratified, the Soviet Union broke up, and there emerged four new\n\nstates armed with nuclear weapons – Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia (as\n\nthe successor to the Soviet Union, it inherited the right to\n\nnuclear status) and Ukraine. As a result, the entire project of\n\nstrategic offensive arms reduction stalled. The START-2 agreement,\n\nsigned by Russia and the U.S. in early 1993, became a hostage of\n\nthe START-1 ratification. Meanwhile, the signatories to the Treaty\n\non the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) planned to hold a\n\nconference in the spring of 1995 to discuss the treaty’s extension,\n\nand the newly independent countries were expected to join.\n\nBelarus and Kazakhstan made no public claims to nuclear status,\n\nand nobody expected any surprise moves from Ukraine, either. The\n\nDeclaration of State Sovereignty, adopted by the Supreme Soviet\n\n(parliament) of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on July 16,\n\n1990, proclaimed Ukraine’s intention to “become in the future a\n\npermanently neutral state that will not participate in military\n\nblocs and that will abide by three non-nuclear principles: no\n\nentry, no production, and no possession of nuclear weapons.” The\n\nnon-nuclear status was reiterated by the Ukrainian parliament after\n\nUkraine became independent.\n\nOn December 30, 1991, the leaders of the Commonwealth of\n\nIndependent States, established by former Soviet republics, met in\n\nMinsk, Belarus, where they agreed that “a decision to employ\n\nnuclear weapons shall be made by the President of the Russian\n\nFederation by agreement with the leaders of the Republic of\n\nBelarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan and Ukraine, and upon\n\nconsultations with the leaders of the other member states of the\n\nCommonwealth.” The CIS leaders also agreed that until the\n\nelimination of the nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine was\n\ncompleted, these weapons must be placed under the control of the\n\nStrategic Forces joint command in order to ensure their\n\nnon-employment and disassembly. The deadline for the disassembly\n\nwas set for the end of 1994, while the deadline for tactical\n\nnuclear weapons was July 1, 1992.\n\nOn April 18, 1992, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine signed\n\nan agreement that stipulated procedures for removing nuclear\n\nmunitions from the territory of Ukraine to sites in Russia for\n\ntheir further disassembly and elimination. In May, all tactical\n\nnuclear weapons were removed from the Ukrainian territory.\n\nFinally, in 1992, Kiev raised the issue of recognizing Ukraine,\n\nKazakhstan and Belarus as parties to the START Treaty by agreement\n\nwith the U.S. Moscow and Washington supported this proposal. In a\n\nMay 7 letter to U.S. President George Bush, his Ukrainian\n\ncounterpart, Leonid Kravchuk, guaranteed the elimination of all\n\nnuclear weapons, including strategic offensive armaments that were\n\ndeployed on the territory of Ukraine “within a period of seven\n\nyears, as stipulated by the START Treaty, and in the context of the\n\nStatement on the Non-Nuclear Status of Ukraine.”\n\nOn May 23, 1992, Russia, the United States, Ukraine, Kazakhstan\n\nand Belarus signed the Lisbon Protocol, in which all of these\n\ncountries became parties to the START Treaty. Article 5 of the\n\nprotocol bound Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to join the NPT “as\n\nnon-nuclear weapon states Parties in the shortest possible\n\ntime.”\n\nThe Lisbon Protocol also provided for the START Treaty’s\n\nratification, together with the Protocol, by all the five\n\nsignatories. Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus were to\n\nexchange instruments of ratification with the U.S., and the treaty\n\nwas to enter into force on the day of the last exchange of these\n\ninstruments. Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus were also compelled to\n\njoin the NPT.\n\nBelarus ratified the START Treaty on February 4, 1993, and\n\njoined the NPT on August 22. Kazakhstan ratified START on July 2,\n\n1992, and joined the NPT on February 14, 1994. On October 1, 1992,\n\nthe U.S. Senate gave the green light to the ratification of START,\n\nstating that Kravchuk’s May 7 letter to Bush was as valid as the\n\nprovisions of START. On November 4, 1992, the treaty was ratified\n\nby the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation.\n\nMeanwhile, there appeared alarming tendencies in Ukraine’s\n\nposition. Shortly after the country became independent, it began to\n\nrevise the principles of its foreign policy and its attitude to\n\nnuclear weapons. At first, Kiev dissociated itself from all\n\nagreements concluded within the CIS framework, as well as those\n\npertaining to the common military strategic space. None of the\n\nmilitary units stationed in Ukraine and armed with strategic\n\nnuclear weapons were included in the CIS Strategic Forces.\n\nMoreover, in April 1992, Ukraine absorbed the Strategic Forces\n\nunits that were stationed on its territory into the Ukrainian army.\n\nIt should be noted that operational maintenance of nuclear\n\nmunitions is a complex of sophisticated operations. Emergency\n\noperational maintenance of nuclear munitions must be performed at\n\nthe manufacturer’s site. Formerly, the maintenance of munitions was\n\ncontrolled from one center, which was at one of the main\n\ndirectorates of the Defense Ministry of the Soviet Union, and later\n\nRussia. However, once the Strategic Forces stationed on its\n\nterritory were under Ukrainian control, this threw the nuclear\n\nmunitions maintenance into confusion. The criteria for access to\n\nthe nuclear munitions became increasingly vague.\n\nOn December 11, 1992, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry sent a\n\nmemorandum on nuclear policy issues to all the embassies accredited\n\nin Kiev. In it, Ukraine raised the issue of its “right to own all\n\ncomponents of nuclear warheads… deployed on its territory.”\n\nAccording to the NPT, the nuclear status of a state implies its\n\npossession of “nuclear weapons” or “other nuclear explosive\n\ndevices.” By avoiding these terms in the memorandum and using in\n\ntheir place the words “all components of nuclear warheads,”\n\nUkrainian diplomats sought to evade possible accusations that it\n\nwas a claim to the possession of nuclear weapons – although “all\n\ncomponents of nuclear warheads” are necessary for constructing a\n\n“nuclear explosive device.”\n\nNUCLEAR TEMPTATION\n\nThe nuclear issue was the highlight of the Russian and Ukrainian\n\npresidents’ meeting in Moscow on January 15, 1993. President Boris\n\nYeltsin said Russia was ready to give Kiev security guarantees\n\nbefore Ukraine ratified START-1 and joined the NPT. Those\n\nguarantees would enter into force after Ukraine became a party to\n\nthe two treaties.\n\nThe presidents instructed their governments to immediately enter\n\ninto negotiations in order to resolve the many difficult issues\n\npertaining to the implementation of START-1. These would include\n\nthe terms for the disassembly, transportation and elimination of\n\nnuclear munitions deployed in Ukraine, and the recycling of nuclear\n\ncomponents for use as fuel at Ukrainian nuclear power plants.\n\nI was instructed to head the Russian delegation, and the\n\nUkrainian delegation was led by Yuri Kostenko, the minister of the\n\nenvironment and the leader of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet’s\n\nspecial working group set up to prepare START ratification. Before\n\nwe met, Kostenko, who was also one of the leaders of the\n\nnationalist Rukh party, had said that the negotiations could\n\ncontinue for another 20 or 30 years. But it was obvious to both of\n\nus that the nuclear issue, so vital for strategic stability, needed\n\nto be resolved within the shortest possible period of time.\n\nI decided against putting forward any demand proposals for\n\nUkraine. There were no alternatives to the plan set forth by\n\nRussia, since it proposed the maximum of what it could do. We\n\nplanned to acknowledge this straightforward approach to Ukraine\n\nfrom the very outset of the negotiations in order to prevent any\n\ndelay or bargaining chip. We defined the best possible conclusion\n\nof the negotiations that would fully meet all of the interests of\n\nUkraine:\n\n– all nuclear munitions of strategic nuclear weapons deployed on\n\nthe territory of Ukraine would be transported to Russia and\n\ndisposed of;\n\n– Ukraine would receive fuel for its nuclear power plants as\n\ncompensation in the amount equivalent to the amount of fissionable\n\nmaterials extracted from the nuclear munitions removed from its\n\nterritory.\n\nThe negotiations began on January 26 at the Irpen rehabilitation\n\ncenter of the Defense Ministry near Kiev. In his introductory\n\nspeech, Kostenko suddenly announced that Ukraine had a “right to\n\nown the nuclear munitions.” The speech contained no more intricate\n\nwordings like those used in the Foreign Ministry memorandum (the\n\nright to own all components of nuclear warheads). Kostenko said\n\nthat “Ukraine has made no decision yet as to where the nuclear\n\nmunitions would be disassembled, and weapon-grade uranium and\n\nplutonium recycled.”\n\nUkraine’s statement that it was the owner of nuclear weapons\n\nlocated on its territory was, in fact, a claim to being a nuclear\n\npower. In a reply statement, I responded that this statement meant\n\na change in Ukraine’s position on nuclear weapons. It signaled a\n\nretreat from the commitments assumed by Ukraine in its official\n\nacts and in the international documents signed by it within the CIS\n\nframework and in Lisbon. Naturally, it was up to Ukraine, as a\n\nsovereign and independent state, to decide what policy it should\n\npursue. But Russia, as a nuclear state and a signatory to the NPT,\n\nmust fulfill its commitments ensuing from the treaty. Namely, it\n\nhas no right to transfer nuclear weapons or control over them (be\n\nit direct or indirect), nor shall it assist or encourage any\n\nnon-nuclear state in producing or obtaining nuclear weapons in any\n\nway. Ukraine had proclaimed itself a non-nuclear state and Russia\n\ncould not become involved in the change of this status. As for the\n\nchoice of a site for the disassembly and disposal of nuclear\n\nmunitions, this issue had been resolved in an agreement on the\n\nelimination of tactical weapons, signed by the presidents of the\n\ntwo countries. Therefore, on this issue, the Ukrainian government\n\nwas revising its obligations as well.\n\nAt this point, it was necessary for me to focus on Russia’s\n\npositive proposals. In particular, Russia expressed its readiness\n\nto supply Ukraine with fuel elements for its nuclear power plants,\n\nas compensation for eliminated nuclear weapons, in amounts\n\ncorresponding to the value of fissionable materials that would be\n\nextracted from the nuclear munitions removed from Ukraine, minus\n\nRussia’s expenditures for the munitions’ disposal. Russia was also\n\nready to immediately introduce procedures for ensuring the\n\necological safety of the nuclear munitions on the Ukrainian\n\nterritory until all of them were removed.\n\nThe Ukrainian negotiators obviously felt uncomfortable about\n\nmaking a decision. They asked us not to make public their\n\nstatement, yet they did not retreat from it. We were hard-pressed\n\nto figure out why Ukraine proclaimed that it possessed nuclear\n\nweapons: was this an attempt to receive the status of a nuclear\n\nstate, or a tactical move aimed at reaping the maximum benefits for\n\nthe liquidation of the weapons?\n\nWe divided the negotiating parties into several working groups.\n\nOne, set up to address issues within the jurisdiction of the\n\ndefense ministries, was to work out a schedule for removing the\n\nnuclear weapons from Ukraine. Another, made of nuclear engineering\n\nexperts, was to establish the size of compensation for Ukraine. The\n\nthird group, which was comprised of defense industry experts, was\n\nto draft an agreement for the developer’s product support of\n\nstrategic missile systems in service with the Strategic Forces. In\n\nthe Soviet Union, missiles were made both in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union broke up, some of the Ukrainian-made\n\nmissiles remained in Russia, while Russian-made missiles remained\n\nin Ukraine. Like nuclear munitions, the missiles could be\n\nadequately maintained only by experts from the plants where they\n\nhad been produced.\n\nThe Ukrainian military delegation was led by Deputy Defense\n\nMinister Ivan Bizhan. The Russian delegation presented in writing\n\nits proposals concerning the schedule for removing nuclear\n\nmunitions from Ukraine. Our Ukrainian counterparts were not\n\nenthusiastic with the proposals, but they had no alternative\n\nproposals of their own. Instead, they made ambiguous statements,\n\nfrom which it was not clear whether Kiev was going to fulfill its\n\ncommitment to eliminate their nuclear weapons.\n\nI read the aforementioned May 7 statement of President Kravchuk\n\nto George Bush.\n\nI then approached Bizhan. “The letter speaks about the\n\nelimination of all, I repeat, all the nuclear weapons located on\n\nthe territory of Ukraine,” I said. “Can you confirm that\n\nUkraine is going to fulfill what its president wrote in this\n\nletter?”\n\nBut Bizhan again began to beat around the bush and even\n\nreproached us for “talking so much about one and the same\n\nissue.”\n\n“So, I must know, is Ukraine prepared to eliminate all of\n\nits nuclear weapons?”\n\nBut the shorter the question the longer the answer.\n\n“Let’s stop arguing,” I told Bizhan. “Let’s have a break, after\n\nwhich you will detail your position on the elimination of nuclear\n\nweapons in Ukraine in writing – the way you see it, so that we may\n\navoid false rumors.”\n\n“This will take time.”\n\n“How much?”\n\n“Well, until morning.”\n\n“OK, let’s start tomorrow morning’s session with a discussion on\n\nUkraine’s official statement.”\n\nIn the morning, however, there was no Ukrainian letter, and Yuri\n\nKostenko said that it would take Ukraine at least several days to\n\nproduce one.\n\nThings were proceeding differently with the group of nuclear\n\nengineering experts. The Ukrainian experts frankly stated that they\n\nwere afraid of miscalculating: they did not have enough data in\n\nKiev to calculate all of the possible variants for compensation in\n\norder to select the best option. This was understandable. Russia’s\n\nFirst Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy, Vitaly Konovalov, answered\n\nall their questions, yet the Ukrainians requested more and more\n\ndetails.\n\nIn the third group, the missile experts had quickly drafted an\n\nagreement on procedures for the developer’s product support of the\n\nstrategic missile systems in service with the Strategic Forces,\n\ndeployed both in Russia and Ukraine. We agreed to submit the draft\n\nagreement to the leaders of both countries, together with a\n\nproposal that the agreement be signed by the heads of government\n\nwithout delay and without any linkage to the other issues.\n\nWe handed over to the Ukrainian delegation our draft agreement\n\non the servicing of nuclear munitions, which was very simple:\n\nRussia would continue to bear responsibility for operational\n\nmaintenance of nuclear munitions, while Ukraine would provide\n\nRussian specialists with the necessary conditions for meeting this\n\nend, while ensuring the appropriate security for the facilities and\n\ntheir operation. The Ukrainian delegation responded with their own\n\ndraft, in which Russia was expected to recognize Ukraine’s right to\n\nown nuclear weapons. After discussions at a plenary meeting, the\n\nUkrainian delegation withdrew its draft but declined to accept\n\nRussia’s proposal, saying they needed more time for\n\nconsideration.\n\nThe escalation of Kiev’s nuclear ambitions grew increasingly\n\nevident. Yuri Kostenko was so obviously carried away by the\n\ndomestic aspects of this crucial problem that its international\n\nimportance escaped his attention. He believed Ukraine was so strong\n\nthat it was ready to confront any country. “The Americans tried to\n\nexert pressure on us, but we put them in their place,” he told\n\nme.\n\nThe Ukrainian delegation asked us to be restrained in our public\n\ncomments on the negotiations. However, on February 11, Russia’s\n\nNezavisimaya Gazeta carried a belligerent interview with\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, in which Russia’s\n\nposition was distorted beyond recognition. Moscow had no choice but\n\nto respond.\n\nOn February 16, as had been agreed, Ukrainian nuclear\n\nengineering experts arrived in Moscow. Under the arrangements made\n\nat Irpen, we turned over to them all the documents on the nuclear\n\nmunitions and components of missile systems in service with the\n\nStrategic Nuclear Forces stationed in Ukraine, and on the recycling\n\nof nuclear components. The Ukrainian experts said they needed time\n\nto study the documents in Kiev.\n\nOn February 24, the working group of military experts had a\n\nmeeting in Moscow. We expected the Ukrainian delegation to produce\n\na written statement concerning Ukraine’s position on the\n\nelimination of strategic offensive armaments deployed on its\n\nterritory, as well as a timeframe for such a move. However, our\n\nvisitors declined to even discuss these issues. I immediately\n\ntelephoned Kostenko.\n\nI told him, “The Foreign Ministry of Ukraine maintains that no\n\nnegotiations should be conducted on this issue. I can do nothing\n\nabout it.”\n\nFurthermore, Kiev refused to sign the agreement on producer’s\n\nwarranty and servicing of missile systems, which we had already\n\nreached at Irpen.\n\nIn the second round of negotiations in Moscow, we insisted on a\n\nclear-cut agreement for ensuring the safety of the nuclear weapons.\n\nThis issue had to be resolved without delay and could not be\n\nallowed to turn into a bargaining chip. In reply, we heard the same\n\nold song: Russia must recognize Ukraine’s right to own the nuclear\n\nmunitions. The issue of nuclear safety was so important to us that,\n\nseeing Ukraine’s reluctance to work toward a comprehensive\n\nagreement, we proposed taking the following specific measures:\n\n– remove targeting data from all nuclear weapons delivery\n\nvehicles on the territory of Ukraine before August 1, 1993;\n\n– remove the warheads and nuclear charges of\n\nintercontinental ballistic missiles to secured bases in Russia\n\nbefore August 1, 1994, for their subsequent disassembly;\n\n– reduce the alert status of the nuclear warheads on\n\nlonger-range cruise missiles carried by heavy bombers and remove\n\nthem to secure sites in Russia before August 1, 1993, for their\n\nsubsequent elimination.\n\nThere was no reply to our proposals. As for the removal of\n\nnuclear munitions from the territory of Ukraine (all the munitions,\n\nof course), the Ukrainian delegation no longer promised any more\n\nwritten statements and made only vague oral proclamations. One of\n\nmy partners told me in private: “Of course, Kravchuk is the\n\npresident of Ukraine. But do you really think he can do everything\n\nhe wants and fulfill all the agreements he has signed? Times are\n\nchanging in Ukraine.”\n\nAs a result, we achieved only one specific result: we once again\n\nagreed to sign a document on the servicing of missile systems. We\n\nsubmitted this agreement for approval by the heads of\n\ngovernment.\n\n‘CRAWLING TOWARD NUCLEAR STATUS’\n\nOn March 10, Ukraine’s Supreme Soviet held the first public\n\nhearings of the special working group led by Yuri Kostenko. He said\n\nthat “there is no more serious political group in Ukraine that\n\nwould absolutely support ratification of the START-1 Treaty or\n\naccession to the NPT.” It was said at the hearings with regard to\n\nthe nuclear weapons problem that the Declaration of the State\n\nSovereignty of Ukraine was not a commitment but only a statement of\n\n“future” intentions. Also, as a condition for ratifying START-1,\n\nUkraine demanded guarantees that it would receive all the rights of\n\nan international legal entity and an actor in international\n\nrelations as a nuclear state.\n\nIn late August, the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine in a closed-door\n\nsession discussed proposals for a military doctrine. The Ukrainian\n\ngovernment, in a bid to win parliamentary approval for its own\n\ndraft, proposed keeping 46 of the most advanced SS-24 nuclear\n\nmissiles in service with the Ukrainian armed forces. The parliament\n\ndid not support the governmental proposal, but Ukraine’s resistance\n\nto the elimination of all its nuclear weapons now came from the\n\nhighest state levels. Then came a statement from 162 Supreme Soviet\n\ndeputies (more than 30 percent of the MPs), which bluntly referred\n\nto Ukraine as a nuclear state. The deputies who signed the\n\nstatement included my vis-?-vis in the negotiations.\n\nWe never received an invitation from Kiev to continue the\n\nnegotiations. We tried to raise the nuclear issue at meetings\n\nbetween Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin and his\n\nUkrainian counterpart Leonid Kuchma in June-July 1993. I was\n\naccompanying Chernomyrdin and kept all the papers relating to the\n\nnuclear issue at hand. At the appropriate moment, the prime\n\nminister raised the nuclear weapons issue and then invited me to\n\nreport on outstanding problems. The Ukrainians listened to me but\n\nevaded serious discussions.\n\nOn July 2, there came yet another surprise. The Ukrainian\n\nSupreme Soviet passed a document entitled The Guidelines for\n\nthe Foreign Policy of Ukraine. “In view of the dramatic\n\nchanges that have taken place after the breakup of the Soviet Union\n\nand that have determined the present geopolitical position of\n\nUkraine, its plans to become a neutral and non-bloc state in the\n\nfuture, which it proclaimed earlier, should be adapted to the new\n\nrealities and cannot be considered an obstacle to its full-scale\n\nparticipation in pan-European security organizations,” the document\n\nsaid. The security organizations it mentioned included the\n\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO and the\n\nWestern European Union. Ukraine proclaimed itself “the owner of its\n\nnuclear weapons.”\n\nOn July 3, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry attached the nuclear\n\narsenals located in Ukraine to its 43rd Missile Army. The army\n\ncommander was ordered to ensure that the personnel of the nuclear\n\nweapon technical operation units take the Ukrainian oath. In May\n\n1992, the Ukrainian oath had been taken by the personnel of two\n\nnuclear weapons technical operation units of the 46th Air Army,\n\nwhich had over 600 strategic nuclear munitions. The move had given\n\nUkraine control over the munitions, as well as their use.\n\nFurthermore, the flight personnel of the strategic bombers had\n\ntaken the Ukrainian oath, too. This factor, as the chief of the\n\nRussian Armed Forces’ General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov noted,\n\nprovided Ukraine with a capability to use nuclear weapons.\n\nIn late July 1993, the Ukrainian defense minister visited the\n\nUnited States to discuss the possibility of Washington recognizing\n\nUkraine’s move to a ‘transitional nuclear status’ from the status\n\nof a ‘temporary nuclear power.’ The visit proved to be a failure.\n\nOn July 30, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliament’s Standing\n\nForeign Affairs Commission, Dmitro Pavlychko, said that Ukraine\n\nwould retain “partial nuclear status.” “Forty-six solid propellant\n\nmissiles [the most advanced SS-24 missiles] would remain in Ukraine\n\nuntil the Nonproliferation Treaty is revised in 1995,” he\n\nspecified. Commenting on the above developments, General Kolesnikov\n\nsaid that Ukraine was falling into a well-designed pattern of\n\n“crawling toward nuclear status.”\n\nOn August 5, the Russian government released a statement saying\n\nthat the moves taken by Kiev “are leading to very serious\n\nconsequences for international stability and security… A dangerous\n\nprecedent is being created, which nuclear threshold countries may\n\nuse.”\n\nIn early August, at a meeting in Moscow between Chernomyrdin and\n\nKuchma, the Russian prime minister convinced his Ukrainian\n\ncounterpart to receive me in Kiev for continuing the negotiations.\n\nIn my trip to the Ukrainian capital, I was accompanied by Atomic\n\nEnergy Minister Victor Mikhailov. By the end of the second day of\n\nthe negotiations, we had resolved all the issues on our agenda,\n\nexcept for the timeframe for removing nuclear weapons from Ukraine.\n\nWe reached agreement on the elimination of all the nuclear\n\nmunitions located in Ukraine, on their disposal in Russia, and on\n\nprocedures for the settlement of the operations. By way of\n\ncompensation, Ukraine would receive fuel assemblies for its nuclear\n\npower plants. Russia’s expenditures for its supplies were to be\n\ncompensated for with sales from part of the uranium to be extracted\n\nfrom the nuclear munitions removed from Ukraine. Ukraine’s right to\n\nown the nuclear weapons was no longer mentioned.\n\nThe arrangements were formulated in three draft agreements:\n\n– an agreement for the disposal of nuclear munitions;\n\n– the main principles for disposing of nuclear munitions in\n\nservice with the Strategic Forces stationed in Ukraine;\n\n– an agreement on procedures for the developer’s product support\n\nof the operation of strategic missile systems in service with the\n\nStrategic Forces stationed on the territories of Russia and\n\nUkraine.\n\nThis was an important breakthrough considering the growing\n\ninternational concern over Ukraine’s nuclear weapons and the\n\nratification of the START-1 Treaty. In early July, at a G-7 summit\n\nin Tokyo, presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton agreed to\n\nassign a tripartite format to the negotiations on START-1\n\nratification: Russia–U.S.–Ukraine. The first working meeting within\n\nthis framework was to be held in London immediately after the\n\nbilateral negotiations in Kiev. However, we actually managed to\n\nresolve all of the issues in Kiev, and I was part of the Russian\n\nteam that was leaving for London for the tripartite negotiations.\n\nOur delegation was led by Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov.\n\nThe U.S. was represented by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe\n\nTalbott.\n\nThe draft agreements that I brought to London solved all of the\n\nprimary questions surrounding this grave international problem. It\n\nwould seem the U.S. negotiator should be happy or, at least,\n\nsatisfied to hear the news. However, Talbott, in reaction to the\n\npositive news, only commented that he would like to discuss the\n\ndraft agreements with U.S. experts. The latter were more ingenuous\n\nand admitted that they did not believe that we would be able to\n\nreach agreement with the Ukrainians without U.S. mediation. When\n\nthe U.S. experts saw that the draft agreements were solid and did\n\nnot need any additions or specifications, they congratulated us and\n\nsaid with a smile that there was nothing further to discuss. This\n\nwas the reason, perhaps, for Talbott’s disappointment.\n\nOn September 3, the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met at\n\nMassandra, in the Crimea, where they quickly approved all three\n\ndraft agreements which prime ministers Chernomyrdin and Kuchma were\n\nto sign, as well as the only remaining outstanding issue – the\n\ntimeframe for the removal of strategic nuclear weapons from the\n\nterritory of Ukraine. The parties agreed that the weapons would be\n\nremoved within 24 months after Ukraine ratified START-1. Naturally,\n\nall the weapons were to be removed, as was written in the\n\ndraft agreements. This issue was of crucial importance, so the\n\nparties decided to formalize the latter agreement in a special\n\nconfidential protocol. The moment of truth was quickly approaching.\n\nPerhaps, that was why bitter disagreements broke out in Ukraine\n\nover the nuclear weapons issue. Defense Minister Konstantin Morozov\n\nat a plenary meeting launched an attack against his own president\n\nby criticizing the agreements that had been reached. Ukrainian\n\nPresident Kravchuk did not agree with him, and the Ukrainian party\n\nthat was preparing the final texts of the documents, including the\n\npresidential team, made every effort to distort the essence of\n\nMorozov’s arguments. The diplomatic showdown reached the intensity\n\nof hand-to-hand combat. But the Ukrainian delegation failed to\n\nchange anything in any of the three draft agreements. The protocol\n\non the removal of all nuclear munitions was brief and well-worded,\n\ntoo. Strictly speaking, there was nothing else to negotiate.\n\nI will describe what happened next with a quotation from the\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry’s September 21 official press release:\n\n“The newspaper Kievskiye Vedomosti of September 9, 1993,\n\npublished a photocopy of The Protocol on the Removal of All\n\nNuclear Munitions of the Strategic Nuclear Forces, Stationed in\n\nUkraine, to Russia. In this connection, the Foreign Ministry\n\nof the Russian Federation is authorized to state the following:\n\n“During the September 3 meeting at Massandra between the\n\npresidents of Russia and Ukraine, an arrangement was reached that\n\nall nuclear munitions of the Strategic Nuclear Forces stationed in\n\nUkraine would be taken to Russia not later than 24 months since the\n\nday of ratification of the START-1 Treaty by Ukraine. The essence\n\nof this arrangement is reflected, as evident from the photocopy, in\n\nthe name of the document, which contains the word ‘all.’ The\n\npresidents decided that the document would be confidential and\n\nwould be signed by the heads of government. Moreover, the prime\n\nministers signed the prepared document in the following\n\nwording:\n\n“‘The President of the Russian Federation and the President of\n\nUkraine agreed that, after the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine ratifies\n\nthe START-1 Treaty, the government of Ukraine shall ensure the\n\nremoval of all nuclear munitions of the Strategic Nuclear Forces,\n\nstationed in Ukraine, to the Russian Federation not later than 24\n\nmonths since the day of ratification for their subsequent\n\ndisassembly and elimination.’\n\n“However, Ukraine’s presidential adviser A. Buteiko took\n\nadvantage of the situation when the documents fell into his hands;\n\nhe made two alterations to the text, which completely changed the\n\ncontent of the arrangement. The changes are clearly seen in the\n\nphotocopy published in Kiev: the word ‘all’ was crossed out and\n\nafter the words ‘the Strategic Nuclear Forces’ the words ‘falling\n\nunder the treaty’ were inserted. What these corrections meant was\n\nthat Ukraine (or rather a certain part of the governmental\n\napparatus), contrary to its international commitments, hoped to\n\nreserve a part of the nuclear weapons.\n\n“Despite a top-level protest from the Russian Party, the\n\nrepresentatives of Ukraine declined to restore the former text. In\n\nview of such actions by the Ukrainian Party which are, to put it\n\nmildly, unusual for diplomatic practices, the Russian Party\n\nofficially annulled this Protocol, about which the representatives\n\nof Ukraine were immediately informed.\n\n“So, legally, the Protocol on the Removal of All Nuclear\n\nMunitions of the Strategic Nuclear Forces, Stationed in Ukraine, to\n\nthe Russian Federation does not exist as a document, which, of\n\ncourse, in no way affected the essence of the arrangements reached\n\nbetween Russia and Ukraine at the level of the heads of state and\n\ngovernment.”\n\nIn mid-November, an open crisis broke out in the Ukrainian\n\nSupreme Soviet over the START-1 ratification issue. President\n\nKravchuk’s proposal to ratify the package of the above three\n\ndocuments received less than 170 votes of the required 221 in a\n\nparliamentary vote. On November 18, however, the Supreme Soviet\n\npassed a resolution entitled On the Ratification of the Treaty\n\nBetween the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. on the Reduction and Limitation\n\nof Strategic Offensive Arms, Signed in Moscow on July 31, 1991, and\n\nIts Protocol, Signed in Lisbon on Behalf of Ukraine on May 23,\n\n1992. But the government of Russia justly described the\n\nresolution as “an outrage upon the important international\n\ndocuments, the basic provisions of which were actually made null\n\nand void by the Ukrainian legislators.”\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Soviet came out with a series of\n\nprovisos. Among others, it proclaimed Ukraine’s state ownership of\n\nnuclear weapons; turned down Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol,\n\nwhich contained Ukraine’s commitment to join the NPT; declared\n\nUkraine’s plans not to eliminate all of their nuclear weapons that\n\nremained on the Ukrainian territory, but only 36 percent of the\n\nlaunch vehicles and 42 percent of the nuclear munitions, leaving\n\nthe rest of the nuclear-missile arsenal to Ukraine.\n\nInternational law cannot recognize the ratification of a\n\ntreaty if its provisos are incompatible with its subject and terms.\n\nUkraine formulated a new document which was convenient for certain\n\npolitical forces in Kiev and which had nothing in common with the\n\nSTART-1 Treaty. In view of this fact, the government of Russia\n\ndeclared that the decision of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine with\n\nregard to START-1 could not be recognized. A similar statement was\n\nreleased by Washington.\n\nPresident Kravchuk described Ukraine’s failed accession to the\n\nNPT as “a major political mistake” of the Supreme Soviet which\n\n“delivered a colossal blow to Ukraine’s authority and its\n\ninternational prestige.” As the head of state admitted later, “we\n\nwere on the brink of an economic blockade and international\n\nisolation.”\n\nCould Ukraine really have become a nuclear power? Theoretically,\n\nyes. The country has the required research and technological\n\npotentials to support this technology. But here is what Minister\n\nVictor Mikhailov, an outstanding authority in this field, wrote in\n\n1994: “It would take many decades for Ukraine to become a nuclear\n\npower – and funds which it does not have… One can master anything.\n\nBut what would it cost!… The entire country worked to build our\n\n[Soviet – Y.D.] nuclear complex. Russia’s nuclear complex is now\n\nestimated at about five billion dollars. We need corresponding\n\nresearch facilities, specialists with required professional skills,\n\nas well as the infrastructure.”\n\nShortly after the Supreme Soviet’s decision, Leonid Kravchuk\n\nmade a remarkable statement in a televised interview: “I asked my\n\nopponents the question, ‘Who are our weapons aimed at?’ If we are\n\nto retarget our missiles, we must choose a target to aim the\n\nmissiles. Let us suppose that we choose a target. What will the\n\nreaction be in a situation where no one aims their missiles at us\n\nwhile we choose an ‘enemy’ to target our missiles? What will be the\n\ninternational reaction and attitude toward Ukraine?”\n\nTHE LAST MILE\n\nDespite the unfavorable developments in Kiev, Russia continued\n\nto press Ukraine to make decisions that would meet the interests of\n\nthe international community. On January 14, 1994, tripartite\n\nagreements with the presidents of Russia, the U.S. and Ukraine were\n\nsigned in Moscow. A supplementary document stated Ukraine’s key\n\ncommitments to completely fulfill its obligations with regard to\n\nall the nuclear weapons remaining on the Ukrainian territory, and\n\nterms for the supply of fuel assemblies for Ukrainian nuclear power\n\nplants as compensation. Security guarantees were granted to Ukraine\n\nby Russia and the U.S. once the START-1 Treaty entered into force\n\nand as soon as Ukraine became a non-nuclear signatory to the NPT.\n\nThe United States offered to give Russia U.S. $60 million as\n\nprepayment to cover Russia’s expenditures for the disassembly of\n\nstrategic munitions and the manufacture of fuel assemblies. The\n\nmoney was to be deducted from payments due to Russia under a\n\nRussian-U.S. contract on highly enriched uranium.\n\nThe Ukrainian Supreme Soviet discussed the tripartite\n\nagreements on February 4, 1994. In the resolution, it withdrew its\n\nreservations concerning Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, thus\n\nopening up the possibility of Ukraine joining the NPT. The\n\ngovernment was instructed to exchange instruments of START\n\nratification and increase its efforts to conclude interstate\n\nagreements aimed at fulfilling the Supreme Soviet’s November 18,\n\n1993 resolution. On May 10, 1994, the prime ministers of Russia and\n\nUkraine signed an agreement for the implementation of the\n\ntripartite arrangements reached by the presidents of Russia, the\n\nU.S. and Ukraine.\n\nAfter a series of elections in Ukraine, the process of the START\n\nratification and accession to the NPT had to be completed by the\n\nnew Ukrainian president, Leonid Kuchma. On November 16, 1994, the\n\nSupreme Soviet passed a law on Ukraine’s accession to the NPT.\n\nHowever, the law once again contained several reservations, one of\n\nwhich stated: “Ukraine is the owner of the nuclear weapons which it\n\nhas inherited from the ex-U.S.S.R.” The restoration of the\n\nlong-withdrawn claim again brought back to the agenda the issue of\n\nUkraine’s status as an NPT signatory: non-nuclear, as it was bound\n\nby its international commitments, or as a new nuclear state. The\n\nposition of Ukraine’s top legislative body was quite clear,\n\nhowever: being the owner of nuclear weapons meant being a nuclear\n\nstate.\n\nKiev trumpeted its victory, emphasizing the effort the country’s\n\nleadership had made in order to overcome the resistance of deputies\n\nwho opposed Ukraine’s accession to the NPT. Kuchma made a\n\npassionate speech, saying that it would take at least U.S. $160-200\n\nbillion in investment within ten years to launch the closed-cycle\n\nproduction of nuclear munitions. “Who amongst the advocates of\n\nnuclear games can stand up and tell us to whom we should sell or\n\npawn all of Ukraine’s property, just to obtain a nuclear arsenal\n\nfor ourselves and make ‘happy’?” he asked.\n\nYet, the fact that only a few deputies voted against the law on\n\naccession to the NPT indicated that the reservations it contained\n\nwere so far-reaching that they satisfied even the advocates of a\n\nnuclear status for Ukraine. Indeed, what more could the champions\n\nof “nuclear games” demand when the law declared that Ukraine was\n\njoining the NPT as an owner of nuclear weapons? Recognition by the\n\ninternational community of Ukraine’s accession to the treaty on\n\nsuch terms would mean recognition of its nuclear status. That would\n\nbe their victory.\n\nOn the following day, November 17, Russia’s Foreign Ministry\n\ncame out with the following statement: “Moscow appreciates the\n\nUkrainian leadership’s efforts to resolve the issue of Ukraine’s\n\naccession to the Nonproliferation Treaty of July 1, 1968. In this\n\nconnection, we were satisfied to hear the news that the Supreme\n\nSoviet of Ukraine yesterday passed a law on accession to this\n\nTreaty.\n\n“At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the adopted\n\nlaw stipulated some conditions. The content of these terms makes\n\nunclear the status – nuclear or non-nuclear – in which Ukraine is\n\nplanning to join the NPT… These questions must be answered because\n\nthe NPT depositaries are now completing the drafting of a document\n\non security guarantees for Ukraine, which are planned to be given\n\nto it as a state not possessing nuclear weapons. The importance of\n\nclarifying these issues is quite understandable.”\n\nKiev’s reaction to the questions put by Moscow was keenly\n\nsensitive. However, answers to these questions were demanded not\n\nonly by Russia but the entire international community. The tensions\n\ncame to a head at the CSCE summit in Budapest, where Ukraine was to\n\nprovide the instruments of accession to the NPT, and Russia, the\n\nU.S., Britain and Ukraine were to sign a memorandum on security\n\nguarantees for Kiev. Ukraine was in a dilemma whether to officially\n\nspecify its status of a state not possessing nuclear weapons, thus\n\nreceiving security guarantees, or decline and send the entire range\n\nof issues back to the negotiating table.\n\nOn the eve of December 5, the day the ceremony was to be held,\n\nthe parties were engaged in intensive negotiations which continued\n\nthroughout the night. By the morning, Ukraine had prepared a\n\nForeign Ministry note on its accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear\n\nstate (not possessing nuclear weapons). The Izvestia newspaper\n\nwrote on the following day: “When President Leonid Kuchma of\n\nUkraine handed the document on his country’s accession to the\n\nNonproliferation Treaty to Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and John\n\nMajor, the hall where the CSCE Budapest summit was held gave a sigh\n\nof relief.”"
