        "text": "Ukraine changed forever following its 2004 presidential\n\nelection, as did relations between Moscow and Kiev. The bitter\n\nfeelings that this situation produces are not related to Russia’s\n\ndefeat in this battle, but to the helplessness of its political\n\nwarriors. The mercenary fighters have dispersed, leaving the\n\nwounded Supreme Commander behind on the battlefield. The engineers\n\nof Russia’s political technologies are offering endless assurances\n\nthat they were not responsible for losing Ukraine. Several\n\npoliticians are rushing to Kiev in order to become associated with\n\nthe “great victory on Maidan,” while the most ardent proponents of\n\ndemocracy are demanding that the Russian government provide\n\nmaterial backing to the new Ukrainian authorities.\n\nDoes all of this equate to capitulation?\n\nTHE AMERICAN CHALLENGE\n\nTo understand what really happened, let us rewind a few years\n\nback and stop in the fall of 1999, the most heated period of\n\nRussia’s parliamentary election race. At that time, high stakes\n\nwere involved in the battle for majority seats in the State Duma,\n\nnot to mention the race for the presidency. A life and death\n\nstruggle was underway in Russia. Obviously, the internal affairs of\n\nRussia’s neighbor seemed trivial at that time.\n\nMeanwhile, on November 14 of the same year, the Ukrainians held\n\nthe second round of their presidential election; President Leonid\n\nKuchma received approximately 60 percent of the votes to emerge\n\nvictorious against Petro Simonenko, the Communist Party leader. In\n\nother words, one month before the Russian elections, Kuchma had\n\nalready secured for himself a second term of office.\n\nThose elections in Ukraine were practically a full remake of the\n\n1996 elections in Russia. Businessman Boris Berezovsky had\n\npropelled Russia’s political technologies to the celestial heights\n\nof Ukrainian politics. All the fine details of the plot had been\n\nreplicated. In the 1999 election race, Yevgeny Marchuk, Ukraine’s\n\nequivalent of the late Russian General Alexander Lebed, had\n\ndestroyed the coalition of non-Communist oppositionists. In the\n\nsecond round, Kuchma ran against Simonenko, Ukraine’s equivalent of\n\nRussia’s Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Eventually, the forces\n\nof progress triumphed over the ghosts from the past.\n\nI do not want to sound too much like a Cassandra, but here is what\n\nI wrote in Nezavisimaya Gazeta on the eve of the second round of\n\nthe Ukrainian election 1999: “The main outcome of this election is\n\nthe discrediting of democratic procedures taken per se, and its\n\nimpact will be long lasting. Independent Ukraine has not yet seen\n\nsuch a scale of intimidation, threats and misuse of power. Whatever\n\nthe finale of the second round may be, it holds no promise of\n\nending the current crisis. On the contrary, it is fraught with\n\nincreasing destabilization.”\n\nThis did not seem to worry President Kuchma in the least,\n\nhowever. After all, he did achieve the impossible. In 1994, he won\n\nthe presidential race against a rival from western Ukraine much the\n\nsame way his predecessor, Leonid Kravchuk, did in 1991. Kuchma came\n\nto power as a representative of the country’s Russian-speaking yet\n\nmulti-ethnic eastern regions. Much like Kravchuk, he did not\n\nfulfill a single pre-election promise, but unlike his predecessor,\n\nhe was re-elected.\n\nAll was quiet on the foreign policy front as well. On May 31,\n\n1997, the Ukrainian and Russian presidents signed a bilateral\n\nTreaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership. This did not\n\nstop Kuchma, however, from signing a Charter on a Distinctive\n\nPartnership between Ukraine and NATO on July 9 of the same year.\n\nThose Russians who expressed their doubts over the sincerity of\n\nKiev’s intentions were silenced by the ratification – on the eve of\n\nthe 1999 election – of the Russia-Ukraine agreement in both houses\n\nof the Russian parliament.\n\nKuchma did not realize one thing, though: as soon as this\n\ndocument went into effect, at least one of the parties involved –\n\nthe West, with the U.S. at the head – would not have a pretext any\n\nlonger for closing its eyes to the corrupt practices of his\n\nadministration. For Western strategy planners, Ukraine was more\n\nsignificant as a means for curbing Russia’s ambitions. Kuchma was\n\ntolerated for the simple reason that he – the winner of the Lenin\n\nPrize for missile construction – was the only man with whom\n\nYeltsin’s Russia was ready to sign a document that would finally\n\nfix Ukraine’s independence despite its litigious state borders; the\n\ndocument also failed to outline any guarantees of friendship,\n\nparameters of cooperation, or terms of partnership. Once Kuchma\n\nfinished his chores, he would be free to go. His task was to give\n\nway to a new, more advanced individual who would be more\n\ntransparent for the West. This new politician was supposed to lead\n\nUkraine into the next stage of divorce from Russia.\n\nSoon, events began to look like a political blockbuster. First,\n\nthere was the disappearance of the provocative journalist Georgy\n\nGongadze, whose decapitated body was discovered in a beech forest\n\noutside Kiev. Next, a noble major of the security service, Mykola\n\nMelnichenko, recorded the president’s allegedly incriminating\n\nconversations and turned the tapes over to the ‘saintly’\n\noppositionist Alexander Moroz, who publicly accused the president\n\nof involvement in the murder of Gongadze. The major was then\n\ngranted political asylum in the U.S. Pavlo Lazarenko, a former\n\nUkrainian premier and also Moroz’s sponsor and employer of another\n\nprominent oppositionist, Yulia Timoshenko, was imprisoned in the\n\nU.S. at this time and disclosing the developments in Ukraine to\n\nU.S. investigators.\n\nA campaign entitled “Ukraine Minus Kuchma” had begun.\n\nCondoleezza Rice called Kuchma “a Slavic Mobutu” [Mobutu Sese Seko,\n\npresident of Zaire from 1965 to 1997, became synonymous with\n\ncorruption – Ed.] and, following in the footsteps of George Soros,\n\nrevealed the name of a new Ukrainian Redeemer – Victor Yushchenko,\n\nstill a prime minister and one of Kuchma’s disciples. Note that all\n\nof this occurred within less than a year after Kuchma had handed\n\npresidential powers to himself upon re-election.\n\nTHE PATHS WE CHOOSE\n\nMay the Lord save us from believing that all of these events\n\nwere the product of some witty Jewish or Masonic or Polish-American\n\nplot. Throughout Ukraine’s independence, its authorities had been\n\ngathering brushwood for the fire with their own hands. The\n\nAmericans simply grasped at the situation in order to implement\n\nreplacement of yet another thieving Roh Tae Woo by a standard Kim\n\nYong Sam – a regular martyr in the name of truth [the\n\nadministration of the South Korean President Ro Tae Woo was engaged\n\nin financial machinations and President Kim Yong Sam came to power\n\nin 1992 – Ed.]. Both candidates sought friendship with the world’s\n\nonly superpower (What else did they have to do?), but the\n\nsuperpower found the democrat more instrumental than the dictator\n\nwho was mired in corruption. No personal affections – as another\n\npresidential term comes to an end, the situation will be replayed,\n\nalthough with different names in the cast.\n\nIt may be supposed that Russia could benefit from the experience\n\nof another nation like Ukraine, since both countries make up an\n\ninseparable part of each other’s past and present. The\n\nRussian-Ukrainian bond goes back centuries, and Ukraine was the\n\nlast decisive factor in the disintegration of the unified Soviet\n\nstate in 1991. Ukraine’s independence put Russia to a harsh test,\n\nas it had to abandon the most promising territory that was becoming\n\noriented toward Europe. This caused contemporary Russia to draw\n\nback its borders to its present size. If independent Ukraine lacks\n\na special union with Russia, its independence will unavoidably be\n\nplaced on an anti-Russian foundation. Ukraine may then turn into a\n\nsecond Poland – an alien cultural and historical project that\n\nRussia will have to learn to deal with, or else Ukraine set about\n\nRussia itself.\n\nThere was nothing wrong about Putin taking up the glove that had\n\nbeen thrown to him. Nor was it wrong that Russia – which had been\n\nmade a prey under Yeltsin and had ceded one position after another\n\n– decided to engage in the struggle. Staying away from the fight\n\nfor Ukraine at a time when everyone else was flexing their muscles\n\nwould have been foolish for Russia. But how should it have\n\nfought?\n\nFirst of all, Russia owed nothing to Kravchuk or Kuchma. On the\n\ncontrary, by fully supporting the democratization process in\n\nUkraine, Moscow could have brought into the limelight the broad\n\nranks of pro-Russian forces which Kiev had fervently black-painted\n\nfor years and forced them into a semi-legal status. However, Moscow\n\nwas unfamiliar with such an approach and thus chose a different\n\ngenre of actions. (The Russian authorities are trying hard now to\n\njustify themselves by saying they “did not work with opposition\n\nforces anywhere in the CIS.” This argument does not stand up to\n\ncriticism. History taught us such lessons: the slogan “Our Dignity\n\nIs in Fidelity,” Czar Nicholas I, the Holy Union, and the Crimean\n\nWar as the final verdict.) The Kremlin assured itself that Kuchma\n\nwas a guarantor of Russian-Ukrainian relations and rushed to rescue\n\nhim at a time when he was being intimidated by boycotts, an\n\ninvestigation, possible imprisonment and general misery.\n\nThe Russian authorities made a correct decision to engage in\n\nstruggle at a time when staying aloof was impossible; however, they\n\nstaked their bets on the wrong horse – partly owing to the elite\n\nPutin had inherited. Over the previous years, it had made nice\n\nprofits on questionable transactions with Ukrainian counteragents –\n\nin co-embezzling of natural gas and exports/imports of electoral\n\ntechnologies. On this point, I must quote another one of my own\n\nprophesies: “No doubt, any scenario poses certain risks for Russia,\n\nbut they grow manifold if stakes are made on Kuchma, whose power is\n\nwaning, as an option without an alternative. Sooner or later the\n\nWest will force Kuchma to surrender to the mercy of Victor\n\nYushchenko – that is, to the part of the opposition that is looking\n\nstrictly westward. Russia’s present policy toward Ukraine is again\n\nmaking Putin’s strong Russia a hostage to Kuchma’s weak Ukraine”\n\n[Novaya Gazeta, November 11, 2002].\n\nThus, both of the main actors, the U.S. and Russia, made open\n\nstakes that ruled out any compromise. The Americans have poorer\n\nknowledge of Ukraine than the Russians do and it appears they wrote\n\nKuchma off too early. But Washington had a durability resource from\n\nthe very start – the Americans knew perfectly well what they had to\n\ndo to reach their goals. Against this background, Russia’s\n\ninflexible policy still lacks an understanding of what can provide\n\nreliable guarantees of a “special relationship” with Ukraine.\n\nThat kind of relationship cannot be maintained through one-sided\n\npolitical or economic concessions. Nor can it be maintained through\n\nself-imposed moratoriums which are primarily concerned with\n\ndefending Russia’s own interests in exchange for Ukraine’s\n\ngratitude. No agreement at the top, including support of the\n\nincumbent president or a friendly candidate for the post, will\n\nprovide any definite guarantees. Nor will the successful advance of\n\nRussian finances on the Ukrainian market provide a guarantee of a\n\nspecial bilateral relationship; unlike Western businesses, the\n\nRussian business community has not yet learned how to secure\n\nnational interests. Actually, there are only three guarantees of,\n\nand/or conditions for, genuine Russian-Ukrainian friendship,\n\ncooperation, and partnership: the democratization of Ukraine\n\nthrough decentralization and its transformation into a federation;\n\nacceptance of the Russian language as Ukraine’s second state\n\nlanguage (to prevent a further assimilation of the Russian-speaking\n\npopulation); and the preservation of the Moscow Patriarchate’s\n\ninfluence amongst the numerous followers of the Ukrainian Orthodox\n\nChurch, that is, maintaining the unity of the two countries in the\n\nreligious sphere.\n\nBy securing a pro-Russian politician in the person of the\n\nincumbent president (Kuchma), Russia was not obliged to adopt his\n\nvision of things. Moscow should have used the extra time for\n\nsecuring guarantees in the post-Kuchma period. But Russia’s efforts\n\nwere not evenly distributed in different directions. The Kremlin\n\nfailed to work properly with Ukrainian political parties, public\n\nassociations, political experts, journalists, regional elites and\n\nthe population. Generally speaking, the executive is unable to\n\naddress such complicated tasks without the support of parliament,\n\npolitical and expert communities and society in general. Russia’s\n\nlack of credible institutions within civil society, together with\n\nthe lack of state support for their activities, resulted in\n\nRussia’s defeat against Western institutions, foundations, centers\n\nand grants in the battle to win over public opinion in Kiev.\n\nPolitical technologists tried to make up for the glaring inadequacy\n\nof Russia’s instruments of influence by using Putin’s popular\n\nratings, as well as his active participation. The final result\n\nproduced the unsettling image of an isolated warrior stranded on\n\nthe battlefield. Apart from Putin’s efforts, individual officials\n\nfrom both countries maintained their contacts – or rather the\n\npretences of contacts. But Russia’s numerous hands meddling in\n\nUkrainian politics only served to spoil the soup. Instead of\n\nbureaucratic mobilization, discipline and accountability, the\n\nRussian authorities demonstrated chaos and departmental deviations\n\nfrom the general course. The damage was finally done, it seems, by\n\nthe activities of the Russian embassy in Kiev where Victor\n\nChernomyrdin is ambassador. He seemed to care for anything –\n\nespecially the interests of his friends and clients, including\n\nKuchma – except for ensuring Russia’s guarantees.\n\nUkrainian voters were regarded as target objects of more or less\n\nintricate political technologies that had replaced a clear strategy\n\nand understanding of the goals. Besides, the technologists were\n\nbusy with self-promotion, which created an overblown impression of\n\ntheir importance and eventually did ill service to their clients.\n\nThe bureaucrats were busy entertaining themselves at informal\n\nmeetings, engaging in elaborate festivities, such as “The Year of\n\nRussia in Ukraine” and “The Year of Ukraine in Russia,” and\n\nindoctrinating ethnic Ukrainians living in this country.\n\nEventually, they developed a feeling that genuine progress was\n\nbeing made in the Ukrainian direction.\n\nThe truth is, however, that all of the participants failed to\n\nperform properly.\n\nIS UKRAINE NOT RUSSIA?\n\nAlthough it is true that the U.S. and Europe competed against\n\nRussia for Ukraine, this does not mean that the main Ukrainian\n\ncandidates simply performed as puppets. The eastern and western\n\nregions of Ukraine had their say in the story, as well.\n\nLong before the end of the political drama, I commented that the\n\npeople who were claiming that the 2004 election would predestine\n\nthe future of Ukrainian democracy were either mistaken or simply\n\nlying. It predestined – inconclusively, as it appears – the future\n\nof Ukraine as an integral state, be it democratic or authoritarian.\n\nIn the first round, Victor Yushchenko received popular support from\n\na total of 16 western and central regions, in addition to the\n\ncapital of Kiev. Victor Yanukovich emerged victorious in 9 regions\n\nof eastern and southern Ukraine, as well as in Sevastopol. The\n\nresult was the same in the abortive runoff round and the repeat\n\nrunoff, despite the betrayal of people responsible for the\n\nadministrative resource and Kuchma’s flight from the Yanukovich\n\ncamp.\n\nUkrainians voted for a friend versus a foe, not for a rightist\n\ncandidate versus a leftist candidate. Yanukovich was considered to\n\nbe a foe in the western regions, while Yushchenko had that\n\nreputation in the east. This split disrupted the candidates’\n\nelectoral strategies. Contrary to Yushchenko’s expectations, he did\n\nnot succeed in uniting all of Kuchma’s adversaries in the eastern\n\nregions, while Yanukovich – despite being the Prime Minister –\n\nfailed to represent the all-nation power for the voters in the\n\nwestern regions.\n\nOnce again, Ukraine split into two camps and painted itself\n\ndifferent colors. Neither the U.S., nor Russia, nor the two\n\ncandidates, nor the mythically omnipotent Russian political\n\ntechnologists, ever planned for such an event. As it turned out, no\n\none proved able to draw conclusions from the genuine Ukrainian\n\nelection of 1991 and 1994 (as I said above, the 1999 election was a\n\ntotal sham).\n\nTo understand why Ukraine’s political geography has not changed\n\na bit over more than a decade of independence (the east and west,\n\nexcluding rebellious Kiev, remain as staunch as ever), let us go\n\nback to the year 1991 when independence suddenly descended upon the\n\nUkrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. At that moment, Ukraine became\n\ntruly independent for the first time in its history, unless you\n\ncount as “full-fledged statehood” the endless hetmans, military\n\nchiefs or directories during the years of the Russian Civil War\n\n[1918 to 1922 – Ed.]. (Strictly speaking, then, the Volga region,\n\nSiberia and the Far-Eastern Republic would have had equal reasons\n\nto claim state sovereignty.) No one but a handful of Ukrainian\n\ndissidents had ever dreamt of an independent Ukraine before, to say\n\nnothing of fighting for it with arms. Simply, the Ukrainian\n\nnomenklatura that stood at the helm at that time used the situation\n\nto fence itself off from the unpredictable restructuring and\n\ncentral government in Moscow.\n\nThe politicians of that time did not have any plan or program\n\nfor building an independent state; they simply could not grasp the\n\nfull idea of what was happening. Therefore, they borrowed an\n\nideological base from their recent enemies, the secessionists of\n\nwestern Ukraine, who were historically alien to the concept of\n\nRussian-Ukrainian unity. Many people believed that the essential\n\npart of the new Ukrainian state was building a nation that would be\n\nindependent of Russia.\n\nThis unwritten plan was clear to everyone in the West and was\n\nimplemented with great persistence. Ukraine was supposed to\n\nreorient all of its relations from the East to the West, except for\n\nthe inescapable economic ties. It was to renounce its plans of\n\nintegration with Russia and replace them by integration with the\n\nWest, including the most fantastic projects – with Poland or\n\nTurkey. Ukraine was to compete with Russia for military and\n\npolitical influence in the post-Soviet space and bid for accession\n\nto NATO and the European Union, even though the latter\n\norganizations might not desire Ukrainian participation. An\n\ninalienable part of the plan called for the swift assimilation of\n\nRussians and other Russian-speaking residents. Due to this policy,\n\nbetween the 1989 and 2002 censuses, a quarter of the Russian\n\npopulation dissolved into a “unified Ukrainian nation.” To this\n\nend, the authorities slashed the number of Russian schools and the\n\nairtime of Russian radio and television programs. Moreover, the\n\nattempts of the eastern regions and the Crimea to claim original\n\ncultural or language identity were crushed.\n\nKravchuk and Kuchma, both candidates of the east-Ukrainian\n\nregions, were victorious against candidates from the west at the\n\npresidential elections. At the same time, both men squandered their\n\nchances, although at different periods of time and in different\n\nways.\n\nTWO UKRAINES\n\nUkrainian self-determination victimized the eastern regions.\n\n‘Ukrainizers’ felt apprehension toward those territories, as well\n\nas the Crimea and some southern regions adjoining the Black Sea.\n\nThey denied their population the right to read and think in their\n\nnative tongue, forcing their children to read books, for example,\n\nby Ukrainian-born, Russian-language writer, Nikolai Gogol, in\n\nUkrainian translations. People in the east and south who were\n\naccustomed to living in a single political and cultural space with\n\nRussia for centuries, now saw that the newly built state was put on\n\na completely hostile foundation. On the face of it, they had to pay\n\nfor the adventures ordered by others. Suffice it to say that two\n\neastern regions, Donetsk and Dnepropetrovsk, account for more than\n\na quarter of Ukraine’s budget revenues. The east was to become\n\nrestive sooner or later: naturally, it would desire to command the\n\nadventures it was supposed to pay for.\n\nThe east rebelled during the recent election campaign. While\n\nfilling out the blank of a presidential candidate’s application in\n\nUkrainian, Prime Minister Yanukovich made two mistakes in his job\n\ntitle, producing chuckles in the mass media supporting Victor\n\nYushchenko. They chuckled in vain – the Russian-speaking east,\n\nwhere people write in Ukrainska Mova [the Ukrainian language] with\n\nmistakes, realized Yanukovich was their man.\n\nDuring the first phase of the campaign, Yanukovich, who had a\n\ndubious blessing from Kuchma and engaged in ritual chat about the\n\nneed for stability and the European choice, looked a mere figurant\n\nin Yushchenko’s triumphant march. Yet Yanukovich derived benefits\n\nfrom attacks by his opponents. Furthermore, when he dropped\n\nmentions of Europe and NATO, stressed his links with Russia,\n\nadvocated an official status for the Russian language and dual\n\nRussian-Ukrainian citizenship, the election race went down a\n\ncompletely different road. Yanukovich acquired a political image of\n\nhis own and won the votes in the eastern regions, the Crimea and\n\nsouthern territories, securing a solid place in the second round of\n\nelections.\n\nThe eastern regions are more heavily populated than the western\n\nones, and Yanukovich’s victory in the second round was natural and\n\npredictable, whatever his opponents would say of it. The fact that\n\nvictory was eventually stolen from him is explicable, too.\n\nFirst of all, Kuchma played a significant role in it. He had\n\nchosen Yanukovich, a man with a questionable history, in the hopes\n\nit would complicate the situation and help him eventually regain\n\nthe reins of power (the fact that Yanukovich finally rejected the\n\nrole of a stuntman is a different story). How Kuchma could have\n\nhoped to unite his country after all that had befallen Ukraine\n\nduring his presidency, and in the face of a battle for his country\n\nbetween a former superpower and the surviving superpower, is a\n\ngreat question. His lethargy, duplicity, vain reveries and\n\nunder-the-table dealings dealt an irreparable blow to Yanukovich\n\nand made Kuchma himself a loser.\n\nSecondly, the population of the eastern regions – their economic\n\nand political elite and Victor Yanukovich himself as a candidate –\n\ndid not have the experience and stamina of western Ukraine.\n\nYanukovich retained the bulk of his electorate even after the\n\nnational parliament, Supreme Court, and a cohort of international\n\nmediators had driven it home to the population that their\n\ncandidate’s victory could not be recognized and that the voters\n\nwould have to return to the polls again. However, the results of\n\nthe repeat runoff vote showed a 3-percent increase in the already\n\nimprobable voters’ turnout in western Ukraine, while in the eastern\n\nregions it fell by an average of 5 percent. (In Donetsk, a city\n\ntrying on the role of a leader of the eastern and southern regions,\n\nthe number fell a whole 13 percent, while in the Crimea, which is\n\nused to making a stand against Kiev, it fell by 3 percent.) This\n\npercentage is not very high, yet it was enough to make Yushchenko\n\nthe winner – at least according to the terms of the Electoral\n\nCommission counting.\n\nNEW HORIZONS OF RUSSIAN POLITICS\n\nTo sum up, Yushchenko and the West won, while Russia and\n\nYanukovich were disgraced and suffered considerable losses. What is\n\nnext? Should we deliver public apologies and send Ambassador Victor\n\nChernomyrdin to Kiev, the “mother of all Russian cities,” with\n\ngifts such as sable furs and loans? I am not at all sure. The most\n\nimportant result of the 2004 presidential election is Ukraine’s\n\nsplit, and it shows that the country will unavoidably turn into a\n\nfederation.\n\nThe guarantee that Ukraine will maintain a special relationship\n\nwith Russia lies in its federalization rather than in the\n\nascendancy of one or another candidate. At the very least,\n\nfederalization would prevent Ukraine’s consolidation around\n\nanti-Russian forces or its rise to a position where it would offer\n\ncompetition to Russia and obstruct the reemergence of its\n\ninfluence. Such a role is already being planned for Ukraine by\n\nthose who applaud Yushchenko from across the borders. The new\n\npresident happily signs Carpathian declarations with Georgia’s\n\nPresident Mikhail Saakashvili, declaring “the third stage of\n\nliberation in Eastern Europe.”\n\nWhat the Ukrainian government needs is a timeout, a transitional\n\nperiod. Yulia Timoshenko has never made a secret of her wish to\n\ncast out the political reform that had paved the way to a package\n\nagreement on the eve of the decisive battle. If she succeeds – and\n\nthere is plenty of time before the reform takes effect September 1,\n\n2005 – the Orange will not have to worry much about a revenge of\n\nthe Blue-and-White in the March 2006 parliamentary election. More\n\nimportant for the Orange is to secure their freedom of action to\n\nmop up the political space in the eastern and southern districts.\n\nThat is, “implant civil society in the east” in the terms of\n\nYushchenko’s political technologists. This is no wonder,\n\nconsidering that Yushchenko is president of only one-half of his\n\ncountry.\n\nThis is exactly why Moscow was Yushchenko’s first official state\n\nvisit as president. Of course, he had to be received here. But let\n\nus not believe all he said. Instead, let us consider what he kept\n\nsilent about. Now Russia has a unique opportunity to make an\n\nofficial pause – for the first time since Ukraine received its\n\nindependence – and allow its new president to demonstrate his\n\ninterest in it. Had Yanukovich emerged victorious, Moscow would\n\nhave had to redouble its assistance in solving Ukraine’s economic\n\nproblems, while at the same time putting up with the inevitable\n\npresidential overtures toward the West. For the first time ever,\n\nRussia can afford a pragmatic approach.\n\nWe need that pause to formulate an agenda for the new\n\nRussian-Ukrainian dialog. The agenda, however, must not affect the\n\nefforts of political forces inside and outside parliament, nor of\n\nRussian society’s abilities to maintain brotherly ties with\n\nUkraine’s eastern and southern regions and the Crimea. A\n\nconsolidation of the south and east of Ukraine, together with the\n\npromotion of the ideas of autonomy and federation, will help\n\ndisrupt any attempts to unite both parts of the country around an\n\nanti-Russian program. As for the southern and eastern regions, they\n\nwill have the right to veto in determining their future."
