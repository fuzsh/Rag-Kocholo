        "text": "Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko, acting to end a crisis following allegations of mass corruption in his camp has fired the government of Yulia Tymoshenko, saying it had lost its \"team spirit\".\n\nMr Yushchenko, who has pledged to stamp out the corruption widespread under former president Leonid Kuchma, told a news conference he would ask regional governor 57-year-old Yury Yekhanurov, who once worked with him in government, to form a new team.\n\nHe also accepted the resignation of close ally Petro Poroshenko from his powerful security post and suspended another aide - both of whom had been accused of involvement in graft.\n\nIn sacking the charismatic Ms Tymoshenko, whose fiery oratory brought thousands out on to the streets in last December's pro-Western \"Orange Revolution\" that took him to power, Mr Yushchenko moved decisively to end a crisis that has threatened his credibility.\n\nUkraine's state security (SBU) chief Oleksander Turchinov also tendered his resignation after the sacking of the government.\n\nMr Turchinov is a close ally of Ms Tymoshenko.\n\nThe crisis, that followed months of tension between Mr Yushchenko and Ms Tymoshenko over Ukraine's economic direction, took a sharp new twist last Saturday when his chief of staff quit alleging deep corruption in his administration.\n\n\"I am setting before the new team one task - the ability to work as one ... The moment is right when (the old team) have lost their team spirit,\" Mr Yushchenko said.\n\n\"We need to halt the disappointment in society and make sure that the ideals (of the Orange Revolution) are not cast into doubt.\"\n\nThe allegations of corruption hurt a government already tarnished by slowing economic growth, rising inflation and lack of consistency on key policy issues.\n\nMr Yekhanurov, governor of industrial Dnipropetrovsk region, is a long-time supporter of Mr Yushchenko.\n\nHe was deputy to Mr Yushchenko while the latter was prime minister in 2000.\n\nHe is seen as a pro-reform technocrat and occupied various government posts under former President Kuchma.\n\nA simple majority of 266 votes in the 450-seat Parliament is required to confirm Mr Yekhanurov in his post.\n\nHowever, pro-Yushchenko forces do not have a stable majority in parliament.\n\nYekhanurov - stop-gap?\n\nSince independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine has consistently been rated one of the world's most corrupt countries by international anti-graft bodies.\n\nSome analysts saw Mr Yekhanurov as a stop-gap prime minister.\n\nOthers said the stage was set for a show-down between Mr Yushchenko and Ms Tymoshenko in parliamentary elections set for next March. There was no immediate word from Ms Tymoshenko herself.\n\n\"Sacking Tymoshenko also sets things up for a clash between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko in the March 2006 parliamentary elections, which will split the reform camp,\" said Tim Ash, emerging markets analyst at Bear Stearns in London.\n\n\"With clear evidence that the economy is slowing, Ukraine needs strong government and good coordination of economic policy,\" Mr Ash said.\n\nThe corruption scandal that threatened the image of Mr Yushchenko and his election pledge last January to clean up graft was triggered on Saturday by the resignation of chief of staff Oleksandr Zinchenko.\n\nMr Zinchenko quit saying there was widespread corruption in Yushchenko's circle and specifically named Mr Poroshenko, a close ally of Mr Yushchenko used by the President to balance the political threat from Ms Tymoshenko.\n\nMr Poroshenko resigned as secretary of the National Defence and Security Council on Thursday, saying he did not want to obstruct the investigation of the allegations against him. Mr Yushchenko accepted his resignation.\n\nCorrupt aides\n\nHowever, just as damaging for Mr Yushchenko was the resignation of Nikolai Tomenko, a deputy prime minister, who said he could no longer stand the corruption among the president's aides.\n\n\"I do not want to share responsibility with those who have created a system of corruption,\" Mr Tomenko said.\n\n\"I have not stolen and I have not been involved in the corruption that the closest advisers and aides of the President are involved in,\" he said.\n\nHighlighting the rift between Mr Yushchenko and his former revolutionary ally, Mr Tomenko said there were in effect two governments in Ukraine - one run by Ms Tymoshenko and the other by Mr Poroshenko."
