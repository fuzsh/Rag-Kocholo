        "text": "The message read, in part:\n\n“The Nazis ravaged the Ukrainian capital: hundreds of thousands of people were killed or interned, industries and houses were destroyed, but neither the massive atrocities nor the terror could break the will of the Ukrainian people to resist. The Soviet troops that liberated Kiev had the strong support of the local population, the militias and partisans.\n\n“The battle for your capital was a milestone event for all the peoples of the former USSR who heroically fought the invaders and proof of our shared historical destinies. During the most dramatic periods we have always fought shoulder to shoulder against foreign invaders.\n\n“The Kiev offensive operation that began after the defeat of the Nazi troops near Stalingrad and Kursk destroyed a powerful enemy group creating a strategic platform for the subsequent Korsun-Shevchenko and Lvov-Sandomir operations that completed the liberation of Ukraine.\n\n“As we celebrate the glorious date in our joint history, I would like to stress the importance for Russia and Ukraine of pooling their efforts in addressing current problems. Our countries are strategic partners and we must do all we can to further deepen our bilateral cooperation which meets the vital interest of the peoples of Russia and Ukraine.”"
