        "meta_description": "The LSE Public Policy Review is an open-access, refereed journal which is published quarterly. Each issue is thematic and concentrates on a key topic at the heart of current debates in public policy. Public policy challenges bring to the fore cross-cutting questions which require a global perspective and a focus on their interconnectedness. Because of this, articles in each issue take different disciplinary perspectives, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and analysis at the forefront of current thinking. As a result, each issue presents a comprehensive approach to the specific theme and an analysis that is academically rigorous but also readily accessible to all readers. The LSEPPR publishes original research papers, conceptual articles, review papers written for a general readership, in non-technical language aimed at a wide audience including government, business and policy-makers, as well as academics and students. LSEPPR seeks to actively contribute to the study and development of public and social policy, public administration and public management.",

        "text": "On 1 December 1991, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic held its referendum on national independence. The result was emphatic: 90.3% voted for independent statehood, with a participation rate of 84.2%. Even more remarkably, only one region produced an approval rate of under 80% – the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, which voted 54.2% in favour and had by far the lowest participation rate – 67.5%. In the east, the two oblasts (provinces) of the Donbas, which had a Russophone majority, voted solidly in support of Ukrainian independence. These data portrayed the republic as united around the political choice of becoming an independent nation-state. What the people did not want was a salvaging of the Soviet Union in some form, or the creation of a more narrow federation comprised of the three East Slavic republics and Kazakhstan, which had been Mikhail Gorbachev’s last-ditch effort as Soviet president.\n\nAnyone who had paid attention to a referendum held only months before would have not expected such a landslide. On 17 March 1991, the Soviet Union held a national referendum on its preservation as a federal state. In the Ukrainian SSR, 70.2% of its residents – not yet citisens – supported the continued existence of the Soviet Union as a ‘renewed federation of equal and sovereign republics’. That time, the lowest number of ‘yes’ votes was registered in the three western oblasts that had never been part of the Russian Empire and had been annexed by Stalin in 1939: Lviv (16.4%), Ivano-Frankivsk (18.2%), and Ternopil (19.3%) [].\n\nToday, more than thirty years later, what can we make of this seeming contradiction in Ukraine’s national choice in 1991? Regional political differences are obvious, but they should not be seen as primordial or unchanging: The Donbas did not stand out in the way the Crimea did. Terminology itself also evolved that year. ‘Sovereignty’, understood as the republic’s rights within a federation became ‘the right to proclaim independence’. But perhaps the most important observation would be the presence of a new political unity built on a larger foundation than that of ethnic solidarity. Independence became possible when the population at large, including a significant share of national minorities and Ukrainians assimilated into Russian culture, embraced the notion of an independent and democratic Ukraine.\n\nThat moment of national unity did not last long during the early 1990s, but Ukrainian society has recovered it more than once since that decade. There was the emergence of a mass oppositional movement in 2001, the Orange Revolution (2004–2005), and the Revolution of Dignity (2013–2014). This new Ukrainian identity remains on full display now, with the mass mobilisation of Ukrainian society defending their country against the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion.\n\nIt is possible to argue that the entire history of independent Ukraine resembles this two steps forward, one step back type of progress. There has been a gradual, stop-and-go development of an assertive civil society identifying with Ukraine’s democratic choice and acknowledging the importance of the Ukrainian language and culture for the republic’s sovereignty.\n\nA second argument, which is interconnected with the first one, can be that this struggle for a democratic Ukraine was from the very beginning a revolution, albeit an unusual one. The Ukrainian case study allows us to rethink the traditional understanding of social forces and political elites in a revolution, as it demonstrates the society’s remarkable ability to self-organise politically."
