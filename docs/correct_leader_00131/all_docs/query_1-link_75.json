UKRAINE'S VOTERS DON'T NEED MOSCOW'S ADVICE\n\nAll credible international observers agree that fraud was rampant\n\nOP-ED: by Anders Aslund, Financial Times\n\nLondon, UK, Friday, November 12 2004\n\nThe first round of Ukraine's presidential election was a close-run thing.\n\nAccording to the official returns - published 10 days after the October 31\n\npoll - Viktor Yushchenko, the democratic opposition candidate, won 39.9\n\nper cent of the vote, narrowly beating Viktor Yanukovich, the current prime\n\nminister, who won 39.3 per cent. On November 21, a run-off will determine\n\nthe final outcome.\n\nIn spite of the slender margin, these elections were an outstanding victory\n\nfor Mr Yushchenko and the democrats. The incumbent regime used all means\n\nagainst him. The national TV channels supported Mr Yanukovich. According\n\nto Mr Yushchenko's campaign, Mr Yanukovich's election budget amounted to\n\n$600m - that is, 1 per cent of Ukraine's gross domestic product and as much\n\nas George W. Bush's presidential campaign, although America's GDP is 100\n\ntimes greater than Ukraine's. Mr Yushchenko even narrowly escaped an\n\nalleged poison attack that has left his face visibly scarred.\n\nAll credible international observers agree that fraud was rampant.\n\nUndoubtedly, some of the votes cast for Mr Yushchenko were illicitly\n\nreallocated to Mr Yanukovich. Yet the Ukrainians understood the stakes\n\nand stood up for their democratic choice with a participation of 75 per\n\ncent. Most of the votes for minor candidates are likely to go to Mr\n\nYushchenko in the final round.\n\nBut why are Ukrainians dissatisfied with their current government? After\n\nall, Ukraine has currently one of the world's most vibrant economies. For\n\nthe past five years, Ukraine's GDP has grown by an annual average of 9\n\nper cent and so far this year it has surged by 13.4 per cent. Like Mr\n\nYushchenko, Mr Yanukovich favours further market-orientated reforms.\n\nWhat has brought so many to the polls is the contrast between the two\n\ncandidates' visions for Ukraine's political system and geopolitical\n\norientation.\n\nMr Yushchenko stands for western-style democracy, against corruption\n\nand for a European orientation and membership of Nato; Mr Yanukovich\n\nrepresents the biggest oligarchic group in Donetsk in Russian-speaking\n\neastern Ukraine and is seen as pro-Russian.\n\nRarely has any foreign country been as engaged in the elections of another\n\nas Russia has been in these. Russia's President Vladimir Putin even came to\n\nKiev to campaign for Mr Yanukovich on national television five days before\n\nthe elections. Dozens of Moscow's loud-mouthed political advisers have\n\ndescended on Ukraine. On Ukrainian and Russian television, they have\n\ndeclared Mr Yushchenko a dreadful person and Mr Yanukovich wonderful\n\n(although he has served two prison sentences for violent crimes).\n\nThis heavy-handed interference appears to have backfired. Most Ukrainians\n\nhave a positive view of Russia, but nobody likes this treatment. Contrary to\n\nexpectations, Mr Yushchenko carried much of Russian-speaking Ukraine.\n\nNot that a Yanukovich victory would necessarily benefit Russia. It is ironic\n\nthat, after having defeated his own oligarchs, Mr Putin is supporting a much\n\nmore oligarchic party in Ukraine. Mr Yanukovich is closely allied with Rinat\n\nAkhmetov, owner of System Capital Management, the Donetsk-based\n\nconglomerate that controls seven big steelworks. Mr Akhmetov seeks to\n\nkeep Russian companies out of his Donetsk principality and his friend\n\nMr Yanukovich might well take a similar line in the rest of Ukraine. By\n\ncontrast, as prime minister in 2000, Mr Yushchenko settled the large\n\narrears to Russia for gas imports and allowed big Russian companies to\n\nbuy businesses.\n\nThe current Russian campaign seems to be motivated largely by a desire to\n\nkeep Ukraine out of the arms of the west. But it is swimming against the\n\neconomic tide. Regardless of who wins, Ukraine will sooner rather than later\n\nneed to enter the World Trade Organisation because of its dependence on\n\nexports of sensitive commodities such as steel, chemicals and agricultural\n\nproducts. It must improve its poor relations with the European Union for\n\nsimilar reasons.\n\nIt is time for the Kremlin to wake up to the democratic facts. Viktor\n\nChernomyrdin, Russia's ambassador to Ukraine, appeared to acknowledge\n\nthat a Yanukovich victory was not vital for Russia when he remarked after\n\nthe first-round election that \"anybody who becomes Ukrainian president\n\nwill be compelled to develop good-neighbourly relations with Russia\".\n\nA President Yushchenko could lead Ukraine to true democracy and\n\nwestern integration. Russia would be well advised to follow his lead. -30-\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe writer is director of the Russian and Eurasian Programme at the\n\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.\n\n=======================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER TWO\n\n=======================================================\n\n2. RUSSIAN PAPER SEES ANOTHER TRIP BY PUTIN TO UKRAINE\n\nAS ATTEMPT TO SWAY UKRAINE'S PRESIDENTIAL VOTE\n\nArticle by Andrey Chernikov\n\nKommersant, Moscow, in Russian 11 Nov 04 pp 1, 10\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, Thu, Nov 11, 2004\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's forthcoming visit to the Crimea is timed\n\nto boost support for presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych, says Russian\n\nnewspaper Kommersant. Putin is the trump card wheeled out by the Ukrainian\n\nauthorities to help their favoured candidate Yanukovych following the news\n\nthat his rival, Viktor Yushchenko, emerged in the lead from the first round\n\nof elections and is now receiving support from those candidates knocked out\n\nof the presidential race.\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the article by Andrey Chernikov published\n\nby the newspaper on 11 November:\n\nYesterday, the Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission [CEC] announced the\n\nresults of the first round of the presidential election. Based on 100 per\n\ncent of the votes processed, CEC Chairman Serhiy Kivalov announced that the\n\nformer prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, was leading over the current prime\n\nminister, Viktor Yanukovych, by 0.55 per cent. Meanwhile, Mr Yushchenko\n\nbegan receiving offers of support from candidates who have dropped out of\n\nthe race.\n\nIn light of the situation that has developed, the authorities have played\n\ntheir strongest trump card: tomorrow Russian President Vladimir Putin flies\n\nto Crimea. The pre-election nature of this trip is obvious. [Passage\n\nomitted].\n\nAs for Viktor Yanukovych, whose candidacy is backed by the present\n\nauthorities not only of Ukraine, but also of Russia, only the Women for the\n\nFuture association has so far declared support for him. This organization\n\nput forward candidates for the parliamentary election in 2002 but did not\n\nwin any seats, and it did not have its own candidates in the presidential\n\nelection.\n\nIn this situation the news that Russian President Vladimir Putin would be\n\nflying to Crimea on Friday [12 November] came like a bolt from the blue.\n\nOlha Udovina, a minister from the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous\n\nRepublic of Crimea, confirmed this news yesterday. However, neither the\n\nUkrainian nor the Crimean authorities are saying what this visit is\n\nconnected with. It is assumed in the Crimean government that there is\n\na direct link between this trip and the Ukrainian elections.\n\nAs Yelena Gulyayeva, an adviser in the Crimean government's press\n\nservice, observed, this visit is unlikely to be linked to any festival or\n\ncelebration. \"We recently had Ukrainian Literature Day, and the next\n\nholidays will be on 16 November, Communications Workers' Day and\n\nTolerance Day, and 17 November, Students' Day,\" Gulyayeva said.\n\nKommersant's sources in the Ukrainian Presidential Administration suggest\n\nthat Putin will arrive in Kerch. He will be met by Ukrainian President\n\nLeonid Kuchma. Most likely Prime Minister Yanukovych will go there too.\n\nOn 28 October, three days before the first round of the voting, Vladimir\n\nPutin visited Ukraine. He participated in the celebrations on the occasion\n\nof the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Kiev from the German fascist\n\ninvaders (although in actual fact that event took place on 6 November 1944 -\n\nKommersant). During that visit the Russian president had appeared on three\n\nnational TV channels and said a lot of good things about the government of\n\nViktor Yanukovych and many people perceived this as electioneering.\n\nThere is also something to talk about this time round. Yesterday, the\n\nRussian State Duma ratified an agreement on preferential arrangements for\n\nUkrainian citizens to stay in Russia. -30- [Action Ukraine Monitoring]\n\n=======================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER THREE\n\n=======================================================\n\n3. RUSSIA'S GRAVITATIONAL PULL IN EURASIA STANDS TO\n\nSTRENGTHEN AFTER UKRAINE ELECTION\n\nEURASIA INSIGHT: OP-ED by Ariel Cohen\n\nEurasianet, New York, NY, November 10, 2004\n\nThe outcome of Ukraine's contentious presidential vote could have\n\nfar-reaching ramifications for the US-Russian geopolitical competition in\n\nCentral Asia and the Caucasus. An election victory by Prime Minister Viktor\n\nYanukovich, who is widely viewed as Russia's preferred candidate, could\n\nembolden Kremlin efforts to enhance its position in the energy-rich Caspian\n\nBasin.\n\nYanukovich is set to face opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko, a\n\nWestern-oriented reformer, in a run-off vote on November 21. Since the first\n\nround of voting October 31, campaigning has been marked by acrimony, with\n\nboth sides hurling allegations of voter fraud at the other.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's administration has made no secret of its\n\ndesire to prevent Ukraine, long viewed in Moscow as Russia's \"little\n\nbrother,\" from drifting Westward. In pursuit of their goals, Russian leaders\n\nhave played on the vulnerabilities of Ukrainian political leaders. In 2000,\n\nfor example, President Leonid Kuchma became embroiled in a scandal after\n\nthe release of a secretly recorded tape on which the president appeared to\n\nsanction the assassination of a Ukrainian journalist. Since then, Russia has\n\nprovided strong political support for Kuchma, helping ensure the president's\n\npolitical survival. Not surprisingly, Kuchma has steered Ukraine away from\n\nNATO and EU integration in recent years.\n\nYanukovich has also been a central figure in Ukraine's tilt towards Russia,\n\nand the Kremlin reportedly has used its influence to help bankroll his\n\npresidential campaign. Some experts believe that, like Kuchma, Russia is\n\nexploiting Yanukovich's troubled past - specifically the fact that\n\nYanukovich served time in jail as a young man for robbery and assault. There\n\nis speculation in both Moscow and Kyiv that Russian officials may possess\n\nmore \"compromat,\" or embarrassing information, on Yanukovich that they\n\ncould use in the future to coerce him.\n\nIn Moscow, observers already characterize the potential relationship between\n\nPutin and Yanukovich as that of a security services case officer handling an\n\n\"asset.\" A Kremlin source indicated that Putin, a former KGB agent, is\n\npersonally disdainful of Yanukovich's unsavory past. Nevertheless, the Putin\n\nadministration badly wants Yanukovich to be elected, as it would likely\n\ncement Ukraine in a position of dependency regarding Russia.\n\nGiven the high strategic stakes involved, observers in Washington believe\n\nRussia is willing to go to great lengths to secure Yanukovich's election.\n\nHis victory would free Russia to devote more attention and resources to\n\nbolstering its geopolitical interests elsewhere, in particular Central Asia\n\nand the Caucasus.\n\nMoscow is especially keen to improve its position in the competition over\n\nCaspian Basin energy. Moscow's primary opponent in this sphere is the\n\nUnited States, which since the September 11 terrorist tragedy has increased\n\nits strategic profile throughout the Caspian Basin. [For additional\n\ninformation see the Eurasia Insight archive]. Washington is also the main\n\nsponsor of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, an energy conduit that will\n\nbreak a Russia's virtual monopoly on Western-oriented energy export\n\nroutes. [For additional information see the Eurasia Insight archive]. Of\n\nlate, however, China has also entered the energy fray, working with\n\nKazakhstan to establish a pipeline network that would transport energy\n\nto the East. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive].\n\nAt present, there are several points in Central Asia and the Caucasus where\n\nRussia could apply pressure in an attempt to reorder the geopolitical\n\ncalculus. Some observers expect Russia to increase pressure on Kazakhstani\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has aggressively pursued a\n\n\"multi-vector\" policy in recent years that is designed to play Russia, the\n\nUnited States and China off against each other in the energy contest. One\n\nway Moscow can attempt to influence Kazakhstani policy is to play the\n\nnationality card, stirring up discontent among the large ethnic Russians\n\ncommunity in northern Kazakhstan.\n\nOther analysts suggest the Kremlin's attention may turn to Azerbaijan, a\n\ncountry whose relationship with the United States has appeared to ebb over\n\nthe past year. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive]. Reports of\n\ninfighting within the ruling party in Baku have prompted speculation that\n\nPresident Ilham Aliyev's authority is shaky. Russia could thus try to repeat\n\nthe \"Kuchma scenario\" in Azerbaijan, providing strong political support that\n\nhelps Aliyev to preserve and consolidate his authority. In return, Moscow\n\nwould no doubt demand closer Azerbaijani cooperation on energy-related\n\nissues, as well as on the ongoing conflict in Chechnya.\n\nUzbekistan is another country that has experienced recent trouble in its\n\nrelations with the United States, underscored by the US State Department's\n\ndecision last July to sanction Tashkent because of the Uzbek government's\n\npoor human rights record. [For background see the Eurasia Insight archive].\n\nPresident Islam Karimov of late has signaled a desire to improve relations\n\nwith Russia, and Moscow seems eager to reciprocate. At an October\n\nceremony marking the admittance of Russia into the Central Asian Coop-\n\neration Organization, Karimov championed Russia's \"legitimate\" right to play\n\na large role in regional developments. \"We here in the region acknowledge,\n\nhave acknowledged and will continue to acknowledge Russia's interests -\n\nits strategic interests and the historical aims and tasks Russia pursues in\n\nthis region,\" Karimov said.\n\nGeorgia is another logical focus for Russian officials. However, any designs\n\nthat Moscow may have on Georgia may be complicated by the continuing\n\npolitical turmoil in the separatist region of Abkhazia. [For background see\n\nthe Eurasia Insight archive]. Russian officials, without doubt, view\n\nGeorgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, specifically his desire to reunify\n\nthe country and push it into the embrace of NATO and the EU, as a threat to\n\nRussian interests. However, Russia has traditionally depended on its ability\n\nto manipulate Georgia's separatist regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - in\n\norder to exert pressure on Tbilisi. The Abkhaz turmoil would appear to\n\ndeprive Moscow of this lever of influence, at least on a temporary basis.\n\nGiven the US preoccupation with the insurgency in Iraq, Washington's ability\n\nto counter Russian moves in Central Asia and the Caucasus would seem\n\nlimited. In addition to the fact that Iraq is consuming most of the United\n\nStates' strategic resources, American officials say their chief aims vis a\n\nvis Russia are maintaining its participation in the anti-terror coalition,\n\nand keeping access open to Russian energy reserves. These policy\n\npriorities, US officials quietly admit, act as a restraint on Washington's\n\ndesire to check Russian expansionist impulses in Central Asia and the\n\nCaucasus. -30- [Action Ukraine Report Monitoring Service]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEditor's Note: Ariel Cohen, Ph.D., is a Research Fellow at the Heritage\n\nFoundation in Washington, D.C., and co-author and editor of \"Security\n\nChanges in Eurasia After 9/11,\" Ashgate, 2005 (forthcoming).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttp://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav111004.shtml\n\n========================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER FOUR\n\nYour comments about the Report are always welcome\n\n========================================================\n\n4. CONCERN RISES IN US AND EU OVER RUSSIA'S\n\nGROWING HOSTILITY TO THE OSCE\n\nBy Daniel Dombey and Andrew Jack\n\nFinancial Times, London, UK, Thu, Nov 11 2004 02:00\n\nLONDON - An unarmed British soldier looks through high-powered\n\nbinoculars across the steep mountain valley on Georgia's border with\n\nRussia.\n\nHis seemingly innocuous role as part of a multinational team from the\n\nOrganisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe is observing - but\n\nnot intervening to prevent - illegal crossings. His role, and that of many\n\nothers like him, is at the heart of a widening dispute between Russia and\n\nthe west over who should be responsible for such sensitive areas. Similar\n\nconcerns contributed to the postponement this week of a summit between\n\nRussia and the European Union.\n\nMoscow argues that the OSCE has taken an intrusive and hypocritical\n\ninterest in the affairs of the former Soviet Union, particularly on issues\n\nsuch as election and border monitoring. Diplomats from the US and the\n\nEU suspect that an increasingly authoritarian Kremlin is trying to sabotage\n\nthe organisation and break free of OSCE oversight in Russia's traditional\n\n\"near abroad\".\n\n\"What is going on in the OSCE is . . . worth watching because it is a\n\nbarometer of the political atmosphere in Europe today,\" Jan Kubis, OSCE\n\nsecretary-general, said recently. \"There are symptoms, even warning signs,\n\nthat our desired co-operative spirit and unity of purpose are eroding.\"\n\nConcerns about Russia's growing hostility to the OSCE, together with moves\n\nby President Vladimir Putin to consolidate his power prompted the US State\n\nDepartment to express \"anxiety\" about Russia.\n\nSimilar worries are behind the difficult relations between Russia and some\n\nEU officials. It took some lobbying by the European Union to prevent this\n\nweek's postponed Russia-EU summit from being cancelled altogether. It is a\n\nfar cry from the days in the mid-1990s when Russia wanted the OSCE to\n\ndevelop into Europe's chief international organisation.\n\nFounded in 1975 as the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe,\n\nit has expanded greatly and now comprises 55 member states in Europe,\n\nNorth America and the former Soviet Union. Officials pride themselves on\n\ntheir role in defusing conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and beyond. But\n\nRussia complains that in spite of the presence of the border monitors the\n\norganisation does not give sufficient emphasis to security and gives too\n\nmuch to human rights in the former Soviet Union.\n\nA toughly worded communiqué by Commonwealth of Independent States\n\nleaders this July slammed the OSCE for \"double standards\" and \"politicised\"\n\nelection monitoring - although such attacks did not deter the OSCE from\n\ncriticising the first round of Ukraine's presidential election last month.\n\nAlexey Borodavkin, Russia's ambassador to the OSCE, has criticised the\n\norganisation's \"selective and biased\" appointment of observers to elections\n\nin Belarus. He has called for the OSCE to return to its \"original function\"\n\nof \"political dialogue\" and \"decisions on the most important security issues\n\nin Europe\".\n\nFor almost a year, Russia has refused to reaffirm commitments made to the\n\nOSCE in 1999 to withdraw troops from Georgia and Moldova. It is also\n\nblocking some OSCE funding unless its concerns are addressed, a move that\n\nhas infuriated the US. A similar tough Russian line on the 2002 budget led\n\nto the OSCE closing down a mission in Chechnya.\n\nOne key dispute is the organisation's mandate on the Georgian border, put in\n\nplace in 1999 amid Russian charges that Georgia was harbouring Chechen\n\nrebels. The mandate comes up for renewal at the end of this year and Russia\n\nis attempting to close it. \"The mission works well, but it is costly and no\n\nlonger needed,\" says one Russian diplomat, citing the annual Euro15m ($19m,\n\n£10m) fees.\n\nHowever, Russian military officials also regularly hint at the need to\n\nlaunch strikes against Chechen militants in the Pankisi valley in Georgia.\n\nThe absence of the OSCE from the region could give Moscow a freer hand.\n\n\"Russia has always pulled back [from destroying the OSCE] in the past,\n\nbecause they see it is an instrument for promoting stability,\" said an OSCE\n\ndiplomat. \"But some in Russia argue it is more a nuisance than a help in\n\nachieving their objectives.\" -30- [Action Ukraine Monitoring Service]\n\n========================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER FIVE\n\nYour comments about the Report are always welcome\n\n========================================================\n\n5. PM/PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH\n\nWANTS UKRAINE MORE COMPETITIVE ON THE\n\nINTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET\n\nOne Plus One TV, Kiev, in Ukrainian 1730 gmt 11 Nov 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, in English, Thu, Nov 11, 2004\n\nKIEV - The Ukrainian prime minister and presidential candidate, Viktor\n\nYanukovych, has called for making Ukraine more competitive on the\n\ninternational arms market. Addressing a Defence Ministry sitting, Yanukovych\n\npledged to restore servicemen's cancelled benefits ahead of the presidential\n\nrunoff on 21 November. The following is an excerpt from a report by the\n\nUkrainian One Plus One TV on 11 November:\n\n[Presenter] The state of the Ukrainian armed forces and the\n\nmilitary-industrial complex leaves much to be desired, Prime Minister Viktor\n\nYanukovych has said. He was chairing a Defence Ministry sitting summing up\n\nits performance. Defence Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk warned generals against\n\nreporting their achievements and said problems should be discussed. [Passage\n\nomitted: Presenter lists problems facing the army.]\n\nOlena Matsyutska reports about defence industry development programmes.\n\n[Correspondent] Kuzmuk said at the beginning of the sitting that it would be\n\nunusual and that it is not triumphant reports but work that is expected from\n\nthe generals.\n\n[Kuzmuk] There will be a clear analysis of the real state of affairs today.\n\nThere will be no accusations levelled at the predecessors today. This is not\n\nthe way generals do things. There are problems. You will be appointed to\n\nsolve them. If you fail to do so, you yourselves will become a problem.\n\n[Correspondent] Yanukovych was the next to take the floor. His first words\n\nwere about the critical state of affairs. [Passage omitted: Correspondents\n\ndwells on army problems.]\n\n[Correspondent] The government earmarked 6.5bn hryvnyas [more than\n\n1.2bn dollars] for the army in next year's draft budget, which is 60 per\n\ncent more [presumably on this year].\n\n[Yanukovych] We decided to restore privileges to servicemen and their\n\nfamily members at the latest Cabinet of Ministers sitting. [Applause] Over\n\nthe next two years we will restore servicemen's privileges envisaging free\n\nannual leave travel, food rations and utility bills. [Passage omitted:\n\nCorrespondent says servicemen's housing problems will be dealt with.]\n\n[Correspondent] The Finance Ministry has been instructed to earmark\n\nfunds to step up military reform. It is expected that 235,000 servicemen\n\nwill remain in the army by the end of the year. Upgrading and providing\n\nincentives to the defence industry is also a priority, which is meant to\n\nproduce something new for the army and to boost [Ukraine's]\n\ninternational profile.\n\n[Yanukovych] We have seen of late that many countries in the world have\n\nbeen upgrading their own armed forces. We as a state which is a member\n\nof the elite club of advanced arms producers should certainly make use of\n\nthis. I am confident that we are obliged to work more aggressively and\n\nenergetically, as the competition on the arms market is becoming\n\nincreasingly tougher year by year. We have no right to lose. History\n\nwould not forgive us.\n\n[Correspondent] Yanukovych called for the creation of a state reserve\n\ndevelopment fund to implement the army and defence industry support\n\nprogrammes. Obsolete weapons should be scrapped using scientific methods\n\nso that the Novobohdanivka and Artemivsk accidents [massive explosions\n\nof ammunition in southern and eastern Ukraine] never happen again. Those\n\narsenals were already passed to Ukroboronservis [a subsidiary of the\n\nUkrainian state arms trader Ukrspetseksport] to scrap the ammunition. The\n\nDefence Ministry is in talks with NATO for the alliance to finance the\n\nscrapping. -30- [The Action Ukraine Report Monitoring Service]\n\n======================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER SIX\n\nYour comments about the Report are always welcome\n\n======================================================\n\n6.

The trip cost\n\nabout $170,000, with the portion that Kiselev did not cover paid for by\n\nseveral private U.S. donors.\n\n\"The elections passed within the framework of the law, were transparent,\n\nand any infringements which were revealed did not put doubt upon the\n\nresults of the election,\" delegation head Bob Carr, a former Democratic\n\nmember of the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan, said at a\n\nKyiv press conference on Nov. 1.\n\n.\n\nThe report by Carr's group outraged other election observers.

MORE THAN ONE MILLION USD PAID TO AMERICAN PR\n\nCOMPANIES FOR PROMOTING PM VIKTOR YANUKOVYCH'S\n\nIMAGE IN USA- UKRAYINSKA PRAVDA\n\nUNIAN, Kyiv, Ukraine, Thursday, November 11, 2004\n\nKYIV - Since March of 2003, American public relations firms have\n\nreceived some 1 million 41 thousand dollars in payments on contracts,\n\nwhich were concluded for the purpose of promoting a positive image of\n\nVictor Yanukovych, Prime-Minister and Ukrainian presidential candidate,\n\naccording to the \"Ukrayinska Pravda\" web-site in Kyiv, Ukraine.\n\nThe following is the summary in English of the article \"The Image of\n\nYanukovych in the USA\" by Lyuba Shara that appeared in Ukrainian on\n\nthe Ukrayinska Pravda web-site November 11:\n\nUP discloses that, according to information that was obtained from the\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, contracts were signed with the following\n\nfirms:\n\n* Venable, LLP;\n\n* Potomac Communications Strategies, Inc.;\n\n* Creative Response Concepts;\n\n* DBC Public Relations Experts;\n\n* JWI, LLC (Jefferson Waterman International);\n\n* Aleksei Kiselev.\n\nUkrainian portion of the contracts was signed by Alek Kiselev, Odessa\n\nnative, who has been in the United States since 1992, and is Viktor\n\nYanukovych' U.S. strategy counselor. UP writes that it was mainly\n\nKiselev who handled all the accounts, which were registered with the\n\nUnited States Department of Justice.\n\nAccording to UP, the strategy of the Yanukovych PR-campaign in the\n\nUSA \"is focused on three major objectives: portraying Yanukovych as\n\na liberal and a representative of the \"new Ukraine\"; showing Yushchenko\n\nas an anti-Semite, and portraying the presidential election campaign in\n\nUkraine as being free and fair, which is the beginning of legitimizing\n\nthe eventual election of Yanukovych in the eyes of the American\n\ncommunity.\n\nThe first objective of the program, according to UP, is now being\n\nimplemented by the above-mentioned PR-companies, which, in particular,\n\nis to make telephone calls, hold meetings, have conversations, attend\n\ndinners, etc., \"with the leading representatives of the Washington power\n\nstructures\". The idea of Yanukovych as a representative of the \"new\"\n\nUkraine was not created by the author of the UP article, but was taken\n\nfrom the agreement between the Venable law firm and A.Kiselev, signed\n\nMarch 7, 2003, according to the author of the article.\n\nThe second objective of the program, according to UP, is being handled\n\nby A.Kiselev personally, this is the dissemination of information about\n\nthe \"anti-Semitism views of Victor Yushchenko, a member of parliament\n\nand the front-running presidential candidate, and Ukrainian-Americans in\n\nthe USA\".\n\nAs an example of this view, UP cites the Washington Jewish Week\n\nweb-site, which stated in an article that \"Kiselev is also concerned\n\nthat Yanukovych is not getting a fair hearing in the States, complaining\n\nthat Ukrainian Diaspora groups that lobby in this country and support\n\nYushchenko came following World War II and lived in Ukrainian areas\n\nwhere many residents were Nazi collaborators.\"\n\nThe third objective of the program, according to the author of the UP\n\ninvestigation, was to be implemented by a group of former U.S.\n\nCongressmen, who, while visiting Ukraine during the first round of the\n\nUkrainian presidential election on Oct 31, would conclude and report\n\nthat the elections were \"free and fair\".\n\nUP explains that this conclusion outraged members of the U.S.\n\nAssociation of the Former Members of Congress, who have been\n\nconcerned about what has been going on in Ukraine. Association members,\n\ntogether with the U.S.- Ukraine Foundation, through a program funded by\n\nthe USAID, organized four trips of former Congressmen to Ukraine to\n\nobserve the election campaign.\n\nThese delegations reported that there were numerous violations committed\n\nin Ukraine in the run-up to the Ukrainian presidential elections. Later\n\nthese violations evolved into faults and frauds committed during the\n\nelection, which was confirmed by many reputed international observers.\n\nThe delegation of former Congressmen (all Democrats), headed by Bob\n\nCarr, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nfrom Michigan, arrived at a surprising conclusion: \"the elections passed\n\nwithin the framework of the law, were transparent, and any infringements\n\nwhich were revealed did not put doubt upon the results of the election\".\n\nThis was reported at a press conference held in Kyiv on Nov. 1. They\n\nwere accompanied by a translator, who acted as their manager and\n\norganizer. UP has a hunch according to the article that this translator\n\nwas probably Alex Kiselev, and this turns attention to the fact that\n\nduring this press conference the Congressmen were asked about the\n\ngrounds of their conclusion, and said that they based their conclusion\n\nonly on what they actually saw.\n\nAn official observer from the USA at the Ukrainian elections, who\n\nasked to remain undisclosed, agreed to give an interview to an UNIAN\n\ncorrespondent. He stressed that the trip of this delegation to Ukraine\n\nraises many serious questions. The news agency's interlocutor said the\n\ntrip of this delegation, and, more than that, its conclusion, was a big\n\nsurprise to those who have been monitoring the Ukrainian elections.\n\nHe supposes that these former Congress members, maybe, were not\n\nadequately briefed about the real situation regarding the entire election\n\nprocess in Ukraine, and about the hundreds of different possibilities\n\nabout how the fraud can happen on election day. According to journalists,\n\nwho were present at the press conference, the Congressmen seemed to\n\nfeel uneasy, and seemed like they wanted to put an end to their meeting\n\nwith the journalists as soon as possible. To put it shorter, Stalin called\n\nsuch people \"useful idiots\".\n\nBased on the above-mentioned information, UP raises several questions\n\nfor Yanukovych: according to his income declaration, he does not have a\n\npersonal car, so from what sources are those Washington PR-companies\n\npaid? What funds were received by Kiselev? He is the person who directly\n\npays the PR-companies. This issue will be the theme of the next\n\ninvestigation.\n\nTake a look at the declaration that he personally filed with the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Justice: it says that Alex Kiselev is a volunteer assistant of\n\nMr.Yanukovych, and he does not receive any money for his activities. At\n\nthe same time, since March of 2003, he has paid $1,041,369.50 to\n\nWashington PR-companies for promoting Mr. Yanukovych's image?\n\nThe question now is, was this a generous personal contribution from\n\nMr.Kiselev? Another question is: who provided the funds to pay for the\n\ntrip of 12 people who were a part in the former Congressmen Bob Carr's\n\ndelegation to Ukraine? If Yanukovych is so clean and pure, how does he\n\npay such large amounts of money for his public relations? -30-\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUkrayinska Pravda: www.pravda.com.ua\n\nUNIAN link: http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-65203.html\n\n=======================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER EIGHT\n\nAdditional names for the distribution list are always welcome\n\n========================================================\n\n8. INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WATCHDOG CITES\n\nCAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS IN UKRAINIAN PRES ELECTION\n\nGovernment interfered in all stages of the presidential election\n\nNatasha Lisova, AP Worldstream, Kyiv, Ukraine, Thu, Nov 11, 2004\n\nKIEV - An international human rights watchdog said Thursday that the\n\nUkrainian government had interfered in all stages of the presidential\n\nelection campaign and vote in the latest sign of international concern over\n\ndemocracy in the ex-Soviet republic.\n\nThe critical account from the International Helsinki Foundation for Human\n\nRights came a day after Ukrainian election officials announced the\n\nmuch-delayed final results from the Oct. 31 vote.\n\nOpposition leader Viktor Yushchenko won 0.5 percent more votes, with\n\n39.87 percent, than Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, forcing a runoff\n\non Nov. 21, elections officials said. A first-round victory would have\n\nrequired one of the 24 candidates to receive more than 50 percent of the\n\nvote.\n\nThe rights watchdog said the campaign ahead of the first round was marred\n\nby \"gross violations of fundamental human rights and principle freedoms.\" It\n\naccused authorities of \"the persecution of dissenters,\" using law\n\nenforcement bodies as an \"instrument of political struggle,\" media bias in\n\nfavor of Yanukovych and state interference in \"all stages of the process and\n\nthe vote itself.\"\n\nEarlier this month, observers representing the Organization for Security and\n\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and\n\nNATO said Ukraine's presidential election did not meet European standards\n\nfor democracy, citing state media bias in Yanukovych's favor and state\n\ninterference including obstruction of opposition activities.\n\nOn Thursday, Canadian Ambassador Andrew Robinson urged \"much greater\n\ntransparency\" in the second-round vote, saying: \"Openness and transparency\n\nare critical to credibility,\" the embassy said.\n\nThe vote is seen as a key test of democracy in this nation of 48 million\n\npeople and an indicator of what direction Ukrainians will choose for their\n\nnation, which has cultivated ties with the West and neighboring Russia.\n\nYushchenko, a reform-minded former prime minister, is seen as likely to push\n\nUkraine closer to the European Union, while Yanukovych, who has the backing\n\nof outgoing Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and the Kremlin, is considered\n\npro-Russian. -30- [The Action Ukraine Report Monitoring Service]\n\n========================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER NINE\n\n========================================================\n\n9. WHOSE DEMOCRACY AHEAD IN UKRAINE?\n\nCOLUMN: By Doug Bandow\n\nThe Washington Times, Washington, D.C.\n\nWednesday, November 10, 2004 [print edition only]\n\nKIEV, Ukraine -- Western advertising mixes with Stalinist architecture\n\nin this nation of 47 million people. Ukraine, like America, has been in the\n\nmidst of a heated presidential election. And international issues -\n\nespecially Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. - have taken center stage.\n\nThe initial ballot on Oct. 31 sent two of 24 candidates into a\n\nrunoff: current Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and former Prime\n\nMinister Viktor Yushchenko.\n\nMany Westerners see the election as a cataclysmic struggle\n\nbetween pro-American and pro-Russian forces. But Konstantin\n\nBondarenko, director of the Institute of National Strategy, is more cynical:\n\n\"The Yanukovych camp is the people in power who want to stay in power.\n\nYushchenko represents the people who had been in power and want to\n\nget back into power.\"\n\nDemocracy has proved messy in this former Soviet republic.\n\nThe campaign has been marred by questionable practices, most directed\n\nagainst Mr. Yushchenko.\n\nYushchenko adviser Oleg Medvedev charges: \"The principles of\n\nfree and fair elections are being violated.\" Sergei Tigipko, the Yanukovych\n\ncampaign manager, emphasizes the positive: \"The most important thing is\n\nthat both candidates can freely talk around the country.\"\n\nThe most common complaint is that Mr. Yanukovych gets more,\n\nand more favorable, press attention. However, his supporters point out, he\n\nis the sitting Prime Minister. And biased television coverage is hardly\n\nunknown in America.\n\nThe print media are more balanced, despite local government\n\ninterference. Rostyslav Khotin, editor of the Ukrainian section of BBC\n\nWorld Service, says the media are \"under pressure but you can get\n\ninformation.\"\n\nAnother concern, observed one Western diplomat, are \"credible\n\nreports of tax authorities and police paying special attention to businesses\n\nbacking Yushchenko.\" Some oblast (or state) governors have forced\n\npeople to sign petitions and attend rallies.\"\n\nBut assigning blame isn't easy. President Leonid Kuchma, the\n\npowerful head of state, is \"believed to be behind\" many of the problems,\n\nexplains one U.S. official. Indeed, he adds, the Prime Minister's staff says\n\n\"a lot of bad stuff is coming out of Kuchma's office and Yanukovych\n\ndoesn't want to cross him, which has credence.\"\n\nObserves expatriate businessman Alex Kiselev: \"In fact, very\n\nwell known that the relationship [between Yanukovych and Kuchma] is\n\na rocky one.\" In fact, many Yanukovych supporters genuinely seem to\n\nbe as wary of Mr. Kuchma and his associates as are Yushchenko\n\nbackers.\n\nA top American official notes: Mr. Yanukovych \"says the right\n\nthings privately. He kind of says the right things publicly.\" That is, Mr.\n\nYanukovych calls for a free and fair election, but doesn't denounce\n\nspecific abuses.\n\nHowever, \"We don't always do so in the U.S. so we can't hold\n\nthem to a higher standard here,\" the official wryly observed. Still he adds,\n\nWashington has suggested specific steps the Prime Minister could take to\n\npromote fairness but hasn't.\n\nUnfortunately, the U.S. has become an election issue.\n\nAdministration criticisms of Kiev have left the impression Washington\n\nhopes to influence the outcome.\n\nMoreover, Russia's Vladimir Putin is perceived to be boosting\n\nMr. Yanukovych, \"The Kremlin is actively involved in the campaign,\"\n\ncharges Medvedev.\n\nHowever, some of Mr. Yanukovych's allegedly \"pro-Russian\"\n\ninitiatives, such as raising the status of the Russian language, are\n\nprimarily matters of domestic politics.\n\nMoreover, geography and history ensure Russian involvement.\n\nOne poll found 80 percent of Ukrainians believe Ukrainian-Russian\n\nrelations should be a priority.\n\nMr. Yushchenko is seen as pro-Western but his coalition includes\n\nnationalists and anti-Semites. A U.S. diplomat says: If he comes to power\n\nI don't think you will see an increase in anti-Semitism. But you are more\n\nlikely to find anti-Semitism in western than eastern Ukraine, and that is\n\nhis power base.\"\n\nIronically, given the campaign-generated controversy, both\n\ncandidates seem likely to govern from the center. Konstantin Bondarenko\n\nsays they \"pretty much meld into one.\"\n\nThe Yushchenko camp argues differently. But the candidates'\n\ndifferences over policy toward the U.S. and Russia seem small.\n\nMr. Tigipko, a likely Prime Minister under Mr. Yanukovych, says\n\nRussian ties \"do not prevent Ukraine from getting integrated into the WTO\n\nand cementing an association with the EU.\"\n\nMr. Bondarenko asserts: \"Even though there are a lot of\n\nsimplistic assessments that Yushchenko is pro-West and Yanukovych is\n\npro-Russia, everyone understands that they will have to take a balanced\n\nposition.\"\n\nUkraine's election has been free if not entirely fair.\n\nLegitimate criticism of campaign abuses should not obscure the fact\n\nUkrainians are freely choosing their new president.\n\nDimitro Ponamarchuk of the Union of Free Journalists says, \"The\n\nsituation of democracy in the country is improving step-by-step.\" With\n\ncontinued work, Ukrainians will turn their political system into a true\n\nliberal democracy. -30- [Action Ukraine Report Monitoring Service]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDoug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Washington,\n\nD.C. and a nationally syndicated columnist.

KENYAN FIRM REPORTEDLY UNDER PROBE IN\n\nUKRAINE OVER ARMS TRADE\n\nKenyan newspaper Daily Nation web site, Nairobi, in English 12 Nov 04\n\nBBC Monitoring Service, UK, Friday, Nov 12, 2004\n\nNAIROBI - A Kenyan company is at the centre of an investigation into a\n\nmulti-billion shilling illegal weapons trade in the Ukraine. The company was\n\nexpected to deliver the shipment of aircraft and surface-to-air missiles,\n\nlong-range multiple rocket launchers, anti-tank missiles, radars and\n\nmachine-guns to an Iraqi customer, said Mr Serhiy Rudenko, a spokesman\n\nfor the Ukrainian prosecutor-general's office.\n\nFour people - from Greece, Iraq and Pakistan - were early this year arrested\n\non suspicion of the illegal weapons trade which was intended to procure\n\nsophisticated weaponry worth more than 64bn shillings (800m dollars) for\n\nan unspecified force fighting in Iraq, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.\n\nThe report did not specify which Iraqi force was a potential buyer of the\n\nweapons. Earlier this year, Mr Rudenko said the four also tried to hire\n\nmercenaries to fight in Iraq and other conflict areas.\n\nUkraine has long been under scrutiny for murky weapons deals and mis-\n\nhandling of its vast weapons depots inherited after the Soviet collapse,\n\nincluding the 2002 alleged sale of sophisticated radars to former Iraqi\n\nPresident Saddam Husayn. The allegation, which President Leonid Kuchma\n\nhas vigorously denied, badly strained relations between the United States\n\nand Ukraine.\n\nKenya has been cited as one of the most important transit points for illegal\n\nfirearms. Efforts by the Nation to identify the company were unsuccessful,\n\nbut local arms trade experts say the company may be registered in Kenya\n\nmerely as a cover. There is no known producer of heavy armaments in eastern\n\nand central Africa although the Great Lakes region has been the theatre of a\n\nlong-running conflicts in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Congo. Ukraine has\n\nbeen the source of tanks and military helicopters imported by Uganda and\n\nrebels in southern Sudan.\n\nA report prepared by the US Department in Washington three years ago\n\nnamed a Russian fugitive and tycoon Victor Bout as a leading illegal guns\n\nexporter to Kenya with Kilindini Port in Mombasa as a major conduit. Mr\n\nBout was said to be holed up in the United Arab Emirates where efforts to\n\ncapture him or curtail his operations had not been successful.\n\nThe tycoon and other arms traffickers were then reported to have been\n\ninvolved in the transportation of weapons and other military supplies to\n\nseveral countries in Africa using different routes. The weapons are smuggled\n\ninto the region by an underworld cartel through an elaborate network. The\n\ninternational gun-runner was said to operate from Angola, Cameroon, the\n\nDRCongo, Libya, Rwanda Sierra Leone, Sudan and Uganda. All illegal guns\n\nentering Kenya emanated from these countries.\n\nSome of the African airfields Mr Bout is said to be using frequently\n\nincluded Entebbe, Goma, Kigali and Luanda while seaports include Mombasa,\n\nDar es Salaam, Djibouti, Durban, Luanda and Monrovia. The desire for easy\n\naccess to Africa's immense mineral and forest resources has tempered the\n\nillegal arms trade to the extent that the UN found it difficult to bring\n\narms traders to book.\n\nWhile Mr Bout, who the UN accuses of stocking conflicts in the Great Lakes\n\nRegion is a known arms dealer, the protection he enjoys from governments of\n\nRwanda, Central African Republic an Angola meant his activities could not be\n\nexposed internationally. He is said to enjoy protection of some governments\n\nin the region, having once lived in Rwanda where his merchandise is said to\n\nhave stoked the 1994 genocide in which almost one million people were\n\nkilled.\n\nThe investigations in Ukraine are continuing and are likely to shed more\n\nlight on the Iraqi fighters' group for which the arms were meant and whether\n\nany of the arrested suspects have any Kenyan connection. -30-\n\n========================================================\n\nACTION UKRAINE REPORT-04, No.215: ARTICLE NUMBER FOURTEEN\n\nYour financial support is needed, please send a check.\n\n========================================================\n\n14.
