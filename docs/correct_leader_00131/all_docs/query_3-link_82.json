        "text": "KIEV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian politicians are beginning to position themselves to replace former prime minister Viktor Yushchenko after they ousted him in a no-confidence vote.\n\nYushchenko has said he is prepared to sit as caretaker prime minister for up to four days while the Ukrainian parliament chooses his successor.\n\nThe parliament voted 263 to 69 in the communist-sponsored no-confidence motion on Thursday. The reformist, who resigned officially on Friday, had held the post for two years.\n\nALSOYushchenko urged to challenge Kuchma\n\nPoliticians in the running to succeed him include former presidential candidate ultra-left Natalya Vitrenko who leads the Progressive Socialist Party. He held a party congress on Saturday, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported.\n\nOther groups were expected to hold closed talks.\n\nAnother potential candidate is Viktor Medvechuk, who represents one of several Social Democratic parties, and Serhiy Tyhypko of Ukrainian Labour, one of the sponsors of the no-confidence vote.\n\nThe communists, who hold 112 of the 450 seats, may have the strongest say in who follows Yushchenko.\n\nSome commentators say the best chance of securing parliamentary approval for a new prime minister may be to nominate a complete unknown to lead the government until next year's parliamentary elections.\n\nThey cite a previous example, a low-profile missile factory director who became prime minister in 1992 and is now in his second term as president -- Leonid Kuchma.\n\nYushchenko, regarded as Ukraine's most popular politician, can remain as acting prime minister for up to 60 days.\n\nA government source told the Reuters news agency that agreeing on a new prime minister could take longer than four days.\n\nYushchenko told representatives of six nationalist and centrist parties on Friday he wanted to stay in politics, but said he did not believe in \"destructive\" politics.\n\nAn estimated 15,000 protesters took to the streets on the day of Yushchenko's dismissal, many of them renewing calls to impeach President Leonid Kuchma whom they accuse of ordering the kidnap of a journalist who was later found killed.\n\nKuchma denies the charge.\n\nYushchenko may yet find a quick return to politics as some opposition groups say that Kuchma played a hand in his prime minister's dismissal and have called on Yushchenko to lead them in opposition.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nUkraine's Kuchma sacks minister\n\nMarch 27, 2001\n\nKuchma receives top level support\n\nMarch 16, 2001\n\nUkraine opposition defends protest\n\nMarch 11, 2001\n\nOusted Ukrainian PM vows to return\n\nApril 26, 2001\n\nUkraine no-confidence vote delayed\n\nApril 24, 2001\n\nUkraine set to oust PM\n\nApril 20, 2001\n\nKuchma refuses to meet opponents\n\nMarch 29, 2001\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nUkraine\n\nUkraine Parliament\n\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\nThe World Bank\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
