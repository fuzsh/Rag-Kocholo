Burckhardt, Jean-Charles

BornLeipzig, (Germany), 30 April 1773

DiedParis, France, 21 June 1825

Johann Karl Burckhardt (known in France as Jean-Charles) is best known for his contributions to Joseph-Jérôme Lalande’s catalog of 50,000 stars and for carrying out calculations based upon Pierre de Laplace ’s theories for the ephemerides of the Bureau des longitudes. Burckhardt studied mathematics in Germany and applied his knowledge to eclipse computations and to longitude determinations using lunar occultations. When Baron János von Zach was in search of an astronomer for his Gotha Observatory (Seeberg), Burckhardt was recommended to him, and he was hired to work on practical astronomy and to observe star transits. In France, Lalande had undertaken a similar search for the Observatoire de l’École militaire, of which he was director. In August 1797, Zach requested Lalande to have Brurkhardt placed at the Collège de France, his pension being paid by the Duchesse de Gotha.
