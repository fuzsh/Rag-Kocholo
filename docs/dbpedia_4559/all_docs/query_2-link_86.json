The collection below, which is posted here with his permission, is a wonderful resource, well worth perusing at your leisure.\n\nHistorical sense and poetic sense should not, in the end, be contradictory, for if poetry is the little myth we make, history is the big myth we live, and in our living, constantly remake.\n\nRobert Penn Warren\n\nHistory does not repeat itself. The historians repeat one another.\n\nMax Beerbohm\n\nTo know the truth of history is to realize its ultimate myth and its inevitable ambiguity.\n\nRoy P.

We fools, what do we know or care.\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams\n\nHistory is now strictly organized, powerfully disciplined, but it possesses only a modest educational value and even less conscious social purpose.\n\nJ. H. Plumb\n\n[History] may be called, more generally still, the Message, verbal or written, which all Mankind delivers to everyman.\n\nThomas Carlyle\n\nHistory is a science, no more and no less.\n\nJ. B. Bury\n\nThe past is always a rebuke to the present.\n\nRobert Penn Warren\n\nA country without a memory is a country of madmen.\n\nGeorge Santayana\n\nHistory is interim reports issued periodically.\n\nAnonymous\n\nImagination plays too important a role in the writing of history, and what is imagination but the projection of the author's personality.\n\nPieter Geyl\n\nHistory teaches everything including the future."
