Had such been the design, many details relating to his domestic and social life had probably been omitted. During the closing years of a long and eventful life, his children urged the octogenarian to write the history of his life, realizing, as he himself fully realized, that the most valuable heritage which one can leave to one's descendants is one's own history, provided it is the history of an active, unselfish, and useful life.\n\nIt is a source of regret that so few of the autobiographies of our prominent men deal with the details of their domestic and social life. It is probably due to the fact that the writers regard it as a sanctuary to be wirhdrawn from the public gaze, the key to which, when they are gone, is forever lost. Yet how much more thorough would be our understanding of their lives and actions, were we permitted to lift the curtain, and get the occasional glimpses of what lies hidden by its folds!\n\nThe details of student life at the German universities in the beginning of the last century; its intense idealism, which dealt with a world of dreams, yet which, when properly utilized by the great chancellor, a man utterly devoid of sentiment, made the creation of a vast empire possible, are sketched in these memoirs with a charming simplicity. The domestic life of German families of culture in the Fatherland; the emigrants' trials and struggles in the primeval forests of the\n\nvi\n\nFar West; the struggle of the young lawyer to make a precarious living at a time when judges and preachers rode the circuit, must be of interest to the careful student of the history and growth of a young nation.\n\nIn common with others of his contemporaries who attained eminence, Koerner had to overcome the disadvantages of a foreign birth and of very limited means. An indomitable energy, however, and a sincere desire to be of use to his fellowmen, enabled him to overcome these obstacles, until both in the ranks of the legal profession, and among the statesmen of the land, he gained an eminence attained by few. Coomparing him with the fremost of his contemporaries of German lineage, it may justly be said, that while he lacked the forensic eloquence of Carl Shurz, and while the erudition of John B. Stallo may have been greater, he surpassed both in a thorough understanding of constitutional limitations as applied to American institutions, and was a far better judge of the needs of the nation in measures and men than either of them. Thus, while in the National Convention of 1860, Shurz was one of the leading advocates of the nomination of William H. Seward for the Presidency, Koerner was equally emphatic as a supporter of Abraham Lincoln. History has long since rendered her verdict as to which of these two candidates was apt to be the fittest leader of the nation in the hour of its greatest need. It is a remarkable coincidence that while Koerner was thus active in giving to the people a President, who, with boundless love and toil, reunited the fragments of a nation, and who, of all his predecessors, left the sweetest memory behind him, he also materially aided in starting the nation's greatest military leader, U. S. Grant, on his phenomenal career.\n\nvii\n\nIn religious belief Koerner was an agnostic. Growing up in the atmosphere of German universities, the hot-bed of agnosticism, it could hardly be otherwise. But he was equally free from the intolerance of the zealot and that of the skeptic. While rejecting the mythology of the Christian religion, he was a firm believer in its ethics, as being superior to any which has heretofore actuated mankind. Freedom of conscience meant for him what it ought to mean, the right of every human being to formulate his own religious belief. He fully realized the truism, that it is not what one believes, but what ones does, actuated by such belief, that determines the merit of his faith. His letter to Robert Ingersoll, contianed in these memoires, is a lasting monument to his just conception of the freedom of conscience. In the small western community in which he lived, he was the abolute arbiter of men's opinions on public questions, because his integrity and his absolute freedom from partisan bias were such, that on all public questions his fellow townsmen were willing to conform their views to his without question.\n\nHis domestic life, like that of most of our public men of note, was exemplary. Although he felt keenly the early loss of all his sons but one, he bore the affliction with the fortitude of the philosopher. But the loss in later years of his wife and life-long companion, inflicted a blow from which he never recovered.\n\nTaking his life in its entirety, he was a man to whom the beautiful sentiment of the German poet was particularly applicable:\n\n\"Denn der das Beste that für seine Zeit,\n\nDer hat genug gethan für alle Zeiten.\"\n\nSt. Louis, June, 1909\n\nR. E. ROMBAUER\n\nix\n\nEditorial Prefatory Note.\n\nThe scope and design of the present Memoirs have been adequately indicated in the foregoing Preface by Judge Rombauer. The task of the editor has been solely that of interpreting, rectifying, and preparing for print the text of the Memoirs as it was presented to him in a typewritten copy of the original.\n\nThe original manuscript not having been accessible, this task involved the verification of proper and historical names and places, the interpretation of doubtful passages, paragraphing, the correction of sentence-structure and of certain Germanisms and solecisms of style, (the original was written in English when the author was over eighty years of age and was not intended for publication,) and the typographical preparation of the text for the press generally. At the same time, — it having been the express wish of the family of the author that the Memoires be left as nearly as possible in the shape and order in which he wrote them, — these corrections have been resticted to a minimum, and the author's individualities of style, and the personal note and flavor of his characterizations and descriptions, have been preserved as far as practicable.\n\nThe limitation indicated, and the conditions of the editing, will thus account for certain repetitions, for some descrepancies in the use of variant forms of proper names, and for the absence of all foot-notes and editorial explantions of possible errors of memory or of historical and literary reference\n\nx\n\nby the author. Yet, even here, and save in the impossible case of obscure proper names, the verifications of the editor have extended at least to determining the general accuracy of the author's statements; and any errors that may occur on this score, and that are not corrected in the index, are attributable to the state of the original text.\n\nBy the frequent interpolation of descriptive sub-headings, it is hoped that the purely historical and general discussions of the work will have been so relieved from the matter of purely personal and local interest that the reader will have little difficulty in discovering the passages that possess for him the greatest interest, and that the natural discursiveness and diffuseness of the text, as published under the intimated conditions, will thus, in great measure, be offset. An exhaustive index, supplied at the end of the second volume, will conduce to the same end.\n\nAll mention of contemporaneous events and persons in the work is to be interpreted with reference to the date and period in which these Memoirs were written, — namely, between the years 1889 and 1895. The narrative ceases with the year 1886.\n\nTHOMAS J. McCORMACK.\n\nLaSalle, Illinois, August, 1909.\n\n1\n\nChapter I. Birth, Parentage and Early Recollections.\n\nI was born at Frankfort on the Main, on the 20th of November, 1809. My father's house stood in a small square, called the TreÄ, from its being connected by a vaulted stone portal with the TreÄ Court, — a large avenue, at the south end of which stood a residence, of goodly size, but without architectural pretensions. Court and house belonged, or had belonged, to the Elector of TreÄ, who resided there at coronation times. In my childhood the court was surrounded on either side by large warehouses, where wholesale dealers in groceries, provisions, and leather, stored goods not immediately wanted at their business houses. It was a splendid place for me and our neighbors' children to play in, it being no common thoroughfare. Near the Electoral residence were large fine linden trees and a very good well. The doors of the warehouses being frequently open, when goods were taken out or in, it was just the place to play \"hide-and-seek,\" and \"robbers\" and \"gendarmes.\" Occasionally we fought real battles, particularly when boys from a distance encroached on what we considered our premises.\n\nTreÄ Court was connected by a short alley with what was then the main street of Frankfort, the Zeil; so that, when anything extraordinary was happening on that thoroughfare, we could run easily to this great artery of the city.\n\nThe neighborhood was a good one. On the square stood several private residences, and also other dwellings with roomy stores on the ground floor. My playmates were sons of merchants, professional men, master tailors and bakers, the latter at the time being generally men of means and influence, from whose ranks the third bench of the magistracy\n\n2\n\n(councilmen) had to be formed. I can only say that I passed some of my sunniest days in TreÄ Court.\n\nMy father, Bernhard Koerner, was a native of Stuttgart, in the present kingdom of Wuertemberg, the son of a respectable mechanic. He left that place, however, at the age of fifteen or sixteen, after receiving his education in a good school, and entered as an apprentice the book-store and publishing house of Palm and Enke in Erlangen. After he had completed his term, he was recommended by his employers to the great and celebrated book-selling and publishing firm of Broenner & Co., in Frankfort on the Main, and was an employee there (commis) for several years. When about twenty-three or four years of age, he became acquainted with my mother, Marie Magdelena Kaempfe, whose father conducted a book-bindery, a small retail book-store and stationery business. He was a man of means and gave my mother a good education in a private school, where French — a rare thing at that time — was very thoroughly taught. I have only a dim recollection of my maternal grandfather. When I was old enough to visit him, he was seventy-five years of age, and somewhat paralyzed. On his birthday and on New Year's day we would be taken to congratulate him, and would receive a silver dollar or two in return.\n\nMy father was barely of medium size, but well built and very muscular, with dark brown curly hair and very bright brown eyes. My mother had been a blonde, but in later years her hair had changed to an auburn color; she had large and very blue eyes, and a fair complexion.\n\nFor persons to analyze the character of their parents and pass judgment, however favorable, upon it, has always appeared to me rather indelicate. Love does not seek for reasons of its being. It is in a measure unconscious. I confine myself to saying that our parents loved us dearly, that we in return loved them, and that they deserved it. There was one trait, however, in my mother's nature that I cannot forbear mentioning. She could never in the least dissemble, and when the occasion called for it, she was one of the most\n\n3\n\noutspoken persons I ever met with. No power on earth could have compelled her to say anything she did not think.\n\nA Childhood Recollection.\n\nMy recollections run back to a very early stage of my existence. I could hardly have been more than two years of age, when I was for some reason very anxious to see my mother. I went to all the rooms on the second floor without finding her. I then climbed up the stairs to the third story, where were the bedrooms of my parents and older brothers and sisters. Not seeing her there, I went out into the hall again, where a door opened into a small room, called a cabinet, adjoining my mother's bedroom. I entered, and what I saw impressed itself upon my mind indelibly. On two chairs stood a little coffin; in it was a pale, lovely child, with my mother kneeling at its side, weeping. I was frightened, shut the door, and ran down stairs. From what I learned afterwards, it was the body of a little brother of mine, a year or so younger than I was. His name was Louis. I have no other recollection of the child.\n\nMy Naming.\n\nBut from my fourth year on, I have some very vivid recollections. And I may here say in passing that my having been named Gustave was owing to that eccentric King of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus IV, who, shortly before I was born, had, on account of his undying opposition to Napoleon, been forced to abdicate by his own people, who considered his warring against Napoleon as warring against fate to the detriment of his country. Nevertheless, this king had shown a chivalric spirit, and was the only continental prince who never bowed to the world's conqueror. My father hated Napoleon with all the fervor of his nature, and hence named me for the king.\n\nOne of the many reasons of my father's hatred of Napoleon was that Palm, the bookseller, for selling a pamphlet entitled \"Germany in its Deepest Humiliation,\" which he\n\n4\n\nhad not published, but merely had for sale, without knowing its contents, had been arrested, tried by a court-martial (in times of peace), and upon the express order of Napoleon had been shot at Braunau within twenty-four hours. My father as I have stated had served his apprenticeship with Palm, whom he had greatly loved and respected.\n\nMy other name, Philip, I got from an intimate friend of my father's, a merchant at Heilbronn, by the name of Roeder. I have in my possession a fine morocco case, containing a silver spoon, silver fork, and a knife with silver handle, which Mr. Roeder gave me as my godfather. From Gustavus Adolphus IV, I received no present, but my name only, which I owe not so much to him as to the first Napoleon.\n\nMentioning the latter, I may as well say, that I was told later that I had seen him.\n\nNapoleon in Frankfort.\n\nWhen in July or August, 1813, during an armistice, Napoleon, after a meeting with his wife at Mayence, returned to Dresden, and before the German campaign had re-begun, he passed through Frankfort. One of our servant-girls had been sent on an errand in the Zeil and took me with her. She saw a crowd on the sidewalk awaiting something, and was told that the Emperor, who had just entered one of the west gates leading into the city, was expected to drive through the street. She joined the crowd, and the carriage, an open one, drawn by six horses, soon appeared; she raised me on her shoulder and pointed out the Emperor to me. I have not the slightest recollection of the circumstance, but have no doubt that I saw him. This is the more strange, as events that followed not long afterwards became very distinctly impressed on my mind.\n\nThe bloody battle of Hanau, a village about ten miles east of Frankfort, had been fought on the 30th and 31st of October, 1813. The French, headed by Napoleon, had broken through the army of Bavarians and Austrians under General Wrede, who was striving to cut off the retreat of the French\n\n5\n\nto the Rhine. A small corps of Bavarians and Austrians had been posted on the heights south of the River Main, opposite to Frankfort, to prevent the crossing of the French.\n\nI never could understand why this position had been taken by the Germans; for the well-built and macadamized road from Frankfort to Mayence ran along the north side of the river Main, while on the south side were merely country roads, partly through low and sandy grounds, and ending opposite Mayence. The French would have had to cross the Main River again, at a place where there was no bridge. Perhaps it was expected that if only one road were left there might be crowding; and as the Bavarians, reinforced by the Prussians and Russians, were close upon the heels of the French after Hanau was fought, the rear guard of the French might in this way be struck and destroyed. Although Napoleon had the main army carried around the city, yet some of his guards and several batteries of artillery were sent through the city, to attack the Bavarians and Austrians on the other side of the river; for the batteries of the latter played on the Hanau road, on which the French retreated.\n\nSome German light troops had been thrown into the city; but when the large mass of the French, still some 80,000 strong, came near, the Germans retreated across the river, burning some of the wooden parts of the bridge which had been put on the main avenue of the otherwise solid stone structure, and leaving only the sidewalks for passage. Frankfort, until shortly before, had been a fortress; and these wooden planks had been placed in the bridge for the purpose of having them burnt, or taken off, should an attempt be made to cross the bridge from the suburb Sachsenhausen to the city.\n\nOn the first of November, some children including myself were in the front room of the second story of our house, and mother was busy dressing us in our Sunday clothes, when firing was heard close to our house. A servant who had been fetching water from a fountain near our house burst into the room, crying, \"Lord God! they are killing one another.\"\n\n6\n\nWe ran to the windows, and saw some Bavarians running past our house, with some French light troops after them. They disappeared in a moment; but in the distance we heard firing. The cannon began booming from the Muehlberg on the southern shore of the river, and the French batteries on the north answered; of this, however, I recollect nothing. At night the sky was lit up by the glare of fires. Two large mills near the bridge on the side of Sachsenhausen were burnt by the shells; also, some houses in Saehsenhausen. The French did not get across the bridge, and retired late at night. Being exhausted, hungry and thirsty, they commenced plundering; and it was fortunate that it was only a small corps that had been sent into the city to take the bridge, since, as already stated, Napoleon had ordered the main army to march around the city.\n\nA Family Incident of the Napoleonic Campaign of 1813.\n\nAnd here I must mention an incident which I heard of only later, but so often that it remained strongly fixed in my mind.\n\nWhen it became known Sunday morning that the French army had not been beaten at Hanau and diverted from their direct route to Mayence, the townspeople became greatly alarmed; for it appeared certain that the retreating army would now pass through the city, and that having been fighting for two days and being short of provisions it would most likely commit all kinds of outrages and would plunder adlibitum. Since some French troops, as above stated, actually had entered the city to attack the allies on the other side of the river, this fear semed to be well founded. It was not then known that the bulk of the army had been ordered to march around the city.\n\nMost families, on the streets where the French appeared likely to pass, locked up and barricaded their front doors and windows; while others adopted a different plan, which they understood had worked well in other places where troops had given themselves up to plundering, and this was to have the\n\n7\n\nhouse lighted, to prepare something to eat and to drink, and, by kind treatment and by assuaging hunger and thirst, thus to divert the soldiers from plundering and destroying property in their anger.\n\nOur mother had adopted this latter mode of treatment. Father had not been home since midnight of the day before. He belonged to a battalion of riflemen, a volunteer corps, which had enlisted many years before the French invasion, and which was occasionally called upon to assist the regular troops in the work of keeping order. There were very few regulars then in the city; for nearly all the troops had been in the campaign against the French army.\n\nIt must be understood that after the abdication of the Emperor Francis II and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in August, 1806, the free city of Frankfort had been allotted to Prince Primas Karl Theodor Von Dalberg, and had become part of the new Confederation of the Rhine, of which Prince Primas was the President and Napoleon the Protector, that is to say, absolute ruler. Some years later this principality was made the Grand Dukedom of Frankfort. The Confederation of the Rhine comprised nearly all the German States except Austria and Prussia, and had to furnish troops to the armies of the French. Until the battle of Leipsic, October 18, 1813, there could not have been less than 100,000 German troops fighting under the French eagles against the allied Prussians, Russians, and Austrians. After the battle of Leipsic, when the French in their rapid flight took the road to Mayence, there was great excitement in the city; and so the authorities had ordered out the rifle-corps to assist the Grand Ducal troops in policing the city and in maintaining order.\n\nMy father was second lieutenant and was stationed with his company at the main guard-house at the western end of the principal street, his watch beginning at midnight on the 31st of October. We children had all been safely packed away in a bedroom on the third floor. During the evening our house had not been disturbed. The large table in the main room, covered with bread, butter, slices of ham, etc.,\n\n8\n\nhad remained untouched, and mother (it being near midnight) was just about to snuff out the candles, when there was a loud knock at the front door. A young man by the name of Wehrle, whose father was an intimate friend of my father, and who resided at Forst, in what is now Rhenish Bavaria, owning there some of the best vineyards producing that choice wine, \"Forster,\" was at the time boarding at our house, and went down to open the door. He met two cavalry soldiers, guardes d'honneur, as they were called, who had tied their horses to a lamp-post in front of our house, and who asked for something to eat. He showed them up, and mother, who spoke French fluently, waited on them; they appeared much pleased, but did not like the light wine or cider which was on the table, and called for something stronger. Mother was imprudent enough to let them have some rum, which they swallowed greedily. But they left the room without trouble, and young Wehrle lighted them down with a candle.\n\nOne of the troopers had already left the house, when the other who was quite drunk, seeing that Wehrle had on a pair of good-looking boots, told him to pull them off, and give them to him as his were quite worn out. The young man hardly understood him, but from the signs the fellow made guessed that he wanted his boots, and naturally showed some reluctance to take them off. The Frenchman struck him in the breast, and Wehrle fell backward on one of the steps in a sitting position. The trooper tried to pull one of the boots off, but not succeeding he gave a strong jerk and the young man fell downstairs some three or four steps so forcibly that he broke his right leg above the ankle. The acute pain made him groan dreadfully. Greatly alarmed, mother ran to the head of the stairs, with a lighted candle, for the light which Wehrle had carried had gone out in the struggle. But, just at this moment, my father, having been relieved, and entering the hall, heard the cries for help, and saw the soldier still holding Wehrle. Father, who was very strong, and of a quick\n\n9\n\ntemper grabbed the Frenchman by the neck, tore off his cloak dragged him to the door and kicked him out.\n\nBut here comes the main point of the drama. The second trooper had mounted his horse, holding the other by the bridle, and waiting for his comrade. When father got into the doorway, the Frenchman seeing the plight in which his comrade was drew his long straight blade, and ran it into my father's breast, or at least tried to do so. Officers on duty at that time wore, on a chain around their necks, a small metal plate in the shape of a half-moon (Ringkragen) with the number of their regiment or battalion on it. It only came down some four inches on the breast where it was widest. The sword struck this little shield, glanced off and made only an ugly flesh wound. In later years, when I was a boy and went with father to the river bathing, I could still perceive this large scar. Mother in the meantime had come down, shut and locked the door, and heard the sacres of the Frenchmen, who, however, made off very quickly. A surgeon was called by the porter, father's wound attended to, and young Wehrle's leg set. The latter limped all his life. Father's cloak, a wide one, with a cape coming down to the knees, and of a dark green color, was kept for years as a memento of this adventure, though it had to do occasional service as a foot-cover, when riding out on cold days.\n\nThe French guardes d'honneur or cavalry troops referred to were organized early in the year for the German campaign. It was a hard matter, after the terrible losses in Russia, to recruit a new army in France, particularly cavalry. The Imperial government therefore issued a call for all young men not yet in the army, and able to furnish horses and to equip themselves at their own expense, to come to the rescue of their country. They were promised special privileges, were to be called guardes d'honneur and to rank with the old guards. Some regiments were recruited in this way, though not nearly as many as was expected. But, as soldiers, they did not answer at all the high expectations that people had entertained of them. They were generally arrogant,\n\n10\n\nlicentious, and wanting in discipline. Later in the war Napoleon withdrew nearly all his veteran cavalry from Spain and Italy, and they became formidable enough at the end of the campaign, under Murat, Arrighi and Grouchy.\n\nWhile, of course, I do not remember anything of that stormy night, I have the most clear and vivid recollection of some of the days following.\n\nThe Bavarians in Frankfort (1813).\n\nThe French reached Mayence next day, hotly pursued by Cossacks and Austrian light horse, but were now across the Rhine, safe at least for a while. On the 3d of November the Bavarians, who had fought most desperately at Hanau (Gen. Wrede being severely wounded while leading an attack in person), entered Frankfort amid the most joyful demonstrations of the people, who had at no time sympathized with the French and hated them cordially.\n\nIt was soon understood that the Bavarians were in a very bad plight. They had fought one of the bloodiest battles of the war, were very short of rations, and were completely worn out. Before they had been sent to quarters they had been drawn up in long lines on Main Street (Zeil) and when the word was given to stack arms most of them laid down on their knapsacks, greatly exhausted. But now the citizens came forth in crowds, with loaves of bread, cakes, sandwiches, pitchers filled with wine, beer, and brandy. The first ladies of the town served them food and drink. The more enthusiastic embraced and kissed them. \"Hoch Deutschland\" was heard from a thousand lips.\n\nOur household was not behind. Our porter and the servant-girl carried large baskets with meat and bread. My older brothers, Charles and Frederick, then quite grown boys, were also loaded down with victuals. My mother, leading me by the hand, superintended the distribution. How well I recollect the soldiers in their light blue uniforms, all bespattered with mud, their mouths black from biting cartridges; and how gratefully they looked upon us, when we\n\n11\n\nfilled the glasses with wine or beer and dealt them out nice little white rolls (Milchbroedchen)! I was only four years old then; but it appears to me now as though it was only a thing of yesterday.\n\nThe Allied Monarchs and Their Armies in Frankfort.\n\nA few days afterwards I saw another scene which made a strong impression on me. Alexander of Russia, with his brother Constantine, made a triumphal entry into Frankfort. My father had taken mother and my sisters Pauline and Augusta, a few years older than myself, to the house of a friend, a book-seller named Boselli, who lived on the Zeil. The house was called the Tuerkenschuss, a large wooden Turk with a pistol in his hand being fastened to the second story, after the manner of Turks and Indians stuck up before tobacco shops. From the window of the second story we saw every thing most completely.\n\nA regiment of Don Cossacks of the Russian Guards opened the procession. They looked splendid in their high caps of bear skin with richly embroidered short blue tunics, dark blue trousers of Turkish fashion, and long lances. While the ordinary Cossacks, and particularly what were called the irregular Cossacks, had very small and mean-looking though hardy ponies, the Cossack Guard was splendidly mounted, the horses of each regiment being of the same color. Immediately after them rode Alexander and Constantine surrounded by a most splendid staff, joined by Prince Schwartzenberg, the commander in chief of the allied forces, who had reached Frankfort the day before, also accompanied by a large staff, the chief of which was the afterwards celebrated Radetzky. Then came a regiment of Tcherkessen (Circassians) in splendid silver armor, curiously armed, with bows and arrows strapped to their shoulders.\n\nMany regiments of Prussian and Russian cavalry followed, and the whole was concluded by mounted artillery of the guards. It took an hour or so before they all passed before us marching in closed columns and taking the entire width of\n\n12\n\nthe streets, leaving the sidewalks only to the spectators. The bands of all these regiments were playing, but could not be heard for the wild hurrahs of the crowd, which went almost crazy with enthusiasm. It was a pageant never to be forgotten.\n\nThe King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria followed a few days after and also made splendid entries at the head of their guards, but I have no recollection of having seen them.\n\nThe headquarters of all the monarchs were now established at Frankfort. More than five thousand troops, mostly of the guards, were quartered there and in the villas and country seats around it. I recollect very well that we had three or four soldiers quartered at our house, one of whom was a Prussian regimental quartermaster and the others privates. Somewhat later we got Russians, who behaved very well when sober, but acted like swine when drunk. When too boisterous, my father would put on his uniform and command silence, when they at once became most submissive and called him \"Little Papa\" (Vaeterchen). They all had caught the common words of the language in their long march from the Vistula to the Rhine. They were very fond of children and one thing happened to me, which I do not recollect, but was told later on, showing their affection for children.\n\nIn the TreÄ Court, near our house, a detachment of Cossacks was quartered, the warehouses then being used as stables. As this court was my chief trysting place when I was a child, I was there one day looking at the Cossacks when one of them took hold of me, put me on his shoulder, and went off with me to a tavern a good distance from our home and played with me there for hours. I was missed after awhile, and my parents became alarmed. Finally they looked for me in the TreÄ Court, and fortunately learned from someone, who was a German, that he had seen a Cossack with a boy on his shoulder leaving the yard at its southern entrance. The trail was pursued and I was found in the inn, quite at my ease, amongst a crowd of Cossacks\n\n13\n\nand other soldiers. Almost every time I went into that Court I got some Cossack to take me upon his horse, or give me a ride, he leading his scraggy little pony.\n\nFor two months Frankfort was a most interesting place. Several hundred thousands of troops marched through or close by it on their march to the Rhine. The Emperors of Austria, Russia, the Kings of Prussia, Bavaria, Wuertemberg, all the other princes of Germany and nearly all their crown princes were in the city. With them were Metternich, Wolkowsky, Hardenberg, Castelreagh, Nesselrode, the great German Baron Stein, and Minister Humboldt. There were present the most popular heroes of the war, Bluecher, the Generals Gneisenau, York, Field Marshal Schwartzenberg, Buelow, Arndt, the friend and secretary of Stein, the latter being at the time the provisional head of all the countries which had belonged to the Confederacy of the Rhine, and had not yet made separate treaties with the allied powers. All these names and many more I must have heard a thousand times while the war lasted, until the battle of Waterloo. And now I must explain how it happened that I was made so familiar with the events and the names of the principal actors.\n\nFamily Connections with Famous German Patriots.\n\nMy father, as already observed, was a most devoted German patriot, although since 1806 Frankfort had been made one of the States of the Rhenish Confederation, and had therefore become one of the vassal dependencies of France. It was closely watched by the French Minister to the Grand Duke, Prince Primas, and had generally French troops in garrison. Father was always outspoken in his opposition to the French dominion. Whether he had been a member of the much-famed Tugendbund formed in Prussia after the Peace of Tilsit in 1807, I never learned; but subsequently to the retreat of Napoleon from Russia my father certainly formed connections with Prussians like Baron Stein, Arndt and others.\n\n14\n\nAt any rate after Prussia had declared war in March, 1813, and was joined by the Russians, he was furnished with all the appeals of the Prussian King calling his people and Germany to arms; with the proclamation of Kutosow at Kalisch in the name of the Emperor of Russia; as well as with the hundreds of other pamphlets which were published in Prussia urging the Germans to rise against Napoleon, and particularly with the stirring war songs of Arndt, Theodore Koerner, Stegmann, Schenkendorf and others. He took pains to distribute them in the States of the Rhine Bund in the rear of Napoleon's armies, who were then fighting mighty battles in Silesia and the other provinces of Prussia. There was only one other patriotic bookseller in Frankfort, Eichenberg by name, who dared to act likewise. Had the battle of Leipsic been won by Napoleon, the fate of the bookseller Palm would undoubtedly have overtaken my father.\n\nWhen, therefore, in November and December, 1813, the patriots of Germany met in Frankfort my father was called upon by many of them. Arndt was a frequent visitor at our house. He presented my mother with a beautiful tea cup decorated with an excellent portrait of the unfortunate Louise of Prussia, from the celebrated Berlin manufactory of porcelain. On holidays, this cup always had its place on our tea-table. With Stein and Bluecher father also formed a personal acquaintance. The connection with Stein was continued until my father's death in 1829, he having visited that great statesman many times at his castle at Nassau on the Lahn.\n\nIt is well known that during the time spoken of, November and December, 1813, there was a deadly struggle going on at Frankfort between two parties: (1) the reactionary party under the lead of Metternich, supported by nearly all the German princes who had belonged to the Confederation of the Rhine and who owed their higher titles and the increase of their States to Napoleon, which faction further included all the aristocrats, who had looked with great distrust upon the popular uprising that had actually defeated\n\n15\n\nNapoleon; and (2) the party composed of the Prussian statesmen and military leaders and of the German patriots generally supported at that time in a measure by the Emperor Alexander, who was pleased to be considered as favoring liberal tendencies.\n\nWe can now hardly believe it possible that the allied powers at Frankfort offered to make peace with Napoleon, leaving to France, as was said in the propositions submitted, its natural boundaries, the Alps, Pyrennees and the Rhine; in other words, leaving to France the western side of the Rhine or what is now Rhenish Prussia, Rhenish Bavaria, Rhenish Hesse, as well as the whole of Belgium, — the best and choicest provinces of the ancient German Empire.\n\nFortunately Napoleon was so infatuated as not at once to accept these most favorable terms. He gave an evasive answer. In the meantime the true German party had become aroused. Bluecher swore a thousand oaths. Stein used his great influence over Alexander. And as Napoleon had not shown any disposition to accept the conditions at once, the friends of Germany succeeded in breaking off the negotiations, which was done just a day before Napoleon offered to make peace on the basis first proposed.\n\nBluecher was the hero of the day. My father called into life the Bluecher Club (Bluecher Verein), which in a few days was joined by hundreds of the best citizens of Frankfort, and soon extended to neighboring cities. He was made its president. Its meetings were enthusiastic, and it aroused great opposition to Metternich's policy and to all reactionary measures.\n\nOf course I was too young to have any personal knowledge of all this, but in the course of years that interesting period was so often recalled in the family and amongst friends, that I could not help but become acquainted with it as of things I personally knew. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at that having grown up under such surroundings, I became a warm lover of Germany and one of the liberal sort.\n\n16\n\nDuring the year 1814 there was a constant flow of troops through Frankfort. Early in the year and spring they moved westward into France. After the taking of Paris and the conclusion of peace, large parts of the allied armies flowed backwards into Prussia and Russia.\n\nWhenever troops were in sight there was a large white flag hoisted on top of the Cathedral Tower (Pfarrthurm), and we boys would always run into Main Street, the Zeil, to see them pass. We did not care much about the infantry, but the cavalry and artillery were great attractions. That during those war times boys, small and large, were playing at soldiers in preference to any other game was but natural. I have no doubt that the great interest I took in military matters through life was owing to these early impressions.\n\nAnniversary of the Battle of Leipsic.\n\nThe celebration of the anniversary of the battle of Leipsic in 1814 was of such an exciting character, that I have a distinct remembrance of it. After solemn church-services in the morning there were parades of all the battalions of the civic guards (Buergerwehr). In the afternoon the children of all the schools, the boys with oak leaves on their caps, the girls with wreaths of oak leaves in their hair, assembled on the Roemerberg, where speeches were made, and all joined in patriotic songs.\n\nI do not know that I saw all this then. But after night had set in, our parents took us through the principal streets. The whole city was splendidly illuminated. Thousands of transparencies appeared on the houses, with mottoes in prose and verse, and pictorial representations.\n\nThe most glorious view, however, was outside of the citygates, on the rising ground. On the highest peaks of that beautiful range of mountains, the Taunus, some thirty-five miles in length and all visible from high points about the city, eight miles distant, immense piles of cord wood had been put up, forming hollow squares filled with tar barrels and other inflammable materials. The largest, some fifty feet\n\n17\n\nhigh was on the Feldberg (3000 feet in height). Other fires were burning on the Altkoenig, at the castles of Koenigstein, Cronberg, Falkenstein, and on the heights north of Homburg. Looking south, the range of the Bergstrasse, extending from near Darmstadt to Heidelberg, some twenty miles of mountain, was also in a blaze. On the highest point, the Melibocus (1,600 feet), there must have been an enormous pile; for, although distant from Frankfort some thirty miles, it was seen as bright as the one on the Feldberg.\n\nAll the hills around the city were similarly illuminated. Fireworks let off in the gardens around the city made the dark night light as day. Bands played their best, and on the other side of the Main the artillery fired one hundred and one salvos. My father carried me on his shoulders, and I was half frightened, half delighted. The noise was terrific.\n\nThose jubilee fires extended throughout the whole of Germany that night.\n\nThe Year 1815. Bluecher.\n\nThe following year was still a warlike one. Napoleon having returned from Elba in March, 1815, the armies of the allies, some of them still on their way from France, rushed back towards the Rhine. Consequently Frankfort, the great thoroughfare for all northeastern Germany and Russia, again saw thousands of troops marching through it. The battle of Waterloo, June 18, ended the short campaign and sent Napoleon to St. Helena.\n\nBluecher on his return, being now more popular than ever, stayed a few days in Frankfort. He took his lodgings in the Weidenbusch (now the Union Hotel), a large hostelry on the Steinway, opposite the White Swan, another famed Hotel. In the night he was serenaded by the drummers of all the different battalions of the civic guards, and by the bands of the line-regiments. Father had secured for our family a front room in the White Swan from which we could see the immense crowd, forming a dense mass in the street before the Hotel. The old hero stepped out on the\n\n18\n\nbalcony, and made a short, but eloquent speech. There were hurrahs and \"vivats\" without end. I had a good look at the hero, and, being then six years of age, I kept his appearance very well in my memory.\n\nBluecher was a very happy speaker by nature, and fond of hearing himself. It is said he acquired much practice in public speaking in the Freemasons' lodges. He was a zealous member of this association. While his orthography, as is well known, was so bad as to be almost amusing, he spoke correctly when it suited him.\n\nThe next evening the Bluecher Verein gave him a banquet, where my father, being president, toasted him; and Bluecher, as father told us, made a most happy reply, being quite sarcastic as to the doings of the diplomats, whose leniency towards the French he denounced bitterly. He was also for having Alsace and Lorraine back again. Of this, of course, I speak only from hearsay. This is the last of my war reminiscences, Germany resting in peace until 1848, long after I had left it.\n\n19\n\nChapter II. School Life.\n\nAnd now my education began. My oldest brother Charles had attended the lower classes of the Frankfort College (Gymnasium), where, as became a city of merchants, French and, in the upper classes, even English were taught; also, arithmetic, caligraphy and drawing were not neglected. Here he remained until he became an apprentice in father's business, afterwards serving a year or so as clerk in a large book-selling and publishing establishment at Halle on the Saale, and then returning home to become the principal clerk in father's business.\n\nFrederick was, at this time (1815), in a private school of much repute at Roedelheim, about two miles from Frankfort, and known as the Hoffmann Institute. French and English were taught thoroughly there. Finishing his course, he became apprentice in a large wholesale firm, Behrens & Co., dealing in the so-called \"colonial articles.\" He was very bright, versatile and talented, a fine draftsman and musician, golden-haired and blue-eyed, the pet of everybody, and therefore spoiled. More of him hereafter.\n\nCharles was taller, had the dark hair and eyes of father, was of a quiet temper and industrious, perhaps a little too unselfish for a business man, and too liberal in his political views when the Reaction set in, as it did, not very long after the War of Liberation.\n\nAt the Musterschule.\n\nMy mother taught me to read and spell when I was about five years of age; not at regular hours but thoroughly nevertheless. She even gave me lessons in French, using Meidinger\n\n20\n\nfor the rules of grammar. But I learned more from her talking to me in that language than from the book. When I was about seven years of age, I was sent to the \"Model School\" (Musterschule). This was then a comparatively new institution, which some wealthy public spirited citizens had subsidized, the city furnishing all the grounds and buildings, and, I believe, guaranteeing deficits, but reserving to itself the superintendence, and, with the sanction of the trustees, the appointment of teachers.\n\nIt was far superior to the then existing public and private schools, had seven classes for boys, and five for girls, in separate buildings. The teaching was on the Pestalozzi plan. There was little memorizing, and the pupils had always to explain the \"why\" of things. Even in the lowest classes there was but little corporal punishment. None was permitted in the higher. You were kept in school after school hours to learn the lessons you had neglected, or as a penalty for bad conduct. But the usual punishment was that during play-time you had to stay in the building. There were, with the director, some nine teachers; and in the girls' department, two women teachers to teach knitting, sewing, embroidering, and the like. To have women teaching in other branches than these was then considered absurd; and to have them instruct and watch boys, oftentimes grown up, as in this country, would have been condemned as ridiculous and in the highest degree indelicate. Some of our teachers were men of great ability, such as Mr. Naenny, a pupil of Pestalozzi, and Mr. Diesterweg, who was later on considered the greatest educator in Germany. There were also Professor Mueller, a distinguished mathematician and physicist, and Mr. Du Veillard, a French Swiss, a severe and morose man, but an excellent French teacher.\n\nI did not know Mr. Diesterweg. He did not teach then in the boys' department. But my sisters, particularly Pauline, were enthusiastic in their praise of him. They loved him as they would a father. Owing to my ability to read and to cipher some, I went through the lowest form in a\n\n21\n\nhalf year, while the regular course in every class was one year. I did not reach the highest class, for my parents had destined me for a liberal profession, and thought it was high time that I should enter the gymnasium or college. During my last year in the Model School, I had taken private lessons in Latin so that when I entered college, I skipped the two lower classes and was promoted within a half year from the fifth to the fourth grade, while the regular term in the lower classes was one year, and in the higher even one year and a half. But even in the second highest class I got through in one year, instead of one and one-half. While I was in the Model School nothing extraordinary happened in my school life. I was not very industrious, but owing to a quick perception and a faculty of expressing what I did know with facility, I generally kept on the front benches and often at the head of them. Perhaps it would have been better, had I been obliged to study more industriously. I was tolerably wild, but somehow or other my teachers were rather easy on me, and my schoolmates liked me the better for it.\n\nMy Reading.\n\nFrom an early age I was a great reader. In my father's store I found, of course, a large collection of books, and the hours not given to studying my lessons or to playing were spent in all sorts of miscellaneous reading; fairy tales, but more so, travels, and later on novels. I think, before I was fourteen years of age, I had read all the novels of Cooper then out, also of Walter Scott. Washington Irving delighted me greatly. I had read all the poetry of Schiller and his dramas, and had learned by heart nearly all his ballads, reciting them to mother and my sisters in the twilight hours. But not all my early literature was of this noble character. The then very popular romances of robbers and robberknights interested me also, as did other sensational stuff. I do not think the latter did me any harm. I would only read those parts where there were tournaments, bouts, spectres, and the like. As to love-scenes, I felt no interest in them then, and\n\n22\n\nI skipped them invariably. Sentimentality was always hateful to me, and the only sentimental novels I liked, or yet like, were Rousseau's \"La Nouvelle Héloise\" and \"Werther's Sorrows.\"\n\nHome Life in Frankfort.\n\nWhen I was about seven years of age and while at the Model School, our family left our home in TreÄ Square and moved to a very large residence in Toenges Street, a street running parallel with the Zeil and also with TreÄ Square. It was but a little distance from our old home. There was a large inner court, bounded on the east side by a high wall, on the south side by the rear of the front house, on the north side by a roomy two-story house, and on the west side by a large wing of the main house. A passage in the two-story house led to a garden, about fifty by a hundred feet. There were some cherry trees in it, a piece of lawn on which stood a high substantial swing, a long middle walk over which trellis work was built, supporting grape vines. Yard, garden, and the many unused rooms in the rear house furnished most excellent playground, and my school fellows found it convenient to pay me frequent visits.\n\nWe lived there four years when father bought a house on what is called the Neue Kraeme. This was an elegant and lively street, extending from a tolerably large square with a fountain in it, called the \"Mount of our Dear Lady\" (Liebfrauenberg), and having on the north the Catholic Church of Our Dear Lady, to the Roemerberg on which the old Rathhaus or Council House of Frankfort stands. That square had also a fountain in it, with a battered old statue of Justice with scales in one hand and a sword in the other, very much the worse for wear.\n\nOur residence was only one house removed from the large and splendid building called the Braunfels, which occupied a block by itself, contained large halls and extensive galleries, in which during the Frankfort fair the merchants who dealt in the most expensive and showy goods had their stores. Here were the silversmiths' and jewelers' goods, glass and\n\n23\n\nporcelain, prints and engravings, perfumeries, and the choicest of dry goods. In coronation times it had been occupied by the Electors and other Princes of the Empire. In the large courtyard and the adjoining corridors the Exchange (Boerse) was held every week-day from eleven to one o'clock. The Braunfels fronted partly on the Liebfrauen square. The Eoemerberg, at the time of the fair, was covered with booths, in which all kinds of goods were on sale; while the immense halls on the ground floor of the Council House were also used as shops.\n\nOn fine days, in fair time, the Neue Kraeme was so filled with people that you could not throw a cherry stone into the streets without hitting somebody. The boulevards in Paris or Broadway in New York, as far as crowding was concerned, were, in my time, not to be compared with it. Carriages had often to turn into other streets. All vehicles had to proceed in a walk. All processions and military parades, since they always had to go to the old Council House, passed our windows. In fact, it was for people who do not love retirement, a most desirable street to live in. It had the further advantage, that my college was only two blocks away, on the Barfuessler Platz (Place of the Barefooted Friars), now the Paul's Platz. Our house was four stories high and had a mansard roof, under which there were three or four rooms. It had no garden, but two small inner courts, and so great was the space that the third floor was always rented.\n\nAfter I went to college our domestic life was in the main that of the citizens of Frankfort generally. It must be understood that to have been a citizen of Frankfort meant a good deal more than is ordinarily understood by the word \"citizen.\" By the acts of the Vienna Congress, Frankfort, Hamburg, Luebeck and Bremen were declared to be free and independent States; while formerly, until the establishment of the Bhenish Confederation, they had been free and Imperial cities only: that is, they were not subject to any territorial Prince, but yet to a certain, though very small extent, they were subject to the central power of the Emperor and the\n\n24\n\nImperial laws. The citizens of these Imperial cities, even then very proud, had their representatives at the Imperial Diet. Now they felt themselves still more exalted. And this citizenship, moreover, was a sort of closed corporation. No one could become a citizen and an elector and so eligible to office, unless he was the son of a citizen, or unless he had married the widow or the daughter of a citizen, and in the latter case he had to pay a large sum in addition in order to enter the corporation. A large majority of the inhabitants were not citizens, and had no political rights. There were amongst the citizens proper, very few poor people. Most of them were in very easy circumstances, and a good many of them were not only rich but possessors of very large fortunes. I speak now of the time when I was at school, in college, and up to the time of my confirmation, which happened when I was about sixteen years of age (1824).\n\nReligious Training. Family Portraits.\n\nMy father, although, like my mother, baptized and educated in the Lutheran creed, had, I have reason to believe, very free and liberal religious ideas. He seldom went to church, but approved of my mother and the children going pretty regularly. He never said a word against religion, but was very much opposed to dogmatism and particularly mysticism and pietism. So was my mother. She was a very religious woman. Every Sunday morning, before church-hours, my sisters and myself, when we were children, came to her bedroom, where she would read a chapter from some work of edification, usually from the then much admired \"Hours of Devotion\" by Zschokke. She would herself go to church occasionally; but my sisters and I, after I had arrived at the age of ten or twelve years, went pretty regularly, and generally to the large Lutheran Church of St. Katherine's on Main Street, the pastor of which was Anton Kirchner.\n\nKirchner was a very distinguished man in Frankfort. An impressive, but by no means sensational preacher, he was a man of learning, a public-spirited citizen, and a warm\n\n25\n\nGerman patriot. He was the author of a well-written history of Frankfort, which, however, he did not live to complete. He had written, also, some theological works, in a most rational and liberal spirit. Whenever there was any benevolent work to be done, he was at the head of it. He was one of the founders of the Frankfort Museum, an association for the encouragement of literature and the fine arts, where regular lectures were delivered. He moved in the highest official circles, though at the same time a great friend of the poor and lowly. No one in his time was better known in the city, then comparatively small, containing no more than 45,000 inhabitants. I believe every man, woman and child knew him. He had a great likeness to Luther, and was even more corpulent than that great reformer. My father was a friend of his. Kirchner had baptized and confirmed all the younger children. But we did not confine ourselves to one church. In the winter we often went to the German Reformed Church, which was far more comfortable at this season of the year than the larger Protestant Church. Occasionally I went to the French Reformed Church, or rather chapel, fronting the city park (Stadt-Allée), where there were very able ministers, preaching in the purest French. After my confirmation, in 1824, I think, and until I left for the University, I did not go to church often.\n\nSpeaking of confirmation, I cannot but mention an incident happening when my sister Pauline, who was about four years older than myself, was confirmed. The custom is, or was at that time, that the pupils to be confirmed or consecrated should approach the altar in pairs, and that generally only those who were intimate friends should go together. My sister had already become engaged as a partner to a schoolmate of hers, a young lady of a family of high standing. Previously to the confirmation, for some three months, the pastors of the respective churches to which the candidates belonged formed a class, where once or twice a week religious instruction was given preparatory to the consecration. In the class with Pauline was a beautiful girl, Miss U., the\n\n26\n\ndaughter of two members of the troupe of the Frankfort City Theatre. These people, who had been connected with that institution for years, were, though not great actors, people of the most respectable character. Miss U. herself had played occasionally in juvenile parts, and became afterwards a regular actress, very much admired for her uncommon beauty and maiden-like modesty. A few days before confirmation day, it became known in the class that Miss U. could find no partner. The girls all liked her, but their parents, and they themselves, were so prejudiced that none would walk with her to the altar. Pauline, with the full consent of father, and with but a shade of reluctance on the part of her mother, disengaged herself in becoming manner from her chosen partner and went with Miss U., whose heart had almost been broken by the disdain she had met with from the other girls. Pauline had never known Miss U. before she met her in the confirmation class. But it was a charming sight to see the pair walk up to the altar. Miss U. was of surpassing beauty, with rich dark hair, blue eyes, a perfect form, and full of grace. Pauline was considered a very beautiful girl. Her hair was very long and of a golden blonde; she had large dark blue eyes, and a beautiful complexion. She was not so tall as Miss U., but was equally well formed. A life-size picture by a then celebrated portrait painter, Mosbrucker of Constance, still in my possession, will show that I have not been partial in speaking of Pauline. The same painter made a small portrait of my mother, which is really a masterpiece.\n\nSpeaking of Mosbrucker, I have another portrait of his in my possession, — the portrait of Karl Ludwig Sand, the student of Jena, who in 1819 assassinated the Russian Councilor of State, Von Kotzebue. He was actuated, as he thought, by the purest motives; and indeed he was a young man of unstained character and of the austerest morality. After his fanatical deed he inflicted upon himself a mortal wound but lived to be tried for murder and was executed at Mannheim. Mosbrucker painted this portrait in prison for Sand's mother and duplicated it for himself. Shortly afterwards\n\n27\n\nhe took up his usual abode at our house, painting portraits for Frankfort people; and, finding that father, though not approving of Sand's action, had the deepest sympathy for the young man, (who imagined he had done a patriotic deed in destroying a man whose whole life had been employed to demoralize the public and who had acted a traitor to his country in denouncing the German Universities to the Czar of Russia as the instigators of revolution,) Mosbrucker made my father a present of the portrait. It is more like the portrait of a girl than of a man. The forehead is broad, but not very high; the eyes are deep brown and show a brilliancy produced probably by the sickly pallor of the cheeks. The mouth is very beautiful and small, the face itself rather round than oval and encircled by dark brown hair coming down in curls to his shoulders. While it cannot be said that the face is very handsome, yet it is certainly a very interesting one. He bore his painful lingering illness with the submission of a saint, never complaining; and when he was led out to the scaffold, all the prison officials wept and the prisoners in their cells cried like children. The executioner, the judges, the ministers who called upon him, all broke out in tears; he alone was most serene, thanked them all for their sympathy, and even, by way of anticipation, thanked the executioner; for, said he, \"After you have done the work which you hate so much to do, I could not thank you.\"\n\nA portrait of my father by a painter of local reputation, Mr. Sehlesinger, is by no means so well painted, but a remarkable likeness. Sister Augusta, five years younger than Pauline, was also a most beautiful child, with auburn hair reaching to her knees, and dark blue eyes. Unfortunately, she was quite early stricken with disease, and became an invalid all her life; though, for that very reason, more dearly beloved by us. Her condition, however, which excluded her from many youthful enjoyments, cast a constant gloom over our family life. The later years of her life were spent at Wiesbaden with mother, using the waters, though with little\n\n28\n\neffect. She died there some time in 1837 or 1838. She was a woman of superior mind.\n\nI must now mention another brother, who was seven years younger than I, and who was born in the house on the TreÄ Square. He was named Theodore, after the hero and poet Theodore Koerner of the Luetzow Corps, who fell in the battle of August 26, 1813. He was a most lovely child, with blue eyes and light hair, and highly intellectual, — too much so to promise a long life. I doted on him, and when he died in 1826, about 9 years old, from a cold he took at a May festival, it gave the first pang to my young heart, and one which I have not overcome to this day.\n\nAt College.\n\nAt the gymnasium or college I got along very well, and formed friendships there that have lasted in some instances until now. Most of my classmates and fellow-students at the University have, — some long since, and some but lately, — gone to the land from which no traveler returns. The institution itself was at the time I attended it, not what it ought to have been. The director was not, though he pretended to be, a profound scholar. Besides, he was a bigoted devotee, and given to mysticism. Neither teachers nor scholars liked him. The lower classes had only teachers of mediocrity. In the higher classes there were some stars, such as Professor Conrad Schwenk, a deep thinker, a good philologist, and in every way a complete man. Professor Herling was a good mathematician and a master of German style. Professor Weber was an elegant scholar, and almost the only one who could make the reading of Cicero and particularly Horace, interesting to us. He tortured us, however, a good deal by dictating to us long essays in German on Roman history, which we were to translate into Latin at home. He wanted us to become elegant writers in Latin. I do not think he succeeded, at least he did not with me; for when it came to writting two Latin dissertations in 1832, when I was a candidate for doctor of law at the University of Heidelberg, one on a\n\n29\n\ncontroverted point in the Pandects, and the other on an equally controverted point in the canon law, I had a great deal of trouble. I had to call in my amiable friend Feddersen (from Holstein) a student of philosophy and philology, to give them a sort of Ciceronian finish. How I got through the oral examination in Latin so well, I did not then understand nor do I now. As long as the dean of the faculty, the celebrated Professor Thibaut, examined me in the Pandects, the matter was not so difficult, because I had read and studied them in Latin; but when Professor Mittermeier took me through the German civil and mercantile law and Professor Rosshirt through the German criminal law and criminal procedure, and Professor Zachariae made me tell what I knew of the history of the law of the old German Empire, I was several times rather nonplussed. Still I got, though not the highest, yet the next highest honors, \"Insigni cum laude,\" which was a success considering that I had spent only the last semester of my University life in Heidelberg, and that with the exception of Mittermeier, I had not attended the lectures of any of the examining professors. The University of Heidelberg on the fiftieth anniversary of my doctorate made a very curious mistake. In their letter of congratulation, they said that I had obtained the highest grade, \"summa cum laude,\" which is hardly ever given. My diploma shows their error. The grades at Heidelberg were: \"Summa cum laude,\" \"insigni cum laude,\" \"maxima cum laude,\" \"magna cum laude,\" and \"cum laude,\" which last grade we used to call \"feliciter evasit\" — \"he has by luck escaped non-admittance.\"\n\nOur other professors in Greek and Latin were mere pedants. If they had been teachers of a theological or philological seminary, they might have been in their right places; but four-fifths of us were destined for the bar or for the medical profession, and wanted to get to the very soul of ancient literature simply by reading much and having our minds directed to the beauties of the old authors. In the highest classes it took just one-half year to go through one book of the Aeneid, and equally long for one of Homer. We had\n\n30\n\nlearned dissertations on the caesura, and on the Greek particles and accents. It took us the same time to read a single oration of Demosthenes; and as if it had not been a sufficiently severe test to translate it into German, we had in addition to translate it into Latin, while during the whole hour nothing but Latin was allowed to be spoken.\n\nThe French language was not well taught at college, owing probably to the fact that lessons had to be given to several classes at once, so that there were by far too many scholars. English was taught only in the highest class (Prima) and since it, like French, was an optional study, our class did not have more than a dozen in it. The teacher, Mr. Will, was able, and we got pretty deeply into the beauties of Addison, Steele and Burke. I did not read Shakespeare in English until I was at the University of Jena, where fellow-students from Hamburg, Luebeck and other northern states, formed a Shakespeare Club, of which I was a member.\n\nHenry Hoffmann and \"Struwwelpeter.\"\n\nAlmost all my schoolmates in the higher classes of the Frankfort gymnasium became men of distinction and high repute in the Frankfort commonwealth, serving as burgomasters, senators, and filling judges' seats or holding high positions as lawyers or physicians. One of them, however, and he happened to be my most intimate friend, Dr. Henry Hoffmann, attained a national, or rather an international, reputation. He was the author of \"Struwwelpeter,\" both text and pictures, — a little juvenile book, which has reached numberless editions, and has been translated into all known languages. I believe, and I have no doubt, that in the United States alone, from first to last, more than one hundred thousand copies have been sold. He told me, in 1862, that he had prepared this little book solely for his own children's amusement and instruction, without the least idea of ever publishing it. But the children showed it to their friends, and it\n\n31\n\ncame to be read by their parents, some of whom insisted that it should be printed. He finally consented, thinking it would be bought in Frankfort as a Christmas gift for children for the current year, and would then be forgotten. Nobody was more surprised at its immense circulation than he himself. He at first disliked the noise made about it. He had gained some reputation as a serious poet, and still more as a successful and learned physician, which he did not desire to be overshadowed by this little humorous performance, which was the child of a few days only.\n\nI said that Hoffmann was a real poet. A collection of his poems saw several editions, a rather rare thing in Germany. But on several occasions, such as the Mozart jubilee and the Goethe centennial anniversary, he wrote odes and songs, which are in my possession and are of much merit. In 1848 a banquet was given to the popular poet, Anastasius Gruen (Count Alexander von Auersberg), a liberal delegate to the German Parliament. The song for this occasion by Henry Hoffmann was most enthusiastically received. I will give the first strophe:\n\n\"Horch auf, mein Volk! ob deutschen Landen\n\nGeht brausend jetzt ein Sturm empor,\n\nHoch weht dein Banner, frei von Banden,\n\nUnd beugen soil's der Sturm nicht mehr!\n\nTreu Hand in Hand,\n\nFest Mann an Mann,\n\nMein Vaterland,\n\nDein Tag bricht an!\"\n\nThis was the time of a golden dream of a great and united Germany, for which he and I had fondly hoped when at college, and which so soon turned out an illusion. He had soon to sing his bitter disappointment. The imperial crown offered by the Parliament to Frederick William IV of Prussia was by him refused, because, as was said, the crown had been rubbed with too many drops of democratic oil. This rejection drew from Hoffmann the following lines:\n\n32\n\n\"Du, Koenig, hast's verschmaeht! Du wagst es nicht!\n\nDu willst nicht her zum freien Volke!\n\nWohlan! So zaudre bis das Wetter bricht\n\nVerderblich aus der finstern Wolke.\n\nWann dann du rufst ‘Heran, mein Volk, zu mir!’\n\nDann wird das Volk sich auch bedenken,\n\nWir sind getrennt: Du dort, wir stehen hier,—\n\nWir haben keine Krone zu verschenken.\"\n\nI think I can claim some trifling credit for the development of Hoffmann's poetical talents. My father had a poetical vein. After his death a package was found, in which were a small number of songs, all printed on separate slips. Some were written toward the end of the eighteenth century in the then highly sentimental style; others, at a later period, were of a patriotic character, and, it appears, were written for the meetings or festivities of the Bluecher Union.\n\nEarly Poetical Efforts.\n\nWhen I was about fourteen years of age I spent some time at Kreuznach, among intimate friends of my parents. With some of their sons I made excursions into the neighborhood, which is full of the finest and most romantic scenery. We visited the Rheingrafenstein, in the beautiful valley of the Nahe, called Minister Thal, Franz Von Sickingen's Ebernburg, the castle of Dhaun, of Sponheim, and other old historic ruins. It was then that I first tried my hand at poetry. I wrote half a dozen epigrams on those grand relics of ancient times, some of which are still extant in a manuscript collection of my poetical sins.\n\nWhen in Prima (the highest class), towards the end of my stay at college, I fell most desperately in love with the sister of one of my friends. She was a year or two older than I, and, as I soon learned, already engaged to the son of a very prominent merchant. That made, however, no difference to me. Of course, she knew nothing of my passion. I saw her at her home a few times, when I called upon my friend and classmate; but of course, never alone, for in\n\n33\n\nGermany no young gentleman was allowed to call on a lady, and no young lady permitted to receive the visit of a young man except in the presence of her parents or older members of the family. At any rate this was so at the time I speak of. But I was in ecstacy when lucky enough to see her in the public promenades or in the street. I would, at a respectful distance, follow her steps. She was of surpassing beauty, had dark hair, and her eyes were of the most brilliant black. When much later I read Platen's poems, I was always reminded of her by the lines. \"Der schwarzen Augen, die mir Sterne deuchten,\n\nGeheimnissvolles, dunkel gluehendes Leuchten.\"\n\nHer figure was rather small, but exquisitely formed. That I do not flatter Lina, will appear from a passage in a letter from my sister Pauline, which I received in June, 1830. \"When I was the last time at the museum with Charles,\" she writes, he being a member of that society, \"I saw Mrs. K. (Lina), who greeted me most kindly and addressed me. But oh, what a rare beauty, what loveliness! You were no fool. I had not seen her for a long time and I was really astounded.\" But how did she ever know of my passion for Lina? No one but Hoffmann knew of it and he only because he had confided to me his love for one Jenny. He must have betrayed me after I had left for Jena. We corresponded; I enclosed my letters to him in those I wrote to my family; and he his in those or Charles or Pauline. In the very letter in which the above lines about Lina are found, came one from him in which he very humorously informed me of the marriage of Lina to Mr. K., leaving a blank space to be filled, as he said, with curses damnation-deep. I am almost certain that he then spoke to Pauline about this, my first love-matter.\n\nNow, Hoffmann was then my nearest neighbor on the school bench, and I believe he alone knew of my admiration for Lina. One time during a lesson which did not interest me, I wrote an epigram, or rather an anagram, on my love,\n\n34\n\nthe initial letters of each line forming her given name. I showed it to him. \"Well,\" said he, \"that is not so very bad, but I think I can beat it.\" After a little he showed a scrap of paper to me on which was written the same anagram, much superior to mine.\n\nWe both felt interested, and pursued poetry, composing it in our school hours. He was a splendid draftsman, and generally enlivened his little pieces with some arabesque or small figures. His caricatures were really very good. The same winter he and I started a reading club. We met at my father's house, it being the central part of the city. We commenced with Goethe's and Schiller's dramas, the different parts being assigned by the president for the members to read. We soon got into Shakespeare, so beautifully translated by A. W. Von Sehlegel. Hoffmann read Falstaff to perfection. In speaking of my early travels, I will have to say more of him. At the University, we did not meet. I went to Jena, Munich and Heidelberg. But when I came to the latter place, he had left it and gone either to Berlin or Wuerzburg. When I passed a year in Frankfort after leaving Heidelberg, he had not yet returned; and I met him only in 1862, on my way through Frankfort to Madrid, when we at once renewed our former friendship.\n\nA year or two before Hoffmann and myself idled away our time in rhyming, I had made an effort at writing a drama. This was really audacious in a boy of fifteen or sixteen. It was commencing at the wrong end. Walter Scott was then all the rage and amongst all his novels it was the \"Bride of Lammermoor\" that struck me as lending itself best to dramatization. I planned the whole piece and sketched it on paper. It was to have three acts. The first act I nearly finished; but becoming aware of my poetical inability, and also having little time, I gave it up. It was written in the trochaic measure, which was then all the fashion, introduced by the translations of Calderon, and adopted by Muellner in his \"Schuld\" and Grillparzer in his \"Ahnfrau,\"\n\n35\n\nthen a much admired tragedy which I had seen at the Frankfort Theatre. I gave the manuscript of my first act to my father, who kept it, but gave no opinion of it. One thing, however, is certain. I had intuitively found out the dramatic power of the novel. Some of Walter Scott's novels have been dramatized, such as Kenilworth, Guy Mannering, and Ivanhoe (Templar and Jewess), but they have been more or less failures; while Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" has gone around the world, and is still one of the most popular operas.\n\nVon Leonhardi.\n\nI must mention, however, another of my college classmates, Von Leonhardi, who made himself a name in Germany as the enthusiastic follower and expounder of the philosopher Krauss. This somewhat abstruse thinker, for some reason or other, found more adherents in Italy, and particularly in Spain, than in Germany itself. Emilio Castelar, who was well versed in German philosophical literature, (he delivered free lectures at the Madrid Athenaeum, the first winter I was there, on Schiller and Goethe,) was a great admirer of Krauss, and by his influence as professor of history at the University of Madrid, had indoctrinated not only the students, but also many literary men in Spain, with Krauss's ideas. Krauss was also a great authority in Italy. Perhaps his being a freemason and his having published several scientific works on freemasonry, may account for this popularity in countries where freemasonry was cultivated as a bulwark against Ultramontanism and despotism generally.\n\nLeonhardi sat with me on the same bench in Secunda (second highest class), and became the principal in a scene which I can never forget. The director of the college, of whom I have already spoken as a zealous orthodox pietist, gave two lectures a week on religion. His lectures were mainly excerpts from the old fathers of the Church, Origines, Tertullian, and others, and were devoid of taste and reason. At one\n\n36\n\ntime he came to treat of the temptation of Christ on the mountain, and commented on the various views of religious writers as to what the actual appearance of the devil might have been. He himself came to no conclusion as to what dress his Satanic majesty had assumed on this interesting occasion, but wound up by saying that one thing was certain, he must have appeared as a respectable person. Leonhardi, with his arms upon the desk and closed eyes, had for some time laid his head down to sleep. The director, observing this, asked him: \"Von Leonhardi! are you sick ?\" \"No,\" answered Leonhardi, \"I am trying to sleep.\" \"And why are you trying to sleep?\" asked the director. \"Because I can no longer listen to such stupid stuff (dummes Zeug).\" The whole class broke out in loud and approving laughter. The director turned pale, and could not utter a syllable for a while. When the director finally said, \"Von Leonhardi, you had better withdraw,\" Leonhardi picked up his books and quietly left the room. The matter was made up in some way, but at the end of the term of that class he left college. He was a tall, very fine-looking young man, but rather reticent and not sharing much in our sometimes pretty wild amusements. He was respected but was not popular amongst us.\n\n37\n\nChapter III. School Life Continued. Early Travels.\n\nA few years after the War of Liberation, the great political Reaction set in. The new constitution of Germany, the German Bund, was a very loose affair. Leaving the sovereigns who constituted it almost entirely independent as long as they followed the dictates of Austria and Prussia, the Diet (Bundestag), the moment they showed signs of granting greater liberties to their people, repressed them. The articles of the Act of Confederation which provided for freedom of the press and guaranteed to the several states representative governments, were either not executed at all, or evaded by miserable caricatures of such governments. Very soon Liberal writers were persecuted, the censorship of the press (Censur) instituted, and the most despotic principles openly avowed. A confederacy, such as the German Bund, was fatally bad for the reason alone (amongst many others), that the two states of Austria and Prussia, counting amongst the great powers of Europe and possessing large territories outside of Germany proper, were members of it and rivals to boot. They had their own national policies, could have, and did have, wars outside of the Bund, and used the rest of Germany merely as an instrument to further their own interests.\n\nThe Kings of Prussia, Frederick William the Third and the Fourth, were very weak and vacillating, and were soon reduced to play a secondary part to the artful Mettermeh, who was opposed to all popular liberty, for fear that his own motley monarchy might be contaminated by the liberal ideas of the other German States.\n\n38\n\nThe Political Situation and the Greek War of Independence.\n\nThe King of Prussia, who when he called the people to arms to rescue him from French domination had sacredly promised them a representative government, broke his word; and when, as could not fail, deep dissatisfaction at his conduct was shown by many of his people and by the very patriots who had fought in his armies as volunteers and had by speaking and writing roused the people to action, the Prussian government was nearly as severe in persecuting the men of the opposition as was Metternich, who filled with political prisoners the dungeons of Austria and Hungary. Such men as Stein, Arndt, Gneisenau, and Schoen, were closely watched. Arndt was removed from his professorship at the University at Bonn, and imprisoned.\n\nIn Frankfort, where the seat of the German Diet (Bundestag) was, and under the inspiration of that Diet, the reaction made its appearance somewhat later. Under the new Frankfort Constitution (1816), a legislative assembly had to be elected by the citizens every year. My father was elected a member several times, — I think for the years 1818 and 1819. He was, of course, of the Liberal party, and I was old enough then to listen to and understand his views about the political situation of the country. Most of the friends who visited us belonged to the same political party, and none but liberal newspapers were kept at our house. My older brothers were warm opponents of the reactionary policy, then almost everywhere prevailing in Germany, as father was. The Italian revolutions in Piedmont and Naples were greeted by all liberals in Frankfort with joy, and great was their disappointment at the speedy suppression of the uprisings by the Austrian army, acting under the orders of the Holy Alliance.\n\nThe Greek war of independence (1821), which excited the interest and admiration of the best people of the entire civilized world, was also greeted with great enthusiasm in our family. Father became a member of the Philhellenic\n\n39\n\nCommittee of Frankfort, the object of which was to collect contributions and money for equipping and furnishing transportation to the many young men who had determined to volunteer in the Grecian service. The principal committee for France, Switzerland and Germany had its headquarters in Geneva, where the auxiliary forces were organized; for the governments of France and Germany, under Metternich's influence, had forbidden all recruiting. To facilitate the collections a most stirring appeal had been printed in hundreds of thousands of copies, which were everywhere distributed. From the directory of Frankfort names were selected, several thousands of printed addresses were put in envelopes and personally delivered to each individual. The porter of our store distributed some, but the greatest number was delivered by me in my free hours. It was a hard task, for I had to climb very often three or four pairs of stairs to find the person to whom the paper was addressed. But I did it most cheerfully.\n\nThe Greek cause soon came nearer home to us. My brother Fritz at that time was employed as a lithographer in one of Cotta's printing and publishing establishments, at Stuttgart, which was one of the most active centers of Philhellenic sentiment. Norman, the general who in the last hours of the battle of Leipsic had gone over with some regiments of Wuertemberg cavalry to the allies, had already placed himself at the head of a large number of volunteers, who, by the time he reached Marseilles, had grown to a battalion or two. He organized them in Greece, and they were almost the first troops there that could be called regulars. In one of the first considerable battles fought against the Turks, near the Bay of Corinth, at Arta, these battalions of Norman nearly all perished. The bulk of the army consisted of some five or six thousand Greeks who ran away en masse when the first artillery fire of the Turks took effect in their ranks, leaving the Philhellenes, nearly all Germans, to fight it out. And they did so, being nearly all killed in the field, and the wounded\n\n40\n\nall dispatched, for in that war neither party gave quarter. A few only lived to tell the sad tale.\n\nBefore this was known new companies of volunteers were formed at Stuttgart and other places, and all at once Fritz wrote us that he had joined them, and was determined to fight in the sacred cause. My parents knew that they could not change his resolution, and with regret and sorrowful forebodings furnished him with the necessary means to accomplish his purpose. He wrote us very interesting letters from Switzerland, where a battalion was being organized; from Lyons, describing his delightful trip down the Rhone; and from Marseilles, where he embarked. Unfortunately all these letters and those he wrote from Greece and Turkey, together with my whole correspondence from the United States with my mother, brother and sisters, while they were alive, covering in all nearly twenty-two years, and a great many other family papers, were lost. After the death of brother Charles (in 1858), his only child Henrietta, being a minor, was taken into the house of one of her maternal uncles at Frankfort, who was also her guardian. He could never tell what became of the papers, and of a great many other things which were mementoes in our family, though he recollected having seen large packages and bundles of letters in the possession of the father of Henrietta. My letters would have greatly helped me in writing my reminiscences of the first seven years of my life in the United States, as being the impressions of the moment they undoubtedly gave a graphic and vivid representation of the conditions of that time.\n\nFritz landed with his battalion at Napoli di Romania. He found everything in confusion. Two of the principal leaders, Kolocotronis and Maurocordatos had fallen out, each pretending to be at the head of the government. As the Philhellenes did not know whom to obey and sought to be neutral between the two factions, they were neglected by both, received no rations and yet had to fight the Turks whenever occasion offered. Many of them soon became disgusted. The Greeks shunned\n\n41\n\nopen fights, except when greatly outnumbering the enemy; carried on the war in a most cruel guerrilla style; relied on night surprises; and killed their prisoners indiscriminately, including both women and children. Fritz was at the siege of Athens, at the storming of Napoli di Romania, which had been retaken by the Turks soon after his arrival; was taken down with malarial fever; and since hospitals either did not exist, or were mere pest-holes, he took leave of absence (or was discharged, I do not recollect which), and crossed to Smyrna, where he was kindly received by the members of a mercantile branch of a Frankfort banker, St. George, and there found employment. As the fever did not leave him, he decided to return, by way of Alexandria and Ancona, and reached home, some time I believe in 1824, after a two years' absence, emaciated to a skeleton and greatly disappointed. In his judgment the Turks were far superior in every way to the Greeks, an opinion that was shared also by Dr. Lieber, a celebrated German-American publicist, as appears from a book in which he gives a lively description of his own experiences as a Philhellene.\n\nFritz, after his return, took up lithography again, but did not feel himself at home in Frankfort, and was glad to obtain a position in a mercantile branch of a Frankfort house at Buenos Ayres, in South America. It must be noted here that after Fritz had gone through his mercantile apprenticeship, he, having an uncommon talent for drawing and printing, gave up his commercial career and devoted himself to drawing and lithography, which had just then come into great vogue. As a lithographer he had found employment with Cotta at Stuttgart, before going to Greece. He left in 1825. We received several letters from him expressing his satisfaction with his new position, but suddenly his correspondence ceased, and after a while we received the news of his death. A war had broken out between Uraguay and Buenos Ayres on one side and Brazil on the other. In some capacity or other he was on board the\n\n42\n\nfrigate Isabella belonging to Buenos Ayres when she was attacked by a Brazilian man-of-war and taken in the River La Plata, after a severe fight. The frigate was afterwards retaken, but Fritz was missing. In spite of various efforts through the consuls, the particulars of his demise could never be obtained. According to my present recollection, the naval fight took place some time in the year 1826. His life was a failure. Of the most uncommon talents and of an amiable disposition, he lacked steadiness and perseverance. He was too fond of company, too generous and openhanded, and had no idea of the value of time or money. In spite of the many sorrows and pains he caused his parents, they, and we all, loved him dearly.\n\nAthletic Sports.\n\nWhile at college, I and some of my schoolmates joined a Turners' Society. A garden was rented near the city, and except in the winter season we exercised twice a week on the gymnastic apparatus. Fencing was also largely cultivated, confined, however, to practising with the broadsword foil. My older brothers had a pair of such foils at the house, together with large felt hats and gauntlets. I did not become an expert at these broadsword exercises, but became proficient enough to make me very successful in about half a dozen encounters with that weapon at the Universities of Munich and Heidelberg. Indeed, I was never touched in these duels, though on similar occasions, with the small sword at Jena, where no other weapons were permitted, and in the use of which I thought myself almost a master, I was two or three times pretty severely handled by my opponents. The River Main afforded us a fine opportunity for rowing, sailing and swimming in summer, and a splendid ice field for skating in winter. Father was a great walker, and used to take me with him, even when I was quite small, when he visited Offenbach, Soden, Cronberg, or Homburg, the distance of the latter\n\n43\n\nplaces being from nine to ten miles from Frankfort. There was no lack of vigorous exercise in my bringing up.\n\nEarly Professional Plans.\n\nI had a strong inclination to study medicine, and there was an institute at Frankfort, called the Senckenberg Institute. It was attached to a hospital founded by Dr. Senckenberg for aged citizens. But he had added to it his garden, which he made a botanical one. He had also endowed a botanical professorship. Adjoining the botanical garden he had erected an anatomical museum, to which a professorship was also attached. For a very small entrance fee, students of the college who intended to become physicians could use all these establishments. Young practising physicians also enjoyed this privilege. I had reached the second highest class at college. I attended lectures on anatomy one winter, but became disgusted with the dissecting room, and went there only once or twice. But the botanical garden I frequented much and in the summer-time made botanical excursions in the neighborhood of the city twice a week. We had to be at the professor's room as early as five in the morning, and then tramped out through heavy dews, little branches and ponds, so that we generally returned much fatigued by eight or nine o'clock, and often with wet feet. Yet I think only with delight on these botanical promenades. I collected quite an herbarium. The gathering of the plants, their arrangement, the drying and pressing of them, was a favorite occupation with me. Of course, I often went botanizing of my own accord.\n\nI became slightly acquainted at that time with George Engelmann, who was at the college, but, he being a year or two older and in the first class, it was only through these botanical excursions with Professor Becker that I knew him. I had then no idea that we should become so closely related in after life. He had gone to the United States a year before I went, and there became one of the most distinguished physicians and a still more distinguished botanist. He was also an eminent\n\n44\n\ngeologist. When he died he was a member of many academies and learned societies in Europe and the United States. In the course of these reminiscences we shall meet him very often.\n\nMy desire to become a physician or a doctor, as was then the usual appellation of a medical man, was not encouraged by my family. My mother had several reasons for having strong objections. She said that my nurse, on account of my loud crying and general \"cussedness,\" had always said I must become a \"Procurateur\" — a name in olden times frequently given to advocates. The strongest objection, however, was, that she thought I was not handsome enough. She may have been right; but I may say, without laying myself open to the charge of too great vanity, that I had no trouble in finding during my life many warm and devoted friends among the fair sex.\n\nSocial Life.\n\nIn our house there was much society. My sisters had many girl friends. Once or twice every week, they would have some of them call in the evening before supper, which was always late, eight o'clock in winter, and nine or half past nine in summer. These were free and easy meetings, like the tertulias in Spain. Sometimes there was tea, coffee or fruit served. The girls would play on the piano, sing, dance, play at blind man's buff and other games. I was often amongst them, as were also some of my friends. My father had a very large number of friends in the city, and in neighboring and even distant towns, owing to the fact that he acted as a commission-merchant for small booksellers in those places, and also that he had, particularly in earlier times, published works of clergymen and teachers in colleges and schools. His close connection with the Bluecher Club had brought him in contact with many prominent men in Offenbach, Homburg, Hanau and Darmstadt.\n\nParticularly at the time of the two fairs in Frankfort we had a good many visitors from abroad, who sometimes\n\n45\n\nstayed for weeks, and amongst them were some quite interesting people. Among places in which we had warm friends must be mentioned, in particular, Kreuznach and Bad Ems. Business connections brought my father to the first place. He made many friends, amongst others a merchant by the name of Kauffmann, who was the author of a book of songs, some of which were really of great merit. He was an original, full of humor and wit, an inimitable story-teller and mimic. He was the best type of the ever gay and vivacious Rhinelander. He came regularly to the Frankfort fair and made his purchases, and we were all delighted when he arrived. Sometimes his sons and daughters came to see us, and my sister Pauline spent in return many weeks and months at his delightful Kreuznach home, where some two or three times I also spent part of my college vacation. We became acquainted with other families there, and I yet remember the delightful picnic parties we had at the Ebernburg and other picturesque places which surround Kreuznach.\n\nAs to Ems, though its waters were known as highly curative in certain diseases, it was not then the fashionable watering place it became in later years; and it was perhaps for this reason a more agreeable place to visit. Our connection with Ems was owing to the fact that sister Pauline, whose lungs had become somewhat affected, spent a season there and took lodgings at the Four Towers (Vier Thuermen), a kind of château in renaissance style, that had belonged to a noble family and was now owned by the widow of Dr. Thilenius, who had been the ducal bath-physician. The structure had been converted into a bath house, and was no Hotel. The guests were accommodated with furnished rooms, and the baths were taken in a large basin. Most of the people staying there were of the highest class; and had usually their own cooks and servants. The kitchen was of a large size, with many ranges, so that several families could have their meals prepared at once. But most of the guests went to neighboring restaurants. The widow Thilenius was a woman of\n\n46\n\ncommon intellect, and showed, when I first knew her, traces of rare beauty. She was a splendid business woman, for which excellence Boerne, who had quarreled with her about prices, gave her, in one of his letters, some sarcastic hits. She was a fine writer and given to making verses. She became exceedingly fond of Pauline, and promised to visit her in Frankfort. On parting she wrote in Pauline's album: \"Sprudle emsig; sprudle helle,\n\nFrische Emser Silberquelle.\n\nEine liebe kranke Rose\n\nWard gesund in deinem Schoose.\"\n\nShe afterwards came to Frankfort, and father, Pauline and myself visited Ems repeatedly.\n\nThe Thilenius Family.\n\nAs the Thilenius family became somewhat interwoven with our own, it may not be amiss to give their history, as far as I became acquainted with it. In the first place, the late Dr. Thilenius was not only known as one of the ablest physicians in the Dukedom of Nassau, but stood very high as a man. It was said that it was he who resurrected the baths at Ems. They were known to the Romans and highly prized by them; and even in the middle ages they had a great reputation. But for some reason or other, perhaps because there was no gambling permitted there, they were, towards the end of the last century overshadowed by such places as Spaa, Pyrmont, and Wilhelmsbad. Dr. Thilenius, by having the springs and baths put in fine condition, and by demonstrating in a number of publications the excellence of the waters, had attracted invalids in great numbers to the place, and so was honored by the Duke with orders, and loved by the people as a benefactor. For this reason the family had much pride.\n\nThe Four Towers were, at the time I visited there, much patronized. At one time I found nearly all the rooms, including the large salon, occupied by the Grand Duke of\n\n47\n\nRussia, Constantine, and his wife, with an immense suite of adjutants, chamberlains, etc., etc. At another, the Duke of Clarence, who afterwards became William IV of England, was a guest, and with him were two beautiful young girls (his daughters by some lady unknown), who went by the name of the Misses Fitz-Clarence.\n\nThe times I spent at Ems were most delightful. It was always vacation-time. I met there the three Thilenius sons, one of whom was a student of medicine at Giessen, Rudolf by name; the other, Otto, who was at the Weilburg Gymnasium; and Ernest, who was at a much-noted private boarding-school at Offenbach, so largely patronized by English boys that the language spoken there in conversation was English. What splendid parties we made, mostly on donkeys or ponies, along the beautiful valley of the Lahn and in the side valleys, as far even as Coblentz on the Rhine! Only one of the girls, Matilda, lived at Ems. The eldest, Charlotte, was already married to a Herr von Haus, and resided at Wuerzburg. The youngest was in a ladies seminary, also at Offenbach. All the children were very handsome, some of them of most exquisite beauty. I became very intimate with all of them. Charlotte von Haus was the most perfect beauty I ever saw. To attempt a description of this charming lady would be a vain task. In the words of Byron:\n\nWho has not proved how feebly words essay\n\nTo fix one spark of beauty's heavenly ray!\n\nWho does not feel, until his failing sight\n\nFaints into dimness with its own delight,\n\nHis changing cheek, his sinking heart confess\n\nThe might, the majesty of loveliness!\"\n\nI have somewhere seen a German translation of these lines which do justice, in my opinion,"
