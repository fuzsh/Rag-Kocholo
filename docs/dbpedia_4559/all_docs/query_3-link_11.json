If a better picture is obtained at a later date, it will replace or supplement the original one. The high-resolution bitmap images are compressed into jpeg format to make the files about one seventh as large, and therefore more suitable for webpage use.\n\nAs all large lunar features are named, the origin of the name will be given if it is important.\n\nThis page is an Archive of all the lunar features described from the beginning up until last month.\n\nTo help the lunar observer to find these features, each set of ten is preceded by an image of the Full Moon on which the locations of the ten photographs immediately following are shown according to their numbers in this series.\n\nFinding your way around the Moon: 1 - Seas and an Ocean\n\nFrom north to south:\n\n(All of these are dry lava plains, and nine are basins.

Ancient people thought that the Moon was a mirror reflecting the continents and oceans of the Earth, but they never agreed on whether the dark patches were the lands or the seas. In the 1590s, the Englishman William Gilbert made the first drawing of the Moon showing features we can vaguely recognise, but he named the dark patches as lands, and the lighter ones as seas. On his naked-eye drawing, a dark oval patch was named the \"island\" of Brittannia (sic). Sixty years later Giovanni Riccioli named it as a \"sea\", the Mare Crisium or Sea of Crises. By Riccioli's time primitive telescopes had revealed that the light areas were the lands or \"Terrae\", and the dark areas were seas or \"Maria\" - it took many more years before the \"seas\" were found to be dry plains of solidified lava, and there was no liquid water on the Moon.\n\nThe Earth is 4.57 billion years old. The Moon is slightly younger, 4.425 billion. The Moon appears to have formed around the time the Earth's core was becoming solid and stable. Between 4.1 and 3.8 billion years ago, a high number of asteroids or minor planets left over from the formation of the Solar System were attracted by gravity into collisions with all the larger objects in the Solar System. The evidence of these impacts remains visible on all the terrestrial type planets and moons, but not the gas and ice giants whose surfaces we cannot see. The atmospheres on the Earth, Venus, and to a lesser extent Mars burned up all but the largest of these impactors. This cataclysmic event is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment or LHB.\n\nThe maria on the Moon were formed by collisions with asteroids or minor planets during the LHB. These impacts created large basins in the lunar crust which promptly filled with molten magma, which spread out onto the surface as lava flows, the basaltic nature of the magma causing the dark grey colour. Probably the first of these impacts created Mare Anguis, Mare Australe, Mare Fecunditatis, Mare Frigoris, Mare Insularum, Mare Marginis, Mare Nubium, Mare Smythii, Mare Spumans, Mare Tranquillitatis, Mare Undarum and Mare Vaporum (earlier than 3.92 billion years ago). After that, the Mare Crisium, Mare Humboldtianum, Mare Humorum, Mare Nectaris and Mare Serenitatis (3.92 to 3.85 billion years ago) were formed, then Mare Imbrium (3.85 to 3.8 billion years ago), and finally Mare Cognitum, Mare Orientale and Oceanum Procellarum (3.85 to 3.2 billion years ago).\n\nLakes, Marshes, Bays and Promontories\n\nThere are numerous smaller areas on the Moon that exhibit dark lava flows from strikes by less massive impactors. These are named as Lakes (there are 17, one example is the Lacus Mortis - Lake of Death), or Marshes (there are 6, one is Palus Epidemiarum - Marsh of Epidemics).\n\nThere are 11 bays on the Moon, each being on the edge of a mare. They have names beginning with \"Sinus\", and the most spectacular is the Sinus Iridum (Bay of Rainbows). This feature has a promontory at each end of the \"bay\", the western one being \"Promontorium Heraclides\" and the eastern one \"Promontorium Laplace\". There are seven other Promontories on the Moon.\n\nMountains, Ranges, Valleys and Slopes\n\nThere are hundreds of mountain peaks on the Moon, many within craters, many as peaks in crater rims or mountain ranges, but only a few as isolated peaks protruding above flat lava plains. Two of the latter type are Mons Pico (2.4 kilometres high) and Mons Piton (2.25 kilometres high), which stand proudly isolated in the Mare Imbrium.\n\nThere are 18 mountain ranges, and 11 of them are around the margins of the maria, forming the circumferential boundaries of the basins created by the LHB impacts. For example, the impact that created the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains) threw up seven mountain ranges around its perimeter. These, starting from the north-west and moving clockwise, are the Montes Jura, Montes Recti, Montes Teneriffe, Montes Alpes, Montes Caucasus, Montes Apenninus, and Montes Carpatus. Some ranges are related to pyroclastic activity, such as the Montes Agricola, Montes Archimedes and possibly Montes Harbinger.\n\nThe Moon has some valleys, too, cutting through mountainous areas. There are eleven all told, but the most famous are the Vallis Rheita in the southern hemisphere, and the Vallis Alpes (Alpine Valley) and Vallis Schröterii (Schröter's Valley) in the northern. The latter two valleys are remarkable in that they both have a very fine sinuous rille running for almost their entire length, which is very challenging to detect.\n\nThere are some single fault scarps on the Moon, which cross flat plains like a gently sloping cliff 100 kilometres long or more. The two most notable are the Rupes Recta or Straight Wall (110 kilometres long), which crosses the Mare Nubium and is 300 metres high. Another is the Rupes Liebig (180 kilometres long), which is on the western margin of the Mare Humorum. The appearance of both of these slopes varies dramatically, depending on whether the Sun is rising or setting (see item # 13 below). The longest scarp is the Rupes Altai, which has a length of 480 kilometres, but is broken in places.\n\nRilles\n\nThe word 'rille' is German for 'groove'. These come in two types and are called Rima or Rimae (plural). One type is a V-shaped valley which can be straight or sinuous. Some are extremely long and begin at a small crater. They could possibly be collapsed lava tubes. There are many fine examples such as the Rima Marius, Rima Hadley, Rima Hyginus, Rimae Triesnecker and Rimae Prinz. The second type has two fault scarps two or three kilometres apart, running parallel often for hundreds of kilometres. Between them, the land has dropped down for a kilometre or so, leaving a flat floor between the scarps. On the Earth, similar features are known as grabens or rift valleys. Fine examples include the Rima Cauchy, Rima Hesiodus, Rimae Goclenius and Rimae Hypatia.\n\nVolcanos and Domes\n\nIt is often seen in such craters that the fissures in the newly fractured floor release the pressure on the superheated bedrock, which then becomes liquid and expands. It forces its way to the surface as molten magma, oozing out of the fissures and spreading out over the new bowl-shaped floor which becomes dark lava when it cools. Sometimes, only a small amount of lava emerges, as in the crater Copernicus; at other times it covers the entire crater floor, often completely swamping any mountains on the floor, as in the crater Plato, which Hevelius called \"Lacus Niger\" (Black Lake). If such flat-floored craters are larger than 80 kilometres in diameter, they are called \"walled plains\". Generally, the rising magma fills the new crater up to a level equal to the surrounding lunar surface or slightly lower or higher. One crater in which the upwelling lava filled it right up to the top of its raised rim and then overflowed down the outside slopes to create a level plain beyond, is Wargentin. It gives the appearance of a plateau or tableland. Large walled plains include Ptolemaeus, Alphonsus, Hipparchus, Endymion, Plato, Petavius, Posidonius, Grimaldi, Clavius and Humboldt.\n\nSometimes a flying mountain ejected from an impact will bounce across the surface, leaving a trail of secondary craters. These are called \"Catena\" (Latin for \"chain\"), and two of the best known are the Catena Davy and the Catena Abulfeda.\n\nBasins\n\nThe largest crater on the near side of the Moon is Bailly (see #64 below). Although it was a major impact early in the Moon's history and is 303 kilometres in diameter, its floor was not fractured and no mountains were thrust up. There are, though, a few low ridges. No lava emerged to level out its floor, and over the eons Bailly has been severely battered by thousands of impacts of various sizes, so that it has become described in Wikipedia as a \"field of ruins\". Bailly is regarded not so much as a very large crater, but as a small \"basin\". Most basins are much larger, and all are formed by huge impacts. There are 29 all told, and some of the largest are named as \"Mare\" (singular, \"Maria\" is the plural form). Nine of the Maria listed in the table above are basins.\n\nNOTE:\n\nIn the above section, reference is made to many named lunar features.

The aperture is 508 mm and the focal length is 4080 mm. The focal ratio is therefore f/8. Most images but not all were taken using a 2x Tele Vue Powermate to increase the image scale. The camera used is a ZWO ASI 290MM with a red filter. It is a video camera and captures a video stream from which the clearest frames are extracted and then stacked to produce the final image. The software used includes SharpCap 2.9, FireCapture V2.5, AutoStackkert! 3.0.14, RegiStax V6.1 and Adobe Photoshop V8.0.\n\nWe can work out the scale of the images in the Archive below by using the first picture (#1 Clavius ) as an example. The equatorial diameter of the Moon = 3476 kilometres. On the night the photograph of Clavius was taken, 2 August 2017, the Moon was at apogee (its monthly maximum distance from Earth, in this case 405 053 kilometres). Its angular diameter on the sky at that time was 29.5 arcminutes.\n\nClavius has a diameter of 225 kilometres, so its angular diameter on that occasion can be determined in proportion from that of the Moon: 3476 km : 225 km :: 29.5 arcminutes : x arcminutes ( 3476 is to 225 as 29.5 is to x , or 225 multiplied by 29.5 divided by 3476 equals x arcminutes ).\n\nSimple arithmetic gives the angular diameter of Clavius ('x arcminutes') on that night to be 1.91 arcminutes or 114.57 arcseconds. If the image is printed to fill an A4 sheet in landscape format, and examined from a normal viewing distance of 28 centimetres or 11 inches, the image of Clavius will subtend an angle of 64 degrees or 230 400 arcseconds at the eye. To find the magnification of the image at that distance, we can calculate by which number 114.57 arcseconds must be multiplied to arrive at an answer of 230 400 arcseconds.\n\n230 400 divided by 114.57 equals 2011. Therefore, to examine an A4 reproduction of #1 Clavius at a normal reading distance is equivalent to viewing it through a telescope with a magnification of 2011 times ( magnification = 2011x ). Such a view is what one would see through a spacecraft window if orbiting the Moon at an altitude of 200 kilometres. Those pictures requiring a larger field, such as maria or lengthy mountain ranges ( examples are the first two images of #12 Mare Imbrium and also that of\n\n#15 Montes Apenninus ), have been taken with the 2x Powermate removed. This results in a field of view four times larger in area, but with a magnification of only 1005x, similar to orbiting the Moon at an altitude of 400 kilometres.\n\nThe techniques outlined above enable very fine details on the Moon and planets to be detected in the final images. That of #1 Clavius in the following Archive contains hundreds of sub-kilometre craterlets. Ten of them are indicated by yellow lines in the enlargement immediately below. Some are tinier than 750 metres diameter, which is approaching the minimum size detectable from Earth with an aperture of 500 mm.\n\nClavius (central section).\n\nArchive\n\nKey to features 1 to 10 below.\n\n1: September 2016\n\nThis month's feature is the huge walled plain Clavius.\n\nClavius was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour on August 2, 2017. South is to the top, east is to the left.\n\nClavius is one of the largest craters, with a diameter of 225 kilometres. It is completely circular, but due to its position at lunar latitude 43 degrees south, we see it considerably foreshortened. It is quite ancient, and since it was formed by the impact of a large meteor or small asteroid about 3.9 billion years ago, other more recent impacts have deformed parts of it. The walls are quite high and rugged, especially on the eastern side. Two large craters have deformed the southern and northern walls. Both are about 55 kilometres in diameter and are named after the American astronomer Lewis Rutherfurd (top) and the American optician Russell Porter. When Clavius was formed, lava welled up and flooded the bowl-shaped floor, hardening into a smooth, flat surface with some ripples.\n\nThe floor has now been impacted itself, and shows many craters of various sizes. Unusually, there is an elegant curved line of five craters on Clavius' floor of ever-diminishing size from east to west. Their sizes range from 28 kilometres to 6 kilometres. Many dozens of craterlets dot the floor, particularly on the south-western side. The eastern side has a smooth area between Rutherfurd and Porter, that is crossed by lines of damage caused by ejecta thrown north by the Rutherfurd impact. Numerous craterlets less than two kilometres in diameter can be seen in this area. Some mountains protrude above the lava floor of Clavius, especially near its centre. Their elevation is shown by the fact that, as the sunlight is coming from the east, their shadows are seen on their right-hand side, while craters and other depressions have their bright walls on the right.\n\nClavius\n\nThis spectacular crater is named after Christoff Clau, known to science as Clavius (right), who was born in Germany in 1537 and died in Rome in 1612. At that time, Europe was using the Julian Calendar, devised by Sosigines in Alexandria in 46 BCE on the orders of Julius Caesar. That calendar worked on the length of a year as being exactly 365¼ days. Unfortunately, the actual year is about 11¼ minutes shorter than that, and this error means that the calendar creeps ahead of the seasons by one day in 128 years. As Easter is a movable feast, not fixed to the calendar but determined by the seasons (Easter Sunday is the first Sunday after the first Full Moon after the northern hemisphere's spring equinox - our autumn equinox), but Christmas is fixed to the calendar (December 25), this meant that Christmas was catching up to Easter and by 1582 it had caught up by nearly two weeks. If nothing were done, then eventually Christmas and Easter would occur simultaneously, which alarmed the Church at the time.\n\nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII appointed Clavius, a Jesuit priest, to bring the civil and seasonal calendars back into synchronisation by realigning the vernal equinox with a part of the civil calendar that had been traditionally associated with the beginning of spring, around March 20.\n\nClavius was a highly esteemed mathematician and astronomer who had written a well-regarded text book, Commentary on De Sphæra of Sacrobosco. Clavius, like some other 16th century astronomers, had devoted much effort to recovering the mathematical texts of Greek antiquity, and had translated Euclids Elements, which brought him fame as the Euclid of his time. He adhered steadfastly to the geocentric universe as described in Ptolemy's Almagest, teaching his students that the Earth was the centre of the universe and that the Sun, Moon, planets and stars revolved around the Earth once each day. He did this for forty years until the third edition of the Commentary on De Sphæra in 1581, when he began to have some doubts, writing: regarding Copernicus, it is not absolutely certain that the eccentrics and epicycles are arranged as Ptolemy thought.\n\nClavius admired Copernicus as a mathematician, and used data from De Revolutionibus, Sacroboscos De Sphæra, and Reinholds Prutenic Tables as bases from which to work on the calendar. Although the total error as described above was 12.7 days, Clavius calculated that Sosigenes had ignored a pre-existing three-day error the other way, so by 1582 the error he had to deal with was only about ten days. The simplest solution was to simply drop those ten days in one hit, rather than by one day at a time. To prevent such errors accumulating again in the future, Clavius modified the rule for determining leap years. In the Julian calendar, every year that was divisible by four was a leap year. But that practice clearly inserted too many leap days. How many? Over 128 years, it added an extra day, so over a 400 year period, it would add three extra days. So every 400 years, three days needed to be removed to keep the civil calendar in alignment with the seasons.\n\nWhat three days could be given up? Clavius decided that even century years would no longer be designated as leap years, unless they were divisible by 400. This meant that the years 1600 and 2000 would still be leap years, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 would not. Pope Gregory thought that these suggestions by Clavius were splendid, and instructed all countries to adopt them. It was announced that the evening of October 4 would be followed by the morning of October 15.\n\nThe ten days from October 5 to 14, 1582 simply would not exist. All Catholic countries complied, and adopted this Gregorian Calendar immediately, but European Protestant nations refused to change. They eventually complied in 1700. Britain changed in 1752  by then the number of days to be dropped had risen to 11. The day after September 2 was September 14. The British people rioted, chanting Give us back our eleven days!\" Sweden changed their calendar in 1753, Russia complied in 1918 and Turkey in 1928.\n\nWhen Galileo published his first spyglass observations in Siderius Nuncius (The Starry Messenger) in 1610, in which he described the phases of Venus, the craters of the Moon, and the satellites of Jupiter, Clavius was by then the top astronomer at the Collegio Romano, the Pope's university in Rome. He read Galileo's book with great interest, and began to correspond with its author about spyglasses. He invited Galileo to come down from Florence to Rome, which Galileo did in March 1611 and was treated with great ceremony by the priests at the Collegio. Clavius talked with Galileo for many hours about the new discoveries. Clavius had recently completed his sixth updated version of De Sphæra, which was already at the publisher as the third volume of his five-volume collected works, the Opera Mathematica.\n\nAfter Galileos visit, he managed to have a new section inserted into the De Sphæra volume, enumerating Galileos discoveries. He also included a statement that, while slightly ambiguous, indicates to us that Clavius may have been thinking that his lifes work teaching geocentric astronomy had been barking up the wrong tree. He wrote, Some things are thus, astronomers ought to consider how the celestial orbs should be arranged in order to save these [new] phenomena. Whether he was recommending switching to the little-known Tychonic system or the Copernican is unclear, as both systems could explain the phases of Venus and could accommodate the moons of Jupiter and odd appearance of Saturn. Although he had opposed both theories for religious reasons, most historians agree that he was having second thoughts and was admitting that the Ptolemæic system in the form he had taught for a lifetime was no longer tenable. Perhaps he was beginning to accept the Sun-centred system. We would have known for sure had not serious illness laid him low in mid-1611, leading to his death eight months later.\n\nOn April 14, 1611, a few days after Galileo had been fêted by the Collegio Romano, Romes Lincean Academy held a banquet in his honour in Rome. Galileo thrilled the five members and their many guests by letting them see sunspots and, after dinner, the satellites of Jupiter and the star clusters of the Milky Way through one of his spyglasses. They lingered long into the night, enjoying the novel views. To prove that what the spyglass revealed was genuine, he aimed his instrument at a church over a mile away. The guests were amazed to read clearly the inscription on the buildings façade. Galileo then presented his spyglass to the Academy. They entreated him to become the sixth member of their august group, which he did, regarding it as a great honour. Thereafter, he proudly signed his name, Galileo Galilei, Linceo.\n\nThe host, Prince Federico Cesi, announced that the Academy would be honoured to be Galileos publisher from then on. He also said that one of the other men at the dinner, Giovanni Demisiani (a chemist, theologian and mathematician to Cardinal Ferdinand Gonzaga), had devised a better name for Galileos spyglass (which he called a perspicillum), one that more aptly conveyed the instruments amazing capabilities, and differentiated it from its crude, low-power cousins. The name, Cesi explained, was a melding of two words in Demisianis native Greek: tele, meaning far away, and skopéin, meaning to see. Henceforth, Galileos instrument would be known as a telescope. It would reveal astrology to be totally fraudulent, and would elevate astronomy to the purest science.\n\n2: October 2016\n\nThis month's feature is the large crater Gassendi.\n\nGassendi was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour at 9:56 pm on September 2, 2017. North is at the top, west is to the left.\n\nThis image of Gassendi was taken at 8:50 pm on December 16, 2021, when the Sun was higher in the Moon's sky, reducing the shadows.\n\nGassendi is a moderately large crater, with a diameter of 114 kilometres. It is completely circular, but due to its position towards the Moon's west-south-western limb, we see it considerably foreshortened. It is quite ancient, and since it was formed by the impact of a large meteor or small asteroid about 3.9 billion years ago, a large more recent impact has deformed its northern wall (towards the top in the image above). This later crater is called Gassendi A, and is 33 kilometres across. Almost adjoining it on its north-western side is Gassendi B, which is 26 kilometres across. The floor of Gassendi is flat, with a group of mountains in the centre that average 1200 metres high. To the south is a large, flat lava plain called Mare Humorum (the Sea of Humours).\n\nThe Mare Humorum was caused by an asteroid striking the Moon in the epoch after Gassendi was formed. This huge impact blasted out a crater 391 kilometres across, fracturing the Moon's crust in the area. These fractures released pressure on the hot rocky layers below, which immediately liquified, allowing hot magma to come to the surface as lava, which filled up the crater that had been formed, resulting in the large, level lava plain that was discovered and named the \"Sea\" of Humours by Giovanni Riccioli in the mid-17th century.\n\nAs the lava spread out from the impact crater, much of it reached the southern wall of Gassendi, sweeping over it and bursting in to pool on the southern end of Gassendi's floor. We can see a gap in Gassendi's southern ramparts where the wall has been completely breached, and other parts of the southern wall have been smoothed over by the lava. As the lava cooled, ripples in it became solid, and can be seen close to the south and south-east walls of Gassendi. The eastern, northern and western walls, unaffected by the lava flow, are rugged.\n\nThe floor of Gassendi is crossed by numerous clefts and looks quite fractured. One small crater on the floor that can be easily detected in the image above, is between the westernmost mountain in the central cluster and the western wall. Called Gassendi P, it is 2 kilometres in diameter. Many much smaller craterlets are visible, one being 10 kilometres north of Gassendi P. It is only 900 metres across. A narrow valley or 'rille' starts near a cluster of hills near the upper right of the image, and winds its way towards the north (to the top margin). Rilles are common on the Moon, and this one runs past the crater Herigonius (not in picture) and is called Rima Herigonius. It is 104 kilometres long. As it progresses it widens from about a kilometre to two kilometres across. Though it looks like a river valley, this cannot be so as there is no liquid water on the Moon. Rilles are probably volcanic in origin.\n\nGassendi\n\nThis spectacular crater is named after Pierre Gassendi (right), a French philosopher, priest, mathematician and astronomer who was born in Champtercier in 1592 and died in Paris in 1655. He corresponded with Kepler and Galileo, and wrote definitive biographies of Tycho Brahe, Nicolas Copernicus, Georg von Peurbach and Regiomontanus, which received much praise. Gassendi was an early user of the newly invented telescopes.\n\nAt the time, there were three views of the Universe for people to choose from. Firstly, there was the geocentric view that the Earth was the centre of the universe, and everything else, star and planets, Sun and Moon, revolved around the Earth each day. This was the view from the ancient Greeks that had been promoted by Ptolemy in his Almagest of 150 AD, and embraced by the Christian churches. Secondly, there was the Tychonic universe of Tycho Brahe, which had the Sun and Moon revolving around the fixed Earth at the centre of the universe, but the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn revolved around the Sun, not the Earth. The sphere of fixed stars enclosed all. The third view, promoted by Nicolaus Copernicus, was heliocentric, in that the Sun was at the centre of the universe, with the Earth and planets in orbit around it. The Moon was in orbit around the Earth and the sphere of fixed stars enclosed all as with the geocentric view of Ptolemy.\n\nThe Catholic Church had rejected the Copernican system and at the time was promoting the Tychonic system, for it seemed to explain the movements of the planets without requiring that the Earth move as well, for the Bible expressly said. \"He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.\" (Psalms 104:5). Although Gassendi followed his church's acceptance of the Tychonic world view, nevertheless he believed Keplers Copernican prediction that the planet Mercury would cross the face of the Sun on November 7, 1631. Setting up his telescope that morning, he made the first observation of a solar transit by a planet. He only saw the second half  the transit had started two hours before sunrise in Paris. Initially, when he saw a tiny black dot on the Sun's disc, Gassendi thought it was much too small to be a planet - he thought it was only a sunspot. Soon, however, its movement revealed it to be indeed Mercury.\n\nGassendi also wrote a dissertation on parhelia or sundogs, and was the first to propose a theory that light is composed of particles. This theory, which was published posthumously in the 1660s, was read by Newton in his student years, and was the basis for his later belief that light was composed of particles of matter, and not waves passing through the æther as suggested by Huygens and Descartes.\n\nThe argument over whether light was caused by particles or was a wave went on for over two centuries. We now know that light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, so everyone was partly right. For modern technical applications of any forms of electromagnetic radiation, both the wave and particle properties are indispensable. To make all of our telecommunications, radio, television, microwave ovens, mobile telephones, speed cameras and radar systems work, we need to invoke the radiations wave character. Digital cameras, gas discharge lamps (e.g. energy-saving light bulbs and street lighting), and (importantly) spectroscopy would not work at all were it not for the radiations particle nature. In March 2015, scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology announced that they had photographed light acting as a wave and a particle simultaneously, a historic and significant breakthrough if confirmed. It is now thought that electrons also exhibit such duality.\n\n3: November 2016\n\nThis month's features are the two large adjoining craters in the image below. They are named Theophilus and Cyrillus.\n\nTheophilus (top) and Cyrillus were photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour at 6:42 pm on July 30, 2017.\n\nEast (where the Sun is rising) is to the right, north is at the top.\n\nThese craters form a well-known threesome with Catharina (not shown), and Theophilus is obviously the newest, for it is more clearly defined and overlaps Cyrillus. All three craters were named by Giovanni Riccioli in the mid-17th century. He was a Jesuit priest who knew his history of astronomy and astronomers very well, and used this knowledge when applying names to the lunar features. The names were not chosen at random, and the three above were named after people connected with the lost Great Library of Alexandria which is described below.\n\nTheophilus has a diameter of 104 kilometres and was formed between 1.1 and 3.2 billion years ago, much later than Cyrillus. It is bounded on the north by the Sinus Asperitatis (Bay of Asperity or harshness) and to the east by the Mare Nectaris (Sea of Nectar). Its walls rise about 1200 metres above those lava plains. The floor is flat, indicating that lava welled up from below shortly after the impact occurred, and pooled on the bowl-shaped floor, filling it to a moderate extent. There is a cluster of four mountain peaks rising out of the flat floor to a height of about 1400 metres. On the north-west wall is a craterlet 8 kilometres across.\n\nCyrillus has a diameter of 100 kilometres, and its walls are highest in the south-east. It was formed between 3.85 and 3.92 billion years ago. The floor is rugged and fractured, with a large mountain and two smaller ones a little east of centre. A large meteor has struck the western interior slopes and created a 17 kilometre wide crater called Cyrillus A. The southern ramparts of Cyrillus are broken through by a wide, shallow valley which leads to Catharina about 80 kilometres to the south.\n\nBackground - the Great Library of Alexandria\n\nThe city of Alexandria was founded on the orders of Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE), a pupil of Aristotle, after his liberation of Egypt from the Persians in 332 BCE and the absorption of Egypt into the Greek Empire. The Egyptians welcomed him as a deliverer, and he was made Pharaoh. Standing on the shore of the Nile delta looking at the blue Mediterranean harbour under a brilliant Sun, Alexander saw at once that this could be the site of a great city. Named to honour him after his death aged only 32, it soon became the principal city of the world, a vast and sophisticated metropolis of marble, in comparison with which Rome and Athens were just provincial cities. Perhaps one fourth of Alexandria consisted of royal palaces and public buildings, but even private residences were made of stone.\n\nThough Alexandria became the literary, scientific, and commercial centre of the Greek world, what the ancient city is best remembered for today are its Temple to the Muses (Museum) and the Great Library of Alexandria, which were begun by Alexanders General Ptolemy as a tribute to Alexander after he died. Ptolemy became Pharaoh Ptolemy I Soter (Saviour), the second Macedonian King of Egypt after Alexander, and is also famous for building the Pharos of Alexandria on a small island adjoining the citys harbour. This 140 metre lighthouse was one of the tallest man-made structures on Earth for many centuries, and is regarded as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Some remnants of it can still be seen.\n\nAlthough the Museum was wonderful, it was the Great Library that became the jewel in the Greek crown, and a wonder of the ancient world. The gathering together of close to 1 million books and scrolls into a single collection in a world where books were rare and hand-copied was not an easy project, but it brought thousands of people into collaboration over many generations. Messengers were sent throughout the Mediterranean to collect everything of value. Writers, readers, translators, illustrators, artists, manuscript copiers, book traders, librarians, scientists, administrators and emperors all contributed to the greatest monument to human knowledge that ever existed until recently. In its halls, theatres and lecture rooms, it became possible for the first time for people to engage in systematic study.\n\nTheophilus and Cyrillus The earliest Christian thinkers had no problem at all in accepting the science of the ancient but pagan Greeks, Origen of Alexandria (AD 185-254) believing that the Bible was allegorical, and not in competition with natural laws; but by AD 300, writers such as Lactantius were ridiculing all pre-Christian knowledge, declaring that concepts such as the spherical shape of the Earth as taught by the Greeks were absurd and against the Holy Scriptures. This rejection and fear of science, along with most of the Greek heritage, became so pathological that in AD 391, Christian mobs acting for the Coptic Archbishop Theophilus wrecked the Great Library of Alexandria, burned as many books and scrolls as they could find, and killed the people working there.\n\nThe last scientist to remain after the destruction was a woman, Hypatia. She became head of what was left of the Great Library, and specialised in mathematics and astronomy. These particular areas of knowledge had come to be regarded by the Christian church as magic, heathen and therefore sinful. In great personal danger, Hypatia continued to teach and publish, and doggedly tried to pursue her studies. One day in the year AD 415, on her way home from work, she was set upon by followers of Cyrillus, the next Archbishop after Theophilus and later Coptic Pope of Alexandria. She was dragged from her chariot into a church, stripped, murdered and dismembered. The Christians flayed the flesh from her bones with abalone shells, oyster shells and shards of broken roof tiles. Her remains were burned and her works obliterated. A tall obelisk close to the site of her killing was later taken to London and named Cleopatras Needle where it may still be found. Cyrillus (or Cyril), a nephew of Theophilus, was made an early Christian saint. [ A 2009 movie, Agora, focuses on Hypatias final years, when she was studying heliocentrism and performing experiments of a kind that were later conducted by Galileo. A nearby crater to the two shown above is called Hypatia. The 117th Coptic Christian Pope still rules in Egypt today, Pope Tawadros (Theodoros) II of Alexandria. ]\n\nWe don't know what Hypatia looked like. Her image shown here is from a painting, The School of Athens, painted by Raphael between 1509 and 1511. This painting includes the images of 54 great thinkers, but for the representation of Hypatia, Raphael has used the face of Margherita, his mistress. The crater Catharina will be described next month.\n\n4: December 2016\n\nLast month's features were the top two large adjoining craters in the image below, Theophilus and Cyrillus. This month's feature is the third, lowest crater in this well-known threesome, Catharina.\n\nTheophilus (top), Cyrillus and Catharina (bottom) were photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour at 6:42 pm on July 30, 2017. East (where the Sun is rising) is to the right, north is at the top.\n\nOf these three craters, Theophilus (top) is obviously the newest, for it is more clearly defined and overlaps Cyrillus. Catharina is the oldest of the three, appearing much more degraded and damaged by continual impacts by small meteorites over billions of years, All three craters were named by Giovanni Riccioli in the mid-17th century. He was a Jesuit priest who knew his history of astronomy and astronomers very well, and used this knowledge when applying names to the lunar features. The names were not chosen at random, and the three above were named after people connected with the lost Great Library of Alexandria which was described last month.\n\nCatharina has a diameter of 100 kilometres and a depth of 3130 metres. It has been damaged by a later impact on its northern wall, which has produced a 46 kilometre wide crater, Catharina P. The walls of Catharina are quite steep in places, but the rugged floor is reasonably flat with no large, central mountains. The floor does contain some small hills and fissures, and is disrupted in the south by a 16 kilometre crater called Catharina S. Nearby, on the southern wall of Catharina, there is a small, bright, bowl-shaped crater 7 kilometres across, Catharina F.\n\nCatharina\n\nThe crater Catharina is named after Catherine of Alexandria, a Christian saint who was martyred in Egypt aged 18 in about AD 306, on the orders of the pagan Roman emperor Maxentius.\n\nAccording to tradition, she was the daughter of Constus, the governor of Alexandrian Egypt which was then a province of the Roman Empire under the emperor Maximian. When Maximian retired in AD 305, his son Maxentius was passed over for succession as he had little military or administrative experience. By the following year, two joint emperors were in power, Constantine and Galerius. They allowed Maxentius to be regarded as emperor over central and southern Italy (excluding Rome), the islands of Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, and the African provinces including Egypt.\n\nGrowing up in Alexandria, Catherine was a noted scholar, and after seeing a vision of the Madonna and Child, decided to follow Christianity and converted hundreds of people. When Maxentius began persecuting Christians, she went to him and rebuked him for his cruelty. He summoned fifty of his wisest philosophers to question her about her religious faith, but she described her beliefs in such eloquent terms that many of her inquisitors declared themselves Christians and were immediately put to death.\n\nCatherine was then scourged and imprisoned, during which time over 200 people visited her, including Maxentius' wife Valeria. Catherine converted all of them to Christianity and they were subsequently martyred by Maxentius. The furious emperor condemned Catherine to death on the breaking wheel, a terrible form of torture. Here accounts differ slightly. One says that at her touch the wooden wheel shattered. Another says that as she was forced to the wheel, it suddenly began to spin rapidly, eventually flying to pieces. Maxentius then had her beheaded.\n\nHer symbol in paintings is the spiked wheel. As well as having a crater on the Moon named after her, we remember her through the firework popularly known as the rapidly spinning \"Catherine Wheel\".\n\n5: January 2017\n\nThis month's feature is the walled plain Ptolemaeus.\n\nPtolemaeus was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour on August 1, 2017. East (where the Sun is rising) is to the right, north is at the top.\n\nPtolemaeus is a huge walled plain almost in the centre of the Moon's disc as we see it. Its walls reach up to 2400 metres high, and its diameter is very large (averaging 155 kilometres). Because the Moon is small compared with the Earth, the surface is more sharply curved, and the horizon is much closer than on Earth. With Ptolemaeus, even the highest peaks in the walls would be below the horizon for a person standing at its centre.\n\nThe Jesuit priest who named most of the places on the Moon in the mid-17th century, Giovanni Riccioli, named this huge central walled plain after Ptolemaeus or Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer working at the Great Library of Alexandria in Egypt in the 2nd century AD, because Ptolemy played a central and important role in the history of astronomy. Because it is close to the centre of the Moon's disc, we see Ptolemaeus as if we were squarely above it, so there is no fore-shortening.\n\nWhen Ptolemaeus was formed by a huge impact very early in the Moon's history (3.92 to 4.55 billion years ago), lava welled up from its centre and filled the floor, levelling it out. Since that time, only one large impact has marred the surface, although there are hundreds, if not thousands, of craterlets. The one noticeable crater inside Ptolemaeus is in its north-eastern quadrant, and is called Ammonius, after one of the last Greek philosophers, who lived in the 3rd century AD. It is 9 kilometres across and 1850 metres deep. North of Ammonius is a larger 'ghost crater' faintly seen above, which was completely swamped by the flow of molten lava.\n\nThe large crater to the north of Ptolemaeus is called Herschel, after the German-born Englishman William Herschel (1738-1832). It is a young crater 43 kilometres in diameter, with walls reaching heights of 3770 metres. There is a single mountain peak rising from the rugged floor, in an off-centre position.\n\nPtolemaeus\n\nAround the middle of the second century AD, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy, AD 90-168, no relation to the royal Ptolemies who were Macedonian-Greek Pharaohs of Egypt) was a Greek working at the Great Library. (The convention of Latinising ones name, and then using either version, began with the Romans and continued until the end of the 17th century.) Ptolemy was the last of the great Alexandrian natural philosophers (scientists). He read the ancient Greek texts which were available, especially those of Hipparchus, and also the Babylonian records of observations that had been brought there in Alexanders time. He realised that all the fragmented texts should be collated together, and preserved for posterity. Taking Euclids Elements as a model, in AD 150 he summarised the existing works of all the ancient Greek philosophers in mathematics, science and astronomy in a monumental 13-part book.\n\nIt was a textbook of astronomy as it was then known, not a revelation of discoveries that he himself had made. Although he claimed that some of what he wrote was based on his own personal observations, it now appears that some of these observations were from other unattributed sources, or possibly fabricated to fit his theories, a practice not unknown then or now. He called his book η Мαθηματικη Συνταξις or The Mathematike Syntaxis (The Mathematical Compilation). If Ptolemy had not produced this monumental work, most of our knowledge of the Greek philosophers would have been lost when the Great Library was destroyed.\n\nPtolemy amalgamated the ideas of the Greek thinkers into a complete cosmological model, based mainly on the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Apollonius, Aratus and Hipparchus. He reiterated that the Earth was an immovable globe at the centre of the universe, and that the Sun, Moon, planets, stars and the entire heavens revolved around it in circular orbits on eight transparent crystalline spheres, completing one revolution each day. This was the basis of his version of the geocentric view of the universe, which was adopted by astronomers without serious question for the next 1250 years, until the advent of Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\nThe Almagest\n\nOn December 22, AD 640, Muslim armies under Amrou Ibn el-Ass conquered Alexandria. They found the remains of the Library, and discovered thousands of ancient scrolls still hidden there. These were all burned in the local bath-houses to warm the water, except for the works of Aristotle. The destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria by both Christians and Muslims in the name of their religions was both thorough and tragic. Practically everything that had been painstakingly collected over centuries was gone forever. We are left with only fragments. All that remains of the building today is the cellar of the Serapæum, the library annexe, with a few mouldering shelves, but a new Library was built and opened in 2002.\n\nHappily, some full sets of Ptolemys Mathematike Syntaxis were found by Arab soldiers and presented to Arabian astronomers as booty. These men immediately recognised them as great treasure, al-Jahiz (one of their most advanced thinkers), saying The ancient writings are the key to wisdom. They named Ptolemys work الكتاب المجسطي, (Al Megiste  The Great Book). It was translated from Greek into Arabic at Damascus and later at Baghdad's House of Wisdom, and was widely distributed throughout Arab lands. Eventually it found its way to Moorish Spain in the 12th century. There it was translated into Latin and disseminated into Europe, where it helped end the period of ignorance known as the Dark Ages. Known since those times as Ptolemys Almagest, it is the main source of all that we know and understand about the Greek astronomical heritage. After nearly 2000 years it is still being published, and an English translation running to nearly 700 pages can be purchased from Amazon.com for about $160.\n\nWilliam Herschel\n\nWilliam Herschel (1738-1822) started off as an amateur astronomer in Bath, England. After he discovered a new planet in 1781, he named it 'Georgium Sidus' (The Georgian Star) after King George III. The French named the new planet 'Herschel', but the German astronomer Johann Bode suggested that it be called 'Uranus', in keeping with the names of the other planets, which were named after Roman gods. It took the English seventy years to finally adopt the name 'Uranus'. King George made William the King's Astronomer, his only duties being to provide astronomical entertainment when required by the King's guests at Windsor Castle. William moved to Slough, within walking distance of Windsor, and devoted his life to building telescopes and using them effectively. His telescopes were simply the biggest and best in the world at the time, and were capable of looking deeper into space than any others. With these instruments, Herschel amassed a lifelong record of astronomical discovery that would have been worthy of an entire research institute, much less one man.\n\nA partial list of Williams discoveries compiled by his son John in 1825 includes the discovery of Uranus and two of its satellites, Titania and Oberon; discovery of two satellites of Saturn, Enceladus and Mimas; the first measurement of the rotation period of Saturns rings; confirmation of the gaseous nature of the Suns surface; measurement of the heights of lunar mountains; the discovery of 848 binary stars and 2500 nebulae and star clusters; the identification of planetary nebulae, the resolution of the entire Milky Way into stars; the finding that stars differ widely in their intrinsic luminosities; and the determination that the Sun and its solar system are moving through space towards a point in the constellation Hercules, the solar apex. Interested in the link between light and heat, he used a prism to disperse a ray of sunlight into a spectrum, and then placed the bulbs of thermometers at each colour, finding that the red was the hottest. Struck by a flash of inspiration, he then moved the thermometer at the red end of the spectrum into the unlit area further from the violet end, and found the temperature there even hotter. He decided that this area must be lit by invisible light rays which produced heat, and called these rays calorific rays. Soon they became known as infrared radiation, one of Williams most important discoveries.\n\nWhereas previous astronomers had been either painstaking observers like Tycho Brahe and John Flamsteed, excellent telescope makers like Galileo, or ground-breaking theorists like Kepler and Newton, William Herschel was unique in that he was all three combined. Sir Patrick Moore said that Herschel was probably the greatest observer who ever lived.\n\n6: February 2017\n\nThis month's feature is the crater Alphonsus.\n\nAlphonsus was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour on June 22, 2018. East (where the Sun is rising) is to the right, north is at the top.\n\nPtolemaeus, described last month, is a huge crater almost in the centre of the Moon's disc as we see it. Adjoining it on its southern rim is another large crater, Alphonsus, which is 121 kilometres in diameter and has walls up to 2730 metres high. Some of the walls have terraces. The crater floor is fairly flat, but a central spine runs from north to south. Alongside this spine, a large mountain peak is a few kilometres north-east of the crater's centre. The mountain's base has been swamped by lava that has flooded the floor, so that only its peak pokes above the surface. The floor is broken by numerous faults and rilles, some of which are radial but some are roughly parallel to the walls.\n\nIn places on these faults and rilles, there are small craters with dark haloes around them. These are volcanic vents, obviously connected with the fault lines. Called ash volcanoes, they emit quantities of fine-grained dark-coloured ejecta which accumulates around the vent, sometimes filling in the closer parts of the fault trough. There are eleven ash vents visible in the above image.\n\nThe medium-sized crater to the south west (bottom left) is Alpetragius, 41 kilometres across with a bowl-shaped floor. It is unusual in that it has a large dome-shaped mountain in its centre.\n\nThe Jesuit priest who named most of the places on the Moon in the mid-17th century, Giovanni Riccioli, named Alphonsus after King Alfonso X of Castille.\n\nAlphonsus\n\nThe rapid rise of Islam following Mohammeds flight to Medina in AD 622 had a major impact on astronomy and the world. Muslim armies spread west from Mecca, subjugating Syria, Egypt, Libya, Roman Carthage, North Africa, Morocco, and east to Persia and the Indian border. When Muslim soldiers reached Egypt in AD 640, they destroyed what remained of the Great Library of Alexandria (it had been sacked by Christian mobs incited by the Coptic Archbishop Theophilus in AD 391). Yet many of the works of pagan Greek philosophers of the previous ten centuries were regarded as treasure, for the wisest Arab thinkers said, \"The ancient writings are the key to wisdom.\" The scrolls containing the works of Euclid, Archimedes, Plato, Aristotle and Ptolemy were carried back to the Islamic capital of Damascus, and translated from Greek into Arabic. In the next three centuries the Muslim capital was moved to Baghdad and by AD 800 the Caliph al-Mansur had built a 'House of Wisdom' for the translation, copying and distribution of the ancient works. It was a research centre for the study of the humanities, mathematics and science, and was unrivalled in the medieval world. In this way the Arabic translations of the writings of the Greeks were disseminated across North Africa to Morocco, and when the Muslim armies crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and invaded the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nBy AD 750 Muslim armies had occupied the southern and central parts of what we now call Spain, where they were known as 'Moors'. The northern provinces of León, Castile and Galicia remained Christian, with their own Kings. As time went on, the Moorish princes and caliphs became more interested in scholarship, art and architecture than warfare, and established libraries, academies and other seats of learning, particularly at Toledo, Seville, Córdoba and Granada. These communities were very progressive, Córdoba being one of the first medieval towns to have public street lighting. Muslim scientists were encouraged to base themselves in these towns, and they brought with them their Arabic translations of the ancient Greek texts such as Ptolemy's Almagest. The Moors built great citadels and mosques in Spain, the greatest one still existing being the Alhambra palace-fortress at Granada.\n\nAlfonso VI(1040-1109), nicknamed El Bravo (the Brave), was King of León from 1065, and King of Castile and Galicia from 1072. He wished to release Iberia from Muslim domination and enlisted one of his adversaries, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (1043-1099), known to history as El Cid (The Lord and Master), to lead his army. The Christian forces of the combined kingdom of León-Castile liberated Toledo in the Reconquista (re-conquest) of AD 1085. After that, Toledo continued to be a major cultural centre. Its vast Muslim libraries were made freely available to all. Alfonso established a translation centre in the city, in which Arabian books were translated from Arabic or Hebrew to Spanish by Arab and Jewish scholars, and from Spanish to Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost Greek knowledge spread into Europe. Most of the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula including Andalusia remained in Moorish hands.\n\nAbu Ishaq Ibrahim al-Zarqali (Arzachel, AD 1028-1087) was a Muslim astronomer living in Toledo, and as Alfonsos forces approached, he escaped to Córdoba where he continued his work. He laboured to adjust and correct Ptolemys geographical data, specifically the length of the Mediterranean Sea. He prepared accurate zijes (a zij was the Arabic name for a table of positions of stars and planets), using the more recent observations of Arab astronomers al-Khwarizmi and al-Battani to update Ptolemys work and correct for precession. It is quite possible that he implemented his own program of observation, or utilised even more sources, to modernise the older material. Such books of zijes or tables were known by their Spanish-Arabian name al-manakh (calendar), from whence was derived the word almanac. In 1087 he published the Almanac of Azarqueil.\n\nRaymond of Toledo, Archbishop of Toledo from AD 1126 to 1151, continued the efforts of Alfonso\n\nVI by encouraging translation efforts at the library of the Cathedral of Toledo, where he led a team of translators that included Mozarabic Toledans, Jewish scholars, Madrasah teachers and monks from the Order of Cluny. They usually translated the ancient texts from Arabic into Castilian, and then from Castilian into Latin, although in some cases, where the expertise of the translator allowed it, they were translated directly from Arabic into Latin or Greek. The work of these scholars also made available any important texts from Arabic and Hebrew philosophers, if the Archbishop deemed them important enough for a complete understanding of the classical Greek authors, especially Aristotle. As a result of their activities, the cathedral became known as the Toledo School of Translators  a translation centre with an importance not matched in the history of western culture. The present cathedral was begun in 1226.\n\nGerard of Cremona, (AD 1114-1187), born in Cremona in northern Italy, came to the Toledo School of Translators in about AD 1144 in search of Ptolemys Almagest. Since he didnt understand Arabic when he arrived, he had to rely on Jews and Mozarabs for both translation and teaching. He turned out to be the most productive of the Toledan translators at the time, with more than 87 books to his credit. He edited for Latin readers the Tables of Toledo, the most accurate compilation of astronomical and astrological data (ephemerides) ever seen in Europe up until then, These tables were completely up-to-date, and were partly based on al-Zarqalis Almanac of Arzarqueil of AD 1087, and also on the works of Jabir ibn Aflah, the Banu Musa brothers, Abu Kamil, Abu al-Qasim, and Ibn al-Haytham (including his Book of Optics). The Tables of Toledomade a vital contribution to the rebirth of mathematical astronomy in Christian Europe.\n\nGerard was then given a huge task, to translate the Arabic version of the Almagest into Latin. Two Arabic translations of the Greek were then current, one by al-Hajjaj dated AD 827, and one by Ishaq ibn Hunayn dated AD 880. The second one had been revised by Thabit ibn Qurra in AD 901. Gerard had copies of both, and his translation into Latin combined the two. Where the two versions differed, Gerard wrote the alternative translation in a small hand, in the margin. The State Library of Victoria owns a priceless copy of Gerard's translation of the Almagest, hand-copied in Venice between 1200 and 1225.\n\nIn 1212 a coalition of Christian kings led by King Alfonso VIII of Castile drove the Muslims from the central Iberian Peninsula, forcing them into the small Moorish Kingdom of Granada in the south, which lasted for another 280 years.\n\nBy 1252, King Alfonso X (Latin form Alphonsus, AD 1221-1280, right), nicknamed El Sabio (the Wise) of Castile, León and Galicia, ruled northern and central Spain. In Toledo he continued the tradition of translation enthusiastically, having many Arabic scientific and philosophical writings translated into Castilian Spanish by a team of 15 Christian and Jewish savants, including one Muslim convert to Christianity. He took a personal interest in their work, and even wrote introductions to some of the translated books.\n\nKnowing the value of the Tables of Toledo, he assembled a team of scholars and directed that they be translated into Castilian and updated, with all the errors and anomalies removed. He had new instruments made and personally supervised an extensive program of new observations that were needed. A famous but probably apocryphal story says that while he was doing this work, Alfonso commented that the Ptolemæic system was far too complicated mathematically, and \"if the Lord had consulted me before embarking on creation thus, I should have recommended something simpler.\"\n\nIt was through the work of Arzachel, Gerard of Cremona and Alfonso that the astronomical ideas of the ancient Greeks (mostly sourced from Ptolemy's Almagest that had been filtered by translation into Arabic and combined with Arabian mathematical concepts such as the decimal system with its zero and place value, Hindu-Arabic numerals, algebra and trigonometry), were translated into Latin and spread throughout Europe, ending the Dark Ages and eventually leading to the Renaissance. This mixture of cultural ideas is why today we have the majority of constellations in the sky that are from the ancient Greeks, yet are populated with stars that have Arabic names, e.g. Aldebaran, Altair, Deneb, Rigel and Fomalhaut.\n\nAlpetragius\n\nNur ad-Din al-Bitruji (\"Alpetragius\", AD circa 1130-1204) was born in Moorish Andalusia in the south of the Iberian peninsula (Spain). He proposed a theory on planetary motion in which he wished to avoid both epicycles and eccentrics of Ptolemy, and to account for their varying paths and speeds by compounding the rotations of homocentric spheres. It appears that the system he proposed was an amalgamation of that of that of Eudoxus of Cnidus, combined with the motion of fixed stars developed by al-Zarqali (Arzachel). His knowledge of Eudoxus works would have come through the filter of Arabic translations of the Almagest.\n\n7: March 2017\n\nThis month's feature is the crater Petavius:\n\nPetavius was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour on September 14, 2018. East (where the Sun is rising) is to the top, north is to the left.\n\nPetavius is a large circular formation, but as it is near the Moon's limb (edge), it appears to us greatly foreshortened. It is one of the finest crater plains on the entire lunar surface and a grand object under low and medium illumination, but difficult to see approaching Full Moon. It is 182 kilometres in diameter measured from crest to crest, with massive, broad and very complex walls rising to peaks of 3300metres on the west where the wall is double, and 2100 metres on the east. There are traces of a once-complete double rampart, the inner one being lower and less regular than the outer and main wall. The interior is decidedly convex, the central portion being 240 metres higher than that adjoining the walls. In the centre of the floor is a grand, complex mountain group, the principal peak rising 1700 metres and casting a long shadow under a low sun. This, and the details of the group, are best seen when the Moon is two or three days after Full.\n\nFrom this mountain group one of the finest clefts on the entire Moon runs towards the south-west wall, cutting through the inner wall into a valley between the walls. In places this great almost-straight cleft, which can be seen with a very small telescope, has low raised banks, like a canal. The inner third of its length is about 4 kilometres wide, but then it narrows to about 2 kilometres and becomes deeper as it approaches the outer wall. There are a number of small dome-like hills on either side of this feature, known as the Grand Cleft. When the Cleft reaches the western wall, it swings sharply to the south, linking up with a narrow valley that has come south along Petavius' wall from the adjoining crater Wrottesley. The Grand Cleft merges with this valley and they continue as one, heading south for 75 kilometres along the crater wall until turning south-west away from it and petering out. An 11-kilometre crater called Petavius C has impacted on the Cleft in this section.\n\nThe southern half of the floor of Petavius is quite smooth in comparison with the northern half, which is much more rugged and crossed by two winding clefts. One of these connects with the central end of the Great Cleft, and heads roughly north from a valley between the central peaks, before turning to the north-west and petering out. The other is finer, and crosses the crater floor midway between the peaks and the north-east rim. Whereas the Great Cleft and the north-heading one are radial to the crater's centre, this third, delicate cleft runs nearly parallel to the crater rim.\n\nThree parallel clefts run from the central mountains in a south-east direction towards a small 5 kilometre crater, Petavius A, which is halfway from the centre to the main wall. These are quite delicate, as are the numerous craterlets which dot the floor of Petavius. South-west of Petavius A is a cluster of low domes, visible in the image above.\n\nThe surrounding region is very complex, consisting of ridges gradually radiating away from the rim of Petavius with shallow valleys between. The whole area around the crater has been swamped with superheated liquified rock, melted from the heat caused by the impact which created Petavius.\n\nAs Petavius is near the south-east limb of the Moon, we see the crater at an angle, which foreshortens its circular shape into an ellipse. On the southern wall of Petavius (on the right in the picture above, is an 11 kilometre wide crater, Petavius C. A peculiar double ridge 150 kilometres long passes through Petavius C and ends at the end of the Great Cleft. To the west of Petavius is the 60 kilometre wide crater Wrottesley which, like most large impact craters, also has a central mountain group. Petavius was created in the Lower Imbrian period (3.8 to 3.85 billion years ago), while the later crater Wrottesley, adjoining its western ramparts, dates from the Upper Imbrium period (3.2 to 3.8 billion years ago).\n\nPetavius\n\nThe crater's name is the Latinised version of the name of a French chronologist, Denis Pétau (1583-1652). He was also a historian and theologian, but his connection with astronomy is quite obscure. The crater was named by Riccioli in 1651.\n\nWrottesley\n\nThis crater is named after John Wrottesley (1798-1867), a 19th century English astronomer who did valuable work in cataloguing double stars and measuring star positions. The crater was named by Birt and Lee in 1865.\n\n8: April 2017\n\nThis month are featured three neighbouring craters: Eratosthenes, Copernicus and Stadius.\n\nEast (where the Sun is rising) is to the right, north is to the top. Eratosthenes is the crater at top right, and part of Copernicus is seen at the lower left corner. Above the centre of the bottom margin is the ghost crater Stadius, a little larger than Eratosthenes.\n\nEratosthenes is the 60 kilometre wide crater at upper right, at the south-western end of a spectacular range of mountains called the Apennines (see #15 below which adjoins). It is typical of a medium-sized crater, with a cluster of central peaks. It was formed between 1.1 and 3.2 billion years ago. The debris field caused by rubble blasted out from the Copernicus impact fills most of the image, and the ghost crater Stadius can be faintly seen at bottom centre. Some peaks at upper left are part of the Montes Carpatus or Carpathian Mountains (see image #60 below).\n\nThis is the spectacular impact crater Copernicus in all its magnificence. A high peak on the eastern rim throws a conspicuous shadow onto the level floor. To achieve images of this clarity, the photographer must wait for a night when the atmosphere is very still. When the air is turbulent, astronomers say \"the seeing is poor tonight\" and turn to other tasks. On August 2, 2017 when the above images were acquired, the \"seeing\" was excellent. Even the best Earth-based optical telescope has its work restricted to some extent by the vagaries of atmospheric conditions, which is why there are quite a few orbiting observatories in space now.\n\nThe crater Copernicus, with a diameter of 95 kilometres, is only about 1 billion years old. Lava welled up through fissures caused by the impact and pooled on the floor, which is about 3.8 kilometres below the outside lunar surface. The north-western quadrant of the floor is quite level, with a few small volcanic domes, but the rest of the floor is fairly rugged. There are two clusters of mountain peaks near the centre of Copernicus. Tremendous landslips are found all around the circumference, where surface material has slumped down to the floor, producing uneven terraces.\n\nThe oldest crater is 71 kilometre wide Stadius, found between Copernicus and Eratosthenes, and is so ancient that numerous lava flows have filled it up and almost obliterated it, making what is called a 'ghost crater'.\n\nThese three impact craters are not far from the centre of the Moon, so they are seen almost directly from above, and are not much foreshortened. Although there are some volcanoes on the Moon with craters at their summits, by far the vast majority of deep, circular features with raised rims that cover much of the Moon's surface are caused by the impacts of flying pieces of rock onto the lunar surface. In 1791 Johann Schröter named these features 'craters', from the Latin word for 'cup', because of their profile. He also named certain valleys 'rilles', from the German word for 'grooves'.\n\nIn the Moon's distant past, when the Solar System was very young, there was a lot of material circling the Sun which came into collision with the newly-formed planets and their satellites or moons. This material was in the form of rocks ranging in size from sand grains and pebbles up to car-sized and even as large as Tasmania. Each planet's gravity swept most of them up, but there are still plenty of them still flying free in space. We call them SSSBs (Small Solar System Bodies). The small ones are commonly known as meteors when they strike our atmosphere and burn up by friction; larger ones may develop tails of dust and vented gas when approaching the Sun and are known as comets, and the biggest ones are sometimes called asteroids. The largest asteroid, Ceres, has a diameter about a quarter of that of our Moon, and is called a 'dwarf planet'.\n\nIf one of these objects flying through space hits a rocky planet with little of no atmosphere to slow it down, then the impact creates a huge crater. Mercury, Mars, the Moon and satellites of the outer planets have areas which are covered with overlapping craters. Even the Earth has had numerous strikes, and the evidence of many is still visible today, despite two or three billion years of weathering and erosion. Two large 'astroblemes' in Australia are Wolfe Creek crater in the Kimberley District and Gosse's Bluff in Central Australia, where a collection of smaller craters at Henbury can also be found.\n\nOn the Moon, a large impact crater like Copernicus is caused when a large rock flying through space - say about the size of Nambour - hits the lunar surface when travelling at a typical 30 kilometres per second. This flying mountain has great mass and its speed gives it great kinetic energy. On impact with the Moon, the rock is stopped short in a tiny fraction of a second, and its kinetic energy is instantaneously converted into heat energy, which vaporises the rock in a stupendous blast that creates the crater. Great amounts of molten rock (called 'rock melt') are deposited all around the site of the impact, covering and blurring older features and clearly visible in the pictures. Rocks and boulders as large as city blocks are flung out in all directions for many hundreds (occasionally thousands) of kilometres. These rain down on the Moon's landscape, peppering the area with craterlets, many with shapes elongated radially from the impact. These types of craterlets are conspicuous in the central region of the picture above, some being in lines where a large block has bounced along the surface, leaving a craterlet each time it hit the ground.\n\nThe lunar surface was originally a light grey in colour, but as it ages, the continual rain of micrometeorites and particles from the Sun (mainly protons and ions) coats each soil particle with a very thin layer of metallic iron called nanophase iron (npFeo). This darkens each grain and hence the area of the surface in general, according to how long it has remained undisturbed. When there is a large impact nearby, material ejected from the new crater disturbs the surface in a pattern radial to the crater, bringing the lighter coloured subsoil to the surface and creating a pattern of light-coloured rays centred on the new impact crater. The craters Copernicus and Kepler have widespread ray systems. By far the most spectacular ray system on the near side of the Moon is centred on the southern crater Tycho (see #18 below), whose rays spread across the Moon for thousands of kilometres. They are most prominent around the time of Full Moon.\n\nAs well as the blast going outwards, it also sends a powerful pulse of energy downwards into the Moon. When this pulse hits the solid bedrock, it bounces back up to the surface, fracturing and lifting the floor of the crater just formed. This is the origin of the clusters of central peaks found in the middle of the floor of a majority of impact craters, such as Eratosthenes above. Copernicus also has a cluster of peaks, but they are only 1200 metres high. In the image above, their summits, being 2560 metres lower than the surrounding rim, are yet to be illuminated by the sun's rays.\n\nIf the downward pulse of energy is powerful enough to fracture the bedrock, thereby releasing pressure on the hot rocks below, they immediately liquefy into molten magma which forces its way up to the crater floor, where it pools, sometimes overwhelming the cluster of new peaks and creating a flat floor to the crater. The large crater plain Ptolemaeus (described above as\n\n#5 ) and visible in the small Full Moon image and the waxing gibbous Moon image at the top of this page as a circular flat area almost in the Moon's exact centre) was created in this way. There have been no craters larger than a kilometre in diameter formed in the 408 years since Galileo first looked at the Moon through a telescope in 1609.\n\nCopernicus\n\nSince the time of Pythagoras in the sixth century before Christ, all educated Greeks and Egyptians knew that the world was shaped like a sphere. Its actual size was still open to conjecture. They believed that the Earth was fixed and unmoving at the centre of the universe (a 'geocentric' view), and that the Sun, Moon, planets and stars revolved around the Earth once per day, being carried on transparent crystalline spheres. A few thinkers in the third and second centuries BCE, such as Aristarchus and Seleucus, thought that the Sun was at the centre of the universe (a 'heliocentric' view), and that the Earth was just another planet revolving around it in a year and rotating on its axis once each day, but they were not taken seriously.\n\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century AD, the Renaissance was under way. The printing press has been invented, Columbus had discovered the New World, Vasco da Gama had found a sea route to India, and people like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were changing the art world. Niklas Koppernigk (Latinised to Nicolaus Copernicus, 1473-1543) was by 1506 a well-educated Renaissance man. He was a physician, economist, diplomat, mathematician, classical scholar, military leader, governor and artist. He worked as a Canon at Frauenburg Cathedral in East Prussia (now Frombork in Poland), but did not take holy orders. His hobby was astronomy.\n\nHe had read the Epitome of the Almagest by Regiomontanus, which described the fixed Earth and transparent spheres surrounding it, and thought the whole system as described by Aristotle and Ptolemy was mathematical sleight-of-hand. Though it gave fairly good predictions of planetary movements for astrologers, the whole complicated system with its epicycles, deferents and an equant seemed to be based on a lie. The more he studied Ptolemy's original Almagest when it was finally published by printing press in 1515, the more he realised that all the complications would vanish if the Sun replaced the Earth at the centre of the planetary orbits, and each planet would then snap into place.\n\nHe decided to begin work on a book of his own, using the Almagest as a model. In his book, he would clearly and patiently piece his theory together, fully explaining it with mathematical proofs and rigorous logic. He did not know it, but his book would restore interest in the heliocentric system suggested by Aristarchus in the 3rd century BCE, and lead directly to new laws of physics.\n\nThe book took about twenty years to write, but Copernicus was afraid to publish it as he felt that the Church, which strongly supported the geocentric view, would see his idea of an Earth moving around the Sun as an attack on the holy scriptures. After all, Psalm 105:5 said quite definitely, \"He set the Earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.\" In his last years, he finally agreed to publish 500 copies of it, and an unbound copy fresh off the press was placed in his hands as he lay comatose on his deathbed. The book was called De Revolutionibus (On the Revolutions). It was indeed 'revolutionary', and gave us the word to use for anything that challenges the existing order of things.\n\nThere was no theory of universal gravitation existing at the time to provide physical support for Copernicus system. Initially, the book made little impact. Reading it in Latin was heavy going, and not many people read it through completely; but before long most scholars were aware of the substance of the heliocentric theory, and a small but growing group of astronomers were convinced of its veracity and studied it in great detail. It was treasured by all who had a copy pass through their hands, and the wide margins of the copies still in existence are full of comments and notes. 275 of the 500 first edition copies are still with us, and priceless. In the end, De Revolutionibus was enough. It would be recognised as the greatest scientific book of the sixteenth century. It would change the world forever, but not until the invention of the telescope in 1608 proved that the Earth and other planets did indeed orbit the Sun.\n\nEratosthenes\n\nThis crater is named after Eratosthenes, who was a custodian of the Great Library in Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile two centuries before the birth of Christ. Many of our Greek myths about the constellations come to us through his writings and those of Hyginus.\n\nThe story goes that Eratosthenes was told by a visitor to the Great Libray that at noon on the summer solstice (June 21), the Sun shone vertically down a well further up the Nile River at Syene, its reflection appearing in the water. Also, vertical sticks and tall columns were seen to swallow their shadows around the time of the summer solstice. He checked this the following year and found that it was so, and that, at the same time on the same day, the Sun was 7.2º from the vertical at Alexandria.\n\nKnowing the distance between the two observing sites to be 5000 stadia or about 800 kilometres, a stade or stadion being 157.5 metres (he hired professional steppers to pace it out using a standard stride), he used this information to make a famous measurement of the diameter and circumference of the Earth, getting quite an accurate result. His method was simple: the 7.2º angle between the two towns is about one-fiftieth of a circle of 360º. This distance equals 800 kilometres.\n\nTherefore the circumference of the whole circle (the Earth) equals 50 × 800 km = 40 000 km. His calculation of the Earths circumference turned out to be very close to the true figure of 40 025 km (polar circumference), but it seems that he had more than his share of good fortune. The fact that Syene is slightly north of the Tropic of Cancer should have made the Sun shine down the well at a slight angle, not vertically. We are not told how deep the well was, and if it was exactly vertical. Would the use of their primitive measuring instruments at Alexandria have provided the quoted accuracy? How accurate were the measurements of the man or men who paced the distance? Did he use an 'Egyptian Stadion' or an 'Attic Stadion'? All of these factors would have introduced small errors into his observations and calculations, but luckily they appear to have cancelled each other out. In any case, he was the first man to measure the size of a planet, and all he used was sticks, eyes, feet and brains.\n\nEratosthenes is credited with the invention of the armillary sphere. Although not the first Greek to do so, he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic (its inclination to the equator) and realised that this figure indicated the amount of tilt of the Earths axis. His result of 23½º was only 7 arcminutes from the correct figure. He drew a map of the Hellenistic world for use by navigators. It was later used as a basis for a map by Claudius Ptolemy in his Almagest , and was not superseded until the great voyages of discovery at the end of the fifteenth century.\n\nStadius\n\nOne of the first astronomical almanacs to be based solely on the heliocentric system of Copernicus was the Ephemerides novae at auctae of Jan Stade (Latinised to Johannes Stadius, 1527-1579), published at Cologne in 1554. Avidly read and enthusiastically used by Tycho Brahe and Michel de Nostradamus, this set of planetary tables fearlessly stated that its calculations were made using the heliocentric system.\n\n9: May 2017\n\nThis month's features include the craters Aristarchus and Herodotus, and the unusual Schröter's Valley.\n\nAristarchus is the bright 41 km crater at right, Herodotus is the flooded 36 km crater to its left. Vallis Schöteri (Schröter's Valley) is the remarkable feature to their north, and is 165 km long. The valley begins at a small crater in the highlands between Aristarchus and Herodotus, widens out and then narrows again heading north, before zig-zagging to the north-west and then turning to the south-west, where it narrows further and peters out. It has been described as like a snake, in particular as a cobra, and its widest area near its starting point has become known as the 'Cobra Head'. A delicate rille 200 metres wide like a dry water course meanders along the margins of the valley, visible above for most of its length. There is a complex of narrow, winding rilles in the north-eastern corner of this image. North is to the top, east (where the Sun is rising) is to the right.\n\nThis area is in the north-western quadrant of the Moon, and is considerably fore-shortened. The brightest crater is Aristarchus, 41 kilometres in diameter and being less than 500 million years old is fairly recent. It is one of the brightest lunar craters, and can be seen in the dark part of the waxing crescent Moon, being faintly illuminated by Earthshine (sunlight reflected off the Earth, which would be nearly Full if the Moon is New). It stands on a rocky plateau, and its walls rise about 600 metres above the surrounding lava plain of the Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms). The interior walls have rugged terraces, and there is a small central mountain which is only about 350 metres high. The western interior slopes have a number of dark, radial bands running up them, two of which can be seen in small telescopes. The interior of Aristarchus is bowl-shaped, except for a small flat section at its centre, where lava has welled up and pooled.\n\nHerodotus is a much older crater, being over three billion years old. It is 36 kilometres in diameter and its dark interior is in striking contract to that of Aristarchus. The narrow walls enclose a flat floor, which was once a lake of molten lava. The northern part of the crater wall has been struck by another meteor, leaving a 4 kilometre crater called Herodotus N. Between Aristarchus and Herodotus is an upland region, probably volcanic in origin.\n\nSchröter's Valley begins in this upland area, in a deep crater 8 kilometres across (the Cobra Head), which adjoins a larger crater about 10 kilometres across (sometimes called the Cobra's Hood). There is a large landslip on the western side of this larger crater. The Valley heads north, then north-west, then south-west, for a length of about 165 kilometres. Its width varies between 6 and 10 kilometres, tapering down to about 500 metres at its western end. The fine rille which runs the length of the floor is 200 metres wide. Schröter's Valley is without doubt one of the strangest and interesting formations on the Moon.\n\nAristarchus\n\nAristarchus of Samos (ca. 310-230 BCE), born ten years after the death of Aristotle, spent time conducting research at the new Great Library of Alexandria. He was one of the first to apply mathematical principles to astronomy, and taught that all the seven planets were spherical as was the Earth; what is more, the Earth rotated on its axis daily. Interested in improving mapping, he worked towards the concepts of latitude and longitude, which were developed further by Eratosthenses.\n\nAristarchus obtained reasonable estimates of the Moons size and distance by logical reasoning and sound application of Euclids geometry, after observing a lunar eclipse, thus: A full shadow of the Earth on the Moon has an apparent radius of curvature equal to the difference between the apparent radii of the Earth and the Sun as seen from the Moon. This radius can be seen to equal 0.75 degree, from which (with the solar apparent radius of 0.25 degree) we get an apparent radius of the Earth of 1 degree. This gives an Earth-Moon distance of 60 Earth radii or 384 000 km. This result can be compared with the Earth-Moon distances this month under\n\nLunar Orbital Elements in The Sky Tonight page.\n\nAristarchus expressed the belief that the Sun was twenty times further away than was the Moon. He also deduced that the Sun was far bigger than the Earth, and this may have led him to the conclusion that the Earth should revolve around the Sun, rather than the reverse. Developing this idea further, he proposed a true heliocentric system, the first person to do so. He taught that the Earth rotated on its axis each day, and travelled around the Sun once in a year. In this he anticipated Copernicus by nearly two millennia.\n\nAristarchus pictured a universe many times larger than any that had previously been imagined. The geocentric theories of his predecessors cosseted the Earth snugly inside the planets crystalline shells like a cosmic egg, but Aristarchus placed the Sun at the centre of a huge void, with the Moon close to Earth, the planets much farther away, and the stars at such great distances as to be almost beyond comprehension. We do not know for sure if he realised that the stars were at different distances, or if he agreed with the accepted wisdom of the time (harking back three centuries to Anaximander) that they were all located on a remote black sphere of fixed stars.\n\nThe idea of a spinning Earth was ridiculous to the geocentrists, and indeed to practically everyone. Stand outside at night, they said, and watch the stars slowly wheeling overhead. The Earth feels solid and motionless under your feet. If it were spinning, you would feel it. Also, they knew that the Earth was large, and if it rotated once in a day, then mountains, rivers and cities would be careering around at many hundreds of kilometres per hour. Gale-force winds would rake the landscapes. Houses, animals and people would be flung off and whirled away up into the sky and out of sight. Surely, common sense dictated that the Earth doesnt move, but the objects in the sky do. The Sun rises and sets, does it not? Geocentrists also claimed that, if the Earth were truly moving, a ball thrown vertically upward would not fall back into the hand of the thrower, but would be left behind as the Earth carried the thrower away. The concept of inertia was not known at the time.\n\nThe heliocentric theory of Aristarchus was rejected by all major thinkers, with one exception, the mathematician Seleucus of Seliucia (190-150 BCE). Living near Babylon, Seleucus only heard about it 100 years after Aristarchus had proposed it. According to Plutarch, Seleucus believed the Sun-centred, revolving Earth world view was a fact, and was the first to prove it so through reasoning. We do not know what arguments he used. The world was not yet ready for a heliocentric solar system, and the Earth-centred universe would be the accepted model for another 1800 years.\n\nHerodotus\n\nHerodotus (484-420 BDE) was a Greek historian in the fifth century before Christ. He was a contemporary of Philolaus and Socrates, in the generation before Plato. Cicero has called him \"the Father of History\", as he was the first writer to record historical events critically as a factual narration, rather than following the tradition of Homer in romanticising and embellishing the stories, as in the legend of the Odyssey. His work is the earliest Greek prose that has survived intact.\n\nSchröter\n\nJohann Hieronymus Schröter (1745-1816)was a wealthy German lawyer in Hanover who became interested in astronomy. In 1779 he acquired a three feet long (almost one metre) achromatic refractor with a 2¼ inch (57 mm) lens by Dollond to observe the Sun, Moon and Venus. Herschels discovery of Uranus in 1781 inspired Schröter to pursue amateur astronomy more seriously. He resigned his post and moved out of Hanover to the darker and clearer skies of the countryside, becoming chief magistrate and district governor of Lilienthal.\n\nIn 1786 he paid 600 Reichstaler (equivalent to six months earnings) for a 2.14 metre focal length, 16.5 cm aperture reflector by Schrader, with eyepieces allowing up to 1200 magnification. He paid another 26 Thaler for a screw-micrometer.\n\nSoon he had become an accomplished selenographer, and in 1791 he published an important early study on the topography of the Moon entitled Selenotopographische Fragmente zur genauern Kenntniss der Mondfläche, (Fragments of the Moons Topography for a more accurate Knowledge of the Lunar Surface). By this time, Latin had been phased out as the language of science, and such books were being written in the common language of their authors. This book introduced the Latin word crater (cup), and the German word Rille (groove) to the lunar terminology.\n\nSchröter knew his history of astronomy and named 76 new features, including the craters Alhazen, Bernoulli, Bradley, Cassini, Euler, LaCaille, Tobias Mayer, Mercator, Picard and Rømer. He named two craters Hooke and Newton, but, knowing of the bitter enmity between these two men in their lifetimes, he placed them as far apart on the Moon as he could, Hooke away up in the northern hemisphere and Newton near the South Pole.\n\nAlso named were Mount Huygens, Mount Hadley, Mount Pico, Mont Blanc and the Leibniz Mountains. Like most astronomers, he preferred Ricciolis names over those of Hevelius and Langrenus, and this fact influenced the official acceptance in the 20th century of most of Ricciolis names by the International Astronomical Union. He discovered Schröter's Valley in 1787, which was named after him by later astronomers.\n\n10: June 2017\n\nThis month's feature is the Apollo 11 landing site, Tranquility Base.\n\nThis area was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour on July 30, 2017. The landing site is shown by an ' x '. Three craterlets have been officially named after the astronauts. Armstrong is 4.6 kilometres in diameter, Collins is 2.4 kilometres, and Aldrin is 3.4 kilometres. The lunar module's landing approach was from the east (right). North is to the top.\n\nTranquility Base is the place where human beings first stepped onto another world. Three astronauts from the USA lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on July 16, 1969 in a space vehicle comprising a three-stage Saturn V rocket on which was placed the three-part spacecraft that would travel to the Moon. The three parts were the Service Module (SM, unmanned) to which was attached the Command Module (CM, named \"Columbia\") in which the astronauts travelled, and the Lunar Module (LM, at the time called the 'Lunar Excursion Module' or LEM, named \"Eagle\") which was designed to descend to the Moon's surface with two astronauts on board. The LM was housed at lift-off in a 'garage' or adapter on top of the third Saturn V stage and behind the SM. During trans-lunar orbit the SM + CM had to separate from the third rocket stage, use their thrusters to turn through 180 degrees, dock with the LM, and then withdraw it from its 'garage'. The SM + CM + LM then headed for the Moon as a unit, the LM leading. The third Saturn V stage went into orbit around the Sun.\n\nAfter travelling for four days, the Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin climbed through from the CM into the LM, and the two vehicles separated. The Command Module Pilot Michael Collins remained in the CM in lunar orbit and did not take part in the landing. The landing site is on a great lava-plain called Mare Tranquillitatis or the Sea of Tranquility. It is within a degree of the Moon's equator.\n\nOn a few orbits over the area before the descent, Armstrong and Aldrin were able to identify the landmarks they needed to pinpoint the chosen level landing area. Some of these landmarks were the twin craters of Ritter (32 kilometres diameter) and Sabine (31 kilometres), both seen near the left margin of the above image about a third of the way down from the top. They are the largest craters in the image. Another was a long rille, double in places with a flat floor, running for nearly 200 kilometres from just south of Sabine in an east-south-easterly direction. This is called the Rimae Hypatia or Hypatia Rille - it was unofficiallty dubbed by NASA \"US Highway 1\". Just north of this \"highway\" near its eastern end was a small but bright crater, Moltke (7 kilometres across). It can be seen above, just below and south-south-east of the actual landing site, which is shown with a yellow ' x '.\n\nThree craterlets in a line north of the landing area were unofficially named Armstrong, Collins and Aldrin, in order from right to left as that was the direction of the LM's flight path. These craters appear in the image above, just below the printed names. The first was 5 kilometres across, the other two were 3 kilometres. These names are now official, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) having made an exception to the rule that craters can only be named after a person posthumously.\n\nThe LM, using the engine in its lower half as a brake, slowed down and landed on the Moon at 6:17:40 am on July 21 (Australian Eastern Standard Time). The touch-down was at the far western end of the planned landing area, about 15 kilometres south of the craterlet Collins. Six hours and 38 minutes later, Armstrong placed his left foot on the Moon's powdery surface at 12:56:15 pm AEST. Queensland school children watched his \"one small step for man\" on television during their lunchtime and most of the afternoon's lessons were set aside so that they could participate in the historic event. Armstrong and Aldrin spent 21½ hours on the lunar surface, taking pictures, deploying experiments and collecting 21.55 kilograms of rocks and soil. Seven of those hours were spent in resting inside the LM after their strenuous activities.\n\nAt 3:54 am AEST on July 22 the ascent stage of the Lunar Module lifted off the Moon and docked with the orbiting Command Module, after which the LM was left in orbit around the Moon and subsequently crashed. The LM's descent stage remains on the Moon where it has been photographed occasionally by mapping satellites, such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on March 7, 2012. The three astronauts, now together again in the CM, fired the SM's rocket motor to return them to the Earth. Prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, the SM was jettisoned and the CM turned so that its heat shield was facing forward. The CM splashed down in the mid-Pacific Ocean 24 kilometres from the recovery ship, USS Hornet on July 25 at 2:51 am AEST, after a total trip lasting 8 days 3 hours and 19 minutes. Of the 3000 tonne Saturn V + Apollo space vehicle, only the 5 tonne Command Module returned safely to the Earth. Neil Armstrong departed this life in 2012 aged 82, and Michael Collins in April 2021 aged 90. On January 20, 2024, Buzz Aldrin celebrated his 94th birthday.\n\nKey to features 11 to 20 below.\n\n11: July 2017\n\nThis month's feature is the large walled-plain named Plato.\n\nThis area was photographed from Starfield Observatory, Nambour on January 26, 2018. North is to the top. It was morning to an observer at Plato, with the Sun rising in the east (right), and the shadows stretching away to the west (left). The area is dominated by the large oval formation at centre, which was named by Riccioli and Grimaldi in 1651 after the ancient Greek philosopher Plato.\n\nThis image of Plato was acquired on the morning of March 6, 2021, at 6:15 am. At Nambour, the Sun had risen at 5:44 am and was six degrees above the eastern horizon. This timing was necessary to capture this view which to an observer at Plato would be in the afternoon, with the Sun setting in the west (to the left), and shadows stretching away to the east (right).\n\nPlato is a huge walled plain with a diameter of 104 kilometres. As it lies at lunar latitude 51 degrees North, we see Plato greatly foreshortened, but if we could see it from directly above, it would be almost perfectly circular. It is even more foreshortened in the images in item #12 below. The impactor which caused Plato struck the Moon in a rugged, mountainous area called Montes Alpes (the Alps), lying between the Mare Frigoris (Sea of Cold) and Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The floor of Plato is remarkably flat, and is evidently the solidified surface of a great lake of molten lava, which welled up and half-filled the crater after the initial impact fractured the underlying bedrock. In the western half there is a very low lava dome or shield volcano that is 30 kilometres wide and 40 kilometres long. The dark floor is dotted with dozens of small craterlets. The five largest of them average two kilometres in diameter and have interior shadows. There are over twenty tinier craterlets detectable in the image above.\n\nThe bright walls average 2000 metres in height, with some peaks being much higher. Under a low Sun, the peaks throw long shadows across the floor. The western wall exhibits a huge landslip, where a large mass has slumped down and now intrudes upon the floor. Two smaller landslides can be seen in the north-western wall. A narrow but prominent valley leads from the interior floor through the south-eastern wall, then immediately turns south-west and runs parallel to the wall, eventually reaching the plain of Mare Imbrium. The largest other crater in this image is 23 kilometre Bliss, lying to the north-west of Plato.\n\nTo the south-west of Plato, in the lower left corner of the image, is a bright mountain range protruding from the cooled lavas of the Mare Imbrium. It is called the Montes Teneriffe or Teneriffe Mountains (after the volcanoes that rise out of the Atlantic Ocean to form the Canary Islands). Two of the mountains in the northern spur exceed 2000 metres in height, and the furthest one to the east reaches 2500 metres.\n\nNaming the Moon\n\nAs far as we know, the first person to name lunar features was William Gilbert (1544-1603), an Englishman, who made a sk"
