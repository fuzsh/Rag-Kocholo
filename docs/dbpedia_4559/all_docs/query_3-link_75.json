Here is how the editorial concludes: It does indicate that the standards are being tightened, and pleas for trade barriers will be more carefully examined than per- haps they have been. The letter is only a straw In the wind. But the wind is blowing in the proper direction. My goodness, Mr. Speaker, what are these people talking about-\"blowing in the proper direction\"? So far we have not been getting any real relief from the escape clause at all, as I have demon- strated. Does the Washington Post sug- gest now that it is going to be even tougher to get relief from the escape clause in the future than it has been in the past? Getting lower than 12 per- cent would be pretty hard to do, after all. And we are told that this is a step in the right direction? What do these people want, anyway? Do they want to ignore completely the clearly expressed intent of Congress? Well, Mr. Speaker, if that is what is really projected-that no relief at all should be granted to those who are genuinely and demonstrably in need of this relief, and for whom Con- gress has determined relief should be provided-then we will indeed, in my judgment, be sailing into dark and dan- gerous waters ahead for the whole con- cept of reciprocal trade. Fortunately, Mir. Speaker, there came out of the Tariff Commission the other day another favorable decision, and this one was not by a split vote, as was the case with the baseball gloves, but by a unanimous decision. It was in behalf of the carpet industry. That is the same industry that went before the Commis- sion 2 years ago, as I said, and got turned down this year. They saw things getting worse and they went back to the Commission to show to the Com- mission the increased gravity of the em- ployment situation and presented other pertinent economic data about the de- cline in jobs and the tremendous rise in imports. This time the Commission reversed itself and rendered a unani- mously favorable decision for the carpet industry, specifically with regard to wilton and velvet carpets, a decision which is being hailed by the way, back in my district, in Amsterdam, and else- where as the first real ray of light and hope that his shined on this seriously depressed economic community in many and many a year. I congratulate the Tariff Commission on their courage in reversing an earlier position. Today this decision of theirs rests on the desk of the President of the United States and I certainly hope and pray that he will speedily grant to the carpet industry the relief recommended by the Tariff Com- mission. I hope so in the first place, because the city of Amsterdam desperately needs this relief. They tell me back home that if, the President grants the relief recommended almost 5D0 jobs will be created overnight in Amsterdam. What music to the ears of a local de- pressed area, what a delicious tonic for those back home who wonder some- times whether we here in Government really care any more. And secondly, this relief should be ap- proved. Mr. Speaker, because only by the acceptance of this kind of unani- mously favorable recommendation out of the Tariff Commission can there be any assurance that the escape clause is actually working after all, and that the wind really is blowing in the proper di- rection, the direction Congress intended it should blow. Mr. Speaker, let us speak frankly. The reciprocal trade program comes up for extension next year. With this kind of legislation before us, it will be most important that every Member determine whether the will of Congress has in fact been carried out in the time since Con- gress last acted. Does reciprocal trade hurt domestic industry? Has the escape clause pro- cedure which Congress provided in order to relieve these affected industries ac- tually been administered to grant help? Here, in the carpet case then, is a golden opportunity, it seems to me, to prove that this escape clause can and does and will be allowed to work. I am sure I speak for all of the people in my district and for many other thousands of people connected with the carpet in- dustry and with the textile industry around the Nation, when I say we earn- estly hope the decision of the President will be a favorable one, and that the recommendation of the Tariff Commis- sion granting relief to the carpet indus- try will bey approved. In this way Amer- ican working men and women can have confidence that their Government in its concern for people overseas has not for- gotten or neglected those here at home who also have proper and legitimate needs. SIZE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRE- SENTATIVES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under previous order of the House, the gentle- man from Massachusetts [Mr. LANE] is recognized for 15 minutes. Mr. LANE. Mr. Speaker, through the ages, from Plato to Locke, philosophers have theorized as to the best form of government wherein the innate best qualities of the individual can be given full and free expression. Our forefathers crystallized and put into serviceable form the philosophies for a theoretical good government when they devised the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. By adopting a repre- sentative form of government and by asserting as basic principles of govern- ment that man's inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursut of happi- ness is a democratic institution, they gave substance and meaning to western civilization. Through such means, and to that end, democracy became synonymous with man's highest attainment in and for self-government, and since the adoption of the Constitution in 1789, the world has seen governments rise on the promise of adopting those principles and has seen governments topple for failure to grasp or maintain them. 14793 Today there are governments who pro- claim themselves to be democratic but by their principles, organization, and practices it is clear that they are the same forms of tyranny against which man has always fought to free himself. The term \"democracy\" has been ex- ploited by those who would enslave or continue the enslavement of mankind and under its, guise and through decep- tive practices it was used to foist com- munism, fascism, nazism, and every form of dictatorship and oppression up- on millions of people everywhere. However other people and other na- tions may be duped or betrayed, in other countries, Band forced into a dictatorship, it was the will and the wisdom of the founding fathers that our txue concept of a just government, of equal rights, of majority rule and minority interests, be preserved[. For that purpose they de- termined that the House of Representa- tives shall be the body of the Govern- ment closest to the people so that the people shall always have unhindered access to their Government; so that the people shall always have, in their Gov- ernment, a:a: unstified voice; so that the Government; can speedily and readily de- termine the will of the people. Consonant with those ideals and prin- ciples, as trace country grew and as new States were admitted to the Union, this House was enlarged consistently through every decennial census since the First Congress in 1789 until the Thirteenth Census in 1910, and those increases were conformable to the thinking of the framers of the Constitution and the States that adopted it. There was one exception, in 1840, when due to a mathematical peculiarity, the House was reduced in size although the population increased grid the anomaly was immedi- ately corrected. When the census of 1910 showed the then unprecedented increase in popu- lation from Ili million in 1900 to 91 mil- lion in 1910, an increase of 16 million in a single decade, the apportionment act of 1911 fixed the total membership of the House at the then existing figure of 435 seats. which included an allow- ance for the contemplated admission of Arizona and New Mexico into the Union and that constituted a sizable increase over the 391 seats under the :L900 census. From 1910 to this very date, the size of the House was fixed at 435 seats al- though the population increased by 31 million between 1910 and 1930, an addi- tional 28 million between 1930 and 1950, and a further additional increase of 29 million between 1950 and 1960. An increase of 16 million in popula- tion plus the contemplated entrance of 2 States into the Union gave rise to settling the size of the House from 393 seats to 435 seats, back in 1910. Noth- ing, however:, was done during the inter- vening years while the population in- creased by 88 million and two more States, Alaska, and Hawaii, were ad- mitted into the Union. Whereas the apportionment ratio per thousand in- creased from 194 in 1900 for a popula- tion of 75 million to 211 in 1910 for a population of 91,972,266, the present ratio is now 412, under the 1960 census, Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP64B00346R000200110008-4 1961 Approvec~~e~R/1/ ~bA-R HOUSE 3468000200110008-4 1 4 As a result, some organized religious groups have taken unprecedented stands against these irresponsible attacks. The leader of the United Presbyterian Church, Dr. Eugene Carson Blake, urged T embers of his church to \"get off the de- nsive and in every church begin the attack that our Nation needs to be protected from those who in their fear of communism would destroy American freedom.\" In striking out at Welch and the Birchers, Blake said, \"The old lies are being actively circulated by the same people who were Mc- Carthy's stooges a few years ago but are now organized into typical totalitarian cells. His argument to trust him is that he (Welch) has a 'nose for Communists.' I don't think his nose is very accurate if he -calls Presi- dent Eisenhower a Communist.\" Follow- ing Blake's address to the sessions of the Los Angeles Presbytery on May 8, the dele- gates unanimously passed a resolution alert- Ing their membership to slanderous accusa- tions and charges of communism in the church.\" In a recent appearance in California, Welch told an audience that 7,000 Protes- tant ministers in the Nation \"can fairly be called Communists or Communist sympa- thizers. Protestant ministers do not become Communists, but Communists do become Protestant ministers,\" he said. Responding to that accusation, a group of 137 southern California ministers published a statement assailing this blanket accusa- tion. Said the leading ministers of southern California: \"Our churches, schools and other tradi- tional institutions in the United States, as well as many of our beloved statesmen, edu- cators and clergymen, have been subjected to vicious attacks by blanket accusations and by unsupported charges. \"In the present world situation it is all too easy for persons of good will to be 'conned' into taking positions and supporting methods which are actually destructive of the valid ends they seek. \"Any group or individual, however well in- tentioned, that promotes a program of ha- tred, suspicion and distrust of our free Amer- ican institutions, and that indulges in the irresponsible labeling of people and institu- tions, is unwittingly serving the cause of those who would destroy these institutions.\" ROBERT WELCH: \"FOUNDER\" Robert Welch, an embittered candymaker of Belmont, Mass., and a former member of the board of directors of the National As- sociation of Manufacturers, founded the John Birch Society in December of 1958 with the publication of his \"Blue Book of the John Birch Society.\" This 179-page document blueprints the purposes and structure of the John Birch Society. All references following, unless otherwise noted, are to the Blue Book. The Blue Book is not to be confused with \"The Politician,\" which was a \"personal letter circulated to friends\" and is now withdrawn from circulation. \"The Politician\" contains Welch's most widely quoted statement: that President Ei- senhower is a \"dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.\" \"The John Birch Society will operate under completely authoritative control at all levels\" (p. 159). \"Those members who cease to feel the necessary degree of loyalty can either resign or will be put out before they build up any splintering following of their own inside the society\" (p. 161). \"We shall have shortcuts for eliminating (dif- ferences of opinion) without going through any congress of so-called democratic proc- esses\" (p. 162).

Birch Society's White Book now accuses the U.S. Chamber of Commerce of having been \"permeated with leftists\" because its course of practical politics indicates that \"liberals and internationalists\" have the best chance of winning elections. When such examples as Senator GOLDWATER and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are cast out of the conservative camp, what leader- ship remains? Only Mr. Welch. The Blue Book makes it clear that indi- vidual members of the Birch Society are to have no say in determining what commu- nism is, nor in who is a Communist. This will be done for them by Mr. Welch (e.g., pp. 160-162). Each day piles up additional evidence of Welch's belief that he is the only true mes- siah to rescue America from her enemies. It is a short step from this to the assertion that anybody who opposes Welch opposes America. Since these delusions are not the result of reason but spring instead from emotional needs, there is no rational stop- ping point for them. With the passage of time, we predict that the Birchers will be- come more splintered and the internecine warfare more intense as they interpret nor- mal differences of opinion between them- selves as treason and thence attack their opponent as not only wrong but immoral as well. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY Having thus divested myself of some per- sonal observations on he John Birch So- ciety, I must hasten to add that they are just that-personal observations. As At- torney General, I am the chief \"law officer of the State. It might therefore be assumed by some that I am officially passing on the merits or demerits of the John Birch So- ciety; that I am permitting or proscribing the propagation of their dogma; or that I am \"investigating\" them to determine whether they should be silenced or put in jail. Such an assumption betokens an unfamiliarity with the U.S. Constitution. The Birch Society has an equal right with the Prohibitionists, the Vegetarians, the Repub- licans, the Democrats, or, for that matter, with any American, acting singly or in a group to an expression of its views; and no official, no matter how highly placed, can say them nay. In America, preposterous- ness prevents the acceptance but not the expression of ideas. As attorney general, I have no greater right, but no less a right, to an expression of my personal opinion than any other Cali- fornian. This is the right of which I avail myself here. Accordingly, we have not con- ducted an investigation of the. John Birch Society, nor do we intend to-we are not \"Birch Watchers.\" All of the material in this report has either been in the public press or was voluntarily submitted by in- terested citizens. One effort by Department of Justice employees to interview Robert Welch and obtain his version of Birch So- ciety activities was met with a crude rebuff. This is in strange, contrast to subsequent demands by Congressman HIESTAND and other Birchers for \"an investigation.\" Should there be violations of California law, as for example the disruption of public meetings, I am confident that local law en- forcement will know how to handle the situation. These, too, are parlous times for America. There is no minimizing the threat to our free institutions. The cold war goes on and a hot war, hot to the temperatures of fusion and fission, menaces the future. Under such circumstances a patient, day-by-day analysis Some are concerned with the John Birch Society, many are concerned with organiza- tions generally thought to be closely allied with the Communist Party. These writers generally want to know whether the given organization is \"all right.\" They want the imprimatur of the attorney general to cer- tain themselves. While it might seem flattering to be the repository of such faith, it seems to me that these writers have failed to come to grips with their duty as citizens. That duty, as I conceive it, is for those persons to make the investigation for themselves, being more self- reliant and leaning less upon the label that somebody else affixes to a person or organ- ization. Accordingly, I generally advise such persons to look into the organization, listen to the ideas espoused, see the people es- pousing them, and ask questions. Then they can decide whether to join or oppose the organization or simply stay home and watch television. Such a course of action is, of course, grounded in a firm belief in the superiority of democracy. Understandably, neither Welch nor the Communists brook dissention or the discussion which its its progenitor. Just as understandably, supporters of de- mocracy welcome such discussion, for they know that a discussion which pits the philosophy of birchism or communism against that of democracy can only serve to strengthen democracy, and they know that strengthening democracy is the best weapon against communism. If the day ever dawns when democracy fears to take on all corners in the field of competing ideas, then democracy will already have died. Mr. Welch says: \"Democracy is merely a deceptive phrase, a weapon of demagoguery, and a perennial fraud\" (p 159). A century ago, a giant of an American, Walt Whitman, writing on the same subject, said: \"Democracy, while weapons were every- where aim'd at your breast, I saw you serenely give birth to immortal children, saw in dreams your dilating form, saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.\" Respectfully yours, STANLEY MOSK, Attorney General. By HOWARD H. JEWEL, Assistant Attorney General. CREATION OF U.S. DISARMAMENT AGENCY FOR WORLD PEACE AND SECURITY (Mr. BOLAND (at the request of Mr. STRATTON) was given permission to ex- tend his remarks at this point in the RECORD and include extraneous matter.) Mr. BOLAND. Mr. Speaker, today I am joining with 52 of my House col- leagues by filing a bill, recommended by President Kennedy, to establish a U.S. Disarmament Agency for World Peace and Security. It am proud to be a co- sponsor of this legislation which has bi- partisan support in both the House and Senate. Former President Eisenhower has also endorsed the idea of an inde- pendent Disarmament Agency with leg- islative authorization. The Senate For- eign Relations Committee today is hold- Congress and should be enacted before we adjourn. An ultimate goal of the United States is a world which is free from the scourge of war and the dangers and burdens of armaments; in which the use of force has been subordinated to the rule of law; and in which inter- national adjustments to a changing world are achieved peacefully. It is the purpose of this act, as outlined in section 2, to provide impetus toward this goal by creating a new agency of peace to deal with the problem of disarmament. President Kennedy, in his message to Congress proposing the creation of the Disarmament Agency, went to the heart of the issue in these words: Peace cannot be brought about by con- centrating solely on measures to control and eliminate weapons. It must also en- compass measures to sustain and strengthen institutions and the rule of law. A disarm- ament program must take into account the national security, our foreign policy, the re- lationships of this country to international peace-keeping agencies, including the United Nations, and our domestic, economic, and other policies. It should drive toward the creation of a peaceful world society in which disarmament, except for the forces needed to apply international sanctions, is the ac- cepted condition of international life. Mr. Speaker, I herewith submit an editorial in today's Washington Post and Times Herald entitled \"Proclaiming Our Hope,\" and columnist Roscoe Drum- mond's article in yesterday's Washing- ton Post and Times Herald entitled \"Dis- armament Agency Is Urgently Needed\": [From the Washington Post, Aug. 15, 1961] PROCLAIMING OUR HOPE Paradoxical as it may seem in view of Mr. Khrushchev's bluster, now is precisely the time when this country needs legislation establishing a U.S. Disarmament Agency. Fourteen Senators and 51 Representatives have sponsored a bill to this end in response to President Kennedy's request, and hearings in the Senate began yesterday. The measure ought to be approved promptly. The reason for speed is partly tactical. It is plain enough that this fall the Soviet challenge to the United States in the United Nations and elsewhere will be a total one, using every element of pressure and propa- ganda. One of the major efforts of Soviet propaganda has been to advertise general and complete disarmament-which has never been more than a slogan-and to depict the United States as a warmonger because it insists upon looking at details. As part of the plan to take the initiative, it is im- portant for this country to have a regularized agency to emphasize its own fond hope of graduated and controlled disarmament. More than this, as a matter of organiza- tion, disarmament planning has been spread thin over many agencies. Not until the last year has there been an effort to centralize policy responsibility and research studies. On more than one occasion in the past, con- tradictions and lack of coordination may have persuaded the Soviet Union that this country was not serious. A statutory agency will have the authority and prestige to obtain cooperation in determining what is feasible and what is not-and that is the only basis upon which disarmament can ever become more than a slogan. ing hearings on this legislation and I [From the Washington Post, Aug. 14, 1961] hope that the House Foreign Affairs DISARMAMENT AGENCY Is URGENTLY NEEDED Committee will schedule its hearings (By Roscoe Drummond) soon. Can President Kennedy expect to mobilize In my opinion this is one of the most congressional support for a vast, new, more important measures to come before this armaments program, and at the same time Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP64B00346R000200110008-4 Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP64B00346R000200110008-4 14798 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE mobilize congressional support for a vast, new, disarmament program? if the present need is for an all-out effort to build military strength, is this the time for an all-out effort to get everybody to agree to decrease military strength? Since the Soviets have rejected any in- spection they cannot veto and since we will not accept disarmament we cannot inspect, is this whole disarmament exercise so mean- ingless that we might as well put it in charge of an office boy? in other words, should the Senate Foreign Relations Committee lean back and yawn as it takes testimony this week on the pro- posed new U.S. Disarmament Agency for World Peace and Security-or should it sit bolt upright in the conviction that this is urgent, imperative, and significant business? I believe that creating the proposed Dis- armament Agency is urgent, imperative, and significant business. My conviction is that the Congress will be making; a grave mistake if it passes over this present opportunity to make the cause of world arms control-and disarmament- a major American concern with an agency operating at the highest level of Govern- ment, manned by the most competent peo- ple the President can command in order to devise the soundest conceivable program. There are solid reasons why, despite sur- face appearances to the contrary, the Dis- armament Agency is timely and needed: 1. pisarmament is a worldwide preoccupa- tion. It is a deep and abiding concern for millions and millions of people-and rightly. The prospects of disarmament may be more difficult and more remote than the most wishful think and less difficult and less remote than the most cynical think. It may be as remote and difficult as getting to outer space seemed a decade ago. 2. Discussion and debate on disarmament are not going to be adjourned because there is fighting in Laos, tension in Berlin, or con- flict in the Conga. There have been almost continuous disarmament negotiations with the Soviets for the past 4 years. The United States has not been well prepared for these negotiations. It's time we were. 3. Sometime there has got to be a will and a method to control the horrendous weapons. A balance of military strength is safer than an imbalance but an uncontrolled thermo- nuclear arms race could explode any time and something like 100 million casualties would be part of the consequence. 4. Of course we won't get disarmament until there is a change of attitude on the part of the Soviets on inspection and control. But regardless of the attitude of the Soviets- even if they only talk about it on Sunday and run away from it on Monday-the United States ought to be ready with the most prac- ticable, thoroughly considered, wisely de- vised, and workable disarmament program which our best brains can produce. Our position on this matter before the whole world ought to be positive, constructive, and compelling. John J. McCloy, the President's disarma- ment adviser and aL : of the Nation's ablest public servants, and William C. Foster, who will probably succeed him, are convinced that the proposed new Disarmament Agency is the best means of achieving all these pur- poses. OUTER MONGOLIA (Mr. KING of New York (at the re- quest of Mr. LATTA) was given permis- sion to extend his remarks at this point Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speak- er, I have, since the first of this year, supported any part of the administra- tion's program whenever I sincerely felt it would advance the cause of our in- dividual freedom. On the other hand I have opposed any policies, legislation and actions which in my honest judg- ment did not serve the best interests of the American people. In line with this policy, I wish to ap- plaud the administration's recent an- nouncement that it was suspending its negotiations to establish diplomatic re- lations with the central Asian Commu- n'ist State of Outer Mongolia. I, too, feel that in view of the present world situation and because Mongolia is a satellite of Soviet Russia, functioning-as an independent Communist country un- der the Soviet system, that it is definitely within the best interest of the United States to suspend any further consid- eration of this matter at this time. In support of the President's recent announcement, I am today introducing a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that diplomatic recognition should not be extended to the Mongolian People's Republic.

REUSS OF WISCONSIN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, June 13, 1961 Mr. REUSS. Mr. Speaker, it is en- couraging to see the rising tide of pub- lic opinion against the John Birch So- ciety. Recently the Wisconsin State Medical Society has added its voice to those warning against this extremist or- ganization. In an editorial in the June issue of the Wisconsin Medical Journal they urge doctors to diagnose political evil with the same care used for physical ills. The full text of the editorial follows: The crackpot, the crank and the common, garden-variety screwball have always been characteristic of our democracy. Viewed as a fragment of the lunatic fringe, the John Birch Society may seem more ridiculous than worthy of concern. But what this group and its wealthy leader and founder, Robert Welch, stand for will produce a sick sensa- tion in the stomach of every patriotic Ameri- can. ' The information that prominent medical men in several communities have associated themselves with the John Birch Society causes dismay and consternation among doc- tors of sense and perception. The John Birch Society purports to fight communism. To do this it organizes se- cret and semi-secret groups who look around their own communities for Communists to expose. The society's Blue Book urges mean and dirty techniques, underground infiltra- tion, front organizations, and, in fact, all the methods the Communists themselves use. Among the Americans whom Robert Welch, B. retired candy manufacturer, thinks might 1;e members of the Communist underground were President Eisenhower, Dr. Milton Eisen- hower, the late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, Allen Dulles, now head of the Central Intelligence Agency. The John Birch Society is, in its structure, 'frankly authoritarian. It insists that there be no accounting of the funds contributed to it \"for reasons you will understand.\" It regards democracy as a weapon of demo- goguery and a perennial fraud. Naturally, this kind of a setup has at- tracted such characters as J. B. Matthews, one-time supersleuth for the late Senator Jpseph B. McCarthy, who got fired from his job for picking on American clergymen as supporters of the Communist apparatus.

Over the years, these or- ganizations have done their job well-far better than local loud-mouths who looked for Communist propaganda in Girl Scout handbooks and found enemy agents where none existed. This country does not need private vigi- lante groups to protect our institutions. We don't need the John Birch Society and its conspiratorial methods. Our country is strong in its faith, firm in its ideals, and steadfast in its devotion to the principles which the John Birch Society abhors. It is to be hoped that the doctors who have allowed their names to Ape used by the John Birch Society are Innocent victims of misinformation. , Let them serve as ex- amples for the rest of us who love our coun- try and cherish democracy.

For example, it was a very live issue in last year's presidential campaign, and the stand President Kennedy took probably did more for his election than any other one issue upon which he took a stand. Often I am asked: Why all the fuss about this issue? Shouldn't everybody receive their fair share of the tax dollars? Often the issue has been presented as one of in- justice. Cardinal Spellman has done a good job of this through the 'picture that he persists in painting of the poor little Cath- olic boy, standing in the rain getting wet, while the public school bus passes him by, refusing to pick him up and drop him off at the corner near his church's school. This illustration may thump heartstrings, but it evades the basic issue involved. The issue is basically and fundamentally a church- state one. You see, one of the main reasons why many of our forefathers came to this coun- try in the first place is because they lived under oppression by the church. Massachu- setts, for example, was colonized by sepa- ratists who had broken away from the Church of England and suffered persecution at the hands of King James I. The Puritans were another group that left England for the same reason and settled in various parts of New England.

Religious freedom for the Quakers figured in the founding of our own State of Penn- sylvania by William Penn. The founding of Georgia by James Oglethorpe is another example of a colony brought into being for religious freedom. Either directly or indi- rectly religion played an important part in the colonizing of virtually every part of the New World. Because many of our forefathers experi- enced religious persecution in England and on the Continent from the state churches the very first amendment to the Constitution of the newly formed Thirteen Colonies was made to read: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" It is the very first sentence of the amend- ment to the Constitution that bears on the issue'being considered this morning. \"Con- gress shall make no law respecting an estab- lishment of religion * * ?.\" Any church has a perfect right to pro- mote marriage between church and state.

June 22 The Roman Catholic Church is not alone in this belief. All of the Eastern Orthodox Churches have practiced this for centuries. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches are not particularly known separate and apart from their state relationships. They are known as the Greek Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, and so on. In the. Scandinavian countries the same thing is true of Lutheranism. For example, the Lutheran Church is the state church in Norway, in. Sweden, in Denmark, and in Finland. In England, the Church of Eng- land has held a close tie with gpvernment, being the state church. While various Christian groups have em- braced the idea of marriage between church and state, the Roman Catholic Church has been the most vigorous expon- ent of the Idea down throughout the cen- turies. In almost every country where the majority of the population are members of the Roman Catholic Church, that church holds the position of being the state church. This is Roman Catholic doctrine. Since the time of St. Augustine in the fifth cen- tury, and his \"City of God,\" a writing which pictures Christian society synonymous with the organized church, Roman Catholic doc- trine has maintained that \"The Earthly City\" has no right to exist unless it is definitely subordinate to the \"City of God.\" Regardless of what many of our Roman Catholic brethren may say about it never happening in the United States, history has proven over and over again that whenever the majority of the population becomes Roman Catholic that church becomes the state church. Whenever this issue is raised in this coun- try we are. always accused by the Roman Catholic hierarchy as being either intolerant or bigoted. Harold Bosley tells the story of two brothers who would fight among themselves from time to time. One day they were fighting underneath the kitchen win- dow. Hearing the conflict, the mother called to the older boy, \"Tommy, what's the mat- ter?\" Tommy replied, \"Make Johnny stop fighting.\" Tearfully Johnny replied, \"I'm not fighting, Mommy, I'm just fighting back.\" In the present conflict we are just fighting back. We are trying to preserve a basic principle upon which our country was es- tablished and upon which we believe has made our country great, and it is this prin- ciple of separation between church and state. Please do not misunderstand me, the Roman Catholic Church has a perfect right to believe that the state should be the arm of the church. Furthermore, it is that church's privilege to do all within its power through nonviolent persuasion to accom- plish that end. But by the same right we have the privilege to work for the mainte- nance of separation between church and state. To this end many of us within the Protestant Church intend to work toward and try to preserve. was primarily for religious instruction-in other words, to propagate the faith. During the Dark Ages, the only formal education given ` any serious attention was that designed for the priesthood. As the enlightenment dawned in the 16th and 17th centuries, however, there developed a real need for more formal education. The New World, with it's courage and desire to ven- ture forth into the unknown, took seriously the great dreams of Jean Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and established free, public and compulsory education for all. Our forefathers had experienced the pri- vate and parochial approach to education in the countries from which they came, and at the outset they committed themselves not to allow this approach to education to take charge here. With great courage, and with much opposition, they established the system of education we presently enjoy in this country. My friends,, to allow any other system of education to have equal status is to destroy that system of education which has made our country great. In the June Issue of Church and State a report is given as to what has happened in a number of countries where tax money has gone for the support of both public and private schools. In the Netherlands, for example, it is reported that \"public support for sectarian and private schools has re- duced the public schools to a minority level. Public funds pay all the costs (for all the various school systems). * * In primary grades, Catholics enroll 43 percent of the pupils, Protestants 27 percent, and public schools have 28 percent. The remaining 2 percent are in nonsectarian private schools.\" You see, the American way of life has never been a sectarian approach. There has nearly always seen freedom for the individ- ual to worship God as he sees fit in the church or synagogue of his choice, to be- lieve what he likes, and through the demo- cratic way to integrate the best of all the various cultures, points of view, ways of doing things, into the American way of life. One leading Protestant church leader de- clares, \"Once Federal funds go to parochial schools, the face of America will be quickly changed. There will soon be sectarian candi- dates and parties at State and local levels. Within a century the American people will be more divided than by the present con- fl9.ct over the race issue.\" There are many Protestant educators who are warning that if Federal aid to private may prefer private playgrounds to the com- munity's recreation facilities but I: am not discriminated against if community tax funds are not available to my club. I may prefer private schools for my children but neither they nor I am discriminated against. because these schools are not supported from. public funds. By no legitimate stretch of meaning can discrimination be charged.\" It was certainly refreshing to see the Supreme Court refuse to review a decision handed down by the Vermont State Supreme Court, holding that it is unconstitutional for a school district to pay tuition for stu- dents to attend private religious schools even when the school district does not main- tain a high school of its own and pays tui- tion for other students to attend nearby ipublic high schools. This decision, how- ever, does not settle the matter. 'While the Supreme Court's refusal to review the case suggests that it believes public funds given to parochial schools unconstitutional, the Court has not said so in, a clear-cut decision. And until such time as the Supreme Court hands down such a derision the battle will contilnre. Furthermore, there is always the possibility that the first amendment to the Constitution may be changed as was true in 1933 when the 18th amendment was re- pealed. Urtfortunately this fight over the separa- tion of church and state is going to go on; and it is going to go an just as long as any religious group, whether it be Roman Catho- lic cr Protestant, insists that its group re- ceive public funds to support its, program. You who know me well know that I am not anti-Catholic. I certainly trust that wha-3 1: have been saying this morning will not be interpreted as such. As you know I am ;lust; as outspoken in my criticism of policies related to my own brotherhood as I ant toward those of others. My reasoning may be right, or it may be wrong, but God is my judge. And so long as I feel that I am being, led by God's spirit to speak on certain basic issues confronting His Church and His world, I intend to speak. On this issue of separation of church and state, I believe the Bible as some clear-cut things to say. To this point I intend to speak in Sep;ernber. I urge you to give serious thought to this matter of Federal aid. to private and paro- chie,l schools. Your church board did last month and communicated its action to Sen- atOl'S JOSEPH CLARK and HUGH SCOTT and Representative GEORGE: GOODLING. You can do the same, especially to GEORGE; GOODLING, who is the Representative for Cumberland and York Counties, and JOHN C. KUNKEL, who is the Representative for Dauphin and. Perry Counties, as this issue will reach a crisis beginning ,rune 20, when House leaders call up the public school bill for floor action. To the Galatians, and this is my text for today, the Aspostle Paul wrote: \"For freedom Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.\" and parochial schools becomes a reality on a large scale, virtually every Protestant build- ing of any size in the United States will become the nucleus of a Protestant Christian Day School. Instead of uniting our country this will further divide it. All of us know we are divided enough at the present time. As I have reiterated throughout the ser- mon this morning, the Roman Catholic Church has a perfect right to maintain it's parochial school system, but let it be main- tained at it's own expense, not at the ex- pense of the American people. In his answer to the editorial which ap- peered in Life magazine several weeks ago-- an editorial charging that Roman Catholics are being discriminated against with the present financial structure in -education- Henry P. Van Dusen, president of Union Theological Seminary, New York City, wrote: \"Discrimination occurs only where equal opportunities are not offered to all on equal terms, as in racial segregation in a school system. Equal opportunity for all on equal terms is precisely what public schools pro- vide and what Federal aid. to public educa- tion would strengthen. I may prefer private medical attendance and service to the city's hospitals but I am not discriminated against. If tax funds are . not available to my doctor or hospital. I You may be asking at this point, \"How does all of this that I have said apply to the- public school question?\" Few people realize that the public school system is uniquely American. Our country was the first to provide equal opportunity for edu- cation to all, regardless of race, color, or creed. Granted, this has not been fully realized, 'but we were the first to at least make the big step in that direction. You see, prior to the development of the public school system, education was 'con- sidered a luxury and provided for only a few. If you read back into the pages of history, you will discover that religious groups were the first to initiate education. The education that they initiated, however, Hon. George Bender SPEECH or HON.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE June 13 consideration of Calendar No. 337, H.R. 3572. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be stated by title for the informa- tion of the Senate. The LEGISLATIVE CLERx. A bill (H.R.- 3572) to place in trust status certain lands on the Crow Creek Indian Reser- vation in South Dakota. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to; and'the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the Com- mitteess on Interior and Insular Affairs with an amendment on page 2, after line 5, to insert a new section, as follows: SEC. 2. It is the policy of Congress that the value of all Federal property heretofore or hereafter given to an Indian tribe, band, or group, including the property granted by this Act, shall be considered by the Indian Claims Commission for setoff purposes in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the Indian Claims Commission Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1050). In order to incorporate that policy in the Indian Claims Commission Act, the third paragraph of section 2 of said Act is amended by de- leting the words \"the Commission may also inquire into and consider all money or prop- erty given to our funds expended gratui- tously for the benefit of the claimant\" and by inserting in lieu thereof the words \"the Commission shall also inquire into and con- sider all money or property given to or funds expended gratuitously for the benefit of the claimant prior to the Commission's award\". The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amend- ment. The amendment was agreed to. The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time. The bill wash read the third time and passed. The title was amended, so as to read: \"An Act to place in trust status certain lands on the Crow Creek Indian Reser- vation in South Dakota, and for other purposes.\" Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask that a portion of the report on the bill be printed in the RECORD. There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: PURPOSE The purpose of H.R. 3572 is to place in trust status 1,276.25 acres of federally owned lands on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The committee amend- ment, set forth in section 2, provides that the Indian Claims Commission shall deter- mine whether the value of these lands, and other lands donated to other tribes, should be an offset against any claim against the United States allowed by the Commission in favor of the tribe that has been the bene- ficiary of such a gift. NEED The land was purchased in 1944 for $5,760 with Federal funds from an account called \"Indian money, proceeds of labor.\" The money was accumulated from the cattle- raising activities at the Crow Creek Indian school which closed in 1954. The General Services Administration will dispose of the acreage if it Is not donated to the tribe. GSA has received a firm bid which is being held in abeyance pending early congressional approval of this bill. The tribe plans to lease the land for grazing purposes. This will produce an income of about $1,200 a year for the tribe. The tribe will lose much of its present land in connection with the construction of Big Bend Dam on the Mis- souri River, and the lands donated by this act will provide some homesites for dislo- cated Indians. COST Enactment of the bill will require no ap- propriations, but will result in the loss of the amount of the bid ($29,363) which has been received by the General Services Ad= ministration. AMENDMENTS As passed by the House, H.R. 3572 did not specify how this gift of land would be treated in connection with the claim of the Crow Tribe now before the Indian Claims Commis- sion. A number of the bills donating surplus Federal lands to Indian tribes which have come before the committee contain language specifying how gifts of lands shall be con- sidered in relation to such tribal claims. In some cases the lands are simply eliminated from the suits. In other instances there is a provision for a setoff against any claim recovered by the tribe of the present market value of the land. In other instances no mention is made of Whether a setoff shall apply. Also, there is uncertainty whether gifts of land made subsequent to the cutoff date for filing claims (August 13, 1951) should be considered as offsets. In an effort to arrive at uniformity in this regard the committee has reported several such bills, amended, to provide for setoffs. However, in order to preclude the need for such. amendments, and to establish a policy that all gifts of land are considered, the committee recommends general language directing the Indian Claims Commission to determine, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of the 1946 Indian Claims Com- mission Act, the extent to which the value of the property given to the Indians should or should not be set off against any claim against the United States determined by the Commission. This directive applies not only to the land involved in H.R. 3572 but to all gifts of Federal property to an Indian tribe. It is the committee's belief that the Indian Claims Commission is In the best position to examine all of the factors surrounding the claims of the tribes and to decide on the merits whether any setoff' should be made against any judgment awarded the tribes. Moreover, the Claims Commission Act gives the ? Commission authority to de- termine setoffs generally, after examining all of the equities involved, and it seems ap- propriate to leave that function with the Commission, with the clarifying language of the committee amendment, rather than for Congress to attempt to determine the equi- ties. DEPARTMENTAL REPORT The favorable report from the Secretary of the Interior dated March 10, 1961, follows: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY, Washington, D.C. March 10, 1961. Hon. WAYNE N. ASPINALL, Chairman, Committee on Interior and In- sular Affairs, house o/ Representatives, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. ASPXNALL: Your committee has requested a report on H.R. 3572, a bill to place in trust status certain lands on the Crow Creek Indian Reservation in South Dakota. We recommend that the bill be enacted. The bill donates to the Crow Tribe and places in a trust status approximately 1,276.25 acres of federally owned land. The land was purchased by the Federal Government with funds from an account called \"Indian money, proceeds of labor.\" These are Federal funds (not Indian) de- rived from Federal operations on Indian res- ervations which are not required to be dis- posed of in some other manner. The money in this account may be expended by the Secretary under an indefinite and continu- ing appropriation for the benefit of the In- dians, the agency, or the Indian school on whose behalf the money is collected (25 U.S.C. 155). The money is accumulated from such activities as the operation of a beef or dairy herd in connection with an Indian school. The purchase was made in 1944 and the purchase price was $5,760. There are no improvements on the land. The land was purchased for use in con- nection with the Crow Creek school, which was an agricultural high school specializing in beef cattle production. The school was closed in 1954, and in 1957 the land was declared to the General Services Adminis- tration as Excess to the needs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks applied to the General Services Administration on June 16, 1958, for a transfer of the land to it under the act of May 19, 1948 (62 Stat. 240). That act authorizes the transfer if the property is found to be chiefly valuable for wildlife conservation purposes (other than conser- vation of migratory birds). The State's application was denied by the General Serv- ices Administration on the ground that the land is not chiefly valuable for wildlife con- servation purposes. The General Services Administration later offered the land for sale on the open market as surplus property, and we are informed that it has received a bid of $29,363 which is limited to 60 days from January 24, 1961. The land is located near Fort Thompson, Buffalo County; S. Dak., within the exterior boundaries of the Crow Creek Reservation. The tracts are contiguous to each other (but not in a solid block) and are, surrounded by allotted land. The tribe wants the land to lease for grazing purposes. Anticipated rentals are estimated to be about $1,200 per year. The land may also provide a limited number of homesites for some of the Indians who have been forced to move from the taking area of the Big Bend Dam. We believe that, the land should be given to the Indian tribe for grazing and homesite use, rather than sold as surplus property. The Bureau of the Budget has advised that there is no objection to the presenta- tion of this report from the standpoint of the administration's program. Sincerely yours, JOHN A. CARVER, Jr., Assistant Secretary pf tk Interior. JOHN BIRCH VOCIL-IY Mr. McGEE. Madam President, I ould like to call to the attention of the Senate an interesting book review which appeared in the May 20, 1961, issue of the New Yorker magazine. The title of the review is \"The Candy Kid.\" It attempts to evaluate the so-called blue book of the John Birch Society. Because of the candidness of the re- view, because of the broad perspective in which the blue book is assessed, I ask unanimous consent that the review be included in its entirety in the RECORD at this point. There being no objection, the book re- view was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: THE CANDY Km (By A. J. Liebling) In 1922, when I was 18 and it was new, I read James Elroy Flecker's play about Has- san, the confectioner of Baghdad, and It be- came one of my clandestine addictions, like Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP64B00346R000200110008-4 Approved For Release 2003/10/10 : CIA-RDP64B00346R000200110008-4 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE creased production 31 percent above pre- war. This increase was stimulated by high support prices and a multitude of subsidies as well as by technological progress. Im- port restrictions originally imposed for bal- ance-of-payment reasons have been con- tinued for protective purposes. State trad- ing practices, mixing regulations, skim- mings, and a variety of other devices have also been used to protect European farm pro- duction and oilseed processors. Compared With the present agricultural and trade policies of the major European Economic Community countries, the Com- mission proposals for a common agricul- tural policy have certain good features. On the other hand, the proposals would, as a means of supplementing Internal price support programs, continue certain protec- tive devices now employed by European Eco- nomic Community countries and in some cases extend their use to all six countries. Is it not time that U.S. soybean oil, cotton- seed oil, and other oils and fats enter West- ern European markets under freely competi- tive conditions? We ask no special favors for oilseed products except that they enter under the same conditions as the raw mate- rial. We are willing to compete on equal terms. As you know we are not subsidized. We in the United States prefer processing be determined by economics and not by Gov- ernment intervention. European crushers have completely free access'to our raw mate- rials-we should have no duties on our oil to Europe. Economics of freight alone are sufficient to favor raw material so long as the destination market exists for both oil and meal. What we would like is true reciprocity with the Western European nations. Failure to provide equal opportunity for these oil imports will fan the flames of protectionism In the United States, already concerned with balance-of-payment prob- lems. This is not helpful. Special ad- vantage does not sow the seeds of brother- hood. You can help by urging your governments to move in the direction of greater liberali- zation for mutually beneficial trade. In ad- dition, the special export programs help to support this effort of using food for peace. A small percentage of the foreign currencies being generated under our Public Law 480, title 1 sales are being used in market promotion projects in many of the economically developed countries. All sellers benefit from these market promotion proj- ects. In our field, the Soybean Council of Amer- ica, jointly financed by the American Soy- bean Processors and counterpart Public Law 480 funds, carries on promotional activities in many parts of the world. Promotional activities, I repeat, benefit all producers and processors of oil seeds. Special Government export activities in- clude Public Law 480 sales for foreign cur- rencies, donations, and barter, as well as Mu- tual Security Act economic aid and sales for foreign currencies. About 30 percent of total U.S. agricultural exports are moved under the special programs. These constitute the foundation of the food-for-peace program. Public Law 4.80 sales for foreign currencies constitute the largest single segment of the special programs. By authorizing such sales of U.S. farm products to countries lacking foreign currencies, Public Law 480 has widened farm market outlets and has increased availability of food and fiber to our friends abroad. The Mutual Security Act, like Public Law 480, also authorizes sales for foreign cur- rencies. From 1954 through 1959 the United States sold about $1.7 billion worth of food, feed, and Aber at market value under the Mutual Security Act. These sales generate hard currency mar- kets, too. Witness Spain, now a really large buyer of soybean oil for dollars. Donations of emergency relief supplies are made to help friends abroad when disaster strikes. In the fiscal year 1960 food was pro- vided for victims of natural disasters in 11 countries. For example, we fed refu- gees in. Hong Kong and the Middle East. We helped twphoon victims in the Ryukyu Is- lands and Japan, and earthquake victims in Chile and Morocco. We supplied food for charitable institutions and school lunch pro- grams. The U.S. Government also works voluntary organizations in developing people-to-people food donation programs. These include such agencies as CARE, Catholic Relief Services, Church World Service, Lutheran World Re- lief, and the American Jewish Joint Distribu- tion Committee. Also participating are the international organizations UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Administration) and UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund). Seventy-five million American people support this pro- gram through their gifts, their work, and their membership in the voluntary agencies. In the meantime, other free world nations are rendering vital aid to foreign people In distress. Some of this -aid is extended on a country-to-country basis, some through and in consultation with international organi- zations. In the latter category is the Wheat Utiliza- tion Committee, on which are represented the major wheat-exporting countries- Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, and the United States. This Committee, with the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization as an adviser-observer, is in- vestigating the possibility of increasing and making more effective coordinated use of wheat to promote economic development, improve nutritional standards, and expand world commercial trade in wheat. With the food-for-peace program we are associating the need for food abroad with our tremendous agricultural technological capability. In terms of feeding hungry people, results have been highly gratifying. 1. Nutritional levels in the underde- veloped parts of the world have gone up. 2. Agriculture generally has kept abreast of or ahead of population increase in the underdeveloped areas. But we must keep In mind that even with the sharp advances In agricultural tech- nology, its growth must continue at, an in- creasing rate because of the treendous increase expected in population in the years ahead and the growing pressures to raise living standards. The food-for-peace program is promoting economic growth in the newly developing countries. This, too, eventually will mean enlarged, permanent markets. Economic development stimulates sales. Many coun- tries, graduated from sales for foreign cur- rencies to sales for dollars after their war- disrupted economies had been rebuilt. Today, Public Law 480 foreign currencies are contributing to economic development in Asia, the Middle East, southern Europe, and Latin America. Here are a few samples: India: Power projects, Irrigation facilities, schools. Indonesia: Rehabilitation of railways, highways, harbors, airports. Israel: Agricultural development, electric power facilities, transportation. Greece: Roads and bridges, electric power, agricultural development, vocational educa- tion. Brazil: Grain elevators, transportation, electric power. Economic development, in addition to cre- ating permanent markets is furthering the 9513 general foreign policy aims of the United States a:a.d the free world. One of the key- stones cif foreign policy is a strong free world-strong enough to stand against ag- gression and subversion. Increased economic well-being will go far in achievin@; that strength. Following negotiation of the United States-Indian wheat-rice agreement, which was signed on March 4, 1960, the Indian Express editorialized, \"The Elsenhower-Patil food agreement stands out as an act Of good faith in human relations. It is of high ma- terial value enhanced by the terms and the timing. It is of far greater import in terms of the spirit: of faith in human idea'.s and in the striving to retain them.\" The image that the United States is build- ing among the hungry peoples of the world is tangible. It cannot be blotted out with propaganda. By using food as a major in- strument of foreign policy we are doing; what the Communists would like to do but can't. In the rivalry between. East and West, agriculture is one area of many in which we have clearly and without- question dem- onstrated superiority. The food-for-peace program is expanding the opportunity to make that agricultural superiority felt. The food-for-peace program is not with- out its hazards. 1. We must not hurt the economies of other agricultural exporting countries by usurping their markets. 2. We must beware of making the develop- ing countries dependent upon us, indefi- nitely, with their growing populations, for our continuing help. 3. We must avoid flooding the recipient countries with our food, depressing their farm prices and hurting their agriculture. 4. We must not give away, barter, or sell for foreign currency,"
