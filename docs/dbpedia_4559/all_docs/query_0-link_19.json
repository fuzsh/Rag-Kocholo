The Enlightenment in general followed Descartes in categorizing myths among the \"prejudices\" that had to be swept away in order to make room for the methodical development and application of scientific knowledge. Romanticism, particularly in Germany, reacted against this jettisoning of tradition, and against the unsatisfying incompleteness and tentativeness of science, by calling either for a \"new mythology\" or (more often) for a return to our old, inherited myths. An appreciation and employment of mythical themes, which could (with some effort) be interpreted as indicating the possible return of an encompassing mythical world view, had in fact been evident even in the midst of the ''scientific revolution\" of the seventeenth centurywitness writers like Racine and Miltonand this has continued right into the twentieth century, with Joyce, Valéry, Kafka, Thomas Mann, and many others. But theorists are still not sure what to make of it. Our usual interpretations of science, whether rationalist, empiricist, positivist, or whatever, are all still very much in the Enlightenment tradition, and imply a role for myth in the modern age which is restricted exclusively to the aesthetic imagi\n\nPage viii\n\nnation and is assumed to have no bearing on the preeminent role of scientific rationality in our serious, practical lives. On the other hand, those who concern themselves extensively with myth, such as literary scholars, anthropologists, and psychologists, often tend toward the other, Romantic extremeinterpreting myth's modern survival as evidence of its being, in one way or another, inherent in human nature and even, given its seemingly greater antiquity and ubiquity, of its being more fundamental to human nature than our (\"surface\") rationality. Blumenberg undertakes precisely to overcome this antithesis, to extract the truth from the Enlightenment and from Romanticism by showing that scientific rationality and ongoing \"work\" on our inherited myths are not only not incompatible but are both indispensable aspects of the comprehensive effort that makes human existence possible. 2 A Non-Romantic Alternative to the Enlightenment's Conception of the Relation between Rationality and Myth: The Overcoming of the Absolutism of Reality The last German philosopher to address these questions at length was Ernst Cassirer. b Cassirer was a leading heir of Kant, whose philosophy can be seen as the culmination (in the realm of theory) of the Enlightenment; but Cassirer's wide reading in the Romantic writers and in ethnology, his reading of Freud, and finally his agonizing observation of the role played by \"myths\" (of the \"Führer\" and the \"master race,'' for example) in Nazism led him to treat the subject more seriously and more systematically than any philosopher had done before him. With his theory of \"symbolic forms,\" he tried to do justice to myth's internal coherence and power by giving it a status equal to that of knowledge, language, art, and religion, as a fundamental human activity and construction that could not be dismissed (in the eighteenth-century manner) as mere fable, mental cobwebs, or \"prejudice.\" While Blumenberg honors Cassirer's work on this problem (as on others),c he has one fundamental criticism of Cassirer's theory: That he did not manage to overcome the unstated assumption that once science emerges, myth, despite its supposedly autonomous dignity as a \"symbolic form,\" is fundamentally obsolete; that once the step \"from mythos to logos\" has been taken, it can only be perverse to, as it were, turn back. If the relation of myth to science is conceived in this\n\nPage ix\n\nwayas it probably is by most of us who are neither programmatic Romantics nor specialized students of myththen (a) the \"primitive\" people for whom myth is still a living reality have to be seen as being largely, if not entirely, deprived of an essential symbolic form (logos, or science), one that is preferable to the distinctive one that they do enjoy; (b) the mythical patterns that Freud discovered in the unconscious are, at most, relics of a (personal and perhaps historical) childhood that we have left behind us; (c) the role of myth in modern literature is, at most, that of an object of aesthetic experience, having no bearing on the practical business of life; and (d) Nazism's relation to myth is that of an incomprehensible reversion, the reversion before which Cassirer, in The Myth of the State, stood aghast. Is this the only rational way to interpret these phenomena? Is there any alternative to Cassirer's Enlightenment schema of the replacement of myth by science, other than a Romantic synthesis of the two, which would amount to a denial of the autonomy of science as a \"symbolic form\" (thus casting doubt on the Romantics' commitment to rationality)? Blumenberg proposes that instead of always interpreting myth in terms of what it (supposedly) came beforeits terminus ad quem, science, the arrival of which appears to make it obsoletewe should try interpreting it in terms of its terminus a quo, its point of departure. That point of departure is the problem that myth seeks to solve, which is the source of its real (and lasting) importance, regardless of what (if anything) comes 'after' it.* What is that problem? Blumenberg calls it the \"absolutism of reality.\" This phrase designates a situation in which \"man comes close to not having control of the conditions of his existence and, what is more important, believes that he simply lacks control of them.\" d This is to be understood as a \"limit concept,'' which, while it may never have been fully realized, is a necessary extrapolation, a \"limiting case\" that makes sense of what we do observe in myth and in the rest of human history. In particular, it is consistent, Blumenberg says, with current theories of the origin of manof what happened when our ancestors adopted an upright, bipedal posture; were displaced from the sheltering * Throughout this book, single quotation marks have been used exclusively as 'scare quotes,' to draw attention to special uses of terms or to emphasize (as in this case) the problematic status, in the discussion, of the concepts referred to by the words in question. The only exception to this rule is a quotation within a quotation (i.e., within a set of double quotes), which requires single\n\nquotation marks for contrast.\n\nPage x\n\nforest into the open savanna; and found that their instincts did not tell them how to cope with this new situation. Blumenberg argues that the dramatically enlarged horizon of what they could perceive (and within which they could be perceived) would be, for them, a situation of great ambiguity, one in which some of their central instinctssuch as fleeing from immediate danger, an instinct that had served to clarify many situations for them in the forestwould be of little help. Our ancestors \"came close to not having control of the conditions of their existence\" because they had becomeas we remaina species without a clearly defined biological niche. If this situation was not dealt with in some radically new waythat is, if the \"limiting case\" of the absolutism of reality was realized (or if we thought it was realized) for any length of timeit would produce the mental state that Blumenberg calls Angst, which is normally translated as ''anxiety\" but would be better rendered by the psychiatrist's paraphrase, \"intense fear or dread lacking an unambiguous cause or a specific threat\"; and the resulting behavior would be panic, paralysis, or both. Thus the \"absolutism of reality\" is a fundamental threat, implicit in our biological nature and its relation to our natural environment, to our capacity for survival. Our response to this challenge has been the development of cultureof, essentially, the same \"symbolic forms\" that Cassirer described. But where Cassirer saw those \"symbolic forms\" as a spontaneous expression of man's (apparently \"given,\" unproblematic) \"nature\" as the \"animal symbolicum,\" Blumenberg sees them as a solution to a problem that is inherent in man's biological nature. Man, as it were, makes himself an animal symbolicum in order to make up for his lack of biologically adaptive instincts: his \"nature\" (in Cassirer's sense) is in fact his solution to the life-threatening problem posed for him by his biological nature. What precisely is the role of myth in relation to this problem? It is to overcome (or perhaps to forestall) the Angst that the problem produces (or could produce), by \"rationalizing\" it into plain fear of specific, named agencies, more or less personalized powers, whom we can address and (to that extent) deal with. It is important that these powers, which are often theriomorphic in the early stages, are plural, so that each has only a limited domainthere is a \"separation of powers\" among them, so that none of them can present the kind of allencompassing threat that Angst portends. The other important fact\n\nPage xi\n\nis that they were more horrible, and less predictable, \"in the beginning.\" The succession of generations on OlympusZeus the lawgiver supplanting the lawless Titans, and so onillustrates this fact (as do the accomplishments of heroes like Perseus and Hercules). But, again, the continuing polytheistic \"separation of powers\" prevents the new \"supreme god'' from causing a relapse into Angst. \"The consolidation of the state that the world has arrived at, as a 'cosmos,' and the restriction of every absolutism that arises in this process are interwoven as anti-thetical motives in myth. . . . Zeus had not been able to conquer without assistance either the Titans or the giants whose bodies were partly snakes; and every assistance means a sort of constitutionalization of his power.\" e Blumenberg devotes several chapters to an examination of the ways in which myth serves to reduce the absolutism of reality, creating a \"breathing space\" in which men can also deal with the practical side of the challenge of survival by (among other things) cultivating the rational comprehension and control of specific natural phenomenain which we have made so much progress in the last few centuries. But such comprehension and control cannot take the place ofcannot perform the function ofthe old stories. Knowledge is always only partial; the absolutism of reality was (or is, or would be) total, and requires something other than knowledge alone to overcome it, to put it behind us. And if someone were to say that it is \"no longer a problem\" for usthat is, that our lack of a biological niche, our deficit of instinct, is no longer a problem for us (so that we no longer have any need of myth) this would amount to the assertion that we are definitively free of our biological origins, which is a proposition that we can hardly expect to be able to demonstrate. This account of the function of myth is not only persuasive in itself, as Blumenberg expounds and illustrates it, but also has the crucial advantage over the schema of the step forward \"from mythos to logos\" that it does not assume the operation of an overall goal in the history of human consciousnessthe end state of the scientific rationality that we now enjoy. Instead of such a teleology, which has only escaped the criticism of the modern empiricist and positivist critics of teleology (as it escapes Cassirer's) because it is buried so deeply in their own thinking, Blumenberg proposes an interpretation of human \"symbolic forms\" as factors that all contribute, simultaneously, to the single comprehensive endeavor of making human existence possible by\n\nPage xii\n\novercoming the problem of our biological nonadaption, our constitutional deficit of instinct. The only goal that is operative in this process is that of overcoming the immediate, all-encompassing problemand that is an endeavor to which man addresses himself in every possible way at once. In addition to this 'methodological' advantage, Blumenberg's account yields a more balanced view of each of the specific problem areasnamely, \"primitive\" cultures, psychoanalysis, literature, and Nazismthat I listed above in summarizing Cassirer. (a) In connection with the relation between \"primitive\" and modern cultures, it corrects the ethnocentric implication of the \"from mythos to logos'' schema that there was a stage in the development of human consciousness in which rationality was largely absent (a \"prelogical mentality,\" as Lucien Lévy-Bruhl called it). Rationality and myth are both indispensable to human survival, from the start. (Presumably this need not prevent the balance between our respective needs for them from shifting, to the extent that, through experience and knowledge, we achieve a command of reality that makes its possible \"absolutism\" a less pressing concern. On the other hand, it is also possible that experience of inherent limits to such a command could intensify the relevance of Angst once more.) (b) As in the history of the species, so also in the development of individuals there is probably no point of demarcation at which rationality takes over (or should take over) completely from more 'childish,' 'prerational' modes of thought involving, for example, fantasy. \"Flight behind an image\"a phrase used by Goethe to describe one of his own characteristic procedures, which Blumenberg examines in detail in part IV of this bookmay be a necessary recourse at any age in the face of issues that rationality cannot yet, or perhaps can never, handle. An example of the latter may be the issue of selfknowledge and identity, in which the element ofirreducibly \"brute\"inheritance may be, for the individual, an \"absolute reality\" in the sense that a conceptual grasp of it does not even potentially enable him to change it. In this case, it may be that the quasi-mythical patterns that Freud found in dreams and elsewhere can partake of the same functional legitimacy as Goethe's \"images,\" though this does not entail regarding them as eternal, cosmic 'givens' in the manner of, for example, Jung. Nor does it mean that the functioning of the images must be (or even can be) naive and unreflected. As Blumenberg says, we only know myth in and through our \"work on\" itan expression\n\nPage xiii\n\nthat intentionally avoids distinguishing between imaginative and conceptualanalytical \"work.\" Blumenberg argues that right from the beginning of our recorded tradition, our dealings with myth have been self-conscious, 'commenting on' it (as in Homer's ironical humor about the gods) as well as handing it on. But this need not prevent its images from functioning in our lives, in circumstances where nothing else will serve. (c) What I have just been saying makes it clear that, from Blumenberg's perspective, the literary treatment of myth cannot be segregated as a 'merely aesthetic' matter with no bearing on the practical business of life. Neither, on the other hand, will literature derive all of its punch from a 'given' stock of mythical images that it receives from preliterate strata of consciousness or history, and merely repackages. Some of the interesting active relations between myth and literature that become possible in this new perspective are outlined in sections 6 and 7, below. (d) Finally, if myth does not 'precede' (and is not rendered obsolete by) rationality, then the Nazis' apparent use of myth ceases to be the great inexplicable reversion that it seemed to Cassirer, though again it need not be a simple continuation, either. (This can hardly be the type of myth that is indispensable to human survival.) In this type of case especially, if myth does not 'belong to' a past epoch, it is all the more important to define and understand what real myth is, and to distinguish it from other nonrational phenomena, including dogma, ideology, and pseudomyths. Let us return to the fundamental schema. It should not be assumed that Blumenberg's critique of the notion of the historical passage \"from mythos to logos\" means that there are no important developments in human consciousness that can be localized as subsequent to 'the beginnings.' There are, literally, \"epoch-making\" developments, such as the emergence of the category of dogma, in the course of the development of monotheistic religion, or the emergence of modern \"human self-assertion,\" as Blumenberg calls it, with its concepts of the self, matter, method, and progress. (The former is examined in part II, chapter 1, of The Legitimacy of the Modern Age and in part II, chapters 2 and 3, of the present book; the later is the main subject of The Legitimacy of the Modern Age.) But an epoch is not a 'stage' on the way to another one, or a goal toward which previous epochs were directed, the attainment of which makes them 'obsolete.' There is no ladder of epochs (each perhaps with a corresponding \"symbolic form\") such as philosophers of history since the eighteenth century have\n\nPage xiv\n\nwanted to establish. And this applies equally to the 'superepochs' of myth and logos that have been, as it were, the last recourse of teleological philosophy of history. The unity of human history is not that of a teleological sequence but that of the working through of solutions to one original all-encompassing problem, the problem of the \"absolutism of reality.\" The solutionsthe \"symbolic forms\" are not ultimately identical with one another (as Romantics would like myth and rationality, poetry and physics, to be), but neither are they in competition with one another. They perform different, equally essential functions in dealing with man's fundamental problem. 3 The Philosophical Anthropology Underlying Blumenberg's Alternative to the Enlightenment Conception Before proceeding to Blumenberg's alternative to the (broadly) Romantic conception of the nature and process of myth itself, I want to examine from another point of view the \"philosophical anthropology\" that I outlined in the previous section, and to relate it to the basic concepts of The Legitimacy of the Modern Age. Readers will be struck, on the first page of Work on Myth, by Blumenberg's comparison of his idea of the \"absolutism of reality\" to \"the old status naturalis of philosophical theories of culture and the state.\" He does not elaborate on the comparison in this book, but in a paper entitled \"Anthropology's Approach to Rhetoric's Orientation to Action,\" first published in 1971, he provides relevant detail on the subject and at the same time illuminates the difference between his and Cassirer's concepts of \"nature.\" Blumenberg is criticizing Cassirer for not trying to explain why the \"symbolic forms'' are posited, leaving us to assume instead that man, as the animal symbolicum, simply expresses his 'nature' in them, as his (apparently) 'free' creations. \"But,\" Blumenberg objects, to the extent that philosophy is a process of dismantling things that are taken for granted, a 'philosophical' anthropology has to address the question whether man's physical existence is not itself a result that follows from the accomplishments that are ascribed to him as belonging to his 'nature.' The first proposition of a philosophical anthropology would then be: It cannot be taken for granted that man is able to exist. The prototype for such a line of thought can be found in the modern theory of the social contract that deduces the necessity\n\nPage xv of establishing man's 'civil' [bürgerlich: i.e., political as opposed to natural] condition from its finding that his 'natural' condition contradicts the conditions of the possibility of physical existence. For Hobbes the state is the first artifact, which does not enrich (in the direction of a 'world of culture') the environment in which man lives, but rather eliminates its lethal antagonism [the \"war of all against all\"]. The philosophical significance of this theory is not primarily that it explains the appearance of an institution like the state (still less that it explains the appearance of the absolutist state), but rather that it converts the supposed definition of man's nature as that of a\n\nzoon politikon [\"political animal\"Aristotle] into a functional description. I see no other scientific course for an anthropology except, in an analogous manner, to destroy [or \"deconstruct\": destruieren] what is supposedly 'natural' and convict it of its 'artificiality' in the functional system of the elementary human accomplishment called 'life.' f\n\nEvidently, then, the status naturalis to which Blumenberg compares the \"absolutism of reality\" is not primarily Locke's or Rousseau's \"state of nature,\" for example, but rather Hobbes'sa condition that, while it is 'natural' in the sense of being animal-like (\"brutish,\" as Hobbes put it), contradicts man's natural desire for survival, so thatlike the ''absolutism of reality\" it cannot last. But, fleeting though it is (or was, or would have been), it is this state that explains Hobbesian man's willingness to enter the \"contract\" that creates a sovereign who will (supposedly) ensure his survival. Similarly, Blumenbergian man creates his \"symbolic forms\" in order to overcome his equally self-contradictory natural state as a creature lacking the instincts to fit it into a \"niche\" in nature of the kind that every other (surviving) creature has. And while these symbolic forms are 'natural' in the sense that they are (or are supposed to be) common to all men whom we will ever encounter, so that we habitually think of them as aspects of 'human nature,' they are 'artificial' in the more fundamental sense that we can only understand why they exist by interpreting them, not as 'givens,' but as solutions to an antecedent problem and by interpreting human life, not as a result of a good fit between man's instincts and his environment, but rather as the evidence of an accomplishmentas far as we know, a unique accomplishmentthat sets man apart from other species. Thus man's uniqueness is not in something that he is (in his \"essence\" or nature, as, for example, the zoon politikon or the animal symbolicum)\n\nPage xvi\n\nbut in what he does in order to deal with the problem of what he isin order to make himself biologically viable. In this case, as Blumenberg says, it makes sense to try to interpret each of man's characteristic expressions in terms of its contribution toits \"function\" withinthis comprehensive undertaking. And Blumenberg does so with myth, with (as it seems to me) striking results, in this book. To assess this philosophical anthropology as thoroughly as it deservesin relation to the Platonic-Aristotelian tradition in which Cassirer's philosophy of man still stands; to the modern social contract thinkers, a tradition with which it has sharp differences as well as similarities (Hobbes, for example had no use for myth, except perhaps as a source of allegorical illustrations of rational truths); to the tortures of modern thought about man induced by modern science and epistemology, since Descartes; and to other recent efforts to deal with these matters gwould take much more space than I have here. What I do want to do, before going on to myth itself, is to comment briefly on the relation between this model and the central ideas of Blumenberg's Legitimacy of the Modern Age. The concept that links the two books at the most fundamental level is that of function. We can appreciate how central this concept is to the explanatory accomplishment of the model of the \"absolutism of reality\" by zeroing in more closely on just what that explanatory accomplishment is. Blumenberg (like the social contract thinkers before him) repeatedly expresses skepticism about the possibility of ever knowing how his subject (here, myths; there, the state, or society) in fact originated\"Here the rule is: Ignorabimus [We will not know].\"h He mentions many of the popular theories of the origin of myths (the astronomical school; the ritual or history-of-religion approach; Freud's and Jung's psychoanalytical theories) and discusses some of them (Freud's, in particular) at considerable length, but in each case he makes it clear that his interest is primarily in the attitude of the theoretician in question (as an instance of a type of \"work on myth\"), and that he doubts whether any rationally defensible decision between the alternative theories will ever be possible. As the text on the dust jacket of the original German edition (which, by its style, is dearly the work of the author) says, \"The book proceeds from the cautious assumption that one may learn to see more if one leaves the great questions alone, without disdaining them. For that reason, the problem of the origin\n\nPage xvii\n\nof mythswhich has been the subject of many futile effortsis bracketed out, as is their association with the unconscious (as a disguised form of the old 'innate ideas').\" But isn't the model of myth as a means of overcoming the \"absolutism of reality\" a theory of the origin of myth? How can Blumenberg claim that he is bracketing out this question when he devotes his first chapter to a dramatically new answer to it? Obviously, in a sense the \"absolutism of reality\" model is such an answer, but not in the same way as the other theories we are familiar with. Those theories are, in general, mutually incompatible. Myths that reflect the dynamics of our internal psychic organization, or our childhood traumas, cannot at the same time embody an analysis of astronomical and calendrical regularities, or reflect a combination of rituals stemming from cults that were superimposed on one another as a result of some long-forgotten conquest. Sources of these kinds are simply too heterogeneous to be compatible as explanations of the same myths. But none of them is necessarily incompatible with the \"absolutism of reality\" model. This model says nothing about the source of the contents of myths; it only says that their ultimate function, wherever their contents may come from, is to put behind us the Angst that would be inspired by an overpowering reality. You might say that it is a theory of the origin of myth (in the singular), rather than of myths (in the plural). It describes the one vital accomplishment of all myths, as opposed to the possible additional specific accomplishments of individual myths. What is remarkable, though, is how the very specific quality of each of the many individual myths that Blumenberg discusses in the bookfrom Medusa through Abraham and Isaac to Faustseems to be illuminated by this 'functional' approach in a way that few of them have been by the popular theories of 'the origins.' It seems that when one looks for the ultimate human function of myth, one may indeed \"see more'' than when one merely sees myth as a reflection of other realities in and around man. In any case, it is interesting to observe that this distinction between content (or \"substance\") and function is also a key one in Blumenberg's Legitimacy of the Modern Age. i A central problem in that book was to explain how innocent modern ideas like that of cooperative human progress could have been inflated into irrational conceptions like that of an inevitable progress supposedly present in history as a whole. To explain processes of this sort, Blumenberg hypothesized a structure\n\nPage xviii\n\nof formally identical \"positions\" in human consciousness, a structure that endures through changes of epoch (though not necessarily forever) and that we feel compelled to fill (to \"reoccupy\") with whatever content is available in a new epoch. j In the case of \"progress,\" the \"position'' established by the story of God's dealings with the world (from Creation to Last Judgment)the position of a knowledge of the pattern of history as a wholewas \"reoccupied,\" Blumenberg argued, by the new idea of progress, with the result that that idea was distorted, almost beyond recognition, in the way we are familiar with from the famous philosophies of history. Contrary to the \"secularization\" theory, which saw in those philosophies a constant \"substance\" (namely, eschatology) in \"secularized\" form, Blumenberg saw a legitimate new idea being forced into a constant, inherited function. And he applied this model of functional \"positions\" to many other phenomena as well, in the transition from the ancient to the medieval as well as from the medieval to the modern epoch. The fundamental category of explanation has thus remained the same, but its application in the new book yields a distinctly different picture from the one that we know from the first book. In the case of myth, unlike that of 'progress,' for example, it appears that its function may be not only a neglected and illuminating aspect but also the only knowable aspect that it possesses for usto the extent that the great diversity of (and the contradictions between) the accounts of the derivation of its \"substance\" that have been proposed inclines us toward the skepticism about such accounts that Blumenberg advocates. Consequently, myth cannot appear, as in the earlier model, as a distorted form of something else that has been forced to perform a function that does not authentically belong to it. There can be no implication, such as seemed clearly present in The Legitimacy of the Modern Age, that by distinguishing the authentic content from the superimposed function we can clarify the real commitments of an age (whether our own or a previous one). Myth's function is its 'true reality,' or as near as we can ever expect to get to such a reality. Nor is it only that myth originates in preliterate, undocumented times, into which we can only extrapolate backward in the manner of the social contract theorists, that prevents us from distinguishing its 'reality' from its function. If Blumenherg is right to abandon the idea of an epoch-making step forward \"from mythos to logos,\" then myths differ from the phenomena that he analyzed in The Legitimacy\n\nPage xix\n\nof the Modern Age by not \"belonging to\" an epoch at all: by being, as it were, underlying \"constants\" in our entire tradition. This is possible because the function of myth relates not to a framework of mental \"positions,\" which expands (and sometimes contracts) in the course of history, but to a single, allencompassing human achievementthe \"elementary human accomplishment'' of life. This new philosophical anthropology puts the epochs of our tradition into an entirely new perspective, which contrasts sharply with the earlier book's more narrowly focused \"historicism,\" with its scrupulous attention to each epoch's independent claims and premises and its abstention from broad, \"metaphysical\" categories. Not that that scrupulous attention is missing here: None of the distinctions drawn in the earlier book has been obscured, and much fine detail has been added. But the model of life as the elementary human accomplishment and the functional explanation of all of man's \"symbolic forms\" subsumes the earlier model of the structure of \"positions\" so decisively, and unifies the phenomena of human history and consciousness so radically, that it requires an effort to remember that we are still, fundamentally, in the realm of empirical historical-hermeneutic science here, rather than metaphysics. A thorough analysis of the relation between the basic ideas of the two books would be a fascinating and a rewarding project, but is more than I can attempt here. 4 A Non-\"Enlightenment\" Alternative to the Romantic Conception of Myth: The \"Darwinism of Words\" After thus providing an alternative to our dominant, 'Enlightenment\" conception of the relation between myth and scientific rationality, Blumenberg presents a theory that provides an alternative to our dominant conception of the nature and process of myth itself. The Enlightenment and those who adhere to its attitudes generally do not take myth seriously enough to attempt a theory of it, so it turns out that many (if not all) of the prominent theories of myth have (whether consciously or not) a good deal in common with Romanticism. German Romantic theoreticians like Schelling and Friedrich Schlegel, who were impressed by the survival of the Greek, Hindu, Norse, and Celtic mythsdespite the introduction, in the meantime, of writing, monotheistic religion, and 'enlightenment'and by the apparent ubiquity of myth in the world's cultures, saw myth as a kind of primeval,\n\nPage xx\n\n\"original\" endowment of, if not a revelation granted to, mankind. The modern disciplines that study myth, including literary studies, anthropology, and psychology, may not use such suggestive language, but they do rely on a similar fundamental schema when they study the way a given \"stock\" of myths is ''used\" in literature; or the way certain universal \"structures\" may underlie the diversity of myths in different cultures; or the way certain universal experiences in the childhood of the individual or of mankind function in the unconscious and consequently in mythin every case assuming that the \"pregnance\" (in the Gestalt psychologists' sense), k the sharp definition and the compelling power of the mythical motif, is fully present from the beginning, that myth itself has no history. In contrast to this, Blumenberg reminds us that the mature mythology that we know from Homer, Hesiod, the Ramayana, from our informants in \"primitive\" cultures, and so on, must be imagined as the product of thousands of years of oral storytelling, in the course of which vastly greater quantifies of stories, figures, and variations on earlier stories and figures were tested on audiences upon whose active approval the storyteller's success, perhaps even his livelihood, dependedand that as a result of such \"testing\" most of these were discarded as not having the impact that the surviving material has. In other words, the stock of myth that has come down to us is the product, not of a reverent process of handing down (such as comes into play with written texts, and above all with Scriptures), but rather of an unsparing process of \"natural selection,\" which Blumenberg in fact entitles the \"Darwinism of words.\" In this process the compelling power of mythical material was brought out, was \"optimized,\" by the combined \"work\" (productive and destructive) of storytellers and their audiences. And it is this process, rather than any innate and original human endowment, that explains the 'pregnance' and the durability of what has survived it. Like evolution, the genesis of myths is not something that We can observe directly; in fact, the epistemological situation is even worse with them, in that we have no 'fossils' illustrating stages in that genesis. But, also as in evolution, if we allow this difficulty to prevent us from constructing a hypothetical mechanism, we will be left with either total ignorance or an assumption of simultaneous creation or (essentially Platonic) preformation. \"Selection\" is the only theory that gives the understanding a handle on an actual process, hypothetical though it will no doubt always remain.\n\nPage xxi\n\nIt is certainly a novel idea as applied to myth. Scholars who study myth in oral cultures have not speculated much on any diachronic process by which its patterns may have developed. They have, of course, initially been concerned with the 'simultaneous' array of myths, which is what the evidence confronts them with directly; and their well-known genetic hypotheses have all been in terms of extramythical realities (astronomical, psychological, ritual, or whatever) thought to be 'reflected' in this array. Rather than a process of development, then, taking place over time, their theories have presented an essentially static pictureconsistent, as I said, with the basic Romantic schema according to which each myth is assumed always to have had the 'pregnance' that it exhibits now. Those scholars, on the other hand, such as Milrnan Parry and A. B. Lord, who have studied the mechanisms by which \"oral literature\" is made transmissiblewhich must ultimately have a great deal to do with the process of increasing 'pregnance,' through the interaction of \"singers\" and audiences, that Blumenberg hypothesizeshave in fact been more struck by the sheer survival of an oral epic, as such, than by the question of how its contents reached the level of power and memorability that they exhibit when they reach us; so that again their models have been essentially static, rather than dynamic. Nor is there a close relationship between Blumenberg's \"Darwinism of words\" and previous applications or the idea of evolution within the sphere of human history. Unlike the \"social Darwinism\" of Darwin's Descent of Man and other turn-of-the-century writings, the \"Darwinism of words\" does not describe the survival or \"selection\" of human individuals or populations. And more recent attempts to discern an evolutionary process among social systems l do not often get into clear focus the relation between the operation of evolution on physical bodies and its operation on cultural constructs, as Blumenberg does in the following formulation (which also explains why ''social Darwinism\" does not describe man's experience as a whole): The organic system resulting from the mechanism of evolution becomes 'man' by evading the pressure of that mechanism, which it does by setting against it something like a phantom body. This is the sphere of his culture, his institutionsand also his myths. . . . The conditions of selection no longer reach and have an effect upon man as a physical system to the extent that he has\n\nlearned to subject his artifacts and instruments,\n\nPage xxii\n\ninstead of himself, to the process of adaptation. . . . It is to these, rather than to their producer, that the 'survival of the fittest' applies. m\n\nThis striking point ties in neatly with Blumenberg's philosophical anthropology, where culture appeared as man's unique solution to his biological predicament of lacking instincts to fit him into an ecological niche. Now we see that this \"solution\" protects usagain uniquelyfrom the operation of the normal biological process of selection, by undergoing a similar process in our stead. From the same passage from which I have just been quoting, we learn that \"theory and technology\" are among the cultural phenomena that are subjected to this process of selection. It is probably most obvious in this case how such selection can servevia the development of the \"forces of production\" and of capacities for prediction and preventionto protect human beings from the direct operation of Darwinian selection on themselves. Blumenberg asserts, in factwhile making the necessary reservations about ''inconsistencies in the system of the objectifications produced by selection . . . which impair the overall result\"that \"by this criterion there has been and there is objective progress. . . . History, whatever else it may be, is also a process of optimization.\"n And this \"objective progress\" occurs not only in theory (i.e., in science) and in technology, or in them and, by an odd combination, in myth as well, but also in the whole sphere of \"modes of behavior and thought structures\" that Blumenberg summarizes under the term institutions. The term institution is used here in the special sense given it by the recently deceased German philosopher-anthropologist Arnold Gehlen.o It designates a mode of behavior or thought structure that has not been rationally or purposefully constructed (as \"institutions,\" in one common sense, are thought of as being or having been), but rather is simply inherited and taken for granted, without any explicit justification, as \"the way we do things\" or the way we think. (One major sense of the Latin root, institutio \"custom,\" expresses this idea.) Blumenberg contrasts the rich variety of 'institutions'social, cultural, and mythicalthat have been produced by millenniums of \"selection\" with the (comparatively, at least) unfulfilled promises of Romanticism's favorite agency of production: the imagination. When it was announced from the walls during May 1968 in Paris that the imagination should and now would come to power, it was im-\n\nPage xxiii mediately clear to the late grandchildren of aesthetic Idealism that this guaranteed that everything would become different and thus better. No one thought they needed to askno one would have been permitted to askwhat the imagination had to offer, what it had ever offered. We can confidently invert Baudelaire's statement that the imagination created the world, asserting that it could never have accomplished it. . . . The example of the literary genre of 'utopia,' with its (reluctantly admitted) poverty, demonstrates what the imagination's capacity to pursue and break through the opening created by negation really amounts to. . . . No imagination could have invented what ethnology and cultural anthropology have collected in the way of regulations of existence, world interpretations, forms of life, classifications, ornaments, and insignia. All of this is the product of a process of selection that has been at work for a long time. . . . The Neptunism of selection always has a head start, in relation to the Vulcanism that Idealist aesthetics expects of the imagination, as a result of having shaped the latter's elementary possibilities. p\n\nThis critique of the claims made for the human imagination by a certain kind of radicalism is a valuable complement to Blumenberg's earlier criticism of the idea of myth as an original human endowment or revelation. For, despite the apparent conflict between the two ideas as possible explanations of myth (original 'revelation' versus original 'poetry'), they are in fact both cornerstones of Romanticism, which probably secretly hopes, by uniting them, to unite myth with poetry, the 'origins' with the present, and 'reality' with the imaginationthus overcoming the aggravating contingency of our experience of history. By providing an alternative account of the phenomena of myth and art, of the durability of inherited cultures, and of cultural diversity, that give each of these key Romantic ideas their plausibility, the \"Darwinism of words\" helps to overcome, from the Romantic side, the Enlightenment-versus-Romantic antinomy of attitudes that is so pervasive in our thinkingjust as the \"absolutism of reality\" model helps to overcome it from the side of the Enlightenment. 5 Why This Theory Is Not Obseurantist or Antirational One may nevertheless wonder whether, despite the \"objective progress\" that he credits it with producing, Blumenberg's \"Darwinism of words\" does not really imply a new kind of obscurantist traditionalism.\n\nPage xxiv\n\nIf myths and other \"institutions\" are the products of so many ages of optimizing \"selection,\" and if the imagination is unable to compete with them by projecting new patterns having a comparable power, does this not mean that traditional waysor, at any rate, whatever ways are generated by the process of \"selection,\" as opposed to any conscious and purposive constructive effort on our partare always the best ways? Arnold Gehlen certainly conveyed the impression that this was his viewthat the modern dismantling of traditional customs and attitudes, while perhaps inevitable, was overall a loss without a corresponding gain. In Blumenberg's case, if the \"objective progress'' that does occur comes about, as it were, behind our backs, unintentionally, as a result of a blind process of \"selection,\" it would seem that the only active role that might be left to rationality would be that of generating theories or techniques (whose fate would be decided not by rationality itself but by \"selection\"), while in the area of human interrelations it might have no role at all. We would be facing perhaps the most sophisticated form of anti-Enlightenment obscurantism yet seen. Is this actually what Blumenberg is arguing for? Before answering this question, it may be well to extend it by raising an even broader question about theories that advocate tolerance of myth, a question that is seldom raised in humanistic discussions of the subject but that certainly ought to be faced. One way to bring this question into focus is to compare Cassirer's earlier and later books on myth. In the 1920s Cassirer followed the Romantics and the ethnologists a long way toward granting myth equal dignity with rationality and seeking to understand it sympathetically, \"from inside,\" as a coherent way of being in the worldeven though he never really abandoned the Enlightenment philosophy of history according to which myth is ultimately, and necessarily, replaced by logos. In The Myth of the State (1946), on the other hand, the emphasis is ultimately very much on this philosophy of history, and on the awful anomaly by whichin the years since Cassirer's first work on this subjectthe Nazis had apparently resurrected myth in full seriousness, outside the harmless domain of literature, and with dreadful results for millions of people. Myth was now something that \"lurks in the dark and waits for its hour and opportunity,\" which arrives when an apparently rational social organization is weakened and \"no longer able to combat the demonic mythical powers.\" q\n\nPage xxv\n\nIs this an appropriate description of what happened in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s? It is easy to see how it would seem so to one whose life and world were completely disrupted by the events of the period. And even in retrospect, it often seems as though no amount of economic, social, or political analysis of conditions in Germany prior to the Nazi takeover quite suffices to explain it or what followed it. Certainly everyone would agree that \"irrational\" factors of some sort played a major role. But can such factors properly be identified with \"myth\"? Cassirer thought the distinctive characteristic of what he called the Nazi myths was that unlike traditional myths, they were \"manufactured,\" \"myth made according to plan.'' r Clearly these were not myths in the sense that Romanticism understood mytheither as inherited and primordial or as products of the free, poetic imagination. But Cassirer, attracted though he was to the Romantic theory of myth (and, unlike quite a few writers, he refused to hold the Romantics responsible for the later \"rehabilitation and glorification of myth in modem politics\"),s did not really believe in that theory. And his own writings on myth were, ultimately, more eclectic and descriptive than they were sharply definitive. The result was that, while he had no trouble recognizing Nazi \"science\" and \"philosophy\" as bogus, he had no criterion by which to categorize their \"myths\" as equally bogus. So, when he sought to put his finger on what had made the phenomenon of Nazism possible, \"myth\" was (as it has been for many others) a tempting candidate. Seemingly more concrete than sheer \"irrationality,\" but setting up a sharper contrast to rationality than is present in such familiar phenomena as ideology, propaganda, uneven historical development, or the state (whose relation to myth Cassirer did not manage to clarify), \"myth\" was a category that seemed to express the apocalyptic quality of what Nazism had brought about. His analysis found widespread acceptance. Indeed, many readers must have found it rather unsurprising. For (and this is what I wanted to bring out with this digression) there is a very familiar \"commonsense\" version of rationalism that follows Cassirer's example here in categorizing whatever is resistant to rationality as \"myth,\" much as Descartes once spoke of \"prejudice,\" or Bacon of \"idols,\"the only difference being that \"myth\" lends itself more readily to demonization than prejudice or \"idols\" didno doubt because, since an epoch of our past history is associated with it, its 'reappearance' has the dan-\n\nPage xxvi\n\ngerous flavor of atavism. In periods when rationality seems especially threatened, it is easy to picture myth as a sort of Manichean antagonist, which rationality must always combat. To the extent that rationality is in an ongoing crisis, such a view will be even more persuasive. And yet it is itself quite mythical in character. The idea of a force or agency that is antagonistic to rationality has the narrative character that is natural to a confrontation of hypostatized 'powers.' This explains Cassirer's use of lurid metaphors (myth \"lurks in the dark,\" and so on) and his failure to examine the supposed confrontation of myth and rationality concretely. Indeed, it explains the way we all keep this idea 'in the back of our minds,' as a sort of unacknowledged myth of last resort. If the demonization of myth is precisely thata mythicization of the difference between myth and rationalitythen the other side of the coin is that myths, in the narrower sense of the pregnant stories and images that we inherit from a preliterate past, are in fact different from the emotionally loaded images and slogans of modern racism, charismatic leadership, and so on. What exactly is the difference? The distinctive quality of genuine myths, which the modem \"manufactured\" oneshowever great their emotional appeal may bemust always lack, is the 'significance' (see part I, chapter 3) or 'pregnance' that is produced by the process of \"selection,\" through millenniums of storytelling, that Blumenberg entities the \"Darwinism of words.\" This quality cannot be reproduced by ''new myths,\" whether they are benevolently or diabolically constructed. When Nazi \"philosophers\" talked about \"the myth of the twentieth century\" and the like, we have to understand that they were attempting, illegitimately, to appropriate the dignity of myth, just as (often at the same time) they illegitimately invoked the dignity of science for their racist doctrines. If we can keep this fact in focus, we may even be able to invoke genuine myth on 'our side' in the struggle against irrational doctrines and movements, as Thomas Mann, for example, tried to do. Certainly our modest capacity for rationality can use all the help it can get. Indeed, a certain modesty on the part of rationality may be the most important moral of this whole story, t If Cassirer had not followed most of his preceptors, since the seventeenth century, in assuming that the appearance of rationality in the form of philosophy and science removed any need for myth, he might have been less surprised at the uneven development of effective rationality in his\n\nhomelandat\n\nPage xxvii\n\nwhat Blumenberg has described as \"the striking nonsimultaneities in what is chronologically simultaneous . . . the fundamental delay of enlightenment.\" u A rationality that is supposed to meet man's every need can easily disappoint its advocates as well as those to whom it is advocated. It seems likely that it is an unspoken disappointment of this sort that explains the presence in our minds of the \"myth of last resort\" that I have been discussing, which blames the failures of rationality on a dangerous and implacable opponent called ''myth.\" Having said this much about the tendency to set myth up as the great bogeymana tendency that is in the back of enough minds to need to be confrontedI will now return to the previous question of whether the \"Darwinism of words\" implies (if not a pact with the devil, at least) an obscurantist traditionalism,v If a \"selection\" process among mental constructs produces not only striking stories and figures but, more generally, valuable \"institutions,\" with the variety and persuasiveness of which the mere imagination of individuals cannot compete, does this mean that conscious and intentional departures from traditional ways are, in general, unjustified? What is the role of rationality in such a situationif it has any role at all? Once again, myth seems to threaten to be incompatible with rationality. The passage in which Blumenberg confronts this issue is one of the most fascinating passages in the book. The key sentences are these: \"What the heading of 'institutions' covers is, above all, a distribution of burdens of proof. Where an institution exists, the question of its rational foundation is not, of itself, urgent, and the burden of proof always lies on the person who objects to the arrangement that it carries with it.\"w The basis of this presumption in favor of the institution is, of course, that, like a product of organic evolution, it is not only \"something that has at least proved itself over long periods of time, that has been refined as the product of countless rounds of selection, but also something that did not at least immediately lead into fatal dead ends, that did not operate as a liability detracting from success in life.\" But how did the distribution of \"burdens of proof\" get involved here? Shouldn't the \"burden\" be on rationality in generalon science, in the widest senseto establish rational modes of behavior and thought structures, of which individuals who want to be rational can avail themselves? How is it that \"the person who objects\" suddenly carries all the onus of responsibility here?\n\nPage xxviii\n\nThe answer is twofold. First, as Blumenberg writes, \"enlightenment\"because it rejects dogma, revelation, and 'authority' in general as sources of justified belief\"allows thought to be legitimated only by the fact that everyone does it himself and for himself. . . . \" That is, it is not good enough to accept modes of behavior or thought structures as endorsed by Science, even if it were possible for Science to produce a finished set of such modes and structures for us to adopt. We are only rational if, as far as possible, we think through for ourselves the reasons for what we do and think. It is only the fact that people in general do that, or can do that, that gives science the authority it has in our culture as the sum (potentially, despite all the distortions due to inevitable specialization, professionalization, and so on) of the active rationality of all of us. But, second, it is manifestly not possible for each person to work out a rational justification, from scratch, of every mode of behavior or thought structure that he needs to employ in order to live his actual life. Even for our collective rationality, as science, we now generally recognize that such an undertakingthough we are engaged in itis not one that can be completed (as Descartes, for example, seems to have thought it could be). All the more so for each of us individually. So the \"meager finitude of the life that the thinker-for-himself has disposition over\" means that he simply has to take some things for granted. Thoroughly and explicitly rational \"decision-making\" is not possible in every case. And that, of course, is where \"institutions\" come in. Blumenberg acknowledges the danger that goes along with them: \"Every economy of ideas for which no rational foundation is given becomes suspect when it presents itself as the demand for submission to something for which no rational foundation can be given, and thus becomes the center of new anxieties''a result that would contradict the inherent purpose of myth (namely, the overcoming of the ultimate anxiety caused by the \"absolutism of reality\"), but is very possible if the relation of myth (and of \"institutions\" in general) to rationality is not clearly understood. On the other hand, there is also reason to distrust rationality, which is all too ready to engage in destruction when it fails to recognize the rationality of things for which no rational foundation is given and believes that it can afford to allow itself to get carried away by the process of establishing rational foundations. Descartes thought that\n\nPage xxix the best way to build dries rationally was to begin by razing the old cities. Not even World War II yielded proof of this prospect for rationality, There are moments in which the outcomes of centuries and millenniums are thoughtlessly sacrificed. What had been held fast and passed on by a loyalty shielded from all reflection becomes a source of offense and is gotten rid of. But one does not have to be conservative to see that the demand for 'critical' destruction and then for a final rational foundation leads to burdens of proof that, if they were really accepted and undertaken with the seriousness with which they are asserted and demanded, would no longer leave any room for what is supposed to be gained in the process. . . . So the selection of constants over long periods of time is in fact a condition of the possibility of running the risks of 'trial and error' in parts of one's behavior. . . .\n\nThis is not a \"counsel of despair\" for rationality. It is simply the rational way to deal with the antinomy between the endless nature of the process of rational inquiry and the finite nature of our lives, which makes it \"rational not to be rational to the utmost extent,\" and to want to see good arguments for abandoning practices that, even if the reasons for them are not obvious, have so far 'stood the test of time.' At the same time, Blumenberg really is open to such arguments. Unlike Hobbes and Gehlen, who are both persuaded that the only rational thing to do is submit to an inherited something that they believe serves to solve man's fundamental problem (to the \"sovereign,\" or to primordial human \"institutions\"), x Blumenberg is quite prepared to be persuaded that a particular human ''institution\" is not at present functional. But the burden of proof is, as we said, on the critic, not on the \"institution\" and those who abide by it. When this account of the matter is understood, it becomes dear that this book is not a Romantic brief for myth and tradition against rationality and Enlightenment, any more than it is the reverse of that. Instead, it presents a dearly worked-out proposal for overcoming that unnecessary and debilitating conflict in our understanding of ourselves and our history. 6 Some Concrete Applications The book contains a great deal more than the philosophical analysis I have sketched. It contains a detailed discussion of monotheism and\n\nPage xxx\n\nthe category of dogma as they emerge from and differentiate themselves from polytheism and mytha discussion that casts new light on the Bible, on Gnosticism (a historically crucial intermediate case), on Christianity, and on 'nonreligious' phenomena such as utopianism and what Sorel called social myths. If the tenets of faith are not \"mere myth,\" as our 'Manichaean' myth of the agency antagonistic to rationality would describe them, and if it is not helpful to call them \"mere\" dogma, either, what exactly are they? And what is the quasireligious attitude that is shared by adherents of such \"invisible gods\" y as the Revolution, or Being? Blumenberg brings out the outlines of a 'dogmatic' attitude to (what it regards as the one, all-important) truth, an attitude that he does not present as a bugaboo, but as one of a small number of very persuasive attitudes to reality and truth that we are acquainted with. Christians (like utopians and others) may perhaps feel that his analysis is mistaken, but they will have to admit that few philosophers who are not professing Christians have treated Christianity as seriously and as thoughtfully as Blumenberg does in this book and in his two previous major works. Finally, the book examines many detailed examples of the \"work on myth\" that continues in modem literature. One of the remarkable facts brought out in this connection is that the durability of individual myths (which led Romanticism to think of them as atemporal, primeval) is not incompatible with their acquiring wholly new and unsuspected aspects. Time does not wear away instances of pregnance; it brings things out in themthough one may not add that these things were 'in them' all along. That holds, in the case of myth, least of all for extensions. When Albert Camus said of Sisyphus that one should imagine him as being happy, the change of 'sign' was an increase in the visibility of the myth's potential. When Paul Valéry 'corrected' the Faust story by suggesting that the only way we could picture the one who had once been tempted, now, was as himself tempting Mephistopheles, something became perceptible that simply could not have been made up and added on, but instead was irresistibly drawing near as the classical demon figure grew increasingly inferior.z\n\nThese examples and many others from our recorded \"work on myth\" give us glimpses of the nature of the unrecorded \"work of myth\" that the hypotheses of the \"absolutism of reality\" and the ''Darwinism of\n\nPage xxxi\n\nwords\" seek to characterize, and at the same time add to our understanding of the ('postmythical') epochs and authors who produced them. The second half of the book is an extended case study of \"work on myth,\" the case being the Prometheus myth, from its earliest recorded appearances, in Hesiod and Aeschylus, to the twentieth-century versions of Gide and Kafka. In contrast to the apparently simple recorded history of the myth of Sisyphus, for example, that of Prometheus presents an incredible variety of aspects and interpretations in the course of these two and a half millenniums. The one writer whom Blumenberg singles out for particularly extended treatment in this context is Goethe, to whom part IV is devoted. Readers familiar with Goethe will not be surprised at the importance he is given here. Several facts make this natural, if not inevitable: his historical situation, between the German (and French) Enlightenment and Romanticism (he joined neither 'party'); his manifestly contrived and artificial position in society, as court genius in Weimar, which made the role of ideas in his existence both more crucial and more visible than it is in most lives; and his combination of aesthetic 'polytheism' and Spinozist scientific pantheism, that is, of 'mythical' and 'modern' patterns of thought, a duality that reappears in his combination of imaginative work on myth (especially the series of revisions of the Prometheus theme, from his youthful \"Prometheus\" ode of 1773, to Pandora, in 1808, and beyond it as well) and conceptual work (documented mainly in his Conversations and his autobiography, Dichtung und Wahrheit)both types of work being vital to his ability to function not only as an artist but also as a human being. Nearly every German philosopher deals with Goethe in one way or another, often at length; Cassirer, Karl Löwith, and (in the German \"cultural sphere,\" though not a German) Georg Lukács are some prominent examples. It is doubtful that any of them has gotten into the texture of his life and works in anything like the way Blumenberg does in part IV of this book. At the same time, Blumenberg is able to bring Goethe's 'world view'including some of its most potent and paradoxical components, such as the combination of polytheism and Spinozism, the concept of the ''demonic,\" the dictum \"Nemo contra deum nisi deus ipse,\" and the relationship to Napoleoninto a focus that appears to be unique in the literature on Goethe. Thus we see in fascinating detail how an appreciation of work on \"images,\" as Goethe called them, which sees\n\nPage xxxii\n\nit neither as a substitute for nor as unrelated to the conceptual work of rationality, can help us to understand what makes possible the life and productivity of an individual, just as much as those of the human species. 7 \"Bringing Myth to an End,\" and Human Autonomy In conclusion I want to examine another concept of Blumenberg's, one that may at first seem somewhat paradoxical in relation to what I have said so far. aa This is the idea of \"bringing myth to an end,\" which provides the title of part II, chapter 4. Seeing this title in this book, one might expect to find a critique of the Enlightenment idea that myth can be, or has long since been, brought to an end with the emergence of philosophy or science. But this is not at all what one does find. The discussion does not center on any of the typical representatives of this thesis, from Descartes to the present, but rather on the series of versions of the Faust storyby Lessing, Goethe, Butor, and Valéryand on a series of modern 'philosophers' myths' beginning with what Blumenberg calls the \"fundamental myth of German Idealism\" (that is, principally, of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel). He sees these' authors (both the writers and the philosophers) as attempting to bring myth to an end by means of itself, rather than by offering a substitute for it. The Idealists, for whom \"I, the eternal subject, am the bearer of this universe, whose whole existence is nothing but a relationship to me,\" as Schopenhauer puts it, are offering a \"last myth,'' a final myth that is so comprehensive in its implications that it leaves no room for other mythical figures about whom other stories could be told.bb Valéry's Mon Faust, on the other handlike Gide's and Kafka's versions of Prometheus (which are discussed in part V, chapter 3)is an attempt to bring myth to an end by the indirect means of bringing one particular great myth to an end. This would be accomplished by progressively deforming the story, by ignoring or reversing what had seemed to be its fundamental patterns (as in the reversal of tempter and tempted in Valéry's Faust), to such an extent that it is only barely recognizable as the same myth, at which point (if one were completely successful) the telling and retelling that is the life of the story would have to come to an end. What do these things mean? They have to be understood, Blumenberg says, in relation to a projected goal that is the precise opposite\n\nPage xxxiii\n\nof the hypothetical initial \"absolutism of reality\" that gave rise to myth in the first place. The absolutism of reality is the problem that myth helps to solve. If myth were brought to an end, we would have arrived at the definitive solution of that problem, which would presumably mean the subject's complete disposition over realitythe \"absolutism of the subject,\" in factin which there could no longer be any need for myth. The Idealists are, in effect, baldly stating that we are in that situation and, in fact, that we always have been. To make their assertion plausible, they put it in the form of a story about the subject and 'its' worlda story that is presented as \"philosophy\" rather than as myth, so as not to call attention to what it has in common with the phenomena of human dependency that it is trying to bring to an end. Valéry, Gide, and Kafka, on the other hand, seek (in effect) to demonstrate that we have arrived at that situation, by bringing one great myth to a standstill. For, presumably, if a writer's magic were powerful enough to ''bring to an end\" one of the most stubbornly persistent mental constructs we possess, one that no individual brought into existence in the first place, then the writer (or we) would be beyond needing such constructs any longer. The challenge of bringing myth to an end in either of these ways is, Blumenberg says, one of the greatest stimuli to modern literary and philosophical dealings with myth. In literature, it has produced some of the most fascinating works of this century. In philosophyGerman philosophy, in particularit has produced a long and sometimes bewildering sequence of attempts to occupy definitively the position of the final myth. (To mention only a few of these attempts, after those of the Idealists: Nietzsche's \"eternal recurrence,\" Max Scheler's story of the God who becomes himself through the world process, Heidegger's story of Being.) It does not appear that any of these attempts, either in philosophy or in literature, has in fact brought myth to an end. As Blumenberg finally says about Kafka's 'eschatological' version of Prometheus: \"But what if there were still something to say, after all?\" cc It seems impossible to exclude the possibility that the myth might after all be capable of further variation, and thus of retellingthat it might, in fact, go on. This should not be surprising if we take seriously the parallelism of \"absolutism of reality\" and \"bringing myth to an end.\" A definitive solution to the problem of the absolutism of reality would be just as much a hypothetical \"limiting case\" as is the problem to which it\n\nPage xxxiv\n\nwould be addressed. Neither 'end' of the history of myth is something that we can know has in fact been realized. Both are necessary postulates in understanding what we have done, and are doing, with myths, but they function like the \"limit\" that is approached by a converging function in mathematics: One never in fact arrives at it. If there is a 'human condition,' then it is between these two limits. Does accepting such a 'condition'recognizing that myth cannot be definitively brought to an end, that we cannot know that we have reached the point where we no longer need itmean that we have to renounce the Enlightenment's dream of the autonomous individual who dictates to reality, rather than being dictated to by it? And does recognizing Fichte's, Hegel's, Nietzsche's, and Heidegger's stories as a series that is potentially endless, because they attempt something that cannot be definitively accomplished, require us to conclude that such efforts are simply in vain? Blumenberg would answer both of these questions in the negative. The sequence of would-be 'final' myths that he reviews is not, to him, in vain, because it reflects an effort that can be better understood and more effectively pursued, even though never terminated; and such understanding and effort directly serve the autonomous individual, though likewise never definitively 'establishing' him. This becomes evident when Blumenberg contrasts two kinds of \"final myth\": those (like Nietzsche's myth of eternal recurrence and Hans Jonas's myth of God's putting the success of his Creation, and his own 'happiness,' irrevocably in man's hands) that continue Idealism's tendency to make the subjectmanresponsible for the world as a whole, and those (represented here by Schopenhauer's myth of reincarnations) that come closer to a \"standard for final myths\" that Blumenberg says Schopenhauer established, which is (in Blumenberg's words) that they should present \"the subject's responsibility to himself and for himself.\" dd This latter category is easier to grasp in the light of a recent short essay, \"Reflections on a Proposition of Nietzsche,\" in which Blumenberg presents what he regards as an attractive version of the myth of the immortality of the soul.ee He interprets Nietzsche's note, \"That we could bear being immortalthat would be the highest thing,\" as suggesting that we should imagine immortality as the capacity to see all the consequences of one's actions (after as well as before one's\n\ndeath) and to remember (without benefit of repression or forgetfulness)\n\nPage xxxv\n\neverything that one did; from which flows the question: Could one, in fact, bear itto continue eternally as the person who had that past and those consequences? This myth certainly serves very well to focus one's \"responsibility to and for oneself,\" while avoiding the 'superman' implication of Idealism and of (most of) Nietzsche, and of Jonas's myththe implication that man must accept responsibility for reality as a whole. So not all 'final myths' are created equal. Some meet the \"standard for final myths\" better than others do. But what is the status of this \"standard\"? Schopenhauer laid it down by example, in his myth of reincarnations, which resembles Blumenberg's myth of immortality in the way it focuses on the individual's responsibility for his own fate (though it has logical difficulties, which Blumenberg brings out in the final paragraphs of the chapter), but equally important is the fact that Schopenhauer noted an essential connection between his myth and Kant's \"postulate\" of the immortality of the soul. Kant held that such a postulate was necessary for practical reason (even though it could not be known to be true, as metaphysicians had thought it could, by theoretical reason) because it held open the possibility that virtue might be rewarded in the hereafter, so that our sense of justice would not be contradicted outright by reality. There was also the possibility, if the \"postulate\" of immortality was expanded into a myth of reincarnation, that virtue might be easier to achieveone might make progress toward (the impossible) complete compliance with the Categorical Imperativein future lives. Overall, then, the postulate's function was to ward off moral resignation due to the difficulties encountered by the goodwill in the real world. This was just what Schopenhauer's myth of reincarnations was meant to do (though by the reverse process of threatening punishment in future lives for suffering that one inflicted during this life). And Blumenberg's myth of immortality, without bringing in moral criteria, as such, does the same thing. Thus all three philosophersirrespective of whether they propose \"postulates\" or mythsaim to encourage an autonomous individual who takes charge of his own fate, which is, in fact, the goal of the Enlightenment and of modem \"human selfassertion\" (as Blumenberg called it in The Legitimacy of the Modern Age) in general. The effectiveness of Kant's doctrine of the postulatesindeed, of his whole\n\nanalysis of practical reasonhas been limited by its schematic character, beginning with the distinction of theoretical from practical\n\nPage xxxvi\n\nreason: What exactly is a necessary but unknowable \"postulate\"? How can theoretical reason be satisfied with action based on premises that it can never test? Myth, on the other hand, which wears its untestability on its face and does not claim to be \"reason,\" is at least something whose function we have been familiar with for a long time. To those who think that under either name, myth or postulate, immortality is \"obsolete rubbish,\" Blumenberg replies that \"the oppressiveness of contingency, which lies behind the myth, does not cease.\" Whether as a result of \"the conflict that arises from the fact that a subject is the result of a physical process\" which it can never hope to control completely (the conflict that Idealism seeks to resolve by projecting the subject behind the physical process), or as a result of the more recently recognized \"overwhelming presumption that one is produced by alien, social agencies\" (the presumption that existentialism desperately resists with its doctrine that existence is prior to essence), it is clear that the autonomous subject is in chronic trouble. ff Our consciousness of both of these types of contingency will (if anything) be increased by the progress of science, which, while it creates new means for us to use in controlling a continuously increasing range of reality, at the same time continually strengthens the presumption that the most fundamental layers of our personhood are exogenously determined. This ultimate contingency seems to be, in fact, the irreducible, permanent form of the absolutism of realityright at the core of the human subject who dreamed of freeing himself from it. This being the case, one can see that \"final myths,\" if they can help us to deal in some way with this permanent problem, have a crucial role to play. However successful the various myths that have been created for this purpose may be judged to be, the problem that they address is clear. And having it clearly in view, it is easier to see why, to maximize their chances of effectiveness, final myths should present \"the subject's responsibility to himself and for himself.\" This is the minimum position that must be defended if autonomy is not to be entirely lost. A further implication of Blumenberg's account is, presumably, that the authors of the \"final myths\" that do not meet this standard so wellbecause they go beyond it, to extremeswould nevertheless recognize its validity. When one thinks about Fichte's moralism, Nietzsche's doctrine of the will, Heidegger's\n\n\"authenticity\" and \"resoluteness,\" it seems not unlikely that they would in fact do so. (In this\n\nPage xxxvii\n\ncase their extravagant final myths would be evidence of the need for further \"work,\" rather than of some fundamental modem hubris.) Indeed, the premise underlying the \"standard\"that one must accept responsibility for being who one is, in spite of all physical and social determinismsis so fundamental for us that it seems safe to assume that the writers who seek to bring myth to an end by bringing one great traditional myth to an end would recognize its validity for their efforts tooeven though the claim that one has brought Faust or Prometheus to an end (which, of course, is never explicitly made) would itself be about as hubristic as anything Fichte or Nietzsche wrote. For their real goal, just as with the philosophers, is not omnipotence or omnicompetence, but only a termination of dependency and determinism, a definitive exclusion of the absolutism of reality, which would be the achievement of the Kantian, the modern, and the (perhaps) universal human goal of autonomy. gg Unattainable, or not definitively attainable, though that goal is, the more clearly we formulate it the more evidently necessary the pursuit of it becomes. It is a major step forward in this clarification when the role of myth in the processalongside the well-known and much celebrated role of reasonis explained, and when it becomes clear that the two modes, reason and myth, are both just as necessary to the pursuit of this 'end' of human history as they were 'in the beginning,' in the first confrontation with (or, more accurately, avoidance of) the absolutism of reality.

Work on Myth, originally published as Arbeit am Mythos (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1979), is Blumenberg's third major work. The first, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1983)translated from the revised edition (1973 1976) of Die Legitimität der Neuzeit (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1966)is the only one previously available in English. The intervening major work is Die Genesis der kopernikanischen Welt (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1975). Since Work on Myth, Blumenberg has published Die Losbarkeit der Welt (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1981). His other works include Paradigmen zu einer Metaphorologie (Bonn: Bouvier, 1960), reprinted from Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte 6 (1960); 7 142; Die kopernikanische Wende (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1965); and Schiffbruch mit Zuschauer. Paradigms ether Daseinsmetapher, suhrkamp taschenbuch wissenschaft 289 (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1979). b. Cassirer's works on myth extend from the second volume (1925) of his Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, trans. Ralph Manheim (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1955) to The Myth of the State (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1946). c. Blumenberg gave an address assessing Cassirer's accomplishment, and containing some very pregnant indications of what, in Blumenberg's opinion, remained to be done, on the occasion of his acceptance of the University of Heidelberg's Kuno Fischer Prize for work in the history of philosophy, in July 1974. It appeared under the title \"Ernst Cassirers gedenkend . . . \", in Revue Internationale de Philosophic 28 (1974): 456 463, and is reprinted in his Wirklichkeiten in denen wir leben (Stuttgart: Reclam, 1981), pp. 163 172. d. Pp. 3 4 below. e. P. 120 below. f. \"Anthropologische Annäherung an die Aktualität der Rhetorik,\" in Wirklichkeiten in denen wir leben, pp. 114 115. (This paper was first published in Italian in Il Verri. Rivista di Letteratura 35/36 (1971): 49 72.) (On destruieren/Destruktion see translator's note a to part I, chapter 2.) In the passage I have quoted, Blumenberg goes on to say that \"a first attempt of this kind was\n\nmade by Paul Alsberg in 1922 in his Das Menschheitsrätsel. . . . Then in 1940, Arnold Gehlenwith his work, Der Menseh, which, though questionable in its intention, was nevertheless fundamentalexpanded this beginning into a theory of perception and of language, and since then has extended it into the foundation of a doctrine of 'institutions.'\" Alsberg published a rewritten and updated version of the argument of his Menschheitsrätsel in English in 1970, under the title In Quest of Man: A Biological Approach to the Problem of Man's Place in Nature (Oxford and New York: Pergamon Press, 1970). At present, Gehlen's work is represented in English only by Man in the Age of Technology (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980), a translation of Sozialpsychologische Probleme in der industriellen Gesellschaft (Tübingen: Mohr, 1949), which was later reissued as Die Seele im technischen Zeitalter (Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1957). For more on Blumenberg's relation to Gehlen, see parts 4 and 5 of this introduction and note x. g. One twentieth-century philosopher to whom a comparison would be illuminating is, of course, Heidegger, who also (following Kierkegaard) gave Angst a central position in his structure of thought but did not ground his understanding of it in man's unique biological status, as Blumenberg suggests we should do; nor did he legitimate myth, or culture in general, as a means of avoiding it, as Blumenberg does. Blumenberg's key passage on this aspect of Heidegger's thought, which is on p. 110, ends: \"[Humanl life is the result of a long history of congruence between [man's] environment and 'signification'congruence that is only shattered in its most recent phase. In this history, life itself continually deprives itself of an immediate relation to its abysses, to what would make it impossible, and thus refuses to obey the summons of its terrifying 'authenticity.'\" For Blumenberg's relation to another recent philosophical anthropologist, Arnold Gehlen, see note f, above, and note x, below (and corresponding text).\n\nPage xxxix\n\nh. P. 45 below. i. In the paper cited in note c, above, Blumenberg describes Cassirer's Subaanzbegriff und Funktionsbegriff of 1910 (translated as Substance and Function [LaSalle, Ill.: Open Court, 1923]) as a work that has \"still not been fully dealt with and has been largely, and unjustly, forgotten\" (p. 164). j. The key passage on the status of the \"positions\" that are \"reoccupied\" is found in The Legitimacy of the Modern Age, pp. 466 467. k. On the peculiar term pregnance, see translator's note i to part I, chapter 3, below. l. The renewed interest, recendy, in the idea of social evolution (see the references in Jürgen Habermas's \"Toward a Reconstruction of Historical Materialism,\" in his Communication and the Evolution of Society [Boston: Beacon Press, 1979] ) is aimed at explaining major social changes, such as (in Habermas's version) from neolithic societies to early civilizations, from early to \"developed\" civilizations, and from the latter to the modern age (ibid., pp. 157 158). This is quite different from Blumenberg's interest in explaining the survival power of mythsthrough all those changesas a result of the millenniums of testing and selecting out that they have undergone. And when Blumenberg describes culture, including science and technology, as being subjected to a process of selection in place of human individuals, he does not relate this process to comprehensive social systems; what he has in mind here, as being subject to selection, are specific techniques, theories, and \"institutions.\" It is interesting to note that in both myth and the field of science and technology there is a \"variety-generating mechanism\" at work (a large number of storytellers, a large number of theoreticians and tinkerers), in which one could see a randomness analogous to that of mutations in biological evolutiona randomness for which there is no evident analogue on the level of the evolution of ''social systems.\" Habermas himself regards the process of learning, which may contribute constructively to new social formations, as central, so that despite the large leaps or discontinuities between the stages of this kind of \"social evolution,\" it still seems to have more in common with the Enlightenment model of cooperative progress than it has with a Darwinian mechanism of selection.\n\nm. P. 165 below. (Emphasis added.) n. A bold statement that comes closer to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century philosophies of history than we might expect from the author of The Legitimacy of the Modern Age. The statement differs from those philosophies by making it clear that the asserted progress is not relative to all possible human values, but \"by this criterion,\" that is, by the criterion of contributing to the capacity for survival; and it also differs from them by avoiding (by explicit reference to \"whatever else [history] may be\") the implication that this \"optimization\" is the central, essential process inthe \"meaning of\"history as a whole. o. Gehlen presented his doctrine of \"institutions\" in Urmensch und Spätkultur (Bonn: Athenäum, 1956). p. Pp. 161 162 below. On Neptunism and Vulcanism see translator's note c to part II, chapter 2. q. Cassirer, The Myth of the State, p. 280. r. Ibid., p. 282. s. Ibid., p. 183. t. In The Legitimacy of the Modern Age, p. 99, Blumenberg wrote that \"this book's concept of rationality is neither that of an agency of salvation nor that of a creative originality either,\"\n\nPage xl\n\nbut that of \"a sufficient rationality. It is just enough to accomplish the postmedieval self-assertion and to bear the consequences of this emergency selfconsolidation.\" In \"Anthropologische Annäherung on die Aktualität der Rhetorik,\" p. 124, he discusses \"the principle of insufficent reason (principium rationis insufficientis)\" that is \"the axiom of all rhetoric.\" In both cases the analogy and the contrast to Leibniz's \"principle of sufficient reason'' is explicit. u. Die Legitimität der Neuzeit, first edition (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1966), p. 60. v. This interpretation of Blumenberg's respect for 'institutions' is not just a hypothetical possibility. At least one quite painstaking reviewerH. L. Ollig, S.J., writing in Theologie und Philosophie 56 (1981): 148 152was unhappily convinced of its correctness. w. Part II, chapter 1. This and all the remaining quotations in this section can he found in the eight paragraphs beginning on p. 168 below. x. The passage in Blumenberg's \"Anthropologische Annäherung an die Aktualität der Rhetorik,\" quoted in note f, continues: \"With Gehlen's absolutism of 'institutions,' anthropology returns, in a certain way, to its point of departure in the model of the social contract [Staatsvertrag]. The discussion of this anthropology has not yet settled the question of whether that fateful return is inevitable.\" The account of \"institutions,\" in relation to rationality, that is given in this book must clearly represent a major contribution to that discussion. y.

This extension of the Kantian idea of freedom as autonomy is a consistent development of the approach to Kant and to ethics that Blumenberg first sketched out in \"Ist eine philosophische Ethik gegenwärtig möglich?\", in Studium Generale 6 (1953): 174 184.

Kafka to Max Brod, August 7, 1920 a To those who are bored with this success, the mastering of reality may seem a dream that has been dreamed out, or was never worth dreaming. It is easy for the cultivation of boredom and discontent to commence when one accepts as a matter of course, and no longer takes note of, the conditions under which life experiences its difficulties in what are now only marginal problems. Cultures that have not yet, achieved mastery of their reality continue to dream the dream and would snatch its realization away from those who think they have already awakened from it. If one turns from the professionally (or even professorially) depicted terrors of the present, and all the more of the future, to the past and to its past [die Vorvergangenheit \"the pluperfect\"], one encounters the necessity of picturing an initial situation that serves the purpose of the old status naturalis [state of nature] of philosophical theories of culture and the state. This concept of the limit toward which the extrapolation of tangible, historical features into the archaic tends can be formally defined in a single designation: as the absolutism of reality. What it means is that man came close to not having control of the\n\nPage 4\n\nconditions of his existence and, what is more important, believed that he simply lacked control of them. It may have been earlier or later that he interpreted this circumstance of the superior power [Übermächtigkeit] of what is (in each case) other [i.e., not himself] by assuming the existence of superior powers [Übermächten]. What justifies us in using this limit concept is the common core of all currently respected theories on the subject of anthropogenesis. Whatever may have been the appearance of the prehuman creature that was induced, by an enforced or an accidental change in the environment it inhabited, to avail itself of the sensory advantage of raising itself upright into a bipedal posture and to stabilize that advantage in spite of all its internal disadvantages in the functioning of organsthat creature had, in any case, left the protection of a more hidden form of life, and an adapted one, in order to expose itself to the risks of the widened horizon of its perception, which were also those of its perceivability. It was, as yet, no forward thrust of curiosity, no gain in pleasure from the broadened horizon, no exaltation at acquiring verticality, but merely the exploitation of a favorable opportunity for survival by avoiding the pressure of selection, which would have driven toward irreversible specialization. It was a situational leap, which made the unoccupied distant horizon into the ongoing expectation of hitherto unknown things. What came about through the combination of leaving the shrinking rain forest for the savanna and settling in caves was a combination of the meeting of new requirements for performance in obtaining food outside the living places and the old advantage of undisturbed reproduction and rearing of the next generation, with its prolonged need for learning, now in the protection of housing that was easy to close off from the outside. The formula of \"hunters and mothers\" sums up the overcoming of the loss of the old state of concealment in the primeval forest. What is here called the absolutism of reality is the totality of what goes with this situational leap, which is inconceivable without super-accomplishment in consequence of a sudden lack of adaptation. Part of this is the capacity for foresight, anticipation of what has not yet taken place, preparation for what is absent, beyond the horizon. It all converges on what is accomplished by concepts. Before that, though, the pure state of indefinite anticipation is 'anxiety.' b To formulate it paradoxically, it is intentionality of consciousness without an\n\nobject. As a result of it, the whole horizon becomes equivalent as the totality\n\nPage 5\n\nof the directions from which 'it can come at one.' Freud described the complete helplessness of the ego in the face of overwhelming danger as the core of the traumatic situation, and saw in the child's early demand for love the compensation for such helplessness. Ferenczi found the correlate of the phylogenetic transition from the sea to the land in the ontogenetic birth trauma, and no speculation is required in order to recognize the repetition of this fundamental situation in the emergence from the primeval forest's concealment into the savanna as well. If we have to seek man's origin in the category of animals that 'flee,' then we can comprehend that before the change of biotope all signals that set off flight reactions would indeed have the coercive power of fear but would not have to reach the level of a dominating condition of anxiety, as long as mere movement was available as a means of clarifying the situation. But if one imagines that this solution was no longer, or no longer constantly, successful, then from that point onward the situations that enforced flight either had to be dealt with by standing one's ground or had to be avoided by means of anticipation. The transition from reacting, in the present, to pointlike stimuli, to the ongoing state of maximum excitement and suspense [Höhstspannung] of the organic system in a state of alarm makes the creature dependent on means by which to master dangerous situations, even when they cannot be avoided. The focus of the state of excitement and suspense necessarily becomes less specific as the ambiguity and indefiniteness of the data defining the situation increase. This produces a readiness for an attitude of expectation, of feeling one's way forward, that refers to the entire horizon. It has its functional value precisely in not depending on determinate or already determinable actual threats. In turn, while this attitude to reality can be maintained episodically for longer periods, it cannot be managed indefinitely. The generalized excitement and suspense must always be reduced, again, to the assessment of specific factors. Put differentlyspecifically in the language of the neurologist Kurt Goldsteinthis means that anxiety must again and again be rationalized into fear, both in the history of mankind and in that of the individual. This occurs primarily, not through experience and knowledge, but rather through devices like that of the substitution of the familiar for the unfamiliar, of explanations for the inexplicable, of names for the unnameable. Something is 'put forward,' c so as to make what is not present into an object of averting, conjuring\n\nPage 6\n\nup, mollif"
