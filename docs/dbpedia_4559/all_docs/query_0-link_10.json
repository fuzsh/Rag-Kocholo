Miller and François Louis Until very, very recently, mentioning “antiquarianism” to most historians would elicit expressions of disdain and, even more tellingly, disassociation. If the achievements of modern scholarship represented the gains of disciplinarity and “expertise,” antiquarianism represented for many its opposite: prescientific polymathy and dilettantism. Over the past two decades, however, perceptions have changed. Now, as the history of scholarship has burgeoned into a respected field of academic study, antiquarianism has emerged as an important precursor of the modern historical sciences and their associated museum culture. How, exactly, antiquaries and antiquarian learning are to be positioned within early modern intellectual life remains a real puzzle. There is still no such thing as a familiar received history of antiquarianism that could help us resolve it, and even our knowledge of the meaning of antiquarianism itself remains tentative. This dim recognition of the important and troubling proximity of the old antiquarian and the modern historian is made still more complicated when we turn from European antiquarianism, for which of course the term was “coined,” to non-European antiquarianisms.1 In this volume we restrict ourselves to a comparison with Chinese antiquarianism, probably the most substantial of these traditions (though we acknowledge that were we able to undertake a still wider comparison, we might emerge with different emphases). As with the European tradition, in China too we confront a discontinuity between past and current practice, not least as a result of Page 2 →the intense international scholarly exchange of the past century. But in addition we need also to reflect on whether “antiquarianism” is meaningfully applied to China at all. So, let us then begin with some definitions, however general, in the interest of establishing a common analytical framework. What was antiquarianism? It is a European word adapted for a European phenomenon. Strictly speaking, it refers to the investigations of the past conducted by antiquaries, scholars who studied antiquity through its material remains as well as through its texts (it was the material angle that was new). In the European Renaissance, the antiquarius was the lover of antiquity, and antiquitates referred to the systematic and comprehensive study of the ancient world—typically synchronic rather than diachronic in structure. Religion, law, calendars, clothing, games, food—all these were reconstructed, often painstakingly, from the flotsam and jetsam of the past. Most of these scholars worked from textual remains, but some made the move to join the study of words to that of things. Antiquarianism was a form of study which contemporaries saw as related either to history or to pedantry (depending on their perspective). When was antiquarianism? The practice and, indeed, the term of art have their origins with Marcus Terrentius Varro in the first century in Rome. And the roots of his practice may go back still further, as far, even, as fifthcentury BCE Greece. Chronologically, the great age of antiquaries is coincident with the European Renaissance. Indeed, it has even been suggested that the definition of the Renaissance as the revival of antiquity really means a revival of the study of antiquity. Some of the most interesting antiquarian scholarship was done in the seventeenth century. But it is the eighteenth century, with the widening social appeal of antiquarian scholarship, that saw its greatest cultural diffusion: in literature, architecture, and style. With transformed, and often marginalized, social prestige, the practice continued on into the nineteenth century and in less obvious ways continues still. Who were the antiquaries? In the Renaissance, the group was closely connected with the humanist movement and, especially, with philology, the study of texts in their historical context. In a way, one could view philology and antiquarianism as complementary, each in its own way adding up to the recovery of the whole that was ancient civilization. Indeed, one could argue that the relationship between philology and antiquities, or the material remains of the past, lies at the heart of humanism. There were many points of entry to this material; one of the\n\ngreatest antiquaries of the fifteenth century was a self-taught merchant from Ancona, Page 3 →Cyriac, while his contemporaries Poggio Bracciolini and Biondo Flavio were part of the dominant cultural-industrial complex of the time (the Roman Curia). By the second half of the sixteenth century, the impact of the revolution in legal study offered a whole other explanatory matrix for studying the past. Here, texts offered the best access to the past. At the same time, medical doctors, not least because of their necessarily empirical practice (they had to cure patients, not just write about Galen), drew close to the equally autoptic approach of antiquaries. In these cases, the encounter with the object is the site of meaning. Philologists, lawyers, and doctors are the dominant professional identities of antiquaries in the seventeenth century. And the Europe of the antiquaries was the Republic of Letters. While not all its denizens were antiquaries, this network of letter-writing and, sometimes, visiting scholars facilitated not just the study of the past, but bringing the past home. Indeed, by the eighteenth century, the social range is extended still further; travel, the commercial revolution, and mobility of taste made the study of antiquity an object for fashionable engagement. Indeed, “neoclassicism” was the high-water mark of the antiquarian age. Where was antiquarianism? Its European capital, at least in the very beginning, was Rome. But with the spread of what we call the Renaissance in the Italian peninsula, and then in the sixteenth century over the Alps and across the European isthmus, we find antiquarianism respected and practiced everywhere: the Elizabethan Society of Antiquaries was founded in 1595, the Swedish Riksantikvariat in 1630, and Ole Worm sent his antiquarian questionnaire to Iceland in 1638. As the antiquarian movement crossed the Alps, the past that began to be explored and even excavated was not just classical but also Gallic, Germanic, and Norse, and the “antiquity” sometimes not so ancient. With this, antiquarianism laid a foundation for medieval studies, a fact that only becomes apparent in the second half of the seventeenth century. How antiquaries worked was decisive to their future: they studied objects along with texts, sometimes using the objects (often those with inscriptions) to explain problems in surviving texts, and sometimes using texts to help make sense of the objects. In trying to understand what the ancient world actually was, antiquaries found in objects a clear window onto the daily life of an admired past when self-consciously crafted texts offered, paradoxically, only dark panes. The objects presented themselves in the light of day, but silently: they could not speak for themselves. And thus it was only in a constant hermeneutical movement from text to object and object back to text that meaning could emerge. At the heart Page 4 →of antiquarian practice, then, lay comparison. And comparison, in turn, required a collection of things to compare, whether texts or coins or inscriptions or vases. Once compared, the results could only be shared out across the Republic of Letters by textual descriptions included in, or appended to, letters. It is important to emphasize that most learning was still book learning; even those who worked on “things” had necessarily to immerse themselves simultaneously in literary remains and, finally, many of the practices—“rules” is probably too strong a term—developed for studying objects were derived from the practices of philology (the comparison of vases, for example, from the collation of manuscripts). But these outlines are tentative. Though the past two decades have seen an extraordinary recovery in the scholarly study of antiquaries and antiquarianism, our cup remains more than half empty: we still know too little about, especially, the “who,” the “where,” and the “what.” Moreover, the interactions between antiquarianism and history, and also between antiquarianism and what we might term historical psychology, are extremely complex. Antiquarian scholarship is obviously related to historical understanding, but fixing this relationship means being very careful about the meaning of history as well. Antiquarians make a major contribution to the “sense of the past” in early modern Europe, but we cannot generalize about how. Similarly, we know that the study of the past shapes the way people feel about past and present. But the history of emotions is still a young discipline and, to take one example, our understanding of why and how objects have such a great power to move us remains very limited. That we know even this much testifies to the lasting impact of Arnaldo Momigliano's groundbreaking work on antiquaries in the 1950s and 1960s, and to the fact that any serious coming to grips with European historical culture in the centuries between Petrarch (d. 1374) and Peiresc (d. 1637), or even Winckelmann (d. 1768), cannot avoid antiquaries and antiquarianism.2 Nevertheless, the reason why interest has long remained so paltry is that\n\nantiquarianism disappeared as a self-conscious practice when the modern cultural sciences came into their own. Of course, even in its heyday there were critics mocking either the antiquaries' myopia (Chardin's painting of Le singe antiquaire is exhibit A) or their pedantry and gullibility (Johann Burckhard Mencke's 1715 De charlataneria eruditorum)—what the antiquaries themselves called “curiosity” and “precision.” Later, the advent of an entirely new organization of knowledge between the middle of the seventeenth and the middle of the eighteenth centuries (between the publication of Descartes' Discours Page 5 →[1637] and Diderot and D'Alembert's Encyclopédie [1751]) put this type of scholarship outside even the university curriculum. Meanwhile, the widening spheres of commercial society, with their increasing number of female readers of the vernacular, opened the way toward a more sentimental, less learned, engagement with the past. This was true for people interested in the past; but where the “Moderns” ruled, the study of antiquity was pushed to the margins. Where antiquaries survived, it was in the provinces, in local history associations, in schools and archives. And even when professors slowly opened up to the kinds of practices and questions developed in antiquarian circles, there was no recuperating antiquarianism itself. The birth of “structural history” in the twentieth century did not recognize these early modern scholars as ancestors.3 Even the recent scholarly revival of interest in antiquarianism works against the grain: studying antiquaries now is like trying to get at the Inca Temple from inside the Franciscan church built right atop it.4 If the way in which the practice of history has developed in Europe has made the antiquarian heritage difficult of access, a change in perspective offers the possibility of new clarity. Among historians of China the situation is different again; less a matter of accessing a “superceded” practice—the problem of a Whig history of history is not sensu stricto a Chinese problem—than of recognizing the contours of what a Chinese antiquarianism may have been. These differential states of development may have been responsible for the absence of any comparative focus up until very recently.5 European antiquarianism has usually been paralleled to Chinese epigraphy, a field that evolved in conjunction with the collecting of antiquities and is traditionally known as jinshi xue (literally “bronze and stone studies”). Chang Kwang-chih, explaining the history of Chinese archaeology for Western readers in the 1980s, was the first to apply the term “antiquarianism” to jinshi scholarship, although a number of earlier writers had paved the way for this assessment.6 But it has only been during the past decade, with the maturing of scholarship on European antiquarianism, that a broader discussion of antiquarianism in China began and Chinese terms (such as haogu zhuyi or boxue haogu yanjiu ) were coined to capture the conceptual nature of the Western “ism.”7 Although the collecting of ancient historic materials is documented for the Han era (206 BCE–220 CE) already, the systematic investigating of ancient inscriptions and artifacts first came about in the second half of the eleventh century under the Song dynasty.8 It grew from the leisurely Page 6 →interests of a small group of intellectuals centered around Ouyang Xiu (1007–72) and Liu Chang (1019–68). Institutionalization followed only half a century later with the involvement of the imperial court. By the end of the twelfth century, not least driven by the urge to recover the cultural goods dispersed after the loss of northern China to the Jurchen, the collecting of antiquities had become an accepted elite pastime and epigraphy was recognized as a scholarly field, as Zhai Qinian's (fl. 1142) annotated bibliography attests.9 Antiquarian activity modeled on Song scholarship remained a respected form of Confucian erudition until the early twentieth century. Even the introduction of Western archaeological methods in the 1920s and the subsequent reorganizations of history and archaeology into academic disciplines did not significantly undermine its prestige.10 Like European antiquaries, Chinese scholars in the jinshi tradition celebrated the authenticity of ancient relics as an invaluable boon to their philological studies. Some of them even made it their vocation to search for forgotten steles or locate inscribed ancient bronze vessels. But they never went so far as to sponsor archaeological excavations, relying instead on the antiquities market and an ever-growing literature of collected data. They were textual scholars who were primarily concerned with epigraphy, calligraphy, philosophy, and, above all, the interpretation of the moral and political lessons of the Confucian classics. Hence they were interested in only certain types of old things, those that either contained commemorative inscriptions or were mentioned in the classics, especially the books on propriety and ritual. Descriptions of the past in terms of a broad “cultural history”—let alone daily life—were not part of the trajectory of jinshi scholarship, even though some of this\n\ncontent was in fact discussed in the historical treatises and especially in the local gazetteers. The divergent scope of jinshi xue and European antiquarianism rests in part on the different status accorded to antiquity in the two scholarly cultures. While the antiquarius who professed his love for antiquity was in the cultural avant-garde in fifteenth-century Italy, in premodern China the love of antiquity (hao gu) and the need to learn from it had been basic scholarly tenets ever since Confucius (551–479 BCE) declared them to be ideals of his own.11 What was novel in the Northern Song period (960–1127) was not a revived interest in antiquity per se, but the manner in which that distant past was retrieved. Song scholars recognized that a systematic study of material remains from antiquity could provide a direct and authentic connection to that idealized age of the model Page 7 →sages and moral exemplars. Such a material connection to a normative antiquity was more easily established than we might think today, because the framework of late medieval correlative cosmology allowed for time to be seen as an entity that could be transcended physically.12 But the systematic turn to antiquities was also the result of an invigorated scholarly skepticism concerning the correctness of classical commentary and even the authenticity of certain classics. This skepticism, in turn, was due to the unprecedented state sponsorship of classical learning that went hand in hand with the rebuilding of the Chinese empire, bringing about a new kind of scholarly elite (shi daifu). Ever since its Song beginnings, the study of ancient bronzes and steles was thus more than just a matter of historical scholarship: it touched on a scholar's social identity, was closely related to his personal life experience, and “awakened deep emotions.”13 Song antiquarianism spurred an ever-growing appreciation of antiquities as symbols of cultural refinement and social class. Antiquity-collecting became especially pronounced after the thirteenth century, when the Mongol conquest redefined the social identity of Confucian scholars. By the early fourteenth century, the scholars of the Song era had come to embody a lost ideal. Collecting antiquities (including relics of the Song era) offered one way to reconnect to them. Moreover, one strand of Song scholarship particularly close to early antiquarian activities, the so-called Neo-Confucianism (daoxue) of Cheng Yi (1033–1107) and Zhu Xi (1130–1200), was officially declared orthodox knowledge and tested in the state examinations. Song jinshi scholarship, too, was disseminated, memorized, and emulated through collecting antiquities. Ownership of cultural relics (and its cognates: the need for classification and the rhetoric of the collector's passion) now mattered more than historical research. Over the course of the Yuan (1271–1368) and Ming eras (1368–1644) connoisseurship in antiquities and knowledge of Song antiquarian publications became a status-defining aspect of good taste.14 It was only between the seventeenth and early twentieth centuries that the work of Song Confucian scholars was seriously questioned and classical antiquity became a renewed focus of intense scholarship. Eventually the new so-called Han learning and the movement of evidentiary scholarship (kaozheng xue) reinvigorated both the connoisseurial and philological strands of antiquarianism, modernizing the field of jinshi xue into one that, like the work of the Song epigraphers and collectors, again compares more readily to European categories of antiquarianism, where broad philological inquiries are directed to recover material aspects of a distant past.15 Page 8 → But how closely do we need to compare jinshi xue to European antiquarianism at all? How necessary is it to take the measure of this Chinese antiquarian tradition bearing in mind the categories, cautions, and horizons that Momigliano and his heirs have brought to the study of the Western tradition?16 Is this not, the critic might object, just another form of insidious “Orientalism,” reading the Other in “our” own language and thus inevitably a “colonizing” act? Leibniz can help us here. In a letter of 1708 he characterized China as an “Oriental Europe.”17 He meant by this that there was a community, or continuity, of interests and history binding together East and West. The Europeans had developed better solutions to some things, the Chinese to others. Hence his equally stunning phrase, describing contact between Europe and China as “un commerce de lumière.”18 Leibniz believed that Europeans could learn from Chinese as much as Chinese could learn from Europeans. This is our view as well.19 What we hope to do in this volume is to use the European and Chinese traditions to illuminate each other. So, for\n\nexample, to the historian of European antiquarianism the Chinese focus on words and texts rather than the objects on which they were inscribed casts in sharp relief the European turn to material meaning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (such as it was). We might be aware of the predominance of philological approaches in early modern Europe, but still might need a cross-cultural comparison to realize that the material turn cannot be taken for granted as in any way “evolutionary” but was a move that must be explained. By the same token, the importance of the emotional experience of antiquity in China will come as a shock to the Europeanist used to seeing poetry and philology, feelings and science, as separate faculties. Moreover, its persistence in China will puzzle Europeanists who no longer consider the insights of artists or authors (Piranesi or Sebald, for example) relevant to the work of studying past material cultures.20 For the Europeanist, the centrality in China of a synchronic approach to the past alongside a diachronic one (the model of the “Dynastic History”) suggests that the prominence of a Thucydidean over a Herodotean model cannot be read as natural.21 Finally, there is the crucial example of “ecclesiastical history,” the document-rich account of the life of the godly community in the world, which established a model for the priority of evidence to rhetoric.22 Its role may have hitherto been slighted by scholars of European historiography, but for Chinese historians—and those familiar with Chinese history—the role of empirical, documentary scholarship in upholding religious ritual and ideology would have seemed obvious, Page 9 →as in the two famous investigations of ancient bells at the Northern Song courts of Renzong (from 1034) and Huizong (from 1104).23 On the other hand, for the historian of Chinese intellectual and cultural history, the discovery of the breadth of the European antiquarian tradition but also its relatively precisely researched scholarly anatomy suggests a massive research potential for even a relatively well-defined form of antiquarianism such as jinshi xue.24 There is still a considerable dearth of studies that examine individual scholars and their local networks, especially for the centuries after the fall of the Northern Song dynasty.25 But comparison also may lead to ways in which the boundaries of Chinese antiquarian learning might be pushed beyond jinshi xue and elegant collecting. Like antiquaries in Europe, but unlike jinshi scholars of the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries, Song scholars emphasized the empirical gathering of a broad range of new material data. The three Hong brothers, for instance, not only collected bronze vessels and discussed ancient writing from steles and bronzes, they also studied ancient and foreign coins; in addition the youngest brother, Hong Mai (1123–1202), spent the greater part of his life collecting and critically reviewing reports on strange and seemingly supernatural occurrences, some 2,700 of which have survived as his celebrated Yijian zhi (Accounts of the Listener).26 To these scholars, the material traces of a distant past held a mystical allure and demanded to be explored just like strange natural phenomena. Such a broadening of inquiries will also put in relief the inevitable limitations of the Western concept of antiquarianism. Defining China's jinshi xue primarily through categories of historiography, philology, and empirical exploration, for instance, results in a picture of scholars engaged in constructing and maintaining a Confucian orthodoxy. This overlooks not only the less positivist dimensions of Chinese thought but also the impact of an increasingly commercialized society and the heterogeneous makeup of the Chinese elite in the late Ming and Qing era. As the contribution by Bruce Rusk in this volume reminds us, reading the discoveries of antiquities both in cosmological and political terms were an essential part of antiquarian scholarship well into the early modern era. The research project of a comparative cultural history was Karl Lamprecht's vision for the Institut für Kultur- und Universalgeschichte he established at the University of Leipzig.27 “Comparative history” occupied a central place in the historical thinking of Marc Bloch, in particular, in Page 10 →the 1920s.28 As practiced, it aimed to reveal questions which were occluded from within a single discipline's, or culture's, one-point perspective. It aimed at the open-ended and suggestive, rather than the conclusive and comprehensive. Indeed, Max Weber, who a century ago made the great compelling case for comparison, was at pains to insist that it was a precision tool—for “splitting” not “lumping.” Writing about a comparative history of ancient agrarian regimes, he explained that\n\nsuch a comparative study would not aim at finding “analogies” and “parallels,” as is done by those engrossed in the currently fashionable enterprise of constructing general schemes of development. The aim should, rather, be precisely the opposite: to identify and define the individuality of each development, the characteristics which made the one conclude in a manner so different from that of the other.29 Comparison, in other words, only superficially resembled a pairing of “like” with “like.” In fact, the pairing was designed to determine precisely what made the two “unlike.” One could then proceed to the more interesting question—for Weber, at least—of why they were unlike. After Momigliano, and especially after the work of Wilfried Nippel, Weber emerges clearly as a historical thinker, his emphasis on the “why” showing how comparison could yield a picture that was contingent, always located at a specific point in time and space.30 China and Europe both developed keen historical sensibilities. These have been much studied. But there also developed, in both cultures, a much more specific, and much less studied, openness to using the material remains of the past alongside of texts as sources for its understanding. In Europe this past was identified with antiquity, and the expansion of the historical methods for antiquity's systematic reconstruction soon came to be called “antiquarianism.” In China, too, this new opening was identified with antiquity, the three preimperial dynasties Xia, Shang, and Zhou; and the name for its study, “bronze and stone studies” (jinshi xue), even hinted both at the materials worked on and at antiquity, since bronze and stone were the most enduring media to transmit ancient texts. But jinshi xue remained a subgenre of the study of the classics while Antiquitates eventually became closely identified with the study of material remains. To provide a possible path to explain such differences, we propose to expand the comparative framework beyond the study of antiquities. Page 11 →One area the present collection of essays has chosen to examine is the notion that antiquarianism is closely related to empiricism, and thus to contemporary practices in natural history, medicine, and travel writing. In this respect, we might consider antiquarianism as a specific feature, even a manifestation, of “late humanism” in Europe. Although little studied yet, the best jinshi scholars often also exhibited a great interest in empiricist methods, not just in the Song but in the Ming and Qing eras as well. For instance, Yang Shen (1488–1559), one of the most authoritative jinshi scholars of his time, also wrote the groundbreaking history of the Yunnan border region, where he conducted geographic fieldwork and even translated texts from the local Bo language (described in Leo K. Shin's essay). Fu Shan (c. 1606–84) was not only a groundbreaking medical author (see Nathan Sivin's essay), but also an influential calligrapher who spent decades arduously locating and studying ancient steles and scripts.31 And Cheng Yaotian (1725–1814) not only conducted botanical fieldwork in close consultation with the Confucian Classics but also traditional antiquarian research (see Georges Métailié's essay). In his attempts to reconstruct ancient music he went as far as experimenting with the casting of ancient-style bronze bells based on texts and antiquities. This kind of experimentation had not been done since the early twelfth century under the Song dynasty. Exact parallels to this can be found in Europe, especially, perhaps, in recent work on the history of natural history in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.32 In Antiquarianism and Intellectual Life in Europe and China the comparison actually runs on two axes: between Europe and China, of course, but less obviously also between competing historical approaches within each culture. The cross-cultural comparison necessarily operates in a synchronic mode, while the implied intracultural comparison is framed diachronically. From this perspective, this book is a “prequel” to Momigliano & Antiquarianism: Foundations of the Modern Cultural Sciences.33 That collection of essays, edited by Miller, examined one of Momigliano's prescient asides, that the decay products of antiquarianism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were the modern cultural sciences: art history, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, and history of religion. The focus of that book was not antiquarianism per se, so much as its relationship to successor disciplines and, of course, to Momigliano himself. In this one, we focus on a period when antiquarian inquiry took place in the context of the humanist discovery of the world, and when it was a response to new information emerging from the ground, from the heavens, and from other parts of the globe. Page 12 →\n\nRecognizing antiquarianism's disposition to breadth in an age prior to disciplinarity, we have begun with the question of origins. How can trained historians adequately grasp a form of historical inquiry made redundant by the very forces which, ultimately, have shaped the modern historical profession? The first essay, Miller's “Writing Antiquarianism,” offers a sketch of the history of antiquarian scholarship in Europe from its early modern heyday through its modern transformation. It reveals how nineteenth-century archaeologists studied seventeenth-century antiquaries and how they conceived of this inquiry in a dialogue with those emerging, and successor, cultural sciences. Greater familiarity with the history of this cultural practice could enable modern historians to uncover lost points of contact—and deviation. The essays that follow suggest steps toward opening up the history of antiquarianism in both Europe and China. They represent attempts to probe the ways in which the study of antiquity, the perspective of antiquitates, and the methods of the antiquary insinuated themselves into a wider—even global—world of early modern learning. For antiquarianism helped shape inquiries into ancient remains, religion, and philosophy, as well as contemporary botany, medicine, poetry, and ethnology. Phenomena which might seem unrelated may emerge, from the perspective of a new history of antiquarianism, as more closely connected. Given this penetration of antiquarianism and antiquarianizing deep into the surrounding learned landscape, the reader of these essays would not be mistaken to feel that at its fullest extent “antiquarianism” had something to do with nearly every aspect of intellectual life.34 Yet, at this fullest extent antiquarianism would not mean much of anything, and certainly not the study of “antiquity.” (This is not so different in scope from the difficulty of establishing the relationship between “antiquarianism” and “archaism” in the context of Chinese art.) Thus, it could be argued that properly situating antiquarianism in its cultural matrix effectively diminishes its own distinctive significance. For all these reasons we have been careful here to begin with the secure, narrower definition. But it would be a self-defeating blindness to cling only to the safety of a narrower definition in the face of the obvious relationship between the study of antiquity through its physical remains and other facets of observational culture. This is, after all, just another way of making the point that in premodern times almost everything could be, and was, taught in relation to the classics: history, rhetoric, ethics, art and natural science. There clearly was something distinctive, and important, about this specifically Page 13 →materialized form of historical inquiry. Examining it in a raking light, lifting it slightly out of its context and isolating the phenomenon, is necessary if we are to see its features in highest relief. Only then can we proceed to assessing the full scope of historical understanding and practices available to the cultures we are examining. And so this book can be read as something of a proposal and something of a provocation. As a proposal, it offers a way of thinking about early modern European culture in its own terms: with the role of study of the past, and students of the past, near the center, as indeed it was. As a provocation, it suggests that if we could adequately explain the relationship between the antiquarian study of the past on the one hand, and poetry, art, religion, natural philosophy, ethnology, ethics, and history on the other, we would be much closer to understanding what it meant to think like an early modern European. The still bigger provocation might then be to turn this same spotlight on China. Alain Schnapp's sketch of the contours of a “comparative antiquarianism” suggests that the meaningfulness not only of the past, but of material culture as a portal into that past, can be found across time and place. He himself fights shy of a “structuralist” antiquarianism à la Lévi-Strauss, and so do we; such a project would have to be conducted on very different terms and by a very different équipe. Nevertheless, that we find so much in common in their attitudes toward antiquities among Egyptians of the Middle Kingdom and the English of modern Middlesex suggests the richness of the soil yet to be turned over. Schnapp himself, in drawing attention to the sacred character of much ancient antiquarianism, casts a light on the tremendous, latent power of old things and their study. His broad comparison raises a broad question: is there a parallel trajectory that proceeds from Mesopotamia and Egypt not West, to Greece and Rome, but East, to China? Finding this parallel narrative was the El Dorado for seventeenth-century comparatists such as Athanasius Kircher, but does its rejection mean that we must always look for the roots of antiquarainism to grow only Westward? Schnapp's broad survey of the meanings of an immersion in the broken remains of the past is followed by Jan Papy's case study of the antiquarian humanist Justus Lipsius (1547–1606). Papy shows us the ways in which\n\ntextual study could incorporate as well as filter the worlds of archaeology and ethnography c. 1600. Knowledge derived from experience with physical remains and that derived from travelers to the Western Hemisphere and the Far East was woven into that derived from the reading Page 14 →and editing of ancient texts. Papy is especially alert to Lipsius's efforts to find practical utility in antiquarian knowledge, whether in terms of external (architecture or military tactics) or internal goods (ethics).35 Miller's “Comparing Antiquarianisms: A View from Europe,” in which a historian of the European antiquarian tradition picks out four moments and styles of convergence between European and Chinese antiquarianism, suggests one possible mapping of this encounter. It shows how scholarly comparison can function as a form of translation, exposing incompatibilities (Weber's “splitting”) as well as parallels (the “lumping”). Its mood is interrogatory, assuming neither tradition to be canonical for the other, but using each to expand our potential understanding of a phenomenon which seems to have, at least at its root, a common foundation in how people relate to their temporal condition. In short, its question is as much “Why is the shape of European antiquarianism not like China's?” as it is “Why is the shape of Chinese antiquarianism not like Europe's?” The essays that follow, grouped under four distinct headings, are intended as suggestive encounters between European and Chinese antiquarian modes. The realms they cover—the relationship to the artifact, the natural world, the variety of human customs, and the history of religion—are, indeed, significant. But they are not at all meant to be exhaustive. The two essays in Part 2 (“Authenticity and Antiquities”) explore the question of forgery from the perspectives of the two different cultures, but also of different epistemologies. Christopher Wood asks us to re-examine the meaningfulness of the Renaissance turn to material evidence.36 If this has been canonized as the Ur-moment of antiquarianism, his reminder that things were as opaque and as open-ended as texts has several major consequences. First, it problematizes the idea of the Renaissance as an epistemological break. Second, it problematizes any simplistic understanding of how material evidence bore within itself any notional certainty. Third, by juxtaposing “substitutional” and “archaeological” approaches and arguing for their coexistence, at least in the earlier Renaissance, he has articulated a new argument for the power of imaginative uses of the past. Rather than accepting the Whiggish distinction between science and art, which has done so much to blacken the reputations of Cyriac of Ancona, Pirro Ligorio, and Piranesi, among others, Wood shows us how normal the mixture of the imaginative and the archaeological really was. Very similar forms of credulity can be seen among pioneering antiquaries Page 15 →in Song China, who were slow to replace transmitted images of ancient objects with the archaeological data they recovered. Learned credulity became even more pronounced after the Song period, when Song antiquarian scholarship itself became the origin of a new chain of substitutions in the form of both newly printed editions of original Song books as well as faked Song studies. The transmission of pictures and paintings seems to have been little affected by early antiquarian attempts at precise description as they retained the authority granted to textual transmission. The traditional substitutional mode of understanding artifact production thus remained normative. Such comparison confirms that it is the European aspiration for a “purely” archaeological, unemotional technology that is the novum. Learned credulity is well evident in the three Chinese cases of forgery presented by Bruce Rusk. His essay on the philological dimensions of forgery culture in Ming and Qing China lays open how a sprawling collectors' market shaped and often corrupted antiquarian learning, and how authoritative much of that antiquarian scholarship has been right into the twentieth century. Aside from commercial and status pressures, Ming and Qing credulity also depended on the age-old Chinese conviction to see all occurrences as cosmologically correlated. There were no such things as chance discoveries of ancient texts—they were all good, bad, or fake omens. Within a portentological mode of artifact production materiality, time, and space all become relative, so that even a record of the physical destruction of a thing cannot preclude its reconstitution and transmission later, especially if the object was believed to have been made by a historically eminent figure. Jinshi scholarship, especially its more recondite forms developed during the Ming era, only partially demystified magical objects.\n\nThe essays in Part 3 (“The Discovery of the World”) suggest ways in which antiquarian approaches were at the root of much contemporary exploration of the natural world. Nancy G. Siraisi, following from another of Momigliano's casually tossed-off asides, explores the antiquaries' empirical turn through the parallel history of medicine. And here, she finds a number of humanistically oriented medical doctors making the same move toward the study of ancient material culture that is more familiarly found among nonmedical antiquaries. Her chief example, Wolfgang Lazius (1514–65), is especially interesting because in his case, unlike that of, say, Girolamo Mercuriale, a colleague of Panvinio in the Farnese circle, or Andrea Bacci, there was no medical value to his antiquarian investigations. The improvement of physical, mental, or public Page 16 →health was not Lazius's goal. Though these practical benefits could indeed accrue—as Lipsius himself demonstrated—Siraisi shows that antiquarian production by medical doctors could just as easily reflect contemporary fashion or the demands of patrons. At this remove from utility, the example of Lazius becomes a case study in the history of taste for histories.37 The following three papers examine Chinese scholars who employed their classical training to advance a special branch of natural studies known as the “investigation of things” (gewu). Nathan Sivin comments on the different professional environments of physicians in early modern China and Europe. He sees the major differences in the Chinese absence of an organized medical profession and medical university education. Yet, physicians in China shared the same classical education with all members of the scholar elite, even if civil service, for whatever reasons, was not an option for them. Medicine was thus closely connected to classical learning and physicians, though often low in political rank, were closely enmeshed in the intellectual community. Kenneth J. Hammond looks specifically at the scholarly networking that bridged different fields of scholarship among the Ming elite. He examines the exchanges between two of the most prominent figures in Ming intellectual history, Li Shizhen (1518–93), the author of the massive Ming materia medica, and Wang Shizhen (1526–90), the most celebrated poet of his time, who composed a preface for Li's compilation. Hammond's close reading of Wang's preface, composed over a ten-year period, demonstrates the realization among late Ming scholars that Daoist alchemy may have been at the origin of pharmacological studies, but that the true contribution of Li's scholarship lay not in his metaphysical speculations but in an analytical methodology that corrected earlier errors often on the basis of direct observation. Wang, a leading advocate of archaism, indeed saw parallels here to his own studies on the history of poetry. Two centuries later, as Georges Métailié's essay shows, evidentiary scholars had appropriated the empirical approach of Li Shizhen into traditional classical studies and shed much of the Daoist as well as Neo-Confucian elements still present in the Ming texts. Cheng Yaotian's (1725–1814) evidentiary studies to identify plants mentioned in the classics reveal a particularly striking example of how Qing classicists could move toward an antiquarian-style philology. Cheng, who interviewed farmers and collected plant specimens and seeds from various regions in China, develops a unique form of botany. Unlike Li's materia medica, Page 17 →which was intended as practical knowledge and remained firmly embedded in the tradition of healing, Cheng's studies ultimately took the ancient classics as their main referent. In this antiquarian approach Cheng closely resembles Lazius. Similarly, the essays in Part 4 (“Antiquarianism and Ethnography”) connect the antiquarian study of ancient religion with the study of living human practices. Noel Malcolm looks closely at the learned encounter with Islam in early modern Europe, and Leo K. Shin provides an initial survey of several Ming scholars engaged in the research of non-Chinese peoples. Malcolm's closely argued study serves a broader methodological purpose. It reminds us that the origins of a critical history of religion cannot reflexively be laid at the door of antiquarianism or of ethnology. For the early modern study of Islam shows us something different again: a case study in the resistance of European learned culture to a real engagement with another, competing religion. Firsthand accounts did not dissolve myths or disabuse prejudices. His conclusion, on the contrary, that the antiquarianism of the ethnographers blocked the antiquarianism of the scholars offers a spectacular vantage point on to the question of how Europeans actually came to know China. The attitudes of Chinese Confucian intellectuals toward foreign cultural practices had a particularly complex\n\nhistory. For Ming scholars, the Mongol occupation of China in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the close interaction between Central Asian and Chinese officials at court, and the state sponsorship of the Tibetan Buddhist clergy since that time all provided for a situation radically different from Europe. But besides the foreigners to the north and west who organized into states and posed formidable military threats, Ming China was also in contact with numerous non-Chinese peoples along the southern frontier into whose lands Ming culture began to infringe. Leo Shin probes the writings of a diverse group of Ming Confucians on non-Chinese peoples in the South to see how scholarly interest in the ancient past intersected with an increased awareness of human diversity. Ultimately, despite the firsthand accounts and attempts in translating local history, none of the Ming scholars was able to overcome classical stereotypes of cultural superiority. Yet, for the study of noncanonical ancient texts such as the Shanhai jing, scholars like Yang Shen may be said to have devised a form of ethnographic antiquarianism that was historically motivated. The concluding section makes something of a return to the points broached by Schnapp. For at a certain moment, the study of religion, Page 18 →especially as it changes over time, becomes another way of meditating on the encounter between the temporal and transcendental. And in this context, histories of religion can serve as surrogates for wider cultural self-definition. The essays in Part 5 all engage with this theme. Joan-Pau Rubiés explores the place of study of Indian and Chinese religion in debates that he locates at the heart of the European Enlightenment. With histories of religion transposed into philosophical history, antiquarian investigation emerges as a form—perhaps the Ur-form—of cultural history. D. E. Mungello's essay on the Rites Controversy reviews the collaboration and conflicts between Chinese classicists and European missionaries. Paired with Rubiés's essay it suggests the internal cultural limits to just this sort of investigation. Not every kind of exploration can be accommodated, and some forms of inquiry are less manageable than others. Martin Mulsow's essay, which concludes our volume, shows us how explosive this problem can be when not managed, or when not manageable. Looking at the late seventeenth-century Dutch humanist Antonius van Dale (1638–1708), Mulsow asks whether it was antiquarian research or broad philosophical history that most seriously damaged the delicate balance of seventeenth-century apologetic ancient history. He shows that the deeper Van Dale and his circle plunged into the details of ancient Greek and Roman religion, the less they were able to control the implications of their research. Like his exact contemporary Spinoza, the power of Van Dale's critique derives not from the invention of a new polemical tool, or even a new polemical spirit (this differs from Spinoza), but in pursuing a traditional line of research with the latest knowledge and most scrupulous commitment to truth. Mulsow leaves us with the thought that whether Van Dale was a libertine or not, his scholarship represents the liberation of antiquarianism from apologetics. This marks the beginning of an “objective” Altertumswissenschaft but also the possibility of “objective” facts being harnessed to polemical projects that had as their aim the desacralization of history. With these twin “objectifying” developments, antiquarian scholarship emerges as a constant point of reference for a self-consciously secular modernity. When Momigliano published “Ancient History and the Antiquarian” in 1950 he launched the modern study of antiquarianism. His polarity between the diachronic narrative of political events written by historians and the synchronic study of the structures of society by philologists and antiquaries has proved heuristically valuable.38 Fifty years later, Benjamin Elman remarked on the “long-standing” dichotomy within Chinese historiography between diachronic “annals” and synchronic “treatises,” Page 19 →and noted that early modern Chinese examination candidates thought in terms of this dichotomy.39 What, then, might a Chinese version of “Ancient History and the Antiquarian” look like? And what would it mean for the history of Chinese historiography? Craig Clunas, citing Elman, has drawn a line from the thematic content of the treatises in the Ming History (Ming shi) of 1645–1735 to the thematic content of the Cambridge History of China.40 Without either Elman or Clunas referring to antiquarianism, both gesture provocatively at the longue durée of a historical approach that shapes our present-day practice without our even knowing it.\n\nNOTES 1. Alain Schnapp organized with Lothar von Falkenhausen, Tim Murray, and Irène Aghion an international research project dedicated to a “Universal History of Antiquarianism” which included a year at the Getty Research Institute in 2009–10, a conference entitled Traces-Collections-Ruins: Towards a Comparative\n\nHistory of Antiquarianism, and a collection of papers.

Momigliano's nine, and soon to be ten, volumes of Contributi alla storia degli studi classici offer a treasure trove for the student of the study of the past.

Miller Fifty years ago Arnaldo Momigliano lamented, “I wish I could simply refer to a History of Antiquarian Studies. But none exists.”1 If there is still no single-volume history of antiquarianism, many, many pieces of this puzzle have been assembled. Already eight years ago Joseph Connors created an online bibliography of early modern antiquarianism of around 680 titles.2 Some of the heroes have gotten monographic treatment by now—Ligorio, Panvinio, Orsini, Scaliger, Cotton, Cassiano, Peiresc, Selden, Caylus—while the majority, of course, have not—Cyriac of Ancona, Camden, Pignoria, Worm, Mabillon, Bianchini, Barthélemy, to name but a few. We know something of who the antiquaries were, and something therefore of the history of antiquarian scholarship, but it is still far too early to write that monographic study. Even more, with all that we have learned, we still know almost nothing about the history of the history of antiquarian scholarship. Momigliano, whose “Ancient History and the Antiquarianism” was not a history of antiquarianism and did not generate any, did nevertheless succeed at inspiring a whole generation of scholars to work on the history of scholarship.3 But with all that there was to do, this question of the history of the history of history was, understandably perhaps, neglected. Some might not even have been aware of it as a question. But Momigliano surely would have been. For his own practice of the “history of historiography” brings to mind the image of the snake swallowing its tail: the historian of today writes about how historians of the past were shaped by what they read and where they lived—and his own work is necessarily Page 28 →transformed by the encounter. At what point does the one touch the other? At what point does the practice of antiquarianism shape the writing of the history of antiquarianism? And at what point does writing the history of antiquarianism affect the practice of history? These are questions we need to answer.4 Fifty years ago, when Momigliano wanted to underscore how neglected antiquarianism was, he signalled this by noting the absence of any ready-made history of it. Ironically—though, as ever, with an exquisite perspicuity—the volume that Momigliano pointed to as a second-best answer to his question actually provides the best one to our own.\n\nA Morphology of Antiquarianism Carl (or Karl) Bernard Stark's Handbuch der Archäologie der Kunst—whose first part only, Systematik und Geschichte der Archäologie der Kunst (1880), was completed before the author's death—is not a well-known book.5 Nor is its author well-known, either. Both should change. Momigliano already hinted that this is an extraordinary work, providing not only a summary of how and who studied antiquities, but also a history of the study of those studies.6 Stark's work, as the title suggests, also lies on that fascinating fault line separating and connecting the old “antiquarianism” from the new “archaeology.” Since this semantic frontier is pregnant with implications for any modern grappling with the antiquarian past it is something that we will have to consider here as well. But as we plunge into Stark's scholarship we also discover something very interesting, if not entirely surprising. For the first real historian of antiquarianism was almost perforce a historian of material culture and cultural history. How these fit together then suggests something, I think, of how they might fit together now. So, let us begin then with some first attempts to explain the meaning and history of antiquarianism. This situates us in the landscape of the Handbuch, a purely pedagogical genre that thrived in Germany and only in Germany (what it means that French schoolboys learned about antiquity from novels like Barthélemy's Voyage du jeune Anacharse [1788] while Germans read things with titles like Lehrbuch der griechischen Antiquitäten [1858–75] cannot yet be gauged). But the advantage of working with this sort of text is clear: because its intent is to present to the beginning student a comprehensive survey of a field at a given moment, it affords the later inquirer with a\n\nready-made guide to a whole scholarly world. Page 29 → Stark wrote at least seven monographs on ancient Greek art and history and a thick collection of essays was posthumously published with the telling title Lectures and Essays from the Field of Archaeology and Art History.7 In addition to his own Handbuch, he also collaborated on Karl Friedrich Hermann's four-volume Lehrbuch der griechischen Antiquitäten.8 This might be a good place to start because its introduction begins by defining “Alterthümer, antiquitates, archaiologia” as a means of reaching back to grasp ancient man, embracing “all the appearances and expressions of his life and his activities at a certain point in time.”9 According to Hermann, adding the study of literature “in its fullness” transformed “Alterthümer” into “Alterthumskunde or Alterthumswissenschaft.”10 In this new conception, antiquities only constituted a small part, though precisely marking the point of engagement with past circumstances of life (“so haftet doch gerade diesen vorzugweise der Gesichtspunkt einer Beschäftigung mit vergangenen Zuständen an”). And for this, Hermann referred to the early modern locus classicus, Francis Bacon's The Advancement of Learning (1605, Pt. 2, chap. 6), which defined Antiquitates as “relics of history, as if some fragments rescued from the shipwreck of time” (“Antiquitates sunt reliquiae historiae, quae tanquam tabulae e naufragio temporum ereptae sunt”)—itself, as so many have noted, paraphrased out of the preface of Biondo Flavio's Italia Illustrata.11 These sources—Hermann refers to monuments of antiquity (“Denkmäler des Alterthums”)—were either passed down through literary transmission or through actual material survivals. Hermann calls them “eyewitnesses and remains of the past” (“autoptische Zeugen und Reste der Vergangenheit”). Such material reminders include inscriptions, medals, implements, and images. But, and this marks an important turn of the argument, while all these antiquities (“Alterthümer”) served as sources and means to an end, they did not exhaust their fullest meaning and importance. And even, he writes, where this “monumental” Altertumskunde shared the name of Antiquitates with Archaeology, “it had actually through the connection to general Art History gained a new direction.”12 Hermann does not dilate on this point. But Stark, who edited Hermann's Handbuch before proceeding to write his own, made explicating the turn from antiquitates to archaeology by way of art history his chief task. Stark began by explaining that Art-Archaeology, “or the science of the visual arts of the peoples of classical antiquity” (“Die Archäologie der Kunst, oder die Wissenschaft von der bildenden Kunst der Völker des klassich Alterthums”) is an important part of classical Altertumswissenschaft, Page 30 →“or classical philology” in the widest sense, and thus belongs to the field of Philology.13 Archaeology was a way into the spirit of the past, but Stark made clear that he saw it as an “application” of the philological and even natural scientific research method in order to grasp “the Spirit of Antiquity in general,” and in particular the stylistic development of art.14 Philology was, in the nineteenth century, the great polydisciplinary integrator. As its chief spokesman, August Boeckh, proclaimed from his chair in Berlin in 1822, the realm of Philology included “the most important notions to be investigated present in the very nature of the oldest tribes; expressed in the individual parts of ancient cults as in the appearances of images.”15 Similarly, Ludwig Lange, another professor, used an inaugural lecture at Prague to declare philology the science whose task was to research “the spirit of both the classical peoples” (Greeks and Romans),16 while Alexander Conze had used his, at Vienna, to locate archaeology at the crossing of classical philology and art history.17 This recognition that images had something important to say about accessing the spirit of past times seems to have reached consciousness—or at least become a commonplace—by the middle of the nineteenth century. Boeckh drew an exact parallel between the philology of words and of images. The history of classical art, he wrote, which was for him part of philology, could not be separated from knowledge of Western art monuments. He went on to suggest the creation of a “comparative cultural history of all antiquity” as a chief task for Philology.18 Interestingly, Goethe, otherwise such a staunch proponent of world literature, is discovered by Stark to have emphasized that these expectations of classical philology could not be extended to extra-European antiquities. They were, to be sure, interesting (his word was “curiosities”), but not helpful for Western cultural self-\n\nformation.19 Asking about the place of Archaeology relative to classical Philology, as Stark does in his second section, shows how narrow the conception of Archaeology had already become (and which, presumably, Stark hoped to change). In the introduction to this volume we have talked about the very close, even genetic, relationship between the study of words and the study of things. Today, we might locate the key moment in the work of Christian Gottlob Heyne in the 1760s and 1770s.20 Stark, however draws “prooftexts” from the work of Boeckh and F. A. Wolf in the first third of the nineteeth century, each of which emphasize the broad commitment to “the reconstruction of the whole life of the peoples of classical antiquity,” to cite the former.21 But through what? Stark offers two different Page 31 →avenues, the first being the medium of transmission itself and the second the various functions that objects performed. Stark begins with medium-as-material. These included written remains of the past, whether on paper, parchment, stones, clay, wood, ivory, metals, whether in literary works or magic or children's things, official acts or wills or names of the dead. Then there were remains that did not utilize speech or writing, but functioned through “örtliche Fixierung”—space as a primal key—or chemical signature, or weight, or color, or form. Moreover, Stark continued—and all of this is quite brilliant—even textual material that was transmitted could be studied by the student of the past in terms of, or through, the material form of that transmission, such as the material on which the inscriptions were carved, or papyrus rolls, wood, coins, textiles, or the inks utilized. He noted one could add architectural works as a form of inscribing of the human in the landscape and, in general, “the man-made changes to the earth's surface of land and water, high up and in the depths, through man-made or substantially altered natural objects, such as food remains, pigments, and oils.” In other words, the record of Cultura was itself a language that could be deciphered.22 Stark identifies both a literary and a monumental philology, and suggests that this latter became identified with archaeology once “art” was added to the mix. On the frontier between these approaches, Stark argues, stand the auxiliary sciences—he mentions in particular Diplomatics, Epigraphy, and Numismatics, because they were wordrelated material culture studies. Indeed, Stark's argument about medium-as-material seems born out of reflection on the workings of these historische Hilfswissenschaften. What Stark does not state here—but which he refers to elsewhere—is that these Hilfswissenschaften were developed as skills by antiquaries in the seventeenth century. Thus the antiquarian synthesis of word and object marked the path from philology to archaeology.23 The second approach to material remains was not to emphasize the medium of transmission, but rather function, whether in language, religion, science, art, state, cult, private life, or technology, among others. Here Stark followed Otto Jahn's argument that the “essence” of a scientific treatment was that it focused not on the object so much as on the reason for the thing being called into existence.24 This gave a decisive role to archaeology since it was only through the scientific study of remains that this “function” could be assessed.25 Thus, here too materiality mattered—even “function” could not be assessed independently of a discipline he described as “the discipline for the representing of Page 32 →ancient lives” (“des antiken Lebens repräsentirende Disciplin”). “Also the inscription-stone, writing tablet, coin, and papyrus roll which in antiquity served as manuscript leaves in their external form, in the distribution of writing, the relationship to related imagery and finally in the form of characters themselves, call for an archaeological treatment.”26 This vision actually extended beyond Archaeology as it was narrowly construed in Stark's own time, and certainly beyond the received view of antiquarians, however respectful of their achievement he was. Archaeology, thus, could embrace both the specific and the general perspective, the individual, or pointilist inquiry, and the broadly contextual. As if comparing one kind of philology to another, Stark suggested that archaeology could by studying art do what philology achieved by studying literature: it could breathe life into the past and capture its spirit—as opposed to some dry kind of annotation. Archaeology offered a synthesizing, second-order opportunity. It was a way of seeing, rather than a set of protocols for sifting evidence. Citing Otto Jahn, Stark concluded: “Archaeology is to us the scientific study of the important monuments of the peoples of classical antiquity according to their actual expressive means through mass, form, and color, and grounded on this the development and existence of visual arts in antiquity as a part of the whole cultural life itself. Or, in short, the\n\nscientific engagement with the visual art of Antiquity.”27 It should be clear by now that Stark's idea of archaeology, formulated so close to its origin, is very different from our own. He is concerned with hermeneutics and the evocation of lived life, ours with (typically) excavation technology and interpretation of objects. The notes to this section reveal how heavily Stark leaned on Boeckh for the idea of this new-modelled archaeology. And Boeckh, in an oration of 1822, beautifully distinguished between the realms of philology and history. The former was devoted to the historical and philosophical cognition of all antiquity—literally, “of the universe of antiquity” (universae antiquitatis). And by “universe” Boeckh explicity intended not the diachronic narrative of history (“ab historia res ex ordine temporum gestas potissimum docente”) but, rather, the whole life of ancient peoples “by parts” (“philologia omnem antiquarorum populorum vitam comprehendat eamque per partes”).28 In German, in his famous lecture course at Berlin—delivered over and over again for fifty years! —Boeckh was even more apodictic about the sovereignty of philology: “Philology is the historical construction of Antiquity,” “the Knowledge of Antiquity in its full extent,” and, even, “the knowledge of what is known.”29 History was something else, and much less interesting. Page 33 → In his pursuit of the wholeness of past lived life Boeckh represents the culmination and climax of one line of development that emerged in the early Renaissance fascination with ancient Roman texts. Another, also resumed in this turn to a material philology (Boeckh referred to “Sachphilologie”) was synonymous with Archaeology and emphasized visuality. So, Gottfried Bernhardy, in his lecture course on philology, Grundlinien zur Encyclopädie der Philologie (1832) defined Archaeology as the “Kunstwissenschaft der Alten.”30 Obviously, this would be a line that would lead back through Winckelmann, Piranesi and Caylus to artist-antiquarians like Ligorio, but also forward to Jacob Burckhardt, a student of Boeckh's who became an art historian. Stark was aware that it was possible to identify this broad Classical Archaeology with Cultural History. But, instead, he preferred to link “Culturgeschichte” to the study of costume, manners, and material culture; to human history as natural history. In this, he explicitly followed the interpretation of Gustav Friedrich Klemm (1802–67). But while generally sympathetic to the potentially encyclopedic character of a cultural history which paid so much attention to the material world, Stark, whose own interest lay more in the direction of philology than natural history, specified that archaeology was not just about materiality, but about art made matter. For him, “art” separated natural from human history.31\n\nA History of Antiquarianism According to Stark, the ancients used the words archaiologia and antiquitates to refer to their science of past things. For the Greeks, the former term referred to things so old that they no longer continued to live in the present. These archaia, according to Stark, included peoples, spaces, political forms, ways of fighting, and lifestyles. Art materials were part of this general set of remains. And “The same concept of the narration of a past in-itself-completed-life of the people” is what the Romans meant by Antiquitates.32 Already in antiquity, Stark wrote, the term antiquarius referred to an involvement with words and writing, and this was preserved in the medieval use of the term to mean manuscript copyist (and the modern association with rare book dealer).33 The link between study of monuments and the special artistic remains of antiquity—res antiquaria—emerged in Renaissance Rome. The first such modern to be called an Antiquarius was Cyriac of Ancona (fl. 1430); the first to create an institution dedicated to Page 34 →its recovery was Pomponio Leto, who founded the Accademia Romana (c. 1460); the first to use it in the title of a book was Andreas Fulvius, Antiquitates Urbis (1527).34 By the beginning of the eighteenth century it could refer to an entire, existing corpus of learning: J. A. Fabricius's Bibliotheca antiquaria (1713). The “History of Archaeological Studies” constituted the third part of Stark's book, and is what Momigliano must have had in mind when he described Stark's as the best extant history of antiquarianism. It is divided into four chapters: “The beginnings of archaeological studies in the 15th and 16th centuries in the spirit of the Renaissance,\n\n” “The archaeology of art in the seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth century under the domination of antiquarian interests: pioneers of the scientific foundation,” “The science of ancient art grounded on the philosophy of beauty and on general history: Winckelmann and his followers (1755–1828),” and “The last fifty years of archaeological studies: the greatest expansion and scientific direction of the study of monuments.” For the beginning, Stark's key figure was Pirro Ligorio. This is important, for Ligorio's great achievement according to the two best modern students of sixteenth-century antiquarianism was in refocusing attention on material remains and visual corpora—opening up the path to art-archaeology later seized upon by Winckelmann and celebrated by Stark.35 Stark's account differs markedly, and for the better, from great prior accounts of the history of scholarship, such as Wachler's at the beginning of the nineteenth century, in his attentiveness to manuscript corpora. The emphasis on Ligorio's key role brings this home: “The greatest and most extensive” collection, he writes, “was not published, or in a very mutilated way only.”36 It was only because Stark approached past scholarship as scholarship that someone like Cyriac of Ancona or Ligorio, who lived on through manuscript collections only, could matter so much. The seventeenth century was the century of the antiquaries. The received view, beginning from the age that deified Winckelmann, was to look down on the century of Kunst- und Wunderkammern. But Stark's closer look showed him something else. “Even today we are guided in the greater part of our knowledge of monuments by the publications of that age…Minor archaeological sources were just then sought after and pursued with great zeal and, generally, the whole breadth of the monumental world of antiquity was first assessed.”37 Stark provides a very fair, and very competent, overview of the main figures and strands in the later antiquarian tradition—Kircher, Maffei, Page 35 →the English, the French Jansenists, and the Dutch encyclopedists Graevius and Gronovius. And we must remember that much as with Momigliano four score and ten years later, there was no narrative for Stark to fall back on: it had to be pieced together through primary research. The key figure in Stark's historical account was Peiresc. He hails him as “the great Peiresc,” “one of the most universal men of modern times, the first archaeological critic, important more through his letters and personal communication than through writings. In him was united for the first time in Europe the breakthrough of the coming study of nature with literary erudition and art sensibility.” And Stark noted, too, that he lived—and still lived—under an unlucky star, an Unstern that affected also his manuscript Nachlass, “which even today is still not fully exploited.”38 We could say that a measure of how right Stark got the antiquarian tradition is just how precisely he got the importance of Peiresc. By comparison, Stark devotes a paragraph to Kircher, a paragraph to Maffei, a long paragraph to Cassiano dal Pozzo—which was surely unusual at the time, given that Lumbroso had published his Notizie only five years earlier—and five pages to Peiresc alone. This was more than he allotted to anyone else before the glorious age of Winckelmann (thirteen pages) and Goethe (seven pages). Stark's survey of Peiresc's life is as detailed as anything published between Gassendi's Vita of 1641 and Henri Leclercq's biographical entry in the Dictionnaire d'archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie (1939).39 It would be hard to summarize Peiresc's achievement more succinctly than did Stark. The great and enduring importance of this man for archaeology lies precisely in his universal scientific position, that universal history [was] to him equally in combination with ethnography and geography the goal for the study of monuments, as a prejudice-free, empirical and experimental study of nature; exactly these studies he gave leave to consider with a sharp, comparing, proof-driven observation of the object as a necessary condition.40 Ever perceptive, Stark recognized that comparison drove Peiresc's studies.41 And Stark also caught the importance of the East for Peiresc, but in a fascinating window into the late nineteenth-century German map of the East, he redescribes the Near East as a Greek, rather than “Oriental” or even “Levantine” cultural space (in this he overweights the role of Cyprus for Peiresc).42 Page 36 →\n\nStark pointed to the remains in Carpentras—he even mentions the number of manuscript volumes (eightytwo)—and identified which materials are found in which volumes, concluding that “the influence of Peiresc extends into all the important antiquarian works of the age, which he selflessly promoted.”43 Jacob Spon, in many ways Stark's hero for turning attention toward the monumental and aesthetic, “had,” Stark wrote, “in the spirit of Peiresc brought the entire field of monumental sources into his vision,” adding an especial concentration on Greek inscriptions as Peiresc had for oriental materials.44 Mabillon, Montfaucon, and Caylus were others who cited Peiresc's work from time to time, and the latter two devoted enough attention to him as to suggest that they viewed him as something of an ancestor. As late as 1820, C.A. Böttiger, a close collaborator of Goethe's, in his introduction to the first (and last) volume of Amalthea oder Museum der Kunstmythologie und bildlichen Alterthumskunde (1825) called Peiresc “the first Archaeologist” and offered that he and his successor, Spon, “actually began Archaeology.”45 Having traversed the semantic landscape of antiquarianism in the first two parts of his Handbuch and the human landscape in the third part, Stark was able to reflect with greater clarity on what he meant by the terms “antiquarianism” and “archaeology.” “Nowadays,” he wrote, “we expressly separate Antiquitates from Antiquity and the Antiquarian from the Archaeological—or, we designate a certain part of Archaeology specially as the antiquarian, which includes representation of the technology as well as the manner of living.” The Roman category of Antiquitates referred to the “total narrative of the way of living, institutions, and manners,” and was divided up in various ways, as in the great summae of the late seventeenth century, by Gronovius and Graevius. But even when studying monuments—what Stark calls “special archaeology”—this antiquarianism was not archaeology because it never included the perspective of the aesthetic.46 It bears remembering that Stark's career coincided with the vast nineteenth-century projects of collecting and documenting large bodies of ancient inscriptions, both Latin and Greek. His sense of the power of antiquarianism, of its reach, and also of its limits, reflects this contemporary activity. What makes the case of Stark so valuable and interesting is that his own conceptual language is in fact refined by historical study. His whole distinction between antiquarianism and archaeology, and the significance in it of visual culture and art, is itself built on the work of Spon. In other words, in reconstructing the history of antiquarianism Stark discovered Page 37 →that past practitioners had actually formulated principles that remained valuable—but which needed to be disinterred by the historian before they could be applied by the theorist. As he was willing to wear both hats he was able to grasp these forgotten insights. Jacob Spon, a doctor from Lyon, had coined the term “archaeographia” in the preface to his Miscellanea eruditae antiquitatis (1685). He defined his neologism as “knowledge of the monuments through which the Ancients transmitted their religion, history, politics, and other arts and sciences, and tried to pass them down to posterity.” For Stark the key was Spon's emphasis on monuments.47 More extensively presented in his Réponse a la critique publiée par Mr. Guillet (1679) was Spon's answer to the person who viewed printed books as “history itself (l'histoire mesme) and inscriptions and medals as merely “monuments which serve history” (monumens qui servent à l'histoire). This was Bacon's distinction between antiquities and history, or Momigliano's between “ancient history and the antiquarian.”48 In putting the difference between him and his antagonist in these terms, Spon helped articulate a major turning point in western scholarship: the idea that things—objects, matter—constituted the building blocks of history; that words were not the only source of truth; that narrative alone was not identical with “history” but rather an interpretation of it. “For me,” Spon continued, “I say that books are not more history than medals or inscriptions, and that it is not the one or the other but the pieces from which it [history] is drawn.”49 Turning to that science of monuments which his antagonist mocked, Spon set forth the eight parts that constitued Archaeologia, or, as he preferred archaeografia, “the science of what the Ancients wanted to teach posterity about their religion, their sciences, their history and their politics, by the original monuments which they have left us.” The eight divisions he envisioned, entirely constituted by different material remains, are numismatics, epigraphy, ancient architecture, iconography (including sculpture), glyptography, toreumatographia (the study of reliefs—Spon clearly felt the need for new terms; itself a fascinating window into his sensibility), bibliography\n\nand Angeiographia, “a vast and prickly” field that included weights, measures, vases, domestic and agricultural utensils, games, clothing, “and a thousand other things whose study does not easily fit in the previous sciences.”50 If, Stark notes in the Miscellanea, one adds in (as either subordinate or interstitial) fields of inquiry such as Deipnographia (study of dining customs), Dulographia (study of slavery), and Taphographia (study of funerary Page 38 →customs), then we would indeed be dealing here with a “mixture of archaeological and antiquarian principles.” In formulating his own categories Spon drew heavily—though not as visibly as one might expect—on his fellow southerner, Peiresc.51 Most decisive is his use of Peiresc as the key figure when he needed a reply to his Antagonist's doubt that an antiquarian could do better than a reader of books: “Which he would not, therefore, have done to antiquaries of the highest order, like a Mr. de Peiresk [sic], the most universal who ever there was in these matters.”52 And then, a bit later, digressing to show “the merit of a real antiquary,” Spon quotes verbatim from a memo drawn up by Peiresc summarizing his meeting with the Netherlandish artist and antiquary Wenceslas Coberg in Brussels, on July 30, 1606.53 As a historian who read unpublished manuscripts as well as printed books, and who paid attention to the theoretical implications of the one as well as the explicit methodological pronouncements of the other, Stark was able to trace the historical impact of antiquarian scholarship from the Renaissance through the seventeenth century and on into the eighteenth-century origins of archaeology. If Spon clearly defended the value of material evidence, the next key step lay in the explicit awareness of the special meaning of objects that were “art.” From Spon, Stark turned to John Potter, an Oxford fellow and younger contemporary (1673/4–1747). He was much less sophisticated than Spon and did not talk about monuments in his Archaeologia graeca; or, The antiquities of Greece (1695–99). But, as if to prove the point, Potter's German translator Ernst Rambach did. In 1778 he added a section in which “Archaeological Investigations” are described as including not just numismatics, metrology, and paleography—legacy fields of the “old” antiquarianism just then becoming the “new” Hilfswissenschaften—but also architecture, sculpture, and painting.54 This addition precisely highlights a change in terminology between 1699 and 1778. According to Stark, despite the important achievements of the English in the sphere of ancient art—he thought theirs was the most sophisticated culture of antiquity in the eighteenth century—and those of dynamic French antiquaries such as the Comte de Caylus and Jean-Jacques Barthélemy, it was in Germany that Spon found his real heirs (we might rightly disagree with the nationalist priority dispute). According to Stark, the first push toward separating “archaeologia” from “antiquitates” was given by Johann Friedrich Christ (1700–1756) in his lectures on “Literatur oder Archaeologie der Literatur” at Leipzig. His successor, Johann Page 39 →August Ernesti, published his lectures in 1790 as Archaeologia literaria.55 At the same time, the establishment in Leipzig of a branch of the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts in 1764 put an institution's resources behind the inclusion of art in the conception of antiquity.56 But change came slowly. While in Leipzig archaeology was being focused on artistic monuments, at that same Dresden Academy, Philipp Daniel Lippert was Professor of Ancient Art and still thinking like a good seventeenth-century antiquary. “Every stone,” he wrote, “will have an explanation from Greek and Latin writers or poets. For every page, against this, will I, as much as possible, attach parallels from statues, sculptures, coins, lamps, paintings, and inscriptions, and list the authors, so that at once one has together a whole conspectus of all Antiquitates.” With this, he thought, difficult passages of ancient literature could be easily explicated.57 And yet, meanings were shifting. At around the same time (1767), Lippert's much greater collaborator, Christian Gottlob Heyne, began his lecture course on archaeology at Göttingen, published as Einleitung in das Studium der Antike in 1772. He focused Lippert's comparative approach on the description and dissection of ancient art works. Art for him was the object of archaeology, and when his lectures were eventually published ten years after his death they bore the title Archäologie der Kunst des Alterthums, insbesondere der Griechen und Römer. Not coincidentally, this was the very title that Stark chose for his own work. Writing in 1880, Stark could proclaim that “Archaeology is now the specific name for lectures on ancient Art, both inside and outside of Germany.”58\n\nBut this triumph of archaeology was bought at the price of an ever-narrowed grasp. It no longer dared refer to a general conspectus of Antiquitates or Altertumswissenschaft, but only the specific vision of an Archäologie der Baukunst (Stieglitz, 1801) or Archäologie der Malerei (Böttinger, 1811) or Archäologie der Kunst (Karl Otfried Müller, 1830). Responsible for this was: Winckelmann. And, again, a century's hindsight can only make us appreciate even more Stark's unerring feel for the history of historical scholarship. Even as Carl Justi was publishing the first of his monumental three-volume biography of Winckelmann emphasizing Winckelmann and the Beautiful, Stark was publishing his own biographical essay on Winckelmann stressing Winckelmann's roots as a “Polyhistor” who did important work on things like Merovingian diplomatica. Stark wondered of the bookish Winckelmann how it was that “this kind of so commendable detailed medieval scholarship be done by our Prophet of the Beautiful”—Page 40 →the point being that Winckelmann's position vis à vis the antiquarian tradition badly needed reassessment.59 Indeed, the recent work of Ingo Herklotz and Élisabeth Décultot on restoring Winckelmann the érudit follows Stark directly.60 Both Herklotz and Décultot have noted the relationship between Winckelmann and Peire"
