WILLSHIRE, M.D., royal 8vo. xii and 348 pp. and 10 plates, cloth, I2s ed 1880 ''Among the numerous works in the Museum Collection of Prints are many early cuts from both wood blocks and metal plates, which, though often not possessing qualities of artistic value, are of importance in relation to the history of engraving as illustrating the religious and social aspects of their time. Many of them being unique, all being scarce, and their congeners fast dis- appearing from the print market, it has been deemed advisable to bring them together and describe them under their characteristic features. ** By this means it is trusted that these early efforts in an important branch of Art may be rendered more interesting and more instructive than they could be while left undistinguished and dispersed among the general collection. '* The examples described in the present work are anonymous prints chiefly of the German and Flemish schools of the fifteen^ and the first quarter of the sixteenth century. ** It is intended that the catalogue now placed before the public shall be followed by other volumes containing the works of Masters of the same schools. \" The present Catalogue is the work of Dr. W. Hughes Willshire. « Mwy, 1879. G. W.

The work contains descriptions of some of the more rare and peculiar efforts of early wood and metal engravers, besides those of the colounsts and illuminators of the populai: religious art of this side of the Alps during the second half of the fifteentli century and the first quarter of the sixteenth century. The Museum is rich in the primitive art of the wood engravers and in that of the mamihre crtbUe and in re^lief on metal. These productions, though often more curious than beautiful, and of more archaeological than artistic value, are yet^ of course, pregnant with interest to the student of some of the more important branches of engraving. We understand that Dr. Willshire has sought to relieve the more purely technical descriptions by occasional remarks on the iconography ^ and Christian symbolism which many of the subjects strangely illustaratd,\" — The AthenoBumf Jan. 25, 1879.

A mere knowledge of English History is in onr days not safficient for the proper education of the people. Historians like Mr. Freeman are an honour to this country, and the wide study of his works will be his best reward. As an hutoriwn he is unriyalled in England ; as a poUticiaHj his mental grasp of facts is faulty. If he had followed Gibbon's example, and entered the House of Commons, his political views would have been enlarged, and he would have discovered, amongst other truths, that a strong Austhia is not only a European, but also an English necessity; a tacit Anglo-German- Austrian Alliance being the securest basis of a solid peace in Europe. A hasty expression at a public meeting about Inj>ia has unfortunately been perverted by the Conservative press. Abreges Historiques, a handy icseful series: 4707 France.
