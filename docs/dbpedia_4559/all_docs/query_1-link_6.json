Burckhardt studied mathematics in Germany and applied his knowledge to eclipse computations and to longitude determinations using lunar occultations. When Baron János von Zach was in search of an astronomer for his Gotha Observatory (Seeberg), Burckhardt was recommended to him, and he was hired to work on practical astronomy and to observe star transits. In France, Lalande had undertaken a similar search for the Observatoire de l’École militaire, of which he was director.
