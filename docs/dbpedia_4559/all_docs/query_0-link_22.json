        "text": "This page intentionally left blank\n\nThe Hanoverian Dimension in British History, 1714–1837\n\nFor more than 120 years (1714–1837) Great Britain was linked to the German Electorate, later Kingdom, of Hanover through Personal Union. This made Britain a continental European state in many respects, and diluted her sense of insular apartness. The geopolitical focus of Britain was now as much on Germany, on the Elbe and the Weser, as it was on the Channel or overseas. At the same time, the Hanoverian connection was a major and highly controversial factor in British high politics and popular political debate. This volume is the first to explore the subject systematically by employing a team of experts drawn from the UK, USA and Germany. They integrate the burgeoning specialist literature on aspects of the Personal Union into the broader history of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Britain. Never before has the impact of the Hanoverian connection on British politics, monarchy and the public sphere been so thoroughly investigated.

His previous publications include The impact of Napoleon: Prussian high politics, foreign policy and the crisis of the executive, 1797–1806 (1997) and The struggle for mastery in Germany, 1779–1850 (1998).

Hanover: the missing dimension Brendan Simms\n\nWhen Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837, the resulting end of the Personal Union with Hanover occasioned little comment. The fact that Britain had been linked to a continental European state for over 120 years was easily forgotten in a nineteenth-century world whose horizons were now very much global, imperial and naval. If the centenary of the Personal Union in August 1814 had been marked by royal celebrations, by the time of the bicentenary, the mid-Victorian fascination with German culture had been replaced by industrial and commercial competition. In August 1914, in any case, Britain’s leaders had other things on their minds. An era during which the royal family felt obliged to change its name from ‘Saxe-Coburg-Gotha’ to the anodyne confection of ‘House of Windsor’ was perhaps not best suited to an understanding of Britain’s German heritage and continental links. The British story was, after all, an ‘island story’.1 It has remained one, more or less, ever since. The importance, and sometimes the centrality, of the Hanoverian context to British history is still not fully recognised. For example, J. C. D Clark, himself an exponent of viewing eighteenth-century Britain in the framework of the European ‘ancien re´gime’, wrote nearly 600 pages on the 1750s without giving due attention to the fact that one of his major protagonists, the duke of Newcastle, was both a defender of the Hanoverian preoccupations of the crown and the most prominent exponent of engagement in Europe.2 Similarly, Kathleen Wilson and Linda Colley, despite their 1 2\n\nThus the title of H. E. Marshall’s hugely influential Our island story (1905), which was reprinted by the think-tank Civitas in 2005. J. C. D. Clark, The dynamics of change. The crisis of the 1750s and English party systems (Cambridge, 1982). For the ancien re´gime debate see J. C. D. Clark, English society 1688–1832. Ideology, social structure and political practice during the ancien re´gime (Cambridge, 1985); and Joanna Innes, ‘Jonathan Clark, social history and England’s ‘‘ancien re´gime’’ ’, Past and Present, 115 (1987), 165–200. Later Clark – reflecting the early work of Jeremy Black – did address the Hanoverian dimension briefly in Revolution and rebellion. State and society in England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (Cambridge, 1986), pp. 77–82.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nBrendan Simms\n\ninterest in Toryism and Whig radicalism critiques, and in colonial and popular issues, make virtually no reference to Europe, in Wilson’s case, or Hanover, in both instances.3 Likewise, John Brooke’s as yet unsurpassed biography of George III passes over the fact that his subject was also the ruler of a German state, and at times a very committed one.4 On the other side of the Atlantic, both Theodore Draper and Fred Anderson tend to caricature the Hanoverian connection and its role in British grand strategy.5 None of David Armitage’s various discussions of the British problem and composite monarchies, which stress the need to consider Scottish, Irish and imperial contexts, take the Hanoverian dimension into account.6 There are exceptions. Foreign policy was not his forte, but J. H. Plumb’s unfinished study of Walpole was seized of the importance of the international and particularly the Hanoverian dimension to early eighteenth-century British politics.7 More recently, both Julian Hoppit and Paul Langford – who wrote an excellent though now inevitably dated textbook on eighteenth-century British foreign policy – give some prominence to the Hanoverian dimension.8 There are also the general syntheses of Jeremy Black, who has contributed so much to our understanding of foreign policy and the role of Hanover in British politics before 1760.9\n\n* There is, of course, a considerable and growing specialist literature on British foreign policy and the role of the Hanoverian Electorate. Ragnhild Hatton’s biography of George I – revealingly subtitled ‘Elector and king’ – remains the standard work. Graham Gibbs has explored the role\n\n3\n\n4 5\n\n6 7 8\n\n9\n\nKathleen Wilson, Politics, culture and imperialism in England, 1715–1785 (Cambridge, 1995); Wilson, The island race.

Uriel Dann has looked closely at the Personal Union during the wars of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years War (1740–60). The implications of the Hanoverian connection for British ‘high politics’ have been explored for the early eighteenth century by J. M Beattie, J. J. Murray and – rather obscurely – H. J. Finke. More generally, the period before 1760 has been covered in numerous articles and books by Jeremy Black, while British foreign policy in the era of the American Revolution has received masterful treatment from Hamish Scott. Finally, T. C. W. Blanning has highlighted the importance of Hanover during the Fu¨rstenbund and Regency crises of the 1780s.10 More recently, there has been a modest increase of interest in the Hanoverian connection led by younger scholars such Andrew Thompson, Nick Harding, and the editors, all of whom have contributed to this volume.11 Andrew Thompson’s work on the early eighteenth\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSee J.

Nicholas Harding has written a systematic study of the role which the Personal Union played in eighteenth-century British political thought and discourse. Brendan Simms drew attention to the periodic centrality of Hanover in British strategy, and the importance of a Hanoverian faction in British high politics, during the crisis of 1806. Torsten Riotte has just published the first comprehensive study of the role of Hanover in British policy throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period. The Hanoverian dimension brings together the work of these and other scholars working on the Personal Union or related fields and integrates their findings into the history of eighteenth-century Britain as a whole. It draws upon material – much of it never before used in this context – from both British and German archives. The volume is structured in such a way as to allow both chronological and thematic access. Chapters 2 to 5 will cover the entire period from 1714 to 1837, but they are also intended to allow authors to organise the narrative around a particular individual or theme, such as Walpole, the elder Pitt, the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleon, and the final stages of the Personal Union. The more thematic chapters are designed to cover the full length of the Personal Union, but generally contain a specific narrative ‘spine’. In putting the Hanoverian dimension back into British history, this collection attempts two things. First of all, by filling in many gaps in our knowledge of the Personal Union, it makes an ‘additive’ contribution to the secondary literature. For example, the chapter by Torsten Riotte on George III and Hanover after 1760; Hamish Scott’s systematic analysis of the role of Hanover in French strategy; Thomas Biskup’s discussion of the intellectual legacy; Nicholas Harding’s dissection of the role of Hanover in the development of British republicanism; Clarissa Campbell Orr’s investigation of the dynastic ramifications; and Christopher Thompson on the Personal Union after 1815, all put the spotlight on neglected areas. Secondly, this volume is the first step in a collective ‘substitutive’ project to persuade eighteenth-century British (1792–1815). Dynastische Verbindung als Element au enpolitischer Entscheidungsprozesse (Mu¨nster, 2005). Jeremy Black has also kept up his interest in the area. Recent publications include: ‘International relations in the eighteenth century: Britain and Poland compared’, Diplomacy and Statecraft, 13 (2002), 83–112; Black, ‘Hanover and British foreign policy 1714–1760’, English Historical Review, 120 (2005), 303–39; and Black, ‘ ‘‘George II and all that stuff.’’ On the value of the neglected’, Albion, 4 (2004), 581–607.\n\nHanover: the missing dimension\n\n5\n\nhistoriography to take more account of the Hanoverian dimension in general. In the first chapter, Jeremy Black highlights the controversial nature of the Hanoverian succession in 1714. He reminds us that although Britain’s links to the continent long predated the Personal Union, the Hanoverian connection was a major high-political and foreign-political bone of contention during the twenty-year ascendancy of Robert Walpole. It was, moreover, an issue ‘in the context not of an established constitution with clear conventions but of the testing out of new arrangements’. Hanover became a focal point around which the ‘national interest’ could be articulated. As Bob Harris shows, this had profound impact on the development of the British ‘public sphere’, particularly in the absence of other issues around which opinion could polarise. There was a huge outpouring of anti-Hanoverian pamphlets, prints, ballads centred on but not confined to London. The quality of the material varied, but some of it was very sophisticated. Harris notes that ‘Europe and European power politics [were] at the very centre of public attention’ in the period before 1760, and in this context the question of Hanover gained particular popular salience. Indeed, Harris writes that at times ‘the issue of Hanover and its influence dominated press and political debate, for long periods completely overshadowing consideration of other political issues’. Attacks on the Hanoverian connection not only served to highlight the corrupt and foreign nature of the Walpolean oligarchy, but also enabled opposition writers to burnish their own patriotic credentials. Alongside, this ‘low’ debate, there was also a vibrant and no less impassioned ‘high’ debate in the sphere of political thought. Nicholas Harding’s chapter documents how attacks on the Personal Union were driven by a British republicanism of both ancient and recent provenance. Here the Hanoverian link was seen as a continental absolutist Trojan Horse, designed to smother English liberties with the help of a standing army and German mercenaries. In some cases, such as that of Bolingbroke, this camp shaded into that of Jacobitism; but it also embraced many radical Whigs. In the republican critique, the Lutheranism of the Hanoverians was akin to popery and thus of no comfort. Yet as Andrew Thompson stresses in his chapter on confessional dimensions, the Protestantism of the Hanoverians was what made them attractive to the political nation: contemporaries, after all, spoke of the ‘protestant’ not the Hanoverian succession. Religious solidarity with the victims of popish aggression was also an important part of British foreign policy, particularly in the 1720s; Thompson sees this as an example of British ‘soft power’ in the eighteenth\n\n6\n\nBrendan Simms\n\ncentury. The Hanoverian link was thus a central plank in the defence both of British domestic liberties and the European balance of power against attempts to erect a universal monarchy. Here Thompson adds a new spin to the debate on the British ‘confessional state’, initiated by Jonathan Clark some twenty years ago. The eighteenth century also saw the emergence of strong intellectual ties. Hanover, as Thomas Biskup shows in his chapter, played a central role in the growth of British involvement in the ‘international republic of letters’, by producing a ‘unique framework for scholarly curiosity’ focused on the new electoral university of Go¨ttingen. This compensated for the weaknesses of British academic institutions particularly in the fields of natural sciences, oriental studies and philology. Interestingly, it was the British who were the mere ‘collectors’ and ‘gatherers’ while the Hanoverians concentrated on analysis. In this way, as Biskup puts it, ‘Go¨ttingen . . . helped England to make sense of her own imperial experiences’. Here the Hanoverian connection and the imperial project were not contradictory but complementary. This theme is picked up by Brendan Simms. He shows that the Elder Pitt’s relationship to Hanover provides a valuable prism through which to view his political career and strategic vision. A complex, sometimes paradoxical and yet essentially coherent picture emerges. Pitt undoubtedly used the Hanoverian stick to beat his political rivals and to massage his ‘popular’ constituency; this stance earned him the hatred of George II and nearly cost him high office. And yet it was the very fact that Pitt – as Newcastle so starkly put it – could ‘do the King’s business’ over Hanover that finally speeded his rise. At the same time, Pitt’s commitment to the defence of Hanover in the Seven Years War should not be seen as an opportunistic sop to George, but as part of an integrated ‘continental’ strategy against France, which was intended to secure British colonial and naval dominance through the diversion of French resources. For, as the naval historian Richard Harding explains, the European and maritime theatres of war should not – pace much of the anti-Hanoverian critique – be seen as distinct and separate, but rather as two sides of the same coin. ‘Flanders and Hanover’, he writes, ‘could not be divorced from a maritime policy. They were parts of the same policy.’ It is true that in the early years of George I’s reign, the Royal Navy was used to further Hanoverian interests in the Baltic. But by the mid-eighteenth century, Harding identifies ‘an essential link’ between the defence of Hanover, which tied down French forces, and ‘aggressive action in the Americas’. ‘Britain’s essential European interests, including Hanover’, he reminds us, came first; the shift to maritime and colonial priorities only came after 1760.\n\nHanover: the missing dimension\n\n7\n\nThroughout the first fifty years or so of the Personal Union, therefore, British strategy was obsessed with the protection of Hanover against first Russian, then Austrian, periodically Prussian and then French attack. The fear was that the king would be made, as George II put it, as ‘Hanoverian Elector . . . [to] pay for the King of England’. British ministries, in turn, feared that Britain would have to pay for the elector of Hanover at the peace agreement. It is certainly true that at key moments in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years War, French strategists regarded the Electorate as a hostage to be traded for losses overseas. Yet as Hamish Scott shows in a highly original analysis, ‘the direct military threat which France posed was consistently exaggerated by British statesmen’. Large French formations had never before operated so far from their bases and the logistical obstacles were considerable. If one also takes into account the political costs of violating the constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, French willingness to countenance the neutralisation of Hanover rather than its straightforward occupation becomes more understandable. Scott concludes that practical considerations prevented the French from applying more than temporary military pressure for most of the eighteenth century. It was only the revolutionary transformation in warfare after 1792 which changed this calculus and cleared the way for longer-term occupations under Napoleon. The accession of George III in 1760 is often taken to mark the beginning of a completely new phase in which the importance of the Personal Union was played down by a monarch who ‘gloried in the name of Britain [sic]’. It is certainly true that George III broke with the tradition of royal visits to Germany; and the Hanoverian issue lost much of the political currency it had enjoyed for more than four decades since 1714. Yet, as Torsten Riotte shows, George III took a keen interest in the welfare of the Electorate. In some ways, George was more of a German prince than his grandfather: he sought to protect Hanover not so much by Britishsponsored great-power alliances as through the institutions of the Holy Roman Empire. Riotte’s George III is therefore much more ‘German’ than the conventional picture allows. The German interests and identity of the royal family are the theme of Clarissa Campbell Orr’s chapter on the dynastic context. She adopts a broad – ‘polycentric’ – approach which looks not just at the ruler but also at the consort, siblings, offspring, their respective marriage partners and the sometimes competing strategies of the elder branch of the Guelph family. This enables her not only to stress the very contingent nature of dynastic permutations, but also to bring out the existence of a coherent Hanoverian dynastic strategy designed to promote British interests and\n\n8\n\nBrendan Simms\n\nenhance the security of the Electorate. Yet if George II – who married his daughters off to actual or prospective British allies – was relatively successful in this regard, Campbell Orr shows George III to have been a dynastic failure. He proved unable to marry off his thirteen unruly offspring in any systematic way. All the same, George retained a keen interest in the German dynastic scene. This was reinforced by the activities of his own consort, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom Campbell Orr shows to have been a quietly determined ‘lobbyist’ during the War of the Bavarian Succession. Nor did royal interest in the Personal Union die with George III in 1820. The Prince Regent and later King George IV was in close physical and political touch with the Hanoverian envoy in London, Count Mu¨nster, as the chapter by Mijndert Bertram shows. Both shared a firmly conservative outlook. At the same time, with the dispatch of the duke of Cambridge as governor general, the monarchy was represented in person in Hanover for the first time since the recall of the Prince of Wales in 1728, albeit by a cipher since Mu¨nster continued to pull all the strings from London. The links were more than just political: Bertram reminds us that Hanover functioned as a ‘bridgehead for British trade in Germany’, which received preferential, though unreciprocated, tariff treatment. Moreover, as Christopher Thompson shows, Hanover ‘remained a significant foreign policy factor’ in Britain after the Napoleonic War, and thus also played a major role in high politics. George IV was able to use his Hanoverian diplomatic and intelligence service – which by all accounts was far superior to the British one – to support British strategy and to bypass the hated Canning. Moreover, as Christopher Thompson adds as a parting shot, the Personal Union enjoyed a controversial afterlife in nineteenth-century Britain: so long as Queen Victoria remained childless, there was every prospect that her sybaritic and (allegedly) despotic uncle, the king of Hanover, would renew the Personal Union on her death. The emerging picture is of an eighteenth-century Britain which was very much a European state, strategically, dynastically, confessionally, intellectually linked to the continent. The German connection also profoundly influenced many spheres of what one might otherwise regard as purely domestic politics. Hanoverians were powerful players in British high politics not just in the early eighteenth century but, periodically, during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic period and, as the case of Mu¨nster shows, well into the second decade of the nineteenth century as well. We are also left with a strong sense of the contingency of British history. As Jeremy Black points out, it was the dynastic accident of a\n\nHanover: the missing dimension\n\n9\n\nregular supply of legitimate protestant male heirs from the Hanoverians, which spared Britain a return to the travails of the seventeenth century, and indeed the eighteenth-century wars of succession. The Personal Union, Clarissa Campbell Orr reminds us, ‘began partly and ended solely for dynastic purposes’. Had it not so concluded, Mijndert Bertram muses, the history of nineteenth-century Germany would have looked very different. For in 1866, Bismarck would have come up not only against the king of Hanover, who proved intractable enough, but also against the king of Great Britain (as he would have been). Of course, this volume can only be a first step and it is by no means comprehensive. Ideally, it should have included a systematic discussion of the Hanoverian faction at court; of the role of Hanover in the formation of British identity; and the ramifications of the Personal Union within the framework of composite statehood. These themes could only be hinted at: they require further investigation and elaboration. All this volume can hope to do is to remind historians of the importance of the Hanoverian dimension and to suggest an agenda for further research.\n\n2\n\nHanoverian nexus: Walpole and the Electorate Jeremy Black\n\nMuch of the problem in assessing the implications of the Hanoverian relationship comes from the tension between considering short periods and, on the other hand, assessing the relationship over the longer term. The former appears the most desirable approach, because it restricts coverage to a period for which it is simpler to carry out the necessary archival research. It is also flawed, however, both because it limits the experience of contemporaries and because it removes the comparative element, which is valuable for scholarly analysis, just as it was useful for contemporary debate about foreign policy. ‘Walpole and Hanover’ as a topic provides a good instance of this. While it focuses attention on the failure in existing treatments of Walpole to devote much attention to Hanover, this approach underrates the importance of considering Walpole at least in part in the light of developments after his fall from office in 1742. Not only did Walpole, from then 1st earl of Orford, maintain links with George II and also continue to influence the Pelham brothers until his death in 1745, but, in order to assess Walpole it is necessary to consider his policies in the light of the events of subsequent years as they provide a way of probing the alternatives. Hence this chapter closes in 1760. The accession of George III led, at least in the short term, to a different degree of royal commitment to the Electorate, and, certainly, to the cause of its aggrandisement, while the political parameters within which Walpole had operated – the relatively assured ascendancy of the Old Corps Whigs – came to a close. The period can therefore be seen as a unity, but it is one in which the role of Hanover has not received systematic treatment, a task that this volume valuably sets out to attempt.1 1\n\nFor earlier discussion, G.

Instead, there were different issues: at home the workings out of the Revolution Settlement stemming from the Glorious Revolution of 1688–9 but not in any linear or inevitable fashion, and, abroad, the consequences of major developments in the European system, in particular (but not only) a shift of relative power east from Western Europe as Austria, Russia and Prussia became more powerful, a situation that was readily apparent in the 1710s. The controversy that followed the accession of the Hanoverian dynasty to the British throne in 1714 was set in these contexts, and much of the problem that faces discussion about the Hanoverian dimension stems from the difficulty in distinguishing the subject from the issues arising from these changes in the domestic and international circumstances. This also helps explain why scholars have disagreed in their views, because there is no clear methodology available to address this difficulty, a point that needs to be outlined at the outset. As a consequence, it is understandable that scholars come to clashing conclusions as a result of contrasting cause-and-effect models of the relationship between Hanoverianism and the wider domestic and international contexts. My own approach differs from that of Brendan Simms. It is not that one of us is correct and the other not, but rather that differing analyses are possible, both from the evidence and from the assessment of the domestic and international contexts. To turn first to these contexts is not to ignore the role of the individual, the particular, and the contingent, but, rather, to be reminded of the complexity of the issues at stake, as well as the extent to which history did not begin in 1714, in either Britain or in Hanover, and thus the memory of earlier years had an important impact. In terms of domestic politics, the legacy was a difficult one, and there was no clear, acceptable standard of royal behaviour on which George I could model himself, nor by which he\n\n2\n\nOn this see, in particular, G. C. Gibbs, ‘Parliament and foreign policy in the age of Stanhope and Walpole’, English Historical Review, 77 (1962), 18–37; and Gibbs, ‘Newspapers, parliament and foreign policy in the age of Stanhope and Walpole’, Me´langes offerts a` G. Jacquemyns (Brussels, 1968). There is no equivalent for this period to the work of Bob Harris on the 1740s.\n\n12\n\nJeremy Black\n\ncould be judged. The last exemplary monarch in public memory was Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), and, aside from the seriously distorting perspective of mythmaking, she did not face the problems of dealing with a composite state spanning the North Sea, although opposition in Ireland during her reign had served as a pointed reminder of the difficulties of composite statehood. These were underlined in the shape of a broader ‘British Question’ under her four Stuart successors, with the additional problem of serious suspicion about their domestic intentions. William III had ‘solved’, or at least shelved, the British question through force in 1689–92, but, aside from the controversial character of his linkage of Britain to his interests in the United Provinces, William’s attitude towards his position as king aroused both concern and opposition in Britain. This led to a serious political storm in 1700 and, in the Act of Settlement of 1701, to what were intended as constitutional limitations on his eventual successors, the Hanoverians. In the meanwhile, Queen Anne (r. 1702–14) was personally more popular than William, particularly because political anxiety and anger were focused on her ministers; while she lacked the ‘foreignness’ associated with William, for all his Stuart connections by parentage and marriage, not least as a result of his foreign position and his distance from the Church of England. Nevertheless many of the political issues that had faced William in the working out of the ‘Glorious Revolution’ remained acute. This was especially true of the collective responsibility of ministers, and also of the relationships between party cohesion, policy formulation, and the choice of ministers. These issues were to erupt anew under George I, with the Whig Split of 1717.3 Although this ministerial and party division owed much to contention about George I’s Baltic policy, the constitutional problems posed, especially the relationship between monarch and minister, did not stem from this issue. Of course, looked at differently, political skill involves management within existing constraints, or shifting the parameters of the latter, however difficult, and George was unable to do either in the late 1710s. The long-term shift in the international system was the rise of Russia, Austria and Prussia. This receives most attention from mid-century, in particular with the diplomacy surrounding the Seven Years War (1756–63), and the First Partition of Poland (1772),4 but should more\n\n3\n\n4\n\nJ.

For Austria, the defeat of the Ottomans outside Vienna in 1683, and the subsequent conquest of Hungary were crucial, as were the major gains made from the Spanish Habsburg inheritance as a consequence of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14), while Russia benefited from the extent to which it, and not SaxonyPoland, Sweden or Denmark, gained from the Great Northern War (1700–21). The shift in the international system created serious and unexpected problems for Hanover, and helped ensure that, alongside the theme of Hanoverian expansionism, came that of Hanoverian security. Although interrelated, these were also different themes, and this had important implications for British foreign policy, and for the debate within Britain about the impact of the Hanoverian connection. The role of Hanover in British public debate owed much to the original character and impact of the connection. A focus on expansionism was initially part of the Hanoverian optimum that began in 1714. That was the period of bright prospects. Despite initial problems, the new dynasty in Britain rapidly overcame the attempt at a Stuart revanche in the ’15: there was certainly no equivalent to the long civil war over the Spanish succession. Britain’s ministers established, in 1716, an effective alliance with France that, while pushed hard for Hanoverian reasons, greatly lessened British vulnerability.5 They also formulated a peace plan for the Mediterranean that led to a short war that helped establish a settlement there, with a spectacular naval victory over Spain (off Cape Passaro in Sicily in 1718), which eventually helped in 1720 to give force to this plan. Hanover itself looked set to benefit territorially from the partition of Sweden’s transBaltic empire, a benefit seen not only in the gain of territory, but also in denying territories to other powers, especially Denmark, a rival in north Germany. Royal opportunism, however, helped to divide the, admittedly already very divided, Whigs, with ministers separating over George I’s expectation of support for his Baltic policy; differences over power in Britain and between George and his heir also contributed greatly to the Whig Split, the first foreign policy issue in which Walpole played a major role. This split did not stop George and his advisors from continuing with their policies, but the Hanoverian optimum ended in 1719–21, as the Stanhope–Sunderland ministry proved unable to retain or regain control of parliament. Furthermore, the bursting of the South Sea Bubble in 1720 caused a political as well as a fiscal crisis, and the attempt to 5\n\nE. Bourgeois, La diplomatie secre`te au XVIII sie`cle. Le secret du Re´gent et la politique de l’Abbe´ Dubois (Paris, 1907).\n\n14\n\nJeremy Black\n\nintimidate Peter the Great of Russia into accepting the British peace plan for northern Europe failed miserably.6 There were parallel problems within the Hanoverian ministry. Once Russian troops had advanced into Mecklenburg in 1716 there was the repeated, and reasonable, fear that they would return. Thus, the possibilities that had opened up for Hanover in 1716, when George encouraged a Russian invasion of Scania (southern Sweden) as a knockout blow against Charles XII of Sweden that would secure Hanover’s gains from Sweden in north Germany (the duchies of Bremen and Verden), were rudely replaced by fears that increased George’s need for British assistance. At the same time, the dangerous prospect emerged of hostile cooperation between Peter the Great and Frederick William I of Prussia, who was fearful of Russian strength. Rumours about this circulated widely in the late 1710s. Furthermore, the acquisition of Bremen and Verden from Sweden had proved to be not a speedy and clearly successful move but, rather, one that had led to lasting international commitments that proved difficult to limit, prefiguring the situation when Frederick the Great of Prussia conquered Silesia in 1740–1. From the late 1710s, in response, first, to Russia’s Baltic policy in the early 1720s, which threatened to exploit continued disputes over Mecklenburg, and the unsettled nature of the Schleswig question,7 and then to the Austro-Spanish alliance negotiated in 1725, there was a switch from expansionism to defence, setting a new agenda for the Hanoverian dimension of British foreign policy and for public debate. Concern about Hanover and the commitments stemming from the Electorate’s gain of Bremen and Verden led to an anxiety about Baltic developments that certainly seemed rash to Walpole, although Baltic issues were also of direct importance to Britain, not least because the Baltic was the key source of the naval stores vital for British maritime and naval strength. In response, in 1723, to pressure from George I for a promise of assistance for Sweden if it was attacked by Peter the Great, Walpole expressed his concern that competition among the ministers for royal favour ‘should transport us into very rash engagements’. He was able to offer cogent reasons which indicated his concern to frame foreign policy in terms of domestic practicality, and his sense that the latter included fiscal exigencies and the management of Parliament and public opinion, The £150,000 may certainly be had . . . I cannot but wish from my heart that this money may not be demanded . . . nor do I see how it can be employed at all by way 6 7\n\nJ. F. Chance, George I and the Great Northern War (London, 1909). W.

I wish to God we may at least for a little time remain neuters, and look on, if all the rest of Europe do the same thing.\n\nAside from also warning about the danger of Russian support for the Jacobites, who, indeed, were looking widely for assistance, Walpole was concerned that the Russian threat to Sweden would affect credit ‘as all our money matters here depend entirely upon credit’.8 However slanted, a sense of Hanover as an incubus stemmed directly from the persistent crisis of Britain and Hanover’s Baltic policy from 1716 until 1731. The resulting problem of Hanoverian security tended to arouse more ministerial concern than the French alliance. In domestic political terms, the latter was an embarrassment that in fact owed much to the wish to secure the Hanoverian succession. Nevertheless, until the parliamentary storm in 1730 over illicit and illegal repairs to the harbour at Dunkirk, the French alliance did not challenge the ministry’s conduct of foreign policy as Baltic policy was to do. If during the Whig Split (as well as at a time of later Whig divisions) the dynamic tension of interests that can be simplified in terms of Britain and Hanover became the focus of crown–ministerial relations, it was in the context not of an established constitution with clear conventions, but of the testing out of new arrangements. When, for example, MPs debated whether Hessian subsidies were a breach of the constitution, it was far from clear how assertions were to be disproved. Aside from the issue of relations with Hanover, there was also the question of what the monarch could do with other aspects of British foreign policy, especially the legality and/or acceptability of peacetime subsidies for foreign powers, whether or not these were intended for the benefit of Hanover. The unfixed nature of the Revolution Settlement had been clear from the outset, and indeed the changes in 1694–1707, especially, but not only, the Triennial Act, the establishment of the Bank of England, the lapsing of the Licensing Act, and the passage of the Acts of Settlement and Union, were in some respects more significant than the constitutional changes in 1689. This situation did not cease in 1707, nor 1714, and relations with Hanover in 8\n\nWalpole to Thomas, duke of Newcastle, 25 July 1723, London, British Library, Add.

The changes introduced, or attempted, in 1716–19, including the replacement of the Triennial by the Septennial Act, the repeal of legislation against nonconformists passed by Queen Anne’s Tory ministers, and the Peerage Bill, indicated, however, the willingness of Whig ministers to make substantial revisions. Furthermore, the restrictions on royal journeys were removed, so that George I and George II were able to make frequent visits to their native Electorate, although their duration led to criticism in Britain.9 From the perspective of George I (which is difficult to demonstrate conclusively because of the sparse nature of the sources), it was reasonable to expect the same men to provide support for his Baltic policy. This issue, which split the ministry in 1717, indicated, however, the problems of defining acceptable parameters. It was particularly difficult, in a period of rapid constitutional change, for ministers to argue that a given policy was unacceptable on constitutional grounds, not least when doing so risked serious royal displeasure. Instead, it was more appropriate to fall back on the arguments of political acceptability and prudent policymaking. This indeed was Walpole’s position: he promised the monarch parliamentary management (and thus money for foreign policy commitments such as subsidies or increases in the armed forces), but, at the same time, used the exigencies of such management to urge restraint in governmental initiatives and demands. This was a far from easy process, but Walpole’s defeat of his major political rivals in 1720–2 rested on the crucial governmental need for parliamentary support and, in turn, made his position easier. This, in turn, led to a shift in the position of Hanover in British politics. The opportunities George I had sought, with the support of Stanhope and Sunderland, were replaced, in his later years, by caution. This owed much to George’s age, and to the lesser opportunities for expansion stemming from the international situation, especially, the end of the Great Northern War in 1721, but Walpolean politics also played a role; although it would be foolish to pretend that these factors can be readily measured or assessed in an hierarchy of importance. More generally, British ministers and commentators who sought, indeed depended on, a conception of international relations, national interests and foreign policy as fixed and predictable were all challenged by the extent, pace and unpredictability of change. Culprits were sought for both the resulting uncertainty and for the problems arising from international developments, and in Britain, as it was easy to attribute 9\n\nU. Richter-Uhlig, Hof und Politik unter den Bedingungen der Personalunion zwischen Hannover und England (Hanover, 1992).\n\nHanoverian nexus: Walpole and the Electorate\n\n17\n\ndifficulties to what was new, so there was a temptation to attribute blame to the Hanoverian connection. In part, this was justified, as, at the very least, the connection created serious difficulties for British foreign policy, but, at this point, that is not the topic at issue. Instead, in order to understand the contours of the public debate and how it changed, there is the question of the construction of blame. In many respects, Hanover acted as the equivalent opposite to another geographical locator of blame, Utrecht. The latter, a reference to the peace settlement of 1713, was used, from the Hanoverian accession in 1714, by pro-government spokesmen in order to query the loyalty and probity of the Tories and to suggest that Whig critics who cooperated with the Tories from 1717, such as Walpole in 1717–20, had abandoned crucial principles. Similar to Utrecht, in that its legacy for British foreign policy seemed longstanding,10 Hanover also served as a mirror image, enabling opposition spokesmen to berate the ministry for failing to understand and/or defend national interests, and thus for being unfit to govern. However artificially, Britishness could therefore be constructed as an alternative to Hanoverianism. This offered a valuable leitmotif of political debate, and a more ‘modern’ alternative to the notion of dynastic legitimacy as the key issue in that debate. Instead of the opposition focusing on the rights to the British throne of the Hanoverians, an issue that left little space for political debate, other than of a treasonable character, it was possible to ask whether the ministry was legitimate in the sense of sustaining the national interest, or to embarrass the ministry on this head by pushing it to defend foreign policy in the light of discussion of this interest. This was an aspect of a more widespread European political development during the eighteenth century: the separation of ruler from nation, not least in terms of an automatic assumption that the identity and interest of the latter were submerged in the former. The causes of this across Europe were varied, but included a lesser stress on the themes and idioms of sacral monarchy, seen in Britain in the way in which the Hanoverians followed William III, but not Anne, in not touching for scrofula, ‘the King’s Evil’. In the case of Britain, the legacy of seventeenth-century constitutional struggles was a distinctive degree of dissociation of ruler from nation that was expressed in particular in the position and rights of parliament. To shift the focus, and provide an additional level of complexity, that the Georges had important and difficult responsibilities as electors did not 10\n\nG. H. Jones, Great Britain and the Tuscan Succession question, 1710–1737 (New York, 1998).\n\n18\n\nJeremy Black\n\nmean that their espousal of Hanoverian interests was free from criticism within the Electorate. This was an aspect of a more general question about the extent to which the dynasty, both as electors and as kings, were following goals that posed problems for their German subjects. In particular, the territorial expansionism they pursued as electors, and the power politics they were involved in as kings, as well as the implications for Hanover of the link to Britain, led to disquiet among the Hanoverian ministers, and was part of a more general tension between elector and ministers that matched those of crown and ministers, and that was neglected by British writers. At the same time, it is important to note tensions within the Hanoverian ministry. While some aspects of this have been ably studied,11 much still requires attention, especially for the late 1720s and the 1730s. In short, the Hanoverian context of Walpole’s period in office, and even more, the details of policy and policy discussion, are obscure. To note a distinction between Electorate and elector, and, also to explain the need for the electors to consider the Electorate, does not, however, diminish the issue created by the Hanoverian link for British politics and politicians. Although a parallel was offered by the disquiet among the Hanoverian ministers, this disquiet was far more pronounced in the case of Britain, not least because of the prominent role of parliament and the press there. The problem for the ruler of the balancing act among commitments required from the key figure in a Personal Union, affected George I and George II as both king and elector, and, in both capacities, it strained political assumptions. At the same time, European rulers did not always make a distinction between Britain and Hanover. Instead, they could think of George I and George II as acting in one capacity, rather than two; and thus of Britain-Hanover as a new entity, albeit not a state.12 Indeed, a dynamic for the Personal Union was provided by the repeated difficulties confronted by the electors: Britain-Hanover becoming a reality in response to problems. The affirmation or negotiation of peace, as in 1721, 1727, 1731, 1748 and 1763, brought relief from these difficulties, but, for much of the period, Hanover was under threat, acute or potential, and there was a dangerous ‘structural’ factor in the international system: the rise of Russia and Prussia. These, especially the latter, posed greater challenges to Hanover than the earlier ‘great powers’ that had intervened in north Germany: Austria, France, Denmark and Sweden. The rise of Prussia more than anything else defined Hanover’s international situation; and that is why attempts to blame the Electorate’s 11 12\n\nU. Dann, Hannover und England, 1740–1760 (Hildesheim, 1986). J. M. Black, The Hanoverians (London, 2004), pp. 28–30.\n\nHanoverian nexus: Walpole and the Electorate\n\n19\n\ndifficulties on the dynastic link with Britain, and therefore to argue that Britain owed support, are unconvincing. Tension was accentuated by George II’s poor relations with his uncle by marriage, Frederick William I of Prussia (r. 1713–40), and also with the latter’s son, Frederick II, the Great (r. 1740–86). He made scant effort to manage either of them, and this could anger British ministers keen to improve relations with Prussia. In turn, both Frederick William and his son were regarded as personally hostile to George II. This was greater than the animus shown George I by Frederick William I or George III by Frederick II. Threats to Hanover tested the acumen of the British ministers as they struggled to confront the diplomatic and political consequences. Thus, Walpole had to restrain George I over Baltic politics in 1723, and, more seriously, had in 1725–7, to defend in Britain the consequences of the Alliance of Hanover, and to seek to present the confrontation with the Alliance of Hanover as arising from British interests. The particular parliamentary problem was the voting, from 1726, of a subsidy to pay the Landgrave Karl of Hesse-Cassel, in order to acquire Hessian troops for the defence of Hanover. The first crisis of Hanoverian vulnerability during George II’s reign, that in 1729, owed nothing to Anglo-Prussian differences, but stemmed directly from electoral differences with Prussia;13 and these were to be repeated. In July 1740, Lord Harrington, secretary of state for the Northern Department, sent a private letter in his own hand to his fellow secretary of state Newcastle, from Hanover, whither he had accompanied George II, noting the impact of electoral disputes, such as the succession to East Friesland, I will venture in great confidence to acquaint you there are certain disputes and pretensions subsisting betwixt the Houses of Hanover and Prussia, which though they may appear to the rest of the world not to deserve so immediate an attention as other matters of a more genial nature, I fear however that till those are adjusted, in which I foresee great difficulties likely to arise, the general matters will go on but lamely.14\n\nThe two crises with France – in 1741 when invasion threatened, and in 1757 when it occurred – were responses to George II’s policies as a German prince, rather than blows against Britain: in 1741 he was backing Maria Theresa, although this also reflected the views of his British ministers, and in 1756, in pursuit of Hanoverian security, had allied with Frederick II.

In both 1741 and 1756–7, in the difficult circumstances of European power politics, George found it impossible to control the consequences for Hanover of his policies in Germany, and in 1741 in the political crisis leading to and following his last general election this caused serious political problems for Walpole. The latter’s fall, however, did not end the problem. George’s ability to push Maria Theresa toward compromise helped end the First Silesian War between Austria and Prussia, but he lacked the power and intent to settle Maria Theresa’s differences with Charles Albert of Bavaria. Allied to Frederick in 1756, George found that he could not prevent Prussia from precipitating war in Europe, and thus exposing Hanover to attack. Alongside the public sphere in debate over foreign policy was a private sphere of discussion, one indeed that is generally neglected. This private sphere was the world of ministers and diplomats, and except for public breaches, as with the Whig Split of 1717–20, or William Pitt the Elder’s movement into opposition in 1754–5, this debate left little trace in the public world. Its focus was also different. Instead of an emphasis on obvious differences of interest and a language of clarity and outrage, came a stress on detail and a concern about the content of policy. Although these strategies and spheres of debate can be segregated for purposes of analysis they, in reality, overlapped and part of their political importance rested on this overlap. For example, the consequences of the public debate could serve to accentuate divisions within the ministry, while an awareness of the latter could play a role in this debate. In office, in opposition, and, returned to office, the career of Walpole, the most important member of the ministry from 1720 to 1742, illustrated these tensions within the government. As so often in the period, however, it is important to note the character of, and lacunae in, the sources.15 Much Walpole correspondence survives, but most of it is on patronage matters, and we only glimpse his views on foreign policy episodically and, frequently, at second hand, although the sources for George II are far worse. The comments of foreign envoys keen to chart and explain British policy16 are an important source for Walpole, as for 15\n\n16\n\nDespite these lacunae, it is still unfortunate that N. Harding’s interesting ‘Sir Robert Walpole and Hanover’, Historical Research, 76 (2003), 164–88 does not rest on archival research and the perspectives it can offer. Most are unprinted, but see R. A. Marini, La politica sabauda alla corte Inglese dopo il trattato d’Hannover 1725–1730 nella Relazione dell’ambasciatore piemonte a Londra (Chambe´ry, 1918).\n\nHanoverian nexus: Walpole and the Electorate\n\n21\n\nGeorge II, but one that needs to be handled with care. The particular episode that commands attention because it bulks large in the surviving sources, is Walpole’s role in preserving British neutrality in the War of the Polish Succession (1733–5), but, aside from the one-sided nature of the sources (we know very little directly of George II’s views),17 it is unclear how far we can use this episode to provide a comprehensive account of the issue. Walpole’s leading biographers, William Coxe and J. H. Plumb, were not particularly interested in foreign policy and also threw little light on his response to Hanoverian commitments in the 1720s and 1730s. As a result, their account of relations between monarch and first minister lacked depth.18 Allowing for these caveats, it appears clear that Walpole had a clear-cut assessment of national interest in which the Hanoverian commitment appeared as an add-on. This was an add-on made necessary by the monarch and by the protestant succession, but, nevertheless, something that could be judged in terms of prudential considerations of benefit and cost. Walpole lacked any emotional commitment to the Electorate. He never went there and did not have any close links with Hanoverian ministers. Unlike his brother who, while acting as secretary of state, went to Hanover in 1736, Walpole did not do so when he acted in this capacity in 1723 and 1729. Nor did he have any correspondence prefiguring that of Newcastle with Mu¨nchhausen. Walpole’s conception of the interests involved in the connection separated it from any general discussion of the virtues and disadvantages of continental interventionism and, indeed, they were different to Walpole. The latter, general discussion attracts more interest from those concerned with the public sphere, but Walpole’s more narrow conception is one that needs to be recovered in order to appreciate the range of responses possible to the Hanoverian connection.19 Such a recovery challenges the somewhat Manichean presentation of the debate over the pernicious, or other, implications of the Hanoverian connection. This is in terms of an apparent dichotomy between Whig ministries committed to the connection pursuing a foreign policy that benefited from it, and retrograde Tory xenophobes apparently unable to understand wider national interests or to respond sensibly to international developments. Such a presentation, however, is a travesty of the 17 18 19\n\nJ. M. Black, ‘British neutrality in the War of the Polish Succession’, International History Review 8 (1986), 345–66. W.

The travesty of Tory views is serious, as it reflects and sustains an inability to understand the character of the public debate. More seriously, treating critics of the Hanoverian impact as Tories, and therefore ipso facto foolish, and assessing modern scholars who present this view in the same light, is seriously distorting.20 It is adopting the perspective of a particular Whig tradition of interventionism and failing to understand the degree to which Stanhope, Townshend, Carteret and Newcastle saw the support of Hanover as an integral aspect of this interventionism, largely because they regarded threats to the Electorate as a challenge to the policy. As a consequence of failing to appreciate the debate, it is difficult to grasp the context within which British ministers responded to options. Adopting another approach, it is possible to probe the archives in both Britain and Germany in order to throw extensive light on contemporary criticism of the impact of the connection by British and Hanoverian ministers. This is valuable at a functional level, but fails to address adequately the ideological character of the link. The Hanoverian succession was a direct consequence of the application of political antiCatholicism to dynastic ends in a monarchical society. From that perspective, functional problems that arose as a consequence were very much secondary. However, political anti-Catholicism was far more acceptable (and definable) in the defensive context of preventing a Stuart revanche, the theme of much propaganda and of some discussion about foreign policy, for example in 1725–7, rather than in providing a rationale for proactive policies. This was overridden to an extent during the reign of George I, when the unattractive public implications of the alliance with France from 1716 were, to an extent, made less significant by the continued rhetoric of anti-Catholicism. This was particularly seen in the early 1720s, for example in response to the treatment of protestants in the Palatinate and in Poland, and, even more, during the confrontation between the alliances of Hanover and Vienna from 1725, in which Britain allied to France was opposed to Austria and Spain.21 Yet, on the whole the Hanoverian connection was not followed by a protestant foreign policy.22 Far from it: Hanover’s major rival was\n\n20 21 22\n\nJ.

Instead, Hanover and Saxony were allied for much of the 1730s–mid-1750s. Furthermore, Hanover depended for its security on the support of France until 1731,23 and thereafter, albeit to a very varied extent, George II, as king and elector, sought to protect Austrian interests, or at least his conception of these interests, until 1756, and Walpole, perforce, supported this policy, although it is unclear that he felt much support for it. Alliance with first France, and then Austria, could be defended as prudent, but it scarcely conformed to a confessional ideology. In its absence, there were few available defences for foreign policy. The most common, that of the balance of power, joined an ideological justification of policy to that of prudence, but the latter itself invited criticism on a prudential basis with reference to the application of the theory in policy terms, while the relationship between the Hanoverian connection and the balance was sufficiently vague to invite the rejoinder that it was not relevant.24 It is important to address the role of subjective considerations in contemporary and modern judgements. These are related, because it is unclear how sensible it is to abstract the process of assessing the response that ‘should’ have been made from the political context. If, for example, criticism of the consequences of the Hanoverian commitment is presented as xenophobic, even paranoid, and as arising from a failure to understand the major developments in Europe, then many speakers and writers, and much of the ambience and ethos of public (and private) discussion of foreign policy will be seen as unsatisfactory. Restoring attention to contemporary debates25 entails considering attitudes as well as interests and goals, as these attitudes were directly relevant to issues of best policy and practice. In simple terms, and again allowing for a failure to conform to party political alignments (which reflected multiple factors, not least religious views), there was a tension between ‘Whig’ and ‘Tory’ attitudes towards the international system, with the latter enjoying considerable sway, including among many who were not Tory in party politics. The Whig attitude lent itself much more readily to the pragmatic, functional defence of the Hanoverian alignment. Assuming that, through human action, it was possible to create a more 23 24 25\n\nJ.

In this view, there were clear-cut national interests that could be readily assessed and balanced, and it was therefore possible to devise collective security systems that encompassed Hanover, as with the Imperial Election Scheme of the early 1750s. These views made sense of, and demanded, interventionism. This was the approach of many, but by no means all, British diplomats, of some secretaries of state, most obviously Stanhope, Carteret and Newcastle, and of several influential scholars of the last half-century. This approach required criticism of the opposite viewpoint, but the ‘Tory’ attitude in fact drew on a coherent intellectual and moral philosophy, as well as an informed assessment of international relations and of British options. The ‘Tory’ option was inherently pessimistic about the possibilities of creating trust and workable collective systems, and inclined to assume that any settlement of differences would be precarious, if not short term. This attitude was lapsarian, rather than Newtonian, and with a stress on the human volition of rulers and ministers, not the mechanics of the balance of power. In appreciating the limitations of the schematic understanding of national interests and international relations, this approach offered a powerful critique of interventionism, and thus challenged the value of collective systems of guarantee, and of commitments stemming from the Hanoverian connection. Paradoxically, the uncertainty of parliamentary responses to foreign policy helped ensure that the clarity of diplomatic conception, and the schematic model-building of the language of the balance of power, did not describe adequately the nature of the British domestic context for foreign policy. The potential political challenge posed by the latter indeed overlapped with the tension between ‘Whig’ and ‘Tory’ attitudes already referred to. In both, the Hanoverian connection was troublesome, but the potential problems posed by royal demands on behalf of the Electorate were restrained during the 1720s and 1730s, not only by Walpole’s skill, but also because repeated, but varied, threats to Hanover, for example by Russia in the early 1720s, Austria and her allies in 1726–7,26 Prussia in 1729, or a French advance east of the Rhine in 1734 or 1735, were not realised. Crucially, there was no war involving Hanover in 1725–7, while in 1733–5, in the War of the Polish Succession, Hanover, although a combatant, was not endangered. Although Belle-Isle’s advance down the Moselle Valley in 1734 briefly caused concern on this head, it was not the basis of an advance across the Rhine. Indeed, the French followed a much\n\n26\n\nJ. F. Chance, The alliance of Hanover (London, 1923).\n\nHanoverian nexus: Walpole and the Electorate\n\n25\n\nmore cautious policy north of the Alps than in Italy, and this included observing a neutrality for the Austrian Netherlands, an arresting instance of limited war. George as elector sent troops to the Imperial army in 1734, but Hanover did not need to be rescued from attack by British diplomatic or, even more problematic, military action. This was important because, whatever the cause of the conflict, and however defended in public debate, the dynamic of events in such a conflict might have cruelly exposed differences over Hanover. In the 1740s, however, the situation seriously deteriorated on both heads, and this led to the major agitation over Hanoverian interests that caused such political problems in Parliament in 1742–4. These problems indicated the wisdom of Walpole’s earlier caution. From this perspective, Newcastle’s post-War-of-the-Austrian-Succession attempt to arrange a strong collective security system designed to prevent war, however misguided in diplomatic terms, rested on the political insight he shared with Walpole that, in terms of relations with the king, it would not be easy for a ministry to refuse Hanover support in a conflict, but that the provision of such support might cause serious political problems in Britain.27 In the event, even William Pitt the Elder, a scourge of Hanoverian measures (as, initially, of Walpole and George II), had to accept the dispatch of British troops and money to Germany in 1758, although he was able to present it both in terms of assistance to Prussia, a reasonable claim, at least in so far as keeping Frederick II in the war was concerned, and also, far more problematically, as a means to conquer America (i.e. New France or Canada) in Germany. Like Newcastle’s approach, this policy was riskier, because more exposed to the uncertainties of international developments, than that of Walpole; whose attitudes had, instead, been carried forward by his prote´ge´ Henry Pelham, First Lord of the Treasury from 1743 until his unexpected death in 1754. Indeed, Pelham’s views provide an important way of gauging the Walpolean legacy, and indicate that the minister’s influence did not cease in 1745. In contrast, while Newcastle and Pitt were very different to each other in their political methods and resonance, they shared a commitment in office to action that was not that of Walpole or Pelham, and, indeed, as a minor ministerial figure, Pitt had supported Newcastle in the late 1740s and early 1750s, defending the subsidy to Maximilian Joseph, elector of Bavaria in the Commons debate on 27\n\nJ.

Newcastle was particularly associated with the ‘Old System’ – an active alignment with Austria and the Dutch that clashed with Walpole’s priorities, and indeed with his experience of the difficulties of acting with either power. This alignment served royal and Hanoverian ends in the 1740s and early 1750s by essentially acting as a military deterrent to Prussia, while appearing also as an anti-French step, and thus matching the assumptions of British politicians. The clash between hostility to France and opposition to Prussia had led to significant political and diplomatic difficulties during the War of the Austrian Succession, but the coming of peace in 1748 permitted the shelving of the apparent differences between the two goals. However, securing the peace by restraining France and Prussia through a collective security system, underlined the value of Walpole’s earlier caution as it made Britain dependent on her partners, left it unclear whether France or Prussia were the major challenge, and made it uncertain whether, in the event of war, intervention could surmount the problems both of Hanoverian vulnerability and of British political ambivalence toward the Electorate, and win success. As a consequence, British ministers, such as Holdernesse and Newcastle, were to be very free in their criticism of their Hanoverian counterparts in 1757. The commitment to action carried with it serious international and diplomatic risks: in both peace and war, Newcastle’s diplomatic schemes fell foul of the difficulties posed by obdurate allies, and of the duke’s failure to appreciate the direction of international relations; while, in 1758, Pitt had to commit British resources to the weaker of the two alliance systems in Europe. The joy that greeted Frederick II’s victories was, in part, relief that the consequences of this could be avoided. Both Newcastle and Pitt felt constrained by George II and his Hanoverian concerns. Newcastle was greatly influenced by his visit to Hanover in 1748, not least by meeting the leading Hanoverian minister, Gerlach Adolf von Mu¨nchhausen; and his ministerial allies in Britain drew attention to the duke’s new-found clarity. Newcastle’s concern to rout his ministerial rival, John, 4th duke of Bedford, secretary of state for the Southern Department, as indeed happened in 1751, was also important, as he needed royal support to this end. In contrast, Walpole thwarted Townshend and Carteret in 1730 and Chesterfield, Stair and others in 1733, without having to back George’s electoral views. Unlike Walpole after 1730, a sense of dependence, indeed anxiety about George’s opinions, continued to characterise Newcastle’s views after 1748. In his turn, Pitt was obliged to back help to Hanover if George II\n\nHanoverian nexus: Walpole and the Electorate\n\n27\n\nwas to be persuaded to disavow the Hanoverian neutrality of 1757, which threatened the coherence of a foreign policy that then rested on alliance with Prussia alone. Again, Walpole had avoided any such necessity. Ironically, it was the future George III, at least prior to the 1780s, who most powerfully represented this ambivalence toward Hanover in the late 1750s, as well as once he came to the throne in 1760. He took up the critical attitudes of Walpole towards an active foreign policy, and, in doing so, linked royal authority to non-interventionism. As Prince of Wales, and influenced by the problems of the Seven Years War, George criticised the partiality of his grandfather, George II, for Hanover, and, as king, he was determined to disengage from the ‘German war’, the German part of the Seven Years War, and to avoid loading Britain with subsidies. To discuss the attitudes and policies of George III is to look far ahead from the opportunities and problems that became so rapidly apparent from the Hanoverian accession. While comparisons over such a period are instructive they also risk neglecting the specificities of debate and discussion in particular contexts. In considering the latter, it is important to reiterate that the differences of contemporaries should not be slighted or misrepresented by reference to factious opposition. Given modern scholarly disagreements over theories of international relations, as well as the clarity with which in modern democracies politicians and publics contest definitions of national interest, and disagree vigorously over how best to pursue them, it is surprising that debate over foreign policy in the past is not taken more seriously.\n\n3\n\nPitt and Hanover Brendan Simms\n\nThe weight of his popularity, and his universally acknowledged abilitys, obtruded him upon King George the Second, to whom he was personally obnoxious. He was made Secretary of State. In this difficult and delicate situation, which one would have thought must have reduced either the patriot, or the minister to a decisive option, he managed with such ability, that while he served the King more effectually in his most unwarrantable Electoral views, than any former Minister however willing, had dared to do, He still preserved all his credit, and popularity with the Publick, whom he assured and convinced that the protection and defence of Hannover with an army of 75 000 men in British pay, was the only possible means of securing our possessions or acquisitions in North America.

Pitt’s policy towards Hanover also features prominently in the two recent scholarly biographies by Marie Peters and Jeremy Black.3 This chapter takes a fresh look at this well-studied subject. It will show that the study of Pitt and Hanover serves as a prism through 1 2 3\n\n‘A character of Mr Pitt [1762]’, in Colin Franklin, ed., Lord Chesterfield.

The Elder Pitt is famously an elusive subject. Unlike many other eighteenth-century political figures, such as the earl of Chesterfield or the Elder Horace Walpole, he was not a pamphleteer. In contrast to his colleague and rival, the duke of Newcastle, Pitt was an infrequent and brief correspondent.4 A great deal of what we know about his political and strategic thinking, and still more his high-political machinations, comes from the accounts of others, especially the correspondence of the duke of Newcastle, the earl of Hardwicke and the duke of Bedford.5 If we want to establish what Pitt himself thought, or wanted us to think he thought, we generally have to turn to his parliamentary speeches, which are unreliably and incompletely documented.6 The surviving record is particularly disappointing for the crucial period of the Seven Years War, much better for the early stages of the War of the Austrian Succession. ‘New’ speeches, or fuller and alternative accounts of known speeches, are still cropping up. A particularly striking example would be Pitt’s speech of December 1761 on the German war, which Karl Schweizer unearthed just over a decade ago.7 The study of Pitt and Hanover is further complicated by the fact that Pitt never served in a capacity which brought him formally into contact with the management of the German war and British-Hanoverian relations at the highest level. He was secretary of state for the South during his celebrated wartime ministry; the relevant secretary of state for the 4 5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nOn this see Richard Middleton, The bells of victory.

Yorke, ed., The life and correspondence of Philip Yorke, earl of Hardwicke (3 vols., Cambridge, 1913). The duke of Newcastle’s papers are to be found in the Add. Mss. of the British Library. Some of the letters have been printed in Yorke, ed., Hardwicke; the originals have been used where extracts relating to Pitt have been missed. Pitt’s own surviving correspondence is sparse: W. S. Taylor and J. H. Pringle, eds., The correspondence of William Pitt, earl of Chatham (4 vols., London, 1838–1840). The printed version does not always seem to be entirely reliable. For example, liberties are taken with the text of the letter from Pitt to the duke of Brunswick, 28 October 1760, though the sense is retained: Taylor and Pringle, eds., Chatham, II, p. 76 and Niedersa¨chisches Hauptstaatsarchiv Hannover (NHStH), Hann 9e Nr. 109, fol. 101. The author has not knowingly used an archival source where a satisfactory printed version was available. On this problem generally see Jeremy Black, Parliament and foreign policy in the eighteenth century (Cambridge, 2004), pp. 137–63. For Pitt in particular see Peter D. G.

It investigates whether Pitt was simply a classic eighteenth-century opportunist, who castigated Hanover in opposition, but deferred to the king’s German sensibilities when in office. It assesses, more generally, whether there was a coherence to Pitt’s strategy at all. It also examines whether, as the heroic narrative suggested, Pitt so skilfully interwove continental and colonial measures\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11 12\n\n13 14\n\nE.g. see duke of Brunswick to Pitt, 7 January 1759, Mu¨nster fol. 20, PRO 30/8/90, which makes clear that the regular channel of communication was through Holdernesse and not Pitt: ‘L’absence de Mylord Comte Holdernesse me fournit d’occasion d’e´crire a votre excellence en suite des affaires, qui regardit l’arme´e sous mes ordres,’ (The absence of Lord Holdernesse gives me the opportunity to write to your Excellency about the matters regarding the army I am commanding). There is some material in PRO 30/8/89–90 (Chatham Papers). PRO 30/8/91 contains chiefly copies of translations of various treaties of alliance and subsidy with German powers, principally Prussia.

An example of this would be Mu¨nchhausen to Pitt, 27 October 1759, PRO 30/8/89, fol. 223, in which he sends – at the request of George II – a translation of a dispatch of the Hanoverian envoy to Copenhagen, Steinberg.

I Whatever his public rhetoric, Pitt was throughout his career never a pure ‘blue-water’ colonialist but an opposition Whig supporter of engagement in Europe. His foreign-political horizon was shaped by the attacks launched by opposition Whigs, under the loose leadership of the earl of Chesterfield on the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole in the decade before 1740. To be sure, these Whigs scourged Walpole’s reluctance first to declare war on Spain in the late 1730s, and then to prosecute that war with sufficient vigour. But the core of the Chesterfieldian critique of British foreign policy was not colonial or naval. Its principal charge was that the turn away from the traditional alliance with Austria in the mid1720s – epitomised by the Treaty of Hanover in 1725 – had allowed French power to grow unchecked, to threaten the European balance of power and thus British liberties; the Treaty of Hanover between Britain, France and Prussia had marked the nadir of relations with Vienna. Far from being opposed to all continental entanglements, these Whigs rebuked Walpole for failing to support the Habsburgs during the War of the Polish Succession. To the best of my knowledge, Pitt’s views on these subjects in the 1730s have not been recorded, but as we shall see his retrospective assessments of British policy of that period in the early 15 16\n\n17\n\nRichard Pares, ‘American versus continental warfare, 1739–1763’, English Historical Review 51 (1936), 460, on how Pitt ‘learned the lesson’ that Europe mattered. Richard Middleton, The bells of victory. The Pitt–Newcastle ministry and the conduct of the Seven Years War 1757–1762 (Cambridge, 1985). Peters, Elder Pitt, pp. 105–6, largely accepts this view. For an interesting contribution to the Pitt legend and ‘combined operations’ see Richard Harding, ‘Sailors and gentlemen of parade: some professional and technical problems concerning the conduct of combined operations in the eighteenth century’, Historical Journal 23 (1989), 33–55, especially 37–40.

Marie Peters, ‘The myth of William Pitt, earl of Chatham, great imperialist. Part I: Pitt and imperial expansion 1738–1763’, Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 21, 1 (1993), 31–74. A good example of the view of Pitt as a great colonialist is Kate Hotblack, Chatham’s colonial policy. A study in the fiscal and economic implications of the colonial policy of the Elder Pitt (London, 1917, reprinted Philadelphia, 1980), especially pp. xii–xiv.\n\n32\n\nBrendan Simms\n\n1740s all stressed the failure to bolster Austria against France, far more than colonial differences with Spain. Pitt was first confronted with the Hanoverian connection in this context. ‘The Treaty of Hanover’, he told the House of Commons in midFebruary 1741, ‘was calculated only for the advancement of the house of Bourbon’ and had ‘disunite[d] us from the only power [Austria], with which it is our interest to cultivate an inseparable friendship. This disunion therefore may justly be charged upon the minister, who has weakened the interest of this country, and endangered the liberties of Europe.’18 Just over a year later, he elaborated that ‘The treaty of Hanover deserves indeed to be first mentioned, because from thence springs the danger which Europe is now exposed to; and it is impossible to assign a reason for our entering into that treaty, without supposing that we then resolved to be revenged upon the emperor for refusing to grant us some favour in Germany [i.e. for Hanover].’19 It is a striking feature of this, and most other contemporaneous parliamentary attacks on Walpole, that concerns about European policy far outweighed those relating to colonial and naval matters. The first substantial evidence of Pitt’s thinking on Hanover can be found in his parliamentary speeches of 1742–4, which were delivered against the background of the War of the Austrian Succession. This pitted Prussia, France and Bavaria against British-backed Austria. In late 1741, a French army had moved into northern Germany and compelled George II to conclude a neutrality convention in his capacity as elector. Not long after, Walpole had resigned, largely because of the collapse of his European policy, and been replaced by Carteret, who had renounced the neutrality convention and invested large sums of British money in hiring Hanoverian troops to engage the French in Germany and Flanders. These payments provoked an extraordinary outburst of parliamentary and public outrage. It was in this context that Pitt delivered his famous diatribe against the Hanoverian connection, which did so much to colour contemporary and subsequent perceptions of him as a diehard critic of the Personal Union. ‘It does not yet appear’, he said, ‘that either justice or policy required us to engage in the quarrels of the continent’. And yet now Britain was being asked to pay for the upkeep of Hanoverian forces. ‘It is now too apparent’, he pronounced at the climax of his speech, ‘that this great, this powerful, 18\n\n19\n\nPitt speech in Commons, 13 February 1741, in William Cobbett, ed., The parliamentary history of England from the earliest period to the year 1803 (36 vols., London, 1806–20) [Cobbett], XI, cols. 1360–1.
