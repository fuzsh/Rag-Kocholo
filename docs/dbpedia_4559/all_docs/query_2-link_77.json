A short, concise book on a foundational concept can go a long way toward clarification, and Stephenson’s Medieval Feudalism provided some of this clarification, illuminating medieval civilization entire in doing so.\n\nQuora: https://philosophyofhistory.quora.com/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/r3dudQvGxD\n\nLinks: https://jnnielsen.carrd.co/\n\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dMh0_-/\n\nText post: https://geopolicraticus.substack.com/p/carl-stephenson-and-the-second-urbanization\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/QY8neJZBLoE\n\nPodcast: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/m8Q7r0eKWLb\n\nPost with 1 note\n\nThe World to Come\n\nThe World to Come.—The world that follows us will be filled with the things that we made and left behind us, as well as much that we inherited and still remains. In this sense, the future will be familiar. In other ways, the future will be different in trivial but pervasive ways, so that the texture of ordinary life would not be recognizable to us. For example, after we die, there will be songs that become so popular that absolutely everyone knows them. They will be hummed, whistled, sung in the shower, played at weddings, and will work themselves into the ordinary business of life, becoming something that everyone knows, and we will not have heard any of them a single time. Perhaps such songs are already written, but have not yet found their way to recognition, like a book by some forgotten and impoverished soul that makes its author a posthumous success. Quotes from books like these will be as familiar as the popular tunes that we will never know.\n\nPost\n\nTODAY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY\n\nThe Advent of the Nuclear Age\n\nThe Nuclear Age began suddenly, spectacularly, and catastrophically by the airburst of the Little Boy atomic bomb over Hiroshima, on Monday 06 August 1945, 79 years ago today. Three days later, on Thursday 09 August 1945, the Fat Man atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. What did these bombs inaugurate, and what did we learn about ourselves and our place in history as a result?\n\nQuora: https://philosophyofhistory.quora.com/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/r3dudQvGxD\n\nLinks: https://jnnielsen.carrd.co/\n\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dMh0_-/\n\nText post: https://geopolicraticus.substack.com/p/the-advent-of-the-nuclear-age\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/WJp5IXTo_f0\n\nPodcast: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/nGgjNF02PLb\n\nPost with 1 note\n\nThe Permanent Possibility of Formalization\n\nThe Permanent Possibility of Formalization.—Even if most reasoning is not fully formalized, knowing that reasoning can be formalized, and reasoning within the parameters of the possibility of formalization, exercises a formal regulatory function over reason. There is much that can go wrong, however, if we adopt this attitude too casually. We may imagine that, as we extrapolate our reasoning into unfamiliar theoretical territory that we are all the time reasoning within the parameters of the possibility of formalization even as we incrementally depart from these parameters. Thus it becomes necessary to regularly recur to full formalization under the changed and changing conditions of our reasoning. It is not enough to clarify the foundations of reasoning a single time, and then to move on to further constructions on this foundation. One must return to the foundations time and again to see how they are bearing up under the superstructure that is being erected upon them.\n\nPost\n\nTODAY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY\n\nWalter Pater and an Aestheticist Philosophy of History\n\nSunday 04 August 2024 is the 185th anniversary of the birth of Walter Horatio Pater (04 August 1839 – 30 July 1894), who was born in London’s East End on this date in 1839.\n\nPater’s book on the renaissance, first published in 1873 as Studies in the History of the Renaissance, and revised in 1877 as The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry, culminated in a passionate philosophy of life based on the ideals of the renaissance, as Pater understood them from his Victorian perspective: “To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life.” But can this philosophy of life be translated into a philosophy of history?\n\nQuora: https://philosophyofhistory.quora.com/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/r3dudQvGxD\n\nLinks: https://jnnielsen.carrd.co/\n\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dMh0_-/\n\nText post: https://geopolicraticus.substack.com/p/walter-pater-and-the-aesthetic-conception\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/WuU2u6ZSVh0\n\nPodcast: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/TG76ZJNMMLb\n\nPost with 1 note\n\nAbsolute Freedom and Absolute Responsibility\n\nAbsolute Freedom and Absolute Responsibility.—There is no greater freedom than to experience the complete and utter indifference of others. As a result, one knows a kind of vertigo in the face of absolute freedom that is disorienting and liable to lead to giddiness and confusion. At the same time, there is no greater burden than absolute freedom, as absolute freedom means absolute responsibility. The burden of absolute freedom that has been exchanged for the good opinion of others is experienced as a profound alienation from all that had previously held meaning and value, and which meaning and value one must now supply out of oneself. To dredge from the depths of one’s being the substance of life necessary to go on another day is to daily risk the exhaustion of one’s resources. One must become, at the deepest level, ontologically productive, or be consumed by the effort.\n\nPost with 5 notes\n\nThe Fickle Masses\n\nThe Fickle Masses.—There is a tension in historical explanation between regarding the populace as lazy and easily placated with bread and circuses, on the one hand, while, on the other hand, regarding the populace as easily provoked and liable to riot at any time. Of course, these two positions are not difficult to reconcile: the populace may be both easy to placate and easy to provoke, always balancing on a knife-edge of uncertainty and able to shift suddenly on an apparently insignificant pretext—a late shipment of bread or a commotion at the games might be sufficient to upset the delicate balance.\n\nPost with 1 note\n\nTODAY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY\n\nKarl Popper on Historicism and Indeterminism\n\nSunday 28 July 2024 is the 122nd anniversary of the birth of Karl Popper (28 July 1902 - 17 September 1994), who was born in Vienna on this date in 1902.\n\nPopper’s philosophy of history, expressed his The Open Society and Its Enemies in 1945 and The Poverty of Historicisim in 1957, can be understood as an application of his conception of knowledge, worked out in his philosophy of science, to history and the social sciences, which he equates as both being illicitly involved in a project of attempting to make historical predictions. Denying the possibility of prediction in history, Popper argued again historical determinism and inevitability.\n\nQuora: https://philosophyofhistory.quora.com/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/r3dudQvGxD\n\nLinks: https://jnnielsen.carrd.co/\n\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dMh0_-/\n\nText post: https://geopolicraticus.substack.com/p/karl-popper-on-historicism-and-determinism\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/HVn-FpY27F4\n\nPodcast: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/3zgCnoD2ALb\n\nPost with 2 notes\n\nTwo Routes to Knowledge\n\nTwo Routes to Knowledge.—We can arrive at knowledge through discipline or through love. Discipline yields knowledge without sympathy, remaining blind to much that has inspired the knowledge in question. Love yields understanding without distance, and so tends to distort its object to conform to our desires. It is only when discipline gives way to love or love converges on discipline that knowledge is true to its object.\n\nPost\n\nTODAY IN PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY\n\nThe Bolton Thesis and Hemispherical History\n\nSaturday 20 July 2024 is the 154th anniversary of the birth of Herbert Eugene Bolton (20 July 1870 – 30 January 1953), who was born on a farm in rural Wisconsin on this date in 1870.\n\nBolton was an American historian whose engagement with Spanish colonial history in the Spanish-American borderlands led to his formulation of the Bolton Thesis, that American history needs to be hemispherical history. Bolton trained hundreds of historians who came to be known collectively as the “Bolton School.”\n\nQuora: https://philosophyofhistory.quora.com/\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/r3dudQvGxD\n\nLinks: https://jnnielsen.carrd.co/\n\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dMh0_-/\n\nText post: https://geopolicraticus.substack.com/p/the-bolton-thesis-and-hemispherical\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/CMHdj8o6nRs\n\nPodcast: https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/rtZ7CVjgpLb"
