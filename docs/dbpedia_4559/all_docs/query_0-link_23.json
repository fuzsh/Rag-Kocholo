A man of vision, industry, and feeling, he made incalculable contributions to the knowledge of the Malay Archipelago and to the British overseas empire.\n\nB\n\norn on July 6, 1781, off the coast of Jamaica on board a ship under the command of his father, Benjamin Raffles, Stamford Raffles became a clerk in the office of the East India Company in London at the age of 14. In 1805 he was sent to Penang to serve as assistant secretary. Prior to his departure he married a widow, Mrs. Olivia Fancourt, who died in 1814. On the trip out, Raffles studied the Malay language intensively, and his proficiency in this then little-known language was remarked upon by those who came in contact with him. Three years after his arrival his health broke, and he was sent to Malacca to recuperate. The East India Company was on the point of abandoning this port, but a report which Raffles prepared and in which he argued the superiority of Malacca over Penang as a potential port persuaded the company to rescind its order.\n\nJava Annexation Lord Minto, the governor general of India, was so impressed with the report that he called Raffles on 2 months’ leave to Calcutta. During his visit Raffles convinced Lord Minto of the necessity of annexing Java, then in French hands, and the governor general appointed him agent to the\n\ngovernor general of the Malay States. Raffles then returned to Malacca and participated in preparations for the attack on Java. In August 1811 a British fleet of some 100 ships with an expeditionary force of about 12,000 men arrived off Batavia, and the city fell without a struggle. Gen. Janssens retreated to Semarang on the north-central coast of Java; in September he capitulated to the British. Lord Minto thereupon appointed Raffles lieutenant general of Java and admonished him, ‘‘While we are in Java, let us do all the good we can.’’ Raffles introduced numerous reforms, among which were the division of Java into 16 residencies, the introduction of a land tax, and improvements in the legal and judicial system; he also attempted to abolish slavery. He himself regarded his new land-tenure system, which prevented the native rulers from exacting feudal services, as the most solid accomplishment of his administration. The lands which were withdrawn from the control of feudal rulers were leased on a short-term basis at a moderate rental and were assessed at the value of two-fifths of the rice crop, with the remainder of the yield free of assessment and the growers exempt from personal taxes. In spite of his excellent intentions and superb knowledge of the people, their language, and their customs, Raffles was not able to make Java a profitable enterprise. His hope of turning Batavia into the hub of a new British insular empire was dashed, and when the Netherlands regained its independence, Lord Castlereagh vigorously opposed British retention of the Dutch holdings in the East. Raffles sent in a report explaining the great importance of Java to Britain, but his failure to make Java financially viable, together with Britain’s desire to conciliate the Dutch, militated against a reversal of Lord Castlereagh’s decision,\n\n1\n\n2\n\nRAFFLES\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY prepared laws, and laid the foundation of the Singapore Institution, a Malay school. In 1824 Raffles returned to England to face a charge brought against him by the East India Company, which required him to repay to it a substantial sum for salaries and expenses that had been disbursed to him and only years later disallowed by the court of directors. Raffles was endeavoring to arrange payment when he became seriously ill again. On July 5, 1826, less than 3 months after receiving the court’s letter demanding repayment, Raffles died of an apoplectic stroke. In his short span of life Raffles had suffered numerous crushing blows which would have felled a lesser man. That he survived them in spite of a less than robust constitution can be explained, in part at least, by his tremendous interest in, and enthusiasm for, every aspect of life in the East. He was, at once, amateur natural scientist, archeologist, Oriental philologist, and reviver and active president of the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences. An enduring monument to his knowledge and indefatigable industry is his famed History of Java (2 vols., 1817), which was the first comprehensive work on this subject and, although outdated, is still regarded as a classic in its field.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nand in March 1816 Raffles was removed from office and recalled. The following year he married Sophia Hull in London. His lasting contributions in Java can be seen in the fact that when the Dutch received this island back they adopted many of his reforms.\n\nFounding of Singapore In November 1817 Raffles, now Sir Stamford, departed England for Ft. Marlborough (or Benkoelen), in southern Sumatra, where he assumed the residentship of this town. He and Col. R. J. Farquhar, former British resident at Amboina, were on the lookout for a strategically situated way station in the Malay Archipelago which would play in the East the role Malta was playing in the West. On Jan. 28, 1819, they landed on the Island of Singapore and immediately recognized it as ideal for their purpose. They arrived at an agreement with the Sultan of Johore, and on February 6 a treaty was signed marking the establishment of Singapore as a British settlement. Farquhar was installed as its first governor under the supervision of Raffles at Benkoelen. As Charles E. Wurtzburg (1954) wrote, ‘‘It would be difficult to imagine that, had there been no Raffles, there would have been any Singapore.’’ During the next 4 years four of Raffles’s children died in Benkoelen; his health and that of his wife deteriorated; and in 1823 he submitted his resignation. Before leaving for England, however, he decided to pay a final visit to Singapore, where he remained 9 months. He planned the city,\n\nAn intimate and contemporary account of Raffles is in Lady Sophia H. Raffles, Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1830; new ed., 2 vols., 1835), which contains many private letters and public dispatches. Although there is no adequate biography of Raffles, the most extensive study is Charles E. Wurtzburg, Raffles of the Eastern Isles, edited by Clifford Witting (1954). A very readable account, with interesting plates, is Maurice Collis, Raffles (1966). The following are less valuable because they make little use of the records in the India Office Library: Demetrius C. Boulger, The Life of Sir Stamford Raffles (1897); Hugh Edward Egerton, Sir Stamford Raffles: England in the Far East (1900); J. A. Bethune Cook, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles (1918); Reginald Coupland, Raffles: 1781-1826 (1926); Emily Hahn, Raffles of Singapore: A Biography (1946); and Colin Clair, Sir Stamford Raffles: Founder of Singapore (1963). Two important studies by John Bastin deal with Raffles’s policies: Raffles’ Ideas on the Land Rent System in Java and the Mackenzie Land Tenure Commission (1954) and The Native Policies of Sir Stamford Raffles in Java and Sumatra (1957).\n\nAdditional Sources Raffles, Sophia, Lady, Memoir of the life and public services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Singapore; New York: Oxford University Press, 1991.

Known as a shrewd survivor, Iran’s ‘‘smiling powerbroker’’ worked towards building a ‘‘kinder, gentler’’ Iran.\n\nA\n\nkbar Hashemi was born in 1934 as the second of nine children of Ali Hashemi, a modest farmer and local clergyman in the remote Kermanian town of Rafsanjan—thus the family name, Rafsanjani. At age 14, Akbar Rafsanjani traveled to Qom to pursue advanced Islamic studies. He soon was involved in the ‘‘Devotees of Islam’’ agitation for nationalization of Iran’s oil industry. After the demise of Premier Mussadiq’s nationalist movement, Ayatollah Borujerdi, one of Rafsanjani’s eminent mentors, prevailed upon clergy not to criticize politicians. During this period of quietism Ayatollah Rohollah Khomeini had the greatest impact upon Rafsanjani’s formal education, which resulted in his clerical recognition as hojatolislam, a rank just below an ayatollah. With Borujerdi’s death in 1961, Ayatollah Khomeini organized mass protests against the westernizing ‘‘White Revolution’’ of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. After the Shah’s agents stormed the Qom Seminary and forced Khomeini into exile, Rafsanjani became a key operative link in Khomeini’s underground resistance. Along the way, Rafsanjani’s writings included two significant books that presaged subsequent thinking. The Story of Palestine angrily chronicles a ‘‘Black Record of Colonialism.’’ His 1967 biography of Amir Kabir admires the 19th-century Iranian prime minister’s early conception of foreign policy non-alignment. The Shah’s agents suspiciously watched Rafsanjani and meted out periodic imprisonments, tortures, and even an illegal forced stint in military service. According to an official biography, his 1975 imprisonment resulted from his efforts to ‘‘correct the ideological thinking’’ of the Mujahedin-e-Khalq guerrilla organization, an organization Khomeini later condemned as hypocritically melding Marxism and Islam.\n\nDisciplinarian of the Revolution As a prominent revolutionary player, some observers perceived Rafsanjani as a mere opportunist who aligned himself with whichever directions the revolutionary winds blew. Others denounced his moderate appearances as sheepskin covering for a hard-line ‘‘wolf.’’ However, Rafsanjani is best understood as a principled pragmatist whose coalition and consensus building efforts help explain the continuing survival of the Islamic revolution. In early revolutionary phases Rafsanjani was Khomeini’s clerical liaison to diverse dissident groups, including secular nationalists and communists. Rafsanjani later rationalized his collaboration with the Mujahedin as part of a strategy which ‘‘considered any form of struggle\n\nR A F S A NJ AN I against SAVAK [the Shah’s secret police] a blessing.’’ Rafsanjani’s revolutionary credits include: organizer of local revolutionary Komitehs, crisis foreman of Abadan oil production, member of the secret Islamic Revolutionary Council, co-founder of the Islamic Republican Party, and deputy interior minister. In May 1979 he was nearly assassinated by the Furqun (Distinction), a shadowy group claiming pious opposition to clerics in government. Rafsanjani arguably sought to slow the momentum towards extremism. When the nationalists sought elections for a constitutional review assembly, Rafsanjani warned that they would regret the resulting ‘‘fistful of ignorant and fanatic fundamentalists’’ who will ‘‘do such damage.’’ Rafsanjani subsequently was elected to the new Majlis (Islamic Consultative Assembly), which he presided over as parliamentary speaker for nearly a decade. In September 1980 Iraq’s invasion of Iran energized hawkish sentiment, Rafsanjani included. As a populist Friday prayer leader in Tehran and as a Khomeini representative to the powerful Supreme Defense Council, Rafsanjani helped undermine remaining nationalist ‘‘doves’’ by advocating harsh retribution as Iran’s war aim. Rafsanjani also backed a severe 1982 crackdown on the Mujahedin. Given Mujahedin assassinations of over 1,200 regime leaders, Rafsanjani later explained that without the ‘‘imperative’’ execution of over 4,000 Mujahedin guerrillas, ‘‘Iran would have become Lebanon.’’ Grave circumstances demanded ‘‘determined’’ means. With militant opposition crushed and Iraq on the defensive, Speaker Rafsanjani deftly maneuvered amidst years of raucous Majlis bickering over the precise social, economic, and international implications of Islamic governance. Often enigmatically seeming to be all things to all sides, his calls for just wealth redistribution did not square neatly with his reassurances to business interests about the sanctity of private property. Yet Rafsanjani could also resourcefully break impasses, as with his 1986 theatrical use of television to intimidate ‘‘conservative’’ recalcitrants from ‘‘standing up’’ to vote against an emotion laden, yet long blocked, land reform bill. (Rafsanjani’s educated [University of California] brother directed Iranian television.) Rafsanjani’s most dangerous innovation was in foreign policy. Recognizing the severe costs of Iran’s international pariah status, Rafsanjani sought to break Iran’s isolation through openings to both eastern and western countries. Outraged purists leaked the arms dealings with the United States and Israel in what became known to the West as the ‘ ‘ I ran-contra’’ affair. Yet Khomeini s quel ched recriminations with the admonition that ‘‘the path to hell is paved with discord.’’ As the warfront deteriorated in 1988, Khomeini turned over personal command of all Iranian armed forces to Rafsanjani. Still the coalition builder, Rafsanjani ended the destructive rivalries among regular, ideological, and paramilitary forces by integrating them under one command. Following American pummeling of Iranian naval units and the shooting down of an Iranian civilian airliner, Iran’s radicals called for a river of American blood. But\n\n3\n\n4\n\nRAHNER Rafsanjani and President Ali Khamenei quietly convinced Khomeini that the time had come to accept a ‘‘poisonous chalice’’ cease-fire. Rafsanjani’s nationally broadcast sermon simply asserted that ‘‘the main issue is that we can stop making enemies without reason.’’\n\nA Powerful, Pragmatic President After Khomeini’s death in June 1989, Rafsanjani soon emerged as Iran’s most powerful leader. He was a key architect of Ali Khamenei’s swift selection to Khomeini’s post as supreme spiritual guide. Policy differences between Khamenei and Rafsanjani were real, yet common bonds were much stronger. Khamenei supported Rafsanjani’s presidential election, along with the simultaneous constitutional reforms that vastly strengthened the presidency’s authority. Despite howls from the Majlis, Rafsanjani’s cabinet excluded all prominent radicals. As president, Rafsanjani continued the momentum towards pragmatic policies. In social policy Rafsanjani candidly advocated such reforms as liberalized laws on women’s privileges. In defending pursuit of Western loans and private investments, Rafsanjani castigated ‘‘statists’’ and fanatics with ‘‘religious pretensions’’ for being ‘‘frozen in their beliefs . . . and unable to adjust themselves to the circumstances of the day. Dams cannot be built by slogans.’’ Events will reveal Rafsanjani’s popularity with the masses. His relatively easygoing, often witty, Friday ‘‘prayer sermons’’ genuinely seemed to delight Tehran crowds, though grandiloquence at times undercut his pragmatic efforts. In May 1989, during services commemorating Jerusalem day, Rafsanjani opined that Palestinians could end Israeli repression if they killed five Americans for every martyred Palestinian. Official Iranian news sources quickly toned down such remarks as simply emphasizing that Israel’s depredations would be impossible without American financing. Overall, Rafsanjani’s presidency was marked by increasingly candid and pragmatic rationales for recasting revolutionary principles in light of necessity. In November 1989 Rafsanjani delighted geographic neighbors with an unprecedented renunciation of Iran’s historical policeman role for the Persian Gulf in favor of cooperative strategies. Soon thereafter Rafsanjani characterized Ayatollah Khomeini’s death decree against author Salman Rushdie for blasphemy as a mere ‘‘expert’’ religious opinion. (However, many Shiites vowed to carry out the sentence.) Such rationalization continued after Iraq’s August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Rafsanjani supported full compliance with international sanctions against Iraq, despite massive U.S. military involvement in the Gulf. Rafsanjani was reelected to a second four-year term in June 1993, but only received 63.2 percent of the vote with his opponent, Ahmad Tavakkoli, receiving 27 percent. Analysts said that the failure of Rafsanjani to win a landslide victory indicated that Iranians had lost confidence in the Islamic regime—particularly in regard to its handling of economic conditions.\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY\n\nFurther Reading Within the growing literature on Iran’s revolution and its regional and world impact, several well written and widely circulated English studies stand out: Shaul Bakhash, The Reign of the Ayatollahs: Iran and the Islamic Revolution (1984); R. K. Ramazani, Revolutionary Iran: Challenge and Response in the Middle East (1988); Robin Wright, In the Name of God: The Khomeini Decade (1989); and R.K. Ramazani, editor, Iran’s Revolution: The Search for Consensus (1990). English translations of key Iranian speeches can be found in the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, available at most U.S. Government depository libraries. 䡺\n\nKarl Rahner The German theologian Karl Rahner (1904-1984) was a major influence on 20th-century Roman Catholic thought. His work is characterized by the attempt to reinterpret traditional Roman Catholic theology in the light of modern philosophical thought.\n\nK\n\narl Rahner was born on March 5, 1904, in Freiburg im Breisgau in what is now the German Federal Republic. He followed his older brother Hugo into the Society of Jesus in 1922 and pursued the Jesuits’ traditional course of studies in philosophy and theology in Germany, Austria, and Holland. He was ordained a priest in 1932 and continued his studies at the University of Freiburg. After receiving his doctorate in philosophy in 1936, he taught at the universities of Innsbruck and Munich. In 1967 he was appointed professor of dogmatic theology at the University of Mu¨nster. He was a peritus (official theologian) at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), and in 1969 he was one of 30 appointed by Pope Paul VI to evaluate theological developments since the Council. Thomism, Kantianism, and contemporary phenomenology and existentialism are the three sources of Rahner’s thought. During his early years of seminary training, he studied the works of Immanuel Kant and Joseph Mare´chal, along with the works of the great medieval theologian St. Thomas Aquinas. While at the University of Freiburg he came under the influence of Martin Heidegger. The overriding concern of all his work was the need to bring the best thought of the past into contact with the best thought of the present.\n\nRahner’s Theology Oft en linked with Bernard Lonergan as a ‘‘transcendental Thomist,’’ Rahner employed a method characterized by an attempt to discover the general principles underlying the various doctrines of the Roman Catholic faith. In his first work, Geist in Welt (1936; Spirit in the World), he presented his interpretation of Aquinas’s doctrine of knowledge, indicating that man’s capacity to know, although rooted in the data of the senses, is nonetheless a capacity open to the infinite or to being as such. This ability\n\nRAI\n\nVolume 13\n\n30. Rahner was buried at the Jesuit church of the Trinity in Innsbruck.\n\nFurther Reading Rahner’s own writings are difficult. His The Dynamic Element in the Church (trans. 1964) and Nature and Grace: Dilemmas in the Modern Church (trans. 1964) provide good starting points for the reader interested in sampling his work. Patrick Granfield, Theologians at Work (1967), has an interesting interview with Rahner. The best study of Rahner in English is Louis Roberts, The Achievement of Karl Rahner (1967). Rahner’s ideas are presented in a simplified form in Donald Gelpi, Life and Light: A Guide to the Theology of Karl Rahner (1966). Jakob Laubach’s chapter on Rahner in Leonard Reinisch, ed., Theologians of Our Time: Karl Barth and Others (trans. 1964), provides a brief introduction to his thought. Sylvester Paul Schilling, Contemporary Continental Theologians (1966), has a critique of Rahner’s work. (Dych, William)Karl Rahner Liturgical Press, 1992.

Commonweal (April 20, 1984). 䡺\n\nLala Lajpat Rai Lala Lajpat Rai (1865-1928) was an Indian nationalist leader and was well known for his many publications regarding national problems. to transcend particular being allows man to think metaphysically—to analyze the general structure of being necessary for the actual condition of the world known through the senses. Spirit in the World, in conjunction with Rahner’s second major work, Ho¨rer des Wortes (1941; Hearers of the Word), established the epistemological and speculative foundation of his later thought. Rahner’s thought is best described as a theological anthropology. Beginning with the nature of man as a being open to the infinite, Rahner’s thought sees a person’s quest for fulfillment satisfied only in union with the God of Christian revelation, the God who became man in Jesus Christ. A proper understanding of humans cannot be divorced from an understanding of God and the context of relationships uniting humans and God. The fundamental fact underlying the existence of the world is that it stands in relation to God. Rahner calls this situation the supernatural existential and sees in this fundamental fact the root of all further explanations of sin, grace, and salvation. Rahner’s vision of theology can also be understood through his work Foundations of Christian Faith: An Introduction to the Idea of Christianity (1976). While most religious scholars see Rahner as one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century, he also encountered critics along the way. Some within the Catholic Church found his writings too radical—in the early 1960’s, Rahner’s writings could only be published after approval from the Jesuits in Rome. In March of 1984, after a birthday celebration that also honored his scholarship, Rahner fell ill from exhaustion in Innsbruck, Austria. He did not recover and died on March\n\nL\n\nala Lajpat Rai was born in the Ferozepore district of the Punjab to a respectable Hindu family. He studied law in Lahore and in 2 years passed the first examination, which qualified him to practice. While a student, he became active in the nationalist and revivalist Arya Samaj Society of Swami Dayananda. Rai joined the Samaj in 1882 and soon emerged as a prominent leader in its ‘‘Progressive,’’ or ‘‘College,’’ wing. He also taught at the Anglo-Vedic College, run by the Samaj; his fiery nationalism was largely the product of this involvement. In 1886 Rai moved to Hissar, where he practiced law, led the Arya movement, and was elected to the Municipal Committee (of the local government). In 1888 and 1889 he was a delegate to the annual sessions of the National Congress. He moved to Lahore to practice before the High Court in 1892. In 1895 Rai helped found the Punjab National Bank, demonstrating his practical concern for self-help and enterprise among Hindus. Between 1896 and 1898 he published popular biographies of Mazzini, Garibaldi, Shivajee, and Swami Dayananda. In 1897 he founded the Hindu Orphan Relief Movement to keep the Christian missions from securing custody of these children. In the National Congress in 1900 he stressed the importance of constructive, nationbuilding activity and programs for self-reliance. In 1905 Rai went as a Congress delegate to London, where he fell under the influence of the Hindu revolutionary Shyamji Krishna Varma. Later, in the 1905 Congress ses-\n\n5\n\n6\n\nR AJ AG OP A L AC H A R I sion, Rai joined Bal Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal in support of a militant program around boycott, swadeshi (homemade goods), and swaraj (self-rule for India). In 1906 he tried to play the role of mediator between the moderates and the extremists in the Congress. The following year the Punjab government arrested and transported him without trial to Burma; he was released in time for the 1907 meetings of the National Congress, when Tilak backed him for the presidency. Rai refused to accept the office for fear of a split in the ranks of that body. Rai lived in the United States from 1914 until 1920. He founded the Indian Home Rule League in New York City and published several important volumes on the Indian problem. Soon after his return to India he was elected president of the Calcutta session of the Congress. In 1925 he entered the Imperial Legislature as a member of the ‘‘Swarajist’’ group. In 1926 he broke with the leaders of the Swarajist group and formed his own ‘‘Nationalist party’’ within the legislature. In 1928 Rai led the demonstrations against the Simon Commission on Indian constitutional reforms. He was injured by the police in a mass demonstration and died a few weeks later, mourned as a nationalist martyr.\n\nFurther Reading Among Rai’s many books see especially Young India: An Interpretation (1917) and Unhappy India (1928). Extensive selections from his writings are in the works edited by Vijaya C.

He also wrote a popular version of the ‘‘Mahabharata.’’\n\nC\n\nhakravarti Rajagopalachari was born in a village in Madras and graduated from the Central Hindu College of Bangalore. He then took a law degree from the Madras Law College. In 1921 Rajagopalachari was chosen general secretary of the Indian National Congress under Mohandas Gandhi’s leadership. Soon thereafter his daughter married into Gandhi’s family. In subsequent years he was intermittently a member of the all-powerful Congress Working Committee, the top executive arm of the National Congress, and worked very closely with Gandhi.\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY\n\nGovernment Loyalist In 1937, when the Congress won the provincial elections in several Indian provinces, Rajagopalachari became chief minister of Madras. He held this position until the outbreak of World War II caused all of the Congress provincial ministries to resign. In 1942, at the time of the Cripps mission from the British Parliament to India, Rajagopalachari was among the minority of top Congress leaders who favored acceptance of the offer made by Cripps in an effort to end the political deadlock. In 1946 Rajagopalachari maintained his posture as a moderator when he advised acceptance of the Pakistan demand as the price which had to be paid for independence. Also in 1946, he became minister in the interim government which guided India in the final months up to partition and independence.\n\nParting Ways Rajagopalachari was the first Indian governor of West Bengal after independence in 1947. In 1948 he was named the first Indian governor general of India, succeeding Lord Mountbatten, the last English governor general. In 1950 Rajagopalachari was named home minister in the Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet, and in 1952 he returned to Madras as chief minister. He, however, disagreed with the Nehru government’s socialist leanings. Soon thereafter Rajagopalachari parted company with the Nehru Congress, and in 1959 he was instrumental in the creation of the antiCongress Swatantra party, which became the chief propo-\n\nRAJNEESH\n\nVolume 13 nent of the free-enterprise philosophy in the Republic of India. In 1971, Rajagopalachari organized a right-wing coalition against Indira Gandhi, but it was soundly defeated. Rajagopalachari played a prominent role in the international Ban-the-Bomb movement. Among other causes not popular with the Congress government was his campaign for religious instruction in the public schools. He also published a highly regarded, abridged edition of the Hindu epic Mahabharata . Rajagopalachari repeatedly denounced the government of India for alleged corruption, bureaucracy, inefficiency, and lack of impartiality. He died on December 26, 1972 in Madras. The Indian government proclaimed seven days of mourning for his death.\n\nFurther Reading An interesting but not comprehensive biography of Rajagopalachari is Monica Felton, I Meet Rajaji (1962).

He made the Colas the paramount power in southern India, Sri Lanka, and the southern seas. A political and organizational genius, he was also a grand patron of religion and the arts.\n\nT\n\nraditional Cola territories center on the fertile lands around Tanjore in southern India (about 220 miles south of Madras city). Representatives of the family seem to have been agents of the Pallavas during the period of that dynasty’s great achievements and subsequently to have broken away. When Rajaraja (meaning ‘‘king of kings’’) took the throne, the Colas were still suffering the consequences of invasions from the Deccan earlier in the century. Rajaraja first reduced traditional Cera rivals in the southwest (present-day Kerala) and then subdued the Pandya contenders in the extreme south. Thereafter he invaded and took control of the island kingdom of Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Next, Rajaraja’s armies conquered the territories in what is present-day Mysore State. In less than a decade Rajaraja had become master of southern India. Accompanying Rajaraja’s undoubted military genius was a talent for political and economic administration. He elaborated a network of subordinate administrators and per-\n\nfected a set of procedures which assured a reliable and efficient cohesion in his ‘‘empire’’ while allowing great autonomy to the local units. Most famous of the deeds of Rajaraja is the building of the ‘‘Great Temple,’’ the Rajarajesvara, at Tanjore. The mighty tower (vimana) that surmounts the central shrine rises 216 feet to dominate the city and the adjacent land. The stone sculpture on the tower and its base is Cola art at its most vigorous. The many inscriptions at the temple provide vital information concerning the dynasty. Rajaraja’s son Rajendra I (reigned 1012-1044, initially with his father) extended the Cola sway. One military expedition reached the Ganges. The Cola navy was strengthened, and profitable campaigns were waged in Southeast Asia. Rajendra built a new capital city, Gangaikondacolapuram (‘‘city of the Cola who brought the Ganges’’), and, emulating his father, he crowned it with an exquisite ‘‘sister’’ temple to the Tanjore shrine. Under Rajendra, the Cola dynasty flourished, as did art and literature. Though he surpassed his father’s achievement, Rajendra owed to Rajaraja the conditions and the examples without which his own achievement would have been inconceivable.\n\nFurther Reading The authoritative study of the dynasty remains K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, The Colas (1935). Several chapters in Ghulam Yazdani, ed., The Early History of the Deccan (2 vols., 1960), are useful. For the general reader, K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, A History of South India (1955), places the Colas in the context of southern Indian history from the earliest times to the middle of the 16th century. A helpful monograph on the Rajarajesvara Temple is J. M. Somasundaram Pillai, The Great Temple at Tanjore (1935). 䡺\n\nBhagwan Shree Rajneesh Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (1931-1990) was a religious leader who developed a following which included many Americans at Poona, India. In 1981 he and many followers moved to a large ranch in central Oregon in the United States and there began to build a small city as a home for his devotees. His unusual form of Indian spirituality, especially known for its encouragement of free sexual activity, attracted many followers as well as considerable controversy.\n\nB\n\nhagwan Shree Rajneesh was born at Kuchwada, India, on December 11, 1931, and received the name Rajneesh Chandra Mohan at about six months of age. He graduated from high school in Gadarwara in 1951 and went to Jabalpur, where he enrolled at Hitkarini College. He received a B.A. degree from Jabalpur University in 1955 and an M.A. in philosophy from Saugar University in 1957.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nRAJ NEESH\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY\n\nFilled with doubts which were spurred in part by his college philosophy courses, Rajneesh spent a year engaged in meditation and personal struggle. During this time he also suffered severe headaches. All of that came to a peak on March 21, 1953, when, he said, he was enlightened. Seven days earlier he had decided that his effort to achieve enlightenment was futile, and in a feeling of helplessness he had abandoned the search. As he described what then happened, ‘‘Those seven days were of tremendous transformation, total transformation. And the last day the presence of a totally new energy, a new light and new delight, became so intense that it was almost unbearable, as if I was exploding, as if I was going mad with blissfulness.’’\n\ncontemporary psychological thought. Rajneesh taught that meditation properly began with the body, not the mind; thus Dynamic Meditation involved such activities as screaming, shouting, and the removal of clothing. Rajneesh’s disciples became extremely devoted to him, feeling deeply moved simply by being in his presence, and later in 1970 he founded a sannyas (discipleship) movement for those wanting to commit themselves to him and his work. Many who joined the sannyas movement were Western, not Indian. They adopted new Indian names, wore malas (beaded necklaces with lockets containing Rajneesh’s picture), and orange and red clothing, representing the many who became sannyasin (members of the sannyas).\n\nFollowing his enlightenment Rajneesh went on to finish his studies. In 1957 he received a teaching position at Raipur Sanskrit College. The next year he became a professor of philosophy at Jabalpur University. Frenetic activity, including far-flung travels around India and controversies surrounding his unconventional ideas, marked his years there. In 1964 he began to hold organized meditation camps. In 1966 he resigned from the university. He then became more outspoken, challenging prevailing ideas about such issuesas sex, Hinduism, socialism, and the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1968 he jolted Indian traditionalists by giving a lecture in which he advised his listeners that ‘‘sex is divine,’’ that through sex one could achieve the first step toward ‘‘superconsciousness.’’\n\nRajneesh had until then been using the title ‘‘Acharya,’’ which means ‘‘teacher.’’ In 1971 he felt that he had outgrown that role, so he assumed the title ‘‘Bhagwan,’’ which means ‘‘God.’’ The change, he said, was symbolic rather than literal, indicating that his work would now not be intellectual, but a matter of direct heart-to-heart communication.\n\nIn 1970, at Bombay, Rajneesh introduced what has come to be called ‘‘Dynamic Meditation,’’ which Rajneesh synthesized from Yoga, Sufism, Tibetan Buddhism, and\n\nRajneesh and the sannyasin outgrew their quarters in Bombay, and Rajneesh, suffering from diabetes and asthma, believed that Bombay’s climate was a part of the reason for his bad health. Thus in 1974 they moved to a six-acre compound in Poona, 80 miles away. There at the Ashram Rajneesh welcomed ever-increasing numbers of followers, especially from Europe and the United States. Daily life there involved Dynamic Meditation, listening to discourses by Rajneesh, and working at an assigned job for six hours a day. Various psychological therapeutic practices were part of the program, and many trained psychologists were among those who joined the movement. Arts and crafts flowered, especially pottery and weaving. There were cultural activities, including a theatrical troupe. By the late 1970s, the six acres of the Ashram could not hold the growing numbers of sannyasin , and new land was secured 20 miles away. In 1979 the new commune at Jadhavwadi was opened. But opposition mounted as well. Dynamic Meditation, with its overt sexuality, had never been fully accepted by conservative Indians, and the movement had become one largely composed of Westerners. Criticism from outside was constant and came to a peak in 1980 when an Indian opponent tried to kill Rajneesh during a morning discourse. In 1981 Rajneesh took a vow of silence, following the example of certain other Eastern religious leaders. Now communication between Bhagwan and his followers would be purely heart to heart. That phase lasted until 1984, when Rajneesh began to give limited spoken presentations again. Continuing opposition, some of it violent, to the movement in India led to a decision to relocate in the United States. After some searching the leaders found a venerable cattle ranch for sale in an isolated spot in central Oregon, comprising an area of 100 square miles—surely a vast enough expanse to encompass any foreseeable future growth. His followers—and soon Rajneesh himself—began moving to the ranch in 1981 and started building a city which they called Rajneeshpuram. Heated disapproval from neighbors arose at once, and both public officials and\n\nRALEIGH\n\nVolume 13 private organizations acted to restrict or remove Rajneeshpuram on the grounds that it violated the state’s land-use planning laws. The prosperous commune, however, fought back in court and continued to expand its presence in Oregon, amid enormous controversy.\n\npoets. However, Raleigh’s verse differs from theirs: for their richly decorated quality and smoothly musical rhythms, he substituted a colloquial diction and a simplicity and directness of statement that prefigured the work of John Donne and the other metaphysical poets.\n\nFinally, in November 1985, the United States charged Rajneesh with immigration fraud. He pled guilty with the understanding that he would be allowed to leave the country. After a time Rajneesh returned to a commune in Poona. Meanwhile, the community’s assets—including 93 custombuilt Rolls Royces—were auctioned off. Thirteen of his lieutenants were convicted of crimes ranging from attempted murder to wiretapping.\n\nAfter 2 years in obscurity Raleigh accompanied his half brother, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, on a voyage ostensibly in search of a Northwest Passage to the Orient but which quickly degenerated into a privateering foray against the Spanish. On their return in 1579, Raleigh and Gilbert faced the displeasure of the Privy Council. Raleigh’s subsequent conduct did little to placate the Council: he engaged in several altercations and was imprisoned twice in 6 months for disturbing the peace. Once out of jail, and at the head of a company of infantry, he sailed to serve in the Irish wars.\n\nAfter returning to India in 1986, Rajneesh directed his followers to stop using the term ‘‘Bhagwan.’’ After a time failing health caused him to stop giving discourses, and word came to his followers that the name Rajneesh was also being dropped. He began to be called ‘‘Osho,’’ which he said was derived from an expression of the American psychologist of religion William James, ‘‘oceanic experience.’’ The commune in India was thereafter called the Osho Institute and Osho Meditation Centers could be found in major cities around the world. Rajneesh died of heart disease at Poona, India, January 19, 1990.\n\nFurther Reading Rajneesh’s discourses have been tape recorded for many years, and the tapes have often been transcribed into books; hundreds of those books of his teachings have been published by the Osho (formerly Rajneesh) Foundation International, and hundreds of tapes of his discourses are available. Several of his books have been published by commercial publishers; probably the most important is My Way: The Way of the White Cloud (1978). A three- volume digest of Rajneesh’s teachings on many subjects is The Book (1982). A biography of Rajneesh by a disciple, published by a major commercial press, is Vasant Joshi’s The Awakened One: The Life and Work of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (1982). 䡺\n\nSir Walter Raleigh The English statesman Sir Walter Raleigh (ca. 15521618) was also a soldier, courtier, explorer and exponent of overseas expansion, man of letters, and victim of Stuart mistrust and Spanish hatred.\n\nB\n\norn into a prominent Protestant Devonshire family, Walter Raleigh (or Ralegh) spent time at Oriel College, Oxford, before leaving to join the Huguenot army in the French religious war in 1569. Five years in France saw him safely through two major battles and the massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day. By 1576 he was in London as a lodger (not a law student) at the Middle Temple and saw his verses, prefixed to George Gascoigne’s Steele Glas, in print. His favorite poetic theme, the impermanence of all earthly things, was popular with other Renaissance\n\nIn Ireland, Raleigh spent less than 2 years on campaign. He helped condemn one of the leaders of the rebellion, bombed a Spanish-Italian garrison into surrender, and then oversaw their massacre. After some minor but well-fought engagements, he was appointed a temporary administrator of Munster. Not satisfied, he criticized his superiors and by the end of 1581 had been sent back to London with dispatches for the Council, £20 for his expenses, and a reputation as an expert on Irish affairs.\n\nProgress at Court Extravagant in dress and in conduct (whether or not he spread his costly cloak over a puddle for Elizabeth to step on, his contemporaries believed him capable of the ges-\n\n9\n\n10\n\nRALEI GH ture), handsome, and superbly self-confident, Raleigh at first rose rapidly at court. His opinion on Ireland was sought and apparently taken by Elizabeth; when he obtained a new commission for service there, the Queen kept him home as an adviser. He received more concrete tokens of royal favor as well: a house in London, two estates in Oxford, and, most lucrative, the monopolies for the sale of wine licenses and the export of broadcloth all came from Elizabeth in 15831584. Raleigh was knighted in 1584 and the next year became warden of the stannaries (or mines) in Devon and Cornwall, lord lieutenant of Cornwall, and vice admiral of the West (Devon and Cornwall). Although he was hated for his arrogance at Westminster, in Devon and Cornwall his reforms of the mining codes and his association with local privateering ventures made him very popular; he sat for Devonshire in the Parliaments of 1584 and 1586. In 1586 Raleigh succeeded Sir Christopher Hatton (newly made lord chancellor) as captain of the Queen’s Guard—his highest office at court.\n\nOverseas Ventures The patent under which Gilbert had led his expedition of 1578 had authorized him not merely to explore but to claim unknown lands (in the Queen’s name, of course) and to exploit them as he saw fit. By 1582 Gilbert had organized a company to settle English Catholics in the Americas. Although forbidden by Elizabeth to accompany his half brother, Raleigh invested money and a ship of his own design in the venture. After Gilbert’s death on the return from Newfoundland, Raleigh was given a charter to ‘‘occupy and enjoy’’ new lands. A preliminary expedition sailed as soon as Raleigh had his charter, reached the Carolina shore of America, and claimed the land for the courtbound empire builder. At the same time, Raleigh sought to entice Elizabeth into a more active role in his proposed colonizing venture: not only did he name the new territory Virginia (after the Virgin Queen) but he sponsored Richard Hakluyt’s Discourse of Western Planting and brought this great imperialistic treatise to Elizabeth’s attention. Although unconvinced, she gave a ship and some funds; Raleigh remained at court and devoted his energies to financing the scheme. The first settlers were conveyed by Raleigh’s cousin Sir Richard Grenville. Quarrels, lack of discipline, and hostile Indians led the colonists to return to England aboard Francis Drake’s 1586 squadron, bringing with them potatoes and tobacco, both hitherto unknown in Europe. John White led a second expedition the next year. The coming of the Armada delayed sending supplies for more than 2 years. When the relief ships reached the colony in 1591, it had vanished. Raleigh sent other expeditions to the Virginia coast but failed to establish a permanent settlement there; his charter was revoked by James I in 1603.\n\nRetirement from Court Raleigh played a minor role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. He organized the Devon militia and was a member of Elizabeth’s War Council but did not participate\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY in the naval battle. When he returned to court, he clashed with Elizabeth’s new favorite, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex. After the Privy Council halted an incipient duel between them, Raleigh left for Ireland, where he cultivated his estates and the friendship of his neighbor, the poet Edmund Spenser, whom he introduced to Elizabeth in 1590. The next year Raleigh was to have gone to sea in search of the Spanish plate fleet, but again Elizabeth refused permission. Grenville, who went in his stead, was trapped by Spanish galleons, and Raleigh raised a new fleet to avenge his cousin. At sea finally, he was immediately summoned back by Elizabeth. Upon his tardy return he was imprisoned in the Tower, for the Queen had discovered his alliance with Elizabeth Throgmorton, one of her own maids of honor. (Raleigh later married Elizabeth Throgmorton.) After the return of an enormously wealthy prize taken by Raleigh’s sailors, and after Elizabeth took an inordinate share of the profits, she permitted the Raleighs to go to their estate of Sherborne in Dorset. Forbidden access to the court, Raleigh devoted time to study and speculation about the nature of matter and the universe. During this time he sat in Parliament, joined the Society of Antiquaries, assisted Hakluyt in preparing his Voyages, and joined Ben Jonson and Shakespeare at the Mermaid Tavern in London. By the end of 1594 Raleigh had regained enough of Elizabeth’s favor to obtain her consent for a prospecting expedition to Guiana (Venezuela). From this he brought back many samples of gold ore and a belief in the existence of a rich gold mine. In 1596 Raleigh and his rival Essex led a brilliantly successful raid on Cadiz, and he seemed to have finally placated Elizabeth. He was readmitted to court, continued to serve in Parliament, was given a monopoly over playing cards, held more naval commands, and became governor of the island of Jersey, where he proved again to be an excellent administrator. With Essex’s execution for treason, Raleigh’s place as favorite seemed secure. But the Queen herself was near death, and Raleigh’s enemies lost no time in poisoning the mind of James Stuart, her heir apparent and successor, against him.\n\nHis Imprisonment Upon James I’s accession, Raleigh was dismissed as captain of the guard, warden of the stanneries, and governor of Jersey. His monopolies were suspended, and he was evicted from his London house. Soon after, he was implicated (falsely) in a plot against James and, upon being committed to the Tower, tried to commit suicide. A farcical trial before a special commission at Winchester at the end of 1603 resulted in a death sentence, followed by a reprieve and imprisonment in the Tower for 13 years. James stripped Raleigh of all his offices and even took Sherborne on a technicality to give to his own favorite, Robert Carr. The remainder of his property was restored, and Raleigh was well treated: his family joined him in a large apartment in the Bloody Tower; his books were brought as well. Raleigh attracted the sympathy and friendship of James’s eldest son, Henry, who sought his advice on\n\nRAMAKRISHNA\n\nVolume 13 matters of shipbuilding and naval defense. Raleigh dedicated his monumental History of the World, written during this period of imprisonment, to the prince. Henry protested Raleigh’s continued incarceration but died before he could effect his release.\n\nLast Voyage From 1610 on, Raleigh, aware of James’s need for money, sought permission to lead another search for the gold mine of his earlier Guiana voyage and at last got his way. Freed early in 1616, he invested most of his remaining funds in the projected voyage. The expedition, which sailed in June of the following year, was a disastrous failure. No treasure and no mine were found, and Raleigh’s men violated James’s strict instructions to avoid fighting with Spanish colonists in the area. Still worse, during the battle with the Spaniards, Raleigh’s older son, Walter, was killed. Upon his empty-handed return Raleigh was rearrested; James and Sarmiento, the Spanish ambassador, wished him tried on a charge of piracy, but as he was already under a sentence of death, a new trial was not possible. His execution would have to proceed from the charge of treason of 1603. James agreed to this course, and Raleigh was beheaded on Oct. 29, 1618.\n\nFurther Reading Raleigh’s History of the World, first published in 1614, has been reissued many times. A Report of the Truth of the Fight about the Isles of Acores (1591) and The Discovery of . . . the Empire of Guiana (1596) are published in Works of Sir Walter Ralegh (8 vols., 1829), which also contains works published posthumously. The standard edition of Raleigh’s poetry is The Poems of Sir Walter Ralegh, edited by Agnes M. C. Latham (1929). There is no completely satisfactory biography of Raleigh. Edward Edwards, The Life of Sir Walter Ralegh Based on Contemporary Documents . . . Together with His Letters (2 vols., 1868), lacks much material that is now available. Among the most useful works are Edward Thompson, Sir Walter Ralegh: The Last of the Elizabethans (1935), and Willard M. Wallace, Sir Walter Raleigh (1959). Raleigh’s role in natural philosophy and his connection with Thomas Hariot are treated in Robert Kargon, Atomism in England (1966). His contact with Christopher Marlowe is explored at length in M. C. Bradbrook, The School of Night: A Study in the Literary Relationships of Sir Walter Relegh (1936), and in Ernest Albert Strathmann, Sir Walter Raleigh: A Study in Elizabethan Skepticism (1951). A. L. Rowse’s The England of Elizabeth: The Structure of Society (1950) and The Expansion of Elizabethan England (1955) provide a valuable general view of the period. 䡺\n\nR\n\nama Khamhaeng was the third son of King Sri Indraditya, who had seized power in Sukhothai from the Cambodian empire of Angkor between 1219 and 1245. When Rama’s brother, King Ban Mu¨ang, died, he inherited a small kingdom in the foothills of north-central Siam. By a combination of shrewd alliances, careful diplomacy which ensured the neutrality of rivals, and forceful military campaigns, especially in the 1290s, he extended his kingdom to Luangprabang and the Vientiane region in Laos to the north, westward to the Indian Ocean coast of Burma, and south to Nakhon Si Thammarat on the Malay Peninsula. Apart from colorful but unreliable myth, almost all that is known of Rama Khamhaeng comes from his great inscription of 1292, the oldest known inscription in the Thai language and script. That lengthy document portrays the King as a father to his subjects, available day and night to petitioners for justice, liberal in his gifts and in his treatment of his vassals, merciful in warfare, and pious in his devotion to Buddhism. His state is depicted as happy and prosperous: ‘‘This state of Sukhothai is good. In the waters there are fish; in the fields there is rice.’’ Implicit in this account are policies strongly in contrast to the bureaucratic complexity, impersonality, and economic rigidity of Angkor. Sukhothai under Rama Khamhaeng was a simple state with no pretensions, where justice was to be had, trade could flourish, and peace would reign. These policies, and the strong leadership of the King, were responsible for the kingdom’s phenomenal success in detaching so much territory from mighty Angkor. Still experimenting with political institutions, however, Rama Khamhaeng’s son and successor, Lo¨ Thai (reigned ca. 1299-1346), was unable to hold the state together in the face of challenges from other Thai princes to the south, and the kingdom of Ayudhya (1350-1767) ultimately reduced Sukhothai to a province (1438). The 1292 inscription, lost for many centuries, was rediscovered by King Mongkut, then a Buddhist monk, in 1834, and the image of Rama Khamhaeng, resurrected, became a powerful ideal for subsequent rulers.\n\nFurther Reading The kingdom of Sukhothai, still relatively neglected by scholars, may be studied in George Coede`s, The Making of South East Asia, translated by H. M. Wright (1966), and in Alexander B. Griswold’s marvellous Towards a History of Sukhodaya Art (1967). 䡺\n\nSri Ramakrishna Rama Khamhaeng Rama Khamhaeng (ca. 1239-ca. 1299) was king of Sukhothai in Thailand and the founder of Thai political power in central Indochina. He remains the Thai model of the patriarchal ruler.\n\nSri Ramakrishna (1833-1886) was an Indian mystic, reformer, and saint who, in his own lifetime, came to be revered by people of all classes as a spiritual incarnation of God.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nRAMAKRISHNA\n\nB\n\norn in a rural Bengal village, Ramakrishna was the fourth of five children. His parents were simple but orthodox Brahmins deeply committed to the maintenance of traditional religious piety. As a child, he did not like routine schoolwork and never learned to read or write. Instead, he began to exhibit precocious spiritual qualities, which included ecstatic experiences, long periods of contemplation, and mystical absorption in the sacred plays of the Indian epic tradition, especially with the roles of the gods Shiva and Krishna. During his formal initiation ceremony into the Brahmin caste, he shocked his highcaste relatives by openly accepting a ritual meal cooked by a woman of low caste. Though Ramakrishna resisted orthodox priestly studies, at the age of 16 he went to Calcutta to assist his brother, who was serving as a priest for a number of local families. He was disturbed by the gross commercialism, spiritual drabness, and inhumanity of the urban environment. However, when his brother was asked to become a priest at a large temple complex at Dakshineswar near the Ganges outside Calcutta, Ramakrishna found a new and ultimately permanent environment for his spiritual maturation and teaching.\n\nSpiritual Struggles That temple complex—one of the most impressive in the area—had been built by a wealthy widow of low caste whose spiritual ideal was the mother goddess Kali. This great deity traditionally combines the terror of death and destruction with universal motherly reassurance and is often\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY embodied in a statue of ferocious appearance. She represents an immense spectrum of religious and human emotions, from the most primitive to the most exalted, and consequently has a symbolic universality not easily contained within conventional religious forms. Ramakrishna was selected to serve as priest in the Kali temple, and it was in this context that he had a series of crucial religious experiences in which he felt that Kali was calling him to a universal spiritual mission for India and all mankind. His ecstatic, unorthodox, and often bizarre behavior during this period of spiritual transformation was interpreted by many as a sign of madness; but it clearly represents an aspect of his struggles to free himself from routine religious patterns and achieve a new and more profound spirituality: he imitated the actions of the godmonkey Hanuman (a sign of humility and service); he fed animals from the same food prepared for Kali (a blasphemy to the orthodox); he cleaned an outcaste’s hovel with his hair (a terrible defilement for a Brahmin); he sang and danced wildly when the spirit moved; he rejected his Brahminical status, asserting that caste superiority was spiritually debasing—all of this symbolizing his inward spiritual transformation.\n\nSpiritual Maturity When Ramakrishna was 28, his emotional confusion subsided, and he began studying a wide variety of traditional religious teachings. His teachers were astounded at his powers of assimilation, prodigious memory, and innate spiritual skill. He was openly proclaimed a supreme sage. At the age of 33 he began to study Moslem tradition, and after a short period of instruction he had a vision of a ‘‘radiant figure’’—interpreted as Mohammed himself, which confirmed his universal religious calling. In 1868 Ramakrishna undertook an extensive pilgrimage; but despite the honors accorded him he was saddened by the poverty of the masses and took up residence with outcaste groups to dramatize their plight, insisting that his rich patrons make formal efforts to alleviate their condition. He was always a man of the people, simple, full of affective warmth, and without artificial intellectualism or religious dogma.\n\nWorld Mission By now Ramakrishna had a wide following from all classes and groups. He was not merely a great teacher; he was regarded as an embodiment of the sacred source of Indian religious tradition and of the universal ideals toward which all men strive. His spiritual vitality and magnetism were combined with a sharp sense of humor—often aimed at himself or his disciples when the hazards of pride and self-satisfaction seemed imminent. During the last decade of his life, one of the most important events was the conversion of his disciple Vivekananda, who was destined to organize and promote Ramakrishna’s teachings throughout India, Europe, and the United States. In 1886, when Ramakrishna was near death, he formally designated Vivekananda his spiritual heir.\n\nRAMAN\n\nVolume 13 Ramakrishna’s teachings do not appear in systematic form. He wrote nothing. His disciples recorded his words only in the context of the spiritual force of his personality, and consequently in collected form these sayings have the character of a gospel—a message of salvation centered in the spiritual paradigm of his own life. He rejected all efforts to worship him personally; rather, he suggested that his presentation of man’s spiritual potentialities serve as a guide and inspiration to others. Above all, Ramakrishna had a ‘‘grass-roots’’ appeal equaled by few others in any religious tradition, marked by his love of all men and his enthusiasm for all forms of spirituality.\n\nFurther Reading The sayings of Ramakrishna are available in several editions, such as The Gospel of Ramakrishna (1907) and The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, translated and introduced by Swami Nikhilananda (1942). Among the many works devoted to Ramakrishna’s life and influence are Friedrich Max Mueller, Ramakrishna: His Life and Sayings (1898); Romain Rolland, The Life of Ramakrishna (trans. 1931); Christopher Isherwood, Ramakrishna and His Disciples (1965); and Nalini Devdas, Sri Ramakrishna (1966). 䡺\n\nSir Chandrasekhar Venkata Raman The Indian physicist Sir Chandrasekhar Venkata Raman (1888-1970) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light and the discovery of the Raman effect, which has to do with changes in the wavelength of light scattered by molecules.\n\nO\n\nn Nov. 7, 1888, C. V. Raman was born at Trichinopoly, Madras, where his father taught physics in a church college. A few years later the family moved to Vizagapatam, when the father was appointed as lecturer in the local college. Raman received his early education there until he entered Presidency College in Madras in 1902. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in 1904, standing first in his class and winning the Gold Medal in physics. By the time he completed his master’s degree in physics in 1907, he had already done original work in optics and acoustics, but since at that time there was little scope for scientific research in India, he took the competitive examination for a post in the Finance Department of the government of India. Again he won first place and as a result was appointed assistant accountant general in the central government offices in Calcutta. During the next 10 years, while working in the Finance Department, Raman continued his scientific researches on his own in the laboratory of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science. The importance of his work was recognized by his appointment in 1917 to the first endowed\n\nchair in physics at Calcutta University. He kept this post until 1933. Raman’s years at Calcutta University were marked by great creativity and intellectual excitement, although by Western standards his laboratory facilities were meager. Many honors came to him as the significance of his work was acknowledged in India and abroad, as in 1929, when he was invited to do research at the California Institute of Technology. The most tangible evidence of this recognition came in 1927, when the British government conferred a knighthood on him, and in 1930, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize.\n\nRaman Effect Raman’s early scientific interests were centered on phenomena associated with the scattering of light, the most familiar example of which is the effect created when light enters a darkened room through a small hole. The beam of light is then clearly seen because the light is scattered by the particles of dust in the air. That scattered light contained wavelengths in different proportions from the wavelengths of the main beam of light had been known since Tyndall’s experiments in 1868, but a fully satisfactory analysis of the phenomenon had not been made. It was this and related problems that Raman was studying at Calcutta when he discovered that when an intense light was passed through a liquid and was scattered by the molecules in the liquid, the spectrum of the scattered light showed lines not in the spectrum of the incident light. This\n\n13\n\n14\n\nR AM A N U J A N A I Y A N G AR discovery was the Raman effect, which had such great influence on later work on molecular structure and radiation that Raman was recognized as one of the truly seminal minds in the history of modern physics. After Raman retired from Calcutta University, he became director of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, where he remained until 1948, when he became head of the new Raman Research Institute in the same city. Here he continued to guide research and to inspire his students and coworkers. They spoke of his intense enthusiasm and volcanic energy and of his great generosity in acknowledging the contribution of others. According to one former student, he would ‘‘give away whole lines of research which lesser men would be tempted to keep for themselves.’’ Raman’s attractiveness as a person was rooted in his esthetic approach to science, with his choice of subjects for investigation reflecting his love of music, color, harmony, and pattern. He told how his great discovery of the Raman effect was stimulated during a voyage to Europe in 1921, when he saw for the first time ‘‘the wonderful blue opalescence of the Mediterranean Sea’’ and began to think that the phenomenon was due to the scattering of sunlight by the molecules of water. Raman influenced Indian scientific development through the Indian Journal of Physics, which he helped found and which he edited. He was also a gifted popularizer of modern scientific ideas, and he lectured widely to lay audiences. He died in Bangalore on Nov. 21, 1970.\n\nFurther Reading Raman sets forth his own views on modern science in an attractive way in his The New Physics (1951). Some biographical details and a brief account of his scientific work are in Niels H. de V. Heathcote, Nobel Prize Winners in Physics, 19011950 (1953). A more technical discussion is S. Bhagavantam, Scattering of Light and the Raman Effect (1940). A consideration of Raman’s many-sided contribution to science is made by his students and colleagues in Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences, vol. 28 (1949). 䡺\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY reaching 1860, opened a whole new world to him, and he set out to establish the 6,165 theorems in it for himself. Having no contact with good books, he had to do original research for each solution. Trying to devise his own methods, he made some astounding discoveries, among them several new algebraic series. Ramanujan became so absorbed in mathematics that when he entered the local government college in 1904 with a merit scholarship, he neglected his other subjects and lost the scholarship. Despite two later attempts, he never qualified for the first degree in arts. Ramanujan married in 1909, and while working as a clerk he continued his mathematical investigations; in 1911 he started to publish some of his results. In January 1913 Ramanujan sent some of his work to G. H. Hardy, Cayley lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge. Hardy noticed that whereas Ramanujan had rediscovered, and gone far beyond, some of the latest conclusions of Western mathematicians, he was completely ignorant of some of the most fundamental areas. In May the University of Madras gave Ramanujan a scholarship. In 1914 Ramanujan went to Cambridge. The university experience gave him considerable sophistication, but his mind, by this time somewhat hardened, generally continued to work according to the old pattern, in which intuition played a more important role than argument. In Hardy’s opinion, if Ramanujan’s gift had been recognized early, he could have become one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. In hypergeometric series and continued fractions, ‘‘he was unquestionably one of the great masters.’’ His patience, memory, power of calculation, and intuition made him the greatest formalist of his day. But his passionate, prolific, and in some ways profound work in the theory of numbers and his work in analysis were seriously marred by misdevelopment. In 1918 Ramanujan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He died on April 26, 1920.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar The Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar (1887-1920) is best known for his work on hypergeometric series and continued fractions.\n\nS\n\nrinivasa Ramanujan, born into a poor Brahmin family at Erode on Dec. 22, 1887, attended school in nearby Kumbakonam. By the time he was 13, he could solve unaided every problem in Loney’s Trigonometry, and at 14 he obtained the theorems for the sine and the cosine that had been anticipated by L. Euler. In 1903 he came upon George Shoobridge Carr’s Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics.

A prominent figure in extra-parliamentary politics in the 1980s through his work in NUM and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU), he was elected secretary general of the African National Congress in 1991.\n\nC\n\nyril Ramaphosa was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, on November 17, 1952, to Erdmuth and Samuel Ramaphosa. His father was a policeman. He grew up in the sprawling black township of Soweto and, in his late teens, moved (like many urban young people) to complete his schooling at a rural boarding school. He finished his high school in Sibasa in the northern Transvaal in 1971 and enrolled in law at the local Bantustan university, the University of the North (Turfloop), the scene in later years of particularly violent clashes between black African students and the South African state. At the university he was heavily involved in student politics, becoming in 1974 chairman of the local branch of two black consciousness organizations, the South African Student’s Organisation and the Student Christian Movement. He knew, and like a large number of his peers, was greatly influenced by Steve Biko. In 1974 he served on various committees of the Black People’s Convention while serving with a firm of attorneys in Johannesburg. In the mid 1970s, along with many other student activists, Ramaphosa spent time in detention. On the first occasion, in 1974, he was detained for eleven months in Pretoria Central Prison. In 1976, following the outbreak of the Soweto uprising, he spent six months in the infamous John Vorster Square detention center in Johannesburg. Only his high political profile and position of leadership in the National Union of Mineworkers prevented further periods of harassment and detention in the 1980s. Ramaphosa completed his law degree by correspondence in 1981 through the University of South Africa and, disillusioned with private legal practice, joined the independent trade union movement as a legal adviser to the black consciousness-oriented Council of Unions of South Africa (CUSA). In mid 1982, in a momentous decision that was to transform labor relations in the wealthy South African mining industry, the Chamber of Mines and the South African Government announced that they would allow black African mineworkers to join unions. Union rights had always been denied to black African mineworkers, who were cruelly exploited, low-paid migrant workers living in\n\nsingle-sex, regimented barracks known as compounds or hostels. Access to the compounds was denied to families, union organizers, and other outsiders. The change of policy prompted a number of unions to try and organize the country’s 700,000 black mineworkers. CUSA detailed Ramaphosa to undertake the task, and in mid-1982 the National Union of Mineworkers was born. As first general secretary of the NUM Ramaphosa embarked on an exhausting round of union organizing, collective bargaining, and public activities that showed few signs of abating even in the 1990s. Under his skillful direction the NUM grew rapidly, learning from its mistakes and concentrating its organizing efforts on those mines where management was most receptive. Within five years the NUM had a membership of over 300,000 workers, making it the fastest growing union in the world and one of South Africa’s largest and most powerful unions. The NUM focused its campaigns on wages and working conditions and on the color bar that for years had reserved skilled mining jobs for whites only. The NUM won some significant victories in the courts and at the bargaining table. Mineworkers, denied a voice for many decades, became far more assertive and militant. In ‘‘Comrade Cyril’’ they had an articulate and confident spokesman who, though he had never been a mineworker himself, enjoyed enormous personal credibility and popularity with mineworkers. In 1987, after the breakdown of wage talks between the NUM and the Chamber of Mines, Ramaphosa and NUM president James Motlatsi led the union out on a three-week work stoppage that turned out to be the longest and costliest\n\n15\n\n16\n\nR AM C A M UL S E N strike in the history of the mining industry. The strike was also costly for the NUM. In breaking the strike, the mining companies fired over 40,000 workers. Afterwards, they made life much more difficult for union organizers and officials. The union began the slow and painful task of rebuilding morale and worker support. Ramaphosa, meanwhile, was increasingly drawn into the national political arena. In 1985 the NUM broke with CUSA and threw its weight behind the giant Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). COSATU espoused a ‘‘charterist’’ approach to national politics and forged links with the exiled political movement, the African National Congress (ANC). In 1986 Ramaphosa was part of a COSATU delegation to meet the ANC leadership in Lusaka, Zambia. In 1987 the NUM membership elected the imprisoned ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, as its honorary life president and endorsed the political platform outlined in the ANC’s ‘‘Freedom Charter.’’ When Nelson Mandela was released from prison in early 1990 and made his first public speech in 30 years from the steps of City Hall in Cape Town, Ramaphosa was at his side and introduced the veteran politician to the crowd. Mandela’s confidence in Ramaphosa was evident when he chose Ramaphosa as secretary general for the ANC on July 5, 1991. This position was second only to that of President Mandela. During the next few years Ramaphosa played a crucial role in negotiations with the former South African regime to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid and to set the stage for the country’s first democratic elections held in April 1994. He was re-elected to the general secretary post that same year and at the insistence of Mandela, also took the job of co-chairing the Constitutional Assembly. His negotiating talents and skill in building and leading effective teams made a significant difference. When pressured by ANC party politics not to seek the Minister of Fiance post, a position to which he aspired, Ramaphosa announced that he would enter private business in early 1996. Within six months he had been appointed as Deputy Chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (NAIL) and chairman of the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC). The one time activist and union founder quickly adopted to the business world. By November 1996, he was described by a reporter for the Weekly Mail & Guardian as one of South Africa’s newest millionaires with ‘‘immaculate pin-stripe suit, sober ties and gun-metal grey BMW.’’\n\nFurther Reading Interviews with Ramaphosa on labor and political issues have appeared in Leadership S. A. (1989) and in South African Labour Bulletin (1987). Consistent with the antielitism of many union leaders, he declined to be interviewed on personal matters. The history of the gold mining industry is considered in F. Wilson, Labour to the South African Goldmines (1972) and in A. Jeeves, Migrant Labour in South Africa’s Mining Economy (1985). The best overview of the Black union movement in South Africa is S. Friedman, Building Tomorrow Today: African Workers in Trade Unions (1987), which contains a chapter on the rise of the NUM. Later studies of the NUM include J. Crush, ‘‘Migrancy and\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY Militance: The Case of the National Union of Mineworkers of South Africa,’’ in African Affairs (1989) and J. Leger, ‘‘From Fatalism to Mass Action: The South African National Union of Mineworkers’ Struggle for Safety and Health,’’ in Labour, Capital and Society (1988).Information on Ramaphosa can also be found in South African newspapers such as the Weekly Mail & Guardian. 䡺\n\nRam Camul Sen Ram Camul Sen (1783-1844) was a Bengali intellectual and entrepreneur. Part of a group that inaugurated the Bengal renaissance, he proved less a prolific writer and scholar and more a gifted organizer and administrator.\n\nA\n\nKashatriya by caste and, according to his own account, a descendant of the medieval Bengali king Ballal Sena, Ram Camul Sen left a Hooghly village for Calcutta in 1790, at the age of 7. His father was proficient in Persian and secured clerical positions, and Ram Camul himself learned English, Sanskrit, and Persian in the manner of the sons of the Calcutta elite. Ram Camul found his first job in 1803, as a subordinate clerk’s assistant in the Calcutta chief magistrate’s office. The chief magistrate was evidently impressed with Ram Camul’s industrious work habits. In 1804 two scholars associated with the Asiatic Society of Bengal invited Sen to work for the Hindoostanee Press as a compositor. Despite a very low salary of 8 rupees a month, Ram Camul always performed far more than was expected of him, profited from his knowledge of English, and extended his range of contacts. In 1810, after he met the eminent Orientalist Horace H. Wilson at the Press, Ram Camul’s fortunes took a rapid upward swing. The two men developed a warm friendship that lasted until Sen’s death. Under Wilson’s sponsorship, and utilizing the skills and techniques acquired during his employment at the Hindoostanee Press, Ram Camul began his extraordinary rise as an intellectual entrepreneur. By 1814 he had been appointed the ‘‘native’’ manager of the Hindoostanee Press. In 1829 Wilson, then secretary of the Asiatic Society, proposed that members of the Bengali intelligentsia, including Ram Camul Sen, be admitted to membership in that association. In December 1833, shortly before Wilson’s departure for England to be Oxford University’s first Sanskritist, Sen reviewed his ‘‘29 years with the Society’’ in a letter accepting the post of native secretary. A year later Ram Camul completed a project by publishing the second volume of his Dictionary of the English and Bengalee Languages, one of the best efforts of its kind in the 19th century and the earliest accurate and comprehensive dictionary of the Bengali language compiled by a Bengali. The introduction to the second volume is important not only for a linguistic analysis of Bengali but for its history of modern Bengali prose from 1800, when the missionary\n\nVolume 13\n\nRAMEAU\n\nWilliam Carey was hired to teach that language to civil service trainees at the College of Fort William. Ram Camul, however, was best known during his own time as an efficient, activist intellectual whom the British frequently employed to help manage their newly introduced institutions, especially educational facilities. During the last 20 years of his life, he became the most influential Asian in associations as diverse as the Hindu College and the Calcutta Mint. Largely as a result of such administrative endeavors, when Sen died in August 1844, he left an estate estimated at 1 million rupees.\n\nFurther Reading There is only one full-length biography of Ram Camul Sen in English, Peary Chand Mitra, Life of Dewan Ram Camul Sen (1880). As with most figures of the 19th-century Bengali intelligentsia, aspects of Sen’s life and career are continually referred to in numerous books on modern Indian history, but he has not been the subject of a serious scholarly monograph. Some attempt to update Sen’s role in the light of modern scholarship is made in David Kopf, British Orientalism and the Bengal Renaissance (1969). 䡺\n\nJean Philippe Rameau Jean Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) was a French theoretician of music and a composer. His theoretical works provided the scientific basis for the development of traditional, functional harmony in the 18th century. His operas were the first national creations to rival those of Lully.\n\nJ\n\nean Philippe Rameau was born in Dijon on Sept. 25, 1683, the son of a provincial organist. It is presumed that he studied with his father, no other formal training being known. He was in Italy in 1701 and then served as organist for a time at Clermont-Ferrand. In 1706 he was in Paris, where his first collection of harpsichord pieces was published. Rameau dropped out of sight for nearly a decade, returning sometime about 1715 to his former position at Clermont-Ferrand. Here he wrote his famous Treatise on Harmony Reduced to Its Natural Principles (1722). In 1731 Rameau came under the patronage of one of the wealthiest, most remarkable 18th-century French aristocrats, La Pouplinie`re. Rameau was active as a teacher, harpsichordist, conductor, and composer in his establishment until 1753. His patron provided the necessary arrangements for Rameau to attempt his hand at opera composition. In 1733 Hippolyte et Aricie, to a libretto by the Abbe´ Pellegrin, was presented in Paris; it was Rameau’s first major public success. Les Indes galantes followed in 1735, and Castor et Pollux, generally considered to be his crowning triumph in the music theater, in 1737. These works challenged the then-prevailing taste for simpler, more tuneful diversions and entertainments, as well as the belief that Jean Baptiste Lully was the only significant composer of French\n\noperas. The ensuing quarrels in French intellectual circles over the respective merits of Lully and Rameau and later over the merits of Italian versus French music assured Rameau of lasting fame. In 1745 the King awarded Rameau a lifetime pension on the basis of his pleasure with La Princesse de Navarre, a come´die-ballet (a unification of stage play and ballet) composed for the marriage of the Dauphin to Maria Theresa of Spain. In his keyboard music Rameau followed in the steps of Franc¸ois Couperin. Nearly 20 years elapsed between Rameau’s first publications in 1706 and a second collection of orderly, elegant pieces for the harpsichord, Pie`ces de clavecin avec une me´thode pour la me´canique des doigts (1726). The Pie`ces de clavecin en concert avec un violon ou une fluˆte et une viole ou un deuxie`me violon (1741) is generally acknowledged as his masterpiece of chamber music. He died in Paris on Sept. 12, 1764. Rameau’s keyboard music is of exceptionally high quality, but he is even more widely acclaimed as a theorist. He was the only major composer who gained a reputation as a theorist before being acclaimed for composition. All his life he fought against the widely held erroneous notion that to be ‘‘scientific’’ in music is to be mechanical and lifeless. Rameau’s Treatise on Harmony established the primacy of triadic harmony as the central ‘‘law’’ of music. He claimed that melody must be subordinated to harmony and that harmonic considerations alone should dictate composition. He established the significant theoretical concept that the inversions of chords did not create new chords but were\n\n17\n\n18\n\nROY\n\nENCYCLOPEDIA OF WORLD BIOGRAPHY\n\nfurther manifestations of a single harmony. While Rameau’s ideas were much debated and attacked, their importance for the future of theory and practice cannot be overestimated. His codification of functional harmony provided much of the theoretical basis for traditional composition well into the 19th century.\n\nFurther Reading The standard biography and study of Rameau’s music is Cuthbert Girdlestone, Jean-Philippe Rameau: His Life and Work (1957; rev. ed. 1970). See also Donald J. Grout, A Short History of Opera (1947; rev. ed. 1965) and A History of Western Music (1960). 䡺\n\nRam Mohun Roy Ram Mohun Roy (1772-1833) was a Bengali social and religious reformer thoroughly identified with the cultural self-image of the people. He has been called the father of modern India.\n\nR\n\nam Mohun Roy was born to a Kulin Brahmin family at Radhanagar, Hooghly District, West Bengal. According to early biographers, as a result of wanderings over Asia in search for religious truth, he became a gifted linguist in Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Hebrew, and Greek before he was 22. New evidence suggests that his father, a zamindar (landowner) of the traditional ruling class of Bengal, lost his property in 1800, went to jail, and died a ruined man in 1803. It appears that between 1799 and 1802 Ram Mohun lent money to British civil servants in Calcutta as a livelihood. In 1804 he joined the East India Company as a subordinate official and was evidently employed in that fashion until 1814, when he retired from government service with a lucrative income from landed property.\n\nAfter settling in Calcutta in 1815, Ram Mohun challenged the orthodox defenders of the contemporary religious and social systems. In the Abridgement of the Vedanta (1815), Translation of the Cena Upanishad (1816), and the Defense of the Monotheistical System of the Vedas (1817) he condemned such common practices as caste distinction, idolatry, Kulin polygamy, and sati (or suttee; burning widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands) as excrescences upon the authentic Hindu tradition. Scripturally, that authentic tradition consisted of the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Vedanta Shastras. Historiographically, his differentiation between a pure Hinduism of a remote past and the aberrational form in existence during his own time contributed to a new historical outlook among the intelligentsia, who increasingly divided the Indian past into a golden age and a subsequent dark age. In the 1820s Ram Mohun’s aim was to provide the means for awakening India and to guide it back again into the mainstreams of world progress. He sought an ideology of religious modernism which would be compatible with\n\nIndia’s authentic tradition and equally in line with the dynamic and progressive forces shaping contemporary western Europe and America. He chose Christian Unitarianism for its rationalism and liberalism. With the assistance of a former Baptist named William Adam, Ram Mohun actually formed a Calcutta Unitarian Committee. In 1828 he and his followers founded the Brahmo Sabha, precursor of the Brahma Samaj (Society of God), which for most of the century was India’s most effective indigenous agency for social and religious reform. From 1830 Ram Mohun lived in England. In 1833 in Bristol a meeting was arranged of Unitarian leaders representing three continents: Ram Mohun of Asia, Joseph Tuckerman of the United States, and Lant Carpenter of Great Britain were the delegates. Ram Mohun died before the conference took place.\n\nFurther Reading Perhaps the best book on Ram Mohun Roy is the 1962 Sadharan Brahma Samaj edition of Sophia Dobson Collet’s The Life and Letters of Raja Rammohun Roy (1962), originally published in 1900. Dilip Kumar Biswas and Prabhat Chandra Ganguli coedited the volume, updating it with extensive supplementary notes. The most useful collection of Ram Mohun’s writings in English is The English Works of Raja Rammohun Roy (6 vols., 1945-1951), edited by Kalidas Nag and Debajyoti Burman. See also U. N. Ball, Rammohun Roy: A Study of His Life (1933), and Igbal Singh, Rammohun Roy (1958). 䡺\n\nFidel Valdez Ramos Fidel Valdez Ramos (born 1928) was inaugurated president of the Philippines in June 1992. He had the mandate to continue the democratic reforms gained by the country during Corazon Aquino’s peaceful people-power revolution of 1986.\n\nT\n\nhe eighth president of the postwar Philippine Republic, Fidel Valdez Ramos was known as a hero of the 1986 people-power revolution, the bloodless coup that ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Corazon Aquino, the widow of Marcos’ assassinated archenemy, was installed in the presidency at that time. People power was Ramos’ idea of how to fight the weapons of the Marcos regime when the dictator, losing confidence in Constabulary Chief Fidel Ramos and his defense minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, set out to destroy them. Ramos asked Jaime Cardinal Sin to send people to protect their fortress, the Constabulary Camp at EDSA (Epifanio de los Santos Avenue). Cardinal Sin appealed to the people by radio, and millions of people surrounded the camp to protect Ramos, Enrile, and the soldiers who joined them. The people at EDSA thwarted tanks and armored vehicles, and in four days in 1986 caused the flight to Hawaii of Marcos and his family. Corazon C. Aquino, who may have won a controversial election against Marcos weeks before, be-\n\nRAMPHAL\n\nVolume 13 came president, and democracy was restored after 20 years of autocratic rule. After the EDSA victory, ‘‘Eddie’’ Ramos, who had been a soldier all his adult life, served President Aquino as chief of staff of the armed forces of the Philippines and later as secretary of national defense. During the six years of Aquino’s administration Ramos defeated seven coup attempts, two of them serious. His successful maneuvers against the coups earned for him the trust and confidence of President Aquino, who, towards the end of her term, openly supported him to be her successor to the presidency. Ramos won in the May 1992 elections over six other candidates, garnering only 24 percent of the votes but winning 800,000 votes more than his closest rival. Within his first year in office he was able to win over to his side a majority of the people, who developed confidence in his government. He gained their support through a strategy of reconciliation and a strong hands-on leadership. The restoration of democracy was a long, difficult task, while at the same time Ramos had to attend to major economic and social problems that had grown during the Marcos years. Under Ramos’ presidential leadership, the Phillipines became known as the ‘‘Asian Tiger.’’ He was widely credited for reviving the country’s economy, and it grew at a brisk pace of seven percent annually through the mid1990s. Admirers of his businesslike approach called him ‘‘Steady Eddie,’’ and many foreign investors poured money into the country. He also ended crippling regulation of the telecommunications, banking, insurance, shipping and oil\n\nindustries. Meanwhile, Ramos quieted long-standing troubles with Communist guerrillas, right-wing military offices and Muslim separatists, making life in the Phillippines more stable than it had been in decades. Ramos grew up with a sense of government. His father served the Philippine Republic in the 1960s as secretary of national defense. He also came to the job of president educationally prepared, with a degree from the United States Military Academy at West Point and an engineering degree from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. In a country where law is the typical training for the presidency, Ramos came with atypical qualifications. He had only a short stint as a member of a political party, the ruling LDP (Lakas ng Demokratikong Pilipino or Fight of Democratic Filipinos), which then spurned him as their nominee for the presidency. However, Ramos ascended to the highest post in the land via a new party, the Lakas ng EDSA (Strength of EDSA) or NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats). Lastly, in a country that was 85 percent Catholic, Ramos was the first Protestant president. He was married and the father of five daughters. The unusual people-power revolution at EDSA enabled an unusual person like Ramos to lead the Philippines. In December 1996, Ramos had surgery to remove a life-threatening blockage in the artery to his brain, but he recovered. Near the end of his term, supporters advocated changing the country’s young Constitution to allow him to run for a second six-year term in 1998. They wanted to continue his steady leadership and the Phillippine economic rennaissance, arguing that no other candidate could fill his shoes as president. However, many others, including former president Aquino and the nation’s 100 Roman Catholic bishops, strongly objected. They urged respect for the Constitution, warning any such change could plunge the country back to a Marcos-like dictatorship. Ramos, ever low-key, did not reveal his plans, but told reporters ‘‘I would not want the policies, the momentum, the tremendous progress we have achieved wasted.’’\n\nFurther Reading For a biography of Ramos before his election see Jose Apolinario L.

An architect of regional integration in the Caribbean, he helped to increase the role of Guyana in world affairs.\n\nS\n\nhridath S. Ramphal—‘‘Sonny,’’ as he was widely known—was born on October 3, 1928, in New Amsterdam, British Guiana. His ancestors were Indians who arrived there in the 1880s. The eldest of five children, his father, James I. Ramphal, was a Presbyterian schoolteacher and a pioneer of secondary education in Guiana. He later became the first Guyanese to be appointed to a senior government post when he was made a commissioner in the Department of Labour soon after the outbreak of World War II. Ramphal attended a private school founded by his father in the capital city, Georgetown. He was also educated at the Modern Educational Institute, which also was run by his father. During those early years his father had a profound influence on his life, and Ramphal wrote that his father’s ‘‘passionate belief in the basic goodness within all men’’ made a deep impression on him. He completed his secondary education at Queen’s College, a government school in Georgetown. In 1947 he began his legal training at King’s College, London, and was called to the bar from Gray’s Inn in 1951. As a pupil in chambers, he worked with a distinguished barrister and politician, Dingle Foot, who at the time was chairman of the Liberal Party. He continued his studies for a Master’s degree in law and did part-time work in the Legal Section of the Colonial Office to support himself. He returned to British Guiana in 1953 and served as crown counsel in the Attorney General’s Office. It was during this period that he became interested in constitutional law and started his enthusiastic support for the creation of a West Indian federation. However, the next five years were unhappy ones, primarily because of serious ideological differences between him and the Marxist People’s Progressive Party leader, Cheddi Jagan. In 1958 he joined the federal government of the West Indies as legal draftsman. The following year he was appointed solicitor-general, and in 1961 he became assistant attorney-general. However, the federation was short-lived, and after a referendum in Jamaica it broke up. Ramphal then went to Harvard Law School for a year as a Guggenheim Fellow. He returned to Kingston, Jamaica, in 1962 and entered private practice. In 1965, while he was still in Kingston, he was invited by Forbes Burnham, the prime minister of British Guiana, to return home and become the country’s attorney-general and to begin drafting Guyana’s independence constitution. This was the beginning of his ten years in national politics. In 1967, the year after Guyana’s independence, Ramphal was appointed minister of state for foreign affairs. In 1972 he became minister of foreign affairs, and a year later he took on the portfolio of justice minister as well. He was instrumental in shaping Guyana’s foreign policy— which is based on the principle of non-alignment—and in establishing its foreign service. He was actively involved in"
