        "text": "The oldest known mathematical table was found in the ancient Sumerian city of Shuruppag in southern Iraq. Since then, tables have been an important feature of mathematical activity; table making and printed tabular matter are important precursors to modern computing and information processing. This book contains a series of articles summarising the technical, institutional and intellectual history of mathematical tables from earliest times until the late twentieth century. It covers mathematical tables (the most important computing aid for several hundred years until the 1960s), data tables (eg. Census tables), professional tables (eg. insurance tables), and spreadsheets - the most recent tabular innovation. The book is presented in a scholarly yet accessible way, making appropriate use of text boxes and illustrations. Each chapter has a frontispiece featuring a table along with a small illustration of the source where the table was first displayed. Most chapters have sidebars telling a short \"story\" or history relating to the chapter. The aim of this edited volume is to capture the history of tables through eleven chapters written by subject specialists. The contributors describe the various information processing techniques and artefacts whose unifying concept is \"the mathematical table\".\n\nNumerical tables were one of the most commonly used instruments of calculation from the earliest periods for which we have evidence of mathematical activity until the appearance of computing machines. Such tables (including graphical tables) are interesting both as tools of calculation and insofar as traces for certain social and scientific activities of the practitioners by, and for, whom they were produced. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the historical record has preserved thousands of tables from a broad range of civilizations, these tables have themselves received relatively little critical study. Hence, it has seemed to us both useful and innovative to consider the problem of tables in general by bringing together specialists of the different mathematical traditions and of the various professional milieus in which numerical tables have been developed. The workshop allowed us therefore to make significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the places and roles of tables in the history of science, and should bring us to publish a collective book on this subject.\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to study the history of the design and use of calculating machines to produce and use numerical tables, from the time of Babbage’s plans for difference and analytical engines to the modern digital computer, including in this analysis the role played by analog machines between the two. We will examine how the place and role of numerical tables changed throughout the different stages of this mechanization. It is our hypothesis that these processes of mechanization and, ultimately, automisation and digitalization, result in the progressive internalization of aspects of the dynamical relation between humans and tables into the machine. This chapter considers several major stages in the devising of machines for the making and use of tables, from difference engines to computers. Following these stages, we investigate how increasing demands for calculating power go hand in hand with advances in the new technological possibilities offered by machines. The way by w...\n\nWallace J. Eckert, Columbia University astronomy professor and IBM researcher, is best known for his pioneering work with calculating machines in the mid-twentieth century in celestial mechanics. However, Eckert also did extensive work with scientific tables. In the 1930s he developed techniques with punch card machines to reduce data for star catalogues, this also made the data machine readable and sortable. This work sped up and allowed the extension of important catalogues of stars. In 1940 Eckert became director of the Naval Almanac Office of the United States. In this position he automated the calculations used in the production of the Nautical Almanac's navigation tables using punched card machines. In the process proof-reading and typesetting were also automated. At the same time Eckert organized the publication of the new Air Almanac for airplane navigation. After joining IBM in 1945 Eckert directed work to create an automatic measuring engine of star positions on photographic plates, this was completed in the early 1950s. With this work Eckert began the digitization and automation of astronomical data that has subsequently allowed every greater quantities of data to be accumulated and analyzed. My paper will draw from published accounts of Eckert's work, supplemented by archival material, to summarize this work, its character and impact.\n\nWith an Oxford degree and close ties to both François Vìète and Thomas Harriot, Nathaniel Torporley was perhaps one of the most enigmatic contributors to the mathematics of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth-centuries. John Aubrey, in his Brief Lives, states that:\"Mr. Hooke affirms to me that Torporley was amanuensis to Vieta; but from whom he had that information he haz now forgot, but he had good and credible authority for it, and bids me tell you that he was certainly so . . . [and that] Mr Nicholas Mercator assures me that the earle of Northumberland who was prisoner in the Tower gave also a pension to one Mr Torporley, Salopiensis, a learned man; and that in the library of that family at Petworth, are some papers of his.\"Torporley published only one mathematical work: Diclides Coelometricae, seu valvae astronomicae universale, frequently described as barely comprehensible, in which he develops two lengthly sets of tables relating to spherical trigonometry and astrology. With reference to these tables, named Quadrans and Quncunx, Delambre writes:<<Cette dernière est composée de cinq parties différentes. Ces deux tables peuvent passer à bon droit pour les plus obscures and les plus incommodes qui aient jamais été construites.>> De Morgan abandoned his attempt to untangle the structure of the Qunicnux saying, “Those who like such questions may find out the meaning of the other parts of the table.” To my knowledge, no one yet has done so, nor does there exist a translation of Dicilides into any other language, nor has anyone commented on or explained the theorems developed by Torporley in order to produce his tables. In this presentation we focus on the means by which this table was generated, based upon evidence within Torporley’s work itself."
