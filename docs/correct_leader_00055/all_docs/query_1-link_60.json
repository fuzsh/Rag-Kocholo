        "text": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was set to become the longest-serving prime minister in the postwar era on Saturday by serving an accumulated 2,799 days in office, overtaking his great-uncle Eisaku Sato.\n\nAbe has been at the helm of Japanese politics since December 2012. He also served a brief stint as prime minister from 2006 to 2007 before resigning due to health issues.\n\n\"In all honesty, the past six years and eight months went by in what felt like a flash,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference Thursday, adding the government has focused on dealing with a number of issues \"such as reviving the economy, restructuring our diplomatic and defense relationships and rebuilding our social welfare system,\" under Abe's leadership."
