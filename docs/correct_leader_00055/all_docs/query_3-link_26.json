        "text": "Mr. Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen gathered here on the South Lawn of the White House:\n\nIt is a very great honor for me, not only in my official capacity representing the American people, but also personally, to welcome you, Mr. Prime Minister, to the United States again.\n\nThis is your third visit to the United States but this is indeed an historic day. As we meet here this ceremony is being carried live by television to millions of people in Japan as well as people in the United States.\n\nAnd at this same moment millions of people all over the world can see two Americans from earth walking on the face of the moan.\n\nThe magnificent welcome which was given to our astronauts when they visited Tokyo just a few weeks ago is an indication of the ties that bind our two peoples together. Today, as we look to the future of the Pacific, we recognize that whether peace survives in the last third of the century will depend more on what happens in the Pacific than in any other area of the world. And whether we have peace and prosperity and progress in the Pacific will depend more than anything else upon the cooperation of the United States and â€¢ Japan, the two strongest and the two most prosperous nations in the Pacific area.\n\nIn this period, Japan, which has the fastest growing economy of any major country in the world, will play a key role. That is why our talks are so important, because we must discuss those areas of cooperation where our two peoples and our two Governments can work together for our common goal of peace and prosperity for the whole Pacific area.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, I believe that these talks will very probably be the most successful talks that have been held between representatives of our two Governments going back over many years. I say this not only because the talks have been well prepared by both sides but also because we have the good fortune not only of being official friends but personal friends.\n\nJust a few yards to the south of us at the Tidal Basin, we can see the cherry trees that were presented by the people of Tokyo to the people of Washington many years ago. There is a Japanese proverb that \"There are no strangers under the cherry blossoms.\" This is not cherry blossom time, but I can assure you that as we meet today we meet as friends-official friends, personal friends--working together for the peace, the friendship, and the prosperity that both of our countries want."
