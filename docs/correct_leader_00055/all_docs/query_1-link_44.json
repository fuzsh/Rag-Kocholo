        "text": "Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe died on Friday after he was shot while delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara, Japan’s state broadcaster reported.\n\nThe 67-year-old was the country’s longest-serving prime minister, having served two separate stretches in the post.\n\nMr Abe resigned in 2020, cutting his tenure short a year and a month before it was due to end in September 2021.\n\nDescribing his decision as “gut-wrenching”, Mr Abe said a chronic illness which had been controlled with treatment had resurfaced. He had ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager.\n\nMr Abe remained an important figure in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after stepping down, reported NHK, and on Friday morning was out campaigning ahead of Sunday’s upper house parliamentary elections when the shooting took place.\n\nPrior to his decision to step down from the country’s top job, Mr Abe had become the country’s longest-serving prime minister by consecutive days in office, overtaking the record set by his great uncle Eisaku Sato by just four days.\n\nMr Sato had served for 2,798 days from 1964 to 1972 while Mr Abe’s days in office numbered to 2,803.\n\nMr Abe came from a family of a long line of politicians who have served in Japan’s governments over the years.\n\nHis grandfather Kishi Nobusuke was the country’s prime minister between 1957 and 1960. His father Shintaro Abe served as foreign minister between 1982 and 1986.\n\nMr Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993 when he became a member of the House of Representatives. He was subsequently reelected in seven consecutive polls.\n\nIn 1999, he was appointed Trustee in the Committee on Health and Welfare as well as the director of the social affairs division of his party, the LDP.\n\nThe following year, he was appointed deputy chief cabinet secretary in prime minister Yoshiro Mori’s cabinet.\n\nHe retained the post under the second Mori cabinet and was reappointed to the post in 2001, 2002 and 2005 in the Junichiro Koizumi cabinet.\n\nIn 2003, he became the secretary general of the LDP and in 2004, he was appointed the party’s acting secretary general and chairman of its Reform Promotion Headquarters.\n\nIn 2006, he was elected prime minister for the first time, but resigned a year later, citing health concerns.\n\nIn 2012, he clinched the top job again after a resounding victory in Japan’s general election, giving him one of the strongest political mandates for a Japanese leader in years.\n\nMr Abe came to be known for his “Abenomics” policy aimed at reinvigorating the country’s economy through a mix of fiscal stimulus, structural reforms and monetary easing.\n\nAs prime minister, Mr Abe was also known for his shrewd diplomacy.\n\nHis supporters say his legacy was building a stronger relationship between the US and Japan and bolstering Japan’s defence capacities.\n\nHe led a host of new strategic partnerships with India and Australia as well as defence agreements with southeast Asian countries along with bilateral foreign and defence partnerships with the UK and France, reported BBC News.\n\nDespite geostrategic threats from China, Mr Abe pursued cooperation with president Xi Jinping as well.\n\nIn the last year of his tenure as prime minister, Mr Abe’s approval ratings plummeted due to a number of reasons, including an unpopular increase in sales tax, which he had earlier postponed twice, and a series of corruption scandals."
