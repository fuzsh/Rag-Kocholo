Memorandum From the Executive Secretary of the Department of State (Read) to the President’s Special Assistant (Rostow)1\n\nSUBJECT\n\nSato Visit—Preparatory Meeting\n\nA meeting in the White House is scheduled on October 16 at 4:00 p.m. to discuss preparations for the visit of Prime Minister Sato on November 14–15.2 A considerable amount of work in spelling out our objectives for this visit was done in preparation for the Cabinet level talks in mid-September. For your background in preparing for the Monday meeting, the key points on the visit are summarized below.\n\nSetting:\n\nSato’s visit takes place at a time when United States-Japan relations are at a high point. They are seriously clouded only by the unresolved territorial issues of the Ryukyus and Bonins, but even here there is recognition of the need to resolve these issues without acrimony and with due regard to the problems involved for both countries and the need to strengthen our bilateral relationship. Sato also comes to Washington holding strong domestic political cards and with his economy booming. The only threat to his position and that of friendly conservative ruling elements is serious mishandling of the Ryukyu and Bonins issue.\n\nFinally, Sato has set the stage for his Washington visit by a major swing throughout East Asia demonstrating Japan’s pretentions for regional leadership with due sensitivity to residual local apprehension regarding a revived “co-prosperity sphere.” During his travels, Sato has voiced stronger support for United States Vietnam policies and will [Page 212] have visited both Taiwan and South Vietnam, areas of particular political sensitivity in Japan.3\n\nUnited States Objectives:\n\nIn broad terms our objectives during the Sato visit look both to the past and to the future:\n\n—We want and need to reaffirm Japan as our primary partner in Asia.\n\n—Looking to the future, we seek to convert this partnership into a relationship in which the political and economic burdens of regional responsibility are shared more fully.\n\nSpelling out these objectives in more specific terms, we seek:\n\n—A greater sense of Japanese commitment to securing free world interests in the region and a more responsible attitude towards the threat posed by the Chinese Communists.\n\n—Further concrete expressions by Japan of regional leadership.\n\n—Support on key United Nations issues and possibly a role in United Nations peacekeeping in the Middle East if this materializes.\n\n—Continued support and responsible action on Vietnam, with greater economic aid to the Government of Vietnam.\n\n—Adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n—Further substantial contributions on major East Asian economic development programs, including the Asian Development Bank Special Funds.\n\n—Significant reduction in our bilateral balance of payments deficit which results in part from increased military-related expenditures in Japan during the Vietnam conflict.\n\nMajor Problems:"
