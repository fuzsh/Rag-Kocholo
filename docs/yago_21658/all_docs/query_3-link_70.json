When I saw what the camera has captured close up, the drama of this now classic love story, the continuing story of the Phantom and Christine, I was sure it would be embraced world wide.\n\n‘The DVD was released in Australia just weeks ago and now it’s making a splash in the U.S. I think the DVD is going to be a huge success internationally.’\n\nstars Ben Lewis as The Phantom, Anna O’Byrne as Christine. Maria Mercedes as Madame Giry; Sharon Millerchip as Meg, her daughter, and Simon Gleeson Christine’s husband, Raoul.\n\nLove Never Dies had its premiere in London in March 2010 and in 2011 was extensively re-worked in by an Australian creative team put together by Tim McFarlane.\n\nThe musical was given an entirely new look by an Australian creative team: directed by Simon Phillips with new set and costume designs by Gabriela Tylesova, choreography by Graeme Murphy, lighting design by Nick Schlieper, sound design by Mick Potter and musical supervision and direction by Guy Simpson.\n\nThe musical had its Australian premiere in Melbourne’s Regent Theatre on Saturday May 28 and played there until December before going to Sydney’s Capitol Theatre in January, where it will close on April 1.
