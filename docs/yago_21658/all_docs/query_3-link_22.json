        "text": "Love Never Dies was filmed live in Melbourne last September. The musical received a fresh Australian production in spring 2011 under the direction of Priscilla Queen of the Desert director Simon Phillips.\n\nThe Australian production of Love Never Dies differed from the now-closed London world-premiere staging. A completely new Australian creative team, including scenic-costume designer Gabriela Tylesova, gave the production a darker, more brooding approach. It also incorporates revisions to the script and score first implemented in a London overhaul in fall 2010.\n\nBen Lewis, who appeared in the original Australian casts of Priscilla Queen of the Desert and Spamalot, stars as the Phantom, opposite Anna O'Byrne as soprano Christine Daa√©. O'Byrne previously played the role in an Australian tour of The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nLove Never Dies has a score by Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tony nominee Glenn Slater (Sister Act, The Little Mermaid). The book is by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton and Slater. Phantom lyricist Charles Hart is also credited with additional lyrics for the latest incarnation of the sequel."
