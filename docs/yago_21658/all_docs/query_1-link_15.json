        "text": "While no dates have been announced, the official website for the musical states that a U.S. national tour is planned. Love Never Dies was previously screened in U.S. cinemas in 2012. It is currently available on DVD.\n\nA representative for Lloyd Webber issued the following statement, \"There is no official announcement at this time, but after the success of the show in Sydney and Melbourne and subsequent DVD, Andrew Lloyd Webber is delighted by the interest and looks forward to American audiences seeing this Australian production.\"\n\nLove Never Dies has a score by Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tony nominee Glenn Slater (Sister Act, The Little Mermaid, Leap of Faith). The book is by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton and Slater. Phantom lyricist Charles Hart is also credited with additional lyrics for the latest incarnation of the sequel.\n\nSet ten years after the conclusion of The Phantom of the Opera, Love Never Dies follows soprano Christine Daae to New York's Coney Island, where she is invited to perform for the mysterious Mr. Y. Characters from her past begin to emerge, including one with whom she shares a dark secret.\n\nFollowing a 2010 London premiere, which was not critically embraced, Lloyd Webber enlisted director Simon Phillips and a new Australian creative team to stage a fresh production of the lavish musical, which traces the relationship of the Phantom and soprano Christine from Paris to Coney Island. It premiered in Melbourne in 2011."
