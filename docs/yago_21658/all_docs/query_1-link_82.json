        "text": "Love Never Ends (Wo ai ni!)\n\nChina (2023) Dir. Yan Han\n\n“You’re never too old” they say but I’m old and going nowhere fast. Okay, so maybe I’m a jaded contrarian in this case as there are numerous instances of people getting a new start in life in their twilight years. But finding love? It’s going to take a lot to convince me of that. Over to you, cinema.\n\nCranky widower Chang Weije (Ni Dahong) witnesses a squabble in the park involving feisty widow Li Huiru (Kara Hui) and some younger people. Weije intervenes and causes more trouble as well as incurring the ire of Huiru. Later, when Wieje takes his grandson to audition for former Peking opera singer Qui Huaxing (Lu Qiuping), he is shocked to find Huiru is Qiu’s housekeeper.\n\nLearning Huiru relies on collecting rubbish for an income, Wieje secretly helps out, in the process making friends with recycling dealer Xi Dingshen (Tony Leung Ka Fai) and his dementia riddled wife Zhao Huanxin (Cecilia Yip). As this elderly quartet bond, Wieje and Huiru become a couple and find their lives rejuvenated. But old age and fate conspire against their happiness.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a film snob, if Love Never Ends were a Hollywood film it would be a twee comedy of errors that turns into an overwrought emotional drama with a cast of still-photogenic septuagenarians. Forgive such harsh words but it struck me quite hard whilst watching the latest from Yan Han, just how relatable and credible the depiction of the elderly is. Unfortunately, cinema tends to lean towards the trope of old = decrepit or over-exaggerating the more robust pensioners, with no realism either way.\n\nWith more than just offering romantic hope to senior citizens on offer, this film also looks at the role of the aged in modern society, marginalised and taken for granted by family as well as their communities. Yan Han himself is not even 40, implying this isn’t an exercise in standing up for his age group but a possible personal investment in the topic, or for writers Li Cheng and Kang Full.\n\nOpening with Weije lying to his doctor about his drinking, we get a quick reading on his personality. Coupled with his Nirvana T-shirt and the fact he carries a whip, the air of a rebel about him is prevalent. Yet, when he wades into the argument in the park, he sides with the younger people not Huiru, even drawing his whip against her. Not the meet cute you’d usually find to start a budding romance but it does set the ball rolling for a slow burn, obstacle filled growth of mutual affection.\n\nHuiru often helps tend to Huanxin which is how Weije becomes integrated into the group, and gets closer to Huiru. An interesting dichotomy is formed when Weije and Huiru start to date, acting like teenagers exchange text messages on their phones, collect rubbish and enjoy days out, whilst Dingshen and Huanxin already have those experiences and stay together through Dingshen’s devotion to his ailing wife.\n\nMost importantly, one does not infringe upon the other; no jealousy from Dingshen or lame attempts to keep up with them, it’s the four of them against the world. A birthday party for Dingshen suffers from the actions of his family – the kids are on their phones, a daughter-in-law sprays everything with sanitiser, and her husband keeps taking work calls. Dingshen is too polite to say anything but Weije is ready to blow.\n\nSadly, it takes a tragedy for Weije to lose his rag and say his piece in the only scene that feels too over thought for the point being made. That said, it was no doubt constructed as a cathartic lashing out to remind the young what respect and honour is, and more importantly, family members are people, not an inconvenience to be forgotten once their usefulness has expired.\n\nRunning concurrently to the main romance of Weije and Huiru, is a subplot of sorts involving a former school principal pushing around a wooden doll in a wheelchair he is convinced is his missing wife. The wife – whom we already know – is also lost in her own world, never going out and similarly suffering from mental fragility. Huiru proffers that the principal is lucky to have the doll in his life as it will never get sick or die; Weije counters the doll is no substitute for a real person, dementia or not.\n\nBy using love as a way to reinvigorate the lives of two seniors, one might extrapolate an intention by Yan Han to remind the film industry that older actors still have value and their age shouldn’t preclude them from storylines deemed only suited to the young. It may be hokey, but the montage of Weije and Huiru on their romantic highs is uplifting and crucially, shows them doing so on their terms. Yan Han may have indulged in a few clichés here and could have easily been ironic, yet it is still infectious.\n\nThere are not enough superlatives to praise the performances and warm interplay between the four principals, a product of insight only rich life experiences can provide. They are all in their 60s and made to look older, though this diminishes nothing – Ni Dahong is the bulldog with a poodle’s heart, Kara Hui has reinvented herself since her kung fu queen days, Tony Leung discards years of macho presence to be so humble, and Cecilia Yip, the baby of the group, has the toughest role being mostly silent and addled.\n\nPacked with so much to take in yet simple to understand, Love Never Ends defies many conventions as much as it embraces their basic traits to make a valid point about the curbs and limits society arbitrarily creates regarding age. In doing so, it is not afraid to confront the negatives to highlight the positives, breaking our hearts as well as warming them. As enriching and celebratory an experience as it is poignant and moving one."
