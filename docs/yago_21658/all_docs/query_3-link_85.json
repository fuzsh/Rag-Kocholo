        "text": "‘Love Never Dies In Concert’\n\nat Theatre Royal Drury Lane this summer\n\n21st and 22nd August\n\nThe world’s most famous opera ghost returns to the West End for 2 nights only with much-loved stars reprising the roles of Phantom and Christine in star-studded concert\n\nSign up for exclusive pre-sale released today (Wednesday 24th May);\n\npre-sale starts Friday 26th May\n\nhttps://lwtheatres.co.uk/loveneverdies\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber’s iconic Love Never Dies returns to London’s West End this summer in a star-studded concert at LW Theatres’ Theatre Royal Drury Lane.\n\nBroadway legend Norm Lewis (Les Misérables 25thAnniversary Concert, Jesus Christ Superstar) stars as The Phantom after a hugely successful run as the first African-American Phantom in the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera. Celinde Schoenmaker (Guys & Dolls, Rocketman) stars alongside him as Christine, following her appearance in London’s West End for the 30th anniversary of The Phantom of the Opera. Shaun Kerrison (My Fair Lady, A Christmas Carol) directs. Further casting and creatives to be announced.\n\nLove Never Dies In Concert, which features the sensational ‘Til I Hear You Sing and the heart-breaking Love Never Dies, is accompanied by the 27-piece London Musical Theatre Orchestra (LMTO), and will run at Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 21st (7.30pm) and 22nd August (2.30pm).\n\nA closed pre-sale (via sign-up) starts on Friday 26th May, with a general on-sale to follow in due course. Sign up for pre-sale, released today, via: https://lwtheatres.co.uk/loveneverdies.\n\nThis concert comes as The Phantom of the Opera in London’s West End continues to break records at the box office, 36 years after opening at the recently-renamed His Majesty’s Theatre on Haymarket.\n\nNorm Lewis comments: My love for Andrew’s ‘Love Never Dies’ meant this was the quickest yes, the moment I was asked! I am honored to don the iconic Phantom mask yet again, and continue the story of a character that forever changed my life. And to perform it at the famous Theatre Royal Drury Lane? There’s nothing greater. I cannot wait to be reconnected with the London audiences!”\n\nDescribed by The Daily Telegraph as “one of the greatest of all Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musicals”, Love Never Diesreturns to the story of The Phantom of the Opera 10 years after the Phantom’s disappearance from the Paris Opera House. Escaped to a new life in New York, he has finally found a place for his music to soar. All that is missing is his love – Christine Daaé. In a final bid to win her back, the Phantom lures Christine, her husband, and their young son Gustave to America to perform one final time. As old wounds are reopened and forgotten memories unlocked, The Phantom sets out to prove that, indeed, Love Never Dies.\n\n‘Love Never Dies In Concert’ is produced by Fourth Wall Live and the London Musical Theatre Orchestra, and arranged with the permission of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group, with a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics by Glenn Slater, and a book by Lloyd Webber, Slater, Ben Elton and Frederick Forsyth.\n\nTheatre Royal Drury Lane is owned and operated by LW Theatres. The venue reopened in June 2021 following a total, £60m, 2-year restoration.\n\nTOWER (OF LONDON) – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nThis boisterous, outgoing piece by writer John Dinneen strikes a very careful balance between social commentary and narrative entertainment (the material could so easily slip into mere public service address if mishandled). It is a love letter to the imperilled youth centre and its inherent benefits to the ecosystem of a community, so often a … More TOWER (OF LONDON) – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nTWO COME HOME – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nThe audience is going to have to accept writer/actor Joe Eason’s hothouse, Southern Gothic production on its own terms. No time elapses before a viewer is thick in the coarsely emotional mess of a rural Kentuckian home in a town long past collapse. Ex-convict Evan (Eason) paces like a caged animal, chewing at the sides … More TWO COME HOME – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nTOOTHPASTE AND CIGARS – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nGiven the plethora of 80’s rom-com film references in this script from Canadian playwrights T.J. Dawe and Michael Rinaldi, it is only proper that protagonists Wallace (Thomas George) and Chantry (Tarini Tiwani) get their own meet-cute in this winning two-hander from new company Tee Off. The vastly appealing George and Tiwani have a beautifully natural … More TOOTHPASTE AND CIGARS – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nTHE FABULIST – REVIEW – CHARING CROSS THEATRE\n\nby Anne Reimers\n\nCharing Cross Theatre continues its display of exciting new musicals with a production of The Fabulist; although in all honesty, The Fabulist is far from your bog-standard musical. Based on Giovanni Paisiello’s 18th-century opera The Imaginary Astrologer, James P. Farwell has created a lively operetta set in the politically charged atmosphere of 1920s Fascist Italy. … More THE FABULIST – REVIEW – CHARING CROSS THEATRE\n\nI LOVE TO FLY – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE\n\nby Tom Carrao\n\nA newly christened pilot, still in graduating attire, giddily awaits his inaugural flight. He bounces about the stage in anticipatory cheer, chatting to the audience, marvelling at the grandeur of aerodynamics, breathless at the ahead-of-the-times aeronautical scribblings of Leonardo da Vinci. On the screen behind the sleek figure of a jet plane throbs with almost … More I LOVE TO FLY – REVIEW – CAMDEN FRINGE"
