        "text": "Released in 1990, “Ghost” is a film that easily makes most Top 25 romantic fantasy lists. The movie, directed by Jerry Zucker, intertwines a particular aspect of the supernatural that appeals to so many with sudden loss, eternal love and drama. “Ghost” stars the talented trio of Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg, whose outstanding performances brought the characters to life (no pun intended).\n\n“Ghost” tells the story of Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), a successful banker deeply in love with Molly Jensen (Demi Moore), an artist. Sam and Molly are true soulmates but their idyllic lives come to an abrupt and tragic end when Sam is murdered during a mugging. Or does it? Sam’s spirit refuses to leave the mortal world when he discovers that his death was not a random act of violence but a calculated murder connected to a large sum of missing money from his bank.\n\nUnable to communicate with Molly directly, Sam seeks the help of a reluctant psychic, Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). Oda Mae is a self-proclaimed con artist who discovers that she has inherited her mother’s ability to genuinely communicate with the spirit world. Oda Mae becomes the vital link between Sam and Molly, and through her, Sam attempts to protect Molly from danger while seeking justice for his untimely death.\n\nThe success and enduring popularity of “Ghost” can be attributed, in large part, to the stellar performances of its lead actors.\n\n* PATRICK SWAYZE AS SAM WHEAT: Patrick Swayze’s portrayal of Sam Wheat was remarkable. He embodied the character with a perfect blend of charm, vulnerability, and determination. Swayze convincingly portrayed the transformation of Sam from a carefree and successful banker to a tormented spirit, grappling with the unfinished business of his untimely death. His on-screen chemistry with Demi Moore was palpable, and their genuine connection made their love story all the more believable and touching. Swayze conveyed a range of emotions, from intense love and protectiveness towards Molly to frustration and anger at being unable to communicate with her directly.\n\n* DEMI MOORE AS MOLLY JENSEN: Demi Moore delivered a powerful and emotionally charged performance as Molly Jensen, a grieving artist trying to come to terms with the loss of her beloved Sam. Moore portrayed Molly’s grief, pain and confusion with a vulnerability that made her character relatable to viewers who have experienced loss. Her ability to convey the depth of her character’s emotions further intensified the film’s dramatic moments, making the audience empathize with her journey of healing and acceptance.\n\n* WHOOPI GOLDBERG AS ODA MAE BROWN: Whoopi Goldberg’s portrayal of Oda Mae Brown was the film’s standout performance. Goldberg brought her signature wit, charm and comedic timing to the role, infusing the film with moments of fun and laughter. Oda Mae is a skeptical psychic who discovers her genuine connection to the spirit world through her interactions with Sam’s ghost. Her chemistry with Patrick Swayze was delightful and added an extra layer of heart to the film. Goldberg’s portrayal of Oda Mae went beyond comedic relief, as she also conveyed the character’s growth and transformation throughout the story. Whoopi Goldberg made Oda Mae a beloved and memorable character and earned a well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as well.\n\n1990 BEST PICTURE AND OTHER OSCARS\n\n“Ghost” is renowned for its memorable dialogue, with several quotes that have become iconic and continue to be celebrated by fans. These quotes capture the essence of the film’s themes, the power of love, and the enduring nature of connections beyond life and death. Here are some of the most iconic quotes from the movie:\n\n* “DITTO.” – SAM WHEAT (PATRICK SWAYZE): This simple yet powerful word becomes an endearing expression of love between Sam and Molly. Sam uses “Ditto” throughout the film as a response to “I love you,” signifying that his love for Molly is so profound that words cannot fully express it. The word gains deeper meaning after Sam’s death when Molly hears it from an unexpected source, proving that love can transcend the boundaries of the physical world.\n\n* “THE LOVE INSIDE, YOU TAKE IT WITH YOU.” – ODA MAE BROWN (WHOOPI GOLDBERG): This poignant line is delivered by Oda Mae Brown when she first discovers her ability to communicate with spirits. Oda Mae’s realization that love is not bound by death but continues to exist within the soul after passing adds a profound dimension to the film. The quote reinforces the idea that love is eternal, and even in death, its presence endures.\n\n* “IT’S AMAZING, MOLLY. THE LOVE INSIDE, YOU TAKE IT WITH YOU.” – SAM WHEAT (PATRICK SWAYZE): Sam echoes Oda Mae’s message when he finally manages to communicate with Molly through her. This quote reinforces the film’s central theme of love transcending death and the idea that love remains an intrinsic part of the human spirit even after passing into the afterlife.\n\n* “I LOVE YOU, MOLLY. I’VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.” – SAM WHEAT (PATRICK SWAYZE): In a powerful and emotional scene towards the film’s end, Sam verbally expresses his love to Molly through Oda Mae. This declaration affirms the enduring strength of Sam’s love and brings closure to their relationship, allowing them to find peace and acceptance in their shared love for each other.\n\nRoger Ebert didn’t completely pan “Ghost” but he didn’t recommend the film either. Gene Siskel, on the other hand, thought Ebert was being too nitpicky and that the film would resonate with a wide audience. As it turned out, “Ghost” was a mega success, grossing over $505 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing film of 1990. Audiences were drawn to its powerful storytelling, the chemistry between the lead actors, and its emotionally charged moments. “Ghost” earned 5 Academy Award nominations, winning Best Original Screenplay for Bruce Joel Rubin and Best Supporting Actress for Whoopi Goldberg. The film also re-popularized the Righteous Brothers’ 1965 hit “Unchained Melody”. Two versions (the original and a new recording) were released in 1990 with both making the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously. Unlike the original 1965 song, the 1990 reissue hit No. 1 in many countries."
