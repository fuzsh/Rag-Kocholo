        "text": "If any of you ever watch the PBS channel, perhaps you caught a glimpse of their showing of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Love Never Dies” (Australian cast). LND is the breathtaking sequel to “The Phantom of the Opera”, which has earned the title of Broadway’s most haunting love story. Did the sequel live up to the expectations it’s big brother set?\n\nIn my opinion, it did. Of course, no sequel is as good as the original, but the music and plot was still as genius as the man who created it. For those of you who don’t know, Love Never Dies answers the question, “What happened next?” LND takes place ten years after Christine and Raoul fled the Phantom’s lair and the Phantom seemed to disappear for good. In this story, Madame Giry and her daughter, Meg, smuggled the Phantom to Coney Island, where he began his own show and became known as “Mr. Y”. Meg becomes the “Ooh-La-La Girl” of his show, soon being the main attraction.\n\nOf course, the Phantom’s true genius compositions are never released into “Mr. Y’s Phantasma” show. He must compose cheesy, roadside show type music to keep the arrogant Americans interested, as the time period called for that genre of show. In the course of all of this, Meg is trying desperately to earn the Phantom’s approval, and to finally give her one of his genius music pieces to perform. However, all the Phantom is thinking of is Christine Daaé.\n\nWhen the focus turns back to the Phantom’s point of view, he performs the song “Till I Hear You Sing”, declaring that, “And come what may, I swear, somehow, some way, I will hear you (Christine) sing once more!” This ends up being a musical piece often repeated throughout the play for short medleys.\n\nIn his determination to hear Christine sing once more for him, he lures her to Coney Island, under the name “Mr. Y” (though in the PBS airing of it, it was changed to that she had to originally sing for a man named Hammerstein who was opening his new theatre) to sing for money. This is when you become informed that Raoul had lost his fortune at a Roulette table in Monte Carlo, and in the process has become weak and a drunk. Also, you discover that they have a ten year-old boy named Gustave (some of you may recall Christine’s father was named Gustave as well). From the very beginning, Gustave shows a burning curiosity, wanting to explore the Island and go to Phantasma. That is when a carriage, that is not being pulled by horses, arrives to take the family to the inn. Mr. Y’s main freakshow stars, Dr. Gangle, Mr. Squelch, and Miss Fleck, all come out to greet them, infuriating the proud Raoul de Chagny. You see Christine recognise the familiar genius about the carriage and become slightly frightened. Gustave, however, is entranced and is eager to enter the carriage. (In the Australian version, the family believes that the carriage WAS sent by Hammerstein. In the original play, they know it was sent by Mr. Y, though they have no idea who Mr. Y really is.)\n\nWhen the de Chagny family reaches their room at the inn they are to stay at, Raoul goes off on a rant of anger, feeling as if he’d been humiliated. “What a dreadful town, what a vulgar place! What an awful mistake to have come here! To be on display in that shameless way, to the crude, common, lower-cast scum here! How do they dare to treat us so?” In the midst of his ranting, the sweet Gustave keeps asking Raoul to play with him, as the trio of freaks (Gangle, Squelch, and Fleck) had given him a new toy. Finally, Raoul shouts at him. He yells at him again when Gustave begins playing the piano in their room, as a song’s sheet music had been left on the piano for them. Christine hears the familiar edge, and again shows that she is frightened. She then begins to console Raoul, and says that they should leave that night if it would ease his anger. “Leave the hurt behind,” Christine sings softly to him.\n\nNow, once again, the original version of the play (England) and the version PBS aired (Australia) differ slightly in the plot here.\n\nEnglish version:\n\nRaoul declares he needs some air, and Christine begs him not to drink anymore. He says nothing and leaves. Gustave then turns to Christine and says, “Father never plays with me. Doesn’t he love me?”\n\nAustralian version:\n\nRaoul gets a note from Hammerstein, asking him to meet him down at the bar. Raoul’s anger ceases and he grins, saying that Hammerstein did know how to pick a rendezvous location. He leaves quickly. Gustave then turns to Christine and says, “Father never plays with me. Doesn’t he love me?”\n\nThis is where the plots once again merge and Christine begins her first song of the play, “Look With Your Heart”. This foreshadows how Gustave is being taught to react when he sees the Phantom, as Christine tells him in the song, “So open your arms, and close your eyes tight, look with your heart, and when it finds love, your heart will be right.”\n\nGustave joins in in the song, then they say goodnight. This scene in particular shows the special bond between the son and his mother, and how easily they communicate. After Gustave leaves the room, Christine picks up his strange toy, as it had begun to play its melody again. Once again, she recognises the dark and beautiful edge to the tune, and she stiffens. She puts the toy away from her. And that is when what the whole audience is waiting for occurs.\n\nThe Phantom enters her room (of course with dramatic music and fog pouring from the entrance), causing Christine to faint from shock. He carries her to a chair, sets her down, and reaches out to caress her face, only to flinch back when she awakes and gasps.\n\nEnglish version:\n\n“I should’ve known that you’d be here,” she sings. “I should’ve known it all along. This whole arrangement bears your step. You’re in each measure of that song. How dare you try and claim me now! How dare you come invade my life!”\n\n“Oh Christine, my Christine, in that time when the world thought me dead, my Christine, on that night just before you were wed….ah Christine! You came and found where I hid! Don’t you deny that you did, that long ago night…”\n\n“That night…”\n\n“Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky. Too dark to see a thing. Too dark to even try.”\n\n“I stole to your side, to tell you I must go. I couldn’t see your face, but sensed you even so.”\n\nAustralian version:\n\n“So it was all an empty lie? One final lie to fool us all? To make your death our story’s end? To put your life beyond recall? How dare you come and claim me now! Invade my life, ensnare my voice!”\n\nThe Phantom replies, “If you could know the pain I’ve known, then you would know I had no choice! My Christine -”\n\n“Your Christine! I was yours one brief night long ago. Long ago, with a man I no longer know.”\n\n“Ah Christine! You came and found where I hid! Don’t you deny that you did! That long ago night…Once there was a night beneath a moonless sky. Too dark to see a thing. Too dark to even try.”\n\n“I stole to your side, tormented by my choice. I couldn’t see your face, yet trembled at your voice.”\n\nIn this song, you might notice that the main music for the chorus is taken from the music at the beginning of the medley “Journey to the Cemetery” (from The Phantom of the Opera). In “Beneath A Moonless Sky”, Christine and the Phantom reveal they slept together on the night before Christine was married. The Phantom left her while she was asleep, despite her being in love with him. “Ashamed of what I was….afraid to see your eyes…”\n\nChristine then declares that they were not to get back together. The Phantom requests that she sings for him one last time. In the Australian version, he says he knows what Hammerstein is paying her and will double the amount for one night’s work. She refuses. In my point of view, why refuse? You know the Phantom will find some horrible threat to make her do it anyway.\n\nAnd so he does. Gustave runs out to Christine on the balcony where she and the Phantom stand, telling her he just had a nightmare. She calms him and introduces him to “Mr. Y”. The Phantom then lifts Gustave onto the railing of the balcony (frightening Christine) and offers to show him any part of the island he chooses. “I can grant any wish!” Gustave tells him that he wants to see “all that’s strange, and wild, and dark, in the shadows of the park.”\n\nThe Phantom chuckles and agrees. After Gustave leaves, the Phantom threatens Christine.\n\n“Help me through this sadness, do this kindness for your mentor, or that progeny…that perfect specimen, may disappear on Coney Island. Vanish here on Coney Island…”\n\nChristine then agrees to do it. The Phantom hands her the sheet music on the piano, telling her that that is what she is to sing. “One song composed by me!”\n\n“And then we’re free to leave?” she asks.\n\n“And will of course receive a princely fee! Is it on with the show? Does he stay? Does he go?”\n\nAfter the Phantom leaves, Christine looks over the sheet music, humming the melody. Her eyes then widen, and she gasps. She runs out towards the balcony where the Phantom disappeared, only to see he’s gone. She is obviously shocked at the composition.\n\nThe next day, Raoul, Christine, and Gustave meet up with Meg and Madame Giry backstage, and they all discover that the Phantom is behind their meeting. Meg is crushed, as Madame Giry overheard the Phantom composing Christine’s piece, and had assumed that the piece was for Meg to sing, and thought she had finally earned his approval. Raoul is furious that Christine knew and didn’t tell him, and leaves to go to the bar.\n\nGustave disappears. Meg and Christine search for him, but Gustave is well looked after. He is led down by the freakshow trio to go and meet the Phantom. He is in awe of the Phantom’s realm, and begins to play his piano softly, performing a song of his own. It shows the same dark beauty that the Phantom’s music shows.\n\nThe Phantom then puts two and two together. “He’s just ten years old….ten years old!”\n\nHe then shows Gustave his world, all his creations, and he learns that they see the very same way. That they think exactly alike.\n\nHe then takes off his mask, and Gustave shoves him back and screams in terror, shocked. Personally, my heart broke. But, I couldn’t bring myself to blame Gustave. I mean, come on, he’s only ten years old.\n\nHe runs to Christine, and Christine has Meg take Gustave back to their room. She then reveals to the Phantom that Gustave is his son.\n\nAustralian version:\n\nThe Phantom sobs, “He sees me and shuns me, as you did once. Take him now! Take him and go! Go now! Be free! But swear one thing to me: he will never ever know.”\n\n“I swear it, believe me, you know you have my word. And I promise you this music won’t remain unheard. This music, your music, will live again. One last time, just as I swore!”\n\nBoth sing together, “And soul to soul, we will once more be whole…”\n\nPhantom: “When I hear you sing….”\n\nChristine: “Once more.”\n\nEnglish version:\n\nChristine sings, “Forgive me, I beg you, if you can. I’ve brought you nothing but woe. Tomorrow night I’ll sing with all my might. Sing for you again, then we’ll go.”\n\nThe Phantom then declares that Gustave will have all he can give. “All I create on this earth, all that I’ll never be worth, all shall be his!”\n\nMme Giry overhears this whole exchange, and is angered. She declares that “all that we’ve worked for will go to that child!” Her rant of rage ends the first act.\n\nThe second act begins with Raoul at the bar, wondering why Christine loves him. He bumps into Meg, and learns that she is having a hard time on Coney Island. “This town is coarse and cold and mean, it’s hard to keep your conscience clean,” she tells him. She warns him that he and his family must leave immediately, as Christine will be the Phantom’s as soon as she sang for him.\n\nAs she leaves the bar, Raoul declares he is not afraid of the Phantom. As I am tired of typing the Phantom, I will refer to him by his real name (given in the original novel “The Phantom of the Opera”), Erik. Erik makes a bet with Raoul, saying that if Christine sings, Raoul was to leave immediately forever. And if she didn’t sing, Erik would wipe away all of Raoul’s debts and they would be free to leave.\n\nErik then reveals that Gustave is truly his son, though Raoul does his best to deny it."
