Only trouble is, this sequel, Love Never Dies, is only in theaters for one more night, Wednesday, March 7th.\n\nIf you are not familiar with NCM Fathom Events, you should look into it. Single-handedly, they are opening the minds of movie-goers across the country, informing us that our local movie theaters hold much more potential than simply watching movies. They host a a wide array of in-theater events, bringing famous stage plays to the movie screen, operas, concerts, and events of all kinds."
