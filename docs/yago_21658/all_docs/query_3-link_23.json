        "text": "Post by sukhavati on\n\nAs misguided as the original opening was, I would take it any day over BK's. The placement of TIHYS right at the start is stupid. This is an emotional song that the drama needs to build to. It also makes the song's prologue, which is far from one of ALW's finest moments, the first thing we hear. I've always disliked the sentimentality of this prologue, announcing the Phantom as a romantic and lonely figure right off the bat, lacking subtlety therefore, and then \"Ten long years...\" and \"lost and gone\" is a hopelessly weak transition into the song, an uncharacteristically lazy piece of writing from the composer. There isn't a single decision BK has made in musical theatre that is sound. I don't understand what ALW sees in him. A good director tasked with improving LND would have had the story unfold from Christine's perspective. The first time Christine sees the Phantom should be the first time the audience sees the Phantom as well. it's obvious that would work better dramatically.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the Australian/North American opening over the original UK version. The UK prologue implying that Giry was responsible for a fire that destroyed Phantasma - an event that isn't actually depicted anywhere in Act II - didn't particularly work for me, and it was a failed attempt at an Easter egg to conflate it with the film version of Phantom.\n\nMy personal take before seeing LND was that ALW had personally identified too closely with the Phantom role. He was the impetus behind the horrible novel that led to LND. I think in his mind he had to prove that the soprano would have chosen to remain with the Phantom if fate hadn't intervened just before the curtain. There was a certain Beauty and the Beast snark going around when he and Sarah Brightman first got together. I also felt it was a cynical money making ploy. TBH, how many of his shows since 1990 have shown nearly the same longevity or ubiquitousness? As an aside, killing Christine off worked with the POTO prologue, since Raoul mentions she's dead, plus it's a very 18th/19th century solution for novelists dealing with a female character transgressing societal norms, in this case, Christine deciding to leave her husband and stay with Erik. In novels, the transgressive females either suffered a crisis and repented, or died if they were unrepentant.

LND isn't that far off from Phantom in the sense that you need three really strong leads to raise the tone of the show above the melodrama of the book. Might not translate via film but when you're seeing a great cast live, it's a moving show. I think Oliver's preference for LND needing to be told from Christine's point of view is an interesting option; the challenge would indeed be reshaping the material. It might be problematic that the audience's first sight coinciding with Christine's first sighting could be seen as repetitive of the original musical. However, the thing we often forget is that POTO is told from old Raoul's memories of what Christine told him - so it's filtered through Raoul's POV from beginning to end. In this case, it's from Erik's POV, and he was the original title character.\n\nI suspect ALW will tinker some more with the book and score if the UK tour ever gets off the ground.

I'm curious to see what happens.\n\nAs I see it, nothing in LND works, and for this reason I don't quibble with plot intricacies such as Madame Giry being responsible for the fire. I don't care about the story or any of the characters in LND. I didn't like the original opening to LND either, my point is only that it worked better musically and structurally than the revised version. The placement of TIHYS at the start makes no sense to me. I agree with you that ALW likely identified too closely with the story to make a good sequel, and perhaps, as you suggest, with the Phantom himself. There is evidence which we see in his comments, e.g. \"love letter to Sarah\", \"closing a chapter\" and such, which frankly get on my nerves. Your theory about why LND ended the way it did is really interesting, I hadn't thought of that. I also agree that in a society that massively values looks over talent, the \"beauty and the beast\" idea of Phantom likely struck home with him. I'm sure he drew parallels in his own mind between Phantom and Christine and himself and Sara Brightman. Personally, I never thought she was beautiful, nor him ugly, but I've no doubt he saw it that way. However, your theory about LND being a cynical money making ploy on his part seems more problematic, since writing a sequel occurred to him as far back as 1990. Also, if personal feelings provided the impetus for LND, as you say, that would suggest the opposite is true."
