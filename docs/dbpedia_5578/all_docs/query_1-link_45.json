        "text": "ABOUT ME\n\nDear friends and “stovemates”, here I am. My name is Stefania Aphel Barzini. I’m a food writer, journalist, TV author, and home chef who has always been involved in the culinary world. I lived in Los Angeles for many years where I taught exclusive courses in Italian regional cuisine to American clients. Together with the Italian Cultural Institute, I organized events, dinners and special themed soirees. For example, I hosted a retrospective on Totò, the famous Neapolitan comedian known as “the prince of laughter” and widely considered one of the greatest Italian artists of the 20th century. For this event I prepared a Totò-themed dinner, but also discovered his relationship to food throughout all his filmography. I did the same thing with Mario Monicelli (one of the master directors of the Commedia all’Italiana) and his movies, and with many more.\n\nBack in Italy, I started a cooking school for foreigners, near Rome, at the Castello di Ceri, a gorgeous castle in the Etruscan countryside, and managed and ran a catering business. Then fate knocked on my door and I was called alongside a great group of food-lovers and experts, to start the famous satellite channel Gambero Rosso. The TV channel bred many children and many dishes: magazines collaborations, documentaries, Food Writing courses, Creative Writing classes, events, and a long list of books–– autobiographical essays, food-themed novels, biographies, and cookbooks. In short, my world revolves around food and cooking. It always has. My soul is inextricably linked to the stove.\n\nEnglish-language cooking courses include:\n\nCooking as Romans Do:\n\nRoman cuisine cooking lessons where we’ll cook and taste traditional Roman food: gnocchi alla romana, bucatini alla matriciana, carbonara, gricia, cacio e pepe, carciofi alla romana e alla giudia (Roman-style or Jewish-style fried artichokes), roasted lamb scottadito, saltimbocca alla romana (veal cutlets that are cooked so quickly they seem to “jump in your mouth”), torta di ricotta (ricotta cake), and much more.\n\nPRICE: 80 EUROS – Meal and wine included.\n\nPasta World:\n\nCooking lessons where we’ll be playing with dough, making and tasting ravioli from scratch, cooking tortellini, fettuccine, and lasagne prepared in many different ways.
