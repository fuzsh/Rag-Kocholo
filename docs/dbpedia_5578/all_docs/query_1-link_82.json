        "text": "May 16, 2013\n\nAMPERSAND: FINEST HOUR 140, AUTUMN 2009\n\nBY RICHARD M. LANGWORTH, EDITOR\n\n==================\n\nBill Buckley said: “Expressions of gratitude can be most awfully trying to the ear of an audience, generally captive. But the act of gratitude nowadays is probably more often neglected than overdone.” Finest Hour has been, not the work of one but of many over the years, who contributed time, talent and skill as writers, artists or thinkers to the product it became. On its fortieth anniversary it is appropriate to mention all who come to mind, knowing I will forget to mention others.\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry reflected in Wind, Sand, and Stars: “Life may scatter us and keep us apart; it may prevent us from thinking very often of one another, but we know that our comrades are somewhere ‘out there’—where, one can hardly say.” Well, here they are, out there…\n\nA gone shipmate, Conrad wrote, is gone forever, and many are gone forever from Finest Hour, or this world. “But at times the spring-flood of memory sets with force up the dark River of the Nine Bends. Then on the waters of the forlorn stream drifts a ship—manned by a crew of Shades. They pass and make a sign, in a shadowy hail. Haven’t we, together and upon the immortal sea, wrung out a meaning from our sinful lives?….You were a good crowd. As good a crowd as ever fisted with wild cries the beating canvas of a heavy foresail; or tossing aloft, invisible in the night, gave back yell for yell to a westerly gale.”"
