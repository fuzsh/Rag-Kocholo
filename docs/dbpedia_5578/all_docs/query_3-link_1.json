        "text": "\"So you're the fat man.\"\n\n\"Walk away now, my men'll let you live.\"\n\n―Aldo Trapani and Luciano Fabbri[src]\n\nLuciano \"The Fat Man\" Fabbri was the Cuneo family's consigliere who was often known as 'the Fat Man' due to both his girth and status in the family.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHe was known to have a wide knowledge of inter-family squabbles. This would prove that he was one of the most cunning consiglieres in the five families.\n\nHowever, one morning, Fabbri made a stop at a hot-dog vendor whilst on his way to a meeting with Don Cuneo. At this point, Aldo Trapani, executed Fabbri and his guards after taunting the consigliere. This hit was sanctioned by caporegime Peter Clemenza, who was known to have a hatred of Fabbri and his methods.\n\nHis demise soon became known to the Cuneo family, who, instead of calling off the attack, pressed it forwards and killed several Corleone soldiers.\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nA master planner, and a \"man with a belly\" in the Old Sicilian tradition, Fabbri was a true Cuneo, vicious when crossed but otherwise a peaceful figure. When threatened by Aldo Trapani, he offered him a chance to walk away, though he was probably bluffing.\n\nPlayers (Peter Clemenza Hit 4):[]\n\nLuciano Fabbri - Luciano \"The Fat Man\" has a wide girth, and a larger understanding of the inter-family squabbling. He's readying to wage war against the Corleones, who he believes will overrun his family. He's correct in his assumption of course, which is why the hit was ordered.\n\nHit Detail[]\n\nAs the Consigliere of the Cuneo family and chronologically one of the last two hit targets, Fabbri was no doubt a very strong, if not the toughest enemy you'll face in the game. He had a bodyguard army that consisted of only Caporegimes and Underbosses who are tougher than Emilio Barzini, Jr.'s guards while Fabbri is capable of self defense as well. What's more, taunting him for the bonus is not wise while his men are still alive. Take them down first, shoot his leg before you approach to taunt him and finally execute him to finish the job without any outstanding danger.\n\nTrivia[]"
