        "text": "Peking to Paris: A Journey Across Two Continents in 1907 by Luigi Barzini soon to be presented for sale on the outstanding BookLovers of Bath web site!\n\nPublished: London: Alcove Press Limited, 1972, Hardback in dust wrapper.\n\nTranslation originally published as Pekin to Paris, London: Grant Richards 1907, a translation of La Meta del Mondo vista d’un Automobile. Contains: Black & white photographs; Maps to the endpapers and blanks;\n\nFrom the cover: Peking to Paris is the unforgettable account of the triumphant automobile race of 1907. This historic and enthralling book involves two Barzinis Luigi Sr., the famed editor of the Corriere della Sera, who rode across China, Siberia, and Russia in the horseless carriage of Prince Borghese to win what has been called the maddest motor race of all time and Luigi Jr., his brilliant son, author of The Italians and From Caesar to the Mafia, who discovered new material and photographs and now introduces this classic text of an almost unbelievable adventure. The illustrations alone (photographs taken at the time by the author) reconstruct a fabulous lost world of Chinese mandarins, Siberian waste-lands, Czarist aristocrats and peasants, and mad-cap motorists who attained unheard-of speeds of 60 m.p.h. across the Gobi Desert and along new tracks of the Trans-Continental Railway. The text is, if anything, even more vivid. The story of the greatest 100 days in automobile history is not only exciting, full of the exotica of those far-away times and places, it is a document which, quite beyond the merits of charm, wit and suspense, claims serious attention. Profound changes have convulsed the world from Peking to Paris. Peking to Paris is a great book which graphically reminds us of all our yesterdays.\n\nIntroduction by: Luigi Barzini\n\nVery Good in Good Dust Wrapper. A little rubbing to the edges of the dust wrapper, nicked at the corners. Text complete, clean and tight.\n\nBlue boards with Gilt titling to the Spine. [XXIV] 308 pages. 9¾” x 6¾”."
