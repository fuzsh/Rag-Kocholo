        "text": "CREMA, Italy — The mother of a childhood friend of mine, now in her 90s, still lives in our small hometown, Crema, near Milan. A few months ago, she started to tell us about a young, charming American actor named Tim who would pick her up in the mornings to have coffee in the piazza.\n\nMy friend was worried and a little embarrassed. “My mother has a vivid imagination,” he told us. She resented that. “I’m not making things up!” she snapped.\n\nShe was right. Tim turned out to be Timothée Chalamet, the 22-year-old star of “Call Me by Your Name” and an Oscar nominee for best actor. The movie has been nominated in three other categories, too, including best picture.\n\nAnd it was filmed in and around Crema, where its director, Luca Guadagnino — originally from Palermo, Sicily — came to live a few years ago. The cast and crew set up camp here and stayed for some time. Mr. Chalamet rented an apartment in the building where my friend’s mother lived, and they all took delight that her name, Mafalda, now resounds across the movie; Mr. Guadagnino kept a character by that name — a hard-working housemaid — from the book that inspired the film. To be honest, I don’t think my friend’s mom will watch this coming-of-age gay romance. But she feels vindicated.\n\n“Call Me by Your Name,” adapted for the screen by James Ivory from a 2007 novel by André Aciman, is set in the summer of 1983. Young Elio — played by the New-York-born Mr. Chalamet — is visiting his upper-class, academic parents (Michael Stuhlbarg and Amira Casar) in the northern Italian countryside. His dad, an archaeologist, invites an American graduate student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) to work with him for a few weeks. Elio is at first unimpressed by their guest. But soon enough he finds Oliver attractive, and things start to happen.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
