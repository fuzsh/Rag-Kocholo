        "text": "We look forward to it all year. Your kids can’t wait to be free from school and you can’t wait to sip a cool drink by the pool.\n\nBut, the sun is a powerful entity. While it is clinically proven to lift your mood and regulate your circadian rhythm, the sun is chiefly responsible for one-in-five Americans developing skin cancer by the time they are 70 — and just five sunburns can double your chances of melanoma.\n\nSo, what can we do to continue enjoying the warmth of summer, while also remaining protected? First, let’s break down the forms of skin cancer most caused by sun overexposure.\n\nMelanoma: The most dangerous of skin cancers, it can present itself anywhere on the body. If you are seeing large brown spots with dark speckles, moles that change in color, size or feel, moles with irregular borders and portions that appear black or blue, itching and burning or dark spots on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, you should seek out a medical professional.\n\nBasal-cell carcinoma: The most common type of skin cancer, usually found on areas of the body most exposed to the sun. This form typically grows slowly and rarely spreads (metastasizes). However, if left untreated, it can invade nearby tissues and cause disfigurement. It often appears as a flesh-colored, scar-like or pearl-like bump and is often shiny or waxy. The edges of the lesion are typically smooth and may have a rolled border. It bleeds easily when scratched.\n\nSquamous-cell carcinoma: This form presents slightly differently from melanoma and basal-cell carcinoma. Squamous-cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas as a firm, red nodule or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface.\n\nMerkel-cell carcinoma: This type presents as a painless, firm bump or nodule on the skin that grows fast as a red, scaly or ulcerated area on the skin and/or a new mole that changes in size, color or shape.\n\nSebaceous gland carcinoma: This is a very rare but aggressive form of skin cancer that begins in the body’s oil-producing, sebaceous gland. It can often be mistaken for pink eye, as it usually starts on the eyelid, and can cause growths to ooze fluid. The cancer can also develop in hairy areas of the body due to the fact that sebum is released by the hair follicle.\n\nLuckily, there are many ways to avoid the risks of the beating sun. Here are some tips to stay safe this year. According to Harvard Health Publishing, at Harvard Medical School:\n\n1. Always wear sunscreen, applying it at least every two hours but do not rely on it alone. Seek shade often and whenever available. SPF 30 and up is recommended, with SPF 30 protecting against 97% of ultraviolet B rays.\n\n2. Wear sun-protective clothing, preferably made of polyester, nylon, wool and silk, to block the UV rays.\n\n3. Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when the sun’s rays are the strongest.\n\n4. Be aware that some medicines and skin care products can increase your skin’s risk of UV damage. These include certain antibiotics, as well as some prescription medicines that are used to treat mental health disorders, high blood pressure, heart failure, acne and allergies. If you are taking prescription medication, and you normally spend a great deal of time outdoors, ask your health care professional whether you should take any special precautions to avoid sun exposure.\n\n5. Early detection is key, with survival rates up to 99%, when caught. If something seems abnormal, have it checked ASAP.\n\nNow that you are armed with all this information, get out in the sun and have a safe but great summer.\n\nBy John Broven\n\nThe 2024 International Cricket Council Men’s T20 World Cup final, held June 29 in Barbados, featured India and South Africa. Both teams had starred locally June 3-12 in Eisenhower Park at a temporary modular facility, grandly named Nassau County International Cricket Stadium.\n\nThe site was chosen after NIMBY opposition ruled out first-choice Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. Credit should go to Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman (R) for spotting the opportunities for the local economy and tourism.\n\nThe eight games were blessed with almost perfect sunny cricket weather. There was a short rain delay for the key India vs. Pakistan game, which India won and effectively knocked out their intense rival from the tournament. Crowds swarmed to see their Indian and Pakistani heroes from back home. Every one of the 34,000 seats was sold within minutes of the ticket office opening, resulting in a scalpers paradise. The attendance was only slightly less for USA’s honorable defeat by ultimate tournament winners India on the concluding Wednesday. All told, more than 150,000 fans saw the Nassau stadium games.\n\nOverlooked features of the competition included USA, a non-cricketing nation, making it to the Super Eight stage and war-torn Afghanistan progressing to the semifinals stage.\n\nT20 cricket at Eisenhower Park\n\nSo, how was my experience of international cricket on Long Island? Quite simply, it was wonderful. It was a joy to see top-class cricket again after many years living over here. Even with the rapid-fire T20 format, with matches hardly lasting four hours, the serenity, charm and strategy of the game came shining through. Somehow the introduction of loud recorded music was only a minor distraction.\n\nThe batting, bowling and fielding were all spellbinding on what was acknowledged to be a “slow” wicket, where the ball didn’t come quickly onto the bat. As is often said in cricket terminology, the state of the wicket was the same for both teams.\n\nWith friend Richard Tapp, who traveled all the way from England for the tournament, I had tickets for the games on Friday, June 7 (Ireland vs. Canada) and the Saturday (South Africa vs. The Netherlands). Both matches swung back and forth, with Canada edging the first game and the Netherlands almost pulling off a shock defeat after South Africa had lost their top four batsmen cheaply.\n\nMeet-and-greet at Westbury LIRR station\n\nThe pleasurable experience started as soon as we disembarked June 7 at Westbury station from Stony Brook. A kind gentleman on the platform led us to the shuttle bus area where we were greeted cheerily by LIRR and NICE bus officials. If there were any fears of being stuck in traffic to Eisenhower Park, they were soon dissipated when we realized that the main arteries, Post and Merrick avenues, were dedicated to bus traffic. A lady driver said that the journey would be 8 1/2 minutes — and so it was.\n\nThe spirit of the event was captured by bus passengers discussing their presence with others. There was an Indian national who failed to get tickets for the “big game,” but was attending because he wanted to experience live international cricket in the United States. He said he was a fast bowler from New Jersey and played in a cricket league on Long Island with matted pitches (as opposed to grass). A French lady, who lives now in Nassau, said she wanted to experience the occasion even though cricket is as foreign in France as it is in the United States.\n\nAfter leaving the shuttle bus, we approached the ticket and check-in areas. There were nervous moments as tickets were available only electronically and then on the day of the match. Luckily, the combination of ICC’s ticketing agency and Apple’s iPhone did the job. We had taken the precaution to acquire see-through bags for check-in, but that didn’t save from the trashcan a tasty deli sandwich or a bug spray, which proved to be unnecessary anyway.\n\nImpressive stadium\n\nAs we walked the perimeter of the vast modular stadium it was hard to believe that it had been constructed from nothing since January. This included the cricket outfield grown from Kentucky bluegrass in New Jersey and the pitches, which were prepared in Florida based on guidance from the famous Adelaide Oval in Australia.\n\nWe were handed big red placards marked “6” — the equivalent of a baseball homerun — and “4,” which were waved vigorously whenever a boundary was struck, adding to the party-like atmosphere.\n\nOur seats in the East Grandstand were perfect for watching the games although there was quite a lot of stair climbing, which was quite hard on the elderly. There was no shortage of bar, food and soft drinks facilities with merch stalls, ice cream vans and, importantly, restrooms and first-aid.\n\nThe Friday crowd was on the small side at just over 5,000 people. Although cricket is not a major game in Ireland or Canada, I had expected a larger contingent of Irish and Canadians. Saturday was much fuller, thanks to many enthusiastic South African supporters regaled in green and gold. There were quite a few Netherlands fans, too, dressed in familiar bright orange. The visible security force quietly kept order throughout. Indeed, good humor pervaded at all times among the attendees reflecting the uniqueness of the event.\n\nA touching moment before each game was the competitors’ two huge national flags being unfurled across half the ground by local schoolchildren dressed smartly in white.\n\nThere was a strong local connection with T20 USA venue development director, Don Lockerbie, being the son of Bruce Lockerbie, former dean of faculty at The Stony Brook School.\n\nThe future of U.S. cricket\n\nCricket is seemingly destined to be a minnow sport in the U.S., but there’s no doubt that the Long Island T20 series did the game proud — more so than the matches held in Dallas and a weather-hit Florida. As expected, the coverage by the national media was spotty, but credit to the New York Times, News12 and Newsday for their reporting. I think the New Yorker’s doubting headline “If you build it (a cricket stadium on Long Island) will they come?” was well-answered in the affirmative.\n\nEnglish-born John Broven, of East Setauket, is an award-winning American music history author and a copyeditor with TBR News Media. This article is a follow-up to “International cricket coming to Long Island” (Feb. 29).\n\nBy Katherine Kelton\n\nThe Conscience Bay Quaker Meeting House in St. James has been convening since 1961. This meeting house in St. James has started its own Earth Care Committee and its first goal is incredibly close to home for the Quakers.\n\nOn the meeting house’s grounds, two former horse paddocks were mowed and maintained as a lawn. The Earth Care Committee plans to convert the lawn into a meadow through a process of rewilding. An expert at Cornell Cooperative Extension informed the committee of a problematic barrier of invasive species around the paddocks, further complicating their goal of having a self-propagating native meadow.\n\nBarbara Ransome, the clerk of grounds at the meeting house, works with the Earth Care Committee for which Amy G. is the clerk. They spoke with TBR about the process.\n\n“In this first phase of removing these invasive plants, we needed contractors and equipment. Which was funded by our own meeting house. For the planting materials we got a small grant from the New York Yearly Meeting,” Ransome said.\n\nThe Yearly Meeting is a gathering of state Quaker congregations. The Conscience Bay Quakers applied for an Earth-care grant from the Yearly Meeting with an “inclusive application,” as Ransome described it. The group received $500, the largest grant allowed to be given as a result of their application.\n\nThe grant money covered some of the cost of the native species, although Amy G. admitted that securing enough plants to cover such a large area is “quite expensive.” Consequently, the newly-cleared area will be replanted in stages with the work ongoing as funds, plants and volunteers are sourced.\n\nThe pair enlisted the help of local native plant grower, Mindy Block, who owns Quality Parks in Port Jefferson. Block works to provide native plants to locals and is working to cultivate more species. She provided the group with milkweed and native grasses, along with a variety of other plants that it hopes will begin to self-propagate and spread to create a native habitat.\n\nAmy G. explained that one of the beliefs of Quakerism is respecting the Earth’s ecological integrity and being “good stewards of the environment.” She shared that an attendee of the society inspired these efforts when he mentioned how burning fossil fuels to mow the horse paddocks was not aligned with the values of the Quakers.\n\nRansome said, “In unity, the Quaker meeting house decided to go forward with an Earth Care Committee not to mow the paddocks.” From there the committee decided to take on a plan for rewilding the grounds, which refers to allowing native plants to take over the area and self-propagate. However, the process has not been an easy transition.\n\nThe committee wanted to ensure the meadow could thrive independently as part of its plan to take a combination active-passive approach. In the beginning stages, the committee will take an active approach to planting native species and clearing the border of invasive plants around the paddocks.\n\nThe end goal would be to allow habitat to develop where creatures can live and be undisturbed by machines and people. Ransome provided an example of a tree falling, where she believed it is beneficial to allow it to stay because it can become a home to small animals.\n\n“Our first step in outreach was the Girl Scout troop, who we invited to help plant the native grasses and plants,” Amy G. said. The committee hopes to invite them back each year to continue to learn about plants and invest in a long-term community project. The committee also hopes to involve other groups and anyone who wants to get involved.\n\nThe St. James attendees and members meet weekly in person or via Zoom for worship. Quakerism is also known as the Religious Society of Friends. Ransome wants people to know that “there is a concern for climate change — this is one way the Quakers are dedicated to being good stewards of the Earth.”\n\nThose interested in joining the Earth Care Committee do not have to be practicing Quakers, nor do they have to fill out any formal application. Ransome urges those interested to contact her via email at: [email protected].\n\nBy Daniel Dunaief\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration last week approved donanemab, or Kisunla, an intravenous treatment for early stage Alzheimer’s disease, adding a second medication for mild stages of a disease that robs people of memory and cognitive function.\n\nThe monoclonal antibody drug from Eli Lilly joins Leqembi from drug makers Eisai and Biogen as ways to reduce the characteristic amyloid plaques that are often used to diagnose Alzheimer’s.\n\nWhile the medications offer ways to slow but do not stop or reverse Alzheimer’s and come with potential significant side effects, doctors welcomed the treatment options for patients who are at risk of cognitive decline.\n\nDr. Nikhil Palekar, Medical Director of the Stony Brook Center of Excellence for Alzheimer’s Disease and Director of the Stony Brook Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Trials Program, has been in the field for about two decades.\n\n“Only in the last three years have I finally become quite optimistic” about new treatments, said Palekar, who is a consultant for Eisai. “We’ve had so many failures in the last few decades” with the current medications targeting the core pathologies.\n\nThat optimism comes at a time when more people in the United States and around the world are likely to deal with diseases that affect the elderly, as the number of people in the United States who are 85 and older is expected to double in the next 10 years.\n\nThe rates of Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia is about 13 percent for people between 75 and 84 and is 33 percent for people over 85 according to the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association issued a statement welcoming the addition of Kisunla to the medical arsenal.\n\n“This is real progress,” Joanne Pike, Alzheimer’s Association president and CEO, said in a statement. The approval “allows people more options and greater opportunity to have more time.”\n\nTo be sure, Leqembi, which was approved in June of 2023 and Kisunla aren’t a guarantee for improvement and come with some potentially significant side effects.\n\nSome patients had a risk of developing so-called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, which includes brain edema, or ARIA-E or hemorrhaging, or ARIA-H in the brain.\n\nARIA can resolve on its own, but can, in rare cases, become severe and life-threatening.\n\nPatients taking these medications receive regular monitoring, including MRI’s before various additional treatments.\n\nPatients are “monitored carefully” before infusions to “go over symptom checklists to make sure they don’t have neurological symptoms,” said Palekar. “If they have any symptoms, the next step is to head to the closest emergency room to get an MRI of the brain, which is the only way to know if a side effect is causing symptoms.”\n\nNonetheless, under medical supervision, patients who took the medication as a part of clinical trials showed a progressive reduction in amyloid plaques up to 84 percent at 18 months compared to their baseline.\n\nThe benefits for Leqembi, which is given every two weeks, and Kisunla, which is administered every four weeks, were similar in terms of slowing the effect of cognitive decline, said Dr. Marc Gordon, Chief of Neurology at Zucker Hillside Hospital in Glen Oaks.\n\n“Neither of them is a cure for Alzheimer’s,” said Gordon. “These medications are not a home run, but at least we’re on base.”\n\nNot eligible\n\nNot everyone is eligible to take these monoclonal antibody treatments.\n\nThese drugs are not available for people who have progressed beyond the mild stage of the disease. Clinicians advised those who are showing potential signs of Alzheimer’s to visit their doctors before the disease progresses beyond the point where these drugs might help.\n\nAdditionally, people on blood thinners, such as Eliquis, Coumadin, and Warfarin, can not take these drugs because a micro bleed could become a larger hemorrhage.\n\nPeople who have an active malignant cancer also can’t take these drugs, nor can anyone who has had a reaction to these treatments in the past. The people who might likely know of an allergic reaction to these drugs are those who participated in clinical trials.\n\nDoctors monitor their patients carefully when they administer new drugs and have epinephrine on hand in case of an allergic reaction.\n\nPatients with two alleles – meaning from both parents – of a variant called APOE ε4 have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious and severe AIRA, compared to those with one allele or non-carriers.\n\nIf patients have this variant on both alleles, which occurs in about 15 percent of Alzheimer’s patients, Gordon and Palekar both counsel patients not to take the drug.\n\n“We don’t think the risk is acceptable” for this patient population, Gordon said.\n\nUltimately, Palekar believes patients, their doctors and their families need to make informed calculations about the risks and benefits of any treatment, including for Alzheimer’s.\n\nBeyond drugs\n\nPalekar added that recent studies have also shown that an increase in physical exercise and activity, such as aerobic activity three times a week for 45 minutes each time, can “significantly help in patients with cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease,” he said.\n\nAfter consulting with a physician to ensure that such activity is safe, patients can use a stationary bike or take walks which can benefit their bodies and their brains.\n\nAdditionally, various diets, such as the mind diet that combines the mediterranean diet and the DASH diet, which emphasize eating green leafy vegetables and berries among other things, can benefit the brain as well.\n\nPatients also improve their cognitive health by continuing mental activity through games as well as by retaining social connections to friends, family and members of the community.\n\nLike many other people, Palekar witnessed the ravages of Alzheimer’s first hand. As a teenager, he saw his aunt, who was smart, caring and loving, stare out the window without being able to communicate and engage in conversation as she battled the disease.\n\nAs a condition involving amyloid plaques, tau proteins, and inflammation, Alzheimer’s disease may require a combination of treatments that address the range of causes.\n\n“There’s going to be a combined therapy,” said Gordon. “Just like when we’re treating cancer, we don’t have just one drug. It’s going to be important to figure out the sequencing and whether drugs are given sequentially or cumulatively. It has to be a multi-faceted approach.”\n\n1 of 7\n\nBy Melissa Arnold\n\nIf you think back to your childhood, it’s likely you can recall moments when you were captivated by something external, like animal shapes in the clouds, or internal, like a daydream. You probably played dress-up, or with dolls or LEGOs, or fell in love with Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Disney movies.\n\nThere’s an almost universal tug we share toward things outside of the ordinary — we are drawn to dreams, fantasies, and sometimes other worlds.\n\nAllison Cruz, executive director of the Smithtown Township Arts Council and Mills Pond Gallery in St. James, has invited artists from around the country to explore their inner worlds with a new exhibit called Imagination.\n\nIt’s a little different than the gallery’s usual showings, but Cruz is excited to expose visitors to artistic expressions that might be unfamiliar.\n\n“I’ve had this idea for a long time. I’m personally a fan of realism, but over time I’ve really started to appreciate imaginative realism — art about things that don’t yet exist, or might exist in the far future … fantasy, science fiction, absurd humor, escapism,” said Cruz. “It seems like there’s been a greater interest in those subjects among artists as well, so it feels like the right moment to do this. A lot of the artists have thanked me for giving them an opportunity to explore a different side of themselves. I think people will be pleasantly surprised by what they see.”\n\nThe exhibit includes the work of 62 artists and a total of 81 selected submissions in a variety of styles and mediums. Their art combines personal narrative, pop culture characters and more to speak about the stories that fill our times. Taken together, the exhibit reveals the inner workings of the artists’ minds, from the complex to the humorous and even outlandish.\n\nManhattan native David H. Reuss is serving as juror for Imagination. Reuss has a long history with the Mills Pond Gallery — he studied there years ago under Marvel Comics illustrator John Buscema, and later connected with Cruz through art collector Tim Newton of the renowned Salmagundi Club.\n\nWith a background in both fine art and illustration, Cruz thought Reuss was the perfect fit for the exhibit’s themes.\n\n“David is on the board of the Society of Illustrators but also teaches realism painting, so he straddles both worlds. He loves the gallery and has the background that was needed to appreciate imaginative work. He really personifies what we were hoping to accomplish,” she said.\n\nReuss reviewed nearly 300 submissions during the selection process, considering how well each one fit the theme and how his selections would work together on display. He said he was “extremely impressed with the high-level talent” of the chosen artists, adding that their art could easily appear in any major city.\n\n“I’ve done a lot of surreal and fantastical work, and some of the submissions even leaned into illustration, so I was excited to get involved,” he said. “Everything that comes from an artist’s mind is imaginative, but this exhibit pushes those definitions a bit more — mythological concepts, abstracts, fantastical elements — to explore more of what imagination means to others.”\n\nKeep your eyes open for the little details as you appreciate the exhibit. A painting of a cityscape could be hiding a fairy friend. An abstract design might reveal a face. An animal could change its appearance if you look long enough. What will your imagination reveal to you?\n\n“People might not understand or like everything they see here, but art is just another way to learn about new concepts and ideas.

The AET is doing cutting-edge research on future hydrogen technologies and other projects that create businesses on Long Island. We were welcomed by David Hamilton and Kathleen Ferrell.\n\nThe connections with Stony Brook University departments, New York technology leaders, researchers and public agencies that were made in this short visit were quite extraordinary and many appointments were made for future discussions.\n\nThe mayor knew Hamilton and Ferrell professionally. Our visit was designed to dovetail with the efforts of the Port Jefferson Power Plant Working Group that Ugrinsky chairs. The PWG is exploring the potential for repowering our base load plants using hydrogen fuel and we will be exploring this possibility with Haiyan Sun when she is scheduled to tour our plant on a trip from Albany July 10.\n\nSun heads NYSERDA’s (the state’s Energy Research & Development Authority) hydrogen and renewables division and is responsible for evaluating grants and New York State priorities for this fast-evolving future technology. I am proud to be a part of this village’s forward-thinking and well-connected leadership. Port Jefferson is fortunate to be able to have people with these kinds of professional experience and networks working for its residents.\n\nBruce Miller\n\nPort Jefferson\n\nComsewogue Community Garden is a special place\n\nMy name is Danny, and I am a Life Scout working on the Communication merit badge. I recently started work on my Eagle Scout project at the Comsewogue Community Garden on Terryville Road in Port Jefferson Station. I am replacing the current garden shed with a new one.\n\nI am writing because I would like to share how impressed I am with the garden and the amount of work that volunteers have put into making the garden so beautiful and welcoming. This includes growing fresh vegetables and a pollinator garden. More recently a Girl Scout troop started a sensory garden.\n\nThis is a special place in the community and I think more people should know about it. I am hoping that students can take field trips to visit the garden and community members can take advantage of this beautiful space.\n\nDaniel Cappiello\n\nTroop 354 Port Jefferson Station\n\nHappy 60th birthday to public transportation on Long Island\n\nThis July marks the 60th anniversary of federal government support for public transportation. The success of public transportation can be traced back to one of the late President Lyndon Johnson’s (D) greatest accomplishments which continues benefiting many Americans today. On July 9, 1964, he signed the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964 into law. Subsequently this has resulted in the investment over time of billions of dollars into public transportation.\n\nMillions of Americans today on a daily basis utilize various public transportation alternatives. They include local and express bus, ferry, jitney, light rail, subway and commuter rail services. All of these systems use less fuel and move far more people than conventional single occupancy vehicles. Most of these systems are funded with your tax dollars thanks to Johnson.\n\nDepending upon where you live, consider the public transportation alternative. Try riding a local or express bus, para transit or commuter van, ferry, light rail, commuter rail or subway.\n\nThere is MTA LIRR, NYC Transit bus and subway, Suffolk County Transit Bus, Huntington Area Rapid Transit (HART) Bus and Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE) Bus.\n\nBy using MTA Metro or OMNY cards, there are free transfers between the subway and bus. This has eliminated the old two-fare zones making public transportation an even better bargain. Purchasing a monthly LIRR or MTA subway/bus pass reduces the cost per ride and provides virtually unlimited trips. In many cases, employers can offer transit checks which help subsidize a portion of the costs. Utilize this and reap the benefits. It supports a cleaner environment.\n\nMany employers now allow employees to telecommute and work from home. Others use alternative work schedules which afford staff the ability to avoid rush-hour gridlock. This saves travel time and can improve mileage per gallon. Join a car or van pool to share the costs of commuting.\n\nThe ability to travel from home to workplace, school, shopping, entertainment, medical, library, etc., is a factor when moving to a new neighborhood. Economically successful communities are not 100% dependent on automobiles as the sole means of mobility. Seniors, students, low and middle income people need these transportation alternatives. Investment in public transportation today contributes to economic growth, employment and a stronger economy. Dollar for dollar, it is one of the best investments we can make.\n\nWhat better way to honor the late President Johnson and all that has been achieved these past 60 years in public transportation by continuing funding the federal Highway Trust Fund and Mass Transit Account.\n\nLarry Penner\n\nGreat Neck\n\nBy Daniel Dunaief\n\nIf sweat were a valuable commodity, I’d be in high demand.\n\nAs it is, however, my thick, heavy high-volume sweat is as welcome as a cup of warm water on a hot, sticky day.\n\nWhen I was a teenager and attended basketball camp, I used to sit in the back seat with two other campers, squeezing my thick thighs together as much as possible to avoid sharing the sweat that coated my legs.\n\nI had and continue to have the kind of sweat glands that would give marathoners from Ethiopia a run for their money.\n\nNo, I can’t run as far or as fast as a marathon runner, but I still sometimes looked like one, especially on those summer days when I walked a few miles to work and arrived in a puddle-stained suit.\n\nFortunately, the public, even before the notion of “fake news” became trendy, rarely had high expectations for the attire of a reporter.\n\nWhen the temperature and humidity are high enough, I can picture the various characters from the Disney/Pixar movie “Inside Out” pushing and shoving as they try to climb into a small raft in a sweat-drenched control room.\n\nThe process almost always starts on my upper lip. That’s where beady sweat scouts come out, checking to see if it is indeed worth alerting the rest of my body that it’s a good time to join the fun.\n\nWithin seconds, my arms and wrists have the almost modest effect of glistening, as a thin layer of perspiration can catch the sun at just the right angle, giving my skin a mildly reflective look. After a few short moments, the production line kicks into higher gear. My fingers, which often swell when I walk more than a mile or so, become drenched.\n\nI have had a few occasions when I’ve run into people who introduce me to others in this condition. When they stick out their hands to shake mine, I’m stuck.\n\nWhile holding my hand back is disrespectful, soaking someone I’ve met with a soggy handshake makes the wrong kind of first impression.\n\nMy sister-in-law carries a collection of mostly healthy snacks in her purse for when my typically charming and delightful brother enters the hangry stage of the day and needs food to carry him to the next meal.\n\nI don’t often become frustrated or angry when I’m hungry. I do, however, become embarrassed when I can feel the thick, heavy drops of sweat racing down my back, slaloming down my legs and collecting in my shoes.\n\nMaybe I should suggest to my wife that she carry wipes, paper towels, an electric fan, or a magical towel that comes out of a tiny purse but can absorb a full day’s worth of sweat. I bet Mary Poppins could pull that off.\n\nSince I’m not always with my wife and this isn’t her problem, I rub my hands against my legs. That kind of works, although that then leaves a soaked hand print on the outside of my pant leg which is usually met by the layer of moisture accumulating on the inside of my pants.\n\nNow, dry fit shirts have become a true gift for me, as they don’t immediately become drenched with perspiration. Maybe some day someone will invent a dry fit suit, which looks like normal business attire, but doesn’t become a magnet for moisture.\n\nI know astronauts drink a purified form of urine, the moisture they exhale and their own sweat. When I interviewed Astronaut Scott Kelly several years ago, he mentioned that he particularly enjoyed the taste of the purified water aboard the International Space Station, where he lived for 340 straight days.\n\nI suppose that means I’d be a valuable commodity as an older, slower moving astronaut, assuming that I didn’t need to drink every ounce and then some, of what I produced when I sweat.\n\nOh well, that probably won’t work and I’m not that eager to travel into space. In the spirit of reduce, reuse, recycle, maybe I should figure out how to turn my own sweat into an icy cold drink.\n\nBy Leah S. Dunaief\n\nAging has become a frequent subject in the media, perhaps propelled there by our presidential race and its elderly candidates. We are all, of course, aging, and we all want to age well. This plethora of information gives us a chance to measure our health against standard values for our age. The statistics are also comforting: we are not alone with our symptoms and infirmities. We want to be equal or better than predicted for our age.\n\nBut are we?\n\nI accepted a delivery from the messenger at my front door and reached for my wallet to pay him the charge. But herein lies the story.\n\nYears ago, I gave up carrying a pocketbook because I was getting lame from carrying everything in there but the proverbial kitchen sink. My doctor, whom I had visited with complaints of an aching shoulder, and who noticed my dead weight tote, pointed out that most men don’t carry pocketbooks and they seem to do fine. Men, after all, keep everything they need for daily living in their pockets.\n\nHe advised me to do the same.\n\nHe was right. I observed men carefully at checkout lines in supermarkets and in restaurants. They settled the bills with whatever they withdrew from their pockets and went merrily on their way. They carried their door keys in their pockets, and some even took out a comb occasionally to run through their hair. I reasoned that I could do that, too, with my lipstick. The doctor changed my life that day. And my shoulder never again bothered me.\n\nSince then, I have bought clothes with pockets and used them instead of a pocketbook for my routine needs unless I am wearing a gown or a bathing suit. So I was wearing shorts that day, when I paid the driver, then replaced my wallet in my pocket.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nLater, when I was getting ready to go to my annual dentist appointment, I reached into my pocket to check for my wallet and panicked. It wasn’t there. I could feel the coarse material at the bottom. The pocket was empty.\n\nWhat had I done with my wallet after I paid for the package? I pivoted to look next to the still unopened box on the front hall table. Nothing. Thinking I absent-mindedly carried the wallet into the living room and put it down next to my reading chair, I entered and found only the day’s newspaper there. Concern mounting, I quickly walked around to the kitchen and scanned the empty counters.\n\nNow I was beginning to panic. If I didn’t find my wallet quickly, I was going to be late for my appointment. It came to me in a flash. I must have brought the wallet to my bedroom. I rushed up the stairs and into the room, searching the bedside table, the thickly padded bedroom chair, the ottoman and even the bathroom. No luck.\n\nThen I ran downstairs and repeated all those steps, hoping I had missed something the first time around. Still nothing. Wait. Had I looked in my closet, where I had earlier pulled out my sandals? Taking flight, I charged back up the stairs and into the walk-in closet. No sight of the stupid wallet.\n\nOverheated and gasping for air, I realized I was going to miss the dentist. I sat down in my bedroom chair, dialed his number and got his receptionist. Breathlessly I explained my predicament and that I would call for another time. She was sympathetic and told me how often that happens to her with her car keys. I wasn’t mollified. I had everything in my wallet: driver’s license, insurance card, credit cards, money.\n\nI hung up and leaned back into the chair, only to feel a lump against my lower back. What had I left in the chair? Nothing, but there was something in the back pocket of my shorts.\n\nThere it was. I had forgotten I had back pockets in these shorts. My wallet was running around the house with me the entire time. Duh!"
