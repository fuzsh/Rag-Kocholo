In an exclusive interview with CBS2 and KCAL9 reporter Kristine Leahy, Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard had some unkind words for his former Orlando Magic teammates.

"My team in Orlando was a team full of people that nobody wanted," Howard said, "and I was their leader."

Howard played alongside many players--most notably Jameer Nelson, J.J. Redick, and Hedo Türkoğlu--in his Magic tenure, during which he became the franchise's all-time leading scorer, rebounder, and shot-blocker. Howard's preference for players such as Glen Davis and Gilbert Arenas is rumored to have influenced the Magic's decision to acquire them.

Before Orlando dealt Redick to the Milwaukee Bucks at the trading deadline, Redick had, on at least one occasion, refused to mention Howard by name, instead referring to the All-Star center as "12," Howard's uniform number.

Nelson, Davis, and Türkoğlu are the only remaining Orlando players who were teammates of Howard's, and Nelson is the only one still playing. Davis is likely out for the year with a foot injury, while Türkoğlu is serving a suspension and won't be eligible to return until March 27th.

On March 12th, Howard and the Lakers will visit Orlando for the first time since the Magic traded him to L.A. The Magic rallied with a 40-point fourth quarter to upset the Lakers in the teams' first meeting.
