        "text": "Gene Wang/Getty Images\n\nIt's safe to say that Dwight Howard got some inspiration from the first ever NBA In-Season Tournament.\n\nThe eight-time All-Star is currently eyeing an NBA comeback after being away from the league since the 2021-22 season. He spent 2022-23 with the Taoyuan Leopards in Taiwan and was linked to the Golden State Warriors at one point this offseason.\n\nWhile he has not appeared in a game yet this season, the 38-year-old took to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, to express his desire to take the court for an In-Season Tournament game before he calls it a career.\n\nThe tournament debuted this season and saw a group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout round. All games were played at home courts before the semifinals and championship game, which were played in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and Indiana Pacers advanced to the first championship game, which took place Saturday night. Given Howard's multiple stints with the Lakers franchise, it's certainly east to see how he felt drawn to the event.\n\nHoward has career averages of 15.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks. While he is not the superstar that he used to be, he could certainly provide a veteran presence to a team in need of experienced role players."
