        "text": "Background\n\nDwight David Howard II, or Dwight Howard, was born in Atlanta, U.S., on December 8, 1985, to Dwight Sr. and his wife, Sheryl Howard. His father was a Georgia State Trooper and the athletic director at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy where Howard attended high school. His mother, Sheryl, was a member of the inaugural women’s basketball team at Morris Brown College.\n\nAs a senior, Howard led his team to a 31-2 record and the 2004 state title, while averaging 25 points, 18 rebounds, 8.1 blocks, and 3.5 assists per game. He was recognized as the best high school basketball player in America. In the very same year, also received the following awards: the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award; the Morgan Wootten High School Player of the Year Award; Gatorade National Player of the Year; and the McDonald’s National High School Player of the Year honor.\n\n2010 was controversial for him; he won a defamation judgment against Royce Reed, the mother of his oldest child, Braylon. A Florida judge ruled that she violated a court order that barred her from mentioning his name in the media. He sought around $500 million in damages as she belittled him on Twitter and the T.V. show, “Basketball Wives.” In October 2014, the police in Cobb County, Georgia, examined all the claims by Reed that Howard had abused their son. Despite Howard admitting to belting his son to discipline the child, he was not charged with any of the accusations.\n\nHoward owns a farm in North Georgia where he likes to spend time in nature and with his animals, such as cows, hogs, turkeys, and deer. Farming on his estate is also one of his hobbies."
