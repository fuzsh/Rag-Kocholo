        "text": "Santiago Felipe/Getty Images\n\nDwight Howard has not given up on continuing his NBA career.\n\nThe former NBA All-Star said he hopes to get one more run with the Orlando Magic before retiring.\n\n\"If I could go back with a team, I gotta go back with the Magic. It's only right,\" Howard said on The OGs podcast (16:34 mark).\n\nHoward played for the Magic from 2004 to 2012, making six All-Star teams and winning three Defensive Player of the Year awards. He exited the organization after his relationship with then-coach Stan Van Gundy fell apart in 2012, heading to the Lakers via trade for one season before signing with the Houston Rockets in free agency a year later.\n\nWhile he made two more All-NBA and All-Star teams after leaving Orlando, Howard's career was never the same. He battled back injuries and saw his reputation around the league take a significant hit—particularly as he and James Harden failed to win a championship in Houston.\n\nAfter leaving the Rockets in 2016, Howard played for five more NBA teams over the next five seasons. He last played for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021-22 before spending time with the Taoyuan Leopards in Taijuan and most recently Mets de Guaynabo in Puerto Rico."
