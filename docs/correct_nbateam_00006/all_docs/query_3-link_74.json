        "text": "A crutch​ of​ a response pervaded​ the​ Wizards locker​ room​ during​ end-of-season exit​ interviews.​ Guys couldn’t reflect on the​ year yet;​ that sort​​ of stuff happens over the summer.\n\nNow, evaluations are heaving themselves every which way in Washington. The team is using a search firm to analyze its organizational priorities and look for its new president. Front office members and coaches are trying to improve. And players must be wondering what they could have done better amidst a 50-loss season.\n\nPart 2 is centers. Part 3 is wings, coming early next week. Check out Part 1, the guards.\n\nLet’s get to this.\n\nThomas Bryant\n\nStat to Watch: 7.3\n\nScott Brooks had a quiet belief all season. The Wizards couldn’t rebound well, whether his starting center was playing or not. He appreciated Thomas Bryant’s hustle. He gravitated to his energy. But Brooks couldn’t get Bryant’s enthusiastic ball-chasing to turn into team-wide success.\n\nCoaches worked with the 21-year-old on a simple concept: The point of rebounding isn’t for an individual to corral a board; it’s for the team to do it. Bryant could retrieve clanks, hustling after loose balls with more verve than anyone else on the floor. His energy was a regular-season advantage. When you hustle every play and you’re going against tired teams in the middle of February and March, you’re going to beat the competition to spots on the floor. But how about helping everyone else?\n\nThat aspect of Bryant’s rebounding hasn’t developed, yet. But he’s still young. He’s inexperienced.\n\nThe Wizards worked with Bryant on box-out fundamentals throughout the year. They knew Bryant sticking his behind into other bigs down low, blocking out one or two at a time and allowing his teammates to grab uncontested boards would help far more than him chasing the ball whenever he saw it.\n\nBy the end of the year, the Wizards’ rebound rate crested to a higher number with Bryant on the court compared to off it, though those figures were reversed for much of the season. But Washington still wants its inspiring center sticking his bump into more opponents. The Wizards finished 28th in defensive rebound rate and 25th in offensive rebound rate this season.\n\nBryant averaged only 7.3 box-outs per 36 minutes, according to NBA.com’s (somewhat ambiguous) box-out data tracking. Just about anyone on the Wizards will praise Bryant’s work ethic. He’ll turn boarding into one of his focuses during the offseason.\n\nWizards boxout per 36 minute leaders\n\nSOURCE: NBA.com\n\nWhere will he play next season?\n\nLet’s set the Wizards as the favorites to re-sign Bryant, even if no one knows who’s going to be making the decisions for a front office that’s searching for its replacement for former president of basketball operations Ernie Grunfeld. Bryant is a young, productive offensive center who might not be too pricey on the open market. He’s not a top-tier restricted free agent, which means he could drift through July unsigned for at least a couple of weeks. By that time, other teams with cap space might have used up their room.\n\nOffensive-minded centers are the running backs of the NBA these days. There are plenty of them, and they can come for an inexpensive price.\n\nBut it takes only one to fall in love with Bryant. Someone could hope for defensive progression — he is, after all, 21 years old, a worker, a popular teammate and a charming-as-ever personality — and figure he’ll grow into a deal that looks doughy today but could seem more reasonable in two years. But if that doesn’t happen, bet he ends up in Washington again next year. The Wizards are proud of what they found when they nabbed Bryant off waivers last summer. Some of those people who were present for his acquisition could still be around into the future, no matter who’s at the top of the organization. Those people might like to see this through. The team, after all, is excited about what Bryant could become.\n\nIs he a diver or a shooter?\n\nBrooks’ No. 1 emphasis in turning Bryant into an offensive centerpiece this season was a change in his mindset. Bryant attempted five 3-pointers a game playing in the G League last year, but Brooks didn’t want him to spend nearly as much time on the perimeter. It wasn’t an old-school, the-center-is-supposed-to-stay-underneath-the-basket mentality. Brooks believed Bryant was a dynamic roll man and wanted the 7-footer drawing defenders into the paint as he dove to the hoop.\n\nIt worked better than the Wizards coach ever could have imagined.\n\nBryant led the league in 2-point percentage while also shooting an NBA-best 79.9 percent inside the restricted area. He splashed in 33 percent of his 3s but took only a couple per 36 minutes.\n\nGetting up to the mid-to-high 30s from beyond the arc could make Bryant one of Earth’s better offensive big men. But there’s risk in drifting from the paint. There’s no need to ruin the progression from this season merely in an effort to become 3-point reliant.\n\nThere’s another reason Brooks wanted to turn Bryant into primarily a roller upon his arrival. It simplified the center’s thought process. Brooks constantly mentioned this year how Bryant was essentially a rookie. He played only 72 NBA minutes with the Lakers last year. If he knew that all he had to do after every screen he set was sprint to the rim, he could turn that into muscle memory. That’s exactly what ended up happening.\n\nBut Bryant won’t be an inexperienced player forever. At some point, his feel will become more refined. Maybe that’s when he discovers a balance. If he does, watch out.\n\nDwight Howard\n\nStat to Watch: 230\n\nMaybe Howard can give someone, probably the Wizards, more than the 230 minutes he provided all of this past season. But he’s still not close to a return.\n\nThe concern isn’t just that Howard underwent major back surgery in early December. It’s not just that doctors couldn’t initially diagnose the injury accurately. Or that his original timetable was two-to-three months and he still isn’t close to basketball shape. Or that he tweaked a hamstring during his rehab which further hurt his chances of a 2018-19 return. It’s that this is the second time Howard has gone through this recovery.\n\nHe underwent surgery for a herniated disc in his back in 2012. He did it again five months ago. Same doctor. Same operation. Everything. Except this time, he was 33 years old. This time, he spent 230 minutes looking like he was tied to the ground. And it was no secret. He would be the first to tell anyone he didn’t feel like himself during the little time he stepped on the court this year.\n\nClearly, no one is at fault for this — other than the aging process of the human body. But Howard will without a doubt have a simple goal heading into next season: Top 230 minutes.\n\nWhere will he play next year?\n\nHoward already picked up his $5.6 million option for next season, and while that guarantees he gets his money, it doesn’t mean he’s absolutely assured to be in D.C.\n\nWhoever owner Ted Leonsis brings in to run the team could decide that giving a 33-year-old entering his 16th NBA season a starting role isn’t worth it. Heck, he could decide handing him automatic playing time isn’t prudent. If the Wizards want to develop young guys, if they bring back Bryant, if they add another youthful big, if winning isn’t the No. 1 priority, then what does Howard’s presence do? And these questions are all asked under the presumption that he’s healthy.\n\nIt wouldn’t be a shock if the Wizards figured out some way to send Howard elsewhere this summer. It also wouldn’t raise any eyebrows if he showed up next year ready to receive regular playing time.\n\nThe former iteration of the Wizards believed in Howard. That’s why they gave him the player option. And Brooks never had any intention of getting away from him as his starting center. If he’s healthy — and it’s anyone’s guess if he is — he could just as easily show up and play for a team trying to scrap together victories.\n\nYou provided optimism for John Wall. Do the same for Dwight Howard, please.\n\nWith all the Howard-related negativity out there, let’s take a positive view for a second: Howard barely played this year — 230 minutes over nine games before back surgery ended his season — but when he did, he actually performed encouragingly.\n\nNo, not physically, but stylistically.\n\nOne of the worries about Howard’s fit was that he was prone to hijacking offenses of the past. He was a post-up glutton who wasn’t all too effective when he banged down low. Well, that didn’t happen all too often this season. Even though he could jump barely above the rim, he got his buckets mostly from putbacks, dump-offs and dives to the hoop. The flow-chopping isolations weren’t all too present. And the numbers back that up.\n\nHe ended only 23 possessions — 2.6 a game — with passes, turnovers, fouls or shots out of the post, according to Synergy Sports. His previous career low was 3.9, which came as a rookie. He averaged 7.3 last year in Charlotte.\n\nThe on-court approach was actually appropriate. Howard was, by all means, individually solid, even if his athleticism was in some distant land. The Wizards didn’t win with him present, but most anyone from this roster could claim the same. If his springiness continues dissipating as he recovers from the surgery (and let’s be real; he’s going to be 34 years old this year), a change in past mindset could help him stay relevant. Maybe the change began in 2018.\n\nIan Mahinmi\n\nStat to Watch: 6.1\n\nLet’s touch on some personal foul information, because Mahinmi is solidifying himself as the most abundant hacker of his era.\n\nMahinmi finished fifth in the NBA in fouls per 36 minutes this year. It’s part of a historic streak.\n\nThis was the 10th straight season that the Wizards center has finished inside the top seven in that category amongst players who have played as many minutes as him during that specific year. He’s finished inside the top five during nine of those years. He’s been inside the top three during six. He’s led the league five times.\n\nHis career average of 5.7 fouls per 36 is easily the highest of any active player, according to information the NBA supplied to The Athletic. Amir Johnson is second at 5.1. He’s 17th all-time in fouls per 36, and many of the guys ahead of him played in the ultra-physical 1990s.\n\nConsidering the amount of playing time Mahinmi receives, the fouls don’t matter much — other than the points they’re giving the other team. He’s fouled out of only seven games during his three seasons with the Wizards.\n\nAs the saying goes, if you’re getting limited minutes, use your fouls. Mahinmi seems to be doing that just fine.\n\nIan Mahinmi career foul data\n\nNOTE: Qualifying players have played as many minutes as Mahinmi in specified season\n\nWhere will he play next season?\n\nWhy wouldn’t he play in Washington?\n\nYes, the Wizards owe the backup center $15.5 million next season, but he’s a free agent in 2020. This team will, at the very least, undergo a restructure and, at the very most, experience a full rebuild. No matter which is the case, 2019-20 is somewhere between a partially missing year and a lost one, given the financial inflexibility and Wall’s contract matched with a torn Achilles. That means sacrificing an asset just to part with one year of Mahinmi’s salary doesn’t make sense. It means waiving him and stretching his salary over three years — so his cap hit is a little over $5 million for each season through 2022 — isn’t worth the future ramifications.\n\nLast week, The Athletic outlined other reasons why Mahinmi will likely be with the Wizards next year. All signs point to a return.\n\nBobby Portis\n\nStat to Watch: 71.8 percent\n\nIf a player with the ball got near the Wizards’ basket over the final two months of the season, he had a good chance of scoring over Portis.\n\nOpponents made 71.8 percent of their shots that Portis contested at the rim this year, worst in the NBA according to Second Spectrum. But this goes deeper than just a number.\n\nBrooks played the former Bulls power forward almost exclusively at center during his 28 games in Washington. He, in turn, ended up playing more at the 5 than during any other year of his career. And centers never approach 72 percent in this stat. The rest of the NBA’s bottom five includes power forwards and wings. Players just outside of the bottom five are guards and wings: James Harden, T.J. Warren, Buddy Hield, Andrew Wiggins and Bradley Beal.\n\nYou have to go way down the league trailers before finding another center. Larry Nance finished 18th-to-last in the NBA with opponents shooting 65.4 percent on shots he contested at the rim. Enes Kanter was 20th-to-last at 65.3 percent. Deandre Ayton was 22nd-to-last at 64.9 percent.\n\nIn fact, Portis’ percentage is bulky for any season, the highest one of any player who’s played the majority of his minutes at center since Second Spectrum made this stat public starting in the 2013-14 season.\n\nCenters can have the largest impact — in either direction — on a defense. Their rim protection, signal calling and pick-and-roll abilities stand out to the extremes. The Wizards didn’t make life easy on Portis this year. The guards and wings had obvious problems containing the ball on the perimeter. And make no mistake about it: All layups are not created equal. If someone comes at Portis with a head of steam, the shot is going to be easier than if he’s cautiously approaching the paint. But the Wizards have a number of bigs whose statuses are up in the air for next year. And using Portis the same way they did this past season may accentuate his weakness more than necessary.\n\nBobby Portis’s rim defense\n\nSOURCE: Second Spectrum\n\nWhere will he play next season?\n\nPart of this depends on what the team chooses to do with Bryant. Brooks played those two together for only 176 total minutes after the Wizards acquired Portis with two months remaining in the season. And, as detailed above, Portis comes with defensive concerns, not just as a rim-protector but also as a pick-and-roll defender. Would the Wizards want to spend big on Portis while also bringing Bryant, another defensive question mark, back to D.C.? How does Howard’s presence play into how they operate?\n\nPortis said, “I love being a Wizard; I love being here” at his end-of-season exit interview, but one thing is for certain: He’s going wherever the money takes him. He made that clear last fall, when he bet on himself while turning down a four-year extension offer from the Bulls that would have paid him eight figures annually. His goal is to find a deal this summer that will pay him $16 million a year, according to a source familiar with his thought process. That’s a whole lot of dough, and Washington may not want to pay it, given its roster makeup.\n\nBut if his market doesn’t dictate such a gaudy number, Portis could find himself back because he’s young, he plays hard, and — oh, man — the dude can shoot it.\n\nHow does newfound shooting change Portis’ market?\n\nIt changes it plenty — enough that it could be the defining characteristic of his game.\n\nPortis has steadily raised his 3-point volume during his four NBA seasons, and during that time, he’s propped up his accuracy, too. He started hoisting them regularly three years ago, hitting a third of his attempts. He’s gone from 36 percent to 39 percent over the last two seasons.\n\nHe’s improved his release during that time. The way he rose for shots was distinctly reminiscent of a draw bridge. He needed time to get off a catch-and-shoot. But he’s quicker now. And don’t ignore that 39 percent number. It could be a leading reason he gets paid this summer.\n\nInside a league of shooting, Portis’ offensive game is what many teams desire. Only four other big men shot better than him from 3 this past season: Karl-Anthony Towns, Nemanja Bjelica, Mike Scott and JaMychal Green. Of those four, only Towns played center.\n\nPortis was, in effect, the NBA’s second-best 3-point shooting 5-man. It might feel like he’s a vet already, but he’s still only 24 years old, and his launching is on an upwards trajectory.\n\nHe might not get the money he wants; $16 million is a lot of dollars, and he didn’t get that salary in the fall, so why would he be guaranteed to receive it now? But he should get paid. And when he and his agent approach teams to talk, the No. 1 piece of information they can lay out is that Portis has officially become an elite 3-point shooting big man.\n\n(Top photo of Thomas Bryant: Noah K.
