        "text": "Santiago Felipe/Getty Images\n\nDwight Howard is headed back to Taiwan.\n\nThe future Hall of Famer is signing with the Taiwan Mustangs for the 2024 season, the team announced Thursday.\n\nHoward, 38, last played in the NBA for the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2021-22 season. He's since bounced around overseas, spending time with the Taoyuan Leopards in Taiwan and Mets de Guaynabo in Puerto Rico.\n\nAn eight-time All-Star, Howard has not given up on the idea of playing one more season in the NBA. He recently said he wants to retire with the Orlando Magic.\n\n\"If I could go back with a team, I gotta go back with the Magic. It's only right,\" Howard said on The OGs podcast (16:34 mark).\n\nHoward made six of his eight All-Star teams in Orlando and was a three-time Defensive Player of the Year. His tenure ended in unfortunate circumstances after Howard demanded a trade, a decision that began his downfall as a player and in the eyes of the public.\n\nHoward was sent to the Lakers in 2012 but spent only one season in Los Angeles amid clashes with co-star Kobe Bryant. He bolted for the Rockets in free agency in 2013 but dealt with injuries and struggled to mesh with Houston's desired style of play with James Harden.\n\nAfter leaving the Rockets in 2016, Howard played for six teams in as many seasons, winning the 2020 championship in his return to the Lakers. In 18 NBA seasons, Howard has averaged 15.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game."
