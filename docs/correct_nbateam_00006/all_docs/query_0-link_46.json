        "text": "After missing just seven games in his first seven years in the NBA, All-Star center Dwight Howard has already missed eight games this season. Missing games will continue to be the theme for Howard, as he told ESPN yesterday that he will miss the remainder of the season due to back surgery.\n\nThat remainder includes the playoffs and success without Howard might be tough; Orlando has a winning percentage of .375 when playing without the big man. Even with the odds stacked against the O-Town team, second leading scorer and forward Ryan Anderson says the rest of the team will step it up.\n\nhttps://www.wruf.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Anderson-1.mp3\n\nHoward had surgery this morning and his injury will also affect the roster of Team USAâ€™s push toward the 2012 Summer Olympics. There is little depth at center after Howard with only Tyson Chandler left at the position so there is a good chance a replacement for Howard could be obtained."
