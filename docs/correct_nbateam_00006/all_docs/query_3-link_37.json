        "text": "In a pregame media availability on Friday, Cheryl Miller ripped the league’s record new broadcast rights package and the negotiators who put it together. Miller called for a number four-times higher than the reported $2.2 billion over 11 years that the WNBA reportedly will receive starting in 2025. The new deal could be as much as six-times higher than the current deal struck in 2016. “I’m not great with numbers,” Miller told reporters in Phoenix. “That’s a lowball.”\n\nIn the USC legend and longtime basketball voice’s view, the NBA and its broadcast partners undervalued the WNBA in negotiations. “We certainly have come a long way, and I’m not about gauging, but it’s a long time overdue,” Miller said. “Women’s basketball is in a great place right now.” The NBA negotiated the new deals on behalf of the WNBA, as they have with each package since the women’s league was created nearly three decades ago."
