        "text": "Rarely did a day pass by without Orlando fans and sports ticker updates alerting Magic forward Glen Davis about Dwight Howard.\n\n“He was the topic of every conversation,” Davis recalled. “Will he stay or is he going to leave?”\n\nIn August, the Magic eventually sent Howard to the Lakers as part of a four-team, 12-player trade in return for former UCLA product Arron Afflalo (from Denver), Josh McRoberts and Christian Eyenga (Lakers) and a flurry of draft picks. Hearts quickly broke.\n\n“It was like LeBron (James) leaving Cleveland,” Davis said regarding Howard’s departure after eight seasons in Orlando. “This is the only professional sport there.”\n\nStill, the Magic insisted they have moved on from the infamously dubbed “Dwightmare,” a season-long soap opera detailing mixed messages surrounding Howard’s future.\n\nOrlando coach Jacques Vaughn reiterated to his team not to focus on Howard facing his former team Sunday for the first time since his departure. Davis said he and other teammates haven’t talked to him since the trade. He insisted most Magic fans remain indifferent.\n\nOrlando’s roster features five players who teamed with Howard last season, including Davis, Jameer Nelson, J.J. Redick, Hedo Turkoglu and Ish Smith. The Howard trade also involved Orlando sending Jason Richardson to Philadelphia and Chris Duhon as well as Earl Clark to the Lakers. Vaughn replaced Stan Van Gundy after his firing. The Magic entered their game against the Lakers ranked 29 th out of 30 NBA teams in total offense (91.13 points per game) and 20 th in 3-point shooting (34.2 percent).\n\n“You have to have people in the locker room that want to be here,” Vaughn said. “Sometimes people try to make talent overcome that. Sometimes that works.\n\n“But for the longevity and sustainability, that doesn’t work.”"
