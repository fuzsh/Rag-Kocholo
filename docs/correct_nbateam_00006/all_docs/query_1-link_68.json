        "text": "By HoopsHype |\n\nI know I can provide a team with 25 minutes of dominant basketball. And that‚Äôs not even scoring, that‚Äôs just playing defense, locking people up, protecting the paint, rebounding, and finishing around the basket. I‚Äôve had my fun in the game. I just want to go out like a champ like I‚Äôm supposed to.\n\nSource: Zion Olojede @ complex.com\n\nWhat‚Äôs the buzz on Twitter?\n\nStatMuse @statmuse\n\nMost games with 15+ PTS and 100 FG% (last 40 seasons):\n\n20 ‚Äî Rudy Gobert\n\n17 ‚Äî DeAndre Jordan\n\n13 ‚Äî Dwight Howard\n\n11 ‚Äî Tyson Chandler\n\n9 ‚Äî Dwight Powell pic.twitter.com/M9BvAYh3DX ‚Äì 3:01 PM\n\nDwight Howard @DwightHoward\n\nOpposites attract üíØ the more love and positivity you show the more hate you‚Äôll get ‚Äì 11:31 AM\n\nDwight Howard @DwightHoward\n\nI‚Äôm on threads üëÄ COME ON! ‚Äì 11:30 AM\n\nMore on this storyline\n\nTo the point of NBA teams not being interested, do you feel like you were pushed out in a way unfairly or blackballed? I could say that I have and then it could be people that say that well, I did some things that could have put me in this position. So, it could have been a little bit of both. I‚Äôll just say I‚Äôve surpassed anybody‚Äôs expectations or whatever they thought would be about Dwight Howard playing in the NBA expectations as a basketball player. Careers don‚Äôt last but four years, three to four years in the NBA. I‚Äôve surpassed that playing 19 seasons and still playing. So, it‚Äôs always two ways you can look at life. -via complex.com / July 7, 2023\n\nDwight is putting himself amongst the greats and rightfully so but while people were quick to crown Nikola Jokic as a top center to ever play the game, Dwight made his case on why his prime is still better than the Jokic‚Äôs prime. ‚ÄúObviously, people going to say Jokic can score. He got all those offensive skills,‚Äù Howard says. ‚ÄúBut at the same time, I was getting 38 and 20, 45-18, 19, 20, and I‚Äôm doing all this with twos. No threes, all twos. I‚Äôm doing this with lobs. I‚Äôm not getting a lot of post-up attempts like Jokic. He‚Äôs getting way more opportunities.‚Äù -via complex.com / July 7, 2023\n\nA lot of people have now said the Jokic is a top five center of all time. Where do you see yourself ranking among the greats at the position? All-time centers, I‚Äôm top 10. Top 10 all-time. I know everybody what they‚Äôre going to say with Shaq, Hakeem, Wilt, Kareem, and then you got Moses Malone. -via complex.com / July 7, 2023"
