Itâs a lot of people who are and they have to hide and itâs people who have mental issues and they have to hide. Itâs people who have different problems in life and they have to hide.\n\nThey have to put on the mask every day. Itâs like, I donât want to wear no mask. I just want to be,â said Dwight.\n\nDwight Howard claims that while the allegations that he is gay âhurtâ him, handling the aftermath has âliberatedâ him.\n\n\"I'm not gayâ¦ It hurt at first to go through it.
