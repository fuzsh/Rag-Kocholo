        "text": "Former Orlando Magic legend and NBA-veteran; Dwight Howard has had quite a journey in the NBA, and far beyond that. Recently, Howard tried out for the Golden State Warriors and was rejected for the position. Howard recently played for the Taoyuan Leopards in Taiwan last year, the last time Howard played in the NBA since the 2021-2022 season where he last played for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWhen asked about why the Warriors chose not to sign Howard, Mike Dunleavy Jr expressed “The player you mentioned is just one of many that we brought in and evaluated, and you know, I think right now you’ll know more about who we’re inviting to camp in a couple of days.” The player mentioned was Howard.\n\nThe Warriors ended up signing 21-year old Usman Garuba as well as NBA veteran Rudy Gay. This possibly revealed that the real reason Howard was not signed was due to them having more hope in Garuba and Gay.\n\nOther NBA teams have not expressed interest in Howard as of the 28th of September. This is similar to the 2022-2023 season when Howard couldn’t find an NBA team to sign him, hence his transfer to Taiwan.\n\nDwight Howard reportedly also has no interest in returning back to Taiwan. “I was offered a contract which was 65 percent less than they gave me the first time I came to Taiwan, and I felt like that was very disrespectful… I felt like I brought value to the team” said Howard.\n\nA team in question that Howard might have the possibility of joining is the Boston Celtics. The Celtics traded away big man Robert Williams III in a package trade in order to get Jrue Holiday from the Portland Trail blazers. This package deal has left space available for the Boston Celtics and especially with a big man leaving, it could be a possibility for Howard to get a minimum contract at the least from Boston.\n\nWith Howard not wanting to go back to Taiwan, Warriors rejecting him, and the NBA teams not having interest in Howard, it begs the question on where will Howard end up, could Boston possibly be the answer? More answers will have to be revealed as time goes on."
