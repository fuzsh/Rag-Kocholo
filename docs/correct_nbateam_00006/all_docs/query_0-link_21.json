        "text": "Orlando Magic, American professional basketball team based in Orlando, Florida, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Magic have won two Eastern Conference titles (1995, 2009).\n\nThe franchise, along with the Minnesota Timberwolves, joined the NBA as an expansion team in the 1989–90 season. During its first three years the Magic’s play was mediocre and the team posted losing records, but the Magic began a remarkably quick turnaround when it selected centre Shaquille O’Neal with the first overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft. Led by O’Neal, the Magic added 20 wins to its previous year’s total in his first season to finish with a 41–41 record and a tie for the last playoff position in the Eastern Conference, which it lost in a tiebreaker with the Indiana Pacers. The lost tiebreaker proved fortuitous, for it placed the Magic in the 1993 draft lottery, which the Magic won despite having only a 1.5 percent chance of attaining the first overall draft choice. The team traded the player it selected, Chris Webber, for the third selection, point guard Anfernee (“Penny”) Hardaway, and future draft picks.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nThe young Magic team qualified for its first playoff berth in the 1993–94 season, an accomplishment it bettered in 1994–95 by advancing to the NBA finals in its sixth year of existence. The Magic were swept by the Houston Rockets in four games, but the team’s future nevertheless seemed bright. At the end of the 1995–96 season, however, O’Neal moved to the Los Angeles Lakers after signing the largest free-agent contract in NBA history, and Orlando was left without its marquee player. The Magic entered into a period of regular-season success followed by losses in the first round of the postseason, during which the franchise traded away the injury-plagued Hardaway in 1999."
