        "text": "With the way things are going, Klay Thompson and the Golden State Warriors are heading to a split in the coming days. Former NBA champion Dwight Howard, in turn, has suggested two teams the Splash Brother can join during free agency this year.\n\nDrafted 11th overall by the Warriors in 2011, Thompson quickly established himself as a key player. In 2014, he and teammate All-Star point guard Stephen Curry set an NBA record for most combined three-pointers in a season, earning them the nickname “the Splash Brothers.” Thompson played a crucial role in the Warriors’ championship runs, helping the team win four NBA titles in 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2022.\n\nThompson’s shooting prowess and defensive contributions have earned him multiple accolades, including five NBA All-Star selections, two All-NBA Third Team honors, and an NBA All-Defensive Second Team selection. He has also represented the United States national team, winning gold medals at the 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nDespite facing various injury setbacks, including an ACL tear in the 2019 NBA Finals, Thompson has demonstrated his resilience and commitment to the game. His return to the court in the 2021-22 season was celebrated, and he played a key role in the Warriors’ fourth championship triumph.\n\nFormer NBA Star Dwight Howard Suggests Klay Thompson Could Join Los Angeles Lakers or San Antonio Spurs\n\nThe coming days are going to be crucial for Thompson as the Warriors aren’t too keen to extend him for a big bag of money. In this regard, Howard has suggested these two teams for the Splash Brother in a tweet he shared on his X account.\n\nOver the course of his NBA career, Thompson has averaged 19.6 points on 41 percent shooting deep, 3.5 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game. Having him on either the Lakers or Spurs will add a degree of veteran leadership, floor spacing, and outside shooting to either roster. However, his age and injury history may prevent him contributing on a high level.\n\nIt remains to be seen where Thompson will land in the coming days or if he joins the teams Howard mentioned. In any case, it’d be interesting to see whether the All-Star made the right decision to leave Golden State as the upcoming season unfolds.\n\nFor More Great Basketball Content"
