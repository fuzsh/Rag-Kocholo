        "text": "Dwight Howard had 24 points and 25 rebounds for the Orlando Magic in their overtime win over the rival Miami Heat in what may have been Howard's final home game for the Magic, with the trade deadline approaching at 3 p.m. Thursday. Afterward, Howard told reporters he has told the Magic that he wants to stay on with the Magic beyond the deadline, through the end of the year.\n\nOf course Howard would want to stay now. If he stays, first, he is assured of playing in the playoffs this season — something he isn't assured of if he is traded to the Nets. Second, if he does intend to sign with the Nets as a free agent this summer, as Yahoo Sports reported Tuesday, it would be better for him if the Nets didn't have to give up assets to trade for him. It would be better, certainly, if Howard could join a Nets team that had Brook Lopez and MarShon Brooks and all of their first round picks, than one which was without those players and draft picks.\n\n• Dwight Howard intends to sign with Nets, whether he is traded or not, report says\n\n• Nets stories and columns\n\n• Nets photos\n\n• Nets videos\n\nHoward pleaded his case to stay with reporters, saying the Magic — who have the third-best record in the Eastern Conference, at 28-15 — have a chance to win it all this season. But even Howard admitted by keeping him, the Magic will have to \"roll the dice'' that he won't walk away this summer as a free agent, which would mean they would lose him for nothing in return. The Magic may not want to take that chance. Later, Magic CEO Alex Martins told the Orlando Sentinel, \"We will do what is in the best interest of the Magic organization, its ownership & its fans,\" which certainly sounds as though Orlando may trade the six-time All-Star center.\n\nThe Magic have been trying to drum up interest around the league from teams that may be willing to take a chance of trading for Howard without the assurance that he will sign a contract extension with them. One of those teams came off the board Tuesday evening when the Golden State Warriors, who had been willing to trade shooting guard Monta Ellis for Howard, instead traded Ellis and two others to the Milwaukee Bucks for oft-injured center Andrew Bogut and swingman Stephen Jackson.\n\nHouston is the other team that has been among the forefront of those teams willing to take a chance on renting Howard. The Nets, Dallas Mavericks and Lakers are the teams Howard has said he would re-sign with, and of these, the Nets are by far the front runner. Originally, the Nets had been willing to offer Brook Lopez, plus two first round picks and whatever else Orlando wanted to get Howard. Rookie MarShon Brooks' name had come up as well, and the Nets at one point were wiling to take on the two years remaining on Hedo Turkoglu's salary.\n\nBut now, with the Magic seemingly out of options, the Nets may not be so willing to give up too much for Howard."
