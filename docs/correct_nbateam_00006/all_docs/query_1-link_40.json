        "text": "In his brief stint as part of Team Philippines, Dwight Howard is already keen on playing in Asia’s oldest professional basketball league.\n\nDuring Strong Group’s open practice in Makati, the NBA’s three-time Defensive Player of the Year says he’s open to the idea provided the PBA relaxes its height limit on imports, saying he’s “6’9 without shoes”\n\n“I hope they do that so guys like Dray can come back here and play as well. I know he wants to play in the PBA,”, said Howard, referring to 6’11 Andray Blatche, who is also part of the team’s campaign for the Dubai International Basketball Championship. The PBA currently imposes a 6’9 limit for foreign players in the Commissioner's Cup, and 6’6 for the Governor’s Cup.\n\nThe social media-savvy Howard has also appealed the restrictions online, posting a video of him getting his height measured in a grocery store.\n\n“Have you ever heard of a basketball league that has a height restriction? My Pinoy fans want me to play so bad they brought the measuring tape out to prove that I’m under the height limit I’m a 6’9 Point Forward,” wrote the 38-year-old in the caption.\n\nThe PBA’s height limit has been a contentious topic between the league and its fans for years, with the former saying it balances competition, and the latter arguing it will allow the association to keep up with its other counterparts in Asia."
