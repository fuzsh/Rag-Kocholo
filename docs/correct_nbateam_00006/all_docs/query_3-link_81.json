        "text": "Dwight Howard's trade last month to the Brooklyn Nets was the latest turn yet in an embarrassing downward spiral for the future Hall of Fame center. Howard, once one of the NBA's most dominant players, and a man who knocked off Lebron James at the peak of his powers--preventing a Kobe-Lebron Finals--has now become nothing more than a punchline in our broader conscience. Back before the Bobcats thought he could be resuscitated, and even before the Hawks decided that for some reason he was worth breaking up their Paul Millsap/Al Horford pairing, I remember when he was considered the final piece in the Houston Rockets championship puzzle. Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey acquired Howard in free agency less than a full year after obtaining star guard James Harden in a trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder. It was believed that the pairing was a natural fit given Harden's effectiveness in the pick-and-roll and Howard's efficiency around the rim. Both players were young enough that it was believed the next era in Houston Rockets basketball was set. Just three seasons later, Howard was gone, with rumors foreshadowing his departure from the start of his third year.\n\nWhether the Howard era in Houston was a failure is a point of contention. It's certainly remembered as such by fans of the team. But how much of that evaluation is clouded by the messiness of the divorce? In his three years with the team, the big man averaged 16.0 points per game, 11.7 rebounds per game, and 1.6 blocks per game on 60% shooting from the field. The team won 54 and 56 games in Howard's first two seasons--with a trip to the Western Conference Finals--before bottoming out at 41 wins in his third year. Having posted the aforementioned numbers, Howard certainly produced. And a trip to the league's final four is a good benchmark for team success. But there's a feeling that the team could have accomplished so much more with Howard - a feeling intensified by the success the Rockets have enjoyed with Howard's successor, Clint Capela, starting in his place.\n\nHoward, of course, grew unhappy with his role on the team, believing that he should have been fed more in the post. And while he was lethal in the pick and roll attack, he was reluctant to serve in that role. Meanwhile, Houston has flourished since parting ways with Howard, winning 55 and 65 games respectively in each of the past two seasons. Part of that success is due to Morey using the money freed up from shedding Howard's salary on rich deals for shooting guard Eric Gordon and power forward Ryan Anderson. But part of it is that Capela is just a better fit for a Harden-centric team. He's selfless offensively, a willing participant in the pick and roll, and a great finisher; the team doesn't need to waste valuable possessions to appease him. I argued back in 2016, before Howard's free agency, that Capela was ready for the job.\n\nWas attitude the only thing that held Howard back? It's often said that the sky was the limit if Howard could have just set his ego aside and played to his strengths. I'm not sure that that is entirely true. While he's a more physically imposing force than Capela, Howard can't move laterally on the perimeter as well as Capela can at this stage in his career. That trait is crucial for the Rockets' switching defense where Capela is required to pick up guards in the halfcourt. While Howard would have fared better against the Thunder's Steven Adams in 2017; I'm not sure how he would have looked matched up with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in this year's Western Conference Finals.\n\nNow Howard moves on to the latest chapter in his career. While the divorce with Houston was messy, it was also simply time to move on for reasons beyond Howard's control."
