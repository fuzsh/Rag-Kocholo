        "text": "Welcome to the NBA 75, The Athletic’s countdown of the 75 best players in NBA history, in honor of the league’s diamond anniversary. From Nov. 1 through Feb. 18, we’ll unveil a new player on the list every weekday except for Dec. 27-31, culminating with the man picked by a panel of The Athletic NBA staff members as the greatest of all time.\n\nDwight Howard never expected to make the NBA’s official 75th Anniversary Team. And in his mind, his absence from the all-time squad had little to do with basketball.\n\nHoward has a theory. His omission from the team released in October — which players, media, coaches and executives voted on and aimed to name the 75 best players since the league’s inception in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America — is more personal than hoops-inspired.\n\n“I can’t go back and do anything right now,” Howard said in a recent conversation with The Athletic. “But at the time, I was kinda bitter to hear that I wasn’t on that list.”\n\nBut Howard is on ours. He clocks in at No. 56 on The Athletic’s Top 75.\n\nHe calls his exclusion from the league’s list “very disrespectful” and comes armed with reasons why.\n\n“You hear people say, ‘He was only dominant for a couple of years.’ I didn’t know eight years of being an All-Star, being dominant for eight years, was a couple of years,” he said. “I didn’t know winning three Defensive Player of the Year awards in a row, and it should’ve been four, is something that is considered not good.\n\n“There’s guys who don’t have those many accolades. I’m the (youngest) player that’s (reached) 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 all the way up to 9,000 rebounds. That doesn’t add up. So, where is the miscommunication? Where is the lie with my stats?”\n\nThere was a point when Howard, the No. 1 selection in the 2004 draft out of high school, was the darling of the NBA, a joyous, generational talent leading the small-market Magic back to relevance. That all turned near the end of his time in Orlando a decade ago. A trade request that turned murky; a ferociously uncomfortable news conference with at-the-time Magic coach Stan Van Gundy; a one-year stint with the Lakers, where he says he initially preferred not to go; a nomadic second act; and multiple serious back surgeries have changed his vibes, and — as for the last one — his otherworldly athleticism.\n\nBut as he plays out the remainder of a career that so far has spanned 18 seasons, there is one sentiment to remember:\n\nHoward has a point.\n\nHe believes his absence from the NBA’s official top 75 list is because of the way he left Orlando, because of how his reputation changed during the second half of his career. Concentrate on the basketball, however, and you have a top-75 player. And that’s exactly why Howard lands cleanly on The Athletic’s all-time list.\n\nThere are arguments for his inclusion beyond the accolades Howard notes. He’s come close to winning an MVP, finishing second to Derrick Rose in 2011 and fourth in 2009 and 2010. He has a case as the most dominant defender of his generation. Only three other players in history (Dikembe Mutombo, Ben Wallace and Rudy Gobert) have three NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards.\n\nHe has led the league in rebounds six times and blocks twice. He’s one of six players ever — along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Robert Parish and Artis Gilmore — with 19,000 points, 14,000 rebounds and 2,000 blocks in his career.\n\nMaybe the greatest argument for Howard is how his best years compare to those who made the NBA’s official top 75 list. Seventeen centers ended up on the 75th Anniversary Team. Only six of them earned as many All-NBA First Teams as Howard, who has earned the honor five times. That’s more than 11 top-75 centers from the NBA’s list — including legendary big men Bill Russell, Patrick Ewing, Moses Malone, Bob McAdoo, David Robinson, Bill Walton, Nate Thurmond, Dave Cowens, Parish, Willis Reed and Wes Unseld.\n\nOf course, Howard’s career has spanned an era when centers are less involved. It was far more difficult to make an All-NBA First Team when Robinson, Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon and Shaquille O’Neal were all in their primes. Still, five First Teams is an exceptional number, even among the elite.\n\nThe advanced numbers back up his case, too. He’s 31st all-time in win shares, directly ahead of top-75 shoo-ins Jason Kidd, Bob Pettit and Clyde Drexler\n\nSo, it begs the question: Why did Howard fall short?\n\nSome could argue it’s a dire case of recency bias. He has bounced around from team to team during the second portion of his career. Including two franchises who traded for him only to waive him (the Nets and Grizzlies), he’s been with seven organizations since 2016, including twice with the Lakers, which does not give off top-75 ambiance. He hasn’t played for the same team in consecutive seasons since 2013-16 with the Rockets.\n\nHe underwent career-altering back surgery in 2012, which chipped at the soaring athleticism that drove his all-world defense, lob finishing and cape-draped thrunks. He had the same surgery again in 2018.\n\nHoward argues his omission from the NBA’s list is more personal than academic.\n\n“I feel as though since I left Orlando and since I left L.A. the first time and how the media depicted me in the situation, both have kinda left a bad taste in people’s mouths about who I am,” he said. “In their mind, they have this stigma of who they think Dwight Howard is, and it’s unfair because I’ve never even had a chance to express any of this stuff.\n\n“I just kinda kept quiet. I kinda tried to allow my work to speak for itself, and now it’s cost me things like not being on (the NBA’s) top 75 list, which I feel is very unfair. But I kinda knew that it was gonna be something that was gonna happen.”\n\nThe reputation swing Howard mentions began near the end of his time in Orlando. Early in his career, his goofy demeanor turned him into a generally beloved figure, especially in central Florida. The Magic, in turn, became a transformative group. Van Gundy lined four shooters around the perimeter with Howard setting screens and pulverizing opponents around the hoop. The one-in, four-out strategy is basic now.\n\nBack then, however, shooting as many 3s as they did in the way they did it was part of a revolution — only half a decade removed from the start of Mike D’Antoni’s Suns, whose fast-paced, spread pick-and-rolls refashioned the NBA forever.\n\nOn the other side, Howard cleaned up dribblers or cutters who fled past teammates. Infiltrators could invade the paint at their own risk. He was a one-man defense.\n\nIn a 2009 survey, the league’s general managers voted a 25-year-old LeBron James as the player they would choose first to start a hypothetical team. The second-place finisher was Howard. In that same poll, the GMs named Howard the NBA’s best defender by a landslide.\n\nAt that time, Howard had just led the Magic to the NBA Finals. In 2010, Orlando lost to the Garnett-Paul Pierce-Ray Allen Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals. A fall-off began a year later when the same Hawks group the Magic had swept out of the postseason the previous spring knocked Orlando out in the first round.\n\nNot long after and with his free agency looming, Howard asked for a trade from the Magic, leading to a famously messy saga with a catchy nickname, “The Dwightmare,” which included the aforementioned Van Gundy news conference, an uncomfortably picked-up player option and a seemingly never-ending trade request. Howard reportedly stated a preference to go to the Nets. The drama eventually ended in 2012, when the Magic dealt him to the Lakers, who were putting together a super team with Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Pau Gasol.\n\nLos Angeles ended up winning only 45 games. The Spurs swept them in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n“My intention when I first left Orlando was not to go to L.A., and the Magic knew that, but despite my wishes to go somewhere else, they sent me to L.A., which was one of the places at that time that I did not want to go. I felt like it would have made people feel as though I was trying to follow in somebody else’s footsteps,” Howard said, a reference to Hall of Fame center Shaquille O’Neal, to whom a young Howard drew comparisons.\n\nO’Neal began his career in Orlando and took the Magic to the 1995 NBA Finals before leaving for the Lakers and winning three titles. The two famously share the same nickname, “Superman.” O’Neal became well-known for his criticisms of Howard’s play.\n\n“When they traded me there, I said, ‘You know what? This might be where I’m supposed to be,’” Howard said.\n\nAround that time, a more negative reaction to Howard’s playfulness built momentum, especially while he played alongside Bryant, a fierce competitor. His disposition was holding him back, some argued. He lacked a killer instinct. He didn’t work hard enough.\n\nHoward uses a 32-point, 30-rebound game he had during his one season in Charlotte, only the second 30-30 game in the NBA since 1982, to push against the critics.\n\n“Their take even on the 30-30 game was, ‘Well, he could’ve been doing that every night if he just took the game seriously,’” he said. “It’s like, it doesn’t make any sense. I did something that hasn’t been done — once in 35 years by Kevin Love.”\n\nHoward left the Lakers after a season and then spent three years in Houston, saying it wasn’t because he “couldn’t handle the bright lights or handle the pressure of being in L.A.,” but because he saw a younger team with a younger elite shooting guard in James Harden.\n\n“I love the camera. I love entertaining,” Howard said. “But I made a career choice.”\n\nHe could still grab boards and guard with the Rockets, but the back surgery near the end of his Magic days hacked away at some of the explosiveness. Once he departed Houston, he bounced around like few others on this top-75 list ever did.\n\nIn six seasons since, he’s donned five jerseys: Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington, the Lakers (twice) and Philadelphia. He’s been salary dumped multiple times. The Nets and Grizzlies traded for him without any intention of keeping him — though he has carved out a newly defined role since Memphis released him in 2019 amidst health concerns (which followed a second major back surgery) as an energetic backup center and enforcer on winning teams, most notably helping the Lakers win a title in 2020.\n\nIt has meant a nuanced legacy for Howard. But the defensive dominance, the high-flying dunks, the cumulative numbers — even after the surgeries — are enough to justify him as one of the 75 best to play the game.\n\n“My legacy as a player: I always played hard. I always gave 100 percent to the game, and I always took the game seriously, and I wanted to have fun,” Howard said. “One of the hardest-working players to ever play. I feel like — I’ve been playing for 18 years right now. Still going. I did all the things that I could do from Year 1.”\n\nCareer stats#: G: 1,182, Pts.: 16.2 , Reb.: 12.1, Ast.: 1.4, FG%: .586, FT%: .566, Win Shares: 138.2, PER: 21.4\n\nThe Athletic NBA 75 Panel points: 272 | Hollinger GOAT Points*: 169.0\n\nAccolades: Eight-time All-NBA, Eight-time All-Star, Defensive Player of the Year (’09, ’10, ’11), Rebounding champ (’08, ’09, ’10, ’12, ’13), Blocks champ (’09, ’10), FG% champ (’10), NBA champ (’20), Olympic gold (’08)\n\n#Through the 2020-21 season\n\n*A rating of a player’s accumulated accomplishments at the highest levels, based mostly on comparable historical factors, determined heavily but not completely by contemporary evaluations (i.e. awards and All-Star selections).
