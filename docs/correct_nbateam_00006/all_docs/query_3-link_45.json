        "text": "Dwight Howard became a basketball sensation in his high school itself. As a senior, he led his high school team to the 2004 state title with a 31–2 record. And in the very same year, he earned himself the honor of Mr. Georgia Basketball. Following in the footsteps of his icon, Kevin Garnett, DH12 dropped out of college and declared for the 2004 NBA draft.\n\nHis high school proficiency paid off, as Orlando Magic drafted the emerging player, who would go on to become 8x All-Star. Howard played for more than a decade and a half in the league and while doing so, he earned himself multiple accolades. It’s quite obvious he would have made a significant amount of money from the NBA. Today we will take a closer look at the 38-year-old’s wealth.\n\nDwight Howard’s earnings from the NBA\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, the 2020 NBA champ’s net worth stands at $140 million. And a major portion of this wealth came from his NBA earnings. He made $245.1 million throughout his NBA career. This does not amount to his entire net worth, but the amount of money he made with different teams over 18 seasons.\n\nThough his points per game were not exceptional, in his first season itself, Howard scored a double-double. He also became the second runner-up in the Defensive Player of the Year race in his rookie season. Subsequently, the Magic signed a 5 year, $83.2 million rookie extension with DH12. And he did not disappoint, as he led the Magic to 5 consecutive playoffs, including an NBA Finals appearance.\n\nBut after failing to win the championship, Magic traded Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he made $19.5 million in his single season. But his differences with Kobe Bryant made 3x DPOY find his way to the Houston Rockets with a $87.5 million contract. In the final year of the contract, Howard had a $23.3 million player option, but the 8x All-Star opted out to enter free agency.\n\nWhat came next for Howard was a 3 year, $70.5 million contract with the Atlanta Hawks. But he only played one season with the team, after which he mostly bounced around the league. Doing so, he signed several more multi-million dollar contracts before landing his last contract in the league with the Lakers. Notably, his first and only championship also came with the Lakers in 2020.\n\nOnce the NBA teams refused to sign the 3x DPOY, he found his place in international leagues, but his earnings from those contracts are unknown.\n\nMore on the former Orlando Magic star’s wealth\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nApart from the above-stated earnings from the league, the ex-NBA star also grabbed multiple endorsement deals with prominent brands Adidas, McDonald’s, Gatorade, and Oreo, among others. Another noteworthy deal for the NBA champ came with a Chinese sneaker brand, ‘Peak’, in 2015. Though the exact details of the deal are not in the public domain, the estimation, according to the reports, ranges from $15 million to $30 million.\n\nIn terms of real estate, Dwight Howard bought a $7.8 million home in Orlando, which he later put on sale after he parted ways with the Magic. Following that, he bought a massive 20,000-square-foot house in Atlanta for $12.5 million in 2016. The house is said to be equipped with multiple facilities, including a pool house, an infinity pool, and tennis courts.\n\nAnother addition to the 8x All-Star’s possession is his collection of four-wheelers, including Knight XV Truck, Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG 6X6, Rolls Royce Cullinan, Rolls Royce Ghost, and Bentley Mulsanne. While Howard is no longer active in the NBA, he still leads a luxurious life for himself.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nStay tuned for more such updates.
