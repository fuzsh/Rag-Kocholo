        "text": "Established in Orlando, Florida, in 1989, the Magic is a professional basketball team that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team has won two conference titles (1995, 2009).\n\nThe franchise joined the NBA in the 1989–90 season. During its first three years the Magic posted losing records, but the team began a quick turnaround after selecting center Shaquille O’Neal with the first overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft. In O’Neal’s first season, the Magic added 20 wins to its previous year’s total to finish with a 41–41 record and a tie for the last play-off position in the Eastern Conference, which it lost in a tiebreaker with the Indiana Pacers. The lost tiebreaker qualified Orlando for the 1993 draft lottery, which the Magic won. The team selected Chris Webber with the first overall pick but immediately traded him for the third selection, point guard Anfernee (Penny) Hardaway, and future draft picks.\n\nThe young Magic team made the play-offs for the first time in the 1993–94 season. In the next season Orlando advanced to the NBA finals in only its sixth year of play. The Magic was swept by the Houston Rockets in four games, but the team’s future nevertheless seemed bright. At the end of the 1995–96 season, however, O’Neal signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Orlando was left without its marquee player. The Magic entered into a period of regular-season success followed by losses in the first round of the play-offs, during which the team traded away the injury-plagued Hardaway in 1999."
