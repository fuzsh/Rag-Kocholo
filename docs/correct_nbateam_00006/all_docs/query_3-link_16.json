        "text": "Dwight Howard: Finds work overseas\n\nHoward agreed to a contract Tuesday with Strong Group Philippines and will play with the squad during the 2024 Dubai International Basketball Championship in late January, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports. Howard spent last season playing in Taiwan and earned a workout with Golden State this preseason, and he'll now continue his pursuit of an NBA comeback with Strong Group Philippines. Former NBA guard Andre Roberson will join Howard on the squad. Howard hasn't logged NBA action since the 2021-22 season with the Lakers, when he averaged 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds in 16.2 minutes per game.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Will rest Sunday\n\nHoward (rest) will not play Sunday against Denver, Dave McMenamin of ESPN reports. Howard will join Anthony Davis, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook in street clothes Sunday as the Lakers put a bow on one of the most disappointing seasons in NBA history. With the veteran big man out, Wenyen Gabriel will get the nod at center as the Lakers go with a small-ball look.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Records double-double in loss\n\nHoward recorded 16 points (6-10 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 3-4 FT), 12 rebounds, one assist, one block and one steal across 25 minutes during Thursday's 128-112 loss to the Warriors. None of LeBron James (ankle), Anthony Davis (foot), Russell Westbrook (shoulder) or Carmelo Anthony (illness) played for the Lakers on Thursday, but Howard continued his late-season surge in playing time by starting for the 11th time in the Lakers' past 12 contests. He recorded his second double-double in five games and led all players with 12 boards in the loss. Howard is averaging 12.2 points and 8.6 boards over the five-game stretch.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Shines with 21 points, 12 boards\n\nHoward ended with 21 points (9-13 FG, 1-1 3Pt, 2-3 FT), 12 rebounds and one steal across 30 minutes during Thursday's 122-109 loss to Utah. Howard needed to step up in the absence of LeBron James (ankle) and Anthony Davis (foot), and he came through with his first double-double since late February. The veteran center even converted his first three-pointer since Dec. 9. Howard has posted two performances of 20-plus points over his past four games, but he combined for just eight points in the other two contests over that span. With Davis expected to return Friday, Howard could see his playing time drop after logging at least 24 minutes in four of his last six appearances.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Available, starting Tuesday\n\nHoward (hip) will start Tuesday's game against Dallas, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports. Howard was probable coming in, and he'll ultimately make his fifth straight start at center. The veteran is coming off of an eight-point, 10-rebound effort in 33 minutes -- his second-highest total of the season -- Sunday against the Pels.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Likely available Tuesday\n\nHoward (hip) is probable for Tuesday's contest against Dallas, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports. Howard suffered a hip injury during Wednesday's loss to the Sixers, but the big man was still able to suit up Sunday, totaling eight points and 10 boards. Barring a setback, Howard will likely be back in the starting lineup against the Mavericks.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Cleared to play, will start\n\nHoward (hip) will start Sunday's game against the Pelicans, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports. Howard emerged from Wednesday's loss to the Sixers with a sore hip, but he'll push through it and make his fifth straight start at center. In that loss, Howard had one of his best games of the season, finishing with 24 points, eight rebounds, one assist, one steal and one block in 28 minutes -- his second-highest workload in any game this season.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Questionable against New Orleans\n\nHoward is questionable for Sunday's game against the Pelicans due to hip soreness, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports. Howard posted 24 points in Wednesday's loss to Philadelphia and came within two rebounds of a double-double, but he apparently hurt his hip in the matchup. If he's unavailable Sunday, Wenyen Gabriel and Carmelo Anthony should see additional run.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Turns back clock with 24 points\n\nHoward ended with 24 points (9-14 FG, 6-9 FT), eight rebounds, one assist, one block and one steal over 28 minutes during Wednesday's 126-121 loss to the 76ers. Howard registered his highest scoring output of the season, surpassing the 14-point total he had previously posted on two separate occasions. The veteran center also logged his second-most playing time of the campaign, and he finished with his highest rebound total since Feb. 27. Howard has started each of the last four contests in which he has played, but he logged less than 20 minutes in two of those games and finished with a DNP-CD on Saturday. The inconsistent playing time makes him difficult to roster in most fantasy formats.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Back in starting lineup\n\nHoward will start Monday's game against the Cavaliers, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports. The Lakers will play the matchup game and go with a traditional big man to combat the Cavaliers' Evan Mobley. Howard was a DNP-CD during Saturday night's 127-119 loss to the Wizards.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Coming off bench Saturday\n\nHoward will come off the bench Saturday against the Wizards, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports. Howard heads back to the bench following two spot starts. It's not a guarantee he cracks the rotation.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Blocks two shots in spot start\n\nHoward finished Wednesday's 124-104 loss to the Timberwolves with two points (0-2 FG, 2-2 FT), six rebounds, one assist and two blocks over 16 minutes. Howard salvaged what was a disappointing night by blocking two shots, highlighting just where he sits now in terms of fantasy value. He has barely seen the court over the past two weeks, playing in just four of the last eight games. During his time on the court, he is doing nothing more than providing some very limited streaming appeal, and even that is putting it nicely.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Starting Wednesday\n\nHoward will start in Wednesday's game against the Timberwolves, Ryan Ward of LakersNation.com reports. Howard was sidelined for Monday's loss to the Raptors due to a personal matter, but he's back in the starting lineup Wednesday after coming off the bench in his last appearance. The veteran big man is averaging 5.2 points and 5.6 rebounds in 14.8 minutes per game this season.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Will be available\n\nHoward will play Wednesday against the Timberwolves, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports. Howard missed the Lakers' latest blowout loss Monday against Toronto due to a personal matter, but he's rejoined the team and will be available for coach Frank Vogel. Howard's role has been all over the map since the All-Star break, but he's not a consideration in the vast majority of fantasy leagues.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Expected to be available Wednesday\n\nHoward (personal) is not listed on the injury report ahead of Wednesday's matchup with the Timberwolves, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports. Howard was sidelined for Monday's loss to the Raptors due to a family emergency, but he'll presumably be back in the mix Wednesday. He's appeared in just four of the Lakers' eight games in March and has averaged just 13.8 minutes per game during that stretch.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Unavailable Monday\n\nHoward has been ruled out for Monday's game against the Raptors due to a personal matter, Bill Oram of The Athletic reports. Howard is currently away from the team attending to a family emergency, per Oram. Wenyen Gabriel figured to be leaned on more heavily at center as a result.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Shifts back to bench\n\nHoward will come off the bench for Wednesday's game against the Rockets, Mike Trudell of the Lakers' official site reports. With LeBron James (knee) set to rejoin the lineup after a one-game absence, Howard will return to a bench role. The veteran big man is averaging 5.3 points and 5.6 rebounds in 14.8 minutes per game this season.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Back in starting five\n\nHoward is starting Monday's game against San Antonio, Dan Woike of the Los Angeles Times reports. Howard failed to appear off the bench in his team's last game against the Warriors on Saturday, but he should be in line for a sizeable workload Monday with LeBron James (knee) out. Howard has been held under 10 points in five of his last six games.\n\n... See More ... See Less\n\nLakers' Dwight Howard: Back to bench\n\nHoward will come off the bench Saturday against the Warriors, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports. LeBron James will get the nod at center Saturday. As a reserve, Howard is averaging 5.3 points and 5.4 rebounds in 13.3 minutes.\n\n... See More ... See Less"
