        "text": "ORLANDO - Two years ago following their NBA Finals loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Orlando Magic looked like a team on the brink.\n\nWith center Dwight Howard quickly emerging as one of the NBA's biggest talents, it seemed like the Magic needed just some minor tweaking to hoist their first NBA title.\n\n\"We won 59 games two years in a row,\" Magic guard J.J. Redick recalled recently. \"The year before that we only won 52 games, but we won or tied the season series with every team in the NBA. So we were a team that was very competitive.\"\n\nBut two seasons later, the team that in the last four seasons trails only the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers in regular season wins may need a miracle just to keep the guy most responsible for that run from leaving town.\n\nHoward's preseason request to be traded not only has dominated the Magic's shortened regular season preparations, but will certainly nag them until the situation is resolved. If he stays the Magic could be a threat this season, while his departure could usher in the first of several rebuilding seasons.\n\nHoward has said that if certain roster moves could be engineered, his preference would be to remain in Orlando. Though, he is adamant his trade request stands entering the season.\n\n\"The back and forth for me is based on the people here, the talent's that's here,\" he said. \"I'm at peace (with the trade request), but I know a lot of other people are gonna be upset and not at peace with it. I've gotten every message you can think of, from Twitter to Facebook, to this and that and I'm this kind of guy.\n\n\"But nothing has changed me. I've been the same person from Day 1 since I've been in the NBA.\"\n\nAnd that stated goal since the Magic selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 draft has been to win a championship.\n\nMagic general manager Otis Smith has given Howard's agent, Dan Fegan, permission to explore potential trades with Dallas, New Jersey and the Los Angeles. But Smith said recently that any trade discussions involving Howard could go until the end of the season.\n\n\"Like I said before, the Orlando Magic franchise is what it's about,\" Smith said. \"We like to make this into an individual game, but the fact of the matter is it's a team sport. And we'll continue to move forward.\n\n\"...Anytime you lose one of your best players it's a huge loss. But it's not new to anyone who's in our league or professional sports. Anytime you lose the best player on your team you have to adjust to that.\""
