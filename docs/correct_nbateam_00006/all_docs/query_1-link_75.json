        "text": "In his second stint with the Los Angeles Lakers, he won the title in 2020. Afterward, he joined the Philadelphia 76ers before returning to California. This marked his last engagement in the strongest league in the world. Following that, he went to play in Taiwan, where he spent the previous season.\n\nThere has been speculation for a long time about Dwight Howard possibly coming to Europe, and it has finally happened. However, few expected his choice to be Palencia, considering the team has only secured one victory and suffered 13 defeats so far."
