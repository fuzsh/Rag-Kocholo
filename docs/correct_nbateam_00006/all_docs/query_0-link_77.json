        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — The Orlando Magic probably would like to erase the bulk of the 2010s from their collective memory.\n\nA decade that started with two dizzying highs, a 59-win regular season in 2009-10 and the opening of Amway Center in 2010, quickly unraveled into a painful, prolonged drought. Following the trade of superstar Dwight Howard in 2012, the franchise and its fans endured six consecutive losing seasons without a playoff appearance. Only recently have the Magic shown signs, however fleeting, of NBA relevance.\n\nThis makes selecting the Magic’s All-Decade Team of the 2010s a difficult exercise. The easy way out would be to take the starting five of Jameer Nelson, Vince Carter, Matt Barnes, Rashard Lewis and Howard from the Magic’s 2009-10 team — one of the four best teams in franchise history — and be done with it.\n\nBut as strong as that team was, as well as it fit together, earning a spot in the Eastern Conference finals, it doesn’t accurately represent the Magic’s decade. Most of the decade was messy and ugly, epitomized by the acrimonious Dwightmare, repeated NBA Draft Lottery trips, the sudden resignation of coach Scott Skiles, the disastrous trade for Serge Ibaka, the notorious Whiteboard Incident and the sight of Tobias Harris and Victor Oladipo flourishing with other teams.\n\nBefore we get started, let’s set the criteria for selecting the Magic’s All-Decade Team of the 2010s:\n\n• The team must resemble a regular-season roster. It must include a maximum of 15 players. It also should be balanced positionally, with three point guards and three centers. In putting together a starting lineup, positional overlap will be avoided; so even if Orlando’s two best players of the last decade are centers — hint! hint! — only one of those centers can start.\n\n• Only players’ performances since Jan. 1, 2010, can be considered. In other words, we are excluding the first 31 games of the 2009-10 season because those games were played before the decade began. This decision essentially splits some key players’ Magic careers in two. For example, the strong start to Rashard Lewis’ tenure, a period spanning roughly 2 1/2 seasons, can’t be considered here.\n\n• To be selected, a player must have played at least 82 regular-season games for Orlando during the decade. For instance, this eliminates Marcin Gortat, who appeared in a total of 76 regular-season games for the Magic from Jan. 1, 2010, until he was traded on Dec. 18, 2010. It also excludes Matt Barnes (50 games), Vince Carter (72 games) and Lewis (76 games) from consideration.\n\n• Players are being evaluated based on their Magic tenures alone. To cite another example, when Victor Oladipo is considered, only his three seasons with Orlando matter. His vastly improved play with the Indiana Pacers during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons don’t count.\n\n• In picking a starting lineup, the goal is to create a quintet that meshes well together, not necessarily to reward the players who had the best statistics during the 2010s.\n\nThe starting five\n\nShooting rules in the modern NBA. The best teams prioritize the 3-point shot and floor spacing, and that’s the case here. This quintet employs the four-out, one-in model the Magic relied on so effectively during the early part of the decade under coach Stan Van Gundy and GM Otis Smith.\n\nPoint guard: Jameer Nelson\n\nOver his final 4 1/2 seasons with the Magic, Nelson averaged a relatively modest 12.9 points and 6.4 assists per game. But he also made 36.6 percent of his 3-pointers, and likely would’ve made a higher percentage if the team had spaced the floor better during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 rebuilding years. He also led the franchise in total assists during the decade, with 1,951.\n\nShooting guard: Evan Fournier\n\nMany Magic fans, still ticked off about Fournier’s struggles during the 2019 postseason, will howl when they read this selection. Indeed, this was a tough call. Arron Afflalo, Victor Oladipo, J.J. Redick and Terrence Ross also received consideration here, and strong arguments can be made for each of them. Fournier has an edge over Redick as a defender, a strong edge over Oladipo as a 3-point shooter and more longevity with the Magic than Afflalo. And Ross has been at his best coming off the bench. Fournier led the Magic in points per game during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons and leads the 2019-20 Magic in the same category. He also has made 37.4 percent of his 3s during his Magic tenure.\n\nSmall forward: Hedo Turkoglu\n\nThis was another excruciating decision. Let’s not mince words: Turkoglu was well past his prime after he returned to the Magic via a trade midway through the 2010-11 season. He’s also far less athletic than two other candidates for this spot, Aaron Gordon and Tobias Harris. But again, we’re prioritizing 3-point shooting and floor spacing here. Turkoglu made 36.0 percent of his 3s for Orlando during his second stint with the franchise; that’s not particularly impressive, but it’s better than Gordon (31.9 percent) or Harris (32.0 percent).\n\nPower forward: Ryan Anderson\n\nAnderson receives the nod here because he, like Turkoglu, would allow the starting five to play four-out, one-in. Anderson made 38.9 percent of his 3s in the 2010s for Orlando and won the 2011-12 NBA Most Improved Player award. He also was an underrated rebounder.\n\nCenter: Dwight Howard\n\nNikola Vucevic, another center, earned The Athletic’s nod as the Magic’s Player of the Decade for his production over many seasons. But Howard dominated during the early 2010s. Howard led the franchise during the decade in points per game (21.1), rebounds per game (14.0) and blocks per game (2.5). He won his final two NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards in 2010 and 2011; when he was healthy, before his 2012 back surgery, he was one of the best defensive bigs the league had ever seen. That’s why this starting lineup includes subpar defenders such as Nelson, Turkoglu and Anderson: The early-2010s Howard would have cleaned up any defensive messes they left behind. He was that good.\n\nThe bench\n\nCenter Nikola Vucevic (sixth man)\n\nVucevic’s stats speak for themselves. During the 2010s, he has scored more points (8,500) and collected more rebounds (5,419) than any other Magic player. He is one of the best passing centers in the league today.\n\nShooting guard Arron Afflalo\n\nAfflalo enjoyed his first stint in Orlando because it allowed him to take a featured role in the offense. Over the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons, he averaged 17.0 points per game and sank 37.0 percent of his 3s. He was a solid, dependable pro.\n\nPoint guard D.J. Augustin\n\nAugustin posted career years during the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons and hit the critical go-ahead shot in the Magic’s upset victory over the Toronto Raptors in Game 1 of their 2019 first-round playoff series. Augustin has made 39.0 percent of his 3s during his Magic tenure and is a strong pick-and-roll player, which would have made him effective playing alongside Howard. Howard would’ve covered up Augustin’s defensive deficiencies.\n\nCombo forward Aaron Gordon\n\nGordon can defend, rebound and cut to the hoop, and those qualities alone make him valuable. He’s a tough competitor. The fourth overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, he is the only remaining player on the Magic’s current roster who was drafted by former GM Rob Hennigan. Gordon is one of the players who defined the franchise’s decade.\n\nCombo forward Tobias Harris\n\nHarris averaged 15.6 points and 7.0 boards during his four Magic seasons, but as with Oladipo, the team traded Harris away before he could fulfill his potential. On the Magic’s All-Decade Team, Harris would fill the role of providing instant offense.\n\nCombo forward Jonathan Isaac\n\nIsaac has been a defensive standout during his 2 1/2 seasons with the Magic. On this team, with Gortat ineligible because of his relatively short Orlando tenure during the 2010s, Isaac also would fill the role of third-string center.\n\nShooting guard Victor Oladipo\n\nIn hindsight, the decision in 2016 to trade Oladipo, Ersan Ilyasova and the draft rights to Domantas Sabonis to Oklahoma City for Serge Ibaka was one of the worst moves of the decade. At the time, however, Oladipo was one year away from hitting restricted free agency, and Fournier was a better outside shooter. Still, Oladipo’s speed, defense and all-out grit earn him a spot on this team.\n\nPoint guard Elfrid Payton\n\nPayton piled up high assist numbers and eight triple-doubles during his Magic tenure, but his subpar 3-point shooting and subpar defense prompted the team to trade him in early 2018. This team needs a third point guard to back up Nelson and Augustin, and Payton is the most logical choice.\n\nShooting guard J.J. Redick\n\nA fan favorite, Redick hadn’t hit his prime when the Magic traded him, Gustavo Ayón and Ish Smith at the 2013 trade deadline to Milwaukee for Tobias Harris, Doron Lamb, Beno Udrih and cash. Still, Redick made 39.9 percent of his 3s for Orlando during the 2010s.\n\nShooting guard Terrence Ross\n\nThe 2018-19 Magic wouldn’t have made the playoffs if not for Ross’ heroics off the bench. He logged 16 games of 20-29 points and four games of 30-39 points. On the Magic’s All-Decade team, he would receive many more open looks than he received in 2018-19.\n\n(Top photo of Dwight Howard: Kim Klement / USA Today)"
