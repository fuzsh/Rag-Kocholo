Just going off accolades alone it is clear that he belongs in the Hall of Fame. The casual NBA fan has a tendency to just look at what the media says and formulate their opinions based off that. There was a point in time in Dwight Howard’s career in which he was the best center in the NBA, and top 3 player in the league. People tend to forget this because he has some “unlikable” characteristics.\n\nLet’s get right into the accolades. Howard is an 8 time NBA All-Star, a 5 time All-NBA First Team, 3 time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, 4 time NBA All-Defensive First Team, a 5 time NBA rebounding leader, and a 2 NBA blocks leader. He also consistently lead him team to the playoffs, and beat LeBron James and the Cavs to reach the Finals.\n\nDuring his 8 All-Star seasons Howard averaged about 20 points a game, 13 rebounds a game, 1 and a half assists, 2 and a half blocks, 1 steal, and shot 60 percent from the field. Are you seriously telling me that with this resume right here that he’s not deserving of a Hall of Fame induction?\n\nKeep in mind that the Basketball Hall of Fame is probably the easiest professional U.S. Hall of Fame in which one can be inducted. There are far too many players in the Basketball Hall of Fame…"
