        "text": "UPDATE: Dwight Howard announced an update on X.\n\nHoward wrote on March 9: \"I love Puerto Rico and the fans üáµüá∑ I just wanted to clarify to the media because multiple platforms reported that I signed already before first confirming with me. The misleading news has to stop. Until then I‚Äôm still keeping the BSN at heart ‚ù§Ô∏è #boricua\"\n\nDwight Howard most recently played in the NBA during the 2021-22 season when he appeared in 60 games (27 starts) for the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThat year, Howard was a solid role player and averaged 6.2 points and 5.9 rebounds per contest while shooting 61.2% from the field.\n\nOn Friday, Mets de Guaynabo (a team in Puerto Rico) announced that Howard had joined the team (h/t Alberto De Roa of HoopsHype).\n\nVia Their Instagram Page: \"Welcome to Puerto Rico @dwighthoward üáµüá∑üî•\"\n\nLast season, the eight-time NBA All-Star played in Taiwan, and earlier this year, he had a stint with a team in the Philippines.\n\nHoward was the first pick in the 2004 NBA Draft (out of high school) and has played 18 years in the league.\n\nIn addition to the Lakers, he has also spent time with the Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets, Charlotte Hornets, Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards.\n\nHis career averages are 15.7 points, 11.8 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.8 blocks per contest while shooting 58.7% from the field in 1,242 regular season games.\n\nHoward has also appeared in 125 playoff games (102 starts) and helped the Lakers win the 2020 NBA Championship over the Miami Heat.\n\nWhile Howard is 38, there is still a possibility that he could return to the NBA, as he has proven that he is capable of being a backup center on a contender.\n\nHe is a three-time Defensive Player of The Year and will likely make the Hall of Fame one day."
