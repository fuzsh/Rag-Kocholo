        "text": "By Johnny Askounis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nEntering the offseason, NBA teams can consider veteran players, including Dwight Howard.\n\nHoward, 37, spent the 2022-23 season in Taiwan’s T1 League. He averaged 23.2 points, 16.2 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.2 blocks, and 0.5 steals per game over 20 appearances with the Taoyuan Leopards. His side finished last among six teams.\n\nStepping away from the NBA after 18 consecutive campaigns and moving his talents to a growing but minor league in Asia was a brave decision. Earning a contract with an NBA team would probably be even more impressive at this point of his career.\n\n“I do enjoy playing international basketball, just the experience is one of a kind. It’s a different type of grind than being in the NBA, and I had a chance to experience it,” he said in an interview with Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium on FanDuelTV, “But I would love to finish off my career with an NBA team. Hopefully, win an NBA championship.”\n\nYet to make a decision on his own future, Howard has actually been humorously recruiting NBA players to join him in Taiwan over recent weeks. However, wrapping up his career in the NBA is his real desire. “I’ve enjoyed playing basketball for so long, and I’m just thankful that I’ve had the opportunity to travel and play in the NBA,” added the experienced center acknowledging the possibility of missing out on one last opportunity.\n\nBack in 2004, he was selected with the first overall pick of the draft by the Orlando Magic. His brilliant career stretched to the Los Angeles Lakers and the 2020 championship with additional stops at the Houston Rockets, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Washington Wizards, and Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images"
