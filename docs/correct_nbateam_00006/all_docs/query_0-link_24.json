        "text": "Associated Press\n\nORLANDO - Dwight Howard scored a season-high 39 points, had 16 rebounds and was sent to the free throw line 39 times by his former team as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Orlando Magic, 106-97 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe victory came in Howard's first return to Orlando since his drama-filled offseason trade to the Lakers. He endured a chorus of boos throughout, and tied his own NBA record for free throw attempts.\n\nThe majority of them came as the Magic tried to employ an intentional foul strategy. It backfired, though, as the All-Star center hit on 16 of 20 attempts in the second half.\n\nThe victory was the Lakers' fourth in a row.\n\nJameer Nelson led Orlando with 21 points. The Magic have lost three of their last four and haven't won back-to-back games since December.\n\nAfter a week of back-and-forth in the media following some perceived negative comments made about his former team during a television interview, Howard and Nelson spoke briefly just after the final buzzer and shook hands.\n\nIt was a light moment in what was mostly a hostile atmosphere.\n\nHomemade signs jeering Howard with sentiments that said everything from \"Coward\" to \"Kobe's Kid\" were sprinkled throughout the Amway Center stands.\n\nBoos rained down on the All-Star center almost every time he touched the basketball.\n\nThe intensity was also ramped up at times, too.\n\nHoward got tangled up in a verbal back-and-forth with the Magic bench at one point during the first half, and Kobe Bryant left briefly, bleeding from his right eye after a collision."
