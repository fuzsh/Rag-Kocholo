Sometimes, however, an investigator will be unable to readily determine whether a particular threshold requirement has been met without additional investigation. If a charge does not satisfy threshold requirements, it should be dismissed.(5) Where satisfaction of a particular requirement is a close question, the charge should be taken and processed.\n\nWhile the principles discussed in this Section apply in most jurisdictions, a few may be inconsistent with the law in a particular jurisdiction.(6) The investigator should consult with the legal unit if applicable case law differs from the Commission's position on a particular issue.\n\n2-II COGNIZABLE CLAIMS\n\nA charge filed with the Commission must present a claim that is cognizable under the laws enforced by the Commission. Specifically, the charge must allege a basis and an issue covered by the EEO statutes.\n\nA. Covered Bases\n\nA charge must allege that an individual was subjected to employment discrimination based on his/her membership in one or more of the following protected categories:\n\nThe following issues can arise under any of the bases:(7)\n\nDiscrimination by a Member of the Same Protected Class: The EEO statutes prohibit a member of a protected class from discriminating against another member of the same protected class. For example, Title VII prohibits a male supervisor from sexually harassing his male subordinates on the basis of sex.(8)\n\nDiscrimination Against a Subclass: The EEO statutes prohibit discrimination against a subclass of a particular protected group. For example, an employer cannot refuse to hire women with preschool age children if it hires men with preschool age children.(9)\n\nIntersectional Discrimination: The EEO statutes prohibit discrimination against an individual based on his/her membership in two or more protected classes. For example, Title VII prohibits discrimination against African-American males even if an employer does not discriminate against white males or African-American females.(10) Similarly, intersectional discrimination can involve more than one EEO statute, e.g., discrimination based on age and disability, or based on sex and age.(11)\n\nStereotype: Discrimination on a protected basis includes discrimination because of stereotypical assumptions about members of the protected class. For example, discrimination against a woman because she is perceived as \"too aggressive\" or because she uses profanity, which is seen as \"unfeminine,\" is a form of sex discrimination.(12)\n\n1. Title VII\n\nTitle VII prohibits employment discrimination against any individual on the basis of his/her race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. Thus, for example, the statute protects Whites, African-Americans, and Asians from race and color discrimination; men and women from sex discrimination; Iranians, Cubans, and Americans from national origin discrimination; and Christians, Jews, Muslims, and atheists from religious discrimination. The following sections describe some specific kinds of charges that can be raised under the Title VII bases.(13)\n\na. Race and Color\n\nTitle VII prohibits both race and color discrimination. Courts, however, do not always distinguish them.(14) Consequently, an investigator generally need not determine whether an adverse action was based on race or on color as long as the charging party alleges one or the other, or both.(15)\n\nPhysical characteristics: Race discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of physical characteristics associated with a particular race, even where the charging party and the alleged discriminator are members of the same race. For example, Title VII prohibits discrimination against an Asian individual because of physical characteristics, e.g., facial features or height.(16)\n\nSkin color: Race/color discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of shade of skin color. For example, it would be unlawful for an employer to discriminate against dark- or light-skinned African-Americans.(17)\n\nAssociation with a protected individual: Title VII prohibits discrimination against an individual because of his/her association with another individual of a particular race or color. For example, it is unlawful to take an adverse employment action against a white employee because s/he is married to an individual who is Native American or because s/he has a mixed-race child.(18)\n\nb. National Origin\n\nNational origin discrimination includes discrimination based on place of origin or on the physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics of a national origin group. Sometimes, national origin discrimination overlaps with race discrimination, and in such cases, the basis of discrimination can be categorized as both race and national origin. For example, discrimination against a Native American may be race and/or national origin discrimination.(19)\n\nAccent/Language: National origin discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of accent, manner of speaking, or language fluency.(20) It also applies to rules requiring employees to speak only English in the workplace.(21)\n\nMultilingualism: National origin discrimination may include requiring multilingual employees to perform more work than unilingual colleagues without additional compensation.\n\nCitizenship: The EEO statutes protect all employees who work in the United States for covered employers,(22) regardless of citizenship status or work authorization.(23) In addition, discrimination based on citizenship violates Title VII's prohibition on national origin discrimination if it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of national origin.(24)\n\nAssociation with a protected individual: National origin discrimination includes discrimination based on an individual's association with someone of a national origin group. Thus, for example, it would be unlawful to discriminate against an individual because s/he is married to someone of Middle Eastern origin.\n\nNational security: Employment decisions based on national security considerations, including security clearance determinations, are subject to limited review under the EEO statutes. See § 2-III B.4.b.iv, below.\n\nFor further discussion of national origin discrimination, refer to the Commission's \"Guidelines on Discrimination Because of National Origin,\" 29 C.F.R. Part 1606.\n\nc. Religion\n\nThe Commission defines \"religion\" to include moral or ethical beliefs as to right and wrong that are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views.(25) This broad coverage ensures that individuals are protected against religious discrimination regardless of how widespread their particular religious beliefs or practices are. It also ensures that the Commission will not have to determine what is or is not a religion, something which it would be inappropriate for the government to do. Religious discrimination also includes discrimination against someone because s/he is an atheist.(26)\n\nReasonable accommodation: Title VII requires a covered entity to provide reasonable accommodations for an individual's religious practices, such as leave to observe religious holidays, unless doing so would cause an undue hardship.(27)\n\nAssociation with a protected individual: Title VII prohibits discrimination against an individual because s/he is associated with another person of a particular religion. For example, it would be unlawful to discriminate against a Christian because s/he is married to a Muslim.\n\nFor further discussion of religious discrimination, refer to the Commission's \"Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Religion,\" 29 C.F.R. Part 1605.\n\nd. Sex\n\nTitle VII prohibits discrimination based on sex, including both sexual harassment, where the prohibited conduct is sexual in nature,(28) and sex-based harassment that is not of a sexual nature, sometimes called gender-based harassment.\n\nExample 1 - CP alleges that her supervisor made frequent derogatory comments about women and referred to female employees as \"girls.\" CP has alleged discrimination based on sex covered by Title VII.\n\nExample 2 - CP alleges that her supervisor refused to promote her because she refused to engage in sexual relations with him. CP has alleged discrimination based on sex covered by Title VII.\n\nPregnancy: Discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination because of pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions. For example, an employer must provide leave and benefits for women affected by pregnancy and childbirth on the same terms as it does for other individuals similarly unable to work.\n\nFor further discussion of sex discrimination, refer to the Commission's \"Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Sex,\" 29 C.F.R. Part 1604.\n\n2. EPA\n\nThe EPA prohibits compensation discrimination based on sex.(29) It protects both men and women. If a charge alleges compensation discrimination based on sex, the investigator should treat it as alleging a violation under both Title VII and the EPA, subject to statutory requirements such as timeliness. For a more detailed discussion of compensation discrimination covered by the EPA, refer to 29 C.F.R. Part 1620.\n\n3. ADEA\n\nThe ADEA prohibits age discrimination against individuals 40 years of age or older.\n\nIntra-class discrimination: The ADEA prohibits discrimination between individuals in the protected group as well as between individuals inside and outside the protected group. Thus, a 55-year-old can allege an ADEA violation where he is replaced by a 48-year-old.(30)\n\nIndividuals under 40: The ADEA does not protect persons under age 40 from age discrimination; however, they are protected from retaliation for engaging in protected activity. See § 2-II A.5, below.\n\nYears of service: An employment action based solely on an individual's years of service constitutes disparate treatment under the ADEA where years of service is a proxy for age.(31) Such an action may also be unlawful if it has a disparate impact based on age.(32)\n\nFor a more detailed discussion of age discrimination, refer to 29 C.F.R. Part 1625.\n\n4. ADA\n\na. Generally\n\nIn most circumstances, the ADA only prohibits employment discrimination against a \"qualified individual with a disability.\"(33) Unlike Title VII and the ADEA, under which the charging party's status as a member of a protected group is seldom in doubt, coverage is frequently a significant issue in ADA cases. In such cases, it is necessary to determine whether the individual has a disability and is also qualified.\n\nSome investigation may be required before it can be determined whether an individual is a qualified individual with a disability. When the investigator is uncertain about whether an individual is covered, the charge should be taken and the issue investigated.\n\nMitigating measures: The determination of whether a person has a disability must take into consideration whether the person is substantially limited in a major life activity when using a mitigating measure, such as medication, a prosthesis, or a hearing aid.(34) Both the benefits and the harmful effects of the mitigating measure should be considered.(35)\n\nQualification standards: A qualification standard that screens out or tends to screen out an otherwise qualified individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities is prohibited unless the employer shows that it is job-related and consistent with business necessity.(36)\n\nReasonable accommodation: The ADA requires a covered entity to provide reasonable accommodation for an individual's known physical or mental limitations unless doing so would cause an undue hardship.(37)\n\nFor detailed discussion of how to assess coverage, refer to the Commission's \"Instructions to EEOC Field Offices on Analyzing ADA Charges After Supreme Court Decisions Addressing 'Disability' and 'Qualified'\" (1999); \"Regulations to Implement the Equal Employment Provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\" 29 C.F.R. Part 1630; and Section 902: Definition of the Term \"Disability\", EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II (1995) (all available at www.eeoc.gov).\n\nb. Protection of an Individual Who Is Not a Qualified Individual with a Disability\n\nIn some circumstances, the ADA protects someone who is not a qualified individual with a disability. These include:\n\nMedical examinations and inquiries: The ADA's restrictions on medical examinations and inquiries apply regardless of whether an individual has a disability.(38) See § 2-II B.8, below.\n\nConfidentiality: The ADA's provisions regarding maintenance and confidentiality of medical records apply regardless of whether an individual has a disability.(39) See § 2-II B.9, below.\n\nAssociation: The ADA prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual because of his/her association with a person with a disability. For example, an employer may not refuse to hire someone who is qualified, but does not have a disability, because she has a child with a disability.\n\nRetaliation: The ADA prohibits retaliation against any individual who has engaged in protected activity. See § 2-II A.5, below.\n\n5. All Statutes: Retaliation\n\nThe EEO statutes prohibit retaliation against an individual because s/he has engaged in protected activity, which includes either:(40)\n\nProtected activity also includes testifying or presenting evidence as part of an internal investigation pertaining to an alleged EEO violation.(41)\n\nAn individual is protected from retaliation for opposition to discrimination as long as s/he had a reasonable and good faith belief that s/he was opposing an unlawful discriminatory practice, and the manner of opposition was reasonable. An individual is protected against retaliation for participation in the charge process, however, regardless of the validity or reasonableness of the original allegation of discrimination.\n\nAn individual need not establish a violation of the underlying statute to be afforded protection from retaliation. For detailed guidance on the determination of whether an individual has engaged in protected activity, refer to Section 8: Retaliation, EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II (BNA) §§ 8-II B, 8-II C, 614:0001-0004 (1998).\n\nRetaliation against individuals not members of the protected class subjected to discrimination: A charging party alleging retaliation need not be a member of the protected class that was subjected to the underlying discrimination. Thus, a white individual may allege that he was retaliated against for opposing discrimination against African-Americans; a 25-year-old may allege retaliation for testifying on behalf of an ADEA claim filed by a fellow employee;(42) and an individual who is not disabled and/or qualified may allege that he was subjected to retaliation for filing a prior charge alleging that he was unlawfully denied a reasonable accommodation.(43)\n\nAssociation with a protected individual: The EEO statutes also prohibit discrimination against someone closely related to or associated with an individual who has engaged in protected activity. For instance, an employer may not retaliate against an employee whose spouse or friend has engaged in protected activity by firing the employee.(44)\n\nADA coverage of retaliation for opposition to any violation of the statute: The ADA prohibits retaliation against an individual for opposition to any violation of the statute, not just employment discrimination. This includes opposition to discrimination in state and local government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and telecommunications.(45)\n\nB. Covered Issues\n\nThe investigator must determine whether a charge alleges discrimination pertaining to an issue covered by the EEO statutes. The range of issues covered by the EEO laws is very broad, and covers any matter related to an individual's employment. Covered issues include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nCOVERED ISSUES\n\nJob decisions, employment practices, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment\n\nHarassment based on a protected basis\n\nReasonable accommodation\n\nReferral practices\n\nLabor organization practices\n\nPractices undertaken by apprenticeships and other training programs\n\nAdvertising and recruitment\n\nMedical inquiries and examinations\n\nMaintenance and confidentiality of medical records\n\nLimiting, segregating, and classifying\n\nRetaliation: Actions likely to deter protected activity\n\n1. Job Decisions, Employment Practices, and Other Terms, Conditions, and Privileges of Employment\n\nEEOC's coverage in this area is broad. Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA prohibit discrimination related to job decisions, employment practices, or other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment(46) based on an individual's protected status or, in some circumstances, an individual's relationship to a protected individual.(47) In addition, the EPA prohibits compensation discrimination based on sex.(48)\n\nSpecific issues of this type that a charging party may raise include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFailure to hire\n\nTermination\n\nDenial of promotion\n\nUndesirable reassignment\n\nAwards\n\nLeave\n\nCompensation\n\nBenefits\n\nTraining\n\nWork assignments\n\n2. Harassment Based on a Protected Basis\n\nA charging party may allege harassment based on any of the protected bases.(49) Harassment that results in a tangible employment action or is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment will establish an actionable claim under the EEO statutes.(50) For a discussion of this standard, refer to the Commission's Enforcement Guidance on Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc. (1994) (available at www.eeoc.gov). See also Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors (1999) (available at www.eeoc.gov).\n\n3. Reasonable Accommodation\n\na. Religion\n\nA charging party may allege that a reasonable accommodation was denied by a covered entity for a religious observance or practice. A covered entity is required to provide a reasonable accommodation unless it can show that doing so would impose an undue hardship. A covered entity will be able to establish undue hardship if it can show that the accommodation would require more than a de minimis burden. The standard for reasonable accommodation and undue hardship for disability accommodation is different from the standard for religious accommodation. For more guidance on religious accommodation, refer to 29 C.F.R. § 1605.2.\n\nb. Disability\n\nA charging party may also allege that a reasonable accommodation was denied by a covered entity for the known mental or physical limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability. A covered entity is required to provide a reasonable accommodation unless it can show that doing so would impose an undue hardship. Undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. The standard for reasonable accommodation and undue hardship for disability accommodation is different from the standard for religious accommodation. For more guidance on this issue, refer to Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (1999) (available at www.eeoc.gov).\n\n4. Referral Practices\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA prohibit discriminatory employment referral practices by any covered entity, including employers, employment agencies, and unions.\n\n5. Labor Organization Practices\n\nThe EEO statutes prohibit discrimination in labor organization practices, including referrals. In addition, a labor organization is prohibited from refusing to bring a grievance because of an individual's protected status,(51) or because the grievance alleges discrimination.(52)\n\n6. Practices Undertaken by Apprenticeships and Other Training Programs\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA prohibit discrimination with respect to admission to or employment in an apprenticeship or other job training program.(53) A covered entity may not discriminate with respect to an apprenticeship or other training program, regardless of whether the program is the product of an employment relationship.(54) Thus, if two individuals are sexually harassed while participating in the respondent's training program but only one of them is the respondent's employee, they can both file a Title VII charge against the respondent. Discrimination in training programs might also constitute discrimination in hiring if participation in the program is required prior to employment, or regularly leads to employment.(55)\n\n7. Advertising and Recruitment\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA prohibit discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, age, or disability in advertisements and recruitment related to employment, referral for employment, or apprenticeships or other training.(56) Advertisements also may not contain terms or phrases that would deter members of a particular class from applying. For example, a help-wanted advertisement that uses terms such as \"young,\" \"college student,\" or \"recent college graduate\" may deter individuals 40 or over from applying, and therefore would violate the ADEA.(57)\n\n8. Medical Inquiries and Examinations\n\nThe ADA prohibits a covered entity from conducting a pre-offer medical examination or making pre-offer inquiries as to whether an applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of a disability.(58) However, a covered entity may make pre-offer inquiries about an individual's ability to perform the essential functions of the position in question. After it has extended a conditional offer, the entity may ask disability-related questions, or require a medical examination as long as it does so of all entering employees in the same job category, regardless of disability. If the questions or examination screens out the individual based on disability, the entity must show that the reason for doing so is job-related and consistent with business necessity. A covered entity is also prohibited from requiring a medical examination or making a disability-related inquiry of an employee, unless the examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. These prohibitions protect an individual regardless of whether s/he is a qualified individual with a disability.(59)\n\n9. Maintenance and Confidentiality of Medical Records\n\nThe ADA requires that medical records be maintained separately and treated as confidential except under narrow circumstances, including informing a supervisor about a necessary restriction or accommodation. These prohibitions protect an individual regardless of whether s/he is a qualified individual with a disability.(60)\n\n10. Limiting, Segregating, and Classifying\n\nThe EEO statutes prohibit limiting, segregating, or classifying a job applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of the individual because of his/her protected status.(61) Thus, for example, an employer may not provide segregated or unequal facilities.(62) It is also unlawful to have separate job classifications based on a protected category or to \"channel\" individuals of a certain protected class into particular jobs or career paths. For example, an employer may not have one job category for men and a separate job category for women who are performing the same work;(63) nor may an employer channel women, minorities, or individuals with disabilities into lower-paying jobs.(64)\n\n11. Retaliation: Actions Likely to Deter Protected Activity\n\nAs noted above in the discussion of covered bases, the EEO statutes prohibit a covered entity from retaliating against an individual who has engaged in protected activity, which includes both participation in the EEO process and opposition to discrimination. The prohibition against retaliation is very broad and covers more than merely discriminatory treatment with respect to terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. The anti-retaliation provisions prohibit any adverse treatment that is based on a retaliatory motive and is reasonably likely to deter the charging party or others from engaging in protected activity. For example, it would be retaliatory to instigate criminal theft and forgery charges against a former employee because she filed an EEOC charge.(65) For a more detailed discussion of charges based on retaliation, refer to Section 8: Retaliation, EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II (1998) (available at www.eeoc.gov).\n\n2-III COVERED PARTIES\n\nA charge must allege that a covered entity took a discriminatory action against a covered individual.\n\nA. Covered Individuals(66)\n\nCOVERED INDIVIDUALS\n\nEmployees and applicants for employment\n\nFormer employees\n\nApplicants to, and participants in, training and apprenticeship programs\n\nA charge must allege that a covered individual was subjected to discrimination. The following sections discuss who is protected by the EEO statutes.\n\n1. Who Is an \"Employee\"?(67)\n\nIn most circumstances, an individual is only protected if s/he was an \"employee\" at the time of the alleged discrimination, rather than an independent contractor, partner, or other non-employee.(68) An \"employee\" is \"an individual employed by an employer.\"(69) An individual may have more than one employer.(70) The question of whether an employer-employee relationship exists is fact-specific and depends on whether the employer controls the means and manner of the worker's work performance. This determination requires consideration of all aspects of the worker's relationship with the employer. Factors indicating that a worker is in an employment relationship with an employer include the following:(71)\n\nThe employer has the right to control when, where, and how the worker performs the job.\n\nThe work does not require a high level of skill or expertise.\n\nThe employer furnishes the tools, materials, and equipment.\n\nThe work is performed on the employer's premises.\n\nThere is a continuing relationship between the worker and the employer.\n\nThe employer has the right to assign additional projects to the worker.\n\nThe employer sets the hours of work and the duration of the job.\n\nThe worker is paid by the hour, week, or month rather than the agreed cost of performing a particular job.\n\nThe worker does not hire and pay assistants.\n\nThe work performed by the worker is part of the regular business of the employer.\n\nThe employer is in business.\n\nThe worker is not engaged in his/her own distinct occupation or business.\n\nThe employer provides the worker with benefits such as insurance, leave, or workers' compensation.\n\nThe worker is considered an employee of the employer for tax purposes (i.e., the employer withholds federal, state, and Social Security taxes).\n\nThe employer can discharge the worker.\n\nThe worker and the employer believe that they are creating an employer-employee relationship.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. Other aspects of the relationship between the parties may affect the determination of whether an employer-employee relationship exists. Furthermore, not all or even a majority of the listed criteria need be met. Rather, the determination must be based on all of the circumstances in the relationship between the parties, regardless of whether the parties refer to it as an employee or as an independent contractor relationship.\n\nExample 1 - CP provides computer consulting services to businesses. The Respondent contracts with CP to produce a computer data base for a flat rate. CP produces the data base at his own place of business, on his own equipment, and delivers the finished product to the Respondent. In these circumstances, CP is an independent contractor.\n\nExample 2 - A staffing firm hires CP and sends her to perform a long- term accounting project for a client. Her contract with the staffing firm states that she is an independent contractor. CP retains the right to work for others, but spends substantially all of her work time performing services for the client, on the client s premises. The client supervises CP, sets her work schedule, provides the necessary equipment and supplies, and specifies how the work is to be accomplished. CP reports the number of hours she has worked to the staffing firm, which pays her and bills the client. In these circumstances, despite the statement in the contract that CP is an independent contractor, she is an employee of both the staffing firm and the client.\n\nThe following sections cover specific situations in which additional considerations may be relevant in determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists.\n\na. Welfare Recipients\n\nA welfare recipient participating in work-related activities as a condition for receipt of benefits will likely be an \"employee.\" The fact that an entity does not pay the worker a salary does not preclude the existence of an employer-employee relationship. The determination of whether there is an employment relationship is based on the same factors outlined above.\n\nb. Union Stewards\n\nA union steward who does not receive wages from the union may still be an \"employee\" of the union. For example, the union steward would be a union employee if s/he was reimbursed by the union for time spent performing union duties during work hours, for union dues, or for retirement contributions.(72)\n\nc. Volunteers\n\nVolunteers usually are not protected \"employees.\" However, an individual may be considered an employee of a particular entity if, as a result of volunteer service, s/he receives benefits such as a pension, group life insurance, workers' compensation, and access to professional certification, even if the benefits are provided by a third party.(73) The benefits constitute \"significant remuneration\" rather than merely the \"inconsequential incidents of an otherwise gratuitous relationship.\"(74)\n\nExample - CP was terminated from her position as a probationary volunteer firefighter after she failed an agility test. She alleges that the test has a disparate impact on women. Respondent claims that CP was not an employee, and, therefore, not protected by Title VII. State X provides volunteer firefighters up to $400/month in state retirement benefits (after five years of service); death and survivors benefits; group life insurance; disability and rehabilitation benefits; health care benefits; and tuition reimbursement for courses in emergency medical and fire service techniques. These benefits are \"significant remuneration\" sufficient to create an employment relationship between CP and Respondent.\n\nA volunteer may also be covered by the EEO statutes if the volunteer work is required for regular employment or regularly leads to regular employment with the same entity. In such situations, discrimination by the respondent operates to deny the charging party an employment opportunity.(75)\n\nExample - CP is a volunteer counselor with the Respondent, a public interest organization, and alleges that she was subjected to sexual harassment by her supervisor and coworkers. Respondent maintains that CP is not its employee, and, therefore, not covered by Title VII. While volunteer service is not a prerequisite to employment, former volunteers are given preferential treatment when competing for vacancies against applicants who have not volunteered with Respondent. Most of Respondent s regular, paid counselors initially performed volunteer work for Respondent. In this case, volunteer service regularly leads to employment with Respondent. Therefore, CP is protected by the EEO statutes.\n\nd. Partners, Officers, Members of Boards of Directors, and Major Shareholders(76)\n\nIn most circumstances, individuals who are partners, officers, members of boards of directors, or major shareholders will not qualify as employees.(77) An individual's title, however, does not determine whether the individual is a partner, officer, member of a board of directors, or major shareholder, as opposed to an employee. The investigator should determine whether the individual acts independently and participates in managing the organization, or whether the individual is subject to the organization's control.(78) If the individual is subject to the organization's control, s/he is an employee. The following factors should be considered:\n\nFACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH REGARD TO COVERAGE OF PARTNERS, OFFICERS, MEMBERS OF BOARDS OF DIRECTORS, AND MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS\n\nWhether the organization can hire or fire the individual or set the rules and regulations of the individual's work\n\nWhether and, if so, to what extent the organization supervises the individual's work\n\nWhether the individual reports to someone higher in the organization\n\nWhether and, if so, to what extent the individual is able to influence the organization\n\nWhether the parties intended that the individual be an employee, as expressed in written agreements or contracts\n\nWhether the individual shares in the profits, losses, and liabilities of the organization\n\nExample 1 - CP works for an accounting firm and has the title of partner. The firm pays CP a salary, and CP is supervised by an individual at a higher level. CP receives a share of the firm s profits in addition to his salary, but he does not have any input into decisions made by the firm, which are made by higher-level partners. While CP has the title of partner, he is in fact an employee.\n\nExample 2 - CP is an officer with Respondent, a small corporation. She is the head of one of the corporation s divisions and has no supervisor, although her actions are reviewed by the board of directors. She does not draw a salary, but receives a share of the profits made by Respondent. CP has the right to vote on decisions taken by Respondent, although her vote does not count as much as those of other individuals. CP is not an employee, and therefore is not protected by the EEO statutes.\n\n2. Coverage of Former Employees\n\nFormer employees are protected by the EEO statutes when they are subjected to discrimination arising from the former employment relationship.(79) For example, the EEO statutes would protect an individual who received a discriminatory job referral from a former employer or one whose former employer reduced the level of benefits to persons over the age of 65 in violation of the ADEA.(80)\n\n3. Coverage of Training Program Applicants and Participants\n\nAn applicant to, or a participant in, a training or apprenticeship program is protected against discrimination with respect to admission to, or participation in, the training or apprenticeship program, regardless of whether the individual is an \"employee.\"(81) Discrimination against a participant in an apprenticeship or training program that is required prior to employment, or that commonly leads to regular employment, also constitutes discrimination against an applicant for employment, and is prohibited because it has the effect of discriminatorily denying someone an employment opportunity.\n\nExample - CP 1, CP 2, and CP 3 were participants in a training program provided by Respondent, and they were each removed from the program for refusing the sexual advances of the program s director. CP 1 is an employee of Respondent, and was required by Respondent to take the training. CP 2 is not an employee of Respondent, but took the training because it is required for a position with Respondent for which CP 2 would like to apply. CP 3 is taking the course because she wants to learn more about the subject matter covered by the training to help her obtain a position with an employer other than Respondent. CP 1, CP 2, and CP 3 are all covered by Title VII.\n\n4. Non-Citizens\n\nIndividuals who are employed in the United States(82) are protected by the EEO statutes regardless of their citizenship or immigration status.(83) The EEO statutes do not protect non-citizens employed outside the United States.\n\nClaims of discrimination based on citizenship status or unfair document practices are covered by the Immigration Reform and Control Act, and are within the jurisdiction of the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices at the Department of Justice. For detailed information on referral procedures to the Office of Special Counsel, see the MOU Between Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and OSC for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (1997) (available at www.eeoc.gov).\n\n5. Coverage of Elected Officials and Their Personal Staff, Appointees, and Immediate Advisers(84)\n\nElected Officials: Elected officials are specifically excluded from coverage under Title VII, the ADEA, and the EPA. The ADA does not exclude elected officials from coverage.\n\nPersonal Staff, Appointees, and Advisers: Members of an elected official's personal staff, appointees on the policy making level, and immediate advisers on the exercise of constitutional or legal powers of the elected official's office are covered by Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA; however, charges filed by those individuals are subject to modified enforcement procedures pursuant to section 321 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.(85)\n\nSome indicia that an individual falls under section 321 are the following:\n\nThe elected official has chosen or appointed the individual to be on the official's personal staff and shares an immediate relationship with the individual.(86)\n\nThe individual receives direction from the elected official and, in turn, is personally accountable to the official.(87)\n\nThe individual is not covered by state or local civil service laws.\n\nAlthough the personal staff of elected officials are protected under the EEO laws, there are limitations on a private lawsuit against a state under the ADEA. For a discussion of this issue, refer to note 100 and accompanying text, below.\n\nExample 1 - CP, a deputy sheriff, performed primarily clerical and secretarial duties, including serving subpoenas, typing complaints and reports, handling detectives telephone calls and correspondence, and assigning case files. The position was created and compensation was provided pursuant to state law. CP did not occupy a high place in the chain of command. She was not under the sheriff s personal direction, and promotion requests were brought to the sheriff's subordinate. There was no evidence that CP had a highly confidential and sensitive relationship with the sheriff. Under these circumstances, CP was not a member of the sheriff s personal staff. Therefore, a charge filed by CP would be processed pursuant to the procedures in 29 C.F.R. Part 1601.\n\nExample 2 - CP files a charge alleging that she was denied the position of Commissioner of the Human Affairs Commission (HAC) of State X on the basis of sex. The Commissioner is exempt from State X's civil service laws, and the individual selected for the position is personally appointed by the Governor. The HAC is an arm of the state s Executive Department, and was created by the legislature to encourage fair treatment of, and to prevent discrimination against, the state's citizens. The HAC has the authority to make rules and regulations, to formulate policies that effectuate the purposes of State X's human affairs laws, and to make recommendations in furtherance of those policies. These are all policymaking functions. As the head of the HAC, the Commissioner plays a major role in formulating policies and having them accepted by the legislature. Therefore, the individual in the position of Commissioner is an appointee on the policymaking level and is covered under section 321.\n\n6. ADEA Exemptions(88)\n\na. Compulsory Retirement of Bona Fide Executive and High-Level Policymakers(89)\n\nAlthough the ADEA generally prohibits involuntary retirement, it specifically permits the compulsory retirement of any employee in a \"bona fide executive or a high policymaking position\" who has attained the age of 65.(90) The exemption does not apply to federal employees.(91) An employer wishing to invoke the exemption must establish that the following elements are met:\n\nREQUIREMENTS OF THE EXEMPTION FOR BONA FIDE EXECUTIVES AND HIGH POLICYMAKERS\n\nThe individual held a bona fide executive or high policymaking position for the two-year period prior to retirement; and\n\nAnnual retirement benefit will total at least $44,000.\n\nAn individual who holds two or more positions during the two-year period is still subject to the exemption if both positions are executive or high policymaking positions. However, if an employer transfers an employee from a position that falls within the exemption to another position that does not fall within the exemption, it cannot compel the employee to retire.\n\ni. Who Is a Bona Fide Executive or High Policymaker?\n\n(a) Bona Fide Executive\n\nThe determination of whether an individual is a bona fide executive rests on the functions performed by that employee, regardless of salary. An employer seeking to demonstrate that an individual is a \"bona fide executive\" must establish the following:(92)\n\nREQUIREMENTS TO BE A \"BONA FIDE EXECUTIVE\"\n\nManages the organization or a department or subdivision of the organization;\n\nDirects the work of at least two other employees;\n\nHas authority to hire or dismiss other employees or his/her suggestions as to personnel decisions are given particular weight;\n\nCustomarily and regularly exercises discretionary powers; and\n\nNo more than 20 percent of his/her work time (or 40 percent if s/he is in a retail or service establishment) is devoted to activities unrelated to those described in requirements 1 through 4 above; this requirement does not apply if the individual is in sole charge of an independent establishment or a physically separated branch establishment, or if s/he owns at least a 20-percent interest in the enterprise by which s/he is employed.\n\nThe exemption does not apply to middle-management employees, only to top-level employees who exercise substantial managerial authority over a significant number of employees and a large volume of business. For example, the head of a significant and substantial local or regional operation of a corporation (such as a major production facility), but not the head of a minor branch, would be covered by the term \"bona fide executive.\"(93) The heads of major departments associated with corporate headquarters operations, such as finance and legal, would also typically be covered by the term \"bona fide executive.\"\n\n(b) High Policymaker\n\nThe term \"high policymaking position\" refers to certain top-level employees who are not \"bona fide executives,\" but who nonetheless play a significant role in developing and implementing corporate policy. For example, a chief economist or chief research scientist may have little line authority, but still have a significant impact on policy decisions by making recommendations to top-level executives based upon the evaluation of economic or scientific trends.\n\nExample 1 - At age 65, CP was required to retire from his position as Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs of a bank. CP reported directly to the CEO, had direct access to the bank's decisionmakers, and attended weekly meetings of the Senior Officers Group. In addition, he alone was responsible for monitoring state and local federal legislative and regulatory developments, recommending policies to ensure compliance with them, and working closely with state legislators on legislation important to the savings bank industry. He also monitored and coordinated important tax litigation involving the bank, including recommending legal counsel, and coordinated bank policy on interest rates for passbook savings accounts. CP falls within the exemption for high policymakers, and therefore, Respondent may require his retirement at age 65. Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 32-33 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nExample 2 - CP files a charge after being required to retire from his position as Chief Labor Counsel of a corporation upon reaching the age of 65. CP was an in-house attorney specializing in labor law, and exercised relatively minor supervisory duties over four other labor law attorneys. He was far removed from the head of the Legal Department, being one of six attorneys who reported to one of eight Assistant General Counsel, who, in turn, reported to the General Counsel. CP also had only a modest impact on policy, had virtually no access to the high policymaking levels of management, and attended meetings of certain committees primarily for the purpose of providing legal advice. Respondent was not permitted to compel CP's retirement because he did not qualify as a bona fide executive or high policymaker. Whittlesey v. Union Carbide Corp., 567 F. Supp.1320, 1321-28 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd, 742 F.2d 724 (2d Cir. 1984).\n\nii. Retirement Benefits Computation\n\nIn addition to being a bona fide executive or a high policymaker, an employee subject to this exemption must be entitled to retirement benefits of at least $44,000 yearly. This figure applies regardless of the date of retirement and is not adjusted to account for inflation. The benefits must be \"nonforfeitable,\" meaning that the plan may not provide circumstances under which the benefits would be reduced to less than $44,000.\n\nThe benefits can be provided in any of several forms to satisfy the requirement, including:\n\nYearly payments that add up to at least $44,000 per year; or\n\nA lump sum payment with which it would be possible to purchase a single life annuity yielding at least $44,000 per year.\n\nPayment of benefits must begin within 60 days of the effective date of retirement unless the employee elects to defer receipt of benefits beyond expiration of the 60-day period.\n\nIn calculating the value of benefits, only amounts provided by the employer and earnings thereon under the terms of a pension, profit-sharing, savings, or deferred compensation plan are counted. Amounts attributable to Social Security, employee contributions, contributions of prior employers, and rollover contributions are excluded.\n\nFor further guidance on calculating the retirement benefit under the exemption for bona fide executives and high policymakers, refer to 29 C.F.R. § 1627.17.\n\nb. Firefighters and Law Enforcement Officers\n\nThe ADEA exempts certain hiring and discharge decisions pertaining to firefighters and law enforcement officers that are made pursuant to a state or local law.\n\nLaw in effect on March 3, 1983, or enacted after September 30, 1996: Under most circumstances, the local law must have been in effect on March 3, 1983, or have been enacted after September 30, 1996.(94)\n\nA law in effect on March 3, 1983, or enacted after September 30, 1996, may establish any maximum age for hiring.\n\nA law enacted after September 30, 1996, may not establish a retirement age lower than 55. A law in effect on March 3, 1983, may establish any retirement age.\n\nLaw in effect after March 3, 1983, and enacted before October 1, 1996: A law that went into effect after March 3, 1983, and was enacted before October 1, 1996, may be no more restrictive than one in place in March 3, 1983.\n\nExample - Pursuant to a local ordinance passed in 1990, CP was discharged from her position as a firefighter in March 1999 upon reaching the retirement age of 55. Because the law was not in effect on March 3, 1983, or enacted after September 30, 1996, the discharge decision does not fall under the exemption.\n\nc. Programs Designed for Individuals with \"Special Employment Problems\"\n\nThe ADEA does not apply to federally funded or state programs designed to enhance employment of individuals with \"special employment problems.\"(95) Such programs include those designed to enhance employment of the long-term unemployed, individuals with disabilities, members of minority groups, older workers, or youth. For additional guidance on this exemption, refer to Policy Statement on Specific Exemptions from Coverage Pursuant to § 9 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II (1988).\n\nB. Covered Entities\n\nCOVERED ENTITIES\n\nEmployers\n\nEmployment agencies\n\nLabor organizations\n\nThe prohibitions under Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA generally apply to employers, employment agencies, and labor organizations.(96) The EPA applies to employers and labor organizations. The requirements for coverage for each of these entities are discussed below.\n\n1. Requirements for Coverage\n\na. Employers\n\ni. Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA\n\n\"Employers\" include private sector and state and local government entities.(97) An employer is covered under Title VII or the ADA if it has 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the same calendar year as, or in the calendar year prior to when, the alleged discrimination occurred.(98) The requirements for coverage of a private sector employer under the ADEA are the same, except that it must have 20 or more employees. A state or local government employer is covered under the ADEA regardless of its number of employees.(99)\n\nImportantly, the Supreme Court has ruled that under the ADEA, private age discrimination suits against states are impermissible unless the state waives its sovereign immunity.(100) However, the EEOC's enforcement authority remains unaffected, and the EEOC may continue to sue states to obtain relief for individuals. Therefore, investigators should continue to take charges against states under the ADEA. If a charge is filed against a state under the ADA or the EPA, the investigator should consult the legal unit.\n\nTo be covered, an employer must also be engaged in an \"industry affecting commerce\"; however, this requirement is rarely at issue, and it can be assumed that an employer having the requisite number of employees for the relevant time frame will also meet the commerce requirement.\n\nA covered employer also includes an agent of an employer that meets the requirements under the appropriate statute. Coverage of agents is discussed at § 2-III B.2, below.\n\nUnder Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA, an employer is covered if it has an employment relationship with the requisite number of employees for the relevant number of weeks, regardless of the daily work schedules of the individual employees.(101) For example, an employee who only works on Mondays and Wednesdays is counted as an employee for the entire week because s/he continues to have an employment relationship with the employer throughout the week. An individual is counted as an employee for each working day after hire and until employment terminates.\n\nCOUNTING EMPLOYEES\n\nTo count employees, determine the number of employees on an employer s payroll; exclude individuals who are not employees, e.g., discharged/former employees or independent contractors. Add to that figure any other individuals who have an employment relationship with the employer, such as temporary or other staffing firm workers. Where a charge is filed during the early part of the calendar year, it may be necessary to wait until later during the same year to assess employer coverage.\n\nIn determining whether the 20-week requirement is met, only calendar weeks when the employer had the requisite number of employees for each workday of that week are counted. However, the 20 weeks need not be consecutive. In addition, an employee who started or ended employment during the middle of a calendar week is counted as an employee on the days when s/he had an employment relationship with the employer.(102)\n\nThe employer is not required to have the statutory number of employees at the time of the alleged violation or before it, as long as the requirement is met by the end of the calendar year in which the discrimination occurred. For example, a newly formed company may have been in operation for only a short period at the time that a disputed action transpired. However, it would be covered if it met the 20-week requirement during the remainder of the same calendar year.(103)\n\nExample - CP filed a charge alleging that she was not hired because of her sex and age on March 1, 1998. A review of Respondent's personnel records reveals the following:\n\nJanuary 1 - April 1, 1998: 14 employees\n\nApril 2 - August 1, 1998: 21 employees\n\nAugust 2 - November 1, 1998: 14 employees\n\nNovember 2 - December 31, 1998: 19 employees\n\nThe records reveal that Respondent had 15 or more employees for at least 20 calendar weeks during 1998, the year during which the alleged discrimination occurred. Therefore, it is a covered employer under Title VII. However, it is not covered by the ADEA because it did not have 20 or more employees for at least 20 weeks.\n\nii. EPA\n\nEPA coverage is extremely broad. The EPA applies to employers \"engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce\" with an annual gross volume of sales or business done of at least $500,000.(104) Health and educational institutions and government agencies are covered by the EPA, regardless of size. There are a few narrow exemptions for employees in certain professions.(105) In the unlikely event that EPA coverage is challenged by the respondent, the investigator should consult the legal unit.\n\niii. Special Issues Regarding Multiple Entities(106)\n\n(a) Integrated Enterprises\n\nIf an employer does not have the minimum number of employees to meet the statutory requirement, it is still covered if it is part of an \"integrated enterprise\" that, overall, meets the requirement. An integrated enterprise is one in which the operations of two or more employers are considered so intertwined that they can be considered the single employer of the charging party. The separate entities that form an integrated enterprise are treated as a single employer for purposes of both coverage and liability. If a charge is filed against one of the entities, relief can be obtained from any of the entities that form part of the integrated enterprise.\n\nThe factors to be considered in determining whether separate entities should be treated as an integrated enterprise are:\n\nThe degree of interrelation between the operations\n\nSharing of management services such as check writing, preparation of mutual policy manuals, contract negotiations, and completion of business licenses\n\nSharing of payroll and insurance programs\n\nSharing of services of managers and personnel\n\nSharing use of office space, equipment, and storage\n\nOperating the entities as a single unit\n\nThe degree to which the entities share common management\n\nWhether the same individuals manage or supervise the different entities\n\nWhether the entities have common officers and boards of directors\n\nCentralized control of labor relations\n\nWhether there is a centralized source of authority for development of personnel policy\n\nWhether one entity maintains personnel records and screens and tests applicants for employment\n\nWhether the entities share a personnel (human resources) department and whether inter-company transfers and promotions of personnel are common\n\nWhether the same persons make the employment decisions for both entities\n\nThe degree of common ownership or financial control over the entities\n\nWhether the same person or persons own or control the different entities\n\nWhether the same persons serve as officers and/or directors of the different entities\n\nWhether one company owns the majority or all of the shares of the other company(107)\n\nThe purpose of these factors is to establish the degree of control exercised by one entity over the operation of another entity. All of the factors should be considered in assessing whether separate entities constitute an integrated enterprise, but it is not necessary that all factors be present, nor is the presence of any single factor dispositive. The primary focus should be on centralized control of labor relations. It should be noted that while this issue often arises where there is a parent-subsidiary relationship, a parent-subsidiary relationship is not required for two companies to be considered an integrated enterprise.(108)\n\nExample - CP applies for a position with ABC Corp., is rejected, and files a charge alleging sex and age discrimination.\n\nABC Corp. is a computer training center. Jane Smith is its president and sole proprietor. She is also the president and sole proprietor of three other computer training centers, and of Computer Training, Inc. (CTI), which manages ABC Corp. and the three other centers. Smith is personally involved in the management of each of these companies and makes personnel decisions for the training centers in her capacity as president of CTI and as president of the individual centers. CTI pays the bills for each of the training centers, handles payroll, and negotiates contracts for the centers. CTI created a personnel handbook for use by each of the training centers. The profits of the individual training centers are pooled into one bank account in the name of CTI, which maintains a centralized management account allowing the profits of more successful training centers to cover the losses of less successful ones.\n\nUnder these circumstances, ABC, CTI, and the other training centers are an integrated enterprise, and should be considered a single employer for purposes of coverage and liability under the EEO statutes.\n\n(b) Joint Employers\n\nThe term \"joint employer\" refers to two or more employers that are unrelated or that are not sufficiently related to qualify as an integrated enterprise, but that each exercise sufficient control of an individual to qualify as his/her employer.(109) The \"joint employer\" issue frequently arises in cases involving temporary staffing agencies. A charge must be filed against each employer to pursue a claim against that employer.\n\nTo determine whether a respondent is covered, count the number of individuals employed by the respondent alone and the employees jointly employed by the respondent and other entities. If an individual is jointly employed by two or more employers, then s/he is counted for coverage purposes for each employer with which s/he has an employment relationship.\n\nIf a charge is filed by a contract worker who is jointly employed by a private-sector employer and a federal agency, s/he should be notified that a claim against the federal agency must be filed with the agency's EEO office.\n\nFor more guidance on the determination of whether an entity qualifies as a joint employer, refer to the Commission's Enforcement Guidance on Application of EEO Laws to Contingent Workers Placed by Temporary Employment Agencies and Other Staffing Firms, Questions 1-2, N:3319-21 (BNA) (1997) (available at www.eeoc.gov) (discussing factors considered in determining whether an entity has sufficient control to qualify as an individual's employer).\n\nExample 1 - CP files a charge against ABC Corp alleging that she was subjected to religious harassment. ABC Corp. has 13 regular employees and five employees assigned by a temporary agency, who are jointly employed by ABC and the temporary agency. ABC is covered under Title VII because it has 18 employees.\n\nExample 2 - CP 1 files a charge against ABC Corp under the ADEA. CP 2 files a charge against Smith Corp under Title VII. ABC is the sole employer of 17 employees. ABC also employs 5 employees who are jointly employed by Smith. Smith is the sole employer of 12 employees. Under the circumstances, ABC is covered under the ADEA, and Smith is covered under Title VII.\n\nb. Employment Agencies\n\nAn entity is a covered employment agency if it regularly procures employees for at least one covered employer, whether or not it receives compensation for those services.(110) An employment agency that regularly procures employees for at least one covered employer is covered with respect to all of its employee procurement and referral activities, including its referrals to a non-covered employer.(111) Coverage extends to agents of such an employment agency. For a discussion of agents, refer to § 2-III B.2, below. An employee of a covered employment agency may file a charge against the agency as his/her employer even if it does not have the requisite number of employees for employer coverage under the relevant EEO statute.(112)\n\nExample 1 - CP files a charge alleging that she was not referred by Respondent, an employment agency, for a position with ABC Corp., which has 17 employees, because of her age. Respondent also regularly procures employees for XYZ Corp., which has over 50 employees. Although ABC is not a covered employer under the ADEA, Respondent also regularly procures employees for XYZ, which is a covered employer. Therefore, Respondent is a covered employment agency, and is prohibited from discriminating in any of its referral and procurement activities, including those conducted with ABC, a non-covered employer.\n\nExample 2 - CP 1 files a charge alleging that she was not hired because of her religion by Respondent, an employment agency with 12 employees. CP 2 files a charge alleging that she was not referred by Respondent for a position with Smith Corp., which has 17 employees, because of her race. Respondent regularly procures employees for Smith Corp. Therefore, Respondent is covered with respect to the claim raised by CP 1 and with respect to the claim raised by CP 2.\n\nc. Labor Organizations\n\nA labor organization is covered under Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA if it meets one of the following two tests:\n\nIt has 15 or more members (25 or more under the ADEA) or maintains a hiring hall which procures employees for at least one covered employer.(114)\n\nor\n\nIt represents the employees of an employer;(113) and\n\nIt is engaged in an industry affecting commerce.(115)\n\nThis latter basis for union coverage will generally bring a union representing federal employees under the EEO statutes.(116) A labor organization is covered under the EPA if it represents the employees of at least one covered employer.(117)\n\nMost labor organizations, including those representing federal employees, are covered under at least one of the above definitions of \"labor organization.\" Where coverage is disputed and cannot be easily assessed, the investigator should contact the legal unit. Agents of labor organizations may also be covered. For a discussion of agents, refer to § 2-III B.2, below.\n\nIt is the EEOC's position that an employee of a covered labor organization may file a charge against it as his/her employer even if it does not have the requisite number of employees for employer coverage under the relevant EEO statute. However, this position has generally been rejected by the courts.(118) Therefore, if a charging party files a charge raising this coverage issue, the investigator should consult the legal unit.\n\nWhere the respondent is a non-federal union, the charging party should be advised that s/he may also file a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Where the respondent is a federal union (but not a postal union), the investigator should notify the charging party that s/he can also file an unfair labor practice charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority. An unfair labor practice charge against a postal union is filed with the NLRB.\n\nExample - CP 1 files a charge alleging that she was not hired by the Respondent, a labor organization, because she has a mental disability. CP 2 files a charge alleging that Respondent refused to bring her grievance alleging that she was subjected to age-based harassment. Respondent has only nine employees; however, it is a covered labor organization under both the ADA and the ADEA. Therefore, Respondent is covered with respect to the claims raised by CP 1 and with respect to the claim raised by CP 2.\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA prohibit a covered labor organization from engaging in discriminatory membership practices and other discriminatory activities related to its status as a labor organization, e.g., failing to provide a sign language interpreter to a bargaining unit employee with a hearing disability.\n\nThe EPA prohibits a labor organization from causing or attempting to cause a covered employer to violate the statute.\n\n2. Agents\n\na. Liability for Actions Taken by an Agent\n\nA covered entity is as liable for the actions of its agents as it would be for actions taken by itself. An agent is an individual or entity having the authority to act on behalf of, or at the direction of, the covered entity.(119) Examples of agents include:\n\nSupervisors\n\nUnion officials\n\nInsurance providers(120) or benefits administrators(121)\n\nPension plan administrators(122)\n\nb. Liability of Agents\n\nAn entity that is an agent of a covered entity is liable for the discriminatory actions it takes on behalf of the covered entity.(123) For example, an insurance company that provides discriminatory benefits to the employees of a law firm may be liable under the EEO statutes as the law firm's agent.(124)\n\nMost of the federal appeals courts have held that supervisors may not be held individually liable for discrimination because they do not meet the definition of the term \"employer.\"(125) If a charge is filed against an individual supervisor, the investigator should consult the legal unit. The investigator should also consult with the legal unit regarding potential charges against state officials for injunctive relief. See note 100 and accompanying text, above (discussing charges against states).\n\nOf course, a sole proprietor who employs at least 15 or 20 employees (depending upon the applicable statute) would be liable as a covered \"employer.\"(126)\n\n3. Specific Issues Related to Coverage of Employers\n\na. Third-Party Interference with Employment Opportunities\n\ni. Generally\n\nIn addition to prohibiting employers from discriminating against their own employees, Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA prohibit a covered third-party employer from discriminatorily interfering with an individual's employment opportunities with another employer.(127) While the third-party employer might, in some cases, be a joint employer, the principle described here applies even where an employment relationship has never existed between the third-party employer and the individual. This kind of liability is commonly known as \"third-party interference.\" The ADA specifically prohibits interference with rights protected under the statute.(128) While Title VII and the ADEA do not include comparable provisions, they prohibit discrimination against \"individuals.\" Therefore, a charging party need not necessarily be an employee of the employer that is accused of discriminatory interference.(129)\n\nThe EPA only protects individuals who are employed by the respondent employer from sex-based compensation discrimination because it only prohibits discrimination against the respondent's own employees.(130)\n\nFor the third-party interference theory to be available against an employer, two requirements must be met:\n\nA federal agency may not be held liable for discriminating against another party's employees under Title VII or the ADEA because those statutes only prohibit federal agencies from discriminating against \"employees\" and applicants for employment. A federal agency may be held liable for discriminating against another party's employees based on disability, however, because the Rehabilitation Act incorporates section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits interference with any individual's rights under the chapter.(131)\n\nExample 1 - Respondent is a hospital that receives emergency room services from ABC Medical Corp. CP is employed by ABC as the director of Respondent s emergency room. CP files a charge alleging that Respondent discriminated against her on the basis of age and sex by asking ABC to replace her with a younger male director. Respondent is a covered employer under Title VII and the ADEA. Under these circumstances, CP has a Title VII and ADEA claim against Respondent for interfering with her employment relationship with ABC. If Respondent exercises sufficient control over CP, it may also be liable as a joint employer.\n\nExample 2 - Respondent is a contract firm that provides cleaning services for XYZ Corp. CP, an employee of XYZ Corp., files a charge against Respondent alleging that she was sexually harassed by one of its supervisors. Respondent is a covered employer under Title VII. Under these circumstances, CP has a Title VII claim against Respondent for interfering with her employment relationship with XYZ. Of course, CP may also have a claim against her own employer if, after bringing the harassment to its attention, it failed to take prompt and appropriate corrective action.\n\nExample 3 - Respondent is an insurance company that provides insurance for the employees of Smith, Inc. CP, an employee of Smith, Inc., files a charge alleging that Respondent violated the ADA by providing a lower level of coverage for AIDS-related illnesses. Under the circumstances, CP has an ADA claim against Respondent for providing discriminatory insurance benefits arising out of his employment relationship with Smith, Inc. Because the charge is filed under the ADA, it is not necessary that Respondent be a covered employer.\n\nFor more guidance on the third-party interference theory, refer to Enforcement Guidance on Control by Third Parties over the Employment Relationship Between an Individual and His/Her Direct Employer, EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Appendix 605-F.\n\nii. Professional/Licensing Boards\n\nThe third-party interference theory generally cannot be applied to a state agency that licenses or certifies individuals to work in a particular profession under the EEO statutes where it is exercising its police power in granting and denying licenses.(132) However, a licensing agency could be liable under the third-party interference theory when it exercises a function beyond merely its police powers.\n\nExample - A state commission issues licenses to and rents stall space for horse trainers. Under such circumstances, the commission would not be covered as an employer in its capacity as a licensor but might be covered under the third-party interference theory in its capacity as a renter of stall spaces, if it met other requirements for coverage. Puntolillo v. New Hampshire Racing Comm n, 375 F. Supp. 1089 (D.N.H. 1974).\n\nIf a charge against a licensing agency alleges disability-based discrimination, the charging party should be notified that s/he might have a claim under Title II of the ADA, and referred to the Department of Justice.\n\nEven if a licensing board is not liable under the third-party interference theory, it may still be liable under Title VII or the ADA. Section 707 of Title VII, which is incorporated in the ADA, authorizes the Commission to take enforcement action whenever it has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice that denies others the rights provided by the statute, and to investigate a charge of such a pattern or practice of discrimination.(133) A pattern or practice of discrimination refers to a repeated routine of discrimination, and not an isolated incident. For example, an allegation of selective enforcement of a licensing requirement against African-Americans or some other protected class would constitute an allegation of pattern or practice discrimination covered by Section 707.\n\niii. Correctional Facilities\n\nA prison does not have an employment relationship with its own prisoners. Thus, its supervision of prisoners performing work in the prison is not subject to the EEO statutes, even if the work is being performed for monetary or other compensation.(134) Nonetheless, if a correctional institution is a covered employer, it would be prohibited from discriminatorily interfering with an inmate's employment with an outside employer through a work release program.(135) For example, Title VII would prohibit a correctional institution with 15 or more employees from using race as a factor in allowing inmates to work with outside employers through a work release program.\n\nb. Successor Liability\n\nA business that acquires another may be subject to liability under the EEO statutes for discrimination that was committed by the entity that it succeeded, even if the successor is not named in the charge. Whether the successor should be held liable for the discriminatory acts of its predecessors must be determined on a case-by-case basis, and requires a balancing of the interests of the employer and the employee. The following factors should be considered:\n\nWhether the successor entity had notice of the charge;\n\nWhether the predecessor can provide relief;\n\nWhether the same business operations have continuously been in place:\n\nWhether the successor used the same plant, workforce, management, and/or equipment and means of production as the predecessor;\n\nWhether the same jobs exist under substantially the same working conditions; and\n\nWhether the successor produces the same product.\n\nGenerally, the successor can only be held liable if it had notice of the charge and the predecessor is unable to provide relief.(136) The third factor, continuity of business operations, requires a weighing of the criteria listed above.\n\nExample 1 - CP alleges that Respondent discharged him from his position as a salesman based on his national origin. Respondent sells its sales operations to ABC Corporation, but remains in business as a manufacturer. CP seeks back pay for the period from his discharge through the date he got another position with XYZ Corporation. Because Respondent is able to provide relief, ABC should not be held liable.\n\nExample 2 - Same as above except that CP seeks reinstatement. Because only ABC can provide reinstatement, it can be held liable and can be required to provide that remedy as long as it had notice of the charge.\n\nExample 3 - CP alleges that she was sexually harassed by a supervisory employee of Respondent, an electronics manufacturer. After CP files her charge, Respondent sells its assets and operations to Smith Corp., a competitor, which has notice of the charge at the time of the sale. After the sale, Respondent is declared bankrupt. ABC retains most of the employees who formerly worked for Respondent and continues Respondent's electronics manufacturing business. Under these circumstances, the requirements for successor liability are met, and Smith Corp. can be held liable for the discriminatory acts of Respondent.\n\nc. Foreign Employers in the United States and American Employers Overseas\n\nFor detailed guidance on the issues discussed below, refer to Enforcement Guidance on Application of Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act to Conduct Overseas and to Foreign Employers Discriminating in the United States (1993); and Policy Guidance on Application of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) to American Firms Overseas, Their Overseas Subsidiaries, and Foreign Firms (1989).\n\ni. Foreign Employers in the United States\n\n(a) Generally\n\nA foreign employer doing business in the United States is generally covered by the EEO statutes to the same extent as an American employer. However, in some cases, such an employer may allege that it is party to a treaty that permits it to prefer its own nationals for certain positions. If this defense is raised, the investigator should determine the following:\n\nIS A FOREIGN EMPLOYER PROTECTED BY A TREATY?\n\n1) Is the respondent protected by the treaty?\n\n2) If so, are the employment practices at issue covered by the treaty; and\n\n3) If so, what is the impact of the treaty on the application of the relevant EEO statute?\n\nThe investigator should contact the Office of Legal Counsel for assistance.\n\nIn determining whether a U.S.-based branch of a foreign employer is covered, employees based abroad should also be counted if the U.S. and foreign branches constitute an integrated enterprise.(137) Thus, if a Japanese employer has a U.S.-based branch with only 10 employees, it would still be covered by Title VII if the U.S. employer is integrated with a foreign branch with at least five employees. For a discussion of integrated enterprises, refer to § 2-III B.1.a.iii(a), above.\n\n(b) Embassies\n\nThe embassy of a foreign state located within the United States is generally immune from United States courts under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).(138) The EEO statutes apply to personnel of an embassy of a foreign state located within the United States only in limited circumstances:\n\nAmerican citizens and third-country nationals: American citizens and third-country nationals, i.e., citizens of neither the United States nor of the foreign state claiming immunity, are covered by the EEO statutes.(139)\n\nCitizens of foreign state claiming immunity under FSIA if engaged in commercial activity: The FSIA provides an exception from immunity for commercial activity.(140) Thus, a citizen of the foreign state claiming immunity is covered by the EEO statutes if s/he is engaged in commercial activity.(141) The employment of diplomatic, civil service, or military personnel is governmental, whereas the employment of other personnel, e.g., laborers, clerical, or public relations officials, is commercial.(142)\n\nii. American Employers Overseas\n\nTitle VII, the ADEA, and the ADA generally prohibit discrimination against U.S. citizens by American employers operating overseas.(143) The EPA does not apply overseas. An employer operating abroad that is incorporated in the United States will generally have sufficient ties to the United States to be deemed an American employer. Where an employer is not incorporated in the United States or it is not incorporated at all, e.g., a law firm, various factors should be considered to determine if the employer has sufficient connections with the United States to make it an American employer. Factors to consider include the following:\n\nThe employer's principal place of business, i.e., the primary place where factories, offices, and other facilities are located\n\nThe nationality of dominant shareholders and/or those holding voting control\n\nThe nationality and location of management\n\nThe EEO statutes also prohibit discrimination by a foreign employer that is controlled by an American employer. The determination of whether an American employer controls a foreign employer is based on the following:(144)\n\nCONTROL OF A FOREIGN EMPLOYER BY AN AMERICAN EMPLOYER\n\nInterrelation of operations\n\nCommon management\n\nCentralized control of labor relations\n\nCommon ownership or financial control of the American employerand the foreign employer\n\nRefer to § 2-III B.1.a.iii(a) (integrated enterprises), above, for a discussion of how to apply these factors.\n\n4. Exemptions and Exclusions from Coverage\n\na. Entities that Are Exempt from Coverage for Any Employment Decision\n\ni. Title VII and ADA Exemption of American Indian Tribes\n\nTitle VII and the ADA do not apply to American Indian tribes, which are excluded from the definition of \"employer,\" but may apply to a tribally owned business. The critical factors in determining whether a tribally owned business is exempt are whether it performs essentially governmental functions on the tribe's behalf and whether it is integrated with and controlled by the tribe.(145)\n\nNeither the ADEA nor the EPA excludes American Indian tribes from the definition of \"employer.\" Therefore, those statutes presumptively apply to American Indian tribes(146) unless their application would infringe on treaty rights or tribal sovereignty.(147)\n\nii. Bona Fide Private Membership Clubs(148)\n\nTitle VII and the ADA do not apply to a bona fide private membership club (other than a labor organization) which is exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Bona fide private membership clubs are not exempt under the ADEA or EPA.\n\nTo fall under the Title VII/ADA exemption, an organization must show both that it is tax-exempt and that it is a bona fide private membership club. An organization is deemed a bona fide private membership club if it meets each of the following requirements:\n\nBONA FIDE PRIVATE MEMBERSHIP CLUB REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe organization is a club in the ordinary sense of the word;\n\nThe organization is private; and\n\nThere are meaningful conditions of limited membership.\n\n(a) Definition of \"Club\"\n\nA \"club\" is defined as follows:\n\nan association of persons for social and recreational purposes or for the promotion of some common object (as literature, science, political activity) usually jointly supported and meeting periodically, membership in social clubs usually being conferred by ballot and carrying the privilege of use of the club property.(149)\n\n(b) Is the Club Private?\n\nIn determining whether a club is private, the Commission considers the following:\n\nThe extent to which it limits its facilities and services to club members and their guests\n\nThe extent to which and/or the manner in which it is controlled or owned by its membership\n\nWhether and, if so, to what extent and in what manner it publicly advertises to solicit members or to promote the use of its facilities or services by the general public\n\nThe presence or absence of any one of these factors is not determinative, however, and the question as to whether an organization is private must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n(c) Meaningful Conditions of Limited Membership\n\nFinally, in determining whether the requirement of meaningful conditions of limited membership is met, the Commission will consider both the size of the membership,(150) including the existence of any limitations on its size, and membership eligibility requirements.\n\nExample 1 - Respondent was founded to promote the popularity of golf as a recreational activity. It has 200 members, who provide all operating revenue. It is exempt from taxation under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Members have free use of the organization's facilities, including the golf course, health spa, meeting rooms, and cafeteria. Nonmembers may only use the facilities at the request and in the presence of a member. Applicants for membership must be at least 25 years of age, have an undergraduate degree, know at least five current members, and be nominated by a current member, who must explain how s/he knows the nominee and the reason the nominee should be admitted for membership. Respondent has admitted most but not all applicants. Respondent qualifies as a \"bona fide private membership club\" and would not be covered by Title VII or the ADA.\n\nExample 2 - Same facts as above, except that nonmembers may use the facilities without a sponsoring member by paying an extra fee. Applicants for membership need only know one current member, and Respondent has admitted all applicants for membership. Respondent has not established that it is private, nor that it has meaningful conditions of limited membership; therefore, it is not a bona fide private membership club.\n\niii. Public International Organizations\n\nPublic international organizations, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations are generally not covered by the EEO statutes because of immunity conferred under international and United States law. An organization will be immune if is included on the list of organizations entitled to immunity set out in the International Organizations Immunities Act(151) unless immunity has been waived by the organization or by Presidential Executive Order. If it is unclear whether an organization's immunity has been waived, the charge should be referred to the legal unit for a determination of whether the EEO statutes can be applied to the organization. For more detailed guidance on processing these charges, refer to Enforcement Guidance on International Organizations, EEOC Compliance Manual, Volume II, Appendix 605-B.\n\nb. Partial Exemptions\n\ni. Exemptions for Discrimination Based on Religion\n\nTitle VII does not apply to discrimination by a religious organization on the basis of religion in hiring and discharge. The exemption applies to an organization whose \"purpose and character are primarily religious.\"(152) This determination requires a weighing of all significant religious and secular characteristics.(153)\n\nThe exemption applies to all positions; however, discrimination is not permitted on any basis other than religion.(154) In addition, the exemption only applies to hiring and discharge, and does not apply to terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, such as wages or benefits.(155)\n\nA separate \"ministerial\" exception based on the First Amendment prevents interference between a religious institution and its ordained clergy, an individual effectively acting in that capacity, or an individual intimately involved in religious indoctrination.(156) Thus, the EEO statutes do not apply to an employment decision regarding an individual who falls within the exception.(157) For a detailed discussion of the ministerial exemption and other constitutional limitations on regulating religious organizations, refer to Religious Organizations that Pay Women Less Than Men in Accordance with Religious Beliefs (1990) (religious organization may not pay women less than men even if policy is in accordance with its religious beliefs).\n\nii. Business on or near an American Indian Reservation\n\nAn entity on or near an American Indian reservation may grant preferential treatment to a Native American living on or near the reservation with respect to a publicly announced employment practice. \"Near\" is defined as being located within reasonable commuting distance. Employment practices in which preferential treatment may be granted include hiring, promotion, transfer, reinstatement, and reduction in force. The exemption permits employers to prefer Native Americans over non-Native Americans, but not to prefer members of one tribe over members of another tribe.(158) The preference extends to former reservations in Oklahoma and Native Alaska land held under provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.(159) To satisfy the public announcement requirement, an entity must disclose that preferential treatment will be given with respect to a particular employment practice.(160) For example, if an employer wishes to grant preferential treatment to Native Americans applying for a certain vacancy, then it must state that it is doing so in the same notice that announces the vacancy.\n\niii. Veterans' Preference\n\nTitle VII does not apply to a decision taken because of a veterans' preference created by a federal, state, or local law.(161) Thus, even though a veterans' preference may, for example, disproportionately exclude women, it does not violate Title VII if it is a legislatively enacted preference.(162) In contrast, a veterans' preference that is voluntarily provided by an employer may violate EEO laws, including Title VII, if it has the purpose or effect of discriminating on a prohibited basis.(163)\n\nThe ADA, the ADEA, and the EPA do not exempt employment actions that are taken based on a veterans' preference.(164)\n\niv. National Security\n\nTitle VII does not prohibit termination, or refusal to hire or refer for jobs where an individual does not meet the requirements for a position that are imposed in the interest of national security under any security program in effect under statute or Executive Order.(165) The respondent must affirmatively establish that the security clearance is required for the position under a national security program pursuant to statute or Executive Order.\n\nIf the respondent establishes that such a security clearance is required, Commission review is limited. The Commission can review whether the grant, denial, or revocation of a security clearance was conducted in a discriminatory manner. Thus, the Commission can review whether procedural requirements in making security clearance determinations were followed without regard to an individual's protected status. For instance, the Commission could review a claim that the respondent followed certain procedural requirements when revoking the clearances of white individuals but failed to follow those procedures when revoking the clearances of Asian individuals.(166) However, the Commission is precluded from reviewing the substance of the security clearance determination or the security requirement under any of the EEO statutes.(167)\n\nFor more guidance on making these determinations, refer to Policy Guidance on the Use of the National Security Exception Contained in § 703(g) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (1989).\n\n2-IV TIMELINESS\n\nOrdinarily, a charge must be filed within the statutory limitations period. The filing deadline can occasionally be extended when equitable considerations demand or when the parties agree to waive the deadline.\n\nA. Charge Filing(168)\n\n1. Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA\n\nUnder Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA,(169) a charging party must file a charge with the EEOC within either 180 or 300 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice, depending upon whether the alleged violation occurred in a jurisdiction that has a state or local fair employment practices agency (FEPA) with the authority to grant or seek relief.(170) If the deadline falls on a weekend or holiday, it is extended until the next business day.(171)\n\nJurisdiction without a FEPA: Where the alleged violation arose in a state or locality that does not have a FEPA with the authority to grant relief, a charge must be filed with the EEOC within 180 days of the violation.\n\nJurisdiction with a FEPA: Where the alleged violation arose in a state or locality that does have a FEPA, a charge must be filed with the EEOC or a FEPA within 300 days of the violation.(172)\n\nBecause most jurisdictions have FEPAs, the limitations period will usually be 300 days. However, an investigator should check with the legal unit to determine the applicable period when uncertain.\n\nExample - On January 1, 1998, CP was notified that she was being discharged from her position with Respondent in State X. Two hundred days later, CP filed a charge with the EEOC alleging that Respondent discharged her based on her age (45) and sex. State X has an FEP law prohibiting sex discrimination; however, neither State X nor the local jurisdiction where CP was employed has an FEP law prohibiting age discrimination. Therefore, CP's charge was timely with respect to her sex discrimination claim but untimely for preserving her private suit rights with respect to her age discrimination claim.\n\n2. EPA\n\nAn individual alleging a violation of the EPA may go directly to court and is not required to file an EEOC charge beforehand. The time limit for filing an EPA charge with the EEOC and the time limit for going to court are the same: within two years of the alleged unlawful compensation practice or, in the case of a willful violation, within three years.(173) This means, of course, that the EEOC should complete its investigation well before the time limit expires, so that the charging party and/or the EEOC will be able to bring a timely lawsuit with the benefit of a completed investigation.\n\nB. Filing Civil Actions\n\nWhile the time frame for filing a private civil action is not a threshold issue in the processing of an EEOC charge, an investigator should notify the charging party about the time frame and requirements for filing in federal court. It is especially important that the investigator notify the charging party of the filing period for an EPA civil action because the filing of an EPA charge does not toll the time frame for going to court.\n\n1. Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA\n\nUnder Title VII or the ADA, a private suit must be brought within 90 days of receiving the notice of right to sue (NRTS). The NRTS will be issued when the Commission has dismissed the charge or failed to enter into a conciliation agreement. An individual can request an NRTS 180 days after the filing of a charge. The EEOC's regulations provide that an individual may request an NRTS before the expiration of the 180-day period if the Commission determines that it is unlikely that it will complete its administrative processing of the charge within 180 days of the filing date.(174) Courts in some jurisdictions, however, have determined that the 180-day waiting period is mandatory and may not be waived by the EEOC.(175) Even in those jurisdictions, a respondent could waive the 180-day period. Therefore, before issuing an NRTS prior to expiration of the 180-day period, an investigator should determine whether courts in that jurisdiction have recognized that the EEOC has authority to do so. If not, an alternative would be to ask the respondent to waive the 180-day period.\n\nSimilarly, under the ADEA, an ag"
