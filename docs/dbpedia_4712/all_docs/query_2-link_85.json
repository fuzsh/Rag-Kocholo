        "text": "01 of 83\n\nLexlee Hudson: Lost 187 Lbs.\n\nCollege was a major adjustment for Lexlee Hudson. Along with gaining more independence, she was also \"stressed, working multiple jobs, and I didn't know what I should be eating.\" That meant she was grabbing what was easy and convenient on a college budget — a ton of pizza and any food she could get during breaks from her waitressing job. And within about a year, she had gained 180 lbs.\n\n\"I started having a lot of health issues,\" she told PEOPLE. \"My back was hurting all the time. I had PCOS and I was on the spectrum for pre-diabetes and high blood pressure. I love to ride horses — I have my entire life — and I couldn't anymore. I became super insecure and withdrawn, and I stopped going out with my friends.\"\n\nMeanwhile, her mom and grandma were both following the weight loss program Optavia and had dropped 80 and 75 lbs., respectively. They had tried getting her on board for years, and in January 2018, after Hudson finished college, she finally agreed to join the program. Hudson started setting alarms for every 2½-3 hours to remind herself to eat healthy snacks, and swapped out the pizza for ones with cauliflower crust or made Taco Tuesdays with lettuce wraps instead of tortillas.\n\nOver the next two and a half years, Hudson consistently lost weight, eventually dropping 187 lbs. She's now a health coach, and helps people \"get healthy.\"\n\n\"I tell people that before I felt like I had a mental cloud over my head. I didn't always put me first,\" she said. \"My whole life has changed.\"\n\n02 of 83\n\nLinda Migliaccio: Lost 189 Lbs.\n\nEver since high school, Linda Migliaccio felt like she was \"battling\" her weight. She started dieting at age 15, and for years afterward, the New Jerseyan, who has since been diagnosed with a binge eating disorder, would yo-yo back and forth — Migliaccio estimates she's lost and gained a significant amount of weight at least 12 times.\n\nHer highest weight of 349 lbs., though, came at \"the lowest point in my life, when my mom passed away,\" she told PEOPLE. While caring for her mom, Migliaccio gained 200 lbs., and after a fall in her bathroom, she tore her ACL and meniscus in her right knee. A surgeon said she was too heavy for him to repair the injury, and predicted that she would become a wheelchair-user in a year if she didn't lose weight.\n\n\"He did me the biggest favor of my life being blunt like that,\" she said. \"It was what I needed to hear, and that's what turned me around.\"\n\nMigliaccio started a nutritarian diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts, and didn't cut out any foods, allowing herself to have a cheesesteak or ice cream when the craving struck. That 80/20 split of healthy and more indulgent foods helped her stay on track, along with her friends and her TOPS (Take Off Pounds Sensibly) weight loss support group. In two years, Migliaccio lost 189 lbs., and didn't even need knee surgery.\n\n\"I'm finally starting to tap into what makes me happy,\" she said.\n\n03 of 83\n\nAnn Wulff: Lost 207 Lbs.\n\nAnn Wulff felt like pregnancy was \"permission to just eat whatever I wanted,\" the teacher told PEOPLE. Through three pregnancies, she gained more than 100 lbs. and kept going from there, eventually hitting 360 lbs.\n\n\"I convinced myself that it didn't matter if I ate unhealthily because I was already overweight,\" she said. \"I was busy with a full-time job and three little girls, so did it really matter if I eat the ice cream?\"\n\nBut Wulff started to notice little issues; she lacked the energy to walk the five minutes to the park with her daughters, she had to twist into odd positions just to get the car seatbelt to buckle and she was struggling with constant headaches.\n\n\"I was in my mid-30s, and I realized that very quickly that there were going to be things that I absolutely could not do.\"\n\nWulff joined WeightWatchers, paying for a full year upfront, and focused on losing just 5 lbs. at a time to stay motivated. With healthy dinner swaps and walks around her neighborhood, she lost 207 lbs. in just over two years.\n\n\"I feel so much lighter, and I don't mean physically,\" she said. \"I just have so much more energy, I'm more positive, I'm more likely to put myself out there. I'm a better teacher, a better wife, a better mother. A better everything.\"\n\n04 of 83\n\nCrystal Benes: Lost 201 Lbs.\n\nCrystal Benes spent most of her life overweight. She was affected by obesity as a child, and by the time she was 25, Benes weighed in at 376 lbs.\n\n\"Every choice I made regarding what I fueled my body with and how much exercised I did was all up to me,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I had no one else to blame for my poor decisions that led me to being nearly 400 lbs.\"\n\nBut that changed on April 2, 2018, when Benes decided to sign up for a local weight loss program in Fort Wayne, Ind. Over 15 weeks, she dropped 100 lbs. thanks to a personal trainer, nutrition coaching and regular boot camp classes. But the hardest part, she shared, is when that ended and she had to do it on her own.\n\n\"I had to understand that this was no longer a diet, and that it had to become my lifestyle,\" she said.\n\nBenes kept up her daily workouts and nutrition plan, and by January, just 10 months later, she was down to 175 lbs.\n\n\"My weight-loss journey came at a point in my life where my weight was something I faced every day and led me to a constant state of depression,\" she said. \"Through the struggle I encountered during my journey, I came to realize that the most difficult road had led to the most beautiful journey of my life.\"\n\n05 of 83\n\nMarsha Parker: Lost 155 Lbs.\n\nAs the single mother of a newborn, Marsha Parker faced a lot of pressure — and it took a toll on her health. The Bronx, N.Y.-based Parker had to accept a lower-paying job with flexible hours so she could take care of her daughter, Kumari, and any money she made went to feeding Kumari healthy meals while she ate $1.25 fried chicken.\n\n\"I was stressed and I think I was going through a bit of postpartum depression without realizing it,\" she told PEOPLE. \"Kumari would be asleep and I would be crying, eating chocolate pudding and drinking Pepsi. I would buy foods that I knew were bad, but they gave me comfort at the time.\"\n\nHer weight continued to climb. By the time Kumari turned five, Marsha was up to 290 lbs., had developed high blood pressure and was pre-diabetic. It was Kumari who pushed her mom to lose weight.\n\n\"I would have headaches from the food and she would say, 'I need you to be healthy, I'm really, really worried about you. Please eat healthy.' I realized that my health was connected to her wellbeing.\"\n\nParker started taking kickboxing classes and switched to a healthier diet, drinking green smoothies with Kumari and prioritizing lean proteins like fish, chicken and eggs. That, along with a newfound love of weightlifting, helped Parker lose 155 lbs. She balanced five-days-a-week workouts with her job as an online teacher, Ph.D. classes and homeschooling Kumari.\n\n\"Kumari saved my life,\" Parker said.\n\n06 of 83\n\nLindy Cellucci: Lost 150 Lbs.\n\nAfter eight years of weighing nearly 300 lbs., Lindy Cellucci reached her breaking point during a vacation with friends in 2014.\n\n\"There's this place called Hopewell Rocks that goes down to the ocean floor, but you have to go down about 500 steps. I stood there and knew I couldn't do it,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I could see them laughing and talking, and I'm up top and I said two words to myself: 'It's time.'\"\n\nThe mother of two began researching healthy recipes and tracking her steps with a Fitbit and lost 82 lbs. in 16 months. That's when Cellucci noticed a suspicious lump on her chest. She was quickly diagnosed with breast cancer and had to undergo rigorous chemotherapy treatment.\n\nBut Cellucci was determined to maintain a healthier lifestyle. When she got the all-clear in 2017 from her doctor, she started walking again and took Zumba, boot camp or aqua swim classes. The weight kept coming off.\n\n\"I lost weight every week for a full year,\" she said. \"I was just determined. If I put a bit on, which happened a couple of times after that first year, I didn't let it derail me. You're going to have ups and downs.\"\n\nCellucci hit 150 lbs. when she was 60 and credited her life to losing weight.\n\n\"I never would have found that lump if I hadn't lost weight,\" she said. \"It saved my life twice. It saved me from having a heart attack, and it saved me because I found that lump.\"\n\n07 of 83\n\nKimberly Brown: Lost 109 Lbs.\n\nWhen Kimberly Brown decided to make a change and lose weight in 2015, she was coming off of a tough year. She had recently suffered a miscarriage, her childhood pet had just died and a broken ankle left her unable to walk on her own for several months.\n\n\"It got the best of me,\" Brown told PEOPLE.\n\nPlus, her health was suffering; Brown had high blood pressure and frequent migraines, and her doctor thought that losing some of her 239 lbs. would help. Brown decided to join Nutrisystem, dropping 10 lbs. the first week and around 2.5 lbs. every week after. Four years later, she was healthier and 109 lbs. lighter.\n\n\"I currently weigh 130, I no longer have to take any medication for my blood pressure and I impress my doctor with my cholesterol and other levels every year on my physical!\" she said at the time. \"I now have confidence in myself, courage to do anything, and pride in how far I have come!\"\n\n08 of 83\n\nJennifer Riveira: Lost 76 Lbs.\n\nJennifer Riveira was always tired and had trouble keeping up with her young son. When her doctor told her all of her tests came back normal, but her fast-food habit may be to blame, she realized it was time to make a change.\n\n\"In reality, I had just given up on myself,\" she told PEOPLE. \"Everybody became more important than I did and fast-food became my way of life. It was fast. It was easy.\"\n\nRiveira cut out greasy food and substituted in meal replacement shakes. She also got active, exercising regularly and keeping up with her teenage son.\n\n\"The challenge itself is to feel better about yourself, to be the best version of you, whoever you are,\" Riveira said.\n\n09 of 83\n\nKristen McLaughlin: Lost 133 Lbs.\n\nWhen Kristen McLaughlin \"became sedentary\" in college, the weight piled on, and it only got worse when she started dating a \"larger guy.\" They would order in for almost every meal — pizzas, burrito bowls, cheeseburgers and fries — and rarely cook, which put McLaughlin at 270 lbs. She joined Jenny Craig in 2016 to lose weight, and managed to drop 60 lbs., but felt guilty that her MBA candidate-boyfriend had to fend for himself, and the weight went right back on.\n\nThen in late 2017, five years into their relationship, McLaughlin's boyfriend became \"distant,\" and said he had feelings for someone else.\n\n\"At that point I'm like, 'This is cheating, this is dumb, I can't do this anymore,' and I said I was leaving,\" she told PEOPLE.\n\nMcLaughlin broke up with him, moved out of their apartment and started a new job. It was overwhelming, but the clean slate she needed to lose weight for good. \"I literally got rid of every excuse that I've ever had,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin joined Jenny Craig again in February 2017, and over the next two years lost 133 lbs. — nearly half her size — with the pre-made meals and a newfound love for group fitness classes and weight training. She now cooks for herself and maintains her weight loss.\n\n\"I think I'm more myself now, funnily enough, than I ever was the previous 30 years,\" she said. \"I say yes to things now, I'm more outgoing, I'm more likely to be social.\"\n\n10 of 83\n\nMary Jane O'Toole: Lost 135 Lbs.\n\nWhen Mary Jane O'Toole got engaged in 2016, she was thrilled to marry her longtime boyfriend, but their relationship hadn't been good for her health. After six years of fast-food dinners and minimal exercise, she weighed 281 lbs. and was having knee problems — at 25 years old.\n\nPlus, O'Toole was dreading buying a wedding dress at her size.\n\n\"I didn't want to buy a plus-size wedding dress, because they cost way more than straight sizes,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I felt like I was paying this fat tax — I didn't have the ability to buy affordable clothes because I was bigger.\"\n\nAlong with her fiancé, O'Toole started tracking her meals and calories with the LoseIt! app. She dropped 75 lbs. in a year, and started incorporating exercise into her routine. By her wedding day in November 2018, O'Toole had lost 135 lbs. and was able to buy the dress of her dreams in a size 6.\n\n\"The ideal dress that I had in my head was cleavage-baring with a dramatic accent, and then I went with a long-sleeved dress that went up to my neck with a bare back. I had never pictured something fitted, but I felt awesome in it because I had done it and lost the weight,\" she said.\n\nO'Toole kept up her weight loss habits, and although she was frustrated with the loose skin she had accumulated, she tried to focus on the \"non-scale victories.\"\n\n\"The biggest one is being able to shop out of my friends' closets — I had never been able to do that before,\" she said. \"It's so cool, it's like I have double the closets, and what I had always dreamt about doing in high school!\"\n\n11 of 83\n\nRandi Vasquez: Lost 80 Lbs.\n\nRandi Vasquez was a \"chubby\" kid growing up, but it never bothered her. \"I was always feeling myself,\" she told PEOPLE. That is until she hit a \"post-grad slump\" when she couldn't find a job she loved and started drowning her sorrows in boozy brunches and fast food.\n\n\"I was getting heavier and heavier,\" Vasquez, who eventually hit 240 lbs., said. \"I started to notice that my confidence was going down, and I wasn't motivated to do anything. It started to click that if I didn't change my life that it would just get worse and worse.\"\n\nVasquez knew that a major diet and lifestyle overhaul wouldn't stick, so she started small, and in the fall of 2014 found a gym class at her local YMCA that she loved. Within a few months, she dropped 18 to 20 lbs., which inspired her to keep going. From there, Vasquez began cooking healthier meals and started doing Kayla Itsines' popular BBG workout plan.\n\n\"Year after year, month after month, I made small little goals and just kept going,\" she said. \"I hit 80 lbs. down in fall 2017. That was such a big moment for me.\"\n\nSince then, Vasquez nailed another big goal — running a half marathon — and remained focused on maintaining her weight.\n\n\"I don't feel like my weight can hold me back anymore,\" she said. \"I was happy before but there was so much I was held back from that I didn't even realize.\"\n\n12 of 83\n\nTara McGinty: Lost 122 Lbs.\n\nTara McGinty would never forget the first time she was bullied about her weight. She was in 8th grade when a ketchup dispenser exploded on her clothes and she had to change into her friend's too-tight shirt.\n\n\"I never ate at school or in front of people again,\" McGinty told PEOPLE.\n\nInstead, she would withhold food from herself until 4 p.m. and then go home and eat \"anything and everything\" in sight until bedtime. McGinty's weight kept crawling up, eventually reaching 260 lbs.\n\nIt wasn't until she was later diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and in so much pain she was unable to hug her children, that she decided to change her lifestyle. She started using Isagenix dietary supplements, going to high-intensity interval training workouts and adopting a \"clean-eating\" diet to reduce inflammation. McGinty dropped to 138 lbs., resulting in her arthritis pain being \"under control.\"\n\n\"Snuggling and cuddling with [my kids] was so painful,\" she said. \"Nowadays I get all the hugs I can and they can even wrap their little hands all the way around my body.\"\n\n13 of 83\n\nAlan Christiansen: Lost 317 Lbs.\n\nAt 538.8 lbs., Alan Christiansen knew his relationship with food was unhealthy. His typical lunchtime meal involved stopping at three fast-food restaurants to satisfy his cravings, totaling over 6,000 calories, and he struggled with everyday tasks.\n\n\"I couldn't stand up in a shower for 10 minutes,\" he told PEOPLE. \"Even doing dishes and cooking required a chair.\"\n\nStill, it was coming home to his 3-and-5-year-old daughters that pushed Christiansen to lose weight. He committed himself to diet and exercise and signed up for Optavia, a coach-based wellness program. In just 18 months, he slimmed down to 221 lbs.\n\n\"I'm a better man, spouse, dad, employee, son, brother and friend to everyone around me,\" he said. \"I truly feel free from my chains that bound me for so many years — free to live the best life and take advantage of what life has to offer.\"\n\n14 of 83\n\nShamirum Benjamin: Lost 151 Lbs.\n\nAt 9 years old, Shamirum Benjamin started sneaking pieces of pound cake from the fridge. The urge to hide her food continued through to her adult life when she would often order entire meals from two fast-food restaurants at a time and eat them in her car.\n\n\"I hid my worst eating habits — overeating or binging to the point of being in pain — so I couldn't be embarrassed about how I ate in front of others. But that doesn't mean I didn't feel shame,\" Benjamin told PEOPLE.\n\nIn February 2011, near her 29th birthday, the customer success manager for a software company hit her highest weight ever, and decided to sign up for WeightWatchers.\n\n\"I changed my mindset,\" Benjamin said. Along with ditching her fast-food meals and eating more fruits and vegetables, she also began walking and doing daily light exercise. Four years later, she had slimmed down from 291 lbs. to 140 lbs.\n\nShe continued to maintain her weight one day at a time and focused on eating foods low on WeightWatcher's point system or limiting portion sizes.\n\n\"I just seem to feel more alive in general,\" Benjamin said. \"I get to be free and myself in a way I never thought I could when I was heavier.\"\n\n15 of 83\n\nJanine Johnston: Lost 145 Lbs.\n\nWhen Janine Johnston tried on the wedding dress she had ordered online, she knew she had to make a change.\n\n\"I wanted to cry because of how I looked,\" she told PEOPLE. \"What was supposed to be a memorable, happy moment was depressing and embarrassing.\"\n\nSo in June 2016, weighing in at 299 lbs., Johnston set a goal to lose 100 lbs. by her wedding a year later. She started by making healthier meals and set a daily step goal on her Fitbit.\n\nOnce the pounds started to fall off, the health services worker joined a local kickboxing gym and supplemented her walking with high-intensity cardio classes.\n\nFive days before her wedding, Johnston met her goal. But she didn't stop there: After her wedding, she continued working out and dieting to slim down to 154 lbs.\n\n\"I'm a much happier person now,\" Johnston said at the time. \"Buying clothes is fun, cooking is fun, and my health is at the best it's ever been.\"\n\n16 of 83\n\nJenna Leveille: Lost 140 Lbs.\n\nAlthough she had a major sweet tooth as a kid, Jenna Leveille always considered herself to be fit and athletic. But after she became pregnant with her daughter in 2000, the global sales director at SpaFinder continued to put on weight.\n\n\"I started trying quick fixes and that's when the vicious crash diets really started,\" Leveille told PEOPLE. \"A few of them worked but just for a minute. I would lose 20 lbs. and gain back double.\"\n\nWhen her weight hit 270 lbs., Leveille considered getting weight loss surgery, but first wanted to try her hand at losing it naturally. She adopted a high protein, low carb diet and began exercising. \"I ditched the sugar and put on my sneakers,\" she said.\n\nShe reached her goal weight of 130 lbs. in 2014, and created a Facebook community called \"Getting Closer Everyday,\" meant to inspire people's weight loss journeys and provide support.\n\n\"The change for me has been more than I could ever dream of in this lifetime,\" she said. \"It's never too late to change your life no matter how long you've been stuck.\"\n\n17 of 83\n\nNicole Ferrigno: Lost 204 Lbs.\n\nNicole Ferrigno grew up thinking \"that chips were a normal side dish, that pasta was a thrice-weekly dinner staple, and that fresh bread was a must for both lunch and dinner.\"\n\nBut by the time she was able to make more autonomous food choices, she was a \"habitual eater.\"\n\n\"I would consume one Big Mac, one McChicken and one large order of French fries [for lunch],\" she told PEOPLE, adding that she would sometimes add another medium order of fries.\n\nAt her heaviest, Ferrigno weighed 350 pounds, and when she was unpacking after moving back to her hometown, she saw an ad for Beachbody's \"21 Day Fix,\" a program that combines portion-controlled eating with 30 minutes of exercise per day.\n\nFerrigno decided to try it out, and slowly but surely she slimmed down. By December 2017, she had reached her goal weight of 146 pounds. Although she primarily sticks to a diet of vegetables and small portions of carbs, \"nothing is off-limits,\" allowing herself to splurge on bites of desserts or small bags of chips.\n\n\"I try dresses on and cannot believe that it is me,\" she said. \"I am so happy with my decision to take care of myself.\"\n\n18 of 83\n\nHolly Wallis: Lost 162 Lbs.\n\nAs a kid, Holly Wallis says she was always \"chubby,\" but it wasn't until high school that she became an \"emotional eater.\" At home, \"the rule was if you put food on your plate you had to finish it before asking to be excused from the table,\" she told PEOPLE.\n\n\"For more than half of my life I've been considered obese,\" Wallis added.\n\nWhen she was 48 years old, Wallis went in for her annual doctor's visit weighing 308 lbs. Her doctor wrote on the after-visit summary that she was \"morbidly obese,\" and suggested options for how she could slim down. \"It made me feel like he really cared about my health and wanted me to be healthy,\" she said.\n\nThat day, she set a goal to lose half her weight by her 50th birthday.\n\nShe began a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb keto diet and tracked her goals, eating habits and exercise in an app called \"Lose It!\" Wallis also opted to bike to work instead of driving and did an additional 30 minutes of exercise each day.

He was in college and often drank alcohol and finished the night off with foods such as chicken wings or sweets and chips. \"I wouldn't think twice about eating two whole pizzas,\" he told PEOPLE. After he lost his first 100 lbs., he and his friends \"celebrated\" at a buffet.\n\n\"I ate at least eight plates full of fried shrimp, crab legs, and hush puppies,\" he said. \"It seemed reasonable at the time.\"\n\nLeopold gradually put the weight back on and reached 363 lbs. He always considered dieting again, but it wasn't until 2015 that he decided to make a lifestyle change since he couldn't catch up with his toddler. \"I tried to run after her but couldn't get above a moderate walk,\" Leopold said. \"All I could do was watch her.\"\n\nHe knew he wanted to be more active in his kids' lives, so he discovered Real Appeal, a digital weight loss program that provides you with coaches and support groups and helps set daily goals for diet and exercise. Leopold stuck to a strict 800-900 calorie diet, (and gradually increased it to 1,300) and went running or walking every day.\n\nAfter dropping down to 170 lbs., Leopold was able to run 5Ks with his daughters and go on hikes. \"I'm happier, healthier, more energetic and far more active,\" he said. \"I can keep up with my girls and be there for them in a way I never could before.\"\n\n20 of 83\n\nKara Cline: Lost 95 Lbs.\n\nWhen Kara Cline started experiencing panic attacks after having her second child, she knew she needed to make a major life change to be healthier for her family.\n\nCline told PEOPLE she worked out vigorously in high school, but when she went away to college, her routine changed.\n\n\"I became complacent and the weight just kept piling on,\" the certified public accountant said. \"I didn't really work out, didn't go for walks and I just hung out with my friends and ate a lot of food I shouldn't have eaten.\"\n\nIn September 2016, after spending a few months reforming her diet, Cline discovered Daily Burn, a health and fitness app that provides workout videos and nutritional guidance.\n\n\"They've got a bunch of different programs you can choose, but then they also have the Daily 365 workout,\" Cline explained at the time. \"It's a 30-minute streaming workout that changes every single day. I really liked that it kept me intrigued and I didn't get bored.\"\n\nCline said she did the workouts at home in her living room three to four times a week while her young kids were nearby.\n\n\"Since they were quick workouts, I fit them in whenever I had time with little ones running around,\" she said. \"I focused on interval training as well as cardio and body-weight exercises. The trainers always offered modifications, so it felt more personable.\"\n\nAfter losing nearly 100 lbs., Cline was proud of her 185-lb. figure.\n\n\"That time was an emotional roller coaster. I moved to a new city. I kind of completely redid my whole entire life, but all for the better. I feel great and am no longer ashamed by my weight,\" she said. \"It really boosted my confidence and my comfort level to just try everything and live a more active, healthy lifestyle.\"\n\n21 of 83\n\nDr. Kevin Gendreau: Lost 125 Lbs.\n\nDr. Kevin Gendreau's motivation for losing weight was rooted in tragedy.\n\n\"When my sister was diagnosed with an aggressive, rare form of cancer, I decided to change my life,\" Dr. Gendreau, who had reached 300 lbs. by consuming \"a diet full of bread, pasta and chips,\" told PEOPLE. \"For me, being obese was a choice. How could I literally eat myself to death while my poor sister was fighting for her life?\"\n\nThe primary care physician started on a high-fat, low-carb diet and tracked his progress through MyFitnessPal.\n\n\"As my sister's condition worsened, I became more motivated than ever to eat healthfully because I knew my niece [Sophia] and nephew [Henry] would need me to be at my best,\" said Dr. Gendreau. Sadly, his sister died in June 2017.\n\nOn his new whole food diet, he saw \"astonishing\" results by eliminating processed carbs and sticking to fruits, vegetables, nuts, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, non-fat Greek yogurt, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and non-caloric spices and seasoning.\n\nAfter his weight hit a plateau, Dr. Gendreau turned to intermittent fasting, which helped him shed the last 50 lbs. of the 125 lbs. he lost. He started eating from only 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. every day. Outside of that window, he would allow himself black tea, black coffee and water.\n\nHe even began recommending his routine to patients. \"Intermittent fasting has been life-changing for many of my pre-diabetic and diabetic patients,\" Dr. Gendreau said. But he cautioned, \"Intermittent fasting is safe for most people, but not everyone. You should definitely talk to your own doctor before starting any diet or exercise plan.\"\n\n22 of 83\n\nBrianna Bernard: Lost 107 Lbs.\n\nWhen Brianna Bernard got pregnant, she \"used it as an excuse\" to indulge in comfort foods.\n\n\"In reality, you're only supposed to eat a couple hundred extra calories a day, but I was eating 1,000 extra,\" Bernard tols PEOPLE for the 2018 \"How We Lost 100 Lbs.\" issue. \"I assumed it would all fall off pretty easily after the baby was born.\"\n\nBut after giving birth to her son, Bernard continued her poor eating habits and \"didn't take the time for self-care,\" she said.\n\nBernard eventually signed up with a personal trainer at the gym, Bodies by Burgoon, and started training two to three times a week in weight lifting, plyometrics, boxing and more. She also revamped her diet, ditching her processed, carb-heavy meals for lean proteins, healthy fats and vegetables.\n\nA year later, she had dropped 100 lbs. and started powerlifting competitively. She even became a trainer at the gym that helped her lose weight.\n\n\"I feel like a completely different person, and I am in so many ways,\" she said. \"Not just physically — that's obvious — but the way I feel in my mind. It's hard to even look back. It feels like a lifetime ago. Now I feel like there's nothing I can't do. If I can lose 100 lbs., I can do anything.\"\n\n23 of 83\n\nRachel Saintfort: Lost 121 Lbs.\n\nRachel Saintfort had never let her weight be a source of stress.\n\n\"In high school, I hit 200 lbs., but I was blessed to be a confident person,\" the Lakeland, Florida native told PEOPLE for the 2018 \"How We Lost 100 Lbs.\" issue.\n\nHowever, she continued to gradually gain weight and reached her highest, 291 lbs., after the birth of her daughter in 2007.\n\nSaintfort decided to try dieting, but nothing stuck. Then, in January 2017, she got a wake-up call. Her daughter, 10 years old at the time, said a classmate had called Saintfort \"fat.\"\n\n\"She looked so sad, and she's trying to act like it wasn't a big deal. At that moment it hit me that she's suffering, and she's being picked on or laughed at because of my laziness or my unhealthy choices,\" Saintfort said. \"That definitely inspired me to get it together, because I didn't want her to feel that way.\"\n\nThe case manager decided to cut out fast food and soda and started doing daily 3-mile walks around the lake in her town.\n\nShe also started documenting her weight-loss journey on her Instagram account, @Ms100Lbs, and set a goal to drop 100 lbs.\n\nLess than 12 months later, she reached her goal. \"I cried,\" she said. \"It was an amazing feeling.\"\n\n24 of 83\n\nGwilym Pugh: Lost 93 Lbs.\n\nAt 280 lbs., Gwilym Pugh was out of shape and living a sedentary life.\n\nAfter a \"five- to seven-year\" weight-loss journey, which included a lot of \"trial and error,\" Pugh lost 93 lbs. and found a new career.\n\nAs a top model and an ambassador for David Beckham's grooming brand House 99, Pugh told PEOPLE he focuses on a diet of micronutrients and good fats, along with manageable exercise.\n\n\"Due to injuries, I've struggled with high-intensity work, but I've found low-intensity cardio pre-breakfast has been great,\" said Pugh, who started seeing an osteopath and a trainer while aiming for 20,000 steps per day.\n\nAs for life as an in-demand model and social media influencer: \"This life is something I had never even thought to dream of,\" said the London-based Pugh. \"Every aspect of my life has improved, from physical and mental health to personal and professional relationships.\"\n\n25 of 83\n\nMariah Stolfi: Lost 84 Lbs.\n\nA self-described \"binge eater,\" Mariah Stolfi reached 150 lbs. by the 5th grade.\n\nThe Wisconsinite also struggled with health issues. In her early teens, she was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and sleep apnea. \"It is extremely difficult to lose weight and maintain weight loss with PCOS,\" said Stolfi, who hit her highest weight of 286 lbs. at age 18. \"And the lack of good sleep caused me to be lethargic, which meant I didn't have the energy to work out.\"\n\nIn July 2017, Stolfi, who was 19 years old at the time, decided to undergo vertical sleeve gastrectomy surgery.\n\nAfter losing 84 lbs. — with hopes to lose an additional 60–70 lbs. — she began sharing her journey on social media.\n\n\"Once I discovered the weight loss surgery Instagram community, I knew I had to be a part of it,\" said Stolfi, whose candid photos and videos have garnered her more than 20,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nAs for her best advice to those struggling with their weight: \"This journey is 80 percent mental and 20 percent physical.

I want to be healthy, but I need help,'\" she said.\n\nAfter the surgery, the weight began to \"melt off,\" said Golding, who eventually dropped 178 lbs. by making healthy dietary changes and exercising.\n\nGolding shared that she is finally at peace with her body. \"I have some loose skin and it definitely has its imperfections, but I worked hard for this body,\" said Golding, who also documented her weight loss journey on Instagram. \"I spent so much time hating it but I've realized that this is the only body I've got and I'm going to take care of it.\"\n\n27 of 83\n\nBonnie Wiles: Lost 162 Lbs.\n\nGrowing up, Bonnie Wiles ate a lot of starchy foods, and by 18, she was over 200 lbs.\n\n\"I tried diets but kept gaining weight after getting married and having four children,\" Wiles told PEOPLE in the 2018 \"Half Their Size\" issue. \"It wasn't until my first grandson was born in 2011 that I committed to get healthy.\"\n\nThe Fayetteville, Ark., resident joined TOPS, a weight loss support group, and started using MyFitnessPal.\n\n\"It tells me if I'm overeating and helps keep track of how much I walk — usually 50 miles a week,\" said Wiles.\n\nAfter dropping to 148 lbs., Wiles shared that she is loving her new lifestyle.\n\n\"When I was heavy, I had to ask for a seatbelt extender on a plane.

Hyman, who was working out with a trainer 3 to 4 times per week, became a finalist in her sixth Isabody Challenge.\n\n\"I fuel my body and don't eat for emotional reasons,\" she said. \"I feel better than I did in my 20s.\"\n\n42 of 83\n\nJovana Borojevic: Lost 139 Lbs.\n\nAlthough she was happy and confident in her body, Jovana Borojevic was shocked when she finally stepped on a scale.\n\n\"I never in my life imagined that I would see a '3' in front of my weight,\" Borojevic, who hit 304 lbs. and had developed fatty liver disease from her fast food-heavy diet, all while dealing with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), told PEOPLE. \"From this day forward, something clicked in me and I changed my life around cold turkey.\"\n\nThe digital marketing strategist immediately cut out starchy carbs, refined foods, sugar and most packaged food. In a month she dropped almost 20 lbs. and started hitting the gym four to five times a week for weight training and cardio workouts.\n\nA year and a half into her weight loss journey, Borojevic was down to 165 lbs., with a goal weight of about 150 lbs.\n\n\"It is SO IMPORTANT to focus on non-scale victories like how your clothes fit, how you feel, how many health issues you've reversed and saved yourself from and how happy you are!\" she said.\n\n43 of 83\n\nAllie Ruby: Lost 98 Lbs.\n\nAllie Ruby was determined to lose weight — and get her long-desired six-pack — after her poor college eating habits left her at 225 lbs. But 98 lbs. later, she still wasn't happy.\n\n\"I always thought that I would love to have a six-pack, and when I got there last year, it wasn't all the fireworks I thought it would be. I thought that would be a huge high, but it wasn't,\" Ruby told PEOPLE.\n\nShe started weightlifting, which kept her in amazing shape but pushed her weight up again, this time with muscle. Seeing the numbers creep back up the scale caused self-doubt.\n\n\"If you have ever lost a substantial amount of weight then gained some back you probably have an idea of that devastating feeling of going backward — I think those feelings were more painful at that time than when I was overweight,\" Ruby wrote on Instagram, adding that it's been helpful to practice mindfulness at this point in her journey. \"I had to remember that a transformation is far deeper than physical.\"\n\nShe switched from weightlifting to powerlifting, which requires extra weight, and was much happier.\n\n\"It's so different because no one cares about your image. It's all about how strong you are,\" Ruby told PEOPLE. \"I love it.\"\n\n44 of 83\n\nJanice \"JJ\" Jobity: Lost 120 Lbs.\n\nJanice \"JJ\" Jobity was always fit growing up, but when she was mistreated in a relationship, she turned to food to cope.\n\n\"I stopped caring for myself as much as I should have,\" the Toronto-based finance project analyst, told PEOPLE. \"I was depressed. I just kind of tuned out of the world, and food became my everything.\"\n\nBy 2015, Jobity had hit her highest weight of 260 lbs. and started feeling excruciating stomach pain.\n\n\"When I went to my doctor they explained I had a stomach ulcer, and that all those years of soda had damaged my stomach,\" she said.\n\nShe decided to get healthy — mentally and physically — taking boot camp classes and seeking counseling to deal with her emotional issues.\n\nJobity cut out fried food and soda in favor of a diet focused on fruits, vegetables and lean protein. \"I love salad and chicken,\" she said. \"Salad and chicken are my everything!\"\n\nShe also started working out six days a week.\n\n\"You have to fix what's going on inside before you can fix the outside,\" she said. \"The mind is a powerful thing through the weight loss journey, more than anything else. A lot of weight loss is mental.\"\n\n45 of 83\n\nNaomi Teeter: Lost 150 Lbs.\n\nNaomi Teeter had struggled with her weight her whole life and found herself weighing more than 300 lbs. by the time she was 26. She ignored her mounting health problems — painful water retention in both her knees, eczema breakouts and nightly bouts of acid reflux — until a doctor's visit that inspired her to make a change.\n\nShe began keeping a food diary and joined a gym. Teeter soon was physically capable of doing things she never thought possible, like running multiple half and full marathons, climbing a mountain and even sky diving. But it wasn't until she ran a naked 5K that she learned to truly embrace her body.\n\n\"It's not often in your life that large groups of people openly accept you and cheer for you despite what your body looks like or your physical ability,\" she told PEOPLE.\n\nTeeter made healthy swaps for junk food and keeps track of her macronutrient intake. The Spokane, Wash.-based health and weight loss strategy coach was staying active with running, hiking and gym sessions.\n\nAs far as advice, Teeter shared not to stress too much about what you're eating — instead focus on how much you're eating. \"I firmly believe that because I didn't have strict food rules, it was easier for me to lose the weight quickly.\"\n\n46 of 83\n\nTara Kavanagh: Lost 145 Lbs.\n\nThe 5'7″ self-employed mom-of-three from Rapid City, S.D., weighed more than 200 lbs. when she started having children, but her pregnancy weight brought her up to 304 lbs. After having her second child, Tara Kavanagh knew she wanted to make a change.\n\n\"I wanted to be an active mother and be able to play with my kids,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I also wanted to live my life, not just exist. I wanted to experience new things and felt my size was holding me back.\"\n\nKavanagh decided she did not want to undergo weight loss surgery after seeing relatives who ended up gaining their weight back. Instead, she focused on finding workouts she actually enjoyed and tracking what she ate, focusing on eating unprocessed, non-GMO and organic as much as possible, and following the 80/20 rule when it comes to eating. \"I still need my treats once in a while!\" she said.\n\nShe also swears by Jillian Michaels' workouts. \"I still do the same workouts as a fit person that I did as a 300-lb. person, I just up the intensity level now to get my killer workout!\"\n\nKavanagh suggested finding a workout you won't get bored with, commenting that \"Jillian's workouts are always fun and I look forward to doing them.\"\n\n47 of 83\n\nHelen Costa-Giles: Lost 90 Lbs.\n\nFor years, Helen Costa-Giles had no real motivation to lose some of her 220-lb. body weight, despite concerns from her doctor. But in 2014, her yearly checkup took a somber turn when the mom of two learned that she was on track to develop chronic health problems because of her size.\n\n\"My numbers were really off the charts and it scared the life out of me,\" Costa-Giles told PEOPLE. \"That was exactly my turning point.\"\n\nDetermined, she immediately threw out all processed and preservative-filled foods and started eating a clean diet. In just six months, with no exercise, she dropped close to 90 lbs. Costa-Giles then added weightlifting to her days and fell in love.\n\n\"My body reacted very quickly to weightlifting, and I started to lean out,\" she said. \"The scale wasn't making huge differences, but the inches were changing. I kind of got obsessed because for the first time in my life, my body was actually doing what I asked it to do.\"\n\nCosta-Giles began running free exercise classes in her hometown of San Antonio at 4 a.m., four days a week, all while maintaining her full-time job in the automotive industry.\n\n\"I have two kids and a full-time job,\" she said. \"I know many people don't start their fitness journeys because they have too many excuses. I like to share my story because it's so relatable.\"\n\n48 of 83\n\nDustin LaJaunie: Lost 150 Lbs.\n\nDustin LaJaunie has come a long way from the 425 lbs. he once weighed.\n\nHe's since lost 150 lbs. and counting with the help of his younger brother Josh LaJaunie, who started the private Facebook support group called \"Missing Chins Run Club.\"\n\nThe group is a safe place for people to share their stories and struggles and motivate one another to lose weight.\n\nEating plan-based and running alongside his brother, Dustin compared the Missing Chins to the trips he and his brother used to take when going hunting. \"But instead of gathering to go take life, we're coming together to gain life.\"\n\n49 of 83\n\nMarie Byrne: Lost 70 Lbs.\n\nThe Gloucester, U.K.-based nursery manager was a longtime emotional eater who found herself reaching a weight of 223 lbs. at only 5'3″.\n\n\"My blood pressure was through the roof,\" she told PEOPLE. \"The doctor said that I was a heart attack or stroke waiting to happen. My mum had a stroke very young, and it scared us as a family. I didn't want to put my family through the same thing, so knew I had to do something.\"\n\nMarie Byrne credits doing at-home Jillian Michaels workouts and decreasing her portion sizes with helping her drop 70 lbs. She also said having a partner with Parkinson's disease inspired her to get her health on track.\n\n\"When we first got together he was going to Pilates and would walk his dog three times a day,\" she said. \"He was way more active than me. What excuse did I have not to exercise when he didn't make any excuses?\"\n\nByrne began counting calories and making sure she eats three healthy meals each day in addition to starting her mornings with Jillian Michaels' workouts at 5 a.m.\n\n\"Sometimes I'm so tired, but once I get into my own head, I push on regardless of how my body feels,\" she said.\n\n50 of 83\n\nBrittany Greenslit: Lost 109 Lbs.\n\nThe office worker weighed 236 lbs. by the time she was pregnant with her first child due to poor eating habits and a lack of physical activity.\n\nAfter complications from her C-section left her depressed, Brittany Greenslit started walking and doing Pilates and yoga to help lift her mood. As soon as she was well enough, she began doing Jillian Michaels' workout DVDs.\n\n\"No matter how sore I was after the workouts, I always showed up the next day ready for more,\" Greenslit told PEOPLE. \"Her saying 'Unless you faint, puke or die, keep going!' became my motto.\"\n\nGreenslit started eating lots of fruits, veggies and protein. If she goes out, she orders a chicken salad instead of her former go-to order of a cheeseburger and French fries.\n\nThe St. Cloud, Minn.-based mom preferred mixing up Jillian Michaels' workout DVDs and running.\n\n\"When I'm challenged, I don't back down,\" she said.\n\n51 of 83\n\nAlicia Steele: Dropped from Size 10 to 2\n\nAlicia Steele, the longtime on-air host, gained weight when she went through menopause.\n\n\"I thought gaining weight and feeling less active as we reached our 50s and 60s (especially after menopause) was just the way it was,\" Steele told PEOPLE.\n\nShe got inspired to lose weight when T-Tapp Method creator Teresa Tapp appeared on a PBS show she was hosting and decided to give her DVDs a try.\n\nSteele dropped four dress sizes using the program and kept the weight off for more than five years. She \"completely changed\" her eating habits, and eats \"lots of colorful, fresh food.\"\n\nBeyond spending 15 to 20 minutes each day working out with the T-Tapp DVDs, Steele's weight loss tip was to try dry brushing: \"This helps with exfoliation, detoxification and improving circulation, which improves fascia fitness,\" she said.\n\n52 of 83\n\nMegan McGee: Lost 70 Lbs.\n\nMegan McGee began gaining weight when she got into an unhealthy relationship and stopped spending time with friends or going to the gym. After getting out of the relationship, she decided it was time to make a change — especially since she worked in the health profession.\n\n\"As a nurse, I wanted to be the healthiest version of myself that I could be,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I didn't want to be a walking contradiction to my patients, promoting healthy living but not being healthy myself.\"\n\nThe Middlesex, England-based nurse decided to join Slimming World to take control of her health. She preferred group exercise classes and began regularly meeting with a personal trainer.\n\nMcGee also went from skipping meals and snacking throughout the day to sticking to set meal times. \"I eat a lot of the same meals as before, but I've learned how to make them differently so they're healthier, like using lean meat and making sauces from scratch,\" she said.\n\nHer biggest tip was to not be afraid to make a change: \"There is nothing to lose and so much life to gain.\"\n\n53 of 83\n\nRebin Roy: Lost 126 Lbs.\n\nRebin Roy told PEOPLE she \"could easily down a pitcher of margaritas and 20 buffalo wings at happy hour,\" and smoked a pack-and-a-half to two packs of cigarettes every day for 14 years.\n\nWhile she quit smoking after getting pregnant with her first child in 2003, she kept her unhealthy eating habits until she began having health problems after having her third child.\n\nShe joined WeightWatchers and dropped from 248 lbs. to 122 lbs. by watching her portions.\n\nRoy began eating six small meals a day while allowing herself the occasional fast food burger by only eating half of it.\n\nTo stay motivated, Roy has competed in bodybuilding competitions.

After dinner, she'd continue to snack on packaged foods like ramen with cheese and more snack cakes. But when she got to college, everything changed.\n\n\"The turning point for me was meeting so many new people and realizing 'Wow, I'm really actually very uncomfortable,' \" the Knoxville, Tenn., resident says.\n\nShe started her weight loss journey on New Year's Day 2013. Using her My Fitness Pal app to log her food, workouts and water intake, Jenkins' daily meals included loading up on protein for breakfast by eating either oatmeal with fruit and peanut butter or a protein shake, and then sticking to lean proteins and small amounts of carbs like sweet potatoes and rice.\n\nJenkins' workouts focused on a hour of cardio each day plus strength training three days a week.\n\n55 of 83\n\nTanisha Washington: Lost 103 Lbs.\n\nTanisha Washington had reached a high weight of 276 lbs. by age 21, but she had always struggled with her weight.\n\n\"I was always the big girl,\" the Austin, Texas, native told PEOPLE. \"I even got the nickname 'Twinkie' in middle school.

Barrett had recently seen a friend's post on Facebook about their success with the weight loss program Slimming World and decided to give it a try.\n\n\"I couldn't believe that I didn't have to starve myself to lose weight,\" she said.\n\nBarrett turned to the Slimming World food optimizing plan. \"Salmon with wild rice and BBQ pulled pork are a couple of my favorites, and I still eat out regularly as well,\" she said.\n\nBarrett, who stuck with long walks and jogging, advised that you should find a plan you can stick to: \"I used to jump from fad diet to fad diet, and they were all so strict and hard to follow.\"\n\n57 of 83\n\nSarah Goodenough: Lost 158 Lbs.\n\nAt 299 lbs., Sarah Goodenough struggled with the physical demands of her job as a nurse and experienced severe body pains and asthma.\n\n\"I thought that was going to be the norm for the rest of my life,\" Goodenough told PEOPLE.\n\nThen she read a book called The China Study about the merits of a plant-based diet, and cut dairy and processed meat out of her diet.
