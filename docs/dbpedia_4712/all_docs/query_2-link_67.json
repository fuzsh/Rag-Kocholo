        "text": "Guys are notoriously hard to shop for, so finding the perfect gifts for the men in your life can be a challenge. What do you buy for the dad who says he needs socks for the fifth year in a row? (Hint: definitely not the socks he’s been buying himself.) Or the brother with a splurge-laden wish list of expensive gadgets and watches? (Hint: neither of those things.) Or the husband who would be happy with no gift at all (or worse, a gift card)? (Hint: not nothing…also, can’t relate!)\n\nThe answer is a set of cozy Bombas socks. Or an Ooni gas-powered pizza oven. Or a stylish Shinola desk clock. Or any of the very covetable presents on this list, which we compiled specifically to please your pickiest, unhelpful-hint-giving (favorite) men. So, without further ado, we present to you the best gifts for men.\n\nShop Our Top Picks\n\nBest for hikers: Snow Peak Gore-Tex Rain Cap\n\nBest for gamers: Samsung 24\" FreeSync Curved Monitor\n\nBest for coffee drinkers: Atlas Coffee CLub Gift Subscription\n\nBest for self-care enthusiasts: Theragun Prime\n\nBest for aspiring chefs: Ooni Koda 12 Gas Powered Pizza Oven\n\nBest bling: Mejuri Square Box Chain Bracelet\n\nBest for travel: Lululemon 2-in-1 Travel Duffle Backpack 45L\n\nShop by section:\n\nAccessories & apparel gifts\n\nHome & kitchen gifts\n\nSelf-care & tech gifts\n\nAccessories & Apparel\n\nQuince Hunter Polarized Stainless Steel Sunglasses\n\nTimeless in shape and chic in material, these sunglasses are an unexpected pop of style. Plus the stainless steel construction means these are super durable. Aside from looking good, they also work hard—these specs block 99% of reflecting light and 100% of UV light.\n\nBellroy Apex Slim Sleeve Leather Wallet\n\nA black leather wallet is expected. But a slim indigo blue design? Just the right kind of surprise. Heat bonding keeps the silhouette slim, avoiding bulky stitching altogether. A strong magnetic closure keeps everything closed.\n\nRains Texel Wash Bag\n\nForget the Dopp kits of yesteryear; this waterproof tote will fit a ton of bathroom essentials. The best part? It folds out and has a hanger, meaning he can attach it to the shower curtain rod or a door handle for easy access.\n\nPaul Smith Multicolor Pencil Cufflinks\n\nSometimes a quirky pair of cuff links is just the thing to take a tried-and-true suit to the next (refreshed) level. We love these tiny pencils and so would any teacher, writer, or fan of nostalgia in your life.\n\nCarhartt Michigan Canvas Coat\n\nThe light blue hue of this classic jacket is perfect for the dude who is always showing up in outfits you find yourself google-ing later. Carhartt is a classic for a reason—the brand has nailed the balance between “lightweight and breathable” and “durable enough to qualify as a family heirloom.”\n\nSnow Peak Gore-Tex Rain Cap\n\nA fully waterproof hat is hard to come by—ask any hiker, cyclist, or Seattleite. This design from Japanese brand Snow Peak has a buckle strap for easy adjustment, a short brim for solid coverage and increased visibility, and there’s a matching pair of pants and jacket (hint, hint).\n\nQuince Onyx Rectangular Ring\n\nSome statement pieces come in small packages—like this 18k gold vermeil ring. It’s subtle enough to pair well with a T-shirt but can pull its own weight with a suit as well.\n\nLululemon 2-in-1 Travel Duffle Backpack 45L\n\nNever underestimate the power of a really good duffel bag. This one seamlessly transforms into a backpack—a massive feature if the guy in your life is often on the go. It’s made with water-repellant fabric, tons of exterior and interior pocket space, a handy water bottle pouch, adjustable straps, and a sleek look that won’t drag their travel outfit down.\n\nSmall Travel Waterproof Carry-On Luggage\n\nWe love Rains for its absolute dedication to waterproof design. Weighing in at seven pounds in an this wheeled carry-on bag has a ton of pockets and space for packing all the essentials.\n\nMen's Mountain Classic Quilted Ankle Boots\n\nIndoor slippers are one thing, but backyard slippers? There’s a concept. Sometimes you just have to hop outside for a second. A supportive footbed paired with fleece lining and a non-slip rubber sole makes these a powerhouse without skimping on maximum loungewear-level comfort.\n\nMejuri Square Box Chain Bracelet\n\nAvailable in sterling silver or 14k gold, this simple bracelet is the perfect accessory for any outfit.\n\nMonogrammed Travel Watch Roll\n\nIf they can’t be seen without their favorite watch (or second-favorite, or third-favorite) fastened around their wrist, upgrade their travel accessory situation with this personalized gift. Made of durable polyurethane exterior and a soft microsuede interior (no scratches here!), there’s enough room for three watches inside.\n\nQuince Mongolian Cashmere Ribbed Beanie\n\nCrafted with Mongolian cashmere, this super soft ribbed beanie is a wintertime staple (we think it would pair perfectly with the brand’s cashmere hoodie). Your man can rock it throughout the winter.\n\nVintage Thermal Henley\n\nWhile sweats will always have their place in a loungewear collection, we’re all about the henleys for cooler temps. Made of woven cotton and available in five rich colors, this tee plays well as a layer or on its own with a pair of jeans. He’ll love the versatility, which is a gift in itself.\n\nNike Men's Therma-FIT Versatile Pants\n\nComfort is the ultimate gift, and these joggers—which are made of a sustainable polyester and come in four colors—will put a smile on their face. Just make sure they toss those old gray sweatpants in return.\n\nGreen & Off-White Stripe Scarf\n\nA luxe scarf is one of those things we’ll always want but won’t necessarily buy for ourselves. But unwrapping a present and seeing the peek of wool and fringe? You won’t find many people who wouldn’t be delighted to open up a stylish scarf. This design from Acne Studios is the perfect pop of color for any look.\n\nEberjey William Tencel Modal Long PJ Set\n\nAgain, pajamas and loungewear are always a treat—especially when they’re insanely soft like this sustainable Tencel Modal Eberjey set. The matching button-down top and pull-on bottoms feature white piping for a classic look.\n\nBombas Men's Merino Wool Blend Quarter Socks\n\nOne serious pop of color paired with a tried-and-true neutral—this is what a gift set of socks should be. Made of a super comfortable merino wool blend, they’ll feel like they’re walking on clouds all day long.

This wallet doubles as a magnetic stand, meaning they can flip their phone into viewing mode in an instant.\n\nPatagonia Synchilla Fleece Gloves\n\nIf his favorite T-shirts and pullovers come from Patagonia, these gloves in the brand’s warm Synchilla recycled fleece material will likely be a winner.\n\nHome & Kitchen\n\nAtlas Coffee Club Gift Subscription\n\nThis gift subscription from Atlas Coffee Company will supply him with three-to-twelve months of the best beans around. You'll be able to select when shipments start and each delivery postcards and tasting notes.\n\nFive Two Barware Essentials Set\n\nMaybe he’s been dropping hints about a new cocktail-making hobby—or maybe you’d love for someone else to make the drinks every once in a while. Whatever it may be, this set of wine markers, a magnetic felt drip catcher, brass bottle stoppers, wine bottle tote, felt coasters, and bottle opener is a more subtle nudge.\n\nBodum Chunky Wine Glasses\n\nSometimes all a hangout needs is a pair of cute, chunky wine glasses. In fact, there are few situations inappropriate for said drinking vessels. We love that they’re dishwasher-safe and colorful without going overboard—you won’t need to think twice about whether or not they will fit in with the rest of their dinnerware.\n\nHouseplant Green Ridge Ashtray\n\nSmoking accessories don’t get more luxe than the designs coming from Houseplant. This particular ashtray’s shape is inspired by a salty snack—who knew ridges could provide such a picturesque holding spot for a cigarette or joint?\n\nBraun Classic Analogue Wall Clock\n\nWe all have that friend who is constantly late. This wall clock probably won’t help that cause, but its slight utilitarian vibe makes it a designer-level addition to any room.\n\nSaltverk Salt Cellar\n\nThere are some things you look at, lust over, and never buy for yourself because why opt for a $50 version when the $5 design you have at home works just fine? This is where gifting becomes such a beautiful thing. This salt cellar was a collaboration between Icelandic design team Hugdetta and a group of artists in Sierra Leone. The glazing on the vessel feels slightly Icelandic, which is entirely fitting.\n\nMake Your Own Hot Sauce Kit\n\nIt seems like there are only two sides to the hot sauce spectrum: You either love it—like “can’t get enough heat” kind of obsession—or you avoid it at all costs. For the former, this set will let them tweak that liquid gold within an inch of the preference.\n\nEmber Temperature Control Smart Mug\n\nNo one likes lukewarm coffee. In lieu of a boring water bottle, keep your man’s java piping hot with this temperature control smart mug that you can operate with a smartphone. And thanks to Amazon’s speedy shipping, we think it would make an especially nice last-minute gift.\n\nOoni Koda 12 Gas Powered Pizza Oven\n\nIt’s not a car, but your brother will feel like he’s on Top Chef with this gas-powered pizza oven that reaches an impressive 950 degrees in 15 minutes and cooks a 12-inch pie in just 60 seconds.\n\nCorkcicle Chillsner Two-Pack\n\nBeer bottles, on the other hand, are best kept chilled with Corkcicle’s Chillsner, an icy stick that you pop in the freezer (and a best seller from our Father’s Day gift guide). Paired with a few nice beer glasses, this two-pack is a unique gift that ensures your beer lover will never sip warm brew again.\n\nAsh Boy Smells Candle | 50 Hour Long Burn\n\nThere aren’t many spaces that can’t be bettered with a candle.

A curved monitor is one of those tools—this one, in particular, is designed to provide a hi-res panoramic view. Samsung also used a nifty little thing called Active Crystal Color technology, which helps provide a more vivid display for seeing well in the dark of night or bright light of day.\n\nTherabody Pink Theragun mini Hand-Held Massager\n\nIf he works out and travels a lot, this tiny muscle massager will become his best friend on the road. It may be small in size, but this Theragun packs a ton of power into its three foam attachments. Plus its Bluetooth capability means you can connect it to the Theragun app for personalized use recommendations.\n\nFischersund No.23 Fragrance\n\nEveryone likes to smell good, but not all who wear a scent get stopped in the middle of a grocery store aisle to be asked about said fragrance.

Feed that habit with a set that delivers everything they’ll need for impromptu games of pickleball. The paddle is made with a lightweight (and durable!) fiberglass and the sanded texture means they can perfect their spin shot.\n\nBose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones\n\nTechies will never refuse an upgrade to their headphones. When it comes to tech gifts, there are lots of audio options out there, but these over-ear ones from Bose offer world-class noise cancellation, Bluetooth pairing they won’t have to fight to actually use, and a noise-rejecting microphone system. It’s a whole lot of power in a beautiful package. Go forth and skip the Apple Watch in favor of something a bit different.\n\nCreate Your Own Reel Viewer\n\nFor an old-school gift, consider going with a toy that speaks to their sentimental side.

Whatever it is, they’ll love taking this stroll down memory lane.\n\nHatch Restore 2 Bedside Light, Sound Machine & Sunrise Alarm Clock\n\nGetting up is hard and anyone who says otherwise is (probably) lying a little bit. The Hatch lamp helps make it a little easier, probably because it’s a full-fledged wake-up machine in one tiny package. Not only can the user set the traditional alarm, but there’s a time-activated light “alarm” that makes it feel like a little sliver of the sun has slipped right into the room. To round things out, the sound machine is great for lulling people to sleep.\n\nLoftie Alarm Clock\n\nWaking up is slightly easier when you have an alarm clock that houses meditations, breath work circuits, Bluetooth speaker capabilities, and a gentle two-step system for jostling someone out of sleep. This is that alarm clock.\n\nBraun Series 9 9370cc Rechargeable Wet & Dry Men's Electric Shaver\n\nThis swanky trimmer to replace his disposable razor is an investment in the long run.
