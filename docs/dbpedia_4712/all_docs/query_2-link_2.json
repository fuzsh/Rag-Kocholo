        "text": "First founded by Vittorio Sattui in 1885 and re-established in 1976 by Vittorio’s great-grandson Dario, V. Sattui is one of Napa Valley’s most historic wineries. Our winery and vineyard estate is where generations come together to share food, wine, friendship, and the warmest hospitality in the valley.\n\nWe make highly rated wines that appeal to a wide range of tastes, with options for every palate. We’re one of the few wineries in the valley that sells our wines only via our winery – you won’t find them in stores or at restaurants. We craft our wines in small lots, yet still offer one of the largest selections in the valley, combining sustainable and organic vineyard practices and a mix of time-honored and technologically advanced techniques to make wines with depth of flavor, complexity, and richness.\n\nOur estate is the perfect place to celebrate life’s milestones, with an iconic stone tower, beautiful gardens, and terraces for events big and small. We’re one of the only Napa Valley wineries that host weddings, and our wonderful staff and Michelin-starred Italian chef sees to every detail. The warm, intimate atmosphere of our subterranean aging cellar offers another unique venue for special occasions, birthdays, or retirement dinners. Our events truly offer a taste of the good life.\n\nWe call our estate and vineyards the “Napa D’Italia” Experience – a place to discover, share the bounty with friends and family, and experience our wine the way you want to. Whether you’re a sipper or connoisseur, we have a wine experience for you, along with beautiful picnic grounds and an artisan deli that carries everything you could ever want to picnic upon – the ultimate Napa Valley experience.\n\nAs a historic, family-owned business, caring for the environment, the community, and the next generation is both a privilege and a responsibility. We are stewards of the Napa Valley environment through our sustainable farming practices and conservation efforts, and we foster education and support of local winemaking and youth communities through several on-estate and local programs."
