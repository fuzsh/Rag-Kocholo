        "text": "Sprouting Acres is proud to offer hand-tossed, wood-fired pizza, other house-made food items, cold bevvies, and live music out on the farm on the first and third Sundays (only) from 2:30-8:00 pm, seasonally from May through October.\n\nIt’s delightfully clear to us that Cambridge’s secret is out, and our pizza nights have become a wildly popular community event. Pro-tip for our newcomers: Pre-planning will best set you up for a your most enjoyable experience! Read on:\n\nONLINE PRE-ORDERING goes live one week in advance of the next pizza night – watch for the email notification (or check our website) the prior Sunday morning/early afternoon. We normally sell out of our pre-order availability within 12-24 hours, often less! Best way to get notified? Subscribe to our farm email list (scroll to the very bottom of this page, fill out the yellow box!)\n\nWALK-IN ORDERS: We highly recommend placing your order in advance, BUT we do save some availability for walk-in orders. However, please know that walk in orders are limited and normally sell out on the earlier side of the day. So, if you are hoping for a walk-in pizza order, try to come closer to 3:00p than 7:00p, if you catch our drift! :)\n\nOur busiest time is between 4:00-6:30 pm, so expect longer wait times (30-60 minutes) if you walk-in without a pre-order during that time period.\n\nIf you miss both the online pre-order window and our walk-in pizzas are sold out by the time you get here, we do offer a limited variety of other food items to choose from, such as sandwiches, salads, and treats.\n\nYou can make a day/night of it with us, enjoy our land, and play and dine on the farm; OR you can get your order for takeout!\n\nPlease use our online ordering system!\n\nOnline ordering opens the Sunday morning/early afternoon prior to the next pizza night. If you are subscribed to our farm email list, you will get an email as soon as the pre-ordering is live.\n\nOnline orders close at 8:00 pm the night before pizza Sunday – BUT normally all pre-order spots are reserved well before then, in which case the ordering window closes early.\n\nThis doesn't mean we are completely sold out… it does mean that the remainder of our spots are for (limited) walk-in orders only on the day of event.\n\nOur busiest time is between 4:00-6:30 pm, so expect longer wait times (30-60 minutes) if you walk-in without a pre-order during that time period.\n\nNote that we do NOT accept call-in orders.\n\nIf you pre-ordered online, your food will be ready around the time you reserved. Please pay attention to the time, so you can pick it up promptly, fresh and hot out of the oven! If you have been waiting more than 15 minutes past your pre-order time, please come check in with a staff member.\n\nIf you placed a walk-in order, your wait time will vary. Your order will be added to the first available hour time slot; the cashier can tell you which hour time slot your order will be added to. (Example: if you order at 5pm and get the 6pm time slot, you will get your pizza between 6-7pm.) If you have been waiting past your hour time slot, please come check in with a staff member."
