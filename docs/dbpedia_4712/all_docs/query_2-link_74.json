        "text": "MAPLE SHADE —Passersby may have noticed something different about a longtime restaurant here — signs advertising the closing of Uno Chicago Grill.\n\nAccording to the restaurant, May 19 was Uno's last day before it becomes a TR's Taphouse, also known as a Tony Roni's Pizzeria.\n\nThe Uno Pizzeria & Grill chain, with a remaining South Jersey location in Deptford, traces its roots to a Chicago eatery that offered distinctive deep-dish pizza in 1943.\n\nThe Maple Shade location will remain under the same management and ownership, said Angela Bock, vice president of business development for the project.\n\nThe new restaurant is expected to open in the first week of June, she said.\n\nTony Roni's has a location in South Jersey, as well as sites in Pennsylvania.\n\nBock said the new restaurant will have a (slightly different) pizza menu, but also a bar to expand its offerings while remaining family oriented.\n\nBock said the switch will still honor kids' programs, craft nights and other family-centric activities.\n\nA crew could be seen at the Route 73 business Monday morning on the remodel.\n\n\"The whole restaurant will look similar but be fresh and bright,\" Bock said.\n\nMore: 2 new restaurants on their way to this Camden County town\n\nMore: Hollywood comes to Cape May for new Bob Dylan film\n\nKaitlyn McCormick writes about trending issues and community news across South Jersey for the Courier-Post, The Daily Journal and the Burlington County Times.
