Designed by Vancouver’s Simcic Uhrich Architects, our newest space is the largest Virtuous Pie location to date. At over 2,300 square feet, it has 73 seats, a 653 square foot outdoor patio opening this spring, and a communal bar area featuring local craft beers, wines, and cocktails. Join us to indulge in our signature plant-based pizzas, ice cream, and small plates, plus unique menu items exclusive to Victoria!\n\nPatio dining is closed for the season and will resume in Late June 2024. In the meantime, Virtuous Pie takeout can be enjoyed at Whistle Buoy Brewing’s dog-friendly patio across the street."
