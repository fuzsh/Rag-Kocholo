        "text": "Soundcloud Thumbnail (if applicable) Song Title Use/Purpose Composer Notes Time for a Smackdown! Opening theme Mr. Sauceman Uses leitmotifs from Pizza Mayhem. Pizza Deluxe! Title screen Post Elvis Only (present) used song made by Post Elvis. Most of the voice samples used to be of Wario's voice in an earlier version. Leaning Dream Pause screen ClascyJitto (Frostix) This song samples drums from both Rav's \"MAKESHIFT EDEN\" and Rare Earth's \"I Just Want To Celebrate\".\n\nThe outdated version is very different from the new version, being roughly 2 minutes in length. Simply referred to as \"Space\" on the Steam Soundtrack, which was the name of the song back when it was meant to be used in Deep-Dish 9 before getting replaced by Extraterrestrial Wahwahs. It was later repurposed as the pause screen music.\n\nfuniculi holiday Tutorial ClascyJitto Made to replace Dim Widdy's cover of \"Funiculi, Funicula\" used in the game previously. The name of this song uses uppercase on the SoundCloud upload despite being in all lowercase everywhere else. Mondays Tower Lobby Mr. Sauceman This is the only floor theme to appear in pre-release builds of the game. Unearthly Blues John Gutter Mr. Sauceman Originally named \"From The Top.\" The stock screams used near the end are the same ones used in Hot Spaghetti. Older versions of the song include a voice sample of President Koopa, played by Dennis Hopper in the Super Mario Bros. Movie from 1993, saying the word \"Monkey\", along with a voice sample of Jim grumbling after getting a game over from Earthworm Jim. An Entrance Secret John Gutter Secret ClascyJitto For an unknown reason this track doesn't feature any instruments aside from the drums heard in every secret theme. Fans have created their own version of this song featuring the instruments. Meatophobia When a player is near Pillar John / Final Judgement / Bacon room Mr. Sauceman Originally only played at the end of Bloodsauce Dungeon. The song itself is a heavily slowed down version of an orchestra hit sample being played at two different pitches. It's Pizza Time! Pizza Time (except for The Crumbling Tower of Pizza) Mr. Sauceman The \"Hello there\" voice sample, clock ticks, and bells used in the pre-release versions are from Wario Land 4. The \"yall ready to get funky\" can be heard in Set Me Free(Do That To Me). First appeared in the Earlytestbuild and has gone through several revisions, with the first version using some of Wario's voice samples. In the release version, the \"hello there\" sample was replaced by an imitation voiced by Kyoobot. The Death That I Deservioli Pizza Time (Lap 2) Mr. Sauceman The oldest version which can be played in the Halloween Demo's party room was titled \"Escape Theme 2\". Another old variant was once used as the music for the Mansion level's scrapped Pepperman boss. One more old version of this song is known to exist, which went by the name \"Nonagression\", that's closer to the final game's version but has several different instruments and additional vocals. Was once planned to be used when the combo counter went above 50 before the W rank system was scrapped. Your Fat Ass Slows You Down Time's Up screen Mr. Sauceman This song was composed later in development as most prior versions including versions as late as The Eggplant Build used \"Bankrupt\" as the Time's Up theme. Victorious Degenerate Rank Screen Mr. Sauceman The last second of the D Rank variant of this theme was originally cut off in-game (from Demo 2 - Hardoween - Eggplant Build) and couldn't be heard normally. Hot Spaghetti Pizzascape Mr. Sauceman Includes some stock screams that were also used in Earthworm Jim's \"What The Heck\" muzak section. Said level takes place in Hell, which is what the name \"Hot Spaghetti\" may be referencing. An older version with less instruments was used in Demo 2. Cold Spaghetti Pizzascape Mr. Sauceman First appeared in Demo 1 and has gone through perhaps the most iterations of all Pizza Tower songs. Originally contained a different intro and used Wario voice samples before several more replacements were done. hmmm look what u done did you found a secret :) / A Medieval Secret Pizzascape/Pizzascare Secret ClascyJitto Was originally a universal secret theme to be used in all levels before they each got their own. Theatrical Shenanigans The Ancient Cheese Mr. Sauceman The oldest of all stage music in Pizza Tower, dating back to the Earlytestbuild. The song in this version was used all the way until one of the later Patreon demos, where it was replaced by a new revision with a softer sax instrument as the main melody. The name of this track would change multiple times throughout development, some of its earlier titles including \"One Pizza at a Time\" and \"In Search of Pizza\" Put On A Show!! The Ancient Cheese ClascyJitto This is one of the few songs which uses a recording of a real guitar being played by ClascyJitto. A Secret Under The Debris / A Ruin Secret The Ancient Cheese Secret ClascyJitto Dungeon Freakshow Bloodsauce Dungeon ClascyJitto The main bassline of the song is remarkably similar to the bassline from The Beastie Boys' Intergalactic. Until the Eggplant Build, there were less filler instruments. A Hidden Pepperoni In The Cage / A Dungeon Secret Bloodsauce Dungeon Secret ClascyJitto Pepperman Strikes! Pepperman battle Mr. Sauceman The older version used in Demo 1 had a much more \"retro\" aesthetic. Its original name was Threat On a Leaning Tower. Tuesdays Western District Lobby Mr. Sauceman Oregano Mirage Oregano Desert ClascyJitto Originally named \"Ancient Tower\". This song was used to troll viewers twice on ClascyJitto's YouTube channel before the actual song was uploaded. Oregano UFO Oregano Desert ClascyJitto This song is only used in one room making it the least used level theme tied with \"Gustavo\". A Grain of Bread in a Grain of Sand / A Desert Secret Oregano Desert Secret ClascyJitto Tombstone Arizona Wasteyard Mr. Sauceman This song is named after Tombstone, Arizona. Their motto is \"The Town Too Tough To Die\" which refers to its history of violent gunfights. An Undead Secret Wasteyard Secret ClascyJitto Mort's Farm Fun Farm ClascyJitto The version that played on Thing of the Week 9 is different than the one in-game, featuring a louder whistle that was softened after several complaints.\n\nThis song's main melody was taken from Jason's Theme from Home Movies.\n\nWhat's on the Kids Menu? Fun Farm ClascyJitto This level was originally planned to be used for Don't Make A Sound, while the level was called Kids' Party (thus the name). A Secret In The Chicken / A Farm Secret Fun Farm Secret ClascyJitto This was the first PT Song on ClascyJitto's channel to contain a spin-off of the \"missing pizza tower ost disc\" running gag on her channel, that being the CD being so comically big that it's as large as the video window. Yeehaw DeliveryBoy Fast Food Saloon ClascyJitto The \"Don't underst\" and \"hey what's going on here\" samples are from the Sneakman song from Jet Set Radio .\n\nThis song has an unused alternate outro which can be listened to here.\n\nA Secret in my Boot / A Saloon Secret Fast Food Saloon Secret ClascyJitto Its name references Woody's famous line from Toy Story, \"There's a snake in my boot.\" Calzonification The Vigilante battle Mr. Sauceman The song's name may be a nod to the song \"Californication\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nIt may also be a reference to the concept of spaghettification, since a calzone is another Italian food.\n\nWednesdays Vacation Resort Lobby ClascyJitto This is the first floor theme to be composed by ClascyJitto. Tropical Crust Crust Cove Mr. Sauceman An early version of the song exists which lacks some instruments heard in the final song, as well as the intro. A Secret in the Sands Crust Cove Secret ClascyJitto The bass in the beginning's background is the same as \"hmmm look what u done did you found a secret :)\", possibly referencing a well fitting mashup ClascyJitto made between Cold Spaghetti and Tropical Crust. mmm yess put the tree on my pizza Gnome Forest (Peppino) ClascyJitto The main part of the song uses the same chord progression from Tyler, The Creator's Jamba (0:51). gustavo Gustavo tutorial ClascyJitto Parts of the song seem to use instruments from the tracks in Papa Louie games. Wudpecker Gnome Forest (Gustavo) ClascyJitto The leitmotif of \"mmm yess put the tree on my pizza\" can vaguely be heard throughout the song. Before release, this song was known as \"!Gnome Forest?\". Everybody Wants To Be A Secret / A Secret in The Trees Gnome Forest Secret ClascyJitto The title of this song references the lyrics of \"Superstar\" by Young Thug - a mashup of which with \"Sneaky Snitch\" by Kevin MacLeod was used in a meme video made by GuyTheMind that used the Gnome Forest title card with the text \"Lario\" above it. Extraterrestrial Wahwahs Deep-Dish 9 Mr. Sauceman This song was originally planned for Space Pinball before being moved to Deep-Dish 9.\n\nOlder versions of this song featured an entirely different intro. The guitar solo in this song is inspired by the Daft Punk song \"Aerodynamic\".\n\nAn outdated version of the song can be heard in the Western Build.\n\nThis song was originally named \"Extraterrestrial Wahs\", though it was later changed to avoid association with the Mario series' Waluigi.\n\nAn Interstellar Secret / An Space Secret / idk what to call this but its da secret in da pinball level Deep-Dish 9 Secret ClascyJitto The old title of this song references the Space Pinball level because the title was decided before the track was moved to Deep-Dish 9. Good Eatin' GOLF ClascyJitto Was originally composed for a scrapped Restaurant/Kitchen level before the level theme was combined with that of Golf. There exists an older version with a slightly different melody. A Secret Hole in One GOLF Secret ClascyJitto This secret theme features a synth instruments not heard it any other secret theme. Pumpin' Hot Stuff The Noise battle Mr. Sauceman An older version of this song was used for the Noise mini-boss in the Peppino's Xmas Break demo, titled \"Pimpin' Hot Stuff\". The older version notably used a Santa Claus-like laugh instead of the maniacal one in the final version. Apparently, somebody's child was conceived due to this song. Ooooh La Belle Noisette! The Noise battle ending cutscene Mr. Sauceman A cover of \"uh oh, here comes the noise\". French for \"Ooooh The Beautiful Hazelnut!\" Thursdays Slum Lobby ClascyJitto Bite the Crust The Pig City (Peppino) Mr. Sauceman Originally used as Oh Shit!'s second song, before being moved into The Pig City instead. The song's name and bassline is a clear nod to \"Another One Bites the Dust\" by Queen and was actually given by PTG himself after Sauceman posted a teaser of it in the TOTW channel. Way of the Pig The Pig City (Gustavo) Mr. Sauceman Before release and in its filename, this song was named \"Way of the Italian\".\n\nIn an older version, there was a part of the song that used the dog \"woof\" note from Mario Paint, made famous by Undertale's \"dogsong\". In the first revision of the song, this is replaced by the cat \"meow\" note from the same game. In the second revision of the song (used in the final game), pig sounds are used instead.\n\nA Secret In These Streets The Pig City Secret ClascyJitto Pizza Engineer Peppibot Factory Mr. Sauceman Uses metallic clang and engine sounds for the industrial feel, adding square waves to the mix as well.\n\nThe \"Somebody scream!\" vocal sample used in this song comes from the DJ D2 song La Karabina, and was previously popularised by its use in Second Heaven by Ryu☆.\n\nPeppino's Sauce Machine Peppibot Factory Mr. Sauceman Many people have heard the words \"Door Stuck\" in this song, which is a line from a Counter-Strike video from 2007 with the same name. This led to a parody of this song, Peppino's Door Problem, which uses the words \"door stuck\" from that video. The samples in question actually say \"Don't Stop\", with the full sample being \"Don't stop droppin' the beat!\". The old version of the song (that Peppino's Door Problem is based on) lacks some instruments. An Industry Secret Peppibot Factory Secret ClascyJitto Tubular Trash Zone Oh Shit! Mr. Sauceman An earlier version of this track exists with less instruments and a vastly different guitar solo. The \"come on\" sample used is the same one used in Sonic 3 for the Genesis. It had a few early titles, such as \"Toxic Land Zone\" and \"Toxic Pepperoni\". A Fecal Secret / A Sewer Secret Oh Shit! Secret ClascyJitto dont preheat your oven because if you do the song wont play Refrigerator-Refrigerador-Freezerator ClascyJitto This song was originally going to be more sinister and dark before ClascyJitto made a completely different song that fit the level more. This song was inspired by Toastopia from the PikuNiku soundtrack. ClascyJitto made a reference to this song in one of her solo works. Celsius Troubles Refrigerator-Refrigerador-Freezerator ClascyJitto On the Rocks Refrigerator-Refrigerador-Freezerator Mr. Sauceman This song is used when Peppino eats the Pepper Pizza found near the level's Pillar John. If the player waits out the full song before entering Pizza Time Celsius Troubles will resume playing. The reason this happens is because this song was never finished, so it doesn't have a proper looping point. A Frozen Secret Refrigerator-Refrigerador-Freezerator Secret ClascyJitto Pizza Time Never Ends!! Fake Peppino battle ClascyJitto Was originally meant for the first part of The Crumbling Tower of Pizza under the name \"pizza time bro u know this u remember this\" Okay Campers, Rise and Shine! Fake Peppino chase sequence Mr. Sauceman The name of this song is a reference to the movie Groundhog Day according to Mr. Sauceman. In the game's files, the last couple of seconds re-use the ending from Pizza Mayhem, but this is never heard in-game or in any OST release, with the song looping and fading out respectively. Fridays Staff Only Lobby Mr. Sauceman There's a Bone in My Spaghetti! Pizzascare Mr. Sauceman This song is a remix of Hot Spaghetti. It's one of the only songs that appears in newer public demos to not be uploaded to Mr. Sauceman's YouTube channel, along with Pimpin' Hot Stuff and Unearthly Blues; also, the original version of this theme that was made for Noise's Hardoween had less instrumental effect. Tunnely Shimbers Don't Make A Sound Mr. Sauceman Originally meant for a level titled Lights Out. Hard Drive to Munch You Don't Make A Sound Mr. Sauceman Plays when a Toppin Monster is alerted. A Secret You Don't Want To Find Don't Make A Sound Secret ClascyJitto Thousand March WAR Mr. Sauceman Heavily inspired by Justice/Mr. Oizo. My Secret War Crimes / A War Secret WAR Secret ClascyJitto Pizzaface Hall Final hallway before the Pizzaface battle ClascyJitto The name of this song is currently unknown. This song also plays in the short corridor before The Crumbling Tower of Pizza, As they are within the same room. Unexpectancy (Part 1 of 3)\n\nUnexpectancy (Part 2 of 3)\n\nUnexpectancy (Part 3 of 3) Pizzaface battle, Pizzahead battle, and World's 1 - 4 rematch Mr. Sauceman This song is split into three distinct \"phases\", one for each phase of the boss battle.\n\nThe first phase (for the Pizzaface battle) is a rework of \"Calculator Fight\", a song that Mr. Sauceman composed before he joined the Pizza Tower team.\n\nThe second phase (for the first Pizzahead phase) samples \"After You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It\" by Irving Berlin and Van & Schneck.\n\nThere was also an early version of Part 2 which would never see the light of day that has very minimal difference in instruments, a slightly extended part to the beginning that was never put into the track, and included a placeholder Japanese Ronald McDonald voice in place of \"After You Get What You Want, You Don't Want It\".\n\nThe third phase (for the boss rush and final Pizzahead phase) uses leitmotifs from \"The Death That I Deservioli\", \"Hot Spaghetti\"/\"Cold Spaghetti\"/\"There's A Bone In My Spaghetti!\", \"Oregano Mirage\" , \"Don't Preheat Your Oven Because If You Do The Song Won't Play\"/\"Celsius Troubles\" and \"Tombstone Arizona\". Part 3 is itself divided into two halves with the second one playing during rematch with Pizzahead.\n\nThis is by far the longest song in the game.\n\nBye Bye There! The Crumbling Tower of Pizza Mr. Sauceman This song heavily uses leitmotifs from \"It's Pizza Time!\". The track's name is likely a reference to the \"Hello there!\" Wario Land 4 sample that was replaced with a soundalike in the final version of \"It's Pizza Time!\". Pizza Pie-ing Ending cutscene ClascyJitto This song has a leitmotif of The Death That I Deservioli, along with the main melody from Julius Fučík's \"Entry of the Gladiators\". Before being repurposed for the ending cutscene, this song was used for a cut Circus level. Bumbling in the Dark (music_null) True Ending cutscene Mr. Sauceman Originally going to be the dance room's theme in the Halloween Demo, Briefly featured in the ending cutscene that happens when the player finishes the game with all secret treasures. Not featured on the game's official OST pages. Receding Hairline Celebration Party Credits Mr. Sauceman This song is a rework of the unused song \"I Ain't Got No Time to Dance\". Hip to be Italian Final judgement rank Mr. Sauceman Originally composed for a scrapped kitchen level. Secret Lockin' Secrets of The World ClascyJitto Contains leitmotifs from \"Choosing the Toppins\", \"Hot Spaghetti/Cold Spaghetti/There's a Bone In My Spaghetti!\", \"Put On a Show!\", \"Theatrical Shenanigans\", \"A Secret in the Chicken\", \"Yeehaw Deliveryboy/A Secret In My Boot\", \"Tropical Crust\", \"Wudpecker\", \"dont preheat your oven because if you do the song wont play\", \"Way of the Pig\", and \"It's Pizza Time!\" The Bone Rattler Tricky Treat lobby Mr. Sauceman The Runner Tricky Treat level theme Post Elvis Image Song Title Use/Purpose Composer Notes snick sits down and talks to you about his video game, snick the porcupine: the song Song that wasn't meant to be in the game ClascyJitto \"I wanted to have a song on the album snick's album that wasn't even a part of the game because that idea sounded really cool to me. So i sat down and made some beautiful jazz shit lol\" - ClascyJitto Small Fruit, 5 PM Pizzascape escape sequence Mr. Sauceman Was also used in the Ancient Challenge in Demo 2. This song, along with several other unused tracks, were made for the idea of each level having it's own unique escape theme. As It's Pizza Time was praised by fans and the idea gave the composers more unnecessary workload, the idea was scrapped. The song's title is a reference to \"Big Apple, 3 AM\" from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles In Time. Toxic Rave Oh Shit! escape sequence ClascyJitto Running With Pockets Full of Meatballs Peppibot Factory escape sequence Mr. Sauceman The version of this song used in the Factory Challenge in Demo 2 had a heavier focus on the ticking sample.

Theatrical Mischief The Ancient Cheese ClascyJitto Was originally the second theme for The Ancient Cheese, before being replaced by Put On A Show!!. Pimpin' Hot Stuff (Old) The Noise battle (Strongcold) Mr. Sauceman The siren sound appears to be the same one from the JPN/PAL version of \"Stardust Speedway (Bad Future)\" from Sonic CD.\n\nPast the 1:30 minute mark is not heard in-game, as the Noise Bomb explodes before then, causing the player have to redo the fight.\n\nThe Phantom Tower Cut Level Theme Mr. Sauceman This track was used as a placeholder for Wasteyard in PT_Eggplantv15. This song inspired certain elements of \"Dungeon Freakshow\". PROMOTION! After beating Pepperman in the Halloween Demo / Knight transformation theme Mr. Sauceman Only 3 seconds of the song actually played in-game. The Peppino sprite used on the cover is actually an unused taunt.

Freefallin' Cut Freefalling level ClascyJitto Hallelujah Mama-Mia Cut Heaven level ClascyJitto Contains the melody and bassline of Freefallin' but with different instruments used. Collapse! Cut Freefalling level escape sequence ClascyJitto Was the first escape-like song ClascyJitto made for the game. Sounds from the Genesis / Megadrive can be heard, part of \"Spooky Apartment Escape\" can be heard within. Like Distasteful Anchovi, there exists a version with no tempo changes that was never meant to be used. Distasteful Anchovi Pizza Time (The Noise) ClascyJitto When making the cover for this song, ClascyJitto asked the Pizza Tower Discord to give her images of The Noise panicking.\n\nThere is an alternate version of the song simply titled \"anchovi.\" that plays without any tempo changes, which was never planned to be used.\n\nDespite ClascyJitto's distaste for the Noise's previous escape theme Pesto Anchovi, Distasteful Anchovi was never implemented in any Patreon builds of Pizza Tower.\n\nShe would later go to compose a new version of the escape theme for The Noise’s playable update.
