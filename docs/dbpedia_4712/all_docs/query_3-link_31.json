I may earn a small commission for my endorsement, recommendation, testimonial, and/or link to any products or services from this website.\n\nPrepare a restaurant-quality naan flatbread pizza recipe at home in about 15 minutes! The easy dinner includes store-bought crust, marinara or pizza sauce, a blend of Italian cheeses, and all of your favorite toppings. Serve each pizza with a crisp Caesar salad, tomato salad, or marinated cucumbers for a quick weeknight meal.\n\nIf you have extra naan in your kitchen, be sure to try this chicken souvlaki, these Crock Pot chicken gyros, these lemon garlic chicken skewers, and a Greek salad with shrimp, too!\n\nHow to Make Naan Flatbread Pizza | 1-Minute Video\n\nWOW!!!!! This recipe is simple, fast and absolutely delicious! My family was skeptical at first, but after the first bite we were all singing your praises for this recipe. I don’t think we will be buying take out or frozen pizzas anymore as this is much faster and tastier than our usual pizza night fare. Thanks Blair for another keeper from your website.\n\n– Barbara\n\nIngredients\n\nThis is just a quick overview of the ingredients that you’ll need for a homemade flatbread pizza recipe. As always, specific measurements and step-by-step instructions are included in the printable recipe box at the bottom of the post.\n\nCrust: while you can certainly prepare homemade pizza dough or focaccia, the beauty of this particular recipe is its ease. Thanks to a store-bought crust, the entire meal is ready in about 15 minutes! We typically use this naan flatbread or these thick, sturdy tandoori flatbreads for a crust, which we find in the deli or bakery section of the grocery store. Pita bread will also work, but it has a pocket of air in the center, which isn’t quite as ideal for pizza.\n\nPizza sauce: or use marinara sauce to spread on top of the crust.\n\nCheese: we like an Italian cheese blend, which includes mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, provolone cheese, asiago cheese, and Romano cheese. You can also just use plain mozzarella, or a combination of mozzarella and grated Parmesan.\n\nOptional pizza toppings: if you like a more jazzed-up pizza, try adding sliced pepperoni, cooked and crumbled Italian sausage, ham, pineapple, bacon, green bell peppers, halved cherry tomatoes, sliced mushrooms, sliced sweet onion or red onion, olives, or fresh herbs such as parsley, basil, or oregano.\n\nDirections\n\nThis easy naan flatbread pizza is absolutely one of my kids’ most-requested meals! They love it for a special weekend lunch, or for a quick dinner as we’re all coming and going from sports practices during the week.\n\nArrange flatbread pizza crusts on a rimmed sheet pan.\n\nTop each flatbread with about pizza sauce or marinara sauce.\n\nSprinkle about ½ cup of grated cheese over top. You don’t need to measure all of the ingredients — I typically just “eyeball” it. Use more or less of the different ingredients to suit your personal preferences.\n\nTop flatbread with pepperoni or other toppings of choice.\n\nBake the pizzas in a 425°F oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and slightly browned on top. Cook times will vary, but will likely take anywhere between 10-15 minutes.\n\nGarnish with fresh basil leaves or parsley, grated Parmesan cheese, or crushed red pepper flakes for the best flavor. Drizzle with olive oil, too! Then just slice and serve.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nPair the naan pizzas with fresh vegetables to round out the meal. Good options include a green salad with red wine vinaigrette, cucumber dill salad, three-bean salad, roasted broccoli, Parmesan roasted cauliflower, sauteed spinach with garlic, garlic Parmesan zucchini casserole, and roasted yellow squash.\n\nPreparation and Storage Tips\n\nMake Ahead: Assemble the pizzas in advance and freeze them for a later meal. Talk about convenient!\n\nTo Freeze Before Baking: Gently press the toppings into the crust, and then place them on a baking sheet in the freezer for about one hour. Once frozen, transfer the pizzas to large Ziploc freezer bags (or other airtight containers) and store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Bake the frozen pizzas straight from the freezer, but add a few extra minutes to the suggested baking time.\n\nHow to Store: Leftover pizza will keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. To freeze the leftover pizza, let it cool completely, wrap tightly in plastic wrap or other airtight freezer-safe containers, and store in the freezer for up to 3 months.\n\nHow to Reheat: Place the pizzas on a baking sheet and warm in a 350°F oven (or toaster oven) until heated through, about 5-10 minutes.\n\n15-Minute Naan Flatbread Pizza\n\n5 from 1 vote\n\nPrep: 5 minutes minutes\n\nCook: 10 minutes minutes\n\nTotal: 15 minutes minutes\n\nPrepare a restaurant-quality naan flatbread pizza recipe at home in about 15 minutes!\n\nIngredients\n\n4 small flatbread crusts or store-bought Naan bread\n\n1 ¼ cups pizza sauce (or marinara sauce), divided\n\n2 cups grated Italian cheese blend (such as a combination of mozzarella, Parmesan, provolone, asiago, and Romano)\n\nToppings of choice, such as sliced pepperoni, green bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, diced ham, cooked and crumbled Italian sausage, sliced olives\n\nOptional garnish: chopped fresh basil, oregano, or parsley; grated Parmesan cheese; crushed red pepper flakes\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 425°F. Arrange flatbreads on rimmed baking sheets. Spread about ¼ cup of pizza sauce on each flatbread.\n\nSprinkle cheese on top, and finish with additional toppings, if desired.\n\nBake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is crisp on the edges. Garnish with chopped fresh herbs, grated Parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper flakes just before serving.\n\nVideo\n\nNotes\n\nGrilled Flatbread Pizza: Instead of baking the pizzas, try grilling them. To do so, preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Oil the grates, place the pizzas on the grill, close the lid, and cook for about 10 minutes.\n\nScale the recipe to accommodate the size of your family. For instance, if you’re cooking for two, cut all of the ingredients in half and prepare just 2 pizzas. Similarly, you can double the ingredients to feed a larger group.\n\nNutrition\n\nServing: 1pizza (not including optional toppings)Calories: 492kcalCarbohydrates: 73gProtein: 26gFat: 11gSaturated Fat: 6gPolyunsaturated Fat: 1gMonounsaturated Fat: 3gCholesterol: 36mgSodium: 1394mgPotassium: 445mgFiber: 4gSugar: 4gVitamin A: 603IUVitamin C: 5mgCalcium: 555mgIron: 3mg\n\nRecipe Variations and Tips for Success\n\nMake a white flatbread pizza by swapping out the pizza sauce for Alfredo sauce. You can also use pesto instead of a tomato-based sauce.\n\nMake bbq chicken flatbread pizza or try a Hawaiian pizza with diced ham and/or cooked bacon and diced pineapple.\n\nGrilled Flatbread Pizza: Instead of baking the pizzas, try grilling them. To do so, preheat the grill to medium-high heat.

Similarly, you can double the ingredients to feed a larger group.\n\nUse your favorite pizza toppings. My boys keep it simple with plain cheese pizza, while we typically add sliced pepperoni. You can also top the pizza with sautéed sliced mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and black olives for a veggie-packed meal. Serve it with a fresh arugula salad and balsamic vinegar on top. Try cooked, crumbled bacon or Italian sausage, diced ham, prosciutto, or rotisserie chicken, too.
