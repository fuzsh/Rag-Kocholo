No sogginess even after a delivery.\n\nAmazing food and excellent service! The breakfast menu had so many options we were impressed! So sorry for being in so early, thank you for letting us in though. We might be coming back for lunch.\n\nGreat size for the price! Fast delivery, faster than expected even on game 6 of the Stanley Cup! Sauce is sweet, fair warning.\n\nI just tried this place for the first time for lunch. I was surprised at the menu options which were extensive. It is basically an old-school diner type menu with an Italian focus. But I was happy to see that I could order breakfast for lunch..."
