        "text": "Honoring the Craft\n\nThe wooden peel is a paddle-like tool that has been part of mankindâs culinary traditions for thousands of years. At Peel Pizza Company, the peel represents the pride, craftsmanship and artisan spirit with which we make our pizzas.\n\nSignature Pizzas\n\nAll of our red pizzas are made with our classic sauce, famous for its rustic chunks of tomato. If you prefer our smoother blended sauce, please tell us when placing your order. If you have a food allergy, please let us know. Though we offer a gluten-free crust, we do not offer a gluten-free environment/kitchen. We make our own dough daily and cannot prevent possible exposure to flour."
