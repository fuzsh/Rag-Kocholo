Greenleaf Foods, the Elmhurst, Ill.-based owner of Field Roast Grain Meat Co., Seattle, Wash., partnered with Pizza 73, Canada, to introduce a new plant-based pizza available at all 88 Canadian locations.

The new Super Plant Pizza features Field Roast’s Mexican Chipotle Sausage as a crumble, which is made from grains, smoked Chipotle peppers, sweet onions, fresh-chopped garlic, apple cider vinegar, cumin seed, oregano and Chili de Arbol peppers.

The Super Plant Pizza also includes homestyle Italian tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and plant-based pepperoni, and is available on any crust, as well as Pizza 73’s new cauliflower crust.

“Pizza 73 has built a reputation based on taste and speed. To help elevate that experience with delicious plant-based menu options is incredibly exciting,” says Dan Curtin, president of Greenleaf Foods. “As Canadians continue to experiment with plant-based eating, we will continue to innovate and deliver high-quality, artisanal products in the formats they know and love.”

The Field Roast Mexican Chipotle Sausage is available in retail stores and natural food stores across Canada and the United States.
