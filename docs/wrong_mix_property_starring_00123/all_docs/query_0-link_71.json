        "text": "Billy finds the guerrilla camp and when the team catches up, Dutch gives hand signals for the team to fan out left and right. Then, without having to say a word, without having to look back or turn around, Dutch holds his gun out to the side and Poncho is there to take it and place in Dutch's empty waiting hand a pair of binoculars. Again, so cool (well-oiled machine)! Plus, you know Dutch would only hand over his weapon once he's covered.\n\nThe team is perched on a ridge above a military camp. Dutch slides/crawls on his stomach down to a big fallen tree trunk where he can observe the guerrillas down below unseen. He assesses their strength, and is witness to the execution of a hostage. His face does not flinch when the man is shot, but as he turns around and accepts what the team must now do, you see the sadness and resignation in his expression. The execution, and his reaction to it, helps us to not feel sorry for the guerrillas later when Dutch's team shoots the shit out of them (and then some). (Without the execution scene, his team would have seemed like what Dutch said they weren't \"We're a rescue team, not assassins\".)\n\nWith another simple hand signal of making a circle with his index finger, his men know to slide down the ridge to where he is. As they all crawl on their bellies through the leaves, you can't help but feel like a kid again playing soldier with your friends. [And if that wasn't your idea of fun when you were a kid, you're probably not an Action Movie Freak today.]\n\nAgain, with few words, Dutch gives them their instructions and they hit the guerrilla camp/munitions dump and make it look easy. This is what they are used to and what they are good at. They find a trip wire on a booby trap near the sentry tower and cut it. Then they take out the guards with knives. No alarm will be sounded. Dutch gets the brilliant idea to use an old truck the guerrillas have rigged up for power (to pump water from a well) as a delivery device for his satchel charge (it looks like a canvas-covered lunchbox with an \"on\" switch). He gets to show off by deadlifting the back end of the truck and sending it on its way to roll right into some shacks and blow up.\n\nThe all-out attack begins as he starts throwing grenades, and then comes the team's full range of firepower in action: All kinds of shit gets blown up; men catch on fire; there are multiple falls; they blow up a helicopter; Arnold does his Commando 'walk-and-shoot'' to great effect; and the stunt men wriggle and die awesomely. The team decimates the guerrillas in very little time. Even the guerrillas' guns seem puny by comparison. We get to see Jesse The Body as Blain use \"Ole Painless\". (Ole Painless back then seemed as much overkill as the AA-12 in The Expendables), and Blain delivers maybe the most macho Action Movie line ever:\n\nDuhrty WherkAfter they take over the camp and have a look around, Mac's intel reveals to Dutch that they were lied to. Dillon lied so they could go in and stop a Soviet-supplied invasion. Now Dutch is pissed!\n\nDUTCH You set us up! It's all bullshit. All of it: the Cabinet Minister, the whole business.\n\nYou got us in here to do your duhrty wherk.\n\nDILLONN Look, we just stopped a major invasion. In three days they'd have been across the border with this stuff.\n\nDUTCH Why us?\n\nDILLON Because nobody else could have pulled it off. You pissed about the cover story?\n\nI knew I couldn't get you in here without it.\n\nDUTCH So what story did you hand to Hopper? [I love it, so snide] DILLON Look, we've been looking for this place for months. My men were in that chopper when it got hit. Hopper's orders were to go in and get my men, and he disappeared.\n\nDUTCH He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive!\n\nDILLON And my orders were to get somebody in here who could crack these bastards.\n\nDUTCH So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.\n\nWhat happened to you Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.\n\n[Say whatever you want to about Arnold, his acting here is really good. He's not just pissed, he looks disappointed and a little hurt. And Dillon looks cornered and a little afraid of him. If Dutch thinks they're in a meat grinder, I'm scared. You should be too.]\n\nI love every word of this movie.4 Does it show? I have to keep from transcribing the whole damn thing. (I failed, right? You know you love it!)\n\nArnold fans will love the accent when he says:\n\n\"Billeee gimme a way outta dis haule.\"\n\nDutch's team did accomplish their mission, even though it was not what they were sent in to do. So Dillon used them; CIA, Russians, guerrillas, doesn't matter anymore except that more guerrillas are about half an hour away and closing on them, and the team is refused extraction from that point. They have to high tail it out of there to meet up with the chopper someplace farther away, and safer.\n\nThe one surviving guerrilla is a 'native' (Central American) woman named Anna, whom Dutch spared. Dillon wants take her along, but Dutch says she will give up their position every chance she gets, and the audience thinks so too. The movie was filmed in Mexico, but they use a fictional name. Where the movie takes place is relevant only to the fact that it has to have a remote jungle (a hunting ground for the Predator) inhabited by Spanish-speaking natives like Anna, for later when we hear her explanation of the legend of \"el diablo casador de hombres\".\n\nAs they leave the camp, Mac calls Dillon back to take a scorpion (he didn't know was crawling on him) off his shoulder, and then crushes it underfoot5 (nice little reminder that a tropical jungle is deadly).\n\nFrom this, the Predator learns the words \"Dillon\", \"turn around\", \"anytime\", and \"over here\", and, how to laugh from Billy (Hawkins, their communications expert, makes a joke). The Predator is translating what the men say by recording them and playing it back on some kind of voice analyzer. It shows that he is advanced, and we hear his weird mechanical alien voice. We know now that he is stalking them and what he sounds like, even though the men don't, yet.\n\nBouncing Back\n\nWith the team's victory, the retreat begins. Once they leave, the Predator comes in and scans the camp. We see his hand pick up the crushed scorpion and the scorpion's color fade to black as it dies. This looks cool as hell and also shows the size of the creature and that it has claws. Until now, the Predator has kept his distance, watching the men, following (tracking) them, and learning. We wonder what he will do with the language interpretation skills, and why he skinned the bodies they found.\n\nSure enough, it isn't long before Anna tries, unsuccessfully, to escape. This shows Dillon really is rusty (he lost the arm wrestling contest, he let Blain spit on his shoe, his first team failed, and he gave away the real purpose of the mission). With all the attention they must have attracted by blowing up everything, they seem to be moving more cautiously than quickly. When Dutch said \"Double time it\" to Poncho, I thought that meant get way out ahead, but luckily, Poncho is right there to stop Anna in her tracks with another of my favorite Predator lines: \"Ni lo intentes!\" (translation: \"Don't even think about it!\")\n\nYea, Though I Walk . . . Their only way out is through a valley (which is never good, defensively). They are all on edge, but all is going well until Billy stops and seems afraid to go on. As Dutch approaches him, we see Arnold's bicep from the side. That's another of our \"Holy Mother of God!\" moments. Any older Action Movie Freak will tell you how impressive this moment was when they saw it on the big screen, and the biggest reason why we love Arnold—SIZE! [Something we now mostly have to watch wrestling or MMA to get.] When Dutch reaches Billy, Billy is almost in a trance, rubbing the medicine pouch he wears around his neck (for protection). Dutch has to physically distract Billy from whatever he's staring at to get Billy to answer him. We are shown through the heat vision that Billy is right to stare, because the Predator is staring back from above, but of course, they can't see him. Everyone who loves this movie also loves the character of Billy. The expression \"Billy Bad Ass\" comes to mind because it is so cool that he's an Indian—With all their weapons and machines, they still rely on his tracking skills and his sixth sense, or \"nose\".\n\nDillon, impatient as usual, gets Poncho to watch Anna so he can go see what's going on up ahead with Dutch and Billy. Anna uses this opportunity to try to escape again, and whacks Poncho with a tree branch. She makes a run for it, and they are forced to give chase, dividing the unit. Arnold signals and whistles for the men to follow her. Hawkins is the closest. We see through the Predator vision how fast whatever it is watching them can move—like it was just waiting for its chance—as it swoops in to take advantage that two of them are away from the group. Hawkins tackles Anna and grabs her by the shirt and asks her to stop squirming. At that instant she stops, not because he asked, but because the Predator is right behind him. She sees and hears it, and now so do we, as we are introduced to its prism / camouflage effect.\n\nWhen the Predator kills Hawkins, the blood sprays Anna in the face. One second Hawkins had ahold of Anna, and the next, the Predator kills him and drags his body away. We now see that it's Man-like, and how strong it is. Anna begins to crawl away. Poncho arrives and grabs her, pulling her up and turning her over. She's trembling, bloody, and \"scared out of her mind\". Realizing she's not going to go anywhere, Poncho follows a blood trail looking for Hawkins. The other men arrive. Dutch examines Anna's face, finding that the blood is not hers, as Poncho calls out . . . (what happens next always gives me goosebumps)\n\nThe look on Dutch's face is worth the whole movie.\n\nWe're thinking 'Arnold' doesn't know what to make of it. ARNOLD! If he wasn't worried, none of it would have mattered. We'd have stood behind him, figuratively, and taken our cue from what he does. He's Mr. Universe and he's not afraid of anything. Until now.\n\nSo where is Hawkins' body? They find only another pile of guts like with Hopper. Dutch tells Poncho to ask Anna what happened. Poncho fires questions at Anna. Anna tries to explain. \"Selva se lo llevo.\" Poncho translates: \"She says the jungle, it just came alive and took him.\" Dillon argues, but the funny thing is, you're thinking: that's accurate!\n\nThey start arguing about what happened and why Anna didn't try to escape until Dutch asks why Hawkins' radio and weapon are still there. Dillon makes the connection. \"They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.\" Now they know it's not guerrillas. That changes the game. Guerrillas would have rescued Anna. There's a sense of inevitability and doom when Dutch says \"I want Hawkins' body found. Sweep pattern. Double back. Fifty meters. Let's go.\" You just know they're not going to find it. They spread out.\n\nWe follow Dutch to a spot close to where blood is dripping from above onto some leaves but he doesn't notice it. The camera follows the trail of blood up some vines to Hawkins' gutted naked body hanging upside down very high up in a tree. We now know the Predator is what killed the first group of men, and that he is using the trees to move, but Dutch and his team still don't.\n\nNot in Kansas Anymore In the hunt for Hawkins' body, Blain is walking around with Ole Painless. You're so sure he's going to get to unload on the Predator—you've been waiting for it ever since you saw him use that gun in the guerrilla camp. So, how easily and quickly he's picked off next takes you completely by surprise. He is distracted by a small animal. It sounds like the animal was dropped near him on purpose as a diversion. As he relaxes and turns away from the false alarm, all you see is a flash and blood on his neck and shoulder. Next a 'shot' through his back and out the chest, which kills him and cauterizes the wound as he keels over. As disappointing as it is, it serves to ramp up the fear factor that \"the big man\" is picked off so easily. You know the Predator wants to take Blain's body and is collecting them. You still don't know what for.\n\nEveryone hears when Blain is attacked. Whatever the Predator fires is not as loud as a gunshot, but they all hear it and run in his direction. Mac gets to Blain first and sees the Predator standing there over the body. The Predator's eyes light up and he runs off. Mac reacts and screams for Dutch. \"Serrgeaaaaaant!\" and begins to fire (but Mac's a Sergeant—I think he meant to scream \"Major\"), The Predator is hit in the leg and bleeds (green blood—what else?), and some splashes onto a leaf.\n\nFiring until his gun runs of out ammunition, Mac throws it down and picks up Ole Painless. About this time the other men arrive and also start shooting.\n\nThis is WHAT WE LIVE FOR:\n\nBig Men with Big GunsThe firepower was jaw dropping for the time. This is the scene we love the most about this movie and never get tired of watching. The smoke alone from all that shooting is incredible. Poncho launches some grenades,6 and they level every living thing for probably half an acre. They even reload and all keep firing until Ole Painless runs out of ammunition. Scared out of his wits, Mac still has his finger on the trigger, and all we hear is the sound of the barrel just spinning. (How intense is that?!) Finally, he stops.\n\nMac tells Dutch \"I saw it\". Expecting to find they killed someone, Dutch sends the men ahead to look around. Dutch and Dillon examine Blain's wound.\n\nDutch now asks Mac \"Who did this?\" The fact that Mac is so speechless that he doesn't answer, twice in a row, when Dutch says his name is pretty intense. Mac's shook up; all he can say is he saw something. The men return to report in. [Poncho is standing there and you can see Billy in the bush behind him. I have to say I love how in so many shots they show more than one team member. It gives a sense of space, relationally, and makes the unit seem cohesive, like they are aware all the time of where everyone else is.]\n\nAgain, Dutch's reaction makes the audience afraid. He seems incredulous and stands slowly. The music changes as he looks out into the jungle as if it's a new game, and they don't know what they are up against.\n\nIt's unbelievable that that much firepower killed nothing but trees. They don't know yet, as the audience and Anna does, that the Predator was wounded and is bleeding. Dutch asks Dillon to radio in (I was thinking to tell them there will be a delay, but Dillon is asking to be picked up early), and has the men set up a defensive position for them to spend the night. He also says to put Blain's body in his poncho and take him with them. The whole retreat has changed. They might have kept moving, but now they need to create a defense. They break out the Claymores, trip wires, flares, etc., and make booby traps, and we, and they, feel safe . . . for a while.\n\nDon't Ask, Don't Tell—But Everyone Knows When Dutch told the men to bring Blain's body with them, Mac spoke up that he wanted to be the one to do it, like no one else should touch Blain, or that this is his job/privilege.\n\nThey cut to Anna as she touched the green blood left behind on a leaf. Dillon, oblivious as ever, barks at her. Wiping it off on her pants leg, she says nothing to him about the blood.\n\nThey all, Mac included, get busy creating the defensive hold Dutch asked for. Mac reports in to Dutch when the work is done. The ever-vigilant leader on watch, Dutch acknowledges the closeness between Mac and Blain. \"Mac, he was a good soldier.\" Mac replies \"He was . . . uh, my friend.\" At this point, Dutch (up in a tree) turns to look down at Mac. Mac may have just been saying Blain was his friend, but it seemed to me a little like a admission, and a lot like love,7 and I imagine that it would never have 'come out ' except in death. Now, Mac has a score to settle.\n\nShowing at least some of the defensive preparations the men make is necessary, so that when the Predator evades these traps, you are impressed. Also, it's important that they take care of their defense first. The scene where Mac says goodbye to Blain is poignant, brief, and understated, but doesn't take place until his work is finished. They show Blain already in his poncho. The music, \"Goodbye\", by Alan Silvestri is very much like \"Taps\". Mac pulls out his flask and raises it in a salute (just barely) before he takes a sip, then he puts his flask on Blain's chest as if he wants something precious, something personal, to stay with Blain. (There is a crest on the flask and you assume it's from their platoon, and when Mac tells their story later, you find out they were the only two from their unit who survived). He lays his hand on it for a split second, and then snaps the poncho closed.\n\nExtraction Necessary They cut to Anna resting on the ground, noticing the alien blood she earlier wiped off on her pants. Then they cut to more green blood dripping on stone as they show the Predator stopping to dress his wound. He de-cloaks his mirror-effect camouflage, and despite a lizard-like appearance, has an impressive field kit for self surgery, with a array of metal instruments stored in pneumatic compartments. With clumsy and hurried movements at numbing/dressing the wound, when he does whatever it is he does to presumably extract the bullet, he screams like a banshee. Nothing like a really loud animal sound you've never heard before to make you feel defenseless.\n\nThey cut back to Anna looking terrified. Everyone seems to have heard it but Dillon, who is barking orders into the radio. \"Blazer One, I repeat: Extraction Necessary!\" The men, however, are denied extraction and have to make it through the night. Dillon asks Mac what he saw. Mac really can't say more than it was camouflaged, the eyes he saw disappeared, and that he drew down and fired point blank at it emptying a full pack on the mini gun (200 rounds) and hit nothing. \"Nothing on this earth could have lived; not at that range.\" (on this earth) Doesn't give them much to go on, so they turn to Anna. Dillon presses for more and demands Poncho question her. Poncho does not obey Dillon but looks at Dutch to give him permission (love that). After Poncho questions Anna in Spanish, he replies in English to Dutch, not Dillon.\n\nBILLY\n\nI'm scared, Poncho.\n\nBilly Bad Ass thinks they're all gonna die!! Let that sink in too! True to their characters, Dillon is afraid and he retreats into denial, but Dutch is more accepting, more aware. \"You still don't understand, Dillon, do you? Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper, and now it wants us.\"\n\nComic Relief During the night watch, Mac is looking at the moon and talking to Blain, recounting a story of their survival that illustrates the random insanity of death in war, and making promises to avenge Blain's death. \"I'm gonna cut your name right into him.\" At this point, it seems as if he might get the chance to do that. The Predator probably again uses the drop-an-animal-nearby-from-above trick (although they don't show this) as something sets off a trip wire, becoming a distraction/diversion. Stressed out and exhausted, poor Mac manages to kill the crap out of what turns out to be a wild boar. The men gather to investigate and there's a little comic relief when they all realize it's not the Predator. Poncho quips \"Do you think you could you have found something bigger?\" (Only Billy laughs. l love Billy's laugh—so does the Predator). We laugh too, but everyone is scared. Suddenly, they remember Anna (Dillon left her unguarded), and run back to check on her. She's terrified and hasn't budged. Billy discovers Blain's body is gone, which means the Predator got into the camp through all their defenses \"It came in through the trip wires. Took it right out from under our noses\". . . Bet nobody slept after that.\n\nHunting Season's OpenAt daylight, Billy reasons that the boar must have set off the trip wire because there are no other tracks. No one understands how the Predator managed it, or why it came in to take the body and didn't try to kill them. Dutch is working it out, logically . . .\n\nBILLY\n\nLike a hunter.\n\nThis realization is a game changer. Now is Anna's moment. Until now, maybe she was Dillon's \"baggage\", but Dutch, a great leader, knows he needs all the information he can get. He grabs Anna. When he demands answers, suddenly she speaks English and explains what she saw.\n\nDUTCH\n\nNo more games.\n\nDUTCH\n\nGo on!\n\nDillon is still in denial, still naysaying. Asking her name, Dutch cuts Anna free with a warning that whatever it is, is hunting them all. This empowers her to save herself, and his trust makes her part of the group. It also terminates any semblance of Dillon's leadership. Dillon's only been playing at being in charge. Dutch is the real leader (\"I need everyone\").\n\nDILLON\n\nWhat the hell do you think you're doing?\n\nDUTCH\n\nI need everyone.\n\nDILLON\n\nI'm taking her back. We're out of here in five minutes.\n\nDUTCH We're not going yet.\n\nDILLON Look the rendezvous is 10 to 12 miles away from here. You think the chopper is going to wait?\n\nDUTCH\n\nDillon, we make a stand now, or there will be nobody left to go to the chopper.\n\nANNA\n\nThere is something else.\n\nWhen the big man was killed, you must have wounded it; its blood was on the leaves.\n\nDUTCH\n\nIf it bleeds, we can kill it.\n\nBigger CheeseDutch, listening, seems to take it all very seriously. The tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife. As she finishes telling her story, the camera focus moves from Ana's face to Dutch. He look serious but Dillon is skeptical. Then the camera is back on Dutch and a shadow crosses his face. It seems to be just a bird, cutting the tension.\n\nWhen Dillon wisecracks, \"So, what are you gonna try next, cheese?\", Dutch gets the idea to step into the 'mousetrap.' Dillon is so afraid, he doesn't even want Dutch to be brave. Again, the difference; Dillon would probably have sent one of the men, but Dutch steps up and goes himself. (Of course, as he creeps along they have to show him almost tripping on a wire so you realize he is inside the trap.) He is there barely seconds, and nothing happens, so everyone, including us relaxes, and you wonder for a split second, where do they go from here? But then, just as Dutch lowers his gun and turns around (of course) the thing was sneaking up right behind him. The trap is sprung and the Predator is hoisted up in a net so close to Dutch, he flinches. We all look to see what's in the net but it appears to be empty. The only thing we see besides falling leaves is flashes of light when the Predator starts firing his weapon. He gets free and turns the tree branch they used for support on the net trap into a weapon against them as the tree trunk is cut loose it swings free and slams poor Poncho. The Predator takes to the trees with incredible speed and ease, like gravity has been deactivated for him. (Talk about a game changer!)\n\nAnother Trap is SetNow everyone has seen the Predator's camouflage effect. Mac knew what to look for before, but Dillon sees it for the first time. Mac's the first to fire at it. As the Predator swings around the trunk of a tree to look back at Dillon, his camouflage briefly turns off and they exchanges a look. He's baiting Dillon: making himself the cheese in a new trap.\n\nWe see the Predator's full shape for the first time: a huge, muscular lizard with a helmet on and some kind of reptilian dreadlocks. He re-camouflages himself and gets away. Hell bent on revenge, Mac takes off after him.\n\nScores To Settle\n\nDutch orders Billy to take care of Poncho and starts to go after Mac. Dillon finally steps up and tells Dutch he will find Mac. At least he's not letting Dutch do his dirty work anymore—maybe he's trying to make it up to him and be a real part of a team again. Now Dillon's out to settle the score of his lost team. This noble effort, believing in your own invincibility, yet knowing, deep down, it could cost you your life, is compelling, as we contemplate what Men are brave enough to attempt, and willing to give their lives for: Mac to get revenge for Blain; Dillon to redeem his character and for his team. With two of them, you hope it might be enough.\n\nThankfully, there is some comic relief in a classic Whiner moment as Billy tells Dutch that Poncho is \"busted up pretty bad\" and Poncho pipes up \"I can make it. I can make it.\" Oh yeah, they're not leaving him behind if he can help it!\n\nMac picks a spot to stop and set up. Dillon is not far behind, he is coming through the bush with guns up and ready in both hands. When he stops with his back against a tree trunk to take a rest and look around he keeps both guns up and ready to shoot. This is probably the last moment his full-on fear is keeping him alive.\n\nIt's interesting how we hear the Predator's clicking 'voice' and Mac's 'voice' say \"Turn around\". This is a trick no doubt. What if Dillon had turned around? The Predator was probably right behind him at that moment, but then we hear Mac's real voice say \"Over here\" twice and Dillon ignores the command to turn around and moves toward the \"over here\".\n\nWhere Mac is holed up is fairly well concealed/protected. He reaches out and covers Dillon's mouth and pulls him back into his hiding spot. Mac has spotted the Predator. It's perched on a tree branch out in the open, rocking back and forth like \"Here I am, come and get me\". So, was it there the whole time, can it throw its voice? Was that Mac saying \"turn around\"? Could it have left the branch and gotten back that fast? These questions add to the what-are-they-up-against fear that has been building since the first skinned bodies were found.\n\nWhy Mac didn't try to shoot it right away when he first spotted it, I don't know, but when Dillon catches up to Mac, they decide to try to flush it out and sneak up on it. Of course, the Predator knew they could see him.\n\nWhen Mac and Dillon split up to execute their plan, the Predator moves in so quickly, Mac's barely in position before the Predator takes him out with a headshot and almost no sound. There is an awesome blood-covered camera shot, and up angle on the Predator as Mac's leg twitches.\n\nWith Mac's death we are introduced to the Predator's three-dot red laser targeting light. Laser pointers came out in the early 1980s (this movie was 1987) but none of Dutch's team's weapons had laser sights. This fascinating articleexplains the video below and gives us a behind-the-scenes look at 1984's The Terminator's laser gun and a glimpse into the state of laser-sight technology at the time.\n\nHow the Terminator's .45 Longslide with laser sighting came to be\n\nBy Tim Stevens posted March 10th 2010 10:03AM\n\n“While Arnie's one-handed reloads on his Winchester 1887 may make that shotgun the most iconic weapon of Terminator 2, his laser-sighted .45 Longslide was definitely king in the first. Laser sights are something you can buy in any gun shop today, but back in 1984 they were extremely rare -- and expensive. The one for the movie was custom made by SureFire, a company that specializes in tactical flashlights. Lasers at the time were helium neon, requiring a whopping 10,000 volts to power on and a constant 1,000 volts to stay bright. To manage this on a shoestring budget in the '80s the weapon had a wire running up Arnie's sleeve to a battery inside his jacket and a switch he had to activate with his other hand. (A non-functional prop was used for close-ups.) Crude, but effective, and, most importantly, cheap -- SureFire representatives received only a T-shirt and some other assorted movie swag.”\n\nA little ways away, Dillon hears something but has no idea what, and keeps moving.\n\nThey cut to the remainder of the team, hightailing it through the underbrush. When Anna tries to help by taking Poncho's weapon, Dutch advises her to leave it because the Predator has not killed her until now because she was unarmed \"No Sport\". Another game changer. We thought the Predator might be killing for food, but if it's just a hunter killing for sport . . . that means it won't rest when it's full. It's not about being fed, it's just playing.\n\nDillon gets into position but sees nothing and nothing happens so he goes back to where Mac was and calls his name. Then he sees Mac's lifeless body as the Predator whispers, in Mac's voice \"any time\". Like I can take you at any time. He even flashes his eyes to show Dillon where he is. Alas, Dillon has made yet another mistake (this time it's fatal). His weapon was lowered. In the time it takes him to raise it and start firing, the Predator shoots off his arm. The severed arm keeps firing8 as Dillon screams. The second weapon Dutch gave him had been shouldered and with his remaining arm there isn't time to get it over his head and into firing position (he must be in incredible pain). The Predator is now upon him and he stabs Dillon with two wicked-looking, spring-loaded wrist blades. The blade pop out clearly visible but the rest of the Predator stays cloaked. That makes it extra scary. Dillon gets off a single shot as he pathetically stabs at the Predator with the gun then lets out a all-out blood curdling scream and fires up into the air.\n\nThey cut to the distant sound of Dillon's death scream as the retreating group hears. Dutch is so sadly resigned it's heartbreaking.\n\nA Sporting Chance\n\nWith the death of these two, you feel how completely out of their element the team is. Dutch, Poncho, Anna, and Billy have managed to put some distance behind them and the Predator in their race to the pick-up zone. You hope it will be enough. You are wrong.\n\nThe Predator is incredibly fast and utterly ruthless. There is no hope. What we thought started out as a romp-'em-and-stomp-'em epic has become a who-dies-next. Only four are left.\n\nBilly Bad Ass In case you didn't notice before, look closely at Billy's weapon. That's two guns. His finger is on the trigger of an AR-15/SP1 (M16 rifle), and in front of the clip is the trigger for an attached Mossberg 500 shotgun (the 'home defense' model is nicknamed \"The Persuader\"). Now you see!\n\nAlthough (you and) Mac and Dillon thought they had a fighting chance when they went off to kill the Predator, before it even gets to Billy, he already knows there's no chance. When the group hears Dillon's scream, Billy is bringing up the rear halfway across a fallen tree forming a bridge over a river. Billy discards his backpack, his gun, and his vest. Barechested, he wraps the neck-cord protection pouch around his right hand and pulls out his knife. (It's considered a machete although it has a oversized knife shape.) The music here is a real funeral march.\n\nIn doing this, Billy gives his life to buy time for the others. Maybe he hopes he will live, but he kicks the bravery up a notch by going hand to hand, no doubt thinking if he can get the creature that close to him he might do some damage. He dies like a warrior (or so we assume—they don't show it). You have to image what pain it takes for someone as brave as Billy to scream like that.\n\nWhen the remaining three hear it, Dutch and Anna exchange a moment of disbelief (us too) and fear (Poncho's gun shakes as he points it back down the trail). You have to give them credit. They spun around guns up and ready. With the death of Dillon and Billy, you feel how completely out of their element the team is and expect everyone, even Dutch, to be killed.\n\nScream Queens\n\nThis movie is as awesome for screams as a horror movie. If you don't count the shrill bird noises that set you on edge as effectively as a scream, the first is when Mac screams to everyone for help: \"Ssssaaaaarrrrggeeeaannnt!\". They really contrast the quiet kills with the noisy ones. Mac and Blain die quietly, but Dillon and Billy test their lung capacity. Even the Predator screamed in pain when he dressed his wound. Here, there be tygers! (Just a proud note: Anna, the seemingly-scared-out-of-her-wits female, never screams until it is to shout \"Nooo\" in response to Dutch when he tries to stop her from shooting (at the Predator) to protect him.)\n\nYou marvel at how quickly the Predator closed the gap from Dillon to Billy. Then, faster than you imagine is possible, the Predator is already right next to the remaining three in a tree. Anna sees it first. It shoots Poncho in the neck, knocking him out and effectively taking him out of Dutch's grip. Anna tries to shoot back using Poncho's gun. Dutch stops her and knocks the weapon away spraying gunfire where the Predator used to be. You know that her arming herself is a natural reaction, but Dutch saves her by disarming her. \"No sport.\" Remember? The Predator fires a shot to Dutch's shoulder, knocking him down and knocking the gun out of his hands. The Predator at any time could easily have killed Anna and Poncho, and Dutch, but he doesn't. Then Dutch's leadership skills take over and he screams to Anna delivering the most often-quoted screamed line from this movie:\n\n\"Run! Go! Get to the chopper!\"; (in Arnold-speak: \"Runnnnn Gooooohh. Get tooda chappppaaaaaa!\")\n\nHis survival instinct is in hyperdrive, but he expects to die at any second. Leaving the weapon behind, at first he crawls but then he gets up and makes a run for it.\n\nThe Hunter becomes The Hunted\n\nDutch gets lucky and slides out of reach just as the Predator closes in. Slipping in the mud and careening out of control, Dutch falls down a steep mud trail, off a cliff, and into a rushing river headed for a pretty-high waterfall. Surviving the rapids and the waterfall, he swims to safety. You think he's gotten so far ahead, he might have a few moments to rest. No such luck. He gets 3 seconds at most. It was intensely bad ass when the Predator (invisible) splashes into the water behind Dutch, who is face down and exhausted, resting on the muddy river bank.\n\nThe hunting may have seemed easy for the Predator up to this point, but for the creature to go to such lengths to follow Dutch, you know he is relentless. The mud saves Dutch because it camouflages his body heat. Now who's got cloaking! (I don't think the audience needed the dialogue \"He couldn't see me.\" We got that message after the Predator moved on when Dutch wiped some mud off and stared at it.) The Predator wanders off.\n\nWe got our first good long look at the Predator after his camouflage got turned off as he got out of the water, and in realizing he has a weakness, we know he is not invincible. Dutch has a chance. Now begins another mini movie within the movie: Dutch versus the Predator. The chase is over and now it's a battle. Dutch uses his \"Boy Scout bullshit\" to set up traps and make weapons. I can't say enough about how cool it is that after all was said and done with all the other BIG MEN and their BIG WEAPONS, it boils down to the primitive!\n\nBoy Scout Bullshit\n\nThe fight for survival that Dutch undertakes is impressive. All that he's already done seems like nothing compared to what he has to do to get out of this alive. He lost all his weapons except for a knife (a machete like Billy's), yet he uses that plus ingenuity to rig a trap, braid a cord to make a bow and arrows, and then bait the Predator into coming to the spot where he needs him to be. Meanwhile, the Predator was butchering Billy and playing with his skull trophies. (It's a sad moment when he slaps Billy's body face down on a log and rips out his spine and skull.) Now there is no doubt it's just 'sport' to him. I love the cut from the Predator stroking the brow of a skull to Dutch putting mud on his face. I wish it had been his brow as well, still, it works.\n\nNow Dutch uses a scream and lit torch to call the Predator out. You're not really sure how Dutch's trap is supposed to work exactly but you assume it's straightforward. He lights a bonfire, climbs a tree for a vantage point, lies down on a branch, and waits. The Predator takes the bait but Dutch has to change his plan because the Predator (oblivious) climbs the very same branch Dutch is hiding on practically on top of him. Dutch has a back-up plan here too and uses a vine to swing to safety in a nearby tree. The Predator knows he was there but can't see where he went. This gives Dutch time to get his arrows out (including one incendiary one he made with gunpowder from a shotgun shell). When the Predator starts to walk across the fallen tree over the bonfire Dutch made, Dutch shoots a fire strike right in front of him. Maybe he needs him to go in the other direction, maybe he missed intentionally, but the Predator retaliates by shooting off his shoulder cannon (aka \"the blowdryer\") like crazy. Dutch is forced to fall to the ground to get out of the way and hurts himself (there is blood in his mouth).\n\nNow the Predator is attuned to movement and looks for clues to Dutch's whereabouts. There is a little chase. By now we have seen how easily and quickly the Predator can leap from object to object without worrying about weight or balance and he is there on top of Dutch in an instant. Dutch hides under a log and gets away. His next move is to throw a rock to bait the Predator so he gives away his position. Dutch throws some a spear he made and we hear the Predator cry out.\n\nIt appears that the Predator was wounded because a green blood trail appears. Dutch is baited into following the trail but the Predator has used his blood as bait. Dutch gets out of this bad position by setting off a homemade flare as a distraction so he can get away, but his movement still gives him away and the Predator's shot breaks the branch Dutch is swinging on and, whoops, Dutch falls into a creek and no more cloaking.\n\nThe second Dutch crawls onto dry land the Predator uses the wristblades to pin his head down. He picks Dutch up like he weighs nothing, slams him against a tree, and we see the height difference as he examines Arnold's skull features then drops him. The Predator was wounded. We see blood bleeding from his ankle as he walks away. We don't know why he didn't kill Dutch but we soon find out. He removes his weapons and his helmet and we see his face.\n\nOne Ugly Mutha Fucka\n\nNow we get to see everything about the creature [bowing to Stan Winston (RIP)]. He unfastens his pressurized helmet (how cool was that), removes the shoulder cannon, and throws his helmet to the ground. The dreadlocks look was inspired, but the expanding vagina-with-fangs face is crazy scary. (Sorry, but you know you were thinking it.)\n\nThe Predator does his version of \"bring it\" and Dutch's response is \"You're one ugly mother fucker.\" Dutch tries to hit it across the face with a log. What follows is kind of funny as Dutch tries different moves on the creature and it copies them in retaliation. When Dutch punches the creature, learning fast, it punches him back. The acting here is great through all that makeup. Now we see the fight alternately from outside and from the creature's vision. He toys with Dutch and beats the crap out of him. There is still some fight in Dutch though as he crawls toward his homemade trap. He gets into position and baits the creature but the creature catches on, and you think Arnold's trap is not going to work. Now we see that the log weight is supposed to spring the thing he set up with sharpened stakes. The Predator is not that dumb. He circles around to the side and Dutch, looking up, sees that the trap will still work in this position without the stakes and kicks loose the stick that was holding up an enormous log so it falls and squashes the Predator . . . but he's not dead yet. Arnold is about the smash his head with a rock but it looks so pathetic he drops the rock (mistake!), and asks \"What the hell are you?\" The Predator's reply is one for the definition of racism: \"What the hell are you?\"\n\nThe Predator still has one trick up his sleeve, a self-destruct mechanism. The countdown display reminded me of The Police's \"Ghost In The Machine\" album cover from 1981.\n\nWhen he activates it, it takes Dutch a second to catch on, but then he runs for his life as the Predator laughs with Billy's laugh—how creepy is that? Dutch makes it far enough away and the chopper nearby sees the explosion. How they managed to find Dutch they never say. How much time elapsed between when Anna and Poncho got picked up and now . . . (just overnight?). The one and only bad thing about this movie is how bad the bomb explosion looks, but nothing is perfect (except this movie in EVERY other way). I would like to see another movie this good someday, but until then, I will watch it over and over and over. The soundtrack cannot be overpraised in adding to the feel of this movie (toward the end soundtrack reminded me of Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\"). I love the look of appreciation in the faces of the General and Anna when they see Dutch standing at the rendezvous point. You can only imagine that they were leaving but saw the explosion and went back to check for him.\n\nThe Players\n\nAs the closing credits begin they introduce the players, and it feels like it has all been a play. The experience was so intense, it's great to see them all again, smiling and alive. The closing montage of the characters helped to create that desire to be one that spawned avatars for games.\n\nI love this movie. It's got to be #1 or #2 on my TOP 5 with Aliens, Rambo III, The Rock, and The Chronicles of Riddick :D. [And yes, I know JCVD was supposed to be the Predator, but he wasn't blah blah blah.] Kevin Peter Hall (7 feet 2 1/2 inches) did an excellent job (RIP), I think they should have included his real appearance in the credits . . . So here he is. He passed away in 1991 at the age of 36 (he got AIDS from a blood transfusion administered during surgery on critical wounds sustained in a major car crash) leaving a wife and two children.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nYou have to recognize the ability to switch between a number of weapons in video games was influenced this movie.

What's more military than that? All that was involved was tossing whatever (rotten) fruit was in season like a grenade just so we could yell \"Hit the dirt!\" and then hitting the dirt.\n\nAll the dialogue except for \"felafel\" . . . or whatever it is Dillon says: \"The target is the center of the felafel!\" ??Huh? ;\n\nSomehow the dead scorpion gets turned around 180 degrees while under his shoe.\n\nPoncho's grenade launcher was custom (this information is also from IMFDB): \"Custom 37mm Launcher . . . built specifically . . . from Heckler & Koch HK94 parts (mainly the stock and pistol grips) and uses parts ftom an AN-M5 aircraft pyrotechnic discharger (a 37mm flare launcher). It's possible the same launcher was used in Braddock: Missing In Action 3. \"\n\nIt was no coincidence that they used the song \"Long Tall Sally\". When you hear it in the helicopter, you don't think anything of it until later. In the helicopter when Blain offers his chaw around and gets refused, he counters that \"This stuff will make you a God-damned sexual tyrannosaurus\" and Poncho jokes back \"Strap this on your sore ass, Blain\". That was my first inkling that there might be some man-on-man love going on. Later, when Mac starts singing the song while prepping for revenge on The Predator for killing Blain, the words hit home. \"Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John . . . \" (It's hard to understand the next words and there are many versions of the lyrics out there but I hear:) \"She claims she doesn't use him but she has a lot of fun.\" I think Aunt Mary is Little Richard's gay alter ego and Uncle John is any gay man he's having sex with. When he says \"Long, tall Sally, she's real sweet, she's got everything that Uncle John needs.\" I heard penis is real sweet and has everything the man Richard wants to have sex with needs (a promise to satisfy). \"Well, I saw Uncle John with bald head Sally. He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the 'alley'. Do I really need to explain that? Anyway, no big surprise that this much manliness is going to bring in some homosexual subtext.
