        "text": "The bad man of Bollywood has shifted his gaze to Hollywood -- and Salma Hayek, to be precise.\n\nGulshan Grover will play the sexy actress' husband in their new film, The Driver. It will be directed by Bill Duke, best known for his role in the Arnold Schwarzenegger-film Predator.\n\n\"I play an Indian accountant, who works in Los Angeles,\" Grover says about his role. \"He dreams of making it big one day. His wife takes the lead to help him, and together, they embark on a journey of emotions.\"\n\nThe actor insists that he wasn't nervous about being cast opposite the very sexy Salma Hayek. \"I have worked with the sexiest heroines of the Indian film industry like Bipasha Basu (Jism) and Katrina Kaif (Boom),\" he says.\n\nTalking about how he was approached for the role, Grover says, \"I was at a charity event in LA, where my Indian fans were cheering for me. The experience was heart-rendering, as they showered affection on me. It was noticed by Bill Duke. Later, he inquired about me from the charity event organiser.\"\n\nBack home, we haven't seen him in a role for a long time. Is he tired of his bad man image? \"The image of a bad man has given me name and fame,\" he says. \"I have been recognised in the industry because of that. But like all actors, I would like to try my hand in all kinds of role. By the grace of God, I am in a fantastic situation where I am getting the opportunity to portray all kinds of characters.\""
