        "text": "Bill Duke, G Perico, and Soren Baker have released the short film The Bookstore Menace, a clever reworking of Duke’s iconic role in the landmark 1993 film Menace II Society. The film world premiered on the Facebook page of leading hip-hop website Ambrosia For Heads last night.\n\nA legendary actor, director, producer, and owner of the new NSights Network, Bill Duke is best known in the rap world for his scene in the film Menace to II Society. Who can forget his famous line: “You know you f-ed up, don’t you?”\n\n“No matter where I travel across the world, this line is the line people remember most,” says Duke who has acted in dozens of films, including Predator and Commando. “They say it back to me often and declare that the line has become an iconic line in movie history.\n\n“This reprisal is a fun way to remind people of the line in the movie, while placing value on the incredible content that can be found in these two books that have become topics of discussion in the film and TV and rap music genres,” Duke continues. “The interrogation of G Perico is our ‘new jack’ new spin on an old story.”\n\nThe books highlighted in “The Bookstore Menace” are Bill Duke: My 40-Year Career on Screen and Behind the Camera and Baker’s The History of Gangster Rap. Its author, storied rap journalist Soren Baker, partnered with Duke and G Perico, the rising gangster rapper who is often compared to Eazy-E and DJ Quik, to create the highly anticipated release of the short film that re-creates one of the hottest scenes in entertainment and hip-hop history.\n\nTweet\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDr. Jerry Doby Editor-in-Chief of The Hype Magazine, Media and SEO Consultant, Journalist, Ph.D. and retired combat vet. 2023 recipient of The President's Lifetime Achievement Award. Partner at THM Media Group. Member of the U.S. Department of Arts and Culture, the United States Press Agency and ForbesBLK."
