        "text": "Big Arnie straps on the fetishistic military hardware for a rumble in the jungle with a merciless, camouflaged alien (Hall). A routine operation to rescue a cabinet minister captured by South American guerrillas turns into a fight to the death when Arnie's crack platoon is picked off one by one by an invisible adversary, which then makes itself visible, removes its protective helmet, and challenges him to a fair (!) fight. With its stilted dialogue and hammy acting, the film has the look of an expensive production but the feel of a B movie, delivering the sort of undemanding monster mayhem Arnie's fans have come to expect."
