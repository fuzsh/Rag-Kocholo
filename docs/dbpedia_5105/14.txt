Left in 1987.to program WLAC-FM in Nashville. Then to PD of WBUF, Buffalo, WKRC/WKRQ/WWNK/WLW/WSAI/WCKY and WAZU Cincinnati. (All that in 9 years) In 2000 came to San Diego as PD of “Soft Oldies” KJQY. We shifted to “Oldies” in 2000, and a year later shifted dial position and calls…currently PD and mornings at KOCL (95.7) San Diego; middays KSBL (101.7) in Santa Barbara, Middays on KKFG, Farmington, NM, Weekends on WLCL Atlanta, and “Beatles Radio Show’” host on Classic Rock KGB, San Diego.

Update: June, 2008 Yes– the doors keep revolving. Oldies “Kool” moved to 99.3 in 2003…and was gone by fall 2005, when I became morning news co-host on KOGO (AM 600). That job was eliminated in 2007 with budget cuts, and I started mornings on experimental “Sign On Radio” – an internet only website for The San Diego Union-Tribune. Within 9 months it became a volunteer only operation – but I was rescued by Broadcast Company of the Americas who decided that simulcasting their Sports programming from XPRS-AM was better served by (ta daaa) Oldies on 105.7 – now christened “The Walrus”. I’m in mornings…we’re just off the ground (http://www.walrusfm.com) and response has been awesome. I moved the Beatles show to “The Walrus” – Sundays 12-3 (Pittsburgh time). Shift changes at 3WS elminated my shift there- it broke my heart, but that’s the business. I still voicetrack for Clear Channel’s KKFG in Farmington, NM, and do TV work in San Diego for KUSI-TV, KPBS-TV and XETV. In San Diego, many U.S. companies lease Mexican signals. 99.3 is one, and 105.7 is also out of Mexico, slamming across the border like you wouldn’t believe. Our AM (XPRS-AM) is the very same frequency that was once XERB…home of Wolfman Jack. Wonder what he’d say today??
