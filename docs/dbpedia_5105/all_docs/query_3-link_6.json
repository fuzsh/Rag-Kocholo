Only Out Word For 'Salesman' DOING THE DIAL BIT: Three years on the job is not long, but long enough, indeed, to mention the \"greatest yet\" entry. That was \"Death of a Salesman\" in absolutely every category of criticism .\n\nThe greatest in three years? Say 20 and be safe Caught the end of \"From the Terrace\" just in time for Paul Newman's fine scene in which he turned down the big job And the beginning of \"Lucky Me\" in which Doris Day was at her jerky, jittery, super-cute worst 'The Sea Around Us\" was a whale of a platter of sea food French farces on \"Paris 1900\" continue to shape up as crisp goodies Phillie manager Gene Mauch, in a pregame interview, had quite an answer as to whether Roberto Clemente's wild throw took off as it went into the stands: \"I really don't know. I was too busy laughing\" Ray Anthony, a man without a horn on \"Eavesdrop,\" was interesting enough until the Inevitable plugs for the latest album. ADD DIAL BIT: Those new \"Popeye\" cartoons are just awful; the old \"Speedy Gonzalez\" entries quite good. The comparison was especially notable when they ran back to back Worst \"comedy\" skit of the week end was Judy Garland and Van Johnson in a clown number on \"Hollywood Palace\" Patrick McGoohan handled butterflies and the enemy with equal dexterity on \"Secret Agent,\" a show which certainly deserves to come back, but not opposite \"Get Smart.\" That one had this funny would you believe by Don Adams: \"Would you believe I once trained a swimmer to swim the English Channel four times? No? The Mississippi River three times? No? How about twice around the bath tub?\" That was probably Herb Alpert playing the new \"Camp-town Races\" on the Kentucky Derby telecast. Liked Dave Bin-beck's better .\n\nStop-action camera was used well catching Kauai King at the finish line. Less horsing around filling the hour with silly interviews and Churchill Downs lore would be more helpful. Better yet, CBS ought to cut it to 15 minutes to include the introduction of the horses, the race, a rerun of the race and an interview with the winning jockey. So Socks The Drums MORE DIAL BIT: Sal Mineo imitated Gene Krupa on drums down to the last gum chewing, stick-spinning, mugging detail Seeing too much of Danny Kaye weekly took the edge off the sometimes hilarious \"Walter Mitty\" \"Trials of O'Brien\" hit the jackpot again, of course, this time with a pair of queens in Jessica Walter and Joanna Pettet \"Sing Along With Mitch\" managed to remove most of the excitement from the bossa nova beat. HOLLYWOOD \"Super Bwoing,\" \"Cool McCool\" and \"Space Kidettes,\" three new color cartoon series, will premiere Sept .\n\n10, on NBC. \"Bwoing\" (99:30 a. focuses on three separate cartoon creations: \"Super Bwoing,\" 'The Brothers Matzorl-ley\" and \"Super Services Inc.\" Super Bwoing, Is a guitar-riding supersleuth ho bumbles his way into fame and fortune and at times Infamy and misfortune, while performing his appointed duties. Accompanying Super are the Brothers Matzoriley who do the adage one better by showing that three heads are (sometimes) better than one. \"Cool McCool.\" a secret agent, Is the latest creation of Bob Kane, the originator of \"Batman .\n\nLed by Skooter, the Spare Kidettes Include Jennie Jet, the tomboy; Countdown, the studious, Inventive type; Snoopy, the snoopy type; and Pupstar, Snoopy's pal.

Likewise, the musical score by Glenn Paxton contributed heavily to the broadcast, and stayed as dose to the land as does the President. The President's program By RICK DU BROW HOLLYWOOD, May- 10 (UPI) President Johnson last night guided a one-hour NBC-TV tour of the Central Texas hill country he calls home, and the result was an exceptional piece of genuine Americana. The program, 'The Hill Country: Lyndon Johnson's Texas,\" was not only of obvious historical interest, but fill-1 filled the function of legitimately enlightening the public mind about the sources that have partly shaped the President's outlook. This would have been suffl-1 dent, but fortunately for the was excellently conceived, taking the shape of a conversational tour with reporter Ray Schcrer, blended with stops at landmarks ofhis life, and talks with persons he has known .\n\nThe natural, off-the-cuff talking approach, played off a rran reporter with whom he seemed distinctly at ease, was the perfect choice for Mr. Johnson. The program was so worthwhile, in fact, that one wonders why it was not put on earlier, for youngsters to see as well rather than airing at 1011 p. m. When it is rerun, this should certainly be taken intfy consideration .\n\nTreasurer; and J. A. Barlock, Secretary.
