I recall answering an ad in Broadcasting Magazine, then received a call from Mr. Hall himself requesting an interview. I was working as a jock in York, PA at the time and the station was having some personality issues with a new PD...so I was a looking. As I recall, I got off the wrong exit of I-81 South and ended up going the looooong way over the mountain and into Lynchburg, mainly via the Blue Ridge Parkway. I was probably 40 miles from the station and said to myself, well let's try to pick it up, thinking I was much too far away. I kicked on the radio and BOOM, there was one of the country gentlemen and some great country music with a strong bass sound. Arrived in L'burg and got along very nice with Rick. He hired me on the spot, but said we wanted me to start out as the Music Director, prove myself and possibly be the PD. I arrived a week or so later, got a place to live and showed up for work.\n\nRick pretty much gave we all the leeway I wanted. Two weeks later, I was anointed the PD. He told me to fix the sound, maintain the country music and hire some dj's as he called them. So I did. We had a staff of young, un-married guys (myself included back then). Rick was a true salesman...he could sell ice to Eskimos. He had a philosophy he told me once (this one's for all the sales folks out there)...'always make one more sales stop at the end of the day, because that one will be the BIG order'. I remember remotes with greased pigs! I recall a remote at a mobile home lot with a guy who dressed like Evil Kineval who was popular at the time. The Evil clone had a ramp up and down the sides of a long double wide. He fired up his cycle, did a fake roll to the top of the ramp, came back down...I threw the mike out to him and said 'any last words?' They must not have been too memorable, I don't remember them. Once Rick had a promotion called 'Treasure Man' He somehow talked Sam the engineer to dress up in a traded out tux. Under his arm was a white painted mailbox, the kind you might still find on a post for rural delivery. The door to the mailbox was locked. Sam had ring fll of dozens of keys. You guess it, one key opened the box. The winner got all the gift certificates and stuff obtained from sponsors, who were also sold a nice little advertising spot package for cash. Sam stopped people on the sidewall in downtown Lynchburg, introduced himself as the Treasure Man and asked if they wanted to try their luck at opening the box. Simple but fun.\n\nWe had a tight format, a clean facility that was almost always sold out spot wise, thanks to Rick Hall and Henry Ford, the salesman.\n\nThe FM was WWOD-FM and played beautiful music from a reel to reel deck at the speed of 3 3/4 ips. The deck was in the main studio and the AM jock had to change reels at the bottom of each hour. Since the FM wasn't making any real money, Rick decided it was time for change. Lynchburg as we all know was and still is in the bible belt. In 1974, I do not believe there were any religious radio stations in the area. That was soon going to change. Rick wanted to create a, as he called it 'toe tapping gospel music radio station'. It was to be called The Gospel Truth. The only problem was, we had no staff, and most important, NO music. Rick was walking me out to the parking lot after a long day of spinning the hits and recording commercials. With his arm around me he said 'Jay, I want you to head up this format change to gospel.' I said I know nothing about gospel...I'm Catholic! He said he wouldn't hold that against me. I asked when he wanted the change...he said, next Monday. It was now Tuesday.\n\nThe next day, I worried while on the air as to how I was going to pull this off. Then, almost as if God was listening, the secretary came into the studio and said I had a phone call. I usually did not take calls on the air, but asked, what the caller wanted. She said, apparently a job. I took the call. The guy on the other end was asking if we had any temporary openings on the air. He was a 'dj' from far away, passing though, when his car broke down. He had little cash for the needed repairs but a lot of ambition. I said we may have something on our FM, but it is playing gospel music (remember, we still had NO music!). At that moment, the heavens parted, trumpets blew and this guy announced, HE was a gospel radio announcer...in fact, with him in the broken down car was an entire collection of gospel 45's and LP's, his personal collection, on his way to his next job. Wow...he got the job on the spot. Somehow, I got to him, we loaded all the music into my car and proceeded to WWOD. I'm not sure if this guy slept at the station or what, but we had talent, music and now a format in place. Our morning guy recorded several liners and ID's, we moved some equipment around in the beautiful music studio, and bingo, it was a gospel music radio station.\n\nLater, I believe we hired a local minister with a very funny personality, who used to be a jock..he did mornings. A few long form paid gospel preaching tapes were played every other hour with the toe taping stuff in between. Rick was happy and I was 'saved' probably both with my job and religiously! And hey, I'm Catholic!\"\n\nDoug Neatrour (a/k/a Jay Douglas)"
