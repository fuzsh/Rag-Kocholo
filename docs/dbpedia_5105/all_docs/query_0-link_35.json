New advancement in technology has made it easy for many CEOs to have the opportunity to loot their companies, and to engage in accounting irregularities. Technology has made improvements to the way a company does business with others, and also it has opened up ethical concerns for the way a company conducts their business. Recently, accounting professionals have been placed under immense pressure by changes in the size and scope of financial markets (Love, 2007 para. 1). Companies use the financial reporting system to communicate the financial effects of the company to outsiders (Love, 2007).

Enron, a multinational company avoided showing their true financial statements for several years with the help of their auditor. Arthur Anderson, the company s auditor signed off on the validity of the company s accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements (Accounting ethics, 2011, para. 12). As a result of Arthur Anderson engaging in unethical practices, Enron s shareholders lost their money when the company went into bankruptcy, Arthur Andersen employees lost their jobs, and the company went out of business (Accounting ethics, 2011, para. 12). Another example is Adelphia founder, and former CEO John Rigas. He was found guilty of looting Adelphia in 2005. (Mallor, Barnes, Bowers, Langvardt, 2010). Rigas, along with his son, and CFO Scott, was accused of using the company as their on private ATM to provide fifty million dollars in cash advances, buy 1.6 billion in securities, and repay 252 million in margin loans. As a result of their crimes Rigs received fifteen years in prison, and his son, and former CFO Scott, received twenty years in prison (Mallor et al., 2010). As a response to these major accounting scandals new reforms, regulations, and calls for higher education have been introduced to deter any individual from engaging in unethical behavior.

It is a type of argument where premises provide irrefutable grounds to support the truth of their conclusion. Deduction begins with the general facts or obvious facts and reasons down to the specific. In deductive reasoning we make explicit what has been already implicit in the premises. A Deductive argument is said to be valid when the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion. The premises are true; the conclusion must be true.

Holmes recommended that logic is the science of deduction and examination. Deduction, in the severe sense, is an implication from premises to a conclusion, and furthermore, each step of this implication has belief.

During January of 1629 it was decided by parliament to legally try to reduce the power held by the crown. In so doing it was found that Popery and placing taxes on the people without their consent was treason (Kagan 454). Popery was especially bad in England because it was in England that the king was also the head of the church and could make any religious policies he desired. When parliament declared Charles I guilty of treason England was full of mixed emotions. Those who followed the king believed that only through submission to divine authority could they be true Christians. Dissenters were able to gain control thus beheading Charles, and unknowingly creating a dictator (Tomlinson 3). Royalists were those who supported the king. Their name was derived from Caballeo (Spanish) this term denoted someone who was Catholic and had an extreme dislike for Protestants (Chapman 57). Roundheads were those who supported anyone but the king. Their name referred to the apprentices of the day, these apprentices caused conflicts to escalate into violence and in turn caused many people to flee the cities (Chapman 58). With compromise now nearly impossible parliament was not about to change. It could not change because: Parliament was already so far ahead, Religion could be used to control and sway the people, and Charles was stubborn (Buchan 53/54).

The Tiananmen Square Protests Of 1989 Colin Mok Did the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 Lead to More Democracy in China? The Tiananmen Square Protests, otherwise known as the June Fourth incident, was a series of student led protests and demonstrations in Beijing, China during the spring of 1989. The protests were driven by goals to eliminate corruption within the Communist Party and promote democratic ideals such as freedom of speech, freedom of press and social equality. At the height of the protest from June 3 4, hundreds of thousands of students gathered around Tiananmen Square to protest, prompting military mobilization and resulting in unprecedented bloodshed. Though deemed by the Chinese government as a counter revolutionary act, the Tiananmen Square Protest remains an important event in shaping the political and social state of China today. Not only was the the protest instrumental in exposing the deep division within China s political leadership, it also revealed that the future of China, comprised of students and intellectuals, was striving for a more democratic nation. With that being said, a highly debated question remains as to whether the Tiananmen Square Protest has led to more democracy in China, and how the event has influenced China s political progress. On the contrary, the protest had a rather paradoxical impact on China s regime. Rather than ending the rigid regime in place and bringing rise to democracy, Tiananmen led to the strengthening of the Communist party. The protests resulted ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n7.

No matter how wealthy a country may be, going to war can still strongly affect the economy without a doubt.

As stated earlier, Europe had suffered one of the most devastating impacts during and after WWII. In fact, Europe had suffered more economically after World War II for multiple reasons. Capital depletion was seen everywhere after the war, with cities torn apart and there were bomb craters on every street. Great Britain, inflation had increased rapidly and reached its peak following the war along with France. The currency started to become worthless because of how crumbled the economy had become. Even during the war, massive amounts of money were loaned from the United States to the allies in Europe just to keep the war funded. As a result, many countries in Europe ended up in an enormous amount of debt to America. This left millions of people having to live extremely hard and rough in Europe. Luckily, with the help of the United States, Europe was able to become stable again through the use of the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan was created by George Marshall who was the United States Secretary of the State and the idea was to help and support any European countries that had fell victim to the war such as France for example. So, these countries would then receive currency from the United States, which helped Europe extremely well and would have most likely fallen economically if the U.S. did not aid them through the use of the Marshall Plan.

Out of ample differential symbolic numbers, Dante showcases the number three throughout the allegorical tale of his journey through hell.

The three works include 33 cantos in each poem, with the exception of Inferno, totaling 100 cantos, which is the square of 10; 10 is the perfect number, for it is composed solely of the square of the Trinity plus 1, which represents the Unity of God.

Three beasts face against Dante within the beginning of the narrative poem: The Leopard, The Lion, and The She Wolf of Incontinence. Alongside to meeting the three animals, Dante also metaphorically encounters the three main kinds of sin committed within the Christian world: Incontinence, violence and fraud. Each sin corresponds according to a sin in the Bible and matches with each of the three beasts. Once Dante follows away from the three monsters and towards a pathway through hell, he encounters a ravenous three headed dog of Hell who characterizes as monstrous Cerebus, the ravening beast (Alighieri 44 45). Dante s usage of the number three within his choice of monsters furthermore portrays the reoccurring usage of the number in Inferno.

The Senate does not use discharges. The only other way to get a bill passed after it has been killed at this stage would be to reintroduce it. Then the bill would have to go back through the committees and subcommittees to be passed as law. Sixth, the next part of the lawmaking process is the floor debates. After the bill reaches the full chamber in the Senate and reaches the rules committee in the house decisions are made. Either two things will happen here, the bill will be scheduled for floor debates or it will be completely dropped. Usually bills that are able to make it this far in the process are passed into law.

An Analysis of the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglas An Analysis of the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglas In the autobiography Frederick Douglass presents a clear picture to me of a horrifying period of American history that far too few people understand. Douglass s personal narrative as a slave lets you feel the fear of his past and allows us to experience the suffering and pain inflicted by underserved beatings and an unhealthy lifestyle with too much physical exertion. Douglass expresses very personal feelings about his history and helps us to understand the intense hatred and disgust the American slave had for his possessor, and the sickness of hate that allowed human beings to keep other human being as slaves. The typical American slave standard of living was worse than... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... This was quite the main perception to their teachings to their slaves as being incapable of learning, fear kept the slaveholders from educating their slaves about the truth they consciously new. Douglass became convinced that the only way men can be enslaved is by remaining ignorant. This idea would pave the pathway to one of the greatest slave escapes of all time. The violence slaves endured was the most vivid representation in Douglass portrayal of slavery in the South. No emotion or rage was held back by slaveholders and no pity or sympathy was put forth either. Cruelty and abuse were the only means of control the slaveholders believed would keep order. The pain inflicted upon these individuals, even to the point of death in some cases, fueled the typical master s obsession with domination and power. However, throughout Douglass s turmoil, his religious faith remained exceptionally strong. At times he found himself questioning how might his God allow him to endure such grueling circumstances, but he never let his curiosity hinder his faith. He also questioned how a man could call himself a Christian and yet treat another human being in such a humane manner. Douglass could never comprehend how the slaveholders were able to justify slavery through their faith and church as some of his owners did.

The Trailer For Kill Bill The trailer for Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), the fourth film directed by Quentin Tarantino, is a fast paced, violent, and action packed trailer that pays homage to Japanese sword fighting, martial arts, and gunplay. The main character known as The Bride (Uma Thurman), is a former assassin whose former lover, Bill (David Carradine) attempted to kill her on her wedding day. After waking up from a coma, The Bride begins to tell her story about how she was attacked by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, which she was once a part of, while pregnant. The trailer begins with the click sound of a revolver s hammer being pulled back, and then firing. The camera is then positioned behind The Bride s butt, as she begins to narrate her story. Frames of the bullet are shown as she talks, until it hits its victim The Bride. She hits the floor in her wedding gown, after being shot in the head. A montage of violent sequences that start in an average suburban neighborhood, where she fights Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in her own home, and leads to a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath, where she fights yakuza boss O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Contrary to your average movie trailer involving action and violence, the perpetrators of these violent acts are the female characters, instead of the male characters. The protagonist is on a path of retribution against the assassins who crashed her wedding and attempted to kill her, but despite the fact that there is a male member of the Deadly Viper ...

Thus, Chase had mainly three kinds of concern at that stage: risk, profit and reputation. Reputation From Exhibit 6, there is no doubt that Chase was the top bank in syndicated finance in the US and over the world. However, it recorded limited performance in Asian market though Chase had put numerous resources into its global group. At the same time, Chase was among Disney s top relationship banks and Disney as well as its project in Hong Kong had a noticeable market signal. ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Although Chase argued that this term is rarely invoked and in Asia they have never invoked it, Disney was paying for a fully underwritten deal expressly to avoid syndication risk, especially the amount of the loan. If the syndication amount suddenly changes in the economy crises, it may bring serious trouble to the Disney s operation and financial stability. At the same time, if the price were to increase dramatically, it would be a high burden for Disney to pay the interest. Since Disney is one of the large clients, Chase may have to do some amendments to smooth the negotiation process. As chase, to remove or alter the rights to change the amount of the syndication may be acceptable as most of the loan have been assigned to other banks. However, some flexibility in terms of the pricing must be guaranteed to ensure the profitability of Chase in some certain economy downturn.

Post polio syndrome may affect polio survivors, even those with benign initial manifestations, years after recovery from their initial insult.

Polio in the United States: FDR, public awareness and development of the vaccine. By the early twentieth century, there were major polio epidemics in Europe and the United States. People exposed to poliovirus were conferred immunity even if they were asymptomatic. Improvements in sanitation resulted in reduced fecal contamination of water and food sources, thereby diminishing exposure to the poliovirus and decreasing immunity.

The Effect Of Genetic Diversity On Living Things Are The... The main cause of genetic diversity in living things are the five processes of evolution. These five processes genetic drift, gene flow, natural selection, speciation, and mutations all affect allele frequencies within a population in different ways, thus, creating genetic diversity. Population change is in direct relation to both genetic drift and gene flow. Genetic drift is defined as variation in the relative frequency of different genotypes in a small population. This variation is caused by two types of genetic drift also known as the Bottleneck effect and the Founders effect. A Bottleneck effect is typically caused by a random event such as hunting or a natural disaster which can significantly reduce a population. Although a population can gain back their original population size after a Bottleneck effect, their genes have been permanently affected, resulting in much less genetic variation than that of a population that was not affected by a Bottleneck effect. Examples of genetic diversity due to a Bottleneck effect include the lack of genetic variation due to intense hunting in the 1890 s within the Northern elephant seal population compared to the large Southern elephant seal population. A Founders effect occurs when individuals from a large population branch out and create a new colony. Due to the small population, the colony is more likely to have less genetic variation from the original population. An example of a Founders effect is the presence of Polydactyly ...

In 1977, the National Livestock Feeder s Association combined with the ANCA to create the National Cattlemen s Association, developing a wider membership in the cattle industry. Over the next 20 years the group was able to fully focus on its policy actions by concerning itself with several issues regarding future markets, food safety, and the environment. Finally, in 1996, the NCA merged with the Beef Industry Council of the Meat Board, allowing for full coverage of all aspects of the cattle industry and creating the National Cattlemen s Beef Association as it is known today (Patrick). The NCBA continues to fight against the same challenges it has faced in its more than a hundred year history as well as the new challenges of today. As recently as this week, the NCBA has had trouble influencing policy in its favor. The country of origin labeling requirements in the 2014 Farm Bill were not changed to the NCBA s liking (Farm Press).

Demographics And Its Impact On Health And Health In my research, I discovered that population trends will dramatically impact healthcare. Simply put the more people who exists the more healthcare that is required. Population is not the only factor and other sub factors of population such as age, race, and ethnicity or demographics and they also have an impact on Healthcare. For example, the population of people in the U.S. over the age of 65 in 1950 was only 8.1% of the total population. The trend of that number is expected to rise to 20.2% by 2050. Geographic trends can assist healthcare professionals where to focus their educational efforts in terms of healthcare availability. Psychographics examines the consumer or the factors that motive them such as values, attitudes, beliefs, motions, interests, and personalities. Demographic trends can be used to target specific gender and ethnic groups from a healthcare perspective. An example of this targeted healthcare is research showed that males, both non Hispanic and Hispanic, in the Michigan area where disproportionately affected by cancer (Kodjebacheva, Blankenship, Hayman Jr, Parker, 2016). The application of this is by knowing this data and data similar to it, we will be able to have focused HealthCare to the demographics that statistically need it more than others.

A leader s style can be classified as transactional, transformational, or what is considered level 5. A transactional leader creates a very structured environment. Those leaders employing transactional leadership create clearly defined responsibilities for employees and subordinates. Transactional leadership details the rewards for success; unfortunately, transactional leadership also encompasses an element of punishment for failure. The punishment can be something as simple as a reprimand for small infractions up to termination for more serious infractions; the consequences are usually well documented as a formal policy. The transformational leadership style goes far beyond transactional leadership. A transformational leadership style is characterized by high energy, sensibility, clarity in direction, and empathy. Transformational leaders inspire subordinates to go beyond the norm and achieve goals on a greater scale than they thought possible. The transformational leader promotes a mentoring relationship rather than a monitoring relationship. Which leadership style is better? The answer would be neither, both have their place. The culture and potential problems facing a company are factors that determine which leadership style works best. While the leadership style is important, the leader is just as important.

Mark Twain s A True Story Essay A True Story and How it Addresses the Rhetoric of Race As one of the great American authors, Mark Twain is recognized for his unique contributions as a writer, one of them being his involvements in the racial debates during the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of his works such as an excerpt from his Autobiography, stories from The Celebrated Jumping Frog from Calavaras County , Buck Fanshawe s funeral and A True Story have been particularly included in the selections of The Heath Anthology of American Literature to illustrate the nature of The American Society and its issue with race during the 19th and 20th centuries (Lauter 408). In A True Story , Mark Twain writes about the accounts of an elderly African Americanwoman as told to him by an ex slave that had previously worked at his sister in law s plantation. A True Story is more than a fascinating tale of an old black woman with a nature for being jovial; it shows Twain s unique way of addressing racial legacies of the Civil War and Reconstruction through literature. Twain s short story which is titled in full as A True Story, Repeated Word for Word as I heard it is a tale about Aunt Rachel, an African American woman who recalls her ordeals of hardship and torment while leading a life of slavery. The story begins as Aunt Rachel is seated on the front porch with the children under her care.

Two Other Aspects In The Health Category Are Life Expectancy Two other aspects in the health category are life expectancy and infant mortality rates. The United Arab Emirates has a life expectancy rate of 76.96 years and an infant mortality rate of 12.7%, which this mortality rate seems high, but sadly are much higher ones out there. Oman has a life expectancy rate of 76.59 years and an infant mortality rate of 16.8%, a little higher than the UAE s. Saudi Arabiahas a life expectancy rate of 75.50 years and an infant mortality rate of 11.5%, a little lower than the UAE s. But when comparing the UAE to countries like Brazil and India, they are lucky. India s life expectancy is 66.21 years, which is the lowest of all six of the countries that have been compared throughout this paper, and an infant... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Saudi Arabia has a poverty rate of 12.7% and China, with the lowest, has a poverty rate of 6.1%. China s poverty rate seems rather low, but when you do the math, they have about 78 million people who are living below the poverty line, which is a little over eight times the population of the United Arab Emirates. India and Oman have very similar poverty rates and the two highest in this comparison. India has a rate of 29.8% and Oman, with the highest at 32%. There must be some reason for the high poverty rates, let s look at the income inequality in all seven of these countries, starting with the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has a Gini coefficient, a statistical measure of the degree of variation or inequality represented in a set of values, of 36% (Wikipedia, 2017). It also has a GDP per capita of $43,048.85, which seems very high for a country with a 20% poverty rate. Oman, although I have not found a Gini coefficient, has a GDP per capita of $21,929.01, which is about half of the UAE s. Saudi Arabia has a Gini coefficient of 45.9% and it has a GDP like Oman s at $25,961.81. Brazil has a Gini coefficient of 51.1%, which means that the wealth isn t very spread around and many people are poor. Brazil s GDP per capita is $11,208.08, which is almost four time lower than the UAE s, but maybe that is because Brazil has a much larger population than the UAE. China has a Gini coefficient of 42.2% and a low GDP per capita of $6,807.43. China ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n43. American Beauty American Beauty A Sociological Movie Review American Beauty, a film that was written by Allan Ball and directed by Sam Mendes in 1999 is a unique piece that demonstrates many sociological themes throughout the development of the plot. The characters strive to portray themselves as the All American Family. They live in a nice house, drive nice cars and seem perfectly normal to the general public, but the audience is allowed to view the deep set issues that plague the main characters; Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn Burnham (Annette Bening), Jane Burnham (Thora Birch), and Jane s best friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari). As the plot develops there are many obvious parallels relating the lives of the characters to Merton s Strain... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... During the course of the film, Lester Burnham goes through a large change. When we first meet Lester he is living his life as a ritualist. He goes to work every day because that is what he is supposed to do, but he puts in little to no effort and he has little regard for the completion of his goals. He has no motivation. His marriage is failing and he has an empty relationship with his daughter. Lester says both my wife and daughter think I m this gigantic loser, and they re right, I have lost something. I m not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn t always feel thisВ…sedated. But you know what; it s never too late to get it back (American Beauty). From this statement we can see that there is going to be a change in Lester over the course of the movie. When he meets Jane s friend Angela we can see an immediate change in Lester. He lusts for her constantly and his life becomes consumed by trying to spend time with her and help her to be attracted to him. He suddenly becomes more enthusiastic about life. He describes this as feeling that he had been in a coma for twenty years and he is finally waking up. After this Lester completely alters his lifestyle. He leaves his job, begins to work out everyday, buys his dream car and starts smoking pot with Ricky Fitz.
