Friday, October 8, 2021 THE MONGOL MESSENGER 7 Arts Council of Mongolia, Delta Foundation Center, IV floor, Tourists Street-38, Chingeltei District Tel/Fax: 976-11-319015 E-mail: marketing@artscouncil.mn Web: www.artscouncil.mn ARTS COUNCIL OF MONGOLIA ARTS COUNCIL OF MONGOLIA ARTS Since 2008, the Arts Council of Mongolia (ACM), along with the generous support of ACM-US, has successfully implemented a Fellowship Program for empowering emerging cultural leaders. The program is designed to enhance leadership, management and marketing skills, and deepen the understanding of cultural policy, arts advocacy, and other related issues. Thus far, ACM has completed 13 phases of the Fellowship Program with over 270 arts and cultural managers and artists who are currently working in the field of visual art, performing art, literature, cultural heritage sites, media, press and arts administration. This year, ACM selected 19 arts managers and artists from different arts fields, and invited local and international experts to conduct 22 full- day and half-day sessions of training on arts management, leadership, fundraising, strategic thinking, leadership- sensitive management, intellectual property, creative industry, and arts marketing and communication. Selected ACM Fellows will be provided with a grant of $1,000 to implement a joint community service project. The projects will provide arts access and arts education for youth and the wider community through online activities.All theACM Fellow projects will be promoted and shared across social media channels. ACM would like to give special thanks to Mr.Walter Jenkins and Mr.Dwight Gee, ACM-US for supporting the Fellows Program and providing the opportunity for many Mongolian arts and culture leaders to grow and participate in this program. We would like to especially acknowledge Mr. Walter Jenkins for being an exemplary program leader. Since 2003, the Arts Council of Mongolia has initiated and implemented the 'Arts for Change' project, which aims to improve children's cognition and develop individual creativity through music, and fine arts. This year, ACM launched the 'Art for Change' music education project with the support of Oriflame Mongolia LLC. Due to the restriction currently in place for the COVID-19 pandemic, the project has been moved online completely in order to reach children and youth studying at home, ensuring that they still get to participate in the program from the safety of their homes. In order to bring in some world class music, ACM col­ laborated with pianist and music teacher Mr. T.Purev­ sukh, selecting three pieces composed by inter­ na­ tional and Mongolian composers. Using these pieces, he has prepared a series of three video tutorials with detailed explanations for the students to watch. In each lesson, professio­ nal musicians play and explain the music using the information about the com­ poser, the specific content of the musical piece, and the instruments played, with a level of learning appropriate to the child's age and maturity. ACM will distribute these videos to teachers across 30 schools. The program will be conducted by school music teachers using an online platform to engage the school students. Through this program, ACM hopes to reach children and youth who are interested in music, helping them find musical enrichment and learning. To learn more, please visit ACM’s YouTube channel where you will be able to find the 'Art for Change' music education videos.
