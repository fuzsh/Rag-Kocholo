These hankers know that only on WNAX can they get the penetrating local coverage they need. They know, too . . . from years of experience . . . that the only way to reach the 2^/4 million residents of Big Aggie Land is with WNAX-.570. THOSE WHO KNOW WERFUL WNAX-570 If you have a product to sell, there's 2^ million potential customers in broad and prosperous Big Aggie Land. The way to sell them is on WNAX-570. In Big Aggie Land, more than 80% of the total popula- tion listens to WNAX-570 three to seven times each week. It's this huge audience that makes WNAX-570 first in Big Aggie Land. The 21/4 million residents make Big Aggie Land America's 40th radio market. See vour Katz man for complete details.

Now the red star hangs over one island in the West- ern hemisphere ... is it going farther? In supplying the answer, WCKT's New Force journalism searches out the meaningful facts around the world ... in Moscow and five Russian provinces ... in Central America . . . and in Miami. On the eve of Communist Cuba's 26th of July celebration, WCKT telecasts the fifth hour-long program of a series investigating THE RED STAR PART V the Communists at work — with a startling, first-time film and video tape closeup of the leaders, the representatives, the people of 12 islands and territories that lie within Havana's geographical sphere of influence. Can Castro export Communism to the rest of the Caribbean and Latin America? Is he doing so now? If so, who is doing the carry- ing— and how? These are the questions South Floridians are asking about the men- ace that lies only 90 miles from Key West. WCKT is doing something about their need to know the answers. BISCAYNE TELEVISION CORPORATION WCKT- CHANNEL 7 • MIAMI • WCKR - RADIO 61 BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 I/I serving and selling Since its founding in 1949, WGAL-TV has firmly adhered to its philosophy of public service — a constant seeking for new and better ways to serve the many thousands of viewers in its wide coverage area. This Chan- nel 8 station is in first place in the large number of communities and cities it serves. For adver- tisers, this assures outstanding response and sales results. Channel 8 'Lancaster, Pa.* NBC and CBS Representative: The MEEKER Company, Inc. New York • Chicago • Los Angeles • San Francisco STEINMAN STATION Clair McCollough, Pres. 4 BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 CLOSED CIRCUir Cox for Cross? FBI security check made during past 10 days on FCC Broadcast Bu- reau Ciiief Kenneth A. Cox has led to speculation that he will be named FCC commissioner to succeed John S. Cross, Arkansas Democrat, whose term was to expire last Saturday (June 30). At deadline Friday there was no word from White House. Sen- ators, FCC and others in public life had been interviewed on what was de- scribed as \"expedited\" check of Mr. Cox but since FBI operates confidenti- ally, reason was not given. Dejected, Mr. Cross left Washing- ton for his Arkansas home Friday without knowing whether he was in or out. If his successor isn't appoint- ed, he can continue in office until ap- pointment is made but it's doubted whether he would elect that option. If Mr. Cox, 45, tough, tenacious and personable lawyer from Washington state (Democrat) is appointed, it would be real coup for FCC Chairman New- ton N. Minow, who vigorously op- posed Cross reappointment. Messrs. Minow and Cox think alike, which would mean support in crusade on i program and business controls. Juntilla new Broadcast chief? Believed already hand-picked as new Broadcast Bureau chief to suc- ceed Mr. Cox is James O. Juntilla. Mr. Juntilla, 38, became assistant chief last April, after rejoining FCC in March 1961 as assistant to bureau chief. He served as FCC attorney in Broadcast Bureau from 1949-1952, resigning to join Arnold, Fortas and Porter, Washington law firm. If Mr. Cox doesn't get FCC appointment now, he is regarded as shoo-in for vacancy to be created when term of Democratic Commissioner T. A. M. Craven expires year from now. Com- mander Craven, who will reach retire- ment age of 70 in January, isn't can- didate for reappointment. Curtis and Culligan Curtis Publishing Co. may be look- >i ing for more than new president and chief executive officer in negotiations it's been having with Matthew J. Cul- ligan for those posts. There's good chance Curtis hopes to shore up its flagging finances by getting into tv station ownership and is looking for top man who has broadcast as well as magazine experience. Mr. Culligan, currently corporate executive of In- terpublic Inc., has both but is heavi- est in broadcast. He formerly headed NBC Radio network, before that was rising NBC-TV executive. But before either, he was advertising director of group of Ziff-Davis publications (Ra- dio-Tv News, Photography, Flying, et al) and before that was with Good Housekeeping. Decision expected mo- mentarily on whether he and Curtis will get together. Currency slump hits sales Distributors of U. S. programs in foreign markets are reported to be dis- turbed by increasing devaluation of currency in various countries of world. Particular sore spots are said to be Canada, Argentina. Venezuela and Philippines. U. S. distributors are faced with problem of accepting fewer dollars or raising prices, and fear lat- ter alternative may price them out of markets. More blue-nosing If proposed congressional investiga- tion of movies and related advertising (which could involve television) gets underway, it will be conducted by special subcommittee of House Com- merce Committee under chairman- ship of Rep. Walter Rogers ( D-Tex. ) , who proposed inquiry. Rep. Rogers' original resolution suggested study be made by specially created House com- mittee. But when jurisdictional ques- tion was raised, he introduced sec- ond resolution, proposing job be done by special subcommittee of Commerce Committee, of which he is member. Commerce Committee Chairman Or- en Harris (D-Ark.) favors this ap- proach. Situation, however, is still iffy. Rules Committee, which is considering pro- posal, is said to agree with Rep. Rog- ers that movies are relying too heavily on sex to sell product. But committee hasn't yet cleared resolution for House vote, and there is no indication when it will. No director for TIG yet Selection of new director of Tele- vision Information Office may be made in fortnight by selection com- mittee. Retiring director, Louis Haus- man, made final report on tv image- promoting agency to NAB's Tv Board last week. Several names are under consideration. There's no evidence that radio wants or needs similar image operation, judg- ing by survey of NAB's Radio Public Relations Committee, consisting of board members. Survey showed unani- mous opposition to suggestion that \"Radio Information Office\" be formed. Committee is headed by Hugh O. Potter, WOMl Owensboro, Ky. Riverton again That \"economic injury\" Riverton, Wyo., am case was back before FCC last week (Broadcasting, May 28) and new instructions were issued to stafl:. Orders were to prepare issues for hearing on applications for two new Riverton ams — but on financial qualifications rather than whether city can support more than one station (it now has KVOW which protested new applications). FCC first ordered hear- ing on economic grounds but day later reconsidered and ordered that public disclosure of hearing be withheld (Broadcasting, May 14). Despite this action, \"economic issue\" hearing order was printed by mistake in Fed- eral Register (Broadcasting, May 21). At same meeting last week, FCC set for hearing on economic issue ap- plication for new am in Blythe, Calif, (see page 36). New Crowell-Collier chief Appointment of top broadcaster to head Crowell-Collier broadcast opera- tions as successor to Robert M. Pur- cell, transferred to new audio-visual field, expected soon. W. D. Cole, board chairman, and Raymond C. Hagel, president of parent company, have interviewed more than dozen station executives in past few weeks for presidency of Crowell-Collier Broadcasting Corp., wholly owned subsidiary of publishing company, which now operates radio stations KFWB Los Angeles; KEWB San Francisco; KDWB Minneapolis. Plans for expansion, including television ac- quisitions, also are under considera- tion.

Authored by Meyer Weinberg, book will be re- leased July 16.

Maryland voters who watched Channel Two the evening of the recent Primary Election were treated to the first on-the-air glimpse of a new electrically operated and illuminated scoreboard that could change its vote totals in two seconds. It works like a race track tote-board, and in fact, was developed on designs by WMAR-TV's Production Manager, Edwin B. Mick, by the American Totalisator Company. At our first dress rehearsal, the studio crew quickly dubbed the new machine \"Ed's Micks- master\" —and the name stuck. All evening long the \"Micksmaster\" reported, swiftly and vividly, the vote totals in 172 different election contests, from information gathered by a regiment of fifty reporters and tabulators who as- sembled the information for Sunpapers Television s veteran reporting team of David V. Stickle, Ernest V. Baugh, Jr., and the noted political cartoonist Richard Q. Yardley. But there's more to the \"Micksmaster\" than just a biennial use as an election device. Now it's in nightly use reporting the baseball scores for WMAR-TV's Oriole-rooters . . . and when Channel Two carries both NCAA and NFL football begin- ning in September the \"Micksmaster\" will be on hand with gridiron results of all the colleges and all the leagues. ''ED'S MICKSMASTER\"-designed especially for the WMAR-TV election coverage— scored an- other FIRST for the station that was FIRST on the air in Baltimore and remains FIRST in the viewing habits of Baltimoreans— and Marylanders!

Station will tele- cast sing-along version of anthem twice in evening and five times during day. Lyrics will be super- imposed on screen with back- grounds showing people singing and saluting flag. Audience will be urged to sing anthem. WCKT terms it \"a people's observance of Independence Day.\" First major step toward new NAB broadcast research and professional training program was taken by associ- ations joint board at Friday meeting in Washington with appointment of Mel- vin Goldberg, head of Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. research, as director of NAB research. Mr. Goldberg is one of industry's most experienced research executives. He is member of NAB Radio Develop- ment Committee which is studying pro- posals for birth-control in FCC's radio station grants. (See NAB Radio and Tv Board stories pages 42 and 43). With submission of Mr. Goldberg's name to NAB board, special research committee headed by Donald H. Mc- Gannon completed its work. New com- mittee to guide research-training proj- ect is to be named soon by President LeRoy Collins, who proposed it shortly after assuming office in January 1961. Research project will get off to flying start as result of special news research survey financed by WBC. Project is under direction of Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern U., Evans- ton, 111. Details of Mr. Goldberg's assignment haven't been worked out but it's be- lieved he will spend much or even all of his time in New York. He will re- port directly to President Collins and Vincent T. Wasilewski, executive vice president. This is equivalent to vice presidential level in NAB structure. News Research ■ WBC-Medill re- search is intended to analyze treatment of news in all media; study overlap of various media; analyze methods of news editors; get public's choice for length of newscasts; find what times of day are preferred, and learn public ac- ceptance and believability of newscasts. Total of more than 1,100 telephone interviews were conducted among ran- dom sample of population between May 28 and June 2 by professional survey firms with Medill overseeing work. Public interview section is complete. Media content is now being analyzed. Next will come personal interviews with news editors. Entire Westinghouse project, directed by Prof. Eugene Webb, is to be completed by Sept. 1 . Gov. Collins is understood to have told NAB board that WBC's donation of news survey will enable research- training unit to get ofl\" to much earlier start than anticipated. Local as well as national news are covered in survey, conducted in four markets — San Diego, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Boston. Mr. Goldberg, 39, joins NAB about Aug. 1 on a two-year contract. Back of NAB research program is desire to help industry provide continually bet- ter service to its audience. Mr. McGan- non said he was best suited among candidates for job. Mr. Goldberg joined WBC in 1956. Clair R. McCollough, Steinman Sta- tions, presided at joint board meeting. He was re-elected to post Friday. Fall Conference Dates ■ Joint board ratified Fall Conference format and set these dates for future board meetings: Jan. 14-18, 1963, Camelback Inn, Phoenix, Ariz.; June 24-28, 1963, Stat- ler-Hilton, Washington; Jan. 27-31, 1964, Far Horizons Hotel, Sarasota, Fla. Next meeting of State Broadcast Assn. Presidents will be held Feb. 27-28 at Shoreham Hotel, Washington. Board voted that at future meetings three radio directors shall sit with tv board and vice versa. Group of six would act as conference group and make recommendations to joint board. Resolution was adopted voicing ap- preciation to P. A. (Buddy) Sugg, former member of Radio Board. Board members paid tribute to Mrs. Ella Nelson, administrative assistant to Everett E. Revercomb, secretary-treas- urer, on 30th anniversary at NAB.

BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 90-minute man He is a multi-phased entertainer: a star comedian, actor, satirist; an author of short stories, a novel, an autobiography, a volume of poems; and a lyricist-composer (over 2,000 songs, 30 record al- bums) and pianist; and a discov- erer and developer of new talents. He is also a concerned citizen and public speaker, vitally inter- ested in the issues of our time. His name: Steve Allen. It's precisely because Steve Allen — as an entertainer and a man — combines all these talents that he was picked by WBC to be starred and enjoyed every week- day evening, for 90 minutes, by the millions of late-evening view- ers of the WBC TV stations; and of other individual TV stations who seek new levels of late-eve- ning programming. Yet, the full measure and mean- ing of WBC's Steve Allen Show can only be seen, in depth, behind what is visible on the TV tube. It's to be found in more than the fact that WBC's Steve Allen Show- is the largest programming project ever undertaken by a group of in- dividual TV stations. The full meaning of this series must be measured also by the way it fits into the basic concept of WBC's programming philosophy for its own and other TV stations. WBC has already produced such wide-ranging series as Inter- tel. . .Man and His Problems. . . Face of the World . . . Adventures in Numbers and Space... Reading Out Loud . . . American Civil War . . . English for Americans . . . Col- lege Presidents Speak, and others. Each of these series has been created to permit the WBC sta- tions to supplement the compre- hensive schedules of their affiliated networks; to fill and enlarge their local program services. Now, the Steve Allen Show adds a versatile new dimension to WBC programming— one of exceptional talent, entertainment and stimula- tion, for the many American fami- lies who like to end their day, happily, with television.

Consider for example the opening of a new automobile dealership in a large metropolitan area already served by many successful and long-established dealers. It takes a lot of courage. It also takes a lot of courage to try to crack this kind of market with an advertising campaign that is a com- plete departure from the ones that are being used by most of your competitors. But Doenges-Long Ford Inc., Denver, did it with the help of local radio; and the company is still growing. The Big Step ■ Don Doenges and Phil Long had operated a highly suc- cessful Ford dealership in Colorado Springs for 13 years when they decided to open a second dealership in Denver, the big market to the north. The big step took place in December 1958. It included a new-car showroom, a used car lot and a service department. At the start they recognized the need for an eiTective advertising program to help launch the venture. They con- tacted the Galen E. Broyles Co. (now Broyles, Allebaugh & Davis), which is the second largest agency in the Denver region and is the National Advertising Agency Network member for Colorado. Broyles handles many of the area's leading industrial and consumer ac- counts but it is not a local retail-service type agency. The Doenges-Long business philos- ophy, however, sounded so refreshing and intriguing that the agency's man- agement group accepted the auto deal- er's invitation to take on its campaign. Here was an automobile outfit which stayed completely away from flamboy- ance, extravagant claims, high-pressure selling, discounts, quick sales, \"big- deal\" trades and all of the other frantic hard-sell tactics which so many dealers about the country then were using. Radio All The Way ■ The Doenges- Long organization believes in and prac- tices the philosophy that an automobile is a big and important purchase — that the buyer is entitled to receive not only a fair deal but also a lot of considera- tion and respect. But the big question was: Which advertising medium will best project this philosophy to the buy- ing public? The answer — after we tabulated the results of a nationwide survey that we conducted through member agencies of the NAAN and studied the local mar- ket area carefully — was radio. The 20 finding was that no other medium could quite convey the warm, personal kind of service that is the Doenges-Long hallmark. Once radio had been selected as the sole medium, the next question was how to use it best. What kind of a com- mercial, for instance, would work best? Because its operation was so different from that of many dealers, Doenges- Long would have to sound different. So it was obvious that the commercials would have to be low-key, soft-sell, quiet and matter-of-fact. Personal Touch ■ What finally evolved was a 60-second commercial format that included a brief musical theme introduction; a succinct and straightforward message delivered by Don Doenges' son, Conrad, and five seconds of the closing theme. Simple, but successful. Why did we choose a member of the family to voice the commercials? One reason was because his delivery is sin- cere, smooth, quiet and of high profes- sional quality but without that profes- sional \"slickness\" we wished to avoid. Equally as important, we gained a personal touch which would have been impossible to achieve with any other announcer. The words, \"This is Con- rad Doenges, speaking for Doenges- Long . . .\" immediately added strong believability to the message. We launched the campaign in Jan- uary 1959, using a modest budget and a semi-saturation spot schedule on two Denver stations plus a quarter-hour newscast on a third. The selection of stations was dictated solely by pro- gramming formats such as \"good mu- sic\" and \"public service.\" We felt these were the type of stations which attracted the kind of listeners who would be most responsive to the commercial message. At the present time the Denver area stations being used in the campaign in- clude KLZ, KBTR, KDEN and KOSI (Aurora). We are using spots on KLZ and spots and newscasts on the others. The budget today is about double that at first. Good Results ■ Starting in December 1958 as one of the smallest (in terms of sales) Ford dealerships in the five- state Denver district, Doenges-Long climbed to 24th place during its first year of radio, 17th in the second. To- day it ranks 15th among the 160 deal- ers in the Denver district. In the three years since the first Doenges-Long commercial was broad- cast, the concept and format, including the theme music, have remained entire- ly the same. During this period the firm also moved its Denver operation to a new 27-acre site about a mile south of its original location there. How does Doenges-Long look at the future? Very realistically. The spon- sor says, \"Although our current sched- ule has been established after a con- tinuing and careful analysis of our mar- ket and of the various radio stations serving the area, we do not intend to remain static. Because radio has served our business so well, we intend to ex- pand our use of the medium in direct proportion to our sales and the growth of our market area. \"This means that we and our agency will continue to devote a great deal of time to the evaluation of our prospect market and of the stations themselves to make this proposed expansion on the most intelligent and practical basis pos- sible.\" Hardly a day goes by without favor- able comment from the public about the radio campaign. Some are in per- son, others by phone and by letters. Typical: \"We came out here to buy our car because your radio advertising sounds so sincere.\" What sponsor could wish for more? Bob Geddy joined the copywriting and account service staff of Broyles, Allebaugh & Davis in 1959 and was promoted to his present position early this year. Previous- ly, for 11 years, he was with Alexander Film Co., Colorado Springs, as publicity and script writer, director of pulDlic rela- tions and sales promotion manager. Dur- ing World War II he served as a fighter pilot with the Sixth Air Force. He attend- ed Colorado State U. He is married and the father of three girls. Hobby; fishing.

Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. and Ted Bates Co., the principal protagon- ists, made peace on terms that seemed to offer a formula for reconciling simi- lar differences between other stations and agencies. No more than '\"a hand- ful\" of such differences was said to re- main. The Bates-Westinghouse agreement tacitly recognizes the argument of West- inghouse— and many other broadcast- ers— that it is no longer possible to as- sure advertisers that their commercials will be separated from their competi- tors' by at least 15 minutes in even,\" case. But it also recognizes the right of advenisers to ask for 15-minute protec- tion and to exercise alternative iuda- ments when that much isn't available. Given Choice ■ The nub of the agreement is that advertisers who spe- cify 15-minute protection will be noti- fied— and given their choice of several options — when the station has adequate notice that full 15-minute separation cannot be provided (see text, page 25). The options available to the adver- tiser in these cases will be to retain the spot and accept the conflict: retain the spot but substitute copy for another product: move his commercial to a spot where 15-minute protection is possible — or -exercise his rights of cancellation. The cancellation option is not spe- cified in the official description of \"pro- cedure\" issued last week by Westing- house. But it was clear that this alter- native would be available if none of the three explicitly stated options was satisfactory to the advertiser. Normal notice on cancellations is two weeks. WBC made clear that giving no- tice of actual or impending conflicts would depend in each case on its hav- ing adequate notice itself. This was an apparent safeguard against conflicts caused by unannounced or inadequately announced changes in the scheduling of commercials within network participa- tion (\"spot carrier\") programs. If ad- vance notification to the agency is \"be- yond station control,\" the WBC state- ment said, \"station will not be held re- sponsible.\" All is Forgiven ■ Edward A. Grey, senior vice president in charge of media operations at Bates, welcomed the West- inghouse announcement and said he had immediately instructed Bates buyers to resume doing business with Westing- house stations.

BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 23 PRODUCT PROTECTION PEACEPACT continued sion, had begun cancelling business on WBC stations when the Bates-Westing- house impasse developed almost six weeks ago. The business thus with- drawn, Mr. Grey said, was placed on competing stations — after getting their assurances that the customary 15-min- ute protection standard would be ob- served. Last week he said the billings would be reinstated on Westinghouse stations provided the values equal or ex- ceed those on the stations which were substituted. WBC's procedural statement reported- ly was worked out after discussions not only with Bates officials but with sev- eral other leading agencies. In addi- tion, a number of other agency author- ities also indicated, unofficially, that they regard it as a satisfactory solution to a difficult problem. Want Protection ■ Agencies almost uniformly want 15-mintue protection, but most are less insistent than Bates and none has followed Bates' lead in threatening to cancel schedules on sta- tions not granting it. Many have indi- cated they consider the problem a mat- ter for case-to-case handling. Westinghouse's new procedural prac- tices will apply in its dealings with all The following new products were re- ported last week to have entered spot tv on at least a test basis. Their activ- ity was detected by Broadcast Advertis- ers Reports, national monitoring serv- ice, in its off-the-air taping of local tele- vision advertising and is described here as part of a continuing series of new- product reports compiled for Broad- casting each week. The arrival of new products in tele- vision identifies them — often for the first time — as potential sources of fu- ture business for stations generally, and as potential competitors for other ad- vertisers and agencies. Broadcasting's reports will list, each week, all prod- ucts which during the latest monitoring period appeared for the first time in BAR records, whether they are entire- ly new products or are existing products not recorded in spot television before.

It emerged during a week in which, independently, the broadcast media committee of the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies reportedly reached generally similar conclusions about the handling of conflicts. Committee authorities declined to comment on the outcome of their meet- ing held last Tuesday, except to say that a statement on product protection may be issued within the next few weeks. It was understood, however, that the com- mittee took the customary agency posi- tion that a breakdown in the 15-minute protection standard would weaken tele- vision values. But it also was believed to have concluded that, as many sta- tions contend, 15 minutes' separation is not always feasible and that in such situations the advertiser should at least be advised of the conflict. Whether the committee considered specific procedures could not be deter- mined. Draft Ready ■ A draft outlining the committee's position in detail has been prepared, but its issuance was said to await clearance by other AAAA author- ities. Spokesmen said it was possible the statement would not be issued, but indicated that it probably would be. The 10-second announcements in north central area. Product: Skis IVIenthol cigarettes.

The belief that the furore of the past few weeks had just about run its course was buttressed by Mr. Grey's estimate that the number of stations that have filed unacceptable product-protection assurances with the Bates agency has been reduced to \"a handful.\" These, he said, include NBC and its five owned television stations, which cut their guaranteed-protection base from 15 minutes to 10 last year, and WTVJ (TV) Miami. He said he anticipated little difficulty in reaching a negotiated agreement with NBC. Despite the failure of either the NBC network or its owned stations to guarantee more than 10 minutes, he said that he had never experienced any problems in getting at least 15. But since he had insisted on 15-minute as- surances in writing from other stations, he felt that \"in fairness to the others\" he should insist on written assurances from NBC, too. Eight Others ■ Aside from the five NBC stations and WTVJ, Mr. Grey said he had \"unacceptable\" replies from — but was still in negotiation with — a total of eight other stations. The station policies on protection were submitted after Mr. Grey can- vassed all stations last month — imme- diately following the impasse with Westinghouse — seeking \"reconfirma- tion\" of the 15-minute protection stand- ard. He said that as of last Thursday he had received replies from 460 out of 493 canvassed. Those who had not re- plied, he indicated, are in relatively small markets. He said new letters would go out to them shortly. These will be the third queries for these sta- tions; a second went out two weeks ago when the number of non-respondents stood at about 100. \"I'm truly delighted,\" Mr. Grey said last week after the Westinghouse dead- lock had been broken and the number of \"unacceptable\" replies had dwindled, \"that the stations in such overwhelming numbers have recognized their obliga- tion to the advertiser in doing every- thing reasonably possible to help him sell his products effectively. \"That, after all, was our basic objec- tive to begin with.\" Bates Memo ■ He was even more exuberant in a memo sent Wednesday to other members of the Bates manage- ment and staff: \"We are happy to advise all con- cerned that the Westinghouse Broad- casting Co. has just reversed its previous position on product protection. West- inghouse will shortly release a statement in which they will reconfirm the mini- mum 15-minute product protection for New products testing television 24 (BROADCAST ADVERTISING) BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 Arrangement that settled Westinghouse-Bates differences Here's the procedural arrangement that ended the product-protection differences between Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. and Ted Bates & Co. last week — -and seemed to point the way to resolution of most sim- ilar differences that remain between other stations and Bates or other agencies. Issued by Westinghouse and welcomed as satisfactory by Bates (and, unofficially, by other leading agencies), it leaves un- changed WBC's policy against guar- anteeing more than 10 minutes' sep- aration between commercials for competing products, yet gives ad- vertisers insistent on 15-minute pro- tection a choice of several options when full 15-minute separation isn't possible: Compromise Plan ■ \"The proce- dure for implementation of the WBC May 1, 1962 Product Protection Policy. \"Whenever a local or national spot advertiser indicates that he wishes to buy only in those locations where his commercial is separated from a competitive commercial by 15 min- utes and station has sufficient ad- vance notice (given to it by the net- work where it is involved), or sub- sequent to his buying the schedule station is informed that his commer- cial will be within 15 minutes of a competitive product it will be station practice to do the following: \"1) Advise the advertiser of the fact.* \"2) Afford him the following al- ternatives: \"A. Remain in the present loca- tion. \"B. Permit the advertiser to sub- stitute a different product of his for the commercial involved. \"C. Move the announcement to another available location, at the applicable rate. \"*In those instances where any competitive conflict occurs because advance notification to the agency was beyond its control, station will not be held responsible.\" I all spot advertising. I \"We are indeed grateful for all of the j support we have received from our cli- I ents in this long, lonely and grueling period.\" Westinghouse authorities said they were very happy that the deadlock had been broken but denied flatly that they had \"reversed\" their position. They pointed out that the policy which went into effect May 1 still stands: it does not offer assurance of more than 10 minutes' protection — and in the case of advertising adjacent to network spot- carriers, sports events and the like, does not guarantee anything. Found Compromise ■ Instead of \"reversing\" their stand, they said, they have found a procedural way to imple- ment their policy and still assure ad- vertisers who want 15-minute protec- tion that they'll either get it or have a chance to make the most attractive one of several alternative moves. They emphasized again that their re- fusal to promise full 15-minute protec- tion as a matter of policy does not mean that most advertisers will receive less than a full 15-minute separation from rival products. But the growing number of products using television — and particularly the rise of spot-carrier selling by the networks — has made 15- minute protection increasingly difficult, and hence, they said, it was deemed advisable to put the standard on a foot- ing which they knew they could meet in all cases. The number of \"unacceptable\" pol- icies in Mr. Grey's files was not re- duced to the current 14 without con- siderable negotiating on his part. A substantial number of stations revised their first statements after further dis- cussion. Some which first said they could promise no more than to do their best subsequently submitted letters de- fining their best as 15 minutes. Others devised variations which proved to be \"acceptable.\" Corinthian Broadcasting, for exam- ple, made a strong and successful ar- gument that local news, sports and weather programs which are shorter than 15 minutes in length have certain built-in differences — different personal- ities, different subject matter, different sets — which distinguish the shows from one another and tend to set them apart in viewer's minds, even when they're presented in tandem. Thus, Corinthian received Mr. Grey's acceptance of a policy which specifies only 10 minutes' protection for commericals within or between local programs of less than 15 minutes' duration. That ARB-TvB dispute is now official RESEARCH FIRM, BROADCASTER GROUP DIFFER ON AUDIENCE AGE DATA The long-simmering dispute between American Research Bureau and a spe- cial committee of TvB over ARB's plans to add audience age data to its local tv market reports (Broadcasting, June 18) was brought officially into the open last week. ARB contended its move is intended to meet \"a growing demand\" from ad- vertisers and agencies. The TvB com- mittee said it finds no widespread de- mand among agencies — at least not for this specific information and in this form — but concluded that broadcasters would be \"saddled\" with it \"for the foreseeable future, until agency and sta- tion demand for modification, expressed in the only practical way left, is clear to ARB.\" To other charges that broadcasters would bear the brunt of the cost, ARB officials replied that price increases scheduled for the local reports would not be \"steep\" and would result almost entirely from generally increased costs of doing business, not from the expan- sion of service. They estimated that the rate to broadcasters would go up about 17% to 20%, and said the price for agencies also would be increased when their current contracts reach expiration date. Two-way Expansion ■ Inclusion of the new age data in the local reports is a part of a two-way expansion program slated by ARB for this fall. The other part is introduction of semiannual ssp- plements containing more detailed dem- ographic data on audiences, to be issued as part of the regular ARB subscription. In a June 19 letter to clients. Jack L. Gross of ARB said addition of new demographic material to the regular local report service was decided after \"long and careful study,\" consultation with agencies and advertisers, two major test reports which received \"very, very favorable\" reaction, and additional tests of the procedures and the feasibility, re- liability and validity of the material. \"Our major opposition,\" Mr. Gross wrote, \"arose from station organiza- tions, the most articulate of our critics being TvB, whose committee recom- mended a withholding period of one year. In the face of such criticism there was an overwhelmingly favorable re- BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 (BROADCAST ADVERTISING) 25 sponse from our clients.\" He quoted approving comments from several unidentified clients and said ARB had decided to go ahead with its project because the additional informa- tion \"is needed and can be used now,\" will be helpful to \"all members of the broadcast industry\" and will mean \"in- creased efficiencies in media planning.\" Moreover, he said, \"the validity and re- liability of such data is proven and is Mr. Kearney guaranteed by ARB.\" Interim Report ■ The TvB special committee, created last spring and des- ignated the TvB Committee on Tele- vision Research Standards and Prac- tices, officially made its position known in an interim report submitted by its chairman, Don L. Kearney of Corin- thian Broadcasting Co., and released by TvB last week. Mr. Kearney's report said \"only three\" of ten leading agencies surveyed indicated they had ordered the new ARB service, but that \"it is clear . . . that this whole development is primarily the result of pressure from a small num- ber of very large and very important agencies and major clients who are those farthest advanced in planning for use of computers.\" He said the TvB committee found agreement among agencies on the need for more demographic information on the local level — but no agreement on what kinds of information are most needed. Because the committee also found that \"nearly all\" of the surveyed agen- cies expressed \"some dissatisfaction\" with current sample sizes and \"stabil- ity\" of both ARB and A. C. Nielsen Co. local reports, he said, it felt they should concentrate first on these areas and, \"for the time being,\" issue any addi- tional demograohic data in \"separate reports, at possibly extra cost, to adver- tisers, agencies and stations for their special uses.\" Mr. Kearney's report quoted A. C. Nielsen Co. as saying it is still studying the question of issuing additional demo- graphic data but had found disagree- ment among agencies and advertisers \"as to what is needed or required.\" It said Nielsen indicated that if it does offer such additional information, it will do so as an optional or supplementary Mr. Gross service with separate charges, without increasing the costs of the regular Niel- sen Station Index (NSI) service.

How advertising can achieve this im- provement was treated by other speakers at the four-day meeting, the first joint AFA-AAW get-together in 30 years. To achieve a united front for action on education, legislation and public re- lations, the members of AFA and AAW overwhelmingly adopted resolutions to establish a joint commission to work out procedures toward that end. The election of Mac Martin and Donald W. Davis to the Advertising Hall of Fame honoring deceased adver- tising pioneers was announced. Mr. Martin, who owned and operated an agency in Minneapolis, crusaded for truth in advertising and helped found the Better Business Bureau of Minnea- polis. Mr. Davis followed 17 years as a newspaper advertising salesman with 37 more as professor of advertising at Pennsylvania State U., where he built enrollment in advertising to the largest of any school in the country. AFA public service awards were pre- sented to two living advertising leaders: John C. Cornelius, former executive vice president in charge of western op- erations for BBDO in Minneapolis, and Don Belding, former board chairman of Foote, Cone & Belding, Los Angeles. More Skepticism ■ Noting the in- creasing levels of education among the public Mr. Crichton said the available evidence suggests that the better edu- cated a person is, the more critical and skeptical he is about advertising. Warning his hearers not to \"brush off these people as eggheads, theorists or double-domes,\" Mr. Crichton declared: \"these are the men who hold the key jobs today and will be much more in- fluential tomorrow. These are the men we must be prepared to meet in man- agement, science, government, educa- tion ... we have to realize that the in- telligence explosion and the deliberate cultivation of the intellect have produced a new public. We must prepare our- selves and our products to meet it.\" Advertising should make better use of the nation's colleges and universities, both as \"think factories\" to work on the problems of advertising and as a way to speed advertising's progress from a trade to a profession, T.S. Repplier, president of The Advertising Council, advised the Tuesday session. \"The young lawyer can be illogical, the young doctor can have no humanity and few will be the wiser. But if the young copy- writer is a jerk and has a jerk for a client, 10 million people will soon know it and will once again laugh scornfully at advertising. Only when the profession- al calibre of as many as 95% of those in advertising is high will our faces cease turning red.\" Government Front ■ A proposal that advertising stop fighting government and launch a campaign to get government to use advertising instead of attacking it was advanced Tuesday morning by Thomas B. Adams, president of the Campbell-Ewald Co., Detroit. To deal with the problems of adver- Agencyman Adams Let's teach the government tising on an international scale and ad- vertising that will be effective with the better educated, more sophisticated con- sumer at home, the industry is going to need all the help it can get, Mr. Adams commented. The job of attracting the very finest creative brains to advertising is likely to become more and more difficult, David Bascom, board chairman of Guild, Bascom & Bonfigli, told the Tues- day morning assembly. Advertising's major appeal to the creative person, he said, is that \"advertising probably calls for more versatility than the other major areas of creativity . . . But the advantages are countered by reasons why advertising does not at- tract today's outstanding creative minds. \"It offers the least opportunity for per- sonal glorification. The creative person who becomes an author, an artist, a composer or a dramatist has his name on public view at all times. Even the assistant costume designer for the third- rate television shows is listed in the roll- up credits at the end, even though no one reads them. Advertising is the one creative area where the creator must forever remain anonymous. . . . New Yardsticks? ■ Rising costs, in- creased competition and lowered profit margins are forcing a re-evalua- tion of some traditional advertising yardsticks. Max Banzhaff, director of advertising, Armstrong Cork Co., told the Monday morning meeting. \"In the lush days of the early post- war period,\" he stated, \"reach and fre- quency were all important, as the the- ories of power marketing were applied with enthusiasm and vigor. The formula for success was to spend enough to cap- ture the market and sales and profits would surely follow. . . . Those days appear to be over. Dollars are too diffi- cult to come by to take long gambles in the market place. The public no longer responds ... to the sheer weight of ad- vertising alone. \"The much publicized rise in consum- er sophistication should adequately ex- plain why reach and frequency must give ground to impact in a re-evalua- tion of advertising yardsticks. I do not mean that reach and frequency are un- important. I do mean that they must receive less consideration as impact rises in importance. ... by impact I don\"t mean multi-pages, gatefolds. spectacu- lars or other gimmicks. . . . \". . . It is far better to appeal strongly to those who are really interested in a product than to offer a watered down appeal that tries to reach everyone. That's what I mean by impact. . . .\" Real World-Ad World ■ The contrast between the world of real people ex- periencing real emotions and advertising's incredible world of make-believe was dramatically emphasized in a sound film presented Tuesday by Don Tennant, vice president in charge of the tv com- mercial department of Leo Burnett Co. \"In this best of all possible worlds we have created,\" the voice declared, \"every man is heroic, or so it seems,\" as the screen showed handsome male models and then a bevy of beautiful women as the announcer continued: \"We have created a world of beauty in abundance and if you have nothing much to say, at least have a pretty girl say it. Even the children are well- mannered and seem to stay awfully clean\" fand they were seen just that way). People were shown using prod- ucts happily. . . . But in the world we're 28 (BROADCAST ADVERTISING) BROADCASTING, July 2, 1962 tn'ing to reach, if we ask Is anybody listening out there?' the answer we\"re likely to get is: 'Don't bother us; we're busy,' , , . \". . . They have an uncanny knack for spotting the phony and ignoring tht, strident, for passing by the ordinarv and sneering at advertising that patroii- izes them. And you wonder, as yoxi look at a lot of our advertising today, just who is being naive, the public or the advertising world?\" Circuit Rider ■ The AAAA has put its new president on the road with a schedule that would make the hardiest campaigner shudder. Four major speeches before four important audi- ences in less than a week is the schedule John Crichton faced and completed in late June. On June 22, he told the Colorado Broadcasters Assn. at Boulder how to hasten radio's renaissance (Broaekiasting. June 25). Four days later (last Tuesday) he made his AFA- AAW convention speech. The next day (Wednesday) Mr. Crichton told the AAAA's Northern California Council at a luncheon meet- ing in San Francisco to stop wearing '\"button-down hair shirts\" and to trade unhealthy introspection for a realistic outlook on advertising and the world in /^idvertiser Banzhaff It's time for re-evaluation which it operates. The day after (Thurs- day) he gave his Southern California con- stituents a banquet address which told them what the AAAA is doina to create a better climate for advertising. 'To hear us talk in the advertising business,\" Mr. Crichton told his San Francisco audience, \"one might think the public thought only of us — and our problems. Let me assure you that the public spends no time worrying about the damage advertising may be doing to its collective psyche. Nor does it lavish its love on us in eternal gratitude for having cleared its eight sinus cavities. \"If there is any collective quality of the public, it is indifference. Where it finds advertising which is helpful, in- formative or amusing, it absorbs it and acts on it. Where the advertising is silly, dull and irrelevant, it ignores it. Where the advertising is annoying, re- pulsive or misleading, the public is in- dignant. . . .\" In Los Angeles, the AAAA president stated: \"we are now moving to create the best climate for the advertising busi- ness we know how.\" Mr. Crichton cited the organization's new creative code, \"which begins with an acknowledgement of the responsibili- ties of advertising to the public and to the advertiser,\" and the new film on the attitudes of thought leaders toward ad- vertising.

ADMEN TALKS ON LEADERSHIP AT NAAN MEETING Most advertising agencies are quick to offer leadership counsel to their cli- ents in various areas, but too few really practice what they preach, Henry J. Kaufman, managing director of Hen- ry J. Kaufman & Assoc., Washington, D.C, said last week. The agency busi- ness, he said, \"won't reward you until your leadership starts showing.\" Mr. Kaufman was the keynote speak- er Wednesday in San Juan, P. R., at the 31st annual management conference of the National Advertising Agency Net- work. The Kaufman agency is the NAAN affiliate in the Nation's Capi- tal. \"You who head advertising agencies today may still be pretty hot writers, wonderful visualizers, terrific campaign planners, solid researchers and superior merchandisers, any one or any combi- nation of these essential to our busi- ness,\" Mr. Kaufman explained, \"but unless you are a leader, a good solid leader, you'd better not try to be an advertising agency owner-manager.\" He urged agency owners to do as well in planning and performing for themselves and their agencies as they do for their clients if they wish to progress. Mr. Kaufman said, \"Your leadership begins to show when you first recognize your own shortcomings, when you dis- Howard Caldwell (center), newly elect- ed president of the National Advertis- ing Agency Network, takes over from retiring president Arlyn Cole (left).

Doctors are given anti-cigarette plan Legislation against all cigarette ad- vertising and an intensive educational campaign against smoking were sug- gested last week by a physician report- ing on new evidence linking cigarettes and lung cancer. The proposal was made by Dr. E. E. Rockey of New York City during a joint session in Chicago of the Ameri- can Medical Assn. section on diseases of the chest and the American College J of Chest Physicians at the AMA con- vention. It was one of several develop- ments in little more than a week on the smoking controversy. All could have a broad social and economic im- pact (Broadcasting, June 4). The others: ■ Sen. Maurine B. Neuberger (D- Ore.) on Tuesday announced that the AMA board of trustees had responded to her request that the AMA take an official position on the tobacco issue. She said AMA's board has ordered a detailed study. ■ AMA headquarters in Chicago said its board has directed the AMA Coun- cil on Drugs to study the relationship between cigarette smoking and disease. A preliminary report is expected in about a year and a final report some six months later. The AMA house of delegates did not act on a formal reso- lution, \"The Health Hazards of Cig- arette Smoking.\" ■ Cigarette smoking may be a con- tributing factor in heart failure as well as lung cancer, according to a four- physician research report read June 24 before a Chicago meeting of the Amer- ican College of Chest Physicians. - The ACS on June 22 voted to sur- vey college presidents and to query the Federal Trade Commission about the propriety of cigarette sponsorship of college athletic events (At Deadline, June 25).

FTC takes on the aspirin industry in special inquiry New headaches he ahead for aspirin manufacturers. The Federal Trade Commission an- nounced an industry-wide investigation last week of analgesic makers to de- termine whether their advertisements contain false claims and unfair dis- paragement of competitors. At the same time the FTC shelved four pending cases involving analgesic advertising so simultaneous action can be taken on the basis of the investiga- tion and \"treatment given each adver- tiser consistent with that given all his competitors.\" (At Deadline, March 20, 1961). The four companies were charged with false advertising in 1961. Each, for example, claimed that his product relieves pain faster than any competing product. The companies, their products and their 1961 gross time tv billings: Amer- ican Home Products Corp. (Anacin — $2,243,330); Bristol-Myers Co. (Buffer- in— $3,009,870; Excedrin— $556,750) ; Plough Inc. (St. Joseph's aspirin — $1,- 235,260) and Sterling Drug Inc. (Bay- er aspirin — $813,530). Analgesic ad- vertisers as a group spent $37,354,592 in 1961 at gross rates in television, ac- cording to Television Bureau of Ad- vertising. Many are also regular users of radio. FTC questionnaires will go to anal- gesic makers. The FTC said it will probably seek \"the extent to which each [manufactur- er] may have made comparative tests with competitive products and the thoroughness with which advertisers' testing of analgesics, in areas unrelated to relief of pain, has been made as supportive of claims that the prepara- tions do not upset the stomach and do more than relieve pain.\" The FTC plans a particularly close look at claims of fast, fast, fast relief; tension relief, and anti-depressant and medical qualities in treatment of colds and flu. The FTC emphasized the investiga- tion does not indicate the agency be- lieves any of the analgesic claims vio- late the Federal Trade Act. Any action will come only if the advertising is, in fact, misleading, the agency said. Al"
