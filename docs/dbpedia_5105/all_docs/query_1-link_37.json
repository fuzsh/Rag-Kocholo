This 1960 American novel is one of the most popular books of all time, but it has attracted relatively little critical commentary. Although there is no doubt the 1962 award-winning movie propelled sales even higher, the book had won the Pulitzer and was a best seller before there was any movie, so success cannot be attributed to Horton Foote, screenwriter, and the performance of Gregory Peck. The novel famously stands for and by itself. In fact, Ms. Lee refused to write even a brief introduction to the thirty-fifth anniversary edition, stating that “Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive without preamble.” It has survived indeed. Mockingbird sales have probably exceeded forty million copies, selling about a million a year in recent years, and half of that million is sold abroad, in one of the approximately forty languages into which the novel has been translated. In this volume of commentary on Mockingbird, there are two related points to make about To Kill a Mockingbird and its lack of commentary. First, the fact that it is an American best seller, a popular book, weighs against it. The best-seller list is so laden with thrillers, genre fiction, mysteries, fantasies, and romances that it has, understandably, become a commonplace to associate popularity with the second-rate, following the logic that “If that many people like it, it can’t be any good.” The indisputably authoritative The History of Southern Literature, edited by Louis D. Rubin, Jr., et al., has only one paragraph about Mockingbird, with three brief mentions given to Lee in the section on Truman Capote. Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind is discussed in two pages of text, and in a section entitled “Popular Fiction, 19201950.” What these two novels share, besides having been given short shrift in this 1985 literary history, is that both have since risen in critics’ estiAbout This Volume\n\nvii\n\nmations and both are now upgraded, as it were, from popular fiction to literary fiction, and are, more and more often, written about, interpreted, understood from a variety of points of view. The second reason one might offer for the lack of commentary on Mockingbird is that at a basic level of reader response, it does not seem to need much. Mockingbird is, to put it mildly, not like James Joyce’s Ulysses or Finnegans Wake or William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury or, more recently, Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow. Readers, over forty-eight years in forty-some countries, believe quite rightly that they understand the novel. They feel that they “get it” without the interpretive help needed for more intellectually complex works such as Joyce’s or Faulkner’s or Pynchon’s. Mockingbird needs little “unpacking.” I think it could be successfully wagered that the sales-to-essay ratio of To Kill a Mockingbird is the highest of any well-known American novel. It may even be a million to one. But a work of such huge popularity will generate a different kind of interest and curiosity—what is it about Mockingbird that causes it to resonate so? And, since it is in fact a sophisticated work of art, when carefully examined, depths and dimensions not previously suspected are revealed. Also, a success of this magnitude, by an author who has remained a very private person, generates a good deal of curiosity about the publishing history of the book and the biography of the author. Several of the essays in this volume take up the general questions of author biography and publishing/sales history. Edythe M. McGovern offers such an overview of the author and novel, as does, very briefly, Sasha Weiss of The Paris Review. An extended essay by Nancy Grisham Anderson, “Successes and Myths,” does a clear and reliable job of outlining the history of the book, its dramatizations, its worldwide success and the much misunderstood life of the author, including laughable errors such as the dedication to “Mr. Lee and Slice” being misunderstood as Ms. Lee’s husband and child, when she has neither, and the myth that Ms. Lee is in fact deceased. Not true. You can ask her. viii\n\nCritical Insights\n\nReaders who want what is at present the most authoritative and complete study of Harper Lee and her novel are advised to go to Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, a full-length biography by Charles J. Shields (Henry Holt, 2006). Ms. Lee did not authorize or cooperate in the creation of this book, but Shields, through diligent research and many interviews, was able to do an excellent job nevertheless. Another essay which attempts an overview of the novel’s history and major themes is “Mockingbird in Context,” by Gurdip Panesar. Panesar explores some of the autobiographical elements in Mockingbird and points out a number of places the novel has received negative critical attention—in the depiction of African-Americans, for example, and in what are sometimes perceived as lawyer Finch’s personal and professional shortcomings. Neil Heims, in “‘Were You Ever a Turtle?’: To Kill a Mockingbird— Casting the Self as the Other,” elaborates at some length on a central tenet of Atticus Finch’s philosophy and of the novel in general, namely, that the road to dignity and justice may wind through empathy. If a person will pause, listen to others’ arguments, attempt to see matters from others’ points of view, strife and prejudice will be reduced, understanding enhanced. Another essay in the “Critical Contexts” section, one I think worthy of special notice, is “To Kill a Mockingbird as an Introduction to Faulkner.” Here Matthew Bolton pursues what at first seems to be a very arbitrary line of reasoning, that a fairly straightforward novel set in 1936 might serve as a gateway to the much more complex novel The Sound and the Fury, published thirty-one years earlier, in 1929. This is not an influence study, nor is S&F to be thought of as a prequel. Bolton demonstrates how most of the Deep South themes, character types, family dynamics, social, racial, class, and cultural issues of The Sound and the Fury are also taken up in a very accessible manner in Mockingbird and, if properly understood in that novel, can be better understood in Faulkner’s masterwork. In the essays which constitute the second half of this volume we About This Volume\n\nix\n\nhave two main groupings. One grouping might properly be considered close examinations of Atticus Finch, as man and lawyer. Christopher Metress sums up the new discussions of Finch. Atticus, while deemed heroic for thirty or so years, is now found by many to be complicit in the segregation/racism of Maycomb, Alabama. Atticus, as Metress points out, is faulted by many for failing to be a civil rights activist, for defending Tom out of noblesse oblige rather than pure, righteous passion, for failing to demand changes in the law from the state legislature. Metress asks, sensibly, where this line of reasoning will end. Tim Dare likewise summarizes the debate on Atticus’s claim to hero status but focuses on the issue of character-based ethics. He points out that Atticus is eloquent in his defense of legal procedures, as they apply fairly to everyone, but then “takes the law into his own hands,” in his agreeing, with Sheriff Tate, that Boo Radley should not be arrested and tried for the killing of Bob Ewell, even though it is a certainty Boo would be acquitted. Most readers admire Atticus’s character, to be sure, but procedures of law must be followed, in every case, to keep us from those situations where the person making the extra-legal decision does not possess a character we are confident would yield the right decision. No man’s heart is pure enough to trust to not circumvent the legal process. Ethics is also the subject of Thomas L. Shaffer’s “Growing Up Good in Maycomb.” Scout and Jem are “good” children and are taught the virtues, as expressed by their father, their neighbors, their aunt, and the community at large. More specifically, Scout must learn to one day be a white, Southern lady, and that is a complicated business indeed. Readers of Mockingbird usually find the scene in which peaceful, mild-mannered Atticus shoots the mad dog a memorable one. Carolyn Jones uses this emblematic scene to discuss Finch’s confrontations with the lynch mob and, to extend the metaphor further, the mad dog mentality that is racism. As the years passed and To Kill a Mockingbird achieved the status of x\n\nCritical Insights\n\nsomething like a sacred text, it is only natural that this would provoke reactions to it. Several essays discuss the flaws and inadequacies of this novel and lament that absence of what should have been in Mockingbird. Teresa Godwin Phelps takes on the question of social class and castes. As readers are told explicitly in the novel, there are people like us (the Finches) and folks like the Cunninghams. There are also the Ewells and the African Americans. To some degree all are marginalized except the people like “us.” Theodore R. Hovet and Grace-Ann Hovet also explore the question of class in Mockingbird. The narrative voice of this novel is “middleclass,” they argue, but finally readers become aware of the range of other voices, including Mayella’s, Calpurnia’s, and the adult female voice of Scout as the novel’s narrator. Diann L. Baecker writes of “The Importance of the Africanist Presence in To Kill a Mockingbird.” Not only is the African-American presence smaller than one would wish, but also readers and critics tend to give it too little attention, focusing instead on the gothic element provided by Boo Radley or the “white trash” issues raised by the Ewells. Dean Shackelford wishes to raise awareness of gender and the female voice in the novel and, to a lesser extent, the film. Scout’s narration of the novel is, of necessity, much diminished in the film, where it is an occasional voice-over. This is largely due to the greater percentage of the film taken up by the obviously dramatic trial of Tom Robinson. Laurie Champion, expanding a concept from Ralph Waldo Emerson, writes of the “Unconquered Eye” in Mockingbird. She demonstrates how someone with poor actual vision, like Atticus himself, sees moral and social issues pretty clearly indeed, and the eye of the child is more likely to see without bias and prejudice. Gary Richards, writing of what he calls “The Destabilization of Heterosexuality,” examines the domestic arrangements of Maycomb and finds almost no successfully married couples. This essay will provoke About This Volume\n\nxi\n\nconsiderable discussion, I imagine, on subjects like why Atticus never remarried, why his brother Jack never married at all, is Scout in “drag” wearing overalls under her dress, and to what extent Boo’s long years inside the Radley house might be considered “closeted.” He suggests that “without ever being fully conscious of the fact,” Lee presents Maycomb as “already distinctly queer.” To whatever degree any given reader is convinced by this or any other essay in this volume, one thing seems clear. The critical examination of Mockingbird has only just begun in earnest, and the ratio of sales to essays will be falling steadily in the coming years.\n\nxii\n\nCritical Insights\n\nTHE BOOK AND AUTHOR\n\nOn To Kill a Mockingbird Don Noble Although the novel To Kill a Mockingbird was published more than forty-eight years ago in far-off New York City, it is not a dead, historical document to citizens of Alabama, and the author, Nelle Harper Lee, is not a writer from the past, like Mark Twain or, now, Faulkner. Nelle Harper Lee lives today in Monroeville, Alabama, spends a good deal of her time with her older sister, the attorney Alice Lee, and can be seen, if one really needs to establish a sighting, eating lunch occasionally at a restaurant called Boo Radley’s. There seems to be a desire to classify Miss Lee in the same category as Thomas Pynchon, who has not in fact been seen or photographed for many years and gives no interviews, or J. D. Salinger, who is described as a recluse but in fact has friends and neighbors in to dinner when he pleases. She is closer to Salinger or to Cormac McCarthy, who lives a pretty regular life in a gated community in El Paso, Texas, with his wife and daughter but, like Salinger, refuses interviews, television shows, and reporters of all kinds. Miss Lee was supersaturated with journalists’ attention in the early sixties, becoming especially irritated when reporters persisted in asking where her next novel was. When she began refusing interviews, some reporters commenced making things up, and Miss Lee was then really finished. Because Miss Lee was seldom photographed, she was actually able to live in Manhattan, take buses and cabs and go to plays, movies, museums, and restaurants without attracting attention. In Monroeville, she is so revered that if a visitor should attempt to take her picture from across the street, a Monroeville native, if present, might ask him to refrain, out of courtesy to Miss Lee’s privacy. Monroeville, Alabama, is now, in many ways, to Miss Lee what Oxford, Mississippi, is to Faulkner—both hometown and cottage industry. Monroeville in fact has gone farther than Oxford, since it is arguably the “hometown” of Truman Capote; the novelist Mark Childress, On To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n3\n\nauthor of Crazy in Alabama, among other books; the Pulitzer Prizewinning editorial writer for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Cynthia Tucker; and a dozen other successful prose writers. Yes, one can actually buy Monroeville “Inspirational” bottled water, if water is what you believe does it. Monroeville has even been declared by the Alabama State Legislature to be, officially, the “Literary Capital of Alabama.” At the center of Monroeville is the courthouse square with the courthouse. Gregory Peck and the advance party came to Monroeville to scout the place out and the director, Robert Mulligan, decided, for ease in shooting and to control the lighting, to build an exact replica of the courtroom on a soundstage in Hollywood. Most moviegoers never knew the difference. Inside the courthouse are extensive exhibits of Mockingbird memorabilia and Capote memorabilia and a bookstore with many Monroeville titles. Every spring, in late April and early May, local amateurs perform a stage version of Mockingbird to sold-out houses. The play is in two acts. The first is performed on the lawn outside—the scenes with the rabid dog, Jem’s destruction of Mrs. Dubose’s flowers, and the scene in which Atticus, alone at night reading by a single bulb, is accosted by the would-be lynch mob that rolls up to the door in a vintage car, with rednecks clinging to the running board. With Scout’s unexpected help, he faces the gang down, and they retreat. The second act is performed in the courtroom itself, and the setting could not be more realistic and effective. In fact, before the performance each evening, twelve jurors are chosen as part of the cast. Every year, women volunteer to sit on the jury, on stage, and are surprised that they cannot be chosen. African Americans, of course, likewise. In fact, the jury of twelve white men, on which I have served more than once, is taken backstage and advised to play their parts correctly, believe Mayella if possible, and, most important, vote to convict. Some modern jurors are reluctant to convict, just as women are astounded they 4\n\nCritical Insights\n\ncannot serve. There can be no clearer signs of progress than a situation in which individuals can hardly believe that things really were the way they were. This production of Mockingbird has been presented for a number of years now and is so appealing it has been produced at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in Jerusalem, and in England. The Mockingbird play was also produced a couple of years ago by two high schools in the Birmingham, Alabama, area. This production was a collaboration between a very affluent, predominantly white suburban school, Mountain Brook High School, and the predominantly black Fairfield High Preparatory School, both in the Birmingham area. This production received a great deal of attention, including coverage on the evening national news, and is regarded as a triumph of interracial cooperation and goodwill. And it was. The cast had a most powerful experience and in many ways the audience did as well. What almost everyone declined to dwell upon, however, was the disturbing fact that there were no white students at Fairfield Prep and too few black students at Mountain Brook to cast the play using the students of only one school. Out-and-out racism and cruelty are hugely diminished, but the integration so sorely lacking in Maycomb, Alabama, in 1936 has not yet been achieved as we move toward the end of decade one in the twenty-first century. It is useful to remember, however, that To Kill A Mockingbird is a novel, a work of art, and was never meant to be a document of the kind written by, say, Upton Sinclair in The Jungle, the novel about the meatpacking industry that led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act. It is not and never was agitprop, meant to accomplish social or legal aims or legislation. The novel is not in fact about integration; it is about respect, decency, fair treatment under the law. It is a novel that intrinsically urges people to empathize with one another, be kind to one another, understand one another, think about things from someone else’s point of view, to, as Atticus famously says, try to get into someone else’s skin, to walk around in someone else’s shoes. On To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n5\n\nThere is a good deal of amazement at the enduring and global popularity of Mockingbird, but there need not be. To begin with, children— especially bright, attractive, nice little children—are always appealing, and Jem, Scout and tow-headed Dill are fetching youngsters. They are not saints but are mischievous enough to step over the line in tormenting Boo Radley and with emotion enough, in Jem’s case, to behead Mrs. Dubose’s camellias. Readers in forty languages have shared the delight of watching the phenomenon of maturation and understanding in these children as Jem moves to young manhood and Scout, albeit reluctantly, moves toward female adolescence. The novel’s appeal can also be attributed to what most people take as an accurate piece of social realism. Few commentators argue that Lee gets it wrong in her portrait of small-town Alabama in 1936. The argument most often proffered is that she leaves out slices of the society that surely existed. But this is not a rural novel of a cotton plantation, nor a novel about the Jewish dry goods store, nor a novel of African American or poor white life in Maycomb. This novel, the one Lee actually wrote, is about Atticus Finch, small-town lawyer and father of two, and the case he undertook on behalf of the wrongly accused Tom Robinson. Mockingbird is primarily about a white family of modest means but long established in the community where they will continue to live when the action is ended. One should also remember that Mockingbird is also a humorous novel that contains a certain amount of social satire. Aunt Alexandra and her kind, especially the Missionary Society, are supposed to be amusing to the reader. They offer a kind of comic relief. Most of all, the novel is about Atticus Finch himself, as seen mostly through the eyes of his daughter. Finch is a good man. Sometimes critics seem to demand that he be a saint, a real saint. But he is not. Atticus is an idealist, perhaps, but he is not a self-deluded dreamer. On the very last page of the novel, after Scout has escorted Boo Radley back to his house, she says to her dad, “Atticus, he was real nice. . . .” Atticus replies, “Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.” He does 6\n\nCritical Insights\n\nnot say everyone is. He does not suggest Bob Ewell is, deep down, nice and has been misunderstood. Right and wrong are pretty clear in this novel. A human being who is, by definition, flawed and a person of his time, Atticus goes as far in defending Tom as he possibly can within the constraints of local and contemporary law. As it is, he so publicly humiliates Bob Ewell that Ewell tries to murder his children. No, Atticus, a state representative, does not offer bills to the state legislature outlawing segregation. That would have been out of character, and Atticus would have had no better results than Galileo did arguing before the Pope. Segregation in 1936 Alabama had, in the minds of 99 percent of the white population, the same force as the law of gravity, inconceivable to repeal. It is true Atticus “takes the law into his own hands” in deciding Boo Radley should not be forced to stand trial, but Atticus knows children, and Boo is essentially a child and has become the mockingbird of the story. Most readers, over these intervening years, have not expected sainthood from Atticus and thus have not been miffed at his flaws. Most readers, in fact, understand the novel pretty well. Atticus is a decent man trying to do the right thing, and when we evaluate Atticus and his behavior in the privacy of our own hearts it might be good to remember what many mothers have told their children over the years. What if everyone did that? What if everyone behaved that way? Well, just imagine if everyone did behave like Atticus Finch in Alabama, or anywhere for that matter, in 1936. It would be a better world, I think.\n\nOn To Kill a Mockingbird\n\n7\n\nBiography of Harper Lee Edythe M. McGovern\n\nAchievements Based entirely on her first and only novel, Lee’s success has been phenomenal. According to a survey of reading habits conducted in 1991 by the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Library of Congress’s Center for the Book, researchers found that To Kill a Mockingbird was “most often cited as making a difference in people’s lives, second only to the Bible.” In 1961, To Kill a Mockingbird won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction, the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Alabama Library Association Award, and the British Book Society Award. By 1962 it had become a Literary Guild selection and a Book-of-the-Month-Club choice, it had won the Bestsellers’ Magazine Paperback of the Year award, and it was featured in the Reader’s Digest series of condensed books. In the same year Lee was given an honorary doctorate by Mount Holyoke College. She would receive another honorary doctorate in 1990 from the University of Alabama. Initially enjoying seventy-three weeks on the national bestseller lists, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into numerous languages. In 1962 it was made into a motion picture starring Gregory Peck, which won several Academy Awards. President Lyndon Johnson appointed Lee to the National Council on the Arts in 1966, on which she served for five years. In 1970 playwright Christopher Sergel published a stage version of Lee’s novel, Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird”: A Full-Length Play, with Dramatic Publications. The play was professionally performed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBiography The third daughter and youngest child of Amasa Coleman Lee, an attorney and newspaper publisher, and Frances Finch Lee, reportedly a 8\n\nCritical Insights\n\nsomewhat eccentric pianist, Nelle Harper Lee grew up in Monroeville, Alabama, attended public school there, then went to Huntingdon College for Women in Montgomery for a year before transferring to the University of Alabama in 1945. Lee edited the college humor magazine, the Rammer Jammer, and spent a summer term in a study-abroad program at Oxford University. In 1950, she entered law school, no doubt with the intention of following in her father’s footsteps. However, after one year she decided to abandon the study of law and go to New York City to pursue a career in writing. Throughout the early 1950s, Lee worked by day as a reservation clerk for Eastern Airlines and British Overseas Airways, living in a cramped flat with no hot water, and writing in her free time. During this period, she also made many trips to Monroeville to be with her ailing father, who died in 1962. Happily, Amasa Lee did live long enough to see To Kill a Mockingbird become a hugely successful book. In a short article published in McCall’s in December, 1961, called “Christmas to Me,” Lee recounted how she missed her home and family during this time, contrasting New York City with memories of Monroeville during the Christmas season. However, she had made some very close friends in her adopted home, and she spent Christmas with one of these families, who surprised her with a monetary gift. On the accompanying card were the words, “You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.” She was overwhelmed, but her benefactors felt that their faith in Lee’s ability was well founded. Lee used this time carefully: A methodical writer, she composed a few pages each day and revised them carefully, completing three short fictional sketches by 1957. After being advised that she must do more to transform this work into a novel, she continued to write for two and a half years until To Kill a Mockingbird went to press in 1960, dedicated to her father and to her older sister, Alice, a partner in the family law firm. Writer Truman Capote spent a great part of his childhood in MonBiography of Harper Lee\n\n9\n\nroeville, staying each summer with relatives whose house was in close proximity to the Lees’. The character of Charles Baker Harris, nicknamed Dill, in To Kill a Mockingbird is an accurate portrait of the young Capote, who remained in touch with Lee throughout his life. In the early 1960s, Lee went with Capote to Kansas to help him research In Cold Blood (1966), which chronicles the murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas; Capote dedicated the book to Lee and another lifelong friend, Jack Dunphy. Lee was invited to write the screenplay for the film version of To Kill a Mockingbird, but she declined. She was, however, very pleased with screenwriter Horton Foote’s script, about which she said, “If the integrity of a film adaptation is measured by the degree to which the novelist’s intent is preserved, Mr. Foote’s screenplay should be studied as a classic.” She was so delighted by Gregory Peck’s portrayal of Atticus Finch that she honored his performance and resemblance to her father by giving him Amasa Lee’s gold pocket watch, which was inscribed, “To Gregory from Harper, 1962.” Although To Kill a Mockingbird has sold more than fifteen million copies, Harper Lee never produced another book. As she told her cousin Richard Williams, when he questioned her about this, “When you have a hit like that, you can’t go anywhere but down.” Although known in her hometown as a friendly and jovial woman, Lee has consistently refused all attempts to interview her. In 1995, when HarperCollins released the thirty-fifth anniversary edition of To Kill a Mockingbird, Lee declined to write an introduction, stating, “The book still says what it has to say: it has managed to survive the years without preamble.” She now lives in Monroeville, Alabama.\n\nAnalysis To Kill a Mockingbird has gained stature over the years, becoming thought of as more than merely a skillful depiction of small-town Southern life during the 1930s with a coming-of-age theme. Claudia 10\n\nCritical Insights\n\nDurst Johnson, who has published two books of analysis on To Kill a Mockingbird, suggests that the novel is universally compelling because Lee’s overall theme of “threatening boundaries” covers a wide spectrum, from law to social standing, from childhood innocence to racism. The narrator of the book is Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, who is discussing childhood events with her adult brother, Jem, as the story begins. She then slips effortlessly into the role of the six-year-old tomboy who matures over the three years of the book’s action. In the first half of the novel, Scout and Jem, along with their childhood companion, Dill, are fascinated by their mysterious neighbor, Arthur (Boo) Radley. Because no one has seen Boo in many years, the youngsters construct a gothic stereotype of him, imagining him as huge and ugly, a monster who dines on raw squirrels, sports a jagged scar, and has rotten yellowing teeth and bulging eyes. They make plans to lure Boo from his “castle” (in reality the dark, shuttered Radley house), but in the course of their attempts to breach the boundaries of his life, they begin to discover the real Boo, an extremely shy man who has attempted to reach out to the children in a number of ways, and who, in the final chapters of the book, saves their lives. The second half of the book is principally concerned with the trial of Tom Robinson, a young African American unjustly accused of raping a white woman. Racial tensions in the neighborhood explode; Scout and Jem are shocked to find that not only their peers but also adults they have known their whole lives are harshly critical of their father, Atticus, who provides the legal defense for the innocent man. Throughout both sections of To Kill a Mockingbird Lee skillfully shows other divisions among people and how these barriers are threatened. Obviously, it is not a matter of race alone that sets societal patterns in this provincial Alabama town. For example, when Atticus’s sister, Alexandra, visits the family, she makes it clear that she is displeased by Scout’s tomboyish appearance, since she feels a future “Southern belle” should be interested in more ladylike clothing and Biography of Harper Lee\n\n11\n\nmore feminine behavior. Furthermore, as Jem tells Scout later, there is a strict caste system in Maycomb, with each group threatened by any possible abridgements of the social order. As Jem suggests, there are the “old” families—the gentry, who are usually educated, frequently professional, but, given the era, often cash-poor. On the next level down are the “poor but proud” people, such as the Cunninghams. They are country folk who pay their bills with crops and adamantly refuse all charity. Beneath them is the group commonly called “poor white trash,” amply represented by Bob Ewell, “the only man ever fired by the WPA for laziness,” and his pitiful daughter Mayella, the supposed victim of the rape. At the lowest rung of the social ladder are African Americans, although many are clearly superior to some of the poor white trash, who have only their skin color as their badge of superiority. They are represented by Tom Robinson, the accused rapist, and Calpurnia, the housekeeper for the motherless Finch family. In addition to the clearly defined social castes, there are deviants, such as Dolphus Raymond, a white man involved in a long relationship with a black woman. He pretends to be an alcoholic to “give himself an excuse with the community” for his lifestyle. There is Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, a member of the upper class who became a morphine addict and whose one desire is to overcome her habit before her death. Also featured is Miss Maudie, the friendly neighbor who seems to represent, along with Atticus, the best hope for change in the community. Lee uses many symbols in the book, none more pervasive than the mockingbird of the title. The bird is characterized as an innocent singer who lives only to give pleasure to others. Early in the novel, when Atticus gives Jem and Scout air rifles, he makes it clear that it would be a sin to harm a mockingbird, a theme reiterated by Miss Maudie. Two of the main characters are subtly equated with the birds: Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, both innocents “caged for crimes they never committed.” Atticus himself is a symbol of conscience. Unlike his sister, he is a nonconformist, an atypical Southerner, a thoughtful, bookish man at odds with his environment. He constantly tells his children that they 12\n\nCritical Insights\n\ncan understand other people only by walking in their shoes. He is mindful of the majority opinion but asserts, “The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.” Sometimes, of course, violent action is necessary to alter boundaries. This is foreshadowed early in the novel when Atticus finds it necessary to shoot a rabid dog. However, later, when he faces the mob from Old Sarum that is intent on lynching Tom Robinson, he simply sits in front of the jail, ostensibly reading a newspaper. Atticus seems very calm, upset only by the appearance of the children and Jem’s refusal to take Dill and Scout home, not by the men who threaten violence. After Scout recognizes Mr. Cunningham and mentions Walter, his son, as her school friend, the group leaves. Braxton Underwood, owner of the Maycomb Tribune, leans out of his window above the office holding a double-barreled shotgun, saying, “I had you covered all the time, Atticus,” suggesting that there may well be occasions in which force is appropriate. Tried before a jury of white men, in an echo of the 1931 Scottsboro Nine case, which convicted nine innocent black men of raping two white women, Tom Robinson is found guilty in spite of proof that he could not have committed the crime. Yet even here there is a bit of hope for change to come, because the jury does not reach a quick decision, deliberating for three hours in a case involving the strongest taboo in the South, a black man sexually molesting a white woman. Tom, however, does not believe that Atticus’s legal appeals will save him, and again violence erupts when he is shot and killed while trying to escape from the prison exercise yard. Although Lee set her novel in a very isolated locale, which she calls Maycomb, in an era when her notion of crossing racial and social boundaries did not always seem imminently attainable, the world of 1960, when To Kill a Mockingbird appeared, was radically different. The Civil Rights movement had begun; the United States Supreme Court had ruled against school segregation in the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision; and there had been a successful bus boycott in Biography of Harper Lee\n\n13\n\nMontgomery, Alabama, in 1955-1956, which brought activist Martin Luther King, Jr., to public attention. Finally, people who believed in the importance of applying the law fairly (as Atticus Finch did) were being heard. There was some criticism of the melodramatic ending of the novel, in which Bob Ewell attacks the Finch children, who are in costume returning from a school Halloween pageant. Jem’s arm is broken in the scuffle, and Scout is saved from the attacker by Boo Radley, who kills Ewell with his own knife. However, in addition to providing closure for the plot, Lee uses this ending to confirm her view of Atticus and his moral character. At first, when Sheriff Heck Tate comes to the Finch home to learn the details of the evening’s happenings, Atticus mistakenly assumes that Jem has killed Bob while defending Scout. Heck tries to reassure Atticus, saying, “Bob Ewell fell on his knife. He killed himself.” Atticus believes that the sheriff is suggesting a cover-up for Jem, which he refuses, saying, “I can’t live one way in town and another way in my home.” Finally he realizes that it was Boo Radley who had stabbed Bob with a kitchen knife, not Jem. Atticus then agrees out of kindness to the reclusive Boo to go along with the sheriff’s version of the death. When he tells Scout that Mr. Tate was right, she says, “Well, it’d be sort of like shootin’ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?” Most literary critics have written of To Kill a Mockingbird in glowing terms. One critic has suggested that Atticus is the symbol of the future, of the “new” South that will arise when it takes into account all human experience, discarding the old romantic notions of an isolated regionalism in favor of a wider Emersonian view of the world.

This biography tells of the events that led to Lee’s writing of To Kill a Mockingbird, as well as her decision to shun the spotlight that shone on her after its publication.\n\nBiography of Harper Lee\n\n15\n\nThe Paris Review Perspective Sasha Weiss for The Paris Review Mention To Kill a Mockingbird to almost anyone who grew up in the United States after 1960, and he or she will smile discreetly, seeming to recall an old pleasure. As with most events that imprint us as children, people often remember where they were when they first encountered this novel. Scout Finch, the boisterous, sly narrator; Jem Finch, her sometimes imperious, sometimes heroic older brother; the impish Dill Harris; the shut-in Boo Radley; Atticus Finch, their gentleman father; and the town of Maycomb, Alabama, itself, drawling, cozy, and sinister: these figures have drawn around them a fellowship of readers. When Nelle Harper Lee submitted the manuscript for To Kill a Mockingbird to publishers, she was told to keep her expectations low. Lee was almost preternaturally shy, known more as Truman Capote’s sidekick (Capote was a childhood friend and a possible model for Dill Harris) than for her writing. But the book quickly became a best seller and has sold over thirty million copies since it first appeared. Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, but the novel marked the beginning of her withdrawal from public life. After a few years, she returned to her hometown in Alabama and never published another book. To Kill a Mockingbird is all we have from Harper Lee; thank goodness it’s more than enough. The novel opens the way that it closes: with Jem’s broken arm—the violent end to a series of events that roil the town of Maycomb and push the Finch children into uneasy adulthood. Scout, nine years old, has a fresh and quick eye, unencumbered by convention. The hab16\n\nCritical Insights\n\nits and manners of the adult world are mysterious to her, and in simply recounting the conversations of the bigoted adults around her, their foolishness is exposed. At the same time, her life is relatively sheltered: When I was six and Jem was ten, our summertime boundaries . . . were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose’s house two doors to the north of us, and the Radley place three doors to the south. We were never tempted to break them.\n\nHome is a neatly protected place, a place from which Scout has no desire to stray. But by the end of the novel, after Scout has watched the jury disgrace itself at Tom Robinson’s trial, her sense of home is reconfigured. She has become a subversive, infiltrating backyards and black churches with a shambolic glee. Her world, which until now had been broken up into component parts that fit together, becomes a blended abstraction: she sees that “A steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning.” The seasons themselves have become intermingled; the most basic of boundaries have dissolved. During the years that Lee was writing, two events catalyzed the rapid rise of the Civil Rights movement: Emmett Till, a fourteen-yearold black boy accused of a crime similar to Tom’s, was brutally killed in Mississippi; and Rosa Parks refused to cede her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Alabama. Harper Lee’s achievement was to capture— with infinite gentleness, as a child might trap a lightning bug—that moment in American life when the familiar world had become unrecognizably strange, when the discrepancy between vaunted ideals and base reality was exposed. When we read To Kill a Mockingbird, we are asked again to take the measure of where we are—and where we might yet go. Speaking of William Faulkner in a 1964 interview, Lee pinpoints his greatness in his “vision of enlargement, of using the novel to encompass something much broader.” It is a capacity for expansiveness that she admired, and that she shared.

So readers might question the origins of this novel. If they want “to take a broad view of the thing,” as Scout suggests, readers might trace Harper Lee’s writing back to some storytelling gene in the Lee and Finch families. Regardless of that genetic heritage, readers can agree that the lives of the two Finch children and their friend Dill began in the small-town life of Monroeville, Alabama, a life experienced by the novel’s author. Born on April 28, 1926, Nelle Harper Lee is the youngest child of Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch Lee, with two sisters, Alice and Louise, and a brother, Edward. During the hardships of the Depression, the young Nelle attended school and played with her friends and siblings under the watchful eyes of family and neighbors in the small community. Even in the early years of her schooling, Nelle Lee was interested in writing, and she worked on her skills in high school and college. After graduation from high school in Monroeville in 1944, Lee attended Huntingdon College (Montgomery, Alabama) during 19441945. English and history professors at the college acknowledged and encouraged her writing abilities and fondly recalled her presence in their classes. Margaret Gillis Figh, a Huntingdon English professor who stayed in touch with her former student, saved some of Lee’s early papers as well as copies of a caricature Lee drew after she transferred to the University of Alabama, which she attended from 1945 to 1949. There she continued to write, editing the Rammer Jammer, the university’s humor magazine, and writing features and columns for university publications. She was pursuing a law degree to follow in the profession of her father and her older sister, Alice, but never completed law school. After a summer in Oxford, England, she moved to New York City in 1949. To Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n21\n\nThe story of Lee’s life in New York as an airline reservation clerk, among other jobs, and her struggles to begin her writing career is best told in her essay “Christmas to Me.” After the day at work, Lee returned to her cold-water flat to write the short stories that enabled her to attract an agent. As she writes in “Christmas to Me,” in December, 1956, she received a generous gift from friends Michael and Joy Williams Brown: money that would to allow her to write full time. The note accompanying the gift read: “You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas” (63). Working with Tay Hohoff, an editor at J. B. Lippincott, Lee turned her short stories into the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, completing it in the summer of 1959. The published novel was released on July 11, 1960, marking the beginning of a “summer storm,” a phrase used to describe the immediate success of the novel. No one seemed to expect the initial reactions to Lee’s first novel, least of all the author herself. In an interview with Roy Newquist on Counterpoint (for WQXR in New York in March of 1964), she said, “I sort of hoped that maybe someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little.” Certainly she received the “public encouragement,” with more than two million copies sold in the first year and more than five million in the first two years. To Kill a Mockingbird spent one hundred weeks on best-seller lists and was chosen by Book-of-the-Club, Literary Guild, and Reader’s Digest Condensed Books. One British book club also made it a selection. Translations have been numerous, perhaps into more than forty different languages: Hebrew, Chinese (at least two editions), Magyar, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, French, and dozens of others. The dust jackets of these translations are also fascinating studies in cultures, from the German stylized silhouette of leaves and an orangebrown bird on a tree limb to one Chinese edition featuring a young Victorian woman reading a book on the cover or a scene of Scout and Atticus reading together in a scene from the movie on a Hebrew paperback edition. 22\n\nCritical Insights\n\nIn 1961 the first literary prizes were announced. In April Harper Lee received the Alabama Library Association’s literary award, followed in May by the announcement that To Kill a Mockingbird was receiving the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It also received the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1961 and the Bestsellers Paperback of the Year Award in 1962. Through the years, Lee has continued to receive recognition, honorary degrees, and awards, including the 2002 Alabama Humanities Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007. Sales figures for the novel attracted interest from Hollywood. Rights ultimately were sold to Alan Pakula and Robert Mulligan, who became partners to produce the film that Mulligan directed. Gregory Peck was cast to play Atticus Finch, after consideration of a number of actors including Rock Hudson. Horton Foote adapted the script, which condensed the three years of the novel into one summer and fall in the movie. After its release on December 25, 1962, the movie was nominated for eight Academy Awards: best picture, best director, best actor, best screenplay adaptation, best cinematography, best musical score, best art direction/set design in black and white, and best supporting actress. Peck won for best actor, Foote won for best screenplay adaptation, and the movie won for best black and white art direction/set design. Just as the novel has had an ongoing success, so the movie has continued to draw a following and critical praise. A review of the movie in 2002 describes the movie as “a faithful adaptation of one of the 20th century’s most important American works of literature” that resulted in “An astonishing motion picture by any standards” (Berardinelli). The success of To Kill a Mockingbird has, in no way, been restricted to the decade of the 1960s. By 1977 the novel had sold twelve million copies, and by the late 1990s about thirty million. It continues to sell about one million copies a year worldwide. According to the author’s sister Alice Lee, sales are even stronger outside the United States than within the fifty states. It has never been out of print. It appeared on sevTo Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n23\n\neral of the lists of 100 best books published at the end of the twentieth century, including the one from the New York Public Library. The American Library Association named it the best book of the twentieth century. In a 1991 survey conducted by the Library of Congress, it was second only to the Bible as the book that had made the most difference in individuals’ lives. It has been chosen more than any other book for One Book One Community reading programs. Harper Lee even wrote a blurb for One Book, One Chicago: When the people of Chicago assemble in various parts of the city to read and discuss To Kill a Mockingbird, there is no greater honor the novel could receive. People of all backgrounds and cultures coming together to put their critical skills to work? Nothing could be more exciting! Or fruitful: when people speak their minds and bring to discussion their own varieties of experience, when they receive respect for their opinions and the good will of their fellows, things change. It is as if life itself takes on a new compelling clarity, and good things get done.\n\nNow, in the twenty-first century, To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the novels featured in The Big Read, a community reading initiative sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts. This program has moved the One Book One Community idea to a national level, with communities—large and small—all over the country reading this novel, or one of the others featured, and then meeting to discuss it and its historical, cultural, and thematic implications. NEA has produced numerous supplemental materials to support the program—reading guides, booklets, bookmarks, DVDs, discussion guides, and program formats. Such an initiative is aimed at readers of all ages and backgrounds. Rare book prices may or may not be indications of success, but a full-page advertisement from Bauman Rare Books in The New York Times Book Review of November 6, 2005, contains a listing for To Kill a Mockingbird:\n\n24\n\nCritical Insights\n\nHarper Lee To Kill a Mockingbird 1960. Rare first edition of the Pulitzer-winning classic, in lovely bright original dust jacket, inscribed by Harper Lee. $33,000.\n\nIn the April 30, 2006, issue of the NYTBR, the same company advertised a signed copy of the “1999 anniversary edition” for $950. With such a consistently strong following, the novel has become a standard reading assignment in classrooms all over the world, certainly accounting for some of the ongoing sales. Teachers at all levels—K-12 and undergraduate and graduate classes—have found the novel very accessible for storytelling and for study of literature, history, cultures, values, and themes such as race, coming of age, and gender. Depending on the survey, the percentages of public, private, and parochial schools teaching the novel range from 60 to 75 percent in the United States. This classroom use has resulted in a publication phenomenon all its own: at least sixteen versions of “notes,” the shortcuts to reading the novel such as Cliff’s Notes, Barron’s Outline Series, Passnotes, and Monarch’s. In addition, numerous teachers’ guides have been published—more than thirty-five listed on Amazon.com on one day, including one for teaching the book to children ages 4-8. Dramatic adaptations also appear with some frequency. One of the best known is the production in Harper Lee’s hometown of Monroeville, performed on weekends each April and May. The performances take place in the courthouse square with act one outside on a set of the house fronts and act two inside the Monroe County Court House. The actors are members of the community. This production has also gone to Jerusalem, England, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Since the jury is chosen from men in the audience during the intermissions, the foreign performances have resulted in some unusual situations when the members of the jury, not familiar with the original story, To Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n25\n\nhave to be convinced to read the line announcing the guilt of Tom Robinson, the defendant. Another Alabama production of the play that has received widespread attention is the unique collaboration of two high schools in Birmingham. Mountain Brook High School, a predominantly white school in the affluent suburb of Birmingham, joined the all-black Fairfield High Preparatory School to produce the play in October of 2006. The production attracted the attention of the NBC Today Show and NBC Nightly News as well as the attention of Harper Lee, who met with the cast and attended a performance held in Montgomery hosted by Alabama Governor Bob Riley. Productions of the stage adaptation are not limited by geography or time. From the mid-1990s through 2008 the play has been staged at professional theaters throughout the country, in Washington State, Kansas, Missouri, California, Kentucky, New York, Montana, and Alabama, among other locations. The initial success of To Kill a Mockingbird attracted considerable media attention for the novel and its unassuming southern author and for the movie. In addition to the numerous reviews of the book and the movie in newspapers on the East and West coasts and in national magazines, the novel and its author were the subjects of newspaper articles and features across the country. Harper Lee was a popular subject for interviews, appearing in such diverse media as on Counterpoint with Roy Newquist and in Rogue, in which Bob Ellison published his account of “the flood of questions the noted writer must endure all in the name of publicity.” Not surprisingly, given the sales records of the novel, the interest in the novel and its author has persisted through the decades. A survey of The New York Times reveals its ongoing coverage, beginning with the early reviews and articles and continuing through the latter part of the century and into the twenty-first century. Similar patterns appear in newspapers in Atlanta; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and predictably in Birmingham, Mobile, and Montgomery, Alabama. Periodically through 26\n\nCritical Insights\n\nthe 1980s and into the twentieth-first century, newspaper features have continued to appear throughout the country, often reporters’ accounts of their visits to Monroeville, Alabama, or their brief encounters with the elusive author or their totally failed attempts to meet her and interview her. As might be expected, Harper Lee soon tired of the demands of public life and became reluctant to give interviews. She agreed to what she called a “visit” with Don Keith in 1966, a session during which the interviewer uses the word “recluse” in connection with Harper Lee’s name. As biographer Charles Shields acknowledges, it was a negative statement: “Harper Lee is no recluse” (Shields, 248). Over the years, however, the word has begun to be used to describe the author, reversing the original statement. Since she continues to appear in public to speak, to attend special programs, to eat out with friends, and to accept awards, the label is inappropriate. For example, one special event that she attends most years is to meet with the young writers of the Harper Lee essay competition at the University of Alabama, and newspapers like The New York Times publish a story about this meeting, accompanied by a photograph. “Discriminating” is a more accurate description than “reclusive.” Media attention has persisted into the twenty-first century. Boston filmmaker Sandy Jaffe, who grew up in Birmingham, produced a onehour documentary entitled Our Mockingbird, in 2009. The film includes interviews with academics, lawyers, teachers, and actors who have performed in professional productions of the staged versions, coverage of the collaborative production by the Birmingham high schools, and footage of sites around Alabama central to the story of Scout and Jem. With the popularity of the novel and the movie continuing to grow, the legal world turned to the novel for careful study of its portrayal of that field. Many lawyers practicing today confess that they became interested in pursuing legal careers after reading the story of Atticus Finch. Over the years law reviews have published articles analyzing To Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n27\n\nthe stand taken by this southern lawyer in the 1930s, with interpretations changing as the times change. In her bibliography of secondary sources in her groundbreaking work, To Kill a Mockingbird: Threatening Boundaries, Claudia Durst Johnson lists legal articles published in journals of law schools in New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Mercer (Georgia), and Los Angeles and articles with legal subjects published in the American Bar Association Journal, Legal Times, and The New York Times. Earlier articles have portrayed him as a strong man of principle standing against the beliefs and practices of his time. Later, in more politically correct times, some analyses have portrayed him as paternalistic and weak and even condescending in the stands that he takes. Two titles and their publication dates illustrate this diversity of interpretation: Claudia A. Carver’s 1988 “Lawyers as Heroes: The Compassionate Activism of a Fictional Attorney Is a Model We Can Emulate” and David Margolick’s “Chipping at Atticus Finch’s Pedestal,” in 1992. Even with the popular readership, the success of the movie, the extensive use of To Kill a Mockingbird in classrooms around the world, and some legal analyses, the academic world has been slower to give the novel careful and thorough critical attention. Among the earliest works of critical analysis was Fred Erisman’s “The Romantic Regionalism of Harper Lee” in the 1973 Alabama Review, followed closely by R. A. Dave’s essay in Indian Studies in American Fiction in 1974. William T. Going’s “Store and Mockingbird: Two Pulitzer Novels about Alabama” appeared in Essays on Alabama Literature in 1975. Through the 1980s and early 1990s, literary criticism appeared sporadically in academic journals. Johnson’s book devoted to the novel published in the Twayne series in 1994 has provided a foundation—and perhaps a stimulus—for additional critical analyses in academia. In its Literary Companion to American Literature, Greenhaven Press published Readings on “To Kill a Mockingbird” in 2000, edited by Terry O’Neill. The four sections of reprinted articles consider “The Critical Reception,” “Literary Techniques . . . ,” “Social Issues . . . ,” 28\n\nCritical Insights\n\nand “The Character of Atticus Finch.” In 2007 the University of Tennessee Press published a collection edited by Alice Hall Petry. Though it could be more aptly entitled “On To Kill a Mockingbird” than On Harper Lee, it is a collection of eleven original essays, three of which are “personal reflections” by creative writers Doris Betts, Gerald Early, and Nichell D. Tramble, in addition to the Foreword by William T. Going, one of the early scholars to write about To Kill a Mockingbird. The critical studies in Petry’s collection consider religion, Gothicism, southern code, humor, and race among other subjects. Bibliographies in books devoted to studies of the novel are beginning to show more recent dates of publications, so perhaps academic attention is growing. In 2006, Charles J. Shields’s unauthorized biography of Harper Lee was released by Henry Holt—Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee. Shields did an impressive amount of research including hundreds of interviews and exchanges of letters with individuals who had known Lee, especially in schools in Monroeville, Montgomery, or Tuscaloosa. The result is a compilation of important verifiable and documented information about Lee and some puzzling, even annoying, commentary about Lee’s looks, clothing, and sexual orientation. Two years later Henry Holt also released Shields’s adaptation of the biography for younger readers: I Am Scout: The Biography of Harper Lee. Another biography of Lee for young readers ages 9 to 12 is youngadult author Kerry Madden’s Harper Lee: A Twentieth-Century Life; published in 2009 as part of the Up Close series, it is also a heavily researched study. Despite the continuing popularity of the novel, the popular and critical success of the movie, and attention—however slight—in legal and academic publications, myths swirl around the novel and its author. There could be a number of explanations for these myths, rumors, errors: Harper Lee has been out of the limelight for more than forty years; no second novel followed the successful To Kill a Mockingbird; the lack of extensive attention in academic and legal journals has left a void for the myths to fill. To Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n29\n\nOne myth—“error” would be a more accurate label—is in a reference book and provides an excellent example of how myths start. Lee dedicated her novel to her father and sister: Dedication: for Mr. Lee and Alice in consideration of Love & Affection\n\nTuttle Dictionary of Dedications, however, prints this version: For Mr. Lee and Slice in consideration of Love & Affection\n\nNot satisfied with the typographical error, the editor added an explanatory note: “The American author’s first and award winning novel presumably dedicated to her husband and child, the latter called by a nickname.” Less amusing—and probably more disturbing, at least to the author—is the myth that Harper Lee is dead. She has responded to this one herself in her objection to writing an introduction to the thirty-fifth anniversary edition of the novel: Please spare Mockingbird an introduction. As a reader I loathe Introductions. To novels, I associate Introductions with long-gone authors and works that are being brought back into print after decades of internment. Although Mockingbird will be 33 this year, it has never been out of print and I am still alive, although very quiet. Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive without preamble. Harper Lee, 12 February 1993 30\n\nCritical Insights\n\nThis “introduction” was printed as the foreword to both the thirty-fifth and fortieth anniversary editions. Another error that has become part of the mythology is that this novel is the only thing Harper Lee ever published—or even ever wrote. Any complete bibliography of primary sources will refute that error. She has published five magazine articles since the novel was released, not counting the earlier works published during college days. In addition to the “introduction” to the anniversary editions and the blurb for One Book, One Chicago, there are a number of short selections published in a variety of sources. One delightful example of Lee’s wry wit comes as a result of a banning of Mockingbird by the Hanover (Virginia) County Board of Education for immoral subject matter. After publishing a flurry of letters praising the school board and condemning “the controversial book” and the “diabolical movie,” the Richmond News-Leader printed this letter on January 15, 1966: Editor, News-Leader: Recently I have received echoes down this way of the Hanover County School Board’s activities, and what I’ve heard makes me wonder if any of its members can read. Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that “To Kill a Mockingbird” spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners. To hear that the novel is “immoral” has made me count the years between now and 1984, for I have yet to come across a better example of doublethink. I feel, however that the problem is one of illiteracy, not Marxism. Therefore I enclose a small contribution to the Beadle Bumble [Charles Dickens’ character responsible for the orphanage and workhouse in Oliver Twist] Fund that I hope will be used to enroll the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice. Harper Lee Monroeville, Ala.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n31\n\nThe editor of the newspaper added the following italicized comment: In most controversies, the lady is expected to have the last word. In this particular discussion, it seems especially fitting that the last word should come from the lady who wrote “To Kill a Mockingbird.” With Miss Lee’s letter, we call a halt, at least temporarily, to the publication of letters commenting on the book-banning in Hanover County. Editor\n\nProbably the most persistent myth is that Harper Lee did not write the novel attributed to her. The name that usually fills that void is Truman Capote. With so many ways to refute that claim, the fact that it continues to surface is the puzzle. We have the writings of Harper Lee’s editor, Tay Hohoff—“We Get a New Author” and “About the Author”—telling of her work with the author. We have Lee’s account in “Christmas to Me.” We have Capote’s own testimony about his friend’s novel in a July 9, 1959, letter to an aunt: “she [Nelle] showed me as much of the book as she’d written and I liked it very much. She has real talent” (qtd. in Marshall 1A). And, if readers could ignore these facts, can they really believe that Capote’s personality would have allowed him to remain silent in the face of the success of his friend’s novel and the movie based on it, remarkable success that continued to elude him? Does a comparison of the styles of the two authors allow serious consideration of his authorship? Indeed, a much stronger case exists for Lee’s coauthorship of Capote’s In Cold Blood. After all, there are hundreds of pages of notes that she took while working with Capote in Kansas, when they were researching material for his nonfiction novel. These notes are now with Capote’s papers in the New York Public Library. Occasionally other candidates are suggested for authorship, but these myths cannot persist after careful scrutiny of the facts. With the sales figures of the novel and its presence in classrooms, it would be easy to believe that acceptance of the novel has been universally positive throughout its history. A survey of reviews at the time of 32\n\nCritical Insights\n\nthe novel’s release easily contradicts that myth. Titles at the time included phrases like “good but flawed novel,” “TKAM lacks realistic characters,” and “questionable portrayals of women.” Some reviewers attacked the novel for a flawed point of view, arguing that the insights are too mature for a child narrator. These reviewers had obviously overlooked wording like “When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them . . . ,” which appears in the second paragraph of the novel. As the story unfolds, Lee reminds readers with phrases like “a tired old town when I first knew it” or “not until many years later” that the older Jean Louise is recalling her childhood with insights gained as she matured. One dramatic production reminds audiences of this double point of view with the constant presence of the older Jean Louise on stage, overseeing the actions of the children. The movie uses a voice-over to provide the same reminder. Some of the reviewers argued that the two plots—the children’s efforts to draw Boo Radley out of the house and Tom Robinson’s trial— are never integrated. Such a conclusion ignores the climactic scene where Bob Ewell tries to avenge his embarrassment in the courtroom by attacking Atticus’s children, only to have Boo come out to save the children he has watched over through their childhood. Other early reviews claim that the novel is bound by time and place and cannot possibly endure or move beyond its small geographical setting. The continuing worldwide readership of the novel and the praise for the blackand-white movie clearly contradict these theories. Weak characterization is the focus of some reviews—stereotypical characters who are all good or evil. Even Atticus is attacked as being too nearly perfect. Careful readings, however, reveal Lee’s subtlety in creating her characters. Mayella plants flowers to bring beauty to her house near the junkyard. Atticus admits that he wishes he did not have to take this case and ultimately compromises his commitment to truth by accepting the sheriff’s plan to protect Boo from public scrutiny. Lee’s complexity and subtlety of characterization are particular strengths of the novel. To Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n33\n\nThe classification of To Kill a Mockingbird as simply autobiography denies Lee’s creativity. Certainly the story and its setting grow directly out of Lee’s home and her childhood, and there are obvious autobiographical details: her father was a lawyer, Finch was her mother’s maiden name, Maycomb is a small town similar to Monroeville, Dill is based on Truman Capote and his visits to Monroeville (a claim he made with some frequency), and the list can go on. In the interview printed in Rogue, Lee wryly answers the question about whether characters are based on real people: “No, but the people at home think so. The beauty of it, though, is that no two people come up with the same identification. They never think of themselves as being portrayed in the book. They try to identify others whom they know as characters” (Ellison, 24). After all, the artistry and creativity come from the ways in which things develop, the details invented to bring the children and their stories to life, and the sensitive observations about people, races, education, life in a small town with the complex classes of people that inhabit it, and the portrayals of human nature. A 1962 Gadsden (Alabama) newspaper article quoted Harper Lee’s view of the novel: “It portrays an aspect of civilization—not necessarily Southern civilization. I tried to show the conflict of the human soul—reduced to its simplest terms” (qtd. in Petry xxi). Some critics want to argue that the novel’s popularity exists because it is such a “sweet,” “feel-good” novel where everything ends happily. Another reviewer claims that it is “pleasant, undemanding reading” (Adams, 98-99). Certainly there are some emotionally satisfying qualities, but to draw such simple conclusions is to overlook the darker elements of the novel: dysfunctional, even abusive families (Ewells, Radleys, and even Dill’s neglectful parents); conviction and eventual death of an innocent man; brutal attack on two children to get even with their father; a lynch mob; bigotry, racism, hypocrisy; and the list can continue. Does the novel really end happily? Tom is dead, Jem’s arm is seriously damaged, Boo has killed a man, the two children are traumatized by a vicious attack, and Atticus has compromised his commit34\n\nCritical Insights\n\nment to truth—and perhaps violated the law—by becoming part of the cover-up to protect Boo. The most persistent myth will be proved—or disproved—only in time: the possibility, or probability, of a second novel by Harper Lee. There is strong evidence from reliable sources that Harper Lee lived in Alexander City, Alabama, for at least six months researching the case of the Reverend Maxwell, the alleged murderer of several people close to him; Rev. Maxwell was the beneficiary of their life insurance policies. He was never found guilty of any wrongdoing in any trial. However, at the funeral of one of his supposed victims, a member of the family stood up and shot Rev. Maxwell in front of the hundreds of people attending the funeral. The shooter was found not guilty, despite the many witnesses. According to some sources, Lee, using the skills she developed while working with Capote in Kansas as he wrote his nonfiction novel, In Cold Blood, researched the Maxwell case with the intent of developing it into her own nonfiction novel, theoretically entitled “The Reverend.” One member of her family has been quoted as saying she has read it and believes that it is better than Lee’s first novel. The myth continues with the detail that the novel will be posthumously published because To Kill a Mockingbird consumed Lee’s life—and the lives of her family—and she does not intend for that to happen again. And so anticipation continues to build. Whatever the myths, rumors, and critical views that come and go as new audiences come to the novel and to the movie, To Kill a Mockingbird endures as a work of art that has made significant differences in peoples’ lives around the world. It tells the stories of engaging characters, especially the narrator, and effectively incorporates lessons about right and wrong, tolerance, and courage without heavy-handed didacticism or moralizing or preaching. Harper Lee has on a number of occasions described the novel as a “love story pure and simple”—embodying a love of the South, a love of small towns, a father’s love for his children, and the children’s love for their father. Alabama historian Wayne Flynt, who has spoken about Harper Lee To Kill a Mockingbird: Successes and Myths\n\n35\n\nand her novel throughout the United States and abroad, sums up the power of novel in one sentence: “TKAM is the single most unifying literary experience in American education and probably the most important single source of American values derived solely from literature” (Flynt email).\n\nSelected Bibliography Primary Sources “Christmas To Me.” McCall’s (December, 1961): 63. “Dear Oprah . . .

It has never been out of print, it has been translated into several languages, and it has become a part of literary curricula around the world. Moreover, it continues to figure prominently in literature surveys and polls. In 1999, for instance, it was voted the best novel of the twentieth century by the readers of the Library Journal. Even more recently, it came in at number one in a survey conducted online to find the fifty best novels of all time.1 Furthermore, Lee has received numerous honors since her novel was first published, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and culminating in the highly prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom in November, 2007. It is entirely in keeping with this that the 1962 film adaptation of the same name has become almost as famous as the original novel, garnering a string of Oscars including Best Actor for Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch.2 Yet, for all this, the novel itself has not been the object of much literary criticism and analysis over the years, as Claudia Johnson, among others, has remarked (Boundaries, 20). Johnson made this observation in the early nineties, but the number of literary studies concerning this novel has not increased markedly since then. Similarly, there are few full-length biographies of Harper Lee. Of course there is an obvious reason for this; like J. D. Salinger, author of another celebrated twentieth century American novel, The Catcher in the Rye, Lee is thought of as being reclusive. Even more intriguingly, and unlike Salinger, she has produced virtually no other literature of any note. However, the impact of her one novel has never been in doubt, as Johnson recognizes. “To Kill a Mockingbird is unquestionably one of the most widely read, best-selling, and influential books in American literature. It has made a significant difference in the lives of individuals and in the culture as a 38\n\nCritical Insights\n\nwhole” (Casebook, 9). Johnson goes on to note that the novel came in second only to the Bible in one readers’ list of books that were felt to contribute most significantly to individual people’s lives (Casebook, 9). Mockingbird is one of those relatively rare single works of literature that can truly be said to have attained a mythical status; it is ultimately lauded less for its brilliance in terms of literary art than for the way in which it seems to impress people on a deeply human level. Of course in the simplest sense it is an appealing tale of the fight against injustice, a play on the age-old theme of good versus evil. Although the book is seen to have such a universal and lasting appeal, it does of course have a special historical significance. Lee’s native state of Alabama, where the story is set, provided one of the flashpoints for the burgeoning American Civil Rights movement of the 1950s, with such momentous events as the Montgomery bus boycott which began in 1955, five years before the book’s publication. Given its overriding theme of racial oppression in the South, Lee’s novel, not unlike Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin in the previous century, has taken on strong political dimensions. This, in turn, has led to the common but misleading association between Lee and the Civil Rights struggle—despite the fact that she took no actual part in it (Boundaries, xi-xiv). Of course, she drew on the current climate of racial tension and unrest for her material, as well as incorporating her own memories of growing up in Monroeville during the thirties. It has been suggested that Tom Robinson’s plight was inspired by the reallife, protracted case of the Scottsboro Boys, who in 1931 were falsely accused of rape by two white women (Boundaries, 7-11). Patrick Chura has also closely examined the highly emotive case of Emmett Till, who was brutally murdered by a gang in Mississippi for flirting with a white woman. In addition, Charles Shields recounts in his biography of Lee how Lee’s own father, an attorney, unsuccessfully defended two black men in 1919 and thereafter never tried another criminal case (120-121). It might be said that the book takes much of its potency from the way in which it fuses together autobiographical eleMockingbird in Context\n\n39\n\nments with high-profile cases of injustice and brutality which were continuing to fuel racial tensions at the time of its publication. Certainly there was something opportune about its timing. As Fred Erisman’s analysis makes clear, this work, with its portrayal of smalltown Southern life and its host of quirky characters, can be viewed as being primarily a “regional” novel, something in the so-called “Southern Gothic” tradition.3 It might be characterized therefore as a regional novel that, by reason of its temporal and geographical proximity to the Civil Rights movement, became elevated to a position of national importance. As already remarked, however, its influence continues to be felt many years later and in different countries; it has transcended its original contexts. For all its fame, however, To Kill a Mockingbird has not had a unanimously favorable reception. For one thing, as Johnson has discussed at length, it has frequently fallen afoul of the censors for such reasons as its use of slang, reference to sexual activity, and “expression of antiestablishment attitudes” (Casebook, 197). In fact, objections continue to be raised even at the turn of the twenty-first century—for example, by Isaac Saney—which is a measure of its lasting impact. Most of the issues raised by the censors probably have never much troubled the majority of readers. However, the portrayal of black characters in the novel has attracted a fair bit of criticism. For instance Roslyn Siegel takes issue with the fact that Tom Robinson, in the tradition of many writings by Southern whites, is seen to be abjectly helpless and wholly reliant on whites. It is true that he can be viewed as a flat character, who really appears only in the capacity of victim—a role which is of course necessitated by the book’s plot. Other blacks appear in much the same light, endowed with “Biblical patience” (Lee, 228), full of humble gratitude toward Atticus for fighting their cause and delivering masses of food to the Finch household in return “although times are . . . hard” (Lee, 232). There is undoubtedly truth in the assertion that Lee does not engage as fully with the black characters in the story as she does with the white (with the notable exception of Calpurnia, the Finches’ 40\n\nCritical Insights\n\nhousekeeper); and there is an undeniable note of condescension at times toward blacks, as when Atticus blasts whites who would “take advantage of a Negro’s ignorance” (Lee, 241, emphasis added). An even more striking instance of this comes from Miss Maudie, who points out that, despite appearances to the contrary, there are white people in Maycomb with some humility—“enough humility to think, when they look at a Negro, there but for the Lord’s kindness am I” (Lee, 257). Such remarks do seem to provide fair ammunition for those who feel that Lee’s depiction of black characters is decidedly limited and—for all the book’s themes of tolerance and understanding— inherently racist. To Kill a Mockingbird, then, is not a radical call to arms; it seems to stop well short of depicting, or even really advocating, proper racial integration. Even Calpurnia, who is the most individualized black character, is said to lead “a modest double life,” an existence outside of the Finch household which is entirely “separate” (Lee, 136); when she takes the children to the Negro church, they notice that she even speaks in an entirely different way than usual, in the black people’s idiom (Lee, 129). Of course, she makes the point that “it’s the same God” (Lee, 129) in reply to one of the black women who complains about her bringing white children to the Negro church; but the sense of division remains. All the same, it is worthwhile remembering that the only time the book ever descends to the level of crude caricature of blacks is in Mrs. Merriweather’s comments at the missionary meeting following the trial, about her servant girl Sophy (Lee, 252-253); and these comments are deliberately meant to reflect back upon the speaker. In fact all the members of the white missionary circle unconsciously reveal themselves to be the most narrow-minded “hypocrites” (Lee, 254) through their supposedly genteel conversation around the tea table. And while it is true that Lee does generally keep a certain distance from the black section of Maycomb society, it might be pointed out that she is merely reflecting the world in which she grew up, where social divisions along racial lines remained rigid. In this way the novel gives Mockingbird in Context\n\n41\n\nreaders today a vivid picture of what everyday life really was like in the American South in that era. Overall, although Lee’s portrayal of blacks has attracted complaints, it is neither an unduly negative nor over-sentimentalized picture that she gives, and generally speaking, readers do not seem to feel that it pulls the book down very sharply. In any case, it is important to bear in mind that Lee’s portrayal of race and race issues is not the whole story. Edgar Schuster states the case as follows: The achievement of Harper Lee is not that she has written another novel about race prejudice, but rather that she has placed race prejudice in a perspective which allows us to see it as an aspect of a larger thing; as something that arises from phantom contacts, from fear and lack of knowledge; and finally as something that disappears with the kind of knowledge or “education” that one gains through learning what people are really like when you “finally see them.”\n\nTom Robinson’s trial, which highlights the racism endemic in Maycomb, is the most dramatic and emotionally charged element of the novel, but it forms only a small part of the larger theme of prejudice in general. It is therefore a tad misleading to describe the novel (as it often is) as dealing predominantly with the issue of racial injustice. Atticus’s oft-repeated maxim illuminates the wider purpose of the story: “You never really understand a person until you . . . climb into his skin and walk around in it” (Lee, 31). He constantly exhorts his children to put themselves in other people’s shoes in order to see things from different perspectives. This is salutary advice in a community as riddled with prejudices as Maycomb, which harbors fixed ideas about how people behave (or ought to behave) according to their race, gender, and class; and Maycomb can be taken as a microcosm of the world at large. For Scout, narrator of the story, this lesson begins and ends with Boo Radley, the mysterious and reclusive neighbor about whom she and her brother Jem and friend Dill spin wild fantasies. But as the novel pro42\n\nCritical Insights\n\ngresses, her understanding and compassion grow, and she gradually realizes that far from the “malevolent phantom” (Lee, 13) that she once imagined him to be, he is actually an eminently decent human being— despite the strange conditions of his life—and she is finally able to recognize him as being a true “gentleman” (Lee, 304). She comes to see the world, quite literally, from his point of view by standing on the Radley porch (Lee, 305)—a place that finally loses the sense of terror it once caused her. Atticus’s injunction to walk around in another person’s shoes in order to understand them extends even to the likes of Bob Ewell, the villain of the piece, as when Atticus explains to his children why Ewell feels the need to threaten him in the aftermath of the trial; Atticus fully understands that, despite the positive outcome of the trial for Ewell, any “credibility” Ewell ever had was destroyed by Atticus’s rigorous cross-examination (Lee, 238). In a similar way, and much more poignantly, a stark comprehension of Mayella Ewell’s position suddenly dawns on Scout during the trial. Living among the lowest of the low in the white community, at the mercy of her brutal father, ostracized by white people as “trash,” and shunned by blacks because she is white, Mayella, as Scout realizes, “must have been the loneliest person in the world. She was even lonelier than Boo Radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years” (Lee, 209). At this point Scout, for a few moments at least, is able to empathize very clearly with Mayella and to understand the basis of her actions in helping to convict an innocent man. The book is nothing if not a call for the enlightenment of empathy, a plea not to judge too quickly and certainly not on the basis of unreasoning prejudice. At the same time it does not take this to maudlin extremes; the Finches display a measure of understanding for the Ewells but do not harbor any particular compassion for them as they are willfully responsible for the great wrong done to Tom Robinson (and Bob Ewell, at least, is seen to be beyond redemption if he can do something as cowardly as attacking children in the dark). Mockingbird simply suggests that people should try to live by a basically decent set Mockingbird in Context\n\n43\n\nof values. There are no unrealistic hopes or expectations that radical changes can take place in people or that miraculous events—like Tom Robinson being acquitted—can happen, but simply an appeal for people to try and understand each other as far as possible. This is the message that continues to resonate with readers worldwide. On one of the rare occasions on which she has broken her silence on the novel, in a 1966 letter to the Richmond News-Leader, Lee herself remarked that “Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.” It is interesting to note that she puts a distinctly “regional” slant on things here, and invokes a broadly Western (Christian) moral framework for her story; but the novel’s relevance certainly does not appear to be limited to any one time or place, or to people of any one particular religious or social background. As Shields says, its “lessons of human dignity and respect for others remains fundamental and universal” (1). Atticus is not the only enlightened adult figure in the book: there are others, like the straight-talking Miss Maudie (who refuses to conform to ladylike notions by spending most of her time outdoors working in her garden and wearing overalls). Mr. Underwood, the editor of the local paper, is another example; he denounces the shooting of the physically disabled Tom Robinson during an escape attempt simply on the grounds that it is “a sin to kill cripples, be they sitting, standing or escaping” (Lee, 262). It is Atticus who absorbs much of the character interest in this regard, however. He has become one of the best-known fictional characters in modern times and functions as a moral exemplar, not least for members of the legal profession, as Alice Petry notes: “Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person” (xxiii). Yet at first glance he does not appear as a typical hero. His physical shortcomings are carefully enumerated; his children chafe against the fact that he is older than their classmates’ parents so that he is unable to play football with 44\n\nCritical Insights\n\nJem, nor does he hunt, drink, play poker, or do anything else glamorous in their eyes; he simply “(sits) in the living room and read(s)” (Lee, 97). Furthermore—in a wry twist on his sister Alexandra’s “preoccupation with heredity” (Lee, 141)—he is virtually half-blind, apparently owing to the fact that “left eyes (are) the tribal curse of the Finches” (Lee, 97). He is deliberately conceived as a foil to the popular image of the macho, gun-toting type of American hero—although ironically, for all his expressed antipathy to guns,4 he proves to be a deadly shot in the incident of the mad dog (Lee, 104). Unfortunately he is not so successful in fighting the “mad dog” of racism;5 as Scout waits for the trial verdict to be announced she feels as though she is watching him walk into the street to shoot the dog all over again “but this time knowing that the gun was empty” (Lee, 230). Of course, his attempt to fight for what he knows is a lost cause is admirable, although it is only the most visible part of his work as lawyer. He also deals with more routine and mundane tasks such as sorting out tax matters (Lee, 126) or “making a will so airtight can’t anyone meddle with it” (Lee, 98). On the face of it there is actually nothing very remarkable about his character; it is simply his principles of hard work, honesty, humility and tolerance, which he always tries to put into practice and also to inculcate in his children, that make him noteworthy. It is precisely because he is, essentially, such an ordinary person that readers identify with him and look to him as a role model; he is manifestly not superhuman. Some might argue, however, that Atticus appears altogether too good and noble, occupying too much of the moral high ground as a man “who does (his) best to love everybody” and who disregards insults from others as it is only a sign of “how poor they are” (Lee, 118). Certainly he has appeared in a less positive light in some revisionist readings of the novel. A notable case of this was an Alabama editorial in 1992 that opined he should not be looked up to because, for all his good points, he still served a racist and sexist legal system. This editorial provoked many replies from lawyers who vehemently disagreed (Petry, xxv-xxvii). Another and more recent example is a critical artiMockingbird in Context\n\n45\n\ncle by Steven Lubet in the Michigan Law Review; again, the strength of the response to Lubet in defense of Atticus illustrates how the character continues to fulfill an important role outside of merely literary discussion. He has come to be accepted as an embodiment of basic decent values which anyone, both in legal work or in day-to-day living, can strive to emulate. The stalwart character of Atticus Finch, then, remains a prime reason for the lasting success and cultural significance of To Kill a Mockingbird. Another is the novel’s style. The issues it deals with are serious, so much so that R. A. Dave has likened it to classical tragedy or epic in its depiction of the defeat of innocence, for which the mockingbird functions as a symbol. Tom Robinson’s death (Lee, 262) and the treatment of Boo Radley (Lee, 202) are both explicitly compared to the shooting of mockingbirds—“which don’t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us,” as Miss Maudie remarks (Lee, 98). The story is also about the loss of innocence in the sense that the children—Scout, Jem, and Dill—come to recognize the nature and the power of evil active in the world as they grow older. However, the book is not weighed down with these themes. Instead it opts for a lively and frequently very humorous mode of narration, from Scout’s perspective as a small child. In using a child-narrator to explore themes of adult prejudices and hypocrisy and racial oppression, the book is comparable to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and, like Twain’s celebrated novel, its style has proved a hit with readers. It is a refreshing and easy-to-read narrative which is also quite subtly done, as Scout’s child-view is aided by the reflections of her older self.
