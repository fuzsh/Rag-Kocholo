        "text": "A ragtag team of former soldiers makes 'The Predator' good, but it could have been better.\n\nCritic's rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars\n\nIf you've heard anything about \"The Predator\" at this point, you might've heard about the controversy involving director Shane Black casting a registered sex offender.\n\nSteven Wilder Striegel, the actor in question, had a small role with Olivia Munn that was cut after Munn told Fox.\n\nKnowing the background drama beforehand could taint the appeal of the film that immediately follows the three standalone \"Predator\" movies.\n\nDespite a solid storyline that adds to the series with a lively team of characters, there are parts of the film that could've been better.\n\nQuinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) is a soldier on a hostage mission in Mexico with his unit when they encounter a Predator, a humanoid alien that hunts humans for sport. It has crashed its spacecraft in the middle of a confrontation. McKenna watches it murder his unit and he runs away while grabbing some of the alien's gear with him for insurance, which he sends back home.\n\nAfterward, he's questioned by government officials who want to cover up the mission and proof of the alien encounter. McKenna knows they're true motives, so he's thrown onto a bus containing a group of ragtag ex-soldiers with robust individual personalities, varying forms of PTSD and colorful backstories to bury the Predator proof with McKenna.\n\nMeanwhile, a government leader of alien investigation Project Stargazer (Sterling K. Brown) recruits biologist and university professor Dr. Casey Brackett (Munn) to examine the Predator that crashed. Of course, things go wrong. It wakes up and wrecks havoc on the scientists and soldiers in its path.\n\nRemember that gear McKenna sent home? His young son Rory (Jacob Tremblay), who appears to have Asperger's syndrome, discovers how the gauntlet and helmet works, putting himself in danger.\n\nIt's up to Quinn, Casey and the ragtag bunch to save the world and McKenna's son.\n\nThe former soldiers that join Quinn on his journey are fantastic. The character development is so well done that you feel bad when something happens. Nebraska (Trevante Rhodes) by far has the most memorable personality of the group.\n\nCoyle's (Keegan-Michael Key) wisecracks are funny if you like immature and offensive humor. The true comic relief comes from physical action, like when Quinn says he'll catch Casey and walks away right when she falls to the ground from the top of the bus.\n\nAlthough, it isn't a \"Predator\" movie without a funny nod to \"you're one ugly mother-(expletive).\"\n\nEven though the group is well-developed, it felt like Munn's character could've been better. It feels like the creators went heavy with the \"you're the only girl in the unit so we're going to hit on you\" jokes when it's clear that she can offer more than what was given.\n\nShe does realize that the Predators are evolving, an important plot point, but scenes like stripping to hide from a Predator outweigh her intellectual importance.\n\nThe movie's storyline as a whole fits in really well with the rest of the series, and it does a great job of paying homage to the original \"Predator\" movie by starting out in a jungle-like setting.\n\nThe Predators look great alongside \"hunting dogs,\" and like always they're out for blood giving viewers flashes of gratuitous gory scenes.\n\nAlso, spoiler-free, the movie offers a great tease to a plot for the next movie (because no matter what they will continue to make these films for a long time).\n\nBut one detail involving disabilities was a bit irksome. Soldier Baxley (Thomas Jane) has Tourette syndrome, a disorder that causes a person to involuntarily twitch or make sounds. He's the butt of many jokes. Meanwhile Rory is \"on the spectrum,\" but he's respected with his bright mind, and his disorder is a crucial attribute to the plot. Why respect one community and offend another?\n\nNo matter what you pick up from the film, sci-fi and \"Predator\" fans will like this film.\n\nMORE REVIEWS:\n\nNicolas Cage at his crazy best in unhinged 'Mandy'\n\n'White Boy Rick' is compelling — and problematic\n\n'A Simple Favor:' Electric chemistry in comic mystery\n\n'Bisbee '17' is cathartic history lesson\n\n'The Predator,' 3.5 stars\n\nDirector: Shane Black\n\nCast: Boyd Holbrook, Trevante Rhodes, Jacob Tremblay, Keegan-Michael Key, Olivia Munn, Sterling K. Brown\n\nRating: R for strong bloody violence, language throughout, and crude sexual references.\n\nGreat ★★★★★ Good ★★★★\n\nFair ★★★ Bad ★★ Bomb ★"
