        "text": "Abigail Rogan (known mononymously as Abigail; born (1946-07-23) 23 July 1946 in London) is a retired English-born Australian character actress particularly of television soap operas and film and was also briefly a vocalist, she emigrated from London in 1968 and became one of Australia's significant sex symbols of the early-1970s. Abigail was educated in France, and came to Australia when she was given the chance to appear as the female lead in a local theatre production in Perth of the British comedy There's a Girl in My Soup.She is best known for her roles in two prominent Australian soap operas, where she became known simply as Abigail, she first became best known to Australians as a sex symbol, in the television soap opera Number 96, as the first actress to play Bev Houghton and then for her role as conniving Caroline Morrell in Sons and Daughters.\n\nAlan Hugh Dale (born 6 May 1947) is a New Zealand-born actor. As a child, Dale enjoyed theatre and rugby. After retiring from the sport, he took on a number of professions, before deciding to become a professional actor at age 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played from 1985 until 1993. He left the series when he fell out with the producers over the pay he and the rest of the cast received. In 2018 it was revealed that Dale would reprise his role as Jim for one episode on December 25, 25 years after his last appearance. After leaving Neighbours, Dale found he had become typecast as Jim Robinson in Australia and struggled to find work. His career was revitalised after he relocated to the United States in 2000. Since then, he has had roles in many American series including prominent parts in The O.C. (as Caleb Nichol) and Ugly Betty (as Bradford Meade), as well as recurring and guest roles in Lost, 24, NCIS, ER, The West Wing, The X-Files, Entourage and Once Upon a Time. Dale has also appeared in minor roles in films such as Star Trek Nemesis, Hollywood Homicide, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as well as the London West End production of Spamalot. Dale has been married to former Miss Australia Tracey Pearson since 1990 and has four children."
