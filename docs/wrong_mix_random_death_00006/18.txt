Coventry buzzed with excitement after it was announced global pop star Robbie Williams was heading to the city.

The former Take That star is performing at the Ricoh Arena on June 13 as part of his Heavy Entertainment Show. Synth duo Erasure are joining him on tour as special guests.

The concert accompanies his 11th studio album, which was released earlier this week, and will be performed at the Coventry stadium on June 13 2017.

The Let Me Entertain You hitmaker's tour also takes in Southampton, Edinburgh, Manchester, Dublin, Cardiff and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Stadium.

Robbie famously left Manchester-formed manband Take That in 1995 to launch a highly successful solo career, making him one of the biggest selling artists of all time and the best-selling British solo artist with hits including the anthemic Angels, No Regrets and the Nicole Kidman duet on Somethin’ Stupid.

Robbie, who is now based in Los Angeles with his wife Ayda Field and their children Teddy and Charlton Valentine, rejoined Take That in 2010 for their Progress album and tour.

He would eventually leave the band for a second time - although it was made clear that the door is open for him to rejoin in the future.

Robbie’s Take That bandmates Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen will also be touring the UK and Ireland in 2017.
