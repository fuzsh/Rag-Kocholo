        "text": "When buying a house in one of California's celebrity-favored neighborhoods, it's more than likely that there will be a famous connection. This huge mansion has double the star power—DJ Khaled just purchased the $9.9 million home from British singer Robbie Williams, reports Trulia. The 10,681-square-foot residence is certainly fit for the rapper and social media star's lavish tastes, with seven bedrooms and a whopping 11 baths, a two-floor entry hall, a formal dining room, an expansive kitchen with a butler's pantry and maid's quarters, and a gym/media room. Outside, there are two terraced patios as well as an outdoor kitchen and a pool and spa. DJ Khaled definitely has the (house) keys to success.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck List $68 Million Beverly Hills Compound\n\nAmid divorce speculation, the couple’s 12-bedroom mansion has officially hit the market\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden List Their Beverly Hills Farmhouse for $17.8 Million\n\nThe couple, who recently welcomed their second child, have owned the seven-bedroom manse since 2020\n\nClever\n\n12 Early Prime Day Dyson Deals to Snap Up Today\n\nEnjoy nice markdowns ahead of the megaretailer's savings event\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nJustin Timberlake Sells Undeveloped 127-Acre Tennessee Plot for $8 Million\n\nThe singer and actor has owned the property for nearly a decade"
