        "text": "CHRISTMAS came early for Robbie Williams while making his new festive album.\n\n“I’ve been celebrating Christmas for the past three years in March, July and August while I’ve been working on this project,” he laughs. “I’m a festive f***er.”\n\nAs well as celebrating the arrival of album No12, the singer reveals he is the happiest he has been in years.\n\n“I’ve embraced the middle of the road and walked towards the naff instead of away from it,” he says. “And I am enjoying my journey now.”\n\nWe meet at his luxurious suite in a central London hotel where he is promoting The Christmas Present. Williams is in a jovial mood and looks healthy, trim and relaxed wearing a pair of Gucci wool slippers. The album was born when he wrote Bad Sharon, which he sings with boxer Tyson Fury.\n\nWilliams explains: “I had an idea to do a birthday song, a New Year’s song, a Valentine’s song and a Christmas song. Then we came up with Bad Sharon and went with Christmas. Christmas songs are huge in America — Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Sia have all had Christmas hits but it’s not the same in the UK. Can you name the last big Christmas song?\n\n“There have been none in ages. Mariah Carey’s All I Want For Christmas Is You was in 1994 and The Darkness did Christmas Time (Don’t Let the Bells End) in 2003. Michael Bublé had a huge album but no Christmas hit singles.”\n\nWilliams asked Fury to be on the record when he was in his dressing room before a fight. He didn’t just connect with Fury because of his love of boxing but also because of how the Gypsy King helps people through his mental health charity work.\n\nWilliams adds: “He’s doing great things helping people. He is the hardest man on the planet — he’s 6ft 9in, tough as f*** and yet really vulnerable.\n\n“The good he is doing by talking about his frailties as a human being is incredibly commendable. We are similar in many ways because we’ve both donned superhero capes and projected a character on to the world and that is not who we really are.”\n\nFor the first time in years Williams confesses that he feels happy, confident and at ease with being in the spotlight.\n\n“I am celebrating who I am right now and I’m not pretending that I’m someone else,” he tells me. I am a middle-aged guy who likes mainstream stuff and feeling cosy at Christmas. Before, I didn’t know who I was. I was very uncomfortable in every situation. I was like an actor and put on a character which served me well — it’s been my shield. I tried on a bit of everything to see who I was. And I did it in public. It was a headf***.\n\n“I was always overwhelmed when I came off stage. Depression, social anxiety and phobias are incredibly debilitating and having to pretend that none of those existed. For two hours I had to pretend that I was Superman.\n\n“Self-esteem has always been a struggle, but those negative voices are very quiet for me right now. They do exist and they will never go away but they are not in the driving seat any more.\n\n“Being a public figure and a people pleaser, I had to protect myself from being scared of strangers approaching me. They’d ask for a photo and you either say no to people and they go away thinking you are a c*** and you hate yourself, or you do everything for everybody and you have nothing for yourself and you hate yourself. It was hard.”\n\nBad Sharon is one of a number of collaborations on The Christmas Present, which is a collection of festive covers and original songs. It’s an album that Williams has surely been destined to make.\n\nGuests include Jamie Cullum on Merry Xmas Everybody, Bryan Adams on Christmas (Baby Please Come Home), Rod Stewart on Fairytales and German singer Helene Fischer on Santa Baby.\n\nWilliams’s dad Pete Conway appears as Poppa Pete on It’s A Wonderful Life. And his seven-year-old daughter Teddy also features on Home, one of the original songs on the album, which he made with long-time co-writer and producer Guy Chambers. And it’s his family — Teddy, Charlie, five, one-year-old Coco and wife Ayda, who Williams credits for him “being in a good place”.\n\nHe says: “I’m in the UK this Christmas and I am really looking forward to it. Everything just seems to be falling into place. I think this is probably the best album that I’ve ever done.”\n\nWilliams “knows how lucky I am” after a health scare left him close to death in 2017.\n\nThe former Take That star became seriously ill while backstage at a stadium gig in Zurich and spent seven days in intensive care after doctors discovered “abnormalities” on his brain.\n\nHe says: “I’ve refocused my life and all the extremities in it. It’s probably why I am on such good form today. It takes nearly dying for someone like me to change the way they live.\n\n“I’ve always thought I was protected and I’ve gone out of my way to test that hypothesis. Like a cat, I’ve had a billion lives.\n\n“But this was the closest and scariest. I also had this f***ed up feeling that I was immortal. But all is OK with my brain now.”\n\nSober for 19 years, Williams is no longer tempted by drink or drugs — but he still takes everything day by day.\n\nHe says: “I thought weed being legalised and available in LA might be a problem but so far so good. The weed there is so insanely strong. It’s so debilitating and I am far too sensitive. So today I will go to bed and I won’t have had any drink or drugs, apart from Nicorette gum.\n\n“If I did, I’d be less of a dad, less of a partner, less of a pop star and less of a friend. But I have a rawness that rubs up against the world and so there have been times I wanted to take that pain away. So far so good. Boxing and golf are my addictions now.”\n\nWilliams is also loving being based in the UK.\n\nHe says: “I’m having a great time here — best time that I’ve had in a long time.\n\n“I do go back to LA for my vitamin D top-up or I’m sad, but our house in the (Wiltshire) countryside has started to feel like the first home that I’ve had since leaving my childhood home in Stoke-on-Trent, when I was 17.”\n\nHe is well aware of how different the lifestyle of his family is compared with his own.\n\n“The kids think all this is normal,” says Williams, arms spread wide showing off the opulence of being in a suite of a five-star hotel. Everything is so normal to them — their dad at a stadium, being at a real princess’s wedding, and travel. They are never going to have what our ‘normal’ was.\n\n“Yes, I know the Royals. But it’s Euge (Princess Eugenie) and (her husband) Jack to us and they are our mates and I am really fond of them.”\n\nThe arrival of Robbie and Ayda’s third child, Coco, in 2018 has brought his family closer. Coco, who is “biologically theirs” was carried by a surrogate mother after Williams and his wife struggled to have a third baby.\n\n“We have all this love to give but, unfortunately, Ayda and myself didn’t have the capacity to make that happen. As much as we tried, and however heartbreaking it was to find yourself in that position, the only option for us as an ageing couple was surrogacy. But the woman who was our surrogate is an incredible person. It was a real gift.\n\n“Will we have any more kids? I hope so. That would be cool. But we will see.”\n\nWilliams credits his wife of nearly ten years for being there for him and for teaching him that he doesn’t always have to be right.\n\nHe says: “Ayda has taught me how to say sorry — I could never before but because of her, it’s becoming easier for me. We are great together and I am still surprised that I’m monogamous. What we’ve got just gets stronger. We have the kind of sickening relationship that Barbara Cartland could write about.\n\n“I met lots of people in my past but she was The One. I could go out and meet anybody but there was nobody I wanted to do anything with.”\n\nWilliams is still in contact with the rest of Take That but only by email.\n\nHe says: “In the past I’ve been obsessed by getting even with people — and Gary (Barlow) was one of them. We had a sibling rivalry. We were the original Liam and Noel. As for Liam, I admire him. He is the voice of a generation, the last of a dying breed, as pop stars are so boring these days. But I still want to fight him. He represents a school bully to me and I would like to take the bully down.”\n\nWilliams will return to Las Vegas for another residency at the Wynn Las Vegas’ Encore Theatre in March. He says: “I can’t wait. I loved playing there earlier and I’ve finally grown into my shoes.\n\n“It has taken a long time, a lot of work and a lot of perseverance.\n\n“But finally, the tectonic plates that run through my psyche are aligned. I mean it.\n\n“I’m 45, I have three kids, a beautiful wife, a great job — I finally and genuinely love my life.”\n\nThe Christmas Present is out today. Robbie plays Radio 2 In Concert next Friday, November 29, 8pm."
