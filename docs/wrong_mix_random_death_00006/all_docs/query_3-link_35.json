        "text": "What are the odds?!\n\nLast year, Robbie Williams celebrated 25 years of being a solo artist with the release of his fantastic album 'XXV' and a tour of the same name, so it's no surprise that he has fans now that date back to his early days in music.\n\nHowever when he recently performed in Budapest, he probably didn't expect to pick the same fan out of the audience 20 years apart.\n\nRobbie took to Instagram to share the incredible chance meeting of a fan in the European city, who he picked out of the audience way back in 2003, and again just a few days ago.\n\nThe singer shared two photos of the pair, the first from this year, where he is resting his head on the tall man's chest, and a second from their first meeting on stage, where Robbie has his arm on his fan's shoulder.\n\nRobbie captioned the pics: 'So this happened two nights ago in Budapest - I chose someone from the audience to come down to the front and, amazingly, I chose the same guy that I picked out from the audience in Budapest 20 years ago!\n\n'The odds of that happening? 174,240,000 to 1. Nice to see you again, sir. Love from Rob x'.\n\nFans couldn't believe what had happened, commenting on Robbie's post saying: 'You have some connection with him!‚ù§Ô∏è', and 'Wow this is amazing! ü•∞ You two have something to do together.' Another fan wrote: 'There‚Äôs a reason this guy is in your life .. stay connected ‚ù§Ô∏è'.\n\nRobbie is mid-way through the European leg of his world tour which includes three dates in the UK, and later this year he is set to release a new Netflix documentary.\n\nThe documentary, which doesn't currently have a name, will include 25 years' worth of never-before-seen footage, with Robbie revealing it will be: \"Warts-and-all, and I'm sure there'll be me giving away too much information about the inner workings of my life and times.\"\n\nTake a look through Robbie Williams' incredible career:\n\nNow read:\n\nRobbie Williams' Netflix documentary: Everything we know so far\n\nRobbie Williams: From Take That to solo pop star\n\nTake That: Everything you need to know about the 90s heartthrobs\n\nHow to listen to Magic:\n\nFrom Ed Sheeran to ABBA, and Take That to Madonna, Magic Radio plays more of the songs you love!
