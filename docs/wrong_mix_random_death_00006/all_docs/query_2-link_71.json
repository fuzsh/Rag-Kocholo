        "text": "A documentary on the life of Take That singer Robbie Williams launches on Netflix today - and his wife has spoken about how he called her to end their relationship as the troubled star lost himself in addiction. The four-part series, Robbie Williams, begins today - and the singer himself has said watching it back is like seeing the car crash of his own life in slow motion.\n\nRobbie, 49, has been married to Ayda Field, 44, since 2010, and speaking in advance of the show going out, she revealed the moment she phoned him as he tried to go into rehab to get clean. She said: “I remember it was 2am and I called him and I was like, ‘I am just getting on the highway’ and he’s like, ‘Are you driving? Call me when you get home.’ “And he is like, ‘I can’t be in a relationship, I have to get better and I can’t be with you. I have to break up with you.”\n\nAyda continued: “And it was like, I understood it because I saw that he was unwell and I remember thinking, ‘I just want you to get better.’” She also admitted she was “so crestfallen” adding: “He was my soulmate and then he was gone.”\n\nThen in rehab he changed his mind - and got back together - and now they have four children together.\n\nRobbie himself has spoken about watching the show back - and he was filmed doing so for his reactions to it. He said: “As humans, nobody likes looking at photographs of themselves and nobody likes hearing their own voice,” he says. “So if you multiply that by watching yourself suffer with mental illness, breakdowns, alcoholism, depression, agoraphobia, fat, thin, all of the above, you’re in a tortuous headlock where you’re forced to watch the car crash in slow-mo.\n\n“And it’s alright. It’s fine. It’s going to work out for me. But that’s what it was like. I came up with my own song: Trauma watch, trauma watch, come and watch me have a trauma watch. So yeah, it was traumatic. And I hope it is for the viewer too. There is your headline.”\n\nRobbie Williams, a four-part Netflix documentary, charts his rise – and the struggles it brought. Williams has sold 75 million albums globally. Only The Beatles have had more number ones. He’s bagged 18 Brit awards.\n\nHe said: “What I’ve done is the equivalent of stretching an elastic band from Stoke to Mars when it comes to my talent and what I actually have to offer the world. Where I’ve found myself amongst selling the most number ones in the UK ever – The Beatles, Rolling Stones and Elvis and me – that wasn’t supposed to f****** happen. I say that in a way, like, I’m as dumbfounded as anybody else. But it is what it is. So I can’t complain.” A pause. He smirks. “But I will.”\n\nIt was in the frenzied days of Take That’s ascent that he first developed the anxiety, body dysmorphia, depression and addiction that would colour many of his subsequent days. Williams added: “It’s very difficult for people to understand the psychology of this great gift that has been given to you, but yet it’s breaking you – why?” Williams says. “You’ve got money, you’ve got people going ‘we love you.’ What’s the problem with that?\n\n“Up to now, mental health was talked about in a different way. What should have happened, which I’m not angry about in any way because I live to tell the tale, was ‘Get in a car, get in a plane, go get better.’ Figure out how to enjoy it. But it didn’t. And it’s OK. It makes life’s tapestry richer, I suppose, and the spoils of what I now get to enjoy as a nearly 50-year-old, much greater.”\n\nWilliams has a stable family life with his wife of more than a decade, Ayda Field Williams, and their four children. He has been sober for more two decades, yet he still wrestles with mental health near daily.\n\nRobbie Williams begins on to Netflix today, Wednesday November 8."
