        "text": "Perth concertgoers have blasted traffic management plans after experiencing hours of traffic gridlock, long waits and walks on the roadside getting in and out of a sold-out Robbie Williams concert on Thursday.\n\nWith the second concert due to go ahead tonight, organisers are scrambling to amend traffic management plans before thousands descend on Nikola Estate, a winery in the Swan Valley east of Perth.\n\nBrad Mellen, managing director of concert promoter Mellen Events, told Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth that \"the traffic management plans that were in place were inadequate for the venue\".\n\n\"We apologise for that; we recognise that there was significant inconvenience to patrons,\" he said.\n\n\"We were up until four o'clock this morning working with the venue and the traffic management company to implement changes to that plan that was in place last night and we're confident we'll improve the situation.\"\n\nMr Mellen said the company would hold talks with Main Roads to better control the traffic lights at Great Northern Highway and Reid Highway and create a second entrance into the venue for the numerous shuttle busses taking concertgoers into the venue, hopefully reducing congestion for patrons driving to the venue.\n\nExpect delays\n\nHe also advised people to get there early if they could and to expect delays.\n\n\"What we can do is give people an undertaking that we're going to work hard all day to try and improve the traffic management conditions, but expect that there's going to be traffic,\" he said.\n\n\"Last night everyone was trying to get into the venue between six and seven o'clock.\"\n\n'Ruined a good concert'\n\nListeners to ABC Radio Perth told of hours-long delays both arriving and leaving the concert, which finished at 10:30pm.\n\nClint: \"I'm wondering what the event organisers would've done at the Robbie Williams concert last night if emergency services vehicles needed to rapidly enter or exit the facility as a result of an emergency. Absolutely disastrous traffic management plan — concert should never have been held out there.\"\n\nSarah: \"Last night's traffic situation after the Robbie show was absolutely terrible. We were stuck in the car park for three hours. We saw ZERO traffic staff in the carpark area. No one explaining anything, no one. There was no water, no way to move anywhere. The only way we got out of the gridlocked car park was because someone opened a gate to a side road where we made our own way out.\"\n\nMary: \"It took us three hours to get there but on the way home … the last train into Perth from Guildford left at 12.05am. We FINALLY arrived at the station at 12.25am. Everyone was standing on the roadside calling taxis and Ubers. There is no lighting along the almost 2km rocky track to the concert area. Robbie was great! But NEVER AGAIN.\"\n\nGary: \"Boarded our Horizon bus at Guildford at 5:30pm only to be stuck on Reid highway for 1.5 hours (on a 1980s bus that should have been condemned) we then illegally walked on the verge of Reid highway for one kilometre then another 4km to Nikola estate arriving at 7:45pm. On the way home one bus broke down. We got to Guildford at 12:30am and home in Perth at 1:00pm. Ruined a good concert.\"\n\nQueues four kilometres long\n\nMike Priest, event manager with Main Roads, said the congestion was compounded by the fact that concert-goers were travelling at evening peak hour.\n\n\"The queues at that time of night are generally busy anyway, because it's peak hour,\" he said.\n\nMr Priest said the department would continue to monitor the Great Northern Highway traffic light signals remotely but said changing them would not entirely solve the problem.\n\n\"[Yesterday] the traffic signals, were doing everything they could, but the queues were coming four kilometres back from the venue,\" he said.\n\n\"So it doesn't matter how much traffic you can push through or how efficiently you do it … they couldn't go any faster.\""
