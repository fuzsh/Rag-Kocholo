        "text": "The LA Art Show in conjunction with Littletopia is proud to announce the first ever Artist Lifetime Achievement award honoring Robert Williams.\n\nRobert almost single handedly created a new art movement (originally called LowBrow) that is now seeing huge influence in almost every strata of the art world. The Littletopia section of the LA Art Show may not even exist if it wasn’t for Williams’ dogged determination to change how contemporary art was perceived.\n\nHe did this by taking a notion of what new art could be like and setting himself up as a model of success for the many other like minded artist to follow. In his writings like the “Rubberneck Manifesto” (from Williams’ book Visual Addiction), and his paintings like “The Land of Retinal Delights” he squared of with Duchamp himself, asserting that the idea is not everything and that a complex concept executed in a skillful and beautiful painting might actually be better than just an idea and might be the future of art.\n\nA quick 20+ year survey bears this out with important publications and major Museum shows from MOCA to MoMA validating his importance. His idea to start Juxtapoz Art Magazine (now the largest selling art magazine in the world) may eclipse his importance as a painter with its untold influence over the past 20 years. Now bigger and stronger than ever, the sky is really the limit for this new movement in the next 20 years. With all this drive and dedication it is only fitting that Robert Williams is recognized for his great contributions to creating a bigger better art world for all of us to enjoy"
