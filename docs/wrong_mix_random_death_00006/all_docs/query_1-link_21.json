        "text": "PRESTONSBURG, Ky. (WYMT) - New homes are bringing new hope to Floyd County.\n\nPlanning is underway for the New Hope Estate subdivision in Prestonsburg. The development is the first phase of a two-property plan, where officials plan to bring more than 40 new homes to flood-impacted families.\n\n“These homes at New Hope Estates are going to be right next to the Big Sandy Area Development District. So, director Ratliff, you’re going to get some good, new neighbors,” Gov. Andy Beshear said during a Team Kentucky update last week.\n\nMuch like the higher ground communities, the project is one of the state’s efforts to rebuild outside of flood-prone areas. With no access to build-ready sites in the heaviest-hit communities, officials say the Prestonsburg project is the best option to keep people close to home and maintain the tax base in the county.\n\n“It’s important to us for us to to maintain and keep these folks home,” said Robbie Williams, Floyd County Judge-Executive. “I would love to go into Wayland and Garrett and McDowell and those areas that were affected by the flooding and build homes in those communities, but we just don’t have the the property readily available.”\n\nGovernor Andy Beshear announced funding for the project last year, later announcing a larger investment in the project. Now, the development is moving forward with a disaster recovery housing intake event on the calendar for Thursday.\n\nFahe officials will be on site at the Floyd County Community Center in Langley, inviting flood victims to find out more information about how to work with the organization to purchase one of the planned homes.\n\nWilliams said the organization helps subsidize down payments and work with eligible homeowners to work out low-interest loans for the homes.\n\nThe event is only to fill the new homes being built on Cliffside Road, but Williams said a future event is in the works to work with those who chose to stay and are looking to repair or rebuild on their flooded properties.\n\n“It’s gonna be a little bit of a disruption, but what we’re hoping is when we come out on the other side a lot of these, folks are going to have new homes and- you know- a new outlook,” Williams said.\n\nWilliams said he encourages anyone interested in owning one of the homes to be at the community center during the event, which will take place from 2 p.m. until 6 p.m. Thursday. Flood survivors should come prepared with photos and other relevant information.\n\nFind out more about the project and the Housing Can’t Wait initiative here."
