        "text": "An entity linked to the co-founder of buy-now-pay-later firm Afterpay, Nick Molnar, has bought an estate in Holmby Hills for $65 million, marking the most expensive residential sale across Los Angeles County this year, The Real Deal has learned.\n\nLapro Property Trust, based in Sydney, Australia, bought the home on North Faring Road, also known as the “Funny Girl” Estate, given it was built for legendary comedian Fanny Brice in 1938, according to property records. The trust was tied to Molnar after it sold a penthouse in Century City for $21 million in March 2023 to Rihanna.\n\nJames Harris and David Parnes of Carolwood Estates brokered the deal on behalf of the buyer and seller.\n\nMolnar did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBritish pop singer Robbie Williams sold the 18,900-square-foot, seven-bedroom estate in an off-market deal. Williams bought the property for $49.5 million in March 2022, using a $32 million loan from JPMorgan, records show.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nLast year, the building was put up for rent asking $220,000 a month, according to online listings, though by October the listings were removed.\n\nThe Georgian-style main house has three stories, with a grand spiral staircase, chef’s kitchen, and marble and stone fireplaces.\n\nThe sweeping 2-acre estate has no shortage of amenities: a garage for more than 15 cars, a sauna, fitness center, two guesthouses, a wine cellar, saltwater pool, koi pond and vegetable gardens, according to the 2022 listing for the property.\n\nGiven the property is in the city of Los Angeles, Lapro Property Trust coughed up almost $3.9 million in transfer taxes, under Measure ULA, which adds a 5.5 percent transfer tax on all residential and commercial sales of $10 million or more.\n\nThe transfer tax hasn’t scared off everyone from buying and selling. Last month, a spec home in the Bird Streets sold for $63 million, the second most expensive deal across L.A. County this year.\n\nLapro Property Trust also owns an estate less than a mile away in Bel-Air. In 2022, the trust bought a home on Copa De Oro Road from nightclub and hotel mogul Sam Nazarian for $34.8 million, records show."
