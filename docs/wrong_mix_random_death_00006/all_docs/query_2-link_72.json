        "text": "He first rose to fame in Take That alongside Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald and now, 25 years after breaking hearts across the world when he went solo, Robbie Williams is launching a brand new band.\n\nThe 46-year-old has joined forces with Australian songwriters and producers Flynn Francis and Tim Metcalfe for the group, and although they don’t yet have a name, the trio have been hard at work in the studio and already have songs to release.\n\nRobbie broke the exciting news on Instagram Live, telling fans, “Little project that I’ve got going on with a couple of friends of mine, Flynn Francis and Tim Metcalfe. We’re forming a band everyone.\n\n“I’ve got songs coming out that will not be under the name of Robbie Williams.”\n\nThe former X Factor judge has grand plans to tour the world with his new act, although it sounds like their musical output will be very much worlds apart from Take That’s chart-friendly pop tunes.\n\nRobbie continued, “I’m gonna do this thing with my friends. Form a band and what I’m gonna do is rent a space, put my art in there. During the day it’ll be a gallery. Then at night I shall be DJing and it will be a musical venue, something the old folks will call a rave.\n\n“I’ll be on the espressos. Oh yes I will. Quadruple espresso. Doing it old school. I’m very, very excited about this. I want to do it in Berlin. I also want to do it in Tokyo. I wanna do it in several places. Be fun won’t it?\n\n“It’s one of them things, it’s a passion project. If something happens then great, if not, I’ve just had fun.”\n\nCHECK OUT Take That through the years\n\nGallery\n\nTake That through the years stacked\n\n1 of 25\n\nCREDIT: Take That u00a9 PA Images\n\n1989\n\nStarting with a line-up of five young men, Take That consisted of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams, with the original (short lived) name of Kick It.\n\n2 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1991\n\nTake That's original line-up of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams. Thankfully they changed their name and after a few unsuccessful songs in the early 90s Take That's breakthrough hit 'It Only Takes A Minute' was released. The song was a cover of a 1975 song by Taveres and reached number 7 in the charts.\n\n3 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1992\n\nIn 1992 Take That had hits with 'A Million Love Songs' and 'Could It Be Magic'. The boys' follow-up single 'Could It Be Magic' quickly propelled them to super-stardom with a string of number 1s not far away.\n\n4 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1993\n\nTake That had huge success in 1993 with 'Pray', 'Relight My Fire' (featuring Lulu) and 'Babe'.\n\n5 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1994\n\nThe band's success continued in 1994 with 'Everything Changes' and 'Sure'. Here they are performing at The BRITs 1994.\n\n6 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1995\n\nHowever, in July 1995 after countless hits, fans heard the devastating news; Robbie Williams would be leaving the band following friction with other band members. Robbie later admitted in a TV documentary in 2005, that he did some \"stupid stuff\" after parting ways with the band over 20 years ago, but said he didn't regret it because he was young.\n\n7 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1995\n\nThe remaining members of Take That continued to perform as a quartet.\n\n8 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n1996\n\nGary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and Jason Orange performed at The BRITs in 1996. The remaining group of four continued to tour and release songs for another year, releasing 'Never Forget' and the Bee Gees cover 'How Deep Is Your Love', finally announcing they would be disbanding in February 1996. 'How Deep Is Your Love' became the band's final number 1 before they reformed 10 years later.\n\n9 of 25\n\nCREDIT: Howard Donald u00a9 PA Images\n\nLate 90's\n\nDuring the late 90s three of the band members, Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams, enjoyed solo singing careers with varying degrees of success. Jason Orange went into acting and Howard Donald, despite being the lead singer on a number of Take That songs, made a name for himself as a club DJ across Europe.\n\n10 of 25\n\nCREDIT: Take That u00a9 PA Images\n\n2005\n\nSkip nearly a decade and ITV reunited the group for a documentary called Take That: For the Record in which the former members of the boyband were interviewed, discussing how they were discovered and looking back at their experiences in the band.\n\n11 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n2005\n\nFollowing the successful reception of the documentary by fans and the press, the decision was made to reunite with the 'post Robbie' line-up and a 2006 tour titled the 'The Ultimate Tour' was announced. After a break of nearly 10 years, Take That members Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and Jason Orange reformed in 2005.\n\n12 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n2006\n\nTake That performed on The X Factor in 2006. In 2006 they had a Number 1 single with 'Patience'. Gone were the cheesy pop tunes of the 90s, Take That had grown up with their fans and the men, now in their 30s revealed a much more mature sound, with their 2006 comeback single 'Patience'. The song quickly hit the top spot in the UK and around Europe becoming the eighth best-selling single of 2006 spending a massive 11 weeks in the top 10.\n\n13 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n2007\n\nIn 2007 Take That embarked on their 'Beautiful World' tour. Since their reunion as a four-piece, it was clear that they hadn't lost the momentum they had in the 90s with another string of hits including 'Shine', 'Rule the World' and 'Greatest Day'.\n\n14 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2009\n\nAfter the release of fifth album 'The Circus' in December 2008, the boys headed out on their 'Take That Present: The Circus Live' tour to promote it - and what a spectacle it was!

Then, later that year, the news that all Take That fans had been waiting for was confirmed, the original line-up would be reforming for the wildly successful album, 'Progress' and its live tour. Their lead single 'The Flood' was released and peaked at number 2 featuring both Gary and Robbie as lead vocals.\n\n16 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Getty Images\n\n2011\n\nFollowing the band's 'Progress Live' tour in 2011 they then decided to take a break.\n\n17 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n2014\n\nA couple of years later Take That reformed as a group to record their seventh studio album, but it was short-lived, in 2014 both Robbie and Jason decided to leave. Robbie had recently become a dad for the second time and saying he would find it difficult \"logistically\". The band continued as a trio made up of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen.\n\n18 of 25\n\nCREDIT: u00a9 Shutterstock\n\n2017\n\nTake That returned earlier this year with their new album 'Wonderland' and their single 'Giants' which peaked at number 13.
