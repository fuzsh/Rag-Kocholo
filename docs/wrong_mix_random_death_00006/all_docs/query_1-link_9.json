        "text": "Flood survivors still looking for a high ground home in eastern Kentucky have an opportunity for housing in Floyd County.\n\nFahe will begin taking applications for eligible homeowners for New Hope Estates in Prestonsburg this week.\n\nRobbie Williams is the Judge Executive for Floyd County. During a recent press conference, he said this partnership with Fahe is a tremendous help to his community.\n\n“It takes a load; it takes a burden off of us. We have minimal resources, staff, the technical issues we don’t understand as Judge Executives in trying to get into housing, and how to develop and get these folks back into affordable and quality housing.”\n\nHe said two years later, people in his and other eastern Kentucky counties need housing.\n\n“We still have folks that are homeless, we still have people living in neighbors’ guest homes, or in basements, its important and this component of the process is going to streamline the application process to get these folks in homes as quickly as we can.”\n\nFahe will be hosting a kickoff event will be Thursday, July 18 at the Floyd County Community Center.\n\nMore information on applying can be found here."
