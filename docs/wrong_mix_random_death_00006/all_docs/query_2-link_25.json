        "text": "Synopsis\n\nFamed British music artist, Robbie Williams’ self-titled documentary will be released on November 8 on Netflix coinciding with the musician’s 25th anniversary of his solo career. As his fans gear up for the four-part documentary, here are 5 hit songs of the most successful UK solo artist.\n\nA documentary on Robbie Williams, the greatest solo music artist of the UK, will be released on Netflix on 8th November coinciding with the musician's 25th anniversary of his career.\n\nAs per reports, the four-part documentary series will be focusing on his life and career, starting from his days as a part of “Take That,” the all-boys music group to his eventual solo run.\n\nIn the trailer of the documentary, Williams was seen and heard saying that what happened in life was “astounding,” and that his past had put him in a “headlock.”\n\nAs his fans and critics gear up for this documentary, here are 5 hit songs from the British musician.\n\nCome Undone\n\nThis is one of Williams’ biggest hits and comprises a soothing piano tune coupled with acoustic guitar strumming making it one of the best ballads of the 2000s era. Williams describes himself as someone who is “full of shit,” a “corporate suit” which speaks about his life of stardom that makes the song an all time classic.\n\nKids\n\nThis song consists of an amazing chorus along with a beautiful feature by fellow musician Kylie Minogue. The lyrics of this song were based on the media’s fascination with Williams’ sexuality that made this track significantly appealing and interesting.\n\nAdvertising Space\n\nThis song was co-written by Williams and Stephen Duffy, one of the biggest pop-music artists from the 1980s era. This ballad is one of a kind and deals with crucial historical moments like the death of American rock and roll artist, Elvis Presley and issues like the connections between business and art.\n\nNo Regrets\n\nThis song talks about Williams’ regret about splitting with his former music group “Take That.” This is what makes the track very ironic as Williams reportedly spoke against the members of the music group in various interviews from time to time.\n\nLet Me Entertain You\n\nThis song is often the opening track for Williams when performing live and speaks about his need for a deep connection with someone, rather than his desire for a large audience.\n\nAccording to reports, the documentary will showcase 30 years worth of “never-before-seen” footage from Williams’ life which will make this series “culture defining.”\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ1. What is Robbie Williams’ net worth?\n\nAns1. As per reports, the UK music artist Robbie Williams has a net worth of $300 million.\n\nQ2. Who is Kylie Minogue?\n\nAns2. Kylie Minogue is an Australian singer-songwriter and is the highest-selling female artist of the country with more than 80 million records sold globally.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
