The city’s art scene continues to come into its own with an ever-growing network of artists, art schools, galleries, collectors, and institutions (such as the recently opened Broad Museum in downtown L.A.) who are making a mark on the world of contemporary art. Though contemporary art tends to dominate the headlines, there remains a regional flavor to many collecting genre up and down the Pacific Coast, from American Western art, California Impressionists, Bay Area Figurative art, post-war design, as well as Asian art and Latin American art given the region’s proximity to the Pacific Rim. Crucially, because artwork on display in coastal California faces unique risks in the form of wildfires and earthquakes, current appraisals are an indispensable risk management tool for collections of all sizes. From our office in Los Angeles, we cover all of California and the Pacific Northwest."
