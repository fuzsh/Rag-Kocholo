        "text": "How can I get in touch with the customer service department?\n\nIf you have a question or experiencing any technical difficulty regarding an order or any of the products that appear on one of our stores then you can reach our customer service department by emailing support@kontrabandstores.com, we aim to reply to all support queries within 24 hours.\n\nHow long will it take to get my order?\n\nAll orders placed before 14:00, Monday - Friday are usually dispatched on the same day. Orders placed at any other time will be dispatched on the next working day. Once your order has been dispatched, you will receive an email informing you that your order is on its way.\n\nBelow is a rough guide of how long orders usually take to get to you after they've been dispatched.\n\nService / Destination Estimated delivery time\n\n(business days) UK 1st Class 2-3 days UK 2nd Class 3-5 days Western Europe 7-10 days Eastern Europe 7-14 days USA / Canada 7-14 days Rest of the world 7-21 days\n\n(depending on location)\n\nPlease note, that these are estimates and not guarantees. Once your order has shipped it is passed on to your local postal service, who will deliver it to you in keeping with their standard working practices.\n\nI entered my shipping address incorrectly, what can I do?\n\nAll orders are immediately sent to the shipping department and processed, we cannot stop the order. If you contact us immediately after placing the order at support@kontrabandstores.com we will try to amend the order before it ships. However, if the order has already been shipped, we will be unable to amend the order. If the item is due to be signed for and you are not there to sign for it the delivery person will leave a note to say they attempted delivery, it will then be returned to your local post office, you should allow 48 hours for it to arrive there. If the item is not signed for the item will be posted at the original address requested.\n\nCan you deliver to my work?\n\nWe can deliver to your work or your home, but we do not deliver to a PO Box for security purposes.\n\nI've changed my mind, and wish to cancel my order. How can I do that?\n\nAll orders (excluding pre-orders) are immediately sent to the shipping department and processed. As a result, you will not be able to cancel the order before it ships out. Once the order has been shipped, it cannot be canceled and you will need to follow the procedures for a return.\n\nI ordered a pre-order item along with other merchandise. Why haven’t I received anything?\n\nWhere possible we will ship your order in its entirety. If you have ordered several items and part of the order is a pre-order then items that we currently have will be fulfilled immediately and upon the arrival of the stock for the pre-ordered items you purchased, we will then complete your order.\n\nI ordered a pre-order, but it is not scheduled to release for awhile. Why was I already charged?\n\nTo secure your item, our system automatically charges your card. In purchasing a pre-order, the item is held for you. We do our best to get you the item by the release date, but that is not always guaranteed.\n\nThe item will ship on or around the release date.\n\nHow do I download digital purchases?\n\nOnce you've purchased a product that includes a digital download, you'll be redirected to a page with the links to download. You'll also be sent an email with the links to download.\n\nHow do I return products for a refund?\n\nFor more information on how to return items, please click here.\n\nMy card keeps getting declined. What is going on?\n\nDon’t worry - there are 2 main reasons that your card could be declined:\n\nWe could not match the credit card address to the address entered. Make sure you typed the billing information in the correct area, and you entered the address exactly as it appears on your credit card bill.\n\nThe bank has declined the card. Either there is a hold on the card or insufficient funds. Please contact your bank for more information.\n\nIf you keep getting an error message on payment please contact us at support@kontrabandstores.com, please do not keep attempting to purchase.\n\nDo you accept Visa Gift Cards?\n\nUnfortunatly at this moment in time we are unable to accept Visa gift cards.\n\nWhy do I need to create a log in and password?\n\nFor your convenience, the system will save your order history, primary billing, and primary shipping address. Your credit card information is secure, and is not saved.\n\nWhen will my charge be processed?\n\nWhen you make a purchase, the charge is processed immediately. Depending on our payment processing partner, charges can take up to 3-5 business days to appear on your account.\n\nWho are Kontraband?\n\nWe are the official online merchandise partner in this instance we provide the website, store and the payment processing, fulfilment and products in the store.

However sometimes some of our products are very popular and sell out very quickly, so you need to be quick to get your hands on them. We do our best to keep on top of stock and predict the sales we may receive so this doesn’t happen. Sometimes our products are ‘Limited Edition’ and so once they are gone they are gone. If the product is still being made please check back in a day or two where we will be updating the stores and the products with information and stock on a regular basis.\n\nI can’t sign into my account?\n\nWhen you return to shop with us, or want to access your account to see your details, we ask you to sign in. If you find that you are having difficulty signing in because your username or password is not recognised please check you are using the correct login details that you registered with us. If you have forgotten your username or password you can request a reminder by clicking \"forgot password\" on the user login page.\n\nHow do I logout of my account?\n\nGo to the top of the page and click on ‘log out’ if you’re not logged in it will say ‘log in’.\n\nWhat do the Status updates mean?\n\nAfter receiving you order confirmation you will then receive notification telling you your order has been updated.\n\nPending - Order has been placed but NOT paid.
