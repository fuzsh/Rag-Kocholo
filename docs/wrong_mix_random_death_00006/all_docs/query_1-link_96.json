        "text": "Robbie Williams has finally sold his countryside mansion for £6.75m after months of trying.\n\nThe former Take That star put the seven-bedroom Wiltshire property on the market back in September and it has only now been snapped up.\n\nThe 47-year-old singer bought the mega-mansion back in 2009 for £8.1m, and has since put it on the market three times, reports The Daily Mail.\n\nREAD MORE:BBC One's Dragon's Den: Fans elated after Somerset's Deborah Meaden invests in West Country business\n\nHe reluctantly reduced the asking price in September, despite average UK property prices soaring in recent times.\n\nLuxury estate agent Knight Frank has confirmed that the property has now been sold subject to contract.\n\nA source said: \"It really is stunning, but it is just not being offered on.\n\n\"The price may be too high for the current climate of buyers, but it doesn't seem like he wants to come down from what it has been valued at.\n\n\"It is causing all sorts of headaches.\n\n\"Online, the house is doing so well, everyone is clicking on it and wants to take a look around, but the reality is, it has been sat there six months now and it needs looking at, because it's not moving.\"\n\nThe singer did little to help the chances of a sale back in 2020, when he claimed that the Compton Bassett country manor was potentially haunted.\n\nHe said at the time: \"There is one room that I am suspicious of.\n\n\"It gives me the creeps. Teddy, our daughter, was sleeping in there. She doesn't any more.\n\n\"Teddy told me, ''That room scares me. I don't like that house.'\n\n\"I said, 'It scares me, too. You don't have to sleep there any more.'\n\n\"If there is great grief or great pain or tragedy, I think it can soak into the walls and leave an essence there that remains for a very, very long time.\"\n\nThe property is on a 71-acre country estate and features an additional cottage, a football pitch, a tennis court, a helicopter hangar and two flats for staff members.\n\nInside there is a leisure spa featuring gym, indoor swimming pool, hot tub and sauna.\n\nWhen the house was put on the market, Robbie said: \"Compton Bassett House has been the perfect escape for our family. It is where Ayda and I truly fell in love, set roots as a couple, and dreamed of our future family.\n\n\"Since then, we have welcomed four beautiful children into the gracious rooms at Compton Bassett House, where we have shared much laughter and joy.\n\n\"The gardens and trees have enchanted us with their magic, and on rainy days (of which there are many in England), we have played and splashed around the indoor pool, much to our delight.\n\n\"Compton Bassett House is most definitely a family-friendly house that deserves to have much more laughter and joy within its beautiful walls. We hope the incoming purchaser will enjoy just as much as we have.\"\n\nThe singer's property portfolio also includes a Beverley Hills mansion and a £17m home in Notting Hill, West London."
