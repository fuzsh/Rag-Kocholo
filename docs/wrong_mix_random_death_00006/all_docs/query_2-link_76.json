        "text": "The Villages have been making headlines a lot in recent years and not just for their color-coded loofas. Over the last few years, many sinkholes have opened up within the community causing problems. This past weekend, another sinkhole in The Villages caused the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office to take action.\n\nThe Sumter County Sheriff’s Office took to Facebook to announce what was going on with The Villages. They said, “The roadway on Southern Trace between Williams Rd and Woodridge Dr in The Villages will be closed until further notice due to a sink hole. Sumter County Sheriff’s Office, Sumter County FD, and Road Department are on scene at this time.”\n\nHistory Of Sinkholes In The Villages\n\nThis isn’t the first time sinkholes have popped up in The Villages. Back in 2002, there were sinkholes plaguing the community. There were over 13 sinkholes that developed in a retention pond off Higgins Lake on a golf course in the villages.\n\nMany of the residents back in the early 2000s worried for the safety of their homes. One resident came back late on a Sunday evening and said, “I just came in last night from the airport at nine o’clock and found a couple of yellow notes on the door that said ‘Don’t go into the back yard you’ve got sinkholes.’ Well, we’ve always got sinkholes out in the pond, but I turned on the floodlight and there was one in my backyard.”\n\nFast forward to June 2023, and sinkholes in The Villages are still a problem. Roads closed in front of the recreation area in the community for a sinkhole that swallowed up the landscaping. The hole was approximately 10 feet deep.\n\nWhat Causes Sinkholes In The Villages To Form?\n\nFlorida is a breeding ground for Sinkholes. Ever heard of the legendary I-4 sinkhole? The heavy rainfalls in the rainy season combined with periods of drought and the low elevation make it easier for sinkholes to form.\n\nSo, why did this Sinkhole In The Villages form? Sinkholes begin when the ground cannot support the weight of what is above ground. With the rapid growth of many areas throughout Florida, sinkholes may happen more and more.\n\nAccording to the Department of Environmental Protection, sinkholes are not a hole in the rock below. These sinkholes are just what we see on the surface. The cavity or void in the rock below takes hundreds of thousands of years to actually form.\n\nSoil from the ground above moves into the cavity (void) in the rock. ‘Sticky’ soil can cause voids to form in the soil. In just a few days to years, more and more soil washes down and the void rises to the surface. This is when it collapses and the sinkhole forms.\n\nThe Sumter County Sheriff’s Office has not yet given an update on the Sinkhole In The Villages. For more information on the road closure in The Villages, you can contact the SCSO at 352-793-2621.\n\nOriginally from the Midwest and moved down to Tampa Bay after college.
