        "text": "Robbie Williams has opened up about the life of a globe-trotting popstar, revealing he’s never felt like he’s had a home since his childhood.\n\nThe 49-year-old grew up in Stoke-on-Trent before packing his bags aged just 16 to become the youngest member of Take That, touring the world and eventually embarking on his hugely successful solo career.\n\nBut the nomadic life of a megastar has taken its toll on the Rock DJ singer, who told Metro.co.uk and other press he hadn’t felt settled for the past three decades.\n\nRobbie explained: ‘I’ve never felt like I’ve had a home since I left my home in Stoke. It’s very much home to me, even though I’m not there.\n\n‘Everywhere else, I’ve just felt like a caravan moving – impermanent and wonderful and luxurious and great – but nothing’s felt like home since I was Robert Williams in Stoke-on-Trent.’\n\nAfter struggling with the level of scrutiny in the UK and Europe, Robbie moved to America and has lived in LA with his wife wife Ayda Field, 44, and their four children Teddy, 11, Charlie, nine, Coco, five, and Beau, three, ever since.\n\nRobbie admitted never cracking the US has done wonders for his personal life, revealing: ‘In America, I can just get about and be a dad, be a husband, and then put my cape on and go be Batman in the rest of the world.’\n\nThe Millennium singer was similarly frank when discussing his controversial 2006 single Rudebox on which he raps, marking a huge department from his previous hits including ballad Angels and pop banger Let Me Entertain You.\n\n‘Oh god, my biggest regret is putting that out there as the first single [from that album],’ Robbie squirmed as he spoke ahead of the release of his Netflix documentary.\n\nExplaining his decision-making over the release strategy, Robbie said when he wrote the album, also called Rudebox, it was the first time he had ‘real proper fun’ making a record and wanted to share that feeling with listeners.\n\n‘It was all joyous and daft and silly and obviously full of humour – and [I thought that] people were gonna love it because I’m being me for the first time. I’d found my place,’ he recalled.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Robbie admitted he should have released Rudebox as a later single and explained beforehand it was ‘daft’, adding: ‘You know, I’m not trying to be a grime artist.’\n\nIn the documentary, archive footage shows an enthusiastic Robbie gleefully telling an audience Rudebox was poised to be his biggest hit – more successful than Angels, one of the UK’s best-selling singles in the 90s.\n\nHaving watched the four-parter, Robbie called that moment his ‘biggest cringe point’ but joked Rudebox still had a huge influence over his music career.\n\nHe remarked: ‘Actually, it’s my second most important single because Angels gave me the career and Rudebox heralded the end of my imperial phase. So in a way I was right, but not in the way that I wanted to be.’\n\nRobbie Williams – the documentary – is an unflinching portrait of a popstar struggling with fame and the British press, high-profile relationships including Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, and mental health and addiction issues.\n\nIn one harrowing snapshot from his career, Robbie discussed suffering a prolonged panic attack during a Leeds performance on his 2006 Close Encounters tour.\n\nVowing never to perform again, Robbie begged his management to cancel the following dates. But his team rejected his request, telling him it would be too costly to end the tour prematurely.\n\nReflecting on the tour, Robbie now believes: ‘What should have happened -which I’m not angry about in any way because I lived to tell the tale – was get in a car, get in a plane and just get better. Figure out how to enjoy it.’\n\nA huge advocate for speaking openly about mental health, Robbie said he was recently ‘triggered’ after a critic complained about ‘celeb washing of mental illness’ and accused stars of making the illness ‘sexy.’\n\nRobbie continued: ‘There’s nothing sexy about taking a knife and slashing your own wrists that I did.\n\n‘The reason I say that is to qualify that people are people. Whether they’re on MAFS or in Martin Scorsese’s new film, we better be careful how and what we accuse people of or say what we think of them when it comes to their own mental illnesses.\n\n‘I haven’t had a drink for 24 years and I haven’t done drugs for a decade or so. There’s a reason people stop: because they’re in hell.’\n\nIn the documentary, Robbie credits his recovery to his family: wife Ayda Field, 44, and their four children Teddy, 11, Charlie, nine, Coco, five, and Beau, three.\n\nRobbie and Ayda have always shielded their family from the limelight but Teddy pops up in several moments during the documentary, desperate to learn more about her father’s life as an entertainer.\n\nWould he support her decision to follow in his footsteps? ‘I’d be very I find it very confusing if she didn’t [want to]. She was like wanting to be a doctor or professional person.\n\n‘I hope that whatever her passion is, she gets to be able to do it. And it actually seems like she’s destined to do something that I do. Whatever shape that is I don’t know, but I’ll be there for her.’\n\nRobbie also insisted he had no regrets over his career path, first shooting to fame in Take That before striking out on his own. This is despite the admission in the documentary that being an entertainer was the ‘thing that made me successful but also destroyed me.’\n\nHowever, he said he would do it all again: ‘Would I entertain? Yeah. Would I choose this particular medium? I’m so grateful that I’ve got as lucky as I got. So I’d have to choose it again But if I could [have had] a manifestation board in front of me, I wouldn’t have picked boyband.’\n\nInstead, Robbie said he would have become a content creator on YouTube, before adding: ‘But if I could have chosen my own path, I’d probably erroneously wanted to be an actor.\n\n‘But acting is really boring.’\n\nRobbie Williams is available to stream on Netflix from November 8.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Robbie Williams reveals why he was so paranoid during Geri Halliwell relationship"
