        "text": "Williams has filed to trademark the brand name with the UK’s Intellectual Property Office, The Sun​ has reported. The title gestures to his 2006 record Rudebox.\n\nThe Angels​ singer is planning to release a range of wines, alcopops and spirits under the name Rude Rise, despite being sober for the past 20 decades, according to The Sun.​\n\nThis follows fresh off the heels of Barlow who launched an organic wine brand last year, which has already sold more than 500,000 bottles.\n\nBarlow said his passion for wine had developed over the years, and sustainability was key to the production of his wine. Bottles are priced at jus £8 and are stocked in Morrison’s and Asda.\n\nCareer history\n\nThe singer-songwriters rose to stardom as teenagers in the 90s as members of boyband Take That and have gone on to enjoy successful solo careers.\n\nThe band split in February 1996 after three years of success including seven number one hits.\n\nWilliams launched his solo venture the same year with a cover of George Michael’s Freedom​ which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nSustainable wine\n\nOn the Organic Wine website Barlow said: \"The definition of a great evening for me is friends, laughter and good wine. I’ve been fortunate enough to have travelled and experienced different cultures over the years and wines from across the world.\n\n\"After months of learning about the process and tasting different blends, I’m very proud to now launch my own range of organic wines from Spain.’\n\nHe also said the range of red and white and rosé wines, made in partnership with Benchmark Drinks, could be enjoyed in Spanish style sunshine or around the table at Christmas with your loved ones."
