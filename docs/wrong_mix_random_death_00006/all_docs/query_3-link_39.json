        "text": "Suzie Poullos received confirmation of her seats the day beforehand – she bought them more than a year ago to ensure she could be out of the weather and have full view of the stage and screens.\n\nHer and her husband however, ended up seated in a makeshift floor area on cheap plastic seats with an obstructed view of both the screen and stage.\n\nOne seat couldn’t even sit flat because it was perched on top of a cable guard.\n\n“I was just so shocked and I was really annoyed because I picked those seats specifically and I did it over a year ago. I just don’t understand how they can do that,” Mrs Poullos told news.com.au.\n\nThe couple spent about $400 on their tickets and both, being experienced concertgoers, had put considerable thought into where they wanted to sit.\n\n“It was honestly devastating because I’m a really good researcher and look for what tickets I want,” Mrs Poullos said.\n\n“I picked those seats because they were on the end, so I could get up and dance if I wanted, but also because I was on the side, I wouldn’t have people directly sitting in front of me.”\n\nStaff at the event were just as confused by the late change, she said, while one of the ushers said it had never happened before, describing the situation “disgusting”.\n\n“The people at the stadium box office just said it was a production issue,” she said, adding she contacted Ticketek and Frontier Touring before and after the concert but never heard back.\n\nAcknowledging her problem might sound “silly” to some, she stressed how enthusiastic she had been about the concert and the seats, and how brutally disappointed she ended up being, particularly to only be told of the change a few hours beforehand.\n\n“When you specifically pick seats over a year ago, you don’t expect to get a text on the day of the concert saying, ‘sorry we’ve changed your seats and we’re giving you these ones on the floor’,” she said.\n\n“I would never buy seats on the floor. I would go in the mosh pit, but I would never buy floor seats because it’s so hard to see over the top of people and there’s no point having a seat because everyone just stands up anyway.”\n\nMrs Poullos has called for a full or at least partial refund of her tickets, arguing the seats they were given weren’t worth anywhere close to $200 each.\n\n“I would have rather been up in the nosebleeds than down on the floor,” she said.\n\n“That’s what was annoying me, I couldn’t see the stage clearly like I would in an elevated section.”\n\nThe floor seating put a “dampener” on the night, she added, having seen Williams perform multiple times previously with no issues.\n\nTicketek and Frontier Touring have been contacted by news.com.au for comment."
