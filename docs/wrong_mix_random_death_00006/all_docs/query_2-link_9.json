        "text": "British pop singer and former Take That member Robbie Williams is set to make his metaverse debut.\n\nWilliams’ first foray into the Web3 space is a partnership with AI-powered lifestyle metaverse platform, LightCycle, a virtual city with elements of art, film, gaming, music, fashion, sport, property and retail. A personal performance of Williams’ 25-year anniversary live show, designed as a 3D metaverse experience, will take place in the virtual city. LightCycle is due to launch in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe musician’s initiation into the realm began with his AI-assisted composition of his signature 1997 song “Angels (Beethoven AI).”\n\nThe partnership was formed between Williams and metaverse, Web3 and AI infrastructure provider Vertexlabs.uk. A preview of the Williams metaverse event will be unveiled as part of a LightCycle preview night at Edge Global Web3 and AI investment summit, taking place in Hong Kong at the AsiaWorld-Expo on Sept. 26 and 27.\n\nWilliams said: “Staying connected with my fans has always been important to me. I’m fascinated by the Web3 space – it’s full of creativity and mind-blowing potential. It’s also a big new market for music discovery. As an artist, I’m always looking for ways to push forward so this is the perfect next step in that journey. The talented development team at LightCycle have produced some incredible work and I’m excited to see it all brought to life in full 3D glory.”\n\nSara Ezen, CEO of LightCycle, added: “Robbie has a dedicated and passionate fanbase and we believe that, through our unparalleled technology, we can bring them a supremely enhanced environment and fan-experience. The concert is truly something special and we’re excited to be giving it a home in LightCycle so his fans, new and old, can enjoy next-level interaction and engagement. We are looking forward to seeing where we can go with this.”\n\nAnder Tsui, founder and CEO of Vertexlabs.uk, said: “We’ve had a lot of fun creating the project and we can’t wait to share it with the world. We hope that, through Robbie’s initiation into Web3, new and existing fans can elevate their entertainment experience in a virtually enhanced way.”"
