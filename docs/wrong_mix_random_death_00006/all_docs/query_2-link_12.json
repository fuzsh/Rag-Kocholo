        "text": "Synopsis\n\nDuring his performance for 38,000 fans at Sydney's Allianz Stadium, 49-year-old superstar Robbie Williams openly addressed his struggles with substance abuse and mental health during the peak of his drug addiction. This candid portrayal of his life was also depicted in his Netflix documentary. Williams shared with his audience the transformative impact of his visit to Australia during the pandemic last year, where he filmed his biopic \"Better Man,\" as he embarked on a journey to seek happiness.\n\nRobbie Williams opened up on his battle with addiction as he made an emotional speech to his fans in Sydney earlier this week\n\nThe 49-year-old superstar, while performing for 38,000 fans at Sydney's Allianz Stadium, openly addressed his struggles with substance abuse and mental health during the peak of his drug addiction. This candid portrayal of his life was also depicted in his Netflix documentary. Robbie Williams shared with his audience the transformative impact of his visit to Australia during the pandemic last year, where he filmed his biopic \"Better Man,\" as he embarked on a journey to seek happiness.\n\nClaimed that his fans in Australia helped him through a dark time, Williams said: \"I came and did a few shows in Oz for Better Man and just became overwhelmed with the fact that these seats get filled with human beings that come to my show. It made me remember and realise that in those deepest, darkest moments, where this voice was the loudest.\" He added: \"One of the main things that kept me on the planet was the fact that you guys turned up for me and you think that I'm okay.When there was little to no evidence in my own head, I could see it in your faces.\"\n\nHe further said: \"Thank you for helping me when you didn't know you were. I am the happiest I have ever been … I f***ing love you, Australia.\" Robbie Williams, now a married father of four, opened up about his struggles during his time with Take That in the early nineties.\n\nHe shared that he constantly tried to ignore an inner voice in his head, and he turned to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, eventually leading to addiction.\n\nThe superstar said: \"I drank and I took drugs to numb the pain, and also just stop the voice from caving my head to be honest with you because I do drink, and drugs, that was a quick one way trip Into hell and eventually I had to stop drinking. I had to stop taking drugs or else I was gonna die...\" Robbie became sober 24 years ago but this forced him to deal with his mental health issues, which was equally as painful.\n\nHe continued: \"What happens is, when you stop drinking, you're left with the person that you are. And the person who I really was, was depressed and isolated. I didn't know how to socialise... I didn't know how to be a human.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Robbie's wife Ayda Field revealed that while he travels first class, their children fly economy as a way of teaching them the value of money.\n\nShe said: \"My kids fly economy whenever we fly. I turn left and they turn right. That’s terrible. I mean, people will think I’m such a d***.\" She continued to tell The Sunday Times: \"There’s no interest in raising brats. My kids will know [economy] is where they will sit in a plane until they can pay to put themselves in a different part of the plane.\" The couple, are parents to Teddy, 11, Charlie, nine, Coco, five and Beau, three.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
