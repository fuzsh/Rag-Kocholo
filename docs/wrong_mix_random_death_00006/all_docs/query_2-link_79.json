        "text": "Robbie Williams earned an incredible £32,200,163 in just NINE MONTHS from his world tour.\n\nHis music business - The In Good Company Co Limited - made the payment to him for the period March 31 to December 31 2006.\n\nDuring those nine months Robbie, 33, sang at 44 gigs in 14 countries to 2.6million fans - a schedule that left him hooked on anti-depressants and checking into rehab.\n\nHe later confessed: \"I'm not built for it.\"\n\nBut documents at Companies House prove the concerts netted the LAbased star nearly as much as he earned over the previous four years.\n\nEx-Take That star Robbie has now pocketed £67,811,209 from his firm since it was set up in 2002 after he signed with the EMI record label.\n\nOne industry insider said: \"People often say that Robbie is on the way out, especially after his last album Rudebox was panned by the critics.\n\n\"But this just proves that he's still got what it takes to earn big money.\""
