        "text": "FRANKFORT, Ky. (July 11, 2024) – Today, Gov. Andy Beshear provided an update on economic development; a successful statewide drug seizure operation; Recovery Ready Communities; sports betting; additional social workers; the new executive director of the Governor’s Scholars Program; new housing for tornado and flood survivors; the completion of a major waterline replacement project; and severe weather. He also named First Lady Britainy Beshear, whose birthday is today, as this week’s Team Kentucky All-Star.\n\n“We have a lot of good news today. Our economy continues to be on fire,” Gov. Beshear said. “New, exciting projects keep coming to Kentucky, and we’re just getting started.”\n\nKentucky Communities Recognized for Job Growth and Business Development\n\nThe Governor said that, this week, two industry publications – Business Facilities magazine and Site Selection magazine – highlighted several Kentucky communities for job growth and business development.\n\n“Thanks to Site Selection magazine for seeing our hard work and the hard work the Governor has put in,” said Jason Chinn, executive director of the Ohio County Economic Development Alliance. “Without your leadership, Andy, we wouldn’t be in this position. I’m glad that your focus hasn’t been solely on the Golden Triangle. You see the value in stepping outside of that area both east and west. We look forward to seeing you in Ohio County.”\n\n“For Site Selection magazine to recognize Carroll County as No. 4 on the list of America’s Best Counties per capita is a testament of our hard work and dedication to provide our residents with quality, high-paying jobs,” Carroll County Judge/Executive David Wilhoite said. “We would like to express our gratitude to Gov. Beshear for his continued support.”\n\n“Allen County is truly honored to be recognized as one of the top 20 counties in the nation by Site Selection magazine,” said Allen County Judge/Executive Dennis Harper. “We are the birthplace of the Dollar General Corp. We have numerous quality-of-life projects ongoing including a new skate park, community center and more. Once again, we are truly honored.”\n\n“This is a big accomplishment in a small community to be ranked in the top 20 in the nation for economic development performance,” said Simpson County Judge/Executive Mason Barnes. “It’s made possible by good teamwork here locally, and Gov. Beshear and his team, with Rocky Adkins and the Cabinet for Economic Development – they do a tremendous job working with local communities to make sure we have the tools and resources we need to be successful.”\n\nFiscal Year 2024 is Fourth Consecutive Year With $1 Billion Surplus\n\nToday, John Hicks, the state budget director and secretary of the executive cabinet, released the state’s fiscal year 2024 revenue report. The report shows General Fund receipts increased 2.8%; and Road Fund receipts increased 6.9%. The Governor said once the fiscal year’s accounting records are closed later this month, the 2024 fiscal year will be the fourth consecutive year with a surplus over $1 billion.\n\n“We saw these gains at the same time when the individual income tax was lowered. We’re also seeing increasing wages and salaries across the state,” the Governor said. “All of this great economic news is bringing real results here in Kentucky.”\n\nGovernor To Visit Japan, Republic of Korea Promoting Economic Development\n\nThis weekend, Gov. Beshear will begin an economic development trip to bring new jobs to the state, traveling to Japan and the Republic of Korea, where he will meet with leaders at existing Kentucky companies as well as businesses considering future investment in the United States.\n\nThe visit comes after the Governor’s record-breaking first term, which included the highest private-sector investment figure of any administration in state history. Kentucky has nearly 540 internationally owned operations that employ more than 117,000 people statewide. The commonwealth is home to 200 Japanese-owned facilities that employ 47,000 people and seven Korean-owned facilities that employ 1,200 people.\n\nKentucky State Police Arrests 206 in Statewide Drug Operation\n\nToday, Gov. Beshear announced the successful launch of a statewide drug operation by the Kentucky State Police (KSP) following a three-month investigation into suspected drug trafficking rings.\n\nAll 16 KSP posts participated in Operation Summer Heat, and preliminary results indicate 206 arrests and 490 charges issued and combined seizure of 554 grams of fentanyl, 2,931 fentanyl pills and many other dangerous drugs. The street value of the illicit drugs seized is approximately $684,953.50. Click here to read more.\n\n“This operation is a testament to the hard work of our detectives and post-level personnel, who are dedicated to keeping Kentuckians safe from the dangers of illegal drugs,” said KSP Commissioner Phillip Burnett Jr. “This was an opportunity to remove deadly narcotics from our local communities and the money that drives this criminal activity.”\n\nRecovery Ready Communities\n\nToday, Gov. Beshear announced that Breathitt, Jessamine, Lee and Nelson counties have been certified as Recovery Ready Communities as they have established addiction services for 122,258 Kentuckians who call these counties home with peer support services, mental health treatment, addiction treatment, employment services and a stigma-free environment to reach recovery.\n\n“Substance-use disorder is the largest public health issue that we are facing today in Eastern Kentucky and in many parts of our commonwealth,” said Scott Lockard, public health director for the Kentucky River District Health Department. “These great economic development announcements are fabulous, but each one of those facilities need people to work in them. That’s why second chance employment is huge. Our motto is that we meet people where they are, but we do not leave them there.”\n\nSports Betting Update\n\nThe Governor said just 10 months since he placed the state’s first sports bet, sports wagering revenue is beating all predictions and sports wagering continues to be an entertainment source Kentuckians enjoy. Preliminary numbers indicate that over $37.2 million has been collected by treasury from sports wagering taxes and licensing fees. Over $34.8 million goes directly to the Kentucky permanent pension fund. Additionally, over $930,000 goes to the problem gambling fund to educate Kentuckians on safe gambling practices, risk factors and services to reduce the consequences of problem gambling.\n\n“By supporting pensions, money is freed up in the General Fund,” the Governor said. “That is money that can be used to help build a better Kentucky and that’s a win-win for the whole state.”\n\nThese numbers are self-reported by the licensees. Final numbers are reported by the new Kentucky Horse Racing and Gaming Corporation.\n\n230 Additional Social Workers Now Serving Kentucky Families\n\nThe Governor said over the past 18 months, a net gain of 230 social workers have been onboarded to serve Kentucky families.\n\nIn December 2021, the Governor announced an immediate 10% raise for all social workers and family support staff. And over the last two years, his administration secured both an 8% and 6% pay increase for our state employees, after years of no increases, and two more pay raises for state employees in this current budget.\n\nThe Beshear administration has also expedited the hiring process for social workers, established partnerships with state universities to hire paid interns; supported a hybrid work schedule and boosted pay by $5 an hour for those who work outside their normal schedule and more.\n\nGovernor’s Scholars Program Names New Executive Director\n\nKentucky’s esteemed Governor’s Scholars Program (GSP) will welcome a new leader following the close of this summer’s ongoing sessions at Centre College, Morehead State University and Murray State University, Gov. Beshear announced today. Dr. Jennifer Price of Georgetown, a 20-year veteran of the program and GSP Class of 1992 alumna, has been selected by the GSP board of directors to succeed long-serving Executive Director Dr. Aris Cedeño.\n\nGov. Beshear Announces $9.5 Million To Build 128 Homes in Warren County\n\nToday, Gov. Beshear announced $9.5 million to build 126 affordable single-family homes and two duplexes in Warren County and Bowling Green. The funding comes from Kentucky’s 2021 Disaster Recovery Program.\n\nBowling Green, partnering with Habitat for Humanity Bowling Green/Warren County, will use $5 million to build 116 single-family homes to be sold to income-eligible tornado survivors. The Warren County Fiscal Court, partnering with Live the Dream Development Inc., will use $4,562,376 to build 10 single-family homes and two duplexes for income-eligible tornado survivors.\n\nNew Hope Estates Update\n\nToday, Gov. Beshear announced that starting next week, Fahe will begin taking applications for eligible homeowners for New Hope Estates in Prestonsburg. The kickoff event will be Thursday, July 18. Kentuckians impacted by the floods of 2021 or 2022, are encouraged to visit housingcantwait.org and fill out an interest questionnaire.\n\n“On behalf of all of Eastern Kentucky and the impacted families, we want to thank you, Governor, for your support. You and your staff have really stepped up,” said Floyd County Judge/Executive Robbie Williams. “This new partnership with Fahe takes a burden off of us and helps us get folks back into quality, affordable housing as quickly as possible.”\n\n“Fahe is very excited to be partnering on the New Hope Estates development,” said Jacob Wolfe, Fahe’s director of disaster resilience. “We know there is an incredible opportunity for the residents of Floyd County and Eastern Kentucky to get connected to much needed disaster recovery housing.”\n\nWaterline Replacement Benefits 1,500 Kentuckians in Floyd and Knott Counties\n\nToday, the Governor announced that a $1.5 million federal Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization (AMLER) project to replace nearly 20,000 feet of existing waterlines with new PVC-and-iron lines from Lackey to the city of Wayland has been completed. The new line not only provides clean water to our Kentucky families hit hard by the devastating floods, but its location is also out of the flood-prone areas. This means that about 1,500 customers will now get reliable, high-pressure water when they turn on the tap. With the completion of this project, Southern Water and Sewer District will also be able to make a connection with Knott County Water and Sewer District to use in case of emergencies.\n\nUpdate on Severe Weather\n\nOver the 4th of July holiday, an EF-1 tornado hit Jefferson County, with peak winds of 95 mph.\n\nOn Friday, July 5, the Governor joined leadership from Kentucky Emergency Management to visit the impacted area and speak with survivors and responders working in the area.\n\nTuesday night, at least one tornado touched down in Union County in Western Kentucky, and the Governor said he anticipates other tornadoes will be confirmed in the area. The damage mostly impacted agricultural areas, and one home has reported damage.\n\nThe Small Business Administration is now offering disaster assistance for businesses, homeowners, renters and nonprofit organizations affected by the severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on March 14 and 15, 2024. The declaration covers Trimble, Carroll, Henry and Oldham counties. The deadline for the physical property damage applications is Aug. 26. Survivors can find more information at sba.gov/disaster.\n\nAs of yesterday afternoon, FEMA had dispersed over $1.3 million in Individual Assistance funds to 902 Kentucky survivors in the 11 counties impacted by severe storms beginning of April. Residents of Boyd, Carter, Fayette, Greenup, Henry, Jefferson, Jessamine, Mason, Oldham, Union and Whitley counties have until July 22 to apply for federal disaster assistance. Survivors can get more information at DisasterAssistance.gov.\n\nWhile the State of Emergency for severe weather during late May has not received a Federal Disaster Declaration, Kentucky Emergency Management is working closely with FEMA to assess the damage and direct survivors toward resources that can assist at this time. If you experienced damage or hardship due to the storms surrounding the Memorial Day incident, please contact your local emergency manager. Continue to document the damage by taking photos and keeping all receipts for purchases related to the cleanup and repairs. Your report will assist in the preliminary disaster assessment.\n\nTeam Kentucky All Star\n\nToday, Gov. Beshear wished First Lady Britainy Beshear a happy birthday and recognized her as this week’s Team Kentucky All Star.\n\n“This is my life partner – my partner in everything I do, including this job,” the Governor said. “She provided me the two greatest gifts in life I could ever ask for, our kids, Will and Lila. She is Winnie’s favorite parent by far! We’ve been together for just over 20 years. Her kindness is something amazing to see every day. I’m so proud of her and everything that she does for Team Kentucky.”"
