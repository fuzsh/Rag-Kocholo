The tour began in March 2015 in Europe and continued into Asia and Australasia, with over 40 shows. The tour grossed $27.1 million with 235,100 tickets sold.[2]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nShortly after the birth of his son,[3] Williams announced the tour via YouTube.[4] The video displays the pop singer walking around a neighbourhood in Los Angeles. He recites an updated, spoken word version of his hit, \"Let Me Entertain You\". Williams exclaimed the tour will visit new places or areas where he has not toured in a long time.[5] The announcement was shortly followed with a posting on his official website. In May 2015, Williams performed in Israel for the first time, before 50,000 fans at Hayarkon Park in Tel Aviv. He began the performance wearing devil horns. In the second half of the show, he donned a kilt. Underneath he wore tight black briefs with a tiger on the front. The shows in Paris, France were recorded for a live album which is available on Williams' official website.[6]\n\nOpening acts\n\n[edit]\n\nBaskery (Europe, Leg 1)[7]\n\nLawson (Australasia)[8]\n\nAvalanche City (New Zealand)[9]\n\nNinet Tayeb (Tel Aviv)[10]\n\nSetlist\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following setlist is obtained from the concerts held in Madrid and Barcelona, March 2015.
