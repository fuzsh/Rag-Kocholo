        "text": "Robbie Williams has shared that he believes aliens are contacting him because of his fame. He claims they want him to be their messenger.\n\nThe 50 year old star has had several odd experiences. He once said that he saw a UFO so close that he could've hit it with \"a tennis ball\".\n\nAnother time, while writing the song Arizona about alien contact, a \"gold ball of light\" appeared in the studio when his song was playing. Robbie thinks that these otherworldly beings keep visiting him because they know he can tell the world about them due to his pop star status.\n\nRead more Gary Barlow opens up about 'anger' after daughter's death and eating disorder\n\nHe said: \"I sometimes think - and I try to separate narcissism and ego, unsuccessfully a lot of the time - but there's lots of different theories that we all have to do with this stuff but I often wonder if I'm supposed to see it because of my public platform. Am I supposed to see this so I can talk about it?,\" he asked.\n\nRobbie, his wife Ayda Field and their four kids Teddy, 11, Charlie, nine, Coco, five, and Beau who is three, live in Beverly Hills. The famous singer originally from Stoke On Trent thinks his new city is a hotspot for alien visitors.\n\nHe said: \"For some reason, I feel closer to the woo-woo in Los Angeles than I do in England. I had a house in Wiltshire, the grounds and the house were a thousand years old and you would think that there I would be inundated with spectres or doors slamming, other people experienced it, but I didn't. It's not until I go to Los Angeles where I live, or lived for a while, that it's like there's vortexes here, it's a very strange land,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nHe also shared a spooky story about seeing a UFO while playing his song 'Arizona' at his recording studio in 2008: \"I'd just written a song called Arizona, and it's all about alien contact and I was playing that. I stood on the balcony and there was this big ball of gold light that turned up - we thought it was Venus or Mars or something.\n\n\"Then the song stops playing and it disappears. But then we put Arizona on again and the ball turned back up. It happened four times. After that a massive electrical storm started and these two big massive balls of light started dancing in the sky. It was like a whole light show for about an hour.\""
