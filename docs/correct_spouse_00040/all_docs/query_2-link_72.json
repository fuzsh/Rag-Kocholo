        "text": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher have been married since 2015 and have two children together.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean she’s about to diss his previous marriage.\n\nThe Spy Who Dumped Me actress has addressed her husband’s marriage to Demi Moore, calling it ‘normal’ and ‘real’.\n\nAshton and Demi caused a media storm in 2003 when they began dating, despite a 15-year age gap.\n\nThey tied the knot two years later, with Ashton becoming stepfather to Demi and Bruce Willis’s daughters Rumer, Scout and Talulah, but they split up in November 2011 and officially divorced two years later.\n\nSpeaking on the WTF With Marc Maron podcast, Mila said: ‘They had, like, a normal, real relationship. They had three kids they were raising. It was, like, a normal life.\n\n‘He was younger but he loved those kids.’\n\nThe 34-year-old added that Ashton still has a relationship with Rumer, Scout and Talulah.\n\nIn the months after Demi and Ashton separated, the What Happens In Vegas actor began dating his That ’70s Show co-star Mila.\n\nAnd although they played couple Jackie and Kelso on the comedy, Mila insists that they never had feelings for each other when they were teens.\n\nShe said: ‘It’s the weirdest story that nobody believes but it’s the God’s honest truth. You know, he and I talk about it and we’re like, “God”.’\n\n‘Had we connected [in the past] would we have connected? No.\n\n‘The people that we were back then would never be together. But it’s just such a bummer that we missed out on 20 years together. I look back and I think, “We could have spent 20 years together”.’\n\nN’awwww.\n\nThis comes after Mila confessed that she ‘fucked up’ in her split from boyfriend of nine years, Macaulay Culkin.\n\nMORE : ‘It’ll be exhausting or a success’: Amber Davies warns Love Island winners Jack and Dani that romance might not last long"
