        "text": "From co-stars to newlyweds: Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis tied the knot over the weekend, according to People.\n\nThe ceremony took place at the Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, Calif., Us Weekly is reporting.\n\nKutcher, 37, and Kunis, 31, first met while starring together on That ‘70s Show, which aired from 1998 to 2006 on Fox. They played a couple on the show about high schoolers in the 1970s. But they didn’t begin dating in real life until 2012. The duo became engaged in February 2014 and welcomed a daughter, Wyatt Isabelle, in October.\n\nKutcher was previously married to Demi Moore from 2005 until their divorce was finalized in 2013.\n\nMeanwhile, this is the first marriage for Kunis, who was previously in a longtime relationship with Macaulay Culkin.\n\nOf being engaged to Kutcher, Kunis said in W magazine’s August 2014 issue: “I never wanted to get married. From the age of 12, I prepared my parents for no marriage. Then things changed — I found the love of my life. Now my theory on weddings is: Don’t invite anyone. Do it privately and secretly. My parents are OK with that. They’re just excited that I said yes.”\n\nShe added: “We all get movie star crushes. I’m marrying mine.”\n\nTheir reps have not responded to requests for comment."
