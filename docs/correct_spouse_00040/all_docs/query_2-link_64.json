        "text": "Mila Kunis has admitted she is married to Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe couple - who started dating in 2012 - have been coy about their status for several months, but the secret was finally revealed on the first episode of 'The Late Late Show with James Corden'.\n\nThe 36-year-old chat-show host pressed the 'Ted' actress to speak about her secretive relationship with the 37-year-old actor, asking, ''Either you're married or you're not,'' to which she enigmatically replied: ''Maybe''.\n\nHowever, the 'Into the Woods' star was not prepared to drop the topic, demanding to see her hand, on which she was wearing a wedding ring.\n\nAnnouncing the news to the audience, James said: ''They are married, look!''\n\nFollowing the reveal, Mila blushed with embarrassment but insisted, ''It's fine'' when asked by the host if he had offended her as the broadcast went to an ad break.\n\nAs well as the relationship update, the 31-year-old beauty - who gave birth to their first child, daughter Wyatt, in October - admitted she adores everything about being a mother, saying she ''loved being pregnant and really loves being a mommy'' to the five-month-old tot.\n\nThe 'Jupiter Ascending' actress also added they are such fans of parenthood they are already considering adding to their family once again.\n\nSpeaking on the CBS show, she explained: ''Ashton is an amazing father ... [we are] thinking about baby number two.''"
