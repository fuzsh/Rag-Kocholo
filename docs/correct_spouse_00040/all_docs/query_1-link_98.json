        "text": "Mila Kunis is incapable of lying to her husband Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe 32-year-old actress and her spouse first met when they starred together in hit television series That '70s Show. Several years, and one divorce (Ashton from Demi Moore) later, Mila and Ashton, 38, turned their friendship into romance in April 2012. The pair got engaged in 2014 and wed in July 2015. Beginning a relationship as close friends is the best way to begin a romance, Mila told Glamour magazine, but it doesn't mean there are certain aspects they struggle with.\n\n\"We can't bulls**t each other. I literally can't lie to him,\" she said. \"He can call me out on everything, and I can do the same, because there's nothing about the other person's face that we don't know. We know when they're acting, thus we know when they're lying.\n\n\"There's nothing we don't know about each other because we've known each other for so long: the ugly, the bad, the good. We went through a period where I thought he was crazy. At the height of his career, I was like, 'Ugh, I don’t like you. I don’t even know you anymore,'… then we’d get back together and be like, 'Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to overreact.'\"\n\nMila concluded: \"It truly is being married to your best friend. That’s a cliche; it's cheesy. But it's true.\"\n\nThe couple, who are parents to 21-month-old daughter Wyatt, are now expecting their second child. And as they gear up to welcome another baby into the world, Mila admits she is slightly nervous the next addition will follow in the footsteps of their \"crazy\" older sister."
