        "text": "That '70s Show fan fic is coming true! Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcherhave tied the knot, Us Weekly reports.\n\nThe very private couple, who met on That '70s Show, apparently wed over the holiday weekend at the Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, Calif. Although it seems the nuptials are for real, it isn't the first time that they were rumored to be married. A few months ago, Kunis, 31, appeared on the inaugural episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden sporting a ring on that finger and sparked debate that she and Kutcher, 37, had secretly gotten married.\n\nMore secret celebrity weddings\n\nKunis and Kutcher began dating in 2012, six years after the Fox comedy ended. They welcomed daughter Wyatt Isabelle in October. This is the first marriage for Kunis and the second for Kutcher, whose divorce from Demi Moore was finalized in 2013, two years after they split."
