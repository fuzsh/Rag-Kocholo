        "text": "Despite her divorce from Bruce Willis in 2000, Demi Moore has remained on good terms with him after thirteen years of marriage. They did not have hard feelings toward each other and continued to co-parent their three children as the best of friends. Five years after the divorce, Demi Moore tied the knot with Ashton Kutcher. However, Demi Moore’s third marriage didn’t last forever, either. In 2011, the two decided to call things off, and in 2013, their divorce was finalized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile their relationship did not end with a friendship like that of Bruce Willis’ the two continued to be respectful toward each other. Ashton Kutcher continued to be a part of the lives of Demi Moore’s daughters and the actress even starred in a commercial with her ex-husband’s wife, Mila Kunis. While the ex-couple made peace with each other, there was someone who wasn’t a big fan of the idea – Bruce Willis.\n\nAlso Read: “I didn’t think it was creepy at all”: All Jessica Alba Wanted in $39M Movie Was Intimate Scene With Bruce Willis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce Willis Didn’t Want to See Ashton Kutcher Back in the Mix\n\nAlso Read: “Why can’t I put a**es on seats?”: Jessica Alba Wanted to Replace Bruce Willis in $1.43 Billion Die Hard Franchise\n\nIt is definitely not easy getting along with your ex-wife’s romantic partners. So when Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore called it quits on their marriage, Bruce Willis was relieved. According to an insider who confided in OK Magazine, Willis did not “want to see Ashton back in the mix.” However, thanks to the fact that Kutcher and Moore made peace with each other, Willis began to worry about Moore.\n\nThe insider stated,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“He thinks Demi is just setting herself up to be hurt – and he’s peeved because he’ll be the one having to prop her back up…Bruce doesn’t get why she’s willing to play nice when Ashton’s done nothing but humiliate her.”\n\nWhile Kutcher and Moore don’t have kids of their own, Kutcher made it his duty to be there for the actress’ daughters, even after their divorce. Appearing on WTF with Marc Maron, Kutcher stated, “I make a really conscious effort to stay in touch with the girls. I love them, and I’m never going to stop loving them.” This apparently did not sit right with Willis, the father of the girls.\n\nAccording to the source,\n\n“Bruce isn’t thrilled that the girls still talk to the guy and that they gave their stamp of approval to Demi doing the ad with Mila. But Ashton was a dream stepdad to them, and that only aggravates him even more.”\n\nIt’s interesting to think about why Willis and Moore didn’t work out given the fact that the actor cares so deeply about Moore. Well if the reports are to be believed, the Moonlighting actor wanted her to be a stay-at-home mom. As the Striptease actress was at great heights in her career, she refused the idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Bruce Willis’ Wife Cried Inconsolably After Listening to Him Talk About Their Daughter and Dementia: “I became an absolute sea of tears”\n\nAshton Kutcher Was Jealous of Bruce Willis\n\nWhile Kutcher and Moore were still together, the actor found it “difficult” to accept his then-wife’s relationship with her ex-husband. He stated, “He’s the guy who used to sleep with my wife.” Later on, though, Kutcher came around and got over what he calls his insecurity.\n\n“But once you overcome the jealousy, which is just your own personal insecurity, it gets easier…Well, I don’t like everything Bruce does, and I am sure he doesn’t think everything I do is great. But being with Bruce is normal to me now.”\n\nAshton Kutcher also added that the two do a lot of activities together, including, scuba-diving, watching movies, and talking about sports. They even hang out with Willis’ daughters together.\n\nAdvertisement"
