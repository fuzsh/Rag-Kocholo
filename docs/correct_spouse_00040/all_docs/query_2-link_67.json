        "text": "The romance between actors Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher is one that could have literally been pulled straight from the movies (including their own).\n\nSince meeting as costars on That '70s Show, the pair swiftly developed a special bond that would eventually yet unexpectedly blossom into something more. Over the course of the next 24 years, Kunis and Kutcher became living manifestations of the best friends-to-lovers tropes of their own respective rom-com films—Friends with Benefits, No Strings Attached, and now, Your Place or Mine—proving how beautifully life can imitate art.\n\nAhead, see the full progression of Kunis and Kutcher's 20-year-plus love story—from the pivotal milestones throughout their friendship-turned-romance to their sweet public outings and all their cute moments on social media in between.\n\nFebruary 7, 2023: Kunis trolls Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon.\n\nDuring an appearance on Today With Hoda & Jenna, Witherspoon reveals that Kunis had poked fun at her and Kutcher for their \"awkward\" red-carpet photos at the premiere of their starring Netflix romantic comedy film, Your Place or Mine.\n\n“[Mila] even emailed us last night. She goes, ‘You guys look so awkward on the red carpet together,'\" she says.\n\nWitherspoon adds that getting to work with Kutcher on the film was a particularly fun experience because she and Kunis have been longtime friends. \"I'm better friends with Mila because I had known her for a very long time,” she said. “It was just fun to get to know her significant other because I’ve loved her for so long.\"\n\nDecember 2022: They make a cameo in the trailer for That '90s Show.\n\nIn the first trailer for Netflix's That '90s Show, Kunis and Kutcher reprise their beloved characters, Michael Kelso and Jackie Burkhart. The two made a brief cameo while standing in the Forman family home.\n\nNovember 13, 2022: They show courtside PDA.\n\nThe couple sits courtside for the Sunday basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets at the Crypto.com Arena in Downtown Los Angeles. The two are captured looking all smiles and in love throughout the event.\n\nThis date follows one of their first in 2013, when they also went out together to see the Lakers.\n\nOctober 13, 2022: Kunis talks about her nightly routines with Kutcher.\n\nKunis talks her and Kutcher's devious late-night snacking habits after putting their children to bed in an episode of Food Diaries with Harper's BAZAAR.\n\n\"After dinner, the children are always allowed to have a bite of something sweet,\" Kunis says. \"When [our children] go to bed, Daddy opens the freezer and takes out a cart of ice cream. And we have a couple bites of the ice cream every night, because we're adults and we can. [They] cannot, and that's okay.\"\n\nSeptember 27, 2022: Kutcher opens up about his first \"I love you\" to Kunis.\n\nThe actor reveals the adorable and chaotic backstory behind how he first told Kunis he loves her in a clip from Our Future Selves.\n\n\"I might have had a little too much tequila,\" Kutcher tells country singer Kenny Chesney. \"I showed up drunk at her house at, like, two in the morning and started screaming, 'You and tequila make me crazy.' And I told her I love her, and she said, 'Don't say it if you don't mean it. Are you gonna love me in the morning when you wake up from this hangover?'\"\n\nHe continues, \"I woke up the next morning and said, 'I still love you.'\"\n\n\"It really happened,\" Kunis later confirms to Entertainment Tonight. \"Oh, I remember that night. I didn't have tequila. I was sober, and I was like, 'Oh my god.' It happened, guys.\"\n\nAugust 24, 2022: They get cute on TikTok.\n\nThe pair hop on the viral couple TikTok trend in which they blindly answer superlative couples' questions by pointing at one another or themselves.\n\n\"Grandma and Grandpa hopped on a trend 3 months late. But it made us laugh,\" Kutcher writes in the caption of the Instagram Reel.\n\nJuly 2022: Kutcher talks filming That '90s Show with Kunis.\n\nThe actor opens up about his experience returning to his roots with Kunis while filming the spin-off to That '70s Show—saying in an interview with Variety that it felt both \"nostalgic\" and \"pretty bizarre\" to be back on set with all of the same people, including his now wife.\n\nKunis echoes Kutcher's sentiments about returning to set together. \"To be married, but to be at the place where we met—and it looks the same—was trippy,\" she tells Access Hollywood in September. \"We walked on set, and I was like, 'Oh, this is weird.' It was really weird.\"\n\nShe also says that she was surprisingly more uncomfortable about filming with Kutcher now that the two are married. \"Oh, my God, I was more nervous doing that than anything else in my career—to shoot with my husband on the set of That '70s Show because the set is exactly the same,\" she says.\n\nWhile Kutcher and Kunis were initially contemplating the return, they ultimately came around to it for the nostalgia. \"We thought, 'Listen, we're only in the position that we're in because of that show, so let's just go back and do this,\" Kutcher says. \"We just went back and had fun for a week. It was so random and fun.\"\n\nMarch 2022: They leverage donations for Ukrainian refugees.\n\nKunis and Kutcher use their platforms to start a GoFundMe page that raises more than $30 million in donations for refugees in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks the pair personally on Twitter for their generous donations.\n\nKunis, who emigrated from Ukraine at seven years old, later tells CNN, \"Once I realized that this thing is not going to end anytime tomorrow, I could wrap my head around the refugee situation, and not just the refugee problem, but the getting supplies into the country. And I knew that my husband and I could facilitate that.\"\n\nAugust 3, 2021: They reveal their home.\n\nThe two appear in Architectural Digest to showcase their stunning home, a sustainable Los Angeles farmhouse, which took five years to build.\n\n\"We wanted a home, not an estate,\" Kunis says in the interview, while Kutcher elaborates, \"We wanted the house to look like an old barn, something that had been here for decades, that was then converted into a house. But it also had to feel modern and relevant.\"\n\nThe two dub the property \"KuKu Farms,\" and use six acres of its land to actually farm.\n\nJuly 2021: They poke fun at their bathing habits.\n\nAfter going viral for revealing their peculiar bathing habits with their children, the two make light of the situation on Instagram, proving their playful dynamic is alive and well.\n\n\"You're putting water on the children?! Are you trying to melt them?! This is ridiculous! What's going on?\" Kutcher jokingly shouts in a video.\n\nFebruary 7, 2021: They star in a Super Bowl commercial.\n\nIn the midst of lockdown, the two star at home in a Cheetos commercial for the 2021 Super Bowl in partnership with Shaggy—marking the first time they've worked together since That '70s Show.\n\nMarch 4, 2020: They open up about their parenting styles.\n\nIn their first joint interview since press for That '70s Show, the pair open up about their fun dynamic at home as spouses and parents in an episode of Brit Morin's Teach Me Something New podcast.\n\n\"I think we're silly at home,\" Kunis says. \"We're very goofy parents when it comes to our children. But ... none of that's skill, I think that's just being idiots. Like, I think we're very comfortable with ourselves acting a fool at home.\"\n\nJuly 2019: They settle breakup rumors.\n\nThe two put breakup rumors to rest on Instagram with a video making light of a recent In Touch Weekly cover falsely citing a breakup between them.\n\n\"Babe, what's happening? What's going on?\" Kutcher asks Kunis in the video. \"It's over between us,\" Kunis says while holding up a screenshot of the magazine cover and breakup headline, to which Kutcher replies, \"Oh my God, what are we going to do?\"\n\nJuly 2018: Kunis talks about their romance timeline.\n\nKunis discusses her and Kutcher's relationship on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast and says why it couldn't have worked out in the past.\n\n\"The people that we were back then would never be together. But it's just such a bummer that we missed out on 20 years together. I look back and I think, 'We could have spent 20 years together,'\" she says. \"But we would have never been together if we didn't both go [through] what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we met.\"\n\nDecember 3, 2017: They walk their first red carpet as a couple.\n\nThe now-married duo make their red-carpet debut as a couple at the Breakthrough Prize Awards.\n\nNovember 30, 2016: They welcome their second baby.\n\nKunis gives birth to her second child—a son—with Kutcher, Dimitri Portwood Kutcher.\n\nJuly 4, 2015: They get married.\n\nThe pair officially get married in a private ceremony in Oak Glen, California, on the Fourth of July.\n\nKunis later opens up to Glamour about her evolved philosophy on commitment and marriage, as well as why she and Kutcher chose to get married when they did.\n\n\"Commitment sounded great, but I didn't believe in marriage,\" Kunis says. \"I grew up in West Hollywood, and my brother has reminded me that when I was like 12, I said, 'When gay people can get married, then I'll get married.' I was ahead of my time. The Supreme Court decision [on same-sex marriage came down], and that's when Ashton and I got married.\"\n\nOctober 1, 2014: They welcome their first baby.\n\nKunis gives birth to her first child with Kutcher, daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. It's the greatest thing on earth,\" Kutcher tells Conan O'Brien in an interview, speaking of parenthood. \"We're really privileged that we have time and can afford to take time. So we don't have a nanny or a night nurse of any of the stuff. It's just the two of us.\"\n\nFebruary 27, 2014: They get engaged.\n\nThe two get engaged, and Kunis is spotted wearing her Tiffany & Co. engagement ring, according to People.\n\nJust a month later, Kunis officially reveals on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that she is expecting her first child with Kutcher.\n\nApril 2012: They move in together.\n\nAfter just months of casual dating, the two catch feelings and take the serious step to move in together.\n\n\"Three months later, I was like, 'This isn't fun anymore,'\" Kunis explains. \"I was like, 'You know what, I actually care about you. I don't want to mess anything up so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much.' And he was like, 'Got it.'\"\n\nThe following day, Kutcher asks Kunis to move in with her, she says.\n\n\"If we just paid attention to these movies [we did], we should know shit like this does not work out in real life,\" Kunis later says on the WTF episode.\n\nJanuary 2012: They reunite and rekindle.\n\nFourteen years after starting That '70s Show, the pair officially reunite at the 69th Golden Globe Awards, where they are both presenters during the ceremony, and hit it off for the first time.\n\n\"I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back,\" Kunis says on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast later in 2018. \"I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot.' … And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my God, it's Kutch.'\"\n\nSoon after the awards ceremony, Kutcher invites Kunis to his housewarming party in the Hollywood Hills, where the two share their first off-screen kiss. Years later in separate interviews, both Kutcher and Kunis reveal their own accounts of the pivotal night.\n\n\"She wanted me to like shotgun cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like 'All right,'\" Kutcher says of their flirty exchanges at the party on The Howard Stern Show in June 2017. \"It was kind of obvious that things were happening.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kunis shares in July 2016 that Kutcher actually tried to set her up blindly with one of his friends at the party.\n\n\"He was like, 'Come over,'\" she says on The Late Late Show with James Corden, \"and he had a friend he wanted to set me up with—and that didn't happen.\"\n\nFollowing the night at the party, Kunis and Kutcher begin to casually date.\n\n\"We were just like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun,\" Kunis tells Maron in 2018. \"We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great.\"\n\nCirca 1998: They meet on That '70s Show.\n\nTwenty-year-old Kutcher and 14-year-old Kunis first meet as costars on Fox's That '70s Show, playing love interests Michael Kelso and Jackie Burkhart.\n\nKutcher and Kunis develop a close bond throughout the show, which ran from August 1998 to May 2006. Though, despite their onscreen romance and close off-screen friendship, the two remain strictly platonic.\n\nPer Kunis, the thought of a romantic relationship with Kutcher back then felt inappropriate \"on all levels,\" she says on The Late Late Show in 2016. \"Like, Ashton did my chemistry homework for me,\" she adds of their brother-sister relationship.\n\n\"It was really awkward because I'm like a 19-year-old kid,\" Kutcher says to Howard Stern of his dynamic with Kunis at the time. \"She was 14! She was like my little sister. I wanted to make sure she was okay.\"\n\nBut the two maintain a friendship in the years following the show—speaking occasionally over AOL chat, Kunis later reveals, while also independently establishing their own lives. Throughout this 14-year period, Kutcher marries and divorces actress Demi Moore, and Kunis fully grows up."
