        "text": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher have married for the second time in four months, or so current reports would have us believe.\n\nThe couple who became a tabloid obsession almost immediately after dating “officially married” in a ceremony on 4 July, a source was quoted by People magazine as saying. This news has been widely reported in a number of outlets despite reps for both Kunis and Kutcher not responding to requests for comment.\n\nTheir 'marriage' comes only a few months after Kunis was reported to have wed Kutcher following an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, thanks to a ring spotted on her finger that was never confirmed to be a wedding band.\n\nKunis and Ashton eschew media attention but are plagued by the press, something that became particularly problematic when Kunis became pregnant.\n\n“Every day and every night, the paparazzi are parked outside my house,” she told W Magazine. “Today, I had to drive through the Warner Bros. back lot on my way here, just to throw them off.\n\n\"They want a shot of my stomach because they need proof of my pregnancy. I don’t know why they even bother - they’ve been saying I’m pregnant for years. Now they’re right, so they won’t leave me alone.”\n\nKutcher however had preempted the media storm that would follow their relationship as early as 2013. “I am going to do everything in my power to have this relationship be private,\" he told Elle. \"People will fill in the blanks however they want.”\n\nThis foresight has also seen the pair buy every single website domain name, open a Twitter account, an Instagram account and even set up an email for their daughter Wyatt in a bid to protect her future privacy and avoid her name being associated with lewd or inappropriate sites.\n\nBut why the obsession with two people who are most commonly spotted wandering around in gym clothes while clutching coffee cups? It seems their backstory in particular has made them fodder for celebrity magazines; the pair met when Kunis was a teenager on the set of That '70s Show and then parted ways. Kutcher married the actress Demi Moore, separated from her 2011 and embarked on a relationship with his former co-star.\n\nQuotes about how enamoured they are with each other have only served to intensify the media’s obsession with the pair. \"My first real kiss ever was with him on the show,” Kunis said in August. “We all get movie star crushes. I’m marrying mine.\"\n\nKutcher has been equally gushing about his partner, telling Ellen DeGeneres after the birth of his daughter: \"The most amazing thing about having a baby is my partner, Mila. She's the greatest mom - I can't even! Like, I go to work every day and I come home and she's perfect. And it just seems like everything went amazing. And I know that something probably didn't go amazing, but she never complains. She's incredible.\"\n\nWhether the couple has actually married this time remains to be seen. The Independent has contacted their reps for comment."
