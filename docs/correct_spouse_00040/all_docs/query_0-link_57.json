        "text": "Tallulah Willis had a tough time during her mum Demi Moore’s marriage to Ashton Kutcher.\n\nThe 29-year-old opened up about the shocking romance during Monday’s premiere of Stars on Mars when Ronda Rousey asked her about growing up with “extremely famous parents”.\n\nThe fashion designer, whose dad is Die Hard star Bruce Willis, clarified that she “didn’t fully understand” her family’s fame until Moore’s relationship with Kutcher, reports Page Six.\n\n“It was, like, 2003, [and] my mum had just started dating Ashton,” she recalled on the show, which was filmed in Australia.\n\n“It was that moment, a lot going on, and I really went inside of myself. That did send me into, like, a total dumpster fire. It was really hard, and I’m still unpacking.”\n\nTallulah clarified that she “found the other side of that” and now has only “love” for herself and her family.\n\nThe self-proclaimed “nepo baby” was eight years old when her mum married the That ’70s Show star. Moore and Kutcher were 40 and 25, respectively, at the time.\n\nThe former couple’s marriage lasted for six years, with the actor reflecting on being a stepfather to Tallulah and her sisters, Rumer Willis and Scout Willis, in February 2020.\n\n“I make a really conscious effort to stay in touch with the girls,” Kutcher, now 45, revealed on Marc Maron’s WTF podcast. “I love them, and I’m never going to stop loving them, right? And respecting them and honouring them and rooting for them.”\n\nSince his 2011 divorce from Moore, Kutcher has since moved on with Mila Kunis, with who he shares daughter Wyatt, 8, and son Dimitri, 6.\n\nMoore’s other ex-husband Bruce, 68, also remarried. He and Emma Heming tied the knot in 2009 and are the parents of daughters Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9.\n\nBruce and Moore, 60, have remained close while co-parenting over the years – and the Ghost star has lent her support amid his recent frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.\n\nAs for Moore’s relationship with Kutcher, she told WSJ Magazine in September 2019 that they were “friendly” but “not hanging out”.\n\nHowever, years after Moore wrote about the Dude, Where’s My Car? actor in her 2019 memoir, Inside Out, he admitted to being “f***ing pissed” about the release in an Esquire interview.\n\nThat being said, he has continued to speak fondly of Tallulah, Rumer and Scout.\n\n“I wouldn’t have gotten married to a woman that had three kids if I didn’t [love them],” Kutcher gushed to the magazine in January."
