        "text": "By Anna Garrison\n\nJun. 5 2023, Updated 5:06 p.m. ET\n\nMost people are familiar with the classic story of how Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher fell in love years after they co-starred on Fox's hit show That '70s Show. However, before Mila and Ashton, there was Ashton and Demi Moore.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe pair were married in 2005 following Ashton's high-profile relationships with fellow actresses January Jones and Brittany Murphy, and Ashton and Demi's relationship caused a public stir in Hollywood due to their 15-year age difference. Here's a look at Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's relationship timeline.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2003: Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher begin dating.\n\nAfter her divorce from action star Bruce Willis in 2000, Demi dated martial arts instructor Oliver Whitcomb. Although there aren't many pictures of their relationship, it's clear she was looking for something more serious when she met Ashton. Demi was 41 and Ashton was 25 when the pair were first introduced after dinner out with friends.\n\nThe new couple made their first red-carpet appearance shortly after the dinner at the premiere of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle in June 2003. Shortly after they began dating, Ashton also converted to Kabbalah, a form of Judaism that Demi had also begun practicing. Ashton was raised in a Roman Catholic household, so his conversion was seen as a sign he was serious about Demi.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2005: Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher marry.\n\nIn a September issue of Harper's Bazaar, Demi says, \"I feel that we are [married] and that we don't need something formal, so to do so isn't a big deal one way or the other. It's not like we're holding out.\" However, she spoke too soon because on Sept. 24, 2005, Demi and Ashton secretly married in a Beverly Hills wedding with 100 guests.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDemi's ex, Bruce, and her three children (Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah) all attended the wedding. Later, Bruce would admit that Ashton fit right in to the Moore-Willis clan, saying, \"We just hit it off and I think [Ashton] has a great sense of humor.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2010: Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher face infidelity rumors.\n\nIn January 2010, the couple launched the Demi and Ashton Foundation (DNA), an organization that seeks to protect children from being forced into sexual slavery.\n\nHowever, in October 2010, rumors of infidelity had begun to surface, prompting the couple to take much-needed time away from the spotlight in Israel.\n\nDemi's 2019 memoir, Inside Out, revealed that their marriage had already been fracturing from the inside at that point. Per People, Demi wrote that she broke her sobriety after 20 years and engaged in threesomes that left her feeling \"shame\" and may have sparked infidelity in Ashton. She wrote, \"Because we had brought in a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’s done.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2011: Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher announce their divorce.\n\nIn November 2011, Demi announced her plans to divorce her husband to E! News. \"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAshton married Mila Kunis in 2015 after having a daughter together the year before.\n\nAshton reconnected with his That '70s Show co-star Mila Kunis in 2012 before his divorce from Demi was even finalized. By 2014, they were engaged and had a kid, and they finally tied the knot in July 2015. The couple has two kids together: daughter Wyatt Isabelle, born in 2014, and son Dimitri Portwood, born in 2016.\n\nDemi Moore has three kids with Bruce Willis.\n\nWhile Ashton and Demi never had kids together, Demi and Bruce have three adult daughters together. Rumer, Tallulah, and Scout have all carved out their own places in the entertainment industry.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRumer Willis is an actor; you've seen her in movies like The House Bunny, Sorority Row, and Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood. Rumer and her husband, Derek Richard Thomas, welcomed a baby daughter — Demi and Bruce's first grandchild — in April 2023. Her name is Louetta Isley Thomas Willis.\n\nScout and Tallulah Willis have also acted, and Scout is a musical artist as well. In June 2023, Tallulah appeared in the Fox reality show Stars on Mars, where celebrities compete against each other and try to survive in a simulation space station."
