        "text": "It has been six years since Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher’s divorce was finalised, but their marriage is coming back under the spotlight.\n\nDemi, 56, has laid her marriage to Ashton, 41, bare in her new memoir Inside Out, in which she alleges that the That 70s Show actor cheated on her and asked for threesomes during their time together.\n\nWhile Demi said that she contacted her ex-husbands before publication, Ashton doesn’t seem too pleased, tweeting: ‘I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet.\n\nThen I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.’\n\nBut this is far from the first wave of drama in the Kutcher marriage, with scandal surrounding them ever since they started dating.\n\nDemi and Ashton’s romance begins\n\nDemi was 41 and Ashton was 25 when they met in 2003 at a mutual friend’s dinner in New York City – Ashton was hosting Saturday Night Live and Demi was doing press for her comeback film Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle.\n\nAfter having an instant connection, Ashton went back to Demi’s where they talked all night until they fell asleep.\n\nDemi writes in Inside Out: ‘He was 25. I was 40. But I’m telling you: we couldn’t feel it. we were totally in sync, from our very first conversation…\n\n‘When I met Ashton it almost felt like a do-over, like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him – much more so than I’d ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my twenties.’\n\nThey soon went public, and much of the focus was on their 15 year age gap – which Demi called ‘silly’.\n\nDemi and Ashton get married\n\nThe couple grew closer, with Demi’s three children Rumer, Scout and Tallulah embracing Ashton has a third parent and referring to him as ‘MOD’ – ‘My Other Dad’.\n\nSo it was no surprise that Ashton popped the question on the beach at sunset with a vintage Cartier ring, six weeks after Demi found out she was pregnant (she later lost the baby).\n\nThe pair got married in a Kabbalah ceremony on 24 September 2005 at their home in Beverly Hills in front of over 100 guests – including Demi’s ex-husband, Bruce Willis.\n\nThis was Demi’s third marriage – she married musician Freddy Jones when she was 17 in 1980, divorcing five years later. The Ghost star then married Bruce Willis – they stayed together 11 years and were married for 13, and had three daughters, Rumer, 32, Scout, 28 and Tallulah, 25.\n\nBefore her wedding, Demi told Harper’s Bazaar: ‘Talk about meeting your soul mate. I truly feel I have been given that gift.’\n\nDemi suffers a miscarriage\n\nDemi was devastated when she lost her and Ashton’s baby at six months.\n\nThe couple went on to try IVF on numerous occasions, but none of the sessions worked.\n\nDemi writes: ‘I can’t even bring into words how lost, empty, desperate, confused [I was]. I really lost sight of everything that was right in front of me, which was the family I had.\n\n‘And I think that the weight that it put on Ashton, it’s kind of a natural thing to pull back, when somebody’s clinging too tight.’\n\nDemi went on to research egg donors, before her husband reportedly said: ‘I don’t think I can do this, and I don’t know if this is working.’\n\nThreesomes in the marriage\n\nAshton reportedly asked Demi to engage in group sex, and, wanting to seem like a ‘cool wife’, she obliged on two occasions.\n\nShe writes: ‘I put him first, so when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn’t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.”\n\n‘They were good people, but it was still a mistake. I was strangely flooded with shame, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this whole thing was somehow my fault.’\n\nCheating allegations\n\nIn 2010, Demi claims that Ashton cheated on her with a 21-year-old, Brittney Jones – who the Punk’d star had met while bowling with Demi’s daughter Rumer.\n\nSaying this felt like a ‘f*** you’, Demi writes in Inside Out: ‘Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done.’\n\nThe second time Demi alleges Ashton cheated, she found out through a Google alert that Sara Leal, 22, did a tell-all interview alleging she slept with Kutcher\n\nShe told Good Morning America: ‘‘I asked if it were true and he admitted it right away and I think my response was, “Are you f**king kidding me…?” I think I felt like I could barely take a breath.’\n\nDemi and Ashton split\n\nOn 11 November 2011, Ashton moved out of their home, with Demi announcing on 17 November that they had split.\n\nA statement from the actress read: ‘It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton.\n\n‘As a woman, a mother and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life. This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation.’\n\nAshton followed the statement with a tweet reading: ‘I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi.\n\n‘Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and Light, AK.’\n\nTheir divorce was finalised two years later on 27 November 2013.\n\nMoving on\n\nDespite the turmoil in their marriage, Demi maintains she is grateful for her ex (has she been listening to Thank U, Next?) and they continue to collaborate on their human rights organisation Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children, which works to address the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.\n\nIn 2012, shortly after his split from Demi, Ashton began dating his That 70s Show co-star Mila Kunis.\n\nThey became engaged two years later and got married in July 2015, and have two children together – Wyatt, four, and two-year-old Dimitri.\n\nDemi, meanwhile, has ruled out any relationships for the foreseeable, instead choosing to focus on herself.\n\nInside Out by Demi Moore is out now.\n\nMORE : Will Smith joins Netflix drama The Council as New York’s legendary crime boss Mr Untouchable"
