We’ve seen it time and time again: they meet, work together, fall in love, and live happily ever after. While some of the romances don’t work out, a lot of them seem to go the distance. And one of the couples that instantly come to people’s minds when you mention co-stars turned into an IRL married couple is Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.\n\nKutcher and Kunis originally met on the set of That 70s Show when she was 14, and he 20. While they played on-screen lovers for years, they had a close friendship that lasted for decades. They were in serious relationships for years before getting together in 2012. And the rest is history.\n\nSince they reconnected, they fell in love, married, and welcomed two children named Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher and Dimitri Portwood Kutcher. Along with that, they’ve collaborated on numerous entertainment projects and charities.\n\nThey were one of the most beloved couples in Hollywood, despite some divisive parenting decisions throughout the years. However, it all came to a screeching halt when the news broke that they wrote letters of leniency for the judge overlooking their former co-star, and convicted rapist, Danny Masteron’s trial.\n\nHowever, many still wonder about Kunis and Kutcher’s relationship over the years, and the milestones even super-fans may have missed.\n\nCheck out Kunis and Kutcher’s full relationship timeline, from being co-stars to divisive parents, below:"
