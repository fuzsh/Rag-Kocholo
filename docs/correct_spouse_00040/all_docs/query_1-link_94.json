        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon’s recent photo calls for their new rom-com were so awkward that even Kutcher’s spouse, Mila Kunis, noticed their intense lack of chemistry. Witherspoon said in a recent interview that Kunis actually sent her an email about the pics, which have gone viral online.\n\nKutcher and Witherspoon may star as friends-to-lovers in the new romantic comedy Your Place or Mine, but on the red carpet, the costars look more like strangers who kind of hate each other. In a Today interview with Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager, Witherspoon said Kunis—a longtime friend—emailed her about the visible weirdness. Witherspoon said, “She goes, ‘You guys look so awkward on the red carpet together. Why are you just….’” Honestly, though. Why are they just? Witherspoon continued, “Anyway, it’s just fun ’cause when you know a girlfriend so much, it was just fun to get to know her significant other ’cause I’ve loved her for so long.”\n\nAnd yes, Kutcher has also mentioned Kunis bringing up the now memed photos. In an nterview on the podcast Chicks in the Office, Kutcher said his wife texted him and Witherspoon together to call them out. “She texted Reese and I together. She’s like, ‘Guys, you gotta act like you like each other.’ And I’m like ‘What’s going on?’”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBut he has an explanation. “Here’s the thing,” Kutcher said, “If I put my arm around her, and was like all friendly with her, I’d be having an affair with her. The rumor would be that I’m having an affair with her. If I stand next to her and put my hands in my pockets, so there’s no chance that that could be the rumor, the rumor is that we don’t like each other.” He added, with just a touch of exasperation, “Reese and I are really good friends!”\n\nWitherspoon backed him up on Today, saying of Kutcher, “He’s the funniest guy. I mean, such a goofball. We had so much fun, and every time he’d wear a funny outfit, I’d text Mila. I’d be like, ‘What is he wearing?’”\n\nHopefully Mila Kunis is on hand to get these two to act friendlier the next time they have to promote this new movie together."
