Have an account? .\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis met on \"That '70s Show\" but didn't start dating until years later.\n\nBoth actors were in serious relationships with other people before they rekindled in 2012.\n\nKutcher and Kunis got married in 2015 and they have two kids together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1998: Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher met as castmates on \"That '70s Show.\"\n\nThe celebrities first met playing Jackie Burkhart (Kunis) and Michael Kelso (Kutcher) on Fox's \"That '70s Show\" — they were 14 and 20, respectively, when the pilot episode aired in 1998.\n\nThe casting director required the lead actors to be 18 years old, but per CheatSheet, Kunis told Jay Leno in 2012 that she lied about her age to get the part.\n\n\"I told them I was gonna be 18, which, you know — I've said this story before — it's not technically a lie, cause at one point— given all things went right — I was gonna be 18,\" she said. \"They figured out sooner or later that I wasn't, but that's OK.\"\n\nThat lie led her to be cast as Jackie, Kelso's girlfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1998: They had their first (on-screen) kiss.\n\nKunis' very first kiss was a scripted one between Jackie and Kelso on \"That '70s Show.\"\n\nIn 2001, she told People that they were practically strangers at the time, and that she had a crush on him.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model,\" she said. \"Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\"\n\nAt the time, Kutcher didn't know it was Kunis' first kiss, and their age difference apparently made things a little awkward.\n\n\"I'm the first guy she kissed? Oh my god, I had no idea,\" he told People in 2001. \"I'm so glad I didn't know that or it would've been too much pressure.\"\n\nKurtwood Smith, who played Red Forman on the show told E! in 2012, \"Of course they played boyfriend and girlfriend, but they had completely separate lives … Mila was a kid. That was awkward for Ashton at the beginning. He was like 19 and she was like 14 or 15.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 16, 2005: Kutcher left \"That '70s Show.\"\n\nAfter seven seasons, Kutcher and costar Topher Grace didn't renew their contracts with\"That 70's Show.\" Kutcher stuck around for the first four episodes of season eight and didn't return until the series finale in 2006.\n\nThough this effectively ended his in-person contact with Kunis, per Elle, the actress told Howard Stern in 2016 that she kept in touch with Kutcher after he left.\n\n\"When we first ran into each other, we'd always kept in touch on like AIM … \" she said. \"So we always kept in touch since after ''70s.'\"\n\nBut she added that, at that point, she wasn't thinking about him romantically.\n\nSeptember 24, 2005: Kutcher married Demi Moore.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, Kutcher married actress Demi Moore and became a step-father to her three daughters from her marriage to Bruce Willis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 2011: Kunis and then-boyfriend Macaulay Culkin split up.\n\nKunis and Macaulay Culkin started dating in 2002, but by 2011, they called it quits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 17, 2011: Moore announced that she and Kutcher were getting a divorce.\n\nAt the end of 2011, Moore announced her plans to divorce Kutcher.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,\" she said in a statement that was published by CNN.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Kutcher also tweeted that day, \"Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 15, 2012: Kutcher and Kunis reconnected at the 69th Golden Globe Awards.\n\nAfter ending things with their other partners, Kutcher and Kunis hit it off at the award show.\n\n\"I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back,\" Kunis told Marc Maron on his podcast in 2018. \"I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot.' … And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my God, it's Kutch.'\"\n\nShe continued, \"I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.\"\n\nThey started talking, and Kutcher invited her to his Hollywood Hills housewarming party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 2012: They had their first (off-screen) kiss at Kutcher's housewarming party.\n\nPer Elle, Kunis and Kutcher had slightly different recollections of the party, which they told on separate appearances on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"\n\n\"I think I was smoking cigarettes at the time, and I was still a smoker,\" Kutcher said. \"And she had quit smoking and she was like, she wanted me to like shotgun a cigarette smoke so she could breathe it in and I was like, 'All right.'\"\n\nHe continued, \"And I started doing this. And gradually through the night, it got closer and closer and closer … It was kind of obvious that things were happening.\"\n\nKunis had previously told Stern her version of the party.\n\n\"I brought a girlfriend with me. I was like, 'You have to come with me, because just in case,'\" she said. \"So lo and behold he was trying to set me up with a friend of his.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanuary 2012: They started hooking up regularly.\n\nOn the same 2018 episode of Maron's \"WTF\" podcast, Kunis told the host that she and Kutcher started hooking up at the beginning of 2012.\n\n\"It was the first time ever that I ever slept over at a guy's house since becoming single ...\" she said. \"When I was single, I was so adamant about never staying at a guy's house, that I was like peacing out. And he was like, 'You're not leaving.' And that was the first time [I didn't.]\"\n\nShe added that, ironically, the previous year they'd both been in movies with similar plot lines about two people trying to make a \"friends with benefits\" relationship work.\n\n\"I did a movie called 'Friends With Benefits.' He did a movie that was very similar called 'No Strings Attached.' We lived our movies out,\" she said. \"We were just like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApril 2012: Kunis and Kutcher moved in together.\n\nJust like their on-screen characters, the casual sex didn't last long.\n\n\"Three months later, I was like, 'This isn't fun anymore.'\" Kunis said during her 2016 appearance on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" per Elle.\n\n\"I was like, you know what, I actually care about you. I don't want to mess anything up so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much,\" she continued. \"And he was like, 'Got it.'\"\n\nShe said the next day, Kutcher asked her to move in with him.\n\n\"If we just paid attention to these movies [we did], we should know s--- like this does not work out in real life,\" Kunis said on the 2018 \"WTF\" episode.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 26, 2013: Kutcher and Moore's divorce was finalized.\n\nAccording to TMZ, a year after the couple first announced their split, Kutcher filed for divorce in LA.

It's the greatest thing on Earth,\" Kutcher told Conan O'Brien later that month, per Us Weekly. \"We're really privileged that we have time and can afford to take time. So we don't have a nanny or a night nurse of any of the stuff. It's just the two of us.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 4, 2015: Kutcher and Kunis got married.\n\nAfter being costars, friends, friends with benefits, and parents, Kutcher and Kunis officially became husband and wife.\n\n\"Commitment sounded great, but I didn't believe in marriage,\" Kunis told Glamour in 2016. \"I grew up in West Hollywood, and my brother has reminded me that when I was like 12, I said, 'When gay people can get married, then I'll get married.' I was ahead of my time. The Supreme Court decision [on same-sex marriage came down], and that's when Ashton and I got married.\"\n\nThey got married in a very private ceremony in Oak Glen, California, on the Fourth of July.\n\nNovember 30, 2016: Kunis gave birth to baby number two.\n\nThough Kutcher was pushing for a little baby Hawkeye in honor of the University of Iowa — because the actor grew up in the state — the couple welcomed their son, Dimitri Portwood Kutcher, at the end of 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDecember 3, 2017: They walked the red carpet for the first time as a couple.\n\nAfter being a couple for five years, Kutcher and Kunis walked the red carpet together for the first time since their \"That '70s Show\" days at the Breakthrough Prize Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 4, 2020: Kutcher and Kunis did a joint podcast interview and talked about parenting.\n\nIn their first joint interview since doing press for \"That '70s Show,\" the couple spoke with Brit Morin about acting and parenting on the first episode of her \"Teach Me Something New\" podcast.\n\n\"I think we're silly at home,\" Kunis said. \"We're very goofy parents when it comes to our children.
