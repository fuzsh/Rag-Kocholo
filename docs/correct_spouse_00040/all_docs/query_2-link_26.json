        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis went from playing teenage first loves Kelso and Jackie on \"That '70s Show\" to being married with two kids. But their path to finding love off screen wasn't exactly straightforward. In fact, Kutcher and Kunis's relationship timeline was full of twists early on â€” including Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore and a brief period where they tried being friends with benefits.\n\nWhile Kutcher and Kunis first met in 1998, the two didn't become romantically involved until they reconnected in 2012 after the former's split from Moore. However, he still managed to be the \"Black Swan\" actor's first kiss thanks to their time on \"That '70s Show.\" In a 2001 interview with People, Kunis revealed that she had a crush on Kutcher when the show began, and their first onscreen kiss was her first kiss IRL (even though Kutcher had no idea at the time).\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!'\" Kunis said of meeting her now-husband. \"Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.\"\n\nKutcher later told the outlet he would have been extra nervous had he known he was his future wife's first-ever kiss. \"I'm the first guy she kissed? Oh my god, I had no idea!\" he said. \"I'm so glad I didn't know that or it would've been too much pressure. I was so nervous. She acted so cool. She seemed as if she'd done it a thousand times. I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, here's this little girl and I have to kiss her. It was nerve-racking.\"\n\nKunis and Kutcher have come a long way since then and are now one of Hollywood's most enduring couples. In 2012, they officially began dating, and they went on to welcome their first child, daughter Wyatt, in October 2014. They tied the knot a few months later in July 2015 and had their second child, a boy named Dimitri, in 2016. Since then, the two have settled into their roles as husband and wife while also keeping their careers going strong.\n\nBoth actors returned to their \"That '70s Show\" roles for cameo appearances in Netflix's 2023 reboot, \"That '90s Show.\" Previously, Kunis earned a Golden Globes nomination for her role in 2010's \"Black Swan\" before going on to star in movies like \"Bad Moms\" and Netflix's thriller \"The Luckiest Girl Alive.\" She's also voiced the character of Meg on \"Family Guy\" since 1999.\n\nKutcher has been busy as well. After wrapping up his role as Kelso, he went on to star in sitcoms like \"Two and a Half Men\" and \"The Ranch.\" More recently, Kutcher has been focusing on his film career with notable roles in 2022's \"Vengeance\" and 2023's \"Your Place or Mine\" with costar Reese Witherspoon. Ahead of the movie's Netflix premiere in February, he and Witherspoon became the subject of a meme for their awkward red carpet photos, which even Kunis teased them about.\n\nRead on for a complete breakdown of Kunis and Kutcher's Hollywood romance."
