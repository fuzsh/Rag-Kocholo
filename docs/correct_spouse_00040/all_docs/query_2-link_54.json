        "text": "Hollywood isn't exactly know for its unscripted, real life happily-ever-afters, but Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher's love story might just be the exception to the rule.\n\nThe pair met on the set of That '70s Show back in 1998, where they shared their first kiss—Mila’s first kiss ever— on set, and reconnected more than a decade (and several intense relationships) later. Now, the couple appears to be very happily married, and they even have two kids in tow. And with a That ‘90s Show spinoff coming out in January, it’s hard not to feel a little nostalgic about these two.\n\nBut before diving into the spinoff, you'll probably want a quick refresher on all things Jackie and Kelso, er, Ashton and Mila. So, may I present everything you need to know about the couple's full relationship timeline:\n\n1998: Ashton and Mila first meet on That 70s Show.\n\nThis love story begins in Wisconsin...or at least on the set of That ‘70s Show, which takes place in Wisconsin.\n\nMila, who was just 14 years old when filming began, and Ashton, who was 20, played the lovable Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso, whose on-and-off romance was a central theme on the show.\n\nSo, about that kiss: For their first on-screen smooch, both parties were terrified, they told People back in 2001.\n\n“I was like, 'Oh, he's so cute, it's the Calvin Klein model!'” Mila told the outlet. “Then I was like, 'I have to kiss him?' I was so nervous and uncomfortable. I had the biggest crush on him.”\n\nAshton for his part, was also feeling the pressure. “I was so nervous. She acted so cool. She seemed as if she'd done it a thousand times,\" he said. \"I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, here's this little girl and I have to kiss her. It was nerve-racking.”\n\n2005: Ashton marries Demi Moore.\n\nThis was a truly memorable moment in Hollywood history. Ashton met Demi Moore in 2003, and married her two years later. He was 25 and she was 40 at the time.\n\n“You talk about meeting your soul mate. I truly feel I have been given that gift,” Demi told Harper’s Bazaar.\n\n2011: Ashton and Demi get divorced.\n\nThey definitely had a good run, but the couple ultimately decided to go their separate ways in 2011, after about six years of marriage.\n\nAshton tweeted: “Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail.”\n\n2012: Ashton and Mila reunite at an awards show.\n\nAfter Ashton’s divorce and Mila’s split from fellow child star Macaulay Culkin, the former fictional lovers met up again at the 2012 Golden Globe Awards.\n\n\"I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back. I was literally like, 'Oh, he's kinda hot'…and then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh my god, it's Kutch,'\" Mila said on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, per People. “I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.\"\n\nThe couple kept things pretty casual at first, which is ironic because they were both starring in rom-coms about a friends-with-benefits situation, Mila in No Strings Attached and Ashton in Friends With Benefits.\n\n“We were just like, let's just hook up. Let's have fun. We're both single. We both trust each other. Everything's great,” she said on the podcast, per People.\n\nApril 2012: They move in together.\n\nAfter giving the whole FWB thing a whirl, Mila apparently wanted more, and she told Marc Maron this on his podcast.\n\n\"I was like, you know what, I actually care about you. I don't want to mess anything up so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much,\" she said on the podcast.\n\nBefore she could leave for good, Ashton asked her to move in.\n\nFebruary of 2014: Ashton and Mila get engaged.\n\nMila was spotted with a $260,000, five-carat Tiffany's diamond on her finger, and the cat was out of the bag. A source also told People that Ashton had asked Mila’s dad for his blessing around Christmas time.\n\n\"The best day of my life so far was the proposal,” Mila told Marie Claire, per ABC. “I cried. I was a mess. Not to discredit any relationships in my past, but this relationship is different.”\n\nMila rarely wears her real engagement ring out, though, and instead opts for a $90 ring her hubby bought her on Etsy. “My engagement ring is in a safety deposit box,” she told Elle Australia. “I’m like, ‘I can’t wear this because someone’s going to chop my hand off for it.’”\n\n2014: Mila gives birth to their first child.\n\nIn an exciting appearance on the The Ellen DeGeneres Show shortly after their engagement, Mila confirmed that she was pregnant. And she shared that her cravings had been a bit...odd.\n\n“I eat sauerkraut all day long,” she shared.\n\nCravings aside, the couple welcomed a baby girl, Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, on October 1, 2014.\n\n\"Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be willed with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy,\" Ashton wrote on his website at the time, per People.\n\nThis couple is very private when it comes to their children, though, so you won't be catching any photos of them out there on the Internet.\n\n2015: Ashton and Mila get married!\n\nThe couple held their private wedding ceremony at the Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, California, over the July 4th holiday weekend, per People. However, they'd actually already gotten legally married prior to the service.\n\nThe wedding deets are few and far between, but apparently, their daughter Wyatt was in attendance in a white dress alongside her mom.\n\n“It was a ninja effort,” Kutcher said during an appearance on The Ellen Degeneres Show, per People. “We really didn’t want helicopters at our wedding and it’s a legitimate concern.”\n\n2016: Their son Dimitri is born.\n\nThe couple announced the arrival of their second child together, a baby boy named Dimitri Portwood Kutcher. Dimitri was born in Los Angeles on November 30, 2016, per E! News.\n\nOlder sister Wyatt was thrilled with the new addition. Ashton told Ellen DeGeneres that \"she loves this baby—maybe more than me,\" according to E! News.\n\nAnd if you're wondering about Dimitri's name, it was Mila's suggestion. Ashton said he wanted to name the baby \"Hawkeye.\"\n\n2022: Ashton and Mila raise awareness for the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe two posted multiple Instagram videos together in early 2022, urging their fans and followers to do what they could to support the people of Ukraine during the war with Russia. In fact, they apparently raised $30 million through their social media push.\n\n\"We are overwhelmed with gratitude for your support. 2 weeks ago we asked you to join us and more than 65,000 of you stepped up and donated what you could. Now, with your help we have reached our $30 million goal,\" Ashton wrote on Instagram.\n\nICYMI, this cause is near and dear to their hearts. Mila was born in Ukraine and speaks Russian. Her family emigrated to the United States when she was still young, per CNN.\n\n2022: The couple reflects on That '70s Show ahead of the reboot.\n\nThe spinoff, That '90s Show, takes place in 1995, and follows Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti’s daughter, Leia Forman, as she visits her grandparents for the summer, according to BuzzFeed. And, drumroll please... Ashton and Mila will both be returning for one episode, according to IMDb.\n\n“It was really nostalgic to be back on the set,” Ashton shared with Variety. “It’s all the same folks that made That '70s Show, so it was pretty bizarre.”\n\nI can’t wait to see these two return to their roots. Catch That '90s Show streaming on Netflix on Jan. 19."
