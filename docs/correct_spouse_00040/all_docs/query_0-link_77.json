        "text": "Demi Moore’s Daughter Tallulah Willis Detailed What It Was Like Being Raised By Famous Parents And Revealed She’s “Still Unpacking” Her Mom And Ashton Kutcher’s Relationship\n\n“I really went inside of myself, and that did send me into like a total dumpster fire.”\n\nTallulah Willis is sharing her thoughts on her mom Demi Moore’s past relationship with Ashton Kutcher.\n\nFor those who need a quick refresher, Demi and Ashton got together back in 2003 — three years after her divorce from her ex Bruce Willis was finalized.\n\nDemi and Ashton tied the knot in 2005, when she was 42 and he was 27, though ended up announcing their separation six years later, in 2011. At several points during their marriage, the couple were blighted by rumors that Ashton had been unfaithful towards Demi.\n\nIn 2017, Ashton addressed the infidelity claims made against him as he accepted the Robert D. Ray Pillar of Character Award in Iowa.\n\n“I’m also probably the first person to get this award for character who had, like, his name splashed across every gossip magazine as an adulterer like five years ago,” he said.\n\n“Character comes when those magazines tear you apart for something you may or may not have done and you gotta go out and perform tomorrow — with everyone looking at you like you might be an adulterer,” he added.\n\nTwo years later, in 2019, Demi released her tell-all memoir, titled Inside Out, in which she claimed that Ashton had cheated twice and “expressed his fantasy” of having threesomes during their relationship.\n\nDemi alleges in the book, “Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done.”\n\nAshton didn’t explicitly address Demi’s claims at the time, but he did share a pointed message about choosing not to post a “really snarky tweet.” Meanwhile, sources close to him claimed that he was ignoring the memoir altogether.\n\nTwitter: @aplusk\n\nBut in spite of all this, Ashton revealed a year later that he and Demi had no bad blood between them.\n\n“There’s no badness,” he said during a February 2020 interview on the WTF with Marc Maron podcast. “It's all good, we don't hang out.”\n\nAnd Ashton also noted that he remains close with Demi and Bruce’s three daughters, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah, who are now 34, 31, and 29 respectively.\n\n“I make a really conscious effort to stay in touch with the girls. It was eight years,” he said. “I was helping raise teenage girls through their adolescence. I love them. I'm never going to stop loving them and respecting them and honoring them and rooting for them to be successful in whatever they are pursuing.”\n\nNow, Tallulah — who was around 9 years old when Demi and Ashton first met and started dating — has publicly opened up about how their relationship impacted her as a child.\n\nTallulah is currently starring in Fox reality series Stars On Mars, which sees a group of celebrities — like Ariel Winter, Tom Schwartz, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse — competing to see who’d be best suited to live on a simulation of the planet Mars.\n\nOpening up to her fellow “astronauts” in the premiere episode, Tallulah said, “It was like 2003, my mom had just started dating Ashton.”\n\n“It was that moment, a lot going on and I really went inside of myself, and that did send me into like a total dumpster fire,” she revealed.\n\n“It was really hard and I'm still unpacking,” she added.\n\nHowever, Tallulah went on to note that she eventually found herself on “the other side” of it all.\n\n“I found the other side of that, which is like I really love myself now and I love my family,” she said.\n\nElsewhere, Tallulah — who was labeled the “quintessential nepo baby” by fellow “astronaut” Tinashe — discussed what it was like being raised by famous parents.\n\n“I grew up in Idaho. And I knew my parents had this job that made them this thing and we got to do cool stuff, but I didn't fully understand,” she said.\n\nShare This Article"
