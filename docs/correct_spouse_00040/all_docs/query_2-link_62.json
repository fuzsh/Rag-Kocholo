        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey've been teasing us for months, but it seems as though Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher have at last made it official. A source has told People that the couple were married over the weekend, although reps for the actors have yet to issue a statement. The couple of three years welcomed daughter Wyatt in October, and have remained coy about their marital status. In January, a holiday message on Facebook was addressed from \"the Kutchers,\" while Kunis told Late Late Show host James Corden in March that she and her That '70s Show co-star had \"maybe\" tied the knot. She also flashed Corden a wedding band, prompting him to say that the pair were indeed married. So sneaky, guys. This would be Kutcher's second marriage, following his union with Demi Moore. Kunis, who shared her first-ever kiss with Kutcher during their time on That '70s Show, is a first-time bride. We're betting little Wyatt made an adorable flower girl."
