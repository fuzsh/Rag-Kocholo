        "text": "For anyone ever fascinated by the Hollywood power marriage of Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, they have sure learned a lot from Moore’s new memoir about why that atypical pairing didn’t work out.\n\nThey read in “Inside Out,” that Moore, 56, had self-esteem and alcohol problems and that Kutcher — according to her — was insensitive about her substance abuse struggles and that he wanted threesomes and wasn’t inclined to apologize for infidelity.\n\nSince the book came out, Kutcher, 41, has tried to act like he’s taking the high ground. The actor and tech entrepreneur tweeted out that he could post a “really snarky tweet,” but wouldn’t for the sake of his current wife Mila Kunis and their two young children.\n\nOf course, Kutcher’s non-“snarky tweet” was, in effect, a “snarky tweet,” which displayed the kind of “douchebag instinct” he used to be famous for, Lainey Gossip opined. Then Kutcher had to go and promise to tell “the truth” in another tweet. He invited people to text a number to join “his community.” But Kutcher’s text “community” is a data mining ploy, as Wired revealed in January 2019.\n\n“How broken up over the memoir is he if he’s actively trying to capitalize off of it?” Lainey Gossip asked.\n\nMeanwhile, the third party in all this is Kunis. Tabloids have captured photos of the actress, 36, either looking glum or trying to appear unconcerned, as when Kutcher shared a selfie of the pair smiling during a family trip to Disneyland over the weekend.\n\nKunis, of course, wasn’t happy about Moore airing “dirty laundry” in her book, a source told Hollywood Life.\n\nBut Kunis wasn’t “shocked” by anything Moore revealed, another source told People.\n\n“Nothing came out in this book that Mila did not already know,” a source with “knowledge of the situation” told People. “There was no shock, there was no surprise. Did Ashton love the book? No, of course not. Did it impact their marriage at all? No, of course not.”\n\nMoore began dating Kutcher, 15 years her junior, in 2003 after she had begun to retreat from acting. Her string of successful roles in films like “Ghost” and “Indecent Proposal” in the early 1990s made her one Hollywood’s highest paid actresses. But those roles weren’t as plentiful as she entered her 40s.\n\nWhen Moore hooked up with the “That 70s’ Show” actor, she acknowledged that she was trying to feel young again.\n\nMoore wrote that she “went into contortions to try to fit the mold of the woman (Kutcher) wanted his wife to be” during the marriage. She added, “I put him first. So, when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn’t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be. … It was a mistake. I was strangely flooded with shame.”\n\nMoore wrote that she broke 20 years of sobriety because Kutcher questioned the existence of alcoholism. Her drinking also increased after she suffered a miscarriage at six months and after her efforts to get pregnant again failed. The marriage finally ended after she said Kutcher cheated on her for the second time in 2011. Moore said she learned about his infidelity via a Google alert on her phone.\n\nMoore claimed that Kutcher was not that apologetic. “Because we had brought a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he’d done,” Moore wrote.\n\nKutcher appeared to deny the cheating reports in 2017 when he accepted an award for character from a center at Drake University in Iowa that teaches leadership development. During his acceptance speech, Kutcher suggested that the “character” of the “adulterer” was assigned to him by the gossip media, People reported at the time.\n\n“I’m also probably the first person to get this award for character who had, like, his name splashed across every gossip magazine as an adulterer like five years ago,” Kutcher said, alluding to his and Moore’s 2013 divorce.\n\n“Character comes when those magazines tear you apart for something you may or may not have done and you gotta go out and perform tomorrow — with everyone looking at you like you might be an adulterer,” he said.\n\nWhether or not Kunis believes Kutcher’s view that he was falsely maligned, she is determined to stay focused on their family, which includes their daughter Wyatt, 4, and son Dmitri, 2, People reported.\n\n“Mila and Ashton are very much in love and have a strong and committed relationship,” a source told People. “Neither is in favor of adverse publicity, but the book and Demi’s TV promotions didn’t do anything to shake their strong bond and love for each other and their children.”"
