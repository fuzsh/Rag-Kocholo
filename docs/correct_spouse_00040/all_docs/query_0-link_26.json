        "text": "Not all A-list romances last. Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher called it quits in 2011 after six years of marriage â but their relationship is still a hot topic among fans.\n\nThe Golden Globe nominee and the That â70s Show alum began dating in 2003 and tied the knot two years later. At the time, their 15-year age difference was the talk of Hollywood.\n\nâHe was 25. I was 40,â Moore recalled in her 2019 memoir, Inside Out. âBut Iâm telling you: we couldnât feel it. We were totally in sync from our very first conversation.â\n\nBefore exchanging vows with Kutcher, the General Hospital alum was married to Freddy Moore from 1981 to 1985 and to Bruce Willis from 1987 to 2000. The Indecent Proposal star and the Sixth Sense actor share daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, and have remained friendly in the years since their split.\n\nWhile reflecting on her relationship with the Ranch alum, Demi noted that she was in a very different place when she was 25. âKeep in mind, when I was twenty-five, I became a mom,â she wrote in her book. âI skipped straight from being a young adult into motherhood and marriage. When I met Ashton, it almost felt like a do-over, like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young with him- much more so than Iâd ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my 20s.â\n\nHowever, the pair couldnât make their marriage work. In 2011, Us Weekly broke the news that Kutcher was allegedly unfaithful, and the A Few Good Men actress announced the duoâs separation later that year. Their divorce was finalized in 2013, two years before Kutcher wed Mila Kunis.\n\nDemi spoke about her and Kutcherâs relationship more candidly than ever in Inside Out, revealing that she suffered a miscarriage in the early years of their marriage.\n\nâIt was my fault, I felt for sure: if only I hadnât opened the door to drinking, I never would have lost the baby. Even worse, I was still smoking when I found out I was pregnant, and it took me a few weeks to quit completely,â she wrote. âI was wracked with guilt and convinced what had happened was my doing.â\n\nThe Rough Night star went on to discuss her then-husbandâs reported affairs, claiming that Kutcher had approached her about having threesomes before their split.\n\nâThere was two different people we opened our relationship to, and they didnât have bad intentions,â she added. âThey were good people, but it was still a mistake.â\n\nBefore the book hit shelves, a source exclusively told Us that Kutcher was given a âheads upâ about the details Demi chose to include. âAshton knew what was coming,â the insider noted in September 2019. âHeâs not mad or disappointed. This is Demiâs truth, and he always felt sympathetic toward her. He knows her story and that her upbringing was difficult.â\n\nThe exes havenât been tight in the years since their divorce, but they have both looked back fondly on the time they shared.\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nâWhatever pain we went through together enabled both of us to grow into the people we are today,â the Striptease star wrote in her book.\n\nScroll down to relive Kutcherâs marriage to Demi and to see where they stand post-split:\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksaa5yGakqKeimnqiv8etpqdlm6rBpLTEq6pmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsGqucSloKedXaW1sMDOrGY%3D"
