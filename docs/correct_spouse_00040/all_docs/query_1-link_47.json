        "text": "The former co-stars from \"That 70s Show\" had a very happy holiday together.\n\nThe couple first went to visit Kutcher’s family in his hometown of Cedar Rapids, Iowa for Christmas. Most recently, however, they were spotted in the Chicago suburb of La Grange, Illinois, having a \"flirty brunch.\"\n\nKunis and Kutcher were spotted at Prasino, where the restaurant’s marketing director, Lauren Zeien, managed to get a photo of the newly public couple.\n\nThese two former co-stars have been dating since April, but only became public about the relationship this past fall. More recently, they have been spotted together all over the globe. Getting fro-yo in Iowa, sharing a romantic dinner in Rome, and hanging out together in the middle of New York City’s Central Park.\n\nSources from the Chicago area restaurant shared that Kutcher, 34, and Kunis, 29, seemed extra flirty during their lunch date. It was also shared that the famous couple was \"very courteous to (the restaurant’s) staff.\" The couple shared the short rib skillet and the Florentine crepes.\n\nMany people have speculated that it is because of his relationship with Mila Kunis that Kutcher has recently attempted to speed up his divorce process with Demi Moore. Just last week, he made the first move and filed for divorce from Moore, whom he separated with over a year ago. Some say that the move was prompted by ax reasons, but others say it is because of Kunis.\n\nA source shared that Mila Kunis felt like \"she and Ashton [were] in limbo due to Demi dragging her feet,\" with the divorce. The source also added that the slow paced process was driving Kunis crazy because she and Kutcher are \"seriously talking about marriage themselves.\"\n\nIf you are separated from your spouse and your divorce process is preventing you from moving forward in your life, contact an experienced divorce attorney in Illinois to help move things along. Angel Traub and Associates can help you move your life forward, starting with completing your divorce."
