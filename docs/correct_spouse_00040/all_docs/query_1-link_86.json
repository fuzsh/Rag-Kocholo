        "text": "Mila Kunis has appeared to confirm she has indeed married to Ashton Kutcher after repeatedly calling him her “husband” during an interview.\n\nAnd rather interestingly it’s thought the nuptials took place BEFORE July 4 – as the interview was given over a month ago.\n\nSpeaking to the Telegraph magazine the 31-year-old refers to Ashton as her husband three times.\n\nShe says: “My husband and I always backpack through Europe”.\n\nLater on she lets slip: “I am a democrat. My husband is a democrat.”\n\nAnd when talking about Halloween she reveals: “I went as a pig and my husband went as pig.”\n\nMila has previously teased when asked if she was married – for example of the James Corden show she coyly replied “maybe” when asked.\n\nLast weekend the pair are reported to have celebrated their nuptials and while many thought they were trying the knot then, it seems it was just a party to celebrate thr.wedding which happened weeks before.\n\nThe couple held an intimate affair at the Secret Garden at Parrish Ranch in Oak Glen, California.\n\nAnd according to E! Online Mila wore a stunning \"strapless dress with her hair pulled back\" and the couple's daughter, Wyatt, also donned a white dress throughout the event.\n\nThe Hollywood A-listers put their guests up in luxury tents on the ranch grounds so that no one had to leave the property the entire celebratory weekend.\n\nThe source told E!:\"Everyone danced and had a great time and there was also a casual farewell brunch on Sunday morning before everyone went home.\"\n\nWe're reached out to Mila's rep for comment."
