        "text": "Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are leaving the “’90s” behind.\n\nThe real-life married couple and former stars of “That ’70s Show” will not return for the second season of the reboot, “That ’90s Show.”\n\n“No,” Kunis told “Entertainment Tonight” in April when asked if she and Kutcher would come back to the series. “I mean, we did our thing, and I think they introduced the son, right? It was our son in the show. That was, you know,” she said, without elaborating further.\n\nKunis and Kutcher made a cameo in the first season in 2023, with Kutcher reprising his role as goofball Michael Kelso and Kunis returning as the spoiled Jackie Burkhart. During their appearance, we learned the couple is getting remarried for the second time.\n\nIn the series, Kelso and Jackie’s son, Jay, is romantically involved with Leia, whose parents are Eric and Donna, played in the original show by Topher Grace and Laura Prepon, respectively.\n\nFellow “That ’70s Show” star Wilmer Valderrama will also not be returning to Point Place for “That ’90s Show” after he also made a guest appearance on the first season. Valderamma who played exchange student Fez on the original series, now stars on “NCIS,” which is where his focus is.\n\n“There’s no time!” he told People earlier this month.\n\n“We’re pushing 20 episodes a season (on “NCIS”), but at the same time, it’s the kids’ jobs,” he added, talking about the new stars of “That ‘90s Show.”\n\nWho stars in “That ’90s Show”?\n\nOriginal stars Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp reprise their roles as Red and Kitty, respectively, while Callie Haverda plays their granddaughter, Leia, who comes to visit them in the summer. The first season took place in 1995.\n\nAshley Aufderheide plays Leia’s friend and neighbor Gwen, and Mace Coronel plays Jay. Reyn Doi appears as the sarcastic friend Ozzie, while Maxwell Acee Donovan stars as Gwen’s brother, Nate, and Sam Morelos portrays Nate’s girlfriend, Nikki.\n\nWho else will appear in the second season?\n\nNetflix actually calls the second season “Part 2,” which will feature several blasts from the past. Prepon will make an appearance as Donna, as will Don Stark, who plays her father, while Andrea Anders, who appeared in multiple episodes in the first season, will also return.\n\nOther guest stars include Will Forte, Seth Green, Lisa Loeb, Carmen Electra, Wayne Knight, Kevin Smith, Tommy Chong, Jason Mewes, Matt Rife and Kadeem Hardison.\n\nPart 2 picks up in 1996.\n\n“​​All of us at ‘That ’90s Show’ were beyond excited by the warm, enthusiastic response to our first season,” show co-creator, executive producer and showrunner Gregg Mettler said in a statement. “We can’t wait to return to Point Place for another summer of laughs and surprises. Hello, 1996!”\n\nWhen does “That ‘90s Show” return?\n\nThe second part will drop June 27 and the third part will be available Oct. 24."
