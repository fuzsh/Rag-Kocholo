        "text": "Could Mila Kunis be any more awesome? Ashton Kutcherâs wife got candid in a new interview about her husbandâs first wife, Demi Moore, and revealed the former couple had a ânormal, real relationship.â\n\nAshton and Demi previously wed in 2005 when he was 27 and she was 42. They split after seven years of marriage in 2012 and Ashton married Mila in 2015. âYeah, I married a divorcÃ©e,â Mila admitted to the WTF podcast in late July.\n\nDemi had three daughters from her second marriage to Bruce Willis, and Mila shared that despite the fact that Ashton wasnât too much older than the girls, he was very close with them. âThey had three kids they were raising,â she shared of Rumer, 29, Scout, 27, and Tallulah, 24. âIt was, like, a normal lifeâ¦ He was younger, but he loved those kids.â\n\nAshton and Mila reconnected shortly after his highly-publicized divorce from Demi (they co-starred on That â70s Show in the late â90s through the early 2000s.) âI did a movie called Friends With Benefits. He did a movie that was very similar: No Strings Attached,â Mila revealed. âWe lived our movies out, where we were like, âLetâs just hook up. Letâs have fun. Weâre both single. We both trust each other. Everythingâs great.â None of us wanted tension. OK, great. We hooked up for three months. And just like our movies, one of us caught feelings.â\n\nShe especially wanted to be with him after he told her about someone else he was seeing. âI felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,â Mila explained. âHe said something, and I was likeâ¦ âOh, my god. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so Iâm going to speak up.'â\n\nWell, she spoke up, and they soon moved in together. âHe was only single by that point for maybe a year, maybe a year and a half,â she said of his split with Demi. Now the couple is happily married and parents to two children, daughter Wyatt, 3, and son Dimitri, 1!\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46moKWZXaDCr7XSZp%2Buq5KWu6V5wKyfraeeYri2wMKhnKtlnZa%2Fs7XAoJxmnJWitm65zqipnmVha4B5hZFo"
