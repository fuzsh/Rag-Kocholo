        "text": "Virtual ANS is a software simulator of the unique Russian synthesizer ANS – photoelectronic microtonal/spectral musical instrument created by Russian engineer Evgeny Murzin from 1938 to 1958. Murzin named his invention in honour of the composer Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin.\n\nThe instrument was used by Stanislav Kreichi, Alfred Schnittke, Edison Denisov, Sofia Gubaidulina, Edward Artemiev and other Soviet composers.\n\nYou can hear the sound of the ANS in Andrei Tarkovsky‘s movies Solaris, The Mirror, Stalker. In 2004, the British experimental group Coil released CoilANS, a boxed set of experimental drone music performed on the ANS.\n\nSomething like a simplified MetaSynth.\n\nOriginal ANS:\n\nDownload Site: WarmPlace\n\nMore Info Here: CreateDigitalMusic\n\nThis is a great overview of Harold Bode’s electronic musical instruments from: the Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC)\n\nIn one of his notebooks ca. 1937, Harald Bode wrote, “Wie ist der Klang?” The following article gives an overview on his instruments from 1937 until 1981. “How is the sound?” is an expanded version of a text the author prepared for the Harald Bode exhibition “A Lifetime for Sound” at the Estey Museum (Brattleboro VT) in 2010.\n\nHarald and the Audio System Synthesizer, a modular synthesizer and sound processor.\n\nEarly version of the Bode Vocoder model 7702.\n\nApparatewerk Bayern [Bavarian Machine Factory] advertisement for the Polychord III with tone cabinet.\n\nThe Polychord.\n\nThe Melochord in the Studio für elektronische Musik, Cologne, Germany.\n\nPhotograph of the Melodium from a period magazine article.\n\nPhotograph of Warbo Formant Organ from a period magazine article.

It’s a pleasure for me to share my efforts with other people without having to worry about commercial interests. In each of my effects there is a special technical design, workflow or concept combination I haven’t found in existing tools. Many developers these days just stick to old concepts, but you will never see a straight copy of existing gear from me. I always add some innovation, or find a way to evolve and take it to a new level.”\n\nPress Here To Enter The Site: Variety of Sound\n\nPress Here For The Video: Electric Independence\n\nWiki:\n\n“Morton Subotnick (born April 14, 1933 in Los Angeles, California) is an American composer of electronic music, best known for his Silver Apples of the Moon, the first electronic work commissioned by a record company, Nonesuch. He has taught for many years in the Music School at CalArts.\n\nSubotnick has also worked extensively with interactive electronics and multi-media, co-founding the San Francisco Tape Music Center with Ramon Sender, and often collaborating with his wife Joan La Barbara. His children are animator Steven Subotnick, sound designer Jacob Subotnick and social worker Tamara Winer. His notable students include Ingram Marshall, Mark Coniglio, and Lois V Vierk.\n\nSilver Apples of the Moon was notable for more than being an answer to a record-biz trivia question. Early electronic music was made using wave generators and tape-manipulated sounds. Subotnick was among the first composers to work with electronic instrument designer Don Buchla. Buchla’s modular voltage-controlled synthesizer, which he called the Electric Music Box and which was constructed partly based on suggestions by Subotnick and Sender, was both more flexible and easier to use, and its sequencing ability was integral to Subotnick’s music.\n\nAt a time when electronic music was highly abstract, largely concerned with pitch and timbre, with rhythm an afterthought or of no consequence and patterns largely avoided, Subotnick broke with the academic avant-gardists by including sections with regular rhythms. Its rhythmic energy perhaps has something to do with Silver Apples and 1968’s The Wild Bull (another Nonesuch-commissioned work for tape; they have since been combined on a Wergo CD) being subsequently choreographed by dance companies around the world.\n\nWhere previous electronic music had used non-traditional structures, Subotnick’s electronic compositions are structured more like the classical music for acoustic instruments that audiences are familiar with, but with the added benefit of untraditional timbres and pitch manipulations no orchestra could produce. He has, in fact, written for acoustic instruments, and studied with Darius Milhaud and Leon Kirchner at Mills College in Oakland, California.”\n\nEnter The Max Database Here\n\nWelcome to the Max Objects DataBase !\n\nThis site is designed to find objects, patches, applications, etc… from Max universe (Max/MSP, Jitter,…).\n\nJust as an indication, some objects are listed to be available on Pure Data as well.\n\nIf you register, you could add objects, libraries, comments and news.
