        "text": "General Information\n\nMy technician (make sure you deal with a Registered Piano Technician, not a \"tuner\") told me that in the last 200 or so years, there have been about 12,500 different brands of pianos made (not model names - - brands)!\n\nAs you read my comments on piano brands, below, you will note that many are American. I do not list American brands out of patriotic preference but because in the hundred-year period between 1820-1920, there was an explosion of piano building in America, so many of those 12,500 brands were American.\n\nThis manufacturing explosion was scarcely interrupted by the Civil War. The economy of the North had been strong throughout the conflict and continued to grow after it. Starting in the Northeast (Boston, upstate New York, and especially New York City), piano manufacturing moved westward through Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio toward Chicago.\n\nAbout the time it reached the mid-West (ca. 1900), the explosion sparkled to a close, moving westward no farther because the population dropped off sharply beyond Chicago and transportation of materials further west would drive up the price beyond what the economies of the area could bear. For those living in far-flung areas of the U.S., however, help was coming, wearing a white hat. To the traditional shopping expeditions to Chicago or \"back East\" was added the mail-order catalog.\n\nThe first documented mail-order operation was in 1499 in Italy (books), followed by catalogs for seed (England, 1667) and saplings (U.S., 1771). The ever-enterprising Benjamin Franklin offered a catalog in 1744, listing almost 600 books, which he offered \"satisfaction guaranteed.\" After the Civil War, the population began to move west once more, swelled greatly by the refugee families from the South and unemployed soldiers from both sides of the conflict. For these people, traveling salesmen satisfied - though barely - shopping needs.\n\nOne of these salesmen was Montgomery Ward. He decided that to reach more people than he could visit single-handedly, he would print some fliers listing some of his most popular items. It was a success. The next flyer emerged as an eight-page pamphlet, and soon the enterprise blossomed into a catalog of several hundred pages, complete with woodcut illustrations. Makers of mail-order piano include: Beckwith, Beethoven, Schmoller & Mueller, and D.F. Beatty. Such pianos may have had an extra-rough life because of their extra journeys.\n\nThese companies also sold reed organs (also known as pump organs, melodeons, and, incorrectly in most cases, harmoniums). Picture Great Aunt Bessie pumping away furiously with her feet while the congregation of 20 raw-boned farmers and cowboys, beside by their stalwart women-folk and almost-bedraggled children, bellowed praise as best they could.\n\nThe fleuressence of American piano firms abated about 1920. The stock market crash of 1929 shook the foundations of the industry, and the Great Depression that followed nearly buried it.\n\nAfter the Second World War, when soldiers came home and took advantage of the G.I. Bill to further their educations, family incomes began to rise. Parents wanted things for their children that they had never had  such as piano lessons. Venerable piano brands reappeared, but nearly always made in a much poorer quality in order to put them within reach of the average family. The recovery of the Asian economy, Japan in particular, helped fuel the return of piano manufacturing, again at attractive price points. Meanwhile, in Europe, some of the most revered companies staunchly held on through World Wars I and II, while others were forced to close, either because of the lagging European economy or the loss of facilities to wartime devastation.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nBelow, in addition to comments on specific piano brands, you will find information on \"stencil brands,\" \"gray market pianos,\" factory locations, serial numbers, entry level pianos, types and dimensions, antique pianos, and what's important in making your selection.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nHere are my general thoughts on piano brands: which ones are good, which ones to stay away from. Please note that these are my personal opinions. Instruments from the same manufacturer differ from year to year, and within a given year! In the same way some cars are just lemons.\n\nIt also may make a difference in which factory the instrument was made. Sometimes a company (Yamaha, Kawai) has factories of different \"qualities,\" so piano quality is affected by the factory that made the particular piano you are looking at/seeking.\n\nThe Ryuyo and Hamamatsu Yamaha factories are the most famous example. The Hamamatsu factory is not as good. Thus, pianos coming from the two factories will be of different quality.\n\nGerman-sounding names are often chosen by non-German manufacturers because Germany has such a good reputation for piano-building, at least in the past. Just because it's a German name doesn't mean it was made in Germany or by German expatriates or at a factory founded outside of Germany by Germans or with German \"specifications.\" Inquire. It's nearly always a Chinese piano (or one made for a Chinese company in Indonesia or Malaysia.)\n\nAs of this date (2006), Chinese pianos are usually of inferior quality. A decade or two ago, this was true of Korean pianos and Japanese pianos before that, so expect Chinese instruments to improve in quality. (How quickly is the question. For now, view Chinese pianos with a weather eye.) The Russians, Belarusians, and Poles also are making pianos now. I wouldn't expect good quality from them [yet?], so buy a Russian/former Soviet Union country piano very cautiously.\n\nUpdate, 2009: Pianos are also being made in Indonesia and Malaysia, as labor costs are lower even than China. Nearly always, these are factories for Chinese firms.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the following information is accurate. Things changes all the time in the piano business, so do your due diligence before purchase to avoid buyer's remorse or a poor choice.\n\nStencil Brands\n\nStencil brand pianos (sometimes called store brands) are common in the U.S. These are like the house brands at a grocery store, except with stencil brand pianos, the quality is usually pretty poor. With grocery store brands, however, while noticeably different in quality, are not necessarily poor quality.\n\nHere's how stencil brands work. A piano store (usually a nation-wide or at least a regional piano company) buys these from a factory and slaps their store name on it.\n\nSometimes the factory owns the rights to the name of a venerable brand no longer being produced. Sometimes the names are \"new\" (German names are often selected). These are then sold to the retailer.\n\nTherefore, many \"different brands\" of pianos - - at varying price points - - are actually from the same factory! And could, in fact, be the very same piano, except for the brand name and some superficial differences such as wood used in the case!\n\nThese pianos vary greatly in quality. Some are awful; some are pretty poor; a few make it up to ok. None I have played rates better than ok. These pianos are made in areas of the world with low labor costs: China, Indonesia, and Malaysia, in particular. I'm sure you see the connection here.\n\nMany (if not most) stencil brands are names bought from (mostly old) companies that are out of business and that once built good instruments. These companies may have been out of business for 100 years before their names were resurrected and \"their\" piano \"reintroduced.\"\n\nNote also that many stencil brands, whether they are purchased names or not, have \"German names,\" drawing on the tradition of high quality in German pianos, as I noted earlier.\n\nSome stencil brands can be made to sound decent (but not terribly good!) if serviced first by a tech and regulated (volume of all notes made the same, basically, though some other things are done to the piano). The price of this work may offset any savings on the piano itself, however. You might check with a tech for a price estimate in advance of plunking down your money for a stencil piano.\n\nTread cautiously with stencil brands. Especially pianos with German names, take care. The manufacturer may be masking a very poor quality instrument with an implied veneer of fine craftsmanship. Nearly always stencil brand pianos are not very good and probably a pretty bad buy.\n\nI should note, however, that the cabinetry of stencil brands is often very good: high-gloss finishes, for example. Know that when you buy a piano to play, you are buying the egg, not its shell. If you are buying a piano to show, of course the shell is important. In fact, the egg itself might not matter in the least! The shell could even be empty - who would know?!\n\nIn any event, find out the real maker and research that, as opposed to researching the store's name or the brand name placed above the keyboard.\n\nGray Market Pianos\n\nWhile doing more research for obscure brands, I have discovered (2012) that sometimes ultra-cheap pianos are shipped to the U.S. simply to fill containers on the container ships! Oh, dear! If nothing else, what an ignoble fate for our beloved instrument!\n\nSuch pianos are sometimes called \"gray market\" pianos. Despite your initial sympathy to give these feral instruments a place in your home, stay away from them. Obviously, they are very, very poor quality if they are used as nothing more than \"packing material\".\n\nThe term is also applied to pianos that are to be sold by non-\"authorized dealers.\" In this case, you have no idea what quality the instrument is unless you can find specifics on it.\n\nI'll add info here on affected brands as I can find it. I would be happy to pass along any information from readers on names of gray market instruments.\n\nFactory Location and Parts Manufacturers\n\nSome factories buy parts from all over the world. An American company can buy German actions (that's the \"guts\" of the piano and on whose quality the overall quality of the piano stands). Sometimes a company with a good reputation farms out its manufacturing process to a country with cheaper labor rates. For example, Pratt-Read, which makes actions, moved their factory to Mexico, with disastrous results because the labor was unskilled (and sometimes unreliable). You can find Chinese parts in non-Chinese instruments. And, in a curious turn-around, some Japanese pianos are manufactured in America and Europe!\n\nMention will be made below of the Yamaha factories in Ryuyo and Hamamatsu. The factory in Ryuyo is the better of the two: more- and better-skilled craftsmen and technicians, as well as better materials. If you are buying a Yamaha, find out. Some non-Yamaha brand pianos (ex.: Boston) are made in the Yamaha factory.\n\nSerial Number\n\nWith the serial number (and name) of a piano you are examining or thinking of purchasing, your tech should be able to furnish you with exact information about where the piano was made and when, whether this date was before the company was sold and/or acquired new manufacturing equipment, what kinds of parts were used and where those were manufactured, and so forth.\n\nI'll say again that you need a tech to examine any used instrument. Don't agree to buy a piano on your first visit to a dealership unless you love it and everything about it, including the price, AND you have taken your tech along.\n\nAlthough not the rule, some salespeople do not know the stock. A few, regrettably, push one brand, no matter what the buyer wants. Pushing Chinese brands is especially common here.\n\nBuying Pianos from Private Parties\n\nI caution you about buying a piano on craigslist. Newspaper classified ads are perhaps more trustworthy because the seller must pay for space; Pennysaver-type classified ads in between. Almost to an instrument, pianos sold by private parties are \"warhorses\" (also known as \"old klunkers\") that should be put out to pasture: pianos that are way past their prime and would require significant investment to restore them to a reasonable playing condition.\n\nThese folks usually have no idea what the piano is truly worth and price them \"appropriately,\" often based on \"sentimental value.\" For example, a seller might price a \"family treasure\" at $1000-$2000 (2015), when, in fact, it is worth less than $100-$150 - - not counting the repairs that will be necessary. Despite the mis-pricing, private parties on craigslist and other such sites are not trying to \"stick you\" with a worthless piano at a vastly-inflated price.\n\nNonetheless, these pianos are sold \"as is,\" and you will have no recourse if there is a problem.\n\nDo peruse the listings but be careful! For example, a price of $500 may look appealing, especially when you've been looking at several thousands in a store, but you're getting what you're paying for.\n\nDespite these sellers' probable ingenuousness and good intentions, beware of pianos offered on such sites. It's almost certain you are not getting a good instrument, and thus a purchase could be a very poor investment. You would have been better served by renting a piano until something better comes along.\n\nMore information is at the link just above.\n\nEntry Level Pianos\n\nAvoid instruments described as \"entry level\"!!! No, no, NO!!\n\nFor a little more money, you can get a lot more piano. Most entry level pianos are very bad. Some entry level pianos are incredibly bad. About one in particular, a reader writes \"execrable.\" Hard to get lower than that! (See discussion of specific brands, below.)\n\nAsk for the name of the entry level piano line of a particular brand. Then ask for the next level up. \"What is the name of the line that is the next step up?\" Remember that the first reason you go into a piano store is to be educated. Looking at and evaluating different pianos is the second step. Choosing one is the last step.\n\nFor example, the Essex (made by Young Chang; but starting in 2005 made by Pearl River) is \"Steinway's\" entry level piano. The Boston, next up in the \"Steinway line\", is a very good piano. As you can see, the Essex and the Boston are not made by Steinway, something Steinway goes to some lengths to obscure.\n\nTypes and Sizes\n\nThere are only two kinds of pianos - - grands and verticals - - but there are several sizes in these general categories.\n\nGrands\n\n\"parlor\" (sometimes called \"petite\"): 4'5\" to 5'5\"\n\n\"baby\": 5'0\" to 6'5\"\n\n\"medium\" (sometimes called \"parlor,\" \"living room,\" or \"medium studio\"): 5'6\" to 6'5\"\n\n\"semi-concert\" (sometimes called \"professional\"): 6'6\" to 8'0\".\n\n\"concert\": 8'9\" to 10'2\". Most concert grands are 9' in length\n\nVerticals\n\nspinet: 35\" to 39\" in height\n\nconsoles: 40\" to 44\" (those 39\" to 40\" are sometimes called \"consolettes;\" and \"consoles\" 40\" to 43\")\n\nstudio: 45\" to 47\"\n\nprofessional (sometimes called \"full size\"): 48\" to 52\" (Note: Prior to 1930, some verticals soared to 60\" in height.)\n\nI used to call these \"upright pianos,\" but I was informed by a tech that vertical is the proper name. I stand corrected!\n\nAntique Pianos\n\nA \"square grand\" (built ~1700-1900) is always an antique piano. \"Birdcages\" (~1840-1940) often are, too. Be careful with these! You probably are buying a lot of repairs! (Ask your technician....)\n\nSome antique pianos are conversions from player pianos. In many cases, the company also made player pianos. View these conversions with skepticism. The action might be \"a little strange\" since it was built to be run by a player mechanism.\n\nWhere to get more information is in a link at the end of this file.\n\nAs a general rule, an antique piano is a non-starter because at this point in time, they are 120 years old. Unless they've been completely rebuilt (a step beyond restored), they will be unplayable.\n\nPrimary Considerations in Choosing a Piano\n\nLet us put cost aside for a moment.\n\nRemember that you are looking primarily at the touch (a function of the action) and sound (bright treble? lots of bass? generally muffled?).\n\nSound is a personal preference. What sounds good to you?\n\nI personally like a bright treble and medium-firm touch, but this is only my opinion!\n\nThe action is the most important aspect of a piano, however, because that (and the case/soundboard) is what influences sound.\n\nIf the action is too light, it's hard to control dynamics (loud and soft). Also, the hand doesn't build up much strength so that when the player sits before a piano with a firmer action, playing is quite difficult. If the action is too stiff, playing the piano is fatiguing; dynamics are problematic.\n\nAction is changed by reshaping hammers, changing the weights put into each key (yes, actual pieces of lead), finding which parts are rubbing each other but shouldn't, etc.\n\nRegulating a piano is an exacting task. It will cost you more than a tuning, to be sure. This is why if you pay to regulate an inferior instrument, you're likely to end up with a more expensive not-quite-as-inferior inferior instrument.\n\nCasework is important, but make sure the action is good. Don't be fooled by a gorgeous piece of furniture with inferior action.....\n\n.....unless you just want something upon which to perch sterling picture frames. I am sure you've seen the \"interior decor\" magazines with a beautiful piano, lid down, in front of a window (ack!), and covered with framed family pictures and a voluptuous of arrangement of roses. Presumably, you are reading this file because you want a piano to use!\n\nGorgeous pieces of furniture with bargain price tags are going to be inferior pianos because the investment was in the outside, not the inside. The inside is what matters.\n\nAlso know that pianos depreciate rapidly - - some more than others.\n\nPianists are prisoners of the instruments they are given (though Vladimir Horowitz toured with his own instrument and technician!). We are not like violinists. Their violins are the same, no matter whether they are standing in a ditch or standing in a concert hall.\n\nInformation about Specific Brands\n\nPeople ask me all the time about this piano or that one. Here is what I think of certain pianos.\n\nLet me emphasize that the comments below are my opinions.\n\nI do not have an ax to grind for one brand over another. My intent is to offer my opinions to help readers clear away some of the thicket surrounding purchasing a piano.\n\nI receive no pat on the back or anything else for remarks of a positive nature. Similarly, one piano company is not compensating me to write something negative about another company. These are my opinions. For free.\n\nI want to be even-handed in my reviews, so I am happy to add information from those of you who have played/searched for any of these instruments and care to offer your experiences. We all can benefit. Several updates on certain brands appear, already.\n\nAlso, please remember that, pianos are individually-made instruments with hand labor (more hand labor in finer pianos, which means they command higher prices) and \"nature-made\" materials that cannot be fully quality-controlled. Thus, there are good specimens, less good ones, and poor ones.\n\nIn the end, a piano is an individual purchase. You buy what sounds and feels best to you - - at the size and price point you want.\n\nI add pianos as I hear of new ones (most often, someone will write for information about it), so if it's not listed here, there's a 99% chance I have never heard of it, let alone played it.\n\nThese are my opinions, right? Say aloud, \"This file contains this woman's opinions.\"\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nThis file began life as several-sentences-about-each-brand. It is now turning into a history of piano brands and factories! Whenever possible, especially for obscure brands, I have included some history of the company, if I can find it. I have used primary source material when I could find it.\n\nI also have made an effort to identify which brands are made by which companies. Sometimes, various labels are the result of consolidations of several companies. Sometimes, some of these brands are phased out, perhaps because they did not sell as well as other lines or because the buying company had a product that was too close a competitor (price, market) to warrant keeping both lines.\n\nAnd, sometimes, a company would sell or even \"lease\" its name to another company, under which the second company made its own pianos but used the first company's name because it was prestigious (or more prestigious than their own!). These \"leases\" could last for a long time or for several years (even one!) only. Just because the name is on the piano doesn't mean it's really that piano! (See discussion of stencil pianos, above.) Also, the same name could have been leased to several companies. Aeolian was a big culprit: buying/leasing names and putting them on pianos they made. The piano said \"A\", but it wasn't made with A specs but with B specs.\n\nI have tried to follow which-manufacturer-what-brand-when. Sometimes, when brand names appear to be made by more than one company -or- I was not able to get the chronology straight of which-brand-was-with-whom-when, I have the names as brands under more than one company. It also could be the case that the name was leased to more than one company - - and then perhaps bought by another company yet!\n\nThe way to find out who made a certain piano and whether it is what name is by the serial number, as noted above.\n\nArmed with the year, you can find out where it was made (factory, city), and therefore who owned the company at that time. Was it built in a factory that made oodles of pianos and slapped \"leased\" or \"purchased\" names on them, or was the instrument built in the original factory by the original company? If more than manufacture in a different factory, were the original specifications being used by the new company, or was it a case of slap-on-of-previously-well-regarded-company-name-on-a-mass-producer-factory-piano? Your tech can consult his/her database and let you know whether the piano you are considering is a \"good\" one or not.\n\nAnother consideration is brand names within the same company. A company might have a number of lines, each at a different price point and each to appeal to a different group of buyers. For example, Steinway has Steinway, Boston, and Essex. Steinway is manufactured by Steinway (American), but the Boston (Japanese) and Essex (entry level; Korean - but since 2005 Chinese) are not; this is an important piece of information, I think! Always research the maker, not the brand name, the \"made by\" name, the \"designed by\" name, or stencil name.\n\nI suppose when I get this file completely researched, we'll find that every piano company is related to every other piano company, through apprenticeship, partnership, sale, marriage, or misrepresentation!\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nA note about The Great Extinction:\n\nWhen the Great Depression hit the U.S., many companies went out of business. Piano builders were no exception. The year 1930 is often used as a watershed, especially for pianos that are unusual to find these days. If the instrument you are considering was built before 1930 and is not a well-known brand today and/or not in current production, you might have an artifact of The Great Extinction. Proceed cautiously with this in mind. There is a link to the Antique Piano Shoppe, specializing in antique pianos, following my brand summaries at the bottom of this file. Much information here about Old Warhorses.\n\nIronic note: Often the brand names of these once-respected or superb brands are being used today to make cheap instruments, usually in Asia, where labor is cheap.\n\nI also want to note that the Great Depression in the U.S. had a ripple effect on the world economy. Some non-American piano firms may have gone out of business when the bottom dropped out of the American economy about 1930.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nRemember: This file contains this woman's opinions.\n\nAlso note: This file also contains readers' material. Some of it is of the \"This was my childhood piano\" and \"I restored one of these\" type. Other of it includes opinions on quality ranking, historical details, price, and so on. I take no responsibility for the accuracy of this latter type of reader-written material. I have not doubled-checked these people's facts. I am very thankful to everyone who has written to add to this file, but I want to make it clear that I cannot vouch for the accuracy of others' material.\n\nHere we go!\n\nAcrosonic: This piano line was introduced by Baldwin in 1935 and produced into the 1980s by Baldwin, but some folks think it is a separate brand, so I am listing it separately. The pianos made early on (1930s, '40s, and perhaps early '50s) were decent instruments. Modern Acrosonics sound tinny and cheesy (IMO - - if you have a modern Acrosonic, I apologize for insulting you!). Remember to compare these instruments with other spinets, not with other vertical pianos. At this point (2012), these pianos probably would cost more to bring up to playing standard than they are worth. I'd pass. American.\n\nAeolian: Company founded as \"Aeolian Organ Company\" in 1887 by piano-builder William B. Tremaine. The company began by manufacturing reed organs, then \"automating\" them. This was the time of manufacturing magnates, and they desired plenty of razzle-dazzle to parade their wealth. One desirable item for the home was a pipe organ. Since the homes size-wise and acoustically were huge, they could easily accommodate a pipe organ. Some of these were encased instruments (pipes housed completely within a box), on which was mounted the keyboard) and some were un-encased (pipes mounted on the wall with the keyboard as a separate console). Competition for church organ installations was fierce at the time, so Aeolian decided to veer off to serve the various robber barons. They succeeded admirably; the Aeolian was the home pipe organ of choice. The company did install a church organ at Duke University, however. The Great Depression left its mark, and the organ division was spun off to merge with E.M. Skinner to become Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company, a famous and very-highly regarded builder of church organs through the 1970s. Aeolian-Skinner had a large number of huge installations in churches and at academic institutions. Meanwhile, Aeolian itself was making player pianos, coin-operated jukeboxes, and \"automated band\" players. Tremaine subsumed a number of competitors. In 1929 (variously 1932), Aeolian bought American Piano Co. (See separate entry.) In 1985, Aeolian went bankrupt. By virtue of the many mergers, Aeolian owned many brands, among them: Knabe, Peck, Cable, Mason & Hamlin, Cambridge, Musette, Chickering, Cabaret, Hardman, George Steck, Mason & Risch, Ivers & Pond, Kranich & Bach, Albert Weber, Conover, Winter, Wellington, Bradbury, J. & C. Fischer, and H. F. Miller. In fact, at one time Aeolian controlled over 40 brands! All of these pianos were made in Aeolian's factory. Determined to make a buck, Aeolian slapped the names of the \"good brands\" on some of them. Buyers assumed these instruments conformed to the original specifications. If there was any connection, it had to have been fairly faint. Of the rest of the brands, it's likely they were all basically the same piano, differing only in casework and name. In fact, all these pianos, regardless of reputation of the brand, may have been \"very closely related\" (ahem)! Aeolian represents a low point, perhaps even the nadir, in American piano making. Any of these brands built after approximately 1930 should be avoided. Aeolian is now out of business (1985). Everybody take a deep breath! Please see separate entries for brands listed above. Some pre-Aeolian brands are worth considering if you can find one that does not need restoration. Or, if the company has now been resurrected under its own name without Asian manufacturing interference. American/various.\n\nAeolian player pianos: Aeolian also had a hand in the mechanical piano business, as late as the 1980s. The player mechanism is not reputed to be very good. Names: Duo/Art, Pianola, Musette, Hardman, Cabaret, Sting, Sting II, and Keepsake.\n\nAeolian Hyundai: See Hyundai.\n\nAdam Schaaf: See Schaaf.\n\nAlbrecht, Charles: See Pearl River.\n\nAlden: See Lester.\n\nAllen, Robert & Sons: This fellow was very enterprising, placing the name of a very famous piano on his piano, but putting the name of his company above it in small letters. Not too jolly. English.\n\nAltenburg, Otto (variously Altenburgh): Otto and his cousin, Frederick, began building pianos while living in Germany. They emigrated to America and opened their factory in New York in about 1865 and built pianos until 1875. In 1868, Frederick formed a partnership with Edward Ehrlich (I don't know what happened to Otto) and built pianos under the F. E. Altenburg & Ehrlich name. Things went south about a year later, though Frederick (and possibly Otto) continued to build pianos. Seeing a growing market, Altenburg opened a retail store while continuing to manufacture pianos. Later they added other piano brands to their retail stock. As noted, production of their own instruments stopped in 1875. In 1990, the name was bought by Samick (Korea). About 1996, Samick may have moved production of this brand to Indonesia. Old Altenburgs are not worth restoring, and new ones depend on what you think about buying a bottom-of-the-tank Samick. I'll give you 2 seconds to think about your answer. Korean/Indonesian.\n\nAltenburg, F.E. & Ehrlich: Altenburg entered into a short-term partnership with Edward Ehrlich. Any instrument of this name would be too old to consider. American.\n\nAmerican Piano Company: Established in 1908 in a merger of Chickering & Sons with several smaller companies. The deal was shepherded by Knabe. Primary companies were Armstrong, Brewster, Marshall & Wendell, Foster-Armstrong, and Haines; also included were stencil pianos manufactured by Foster-Armstrong for an Indiana piano dealer, James F. Cook & Co. American Piano Company's specialty was player pianos, for which they had a good reputation. They tangled over copyright with composers but were upheld by the Supreme Court, which said that player piano rolls were a method of setting down music that could not be read directly by humans. (The copyright law was changed not too long thereafter to extended copyright protection to cover \"mechanical reproduction.\") By the Great Depression, the company was floundering and sold to Aeolian (variously 1929/1932). You will not find any pianos with American Piano Company on the fallboard. I include this company here to help clarify this company's interaction with Aeolian, Chickering, Knabe, and Baldwin; as well as the companies that formed American Piano Company and what happened to their brand names.\n\nAmerica Sejung Corp: Makes stencil pianos in its factory located in Qingdao (China). Not an American company. Brands: Hobart M. Cable, George Steck, and Falcone. See Falcone. No. Chinese.\n\nAmyl: These have been described by tuners as \"horrors\" and \"appalling.\" Do you wish to read further? They were made by a Birmingham (U.K.) co-op called Co-operative Wholesale Society; for this reason, you might find CWS on them. This group was founded in 1844 and was instrumental in writing the \"rules\" of a commercial co-op. Originally, the co-op sold farm products. In the early 1900s, pianos were part of the mix. It would be a surprise if you found an instrument with \"Amyl\" on the fallboard because these instruments were produced only to be stencil pianos for [British] piano retailers. Perhaps available in the 1950s? Other co-op brands: Amylette, Co-Op, and CWS. You probably will be unable to locate an Amyl piano, which is for the better. Britannia and everyone else should rule out this piano. English.\n\nAmylette: See Amyl.\n\nAnniversary: See Lesage.\n\nApollo [player piano]: See Story & Clark.\n\nApollo (variously Apollo Piano): Established in 1863. Wurlitzer bought it about 1925. Starting in 1901, other brands appeared: Art-Apollo and Apollophone. Warhorses all; out to pasture all! American.\n\nApollophone: See Apollo.\n\nArmstrong: See Foster-Armstrong.\n\nArt-Apollo: See Apollo.\n\nAstin-Weight: Established in 1959 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Supposedly not a \"bad\" piano, but the sound is idiosyncratic and not an instant-like sort of thing. Grand lid hinges on treble side, so it has a \"strange\" appearance, and, of course, the acoustics are \"backwards,\" with amplification of the treble. Extended soundboard on vertical model, which increases volume a great deal - some say it is \"too loud.\" Possibly went out of business around 1998. I'd say this is not for an average buyer. If you find one, consider moving on unless something rather eccentric is to your taste. American.\n\nAtlas: I can't find out whether this Atlas Piano is the same Atlas Piano run by Karzen and Gurvey (see Ludwig). It has a reputation as an awful instrument. Terrible action, which means it will be the very devil to play. Made in Malaysia. No, no! Japanese/Malaysian.\n\nBach, Otto: See Dietmann.\n\nBernhard Steiner: See Dietmann.\n\nBaldorr & Son: Likely not something that would please you. Russian.\n\nBaldwin: Good piano. In general, you can't go wrong with a Baldwin. Many concert grands are Baldwins. Excellent quality up to 1970. Quality problems on some actions beginning after about 1970. Concerts grands of 7'0\" and 9'0\" had Renner actions and so were better quality. Baldwin has a checkered and convoluted musical past. Baldwin acquired Bechstein (see separate entry) in 1963 and sold it in 1986. Tried to acquire Fender (guitar company) but could not; bought Burns (English) instead. Nobody wanted Baldwin guitars, however. Why buy a Baldwin when one could buy a Fender or another well-known guitar brand? Nevertheless, Baldwin bought another guitar company in 1967 (Gretsch); this didn't last long, either, and Baldwin sold the company back. At this point, Baldwin decided to try its hand at financial services (!). Baldwin overextended itself - 200 insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions - and filed for bankruptcy in 1983. The management of the company bought the assets in 1984 and took it public in 1986 as Baldwin Piano and Organ Company (the original company name, by the way). The company was sold in 1993 and taken private. Through the 1990s, quality improved. In 2001, however, Baldwin again filed for bankruptcy. This time it was in the roses with guitars: it was bought by Gibson Guitar, which is trying to focus on building a piano that lives up to the Baldwin tradition. Gibson's Baldwins do seem to have better quality, but there is not much production by which to judge this, although production seems to be increasing. Other brands owned under the Baldwin \"umbrella,\" by virtue of Baldwin's buying Wurlitzer (1988): Wurlitzer, Cable, Chickering, Ellington, Howard, Fischer, Kranick & Bach, Hamilton, and Wurlitzer. These brands (including the once-lauded Chickering and Knabe brands) are now made in two Chinese factories. New Baldwin verticals may be Chinese-made; no Wurlitzer, Hamilton, or Chickering pianos are being made. Baldwin grands are still made in the U.S., however. American/various.\n\nUpdate, 2012: A reader writes: \"I found information that Baldwin has reopened their Cincinnati factory. They also take custom orders at their Trumann, Arkansas, factory.\"\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes: \"According to my technicians, the Baldwins from World War II to 1963 are OK pianos but suffer from a bad bridge design. The design was changed about 1964, and the piano has improved.\"\n\nBach, Otto: See Dietmann.\n\nBachmann: There seems to be a Wilhelm Bachmann and a Carl Bachmann. I haven't figured out whether they are related. Wilhelm seems to have been active in piano-building in Austria (and Germany?) about the mid-1890s and Carl in England. Somehow, the Swiss figure into this. Haven't gotten the history untangled yet. Quality of the 19th-century Bachmanns is mixed. Some say rich tone; some say \"shrill.\" At their age, original Bachmanns are assuredly not worth restoration. New production is quite different! This instrument has no hammers and strings but rather has optical sensors. Since we are assuming the pianos made by Carl and Wilhelm are beyond saving, the question is, \"How much do you want something weird?\" Korean?\n\nBacon & Karr: See Bacon & Raven.\n\nBacon, Francis: See Bacon and Raven.\n\nBacon & Raven (variously Raven & Bacon, etc.): The firm was founded in 1789. Bacon and Raven was preceded in life by the piano firm Dubois & Stodart. Piano makers Robert Stodart (see separate entry) and William Dubois (see separate entry) were bankrolled by John Jacob Astor to form a piano company. In 1836, Stodart retired and George Bacon joined the firm. In 1840, Dubois left the firm to go out on his own. That left George Bacon by himself. Bacon was then joined by brothers Richard & Thomas Raven. Accordingly, the firm's name was changed to Bacon & Raven. After the death of George Bacon in 1855, his son Francis Bacon joined the firm. The Raven brothers were in ascendancy, however, so they named the firm Raven, Bacon & Company. In 1862, the name became Raven & Bacon. (Are you with me? Or, have you experienced an overwhelming urge to have breakfast?) In 1871, Francis Bacon bowed out. In 1872, Richard Raven died. The firm was now entirely in the hands of brother Thomas. Since the Bacons were long gone, Thomas renamed the company Raven & Company. In 1878, Thomas Raven left the firm, and for some reason the name of the company was changed to Raven Piano Works. (It's another case where ego pummels marketing name recognition - - see the Warriner portion of Dubois story.) I don't know if any Raven progeny joined their fathers' company, but perhaps not because Raven Piano Works was out of business before 1890. You haven't heard the last of Francis Bacon, however! Now let's switch gears. (Yes, there's time for you to refill your coffee if you hurry. Be careful not to drag your arm in the maple syrup.) In 1871, William H. Karr went into partnership with the aforementioned Francis Bacon. They established the firm of Bacon & Karr. In 1879, Karr left the firm and it was renamed Francis Bacon Piano Company. In 1934, Kohler & Campbell bought the company. Inexplicably, there seems to have been no particular reason to preserve high reputation of the Bacon name, so quality dropped off after the Kohler & Campbell acquisition. It is safe to say any piano with any of these names on the fallboard would not be a peach of a buy. American.\n\nBaus: No Baus in the Haus, bitte. See Doll.\n\nBeatty: See Beethoven.\n\nBechner: Ukrainian. Dutch factory, also? Ni.\n\nBechstein: This is a high-end instrument. Karl Bechstein worked for Pleyel (see entry) before setting out on his own. If I were buying a new piano for myself, I'd look at this one very seriously. Bechstein and Samick (Korea) entered a joint venture to raise capital for Bechstein (2003); after this financial goal was reached (2006), Samick was eased out. Technically, Samick is no longer associated with Bechstein, but I'd be cautious and get a tech's evaluation of pianos made during the Samick association. German.\n\nBecker, Jacob: Established 1841. Not the same as Bechner or Becker. Other brands: Baltica, Mignon, Tschaika, P. Brunner. Just say no. Russian.\n\nBecker: Not the same as Jacob Becker. See Kimball.\n\nBeckwith: Sold by Sears Roebuck. Made by Beckwith Piano & Organ Company (established late 1800s). Other Sears brands include Sears Roebuck & Co., American Home, Maywood, Beverley, and Caldwell, although Beckwith was the most popular brand Sears sold. Since it was sold via mail-order through the Sears catalog, presumably Beckwith were reasonably well-made (they had to trek across the U.S. by train or other sorts of transportation, after all). Of course, today they would be in a state of disrepair. Beckwith also made player pianos and reed organs. Also sold by Sears? At this point, a Beckwith piano certainly isn't playable; and doubtless is not worth putting any money into, even if it were brought to [temporary] playable condition. Don't bother unless you're a collector of Sears Roebuck memorabilia. American.\n\nBeethoven: It was the vogue, around 1900, to use composers' names as piano brand names. Beethoven was one of them. The most prominent builder of the Beethoven was Daniel F. Beatty Piano & Organ Company (Washington, New Jersey, founded 1869). What made Beatty's Beethoven notable was that he was one of the first piano manufacturers to sell by mail, aggressively mail-bombing with his advertising fliers. Rural areas were especially-favored areas, as these folks weren't likely to travel to a big-enough city to visit a piano showroom. (See Beckwith.) In 1892, Beatty's enterprise was taken over by Needham Piano Company. (See Needham.) Any Beethoven out of New Jersey probably is old enough not to sleep with the fishes but to have made the bed for the fishes. Pass. American.\n\nBehning: See Weber. Probably part of the Chinese \"startup\" using the Weber name. Possible stencil piano. Iffy, no matter which circumstance. No. Chinese.\n\nBeijing Xinghai: Controls Otto Meister, Heintzmann, Ellington, Wyman, Linden. No. Chinese.\n\nBelaruse: Terrible piano. It's the worst piano on the market, according to my tech (2006). Avoid. May control Schubert, Wieler names. Belarusian.\n\nBell: Flourished 1900-1920. Went out of business in 1924. Name bought by Lesage (Canada) and pianos with Bell name produced from 1960-1970. Later ones not good quality; earlier ones are warhorses. No. Canadian.\n\nBellaire: See Lester.\n\nBelmont: See Lesage.\n\nBentley: See Whelpdale Maxwell & Codd. Name bought by InterMusic. No. English.\n\nBergmann: See Young Chang and Pramberger. Verticals only. Entry level. No! You can do a lot better. Korean/Chinese.\n\nBerlin: Stencil piano. No. Korean.\n\nBettich (variously Matthias Bettich): This piano is undoubtedly Chinese. What part the Germans play in this is unknown. I'm guessing this is one of the many Chinese instruments that are given Eurpean names (German names are preferred). No. Chinese.\n\nBetting, Theodore: Established 1887 in Legnica (Poland). Factory fire in 1921 forced move to Leszno. World War II stopped production. New production in Germany in the former Seiler factory under former owner; this probably means good equipment and perhaps former Seiler technicians. Bechstein is in the mix somehow, having the factory make pianos under the Europa name. Supposedly Betting no longer manufactures pianos; the word on the street is that the company is owned by a member of the Schimmel (see separate entry) family. Probably limited U.S. availability and possibly only as used instruments, for the company may be out of business. Try it, if you can find one. Polish/German.\n\nBetting, Thomas: Possible corruption of Theodore Betting (above), but maybe not, as this Betting is owned by/owns the Schirmer & Son brand. This one, if it's a different company, probably isn't very good. In my research perambulations, however, I did find a reference (but no information) that linked Theodore Betting pianos to Schirmer. I don't know if these two brands are connected. I guess you'll have to find one and play it.\n\nBishop: No information on this one. It either isn't made anymore or.... No-go, even if you can find one; they're unknowns for a good reason.\n\nBlondel: No longer distributed in the U.S. Made by Bohemia. You might be able to locate a used one. Unknown quality. Czech.\n\nBlüthner: Very fine piano. I'd look at this one. Can be expensive. German.\n\nBohemia: After World War II, the Czech government lumped all Czech pianos under the name \"Petrof,\" since it was the best-known brand. After socialism fell to democracy (1989), the Bohemia name was restored to that company. Now (2005) owned by Bechstein. Good-to-very-good, especially after Bechstein took over. Czech.\n\nBösendorfer: Another ultra-high-end instrument. I'd certainly look at this one, also! Firm established in 1828 by Ignaz Bösendorfer. It quickly garnered accolades. Ignaz's son, Ludwig, took over when his father died. Ludwig had no children, so Carl Hutterstrasser bought the company (1909). Carl was followed by his sons. Bought jointly by Kimball (which now makes hotel and office furniture) and an Austrian bank (with Austrian government backing) in 1966. In 2002, it was bought by back and was purely Austrian again. Bösendorfer is the Austrian/Viennese piano company left, out of the hundreds in business in Vienna in the 1800s. Yes. Austrian.\n\nUpdate, 2007: Bösendorfer now owned by Yamaha.\n\nBösendorfer 290 \"Imperial\": I want to make a separate entry for this Bösendorfer instrument. The Imperial is unusual in several ways, not the least of which is its US$250,000  US$300,000 price tag (2015). The instrument is 9'6\" (290 cm - get it?) long. You need a biiiig room for this colossus! The length, the type of wood used (supposedly from the same forest as the wood used by Stradivarius), and the extra nine strings contribute to the exquisitely-rich sound of this instrument. At a suggestion/request in 1892 by Italian piano virtuoso, Ferruccio Busoni (1866-1924), the first Imperial was built. Busoni was well-known in his day for his piano transcriptions of Bach organ works, although they are not played much anymore because scholarship is greatly improved. The transcriptions are goopily Romantic, not at all Baroque. At any rate, Busoni was working on the Passacaglia in C Minor and was not satisfied with the pitches that the lowest notes the normal piano supplied. He wanted the \"subterranean\" pitches created by a 16'-rank of organ pipes. So, Busoni requested that Bösendorfer build a piano that had several lower notes, which Bösendorfer did. The Imperial has a full eight octaves: 97 notes (!), not 88. Below the A on a normal piano are nine more notes: G#, G, F#, F, E, D#, D, C#, and C. (For acoustic geeks, these are the \"missing notes\" of the sub-contra octave: C0, C#0, etc. C0 is 16 Hz.) Even though very, very few pieces call for these notes, their presence has a great influence on the upper partials of all the other notes on the piano. This acoustical phenomenon accounts for the unusually-rich sound of the Imperial. Another idiosyncratic aspect of the Imperial is that the added bass keys  naturals and well as sharps  are black in color. For almost all players, this brings about a case of 'what was that?' when the black-topped naturals are spotted in the peripheral vision. If you have an Imperial, I am sure you will learn to accommodate yourself to this visual perturbation! (Note: Some harpsichords have black-topped naturals, but they also have white-topped sharps. This is called a \"reverse keyboard.\" A reverse keyboard is not the same thing as the added notes on the Imperial keyboard. The Imperial's added notes are all black!) Another unusual aspect of the Imperial is that you can't dive \"for the lowest note\" on the piano and be assured it is an A because it's not an A!\n\nNote: Bösendorfer makes another piano with an extended bass range. The Bösendorfer 225 has 92 keys: down to sub-contra F (F0) \"only\". These added notes also are all black.\n\nBoston: Very good piano. This piano is made by Kawai. It was designed by and is marketed by Steinway, but not made by them - - this is not clear in their advertising! I'd look at this one, too. A Boston is better than a standard Kawai, even though it also is built in Kawai's Hamamatsu factory (not the Ryuyo factory). Verticals (44\"-52\") and grands. American.\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes: \"This is another piano I was seriously considering; a great value for the price, and there are a slew of late-model used instruments for sale out there. Action and sound very impressive for the size of the pianos (I tried the GP-156 at Steinway), and workmanship appeared very fine. But. . . the Boston verticals are made in Indonesia, and I have heard from two techs whove said to give them a pass. As for the Essex. . . yes, absolutely execrable piano. What in the world [was Steinway] thinking?\" See also his comments at Gaveau.\n\nBradbury (variously William Bradbury): See Lighte, F.C.; and Aeolian.\n\nBrambach: See Kohler & Campbell.\n\nBreitman: Made by Artfield Piano. No. Chinese.\n\nBrentwood: Made by Pearl River. No. Chinese.\n\nBrewster: See Foster-Armstrong.\n\nBriggs (variously C.C. Briggs): See Emerson.\n\nBroadwood: The company began as harpsichord-makers (1718). Probably the world's oldest keyboard instrument-maker (that's what my research has shown, at any rate!). The founder's daughter married Broadwood, who took over the business and started making pianos about 1775. Beethoven's Broadwood was a gift from the company (this particular piano was later owned by Liszt). The company, in a shrewd marketing move, also gave pianos to Chopin and Mendelssohn (and harpsichords to Handel and Haydn), as well as instruments to several royal houses of Europe. (Perhaps it was from Broadwood that Érard got the idea to give away his pianos to luminaries.) Antique instruments are available, also, through dealers, including \"boudoir\" (6'11\" to 7'6\" ) and \"cottage\" (5'8\") grands. Current production entirely verticals. I don't know anything about the quality of these pianos (the company no longer makes harpsichords), but they're likely to be good/very good since the company has been in continuous business for so long. English.\n\nUpdate, ~2008: Part of Whelpdale Maxwell & Codd, which is now out of business. A shame.\n\nBroadwood White: To show what a revered company Broadwood was (see entry), a number of companies founded by former Broadwood workers, appended their name to Broadwood's. This Mr. White took the appropriation a step further. His literature noted that Broadwood White was Broadwood's \"branch factory.\" I do not know how Mr. White's fortunes fared (or what Broadwood thought about his unautorized use of the name), but those with the wherewithal certainly bought real Broadwoods. Broadwood White made Frederick Dove's stable of pianos, even though Dove noted that his shop was associated with Broadwood. Hah! Now we know how! (See Dove.) These Broadwood Whites would be ancient beasts. Serve them afternoon tea in a drawing room that has dust mites dancing in shafts of golden late-afternoon sun. No. English.\n\nBrockport: See Kurtzmann.\n\nBrodmann: (Not to be confused with Broadwood.) I know nothing of the current quality of this piano. \"Vienna Edition\" and \"Professional Edition\" instruments are made in Vienna, and the \"Conservatory Edition\" is made \"in Asia\" (probably China). Historically, these instruments were highly prized. It was at the Brodmann firm that Ignaz Bösendorfer apprenticed. Try out this piano. You're likely to be pleased, but give special attention if the piano you are considering was made in China. Austrian/Chinese(?).\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes: \"When I was shopping for a grand piano, I tried out a 54 Brodmann (PE 162) in Faust Harrisons Manhattan showroom. These pianos are the result of a project initiated by the Bösendorfer people: high-quality European parts (actions, strings, pin blocks, soundboards, yadda yadda) are shipped to China for assembly. I was very impressed with the instrument, as was my lady friend, who is a serious, advanced pianist. The action was excellent, as was the tone, with the exception of what I thought was a slightly smudgy sound in the lower bass (most likely something that could be cured with judicious voicing). Given the price - - $15,000 list for this model - - I think it was an excellent value, and I was seriously considering a purchase when a tuner/tech friend offered me a very fine 1971 Baldwin M for a ridiculously low price. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new grand to give the Brodmanns a try.\"\n\nBurger & Jacobi: Established 1872 by Christian Burger in Switzerland. Herman Jacobi joined in 1875. The firm moved to Italy. Out of business in 1970s. Swiss. In 1990, the company was bought and moved to Czechoslovakia (Petrof factory?), then to Germany. Whether the factory is in Germany today, I don't know. Pianos are marked \"Made in Europe.\" Limited availability in the U.S. Maybe a good piano? Might be \"European\" parts assembled in Asia. Try one if you can find one. Various/Europe?\n\nBurnett & Co. manu. 361 Broadway, New York City. Cabaret: Player piano. See Aeolian.\n\nCable: The factory was established in 1900 in Chicago and made serviceable instruments, operating its own retail locations, as well. Made pianos and player pianos, barely surviving the Great Depression. Cable was one of the brands owned by Baldwin. Production ended in 1960. American Sejung, a Korean company, purchased the name in 1990. Current production is in China in America Sejung's factory there (Qingdao Sejung Musical Instruments). Cable may be in current production, but if the company exists, the pianos would be made in China or Indonesia. Be careful. Not the same as Hobart M. Cable pianos, and they're probably not even as good as those!\n\nCable, Hobart M.: Cheaply-made \"entry-level piano.\" Curiously, America Sejung Corp is a Korean company that produces pianos in its own factory in China. See Falcone and Hobart M. Cable. No! Chinese.\n\nCable-Nelson: See Cable.\n\nCanadian: See Lesage.\n\nCapen: See Kurtzmann.\n\nCarhart and Needham: Jeremiah Carhart, holder of accordion patents regarding air flow (1836), joined Elias Parkham Needham to form Carhart and Needham Piano Company (Worcester, MA, 1846). In 1848, the factory moved to New York City, moving into the building that had served as the piano factory of John B. Dunham (see entry); this factory location was used subsequently by other firms, including Marschall & Mittauer (see entry) and then Sohmer (see entry). Carhart's spirit of innovation continued when, in 1853, they made improvements to the melodeon (also called a pump organ or reed organ). A melodeon is a keyboard instrument whose sounds are created by air vibrating a metal reed, like the childhood trick blowing across the edge of a piece of grass. Carhart and Needham entered the instrument in the New York Crystal Palace Exhibition. I don't know if they won, but one of their competitors was the Gilbert Smith Piano Company (see entry). In 1855, Samuel Schwartz became a partner. The company was renamed Carhart, Needham and Co. Inventories and records show the trio worked with excellent materials and paid their employees handsomely. With Schwartz's death in 1865, the company's name reverted to Carhart and Needham. Three years later, in 1868, Carhart died. Needham changed the company name to E.P. Needham & Sons. In 1880, Needham retired, selling the company, including its patents, to Charles H. Parsons and E.J. Hartman. (I don't know what happened to the sons.) These gentlemen decided to start producing reed organs, as well as pianos. After all, they now owned some important patents. They changed the name to Needham Piano and Organ Co. The company's product is said to have a particularly even tone and a keyboard that was even in down weight. The company also operated as Beethoven Organ Company and Beethoven Piano and Organ Company (see entry). This is another historic piano and should not be considered for purchse today. American\n\nChase, A. B.: See Dongbei.\n\nCalisia: Factory established in Kalisz, Poland (1878) by Gustav Arnold Fibiger, whose father was a carpenter. Factory closed during WWI and resumed production after the war, but of furniture. In the early 1920s, the company resumed production of the Calisia piano. The Great Depression sent production into a tailspin. Then came WWII and the Soviet occupation of Poland. The company was nationalized (1945) and turned again to its modern core business: furniture. Around 1950, piano production was begun again. By the 1990s, the company was mired in debt, however. Several attempts were made to revive it through infusions of cash from private holding companies. In 2007, the Calisia factory closed. In 2010, the Calisia name was acquired by Vershold (which appears to be a company based in Poland that works with an Asian company to \"source\" materials from China, India, Vietnam, and other East and South Asian countries and to forward them to retailers worldwide). One of these items appears to be pianos. It appears to me that these instruments are made in Asia (China, probably). Almost certainly, the Polish expertise is entirely absent. If you found an old Calisia, it would doubtless need extensive restoration. I don't know what's going on with \"sourcing\" from China, but I'd say this piano is a no-go.\n\nCambridge: Established 1902, specializing in verticals (and players). Bought by Ricca & Son, Jacob Doll, and/or Winter? Discontinued 1941. Name bought by Story & Clark in the 1990s, but they were not built to Cambridge's original specs. You are unlikely to find this piano, which may be a blessing since it's probably not a good buy, especially after 1990s. See Aeolian.\n\nCanadian: See Lesage.\n\nCapen: See Kurtzmann.\n\nChavanne: In 1979, Vincent Chavanne decided to forego the career in physics, for which he was studying, in favor of instrument manufacturing. He seems to have worked in an American harpsichord house (I can't find out which one or any other details), then moved back to his native France (Toulouse) in 1981, where his aim was to build reproduction harpsichords. The market wasn't brisk, so in 1989, he turned his attention to pianos. Sold in Europe only. Doubt you find one in the U.S. unless it's being sold by a private party. Unknown quality. Play one and see what you think. French. (Note: The Chavanne retail store also appears to sell Seiler pianos. Chavanne also produces a digital piano, and, as far as I can tell, also produces a synth.)\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes, \"[Concerning] the Chavanne pianos you mention, I don't know anything of their quality personally, although the brand seems to have a good reputation [in France].\"\n\nChallen: These are Challen-ging pianos to play (I know; one too many puns for you to forgive me). Big no. Malaysian.\n\nChambers (variously Thomas Chambers): See Dubois.\n\nChanning: See Lester.\n\nChappell: Out of business. Obviously a no. English.\n\nChase, A.B.: Established about 1875. Swallowed by Aeolian. These instruments would be iffy, at best. In 2001, the A.B. Chase name resurfaced. It is being used as a line of Wrightwood Enterprises (see separate entry) pianos and manufactured by the ubiquitous Dongbei Piano Co. (see separate entry). Chase pianos were probably no better than mediocre in their heyday, and then they went downhill after Aeolian came on the scene. New ones may be of suspicious quality. No. Chinese.\n\nChester: See Waters.\n\nChickering (variously Chickering & Sons; Chickering Bros.): Founded in Boston (1823) by Jonas Chickering and James Stewart. Chickering came from cabinet-making background (starting in 1817), which explains the high quality of the Chickering's case. He then apprenticed with piano builder John Osborn, where he met Stewart. The two formed Stewart and Chickering. When Stewart left the partnership, the business was renamed Chickering Piano. Chickering's pianos were quick to gain prizes and endorsements for quality. In 1830, Chickering began a partnership with a sea captain (John McKay). The good cap'n was to deliver Chickering's pianos to the South American market and return with rosewood and other fine woods for the cases. John and his sons joined the Chickering crew, and the company was named Chickering and Makays [sic]. When Papa McKay and his ship were lost at sea (1841) and his sons were uninterested in continuing in the piano business, the company returned to the Chickering name. When Jonas died (1853), the business was taken up by his three sons. Besides manufacturing, these gentlemen also focused on marketing. In 1850, P.T. Barnum (the circus magnate) arranged for a famous European soprano (Jenny Lind) to make a U.S. tour; the piano chosen to travel with her was a Chickering. On opening night, Henry Steinway - - the Steinweg family had recently arrived from Germany and changed their name to Steinway - - was in attendance and was enthralled with the piano, to the point that his careful inspection impeded the timely raising of the curtain on Miss Lind's performance. Similarly, when the Chickering brothers made a gift to Liszt of one of their pianos - - hoping for his endorsement - - Liszt was similarly captivated, which lead to recommendations from other performers. After the death of the last brother (1896), Chickering Piano's fortunes took a turn for the worse because of a decline in quality. In 1908, the firm was propped up as part of the formation of American Piano Company, which was a consortium of piano manufacturers, including Knabe and Chickering. (See American Piano Company entry.) In 1929 (variously 1932), suffering fatal financial setbacks, American Piano Company was taken over by Aeolian. (Bear with me here!) Aeolian survived the Great Depression but succumbed to economic forces and closed in 1941, despite a last-ditch effort to sell a $500 player piano. Chickering was then purchased by Wurlitzer in 1983. Chickering pianos were made from 1986-1988 in the U.S. By this time, the quality of pianos from the once-superb Chickering firm had slid precipitously. When Baldwin bought Wurlitzer (1988), pianos with the Chickering name (I cannot bring myself to say \"Chickering pianos\") continued in production in Asia until 2009. Anything earlier than 1900, say, would be a warhorse. If you are interested, you might inquire of a tech what would be needed to bring it to playing condition. And if this particular instrument is a good candidate. Modern instruments are of very suspect quality (Chinese/Malaysia/Indonesian, probably) and thus might be struck from your list. Those \"in the middle\" are of varying quality. American/Chinese/etc.\n\nChickering, Jonas (not to be confused with Chickering): In what is a cruel twist, the name of Jonas Chickering, the man who founded the superb-quality Chickering brand, is being used on this poor-quality piano - - disrespect at its worst. Introduced in late 1980s to be an entry-level piano; you know what that portends. Name now part of Baldwin group (along with the real Chickering name). Baldwin did a house-cleaning of its less-successful brands. If Jonas Chickering pianos are still being made, they are doubtless from China. Not a good piano, no matter the provenance. Run; don't walk. China.\n\nChoiseul: May be stencil piano. Doubtful quality. Korean.\n\nChoplain: It appears Anthony Choplain worked as a \"dealer\" in a company called Dubreuil & Choplain (1854). (I don't know whether the Choplain in the company name is Anthony or a relative, possibly his father.) As far as I can figure out, Dubreuil & Choplain began as a retail firm selling different brands of pianos and then began building pianos. There are several examples of just this sort of transformation noted elsewhere in this file. In 1856, Choplain left the firm and joined forces with Amand Chatain to form the piano-building firm of Choplain & Chatain. In 1859, Choplain left the partnership and built under his sole name. One finds Choplain's name in association with Jean Laukota (see entry), who was also a piano maker. The two do not appear to be associated as business partners, but they may have shared manufacturing space for their separate brands.\n\nChoplain & Chatain: See Choplain.\n\nChristman: An antique piano. Factory began about 1885. Production stopped about 1930, doubtless because of the onset of the Great Depression. Have the instrument examined thoroughly before purchase; will need restoration, probably rebuilding. American.\n\nChurch (variously John Church): Firm established in Cincinnati in 1859. Any piano by this firm is likely no more than a pile of dust. No. American.\n\nClaritone: See Schaaf.\n\nClaviola: See Ludwig.\n\nClement: Henry A. Clement is listed as a \"piano maker\" in Philadelphia from 1820-1840. I am not sure whether he was a cabinetmaker for pianos or whether he manufactured pianos. You're unlikely to find one of these, so I guess it doesn't matter! If you do find one, it does matter: don't buy it. American.\n\nCline: See Young-Chang.\n\nCo-Op: See Amyl.\n\nColby: Established in Erie, Pennsylvania; also had an office in New York City. Did not survive the Great Depression. Any Colby you might find will be too decrepit to be worth restoring. No. American.\n\nColmann: Pianos manufactured in China (I don't know where). I can't find out anything more about this brand. Since so little information can be dredged up (maybe you'll have better luck!), I advise you to steer a very brisk course away from it. This is not a case of no-news-is-good-news. It's no-news-means-bad-news. Chinese.\n\nConcerto: See Lesage.\n\nConcord: See Lesage.\n\nConover: Now part of Aeolian family. Other lines in the Conover cupboard: Kingsbury, Wellington, and Schiller. You are unlikely to be delighted. American.\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes: \"Believe it or not, the 92nd St. YMCA, which has one of the best music programs in the country for adults and kids, has one of these in one of its main recital rooms. Talk about a pile of poop. My theory is that it was donated by a benefactor who didnt know any better, so now the school is stuck with it. At one point, Middle C didnt play (!). These are made by Samick, possibly in Indonesia, and no longer available in the U.S., but if you really, really want one, you can buy it in Australia and have it shipped.\" [mb: No ringing endorsement here! Break out the shovel!]\n\nConover Cable: See Conover.\n\nConn: See Krakauer; see Kimball; see Janssen.\n\nCor[o]nado: See Starr.\n\nContinental Euro: See Lesage.\n\nContinental Piano Company:\n\nCook, James F. (variously J.F. Cook): Indiana piano dealer active at the turn of the 20th century. In a curious \"reverse-stencil\" turn, Cook arranged with Foster-Armstrong to build a better quality (!) piano than Foster-Armstrong was turning out for other instrument lines (see separate Foster-Armstrong entry). Although J.F. Cook pianos seem to have been of a higher quality than the other Foster-Armstrong instruments, any surviving instrument is likely to need an overhaul even to be playable. Cook seems to have gone out of business around 1920. Foster-Armstrong became part of Aeolian about this time, and Aeolian continued to make pianos under Cook brand. That tells you something about later-20th century production! Because old ones would be basically unplayable and Aeolian brought the touch of death to all the piano companies it acquired, avoid any piano with the Cook name. American.\n\nCristofori Niemeyer (variously Niemeyer): See Dongbei. Possibly related to the Opus name, also by Dongbei. No. Chinese.\n\nCraig: See Lesage.\n\nCumberland: See Starr.\n\nCurrier: Established 1823 in Boston (Currier & Company). Both Adams presidents (John and John Quincy) had Currier pianos. Current factory located in Marion, North Carolina. One of the selling points mention in the company's literature is that their \"Curriercote\" finish withstands even \"a smoldering cigarette.\" This is North Carolina, but, really, now, does that sound like a selling point for a piano? Close to the bottom of the pond. Swim away. American.\n\nCWS: See Amyl.\n\nDaytron: First pianos debuted in 1981. Made in Saujin (Sojin?) piano factory (owned by Daewoo). This is probably not an intelligent purchase. Korean.\n\nDaewoo (variously Sojin, Daewoo Sojin, Sojin Daewoo; possibly Saujin): Daewoo has its fingers in a lot of things, including pianos. Their piano factory is in Saujin, near Seoul. One of their brand names (see also Daytron) is Sojin. This instrument was not even a moderate quality, and Daewoo shut down the factory in 1991. It was reopened in 2005; I would be suspicious of quality, however. Korean.\n\nDecker Brothers: Established in New York in 1862 by John and David Decker. The instruments were judged (by the New York Times) to be the same quality as Steinway. The brothers were awarded several patents, including how the tuning pin sits in the pin block. The company folded in 1900 when John died. Supposition is that had John not died, the Decker brand name would be breathed in the same exhalation as Steinway. These pianos would be dinosaurs in need of a lot of work. Not feasible. American.\n\nDecker & Barnes Myron A. Decker was one of the founders of the famous Decker & Son Piano Company (not to be confused with Decker Brothers) of New York. Myron A. Decker was born in 1823 in Ontario County, New York. In 1844, he started a 4 year apprenticeship with the firm of A. VanWinkle, then subsequently went to work in Albany for Boardman & Gray. In 1856 Myron A. Decker established his own firm at 45 Church Street, Albany, New York. Myron Decker returned to New York City in 1863 and continued to build pianos under his own name. In 1866, he changed the name of his firm to 'Decker & Company', but this firm was dissolved in 1867. Decker continued to build pianos under his own name with much success, and was able to expand to new, larger factories at 119 Third Avenue in 1868. In 1871, Myron Decker went into partnership with J. C. Barnes, forming the firm of 'Decker & Barnes'. Decker & Barnes continued with much success until the death of Barnes' wife in 1877, causing Barnes to withdraw from the firm. Decker continued building pianos under his own name again until 1882 when he took his son, Frank C. Decker, into partnership, forming the firm of Decker & Son. Myron A. Decker died in 1901, and his son Frank incorporated the firm in 1909. Decker & Son is one of the few American piano manufacturers to survive the Great Depression, and they continued to build pianos until about 1949. Pianos by this firm are consistently of very good quality and are among some of the finest instruments we see come through our shop. Dove, Frederick & Sons (variously F. Dove & Sons): Begun as a firm that re-felted piano hammers, Dove decided to get into the business of making the whole instrument. The instruments were either good enough or cheap enough for others to use them as stencil pianos: Godball, Logan, Laurence, Milne, Johnson, and McKinzie. There is some evidence that Dove hired out the whole kit and kaboodle to Broadwood White. Talk about stencil pianos! Dove instrument would be too old to consider. See also Broadwood White. No. English.\n\nDeVoe & Sons: See Kimball.\n\nDiapason: Introduced in 1948 and produced by Kawai. As far as I can gather, Kawai spun off the company (see following note from a reader). Whether Diapason's fortunes then went into steep decline or whether they weren't very good when Kawai was making them, I don't know. They seem to be in current production in Japan. Unknown whether this is a piano with the original Diapason specs or whether the Diapason name being used by another manufacturer. (See Kawai.) No go. Japanese.\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes: \"The name Diapason was/is a name used for pianos manufactured by Kawai in their Hamamatsu factory [the \"better\" factory is in Ryuyo - mb]. I think the sticker brand was/is totally owned by Kawai. If that is the case, I don't understand the rationale behind building these pianos, as they really are of inferior quality. A church I used to work for has a 7-ft. Diapason, and it is one of the worst instruments I have seen.\"\n\nDietmann: Dietmann Klavier was perhaps a German firm, initially. I don't know. The instruments now are assembled in South Africa. Other lines: Otto Bach, Bernhard Steiner. No. South African.\n\nDiminutive: See Smith & Barnes.\n\nDoherty: See Sherlock-Manning.\n\nDoll, Jacob & Sons. Established 1871, taken over by his sons upon his death. Went out of business in 1931. Brands associated with Doll include Norris & Hyde, C.C. Briggs, Wentworth, Edward Mason, Wellsmore, Cambridge, Merrill, and Baus. These would be old pianos and probably not in good enough condition to warrant the sizeable restoration needed. No. American.\n\nDongbei: One of largest factories in China and makes a number of brands (Nordiska, Elkstrom, Prince, Princess, Opus, and Cristofori Niemeyer). Beware, be very beware! China.\n\nDraper Brothers (variously Draper Brothers & Reid): See Sherlock-Manning.\n\nDubois: It is unclear whether Dubois ever put hands to the wood plane but was the money man and business guru for several different craftsmen/groups. At least early on, it appears Dubois enriched many companies through various business partnerships. These later split and reorganized with other partners, not unlike a square dance jamboree. Born in the Caribbean, he [his family?] moved to New York, where Dubois started a business as a piano importer (between the U.S. and England), retailer, and music publisher. Dubois must have been a very skilled - - and perhaps charismatic - - businessman because he attracted the attention of John Jacob Astor. The Astor family was originally from Germany. Bruder Georg moved to London, anglicized his name, and began making musical instruments (including pianos, at this early point). Johann Jakob joined him and later emigrated to the U.S. to join Bruder Heinrich's business; Johann Jakob also served as his London brother American agent for the music instrument business. Whether as a buy-in or a gift, Dubois found himself taking over Astor's instrument import house in 1789, as Astor turned his attention to his fur-trading ventures. At the time Dubois took over the Astor import enterprise, pianos were in the inventory. The pianos sold well, so Dubois decided to manufacture the instruments. Astor figured in Dubois' charmed business life again, as it appears Astor provided the financial backing for Dubois to go into business with well-known pianomaker Adam Stodart (see entry), forming Dubois & Stodart in 1822. Dubois may have contributed some of his own money to the start-up. (The import business either folded or was bought by someone else.) At one point in the square dance, Dubois and Stodart contracted with the piano firm of R&W Nunns (see entry) to make some of their pianos. (I think that Dubois and Stodart also made pianos for their own company, so there were two \"brands\" in the Dubois and Stodart inventory. In 1834, Dubois left the partnership and joined with George Bacon (see Bacon and Raven), a well-respected piano maker and probably a step up in knowledge from Stodart (see sole entry) to form Dubois & Bacon. Perhaps how he got top billing in the name was probably because of his financial contribution? In 1836, Thomas Chambers (see entry) joined them, and the firm became Dubois Bacon & Chambers. This partnership lasted until 1840. At this point, Dubois elected to go out on his own, perhaps because he understood the business well enough not to need a partner/someone more well-versed than he in how to make pianos. In 1843, he took on a partner (Charles Seabury), but that firm was disbanded just a year later. Dubois returned to building pianos with only his name on them, working alone until 1850, when he entered into his final partnership, this time with Daniel Charles Warriner. The firm was now Dubois & Warriner. I cannot find anything on Warriner's background except that his family was from Boston. It could be that he apprenticed in a piano factory there since there were several. Dubois' name falls from the professional records about 1853, but Warriner continued (renaming the company? but why?) until about 1863. He passed away in 1894, but the business seems to have preceded him in death.\n\nDuchess: See Starr.\n\nDunham (variously Dunham & Sons; also Stodart, Worcester and Dunham): John B. Dunham (born 1799) apprenticed as a cabinet-maker, working up and down the Atlantic Seaboard, settling in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1834, he moved to New York City and secured a job as a case-maker at the Nunns, Clark and Company piano firm. (See entry.) In 1836, he entered joined Adam Stodart (see entry) and Horatio Worcester as the junior partner in Stodart, Worcester and Dunham Piano Company. Dunham must have risen to the star of the show, for he decided to employ a well-respected piano designer (Frederick Mathushek), who made important changes in the way the square piano was strung. According to an 1852 newspaper article, this innovation brought the firm adulation \"from Maine to Georgia, not to mention California and other remote places.\" Indeed! In addition to the now-patented stringing design, Dunham's factory was steam-powered. In 1857, Stodart and Nunn seem to have left the house, as the concern was renamed Dunham & Sons. Upon Dunham's death, the name changed to Dunham Piano-Forte Manufacturing (1882), then Dunham Piano Company (1889). The company was in business in 1890; it is not known what happened after that. As you can guess, any Dunham piano would be a square/antique instrument and not worth rebuilding. See also Dubois. No. American.\n\nDuo/Art: See Aeolian player pianos.\n\nEinstein: I don't know anything about this piano. I am guessing that it is either one of the venerable warhorses built by one of the approximately 1800 piano companies flourishing in early twentieth-century America; or a modern Chinese instrument with a \"fake German name.\" None of this augers well, relatively or not. Chinese?\n\nEisenberg: See Steinberg.\n\nEllington: Part of the Baldwin group (now owned by Gibson). The company originated in Cincinnati, Ohio, and seems to have gone out of business about 1930, doubtless another victim of the Great Depression. Baldwin has not continued production. Likely these pianos are suspect, possibly being made in Asia. American.\n\nEavestaff: See Yantai Perzina.\n\nEbel, Carl: See Yantai Perzina.\n\nElkstrom: See Dongbei.\n\nEllington: See Baldwin.\n\nElysian: No information on this one except place of manufacture. Likely a stencil piano, and these are nearly always bad buys. Korean.\n\nUpdate, 2014: A reader writes: \"I'm a regulator, and I'd just like to add something to your list. Elysians were made by Young Chang. They aren't bad pianos for the entry level, having regulated a fair few. They were made for a company called Robert Morley and Co. in Lewisham in southeast London. Just thought you'd like some extra information; I also own one myself.\"\n\nEmerson: Company founded in Boston in 1849 by William P. Emerson. His initial instruments were priced to sell, and business was brisk. In 1854, respected piano-maker Charles C. Briggs (who later founded his own piano firm) was induced to join the company to improve the quality of the instrument, which it seems he was able to do in spades, such that the Emerson brand acquired quite a patina, with a reputation as a \"sweet-toned\" piano. Emerson died in 1971; a William Moore took over the company. Public records show that the company became a partnership with Joseph W. Ellingwood in 1872. At some later point, it became Moore's sole proprietorship. The years 1879-1881 are shrouded, but by 1882, the Emerson Piano Company was once again a partnership: George W. Carter (the factory's foreman), Patrick H. Powers (who was Moore's assistant, starting in 1878), O. A. Kimball (I don't know yet whether he is connected to the Kimball Piano Co.), and Joseph Gramer (a recently-arrived German immigrant who was a partner with Gustavus A. Miller in a piano company and also had been factory foreman for Emerson). In 1883, Carter dropped out of the picture. As to Gramer, his name is associated with Emerson Piano; I'm not sure how, but he seems to have been granted two patents regarding piano production and/or design. Whether he produced pianos under his own name or, rather, \"Gramer\" was a line of the Emerson factory is not known. (Note: Briggs eventually went off to found his own company, as I noted, after first being in partnership with George Guild. That's another story. Or two.) Emerson instruments were characterized by exotic woods and detailed carving (which you would expect in the midst of the Victorian era) and, after Briggs came on board, had a reputation for quality. World War II spelled the end of the company. As far as I can follow the byzantine path of this piano firm, it appears that it was sold to United Piano (possibly a British firm), then American Piano, and finally to Aeolian. Aeolian production began about 1964. Production seems to have stopped entirely in 1983. I can't find any information on the quality of the instruments of the Aeolian era. Given Aeolian's track record, I'd say these pianos are only fair, if that good. Early Emersons might be worth restoring (read: expensive) if the antique value of the instrument appeals to you. Later ones may not be, especially those built after 1930, as they came from the Aeolian factory. Unlikely to be a good buy. American.\n\nÉrard: Starting as a harpsichord builder in the mid-1700s, Sebastian Érard turned to pianos but saw his new business crushed by the French Revolution. (Yes, this company has been around a long time!) The family decamped to London and opened a piano factory there. In 1796, Érard returned to Paris and re-opened his factory (1802). Part of the family, however, stayed in London to operate the English factory. Érard holds a large number of patents for important improvements to the piano, dealing mainly with the action, particularly the escapement (1808). These improvements are industry standards today. After Sebastian died, the company was taken over by his nephew, Pierre. Pierre was never one to shy away from a marketing opportunity. He made sure royal families (Queen Victoria, Napoléon) and musical luminaries (Mendelssohn, Verdi, Liszt, Beethoven, Chopin, Fauré, Haydn) received gifts of his instruments. Érard built a square piano in 1877. The Érard tone color could not hold its own against the powerful sounds of pianos of the early 1900s and so fell from popularity. In 1960, Érard merged with Gaveau. In 1961, Érard and Pleyel joined forces. In 1971, Érard/Pleyel was sold to Schimmel. Schimmel, in turn, was sold to Yamaha in 2007 (see Yamaha). Any instruments from Pierre's reign would be museum pieces. I would think production from the Érard/Pleyel period through the early 2000s would be decent instruments, but I don't know. Schimmel went into bankruptcy in 2009, so you might reasonably expect quality issues, starting about 2006. See Schimmel for further peregrinations of the Schimmel piano. See also Gaveau and Rameau. See reader remarks following Gaveau review. French/German/Japanese.\n\nEssex: Pretty awful piano. This is the entry level instrument of the \"Steinway\" line. It was built by Young Chang (which was acquired by a Chinese firm, Hyundai Development Company), but, in 2005, Pearl River took over production. The Boston is the price- and quality-point between the Essex and Steinway (the Boston isn't built in the Steinway factory, either; see Boston entry). Specs for the Essex are by Steinway, as well as advertising and distribution. The Pearl River factory, where the Essex is made, also makes stencil piano brands (\"house brands\" at Jordan Kitts Music, Sherman Clay, and Schmitt Music piano stores). Therefore, you might be getting a piano not very different from other pianos built in this factory (ahem), even though you're buying the Steinway name and having the pleasure of paying for Steinway's advertising. I'd be very hesitant, to the point of coming to a standstill. You can certainly get a better piano for the same price. Verticals and baby grands. Chinese.\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes: \"As for the Essex. . . yes, absolutely execrable piano. What in the world [was Steinway] thinking?\"\n\nEstey: You are unlikely to find any of these pianos. Ever. Anywhere. The company originated as an organ company. The founder was trained as a plumber and evidently succeeded at several businesses! Skip, not that you'll have a choice in the matter! American.\n\nUpdate, 2012: A reader wrote me, \"I found one!\"\n\nEstonia: Fine piano. The company was founded in 1903 and had its factories destroyed in the general turmoil of the Soviet Union, but the company has been resurrected by a doctoral piano graduate of the Julliard School. Grands only. Estonian.\n\nEterna: Built by Yamaha, which discovered the quality was so bad it wouldn't sell. The instruments were then sold in China but withdrawn. This tells you about the quality! Noooo! Japanese.\n\nEuropa: See Thomas Betting.\n\nEuterpe: Production started 1949. Appears to have bought several other German brands: W. Hoffmann, Feurich, F. Kuhla. Unknown quality. Perhaps available only in Europe. German.\n\nEverett: Founded 1883 in Boston. Merged with Cable-Nelson in 1926. In 1962, Hammond Organ Company bought the firm. In 1973, Yamaha purchased the company. Yamaha contracted with Baldwin to make the piano from 1986-1989. Now made by Dongbei in China and Macao (see Wrightwood Enterprises). In a word, a very short word: no. Chinese.\n\nFalcone: Factory founded in 1980 in Boston. Falcone sold to ASC, a Korean conglomerate that also manufactures textiles and has information technology and building construction arms (2001). The chairman of this conglomerate decided to make pianos and built a factory in China to build them (Qingdao Sejung Musical Instruments). Current instruments are built in China, under supervision of people with experience at Young-Chang and Samick. Somehow Mason & Hamlin is involved; not sure how. Early Falcones (American-made only) can be good instruments. These days, it's probably an ok-to-poor piano. Be careful. See also Samick and Young-Chang. Chinese.\n\nUpdate, 2011: Falcone pianos are no longer in production, but Mason & Hamlin currently owns the name.\n\nFandrich & Sons (variously Fandrich): Made in China, Czech Republic, Germany, Korea (Hyundai), and U.S.! With such a far-flung manufacturing setup, it would be difficult to maintain consistent (and good) quality. No! Various.\n\nFazer: No longer imported into the U.S. (Why?) Company now owned by Hellas Piano. Unknown quality. You probably won't find one in the U.S., so don't lose sleep! Finnish.\n\nFazioli: Fine piano. Expensive. You won't be disappointed. Italian.\n\nFeinton: At one time built in North Korea (!). How or why it is exported, I don't know. For some reason, it has only 86 keys (?); the maker says it's \"small but excellent.\" I rather doubt this. Owned and manufactured by PACO; may be sold under this brand. Possibly out of business. No, no, no! South Korean/Japanese/North Korean/Martian?\n\nFeurich: Firm established mid-1850s. Bought by Euterpe. Good to very good. German.\n\nFischer (variously Fischer, J & C): One of Baldwin's lines (Baldwin is now part of Gibson), by way of Aeolian. (See Foster-Armstrong.) No longer in production. That tells you something. Pass by this one. American.\n\nFörster (variously August Förster): I know very little of this piano. The company was \"hidden\" during the partition of Germany, and production must have slowed and/or it was difficult to sell the pianos beyond the border. Good? Very good? Really good? You'll have to play one. German.\n\nUpdate #1, 2013: From a reader: \"I just wanted to let you know that in my European experience, Förster is considered to be an excellent piano. (Especially those from before 1945, before the Bohemian factory in Georgswalde/Jirikov was nationalized after the communist takeover in Czechoslovakia.) I have friends who specialize in antique piano restoration, own one Förster, and intimately know the one owned by my aunt here in Bratislava. The bass is remarkably good, and the sound of this 1936 upright I have is fantastic - better perhaps than my 1891 Bluthner 6'1\" grand piano. When my friend, the antique piano restorer, saw this upright, he said it was a \"rocket; it'll keep going long after we're all gone!\"\n\nUpdate #2, 2013: Another reader writes: \"A friend of mine, a professional pianist, also plays organ and piano for a local church. Some years ago, the church acquired a Förster; a 64 I believe. My friend has played many, many pianos over the years; and he declares this Förster an absolutely topnotch instrument. With the reunification of Germany (and the re-privatization of the company) theyve become pretty expensive, though.\"\n\nFoster: See Foster-Armstrong.\n\nFoster-Armstrong: Piano manufacturers Foster & Co. and Armstrong merged to form Foster-Armstrong (about 1900). Not only did they build under their names, but also: Haines Bros., Fischer, Holmes & Sons, Brewster, Franklin, Marshall & Wendell, and Stratford. In addition, they built stencil pianos for an Indiana piano dealer named James F. Cook. (See Cook. Also Martin.) These are all antique pianos and are not worth restoring. About 1920, the firm was sold to Aeolian. Aeolian continued to make some of these brands, but I'd still avoid them. American.\n\nFranklin: See Foster-Armstrong.\n\nFrench, Jesse & Sons: Bought by Stark. Obscure and for good reason. American.\n\nFrench Provincial: See Lesage.\n\nG. Schaff: See Schaff.\n\nGaveau: Company founded in 1847. Made by Pleyel. Probably not. French.\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader sheds light on French pianos: \"I grew up in France and know these pianos well. The Gaveau never went out of favor. As a matter of fact, the vertical Gaveau pianos from the Belle Epoque and all the way to WWII are said to be among the best uprights ever made, along with the Érard of the same period. To this day, a vertical Gaveau or Érard from that period holds its value and if rebuilt or in great condition is a sought-after instrument in Europe. They were among the tallest of the ones made in Europe. The grands and baby grands were also excellent and were considered on par with the best German pianos. Thus, I would really advise your readers to look carefully at French pianos from that vintage (from 1900 to 1940). Have a technician looking at the piano, in any case. But I have not found many that were bad. I was looking at pianos lately in order to replace mine and if any old Gaveau or Érard of that vintage had been available in my area, I would have considered it. After the war (WWII), the all-around quality was good, although I am not sure if it was at the same level it was prior to WWII.\" Also: \"The Gaveau concert grands (9 ft.) were considered among the best concert grands on the European circuits, and some can still be found in the U.S. I have played some of them when I was younger, and they were truly exceptional. They were not as bright as Steinways and not as mellow as Bosendorfers. Their voicing and the balance in all the registers was also exceptional. I don't know much about the quality of the other grands from 1945 to 1985. I heard that some of them were excellent but that - as was in the case with verticals - the quality became uneven around the early '60s. The French pianos built by Steinway starting in 1963-1964 were in fact 'sticker pianos' [stencil brands]. They were Schimmels, but like all Schimmels at that time, their quality was not equal.\" See also Rameau.\n\nGebrüder Perzina: See Yantai Perzina.\n\nGennett: See Starr.\n\nGerhard: Appears to be an American company. I can't find any information on it. It must have been a forgettable piano! Keep looking. American.\n\nGerh[ard] Steinberg: See Yantai Perzina.\n\nGodball: See Dove.\n\nGilbert: Probably a stencil piano. No. Korean.\n\nGilbert & Sons: (also variously T. Gilbert, Currier & Gilbert) As the company was founded in 1834, I'd be surprised if one of these pianos were still in existence, let alone on the market! Should you stumble upon one, get hold of your balance and keep walking. On the plus side: Mr. Gilbert's home and piano factory were both important stops on the Underground Railroad. American.\n\nGoetz & Company: See Sterling.\n\nGodfrey: Low quality for mass market. Probably even the cabinetry isn't good! No. Country of origin?\n\nGram: Founded in 1883. Early instruments were considered good quality; any instruments around today would likely be in shambles. Other lines from Gram factory include Harvard, Lyra, and Link. Gram merged with Richtsteig (1914) to form Gram-Richtsteig. This company was bought by Haddorff (1924), but the company continued to build Gram pianos under the Gram name; the Gram-Richtsteig as a separate line seems to have disappeared. See also Haddorff. American.\n\nGram-Richtsteig: See Gram.\n\nGramer: Seems to have been either built in the William Emerson factory as a Gramer or as a line of Emerson. Gramer was granted two patents on piano action. More information under Emerson. No. American.\n\nGrand: Founded 1961 in Morgantown, North Carolina. Designed to be a \"mass market\" instrument, so the quality could not have been anything other than pedestrian-to-poor. Nobody knows what happened to the company. Guess those boots were made for walkin' - and the whole company just walked on out the door. No. American.\n\nGrau, Otto: Piano dealer in Cincinnati, Ohio, around turn of twentieth century; may have made stencil pianos. I'd pass. American.\n\nGrinnell: Pianos were manufactured starting in the early 1900s, though the company started in the 1880s as a reed organ firm. American. Samick (Korea) has built some pianos for Grinnell in the mid-1990s. Look elsewhere. Korean.\n\nGross & Holskamp: See Gross & Hulskamp.\n\nGross & Hulskamp (incorrectly Gross & Holskamp): Located in Troy, New York. The company was founded perhaps in the early 1840s (I'm guessing, based on the date of the Thalberg visit, below) by Jacob Gross and G. Henry Hulskamp. Both men were highly skilled. The company said its new smaller square piano, designed by Hulskamp, \"may be placed more conveniently in parlors than a square piano\" and had \"various important improvements by which performers can express musical sentiments with the most astonishing perfection.\" In 1857 after having just finished a tour performance in nearby Saratoga, New York, renowned pianist Sigismond Thalberg visited the factory and agreed to play on the new design. According to the Troy Whig, Herr Thalberg paid it \"the highest compliments by favoring\" Gross & Hulskamp with the use his name on the instrument. While doubtless excellent in its day, an instrument today would be beyond repair. American.\n\nGrotrian: Fine piano. Also on the high end. German.\n\nGulbransen: Related to Story & Clark. Company founded as a player piano firm (1904), making organs, starting in 1928. At some point (1930s?), pianos without the player mechanism were introduced. It is unknown whether the action used in this piano was simply the player action or an [improved] real action. The firm has taken many side roads. There are nickelodeons (\"band-in-a-piano-case\"), a \"player violin,\" and a bottle organ (!). In 2003, Gulbransen was acquired by QSR, owner of Story & Clark (modern). Gulbransen, now made in Pennsylvania, markets a player piano, made so by a wireless MIDI feature (\"Pianomation\"). The player violin may be paired with the player piano (how's that for automated fun?). The Story & Clark PNOScan is more sophisticated and has Internet connectivity (see below). Both brands are owned by QSR. Idiosyncratic; you might like it or you might not. American/Chinese.\n\nHaines Brothers (possibly same as Haines): Founded 1851. Swept up in the American Piano Company (see entry) consolidation. Any remaining instruments would be antiques needing much restoration. No. American.\n\nHaddorff: Went out of business in 1930s. Owned Gram line. No. American.\n\nHandok: A real jumble of parts - some from Germany, some from England, some from Japan, some from Korea. Mercy! A selling point from the company brochure: \"No particleboard or recycled by-products are used in the cabinet.\" This is enough to entice a buyer? We all want to be green, but... Mercy me! Mercy no! Korean.\n\nHailun: As far as I can tell, this piano does not get high marks. I definitely would not consider it and would continue to look. This company also uses other brand names, such as Steigerman (see Steigerman). The differences seem to be about the type of wood chosen and the manufacturer of portions of the action. (See also Wendl & Lung.) No. Chinese.\n\nUpdate, 2012: I am informed by two readers (a very testy dealer and a somewhat-less-testy owner) that my opinion of the Hailun is wrong and out of date. According to them: a substantial amount of money has been poured into the company, raised through an IPO, and spent on craftspeople, materials, and a modern factory; as a result, the quality of the pianos has improved greatly. Further, I am informed that the Hailun Model 198 grand is a very good instrument and an excellent value for size and price. You may want to look at this instrument if you wish a grand. I have not played it. As to Hailun's other lines, well, they're better than Pearl River.\n\nUpdate, 2013: A reader writes, \"Some Chinese pianos are very good and are subjected to rigorous European or U.S. quality evaluations on site or after export to Europe or the U.S. The Hailun piano is an interesting case. It is the only Chinese piano not to bear a German-sounding name but bears the name of its founder and owner. Everyone who has tried them will tell you that they are good pianos and not pianos to avoid at all, especially given their cost. I tried one today, a 5'11\" grand model, and I was really pleasantly surprised. The dealer had not done much preparation work on the instrument, which in my opinion needed a good voicing. The bass was a bit too tiny and the treble too bright to my taste, but the action was amazing: responsive and fast, not too light, not too heavy. I always try the action with the Ravel's \"Toccata\" from the Tombeau de Couperin. That grand is the equivalent of a Yamaha C3 (I think) but at less than half the price; and it is a very comparable instrument. Everything I have read and heard from recent Hailun pianos has been unequivocally positive, even coming from the toughest critics. We will see how well those pianos fare with time. I have to admit that if I had a limited budget, I would consider buying a Hailun for $18,000 (SMRP $23,000) instead of a Yamaha or Kawai (around $50,000).\"\n\nHaines: See Foster-Armstrong. Perhaps the same as Haines Brothers?\n\nHaines Brothers: Founded 1851. Lines included vertical and grands. This is another antique piano and doubtless not worth restoring. Possibly part of Foster-Armstrong. No. American.\n\nHallet [&] Davis: Established 1839, so this is a very old company. Ok to not-so-ok. You probably should pass on this one, even though Pope Pius X selected this brand for the Vatican. Also see Guild. American. Name appears to have been bought by Dongbei. Supposedly some of this new production is decent. Your call. Chinese.\n\nHamilton: See Baldwin.\n\nHampton: See Story & Clark.\n\nHanil: Stencil piano. No. Korea or China.\n\nHardman: The original company (established in 1852) eventually became a division of Aeolian, which went out of business in 1985. Hardman is a brand of Aeolian's player piano division. I don't know if Hardmans were player pianos exclusively or whether some did not have the mechanism. The name has been purchased recently (by whom?), and these pianos are being manufactured in China. Very cheaply-made piano. Expect the same quality. Eliminate this brand from your search. Chinese.\n\nHardman Peck: You won't find many of these, as they were manufactured at the turn of the 20th century and thus tend to be in pretty poor shape. Be sure to ask your technician to give you a very close estimate for repair/renovation costs. Almost surelt a no. American.\n\nHardy & Sons: See Lesage.\n\nHarwood: Pianos date from around 1900. This could be one brand that fell victim to the Great Depression Extinction. The Harwood is often associated with J.W. Jenkins and Sons music store in Kansas City, Mo., and may have been made particularly for them to sell. If so, it's one of the earliest stencil brands! If you found one, I can't believe that it would be playable or worth restoring! It may be that the name has been optioned (bought? \"appropriated\"?) by an Asian firm, in which case I would be very careful about quality. Take a pass on this one. No. American/Ch"
