        "text": "Index\n\nEstey Organ Music\n\nOrgan Roll Catalog\n\nEstey Organ Roll Catalog Volume 1\n\n(Published circa 1925)\n\nHTML copy: Produced by David Back. August 2017.\n\nFrom an original copy of \"A Catalogue of Music for the ESTEY ORGAN\"\n\nThis document is searchable.\n\n1.0 THE ESTEY RESIDENCE ORGAN\n\nOf all the musical instruments produced by man the three most distinguished are the violin, the piano and the pipe organ. Of these the violin still remains the instrument of the virtuoso. No method of playing it has yet been invented except by the slow and tedious process of acquiring technique. It is the instrument of the accomplished musician.\n\nBut self-playing devices have been applied successfully to both the piano and the organ-but with this difference. Piano music derives some of its quality from the personality of the player. The touch of human fingers has never been exactly reproduced by mechanical devices. In some compositions the piano player equals the pianist, but not in all.\n\nThe pipe organ, on the contrary, is made for automatic playing. There is nothing the organist can do with his hands or his feet that cannot be duplicated by machinery. When an organ manual is touched the resulting tone is the same, whether the touch be hard or soft, slow or quick. The tone continues in the same volume until the key is released. Brilliancy, variety and other differentqualities are obtained by other sets of pipes, and these pipes are brought into play by the stops. These stops can be brought on at the proper place by mechanical power just as effectively as by human fingers. If the organ music is correctly cut in the music roll, with all the stops, couplers and swells operated at their proper places, the most delicate ear cannot distinguish between the human organist and the mechanical organist.\n\nMoreover, there is a quite general belief among musical people that the organ is the greatest musical instrument. It embraces all the instruments of the orchestra-even the violin and the piano. It approximates the human voice with wonderful fidelity. It has qualities which no other instrument has; tones which no other instrument produces.\n\nRealizing all these things, we set about making this great instrument furnish the music of the home. We have been organ builders for several generations. We knew the qualities of the organ. We knew its history. It has been installed in homes, great baronial halls, palaces, castles in the past. But then it required the services of a resident organist. Nor was it in those days so great an instrument as it is today. Bach wrote organ music which could not be played upon the organ as he knew it. But he also knew the organ would develop. It has. Not only did it develop musically as Bach dreamed. It attained possibilities Bach never dreamed. By means of the self-playing device anyone may now play upon the pipe organ Bach's most difficult composition.\n\nThat is why we commenced to build the Estey Residence Organ. In a country like this, with its rapidly increasing wealth, its new homes of an almost palatial character being built daily, the necessary cost of a pipe organ was negligible when weighed beside its possibilities. Features were being added to these homes whose only purpose was to heighten the pleasurable richness of living in them, that cost as much as the most complete pipe organ.\n\nOur belief has been justified. The Estey Residence Organ is more and more becoming a part of the furnishing of the well-appointed house. It gives to its proud owner the control of an orchestra-not the passive pleasure of listening to a paid professional organist, not the occasional performance of some musical guest, but his own instrument that he plays at will, with the satisfying consciousness that what he plays could not be excelled by either the paid organist or the obliging guest.\n\nThis pleasure never palls. The cost of the Estey Residence Organ is forgotten while the satisfaction it gives endures. It is in a business sense a sound investment. The pipe organ improves with age, and the upkeep is nominal. It becomes a permanent part of the home. It will last as long as the house lasts, and it enhances the value of the house. In the hands of a skillful architect or designer it becomes a beautiful addition to the music room, living room or hall.\n\n2.0 MUSIC FOR THE ESTEY ORGAN\n\nThe music listed in this catalogue has been especially arranged with the greatest care for the Estey Residence Organ. It cannot be used on any other instrument. The music and the organ are worked out together and to fit each other. A corps of competent musicians is constantly at work producing music for the Estey Residence Organ and frequent bulletins are issued describing new compositions. From time to time additional volumes will be added to this catalogue, with the compositions classified and arranged in a convenient manner for easy reference.\n\nThe compositions are catalogued alphabetically under two headings-by composers and by titles. The composers are also arranged in alphabetical order in the body of the catalogue. It has not been thought necessary to further classify under character of composition, such as opera, oratorio, especially since many compositions fall in more than one class.\n\nThe musical library of the Estey Residence Organ will continue to grow, guided partly by the tastes of the owners of the organs, and partly by our desire to present an adequate representation of the great and wonderful music available for the purpose. When a piece of music has been arranged for the Estey Organ at the request of any organ owner, that piece will be put into the bulletin, and subsequently into the catalogue, and will be available to any owner who cares for it.\n\nIn selecting the compositions for arrangement, we have tried to cover a range that would meet the varying tastes of lovers of the organ, and our plan is to meet individual requirements as far as possible. We are ready to arrange any composition which a customer may desire, and this can be done with surprising promptness. We have kept in mind music especially suited to the home and such as would provide for almost any occasion, while at the same time furnishing a rather unusual opportunity for becoming familiar with the works of the greatest composers. Musical compositions can be studied with great thoroughness by the use of the Estey Organist, as the themes can be separated from the accompaniment and each studied separately.\n\n3.0 HOW TO PLAY THE ORGAN\n\nThere are three ways of playing every music roll. The first is with no effort on the part of the operator, beyond inserting the roll and starting the mechanism. In this way the perforations in the paper bring on and change the selection of stops and combinations at the proper places in the composition, and operate all the expression devices and the phrasing.\n\nWith the second method the piece is pJayed with the proper stop combinations and expression devices operated by the perforations in the paper, while the operator introduces his own ideas of phrasing.\n\nA third way permits the operator to use his own selection of registration and gives him complete control over all the expression devices except the actual playing of the notes.\n\nNone of these interferes with the playing of the organ by the hands and feet in the usual way.\n\nThere is nothing intricate or mysterious about the mechanism. It is simply an application of wellproven mechanical principles for many years standard with all organ construction, but perfected and refined. A brief description of the action is given for information and guidance in order that the owner may clearly understand just what is done and why.\n\nSelect the roll to be played, unfasten the cord, being sure that the paper is tightly rolled on the spool, and insert the pin in the left-hand end of the music roll in the spring receptacle at the top of the tracker box, letting the right-end pin engage in the slotted chuck at the opposite end of the tracker box. With the hand revolve the bottom or take-up roll until the hook in the center groove is in front, where the ring on the music can be easily attached. Revolve this roll, pulling off the paper from the spool so as to completely cover all of the holes or throats in the tracker bar, being sure that the paper is centered on the tracker bar. Then close the glass slide and press the \"on\" piston marked \"To Play.\" This permits a pressure of wind to enter the closed tracker box. Put the music in motion by moving the tempo pointer toward the right. As soon as the number noting the tempo of the composition is visible on the music roll, set the pointer on that number. When a perforation in the paper comes over a hole or throat in the tracker bar the wind fills this throat and tube leading from it and causes a small poppet at the back of the console to lift and complete an electric circuit. From then on, the action is that of the hand-and-foot played organ.\n\nAt the end of the selection a perforation registers with a throat which controls the reverse mechanism and the music roll is rewound. At the same time the wind is shut off from the tracker box and all stops and combinations which have been used are cancelled, all parts of the organ remaining at rest. When the rewinding is complete, the spool stops and may be removed and another inserted, in the same manner as before.\n\nWhen it is desired to operate the stops and ex· pression devices by hand, the piston on the right of the tempo plate marked \"Stop Control\" should be in the \"off\" position. That is, the \"off\" piston should be down. It should be remembered that the stop controlled perforations in the paper are inoperative if this \"off\" piston is down. Inversely, when the paper is to control the registration and expression devices, the stop control piston \"on\" must be down.\n\nNever try to open the glass slide when wind pressure is in the tracker box. This wind pressure is controlled by the pistons marked \"To Play,\" \"on\" and \"off.\" It will be found that the \"off\" piston is automatically pushed down when the roll is being rewound and when the organ is at rest. Care should be taken to protect the tracker box from dust as far as possible.\n\n4.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC\n\nBACH, Johann Sebastian 1685-1750\n\nLeaving the name Bach out of the history of music, there would be no history of music. This very numerous family were prominent members of their profession for a period of nearly two hundred years, and so closely were they allied with the development of musical art that the first sentence of this paragraph becomes a truism. In all history there is not so remarkable an example of heredity, or so strong a refutation of the seemingly well-founded idea that genius never repeats.\n\nThe real musical ancestor of the family was Hans Bach, who was born about 1580 and died in 1626. Hans had three sons deserving of mention as musicians. One of these, Christoph, had three famous sons, one of whom, Johann Ambrosius, was destined to become the father of our subject, in whom the spark of genius grew to a brilliance which is still undimmed, nay which has grown brighter through the years. His first lessons were given him by his father, on the violin. At the age of ten both his parents died. leaving him and his education in the care of his brother, Johann Christoph, an organist at Ohrdruf. The genius of the boy now displayed itself unmistakably, and he progressed with a rapidity which was not encouraged by his brother. The use of a valuable volume of manuscript of Frohberger, Buxtchude and other celebrated composers was forbidden to the boy, who surreptitiously obtained it and copied it by moonlight, spending six months at it. When the stern and inhuman brother discovered what the youth had done, he took away from him his hardly earned treasure.\n\nBach became a very great organist and was fortunate in having his genius recognized and appreciated during his life. His move to Leipzig in 1723 was one of the most important events in his life, as it gave him a position where his duties were not so exacting that he could not devote the necessary time to composition. He also found a musical atmosphere which he had not known before. These ideal conditions undoubtedly helped him produce the great works of this period, which are among his greatest.\n\nMany of Bach's contemporaries were skilled in the art of polyphonic writing, and their work will stand as exacting scrutiny from a standpoint of workmanship. It is the musical test, however which places Bach above all his predecessors and contemporaries. Schumann referred to Bach as the man \"to whom music owes almost as great a debt as a religion does to its founder.\"\n\n216 Toccata in F\n\nNever was, nor will be, a greater toccata written than this. To say it is the greatest of Bach's, is the same as saying it is the greatest of all. Words fail to describe it. It must be heard not once or twice, but a dozen or twenty times before its true greatness dawns upon one. It is great musically, but marvelous structurally, and worthy the study necessary to fathom its depths.\n\n270 Gavotte from Sixth English Suite\n\nTradition has it that the six English suites were written for an English patron of Bach's and in the absence of any reliable data on the subject, this guess is probably as good as any that could be made. Bach wrote some French Suites also. The Gavotte from the sixth English Suite is a fine example of a form which was much in vogue in Bach's time, and a form in which Bach was especially skillful. The usual Musette is present and serves as a delightful contrast to the Gavotte proper.\n\n284 Gavotte from Orchestral Suite in D\n\nWhile the Gavotte is a dance tune of French origin, Bach's work along this line was in no way inferior to that of his French contemporaries. This Gavotte differs somewhat in form from the general plan, in that there are two separate Gavottes, the latter one replacing the Musette. In both forms, however, the first part is always the concluding part also.\n\nBACHMANN, Georges\n\nThere is very little record available of this composer. He wrote a large number of piano pieces, many of which won popularity among lover, of music. He was born about 1848; died in Paris in 1894\n\n299 Les Sylphes\n\nThis is a familiar waltz which was very popular with music lovers of the last generation. It is delightfully effective on the organ and is full of grace and charm throughout.\n\nBALFE, Michael William 1806-1870\n\nThis writer of so many of our favorite longs was born in Dublin. May 15, 1808. As early as the season of 1814-1815 he was the capable violinist of the dancing class of which his father was instructor. At seven years of age he wrote a polacca and scored it for Military Band. At the death of his father he became the pupil of Chas. Edward Horn, a singer. Later he was engaged to play in the orchestra at Drury Lane, where he at times led the orchestra. In 1825 he went to Italy under the patronage of Count Mazzara. Here he studied counterpoint and ringing. also writing a successful ballet, \"La Perouse.\" In his twentieth year he visited Paris, and was introduced to Rossini, who was then director of the Italian Opera. Rossini soon discovered hia talent and offered him an engagement for three year, as principal baritone on the condition that he take a preparatory course with Bordogni. His first appearance was as Figaro in the \"Barbiere,\" and was a decided success. From now on he led a life of great industry, singing the baritone roles of all the great operas, and comporing at an astonishing rate. He died October 2O, 1870, leaving behind a list of twenty-nine operas-twenty-one English, five Italian and three French.\n\n330 Then You'll Remember Me\n\nThis is a very well-known number from the \"Bohemian Girl,\" which is by far the best known of Balfe's operas. It is a cavatina in form, and occurs in the third act. It is so well known that a description is not only unnecessary, but would not be complimentary to music lovers.\n\nBALL\n\n258 Mother Machree\n\nPerhaps the most popular of the many Irish ballads which have been written in recent years.\n\nBARNBY, Joseph 1838-1896\n\nSir Joseph Barnby was the son of an English organist, Thomas Barnby. He was bom at York on the 12th of August, 1838, and was a chorister at the age of seven. In 1862 he was appointed organist of St. Andrew's. London, and the services at this church became famous under his direction. He is chiefly known for his numerous compositions in choral form. His works include an oratorio-\"Rebekah\"-and two hundred and forty-six hymn tunes, which were all published under one cover in 1897. He was also famous as a conductor of Barnby's Choir, and later succeeded Gounod as conductor of the Albert Hall Choral Society. He died in London on the 28th of January, 1896.\n\n237 Sweet and Low\n\nThis is a setting of Tennyson's lines: \"Sweet and low, sweet and low, wind of the western sea, Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea. Over the rolling waters go, Come from the dying moon and blow, Blow him again to me, While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.\"\n\nBARTLETT, James Carroll 1850-\n\nThis composer of many meritorios songs was born in Harmony, Maine, July 14,1850. He entered the New England Conservatory in 1869, where he studied piano and voice. He became later a pupil of Shakespeare and developed into a fine tenor. He toured this country in 1875-1876 with Camilla Urso, and was later musical director for Booth and Barrett. Many of his songs occupy a regular place on concert programmes.\n\n273 A Dream\n\nA song with a melodious beauty which has caught the popular fancy, and bids fair to retain its popularity for some time to come\n\nBATISTE, Edouard 1820-1876\n\nBatiste was a very renowned French organist, perhaps the best of his time. Like most eminent French musicians. he got his education at the Conservatoire of Paris. His compositions stand high in popular favor, but they fall far below what might be expected from an executant of his unusual ability. He wrote very little, if anything, except for the organ.\n\n131 Communion in G\n\nA melody such as one would suspect had been written for the organ. It is anything but elaborate in the beginning, depending solely on the delightful tune with plain harmonies for its attractiveness. Then the same subject is treated with various sorts of ornamentation, forming a very interesting contrast to the first part. It concludes with a quiet repetition of the theme with a slightly different harmonization.\n\n232 Offertoire St. Cecilia Op. 8 No.2 in D\n\nThis is one of a number of \"Offertoires\" by Batiste which have become immensely popular among organists, especially for concert purposes. It is a simple melody of great beauty, which is subjected to much elaboration, not to the detriment of the melody however, for Batiste knew when to stop. The present roll plays this number in a way seldom equaled by hand playing because of certain technical difficulties which are of course of no consequence to the automatic mechanism.\n\nBEETHOVEN, Ludwig van 1770-1827\n\nWhat can be said in a paragraph of this Titan about whom literally dozens of whole volumes have been written? One might venture the opinion that he was the greatest of all composers with very little chance of overstating the truth. He invented the sonata form as we know it, and then wrote symphonies in that form as if to prove it the greatest and best of all forms. All the hardships necessary to the development of a great genius were Beethoven's; he knew the sting of hunger more than once, and poverty was his portion for many years. A drunken father and the death of his mother and sister added to his misery. It may be that the troubles that were his in early life furnish the reason for the fact that, as compared with Mozart, Mendelssohn and others, he wrote practically nothing of importance until he was twenty-five or twenty-six.\n\n126 Adagio Cantabile-Sonata Pathetique\n\nThis is a lovely example of wonderful thematic beauty combined with masterful workmanship. Like most of Beethoven's themes, it is simplicity itself; indeed, this is its charm. It is from one of Beethoven's early sonatas, but a famous one, \"Pathetique.\" As an effective organ number it is unexcelled.\n\n219 Symphony Op. 21-Andante Cantabile\n\nThis is the slow movement of Beethoven's first symphony, written sometime before April, 1800. Nothing need be said about the charm of a Beethoven slow movement, whether it be from a sonata, string quartette or symphony. In this style of writing he gave his genius a free rein, and his wonderful technique of composition permitted him to put down what many another man might have thought, but never could have expressed as Beethoven did. This first symphonic slow movement gives many indications as to what might be expected of him in the future, and his style and individuality never changed to a point which would make this movement unrecognizable as Beethoven's work.\n\n265 Minuet in G\n\nThis is a lovely unattached minuet which deserves to belong to a symphony, quartette, or sonata. It suffers little in popularity, however, as a result of its not having a \"home\"; in fact, it is quite possible it is better known than would be the case if it were a part of one of the above forms. Beethoven wrote it! What more can be said by way of recommendation.\n\n322 Andante con Moto (Fifth Symphony)\n\nThe Fifth Symphony was begun about 1805 and had its first production December 22, 1808, at a concert given by Beethoven consisting entirely of works of his own which had never before been heard in public. The affair was a fiasco, due to the length of the programme, the extreme difficulty of the music, the intense cold in the unheated theatre, and an actual breakdown in a choral fantasie which was one of the numbers. In spite of such an inauspicious premier performance, the Fifth Symphony has become perhaps the most popular of all symphonies. There is nothing more beautiful in music than a Beethoven slow movement, and few, if any of his, surpass this one. The organ roll does it full justice.\n\nBIZET, Georges 1838-1875\n\nBizet, whose proper name was Alexandre Cesar Leopold Bizet, was one of the really great modern French composers. From 1848 to 1857 he was one of the most distingmshed pupils at the Conservatoire, where he studied piano, organ, harmony and composition, the latter branch under no less a personage Halevy, whose daughter he married in 1869. He had his share of disappointments before getting the recognition he deserved. Carmen, his masterpiece, conquered the whole world. It was produced first at the Opera Comique, March 3, 1875. It did not meet with instant success, but its genuine merit was not to be denied as it won a lasting place among the standard grand operas.\n\n345 Carmen Fantasie No.1\n\nThis long roll is a source of delight from beginning to end. It properly begins with the introduction to the opera, after which the stately Toreador Song appears. The principal airs of the first act follow in about the order in which they appear in the opera. The wonderful Habanera; the street boys' chorus; the lovely air by Michaela; and in fact all the gems of the first act are included. In this arrangement this beautiful music is heard at its best, and it would be difficult to find one to dispute the statement made in the first sentence of this paragraph.\n\nBOCCHERINI, Luigi 1743-1805\n\nBoccherini was the son of a bass player, who gave him his fird musical instruction on the cello. At fourteen he was sent to Rome to study, and his progress both in playing and composition very soon made him famous.\n\nIn 1764 he returned to Lucca, the place of his birth, where he became a member of the theatre orchestra and town band.\n\nHe was one of the most indefatigable composers, and despite his great popularity, he died in abject poverty May 28, 1805.\n\nThe list of his compositions seems incredible. including as it does 125 quintettes, 91 quartettes, 54 trios, all for strings, besides 42 trios for other instruments, 12 pianoforte quintettes, 18 quintettes for various other instruments, 20 symphonies, 2 octettes, violin duos, sonatas, cello concertos, and sacred music.\n\nHe was contemporaneous with Haydn, with whom he shares the honor of being the father of the string quartette.\n\n340 Minuet Celebre\n\nThis minuet is one of the charming bits of writing so characteristic of the composer. Its daintiness is its chief charm, though it lacks nothing in the way of strictly musical worth. It is perhaps the best-known bit of writing by this composer.\n\nBRAGA, Gaetano\n\nThis composer is a distinguished Italian cellist. He was born in the Abruzzi and was a pupil of the Naples Conservatory. He traveled extensively and has made several European concert tours. Besides compositions for the violoncello, he has written some operas and chamber music.\n\n266 Angels' Serenade\n\nThe popularity of this number has, in many years, shown no signs of lessening. The theme is of an appealing sort, and the words contain a pretty sentiment. Altogether it is a charming number and one deserving of the popular approval it has so long enjoyed.\n\nBRAHMS, Johannes 1833-1897\n\nThis composer was born in Hamburg, May 7, 1833; died in Vienna, April 3, 1897. His first instruction in music was given by his father, who was a member of the Orchestra of the Stadt Theatre, Hamburg, but his principal musical training was under Marxsen of Altona. He made his debut as pianist when but fourteen years old and shortly thereafter made a concert tour with Remenyi. the violinist, but it is as a composer that Brahms is best known. Some of his friends in their zeal pitted him against Wagner. and precipitated an artistic battle between the two, which was distasteful to both. He occupies a place in the musical world as a master.\n\n261 Capriccioso\n\nThis is a delightful little thing written for the piano, and will serve to show the wonderful effectiveness of the organ in rendering a number which is so obviously piano music. Its musical value is really enhanced as a number of pretty figures which may be lost on the piano, because of the single tone color, are brought to the surface-so to speak-on the organ in a way quite impossible to any other instrument.\n\n310 Hungarian Dance No. 1\n\n311 Hungarian Dance No. 2\n\n312 Hungarian Dance No. 4\n\n300 Hungarian Dance No. 6\n\nMany composers have felt the wild and weird charm of Magyar (Hungarian) music to the extent that they were moved to write something in this style. Some of them, undoubtedly, were unconsciously obeying certain racial instincts, while others were simply moved by a care-free style in which they could give expression in unrestrained and almost formless fashion to certain moods which could not be adequately expressed in strictly orthodox forms. The peculiarities discoverable in what we know as Hungarian music are traceable to certain characteristics in the music of two distinct peoples. To the Magyars-the true Hungarians-belongs the rhythm, which is unique because of its almost incessant syncopation, consisting generally of the accentuation of the second eighth note of the measure of 2-4 time. This rhythm is known as \"alIa zoppa\" (in a limping way). The gypsies are responsible for the numerous embellishments, without which Hungarian music would not, to us, be Hungarian. These two qualities have been so intimately linked together for so long a time that they have become concomitants and are now inseparable. Thus it is seen that the gypsies, while enjoying the honor of being the composers of this charming music, simply took the real Hungarian music, added certain ornaments of their own, and produced what has come to be regarded as a national style. In other words, they did what Homer did according to Kipling:\n\nWhen 'Omer smote 'is bloomin' lyre,\n\n'e'd 'eard men sing on land and sea,\n\nAnd what 'e thought 'e might require,\n\n'e went and took-same as me.\n\nThe market-girls an' fishermen,\n\nThe shepherd an' the sailors, too,\n\nThey 'eard old songs turn up again,\n\nBut kep' it quite-same as you!\n\nThey knew 'e stole; 'e knew they knowed,\n\nThey didn't tell, nor make a fuss,\n\nBut winked at 'Omer down the road,\n\nAn' 'e winked back-the same as us!\n\nThe Brahms Hungarian dances are standard, and a description of anyone of them would serve as adequate comment on all. They possess all the characteristics, peculiar and otherwise, of the style, and may be taken as models of their kind. Number 6 is perhaps the most popular of the set, but the others are no less interesting. Their beauties are brought out by the rolls in an unusually satisfactory manner.\n\nBREWER, John Hyatt 1858-\n\nJohn Hyatt Brewer is a well-known American organist who began his musical career as a boy soprano, and served several New York churches in this capacity. He studied harmony with Navarro and organ with Buck and others. He is known as a fine organist. and a capable chorus director as well as a composer of many works for organ. He has also written numerous songs, glees, and choral works.\n\n303 Echo Bells\n\nThis composition has been arranged especially for a pleasing introduction of the chimes. It is, however, very effective on organs in which the chimes are not included, where the effect of chimes is produced by other combinations.\n\nBUCK, Dudley 1889-1909\n\nDudley Buck was the son of a Hartford (Connecticut) merchant, who planned that Dudley should follow a mercantile life. He discovered his son's musical ability, however, and showed commendable judgment in sparing no effort to make of him a musician. Buck was one of the greatest American composers, and has left us a rich heritage of compositions in various forms. While he wrote voluminously for male and mixed choruses, he did not neglect the orchestra, and was at one time assistant conductor of the Theodore Thomas Orchestra. He was for many years America's premier organist, and wrote much for the organ.\n\n149 At Evening, Idylle, Op. 52\n\nIt is doubtful if any of the organ works of this composer has met with the degree of approbation from musicians and the general public which this number enjoys. It is beautifully sentimental, and when one is in the mood to enjoy a pastoral such as this, nothing could surpass it in its quiet effectiveness. This American composer has endeared himself to the public largely through his anthems, of which he has written a very large number.\n\n313 Home, Sweet Home (Transcription)\n\nThe authorship of this lovely melody, which we know by the above name, is much in doubt. It has been ascribed to Sir Henry Bishop, and to Thomas Moore. It was published early in the last century under the title, \"To the Home of My Childhood,\" and the melody ascribed to Sicilian origin.\n\nSir Henry Bishop used this supposed Sicilian melody in his opera \"CIari,\" or the \"Maid of Milan,\" in 1828. Later he confessed to William Chappell and others that he was the real composer of the melody. What a condescension! Incidentally, who would not like to make such a \"confession\"!\n\nIt may be said to the credit of Buck, that in his transcription for the organ he has done nothing to destroy the innate beauty of the melody, but rather has woven about it a very pretty figure of embroidery which serves only to add to the loveliness of the theme by contrast.\n\nCARYLL, Ivan\n\n363 Wait Till the Cows Come Home\n\nThis is a number from Jack O'Lantern in which the comedian, Fred Stone, is the star. As arranged it is intended as a fox trot, and as such has become very popular. We believe this roll will be found to meet all the requirements of dance music, as it lacks none of the snap of an orchestral rendition.\n\nCHAMINADE, Cecile 1861-\n\nA brilliant pianiste and a composer of very many piano pieces highly esteemed for the dainty style so characteristic of the French school. At eight years of age her first efforts at composition resulted in some church music. Since then her writing has been mostly for the piano, and her pieces have been popularized by her own playing of them as well as by their inherent merit. She has also written many songs, and a number of more pretentious works, but is chiefly known as a composer for the piano.\n\n190 Water Sprites\n\nThis is one of a great many beautiful piano pieces by this prolific composer. It is charmingly characteristic of her, and is a good example of the dainty style in which the French excel. Most delightful effects are easily obtainable on the organ with this roll, and a surprise is in store for anyone possessed of the idea that piano pieces cannot be adapted to the organ. Compositions for the piano have been successfully adapted to the orchestra, and what is an organ but an orchestra?\n\n301 Scarf Dance, Callirhoe Suite\n\nThe Scarf Dance is the second of four numbers comprising the Callirhoe Suite for orchestra, a ballet mst produced in 1888. Like most of Chaminade's work, its charm lies chiefly in its daintiness. After the opening part, which is so well known, there is a delightful theme of Oriental character which is in appropriate contrast to the beginning and adds tremendously to the interest. The opening part is then used as a conclusion. To those familiar with this number as played by the orchestra, this roll will be found highly satisfactory, while to those who know it only as a piano piece it will be a revelation.\n\nCHOPIN, Francois Frederic 1809-1849\n\nThis composer is known to the world by his piano compositions. He wrote practically nothing else except a few songs. His piano compositions, however, are enough to immortalize him. So important are they that it would be almost impossible to find a piano recital programme without one or more Chopin numbers. Perhaps his waltzes and nocturnes are best known to the laity, but the mazurkas, polonaises and ballads are known and played by all great artists.\n\n116 Funeral March\n\nThis impressive funeral march is from a piano sonata, Op. 35, and is much the best-known movement of the sonata. The opening series of chords are as melancholy as one could wish them to be, and then the sombreness is well relieved by the lovely plaintive melody which forms the trio. The tinge of sadness is as apparent, however, in the trio as in the opening and closing movements, which are practically alike.\n\nDEBUSSY, Claude Achille 1862-\n\nDebussy may be considered the founder of what we call the modern French school. He is probably the best-known exponent of the full tone scale, that is to say, in many of his melodies he makes use of steps of a full tone, instead of adhering to the diatonic scale of the key indicated by the signature, which is composed of tones and semi tones. His work has created much discussion which has brought no result except to bring forth very rabid expressions for or againat it.\n\n249 \"Clair de Lune\" (Moonlight)\n\nOne of the lovely piano pieces by this composer, the exquisite charm of which is largely due to its simplicity. It is as soothing as moonlight, and dreamy enough to suit the most exacting sentimentalist.\n\nDELIBES, Clement Philibert Leo 1836-1891\n\nThis French composer is best known by his fascinating ballet music, of which he has written much. He received his musical education at the Paris Conservatoire, and eventually became Professor of Advanced Composition in that institution. A large number of operas were written by him, and some of them occupy a regular place in the repertoires of many opera houses. France has produced no greater writer of dance music.\n\n139 Intermezzo-Pas des Fleurs (Naila)\n\nThis is a charming bit of writing of a distinctly French flavor, and of a style in which Delibes had no superior.\n\n155 \"Pizzicati\" and \"Valse Lente\" from \"Sylvia\"\n\nThe two numbers on this roll are from a grand mythological ballet which was produced June 14, 1876, and any doubt which may have existed as to Delibes' ability as a dance music writer were at once dispelled.\n\nThe first movement is, as its name would indicate, played by plucking the strings of all the stringed instruments in the orchestra. This effect is wonderfully duplicated on the organ and the result is a charmingly satisfactory rendition.\n\nThe Valse Lente is one of a type that could have been written by no one but a Frenchman, and indeed few Frenchmen could have done it. Nothing in the way of the grace so characteristic of this composer is lacking, and as a lovely bit of ballet music it is unexcelled.\n\nDONIZETTI, Gaetano 1797-1848\n\nThis prolific composer was contemporaneous with Rossini. and while he wrote much of merit and in the true Italian style of his day, he achieved little in the way of public recognition until after Rossini, who was five years his senior, had ceased to compose. His greatest successes are \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" which contains the famous sextette; \"Lucrezia Borgia\" and \"La Favorita\" out of a complete list of sixty-six or sixty-seven.\n\n185 Sextette from Lucia di Lammermoor\n\nIt is doubtful if any single piece of music exceeds this number in popularity. Although originally written for six voices, so well does it lend itself to various forms of instrumental adaptation that it has been arranged in every conceivable form. It is a particular favorite with concert bands, when the six parts are taken by various solo instruments accompanied by the full band. It is extremely effective on the organ, and invariably gives pleasure.\n\nDRDLA, Franz\n\nOne of the most popular composers for the violin is this Bohemian who was born in Prague. He has spent about twenty-five years in Vienna, much of this time being spent as concert master of the Royal Opera House. He is a very fine violinist, as both his compositions and position would indicate, and a very prolific composer of small numbers, the most popular of which are well known in America. Being only a little past middle age, much more may be expected of him in the way of delightful writing, quite equal to the standard he has set by that portion of his work which is known in America.\n\n349 Souvenir\n\nThis is one of the numerous compositions for violin and piano by this Bohemian violinist. Incidentally it is characteristic of the school to which Drdla belongs. The extreme rubato savors of the Bohemian school, as it does of the Hungarian school. Altogether it is a charming bit of writing and the string stops of the organ give it from this roll in a way that is no less pleasing than a violin rendition.\n\nDUBOIS, Francois Clement Theodore 1837-\n\nDubois at an early age left the place of his birth -Rosney-and went to Paris to enter the Conservatoire, where he successively took the prizes for harmony, fugue and organ, later, in 1861, taking the much-coveted Prix de Rome. His compositions cover all forms from song to symphony and grand opera. but he is best known in this country for his organ compositions.\n\n229 Cantilene Nuptiale\n\nThis is a very good sample of the delicious melody of which Dubois is capable. Like most compositions by this composer, it was written for the organ, and is extremely effective as played by the present roll.\n\n291 March of the Magi Kings\n\nThis is an exceptionally unique bit of programme music. The high sustained note which is heard throughout the march is intended to represent the ever present guiding star. It is an extremely interesting composition aside from its programme claims.\n\n279 March Heroique de Jeanne d'Arc\n\nLittle, if anything, has been done by this celebrated French composer that is more interesting than this March Heroique. Certain programme effects have been attempted as in the case of the \"March of the Magi Kings\"; the voice of Jeanne being heard at intervals in this case. It is a delightful bit of writing and meets all the requirements of discriminating musicians as well as the lover of music.\n\n234 Toccata in G Major\n\nThe earliest examples of the Toccata form are those of Giovanni Gabrieli, 1557-1613. These examples are rather restricted in form, and seldom make use of chords even for accompanimental purposes. The original idea was developed and elaborated upon from time to time until Bach placed the form upon the solid basis which it now occupies. Most composers of organ music have included one or more Toccatas in their list, and the present one is deserving of the popularity it enjoys. Being an organ composition, it is of course effective when played from the roll.\n\n282 In Paradisum\n\nThis is strictly an organ composition, wherein the beauty of the theme is more prominent than its brilliancy. At the beginning the accompaniment is of a celestial harp. The theme develops into a choral-like chant, to indicate the chant of the angels. The harp used in this composition gives a most beautiful effect.\n\nDVORAK, Antonin 1841-1904\n\nThis composer has endeared himself to the American public by his \"New World\" symphony. After hearing the negroes of the South sing some of their characteristic songs, he thought he had discovered the basis for an American school of composition, and proceeded to put his ideas into effect. The result is this wonderful symphony, which is perhaps more popular than any written in recent years. He wrote it during his stay in America as the director of the National Conservatory of New York, and Americans are proud that such a masterpiece should have been written in this country.\n\nDvorak's theories with regard to the value of negro music in serious work have been the occasion of much controversy. A hearing of the symphony, however, is apt to settle any dispute, and bring about an agreement that it is highly enjoyable and likely to live.\n\n175 Humoreske, Op. 101, No.7\n\nDvorak has been known to students and attendants at orchestra concerts for many years. His New World Symphony endeared him to American musicians, despite the controversy it created. The Humoreske, however, is the dainty little conceit that brought him the recognition of the masses. It is one of the big little things no one but a great man could write.\n\n145 Adagio, Allegro Molto. First Movement from New World Symphony\n\nThe fact that this symphony was written in this country is the occasion of a considerable amount of pride to Americans. It is a great work, and whether the claim of the composer to have discovered in the negro folk song a basis for an American school of composition is exemplified, matters not. It can be enjoyed from a musical standpoint regardless of any opinions one may have as to its origin. It is enough that the negro melodies should have inspired so wonderful a work.\n\n146 Largo. Second Movement, New World Symphony\n\nThis is thought by many people to be the best movement of the four comprising the symphony. The wonderfully sad and plaintive first theme is doubtless the occasion of this opinion. As a matter of fact, the other movements are quite as good, but they are not so obvious-they require a few more hearings to be understood. Nothing could excel the first theme of this number, however, which in the orchestra is an English horn solo for four measures, then it continues as a duet with the clarinet. Presently the strings have it for eight measures, when the English horn takes it up again with the bassoon. The French horns lead up to the second theme which is in strong contrast, paving the way for a reentrance of the first theme with which the movement finishes.\n\n147 Scherzo. Third Movement, New World Symphony\n\nScherzo is an Italian word, meaning \"jest,\" therefore a scherzo is a composition of a sportive and playful character. One playing of this roll will suffice to show how well Dvorak has caught the jesting spirit. Here and there he stops his chatter to sing a plaintive little tune for which the ear is wholly unprepared, but which is no less welcome or beautiful on that account, returning to the funny part of his musical story only to interpolate another contrasting tune. Then the story closes after a fine working down from the climax to a scarcely audible pianissimo, with a crashing chord by the full orchestra.\n\n148 Allegro confuoco. Fourth Movement, New World Symphony\n\nNo less interesting than the others is this last movement of the New World Symphony. At the tenth measure begins the principal theme of the movement, a theme big and broad, and well adapted to the thematic treatment it is to receive later on. Presently the second theme is heard in the strings with wood wind accompaniment, after which portions of both are developed in a most fascinating manner. An interesting feature is the curious introduction into this movement of parts of both the Second and Third Movements. They are heard distinctly at about the middle of the roll and near the end. Truly this is a fitting finale to a great work, an example of wonderful workmanship, and destined to become a classic.\n\nELGAR, Sir Edward 1857-\n\nThis remarkable composer, the son of a fine organist, was born at Broadheath, June 2, 1857. His musical proclivities asserted themselves early in life, and before he was fifteen he had often substituted for his father at the organ. A plan to send him to Leipsic failed, and Elgar's musical education was thrust upon him by a series of circumstances which, in all probability, broadened his musical vision to an extent that would have been impossible had he followed a strictly ordered course of study. There is scarcely an instrument in the orchestra that he did not learn to play, the wonderful color effects of his orchestral writings being undoubtedly due to his unusual practical knowledge of each of these instruments. A list of his compositions includes nearly all the accepted forms, done in a very charming but generally very informal way.\n\n287 \"Pomp and Circumstance\"-Op. 39, No.1 (Military March)\n\nOf all the marches under this title, of which there are six, none matches its name better than this one, in D. Its pompous beginning and ending are wonderfully contrasted with the imposing middle theme, which is of the kind that makes one's feet keep time whether he will or not.\n\n365 Salut d'Amour\n\nThere has probably been nothing written in recent years of really good quality which has caught the popular fancy to the extent that this little love song enjoys. It is played as a violin solo, cello solo, and is an indispensable part of every organist's repertoire. It can be heard to no greater advantage than on the organ, and this roll does it in a way superior to the best hand-played rendition.\n\nFAURE, Jean-Baptiste 1830\n\nJean-Baptiste Faure was born in Moulins, January 15, 1830. His father was a singer, and the son followed his footsteps. He has written several songs, of which The Palms is best known, and some books of instruction in the art of singing. He created many of the baritone parts in the operas written during the time of his public activity, which ceased about 1878-1880.\n\n33l The Palms\n\nThis is much the best known of the several songs by this composer. It has become a part of the Palm Sunday service in most churches and furnishes an opportunity for the di~play of a fine baritone voice such as is found in few songs\n\nFLAGLER, Isaac Van Vleck 1844-1909\n\nWas born in Albany, N. Y., May 15, 1844. He studied music first in his native city and then in Paris with Edouard Batiste. He occupied important positions as organist after his return to this country, in Chicago, Poughkeepsie, Albany and Auburn. He also taught music in the Syracuse and Cornell universities and at the Utica Conservatory. He composed and collected considerable organ music, which is held in high esteem. He died in Auburn in 1909.\n\n290 Serenata\n\nThis is just such a melody as the name would indicate, and one characteristic of this wellknown American organist.\n\n289 Impromptu\n\nA dainty thing, replete with lovely harmonies and charming melody. It is lacking of any particular form, but no less interesting on that account.\n\n275 Gavotte\n\nA pleasing example of an old dance form. It is tuneflll and is not lacking in the swing so characteristic of this form.\n\nFLOTOW, Friedrich Freiherr von 1812-1883\n\nHis father intended him to enter the diplomatic service, but like many another father, he was disappointed. The boy had something in him that precluded any other pursuit than music. Music was at its best in Paris in 1827, the time of Flotow's first visit to that city, and the artistic life which surrounded him brought him to a realization of his own musical talent. He began to study with Reicha. He remained in Paris until the revolution of 1830 drove him away. He could not stay away long, as he found the gay life of Paris a necessary stimulus to his work. He wrote about twenty operas, of which practically only two, \"Martha,\" and \"Stradella,\" are known to the present generation.\n\n198 Overture to \"Martha\"\n\nThis tuneful overture to Flotow's most popular opera has since its first performance in 1847 been a favorite with the public. While it possesses merit to those inclined to look below the surface, it is its melodious quality which endears it to the public. Martha and Stradella, out of nearly twenty, are about the only Flotow operas ever produced now. These two, however, are destined to enjoy many more years of popular favor.\n\n314 Overture to Stradella\n\nThis opera was first performed at the Palais Royal Theatre in Paris as a lyric drama. Flotow then recomposed it as a grand opera and produced it at Hamburg, December 30, 1844, as \"Alessandro Stradella.\" The overture is particularly tuneful, and is perhaps as well known as the Overture to Martha by the same composer. The first part is one of the most dignified of Flotow's efforts, and is better known than the rest of the overture, being much used as an organ voluntary.\n\nTaken in its complete form as we have it on the roll, it is one of the best of the lighter overtures.\n\nFRANCK, Cesar 1822-1890\n\nCesar Franck was a Belgian by birth but a Frenchman by choice and adoption. After his studies at the Paris Conservatoire he returned to his native country for the short period of two years, then moved his family to Paris where he established himself permanently in 1844. His unusually strong constitution permitted him to work at a pace that few men could have equaled. Day after day he gave ten lessons of one hour each, beside laying the foundation for the enormous amount of composing he was to do later in life. He was a most kindly and lovable man, and lived his life for his music and his friends, always too busy to give any attention to the unkind criticism of his musical enemies, of whom he had many. He was the chief exponent of a new school of composition, and he cared little what was said about any of his work that passed his own exacting scrutiny and had the approval of his small but very select coterie. The very large number of compositions he left include all the established forms; Symphonies. Oratorios, Symphonic Poems; Cantatas, Biblical scenes, Operas and Chamber music, numerous pieces for the organ, piano and songs. Much of this charming music is unknown to the public. but it bids fair to come into its own. The gorgeous Symphony in D minor now occupies the place on orchestra programmes which it deserves, and organists are discovering that they have overlooked much that is worthy of their attention. Surely a very high place among the composers belongs to this man, and before many years his name will occupy the exalted position it deserves.\n\n356 Andantino\n\nHere is an example of unadorned beauty. The simplest of themes is used and the whole structure stands solely on its innate loveliness. Of course it could not be expected that a master contrapuntalist such as Franck was, should eliminate all evidences of his marvelous technique of composition, but he has resorted to so little in the way of development or ornamentation that the result is all the more surprising. It is an altogether lovely bit of writing, such as only a man of Franck's character could have done.\n\nFREY, Hugo\n\n364 When You Come Back\n\nThis is one of the most popular of the many war songs which are in vogue just now. The present arrangement is a one step, and is very popular as a dance number. The composer is leader of a well-known New York dance orchestra and has written a number of things which have caught on with the public.\n\nGERMAN, J. Edward 1862-\n\nGerman is considered by many to be the successor of Sir Arthur Sullivan. His remarkable gift of melody and his ability to clothe his catchy themes with appropriate harmony have won for him a lasting place in the musical world. He has written a number of suites of incidental music to Shakespearean plays which have excited a wide interest. Two symphonies occupy an important place among his longer works.\n\n158 Country Dance-Nell Gwyn\n\nOne of three dances from the music to \"Nell Gwyn,\" which was first produced in London in 1900. German is one of the best-known English composers and has given us here a dance of remarkable grace and freshness, and strikingly characteristic of his ability.\n\n335 Shepherd's Dance\n\n334 Morris Dance\n\n326 Torch Dance\n\nThe music which German had composed for Richard Mansfield's production of Richard III was of such a superior quality that when in 1892 Sir Henry Irving presented Henry VIII, German was commissioned to write the incidental music. The result is quite equal to the first effort, and we present here three dances which have become famous as concert numbers, and justly so. They are all charming numbers, and the organ is the ideal instrument for their performance.\n\nGIBSON, Archer 1875-\n\nWas born in Baltimore and received his early instruction at home. He later studied piano and organ under Harold Randolph at the Peabody Conservatory in that city. After holding important positions in Baltimore. he went to New York in 1901, becoming organist at the Brick Presbyterian Church on Fifth Avenue. He devotes his entire time at present to concert work and is probably the most brilliant of American organists.\n\n268 Elegy\n\nThe sadness of this melody is one of its greatest charms. It is heard at the beginning and after a lovely middle part, which is in great contrast, the first theme is again heard, clothed with the same harmonies, but on a different solo stop. The change thus effected comes to a fitting close, completing a very charming number\n\nGODARD, Benjamin 1849-1895\n\nThis French composer has enriched our musical heritage by many works of extreme beauty and refinement. His chief work is the \"Damnation de Faust,\" which betrays his mastery of orchestration. Most of us know him best by his songs, and pieces in shorter form for piano, violin, etc., in which his wonderful gift of melody is a striking characteristic. A number of operas and symphonies, as well as other larger works. are better known in Europe than in America.\n\n170 Berceuse from Jocelyn\n\nComparatively few of the thousands of American admirers of this lovely lullaby are aware that it is an excerpt from an opera. Such is the case, however, and it is a fine example of the composer's ability along lyric lines. It has the sentimental quality which sings itself into one's soul, and has become the great favorite it is by force of sheer merit.\n\n308 Solitude\n\nThe title of this number is apposite enough in so far as the first and last parts are concerned, but the middle part is apt to suggest anything else than Solitude. For instance, it might suggest the ponderous footsteps of an elephant in the jungle, and the chattering of a lot of monkeys. Or it might serve well to depict a cave full of gnomes and bats,-a dark stage, villains, etc. After all, what's in a name? This is a charming bit of music and will doubtless suggest a different thought to each of its hearers.\n\nGOLDMARK, Karl\n\nGoldmark early gave promise by his violin playing. He was sent to Vienna in 1844 to study in earnest. The work which brought him seriously before the public as a composer was the overture, \"Sakuntala.\" His \"Queen of Sheba\" is the greatest of his operas. Goldmark's complete mastery over every musical effect, together with his wealth of melody, makes his works altogether charming.\n\n226 Overture, \"Sakuntala\"\n\nAt the first production of this overture in Vienna, the public realized that a new star had arisen. The overture is founded on a Sanskrit drama, and the story has to do with the gift of a ring by the King to Sakuntala by which she is to be recognized as his wife. She loses the ring while washing clothes in the sacred river, and when presented to the King he repudiates her because of the absence of the ring. Some fishermen find the ring and return it to the King who then remembers Sakuntala, and is filled with grief and remorse. He finally finds Sakuntala again, and the joy of both is complete.\n\nGOTTSCHALK, Louis Moreau 1829-1869\n\nThis perhaps most famous American pianist was born in New Orleans of an English father and a French mother. He studied the piano merely as an accomplishment until the age of twelve, when he prevailed upon his parents, who were in easy circumstances, to allow him to go to Paris to take up music seriously. When financial reverses overtook his father, he turned his talent to good account, and traveled eztensively giving concerts. He was the idol of many countries, including his own. No other pianist has traveled as eztensively or played to as many people. He died suddenly in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n172 Last Hope\n\nThis composition is said to have been played by Gottschalk extemporaneously at the request of his benefactress, Mme. S---, who, mourning the absence of her only son, and being afflicted with an incurable disease, could only forget her suffering in listening to the playing of her dear Moreau. \"In pity, my dear Moreau, one little melody, the last hope.\"\n\nIt is upon this lovely composition that Gottschalk's fame as a composer rests. The theme has been adapted to church uses by its arrangement into a hymn.\n\nGOUNOD, Charles Francois 1818-1893\n\nGounod may be said to have inherited his talent, as his mother was a distinguished pianiste. In 1836 he entered the Conservatoire, and in 1837 wrote a cantata which brought him the aecond prize. He became an organist and his experience with choirs is doubtless responsible for his fine choral writing. His naturally refined disposition ahows in all his works, and he rarely wrote anything below a certain dignified atandard which he seems to have aet for himself. \"Faust\" is his best-known work, and one of the very best operaa ever written. It ia tuneful and dramatic. and in fact is of a style which might be advantageously emulated by some of his auccessors.\n\n127 Ave Maria\n\nThe first prelude of the Forty-eight Preludes and Fugues of Bach is used as an accompaniment to a wonderful melody to which Gounod has set the Ave Maria. So wonderful is this combination that mention of an Ave Maria is generally taken to refer to this one. Indeed, great as is the prelude, it is known to comparatively few people in any other form than as the accompaniment to Gounod's great melody. It is known to most hearers as a soprano solo with violin obligato and piano accompaniment. This roll will be found to bring out the beauties of the imitation of the voice part by the violin in most satisfactory manner.\n\n156 Serenade-Sing, Smile, Slumber\n\nA tenor solo, originally, this charming song has been arranged for all sorts of combinations of instruments. It is a musical setting to a poem by Victor Hugo, which follows:\n\nWhen thou singest while nestling at eve close by my side,\n\nDost thou know what my soul unto thine would fain confide?\n\nThy sweet voice wakes the mem'ry of days render'd joyful by thee.\n\nAh! then sing, ah, sing, my fair one, then sing, still sing to me.\n\n214 \"Sanctus\" from St. Cecilia Mass\n\nThis lovely number is from one of the many religious works which came from Gounod's pen in the latter years of his life. After having for many years written almost nothing but opera, in which he was very successful, his whole trend of thought seems to have been changed, and the dramatic instinct, which he had worked long to develop, became subordinate to the religious fervor which characterizes almost all his compositions for the twelve years preceding his death.\n\nThis Sanctus is a tenor solo with chorus, and is delightfully effective on the organ.\n\n230 Nazareth\n\nNazareth is one of the songs which could have been written by no one of a less refined nature than Gounod-not to say, of a less religious nature. One familiar with his work could almost identify any of his sacred songs by the unmistakable religious fervor which permeates their whole structure.\n\n293 Marche Romaine\n\nThis is a fine example of march rhythm of the kind which makes one's foot keep time. It is both pompous and dignified and never anything but musical.\n\n305 Funeral March of a Marionette\n\nAt the commencement of this composition, it is supposed that two of the doll actors have had a fight, in which one of them has been killed. The others sorrowfully mourn the fate of their companion and organize a party of pall-bearers, who shall carry their friend to the cemetery. The procession sets forth and on the road the troupe converses about the vicissitudes of life and reflects sadly that it required but one hard blow on the nose to knock the breath out of so talented an artist. As the weather is exceedingly hot, some of the troupe begin to find the way long and tiresome and they stop at a wayside tavern. They remark to each other that it is not the duty of the living to die for the dead, and in order to enable them to bear up, they must partake of soothing and refreshing fluid. Meanwhile they get into a discussion as to the merits of their late companion and in the heat of discussion, they forget that the funeral procession has now reached the gates of the cemetery. They finally decide to join, avoiding all appearance of undignified haste. They fall into their places and enter the cemetery to the same phrase as the one at the beginning of the march.\n\n355 Selections from Faust\n\nTo many people Faust is the only music by which Gounod is known, and while these people have missed much that is good, it may be said, perhaps without successful contradiction, that they are familiar with the best of Gounod's compositions. Indeed, they are familiar with some of the finest music ever written. The present roll includes the Introduction or Overture; the apparition of Marguerite at the spinning wheel; the Kennesse; Siebel's Song; \"Gentle Flowers\"; the \"King of Thule\"; the Jewel Song; Soldiers' Chorus, etc., embracing nearly all the popular and best-known numbers in the work.\n\nFaust is one of the operas which never grows old, and this roll is a source of delight to all who hear it.\n\nGRIEG, Edvard Hagerup 1843-1901\n\nGrieg's talent was early fostered by his mother, who was a talented amateur, and from her he got his first lessons. He began to compose at nine, and on the advice of Ole Bull was sent to Leipsic in 1858, where he remained until 1862 under Hauptmann, Richter, Reitz, Reinecke, Wenzel and Moscheles. His natural ability, which was very great, could not help but develop under the guidance of such an array of teachers. On his return to Norway, the national instinct asserted itself and the rest of his life was practically devoted to the fostering of a Norwegian school of music. He has left many works which must endure, including nearly all the accepted forms.\n\n181 Morning Mood-Peer Gynt Suite\n\nThe attention given this suite by concert orchestras would lead to a conclusion which is very generally accepted-that it was originally written for orchestra. Such, however, is not the case, for the incidental music to the Ibsen play first appeared in the form of a pianoforte duet. Certain numbers of it were selected by Grieg and turned into two suites for orchestra. The suites are known as Peer Gynt No.1, and Peer Gynt No.2. It is from Suite No. 1 that this roll is taken, and the organ will be found to produce this music in all its loveliness. It is intended to musically represent daybreak on an Egyptian desert. The climax of ever increasing tone may be supposed to indicate the increasing daylight.\n\n183 Anitra's Dance-Peer Gynt Suite\n\nOne does not need to be told that this is an Oriental dance. It breathes the Orient in every measure. With this graceful, sinuous dance, Anitra fascinates Peer Gynt, after first having made a slave of him by her charms, and they agree to fiy to the desert together.\n\n184 Death of Ase-Peer Gynt Suite\n\nThe remarkable harmonies in this number are inexpressibly charming and weird. It is a funeral march somewhat different from the accepted form, as it lacks the middle part or trio. No combination of instruments could possibly render this number more effectively than the organ. One might think it was written for the organ.\n\n182 In the Hall of the Mountain King-Peer Gynt Suite\n\nPeer Gynt forsakes his stolen bride and wanders about the mountains, straying into the hans of the Mountain King where the gnomes tease and torment him until he is driven out. The opening of this number is quaint, mysterious and subdued. It increases in both tempo and power from the very first measure until at the end it becomes a surging riot of sound.\n\nGUILMANT, Felix Alexandre 1837-1911\n\nThis aon of a Boulogne organist displayed his ability so early in life that at sixteen he held an important engagement. In 1871 he moved to Paris to take the appointment as organist in Trinite, a position which he held until 1901. As a composer he is known almost solely by his organ works, of which there are many, includitng a symphony for organ and orchestra, seven sonatas and numerous concertos.\n\n186 Offertory on Two Christmas Hymns\n\nThis composition proves Guilmant no less capable as an arranger than as a composer. These two old hymn tunes have lost none of their original charm as a result of their treatment in this manner. Guilmant's painstaking workmanship is well exemplified in this number, and being a composition for the organ, it is an especially charming roll.\n\n233 March Funebre et Chant Seraphique-No. 17\n\nThis is one of the best-known organ compositions by one of the very great organists of the world. Guilmant played it many times in this country and gained for it the popularity it justly deserves. It is peculiarly organ music and of the type which permits the organ to proclaim itself the king of instruments.\n\n262 Elevation, in Ab\n\nThis impressive composition designed to accompany the ceremony of the elevation of the Host, is one of this famous organist-composer's best-known works. He has chosen that the uplifting character of the music be displayed by a fervid theme. He has designed the work that it be rather free from complexities, both of structural as well as of harmonic nature. This beautiful melody makes its greatest appeal simply, betraying at every measure the sincere depth of religious thought in the mind of the composer when it was conceived. This number is very effective on the organ.\n\n285 Pastorale\n\nThis form is one which is not unusual in Guilmant's compositions, and one in which he showed particular skill. The present Pastorale was written for harmonium and piano and its successful performance from a roll entails very exacting conditions. We must have the sustained harmonies of the harmonium, and the broken chords of the piano, and it is surprising to observe how satisfactorily the organ fulfills all the requirements. This roll leaves nothing to be desired.\n\n288 Grand Chorus in D-Op. 18, No.1\n\nThis roll will bring to many a vivid recollection of the composer's own playing of this great composition. Guilmant was small in stature, but he could conceive big things, and no better testimony is needed than a hearing of this roll. The first theme is given out in massive chords which are tremendously assertive, giving way later to a playful mood, which furnishes a wonderful contrast, and prepares one for a reiteration of the first part which is no less interesting as a finale than as an opening theme.\n\n304 Finale (Grand Chorus in Eb)\n\nGuilmant's conception of a Grand Chorus is well indicated in this example of the composer at his best. It is magnificently imposing and shows the composer to be the great workman that he was. The thematic material is good enough, but it is largely what he has done with it that makes it the glorious composition it is. It was, of course, written for the organ, which means that the roll does it full justice.\n\n296 Torchlight March-Op. 59, No.1\n\nThis is an unusual type of march, which begins so pompously that it would seem impossible to get down to the sentimental theme of the trio. The contrast is not so great, however, as to be inappropriate, or unenjoyable. The first theme recurs after the trio, for a brief moment, when a new theme is announced. Then as a finale we find the first theme much elaborated, and a brilliant coda.\n\nHANDEL, George Frederick 1685-1759\n\nHandel was born in Halle, Lower Saxony, and was contemporaneous with Bach, both having been born in the same year. Nothing short of a volume could contain the merest mention of the incidents in Handel's life, to say nothing of a description of the influence and beauty of his works. As a prolific and rapid composer he had no equal. He wrote \"Rinaldo\" in fourteen days, and that gigantic masterpiece, \"The Messiah,\" in twenty-four days. He is said to have improvised on paper. He spent many years in England, and wrote many of his greatest works in that country. Indeed, there has lately arisen a controversy between England and Germany as to whether he was an English or German musician, Germany laying claim to his birth, and England to his works.\n\n132 Hallelujah Chorus\n\nThis marvelous chorus is known to everyone. No other chorus approaches it in stupendous conception, and it is generally conceded to be the greatest of all choruses. Handel is said to have remarked that when he wrote it \"he thought he saw Heaven opened and the great God himself.\"\n\n188 Largo from \"Xerxes\"\n\nThis dignified number is one of a more or less lengthy list of pieces without which no catalogue would be complete. Few are the people who have not heard it in almost every possible form except the original. It appears in the opera \"Xerxes\" as an aria, but is played as a solo by every sort of instrument from a trombone to a violin. In no form, however, does it display its grandeur to as good advantage as on the organ. The dignity and delicacy of the organ are particularly adapted to the happy rendition of this the only number of the opera now heard.\n\nHARKER\n\n252 In the Twilight\n\nThis is a lovely little organ piece, and is one of many equally pretty numbers by the same composer.\n\nHAYDN, Franz Joseph 1732-1809\n\nThe career of Franz Joseph Haydn was not unique in that he began life as a \"poor devil\"-to use his own phrase-and ended it in affluence. We have grown almost to assume that a very great man could begin life in no other way. Indeed this is the measure of true greatness.\n\nHaydn's birth was exceptionally timely; Bach and Handel were waning, and but for Haydn there would have been no one to continue their wonderful work until the advent of Mozart. He bridged the gap between Bach and Handel, who were contemporaries, and Mozart. It is doubtful, too, that we should have had the Mozart we know, but for Haydn.\n\nJohn Mathias Frankh, a schoolmaster and relative of the Haydn family, on recognizing young Haydn's talent, prevailed upon his parents to allow him to take the boy with him to Hainburg that he might educate him and teach him music. His mother gave her consent reluctantly, as she had hoped her boy might study for the priesthood. At eight years of age he had learned all the music his benefactor was able to teach him, and went to Vienna to sing in St. Stephen's Cathedral, where he was taught Latin, reading, writing, arithmetic and music, and given his board, lodging and clothes for his services. After some years his voice began to break, and the choirmaster, wanting an excuse to dismiss him, seized with avidity upon the opportunity furnished by Joseph himself when he cut off the pigtail of a fellow chorister with a pair of scissors. He was soundly flogged and dismissed.\n\nIn 1753 Haydn became accompanist for Porpora, a famous singing teacher, and from this time until his death opportunity smiled upon him. He was engaged by Count Morzin to conduct his private orchestra. Here he wrote the first of his one hundred and twentyfive symphonies, and various other concerted works. Prince Esterhazy engaged him when it became necessary for Count Morzin to disband his orchestra, and he remained in Esterhtizy's employ for thirty years, during which time he composed most of his quartettes and symphonies.\n\nWe are indebted to Haydn for many of the musical forms in general use to-day. The sontata, the symphony, and the quartette as we know them to-day, are essentially as he left them. They have all been elaborated, but in none of them has the form undergone any change of a radical nature.\n\n227 With Verdure Clad-\"Creation\"\n\nThe work in which this aria occurs was begun in 1796 when Haydn was sixty-four, and finished in 1798. The work in its entirety is one of the most stupendous compositions for voices and orchestra extant.\n\nThe present aria is of florid style and will always be a favorite with lovers of oratorio. It is for soprano voice and well displays Haydn's ability to write in the florid style peculiar to this voice.\n\n316 \"The Heavens are Telling\" (\"Creation\")\n\nThe first performance of the \"Creation,\" from which this wonderful chorus is taken, was given in private at the Schwarzenberg Palace on April 29, 1798, and in public on March 19, 1799, at the National Theatre, Vienna. If ever a work was inspired it was surely this stupendous oratorio. Haydn said : \"Never was I so pious as when composing the Creation.\"\n\nHENSELT, Adolf von\n\nAdolf von Henselt was born in Bavaria in 1814. He was a celebrated pianist and was well known as a composer of some very interesting studies for the piano. He was Official Court Pianist to the Empress of Russia and was Instructor in Music to the Princes. He died in 1889.\n\n307 If I Were a Bird\n\nThis melodious study was named by the author, \"If I were a bird, to thee I would fly,\" and throughout the entire composition there is indicated the spirit of unrest. The composition indicates clearly the sentiment of longing and at one point rises to an impressive climax. After a pause, composure is regained and a flitting melody is again heard, but this time the impatience is subdued. Nothing is lacking to make this a pleasing number.\n\nHERBERT, Victor 1859-\n\nWe, in America, have come to feel that Victor Herbert belongs to us, so great have been his musical activities among us. He was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father dying when he was seven years old, his mother, a daughter of Samuel Lover, the novelist, went to Stuttgart to live. Here Herbert entered the Conservatory and chose the violoncello as his instrument. He came to New York in 1886 and became associated with Anton Seidl as solo cellist and assistant conductor. He has written much in the way of light operas, and short pieces for various instruments, as well as a number of more serious works.\n\n267 Badinage\n\nThis is a playful conceit of a kind that no one writes better than Herbert. The tempo rubato is characteristic, and it fairly sparkles with dainty melody and somewhat startling harmonies. It is altogether a charming number on the organ.\n\nHEROLD, Louis Joseph Ferdinand\n\nThe musical talent of this son of an able pianist soon became apparent, to the delight of his father, who entered him at the Conservatoire at Paris, the city in which he was born. Here he soon won the first prize for piano playing, and in 1812 won the \"Grand Prix de Rome\" for a cantata. He composed in many forms, but the stage furnished greater opportunity for a man gifted as he was with an ability to express emotion, and his known works are almost all in dramatic form. About twenty operas, an enormous number of piano pieces, a symphony, three string quartettes, and a number of other works were left by him. Of all this list, scarcely anything is known in America but the opera \"Zampa.\"\n\n346 Overture to Zampa\n\nThis immensely popular overture is about all that is known in America of this composer's work. It is delightfully rich in thematic material, and the workmanship shows the hand of a master. It is regrettable this composer's name and fame should rest on this single effort, for he doubtless wrote much besides this which is worthy of a hearing.\n\nHORSMAN, Edward I., Jr. 1873-\n\nWas born in New York, March 10, 1873. Musically he is chiefly self-taught, although he had instruction from various teachers, principal among which was his course of counterpoint under S. Austen Pearce. As an organist, he has held positions at Old St. Anne's and at St. Luke's, Brooklyn, also St. Andrew's, New York.\n\n250 The Curfew\n\nThis is a composition for the organ which was built upon a theme originally intended for a song setting to the first verse of Gray's \"Elegy.\" It is difficult to say whether or not we have been deprived of any pleasure by the change of heart on the part of the composer. The one certain thing is that this American has given us a charming number, and one which improves upon acquaintance.\n\nHUMPERDINCK, Engelbert 1854-\n\nHwmperdinck was born at Siegburg in the Rhine provinces, September 1, 1854. He displayed a talent for music early in life, but was the recipient of no really capable instruction until he was eighteen years old, at which tilme he entered the Conservatorium at Cologne, where he studied with Ferdinand Hiller. While there he wrote a String Quartette which won for him the Frankfurt Mozart Stipendium, which enabled him to go to Munich, where he studied with Lachner and later with Rheinberger at the Royal Music School. He next won the Mendelssohn Stiftung of Berlin. He went to Italy and met Wagner at Naples. Wagner invited him to go to Bayreuth. Here he became Wagner's valuable assistant in the production of \"Parsifal.\" Once more, however, his talent and industry won him a prize, this time the Meyerbeer prize of Berlin, and once more he started south. He traveled through Italy, France and Spain, remaining two years in the latter country, teaching theory in the Conservatoire at Barcelona. Returning to Cologne he was professor at the Hoch Conservatorium from 1890 till 1896.\n\nAll this time he had been busy with his pen, and had written a great deal of very beautiful music. His best-known work, an opera, \"Hansel und Gretel,\" for which his sister wrote the libretto, was produced at Weimar in 1893 with tremendous success. It is now one of the standard operas, and is deserving of the high regard it enjoys. Humperdinck was a rare master of the techniq,ue of composition~ and while never short of original thematic matter, was particularly fond of folk tunes, many of which he used.\n\n337 Hansel and Gretel-Vorspiel\n\nThis is one of the loveliest of overtures. The story is of course based on one of Grimm's Fairy Tales, and nothing could be more beautifuI than the music or the story which suggested it. While the form is more or less free, it betrays unmistakably the wonderful technique of the composer. It is interesting to note the way the first theme is used as an accompanimental figure in the latter part of the overture. In fact the development of the thematic material is nothing short of marvelous. All that can result from fine material and exquisite workmanship is found here, and such proximity to absolute perfection has seldom been attained.\n\n339 \"Evening Prayer and Dance of Angels\"\n\nIn this number the composer has used as a first part or prayer, the first theme of the Vorspiel. and surely nothing of a more devotional nature could have been chosen for the purpose. This theme reappears here in all its loveliness, and loses nothing of its charm by being linked to the Angels' Dance.\n\nJACOBS-BOND, Carrie\n\n239 A Perfect Day\n\nA very popular and melodious song by a wellknown song writer of the present day. The composer's gift of melody is well displayed in this song.\n\nJOYCE, Archibald\n\n352 Vision of Salome Waltz from the Ziegfeld Follies of 1910\n\nThis is a very catchy waltz which became popular immediately upon its presentation in the Follies of 1910, and has retained its popularity to an extent seldom enjoyed by music of this kind. It still possesses all its charm, and will be found a very satisfactory roll either for dance purposes or as a musical number.\n\nJENSEN, Adolf 1837-1879\n\nJensen is known best as a song writer of the German school. His songs, while original, might have been written by anyone of several composers contemporaneous with him. He has written numerous short piano pieces, and several suites of pieces for piano and for voices. An unfinished opera was found after his death.\n\n137 Murmuring Zephyrs\n\nA transcription of one of Jensen's most beautiful songs, and a good example of his ability in this form of writing. The melody is beautifully brought out in this roll, and it will be found a charming number for the organ.\n\n199 Wedding Music, Op. 45. Bridal Song No.2\n\nAll of the numbers of the set betray the lyric quality which is so characteristic of the composer's songs. The \"Bridal Song\" is perhaps the best known of the set, and is very effective on the organ as arranged in this roll.\n\n200 Wedding Music, Op. 45. Round Dance No.3\n\nThe round dance is the light number of this set, and shows Jensen in a frivolous mood not uncommon to him. It is effective on the organ, as are the other three of the set.\n\n201 Wedding Music, Op. 45. March No.1\n\nThis is one of four numbers originally written for pianoforte duet under the general title of \"Hochzeitsmusik.\" This is a noble composition of a stately and dignified character. It will never supplant Mendelssohn's Wedding March, which fact, by the way, is nothing to its discredit, as many other wedding marches have been written, some perhaps as good musically as Mendelssohn's, but none seems to have struck the popular fancy to the same degree. This march suffers little by comparison, except when considered as a wedding march.\n\n202 Wedding Music, Op. 45 Nocturne No 4\n\nThis nocturne is quite different in character from most compositions bearing the same title. It will be found highly interesting if played in the proper tempo. It is more often played too slow than too fast. A safe rule might be to play it as fast as possible and yet preserve its inherent dignity. A few playing trials will reveal the proper tempo, and the result will be altogether charming.\n\nKELER-BELA, Albert von 1820-1882\n\nThe real name of this composer was Albert von Keler. He was unsuccessful as a farmer and as a lawyer. Music then seemed to him to be the thing he was best fitted for, and he began his musical education in earnest at the age of twenty-five. He spent about nine years in Vienna, stuilying with Schlessinger and Sechter, and playing at the theatre. In 1854 he took the leadership of Gung'l's band in Berlin, and from this time may be dated his career as a violinist, composer and conductor. His works reach the startling opus number of one hundred and thirty, consisting principally of overtures, dance music and pieces for solo violin, all of which are distinguished by their showy and brilliant style, and clever orchestration.\n\n350 Hungarian Lustspiel Overture\n\nThis is one of the numerous overtures by this prolific writer and perhaps the one best known to Americans. Keler-Bela wrote a Lustspiel Overture and a Hungarian Lustspiel Overture, which means that he wrote a jolly, playful overture and a jolly, playful Hungarian overture. The present one is so full of Gypsy atmosphere that it need not have been labeled. It will be found an altogether charming roll.\n\nKEY, Francis Scott 1779-1848\n\nFrancis Scott Key, the author of the Star-Spangled Banner, was the son of John Ross Key, who was an officer in the Revolutionary Army. He was a lawyer and a brilliant one, but it is as a patriot that his name has come down to us. What greater honor could come to a man than to write a song, the first strains of which cause a nation to stand in reverence of the flag which it loves!\n\n362 Star-Spangled Banner\n\nThe story of this song which means so much to Americans is a well-known one, but it cannot be too well known, and for this reason we give it in detail.\n\nAfter the British had burned Washington in 1814, they advanced toward Baltimore, meeting a small force of Americans, most of whom they captured and took to the large fleet which was preparing an attack on Fort McHenry. A Doctor Beans, an intimate friend of Key, was among the prisoners taken. To try to intercede for his friend's release, Key set out in a sailboat with a flag of truce, for Admiral Cockburn's ship. He pleaded successfully for his friend but they were prevented from returning to Baltimore until morning, by the bombardment of Fort McHenry, which stood in the way of the capture of Baltimore.\n\nFor such a patriot as was Key there was no such thing as sleep. Instead, he watched\n\nAnd the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.\n\nThe first verse was written during his detention, and the other two ashore. A tune was found ready-made to fit the words, and one with all the characteristics of a national air. \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" was written by John Stafford Smith, an English composer, and this tune was suggested by Judge Nicholson, Mr. Key's brother-in-law, as a fitting vehicle for the patriotic verses.\n\nThe present arrangement must be accepted as official, it having been made by a committee appointed by the United States Commissioner of Education. The committee consisted of Will Earhart (chairman), Walter Damrosch, Arnold J. Gantvoort, O. G. Sonneck and John Philip Sousa. The harmonization of the melody as in the roll is by Walter Damrosch.\n\nKINDER, Ralph\n\nRalph Kinder is the very well-known organist of Holy Trinity Church, Philadelphia. He is a brilliant player and has for years filled this large church with auditors at his Saturday afternoon recitals. His programmes are unusually interesting in that ke displays great skill in their arrangement and remarkable taste in the selection of compositions. Programme making is an art in which Mr. Kinder excels, and his technique is such that the whole range of organ literature is available.\n\n333 In Moonlight\n\nThis very interesting number begins with a solo on the chimes. The middle part has a rhythm which might suggest a barcarole or boat song. After this interesting movement the first theme returns and serves as a close.\n\nKREISLER, Fritz 1875-\n\nFate played the trump card in tke destiny of this artist, as in tke case with many others. His earliest ambition was to be a tram conductor. Had he been born in America instead of Austria, he probably would have aspired to become a policeman. Certainly a classic from his bow is more pleasant to the ear than any \"step lively please\" he could ever have acquired. At ten he won the first prize at the Vienna Conservatory. and at twelve performed the unprecedented feat of capturing the Prix de Rome at the Paris Conservatoire. He toured America as a boy prodigy with Rosenthal, returning to Austria to serve his four years in the army. His next public appearance was in 1899, from which time his growth in all the essentials which make for greatness in art has been constant, until at this time he is very generally thought to be the greatest violinist alive.\n\n351 Caprice Viennois\n\nKreisler has been wonderfully successful in the arrangement of folk songs, etc., for the violin, and his playing of them has popularized them to the point that a violin recital programme without a Kreisler number or two is almost a curiosity. Just how much of the present roll is original and how much traditional is not a matter for discussion here. It is possible that in his work of transcribing, at which he is wonderfully adept, the composer has become so saturated with traditional styles that their influence has shown itself in his compositions. And it is no discredit to him if such is the case. We are concerned, however, only with the musical aspect of it, and for supreme beauty of its kind it is unexcelled. The dissimilitude of the themes forms a contrast which is both startling and pleasing.\n\nIn the introduction he indulges somewhat in violin gymnastics, but soon settles down to the lovely folk-like song which haunts one after a hearing or two. Then a lively theme which is distinctly violin music, works itself into a fury, and finally gives way to a repetition of the folk theme which makes a fitting ending and leaves one with a delightful impression of the entire number.\n\nLEFEBURE-WELY, Louis James Alfred 1817-1869\n\nIt is rather a rare occurrence for a child to learn his notes before he does the alphabet. Such was the case, however, with the subject of this paragraph. At eight years he played portions of the service for his father, who was organist at St. Roch. He succeeded his father upon the death of the latter, though only fifteen years of age. He wrote much for the piano, but it is as an organist and writer for the organ that he will be remembered.\n\n264 Hymn of the Nuns\n\nHere we have a pretty theme of a religious character, embellished in a charming way with a figure of beauty which constantly recurs above the main theme. It is a great favorite among organists and is pleasing when played from the roll.\n\n361 Monastery Bells\n\nThis is a charming bit of writing of a kind that has to some extent gone out of fashion. It is good music, in fact, it must be, otherwise it would not have lived so long. The present roll uses both harp and chimes in a most delightful manner, and much pleasure is in store for those who are to hear it.\n\nLEMARE, Edwin H. 1865-\n\nThis best-known English organist was born in the Isle of Wight. From the time he entered the Royal Academy he has shown unusual talent. He excels as an executant of orchestral works on the organ, but his playing of legitimate organ works is no less attractive. He has composed many short pieces for the organ through which he has become widely known.\n\n254 Andantino Db\n\nThis is a very popular example of this composer's work on short pieces for the organ. He has done many in this style, most of which are deservedly popular, but this is perhaps the best known.\n\nLEMMENS, Nicholas Jaques 1828-1881\n\nA Belgian organist of fame. He was a pupil at the Brussels Conservatory and later became professor of organ playing at that institution. He left many compositions, chief of which is Ecole d'orgue, which has been adopted by the conservatories in Paris, Brussels, Madrid, etc.\n\n283 Fanfare\n\nThis is a fascinating bit of writing which is charming in its simplicity. It would seem that the composer had started out to have a good time and had succeeded.\n\nLEONCAVALLO, Ruggiero 1858-\n\nLeoncavallo's first and greatest achievement was the opera \"Pagliacci.\" He spent a number of years in an effort to get some of his early operas staged, but was not successful. \"Pagliacci\" was an immediate success and it is on this opera and \"La Boheme\" that his fame chiefly rests.\n\n223 I Pagliacci-Prologue\n\nPerhaps no single number is better known to opera goers than this wonderful prologue. As its title indicates, it occurs at the very beginning of the opera, and takes the place of the overture. It is both dramatic and lyric, and presages the ability of the composer to do justice in a musical setting to the story which follows. It is sung by Tonio, the clown, who, after he has finished forecasting the story of the opera, claps his hands, singing, \"Come then, ring up the curtain.\"\n\n231 I Pagliacci -Serenade\n\nNothing could be more graceful or dainty than this lovely serenade, which is sung by Beppe. He first tunes his mandolin, then sings:\n\n\"O Columbine, unbar to me\n\nThy lattice high,\n\nI watch and sigh,\n\nLonging to hear thee,\n\nAnd be near thee, as the hours go by.\"\n\nLILIUOKALANI, Queen (Lydia Kamekeha)\n\nThis accomplished woman was the last Queen of the Hawaiian Islands, and was deposed in 1893. She was much beloved by her people for her charitable and kindly instincts. She was a patron of art and did much for the, progress of her little country. She died in 1917.\n\n169 Aloha Oe (Farewell to Thee)\n\nThe words and music of this song are by Hawaii's former queen. There is an appealing tinge of sadness in the music which is plainly evident in the words.\n\nProudly swept the rain cloud by the cliff\n\nAs on it glided through the trees,\n\nStill followed with grief the liko,\n\nThe ahibilehua of the vale.\n\nThus sweet memories come back to me\n\nBringing fresh remembrance of the past\n\nDearest one, yes, thou art mine own,\n\nFrom thee true love shall ne'er depart.\n\nI have seen and watched thy loveliness, Thou sweet rose of Maunawili, And 'tis there the birds oft love to dwell And sip the honey from thy lips.\n\nLISZT, Franz 1811-1886\n\nAfter Liszt had made for himself a reputation which nothing could shake, his principal aim in life seemed to be to help to lead others into the light of public favor. He delighted in cramming down the throats of the unappreciative public the works of unknown and struggling composers in whom he discovered the spark of genius. It is generally accepted that he was the greatest pianist of all time. As a composer he ranks very high, and was the originator of the orchestral form known as the \"Symphonic Poem.\" As an arranger of well-known airs into concert pieces for the piano, he was without an equal. A piano recital without a Liszt composition is a rarity.\n\n151 Les Preludes\n\nThis is one of a series of twelve orchestral compositions to which Liszt applied the title Symphonic Poem. They are all more or less symphonic in treatment, but are nevertheless free of many of the conventions of the real symphony. The title has been used by many composers since Liszt, when an attempt is made to produce a musical equivalent to a poetical idea.\n\nThe resemblance of this form to the symphony lies in the fact that the themes are developed, and the lack of resemblance to the symphony, in the fact that they are not developed according to the accepted rule.\n\nLiszt's inspiration for this particular one is found in Lamartine's \"Meditations Poetiques\":\n\n\"What is life but a series of preludes to that unknown song, the first solemn note of which is sounded by death? Love forms the enchanted daybreak of every life; but what is the destiny where the first delights of happiness are not interrupted by some storm, whose fatal breath dissipates its fair illusion, whose fell lightning consumes its altar? And what wounded spirit, when one of its tempests is over, does not seek to rest its memories in the sweet calm of country life? Yet man does not resign himself long to enjoy the beneficent tepidity which first charmed him on Nature's bosom, and when 'the trumpet's loud clangor has called him to arms' he rushes to the post of danger, whatever may be the war that calls him to the ranks, to find in battle the full consciousness of himself and the complete possession of his strength.\"\n\nA careful reading of the above paragraph will add to the enjoyment and understanding of this composition.\n\n194 Rhapsodie Hongroise, No.2\n\nThis is one of a number of compositions which bear the same title, and which have been popular for many years. They afford the pianist an excellent opportunity to display his technique and are not without musical merit. The form is one of Liszt's own, beginning with a slow introduction (Lassan) usually in a minor key, of a sad character. The middle part (Frischka) is of a lively nature, while the finale (Czardas) is wild and riotous. The present rhapsody is in this form, and is the most popular one of the set.\n\n269 Consolation, in Db\n\nThis a lyric of much charm. The melody as well as certain of the inner parts is brought out on the organ in a way not easily accomplished . on the piano.\n\n319 Liebestraum\n\nThis composition was originally a song, and is one of three which were written under the title given above. As we have it on the roll it is a transcription by the composer of the third song of the set. It is so much better known than the other two, that it is invariably referred to as \"Liszt's Liebestraum,\" the number rarely being given. It has a beautiful sustained melody which is never forgotten when once it has made its imprint on one's memory. The organ does it full justice, and leaves nothing to be desired in the effect produced.\n\n323 Thou Art Like a Flower\n\nThis is a setting of the famous poem by Heine, \"Du bist wie eine Blume.\" This lovely poem has received attention by nearly all the great composers, and very many of those who could hardly be called great. It would be safe to say that no less than a thousand good settings exist. Of all these, those by Liszt, Schumann and Rubinstein are best known, and the one by Liszt does not suffer by comparison with any of the others.\n\nLOHR\n\n253 Little Grey Home in the West\n\nThis is a deservedly popular little ballad and comes at a time when it seems that the art of writing a ballad which will sing itself has all but been lost.\n\nMacDOWELL, Edward Alexander 1861-1908\n\nThis sterling composer was born in New York City, and America is proud to own him. His piano playing was notable, and he has left numerous compositions which evidence a thorough knowledge of piano technique. He played a concerto of his own for Liszt, and so taken with his playing was the great master that he invited MacDowell to play at the approaching meeting of the Deutscher Musikverein at Zurich. He accepted, and made a good impression with his first pianoforte suite. While perfectly at home in the larger forms, it is through his numerous short pieces for the piano, and his songs, that he has endeared himself to the great musical public. He is thought by many to be the best composer that America has ever produced, and they are not far wrong.\n\n135 Clair de Lune (Moonlight)\n\nThis American composer has written many lovely compositions, of a type of which this one is a good example. The tender, plaintive tune with which it begins is very effective on the oboe, indeed the use of the oboe all through for the solo part can hardly be improved upon because of its plaintive tone quality.\n\nA brighter middle part in a major key serves to make a most delightful and striking contrast to the sombre first theme, which finally is again heard serving quite as appropriately as a closing theme.\n\n236 Woodland Sketches To a Wild Rose\" \"Will o' the Wisp\"\n\nTwo numbers of MacDowell's dainty suite for piano on one roll. \"To a Wild Rose\" is as pretty a bit of plaintive melody as could have been written by anyone, nor is the melody its only charm, for the appropriateness of the harmony is just as striking as the melody is beautiful. It is altogether lovely, and wonderfully effective on the organ.\n\n\"Will o' the Wisp\" is a riot of notes chasing each other hither and yon and is in wonderful contrast to the first number.\n\n338 A. D. MDCXX\n\nThis composition is one of those mysterious bits of writing of which MacDowell was so fond, and which he did in a manner unequaled. The rhythm strongly suggests the motion of the sea, as was his evident intention. Much charm is wrapped up in this little roll, and it will be found no less satisfactory on the organ than the piano, for which it was written.\n\nMacFARLANE, Will C. 1870-\n\nWilliam Charles MacFarlane is one of the most famous of the living organists. He was born in London on October 13, 1870, and was brought to New York when four years old. Since he came to this country at so early an age, and received all his musical education here, we may justily claim him as an American organist. He was Samuel P.Warren's pupil for a number of years and made his debut in 1886. He has played recitals in all the principal cities and his career both as organist and composer has been a brilliant one.\n\n332 Evening Bells and Cradle Song\n\nHere is a very fine example of the proper use of chimes. A very familiar bell phrase is first "
