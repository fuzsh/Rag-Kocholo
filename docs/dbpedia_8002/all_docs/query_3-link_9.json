        "text": "BACHENDORFF\n\nThis company was founded in 1794. For perspective, Haydn was writing his last works while Beethoven was writing his Opus 1 piano trios. Ibach has been notable in the development of both piano construction and the piano industry in general. The family owned and managed company has seen to the replacing of the wooden plate to the cast iron plate to produce a more powerful sound. Carl Rudolf Ibach developed the worlds first vertical piano in 1838 in addition to the worlds first tonally successful 40\" console piano. Ibach has built a solid reputation in Europe over the last two centuries through fine craftsmanship and supplying pianos to a long list of famous composers and artists such as Wagner, R. Strauss, Liszt, Bartok, Schoenberg, and others.\n\nIn 1993 we began production at home under strict contract for Ibach. A good number of the Ibach meisters we had trained under in Germany stayed with us for our beginning production. The German process was quite different from what had been our own. Every step in production intentionally planned out for superb quality. New tooling was utilized in precision execution, compounded by unending regulation and scrutiny.\n\nIn 2001 we introduced the incredible Bachendorff piano, our crowning achievement. We are excited to be now producing some of the worlds truly fine pianos. Pianos that can provide your families future generations pianos to be cherished.\n\nFRANCIS BACON\n\nFrancis Bacon pianos and player pianos were made by The Bacon Piano Co., W. P. H. Bacon, president. The history of this company, starting in 1789, is the history of the piano business in America. It received medals and diplomas for the excellence of its instruments wherever they have been exhibited, notably at the Philadelphia World's Fair in 1876, and at Chicago in 1908. This instrument enjoyed unusual favor with the trade and the musical public, and was regarded as one of the most versatile of all desirable instruments in the market. Francis Bacon pianos, player pianos, electric expression players, reproducing pianos (licensed under Welte-Mignon patents) and grands had a century and a quarter of experience and \"know how\" behind them and emphasize unusual value at moderate prices.\n\n1950 - 408000 1964 - 570000 1971 - 643000 1978 - 722500\n\n1955 - 503000 1965 - 579000 1972 - 653500 1979 - 737000\n\n1958 - 521000 1966 - 589000 1973 - 660000 1980 - 754000\n\n1960 - 535000 1967 - 601500 1974 - 683000 1981 - 767000\n\n1961 - 542000 1968 - 611000 1975 - 695000 1982 - 780000\n\n1962 - 551000 1969 - 621000 1976 - 708500 1983 - 795491\n\nTop of page\n\nBAILEY\n\nThis well known piano, established 1901, attained a good place among popular instruments.

In the best sense of the word, instruments of the highest degree of excellence. The system or chain of scientific improvements peculiar to the Baldwin piano based on the law of acoustics, and known as the Baldwin acoustic system, which permitted the greatest conservation of tone, secures an artistic result of the highest quality, and has resulted in gaining for. It a leading position among the world's artistic musical instruments. The Baldwin piano has an individuality of the highest character. When it was exhibited at the International Exposition at Paris in 1900 it was honored with an award (The Grand Prix) which has never been bestowed on any, other American piano, and the highest honor ever received by any, piano made In America. The Baldwin pianos are made in most modem and perfectly equipped factories under ideal manufacturing conditions. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Mo., 1904, the Baldwin piano was again awarded the Grand Prize and still another Grand Prize was awarded the Baldwin pianos and Manualos at the Anglo-American Exposition, London, 1914. The \"New York Tribune,\" in commenting on the comprehensive display of the Baldwin Company at Paris, and the success of this piano and this house, said that they made a record that would never he forgot in the history of uprights, grands and reproducing pianos, the grands including the various sizes from concert grands to small grands for parlors. In Rome, 1923, the Baldwin piano was awarded the Papal Medal and the House of Baldwin appointed \"Purveyors to the Holy See.\" The Baldwin piano is recognized as a universal favorite between the leading operatic artists and virtuosos of the pianoforte. The Baldwin Manualo is a unification of the most artistic piano with the most scientific players' construction; in other words, it combines the highest artistic attainment in piano production with the most gratifying ability of performance.

By that system of a co partnership of labor and profits the Packard Piano Company has exemplified the truth of the maxim that \"Good work is not done by tired men\" It is a policy of fellowship that actuates the makers of Bond pianos and that gives to its progress uncommon interest. The Bond Piano Co. was organized and incorporated under the Indiana State laws in the fall of 1911, by the stock holders of 'The Packard Piano Company. The old established Fort Wayne, Ind. industry. Early in 1913 at a meeting of the stockholders of the two companies, a thorough analysis of the situation proved the expense of the management, production and selling were greater less than two units than it would be less than one. While the working force could be maintained separate and distinct in every way, in the manufacture of the Bond Piano and the Packard piano, greater efficiency could be obtained in management, production and selling by The Packard Piano Company taking over the Bond Company, using the Bond Piano Co. as its trademark for Bond. Pianos manufactured by the Packard Piano Company were built by the owners of the company, which are all of the employees were paid based on a profit-sharing method. By that system of a copartnership of labor and profits made its progress phenomenal, and the quality of the instrument just a little bit better than instruments of the same grade.

It is also known, affectionately, as the slowest. From the wood first arriving to season until its transformation into a grand piano means a wait of seven years; the construction of a single Bösendorfer takes 62 weeks from start to finish. Currently, the factory, with approximately 220 employees, turns out about 500 grands and 100 uprights every year. Since its foundation in 1828, the company has had only three owners and, to date, has hand-built no more than 46,000 pianos. There is an aura of exclusivity, rarity value and enormous expense attached to it. Whether or not these perceptions are accurate we shall see, but first let us briefly examine the milieu in which the firm had its origins.\n\nIgnaz Bösendorfer believed that the piano, usually categorised as a percussive instrument, was a member of the string family. He determined that every part of the piano should, like a violin, resonate to help produce the overall tone. Spruce has the best tonal qualities of any wood (80% of the wood in a Bösendorfer is spruce) and to this day the company source the wood for their soundboards from the same area of northern Italy from which Stradivarius obtained his. Only spruce that has grown to a minimum of 1000 metres above sea level is selected, and only timber which is felled in January is used, as this is the time of year when the sap is at its lowest.\n\nIt was about this time that Bösendorfer began to build instruments with extended keyboard (and remains the only manufacturer to do so today). A typical keyboard has 88 notes with A being the lowest. Bösendorfer Models 225 and 275 have four added notes to lower F, while Model 290 (the Imperial) has nine added notes to lower C (97 keys covering eight octaves). How did it come about? Busoni was in the process of transcribing Bach's Passacaglia in C minor (BWV582) and needed a piano with a bottom C to simulate a 32-foot organ pipe. Ludwig Bösendorfer obliged.\n\nBy 1909, Bösendorfer, one of the most colourful and popular Viennese personalities, was searching for an heir. With no direct descendants, he sold the business to his friend Carl Hutterstrasser whose family would run the business until 1966. Hutterstrasser's early years in charge saw Bösendorfer production reach a new high of 434 instruments a year, but the company then suffered the first of its three declines. In 1913, the beloved Bösendorfer Hall was demolished to make way for a major building project, and the First World War reduced production to a mere 130 or so instruments a year. Ludwig Bösendorfer died in 1919. His will directed that his body be driven to a cemetery on a simple piano-carriage and buried in perfect silence before the notice of his death was made public. No flowers, no wreaths, no announcements of death, no funeral orations. His headstone reads simply: 'Ludwig 1919'. The City of Vienna honoured him by renaming the street to which the company had moved 'Bösendorferstrasse'.\n\nThe post-war years saw steady productions figures  250 to 310 instruments per year between 1919 and 1929  before the economic crisis of the '30s saw an acute slump: 219 (1930), 119 (1931), 51 (1932), 40 (1933), 52 (1934). In 1931 the Bösendorfer firm became a partnership when Carl Hutterstrasser's sons Alexander and Wolfgang joined the business. With war clouds looming once more, Bösendorfer achieved a major coup in 1936 when the BBC invited bids from nineteen piano manufacturers to compete to supply their studios. Bösendorfer, entered in two categories, won first prize in both and the BBC ordered Bösendorfer grands for all its British studios, though the order was never completed due to the political situation in Austria. Production, nevertheless, climbed from 114 instruments a year in 1936 to as many as 143 in 1941.\n\nThen came the Second World War. In 1944 the lumber yard supplying the firm's wood was destroyed in a bombing attack. The following year, the factory was hit by artillery fire, and in the Musikverein, soldiers camped in the showrooms around open fires built on the parquet floors. Heavy street fighting between the Germans and Russians in 1945 destroyed the company's offices and showrooms. All remaining pianos were used for firewood. The firm's technicians were either taken prisoners or fled. A few men between them managed to produce just eleven instruments in the two years immediately after the war. It took the best part of twenty years before production figures rose above the 100-instruments-a-year mark, but between 1946 and 1956 almost every Bösendorfer went to Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1953, Bösendorfer celebrated its 125th anniversary with a gala concert  Wilhelm Backhaus as soloist with the Vienna Philharmonic under Clemens Krauss  but its next important milestone was in 1966. The private firm of L. Bösendorfer became a joint-stock company, bought by Arnold F. Habig, head of the Jasper Corporation, Indiana, USA, whose ancestors, appropriately enough, had emigrated from Vienna to the small German-American town of Jasper. Habig had started with a small company making TV cabinets but then acquired Kimball pianos, eventually changing his firm's name to Kimball International Inc. With his partners the Thyen (pronounced 'Tin') family, Habig's aim was to use Bösendorfer's expertise to improve the Kimball range of pianos. The deal worked well for both companies and by the time Bösendorfer celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1978, production had reached 500 instruments a year, with a grand total of 32,000 during its illustrious history (in that year alone Kimball was able to make 54,800 pianos.) Arnold Habig died last year in his mid-nineties. Including its electronic goods, office and hotel furniture products, Kimball International had sales of $1.4 billion in 2000 making it one of the top 500 most successful businesses in the world. The business is now run by Habig's son Doug as CEO, with Jim Thyen as President of the company. Recently they produced their first new model in nearly one hundred years: the Model Concert Grand 280.\n\nSome famous Bösendorfer owners past and present:\n\nBrahms, Wagner, Liszt, d'Albert, Anton Rubinstein, Reger, Casals, Cortot, Fürtwangler, Richter, Bernstein, Menuhin (3), Backhaus, Bartok, Kodaly, David Oistrakh, Rudolph Friml, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra (3), Ashkenazy, Brendel, Gulda, Rostropovich, Carreras, Domingo, Fischer-Dieskau (3), Bobb Messingschlager (3), Oscar Peterson, Chick Corea.\n\n1900-15640 1935-25700 1950-26960 1970-29109\n\n1910-19640 1940-26290 1955-27490 1975-30622\n\n1920-22530 1944-26730 1960-27900 1980-33444\n\n1930-25350 1948-26830 1965-28434 1985-34155\n\nTop of page\n\nBRADBURY\n\nOne of the great names in the American piano industry.
