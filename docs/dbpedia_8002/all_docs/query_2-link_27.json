If out of the chaotic condi\n\ntion of war that shattered the world\n\ncan come right it will not be accom\n\nplished Quickly, and I do not think\n\ntnat the most optimistic of us can do\n\nother than realize that the effects of\n\nth strife will not disappear In so\n\nehort a period. at ten years\n\n( iBut there are so many things that\n\nr-an be done toward making things\n\nbetter that It is not a bad idea on oc\n\ntmoions of this sort, where men meet\n\nfrom faixspread parts of the world, to\n\ni exchange views.\n\nI - Prevent Future Wars\n\n-.\"We want as a world community to\n\nrealize that wars in the future ought\n\nto be prevented. We do want to im\n\npress upon these statemen of the\n\nwork! who are soon to meet In Wash\n\nington, who are responsible to the\n\n(world for molding a policy, that none\n\n'Of -us are going to look with indiffer\n\ntenee upon thefer work. If the repre\n\nsentatives' of the United States, with\n\nits 100,000.000 people; the British\n\n.Empire and Japan, leaving out all the\n\n'others for the moment, when they get\n\ntogether do not give, take and exer\n\ncise oommoon sense, with a spirit of\n\ndetermination to enable the world at\n\nlarge to carry on its affairs without\n\nj-war within 25 or 50 years from now,\n\ntthjen they have not done their duty\n\ni PHILHARMONIC\n\nORCaiESTRAssEBEBr.\n\nSYMPHONY 60 MUSICIANS\n\nDr. Giovanni E.

What is the use\n\nof professing sentiments against war\n\nin the future if a system is to be pur-\n\nmitted through which men whose bus\n\niness it is to keep their swords and\n\nguns bright will force the use of them\n\neventually upon those who do not\n\nwant war? We see the Japanese build\n\ning the largest and most powerful\n\nweapons of warfare, and if one coun\n\ntry does it, whether we agree to the\n\npolicy or not, we are bound as men\n\nand women in our respective countries\n\nto allow no one to take advantage of\n\nus by getting ahead In the matter of\n\nnational preservation measures.\n\nThe 1eairue and War\n\n\"There is not a country in the world\n\nin which the people are not burdened\n\nwith excessive taxation due to the\n\nwar. Add to the taxation of business\n\nand you add to the cost f whosesale\n\nand retail purchase, and wage earners\n\nwill suffer Just as much as the ordi\n\nnary man of capital. If this system of\n\nmilitary expenditure is not going to\n\nbe minimized by the common sense of\n\nthe men who are going to this confer\n\nence and out in the distant country\n\nwhere I live we believe in limitation\n\nof armaments what is the use of\n\ntalking about a League of Nations\n\nand a proposed peace system to stop\n\nwar? What is the use of a League of\n\nNations if side by side with it is built\n\nup a machinery of war?\n\n\"What is the condition of business\n\nmen at the present time all over the\n\nworld ? Today there Is not a man in\n\nany part of the world who can tell\n\nwhat the value of his dollar or h:i\n\nsovereign will be tomorrow. Ger\n\nmany can undersell any country In\n\nthe world, due to the depreciation of\n\nthe mark. While in Germany I in\n\nquired into the value of steel com\n\nmodltles, and generally speaking any\n\narticle in that line could be purchased\n\nfor about one-fifth less than in Eng\n\nland.\n\n\"A solution of this problem must\n\nbe found, or the world will be driven\n\ninto worse trouble in the years before\n\nus. The exchange of the world Is up\n\nside down, and traders the world over\n\nare unable to buy for the future on\n\naccount of the condition of exchange.\n\nUnemployment will not pass until\n\ntrading countriel can enormously in\n\ncrease their exports. You man not\n\nhave felt the devastating effect of the\n\nexchange ruling now. but you will\n\nfeel It unless there Is something done\n\nto prevent the present system con\n\ntlnuing.\n\nNew Conditions\n\n\"The world must make up its mind\n\nthat what was right before the war\n\nfrom the viewpoint of maintaining\n\nbusiness must now be altered to meet\n\nthe changes that the war has forced\n\nupon us. There is no country that\n\nconsumes to the limit the material its\n\nmanufacturers can produce.\n\n\"Personally I believe that your\n\ncountrv should have a banking insti\n\ntution in mine and that mine should\n\nhave one in yours and that a trader\n\ncoming here should not have to draw\n\nupon London for money that he\n\nshould be able to call upon his own\n\nbank in this country and get his\n\nmoney upon his bill of lading and\n\nnote.\n\n\"The seasons between this country\n\nand Australia and New Zealand are\n\nalmost diametrically opposite. When\n\nwe are out of one class of products\n\nvou have them and vice versa. We\n\nought to be able to Improve trading\n\ncondiions between your country ana\n\nmine verv materially indeed.\n\n\"We never can forget the fact that\n\nwe are English-speaking counrrto-s. It\n\nis the English-speaking countries thai\n\nought to co-operate, that ought to\n\nwork to the end of bringing about\n\nbetter trade relations. I believe that\n\nthe genius of our people and the\n\ngenius of your people Is big enough to\n\novercome the difficulties that the war\n\nhas brought to us. We want to co\n\noperate.\n\nThe Race Question\n\n'I refer to a matter of considerable\n\ndelicacy. We in our country are\n\nstraight out for a white Mice.

Still it is a\n\npood thing for the Japanese to learn\n\nthat we cannot alter that feeling 01\n\nthe people for a white race and re\n\nmember that 85 per cent, or the peo\n\nple in our country were born there and\n\nthat they are going to keep that coun\n\ntry for the white race ir tney can.\n\nThey have done It up -till now. While\n\nwe want to co-operate with all coun\n\ntries in the limitation of armaments.\n\nwe do not subordinate that policy or\n\npreserving the country lor the white\n\nrace. No government, power or party\n\ncould alter that policy. \"\n\nIt would be a wiBe thing ror tne\n\nmen In the Far East to remove the\n\nidea that we are animated by racial\n\nhatred. Our whole economic condition\n\nis dependent upon the maintenance of\n\nthe fundamental principle tnat we\n\nhold our country for the white race.\n\nWe do not want intermarriage be\n\ntween our people and those of the Far\n\nEast. We believe that in building up\n\nthis tjolicy we are building up a great\n\nasset for the world at large. We are\n\nonly the custodians of the day, pre\n\nMrviTiff and Vis n VI in r down to posteri\n\nty this principle without attempting In\n\nany way to inei tni g v- n u v. w . . j .\n\nern countries. We are anxious that\n\nat this crisis in the world's history\n\nthis fixed policy shall not be mistak\n\nen. Pacific Important\n\n\"The Pacific is the greatest ocean\n\nin the world, the greatest potential\n\nfor good in the world in the interest\n\nof the English-speaking . peoples.\n\nThere are over 700,000,000 people In\n\nthe lands adjoining the Pacific. If the\n\nUnited States of America and the\n\nBritish Empire as two seotions of the\n\nEnglish-speaking people were to look\n\nupon the Pacific Ocean as under their\n\nspeoial care there would be no need of\n\na large naval armament.\n\n\"lit is of vital importance to your\n\npeople that he should look after the\n\ninterest of the Pacific and that we\n\nshould never allow anyone, under an\n\nalliance or by any other eans, to\n\ntake it away from us. There are isl\n\nands in the Pacific over which a flag\n\nonce placed would give mastery to the\n\nentire area. We all want to think\n\nmore about the necessity of public\n\nmen guarding the Interests of the\n\npeople who are to follow us In the\n\nPacific nations of the future.\n\n\"New Zealand and Australia are\n\ncalling for people.They are compara\n\ntively empty. New Zealand' with a\n\npopulation of 1,250,000 can support\n\n45,000,000. Can you eee as I can that\n\nif tho nennln do not come from Eng\n\nlish-speaking communities, with 500,\n\n000 000 of another race within ten\n\ndays of Australia, that great territory\n\nwill not long remain unoccupied? It\n\nis to your Interest and ours that we\n\ninsure in the centuries to come the\n\nAnglo-Saxon speaking peoples shall\n\nbe In charge of all these territories\n\nand that we develop an Intercourse, it\n\nmay be by treaty or by other means,\n\nthat will bind the ties closer than\n\nthey ever have been bound before.\"\n\nSTUDY OF HIGH AliTITUDES\n\nTo Be Made by Harvard Doctors at\n\nthe World's Loftiest Town.\n\nDetroit, Nov. 18.
