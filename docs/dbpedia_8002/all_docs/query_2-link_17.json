        "text": "ACROSONIC Built by Baldwin\n\nThis distinctive and exclusive name designates a line of spinet and console pianos built by the Baldwin Piano Company. Coined from the Greek word,\"akros,\" meaning supreme and the Latin word, \"sonus,\" meaning tone, the trade mark \"Acrosonic\" is registered in the United States Patent Office. Acrosonics are famous for their beautifully compact styling, their tonal clarity and power and Baldwin's exclusive Full-Blow Action.\n\nAEOLIAN AMERICAN CORPORATION\n\nOffices and factories, East Rochester, N. Y. The subsidiary companies controlled by the Aeolian American Corporation, listed alphabetically, include Chickering & Sons, J.& C. Fischer; Wm. Knabe & Company; Mason & Hamlin Company; George Steck & Company; and the Weber Piano Company. The manufacturing facilities at East Rochester comprise a series of separate and individual factories planned so that the manufacturing of the various instruments is carried on in an entirely individual and distinct manner, and by separate organizations each under the direction of men who have been associated with each respective make for many years, thus preserving, unimpaired, the individual and distinctive qualities of each piano. The affiliation of the various houses forming this great and powerful contribution to the art of music insures for each a wider scope for musical activity and valuable advantages in securing the best the world's markets afford in the materials that enter into piano construction, thus insuring for each of its units the highest quality in its grade and at an extraordinary economy of production. The research facilities and extraordinary purchasing power of the Aeolian American Corporation contribute immeasurably to the quality and value of the instruments made in its various manufacturing divisions. The Aeolian American Corporation was one of the pioneers in producing and placing on the market the highly desirable new vertical piano, and has constantly made outstanding advances in the art of piano styling and acoustical design. The instruments made by the Aeolian American Corporation enjoy unquestioned reputation throughout the world and are sold by leading music merchants everywhere.\n\nAMERLING PIANO\n\nThis firm purchased an entire building located at 1307-17 Utica Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y., where complete modern factory facilities have been installed. On these premises are produced the Amerling line of fine console-grand, studio and grand pianos. Amerling pianos are custom built with old world touch and new world technique. Amerling instruments are invested with a century of knowledge and tradition and bring to each owner a pride and prestige that only 100 years of experience and progress can produce in the specific art of pianoforte construction.\n\nThe Amerling line of console grands includes such features as \"Direct Grand Blow Action\" (produces richer tone and reduces wear and tear on action); \"Centertone Bridge\" (transmits sound waves to grand crown soundboard without distortion); \"Grand Crown\" (spruce tapered soundboard of finest quality as used in concert grands); \"Grand Locked Uniscale\" (fortified, even balanced side to afford pure, even tone).Amerling pianos are available in French and Italian Provincial, Modern, Contemporary and Traditional designs, and are finished in a wide variety of attractive color-tones. Highly endorsed by leaders in radio, theatrical and television fields, Amerling pianos also enjoy fine acceptance among well-known decorators.\n\nBALDWIN\n\nThe Baldwin Grand Piano, designed, built and guaranteed by The Baldwin Piano Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, is used exclusively by the first rank of concert artists in all spheres of musical expression-pianists, conductors, composers, singers, instrumentalists as well as outstanding symphony orchestras and music festivals. The word, \"Baldwin,\" in characteristic Old English type face, is a registered trademark in the United States Patent Office. From the nine foot concert grand to the five foot, two inch grand, every Baldwin embodies the latest concepts of acoustical science and piano making.Baldwin also builds: Acrosonic Spinet and Console Pianos, Howard Spinet Pianos, Hamilton Studio Pianos.\n\nThe Baldwin Piano Company, incorporated under the laws of Ohio, is one of the largest manufacturers of keyboard instruments in the world today. An unbroken line of management has maintained the artistic ideals and progressive aims of the founders of the business. The Baldwin Piano Company maintains general offices in Cincinnati, a city ideally located for the supply of raw materials, transportation facilities and skilled labor. Baldwin's financial and technical resources provide a program of research which is perhaps unparalleled in the industry. With a complete line of pianos and organs: five lengths of Baldwin Grand Pianos in five styles, Acrosonic Spinet and console Pianos in all major furniture styles and many fine woods, the medium-priced Howard Spinet Piano and the 45\" Hamilton Studio Piano; two large electronic church organs (the Models 10A and 8A Baldwin Organs), two spinet home organs (the Series 51 and Model 30 Orga-sonic Organs) and a middle-sized complete organ styled two ways-for church and for home. The Baldwin Concert Grand is used and endorsed by the first rank of concert artists in each sphere of musical expression. These experts are the best qualified and most critical judges of piano tone; their approval is indisputable testimony to the greatness of the Baldwin Piano.\n\nBaldwin also has manufacturing plants in Fayetteville and Conway, Arkansas. The Baldwin Piano Company is represented by leading dealers in all principal cities and operates company-owned retail stores in New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nBETSY ROSS SPINET\n\nThis is one of America's most popular pianos because of its musical excellence and beautiful appearance. Available in 37 and 40 inch models, the Betsy Ross Spinet is handsomely designed in both traditional and modern styles in a wide choice of finishes. A new Custom Series line extends the choice in Betsy Ross Spinets to include a group of distinguished pianos featuring superfine cabinetwork and unusual finishes which may be ordered to fit any special decorating plan. Built only by the Lester Piano Manufacturing Company, each instrument carries the Lester name on the fall board and cast into the plate, just as each one carries the Lester 10 year guarantee. Most models are Damp Chaser equipped for regulated moisture control.\n\nThe entire resources of the Lester Company are behind the nationwide reputation for quality, tone and performance. The Lester Piano is the official piano of The Philadelphia Orchestra. The scales for the Betsy Ross Spinets were drawn by the late Paul M. Zeidler and their magnificent tone is proof of his genius. Recent manufacturing improvements have added to their excellence through achieving Lester's now famous Amplified Tone. The Betsy Ross Spinet is a one name, one quality, one price piano. The Betsy Ross Spinet is manufactured by the Lester Piano Manufacturing Company, Inc., in Lester, Pennsylvania, to which refer in this section.\n\nThe Betsy Ross Spinets were well constructed pianos, with one major exception. Shortly after WWII, Betsy Ross pianos created a new action using a new material called plastic. This was a disaster, while plastic at first was lighter and not subject to moisture, the newly invented plastic had a life span of about ten years before it became brittle and would shatter for no reason at all, and forevermore the Betsy Ross spinet piano was a non-instrument classified as bad. If the truth was known, replacing the plastic elbows in the action of a Betsy Ross gave you a perfectly acceptable piano for very little money.\n\nCABLE\n\nThis piano is manufactured by the Conover-Cable Piano Co. with offices and factory at Oregon, Ill. The original Cable Piano, an instrument of high standing and one which has always attained great popularity, is sold extensively in all parts of the United States and abroad. It possesses that pleasing attribute an exceptionally sweet tone, one of richness and exquisite delicacy, especially recommending it for studio and home use. Its lasting qualities are as unexcelled as skill, first-class workmanship and patient attention to the infinite details that piano building can insure. The original Cable Piano not only has the best qualities that distinguish an instrument of high standing, but those superior qualities of tone and action which are rendered possible by a construction and design especially adequate to the production of such desirable results.\n\nThe Cable Studio piano, due to its rugged durability, has been selected and recognized by many schools, colleges, music conservatories and public institutions where long lasting service is a requisite. The durable features embodied in original Cable pianos over many years are still being employed in attractively designed consoles and spinets.\n\nCABLE, HOBART M., CO.\n\nMore than a hundred thousand instruments bearing this name have been manufactured since 1911. The pianos are known for their musical excellence, durability and attractive cabinet work.\n\nCABLE-NELSON PIANO CO.\n\nOwned and controlled by the Everett Piano Company, South Haven, Michigan, (listed in this section). Cable-Nelson is the low-priced companion line to the Everett. Since 1905, over a quarter of a million Cable-Nelson pianos, bearing one of the most respected names in American piano manufacturing have been produced in the large Everett factory on the shore of Lake Michigan. Historically, the story of the origin of Cable-Nelson begins in Chicago in 1903 when Fayette S. Cable, a distinguished leader in the piano industry at the turn of the century, purchased two well established Chicago piano companies: the Lakeside Piano Company and the Sweetland Piano Company. These were merged into the Fayette S. Cable Company.\n\nCable joined forces with H. P. Nelson in 1905 to form the Cable-Nelson Piano Company. Messrs. Cable and Nelson, widely planning for the future of the company, sought to locate it in a fine, smaller community where the tradition of building outstanding pianos could be generated among the local working force and the standards of quality and perfection in their concept of manufacture could be insured. After surveying numerous mid-western localities, they chose South Haven which had ideal industrial facilities. From the very inception of the Cable-Nelson Company, Fayette S. Cable set the course of the company's operation in the direction of producing exceptionally fine pianos made of carefully selected materials and crafted with superior workmanship. And, starting out in a new manufacturing plant designed and built for the express purpose of making pianos, Cable rapidly proved his theory that the musical public would quickly recognize the design, tone and durability of Cable-Nelson pianos.\n\nFor the next two decades, the company prospered and produced fine grand and upright pianos that became proud possessions in homes all over the nation. In 1926, the Cable-Nelson Piano Company merged its plant, facilities and piano making with one of the greatest names in the American music industry, the Everett Piano Company, founded in Boston in 1883. When the two companies joined forces, the principle of product dependability at low cost was preserved in the Cable-Nelson line of pianos. And, through all of its history, the Cable-Nelson has represented one of this country's highest grades of pianos designed and built to be sold at a modest price to bring an excellent musical instrument to American families. Cable-Nelson cases are designed by William H. Cliagman of Grand Rapids, one of America 5 most noted furniture designers. From his drawing board in the center of the greatest furniture producing area of the country, Cliagman works in close association with the production engineering specialists at the South Haven plant. His objective always is freshness of design, together with lasting good taste and dignity. The Cable-Nelson is available in a variety of pC1.io(l and contemporary styles and light-to-dark finishes.\n\nCHALLIS, JOHN.\n\nHarpsichord and Clavichord maker. 85 E. Vernor Hwy., Detroit Mich. Established in 1930. The first to use cast aluminum for structural frames not dependent on a substructure of wood. The first to use combined Bakelite and aluminum wrestplanks in which tuning-pins cannot come loose either from excessive dryness or long use. Challis harpsichords are known for their light, reliable actions, superior carrying quality in concert halls, and beauty of tone. All instruments sold directly to customer.\n\nCHASE, A. B.\n\nEstablished by Alvin B. Chase in 1885. He had for ten years previous to that devoted his inventive genius to the creation of the A. B. Chase organs. The A. B. Chase was a success from its inception. The fine reputation enjoyed by the A. B. Chase organs prepared the way for a ready acceptance of the A. B. Chase pianos. This is an honored name in the annals of music in America, being closely associated with the love and development of music in the home. They have always been noted for splendid workmanship. The A. B. Chase is made in baby grands and spinet models. It is a product of the Aeolian American Corporation.\n\nCHASE & BAKER.\n\nInstruments bearing this name are made by the Estey Piano Corp. of Bluffton, Indiana.\n\nCHICKERING & SONS\n\nEstablished in 1823, Chickering & Sons celebrated in 1923 the completion o f a century of continuous manufacture of Chickering pianos. illustrious firm, the oldest piano house in the United States, has been at all times in the forefront and has received worldwide recognition for its part in developing the pianoforte on distinctive lines.Jonas Chickering, the founder was born at Mason Village, New Hampshire, in April, 1796, where, after a sound schooling, he thoroughly learned the business of cabinet making Impelled by a restless ambition to seek a larger field, he went to Boston in his early twenties.\n\nThere he entered the factory of a well known piano maker of those days and pursued a course of study in Piano making in its then primitive stage. It was not long before the genius of Jonas Chickering manifested itself, and he introduced a series of changes and improvements which have since become standard and which revolutionized the methods then prevailing. His name from the earliest times has been constantly linked with the Americanizing of the piano by methods of such importance and value that both America and Europe today admit their worth by universal adoption. To him must be ascribed the invention of the full iron plate for grand pianos recorded in 1837. This invention was accepted by the scientific world as one of far reaching importance; indeed, it proved to be the foundation of all modern piano construction, for without it the sonorous grands of today would have been impossible. He successfully solved the problem of the proper support for the great strain of the strings and defined a new era in the history of Piano making.\n\nIn 1843, Jonas Chickering invented a new deflection of the strings and in 1845 the first practical method for over stringing in square pianos, that is, instead of setting the strings side by side, substituting an arrangement, of them in two banks, one over the other, not only saving space but bringing the Powerful bass strings, directly over the most resonant part of the sound-board, a principle which obtains to this day in the construction of all pianos, both grands and uprights. Until the year 1852, Jonas Chickering superintended each department of his business with his usual scrupulous care but was relieved of much of this responsibility upon his taking into partnership his three sons, all of whom had received under their father a practical training of the highest order. The genius of C. Frank Chickering as a 'upscale\" draftsman soon became internationally known and acknowledged and to his extensive scientific research is to be attributed much of the renowned beauty of the Chickering tone. Not content with retaining this invaluable knowledge himself he imparted the secrets of his studies to those in the factory in whose gifts he had confidence, thus insuring their perpetuation.\n\nIn addition to the many patents taken out by Jonas Chickering, his sons and their successors, various methods exclusive to themselves have also been employed and there are in constant use operations of an abstract character which may be described as mechanical subtleties possessing great value and which are an integral part of the Chickering system. The above outline of the significant importance of the Chickeriag system will appeal to the practical minded but to those who would know more of the romance and charm which the Chickering story holds for the student of America's musical development. The significance and historic value of Chickering in the development of the pianoforte in America is seen in the preservation at the Ford Museum at Dearborn of several important Chickerings including the very first instrument made by Jonas Chickering in 1823. Others are: the first Chickering upright made in 1830 and the first Chickering grand completed prior to 1850.\n\nChickering & Sons have receive upwards of 200 first medals and awards. These have been received from States and sovereigns, international expositions and learned societies in all parts of the world embracing every known method of honoring distinguished merit. C. Frank Chickering was personally invested with the Imperial Cross of the Legion of Honor at the hands of Napoleon 111. The significance of this high honor is the more appreciated because of its extreme rarity, very few such honors having been bestowed for accomplishments in the fine arts. In 1923 Chickering & Son is were the recipients of a remarkable tribute from musicians and persons of prominence in all walks of life who united in celebrating the Hundredth Anniversary of the founding of Jonas Chickering's epoch making enterprises. A committee headed by the Honorable Calvin Coolidge (then Vice-President of the United States) carried to a successful and brilliant conclusion what was termed the Jonas Chickering Centennial Celebration, culminating in a banquet held at the Copley Plaza, Boston, at which Mr. Coolidge was the chief speaker. It marked in a most significant manner a century of musical achievement that is without parallel in the history of American piano making. The most famous virtuosi including pianists, singers and instrumentalists have exhausted superlatives in expressing their high admiration of the Chickering. The Handel and Haydn Society of Boston the world's foremost oratorio group, established 1815, has used the Chickering exclusively for more than a century.\n\nThe list of pianists, composers and musicians who have since its inception used and endorsed the Chickering piano is too long to include here. Several years ago this great house, content with its already rich background of achievement on the concert stage, turned its attention to the perfection of a smaller piano. The Chickering is essentially a piano for the home. The first successful small grand was a Chickering and, today, the exquisite instruments made by this famous house bear witness to the scientific and successful solution of the problem of bringing into the confines of pleasingly curtailed dimensions the rich sonority and perfect balance and nobility of tone of the larger grand. A notable achievement in both tone and beauty of case is seen in the Chickering pianos of the new vertical type especially designed to meet today's problem of space in the smaller apartments, preserving beauty and tonal quality. The present factory of Chickering & Sons, at East Rochester, New York, presents an example of superb modern equipment.\n\nCLAVICHORD The Clavichord was the favorite instrument of the 16th and 17th centuries maintaining its supremacy long after the appearance of the pianoforte. The Clavichord possessed four of the most vital points of the present day piano. namely - the independent sound board, metal strings. percussion method of agitating the strings and application of the damper to the strings. Bach, Mozart and even Beethoven used it.\n\nCONOVER\n\nThis piano belongs in the highest grade manufactured J Frank Conover was considered one of the world's greatest piano makers, a man who devoted over 40 years of his life to the study of a single problem-tone Behind the life work of Mr. Conover are the present unlimited resources of the maker the Conover-Cable Piano Co., with unsurpassed modernized factory facilities and an organization of most competent experts. The Conover scale has met and is constantly meeting the highest requirements of musicians. The patented sounding-board and frame construction in the small grand is part of an improved construction designed to maintain the proper curvature of the sounding board so necessary to preserve the original tonal beauty of the instrument. Instruments having this construction, bear the trade mark \"Crownstay.\" The Conover piano is a product of the Conover-Cable Piano Company with offices and factory located at Oregon, Illinois.\n\nCONOVER-CABLE PIANO CO.\n\nThis company was established in 1875, and honors J. Frank Conover who introduced his now famous piano in the same year. Located at Oregon, Illinois, this company manufactures a wide variety of both spinets and consoles. They have long been known for the lasting quality of their instruments and for their exquisite appearance as to finish. The plant is extremely large and well equipped so that every advantage can be taken of modern engineering techniques combined with old time hand operations. This company manufactured such famous instruments as the Cable, Kingsbury, Wellington and Schiller in strict accordance with their traditional exclusive patents and methods.\n\nDUO (THE HARDMAN DUO PLAYER-PIANO)\n\nAn exciting innovation in piano design and engineering has led to the creation of the Hardman DUO, the amazing new player-piano developed and manufactured exclusively by Hardman, Peck & Co. Unveiled in the Spring of 1957, the DUO is actually two pianos in one. At once an incomparable Hardman Console famed for acoustical richness is changed from manual to a player-piano, ready to play any of the hundreds of melodies on music rolls-everything from classics to rock 'n roll.\n\nA flick of the lever and the dropping of a panel are all it takes to release the pedals and finger-tip controls of the new DUO. Expression is extremely sensitive to the individual touch. Rhythm and nuances are even attainable through subtle practice on the pedals themselves. But other expression devices enable you to have complete shading control over any melody played. A tempo gauge, calibrated to any extra wide sweep can be set or changed during play by a flick of the finger. Soft bass and soft treble buttons may be depressed independently or together for muting melody or bass chords. In addition a volume lever sustains tones like the manual sustaining foot pedal. When manual play is again desired, raising the panel and another flick of the lever places all controls completely away from view, and at once you again have a manual Console with standard toe pedals.\n\nThe DUO is an ideal family piano, one that every member can play even those who have never had a lesson. Lyrics are printed right on the music rolls, so everyone can sing along as well. This adds greatly to the fun of family gatherings and parties. The young student in the family will find he learns faster on the DUO. He can play it manually for practice lessons, and as a player-piano to observe the technique of more advanced arrangements.\n\nEMERSON\n\nEstablished by William Emerson in 1849, it is one of the best known names in the piano world. William Emerson's idea was \"tone,\" not tone volume solely but tone characterized by clearness and sweetness. The immediate demand for his instruments produced abundant evidence of his success. They soon became known as the \"sweet-toned Emerson.\" The Emerson was made in small grands, spinets, being predominently a piano for the home. It was a product of the Aeolian American Corporation.\n\nESTEY PIANO CORPORATION.\n\nManufacturers of the famous Estey line of pianos. The factory and executive offices were located at Bluffton, In. The Estey business was established in 1869 and has ever since occupied a position of prominence in the pianoforte industry. The concern manufactures a complete line of pianos, including 4 ft.-6 in. grands, spinets and consoles. Estey pianos received an award at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, at the International Exposition, Torino, Italy, in 1911, at the Pan-American Exposition in San Francisco in 1915, and latterly they were awarded the gold medal at the Sesqui-Centennial~ Exposition in Philadelphia for unusual beauty of case design and the high quality of the instruments.\n\nEstey pianos were available in styles from period to traditional to modern, and in woods and finishes including African mahogany, American walnut, limed oak. Salem maple, blond mahogany and cherry.\n\nThe Estey Piano Corporation made notable improvements in piano building that have developed into the outstanding feature of Estey pianos. The Violin Bridge Construction (Patent Pending) is said to improve the tone quality, tone volume and sustaining tone in a most amazing manner. This discovery is very simple and is accomplished by reducing the mass of the treble bridge by means of running a furrow or cove along each 5i(lO of the bridge, thereby adding flexibility and reducing the weight of the bridge. The Direct Blow Action (Pat. No. 2096478) is used in all Estey consoles and spinets. This development permits of correct touch, maximum power and excellent responsiveness, and furthermore eliminates action worries and troubles. All Estey pianos have 7-ply hard maple planks.\n\nThe manufacture of Estey products was under the supervision of men who had been prominently identified with the piano industry of this country for many years, men who are authorities on quality pianoforte building.\n\nEVERETT PIANO COMPANY\n\nThe Everett Piano Company was established in Boston, Mass., in 1883, by the John J. Church Company, Cincinnati, Ohio, one of the leading music publishing concerns of America. In June, 1926, Everett merged with the Cable-Nelson Piano Company; and the firm moved manufacturing facilities from Boston to South Haven, Michigan.\n\nFrom its earliest inception, the Everett was a piano of high quality. Teresa Carreno, foremost pianist of her time; Walter Damrosch, long-time conductor of the N.Y. symphony and pioneer radio conductor; Cecile Chaminade, eminent French composer; the pianist Alfred Reisenauer, John Philip Sousa-these are but a few of the many great artists who played Everett grands on the concert stage or owned, used and admired them in private life. Because of the growing vogue of the small piano in the home and the shrinking market for grands. Everett ceased making grand pianos in 1946 and devoted their entire manufacturing facilities to small pianos.\n\nA turning point in the company's history was its acquisition in 1936 by George Stapely. (The firm subsequently became a subsidiary of the Meridan Corporation.) Mr. Stapely was a graduate engineer who had served as production manager for Chevrolet and authored a series of books on engineering and cost control. One of the greatest of Mr. Stapely's innovations was the development of the Balanced Tension back. The Everett Balanced Tension back construction (patented), introduced in 1946, was a most important improvement in scientific piano construction equaling in its engineering features that of the full cast plate now universally used. The principle is as old as history, but new as applied to pianos. Using cast metal levers which control the balance the 20 ton pull of the piano strings and synchronize with movements of the cast plate under varying conditions of heat and cold, damp or dry climates, Everett achieves 40% greater tone freedom and a much more solid tone.\n\nExhaustive testing and the subsequent use in all part~ of America during the last thirteen years have proven most conclusively that pianos so constructed stay in tune for a much longer period. All Everett consoles and spinets have this exclusive construction feature. In 1949, as the result of many years' research, Everett introduced the first small pianos with a dyna-tension scale, which, according to Everett, gives them the \"tonal beauty of a grand.\" The dyna-tension scale was developed and perfected by John A. Henns, America's foremost piano scale designer. This exclusive scale is possible only in Everett consoles and spinets with Balanced Tension back, because no other piano (i.e. a piano with wooden back posts instead of metal levers) has the strength to carry the increased load of a super high string tension. The company claims that the beautifully fashioned Everett offers the same \"concert fidelity\" . . . distortion-free volume more than adequate for today's home. . as a fine grard piano, which also has \"high tension\" strings.\n\nEverett employed one of America's leading furniture designers, William H. Clingman of Grand Rapids, Michigan, to create authentic period designs and finest modern and contemporary stylings in a complete range of light, medium and dark hardwood veneer finishes to harmonize with other fine furniture pieces.\n\nThe Everett School Piano has been purchased by more than 7,000 colleges and universities, schools and churches since 1948. It was the first school piano to meet and then exceed the rigid specifications for school pianos set by Dr. Elwyn C. Carter, head of the music department of Western Michigan University. The Style 11, incorporates many features including a greatly reinforced fallboard with concealed locks at both ends, extra sturdy back-posts (26% heavier than before), and a locking top (patent applied for). The piano comes in a choice of finishes.\n\nFISCHER, J. & C.\n\nManufactured by the Aeolian American Corporation. One of the oldest and most reputable pianos in the United States. 3. & C. Fischer succeeded directly to the business of R.& W. Nuons of New York, one of the pioneer houses in the American piano industry. The present title of J. & C. Fischer was given the firm in 1&40. John U. Fischer and Charles S. Fischer came of a most distinguished family of piano makers, their father having gain~l the coveted honor of being appointed \"piano-maker\" to Ferdinand I, King of Naples. The original factory of 3. C. Fischer was established in 1840 in St. John's Lane, New York City. The present factories and general offices are in East Rochester, N. Y. This house has taken a prominent part in the development of the piano industry in the United States. The 3. & C. Fischer pianos in small grands, consoles and School pianos of professional performance are c~iebrated for their fine, pure quality of tone, and the 3. & C. Fischer is further distinguished for the beauty of its case designs. In recent years special attention has been given to this important feature of artistic piano making so that even the regular models of Fischer pianos are noteworthy for their simplicity and grace, and the period models are superb examples of the adaptation of the decorative art of past centuries to the case of the modern piano.\n\nJESSE FRENCH & SONS\n\nIn January 1955, the P. A. Starck Piano Co. of Chicago purchased the Jesse French & Sons trade position. In the modern Starck factory, master craftsmen utilize materials and equipment to produce Jesse French pianos of beauty and lasting musical quality for the intimacy of the American home; the exactitude of the studio and the hard usage of the school. The Jesse French models are exclusive designs based on present day trends in home furnishings. Jesse French pianos are scientifically balanced in every detail, and are nationally known as instruments of the highest quality. Many satisfied purchasers recommend Jesse French pianos to their friends. It is not unusual for the second and third generations of families topurchase a Jesse French piano. Each Jesse French piano is equipped with the new Ori-Coustic High Tension Scale. This scale has been acclaimed by experts as one of the finest piano scales available, regardless of price.\n\nGULBRANSEN\n\nBy building a new multi-million dollar plant, Gulbransen became the first piano manufacturer in half a century to achieve this distinction, and this venture was especially noteworthy. The demonstration of faith in its splendid products, faith in the piano industry, and faith in America was entirely justifiable in the light that it became necessary to enlarge their facilities by an additional new big wing of 50,000 square feet, so that now theirs is the largest, all on one floor level, piano factory in all the world. The Gulbransen factory retained all its personnel in sales and plant craftsmen. The latter are in a new and modern environment, and have taken with them all the know-how of a craft that has taken many decades to learn and in most cases in herited and handed down from family to family. Gulbransen workmen average 40 years in piano making. Their product is their pride and they are bringing up their sons to follow. Beyond internal excellence of the mechanics that go into a Gulbransen is the forward-looking, alert thinking of the management, which was attentive to the style changes in their interior mode of the home. No Gulbransen piano owner is ever without an available new model to match the motif of home or studio.\n\nMore than 500,000 pianos have been manufactured by this company, thereby establishing it as one of the largest in the industry. The distribution of this vast number of instruments has been accomplished through a nation-wide organization of dealers whose high ethics in merchandising conform with those of the company itself. Through this widespread dealer organization, Gulbransen pianos have been sold into many homes and, in addition, are to be found in more than 7,500 schools, churches, conservatories of music, radio stations and the studios of many prominent musicians. The highly trained and experienced technicians who make up the Gulbransen personnel are carrying on the high ideals and standards instilled by the company's distinguished founder, A. G. Gulbransen. Of this personnel the most important members are the \"men who make them,\" a group of artisans who have literally spent their lives employing those principles of piano craftsmanship without which no fine piano can be created.\n\nBacking up their efforts, Gulbransen is known for having only the latest and finest in manufacturing equipment. Numerous patented devices are in daily use for research and improvement of products and under the guidance of E. W. Okeson, factory superintendent, an authority on scale drawing and piano building, the present line of Gulbransen Supertone scale pianos has been brought to a higher standard than ever before. A large number of distinguished models of period, modern and conventional designing are offered, and interior decorators widely acclaim the authenticity and gracious dignity of Gulbransen cabinet styling. Prominent among these are the new spinet-type and console models which include a variety of beautiful encasements in a number of sizes. In addition to these new type pianos Gulbransen has an unusually complete line of conventional grands, uprights and other models, all incorporating those features of construction and tonal excellence which are characteristic of the Gulbransen pianos. Owners of instruments of this make have the eminent satisfaction of knowing that \"the name of the founder is the name on the piano.\n\nHADDORFF\n\nThe elder Haddorff was recognized as a genius of first rank in the design and creation of fine pianos, equally eminent in his artistic conception of piano tone and in his mastery of the mechanical problems of fine piano construction. His scales, both for his concert grand and other professional pianos and for the smaller pianos, have been judged by experts as important contributions to both the scientific and artistic sides of piano acoustics.\n\nOn the material side, he felt that his most significant achievement was his original theory and practice of sound board design and layout, involving a novel formula for the tapering of the board itself and the proper allocation and dimensions of ribs and bridges. It is this feature which is mainly responsible for that even quality and fullness of power throughout the whole piano range which is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Haddorff Pianos. Other mechanical improvements due to the mechanical ingenuity of C. A. Haddorff, some of them patented, are too numerous for listing. During the year 1935, the Haddorff Piano Co. created one of the great piano sensations of all time by the introduction of a new and original piano form known as the \"\"vertichord This piano achieved what was up to that time regarded as an impossibility, a vertical piano which could never be called an \"upright,\" but which preserved all the advantages of that type of piano in the way of space economy, sound board area, and string lengths.\n\nThe Vertichord was the original and the prototype of all of the pianos which have since come to be known as Spinets and Consoles and whith now account for the great majority of the total pIano production. The basic design ard construction of the Vertichord are fully covered by patents. The Vertichord presents a further sensational improvement in small piano tonal development in the form of a secondary sound board connected with the main board by means of a \"tone post\" called the acoustic coupler. This invention increases the sound board area by more than half, with a corresponding improvement in the power and quality of tone.\n\nHAMILTON\n\nThis name designated the 45\" studio piano built by The Baldwin Piano Company. Functionally styled, it is built in mahogany, dark and light oak, walnut. and ebonized. The name \"Hamilton\" is registered in the U. S. Patent Office. Baldwin also builds-Baldwin Grand Pianos, Acrosonic Spinet and Console Pianos, Howard Spinet Pianos, Baldwin Electronic Organs and Orga-sonic Spinet Organs.\n\nHAMPTON\n\nPianos bearing this name were built by Story & Clark Piano Company, to whom refer.\n\nHARDMAN, PECK & CO.\n\nFounded in 1842. Executive offices, 33 W. 57th St., New York City. One of the oldest and most distinguished manufacturers in the piano industry. Has a world-wide reputation. For fifteen years the Hardman was the official piano of the Metropolitan Opera Co. and was highly and enthusiastically endorsed by leading opera stars. Enrico Caruso personally used and endorsed the Hardman piano exclusively during his entire career in the United States. For years they have been used by pianists, singers and musicians of international fame.\n\nHardman, Peck & Co. make a specialty of building instruments for export in addition to their large domestic market, and many thousands of their instruments are now in use throughout the world. Their long experience in exporting pianos guarantees absolute satisfaction. Their pianos were distinguished by the variety and artistic character of their musical qualities, including purity, delicacy, and singing character of tone, and also for their finely balanced and sensitive touch. These characteristics are prepared for long periods of time as the pianos are especially constructed to hold the tone. Hardman, Peck & Co. also manufactures Hardman Grands and Spinet Type pianos; also Harrington Grands and Console Type pianos. They are exclusive manufacturers in U.S.A. of the Minipiano.\n\nHARPS. See Lyon & Healy\n\nHARPSICHORDS.-Refer to John Challis\n\nHARRINGTON\n\nManufactured in the Harrington Department of Hardman, Peck & Co., New York, since 1891. A moderately priced instrument of superior qualities perpetuated by a durability resulting from the best materials fashioned by expert workmen. To the musician, the Harrington console offers an instrument of superior power and richness of tone, plus that durable construction so characteristic of the Hardman. The recognized standing of Hardman, Peck & Company, who have been preeminent in the manufacture of fine pianos since 1842.\n\nHOWARD\n\nThis name designates a spinet piano built by The Baldwin Piano Company. Its cabinetry was in a Contemporary style, in either mahogany or walnut. The name is registered with the U. S. Patent Office.\n\nHOWARD, R.\n\nRefer to Janssen Piano Co., listing.\n\nIVERS & POND PIANO COMPANY\n\nThis old established, nationally prominent, and highly regarded concern continues with its policy of building only pianos of high quality. Incorporated in 1880. The Ivers & Pond piano is noted for its structural integrity, extreme durability and charming tone quality. It has always enjoyed a wide national distribution, and the house has never changed from the original corporate form chosen at the start.\n\nOver seven hundred conservatories and schools and over eighty thousand homes throughout the country use Ivers & Pond Pianos. In years past the company has been one of the most extensive and consistent advertisers in the piano industry so that the name \"Ivers & Pond\" has become almost a household word in musical circles throughout the land. Many practical improvements and special features enhancing durability and tonal qualities have been developed in the Ivers & Pond factories and particular attention has been paid to artistic styling of the various piano types. The historic policy of this well-known house, of building quality instruments only, is being strictly maintained, as is also their principle of constantly striving to give greater value to the purchaser.\n\nJANSSEN PIANO CO., INC.\n\nOne of the most respected names , among manufacturer of keyboard instruments in America today, and one of tile few remaining companies in the industry still controlled and actively directed by the descendants of the founding family. The Janssen family owned and operated one of the largest and best equipped piano manufacturing plants in New York City, where skilled artisans perpetuate a tradition of more than 100 years of dedication to the highest standards of quality piano construction. The company's steadfast insistence on integrity of craftsmanship and superiority of materials has earned for its products a truly distinctive reputation, not only with other manufacturers, hut with America's foremost piano dealers and the music loving public everywhere.\n\nAlthough the Janssen piano has gained a broad acceptance among schools, musical institutions, and teachers of music, it has become widely known as \"The Home Piano of America\" because of the many exclusive features and qualities that make it the ideal instrument for use and enjoyment in the home, the traditional cradle of musical appreciation and learning. The superiority of the Janssen piano was the result of the company's continued policy of product research and refinement, and few companies in the industry can point to such an impressive record of successful improvements in design, materials, beauty of tone, mechanical excellence, and the efficiency and exactness of manufacturing procedures. Proud owners of Janssen pianos throughout the United States and in many foreign lands as well are reaping the benefits of this policy of product improvement and development, for no other piano has so much lasting value built into it, and no piano, regardless of price, has all the exclusive features found in a Janssen. The Janssen Console line of quality leaders in the fine piano field are found many of the exclusive features that make the purchase of a Janssen such a sound investment. One of them, the built-in Music Desk Light, has been proclaimed as one of the most beneficial improvements in the history of piano manufacturing. The soft illumination of this fluorescent light, directly below the music, makes other room lights unnecessary and is a priceless safeguard of good eyesight for children and adults alike. The light also effectively combats dampness:, the greatest enemy of a piano's delicate inner mechanism.\n\nThe remarkable strength and durability of grand piano construction is achieved in Janssen's exclusive four-section cast iron plate, which guarantees longer instrument life and greater tone quality. This is but another of the numerous quality features that make the Janssen the superlative instrument that it is and assure the purchaser of a lifetime of pleasure and satisfaction. Other fine and desirable Janssen Mignon features include beautiful hand-rubbed lacquer finishes, truly authentic period styles, responsive Direct-Blow Action, solid Sitka Spruce sounding boards, sturdy six-post backs, three functional pedals, including bass sustaining, reinforced moth-proof hammers, Maple tuning pin bushings, and the most rigid pin-block construction possible, through Hard-Rock Maple laminations and nickel-plated pin-block locks.\n\nIt was not only the intrinsic quality of Janssen piano construction that kept the Janssen name in the forefront of the industry, but also the success of the company's engineering imagination. The Janssen Spinet, for instance, is the smallest full-keyboard spinet piano in the world with standard Direct-Blow Action, and represented one of the truly great piano values on the market. The Janssen Chord Piano was another much-publicized invention born of the inspiration and know-how of Janssen technicians, that by an integral system of diminutive colored lights, enabled anyone, regardless of age, to sit down and have fun at the piano without ever having had a lesson. The best understanding of the continued excellence of the Janssen Piano can be found in the words of the famous Janssen Creed, which was written many years ago by the founder and summarizes the principles that govern the company today:\n\n\"This is my creed and on it I have built my Piano and Reputation! To give you as nearly as possib!e a dollar's value for every dollar you give me. To treat you as I want to be Justly. Since you may possibly know little or nothing about the material or craftsmanship that goes into the piano you bought, you must naturally rely on me. I want you to do that-and I promise that your confidence shall not be misplaced. Following this creed for a life time , has earned a Janssen reputation, that my product and methods must; maintain. I want to be right and do right. If I fail in any one thing, it will never be because I wanted to.\"\n\nKIMBALL, W. W.\n\nEstablished 1857. An old and distinguished house of international standing and reputation. Since its inception, the firm has been under the continuous ownership and control of the Kimball family. One of the world's quality manufacturers of pianos, grand pianos, consoles, consolettes, spinets and studio models.\n\nThe Kimball plant, occupies approximately 200,000 square feet of floor space. The building is equipped with modern machinery and appliances for an ideal mixture of fine craftsmanship and modern methods. In the manufacture of these instruments the best and most reliable materials are used and an exceptionally high class of labor is employed. Completion of the plant in May, 1956, revealed completely new dry kiln and lumber handling equipment, extensive conveyor systems, and the air-conditioned office facilities. The program included acquisition of the newest modern machinery, including many special machines developed by Kimball engineers and employees.\n\nThe Kimball line of grands includes several sizes Vertical type pianos included a special school and studio model.

The Kimball technical staff draws all scales, designs' actions and cases and various other parts; thus insuring the precision and uniforra quality that are so important to the performance of a fine piano. The company even operates a completely equipped machine shop where have been built many ingenious special machines found only in this plant.\n\nThe Kimball instruments have won recognition at many of the world's expositions, among these the Chicago Columbian Exposition, 1893, gave the Kimball Co. \"an award of superlative merit\" for having attained the highest standard of excellence in its particular manufacture. The international Jury of Awards of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at Seattle, 1909, conferred the highest award upon Kimball grands and uprights and pipe organs, stating, \"Their upright and grand pianos typify the highest perfection in tone, scale, action and design, in American piano making.\" At the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha, Nebr., in 1898, Kimball pianos received the diploma and only gold medal awarded any piano. Highest awards from the Panama-Pacific Exposition at San Francisco were announced in the summer of 1916, Grand piano medal. Hundreds of world famous musicians and singers have used Kimball pianos, 100th in public and for their private use, and have given them unqualified endorsements. The Kimball is heard on the concert stage today as it has been continuously for over half a century. Several thousand churches, schools, colleges and public institutions have purchased Kimball pianos.\n\nAmong the colleges, universities and conservatories which have purchased Kimball pianos: Cosmopolitan School of Music, American Conservatory of Music, Chicago, Barry College, Miami, Fla., Birmingham Conservatory of Music, Ward Belmont College, Detroit Conservatory of Music, U.

Several thousand Kimball pianos are used in churches and in associated schools. A large number of radio stations, hotels and other public institutions have also purchased and are using Kimball pianos.\n\nKimball was the first to perfect a laminated spruce sounding board ... one of the most important piano improvements in generations . . . as described above; first to develop electronic gluing, which permits using waterproof glues in piano case construction; first to pioneer lacquer to supplant varnish, producing a perfect finish, a better product . . . for less money; first to perfect a keybed leveling device which eliminates wedges and shims, produces a perfect key level; first to pioneer the type of white and black keys now used by the entire industry; first to make a piano in genuine fruitwood; first to design authentic French Provincial and Early American pianos; first to develop a grand scale for a 5' size grand piano.\n\nKINGSBURY\n\nThe Kingsbury Piano was manufactured by the Conover-Cable Piano Co., General Office and factory at Oregon Ill., to which refer. This instrument is one of the most popular pianos manufactured and its popularity rested firmly upon its merit. It was only possible to build a piano of the Kingsbury's superior qualities, and sell it at the price for which it is sold, as the result of large volume and public acceptance.\n\nKNABE & CO., WM.\n\nAs a division of Aeolian American Corporation. Among the few really celebrated and artistic pianofortes in the United States, the time-honored Knabe ranks pre-eminent, being distinguished for a distinctive tone quality that has often been described as the nearest approach to the human singing voice. During its celebrated career 115 years, it has always been identified with the high est standards of manufacture, as well as by its close association with the artistic world. It has had a notable share in the development of musical intelligence and culture in the United States.\n\nThe Knabe dates back to 1837 when William Knabe founded the business in the city of Baltimore, where he had been working in various factories since his arrival in this country in 1832. He had previously acquired a broad practical knowledge of piano craftsmanship in all its branches. A man of mechanical ability that classed him as a genius, with the steadfast ambition to produce only the best, he enlisted an organization of experts, deeply imbued with those high ideals which have been handed down to the present day. The craftsmanship that makes the Knabe a leader among all pianos is not an acquisition of one generation but a pedigree of skill that has continued from that idealistic beginning. Knabe pianos have always been distinctive for touch, durability and endurance, and their glorious tone combines power, sweetness, delicacy and a poetic singing quality. The pages of its history are rich with great names of composers, singers and pianists of highest renown whose musical triumphs have been shared by Knabe. It enjoyed a pleasant and intimate relation with such great figures in the world of music as: Puccini, Tschaikovsky, von Bulow, Lehar, Nordica, Calve, and Humperdinck .\n\nSince 1926 it has been the official piano of the Metropolitan Opera Company, used publicly and privately and always at the Opera House by the great artists of that celebrated organization. Among present artists who have added their personal testimonials of admiration to the endorsement of the Opera Company are: Licia Albanese, Mildred Allen, Lorenzo Alvary, Lucine Amara, Salvatore Baccaloni, Daniele Barioni, Kurt Baum, Rudolf Bing, Jussi Bjoerling, Giuseppe Campora, George Cehanovsky, Fausto Cleva, Nadine Conner, Lisa Della Casa, Mario Del Monaco, Victoria de Los Angeles, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Mattiwilda Dobbs, Otto Edelmann, Rosalind Elias, Dezso Ernster, Paul Franke.

In these institutions great durability as well as exquisite tone is demanded, for the pianos in the teaching and practice rooms are used without interruption for several hours each day. Especially notable in this list is the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester, which has purchased nearly 200 Knabes; the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, in which were installed 115 Knabe grands; the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music in Indianapolis; Phoenix College, Phoenix, Ariz.; San Jose State College, San Jose, Calif.; State Teachers College, Emporia, Kansas.; University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas.; University of Wichita, Wichita, Kansas.; State School for the Blind, Baton Rouge, La.; Southern University, Baton Rouge, La.; Louisiana Polytechnic institute, Ruston, La.; Hamilton College, Clinton, N.

Knabes are sold all over the United States by leading dealers who have been chosen for their long established reputation for responsibi]ity and ethical standards.\n\nKOHLER & CAMPBELL, INC.\n\nFounded in 1896 as a partnership between Charles Kohler and J. C. Campbell, in less than 20 years Kohler and Campbell became the world's leading manufacturer of upright and grand pianos, player pianos and automatic reproducing actions. The first factory was in a small loft building on 14th Street in New York City but after the company was established only a few years the business expanded to such a degree that it moved to much larger quarters, occupying an entire building built for it at 50th Street and Eleventh Avenue and continued to expand into adjoining and nearby buildings until it occupied over one million feet of floor space. Under the direction of Charles Kohler, who became the entire owner upon Mr. Campbell's death in 1904, Kohler & Campbell popularized the player piano in America, manufacturing player actions for other piano makers in its subsidiaries and making available to the public for the first time the music of the world's leading artists through the Welte-Mignon reproducing action.\n\nThe position of Kohler & Campbell in the piano industry is well illustrated by the distinguished piano companies either founded or acquired by it during its 65 years of operation. Among those companies are Hazelton Brothers, Francis Bacon Piano Company, Behning Piano Company, Milton Piano Company, Behr Brothers, Brambach Piano Company, Davenport and Treacy Company, Kroeger Piano Company, McPhail, Stultz and Bauer, Astor Piano Company, Newton Piano Company, Waldorf Piano Company and Ejur Brothers. Nearly every major piano manufacturer purchased player actions from the Auto Pneumatic Actior Company and The Standard Pneumatic Action Company, manufacturing subsidiaries of Kohler & Campbell during the days of the player piano. Their combined production exceeded 50,000 player actions per year.\n\nAlthough through the acquisition of the Francis Bacon Piano Company, Kohler & Campbell traces its heritage back to 1789, the date of the founding of the first piano company in America by John Jacob Astor, progressive leadership and modern production techniques have always been outstanding attributes of the company. Julius A. White, originally joined the company in 1921 and became president in 1930. Under his direction, the former loosely-knit organization was consolidated administratively and the manufacturing facilities were all brought under one roof. Following World War II, he move the factories from their 50th Street location to the Bronx and a larger, more modern building. Again in 1954, seeing that the manufacture of durable goods in a multi-story urban plant was no longer economically practical, he engineered the move of the entire manufacturing facility from New York to Granite Falls, North Carolina. The site was carefully picked for its skilled woodworkers and it proximity to the heart of the Appalachian hardwood lumber producing area. Kohler & Campbell offered a complete line of spinet and console pianos. The spinet was offered in five models and ten wood and finish combinations. The console was available in six different models and eight different finishes. The 45\" Studio designed principally for use in studios, auditoriums or school rooms and it is of extra-rugged construction in three finishes.\n\nIn 1956, the presidency of the company passed on to a third generation when Charles Kohler White, grandson of the founder, assumed the position. Charles Kohler White met his accidental death in 1957 after which Charles L. Clayton was elected president. The other officers were: Rita Kohler White, daughter of the founder, secretary, Robert H. Meuser, treasurer and Gaylord M. Huffstader, sales manager. The company was represented by W. O. Patrick Care; Paul Corbett, Louis J. Nienaber, Bert C Bruce, Sr., Hyrum B. Summerhays, E. G. Burghardt and Robert T. Furst, founder and creator of the National Piano Institute, Editor of the Piano Times, and author of The Bluebook of Pianos.\n\nKRAKAUER BROS.\n\nManufacturers of Krakauer Bros. grand, upright, console and spinet pianos. In the course of their long and successful career Krakauer Bros. have been a family concern and never allied with combinations outside the organization. This house was founded in 1869 by Simon Krakauer, an excellent musician, who came to America in 1853 with his son David.\n\nThe manufacture of Krakauer pianos is entirely confined to one high grade quality-the Krakauer piano-which is available in a wide variety of attractive designs in Grand and Vertical models. For many years the Krakauer is noted for exceptionally artistic and uniquely attractive case designs, durable constru~tion, and an exceptionally rich tonal quality. They have successfully pioneered the patented closed back construction which permits the piano to be placed anywhere in the room like a grand piano and without the necessity of placing it with its back to the wall. One of the most successful models in this design is the Krakauer \"Serenade\" which because it can be faced out in a room like a grand piano has a \"grand like\" free flowing quality of tone. Most of their spinet pianos also contain the exclusive Acoustic Tone Chambers which strikingly re-enforce and enhance the tone.\n\nThe Krakauer line is definitely a \"Decorator\" line of styling. Every model is authentic in its derivation and is not just a conglomeration of senseless frills. All this is based upon the close attention of the \"one family\" element in the organization, with an honest and intimate interest in every piano made. Krakauer Bros have no mass-production. A unique, exclusive feature of all Krakauer pianos is the new Bridge Braced Back construction, claimed by Krakauer engineers to be the strongest and most durable in the world. Krakauer Bros. have supplied their pianos to a large number of great musicians of today and the past who have, without solicitation, given eloquent testimony and endorsement to the worth and quality of the Krakauer piano. There are over 1,000 Krakauer pianos in the Public Schools of New York City alone. The factory was a modern, light five story corner building located at 115 East 138th Street, New York City.\n\nKRANICH & BACH\n\nOne of the oldest, most noted and prominent firms in the piano industry, which, for nearly a century has enjoyed the highest reputation. This business was established in 1864 by Helmuth Kranich and Jacques Bach, both practical piano makers of tried experience. The firm soon became known as makers of distinction, and almost from the start Their instruments have been regarded as among the most reliable made. In 1873 Messrs Kraaich & Bach moved its factories and warerooms to East Twenty-third Street, New York. In 1890 the business was incorporated. This company prides itself upon the fact that it possesses what is considered one of the most complete and up-to-date piano manufacturing plants in the country, equipped with the finest machinery and most modern appliances. They belong to the very small group of famous makers whose pianos are among the highest class made in the world.\n\nThey are noted for durability, and for a tone which is distinguished for its purity. singing quality, brilliancy and carrying power. Obtained awards at the Mechanics' Fair, Boston; Philadelphia Centennial in 1876, and Chicago World's Fair in 1893. Represented all over the country by dealers of prominence, most of whom feature it as their leader. Among the famous products of these renowned makers is a magnificent concert grand which made its debut in the trade in the spring of 1916.\n\nThe four foot six inch Grandette was introduced to the trade and the public in 1934, and is among the smallest artistic grands on the market. This instrument is not an abbreviated grand in the sense that it represents a larger scale cut dawn, but is a grand built with an entirely new scale especially drawn for this instrument, which embodies all the sterling features of Kranich & Bach construction. and differs only in dimensions from the larger grands of the same make. The close of 1935 saw the tests and experimental work on a small upright, incorporating the Violyn piano plate (another notable patent of this house), satisfactorily completed. This commendable addition to an established and complete line of quality pianos is encased in a newly designed model of the vertical type, and trade marked \"Grandette\" Console. The scale, layout, materials and craftsmanship used in the manufacture of this new \"Grandette\" Console are identical with those employed only in Kranich & Bach pianos, resulting in a characteristic Kranich & Bach piano. During the year 1937 they manufactured and put on the market a still smaller size-3 ft. 3 in. Console, which also has an original Kranich & Bach scale, developed in their own factory. It was made in several styles and considered one of the most beautiful Console cases being shown. The house perhaps more than ever before in its history, convincingly displayed all of the determination to be fully alert and mindful of modern business methods and requirements yet conservative in its adherence to its traditions and ideals laid down by the founders.\n\nLAUGHEAD, GORDON, COMPANY\n\nEstablished 1942. Factory was located in Grand Haven, Michigan. Gordon Laughead Piano Co. were manufacturers of beautiful vertical pianos produced under the personal direction of the founder of the company, .Gordon Laughead. He was a leader in the piano industry for forty years, is the son of the late Edward Rankin Laughead, a practical piano builder and tuner. This fine firm has kept abreast of the demand for small 88-note vertical pianos of the highest quality. They build a complete line of Spineta Consoles and School Pianos receiving wide acceptance. An engineering staff equal to the best, is headed by Joseph Klepac, a graduate of the Trade School for Piano Builders, Berlin, Germany. Mr. Kiepac is recognized on two continents as a respected and outstanding piano authority and acoustical engineer. Mr. Klepac's latest scalewith the much advertised \"Miracle Bridge\" has received great praise throughout the nation, including a fine compliment from Dean Sternberg, Baylor University, Waco Texas, America's largest Baptist University. Mr. Klepac's famed acoustic laboratory is also in Grand Haven.\n\nGordon Laughead Spinets, Consoles and School pianos are actually custom built. Thirteen bearings or measurements are made for each piano in fitting the bridge to the cast iron plate. Craftsmen with years of practical experience now combine their efforts to create an outstanding vertical piano of superb, high quality, acoustically perfect and attractively designed. The finest materials obtainable are furnished by the world's leading supply houses. The firm's trademark, \"Gordon Laughead Piano-fortes\" is cast in the plate of each instrument.\n\nLESTER PIANO COMPANY See Betsy Ross Above\n\nThe Lester Piano Manufacturing Company also produces the well known Betsy Ross Spinets, which have met with outstanding success. This is a complete line pianos including spinets and consoles, 37 and 40 inch models in a wide variety of traditional and modern styles to suit every demand. Lester also makes a 44 inch studio upright piano designed especially for school use with extra long strings for exceptional quality of tone and volume. In addition, the Lester Piano Manufacturing Company produces a 73 note spinet piano for those who want a piano smaller than the Betsy Ross Spinet. Most styles of Lester Betsy Ross Spinets and Console Pianos are equipped with the exclusive Damp-Chaser to insure regulated moisture control at all times. The Lester is the only piano equipped with this amazing Damp-Chaser that protects the piano from dampness in all climates, reduces the number of tunings, keeps the piano in perfect playing condition and prolongs the life of the instrument.\n\nIn 1951, the Lester Piano Mfg. Co. added a Custom Series line to the popular Betsy Ross Spinets. This new series included distinctive models in unusual finishes; or any style could be finished to actual order. This Custom Series of Betsy Ross Spinets was met with wide public acceptance and was promoted by Lester national advertising and by dealer advertising.\n\nThe Lester \"one name . . one quality . . one price\" policy was met with the universal approval of dealers and consumers. This policy meant that all Lester Pianos were always of the same musical quality, any difference in price was based on the case. There were no ghost or stencil pianos made by this company It means too that everyone receives equal value since there was only one price for a Lester Piano and that was the factory advertised price. This practice was called a \"Fair Trade\" policy but was outlawed as price fixing at a later date.\n\nShortly after World War II, Lester introduced a line of spinets using a new \"Plastic\" in their actions, plastics were very new in 1947,plastic was new and not intended to be used in piano actions, after a few years these actions began to fall apart. The Lester Company issued what was to become the first major recall of a major purchase. All of the plastic elbows in the actions were replaced on those pianos that were found to be defective. These pianos turn up from time to time, the parts are still available to correct this problem through most piano repair shops.\n\nLlNDEMAN & SONS\n\nEstablished in 1836 by William Lindeman. An endeavor to give the highest possible value in materials and workmanship at a moderate price was the keystone of an outstanding success. Lindeman made not only in the small grands but in the highly popular spinets in which the beautiful Lindeman tone has been brought into the confines of these smaller cases. Lindeman was a product of the Aeolian American Corp.\n\nLYON & HEALY\n\nManufacturers of harps and harp accessories. Since 1889 this firm has made a wide variety of quality products which have earned international recognition and fame.\n\nMAGIC PIANO-HARP\n\nA harpsichord mandolin-guitar attachment piano. It was equally effective for both popular and classical music, enabling a pianist to play the compositions of Bach, Handel and other masters in the authentic harpsichord tradition at the same time having a mandolin-guitar effect for jazz, blue and honky-tonk\n\nMALCOLM LOVE.\n\nInstruments bearing this name are well made and have a wide spread reputation for their tonal excellence.

Though tracing its origin back to 1860, the first Sohmer piano was actually built in 1872, when Hugo Sohmer founded the firm of Sohmer & Co., in New York.\n\nLocated in an entire building constructed to their special requirements, and in an atmosphere that attracts connoisseurs of all the arts, Sohmer& Co., Inc. display pianos representative of the finest furniture styles. Each model is a decorative accomplishment as well as a remarkable musical instrument. The phenomenal success of the Sohmer Console-Vertical has in no way diminished the fact that Sohmer & Co. has always been and always wHI be-A Grand Piano House. Ever since the invention of the baby grand by Sohmer in 1884-.Sohmerr grand pianos have had a dominating role in the home market. This Grand is remarkable for the volume and resonance of its tone, despite its diminutive size, being only five feet long and four feet five inches wide. Hugo Sohmer patented the first five foot grand in 1884 and the style 50 Grand of today is the logical development of this pioneer effort. 75 years of continuous improvement of tone model is typical of the Sobmer pursuit of perfection and the Sohmer Family states, without reservation or exception that it is their confirmed belief that no other small grand approximates the Sohmer in tone and response. Its perfect symmetry of form and the extraordinary quality of its tone result from its scientific scale and integrally cast C'Apo D'Astro bar, another patented feature of Sohmer construction. Hugo Sohmer's first five foot grand, made in 1881, is still in use and is played daily by visitors to the Sohmer Galleries in New Yoik. This piano has all the original parts. No repairs have been made because none have been necessary.\n\nSohmer has also pioneered in the introduction of the popular small pianos known as \"Spinets.\" Never since its inspection, has the Sohmer console been an abbreviated upright piano. Sohmer & Co. early discarded all thoughts and precepts of upright construction concentrating rather on the principles of the grand piano scale and string distribution. As a result the Sohmer Console Vertical has long been known as \"The Musicians' Console.\" As the science of acoustics has progressed, they have applied new principles in the making of their \"Console Vertical,\" creating tonal results considered impossible only a short time ago. Due to an original scale featuring a fan disposition of the strings these small pianos are a revelation of modern acoustics with their brilliant treble, full middle tones and sonorous bass. All Sohmer Console-Verticals are guaranteed to have more than 96% grand piano string distribution.\n\nEducational institutions had to make a critical choice of musical equipment. To purchase the best available instruments that the school budget would allow, this was long before the commercial practice of giving the school instruments for advertising and promotional considerations. Each school or university would usually make their selection based on which piano offered the most value exceeding the price, most of them selected Sohmer. No comment on the Sohmer piano is complete without a repetition of the famous Sohmer Creed:\n\n\"To build the finest piano that human ingenuity, skill, knowledge, craftsmanship and family tradition can possibly produce. To utilize the world's markets to procure the best materials regardless of cost. To maintain that quality unswervingly and never to sacrifice one iota to gain an added profit, no matter how great. To preserve the integrity and individuality of the Sohmer institution free from outside affiliation or influences. To be governed always and under all circumstances by sound principles and never by expediency.\"\n\nSTARCK P.A. CHICAGO, ILL\n\nManufacturers of \"Starck\" and \"Jesse French\" that can be found in the world today. The company is engaged in a program of modernization and expansion of its production facilities which will make even more of its highly prized instruments available to the public.\n\nIn the making of a high grade piano, three things are absolutely essential. In the first place, every piece of material that goes into it must be perfect; second, the workmanship must be of a quality and skill that is gained only after painstaking years of apprenticeship. But the third and most important essential is a thorough knowledge of piano making; the sources for supply of rare andfiner materials, and the ability of fabricating these parts to that degree of perfection and accuracy found only in pianos of highest quality and price. The extreme care with which a Starck piano is made, and the high order of its workmanship will at once be apparent to anyone upon inspection of the piano itself.\n\nEvery Starck piano built is produced under the watchful eye of a member of the Starck family who now represent the third generation of the famous piano builder and founder, P.

Richard Wagner described his Steinway grand as \"a noble work of art,\" and added that he knew nothing that could compare with the perfection reached by the 5teinways in pianoforte building. Franz Liszt asked to be permitted to add his homage, and wrote a special cornposition to illustrate their tone sustaining pedal. Anton Rubinstein declared their instruments to be \"unrivaled,\" and Hector Berlioz, while admiring their \"splendid sonority,\" expressed his views of the indebtedness all artists were under to the house for the introduction of improvements of supreme value.\n\nTo an infinite number of similar testimonials, Ignace Jan Paderewski added his declaration that the Steinway grand he used had been \"an inspiration\" to him on account of \"the grandeur, power and ideal beauty of tone\" and the \"absolute perfection of touch and mechanism.\n\nPages could be taken up with the patented improvements invented by Steinway & Sons. Among the principal are: Their method of agraffe adjustment, their application for over~stringing in grands, which they later applied to uprighits; their duplex scale, their new system of \"scaling,\" and their cupola metal frame, which was approved by that great authority on acoustics, Helmholtz. One of their patented improvements is their grand metal string frame with Capo d'Astro bar, case hardened at point of contact with strings, by which the beautiful tonal qualities of a grand piano have been reproduced in upright form.\n\nThe Steinway Accelerated Action is one of the most outstanding improvements in piano construction in the past half century.

At twenty, he was a busy piano teacher, and at twenty two he began to manufacture the pianos he knew and loved so well. Hampton Story's first instruments were built in a modest workshop overlooking Lake Champlain. There, with typical Yankee thoroughness he constructed pianos of such high quality that his name Soon spread, and within a few years buyers were coming from such distant cities as New York, Buffalo and Cleveland. A true New Englander, Story had an instinctive dislike of superficialities and shoddy methods, insisting on the best or nothing attitude. Six years after he had"
