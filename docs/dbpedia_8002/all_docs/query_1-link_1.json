        "text": "J. Estey & Co. (1864-c.1882) and Estey Organ Co. (c.1882-c.1955) made numerous types and styles of reed organs, including\n\nFlattop Cottage Organs\n\nParlor Organs\n\nFolding Organs\n\nChapel Organs\n\nTwo-Manual with Pedal Reed Organs\n\nEach Estey reed organ was assigned a unique serial number.\n\nLook Inside\n\nTo search for a serial number, lift the top of the organ case, if it is hinged. If the top is not hinged, remove the back board, which is held on with cast iron catches or screws.\n\nPaper Label\n\nThe serial number is printed on a paper label glued to the upper surface of the chest. Figure 2 shows a typical Estey label with serial number 325469 printed in red in the space provided.\n\nNote that Estey serial numbers do not include a comma.\n\nThe label in Figure 2 traces the manufacturing of Estey Organ Serial Number 325469.\n\nThe organ was set up during Sept. 1901 by Estey employee # 49.\n\nThe reeds were tuned in the organ 10-15-1901.\n\nThe tuning was corrected 10-16-1901.\n\nThe tuning and organ were looked over 12-23-1901 by employee # 532.\n\nThis newly-completed chapel organ was ready to be delivered to a church in time for Christmas 1901.\n\nJ. Estey & Co. Cottage Organ labels may have the year faintly penciled in the upper right corner.\n\nLocating the Label\n\nPaper labels on Estey reed organs are typically located:\n\nOn the treble side of chest (Figure 3)\n\nOn the chest behind the tremolo (Figure 4)\n\nOn bass side of the chest (Figure 5)\n\nIf there is a sub bass box, the label may be located on top of it, as in Figures 6.\n\nLabels in chapel organs and two-manual with pedal instruments may be high up, such as on top of the sub bass or pedal box, or on the swell chest.\n\nNo Paper Label\n\nIf the paper label is missing, you may be able to find the serial number elsewhere on the instrument.\n\nOn the Warrantee\n\nThe serial number may be printed on the warrantee, which may be tacked to the inside of the case.\n\nOn the Top Rail\n\nThe serial number may also be stamped into the back top rail.\n\nFigure 7 shows serial number 128289 stamped into the back top rail of an Estey parlor organ.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: In Figure 7, the 3-digit and 4-digit numbers stamped into the top rail are not serial numbers. The serial number has 5 or 6 digits.\n\nHINT: If you see only 3- and 4-digit numbers stamped into the back of the top rail, the serial number may be stamped into the top edge of the top rail. It may be necessary to move the high top to see the top edge of the top rail.\n\nOn Other Parts\n\nThe serial number may be written in pencil or chalk on various case or action parts, as in Figures 8 and 9.\n\nHelpful Hints\n\nWhen searching for a serial number on an Estey reed organ:\n\nYou may need to shine a light from various angles to better see writing on labels or parts.\n\nIllegible labels may be cleaned with a dry, soft brush.\n\nBe careful: Paper labels are fragile. The ink and pencil marks come off easily.\n\nAn Historic Holding\n\nFigure 10 shows serial number 100000 stamped into the top edge of the back top rail of this Estey Salon Organ.\n\nThis historic organ, which marked an Estey milestone, was built in 1880 and is on exhibit at the Estey Organ Museum."
