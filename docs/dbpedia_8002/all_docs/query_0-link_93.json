I pluralize “cultures” because this book covers a historical span that begins in the late nineteenth– early twentieth centuries and continues to the present, thus encompassing an older, industrial form of capitalism and its transition to the neoliberal capitalism of the past few decades, with resulting shifts in cultural production, dissemination, and consumption. In many respects, this book serves as a companion to Music and Capitalism: A History of the Present (Taylor 2016a). That book provides a broad overview of music and neoliberal capitalism of the past few decades, especially in the US. This collection is probably less comprehensive of neoliberal capitalism, but offers more particulars—about individual musicians, works, issues such as culture, affect, and value—and includes discussions of the production, advertising, dissemination, and consumption of music in capitalist regimes that precede neoliberal capitalism, an industrial capitalism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the ﬁnance capitalism of the early twentieth century, and what became known as the “late capitalism” of the mid-twentieth century. This book begins with a consideration not of capitalism or globalization but of culture. For that, we still have no better guide than Clifford Geertz. I and many other graduate students were introduced to Geertz’s work by Judith 1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBecker at the University of Michigan, which, during the period I was there, was the beginning of the crisis of representation in anthropology and, to a lesser extent, ethnomusicology. Much of what was taken to be true, or at least correct, was being challenged by publications such as Marcus and Fischer (1986), Clifford and Marcus (1986), and other works. Culture was seen as a homogenizing concept (e.g., Abu-Lughod 1991), or an explanation for something that stood in for inquiry into social, cultural, and historical particularities. It seems to me, however, that Geertz’s ideas about culture and ethnography still have much to offer. I remember well as a graduate student in historical musicology feeling vaguely but increasingly disappointed that the cultural form that I took to be the most meaningful and powerful—music—was being studied in ways that had nothing to do with its meaning or power. We as graduate students were taught to be concerned with musical form, style, and other such things. “Meaning” came under consideration only if there were a text or plot or program. Geertz’s concern for meaning, however, was central to his thinking. His famous formulation of culture, that “man is an animal suspended in webs of signiﬁcance he himself has spun,” insists that the study of culture should not be the scientist’s search for law but the interpreter’s search for meaning (Geertz 1973, 5). This concern was, and remains, deeply attractive. Keeping it in mind helps the analyst remember to attempt to think from the perspective of her subjects, and helps move beyond descriptions of what people are doing to analyses of why they believe what they are doing to be meaningful. People are, as Geertz once wrote, “symbolizing, conceptualizing, meaning-seeking” creatures (Geertz 1973, 140). Symbolic practices such as music are attempts to “provide orientation for an organism which cannot live in a world it is unable to understand” (Geertz 1973, 141). Yet, the various reconsiderations of Geertz’s conception of culture have resulted in some important and useful updates and revisions, and I am in agreement with many of those who have offered them, most of all, unsurprisingly, Sherry B. Ortner (particularly Ortner 1999 and 2006). Ortner’s practice theory–inﬂected revision of the Geertzian culture concept both politicizes it and introduces the problematic of structure and agency, and is thus an immensely useful theoretical and analytical tool. The Geertzian- derived ideas about culture and meaning comprise one of the main intellectual forces driving all of my work, and I address some of these concepts directly in several essays in this collection. The\n\n2\n\nC U LT U R E , C A P I TA L I S M , G LO B A L I Z AT I O N , M U S I C\n\nﬁrst, chapter 1, “The Absence of Culture in the Study of Music,” revisits Geertz’s classic writings about culture as a web of signiﬁcation, a position that isn’t always adopted in some studies of music. Chapter 2, “Music and Affect in the West: The First 2,000 Years,” observes that the current interest in affect isn’t that different from Geertz’s concern for meaning, and shows how the understanding of affect in music studies has tended to be ahistorical, assuming that people react emotionally to music the same way and have done so throughout history and across cultures. But even in Western culture, there have been different ways of experiencing music affectively, from the ancient Greeks, who viewed music as a kind of medicinal or mechanical agent that its hearers were helpless to resist, to today’s agential listeners who employ music in complex practices of mood management. Another driving concern of my work is interest in that form of social organization known as capitalism which, today, has become so pervasive that it cannot really be separated from any human endeavor, including the production and consumption (and distribution and advertising and branding and marketing . . .) of music. This is ever truer today, as neoliberal capitalism produces and is produced by new regimes of globalization, ﬁnancialization, communications and other technologies, and other factors. On cultural production in the earlier, Fordist but post-industrializing capitalism and its transition to late capitalism, as well as this new capitalism’s relationship to cultural production, Theodor Adorno’s work continues to be inﬂuential, not least in the study of music. Yet, as important as Adorno remains in musicological circles, he is usually seen as simply that, a musicologist or critic, not as a student of the changing capitalism of the mid-twentieth century. Adorno was one of the best witnesses we have to the transition from an older to a newer form of capitalism, which he usually called “late capitalism,” and the resulting changes in cultural production (see, e.g., Adorno 1987; Horkheimer and Adorno 1990). His study of the culture industries and the changing nature of cultural production and consumption helped identify the transition from an older capitalism to one in which exchange value became paramount, and the true use value of cultural commodities (that they offer trenchant critiques of the society in which they were made) was disappearing, being replaced by false use values of enjoyment and status marking that were really nothing other than exchange values in disguise. Several of the essays in this collection analyze this transition from\n\n3\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nindustrial capitalism to a new form of capitalism that is more reliant on ﬁnancialization and new communications technologies. Chapter 3, “The Commodiﬁcation of Music at the Dawn of the Era of ‘Mechanical Music,’” considers the rise of sound reproduction technologies—in this case, the player piano—in the late nineteenth– early twentieth centuries and how audiences were convinced that purchasing music as a new kind of commodity, as sound, was better than making music themselves. Chapter 4, “The Role of Opera in the Rise of Radio in the US,” shows how a single individual’s love of opera helped develop broadcast technology in the ﬁrst few decades of the twentieth century. American inventor Lee de Forest’s desire to disseminate his favorite art form to the masses was a common position among social elites in the early twentieth century, when they experienced sometimes- conﬂicting tensions between desires to differentiate themselves from the masses by sacralizing the culture they consumed, while at the same time attempting to ensure that the masses that encounter high culture through new media such as radio did so properly. And chapter 5, “Stravinsky and Others,” revisits an old question that neither I nor anyone else has been able to answer very well in the past, namely, why is it that nineteenth- century composers, who had fairly easy access to non-Western musics in notation, rarely quoted them? But by the early twentieth century, such quotations had become quite common (in the works of Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, and many others). This chapter argues that the rise of ﬁnance capital, as theorized by Rudolf Hilferding in the early twentieth century, marked the ascendance of exchange value over use value. Composers, and everyone else, began to regard other musics, other sounds—other objects—as something that could be exchanged. This new relationship to other music continues most prominently but by no means exclusively through musique concrète in the 1940s and into the rise of digital sampling in the 1980s and after. While Adorno and others employed the term “late capitalism” immediately following World War II, the ﬁrst major theoretical attempt to chart late capitalism was Ernest Mandel’s often- cited (though, I suspect, little-read) book entitled Late Capitalism (Mandel 1978). This work was brought to the attention of many readers by Fredric Jameson in his enormously inﬂuential article “Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism” (ﬁrst published in 1984, reprinted in 1991), which focused attention on cultural production under late capitalism. Since then, however, most writings on today’s capitalism have coalesced around the term “neoliberal” capitalism, a particularly virulent form that emphasizes deregulation of markets, increased ﬁnancialization, 4\n\nC U LT U R E , C A P I TA L I S M , G LO B A L I Z AT I O N , M U S I C\n\nincreased commodiﬁcation, an ampliﬁed individualism, and much more (see especially Duménil and Lévy 2004; Harvey 2005; and Taylor 2016a). The chapters that are primarily concerned with the post–World War II era address neoliberal capitalism, examining this new ﬁnancialized, globalized, technologized capitalism from a variety of perspectives. Globalization is a major theme, as it has been in much of my work in the past couple of decades. Many of my arguments over the years have attempted to historicize our globalization, to show that the globe is not interconnected for the ﬁrst time in our era of globalization, but interconnected in new ways, though with old ideologies (about authenticity, as well as various forms of racism and xenophobia remaining remarkably resilient). This has profound ramiﬁcations for cultural production and consumption, as well as representations and appropriations of cultural forms from places far from Western metropoles. Several essays tackle these and related questions. Two chapters are concerned with the rise of “world music,” a category of music that emerged in the 1980s as non-Western popular musics increasingly found their way to Western metropoles. Western radio programmers, retailers, and reviewers weren’t sure how to classify these new sounds coming (mainly) from Africa and Latin America, and so they settled on the term “world music.” Since then, the Western music industry (broadly understood here as a conglomeration of industries including the recording industry, publishing, concert promotion, and more) has attempted to standardize and genericize world music in order to render it manageable, knowable, and emulatable by music industry workers. Chapter 6, “World Music Festivals as Spectacles of Genreﬁcation and Diversity,” argues that today’s world music festivals serve numerous functions, including reducing various aural expressions from around the world to this putatively knowable and manageable “genre” of world music. I argue that the “genre” of world music is not simply a category containing entities of similar style but an ongoing social practice of categorization and containment. It is necessary to commodify difference in a capitalist system, and this tends to intensify at historical moments when regimes of consumption are changing. All of these factors were already in play with the construction of the “world music” market in the 1980s. Festivals maintain and push this process further, for they contribute to the cultural work of putting world music in its (generic) place. Chapter 7, “Fields, Genres, Brands,” further addresses the music industry’s attempts to genericize world music, efforts that are ongoing. 5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWorld music is not (yet) a genre, though it is nonetheless possible to talk about it as a ﬁeld of cultural production: there are identiﬁable forms of capital, such as the types of authenticities musicians are expected to sound and exhibit; and there are identiﬁable positions available to be taken, most prominently, the position of whether or not to sing in English or another major European language, and the proximity of the musician’s sound to Western popular music. This chapter takes up the theoretical problem of genres and ﬁelds: What is the relationship between an industry-imposed genre and a ﬁeld? How do forms of capital congeal in ﬁelds? In today’s neoliberal capitalism, it is clear that the ﬁelds of power and economics are increasingly encroaching on all ﬁelds of cultural production, to the extent that some genres of music have become brands. The growing realization around the world of the importance of cultural expression, particularly of those cultures that are threatened by Westernization or urbanization or other modernizing forces, has resulted in some protectionist measures. Chapter 8, “Neoliberal Capitalism, UNESCO, and the Reenchantment of Culture,” concerns the growing global interconnectedness and continuing spread of capitalism in the postwar era, which accelerated rapidly with the rise of new communications technologies in the 1980s and after, and led among other things to increasing perceptions of the smallness of the world and the threats posed by modernization to local and indigenous cultural forms such as music. These perceptions eventually gave rise to UNESCO’s creation of the designation “Masterpiece of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity” early in this century; UNESCO now works with many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to preserve intangible cultural heritage. This chapter examines the history and deployment of the “Masterpiece” designation as the central node in a network of organizations dedicated to the preservation of intangible cultural heritage. In particular, I am concerned with how employment of the “Master piece” label has a kind of halo effect that can result in introducing those protected cultural forms to the market. Chapter 9, “Globalized Neoliberal Capitalism and the Commodiﬁcation of Taste,” interrogates the ubiquity of the term “globalization” as a way of viewing the present and recent past. The term appeared relatively recently, yet it has come to dominate considerations of the present, both in and out of academia, eliding some aspects of other perspectives. This chapter examines what is lost when globalization as an analytical framework becomes dominant. “Globalization” as a perspective and a related body of theory can help us understand how mu6\n\nC U LT U R E , C A P I TA L I S M , G LO B A L I Z AT I O N , M U S I C\n\nsics travel, for example, but is less useful in explaining what happens once world music has traveled and entered the Euro-American music industry in an era of neoliberal capitalism. With the explosion of music available on the Internet and the difﬁculty of ﬁnding what one wants, what emerges, among other things, is the importance of what people in the culture industries call “search”: the means of ﬁnding music or other cultural products. The importance of search has resulted in the increasing commodiﬁcation of taste, in both the form of music supervisors, who choose music for use in ﬁlms and television programs and who have become increasingly inﬂuential in the entertainment industry, and the rise of complex algorithms that help consumers ﬁ nd music to listen to based on their prior purchases or listening habits and those of others. Finally, chapter 10 completes the Geertzian arc by considering the questions of the value of cultural goods. This chapter departs from the common ideas that the labor that produces cultural goods is somehow special, or that cultural goods themselves are special sorts of goods, instead insisting that our focus should be not on making taxonomies of labor or types of goods, but rather on how they are valued. Drawing on anthropological theories of value, some of which I believe are related to Geertz’s focus on meaning, I argue that there are regimes of value in which cultural goods can ﬁnd themselves, an older regime that emphasizes the exchange value of cultural goods, and, today, a newly signiﬁcant regime in which the digital distribution of music has given rise to forms of value derived from users’ curation of music as represented in the creation and sharing of playlists through social media and popularity on YouTube. This newer form of value derives from what I am calling, drawing on David Graeber (2001), users’ meaningful action. For the most part, I have resisted the urge to engage in major editing in those items collected here that have been previously published, though there are some minor updates here and there. I have made one systematic change, however: some of the chapters in this book originally used the term “new capitalism” (drawing mainly on Sennett 1998 and 2006) rather than “neoliberal capitalism.” The earlier adoption of “new capitalism” (and before that, “late capitalism”) was a way to avoid what I viewed, and continue to view, as the over- economistic connotations and ahistorical usages of the term “neoliberal.” I am more interested in the interpretation of cultures than the crunching of numbers though, of course, this matters, too; I have no reason to throw out Marx’s conception of base and superstructure, as long as we understand that both are caught up in a complex and dynamic relationship, one of 7\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe many things we learned from Max Weber in The Protestant Ethic and elsewhere. But “neoliberal” seems to be the term that has gained the most traction, and if I want to participate in conversations about today’s capitalism, I need to employ this term. I hope that these essays, taken together, offer a useful and critical guide through the capitalisms of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries, and some forms of musical production and consumption therein.\n\n8\n\nONE\n\nThe Absence of Culture in the Study of Music Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\n\nKARL MARX, THE\n\nEIGHTEENTH B RUMAIRE OF LOUIS B ONAPARTE\n\nI begin with the famous statement by Karl Marx to make a point not about history but about culture. Few concepts are bandied about with the regularity of that term while at the same time being set aside. While plenty has been written about the overuse of the term “culture” or its limitations (see, e.g., Abu-Lughod 1991; Gupta and Ferguson 1992; and Troulliot 1991), I continue to ﬁnd it a useful concept. My concern here is the absence, or feeble presence, of it in many studies of music. In the American context, at least, this problem is exacerbated by centuries- old ideologies of individualism (see de Crèvecœur 1981 and de Tocqueville 2003), ideologies that are extremely difﬁcult to overcome. American individualism has fostered the understanding of the world as a congeries of cultures, but normally stops short of using the concept to understand ourselves, except as a means of differentiating ourselves from other (usually ethnicized or racialized) groups. In the American context at least, “culture” has usually come to refer not to the anthropological concept, but, simply, to difference: my culture is different from yours. “Culture” in this sense is thus a concept\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nthat merely replaces older ideas of race, ethnicity, or blood in American parlance. The elision of culture is perhaps nowhere clearer than in the reception and studies of music, in which individual creators are seen as just that: music is thought to emanate directly from someone’s head. Concepts of genius and talent are too often taken as axiomatic, not as ideologies with speciﬁc histories. Musicians lead complex lives (as does everyone), but are reduced to being isolated individuals who emit music, not people with various amounts of different forms of capital, people situated as subjects in different class, gender, generational, racialized, ethnicized (and still other) positions. This sort of focus is one of the challenges facing any ﬁeld that studies a particular aspect of a culture rather than “culture” (as in anthropology), “society” (as in sociology), or “history” (as in history). Focusing on a single practice, no matter how broad and variable, can lead to a view of its practitioners as nothing other than practitioners; culture can be rendered secondary, if it enters the analysis at all. There is thus a general tendency in many music studies to examine the people who make culture, not how they are made by culture; study of music as (anthropological) culture becomes just the study of music as (nonanthropological) culture. Ethnographies of musicians who are people in a culture too often become just biographies of those musicians. Biographies are useful in and of themselves, of course, but do not always shed light on the cultures that shape musicians and their music.\n\nCulture and Ethnography Revisited Let’s revisit the culture concept as promulgated by its most celebrated and inﬂuential proponent of the past half century, the American anthropologist Clifford Geertz. I am sure it is not necessary to rehearse Geertz on the culture concept, save to reiterate this famous formulation: culture is “a historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life” (Geertz 1973, 89). Clear enough, one would think: meaning is our focus, what is meaningful for social actors. The analysis of culture is the study of shared meanings. This sort of analysis was famously characterized by Geertz (drawing on philosopher Gilbert Ryle) as “thick description.” I would like to go 10\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nback, brieﬂy, to Geertz’s classic article, for it seems to me that it is too often taken as an advocation for copious description, as if that somehow is an end in itself. But for Geertz, thick description involves the search for what is meaningful for social actors, which makes the analysis of culture the sorting out of “the structures of signiﬁcation” (Geertz 1973, 9). “Ethnography,” he writes, “is thick description” (Geertz 1973, 9–10), and its proper object of analysis is “the informal logic of everyday life” (Geertz 1973, 17). Geertz then writes: If anthropological interpretation is constructing a reading of what happens, then to divorce it from what happens—from what, in this time or that place, speciﬁc people say, what they do, what is done to them, from the whole vast business of the world—is to divorce it from its applications and render it vacant. (Geertz 1973, 18)\n\nYet, there are plenty of examples of studies of music that serve up this very sort of vacancy. Geertz also admonishes that “anthropologists don’t study villages (tribes, towns, neighborhoods . . .); they study in villages” (Geertz 1973, 22; ellipsis and italics in original). That is, the object of analysis is not something concrete, tangible—the goal is the interpretation of the “ﬂow of social discourse” (Geertz 1973, 20). There are, unfortunately, many sorts of inquiries, including those employed by students of music, that avoid the sort of analysis advocated by Geertz. He lists what he calls “escapes,” approaches that have the result of “turning culture into folklore and collecting it, turning it to traits and counting it, turning it into institutions and classifying it, turning it into structures and toying with it.” But I would insist with Geertz that these are escapes (Geertz 1973, 29)—they are not enterprises in search of what is meaningful to particular social actors in particular places and times. And this is what our studies ought to privilege. While it may be recognized that Geertz’s focus was on meaning, signiﬁcation, it isn’t always as well understood by some just what this means for the study of culture. First, some critiques of the culture concept raise the problem of homogenization, reducing complex and messy social practices to, simply, “culture” (see Abu-Lughod 1991 and Ortner 2006). But, as Sherry B. Ortner points out, culture as the shared practices of a group was only one aspect of Geertz’s conceptualization; the other, as I have emphasized, was concerned with meaning (Ortner 2006). The centrality of meaning in Geertz’s thinking presupposes subjects for whom objects, relationships, practices, events, are meaningful. It is nonetheless true that he did not always focus on individual subjects or questions of agency (see Ortner 1996 and 2006), but that 11\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\ndoesn’t mean that his concept of culture no longer has anything to offer. It must also be remembered that ethnography is actually quite a radical methodology, and a much different one than the conducting of surveys or other sorts of sociological inquiry, or historical inquiry, or philosophical inquiry; the ﬁrst two are closer to what one could call scientiﬁc studies in which the main goal is to attempt to uncover objective social structures and practices (sociology) or the objective historical record as it shapes people’s thoughts and actions, characterizations I do not mean to be negative in any way, for these are all valuable endeavors; and philosophy, which attempts to address itself to transhistorical and transcultural sorts of questions (if indeed there can be any such things). But because ethnography is so comfortably the main methodology of ethnomusicology, I think that it is sometimes easy to forget just how radical it is, for it is less concerned with what is true or objective than with what people believe to be true and objective—what matters to them, and how this mattering, these beliefs, shape thought and practice—the ﬂow of social discourse. Thus, while one can often ﬁnd strong commonalities between historians’ conceptions of history and anthropologists’ and ethnomusicologists’ conceptions of culture, there can also be dramatic divergences, which can be no more or less enlightening. Actually, I would not even refer to ethnography as a method (that term is probably better reserved to describe ﬁeldwork)— it is a perspective, an interpretive framework that forces us to wonder about somebody else: What is meaningful to them? Why? What kind of lives do they lead? What kind of lives do they lead that makes this music (or whatever practice) meaningful to them? Culture Occluded Some music studies still suffer from their employment of the more scientiﬁc and less qualitative approaches by asking questions that are less ethnographic, less thickly descriptive, less about meaning for social actors, and more about imposing “scientiﬁc”—including quantitative— questions on what people do and why they do it. Or some get bogged down in the sorts of questions that could best be described as ontological—that is, What is authentic? What is this or that genre? What is an ethnic group? These latter sorts of questions can’t ever be answered; they can only be addressed ethnographically or historically: What is (or was) said and done in the name of authenticity? What is or was said\n\n12\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nand done in the name of this or that genre? What is or was said and done in the name of this or that ethnic group? Other approaches have also ended up pushing culture to the sidelines. The uncritical importation of theories from ﬁelds that do not possess a culture concept (or that don’t bother to historicize) is a perennial problem. Perhaps the best example is the widespread popularity of practice theory in some of the music ﬁelds, which has yielded much productive research. Some of the most inﬂuential practice theorists, however, are sociologists (Pierre Bourdieu and Anthony Giddens, most prominently), whose object of study is not culture but society. How useful is a practice theory of society if one is interested in culture? What, to be a little more speciﬁc, does one learn in Bourdieu’s classic Distinction (Bourdieu 1984) about French culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s (when Bourdieu’s survey data was collected)? Do we learn anything about real people, which one would in an ethnography (even if their names are changed)? It is thus necessary, I would argue, not only to be wary of “applications” of practice theory that render culture vacant, but to culturalize practice theory, as Sherry B. Ortner (Ortner 1996 and 2006) and William Sewell (Sewell 2005) have usefully attempted in some of their work. Another theory that has had the unfortunate and unintended effect of pushing culture to the side, at least in ethnomusicology, was Timothy Rice’s inﬂuential promotion of “subject- centered musical ethnography” (Rice 2003), which begins with rehearsing the various problematizations of the culture concept in anthropology and elsewhere. Rice also visits various theorizations of globalization, which foreground the movement of peoples around the world, to advocate our focus on individuals rather than culture (Rice 2003, 152). He then surveys some ideas about the nature of the individual, drawing from Giddens the idea of self-reﬂexivity (Giddens 1990) to justify greater ethnomusicological attention to the music-making self and the prevalence of selfnarration in the late modern world. Rice is careful in his attempts not simply to abandon the anthropological concept of culture, and does not say that moving the focus from culture to the individual will answer all questions. Nonetheless, the result has all too frequently been simply a revalorization of the musician as individual creator. What I am saying is that Rice’s turn away from culture to focus on individuals has had the unfortunate effect of taking us away from culture, in particular, the Geertizan concept of it that is concerned with what is meaningful for social actors. We should, of course, attend to\n\n13\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nindividuals—it would be difﬁcult not to. But we need always to keep in mind that the relationship between individuals and culture is extremely complex. Culture does not “determine” individuals’ thoughts and actions, and cultural forms are not simply products of individuals’ thoughts and actions. All coexist in complex dynamics, which, I believe, are best understood by employing a practice theory that has been politicized and culturalized. Ortner’s updated deﬁnition of culture productively imports practice theory thinking: culture consists of “(politically inﬂected) schemas through which people see and act upon the world and the (politically inﬂected) subjectivities through which people feel—emotionally, viscerally, sometimes violently—about themselves and the world” (Ortner 2006, 18). A weak or absent culture concept has also, I believe, led to seemingly endless formulations of “music and—” (e.g., music and identity, music and difference, and many more). Linkage between music and something else is a kind of lateral move, instead of a conceptualization that connects music to culture or history, identity (for example) to culture or history, and all three together. The problem of music and identity is particularly salient, for it exploded on the ethno/musicological scene a couple of decades ago, but, as Timothy Rice (2007) has shown, it was never interrogated or treated reﬂexively (Rice 2007). Identity was treated as natural, a given in the ethnomusicological literature he examined. Yet, identity as a self- conception—and self- construction—is not “natural,” or it is, of course, social, historical, and cultural. Any sort of cultural analysis of music needs to be conducted with the utmost reﬂexivity so as not to regress to pointless positivism, in which culture is rendered vacant. We must be vigilant. If we are not studying culture, why are we doing what we are doing? What is our music analysis for? Is it necessary to transcribe this or that musical performance? What questions about culture does music or performance analysis help us address? If we get bogged down in what we believe to be knowable through quantifying and scientizing, we may be rich in facts and ﬁgures but we will certainly be poor in our understanding of culture and what individual social actors say and do, and why they believe themselves to be saying and doing what they are saying and doing.\n\nForms Let’s turn to some more concrete examples of how culture shapes the production and understanding of forms in music. That culture plays 14\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nsuch a role should surprise no one. Yet, there are a number of ways that those who attempt to “read” culture out of forms do so that need to be examined but ultimately discarded. The ﬁrst is the idea of reﬂection, that music, or literature, or visual art or other forms, “reﬂect” the society or culture that produced them. This idea, as Raymond Williams points out, enjoyed a long history, stemming from Marxist demands that cultural forms must “reﬂect” society as it really is. But the idea of reﬂection found usages outside this framework as a general theory of how society shapes cultural production. Williams critiques the concept nicely: The most damaging consequence of any theory of art as reﬂection is that, through its persuasive physical metaphor (in which a reﬂection simply occurs, within the physical properties of light, when an object or movement is brought into relation with a reﬂective surface—the mirror and then the mind), it succeeds in suppressing the actual work on material—in a ﬁnal sense, the material social process—which is the making of any art work. By projecting and alienating this material process to “reﬂection,” the social and material character of artistic activity—of that art-work which is at once “material” and “imaginative”—was suppressed. (Williams 1977, 97; emphasis in original)\n\nRelated to the concept of reﬂection is that of “expression,” as in the idea that musicians and their music are “expressing” their culture. Like “reﬂection,” this formulation presupposes the idea that musicians and/ or music are somehow separate from their culture, so that they are in a position to “express” it. Yet, many studies of music remain studies of form and style as “expressions” of an individual, all divorced from the cultures, histories, and social worlds that produced them. Or, an individual’s emission of music is taken to be somehow representative or constitutive or reinforcing of her group, which is the sort of functionalist interpretation that Geertz also argued against. Last, there is the notion of homology. This is primarily associated with the Frankfurt School and is usefully summed up by Williams thus: “It extends from a sense of resemblance to one of analogy, in directly observable terms, but it includes also, and more inﬂuentially, a sense of corresponding forms or structures, which are necessarily the results of different kinds of analysis” (Williams 1977, 104– 5; emphases in original). The use of homology has become somewhat common in some analyses of music, in large part as a result of the inﬂuence of Theodor Adorno. In his hands or those of other skilled interpreters, this approach can sometimes yield convincing results. But, more often, 15\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nthere is a sense of a mechanical relationship that is being forced by the analyst and is frequently ignorant of history, society, and culture. But First, Culture Again I would argue that much of what passes for analysis in the various ﬁelds of music studies is actually a diversion from what ought to be the real business: the analysis of meanings produced in particular cultures in particular places in times. Anything else is an escape, as Geertz wrote. All of the escapes Geertz outlined above are predicated on a separation or division between “art” and “culture,” though to varying degrees. It is thus useful in this critique to revisit another of Geertz’s writings, “Art as a Cultural System,” to attempt to come to an understanding of art in/as culture. Geertz is rightly skeptical of those who believe that technical talk about art is all that is necessary for a complete understanding of it. Rather, one must realize that to study an art form is to explore a sensibility, that such a sensibility is essentially a collective formation, and that the foundations of such a formation are as wide as social existence and as deep, [which] leads away not only from the view that aesthetic power is a grandiloquence for the pleasures of craft.\n\nIt also leads away from the functionalist view of art of reinforcing or sustaining social cohesion (Geertz 1983, 99). The way to understand art is semiotically, by apprehending it as a system of meanings common to those who make it and to those in the same culture to whom it communicates: A theory of art is thus at the same time a theory of culture, not an autonomous enterprise. And if it is a semiotic theory of art it must trace the life of signs in society, not in an invented world of dualities, transformations, parallels, and equivalences. (Geertz 1983, 109)\n\nGiven Geertz’s concern for meaning, his demand for a semiotic study of art is put in service of a search of meanings that circulate in a culture, not a study of signs in and of themselves, which would only return us textual modes of analysis that still dominate some disciplines, including some of the music ﬁelds. Geertz writes: If we are to have a semiotics of art . . . we are going to have to engage in a kind of natural history of signs and symbols, an ethnography of the vehicles of meaning. 16\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nSuch signs and symbols, such vehicles of meaning, play a role in the life of a society or some part of a society, and it is that which in fact gives them their life. . . . This is not a plea for inductivism . . . but for turning the analytic powers of semiotic theory . . . away from an investigation of signs in abstraction toward an investigation of them in their natural habitat—the common world in which men look, name, listen, and make. (Geertz 1983, 118–19)\n\nBut this can be accomplished only if the analyst possesses a robust concept of culture (or of history). Recalling Geertz’s point that anthropologists study not villages but in villages, let’s also remember that they study the culture of a place or people or group or historical period, not simply its manifested forms. Put another way, the French sociologist Nathalie Heinich identiﬁes three generations of the sociological study of art, commencing with the study of art and society, then art in society, and ﬁnally, the study of art as society (Heinich 2004), which she appears to advocate. Most studies of music, however, whether Western European classical music or something else, have tended to be studies of what composers have done with forms, not the meanings that its makers and hearers and participants understood. Raymond Williams writes that advocates of formalist analyses put themselves in a position where it can be insisted that the formal composition, the formal structure, of narrative or drama reveals fundamental forms of social relationship, but at a level which can then be taken as determining, with the consequence that different forms of narrative or drama are seen only as variations of a fundamental form, and are explained as the result of internal, “systemic” developments, in a way that makes other kinds of social change, or even their own internal history, as history, irrelevant. (Williams 1981, 143; emphasis in original)\n\nThis is a point quite consistent with the reading of Geertz offered here. A Concerto in Late Eighteenth- Century Vienna Let me now offer some examples of what the possession of a more robust culture concept can offer the study of music. For no particular reason, both come from the late eighteenth century, though this was a period of incredible political and cultural foment as the feudal order was being eclipsed or overthrown, sometimes violently, making it easier to attempt to understand what meanings were in circulation and the stakes involved. 17\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nI’ll start with an examination of a piano concerto by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. One of the leading “music appreciation” textbooks discusses Mozart’s Concerto no. 17 in G Major, K. 453, third movement, from 1784 (example 1.1). I want to interrogate this analysis, for to read such textbooks ethnographically is a way of understanding them as distillations of what their authors believe to be important to impart to undergraduate non-majors; if these textbooks generally do not attempt to consider questions of signiﬁcation (except for works with texts), then it cannot be clearer how important formal considerations are in most studies of music. Mozart’s theme-and-variations movement is discussed in several music appreciation textbooks and of course in many scholarly publications, but most base their examination of the work on formalistic/stylistic terms, with formal diagrams and examples of musical notation. Mozart’s concerto movement is a theme and variations that is discussed almost entirely in formalistic terms by this textbook’s authors, employing “a” and “b” formal schematics and many examples of musical notation. This mode of description continues until the fourth variation, when the authors employ more a language of emotions: Variation 4 Woodwinds are replaced by strings, the mode changes to the minor, and the dynamic drops to a mysterious pp. This fascinating variation, with its syncopated melody and its almost ominous-sounding counterpoint, departs farthest from the actual theme, but the original dimensions and cadence structure are easily recognized. In the repeats (a4′ and b 4′), the piano works over this mysterious material more quickly and even more expressively. The variations have gradually been getting more and more profound; only a great composer could have written this fourth variation. But the deepening serious mood of the piece is about to be shattered. (Kerman and Tomlinson 2000, 200)1\n\nNote how this passage relies heavily on pointing out technical information: dynamic markings, formal structure, terms such as “cadence structure.” Just as noteworthy is the reliance on adjectives that don’t necessarily reveal anything about what might really be going on in the music in the ears of Mozart and his listeners in a proper natural history of signs and symbols: “ominous-sounding,” “mysterious,” “fascinating.” Then, in the last paragraph, there is the familiar appeal to the composer’s genius to explain the “mystery” of the passage. Continuing:\n\n18\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nVariation 5 Suddenly a rather comical, loud march variation of the theme is heard in the orchestra—its ﬁrst forceful statement since the opening of the movement. The solo cannot match anything as emphatic as this. So instead of a varied repeat, it takes an entirely new tack: It catches fresh interest by reintroducing the long-lost original version of the theme. The theme is certainly welcome back, after all the beautiful mystiﬁcations it has endured. Section b5′ is extended; there is a slowdown, with a place that Mozart marked for the soloist to improvise a short cadenza. (Kerman and Tomlinson 2000, 200)\n\n(Following this variation, the coda begins and ﬁnishes the work with an increase in tempo.) Scholarly treatments of this movement are much the same. The inﬂuential musicologist Christoph Wolff writes of strictly formal considerations, after observing that the opening of the melody was warbled by Mozart’s pet bird (a story related in most scholarly and pedagogical treatments of this movement). Then: Variation 4 combines soloistically treated winds with the piano. Variation 5 brings a mode switch (to G minor) and subjects the tune and its accompanimental material to intensive contrapuntal manipulation. Variation 6 reintroduces the orchestral tutti and presents it in juxtaposition with the solo piano. (Wolff 1994, 128)\n\nThe noted musicologist of the eighteenth century Wye J. Allanbrook writes of the last movement’s debt to operatic conventions of the time: The wholly new material, the quickened pulse, the layering of voices, entering one after another in parallel thirds, dialoguing with seemingly distant horns and winds, and rising in the joyous rush to a closure—all this recalls the effect of the approaching military band that closes Figaro. It is a translation of buffa ﬁnale practice into instrumental terms—and a happy termination for the “dramatic scena” that [eminent musicologist Leonard] Ratner termed the piano concerto. (Allanbrook 1999, 98–99)\n\nFinally, in this brief survey, the discussion by the respected pianist and musicologist Charles Rosen is scarcely less formalistic, though more detailed, observing usefully that “the last variation, half in military style and half a cadenza from the piano—a remarkable conception—leads to the opera buffa coda, within which the main theme of the variations only reappears impertinently after almost half the Presto is over” (Rosen 1972, 226).2\n\n19\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThe question I would ask of all such analyses, however, is not what Mozart is doing, but why? Rosen and the others provide a road map with an occasional historical bonbon but don’t tell us why the sights are worth seeing, why they were meaningful to Mozart’s audiences. Let me attempt to do this. Concluding movements in this era were designed to be fairly light, not taxing to the audience who has been forced to grapple with the complexities of the sonata-allegro form of the ﬁrst movement (about which more below), or the slow motion of the second movement. Formally, this movement is fairly unusual; Rosen observes that it is “heavily chromatic” (Rosen 1972, 226). This movement behaves in a way comprehensible to listeners in the ﬁrst few variations, but the fourth variation is in the minor mode, employs syncopations over the barline, and in general constitutes a marked departure from what has gone before. The ﬁfth variation is a triumphant march, followed by a coda that concludes the work with, unusually, an increase in tempo. What is going on? Since I don’t think it is possible to account for the peculiarities of a formal utterance solely by employing formal/stylistic modes of analyses, it is crucial to turn to culture and history, as it is always necessary to do. Scholarly works and textbooks I have seen that consider this work do not mention, or do not perceive the signiﬁcance of, the fact of the long history of animosity between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire, who were to be at war only a few years after this concerto was written, a war that was just another entry in the long history of animosity between these two empires. This history allows us to interpret this work in a broader way that forces our attention to historical and cultural realities. In that fourth variation, Mozart employs virtually every musical-semiotic code at his disposal to represent the specter of the duplicitous Turks, who appeared in a number of his works (see Taylor 2007): the minor mode, the syncopation that extends over the barline, the heavy chromaticism making for twisted, contorted, disjunct musical lines signifying these slippery, unpredictable, irrational Others. In his era, this highly conventionalized musical language evolved because of the Austrians’ and Turks’ long history, a language that audiences of the time would have recognized and understood. Once the presence of the Turks is raised, of course, it has to be quashed—enter the Habsburgs, represented by a march, as Rosen rightly notes. Mozart was more than a simple jingoistic partisan, however, and this is still a concerto, so, as Rosen says, Mozart combined the\n\n20\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nmarch with the soloist’s cadenza. But this is quite unusual. How are we to account for this variation? It seems to me there are two things to consider. First, from the Habsburg perspective, the Turks must be conquered. And in terms of late eighteenth- century conceptions of musical taste, the minor mode needs to be balanced by major. Also, convention gives the soloist a cadenza. But why in this variation? I think Mozart’s music communicates two things at once. One is about defeating the Turks; the other is no less rooted in the culture and history of the time, and this concerns the slow emergence of the autonomous individual, the modern bourgeois subject, out of the web of social relations that had deﬁned it under feudal, precapitalist times, as many scholars of the early modern period have discussed. The point is not simply that Mozart is working out this problem, but that he is working it out with the Habsburg army at hand, almost as if the army is protecting the new modern subject and Enlightenment values from the Ottomans, seen as premodern and undifferentiated—not Enlightenment subjects. So, the Habsburg collective reestablished, the new modern bourgeois subject protected, the Turks vanquished, the concerto concludes, in a section marked “Presto,” faster and more excitedly than ever: victory. The opera buffa music signals celebration by everyone, including the average commoner, who was the member of the class usually represented by opera buffa music, and whom Mozart seems to have been concerned with including in the beneﬁts of Enlightenment thought.3 The Emergence of a Form That was a discussion of a particular movement of a particular composition and how it semiotically registered and communicated meaningful sounds to its contemporary audiences. But sometimes it is the case that, historically, particular forms emerge that perform important cultural work. Such is the case with sonata-allegro form, an instrumental form that emerged in Europe in the late eighteenth century. This is a form that is generally employed as the ﬁrst movement of a multimovement instrumental work such as a concerto, symphony, string quartet, or sonata. It is easy enough to identify formal precursors to this form—mainly, the minuet and trio—but it is important, crucial, even, in cultural analyses of forms to go beyond histories of forms and ask questions about why particular forms emerged when and where they did. As Raymond Williams notes, “periods of major transition be-\n\n21\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\ntween social systems are commonly marked by the emergence of radically new forms, which eventually settle in and come to be shared” (Williams 1977, 189). I have been guided in the following analysis of sonata-allegro form by historian Thomas Laqueur (1990), in which he argues that it was in the late eighteenth century that the modern conception of gender as consisting of two sexes emerged. Prior to this moment, it was thought that there was a single gender, conceptualized as having a feminine pole and a masculine one with a hermaphroditic center. It is difﬁcult to imagine the kind of cultural confusion this shifting conception must have engendered, but we have countless records of how it was treated musically in, I would argue, sonata-allegro form. Struggles over the conception of gender were particularly potent in an era when the modern bourgeois subject was being formed—who was going to have access to this subjectivity, and who was not? Now, as I assume many of my generation and before were taught, in sonata-allegro form, the ﬁrst theme could be thought of as “masculine,” and the second, “feminine,” a perspective that, as it turns out, has a long history. The character of the themes goes back to the beginning of this form, and if not characterized in expressly feminist terms, is nonetheless clearly feminized. What transpires in sonata-allegro form is that the key of the second theme, independent but harmonically related the ﬁrst time it is heard, is eventually subordinated to the key of the ﬁrst theme. Georg Joseph Vogler, for example, writing in 1779, said, “in symphonies there are usually two main themes. First a strong one, which gives the material for thematic development. Second a gentle one, which mediates the heated din and keeps the ear pleasantly diverted” (quoted by Stevens 1983, 280). In 1796, Francesco Galeazzi wrote: The Characteristic Passage or Intermediate Passage is a new idea, which is introduced, for the sake of greater beauty, toward the middle of the ﬁrst part. This must be gentle, expressive, and tender in almost all kinds of compositions, and must be presented in the same key to which the modulation was made. (quoted by Stevens 1983, 301)\n\nAnd A. B. Marx, writing in 1845, said: In this pair of themes . . . the main theme is the ﬁrst one, therefore ﬁrst and foremost the decisive one in freshness and energy, therefore the one constructed more energetically, more vigorously, more completely—the dominant one and the de22\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\ncisive one. The subsidiary theme on the other hand . . . serves as contrast, constructed and determined by the preceding, thus by nature necessarily the gentler, cultivated more ﬂexibly than vigorously—the feminine, as it were, to that preceding masculine. In this sense each of the two themes is different and only with the other becomes something higher, more perfect. (quoted by Citron 1993, 135; ellipses in Citron)\n\nAnd ﬁnally, Hugo Riemann wrote in 1888 that “as a rule sonata form is laid out with a strong, characteristic, ﬁrst theme—the representative of the masculine principle, so to speak—and a contrasting, lyrical, gentle second theme, representing the feminine principle, usually in a different but related tonality” (quoted by Citron 1993, 135). While musicologist Marcia Citron (1993) considers sonata-allegro form as being gendered, she does not mention the profound cultural shift that was taking place at the time of the form’s emergence, the shift from a one-sex to a two-sex conception of gender. Sonata-allegro emerged, I am arguing, as a way of grappling with this new conception of gender; it is not simply “about” gender, it is a working and reworking, and reworking of reworkings, of this new conception of gender and male dominance, and how this dominance would work with women newly conceptualized as gendered opposites. Formalistic approaches ignore or fail to comprehend the importance of these sorts of arguments about culture and history, or they subordinate them. James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy, for example, consider the question of a “masculine” ﬁrst theme and a “feminine” second theme in sonata form in their exhaustive treatment of sonata form, tracing the rise of the gender metaphor to A. B. Marx, quoted above, a notion they say “spread like wildﬁre” (Hepokoski and Darcy 206, 145). They also note cases in which Marx seems to contradict himself, and offer examples that could not reasonably be characterized as “feminine,” warning, “today one should be cautious in bringing the masculine-feminine stereotype uncritically to works before 1825 or so” (Hepokoski and Darcy 2006, 146), thus clearly demonstrating that they fail to understand that sonata form in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was not simply a musical procedure that could be viewed as possessing themes that could be described employing language of metaphor or “stereotype,” but a musical working out of a profound epistemological shift in Western culture. Sonata-allegro was working out a new conception of gender before it was perceived or theorized as working on gender. Composers in the late eighteenth century seem to have had some 23\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nsense of what this powerful form could accomplish in terms of its representation and treatment of gender. The overture to Mozart’s Don Giovanni (1787), for example, reverses the normal order of themes to begin with the more lyrical, “feminine,” theme, which puts it in the position of dominating the second, more “masculine,” theme. But given the subject of the opera, depicting a serial sexual abuser of women who goes to hell at the end, this makes perfect sense (example 1.2). Or Franz Joseph Haydn’s Symphony no. 88 of the same year, in which the ﬁrst movement employs a ﬁrst theme that evokes the nobility to contemporary ears (horns in ﬁfths and thirds), but proceeds to a second theme that isn’t that different in character, as though the reconciliation of opposites here—generalized out from gender—isn’t meant as such, but as though to indicate that the “dominant”—in this case, the nobility’s—and “subordinate”—commoners’—positions aren’t so far apart. Haydn’s Enlightenment argument about equality is ampliﬁed in the third movement, the minuet and trio. This minuet, far from being an aristocratic dance, imitates folk music played by a bagpipe, with drones and ornaments. More than that, it uses asymmetrical phrases that are lengths of anything other than the standard eight measures—it would not be possible to dance the aristocratic dance to this minuet (example 1.4); it simply wouldn’t work. Haydn is saying, in so many ways, that the minuet now can belong to the peasantry. Additionally, the ﬁnal movement employs themes quite like Hungarian folk music (examples 1.5 and 1.6).4 The references to folk music aren’t being used here as local color or as simple rusticisms but serve to buttress the point about the equality, even nobility, of the peasant. (Lest a reference to Hungarian folk music by an Austrian composer sound far-fetched, it’s important to remember that Haydn was employed for many years by the Esterházy family at their remote estate in Hungary.) Sonata-allegro form was thus an important means of treating the reconciliation of opposites in this era, a means that emerged for speciﬁc historical reasons—the reconﬁguration of conceptions of gender. Other ﬁelds of cultural production produced their own modes of reconciliation, such as the “Hegelian dialectic” of thesis-antithesis-synthesis (though this formulation is more properly associated with the previous generation of philosophers, in particular Johann Gottlieb Fichte [1762– 1814]). Once a form concerned with the management of oppositions emerged, it could become generalized, as in the Haydn case, or aestheticized, with composers simply, or primarily, concerned with what they could do with the form as a form. Nonetheless, the form has origins in the Western European cultures in which it emerged, when it provided a 24\n\nT H E A B S E N C E O F C U LT U R E I N T H E S T U DY O F M U S I C\n\nway of working out changing conceptions of gender and selfhood more generally as it settled in and came to be shared.\n\nConclusions Despite the difﬁculties and critiques that the culture concept—Geertzian or not—has endured in recent decades, it remains a compelling and useful concept for the study of, well, everything. Its continuing utility outweighs whatever limitations it might be thought to possess, and those limitations are by now very well known, having been addressed by many. Yet, as I have discussed, it is all too common in some music studies to forget or omit or minimize culture. It has become too easy to believe that the music that moves us (whether or not we study that music) does so because of something in the music. But that something is in us, not in a psychological sense, but in the sense that everyone is a member of one culture or another (and many overlapping “little cultures,” to employ a term from Grant McCracken that I still like [McCracken 1997]). Meaning resides not in musical texts or sounds but in us, as members of cultures who share vocabularies of public signs and symbols. To study anything else is an escape.\n\n25\n\nTWO\n\nMusic and Affect in the West: The First 2,000 Years There has been something of an explosion of interest in affect in the past couple of decades, reaching across humanistic ﬁelds, the softer and harder social sciences, and into the hard sciences, particularly neuroscience (see Leys 2011).1 I am not aware of a taxonomy of these various affects, but they certainly include studies of trauma (e.g., Bennett 2005 and Thompson 2009), animals (Panksepp 2004), theories derived from Spinoza by Deleuze and Guattari (1987), and, following them, by Brian Massumi (2002), geography (e.g., Thrift 2008 on nonrepresentational theory), psychology, neuroscience, and still others, even music (e.g., Thompson and Biddle 2013). The most scientistic of these are the furthest removed from considerations of culture and history, yet some seem to enjoy great inﬂuence, seeming to produce a new publication about “music and your brain” almost every day. And other considerations of affect can also occlude culture and history, considerations from the perspectives of philosophy, psychology, and other ﬁelds, which frequently offer universalizing treatments of affect. The title perhaps obscures the simple goal of this chapter: to demonstrate that what most of us today take for granted is actually a historical, cultural, and social development. That music and affect—an emotional response or connection to music—have something to do with each other would seem to be obvious. But in many cultures this connection exists in complex ways that might 26\n\nMUSIC AND AFFECT IN THE WEST\n\ndiffer markedly from contemporary assumptions (see, for some examples, Feld 2012 and Seeger 2004). Even if one conﬁnes one’s gaze to the West, it is clear that music was used to relieve the tedium of work, to praise god, to embolden warriors, to dance to, to pass the time, for sociality, and much more. The perception that music and affect go together is just one of the many ways that music can be culturally constructed as functional. Music served, and continues to serve, purposes other than the role it plays in mood management for many people in the West today; just because music’s connection to people’s emotions seems to be powerful and obvious doesn’t mean that it is also natural. This is an assumption that needs to be both historicized and deconstructed, and that is the work of this chapter. I will offer this historicization and deconstruction in capsule form, partly because I need to arrive at the main point of the chapter—that the micromanagement of mood through music that most take for granted, and which is largely responsible for the perceptions that music and mood are naturally connected, is a fairly recent development and is far from natural—but also because a history that culturalizes the relationship between music and the emotions doesn’t exist.2 But I want to begin ﬁrst by reiterating the orientation of this part of this book toward the idea of culture, and in particular toward (updated) Geertzian conceptions of it. Affect, it seems to me, is another way of dealing with meaning, and the current interest shown to affect in the humanities and softer social sciences is, I believe, another way that Geertz’s concern for meaning is being realized, if not always following his many fruitful cues. An intervention such as this seems to be particularly urgent now, when conceptions of affect that are rooted in the social, cultural, and historical are under ﬁre from at least two directions: from neuroscience, which would have us believe that “we” (whoever “we” are) respond to “music” (whatever that is—some cultures don’t have a word for it) in the same affective ways because “our” brains are wired that way (Levitin 2006; Sacks 2007; Storr 1992); and from some corners of the humanities that ignore culture, history, and the social in order to theorize affect drawing on neuroscience or psychology (such as Sedgwick 2003 and Smail 2008). One could argue that even for cultures in which music and affect are not thought to be related, something affective is happening, in our psyches, in our brains. I suppose this is true, just as if we put something in our mouths, we taste it. But taste, like music and its effects, is culturally shaped, and is different from culture to culture and his27\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ntorically within one culture, otherwise there wouldn’t be more cuisines than there are cultures on the planet. A language one doesn’t understand doesn’t convey meaning, or at least, not those meanings understood by speakers of it. Someone who has never heard, say, Japanese Noh music isn’t going to make sense of it the way a Japanese person would. All of this ought to be almost comically self- evident in today’s era of discourses of multiculturalism, diversity, and the widespread acknowledgment of cultural relativism, yet there are many who nonetheless seem to believe that music affects “our” brains in the same way, regardless of gender, generation, culture, personal tastes, and much more. The relativization of knowledge seems to have led in part to its compartmentalization. Cultural beliefs and practices matter and can be neither set aside nor ignored, yet this is precisely what happens in much of the literature about music and affect, in which historical writings on music and emotion are taken at face value, assuming that ancient Greek or medieval ideas about music and emotion somehow “prove” that there is a natural connection between the two that has existed for millennia and that the connection is the same now as it was then. Even if there has been a connection over long stretches of time, this does not mean that it has always been understood and conceptualized in the same way in every historical period. Ideas about music and emotion are a sort of backwards history in which the “historian” takes current ideology as axiomatic and then ﬁnds only those texts that support that position. But this is extremely selective, leaving out all the counterhistories, dissensions, and so forth. This is one of the great lessons from Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann’s classic The Social Construction of Reality (1967): reality presents itself to us as something that has a long history, but a particular historical trajectory could have begun just before we entered the scene, and we would only believe it to be an older, established, one. The next section thus offers a brief history of music and affect in the West, intended to show just how these understandings and conceptualizations of our reality have changed over time. Finally in this introductory section, a note on terminology. “Affect,” “emotion,” “feeling,” “mood,” are frequently conﬂated or used interchangeably, so let me sort out here how I will use the terms. Each enjoys technical usages in various specialized literatures, and so I am here following the lead of philosopher Jeanette Bicknell, who parses the terms thus: emotions, she writes, are fundamental, results of evolu-\n\n28\n\nMUSIC AND AFFECT IN THE WEST\n\ntion; feelings or affects “are the subjective experiential aspect of mental states,” that is, “how an emotional state feels to the person experiencing it” (Bicknell 2009, x); and moods are unlike emotions in that they “do not have precise objects,” and are less intense. Nonetheless, my primary concern in this chapter is to historicize the various ways that music and emotions—and affects, feelings, and moods—have been thought to be related in Western culture, and I will not always make much of these distinctions.\n\nA Brief History of Music and Affect in the West In the most general terms, the history of thinking about music and affect can be characterized in three very broad historical stages; all of these ideologies of music and affect are rooted in history, but the older ideologies still persist. The earliest conception of music and affect in the West was a strictly mechanical one, in which music was thought to inﬂuence its defenseless listeners; the next model was one of a common language of representation, with composers employing culturally recognized signs of emotions; and the most recent conception, which arose with the idea of the modern agential subject, remains the dominant model, in which listeners simply assume a connection between music and emotion, and, since the advent of recorded audio and in particular portable playback devices, routinely manage their moods through their choice of music. Music and Affect in Early Western History In general, there were two main ideas about how music worked in the ancient world: the ﬁrst was a Pythagorean idea that the planets and music vibrated at the same frequencies, which was a tenet of the philosophy of the “harmony of the spheres.” Pythagoras and others also thought that particular musical modes were capable of inﬂuencing listeners’ moods in particular ways (Garrido and Davidson 2013, 95). This was a kind of simple cause-and- effect, even mechanical, notion of how music was thought to work; people were thought to be helpless to resist its effects. This notion of music and affect does not presume an agential subject, a knowing self through which music must pass before it exercises its effects. Music in this thinking was a kind of drug, which entered into a subject’s ears with predictable effects (this is\n\n29\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\ngenerally known today as the “pharmaceutical model,” after Sloboda 2005). The other main idea, a somewhat similar model known as the “ethos” doctrine, was subscribed to by Plato, who wrote in the Timaeus, likening harmony in music to the movement in people’s souls, that harmony, which has motions akin to the revolutions of our souls, is not regarded by the intelligent votary of the Muses as given by them with a view to irrational pleasure, which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our day, but as meant to correct any discord which may have arisen in the courses of the soul, and to be our ally in bringing her to harmony and agreement with herself, and rhythm too was given by them for the same reason, on account of the irregular and graceless ways which prevail among mankind generally, and to help us against them. (Hamilton and Cairns 1961, 1175)\n\nBecause music was thought to have these kinds of direct effects, Plato famously warned against the use of certain modes in The Republic, and admonished more generally: The overseers must be watchful against its insensible corruption. They must throughout be watchful against innovations in music and gymnastics counter to the established order, and to the best of their power guard against them, fearing when anyone says that that song is most regarded among men “which hovers newest on the singer’s lips” [Odyssey i.351], lest it be supposed that the poet means not new songs but a new way of song and is commending this. But we must not praise that sort of thing nor conceive it to be the poet’s meaning. For a change to a new type of music is something to beware of as a hazard of all our fortunes. For the modes of music are never disturbed without unsettling of the most fundamental political and social conventions. (Hamilton and Cairns 1961, 665– 66)\n\nAristotle’s thinking was much the same, writing in The Politics that [W]e must make use of all the harmonies, we are not to use them all in the same manner, but for education use those which improve the character, for listening to others performing use both the activating and the emotion-striving or enthusiastic. Any feeling which comes strongly to some, exists in all others to a greater or lesser degree: pity and fear, for example, but also this “enthusiasm.” This is a kind of excitement which affects some people very strongly. It may arise out of religious music, and it is noticeable that when they have been listening to melodies that have\n\n30\n\nMUSIC AND AFFECT IN THE WEST\n\nan orgiastic effect they are, as it were, set on their feet, as if they had undergone a curative and purifying treatment. And those who feel pity or fear or other emotions must be affected in just the same way to the extent that the emotion comes upon each. To them all comes a pleasant feeling of purgation and relief. In the same way cathartic music brings men an elation which is not at all harmful. (Weiss and Taruskin 2008, 10)\n\nThis position carried over into the Middle Ages and beyond, with many authors returning to the ancient Greeks for insights into the workings of music. Sandra Garrido and Jane Davidson write of a medical theory called “Doctrine of the Humors” circulating around the time of Hippocrates (c. 400 BC). The balance or imbalance of four bodily ﬂuids of humors determined mental health, and music could affect this balance; Galen or Galenus held a similar theory (Garrido and Davidson 2013). This theory also lasted for centuries. Aristotle’s and other ancient Greek beliefs about music were promulgated by Boethius (c. 480– 524 or 525), among others, who wrote, for example, in Fundamentals of Music that A lascivious mind takes pleasure in the more lascivious modes, and is often softened and corrupted by listening to them. Contrariwise, a sterner mind ﬁnds joy in the more stirring modes and is braced by them. This is why the musical modes are named after certain peoples, such as the Lydian and Phrygian; the mode takes the name of the nation that delights in it. For a people takes pleasure in modes resembling its own character, nor can it be that the soft should be joined to and delight the hard, or the hard delight the soft, but, as I have said, it is congruity which causes love and delight. . . . Discipline has no more open pathway to the mind than through the ear; when rhythms and modes gain access to the mind by this path, it is evident that they affect it and cause it to conform to their nature. One observes this among the nations. Ruder peoples delight in the harsher modes of the Thracians, civilized peoples in more restrained modes. (Treitler 1998, 138–39)\n\nCassiodorus, another important medical writer on music and affect, wrote in a letter to Boethius of how music can change the heart: Harmful melancholy he turns to pleasure; he weakens swelling rage; he makes bloodthirsty cruelty kindly, arouses sleepily sloth from its torpor, restores to the seedless their wholesome rest, recalls lust- corrupted chastity to its moral resolve,\n\n31\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nand heals boredom of spirit which is always the enemy of good thoughts. (quoted by Garrido and Davidson 2013, 98)\n\nWritings throughout the Middle Ages considered the healing properties of music, building on and moving away from Greek notions of music to advocate music as a kind of prescription for what ailed patients. In the early Christian church, the perceived power of music was frequently justiﬁed to bring congregants’ attention to God, as St. Basil (329 or 330–379) wrote in the fourth century in his Homily on the First Psalm, employing metaphorically the “pharmaceutical model”: For when the Holy Spirit saw that mankind was ill-inclined toward virtue and that we were heedless of the righteous life because of our inclination to pleasure, what did he do? He blended the delight of melody with doctrine in order that through the pleasantness and softness of the sound we might unawares receive what was useful in the words, according to the practice of wise physicians, who, when they give the more bitter draughts to the sick, often smear the rim of the cup with honey. For this purpose these harmonious melodies of the Psalms have been designed for us, that those who are of boyish age or wholly youthful in their character, while in appearance they sing, may in reality be educating their souls. For hardly a single one of the many, and even of the indolent, has gone away retaining in his memory any precept of the apostles or of the prophets, but the oracles of the Psalms they both sing at home and disseminate in the marketplace. And if somewhere one who rages like a wild beast from excessive anger falls under the spell of the psalm, he straightaway departs, with the ﬁerceness of his soul calmed by the melody. (Treitler 1998, 121–22)3\n\nThis idea of music as having the power to affect people directly in ways that they were helpless to resist continued for centuries. Aegidius of Zamora, in Ars Musica, published in the thirteenth century, wrote: Music stirs feeling, stimulates the senses, and animates warriors; indeed the more ﬁerce the sound, the braver the soul in battle. Music gladdens the sorrowful, and it strikes fear in the guilty when the trumpet of the enemy sounds in their ears. Music lightens the labors of shepherds and of others, and braces those who languish; it calms agitated souls, banishes care and anxiety, and restrains and curbs violence. . . . [I]t casts out evil spirits from the body, banishing them by a certain miraculous and hidden divine power. (Treitler 1998, 248)\n\nAll of these theories, whether astronomical or medical, are predicated on the notion that music, not individuals, possesses power, and that individuals are helpless when exposed to it. 32\n\nMUSIC AND AFFECT IN THE WEST\n\nMusic and Affect in the Early Modern Era The rise of tonality as the dominant musical language of Western composers for several centuries constitutes an important development in the early modern period. Tonality grew out of existing musical systems and procedures (about which there is ample discussion in the musicological and music theoretical literatures; see for example Besseler 1974; Crocker 1962; Dahlhaus 1990; Judd 1998; Lowinsky 1961; Meier 1988; Randel 1971; and Rivera 1979), but it arose for particular cultural and historical reasons—it was, as I have written elsewhere, a particularly potent system for establishing centers and margins—managing modern subjects and their others—and as such should be seen in part as registering European colonial attitudes and ideologies (Taylor 2007). Western Europeans needed to reorient themselves—to remap themselves, literally and ﬁguratively—in a cosmos in which there was a New World. This new musical system still needed to be invested with meaning as a system of signs, however: it began as a system of signs, but what did they signify? How did this new musical system come to be seen as one that could convey meaning, represent affect, in the way that it did, and still does? Tonality remains the dominant musical language in the West and, now, beyond, as the popular music of the West travels. Its affective effects have become so naturalized that to imagine otherwise has become extremely difﬁcult. There is virtually no literature that discusses just how tonal music became the complex and subtle affective communication system that it did. Conferring meaning on any new communication system is a massive task, and usually fails; people tend to apprehend new systems of signiﬁcation through the vantage point of the one they are most familiar with. Artists who attempt to devise a new language for themselves have found few followers historically. The only way that modes and many other maneuvers employed in tonal music can be thought to have a link to something affective is through practice—practice with texts or drama or dance that imparted meanings to sounds through association before tonality was a system of signiﬁers in its own right. In the history of Western European music, the maturation of tonality was accompanied by serious and contentious debates about the role of music in the support of texts (instrumental music being a minor part of what composers did in this era). These debates coalesced around two positions in the early seventeenth century, the prima prattica [ﬁrst practice] and the seconda prattica [second practice]. In the former, the text 33\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nwas seen as subservient to the music; in the latter, the opposite. Claudio Monteverdi (c. 1547–1643) characterized the seconda prattica thus: “‘Second practice’ . . . is that style which is chieﬂy concerned with the perfection of the setting, that is, in which harmony does not rule but it is ruled, and where the words are mistress of the harmony” (Weiss and Taruskin 2008, 146). Giulio Cesare Monteverdi, in a writing on his brother’s compositional technique from 1607, uses the same metaphor of harmony serving as a mistress to the words, and quotes Plato in support of his argument: “For only melody, turning the mind away from all things whatsoever that distract, reduces the mind to itself” (Treitler 1998, 542). Monteverdi frère takes this to mean, this time invoking Italian music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino’s Istituzioni armoniche—“If we take harmony absolute, without adding to it anything else, it will have no power to produce any extrinsic effect,” and, “in a certain way, it intrinsically prepares for and disposes to joy or sadness, but it does not on this account lead to the expression of any extrinsic effect” (Treitler 1998, 542)—to argue for the importance of words over harmony. Musicologists usually take this debate to be about what is more important, the music or the words, a hoary musicological problem. But it was about much more than that. I would argue that the rise of the seconda prattica was a concerted effort by composers to make this new musical system into a signifying system, and their solution was to imbue it with the denotative power of language. Subordinating music to language was not, in fact, lessening or deprioritizing music, but investing it with the power to represent and evoke affects that were drawn from words in song texts and opera and ballet plots. With the establishment of tonality as the dominant musical language in the early seventeenth century and the investment of it with a system of affective signiﬁcations derived mainly from language, the next development in Western European culture was to begin to codify and classify these means of representation, an activity that was part of a larger project in Western European culture in this period of classiﬁcation and organization, as discussed by Michel Foucault, two activities that were central to the Classical episteme as he saw it (Foucault 1970). Affects were classiﬁed in philosophical and medical treatises, and musical means of representing those affects were haggled over by composers. Jean-Philippe Rameau, writing in his Treatise on Harmony (1722), said that “harmony may unquestionably excite different passions in us depending on the chords that are used. There are chords which are sad, languishing, tender, pleasant, gay, and surprising. There are also certain progressions of chords which express the same passions” (Treit34\n\nMUSIC AND AFFECT IN THE WEST\n\nler 1998, 694). There is nothing intrinsic in these chords that conveys these affects; Rameau is writing about a musical signifying system that had already been naturalized through decades of use. If affective meanings were initially assigned to tonal harmony, as I am arguing, they found their way to other aspects of tonal musical organization. Composer and music theorist Johann Mattheson wrote in The Complete Music Director (1739): So since the true goal of all melody can only be a type of diversion of the hearing through which the passions of the soul are stirred, no one will accomplish this goal who is not intent upon it, who is not himself moved, and who scarcely thinks of a passion at all, unless it were of the sort that emerges involuntarily. But if he is moved in a nobler manner and also desires to move others with harmony, then he must know how to express sincerely all of the emotions of the heart merely through the selected sounds themselves and their skillful combination, without words, in a way that the auditor might fully grasp and clearly comprehend the impetus, the sense, the meaning, and the expression, as well as all the pertaining divisions and caesuras, if it were an actual narration. Then what a joy it is! Much more art and a more powerful imagination is required if one wants to achieve this without, rather than with, words.4\n\nMattheson continues by referring to a number of instrumental genres: Now one would scarcely believe that the affections would have to be as greatly differentiated even in little, disesteemed dance melodies, as light and shadow can be. I give only one illustration of this, e.g., the affect is a good bit more sublime and stately in a chaconne than in a passacaglia. The affection of a courante is directed toward a tender longing. I am not speaking of an Italian violin corrente. A dogged seriousness is the only thing encountered in a sarabande. The purpose is pomp and conceit in an entrée, and pleasant joking in a rigadoun. The aim is contentment and pleasantness in a bourée, liveliness in a rondeau, vacillation and instability in a passepied, ardor and passion in a gigue, exulting or unrestrained joy in a gavotte, temperate diversion in a minuet, etc. (in Treitler 1998, 698; emphasis in original)\n\nThe aesthetic position of representing an emotion in music or another art was generally known as the Doctrine of the Affections, which held that music was a language of emotion that composers could wield to communicate emotions to listeners through performers. This was thought of as an abstract, signifying language, a system of musical codes that needed to be learned by musicians and listeners alike. The composers’ own emotions were not represented, nor were the performers’, though they were recognized as representations of real emotions. 35\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nThis mode of the representation of affect required no subjective participation by anyone (Rowell 1983, 112). These and other ideas about music and affect in this period led to a number of writings about how these representations work and could best be conceptualized, as imitation, “excitement,” or some other modality. Rousseau’s Dictionary of Music (1767), under “Imitation,” captures this idea of representation. He ﬁrst compares music to painting, as many did in this era, but then goes on to enumerate the special properties of music; silence can give the effect of noise, and vice versa: But music acts more intimately upon us in exciting, by one sense, affections similar to those which may be excited by another; and, as the connection cannot be sensible unless the impression is strong, so painting, stript of that force, cannot render to music the imitations which that draws from it. . . .\n\nRousseau then writes of representational powers of the musician, concluding that “he will not represent these things directly; but he will excite in the soul the same movements which we feel in seeing them” (Weiss and Taruskin 2008, 241). Elsewhere, in his Essay on the Origin of Languages, Which Treats of Melody and Musical Imitation (c. 1760), Rousseau wrote: As much as one might want to consider sounds only in terms of the shock that they excite in our nerves, this would not touch the true principle of music, nor its power over men’s hearts. The sounds of a melody do not affect us merely as sounds, but as signs of our affections, of our feelings. It is thus that they excite in us the emotions which they express, whose image we recognize in them. (Treitler 1998, 950)\n\nAuthor and philosopher Johann Jakob Engel’s On Painting in Music (1780) also views music and effects as separate, writing that he does not believe that music can “imitate” (i.e., depict) something real, an “external object”; rather, the composer imitates “the impression that this object tends to make on the soul” (Treitler 1998, 956). And, “all representations of the passions in the soul are inseparably bound up with certain corresponding movements in the nervous system, and are maintained and strengthened by the perceptions of these movements” (Treitler 1998, 958), something of the medicalized view adapted from the ancient Greeks. Engel thought that music paints or imitates the inner feelings of the soul by choosing “tones that have a certain effect on the nerves, which is similar to the impression of a given feeling” (Treitler 1998, 958). 36\n\nMUSIC AND AFFECT IN THE WEST\n\nThe job of composers in this era was to match affect to music, and to do so, they had to be aware of the quality of affect. Composer and theorist Johann Philipp Kirnberger wrote in The Art of Strict Musical Composition (1776): Each passion has its own degrees of strength and, if I may say so, its own deeper or shallower character. Joy, for example, can be solemn and almost exalted; it can be overwhelming, but also leaping and frolicsome. Joy can have these and even more levels and nuances, and such is the case with the other passions as well. Above all, the composer must have a deﬁnite impression of the particular passion that he has to portray and then choose a more ponderous or lighter meter depending upon whether the affect in its particular nuance requires one or the other. (Treitler 1998, 777)\n\nThe job of performers was to communicate affect as represented by the composer. Daniel Gottlob Türk wrote in School of Clavier Playing (1789) that “whoever performs a composition so that its intrinsic affect (character, etc.), even in every single passage, is most faithfully expressed (made perceptible) and that the tones become, so to speak, a language of feelings, of this person it is said that he is a good executant” (Treitler 1998, 876). These writings are all concerned with the proper representation, however conceptualized, of an affective state. Affect as Personal Experience With the rise of the modern agential subject, a new phase in Western modernity in the very late eighteenth/early nineteenth centuries emerged; Foucault calls the period beginning 1790–1810 the “modern age” (Foucault 1989, 30). Composers as modern bourgeois subjects began to believe themselves to be able to represent their own emotions in music, and sought to devise new technical ways of accomplishing this. In the very late eighteenth century, these ideas began to be registered in writings about music. Heinrich Christoph Koch, in his Introductory Essay on Composition (1782–93), speaking metaphorically on the soloist in a concerto expressing his feelings and conversing with the rest of the orchestra, wrote: The expression of feeling by the solo player is like a monologue in passionate tones, in which the solo player is, as it were, communing with himself; nothing external has the slightest inﬂuence on the expression of his feeling. . . . There is a passionate dialogue between the concerto player and the accompanying orchestra. He 37\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nexpresses his feelings to the orchestra, and through short interspersed phrases it signals to him sometimes approval, sometimes acceptance of his expression, as it were. (Treitler 1998, 816)\n\nThe soloist here is conceptualized as a modern bourgeois subject, an agent in charge of his own feelings (see McClary 1987). It is possible to locate some introspective moments in Mozart’s music, particularly some slow movements, that are attempts to represent his own emotions, but it wasn’t until a later generation of composers that this became possible, even routine. Theodor Adorno once wrote of Beethoven’s “revolutionary achievement—the discovery of subjectivity as a constitutive category within the structure of music itself” (Adorno 1994, 359); Adorno later refers to Beethoven’s introduction of “subjective expression as a basic element of music” (Adorno 1994, 362). In other words, Adorno credits Beethoven with devising ways of composing music that could represent his own subjectivity. None of this is to say that composers were always expressing their own emotional states in their works, but they were drawing on them, whether or not their representations were supposed to be of their own emotions. Beethoven’s “discovery” became of course the basis of Romanticism in music, represented in works from Robert Schumann to Hector Berlioz to Frédéric Chopin to Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner, into the twentieth century and beyond. There is no need to investigate questions of music and affect in the rest of the nineteenth century and after, for this is the ideology of affect that is still current, and perhaps best articulated by Robert Schumann, who once wrote, “I am affected by everything that goes on in the world—politics, literature, people—I think it over in my own way, and then I long to express my feelings in music” (Schonberg 1997, 179). Simply put, the Romantic conception of affect is that composers draw on their own affective experiences to represent affects in works, which communicat"
