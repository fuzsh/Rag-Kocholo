        "text": "PIANOS MANUFACTURED IN THE VICTORIAN ERA TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION 1889 TO 1929\n\nBrief descriptions of the prominent American piano manufacturers whose instruments are described in alphabetical order manufactured between December 1889 until January 1930. This is a Directory of the piano industry at that time and is designed to supplement the analytical matter pertaining to the instruments. To some degree the information is for historical purposes and is for pianos manufactured by each of the listed companies at the time of manufacture.\n\nAll statements regarding the material's and/or the techniques of manufacture are representative of that time when few blueprints existed and pianos were made one at time and in many cases with hand tools. While the merits of musical instruments manufactured nearly a century ago are now not necessarily affected by the commercial standing or historical record of their makers. Consequently, prospective piano buyers usually desire to know something concerning these points. Agents and salesmen often make these items strong points in their arguments for or against the manufacture of these instruments. As frequently repeated in these pages the only way by which to arrive at an approximate valuation of an unknown piano; one bearing a name that is not the trademark of a recognized industry is to ascertain the instrument's origin and condition. This also suggests the need of some knowledge of the makers of the various instruments. This list is not designed to catalogue all the American manufacturers, but it embraces most of the pianos that have played a considerable part in history for estimates of the qualities of the instruments themselves.\n\nThe names of pianos are arranged alphabetically in this book to ascertain the character and reliability of any instrument. In this day of advertising and enterprise the names of most great pianos are familiar to the public. But there are a few of the older instruments whose originators succeeded in making their genius known. But on leaving the scene, their successors, permitted the priceless fame of those pianos to decline. Such pianos are of course given their deserved place in this book and, even if the name may seem strange, the commendation herein accorded may be accepted as reliable.\n\nMany of the firms mentioned here managed to survive the 1920's but succumbed during the depression years. Others were swallowed up in the two big combines, the Aeolian Company and the American Piano Company, that came into being shortly after World War I.\n\nACKERMAN & LOWE\n\nPianos and player pianos bearing this name were made in Marion Ohio from 1907 to 1927, after that date they were made by Jesse French and Kasselman at Newcastle, Indiana. These pianos were reliable but would require the instrument be in exceptional condition or have great sentimental value in order to warrant rebuilding.\n\nACOUSTIGRANDE\n\nPianos of admirable character were built by Chickering Brothers of Chicago Illinois. Company was not affiliated with the CHICKERING & SONS' piano company.\n\nADLER\n\nThis famous old industry was founded in 1908 by Peter Adler and was, after a long and honorable career, owned and controlled by his sons, who give personal attention to every department of the model factory and offices in Louisville Ky. The instruments produced were distinguished for their fine and durable qualities. The Studio Grand, an instrument of marked power and beauty was only five feet in length, and it has attained to great favor among discriminating classes of music lovers.\n\nAEOLIAN\n\nH. B. Tremaine was a business genius who brought about the commercial exploitation of the piano player on a big scale. Tremaine's father had built a successful small business making and cranked table-top-sized mechanical organs, a very popular item in homes in the late 1800's. He founded the \"Aeolian Organ and Music Company\" around 1888; the firm achieved considerable success with larger instruments and organs. His son took over in 1899 and immediately set about to apply his own business acumen to the company's affairs. With the newly perfected \"Pianola,' he launched an aggressive advertising campaign which was entirely new to the stodgy piano business. With four page color advertisements (almost unheard of in that day) published in the popular magazines, he literally stunned the piano industry with the message that here, indeed, was the answer to everyone's prayer for music in the home! Tremaine and Pianola built an enormous business empire over the next thirty years. It wasn't long after the turn of the century that it was deemed desirable to \"miniaturize\" the clumsy Pianola and other similar, instruments so that they could be built directly inside the pianos. Within a few short years, the push up\"players disappeared from the scene. By this time everyone got into the act, and every piano maker so manufactured a player of some sort.\n\nThis name is known the world over in connection with musical instruments, It is applied to some of the various products of the Aeolian Company of New York which instruments of renown included the Duo Art Pianola, Weber Pianola, Steck Pianola, Wheelock Pianola, Stuyvesant Pianola, Steinway Duo Art Pianola, Stroud Pianola the Aeolian Orchestrelle and the Aeolian Pipe Organ; it also controlled the Meludee Music Co., Inc., and the Universal Music Co.\n\nAHLSTROM PIANO COMPANY\n\nEstablished by Mr. C.A. Ahlstrom, who was a noted piano expert of the era and whose ideas aided in the development of the Piano Industry. The Ahlstrom \"ARTONE\" piano was marked by several improvements, such as the non-blocking Action and a device for dividing tone volume, which enabled the production of a sustained pianissimo tone in the bass for the accompaniment, with the normal tone in the treble for melody. This device is used today by virtually every piano maker in the world as the left pedal on every vertical piano manufactured. The \"ARTONE\" name was used to designate the special characteristics of Ahlstrom Pianos because of their highly perfected construction and artistic tone. An Ahlstrom \"ARTONE\" Upright piano may be worthy of rebuilding. One of the few upright-vertical pianos in the world worth the time and investment to do so. This also applies to the Player-Pianos known as the \"ARTONOLO,\" and the Ahlstrom grands known as the \"ART-GRAND\" and \"ART- REPRODUCING\" Grand Expression - Reproducing Player Pianos - Not just a player piano but a player piano that plays with the exact amount of loud and soft expression by the artist. All \"ART-REPRODUCING\" Pianos are collectors items that command very high prices.\n\nALBERT\n\nPianos bearing this name have an enviable reputation for superior workmanship, materials, tone qualities, beautiful case designs and customer satisfaction. This was one of the established piano houses that always strived to see how perfectly they could construct each piano. Each instrument was carefully inspected by Mr. Daniel Albert musician extraordinary, and expert piano builder wherever and whenever he was available. Pianos worth rebuilding.\n\nALBRECHT\n\nAlbrecht pianos were one of the first pianos made in America. Established in 1774 By Charles Albrecht of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. A little known historical fact is that an Albrecht Piano was located in Independence Hall on the day the declaration of Independence was signed. The first Albrecht Piano can be viewed at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n\nALDRICH\n\nHouse's name of pianos sold by Sherman Clay, San Francisco, California, the unchallenged leader in music the same company that provided music to the entire west coast of America. Pianos were always of excellent and durable quality.\n\nALLMENDINGER\n\nEstablished in 1902, Grand pianos were distinguished for their beautiful tone, their handsome and distinctive designs, their exquisite craftsmanship and great durability. Grand pianos were made one-at-a-time with the finest raw materials available. Some instruments were made under the name of long time piano maker B.G. Henderson.\n\nALTOONA Well known A Pennsylvania brand name throughout the Middle Eastern States.\n\nAMERICAN PIANO COMPANY\n\nThis company was created as a \"combine\" of the finest pianos the world has ever seen. Company was established in 1903, later to become Aeolian-American. Subsidiary Companies Chickering & Sons, Boston, Mass., established 1823 Wm. Knabe & Co., Baltimore, Md., established 1837 Mason & Hamlin Co., Boston established 1854 Armstrong Co., Rochester, N. Y. which includes the following subsidiary companies Haines Bros., established 1851 Marshall & Wendell Piano Co., established 1835 Franklin Piano Co. established 1894; Foster & Co. established 1881; Armstrong Piano Co. established in 1884; Brewster Piano Co., established 1883; The Amphion Co., established 1903; also, East Rochester Iron Works and The Ampico Corporation.\n\nThe American Piano Company organized in 1903. The affiliation of the various houses forming it insured for each a wider scope for musical activity, and valuable advantages in securing the best the world markets afford in materials which enter into piano construction. The wisdom of this important affiliation of various interests with similar ideals is apparent to any student of modern business methods disclosing such affiliation to be the uniting factor in the success of every great American institution of equal importance however, was the preservation of the individuality of the great houses forming this company. This individuality was preserved with scrupulous care. The Chickering was still made in Boston, where it has been made continuously for nearly a hundred years, in the great factory built through the foresight and vision of Jonas Chickering.\n\nThe Chickering organization and personnel directed its construction and preserved the high ideals of the founder. The Knabe made in Baltimore since 1837, was still constructed there with all the Knabe traditions in the hands of those who received their inspiration from the elder Knabe. In Rochester the Foster-Armstrong Company embraced in a series of factories in which the individuality of various pianos was preserved and directed by its separate organizations Haines Bros., Marshall & Wendell, Franklin, Foster, Armstrong and The American Piano Company also manufactured the Ampico, which was obtainable in several of the pianos made at its various divisions.\n\nAMERICAN PLAYER-PIANO\n\nThe American Player-Piano Co. was established in 1902. Many thousands of these instruments have been sold, and they give perfect satisfaction. The industry is controlled by Bjur Bros. Co. of New York, which has won a place of distinction in the musical world. A player of first-class quality and perfectly safe to purchase. Refer also to Bjur Bros. Co.\n\nAMPICO\n\nThe ordinary player-piano has only one basic function, that of striking the notes. The reproducing piano added the ability to recreate the touch, the shadings, the nuances, of the original recording - all the expression characteristics, and making the difference between purely mechanical sounds and true artistry. The paper roll was obliged, therefore, to include extra perforations which carried the \"expression information\" in coded form. These codes, which bear a resemblance to the language of modern computers, were either captured at the time of the initial recording or added later in an editing process. The reproducing piano was equipped with apparatus to \"read\" these expression holes and to reconstruct the exact expression of a piece while other holes played the notes. Today, when we hear the words \"digitally enhanced,\" we think of a highly-sophisticated disc electronic sound system replete with elaborate and costly loudspeakers, a magnificent cabinetry tailored to fit properly into one's home and all backed up by extensive marketing and advertising by numerous manufacturers.\n\nOne wonders how anything could possibly sound finer. Yet to many, the true ultimate in \"digital piano\" occurred when the reproducing piano reigned supreme in its ability to re-create \"live\" the performances of great keyboard artists right in the home.\n\nThe American Piano Company introduced its device to the market and called it the Ampico. It was based on the designs of an eccentric mechanical genius, one Charles Fuller Stoddard. Stoddard, whose home was a maze of newfangled contraptions of his own design, spent the last few years of his life entertaining the world's greatest piano virtuosos who would record on his unique Ampico recording piano. Ampico reproducing systems were eventually installed in such fine pianos as the Mason & Hamlin, the Knabe, the Chickering, the Beale in Australia, and the Willis in Canada.\n\nIn the mid-twenties, the Ampico Corporation engaged a scientist, Dr. Clarence Hickman, to completely re-engineer the Ampico reproducing system and roll making process. His work resulted in the so-called \"Model B\" Ampico pianos which represented the highest possible standards of technology available at the time. Hickman developed the famous \"spark chronograph\" method of capturing expression characteristics of individual pianists and today, the \"Model B\" Ampico pianos are in great demand by collectors, and at prices that go right through the roof, $100,000 to $200,000 in mint condition. Hickman recognized that the best way to measure expression is in terms of the energy imparted directly to the piano strings by the piano's hammers. He devised a scheme by which the velocity, and hence the energy, of each hammer could be measured just prior to hitting the string. This information was then directed to a recording device and the coded expression holes were adapted directly to the master production roll. Hickman was also a renowned expert on explosives, and he is responsible for the development of the tank-busting recoilless rifle, the \"bazooka,\" which helped the United States secure victory in World War II. The bazooka is named after still another musical instrument, but that's another story.\n\nThe Ampico received the highest endorsement of artists and musical critics throughout the world and demonstrated its ability to reenact perfectly the artists playing in comparison concerts in which it demonstrated side by side with the actual playing of the living pianist, Godowsky, Rubirstein, Dobitaityi, firovitch, Ornsteili, Levitzki, Moisciwitsch and many other great pianists have submitted their playing to this supreme test with triumphant results for the Ampico. In addition to playing the artists' record music rolls the Ampico may be operated with any standard 88-note music roll to which the operator imparts his own interpretation and the instrument may be played manually the same as any upright or grand. in using the artists' record music rolls the Ampico is operated with an electric motor which obviates the necessity of pumping or effort of any kind on the part of the operator. The Ampico may be had in the world-famous Chickering, Haines Bros., Marshall & Wendell, Franklin, Fischer and the celebrated Knabe pianos and for Canadian distribution also in the Willis pianos.\n\nAMPICHRON\n\nTimer created by Ampico to turn on precisely on the hour, plays a short selection and strike the hour throughout the day.\n\nANDERSON, POUL & ANDERSON & BYSMAN\n\nImported by F.T. Anderson, New York,. Built by Ricca Piano Company\n\nANGELUS\n\nGood quality vertical and grand pianos handmade in New Jersey and New York. Production about 500 pianos a year. Excellent rebuilt project. The Angelus reproducing piano made and distributed by the Premier Grand Piano Corp. was a fine piano. It reproduced the playing of the world's great pianists exactly true to life. These remarkable results are due to the employment of the famous Angelus recording and expression devices.\n\nAPARTMENT GRAND\n\nName applied to a small 4' 7\" grand piano equipped with an electric candelabra. Built for small apartments, very popular in the Chicago and Mid West United States. Circa 1920 - 1933. By Lyon & Healy Chicago Ill.\n\nAPOLLO\n\nEstablished as Clark 1901-. The trademark \"Apollo\" was one of the best known and most widely advertised names in the world. The Apollo reproducing system was created and manufactured by Welte, with values similar to the Ampico collection. Welte piano rolls contain many of the worlds greatest artists and composers of the time. by Wurlitzer DeKalb Ill.\n\nThe trade-mark \"Apollo\" is one of the best known and most widely advertised names in the piano trade, both in this and foreign countries, in many of which the trade mark has been registered and a large business established The name was first used by Melville Clark Piano Co of De Kaib, Illinois The name Apollo has been for some years past the name of a very high grade line of grand pianos and reproducing grand pianos manufactured by The Apollo Piano Company.

Produced 60,000 pianos in 15 years. These pianos are worthy of restoration. Grand pianos were distinguished for their beautiful tone, their handsome and distinctive designs, their exquisite craftsmanship.\n\nARGYLE Trademark name on pianos of durable character by Elbel Bros., South Bend, Md.\n\nARIA DAVINA This name now familiar as applied to pianos is that of the M.Schulz Co. reproducing piano. The Aria Divinas were artistic instruments in every way from case designs to tone and accuracy with which the performances of great pianists are reproduced with perfect ease by the performer. The Aria Divina is an instrument of artistic character in which are features of notable achievement. In everything that was advanced in the latest development of the instruments by which the actual performances of the world's greatest pianists were instantly reproduced in any parlor the Aria Divina stood. Any Aria Divina piano is worth the time and investment to completely rebuild.\n\nARION\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa. Name used on pianos by various piano merchants. The original was an excellent commercial piano around the turn of the century.\n\nARLINGTON A very old piano name found upon instruments produced by the American Piano Company.\n\nARMSTRONG\n\nWas made by the Armstrong Piano Company factory located in Rochester, N. Y.. The quality of the Armstrong was best described by the company's slogan, \"Sound in Body and Musical in Soul.\" The Armstrong was noted for refinement of case design, great durability and beautiful tone quality. The Armstrong player-pianos were among the most widely known of the reliable instruments on the market. Armstrong pianos had been used in the Rochester Public Schools with practical exclusiveness for many years. The name of this instrument was that of a prominent officer of the American Piano Co., a gentleman of long experience in the piano industry and personally one of the foremost influences in the line of work to which he is devoted.\n\nARTEMIS\n\nThis was the name applied by the Steger & Sons Piano Mfg. Company of Chicago and Steger, Illinois, to a line of pianos and player pianos of high character produced by the Artemis Division of that industry. The instruments were very reliable. They were noted for beautiful tone and admirable designs. The construction of Artemis pianos and player pianos was thoroughly dependable. The popularity of the Artemis line of pianos had made it a national institution. The success as popular, moderate priced instruments had been achieved on the basis of merit. Considerations such as overall condition should be made before investing in a complete rebuild unless there is sentimental value involved.\n\nARTIST NEWARK N.J. Name used by Bamberger's Department store on a reliable piano\n\nARTISAN SEE A.B. CHASE COMPANY\n\nARTONE\n\nThis name was employed by Ahlstrom Piano Co., of Jamestown, N.Y. to designate the special characteristics of the Ahlstrom pianos, because of their highly perfected construction and artistic tone. The makers considered them a classic among pianos and therefore featured as the Ahlstrom \"ARTONE\" pianos, the players being known as the \"Artonolo\" and the grands as \"Arto-Grand\" and \"Art Reproducing,\" these names being derivatives of \"ARTONE.\"\n\nART-O-TONE\n\nThis is the distinguishing name adopted by the Schumann Piano Co. of Rockford, Ill., The Art O Tone was first introduced at the annual convention of the piano trades in Chicago.\n\nASTOR PIANO CO.\n\nThis company was owned and controlled by the Bacon Piano Co., New York City, of which Mr. W. P. H. Bacon was president. This piano manufacturing concern was named in honor of John Jacob Astor, who founded the Bacon Piano Company in the year 1789. The Astor Piano Co. produced uprights and player-piano instruments that were notable for their beautiful resonant tone and handsome and distinctive case designs. The Astor Piano was renown for it's quality and workmanship. The Astor Piano is an excellent instrument to consider rebuilding.\n\nAUTOPIANO\n\nOne of the strongest and most enterprising of the American player- piano industries. The success of this factory had been such that the factory floor space embraced more than 300,000 square feet with an annual capacity of 10,000 player pianos. The Autopiano Company had for years exported its popular product to sections of the world, and the Autopiano was notable for its remarkable expression capabilities and staunch durability. It resisted the climatic extremes of the Arctic regions and the tropical zone equally well.\n\nBeing manufactured by player-piano specialists, in large factories devoted exclusively to the manufacture of player-pianos, and having an expert knowledge of the exact requirements of the foreign trade, were all leading reasons why the Autopiano Company proposition was unusually attractive and appealing. The Autopiano line embraced a comprehensive assortment of prices and styles, including upright players, reproducing pianos and grand player-pianos. This company manufactured the Autopiano, the Autopiano Electric Expression, the Autopiano Grand, the Autopiano Welte-Mignon (licensed), the Autopiano Welte-Mignon (licensee) Grand, and the Pianist Player-piano.\n\nIt was said that there were twice as many Autopiano's in use as any other player piano. The Autopiano was a thoroughly high grade piano, containing a player mechanism of marvelous attainments in which a great number of patented devices that make possible interpretation of the highest order on the Autopiano. The Autopiano received the highest awards at the following expositions: Grand Highest Award, Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exhibition, 1909; Grand Prix, Rotterdam, Holland, International Musical Exhibition, 1909; Gold Medal, Manchester, England, Industrial Exhibition, 1910; Gold Medal. Manchester Coronation Exhibition, 1911; Highest Award, Appalachian Exposition, Knoxville, Tenn., 1911; Gold Medal, Second Insular Fair, Porto Rico, 1911; Festival of Empire, London, England, 1911; Grand Prix, International Exposition, Petrograd, Russia, 1911; Grand Premix, International Exposition, Turn Italy, 1911; Gold Medal, International Exhibition, Leeds, England, ibis; Grand Prix and Diploma of Honor, Anglo-American Exhibition at London, England, in 1914; and the Gold Medal and Diploma of Honor, International Exposition at Lyons, France 1914.

The New Mexico and Washington State Buildings of the Panama-California Exposition, San Diego, Cal. 1915, also officially selected the Autopiano. In addition to this practically universal selection at these last two named exposition. , The Autopiano received at the San Francisco Panama-Pacific International Exposition the following awards: (1) The medal of Honor; (2) Gold Medal; (S) Silver Medal.\n\nThe Autopiano was also an official purveyor to the royal families of Japan and is in the palaces of Prince Shidlnadya and Prince ITO; they also enjoy this distinction in Korea where Prince Ye of the reigning dynasty had an Autopiano in his palace. Puccini used an Autopiano, and Victor Herbert the composer expressed his appreciation of this instrument.\n\nVessels in the United States and foreign navies purchased and used these instruments. The manner in which they stand up under all sorts of climatic conditions and hard usage incidents to life on the shipboard is strong evidence of their great durability.\n\nAbbe Lorenzo Perosi, once the leader of the famous Sistine Choir of Rome. And director of all music used in the Catholic Church, honored The Autopiano Co. with a testimonial as to the artistic quality of this remarkable instrument. Autopiano was appointed as the official piano to the Holy See by His Holiness, Pius XI. , That appointment made the third consecutive Pontifical benediction, meant that the Autopiano was predominant at the Vatican. The Autopiano received further endorsements from Her Majesty, Elizabeth, Queen of the Belgians; Cardinal Mercer of Belgium, and the new American Cardinal Dougherty. The Autopiano enjoyed wonderful popularity in the United States Army. Seven auto pianos were shipped to be used at the Fortress Monroe. Nearly one hundred were in use in various army posts throughout the country before the war. During the war more than 200 were shipped to various cantonments throughout the United States bringing the total of the auto pianos in use in the United States Army to nearly 300. The most amazing thing was that these instruments were purchased by all of the aforementioned people and places.\n\nAUTOPIANO - WELTE- MIGNON\n\nAs a player, using any eighty-eight note music roll, it was the Autopiano itself, electrically pumped. As a reproducing piano using the Welte-Mignon reproducing record, it presented the exact \"tonal portrait\" of the artist. Every gradation of tone, every change of the tempo, every dynamic modification was unerringly reproduced. The world's master pianists, most eminent composers recorded their art for the Welte-Mignon Model of The Autopiano.\n\nThis company of distinguished musicians includes Paderewski, Hofmann, Busoni, dePachmann. D'Albert, Lhevinne. Bloomfield-Zeisler, Sauer, Gabrilowitsch, Scharwenka, Ganz, Schelling, Caireno, Spross, Grieg, R. Strauss, Samaroff, Epstein, Fryer, Mero, LaForge, Saint)Saens, Leschetizky, Debussy, Leoncavallo, Lamond, Nikisch, Humperdinck and many others, as well as all the late popular lists played by New York's finest jazz artists.\n\nThe remarkable effects produced by the Welt-Mignon Model of the Autopiano (licensed) were made possible by the use of the Auto de Luxe Welte-Mignon player mechanism (licensee). The faithful recording of the artist's performance are procured by a secret process. How carefully the secret is guarded is demonstrated by the fact that no other reproducing piano has been able to approximate the results achieved through the Welt-Mignon mechanism, using the Welt Artist reproducing records. This instrument has been submitted to various comparison tests of the severest nature. And in every instance has been triumphant. The Welte-Mignons Model of The Autopiano (licensee) was, therefore, a great achievement in a double sense, in that it had artistic possibilities, second to none.\n\nAUTOTONE\n\nA high class player-piano manufactured in the Autotone Department of Hardman, Peck & Co., New York City. The Autotone possesses a number of exclusive features. Among which are: The Accentors, which accomplishes the \"human touch\" the ability to properly accent the melody; the \"loud\" pedal, the Selector, enabling one to run through a roll quickly and silently until the special part one has selected to play is reached; the Transposing Adjustor. Enabling one to transpose any composition from its original key specially valuable in accompanying singers and which also insures perfect adjustment of the music roll should it ever be affected by climatic changes: and the graduating lever by means of which the amount of tone can be he regulated the same as by the soft pedal; the Repertoire, containing an inexhaustible wealth of music of every kind. Unless the name Autotone, (spelled exactly as it sounds) appears on the fall board, the instrument is not genuine. The Autotone is made with two (and only two) basic pianos) Hardman and Harrington. Unless the basic piano is one of these, the instrument is not an Autotone, The Autotone is not a combination of a player mechanism made in one factory and piano made by another concern. It is, on the contrary, a complete player-piano of, the highest class, every portion of which player action, piano action and entire piano itself being made in one factory under the personal supervision of the experts of Hardman, Peck & Co.\n\nFRANCIS BACON\n\nFrancis Bacon pianos and player pianos were made by The Bacon Piano Co., W. P. H. Bacon, president. The history of this company, starting in 1789, is the history of the piano business in America. It received medals and diplomas for the excellence of its instruments wherever they have been exhibited, notably at the Philadelphia World's Fair in 1876, and at Chicago in 1908. This instrument enjoyed unusual favor with the trade and the musical public, and was regarded as one of the most versatile of all desirable instruments in the market. Francis Bacon pianos, player pianos, electric expression players, reproducing pianos (licensed under Welte-Mignon patents) and grands had a century and a quarter of experience and \"know how\" behind them and emphasize unusual value at moderate prices.\n\nBAILEY\n\nThis well known piano, established 1901, attained a good place among popular instruments. Instruments of extraordinary value which are guaranteed by Bjur Bros. Co. Factory, 707 Whitlock Ave., New York. In the matter of durability also, these pianos were desirable for home use where moderate cost was a consideration coupled with the natural desire to receive good value for the money invested. There were well more than 45,000 Bailey pianos sold in the United States. The Bailey Piano was controlled by Bjur Bros. Co. New York, N.Y. Bailey pianos were manufactured by Bjur who also manufactured the American Piano, not connected to The AMERICAN PIANO COMPANY, East Rochester N.Y. Bjur was bought out during 1928 by Kohler & Campbell - Bailey pianos were also manufactured as Brambach.\n\nBALDWIN\n\nPianos bearing this well known and an honorable name was the product of The Baldwin Piano Mfg.Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio, and were. In the best sense of the word, instruments of the highest degree of excellence. The system or chain of scientific improvements peculiar to the Baldwin piano based on the law of acoustics, and known as the Baldwin acoustic system, which permitted the greatest conservation of tone, secures an artistic result of the highest quality, and has resulted in gaining for. It a leading position among the world's artistic musical instruments. The Baldwin piano has an individuality of the highest character. When it was exhibited at the International Exposition at Paris in 1900 it was honored with an award (The Grand Prix) which has never been bestowed on any, other American piano, and the highest honor ever received by any, piano made In America. The Baldwin pianos are made in most modem and perfectly equipped factories under ideal manufacturing conditions. At the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Mo., 1904, the Baldwin piano was again awarded the Grand Prize and still another Grand Prize was awarded the Baldwin pianos and Manualos at the Anglo-American Exposition, London, 1914. The \"New York Tribune,\" in commenting on the comprehensive display of the Baldwin Company at Paris, and the success of this piano and this house, said that they made a record that would never he forgot in the history of uprights, grands and reproducing pianos, the grands including the various sizes from concert grands to small grands for parlors. In Rome, 1923, the Baldwin piano was awarded the Papal Medal and the House of Baldwin appointed \"Purveyors to the Holy See.\" The Baldwin piano is recognized as a universal favorite between the leading operatic artists and virtuosos of the pianoforte. The Baldwin Manualo is a unification of the most artistic piano with the most scientific players' construction; in other words, it combines the highest artistic attainment in piano production with the most gratifying ability of performance. The entire output is controlled by The Baldwin Piano Company.\n\nThe Baldwin Grand Piano, designed, built and guaranteed by the Baldwin Company, Loveland, Ohio, is used exclusively by the first rank of artists in all spheres of musical expression - pianists, composers, conductors, singers, instrumentalists - as well as the outstanding symphony orchestras around the world and in music festivals everywhere. Without reservation, from the nine-foot concert grand to the five feet, two inch grand, every Baldwin embodies the latest concepts of acoustical science and piano making, it is a precision engineered musical instrument of the highest degree of excellence. Any Baldwin made piano is worth the time. Money and energy to rebuild or refurbish. Baldwin also builds Howard spinet and grand pianos, and Hamilton studio pianos for home and school, all maintain great resale value.\n\nBAUS\n\nA reliable instrument of good reputation, made by The Baus Piano Co. at Southern Boulevard and Trinity Avenue, New York; also makers of the Baus Player Piano.

This illustrious firm, the oldest piano house in the United States, has been at all times in the forefront and has received world wide recognition for its part in developing the pianoforte on distinctive lines.\n\nJonas Chickering, the founder, was born at Mason Village, New Hampshire, in April 1796, where, after a sound schooling, he thoroughly learned the business of cabinetmaking. Impelled by a restless ambition to seek a larger field, he went to Boston in his early twenties.\n\nThere he entered the factory of a well-known piano maker of those days and pursued a course of study in piano making in its then primitive stage. It was not long before the genius of Jonas Chickering manifested itself, and he introduced a series of changes and improvements which have since become standard and which revolutionized the methods then prevailing. His name from the earliest times has been constantly linked with the Americanizing of the piano by methods of such importance and value that both America and Europe today admit their worth by universal adoption. To him must be ascribed the invention of the full iron plate for grand pianos recorded in 1837. This invention was accepted by the scientific world as one of far reaching importance; indeed, it proved to be the foundation of all modern piano construction, for without it the sonorous grands of today would not have been impossible. It successfully solved the problem of the proper support for the great strain of the strings and defined a new era in the history of piano-making. In 1843, Jonas Chickering invented a new deflection of the strings and in 1845 the first practical method for over stringing in square pianos, that is, instead of setting the strings side by side, substituting an arrangement of them in two banks, one over the other, not only saving space but bringing the powerful bass strings directly over the most resonant part of the sound-board, a principle which obtains to this day in the construction of all pianos, both grands and uprights. Until the year 1852, Jonas Chickering superintended each department of his business with his usual scrupulous care but was relieved of much of this responsibility upon his taking into partnership his three sons, all of whom had received under their father a practical training of the highest order. The genius of C. Frank Chickering as a \"scale\" draftsman soon became internationally know and acknowledged and to his extensive scientific research is to be attributed much of the renowned beauty of the Chickering tone. Not content with retaining this invaluable knowledge himself he imparted the secrets of his studies to those in the factory in whose gifts he had confidence, thus insuring their perpetuation. In addition to the many patents taken out by Jonas Chickering, his sons and their successors, various methods exclusive to themselves have also been employed and there are in constant use operations of an abstract character which may be described as mechanical subtleties possessing great value and which are an integral part of the Chickering system.\n\nThe above outline of the significant importance of the Chickering system will appeal to the practical minded but to those who would know more of the romance and charm which the Chickering story holds for the student of America's musical development. The significance and historic value of the Chickering in the development of the pianoforte in America are seen in the preservation at the Ford Museum at Dearborn of several important Chickering including the very first instrument made by Jonas Chickering in 1823. Others are: the first Chickering upright made in 1830 and the first Chickering grand completed prior to 1850. Chickering & Sons have received upwards of 200 first medals and awards. These have been received from States and sovereigns, and international expositions and learned societies in all parts of the world embracing every known method of honoring distinguished merit. C. Frank Chickering was personally vested with the Imperial Cross of the Legion of Honor at the hands of Napoleon 111. The significance of this high honor is the more appreciated because of its extreme rarity, very few such honors having been bestowed for accomplishments in the fine arts. In 1923 Chickering & Sons were the recipients of a remarkable tribute from musicians and persons of prominence in all walks of life who united in celebrating the Hundredth Anniversary of the founding of Jonas Chickering's epoch making enterprises.\n\nA committee headed by the Hon. Calvin Coolidge (then Vice) President of the United States, carried to a successful and brilliant conclusion what was termed the Jonas Chickering Centennial Celebration, culminating in a banquet held at the Copley Plaza, Boston, at which Mr. Coolidge was the chief speaker. It marked in a most significant manner a century of musical achievement that is without parallel in the history of American piano making. The most famous virtuosi including pianists, singers and instrumentalists have exhausted superlatives in expressing their high admiration of the Chickering. The Handel and Haydn Society of Boston the world's foremost oratorio group, established 1815, has used the Chickering exclusively for more than a century.\n\nThe grand and upright pianos and the grands and uprights with the Ampico, which bear this famous name, possess the distinction which belongs to the oldest continuous piano industry in the United States. In the year 1923 a nation wide observance of the Jonas Chickering Centennial marked the completion of a full century of artistic musical endeavor of the Chickering house. Calvin Coolidge, then Vice President, was the principal speaker at the banquet in Boston on April 21st. The founder of this illustrious house was Jonas Chickering whose name is inseparably associated with many of the most important piano improvements of all time. He was born in Mason Village, N. H., on April 17, 1759, and in his early twenties he went to Boston. He had already learned thoroughly the cabinet making trade, and his education had been thorough. He soon entered the employ of the pioneers' piano maker of those days, and began a course of serious study of the art which was to engross his life. The genius of Jonas Chickering soon made itself apparent and his industry kept pace. He revolutionized the methods of piano building, and with the introduction of his full iron plate, an advance of measureless importance, laid the foundation of the recognition which has ever since been accorded his name. So universally has the importance of this improvement been recognized that pianos are no longer made without it. It is but a short time back that the first Chickering piano ever made was repurchased by the Boston house and it is now in possession of the company, a source of pride to the present management and of interest to all music lovers. It illustrates the vast advance in piano building between the early days of the piano and the massive concert grands of today. In 1883 Jonas Chickering took into partnership his three sons, all of whom had received a practical training. C. Frank Chickering proved the inheritor of his father's genius, and as a\"scale' draftsman soon became widely known. To his dimensional and correlated studies are to be attributed much of the renowned beauty of the Chickering tone. The secrets of this invaluable knowledge he imparted to chiefs in the Boston factory, in whose gifts he had confidence, thus insuring their perpetuation. Not only were many patents taken out by Jonas Chickering, his sons and their successors, but various methods exclusive to themselves have also been employed, and there are in constant use operations of an abstract character which maybe described as mechanical subtleties which are an integral part of the Chickering system. Chickering & Sons have been recipients of upwards of 150 marks of distinction both in the United States and Europe, in the form of diploma, gold medals, and letters from learned bodies. C. Frank Chickering himself was personally invested with the Imperial Cross of the Legion of Honor by the hands of Napoleon III. Less than ten such honors having been bestowed for accomplishment in the fine arts, which fact adds significance to the distinction. Every recognized means of showing marked appreciation has been employed in all parts of the world. The most famous virtuosi have exhausted eulogistic language In declaring their admiration of the Chickering piano. But Chickering & Sons have never rested upon laurels won. The Chickering of today has kept pace with the exacting demands made upon the piano by present day artists. During the present season the Chickering Concert Grands are contributing to the aesthetic success artists as Dohnanyi, Mirovitch, Schnitzer, Levinne, and many others of the highest rank. Remarkable in employees. There are men living who worked with Jonas Chickering, a long life time of service which the house has been glad to honor. There are also scores who have been engaged in the Chickering departments for periods a running from 25 to nearly 50 years. This implies loyalty and esprit de corps invaluable in this art industry, and which is a reflection of its atmosphere. The House of Chickering stands in unquestioned financial strength and enjoys an integrity which has been its proud possession from the beginning.\n\nThe list of pianists, composers, and musicians who have since its inception used and endorsed the Chickering piano is much to long to include here. Several decades ago, this great house of pianos, content with its already rich background of achievement on the concert stage, turned its attention to the perfection of the smaller piano.

And in the construction of the Conover grand pianos there are also features of peculiar interest to scientific pianists. The grand rims are continuous and are made of separate layers of wood bent into permanent shape. These rims typify strength and, of course, conform to the shape of the grand plate. The Conover grand piano has received the enthusiastic indorsement of a large number of the famous pianists whose appearance in concert give added prominence to the piano upon which they prove their powers. The patented sounding board and frame construction in the small grand model is part of an improved construction designed to maintain the proper curvature of the sounding board, so necessary to preserve the original tonal beauty of the instrument. Instruments having this construction bear the trademark \"Crownstay.\" In a recent publication devoted to descriptions of the various styles of Conover pianos there are portraits of some of the most renowned pianists and vocalists accompanied by words of commendation.
