        "text": "Article content\n\nBRATTLEBORO, Vt. — A southern Vermont museum dedicated to organs has found itself with a surplus of the instruments.\n\nThe Estey Organ Company began producing organs in Brattleboro in 1863, and the company manufactured hundreds of thousands of reed and pipe organs inside its Brattleboro factories before closing in 1960. The Estey Organ Museum was set up 16 years ago to honour that legacy.\n\nThe museum opened after people began donating their old organs — but with every working organ, there were three or four others that came in that needed some care.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

But as the warehouse filled up, George said it was time to make a change.\n\nGeorge said the museum is coming into its own and offering concerts and talks on the Estey legacy — but, like at any non-profit, every penny counts.\n\n“We’re only now maturing into realizing that it’s also a responsibility that you want to be able to take care of them,” said George. “You know, you don’t want to be spending money on storage when you could be spending money on programs and that kind of a thing. So that’s the point where we are now, I think.”\n\nThe Brattleboro Historical Society began collecting old organs back in the 1980s, years before there was even an organ museum.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The Estey Organ Company is … probably the most important thing that ever happened to Brattleboro,” said historical society member John Carnahan, who was one of the members who began accepting the instruments more than 30 years ago.\n\nCarnahan said it was the historical society’s duty to take in these relics of Brattleboro’s industrial past and, over time, the society collected more than 50 organs.\n\n“It was a complete mix,” Carnahan said. “Some of them were just really — just trash, almost; they were in such bad shape. But some were in beautiful condition.”\n\nThey took in enough beautiful organs that in 2002, some local musicians and historians started the Estey Organ Museum.\n\nBut the donations kept coming in: The museum says they’ve probably got about 150 organs that need some work. So for now, the museum is being much more selective.\n\nIf an organ works, and it’s on the small side, they’ll take it in and try to find a new owner.\n\nThere are some organs in the collection that only need a little tinkering, and the museum says that for a small donation, they can be yours.\n\nAnd the old broken ones out in the warehouse? Even if their music-making days are over, the museum says those organs can take on a new life by being turned into desks or bookcases.\n\n——\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2JUsWFj\n\n——\n\nInformation from: WVPS-FM, http://www.vpr.net\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest from Shopping Essentials"
