        "text": "Residents in an Etobicoke neighbourhood have taken to carrying baseball bats, air horns and pepper spray to protect themselves and their pets against a pack of coyotes living in Princess Margaret Park.\n\nCoyotes have lived in the neighbourhood for several years, but locals say the pack is becoming increasingly aggressive toward them and their dogs.\n\n\"Everybody is walking around with golf clubs, baseball bats, sticks and hockey sticks,\" said resident Amanda Thomson.\n\n\"Usually, you would think that's a little nerve-wracking to see somebody walking around with that, but they're walking around with their dogs for protection.\"\n\nComplaints about coyotes in the area have skyrocketed in July. The city said it has received 27 service requests to 311 about coyotes around the park this year, including 18 last month alone.\n\nIn 2023, there was only one coyote-related service call from the area for the entire year.\n\nMany houses back onto the park, which includes a forested area with trails where the coyotes live.\n\nThe city is hosting a community meeting Thursday evening to discuss concerns about the pack.\n\nThomson is planning to attend the meeting, but others are skeptical about what solutions will be discussed.\n\n\"They're not going to tell us something we don't already know,\" said Donna Dziemianko, who also lives in the neighbourhood. \"They're going to tell us how to co-habitate peacefully with coyotes.\"\n\nCity doesn't know why coyotes are being more aggressive\n\nSince the Canada Day long weekend, the city said it began receiving more reports about coyotes interacting with dogs — including incidents where coyotes attacked and injured pets.\n\nThe city said it does not know why the coyotes are becoming more aggressive toward dogs.\n\nResidents say a man and his dog were attacked by the pack last month. Both survived, but people in the area are still rattled.\n\nDziemianko says she hasn't walked her dog, Dallas, in the park since the attack.\n\n\"It's sad because the park is beautiful,\" she said. \"That's what it's there for — to use. We can't use it because the coyotes live there.\"\n\nThomson said she's seen coyotes lie in a bush by her street even in the early afternoon.\n\n\"As soon as you pull onto the street, you're like: 'I need to stay in my car or beep my horn or chase them down the street so I can get back into my house,'\" she said.\n\nChildren in a local daycare can't play in the park, Dziemianko said. And when she's walking down the street, she shouldn't have to worry about whether a coyote is following her.\n\nBoth Thomson and Dziemianko say the city should consider separating some of the coyotes and moving them somewhere else.\n\nCoyotes aren't a risk unless they attack: animal services\n\nBut Dr. Esther Attard, the director of Toronto Animal Services, said it's not possible to relocate coyotes. She said more coyotes will replace any that are removed.\n\n\"They've been here longer than we have and they'll continue to be here as long as there's green space,\" she said.\n\nAs well, it \"doesn't work\" to move coyotes to another territory where there may be an existing pack, she said.\n\nThough she said the injuries to pets are horrible, coyotes are not considered a public safety risk unless they start attacking humans.\n\n\"For dogs to be attacked by coyotes or have interactions with coyotes is not unusual, because [coyotes] are dogs too,\" she said.\n\nIf the coyotes are deemed a public safety risk, the city would kill them, not remove them, she said.\n\nThe pack of coyotes in the park is a family unit, including new pups born this year, Attard said. It's possible some pups may have been killed by dogs, causing the coyotes to be more protective, she said.\n\n\"It's more defensiveness, it's not aggressiveness,\" she said.\n\nAttard said some of the recent incidents involved dogs that were off-leash. The city requires dogs to be on a leash at all times in parks.\n\nSome people are also feeding the coyotes, she said. This can cause negative interactions when coyotes approach people who haven't been feeding them, expecting food.\n\n\"The coyote doesn't know how to discern between, 'Oh you're the person who gives food and you're the person who doesn't,'\" she said.\n\nMayor Olivia Chow said the city will hear residents' ideas about what it can do to help them deal with the pack.\n\n\"The city will provide the kind of information and the enforcement that's needed to keep people and their pets safe,\" she said Thursday.\n\nAttard said people should learn to coexist with the coyotes. But for Dziemianko, the pack is interfering with locals' day-to-day life.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think we have to go kill them all right now, but when they have more rights than we do, that's pretty sad,\" she said.\n\nTips from the city when dealing with coyotes"
