        "text": "Judging by Etobicoke’s steadily increasing population, it’s clear this west end Toronto community is doing a few things right, especially seeing as many of those new Etobicoke residents have come directly from nearby places — most notably downtown Toronto.\n\nThere are quite a few reasons many residents of downtown Toronto are trading in the hustle and bustle of the city life for the more relaxed lifestyle living in Etobicoke affords. Space, safety, affordability, and Etobicoke’s long list of top-ranking schools are definitely among them.\n\nWhile essentially any homebuyer would value these traits, they tend to appeal to families more than any other demographic. But not every Etobicoke neighbourhood is built the same, and some are better suited to family life than others.\n\nAre you signed up for our newsletter yet?

Read through our end-to-end Etobicoke community guide, Living In Etobicoke, to get your bearings first.\n\nEdenbridge-Humber Valley\n\nIt would be difficult to start off our list of Etobicoke’s best family-friendly neighbourhoods without mentioning Edenbridge-Humber Valley first. This beautifully scenic residential neighbourhood in Etobicoke’s east end is easily one of the most ideal places for family life, and that’s down to a few different reasons.\n\nThe Homes\n\nThe homes within the Edenbridge-Humber Valley neighbourhood are perfectly suited to families of all sizes and ages. Because most of them were built between the 1930s and ‘60s when Etobicoke (and Toronto, for that matter) held significantly smaller populations than today, space was not at a premium.\n\nThat means most of the homes here are Tudors, English Cottages, Ranch-style detached homes set on generously sized lots with ample outdoor space for families to enjoy together and with friends and family.\n\nRecreation\n\nEdenbridge-Humber Valley is one of Etobicoke’s safest areas. Located away from some of Etobicoke’s busier main streets and populated with many large public parks and green spaces, Edenbridge-Humber Valley provides the perfect setting for young children to play in and grow up together.\n\nWith parks like Humber Valley Park, Buttonwood Park, Scarlett Mills Park, and Lambton Woods (just to name a few) there’s an abundance of safe public green spaces for children to safely play outside in.\n\nThe Residents\n\nAnd, because of Edenbrige-Humber Valley’s tight community bond, the neighbourhood’s parents often meet when their children play together too. In fact, it’s very common to see the friendly neighbours of Edenbrige-Humber Valley sharing a coffee in the morning, a cocktail in the evening, or chatting at school drop-offs and pick-ups.\n\nThat’s just one of the things that makes this community so special — the sense of togetherness all the local residents share. Edenbrige-Humber Valley really has that small-town, big heart feel, and is all centred around the safe, family-friendly community environment.\n\nThe Schools\n\nSpeaking about schools, Edenbrige-Humber Valley is also home to some of Etobicoke’s finest institutions, including Humber Valley Village Middle School and Kingsway College, both of which score high marks in national school rankings.\n\nEtobicoke is home to some truly amazing schools. To find out which public and private institutions we’re always recommending to our relocating clients, read our detailed guides Etobicoke schools here:\n\nHow To Choose The Right School For Your Child\n\nThe Top 5 Schools In Etobicoke\n\nOur Top Private Schools In Etobicoke\n\nDoes Edenbridge-Humber Valley sound like the perfect Etobicoke neighbourhood for you and your family? Get our full run-down of the area by reading about Living In Edenbridge-Humber Valley: A Scenic Etobicoke Gem.\n\nIslington-City Centre West\n\nJust southwest of Edenbrige-Humber Valley is where you’ll find the next family-friendly Etobicoke neighbourhood we want to spotlight on our list, Islington-City Centre West. Despite being located in central Etobicoke near some of the busiest commercial and business centres in the area, Islington-City Centre West is another fantastic place for growing families to live in.\n\nThe Homes\n\nWhile Islington-City Centre West is one of Etobicoke’s higher-population neighbourhoods, it’s also full of amazing little residential pockets away from the noise of the busier main streets and commercial areas that are perfect for every type of family.\n\nBetween WW2-era Bungalows, split-level houses, and condos, there’s a home here to suit the size and budget requirements for most Etobicoke families.\n\nHave our brilliant family-friendly Etobicoke neighbourhoods captured your interest? Have a look through our current Featured Listings page to see if there’s a home that will do the same!\n\nRecreation\n\nDon’t get it twisted — just because Islington-City Centre West has great access to many local shopping and commercial businesses doesn’t mean it’s short on parks and green space. Take Tom Riley Park, for instance, a 7.8-hectare public park located along the river banks of the picturesque Mimico Creek.\n\nThat park, along with about nine or ten others, all provide a great chance for the local children in this scenic neighbourhood to get outside and enjoy themselves safely year-round. Especially seeing as most of them feature fun active amenities like sports fields, public pools, playgrounds, and more.\n\nThe Residents\n\nBecause of the various different pockets and housing types within Islington-City Centre West, the neighbourhood is home to a very diverse group of local residents. Everyone from senior citizens to young singles live here, though families tend to dominate in the quieter residential areas.\n\nAs the older generations slowly move out of the area over time, most single family homes are bought up by young couples seeking to find a warm and welcoming community to raise their growing families in.\n\nThe Schools\n\nWhen it comes to the local schools in the Islington-City Centre West area, by far the most popular is Islington Junior Middle School, a Kindergarten to Grade 8 school that is actually the oldest across all of Etobicoke.\n\nApart from that, there are several private and Catholic schools in the area that are equally well-acclaimed too, including the Olivet School, Our Lady Of Peace Catholic School, and St. Elizabeth Catholic School, among many others.\n\nIslington-City Centre is one of the most popular neighbourhoods in Etobicoke for good reason. Read our comprehensive guide to the neighbourhood here: Living In Islington-City Centre West: A Home-Buyer’s Guide.\n\nThe Kingsway\n\nFound directly south of Edenbrige-Humber Valley is Etobicoke’s storied and prestigious neighbourhood, The Kingsway. One of Etobicoke’s very first neighbourhoods, The Kingsway is filled to the brim with history and tradition, though the neighbourhood’s high population of young families keeps the energy high and community vibe exciting.\n\nThe Homes\n\nAs one of Etobicoke’s oldest residential neighbourhoods, the houses within The Kingsway are all quite large and character-driven. The oldest homes in the area were built at the start of the 20th century, meaning lots of Victorian and Tudor-era homes alongside mid-century Arts & Crafts and modern new build houses.\n\nWhatever the architectural style, essentially every home here is set on a serene residential street surrounded by mature trees and large front and back yards. While these homes offer the ideal environment for families with young children to live and play in, they do tend to cost quite a pretty penny, as you might’ve expected.\n\nRecreation\n\nSandwiched between the Mimico Creek to the west and the Humber River to the east, this breathtaking neighbourhood is bordered by beautiful natural areas on both sides and has its fair share of parks and green spaces scattered throughout as well.\n\nOne of the most popular public parks is certainly Home Smith Park, which borders the Humber River and is a great spot for children to run along the trails, play on the grass, and learn about the plethora of fascinating wildlife along the river banks.\n\nThe Residents\n\nDue to the relatively higher price point for homes in The Kingsway area, the average income level of the local residents here tends to be quite high as well. However, that doesn’t mean the locals come across as exclusive or snobby — in fact, quite the opposite.\n\nThe Kingsway is actually full of delightful families who have found their ‘forever homes’ in the neighbourhood and regularly enjoy engaging in fun community events and neighbourhood get-togethers. There’s a real community vibe here, and not many families tend to leave the area once they’ve moved in.\n\nThe Schools\n\nWhen talking about the various schools in The Kingsway, this neighbourhood doesn’t fall short in that department either. Lambton Kingsway Junior Middle School is perhaps the most popular elementary school in the area, with Etobicoke Collegiate School adopting most of their students when they reach the secondary school level.\n\nAs for Catholic schools, Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic School is one of the most acclaimed in Etobicoke, let alone The Kingsway.\n\nIt’s tough to top The Kingsway when talking about the best Etobicoke neighbourhoods for families.
