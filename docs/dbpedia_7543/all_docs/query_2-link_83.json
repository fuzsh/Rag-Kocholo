        "text": "I have been very fortunate to have had a number of outstanding teachers, whose approach to crafting lessons and passion for their teaching subjects no doubt inspired me to join their ranks. One in particular, the late professor Alfonso Gracia-Saz, whose classes I attended at the University of Toronto, has had a lasting impact on my teaching. Alfonso always started lessons with a motivating narrative that brought life and meaning to the most abstract subjects.\n\nStudents in my classroom are asked to think about the \"why\" in mathematics, and dig deeper to really understand the underlying reasoning and connections between concepts. A healthy dose of skepticism on my part can help students enter into a productive debate. On the other hand, you may find me having individual conversations with students to help develop their confidence and communication skills.\n\nOutside of school, I'm a classical pianist and nature photographer. Being in nature is the best way for me to relax, rejuvenate and refocus. In the past few years, my photography has led me into the world of bird-watching. I now spend a good chunk of my free time learning about, observing and photographing birds, as well as tracking down (and occasionally travelling substantial distances to find) rare species.\n\nMy favourite memories of teaching are from running math club sessions. In school, nothing really beats the energy in the room when, after working on some challenging problems for some time on their own, students gradually start to discuss with each other. Soon they're at the board, arguing with each other, proving and disproving each other's statements, checking each other's work, delegating tasks, and generally engaging in true mathematical activity.\n\nI won't be the first to say that one of the most rewarding aspects of being a teacher is seeing the impact you have on the lives of your students. Especially as a math teacher, I often encounter students who start off unsure of themselves and their abilities, gradually develop a growth mindset and more accurate picture of what they are capable of. The self-confidence they develop affects not only their academic work, but their social and emotional lives both inside and outside of the school."
