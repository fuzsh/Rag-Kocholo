It is the University of Toronto’s largest need-based support program and covers the financial gap between a student’s actual education costs and the costs recognized by their provincial/territorial government student financial aid program. In other words, UTAPS covers unmet financial need.\n\nThrough UTAPS, U of T provides non-repayable grants to students to help cover this financial need gap, or unmet need.\n\nUTAPS is Now Open for Applications\n\nAll students who would like to be considered for UTAPS for the 2024-25 school year must complete and submit an application through the Need Navigator, along with any supporting documentation required as stated on the student’s application by the deadline."
