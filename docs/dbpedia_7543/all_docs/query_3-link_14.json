        "text": "Toronto, The 6ix, T-Dot, T.O, aka the best city in the world. So you’re traveling to Toronto for the first time and don’t know what to do, well you have come to the right place. Keep reading to see what you should do.\n\nI’ve visited Toronto several times now and each time gets better than the last. You really can’t go wrong with Toronto, everything from the food, nightlife, activities, and people… the city has something for everyone.\n\nWhere To Stay:\n\nAirbnb. This is a pretty obvious option but often times overlooked. I specifically knew that this time I wanted a view of La Tour CN or The CN tower. This meant that I needed to splurge of course, and I didn’t have the budget for a hotel splurge but had it for a roomy airbnb. If you’re strictly balling on a budget I would recommend looking at airbnbs/hotels in Scarborough or Etobicoke (in the GTA area but 15-20 mins close to downtown Toronto).\n\nIf you’re curious, these are two of the airbnbs that I’ve stayed in the last two times I’ve visited: Click here and here! Both of these spots were in the Fashion District which is my favorite neighborhood because it’s close to King street which is where most of the bars and clubs are at or near.\n\nDoubleTree by Hilton. Close to Nathan Phillips Square, Yonge-Dundas Square, Eaton Centre, and Chinatown. I also heard the cookies they serve at the front desk are B O M B.\n\nThompson Toronto. If you feel like splurging a bit, this is your best bet. It doesn’t hurt that the rooftop has amazing views of the skyline with the CN tower, either.\n\nWhat To Do:\n\nCN Tour. Super touristy, may be super basic but if this is your first trip to the 6ix, you’ll want to say you did this. *not free*\n\n2. Nathan Phillips Square. The heart of downtown. During the winter months it turns into a skating rink. The big “Toronto” lights up in different colors and makes for a good photo op. They have fun events during NYE, Nuit Blanche, and even Farmer’s Markets.\n\n3. Kensington Market. The cool, hippie, and laid-back part of town. You’ll come across some dope stationary stores, restaurants, and weed shops. My recommendation is to visit “Pancho’s Bakery” and get a churro (tasted just like deep fried heaven).\n\n4. Museum of Illusions. Super fun day activity or for a cute day date. Your mind will definitely play tricks on you as you enter the upside down living room and the infinity room. You will also have a chance to play poker with yourself and you’ll be able to see yourself as a giant or as a very small person…triiiippy. *not free*\n\n5. Art Gallery of Ontario or The AGO. Find any art of your liking from European, Canadian, Contemporary, to Modern. The museum is pretty big so I would block off half a day to really explore it to it’s entirety. *not free*\n\n6. Yonge-Dundas Square. The Times Square of Canada, but of course 100x cleaner and imo bigger and better looking. You’ll find stores, the eaton centre, and a variety of different restaurants.\n\n7. St. Lawrence Market. Food hall, local grocery shopping, souvenir shops, etc.\n\n8. Distillery District. A historic destination set in 19th century buildings. You will find your way into restaurants and shops on these cobblestone streets. Host of the Christmas Market every year in Toronto.\n\n9. Her Majesty’s Pleasure. Okay, I’ll admit, I did not go here but it was right next to my airbnb and I saw it every time I walked out. A hip nail salon/wine bar. You get your nails done and get tipsy at the same time. Not to mention, the decor is on fleek. Perfect gift or “treat yo self” kind of thing.\n\n10. Graffiti Alley. Dope alley way of full of creative art pieces. Perfect for an afternoon walk, mini photo shoot, and to take in the neighborhood.\n\nI hope that this helps you plan your next trip to The 6ix! If you have any questions about Toronto just reach out to me and I’ll help you out.\n\nxoxo,\n\nWynee\n\nPIN THIS!"
