Information about asking for an urgent hearing appears at the bottom.\n\nThe Small Claims Court hears civil claims for $35,000 or less.\n\nThe streamlined procedures in the Rules of the Small Claims Court allow the Court to determine cases more quickly and at a lower cost than in the Superior Court of Justice.\n\nTypically, deputy judges preside in Small Claims Court proceedings. Deputy judges are senior lawyers appointed for a term by the Regional Senior Judge, with the approval of the Attorney General. The Ethical Principles for Deputy Judges of the Small Claims Court set the standards of conduct for deputy judges.\n\nIf you need legal advice about a Small Claims Court issue, you can contact Pro Bono Ontario’s Free Legal Advice Hotline at 1-855-255-7256.\n\nTo find a Small Claims Court location in your area, please see the Ministry of the Attorney General’s Court Addresses page.\n\nClaims for more than $35,000 must be brought in the Superior Court of Justice.\n\nSuing someone in Small Claims Court\n\nIf you want to sue someone in Small Claims Court, you will need to\n\nhave court staff issue your claim\n\nserve your claim on every defendant\n\ncomplete and file an Affidavit of Service (Form 8A) for each defendant that was served.\n\nThe Making a claim section of the Ministry of the Attorney General’s Guide to procedures in small claims court explains these steps in more detail.\n\nFor more information about serving Small Claims Court documents, see the Serving documents section of the Ministry of the Attorney General’s Guide to procedures in small claims court.\n\nResponding to a claim against you\n\nIf you have been sued in the Small Claims Court, you may respond by filing a defence. You can find out more about responding to the claim in the Replying to a claim section of the Ministry of the Attorney General’s Guide to procedures in small claims court.\n\nIf you are a defendant and you do not file your defence within 20 days after you were served with the claim, then the plaintiff can ask court staff to note you in default. Once you are noted in default, the plaintiff can ask for judgment against you without notifying you. (This kind of judgment is called default judgment.)\n\nIf you have been noted in default or if the plaintiff has a default judgment against you, then you can bring a motion asking the Court to set aside the noting in default and the default judgment. More information about this process appears in the Replying to a claim section of the Ministry of the Attorney General’s Guide to procedures in small claims court.\n\nRequesting an urgent hearing\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Small Claims Court is accepting requests for urgent hearings. These include:\n\nhearings dealing with an arrest warrant related to a Small Claims Court proceeding.\n\nhearings that must be held urgently in order to avoid immediate and serious financial loss.\n\nThe Court grants these requests only in limited situations.\n\nTo request an urgent hearing, contact the Small Claims Court location where your case is based."
