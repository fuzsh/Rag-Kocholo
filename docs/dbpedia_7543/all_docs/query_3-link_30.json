        "text": "There are plenty of bike lanes throughout the downtown core. To rent a bike in the city, you can use Bike Share.\n\nThere is an option to get a one-year pass and use bikes for unlimited trips. Bike Share stands are all across the city. If you see a stand, you can use the kiosk to rent a bike using your credit card.\n\nYou will get charged for the time you use the bike. You are charged from the moment you leave one bike stand to when you dock your bike at the bike stand at your next destination.\n\nThe one-year pass will make things a lot easier if you are a frequent cyclist.\n\nThis is the quickest way to get around the city. The TTC will be your best friend, especially if you are living Downtown.\n\nThe TTC consists of subway, bus and streetcar:\n\nSubway\n\nThe subway is an underground train that runs through the city of Toronto and even into some of the suburbs. It consists of two major lines.\n\nThe Bloor-Danforth line (green) takes you all the way from the west end of the city to the east end (Etobicoke to Scarborough). The halfway point of this line is where the University of Toronto is located (St. George Station).\n\nThe University line (yellow) covers the downtown core and runs northbound and southbound. It runs up to North York (another suburb) and the last stop on the southbound area of the line is where you will get off if you want to check out concerts or a basketball, baseball or hockey game. Scotiabank Arena and Rogers Centre are both at Union Station.\n\nVery recently, the yellow line has extended northbound all the way to the suburb of Vaughan, the location of Canada's Wonderland.\n\nIf you plan to make frequent trips to the airport, there is also the UP Express, which takes you directly from Union Station to Pearson Airport in Mississauga.\n\nA subway fare is CA 3.25 and is easily paid with cash, subway tokens or a PRESTO card.\n\nThis is a card that can be topped up at any subway station. You can also make an account on their website and have it automatically topped up for you every time it gets below a certain amount.\n\nBus\n\nYou will find buses in almost every area of Toronto you can think of. Wherever it is you need to go, there is a route that will take you there.\n\nThey tend to run every 10 minutes, however in extreme weather conditions this can take a little longer.\n\nAn easy way to track your bus's location is to use an app called Rocketman. It allows you to track your bus in real time as it moves on its route. You can see the schedule for any route you want to take.\n\nStreetcar\n\nSimilar to buses, these run every 10 minutes. However, they are restricted to the downtown core.\n\nThe streetcars are much longer and can accommodate more people. This makes it easier to find a seat during peak hours.\n\nYou can use your PRESTO card for the subway, buses and streetcars. There is also the option to buy a one-year PRESTO pass, where you pay a one-time fee for unlimited trips for the year.\n\nToronto is divided into many different neighbourhoods.\n\nSome suburbs are quiet and residential, with more of a family feel, while others are filled with markets, shops, bars, cafes, and hotels.\n\nSome people call it a concrete jungle which isn't a bad thing if you like a quicker pace and lots of options.\n\nThe names of neighbourhoods in Downtown Toronto make it easy to know what to expect to see and taste. These neighbourhoods and their names have historical roots.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, when there were huge waves of immigration to Canada, immigrants settled in areas where there was a dominant presence of people with the same ethnicity.\n\nImmigrants came to these areas and established restaurants with their own authentic cuisine and built language schools, and a sense of community.\n\nThe neighbourhoods were nicknamed based off the ethnicity that lived there and the names have remained till this day.\n\nIf you visit these neighbourhoods in Toronto or choose to live there, you will understand the unique community feel as soon as you start to walk the streets."
