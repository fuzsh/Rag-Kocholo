        "text": "The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) will increase bus service on two dozen routes that mostly serve Scarborough, North York and Etobicoke — a move officials say is in response to complaints about crowding.\n\n“I hear from people that they want more buses. That’s what they want. They want more buses more frequently, shorter wait times, a comfortable ride not jammed like sardines and a more reliable commute,” Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said during a news conference Tuesday morning.\n\nBeginning on Sunday, TTC service is set to increase on the following routes:\n\n19 Bay\n\n25 Don Mills\n\n36 Finch West\n\n39 Finch East\n\n44 Kipling South\n\n46 Martin Grove\n\n53 Steeles East\n\n57 Midland\n\n60 Steeles West\n\n68 Warden\n\n72 Pape\n\n76 Royal York South\n\n95 York Mills\n\n104 Faywood\n\n111 East Mall\n\n114 Queens Quay East (new)\n\n122 Graydon Hall\n\n123 Sherway\n\n184 Ancaster Park\n\n902 Markham Road Express\n\n935 Jane Express\n\n939 Finch Express\n\n995 York Mills Express\n\nOfficials said the 995 York Mills Express bus route will see up to a 50 per cent service increase at times and the 902 Markham Road route will see more articulated buses to create extra capacity.\n\nA look at the posted changes showed buses on many of the routes will see intervals increased at certain times by one to five minutes. However, certain trips on some routes will see slight time increases as part of an effort to address reliability.\n\n“These changes can’t come soon enough,” TTC chair Jamaal Myers said.\n\nHe said the TTC bus network is currently operating at 91 per cent capacity, and after Sunday, it will have 96 per cent of its pre-pandemic service hours.\n\nTTC CEO Rick Leary said remote work policies have changed how riders are using the system, noting off-peak and weekend demand has jumped.\n\nOn certain weekend days, he said they have seen 118 per cent ridership compared to pre-pandemic levels and night service has also seen slightly more demand than before COVID-19.\n\nTTC Pape station bus terminal temporarily closing\n\nThere will be big changes in how buses service the station for riders who travel through Pape station.\n\nBeginning on Sunday until sometime in the fall, construction crews will close access to the bus terminal for major Ontario Line-related construction.\n\n25 Don Mills and 925 Don Mills Express buses will be redirected to Broadview station. 72B Pape and 81 Thorncliffe Park are being suspended while 72A and 72C Pape buses will be extended north to Thorncliffe Park (boarding will happen on Pape Avenue). 114 Queens Quay East buses will offer a connection to Union Station and replace 72B buses."
