        "text": "What is land transfer tax?Â\n\nLand transfer tax (LTT) is often overlooked when considering the total cost of purchasing a home, but it can be a considerably large closing cost. All provinces have a land transfer tax, except Alberta and Saskatchewan, who instead levy a much smaller transfer fee. In most provinces the tax is calculated as a percentage of property value, using asking price as a close estimate. Home buyers in Toronto, however, also incur an additional municipal tax.\n\nTo help offset the cost, Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and the City of Toronto offer land transfer tax rebates for first-time home buyers.\n\nHow to calculate land transfer tax\n\nLand transfer taxes are calculated based on the purchase price of your property. Each province sets its own land transfer tax rates, as do some municipalities. Use the calculator above to find the land transfer tax based on your location, or keep reading to find out how land transfer tax is calculated where you live.\n\nÂ\n\nOntario land transfer tax1\n\nOntario land transfer tax rates were last updated in 2017. This change introduced a $2 million tax bracket, but left the marginal rates and cutoffs for the lowest four price brackets unchanged. AÂ non-resident speculation taxÂ of 15% was also added for the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region.\n\nPurchase Price of Home Marginal Tax Rate First $55,000 0.5% $55,000.01 to $250,000.00 1.0% $250,000.01 to $400,000.00 1.5% $400,000.01 to $2,000,000.00 2.0% Over $2,000,000 2.5%\n\nTo see how land transfer tax is calculated on a home purchased in Ontario, watch the video below. Note that while this video was created before the $2 million bracket was introduced, the calculations are still correct.\n\nOntario first-time home buyer land transfer tax refund2\n\nThe Ontario land transfer tax refund is equal to the full value of the land transfer tax up to a maximum of $4,000.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe buyer must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada\n\nThe buyer must be older than 18 years\n\nThe buyer must occupy the home within nine months of purchase\n\nThe buyer cannot have owned a home anywhere in the world\n\nThe buyer's spouse cannot have owned a home while being your spouse\n\nBased on Ontario land transfer tax rates, the refund will cover the fully taxed amount on houses up to $368,000. For houses over $368,000, home buyers will receive the maximum $4,000 refund and have to pay the remaining LTT balance. To obtain this refund, you need to apply within 18 months after the purchase of the home.\n\nToronto land transfer tax3\n\nIf purchasing a home in Toronto, there is an additional municipal land transfer tax (MLTT). Torontoâs land transfer tax applies within the following boundaries: Steeles Avenue as the north border, Etobicoke as the west border, Scarborough as the east border and Lake Ontario as the south border.\n\nOn January 1, 2024, the City of Toronto introduced an additional threshold for its MLTT, for homes valued at $3 million and above, that contain a maximum of two single-family residences. The new levy starts at 3.5% of the homeâs value, and ranges up to 7.5% for homes valued at $20 million and above.\n\nPurchase Price of Home Marginal Tax Rate First $55,000 0.5% Â Â $55,000.01 to $250,000.00 1.0% Â Â Â $250,000.01 to $400,000.00 1.5% Â Â Â $400,000.01 to $2,000,000.00 2.0% Â Â Â Over $2,000,000 2.5% Â Â Â Over $3,000,000 and up to $4,000,000 3.5% Â Â Â Over $4,000,000 and up to $5,000,000 4.5% Â Â Â Over $5,000,000 and up to $10,000,000 5.5% Â Â Â Over $10,000,000 and up to $20,000,000 6.5% Â Â Â Over $20,000,000 7.5% Â Â Â\n\nRead: Land transfer rates to rise for some Toronto buyers in January\n\nToronto first-time home buyer land transfer tax rebate4\n\nFirst-time home buyers in Toronto of new and resale homes are eligible to receive a rebate up to a maximum of $4,475.\n\nEligibility\n\nThe buyer must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada\n\nThe buyer must be older than 18 years\n\nThe buyer must occupy the home within nine months of purchase\n\nThe buyer cannot have owned a home anywhere in the world\n\nThe buyer's spouse cannot have owned a home while being your spouse\n\nÂ\n\nBritish Columbia land transfer tax5\n\nLand transfer taxes in British Columbia are calculated in a similar way to Toronto, though with fewer property value brackets. BC also levies a much higher marginal tax rate on high-value residential homes.\n\nPurchase Price of Home Marginal Tax Rate First $200,000 1.0% On $200,001 to $2,000,000 2.0% Over $2,000,000 3.0% Over $3,000,000 A further 2% for residential properties (5% total)\n\nBritish Columbia first-time home buyer land transfer tax rebate6\n\nFirst-time home buyers are eligible to receive a full land transfer tax refund on homes purchased for up to $500,000. On homes purchased for between $500,000 - $525,000, the first-time home buyer will be eligible for a partial refund.\n\nEligibility\n\nYou can qualify for the first-time home buyer land transfer tax rebate if:\n\nYou are Canadian citizens or permanent residents as determined by Immigration Canada\n\nYou have lived in British Columbia for 12 consecutive months prior to the date the property is registered or have filed two income taxes in British Columbia in the six years before the property is registered\n\nYou have never owned an interest in a principal residence anywhere in the world at any time\n\nYou have never received a first-time home buyers' exemption or refund\n\nYour property qualifies for the first-time home buyer land transfer tax rebate if:\n\nThe fair market value of the property is less than $500,000\n\nThe land is (0.5) hectares or smaller\n\nThe property will only be used as your primary residence\n\nFor more information, see the Government ofÂ British Columbia website.\n\nÂ\n\nAlberta land title transfer fees7\n\nAlberta does not have a land transfer tax. However, it does charge a Transfer of Land registration fee AND a mortgage registration fee.\n\nTransfer of Land registration fee:Â This administration fee covers the actual name change of the land. There's a base fee of $50 plus an additional $2 charge for every $5,000 of the fair market value of the property (or part thereof).\n\nMortgage registration fee: This administration fee covers the issuance of your mortgage. There's a base fee of $50 plus an additional $1.50 charge for every $5,000 of the principal mortgage amount (or part thereof).\n\nÂ\n\nSaskatchewan land title transfer fees8\n\nThough Saskatchewan does not have a land transfer tax, they do have a land title fee. This fee is often paid by your lawyer when they are filling out the land title form on your behalf. For most properties, the Saskatchewan title transfer fee is 0.3% of the property's value.\n\nPurchase Price of Home Title Transfer Fee $0 - $500 $0 $501 - $8,400 $25 Over $8,401 0.30% of property value\n\nSaskatchewan also levies a $160 fee for the registration of a new mortgage.\n\nÂ\n\nManitoba land transfer tax9\n\nIn Manitoba, there is a progressive land transfer tax based on property price, along with a set title registration fee. Here are the current land transfer tax rates for Manitoba:\n\nProperty Value Marginal Tax Rate On the first $30,000 No tax $30,001 to $90,000 0.5% $90,001 to $150,000 1.0% $150,001 to $200,000 1.5% On amounts above $200,000 2.0%\n\nThere is no land transfer tax rebate for first-time home buyers in Manitoba.\n\nÂ\n\nQuebec land transfer tax10\n\nLand transfer tax in Quebec (known as \"taxe de bienvenue\" in French) is different outside of Montreal. The tax is collected and calculated at the municipal level. The base amount (i.e. the value of the property) used in the calculation is first determined to be the greater of:\n\nThe purchase price of the property\n\nThe amount listed on the Deed of Sale\n\nThe market value of the property determined by a municipal assessment roll increased by a comparative factor\n\nOnce the base amount is determined, land transfer tax in Quebec is then governed by the following scale:\n\nProperty Value Marginal Tax Rate Up to $51,700 0.5% $51,700 - $258,600 1.0% Over $258,600 1.5%\n\nÂ\n\nMontreal land transfer tax11\n\nThe calculation for land transfer tax in Montreal is a little different than the rest of Quebec.

For example, on a purchase of a house assessed to be worth $100,000, the tax payable is $1,000.\n\nÂ\n\nPrince Edward Island land transfer tax13\n\nIn Prince Edward Island (PEI), land transfer tax (otherwise referred to as Real Property Transfer Tax) is calculated as follows:\n\n1% of the greater of purchase price or property value\n\nIn cases where the property value is less than $30,000, no transfer tax is charged\n\nÂ\n\nPrince Edward Island first-time home buyer land transfer tax rebate14\n\nFirst-time home buyers who are purchasing in PEI are exempt from paying land transfer tax under the following circumstances:\n\nProperty value and purchase prices are below $200,000\n\nIndividuals are occupying home as primary residence\n\nAlso, if there is more than one purchaser, both purchasers must qualify as a first-time home buyer.\n\nÂ\n\nNova Scotia land transfer tax15\n\nEach municipality in Nova Scotia sets their own land transfer tax (also known as Deed Transfer Tax), which can vary from 0.5% to 1.5% of the purchase price. For homes in the Halifax area, the land transfer tax is 1.5%.\n\nFor land transfer tax rates outside of the Halifax area, please see the Nova Scotia land transfer tax tables on our Nova Scotia land transfer tax calculator page.Â\n\nÂ\n\nNorthwest Territories land transfer tax16\n\nIn the Northwest Territories, land transfer tax is calculated as a percentage of the property value and mortgage amount as follows:\n\n$1.50 for every $1,000 or part thereof of property value (subject to a minimum charge of $100)\n\n$1 for every $1,000 or part thereof of property value (for part of property value greater than $1,000,000)\n\n$1 for every $5,000 or part thereof of mortgage amount (subject to a minimum charge of $80)\n\nÂ\n\nNewfoundland Registration of Deeds Act17\n\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, the Registration of Deeds Act, also known as the land transfer tax, is levied on the property value or the mortgage amount as follows:\n\nFor properties or mortgages under $500, only a flat fee of $100 is charged\n\nFor properties exceeding $500, a flat fee of $100 is charged plus $0.40 for every hundred dollars over $500\n\nÂ\n\nYukon Territory Land Titles Act18\n\nFee #1: Assurance Fees\n\nThis fee is only applicable if your purchase price is greater than the value of the property at the time of its last transfer, in which case you would incur the following fees:\n\nâ¢ $20 for: First $10,000 of additional declared value\n\nâ¢ $10 for: Each additional $10,000 onwards of additional declared value\n\nFor example, if you recently purchased a property for $100,000 but its value at the time of the last transfer was $80,000, there will be an additional $20,000 of declared value. Therefore, your assurance fee will be $30 ($20 on the first $10,000 and $10 on the remaining $10,000).\n\nFee #2: Transfer Fees\n\nWhen purchasing a property, you will also need to pay a flat title transfer fee, which will depend on the purchase price of your property. See the rates below to find the fee that applies to the value of your property.\n\nProperty Value Flat Fee Less than $100,000 $50.00 $100,000 or more but less than $500,000 $150.00 $500,000 or more but less than $3,000,000 $350.00 $3,000,000 or more but less than $10,000,000 $550.00 $10,000,000 or more $750.00\n\nFee #3: Mortgage Fees\n\nThe flat fee you will pay on your mortgage depends on the value of the mortgage you take out.
