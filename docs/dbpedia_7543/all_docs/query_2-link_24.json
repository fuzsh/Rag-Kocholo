        "text": "These are large and diverse areas but here's how I'd describe them:\n\nNorth York is the most \"urban\" (though very much a suburb) in the sense that it has the most extensive downtown, cultural amenities and the like. More high rises and apartments. Also the most heterogeneous in it has more very rich people (York Mills), a lot of aspirational upper middle class immigrant areas (Willowdale/Bayview Village), though the western part (west of Dufferin) is more industrial/working class and there are a lot of low income housing areas as well (i.e. Flemingdon Park, Lawrence Heights). Very diverse - Chinese, Iranian, Korean in the middle and eastern areas, Jewish, Russian and Filipino in the middle, Italian, Caribbean and Latin American in the west. And not just working class immigrants but also well-to-do Asian immigrants.\n\nScarborough is the most \"working class\" of the three, with the cheapest housing to buy. The fringes of Scarborough are the \"newest\" areas of the city, closer in it's mostly postwar housing. Large Chinese population in the northwest (Agincourt), South Asians (esp. Tamils) and Blacks more spread out. Most greenspace of anywhere in Toronto (Rogue Park), has the Scarborough Bluffs. Though there are some expensive pockets near the lake, overall it has the fewest number of rich people. Less gap between rich and poor overall - North York has areas just as poor as Scarborough's poorest but Scarborough has a lot less upper middle class and very wealthy people.\n\nEtobicoke is the most \"middle class\" and the least diverse of the three, though there's a huge difference between Rexdale in the north (very South Asian, Caribbean and African) and the rest. The southern 2/3 is much whiter and either middle class or wealthy around Kingsway and Humber Valley. Few East Asian communities, though it does have more of an Eastern European presence. Has probably the most classic 50s suburbia feel of the three. Below the QEW is three pre-war \"streetcar\" suburbs of Mimico, New Toronto and Long Branch though Mimico is getting gentrified. Because these were industrial areas, the waterfront is less desirable than Scarborough's. Overall Etobicoke probably has more pre-1945 and pre-1960 housing stock.\n\nLast edited by King of Kensington; 08-01-2013 at 04:18 PM..\n\nI vote for North York\n\nWe've been living in the NYCC (Willowdale) area for over 6 months now and as TO newcomers, it has offered the perfect blend of urban/suburban living.\n\nSubway right at our door (3 stations within walking distance), a constant stream of TTC and Go buses, and quick access to most of the major highways if you need to drive. Less than 30 minutes gets you downtown on subway, 15-20 mins drive east to Scarborough, west to Mississauga, or north to Vaughan/Markham. Perfect central location.\n\nYonge Street has a variety of commercial/corporate/retail, and several ethnic and mainstream restaurants. There is a very diverse population and from what I can tell, the area is very safe and relatively low on crime.\n\nLots of parks and parkettes, and if you want a quiet walk you just have to head east or west of Yonge into any of the residential streets. If you prefer the action and crowd-surfing, stroll on Yonge.\n\nAlways stuff happening at Mel Lastman Square, from a weekly farmer's market to multicultural festivals. Skating in the winter. Plus an incredible library.\n\nAs for beauty, NYCC and Bayview areas are very nice looking, but once you go west of Yonge towards Bathurst and beyond, North York starts looking like a hellhole.\n\nI don't mind the Scarborough Town Centre area; have never seen the bluffs or much else as we haven't explored too much. Etobicoke seems very blue collar and has a gritty feel to it."
