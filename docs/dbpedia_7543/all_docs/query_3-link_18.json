        "text": "When it comes time for your parent to leave the hospital, their care team, which may include an Ontario Health atHome care coordinator, will determine if in-home or community supports are needed for a successful discharge. This may include services such as nursing, personal support, medication management, rehabilitation and many others. Visit our Home Care page and Community Care page to learn more.\n\nThe first step is to get in touch with us by calling 310-2222 (no area code required). A care coordinator will advise you about your options and support you as you make this important decision – which includes completing an assessment to help determine eligibility, guiding you through the application process and providing other valuable information. Visit our Long-Term Care page to learn more.\n\nOnce you have been assessed as eligible for our services, a care coordinator will work with you to determine which services would best support your health and well-being – at home or in the community. Visit our Care Coordination page to learn more about the important role care coordinators play in Ontario’s health care system. You can also visit our Home Care page for more information about services.\n\nWhile we don’t typically provide general housekeeping services, we can help you locate these services in your community. There are many options for private-pay or subsidized services that you may qualify for. To learn more about how to find services available in your community, visit our Information & Referral page.\n\nYour voice, your care, wherever you call home: Help shape home and community care.\n\nCommunity engagement is an essential function and core value of Ontario Health atHome and is a crucial component to delivering high-quality care, reflective of the needs of those we serve.\n\nOur Mission, Vision and Values provide a foundation for who we are and what we do as united organizations. We have created a Mission, Vision and Values that articulates our purpose and the value we bring to the health care system.\n\nAre you passionate about exceptional health care and driven by a desire to help others? If you’re interested in driving excellence in care and service delivery, and seeking an unparalleled opportunity to lead and learn, partner and connect, care and be cared for, this is your home.\n\nCheck out the job opportunities that await!"
