I think this is the way these addresses still work across the board with the government.\n\nEtobicoke, Scarborough, North York will be relevant cities instead of Toronto.\n\ne.g.\n\nhttps://www.postalcodesincanada.com/place-etobicoke-3520/?page=416#google_vignette\n\nSee the mailing address of Costco and Walmart stores in Scarborough and Etobicoke\n\nhttps://www.costco.ca/warehouse-locations/scarborough-on-537.html\n\nhttps://www.walmart.ca/en/stores-near-me/etobicoke-supercentre-3031\n\nYes you're right Canada Post uses these suburbs for cities in all its addresses. Any I guess this way has worked out well for most applicants.\n\nThough if you look at official Ontario cities list, these places do not figure as cities anywhere. In fact they are all part of Toronto.\n\nYes you're right Canada Post uses these suburbs for cities in all its addresses.

In fact they are all part of Toronto.\n\nThe question is about the city you lived in.\n\nEtobicoke, Scarborough, North York are part of Toronto.\n\nMy suggestion will be for you to mention Etobicoke, Scarborough, North York instead of Toronto in that field.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area\n\nThe question is about the city you lived in.\n\nEtobicoke, Scarborough, North York are part of Toronto.\n\nMy suggestion will be for you to mention Etobicoke, Scarborough, North York instead of Toronto in that field.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area\n\nThank you for the suggestion. I think I will take it.\n\nHowever if you look at the wikipedia page you've shared, there is no mention of North York or Etobicoke, even in the municipalities of GTA list. Only Toronto is listed. That said, Canada Post considers Etobicoke as a distinct 'region' separate from Toronto and I guess that is what we can go by.\n\nA quick look through the Ontario list here: https://www.ontario.ca/page/list-ontario-municipalities\n\nAnd MTO list here, makes it clear that places like Scarborough, North York and Etobicoke are not listed as separate cities: http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/official-road-map/alphabetical-list.shtml#e-table\n\nSo for these to be listed on the citizenship form is not exactly accurate. But most probably workable because of how Canada Post uses these addresses.\n\nThank you for the suggestion.

After all when they ask the Name of the 'City' - You want to be correct about that. They've asked the City name not only in the address, but also where you sign the declaration, on the application. This is critical information one is self-providing. Putting a name in the city box, for a place, that isn't even a city is not accurate. But unfortunately Canada Post still uses these place names. And that's confusing.\n\nThanks for your inputs!\n\nMy guarantor and I also simply used the community name up to my passport application, where they signed the declaration. Zero issues.\n\nI agree, you're getting wound up over nothing.\n\nGood to to hear that this way works and that we are fine just inputting the community name - like North York. That’s all I needed confirmation on really.\n\nThanks for your insights\n\nHi friends!\n\nThe address fields on the application look like this:\n\nhttps://ibb.co/Zxxqjn6\n\nSo if your address is in Scarborough, North York or Etobicoke (none of which are designated cities in Ontario and all of these are a part of the City of Toronto), what would you ideally mention on the application under the box for City/Town?\n\nConsider these sample addresses of stores in these areas:\n\n50 QUEEN ELIZABETH BLVD\n\nETOBICOKE, ON M8Z 1M1\n\n3750 Lawrence Avenue East,\n\nScarborough, ON M1G 1R1\n\n1080 KENTON DR\n\nNORTH YORK ON M2R 2H7\n\nHow would one mention any of these addresses on the application?

The reason is - My Rent Lease and Energy Bills - have Toronto for the address and not Etobicoke. However all my banking, service ca, and cra correspondence has been on Etobicoke. Which do you think I should use for the 'City' on the application?"
