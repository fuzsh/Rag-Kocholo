        "text": "As I was writing this, I was thinking “O Canada…“, swiftly followed by the realisation that I don’t know any of the rest of the words, anyhoo, I totally digress, especially as I want to share some of the best things to do in Toronto.\n\nWith Canada, most people’s thoughts tend to go for the more natural attractions (case in point – this beauty) with relatively little consideration going to its cities yet Canada is home to some of the most exciting and vibrant cities in all the land. This is especially true when it comes to the best things to do in Toronto.\n\nFor some reason, Toronto always feels like a ‘Canadian New York’ if that makes sense?\n\nOntario’s capital city is definitely a fantastic place to visit, especially with all the best things to do in Toronto. Located right on Lake Ontario, the city is a multicultural hub, with lots to see and do.\n\nThis is why I wanted to share some of the very best things to do in Toronto on your next trip. You’ll have the best time.\n\n1.) Brave the glass floor in the CN Tower\n\nSince the CN Tower is probably going to be the first thing you notice upon arriving in Toronto, it might as well be the first thing to actually go visit.\n\nThe views from this communications tower will not disappoint and it’s easily up there as one of the best things to do in Toronto. Standing 1,815 feet (553 m) tall, visitors are able to see Toronto and the entire surrounding area from the LookOut Level of the tower.\n\nThere is also a Glass Floor for visitors to brave walk upon, and for the tallest viewing point, head to the SkyPod, which offers views from a height of 1,465 feet (447 m). Feeling a little dizzy yet?\n\nRead more: Getting the best views at the CN Tower\n\n2.) Admire the Hockey Hall of Fame\n\nSince hockey is the national sport of Canada, you better believe that anything related to the sport in Toronto is going to be impressive.\n\nSituated in Old Toronto, the Hockey Hall of Fame is great for all things hockey. It houses a large collection of hockey memorabilia, and visitors can even play one-on-one against life-sized, animated versions of some of the greatest professional players in the sport.\n\nIf hockey is your game, then the Hall of Fame is for you. That being said, if you’re not into hockey you might wanna knock this off your list of the best things to do in Toronto… you’ll find it pretty boring otherwise.\n\nRead more: Best restaurants to visit in Toronto\n\n3.) See the Royal Ontario Museum\n\nFor something a little (ok…a lot!) less rough than ice hockey, head to the Royal Ontario Museum. Perfect for lovers of world culture, as well as natural history, the Museum offers the largest collection of pieces and artefacts in Canada.\n\nThe museum is open daily from 10AM-5: 30 PM, with late closing on Fridays at 8:30 PM. It really is one of the best things to do in Toronto, especially if the weather takes a chill and you want to get out of the cold.\n\n4.) Visit Casa Loma\n\nA castle…in Toronto? It’s true! Built between 1911-1914, the city’s Casa Loma was originally a massive residence for a financier named Sir Henry Mill Pellatt.\n\nToday, this Gothic Revival style castle is home to a museum, as well as a garden and stables area. 98 rooms, secret passageways, and a few towers await the visitors of Toronto’s Casa Loma.\n\nRead more: What to see in Casa Loma\n\n5.) Wander through the Eaton Centre\n\nShopaholics, rejoice!\n\nToronto has a stunning mall for you to peruse, complete with a stunning glass ceiling. Eaton Centre, located right between downtown and Old Toronto, is a massive, multi-level shopping centre, with both high street brands, as well as more local shops.\n\nBe sure to check out the St. Lawrence Market that is situated approximately 15 minutes walk from the Eaton Centre for the best, fresh produce and some gorgeous antiques. Honestly, it’s one of the best things to do in Toronto if you love to shop.\n\n6.) Dive into Kensington Market\n\nFor even more shopping, head to one of the best-known neighbourhoods in the city. Distinctly multicultural, Kensington Market is perfect for vintage shopping, viewing some street art, and finding über-cool hipster coffee shops in the city.\n\nA unique mix of styles and cultures, Kensington Market has recently become recognised as a National Historic Site of Canada. (A good enough excuse reason to visit really…;-) )\n\nRead more: Best places to stay in the centre of Toronto\n\n7.) Scream in Canada’s Wonderland\n\nAny place called ‘Wonderland’ is definitely worth checking out, especially if that place has roller coasters! Canada’s Wonderland is arguably the best amusement park in the country. Located about 25 miles (40 km) north of downtown, Wonderland is actually in Vaughn but is close enough to Toronto’s city centre (and soooooooo much fun!) that you need to pop in when you visit Toronto.\n\nThe amusement park is perfect for visitors in the summertime (understandably) but if you happen to visit Toronto around Halloween, though, Canada’s Wonderland Halloween Haunt is absolutely the place you need to go to.\n\nHonestly, if you’re a thrill seeker, you’ll find Wonderland one of the best things to do in Toronto… well, just outside.\n\n8.) Explore the Distillery District\n\nWhat was once the Gooderham & Worts Distillery was later left to be an abandoned area of Victorian industrial buildings. That is until a few developers came up with the idea to turn the old distillery into a super stunning shopping and dining area!\n\nWith what seems like the love-child of European’s charming yet quaint streets and the more modern trendy atmosphere of New York City’s SoHo neighbourhood, the Distillery District is the perfect place to peruse over 80 different shops and boutiques, as well as try a multitude of different restaurants.\n\nEffectively, its one of the best spots to begin your night out on the town and it has quickly become one of the most popular places and the best things to do in Toronto.\n\nRead more: Visiting the Distillery District\n\n9.) Walk the Toronto Waterfront\n\nTo take in some of the most beautiful sights in the city, head for the waterfront. Stretching from the Rouge River in the east to the Etobicoke Creek in the west, the waterfront allows for 28 miles (46 km) of walking along Lake Ontario.\n\nDon’t expect to just walk aimlessly forever, though; there’s quite a bit to see and do on the waterfront! Between June – October, stop by the Waterfront Artisan Market for delicious food and speciality crafts.\n\nOr, maybe you’d prefer to take a beach break on one of the many beaches along the way. Whatever your interests are, you’re sure to have a grand time along the waterfront.\n\n10.) Take a trip to Niagara Falls\n\nTechnically, Niagara Falls is not right in the city of Toronto. If you’ve come all the way to Toronto though, you might as well make a side trip to one of the greatest natural wonders in the world.\n\nJust 90 minutes driving from Toronto will bring you to the Falls, where you can easily spend the day taking in the sights as well as exploring the surrounding area.\n\nHere you can take a walking tour behind the falls, where you can get close enough to them to even get soaked by them (don’t worry, you’ll be handed a poncho prior to avoid you getting properly soaked) or hop aboard a boat ride to get a very different a very powerful perspective of the waterfall.\n\nBe sure to stay until it gets dark when the Falls are lit up in beautiful colours every night of the year.\n\nRead more on how to see Niagara Falls\n\nThis Is Definitely An Amazing Way To Experience Niagara Falls!\n\nCheck Out The Very Best Of Great Britain!"
