        "text": "“I think our teams just really love being able to roll up their sleeves, and do something as a group.”\n\nCisco – Employee Volunteer Group\n\n“It was the cause that got me here in the first place. But why I stay is in large part the people who work and volunteer here. It’s just a really, really special place.”\n\nLorie – Volunteer\n\n“Volunteering at Daily Bread Food Bank has helped me to realize the impact of inflation on the community. People around me are having a hard time making ends meet, sacrificing food for rent and other essentials.”\n\nNiah – Volunteer\n\n“Food insecurity is on the rise due to increases in rent and school fees. You have to pay for rent, you have to pay school fees. But because you can control how much you are spending on food, if you have to cut something, food is the first to go.” Lauren Barch, Student Operational Lead at the GFC.\n\nToronto Metropolitan Food Bank\n\n“The volunteers in the Information and Referral Centre have always been very helpful. They have helped us to get new prescriptions, and even helped us get new mattresses.”\n\nMyrna – Food Bank Client\n\n“The food bank helped us get established in Canada. My family now has enough for themselves; they own a house and have a mortgage. They could not have got there without the help they received from the food bank.”\n\nMaham – Food Bank Client\n\n.\n\n“It’s so rewarding to be able to give and build a sense of community in this way.”\n\nBetty Anne – Volunteer\n\n“Life is about helping other people whenever we can. We want to help people meet their basic needs when this is increasingly difficult. Until there is a guaranteed annual income in Canada, a growing number of Canadians will be unable to afford the two most basic necessities in life, food and housing.”\n\nTyler – Donor – Legacy Giving\n\n“The first time I came to the food bank was a new experience,. “I’d never had to rely on these services before and I thought it would be a difficult experience. But the staff were very welcoming and friendly, and they didn’t make me feel like it was something to be embarrassed about.”\n\nMaria – Food Bank Client\n\n“I don’t know how I would survive without the food bank, especially with the rising cost of groceries. I need a balanced diet to help with my health issues, at the food bank I can get fruits and vegetables and even some protein like meat and lentils – they have a good selection.\n\nElena – Food Bank Client\n\n“Because of the food bank, I don’t need to worry about going hungry or having to choose between food and my medications. My wife and I have a much happier life.”\n\nGordon – Food Bank Client\n\nA team of more than 80 employees from Kellogg Canada filled our warehouse for a morning of volunteer activities as part of Kellogg’s annual “Day of Caring” initiative. “At Kellogg, we have a deep commitment to advancing sustainable and equitable access to food for all.”\n\nKellogg Canada – Employee Volunteer Group"
