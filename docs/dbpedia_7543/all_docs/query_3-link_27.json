        "text": "The capital of Ontario, Toronto is a melting pot of cultures and the financial hub of Canada. The sprawling metropolis is home to soaring skyscrapers and high-rises, forming a skyline that’s filled in for cities like New York and Chicago in countless movies and TV shows.\n\nToronto’s iconic skyline is dominated by the 553-metre-tall CN Tower, once the tallest building in the world. The urban jungle is also home to a Gothic Revival castle – the stately Casa Loma featuring a museum, secret passageways and acres of immaculate gardens. Once you’ve had a glimpse of the cityscape, you can truly soak up the culture with a feast at the historic St. Lawrence Market in the Old Town, or a stroll through the eclectic Distillery District, characterised by Victorian architecture, cobblestone streets and trendy art galleries, boutiques and bars.\n\nCanada lives and breathes hockey, and for an introduction to the national sport, you can head to the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. If it’s art and culture you’re after, the Royal Ontario Museum is the country’s largest, boasting 13 million items spanning centuries and civilisations – from dinosaur fossils to Egyptian mummies. Also worth a visit is the Art Gallery of Ontario, redesigned by architecture luminary Frank Gehry, who calls the city home.\n\n2.0\n\nI booked 6 rooms for a conference 12-14 August 2024.\n\nI booked 6 rooms for a conference 12-14 August 2024. But on 9th August, I requested cancellation of one room. The cancellon date was still within the 'ni cancellation fee' allowabke date. On checking my bank acciunt I found that Booking.com deducted from my bank account the full amount for six rooms! 2. The rooms were not serviced well. My room 2110 did not have tea or coffee. It was not cleaned the next day ie in 13th August. In one room there was just a diuble for 2 of my delegates. When requested a change of room, that was denied. 3. The hotel reception and event management team was very rude and unprofessional in supporting the delegates for my cinference. Ontario meeting room was booked for 13th August from 2pm tile 7pm). But it was not prepared as requested. No coffe or tea or courtesy biscuits were supplied. When requested, the event management staff was rude and uncourteous.\n\nHasanat United Kingdom\n\n10\n\nToronto is a city that surprises with its ease of...\n\nToronto is a city that surprises with its ease of transportation, as well as the opportunities for activities it offers. It’s a city to visit without a car, as the traffic is very complicated, considered one of the worst in the world. We went in the summer, which allowed us to walk a lot around the city and even use the transportation network, which is very easy and practical to use. The dining options are very varied, catering to all tastes. The museums, concert halls, and attractions are another strong point.\n\nJose Sebastiao Brazil\n\n10\n\nI travel to Toronto a lot and this was by far the best stay...\n\nI travel to Toronto a lot and this was by far the best stay I've had in a hotel! My train arrived early so the front desk kindly took my luggage as I explored the excellent location close to downtown and 2 minutes walking distance from the college subway station. Excellent restaurants, a grocery store, movie theatre and a liquor store are a short walk up the street. After my walk I was granted early check-in and despite getting a great deal on a basic room (2 double beds) they upgraded me to a King Size bed without me asking! Staff were professional and courteous, outdoor rooftop lounge was amazing, pool was large and clean, restaurant was great and room was comfortable and quiet. I'm a Holiday Inn guy now! Amazing experience!\n\nAnonymous\n\n10\n\nToronto has so much to do.\n\nToronto has so much to do. It’s asthetically beautiful and has some pretty amazing architectural structures. Most people are friendly to us and there’s something for everyone . I didn’t like the traffic nor the speeding impatient drivers. Where I’m from those type of drivers are the exception but in Toronto it seems they set the rules. Toronto is beautiful period and interesting. Maybe I’m just from a slower paced city lol. I would come again and again and never get bored of it. We Love the cultural diversity!!!! Our favorite places so far , Moxie’s, The Rec Room, the Food Court, Ripley’s Aquarium, the Illuminarium, The Game Spot, the Yuan Ming Market and Scaddabush!!\n\nWilliams"
