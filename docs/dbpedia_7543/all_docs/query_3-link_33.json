We are happy that you're here, and we look forward to getting to know you and helping you reach your smile goals.\n\nOnline Forms For Your Convenience\n\nIf you haven't been able to fill out your initial paperwork online or ahead of time, you may want to arrive a few minutes early to do so in our dental office. You can also download forms from this website to work on at your convenience.\n\nThorough Dental Exam\n\nThen you will spend some time visiting with our hygienist for x-rays, photos, and an initial examination before one of our dentists comes in to meet you. They will perform a thorough exam and review your information to discuss your goals and any treatment recommendations that may be necessary.\n\nIf time allows, healthy patients may be able to complete their teeth cleaning at this appointment.\n\nPatients suffering from gum disease may need deeper or additional teeth cleanings to help manage their condition. Dr. Joo has completed extensive training that allows him to offer the full range of treatment for gum disease here at our Etobicoke dental office, including gum grafting surgery.\n\nContact Our Etobicoke Dental Clinic\n\nIf you're looking for a dentist in Etobicoke or near Long Branch that you can trust to have your best interests in mind, we can't wait to welcome you to Toronto Lakeshore Dental!"
