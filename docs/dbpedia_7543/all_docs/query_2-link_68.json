        "text": "Update\n\nThe Etobicoke Greenway Project was subject to the Class Environmental Assessment for Minor Transmission Facilities (2022), in accordance with the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act. The Class EA is a streamlined planning process ensuring that applicable projects are planned and carried out in a manner that is efficient and environmentally acceptable. Hydro One began a Class EA June 08, 2022, which was completed and submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks on June 2, 2023.

To read the appendices, click here.\n\nPlanning Process\n\nMinimizing the impact of our projects and operations on the environment and community is important to us. Planning will follow the “Class Environmental Assessment for Minor Transmission Facilities” (Class EA, 2022), in accordance with the Ontario Environmental Assessment Act. This planning process applies to transmission infrastructure projects that are carried out routinely and have predictable environmental effects that can be readily managed.\n\nFollowing completion of the Class EA, approval from the Ontario Energy Board under Section 92 (Leave to Construct) of the Ontario Energy Board Act will be required. The in-service date for this project is anticipated for 2026. Class Environmental Assessment for Minor Transmission Facilities.\n\nReimagining the Corridor\n\nHydro One is committed to investing in the corridor so it can be enjoyed by the community once the project is complete. We have developed a preliminary design concept that balances public input with Hydro One’s technical and safety considerations. The concept features 4.5 km of trails with meadows, pollinator plantings, trail amenities and five frequently mown spaces for recreational activities within the 70-hectare greenspace.\n\nPreliminary concept map"
