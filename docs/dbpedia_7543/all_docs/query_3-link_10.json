I don't think anyone likes \"Toronto Unlimited\".\n\nI would say that the biggest issue is that both the city and even more so the province don't want to look like they're playing favourites. When I worked for the province's tourism policy department there was as much or more focus on SW Ontario than Niagara or Toronto. And the second you tried to focus on one of those two, you'd get some complaining from SWO or some other Ontario region.\n\nAt the municipal level, I worked for the InfoTOgo program and we were always telling people to see the neighbourhoods, or at least make an evening of one of them. You never know how successful you are at this because unless they come back and tell you they enjoyed it, you won't know if they followed your advice. However, the city's attempts to not play favourites meant that some days we were sent to some event in north west Etobicoke instead of something big downtown.\n\nEssentially the problem with selling neighbourhoods is that you wind up playing favourites. Which neighbourhood do we sell without making it generic?\n\nOh I agree.

Which neighbourhood do we sell without making it generic?\n\nWell, I suppose you don't really have to play favourites. You can start with the more popular ones then move on to others. A lot of neighbourhoods are so close together visitors are going to visist more than one.\n\nBesides, advertising neighbourhoods isn't about getting tourists to those specific neighbourhoods, but advertising the city as a whole and giving them an idea of what it's about.\n\nWell, I suppose you don't really have to play favourites. You can start with the more popular ones then move on to others.\n\nBut that's playing favourites. People with a vested interest in having tourists visit these neighbourhoods don't understand the concept of \"you're next on the list.\" How skeptical would you be if you were told that we're going to do an ad campaign for St Lawrence, Distillery and Yonge/Dundas first and then we'll get to your neighbourhood after that? It'd be tough to believe.\n\nBesides, advertising neighbourhoods isn't about getting tourists to those specific neighbourhoods, but advertising the city as a whole and giving them an idea of what it's about.\n\nBut the only way to sell the city from a tourism perspective is through landmarks. Otherwise the image of people enjoying themselves on the street could be anywhere. Ya, we'd know its the Annex, but it very well could be a street in Montreal or Boston to a tourist. You need to differentiate yourself, and there's no way you can do that by showing anything but landmarks that people recognize."
