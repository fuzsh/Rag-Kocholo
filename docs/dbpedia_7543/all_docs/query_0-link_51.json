In 1998 it amalgamated with the cities of North York, Toronto, Scarborough, York, and Etobicoke to become the City of Toronto. A planned industrial and residential urban complex, East York was established in 1967, through the amalgamation of East York Township (created in 1924 from York Township) and the town of Leaside (settled by James Lea in 1819 and incorporated in 1913). The two communities were first linked in 1927 by a viaduct over the Don River. Area 8 square miles (21 square km)."
