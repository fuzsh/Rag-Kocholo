The Parade, lead by Pride Toronto’s first International Grand Marshal, highlighted the issues of inequality faced by our brothers and sisters worldwide and honoured the heroes of Toronto’s own queer community past and present. The second annual Pride Toronto Gala and Awards grew into a major community event this year, with a diverse group of award winners from all parts of the queer community in attendance.\n\nGrand Marshals Donald Middleton & Clayton Wilson and Robert Berry & Les Sheare are two couples that have been together for a combined 100 years.

In an age where the increasing trend in World Religions is towards discriminatory fundamentalism, more and more people reject Religion because they see it as an agent of their oppression. It is crucially important that there be growing, vibrant congregations like MCC Toronto.\n\nThe theme for Pride Week 2003 was: Pride 3D: “Diverse • Defiant • Divine.”\n\nGrand Marshal John Fisher, Executive Director of Egale Canada, was recognized for his hard work and dedication to issues of justice and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and transgender people across the country. In his eighth and final year at the helm of Egale, he was also appreciated for his part in building up this, Canada’s first national queer rights organization.\n\nHonoured Group T.E.A.C.H.

Entering it’s 10th year, T.E.A.C.H. has worked hard to address systemic oppression and eradicate the teasing and violence often experienced by LGBTQ youth.\n\n“Heroic Past, Proud Future” – a time to look back on all that LGBT communities have accomplished and gird our loins for battles yet to be won. Heroes Sky Gilbert and Michelle Douglas join the parade as Grand Marshals.\n\nSeptember 2000, Pussy Palace Raid – The Pussy Palace Raid so called because the women’s event that night was Named “The Pussy Palace”. The raid and charges brought against the Pussy Palace organizers were condemned by the LGBTQ community. On Oct. 28th, the Pussy Palace Panty Picked Protest was held in front of police headquarter, 52 Division. Protesters waved panties and boxer briefs as well as posters with slogans – “No more raids,” “Peeping@Panties” “Sluts can’t be shamed” and “Fuck you, 52” (slogan used in protests established through Black & Caribbean LGBTQ communities).\n\nOn January 31, 2002 Judge Peter Hryn declared that the five male officers violated the Constitutional rights of the women attending the Pussy Palace event. It was his opinion that women were entitled to a safe place to explore their sexuality without the imposition of men. He went on to compare the raid to a strip search, and that it was “one of the clearest cases” of inappropriate law enforcement. All charges were dropped, the Police were forced to pay $350,000.00 and issue an apology from the officers who conducted the raid and a commitment from the force to beef up sensitivity training for its 7,260 members.\n\nOn February 5, Metro Toronto Police raid various bathhouses – known as “Operation Soap”, arresting 306 men, in the largest Canadian mass arrest except for the October 1970 FLQ crisis. Again, extensive property damage is inflicted by police. For added public humiliation, the “found-ins” are herded into the streets in towels to be processed. The names of those arrested are publicized by the police and local media, destroying several lives.\n\nA major demonstration is held at Yonge and Wellesley the next day by hundreds of Toronto queers and their supporters, closing down the street. Activists start working, and the group Gays and Lesbians Against the Right is formed. Future mayor Barbara Hall is among the legal counsel defending those arrested.\n\nLesbian and Gay Pride Day Toronto is legally incorporated. 1,500 celebrate Pride Day on Sunday, June 28th, at Grange Park. In spite of the politically charged atmosphere that year, the day is billed as a time to relax, celebrate, and as “an afternoon of fun and frolic.”"
