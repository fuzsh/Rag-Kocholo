        "text": "City staff are looking to scrap Etobicoke's official coat of arms on the grounds that it perpetuates anti-Indigenous stereotypes, CBC Toronto has learned.\n\nThe emblem includes an Indigenous figure kneeling above a banner that reads \"tradition,\" facing a European explorer, who's kneeling above the word \"progress.\"\n\n\"Concerns were raised by city staff and members of the public about the outdated, stereotypical imagery of an Indigenous person that can be considered cultural appropriation,\" city spokesperson Russell Baker said in an email to CBC Toronto.\n\n\"Engagement with several city divisions, including the Indigenous Affairs Office and People & Equity...determined that the coat of arms does not reflect the city's values of reconciliation and inclusion.\"\n\nEtobicoke's coat of arms controversy began in 2019 when several members of the community suggested to city staff and politicians that the Indigenous figure was drawn in a way that could be considered a racist caricature, according to Coun. Stephen Holyday, chair of the Etobicoke York community council.\n\nThe issue wasn't pursued by staff or politicians then, he said. But recently there have been renewed complaints from staff at the Etobicoke Civic Centre and members of the public that prompted staff to re-examine the issue, Holyday said.\n\nToronto City Manager Paul Johnson responded by opting to have the coat of arms removed from two prominent spots â€” in the centre of the council chamber at the civic centre and from a window above the door to an adjacent meeting room.\n\n\"The city acknowledges the harm and pain this imagery may have caused to staff and Indigenous community members,\" Baker said in his email. \"Removing the coat of arms from this location will contribute to creating a safe and inclusive space for members of the public and city employees, which is a top priority.\"\n\nBut Holyday, who represents Etobicoke Centre on city council, has countered with a motion to be presented at the Nov. 8 council meeting, calling for a pause in the city manager's plan until staff can report to council on the origins and meaning of the coat of arms.\n\nHis motion calls for that report to be presented to council by the end of the year.\n\n\"There's deeper meaning here,\" Holyday said. \"And the meaning that I don't want to lose is an earnest effort by the city of Etobicoke back in 1977 to recognize the Indigenous history on this land.\"\n\nChief Stacey Laforme of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation was one of those who raised concerns about the coat of arms in 2019. He told CBC Toronto on Oct. 27 that he finds the language on the coat of arms and the imagery disturbing.\n\nBut he said he'd like to see a public discussion about the issue before any decisions are made about its future.\n\n\"I think we should sit down and have a conversation and see if there's something we want to do together to change it, to make it more acceptable,\" he said.\n\nBaker says in his email that the coat of arms only exists in the two prominent spots a the civic centre. He also says the coat of arms was only relevant from 1977, when it was created by the old Borough of Etobicoke council, until 1998, when Etobicoke was absorbed, along with the other four adjacent municipalities, into the City of Toronto.\n\nHolyday challenges both those ideas.\n\nHe says the coat of arms exists in \"thousands\" of places, including the letterhead on many of the municipality's older documents. He also says it's found within the Kipling subway station and even on the Toronto mayor's chain of office.\n\nCBC Toronto has requested comment from Mayor Olivia Chow's office. This story will be updated if a response is received.\n\n\"The coat of arms was used on the official seal of the former City of Etobicoke and has been used extensively from 1977 until amalgamation in 1998, both in physical form and on numerous documents and mediums,\" Holyday's motion states. \"It is recognized and highly regarded by many.\"\n\nCity staff say no date has yet been set for the removal of the coat of arms."
