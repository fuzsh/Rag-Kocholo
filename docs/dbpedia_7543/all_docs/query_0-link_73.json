McVean Road became Rexdale Boulevard.\n\n42\n\nThanks for the corrections, interchange42.\n\nHere's a store list of Rexdale Plaza from 1982. 10 years after being enclosed.\n\nPhoto credit: Adrian Caprara\n\nBargain Harold's - if I remember correctly, was located on the lower level (Dominion end of the plaza).\n\nBaskin Robbins - Up until now, I never knew Rexdale Plaza had a name-brand fast food chain in the plaza.\n\nDominion - One of Rexdale Plaza's first major anchors. Lasted for several years after.\n\nMusic World - Another surprise to me that I don't remember seeing in the early 1990's. Shoppers World Albion\n\nalso had a Music World in the 1980's as well.\n\nRexdale Restaurant and Tavern - I've read that the owners of Rexdale Tavern converted this establishment into\n\nCatalina Grille.\n\nRexdale Snackbar - A long-standing kiosk that was best known for it's delicious fries and gravy. Remained with\n\nRexdale Plaza for another two decades prior to the mall's second demolition.\n\nShoppers Drug Mart - Some of my last memories of Rexdale Plaza involved visiting this location prior to the mall's\n\ndemolition. Next to Dollarama, Shoppers Drug Mart was the only name brand store left in the mall.\n\nTowers Department Store - Converted into Zellers in the years to follow. Now an amalgamation of different stores.\n\nWoolco - Another fixture that lasted for quite some time. Used to be located near Towers.\n\nHere's an exterior shot of Rexdale Plaza before the mall was demolished. Any idea on date?\n\nFrom the halcyon days of yore, here's some vintage ads promoting Coles at the Rexdale Plaza:\n\nBesides books, Coles also sold hobby supplies. Rexdale Plaza is mentioned directly above this text.\n\nI wonder how many of these comics would be worth something today? Original Action comics from the early 1900's can\n\ncommand a small fortune.\n\nBoth clippings come courtesy of Eugenio Arcilesi.\n\nLastly, the showstopper for this post:\n\nPhoto credit Vicky Duclos and submitted by Eugenio Arcilesi. Eugenio writes:\n\n\"Hi everyone, here's a beautiful photo that I call a \"room with a view\" showing a crisp cold day back in the winter of 1962-63.. this photo was taken at 11 Bergamot ave on the 7th floor looking southeast showing the intersection of Rexdale blvd at islington ave. In the background you can see Rexdale Plaza and to the left of photo the red building is the Red Barn, notice even back then the children were social distancing. Photo courtesy of Vicky Duclos, enjoy!\"\n\nAnother popular store name that comes up when referencing the heyday of the Rexdale Plaza is the Rexdale Hobby Centre:\n\nThe next submission comes from Bonnie Hogan. A 1967 cookbook that contains vintage clippings of stores from Rexdale Plaza, Albion Mall and a few other nearby shops. Bonnie writes:\n\n\"Centennial cookbook from St Paul the Apostle church on Kipling which I attended from when it was built in the late 1950’s until I got married there in 1972. I included some advertising pages. Did anybody else go to this church?\"\n\nAttachments\n\n188274657_593439105383123_7599668447962194176_n.jpg\n\nFor lovers of vintage cars, this early Rexdale Plaza advertising piece & contest might be of interest:\n\nPhoto uploaded by: Brian Cole\n\nI believe the sign above the Ford Crown Victoria reads \"Win This NEW Ford at REXDALE PLAZA\".\n\nIn the comments section, some have speculated that the photo was taken in 1954 or 1955 after Labour Day. Though, the Rexdale Plaza wasn't\n\nbuilt until 1956. All in all, a pretty convincing means to get shoppers to visit the newly-created Rexdale Plaza.\n\nNow, for those of you who visited Rexdale Plaza in the 1970's - 1980's, you may remember this piece of currency at Towers Department Store:\n\nPhoto credit: Doug North\n\nTowers' own version of Canadian Tire money.\n\nPhoto credit: Eugenio Arcilesi\n\nHere's a Towers ad from the 1970's.\n\nPhoto credit: Eugenio Arcilesi\n\nNot too far from the Rexdale Plaza was Valdi Discount Foods (located in the Rexdale Mews across from Sears)\n\nThe above photo was taken in 1980.\n\nI can spot Aylmer brand Tomato Catsup, stacks of Colgate Toothpaste and Carasse baby lotion/shampoo.\n\nStill on the lookout for inside mall shots from the 70's, 80's and 90's. Though, on tonight's search I came across this vintage clipping\n\n(Rexdale Plaza is mentioned in the bottom corner as one of the locations):\n\nPhoto submitted by Hopkin Design.\n\nNo idea on the year. I wonder if I'd qualify for a \"free rose\" (see middle-left of above ad) with my long hair?\n\nGet on your Dazy Dukes for this next advertising piece. A Dukes of Hazard and Rexdale Plaza tie-in from 1983!\n\nPhoto credit: Adrian Caprara\n\nRexdale Plaza had it all in 1983...except for a movie theatre. Which, the neighbouring Albion Centre had established (Albion Cinemas)\n\nsince the early 1970's and the forthcoming Woodbine Centre would add in two years time.\n\nPrior to Rexdale Mall's second demolition in 2003, I remember the indoor flea markets every weekend. Though, by that point, there\n\nwasn't a 25 cent admission fee."
