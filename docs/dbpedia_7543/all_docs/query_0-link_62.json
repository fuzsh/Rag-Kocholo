        "text": "Off to the very southwest of Toronto for the neighbourhood and former village of Long Branch. Long Branch, along with New Toronto and Mimico, is one of the former municipalities in the south of Etobicoke. These Lakeshore municipalities (being centred on Lakeshore Blvd W), all have managed to maintain their characters in spite of the onslaught of suburban sprawl. Even though they formed much earlier than the rest of Etobicoke, had they simply been swallowed by the surrounding development, they wouldn’t be the first towns to be absorbed into suburbia. Fortunately they did not, and we are left with some interesting neighbourhoods to explore.\n\nCol. Sam Smith, one of Etobicoke’s first settlers, owned the land that is currently Long Branch (as well as parts of New Toronto). This land was bought by the Eastwood family in 1871, and a portion sold again in the 1880s to form Sea Breeze Park, a summer resort, as well as a subdivision. When ownership changed in 1886, it was renamed Long Branch Park. The Long Branch Hotel and post office soon followed.\n\nLong Branch was incorporated as a village in 1930, and managed to survive on its own until being amalgamated into Etobicoke in 1967. Something always amuses me about the level of vitriol surrounding the most recent amalgamation, when if you look back on it, Toronto is made up of towns, villages, and municipalities that were absorbed over the years.\n\nLong Branch is located east of Etobicoke Creek, south of the Lakeshore West rail corridor, and west of 23rd St.\n\nI started and ended my walk at Long Branch Station, heading east, and coming back north.\n\nLong Branch was walked on October 10, 2011\n\nI started out at Long Branch’s transit hub where the Lakeshore West GO Train, Queen and Lakeshore Streetcars, as well as some TTC and MiWay buses, all meet. The terminal loop of the streetcar track was under construction, so it made it more difficult to get a good picture, but there is a very appropriate mural showing all kinds of different modes of transportation running along the fence between the streetcar and GO train tracks.\n\nYou don’t feel as though you have run off to the suburbs to the same extent as if you took the GO train east. For starters, there are streetcars here, the only place outside of old Toronto where you can find them. Besides the streetcars, Lakeshore Blvd is also a street full of pedestrians, cyclists, and sidewalk level retail (aside from the occasional strip plaza). It’s not the only place in Etobicoke with any of these characteristics, but it combines and makes good use of them. In conjunction with the mixed high-medium-low rise residential structures, it all has a very urbane quality to it.\n\nThere are many interesting stores, although it was Thanksgiving when I walked here so most were closed.\n\nIt is a well advertised neighbourhood with the street signs, banner flags and many store names all declaring that you’re in Long Branch. The local BIA has also obviously spent money on street beautification with benches and planters abound.\n\nThe Ukrainian Orthodox Church of St. Demetrius is a central landmark of the neighbourhood, built when a wave of eastern European immigration occurred in the post-war period, along with many of the med-rise apartments.\n\nThe majority of the north south streets are numbered like 29th street here, hosting these newer homes. The numbering, which starts in the adjacent New Toronto neighbourhood, and continues into Long Branch, gives the neighbourhood an unusual feel.\n\nSome of the houses are older, smaller and a tad more quaint containing large looming trees with long branches.\n\nThe Vincent Massey Public School was opened in 1929, and has a bit of a claim to fame, as it was the filming location of the original Degrassi Junior High.\n\nThere’s not a lot of congruity on the Lakeshore Strip, you can go from a fair trade organic cafe, to a motorcycle retailer, to a dentists office…\n\n… to a greek/texan fusion restaurant.\n\nThe Lakeshore Campus of Humber College is located just at the edge of Long Branch at Lakeshore and 23rd St.\n\nJust south of it is the R.L. Clark water treatment plant. R.L. Clark was the commissioner of works for Metropolitan Toronto from 1956 to 1979.\n\nWhere 28th street branches into a spiderlike circle with streets shooting out of it in all directions, is the large Birch Park with recreational facilities such as tennis courts and an arena.\n\nA bit southwest of there are the connected waterfront parks, Long Branch Park, and Len Ford Park. You can access them via Lake Promenade, which is a silly name for a street that doesn’t have sidewalks. This place retains the cottage/resort feel of historic Long Branch, with the most likely very expensive houses having their backyards leading directly into the lake.\n\nThere is a little pond like enclave of the lake where enormous amounts of ducks, seagulls, geese and swans were gathering to roost and feed.\n\nIt is a lovely walk, with the tall willows swaying in the breeze to guide you along the waterfront.\n\nAt the very southwest of the neighbourhood just next to Etobicoke creek (the Toronto-Mississauga border) is Marie Curtis Park East. The park used to contain homes, but many were destroyed, as well as 6 local residents who lost their lives, during Hurricane Hazel. This floodplain area was turned into a park as a result. It is also the location of one of Toronto’s beaches, unfortunately one of its most polluted due to the adjacent Etobicoke creek. It was certainly still being enjoyed on this unusually warm Thanksgiving.\n\nAnother unique feature of this beach is the cannon, which is appropriate considering the military history of the area. Besides being originally owned by a Colonel, the Small Arms Limited factory used to be located in the area, and produced vast quantities of small arms during WWII.\n\nLooking north up Etobicoke creek. There is a pedestrian bridge you can cross if you want to head over to the ‘saug.\n\nEtobicoke Creek flowing south into Lake Ontario.\n\nAs the Etobicoke Creek trail heads under Lakeshore Blvd and the Lakeshore West Rail Corridor, and out of Long Branch, so too must we say goodbye to Long Branch."
