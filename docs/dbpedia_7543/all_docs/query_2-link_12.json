        "text": "Etobicoke (pronounced Template:IPA) is the western portion of the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, with a population of approximately 345,000[1]. It is bordered on the south by Lake Ontario, on the east by the Humber River, on the west by the city of Mississauga, and on the north by the city of Vaughan.\n\nHistory[]\n\nIt is thought that the French explorer, Étienne Brûlé, was the first European to visit the area, circa 1615.\n\nThe name \"Etobicoke\" was derived from the Mississauga word wah-do-be-kang, meaning \"place where the black/wild alders grow\", which was used to describe the area between Etobicoke Creek and the Humber River. The first provincial land surveyor, Augustus Jones, also spelled it as \"ato-be-coake\". Etobicoke was finally adopted as the official name in 1796.\n\nThe township of Etobicoke was incorporated in 1850. In 1953, Etobicoke Township became a part of the newly-formed regional government, the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (\"Metro\").\n\nIn 1967, the township of Etobicoke was merged with three small lakeside municipalities — Long Branch, New Toronto and Mimico — to form the borough of Etobicoke. The borough was reincorporated as a city in 1984.\n\nIn 1998, six local municipalities (including Etobicoke) and the Metropolitan Toronto government merged to form the amalgamated city of Toronto.\n\nNature of the Suburb[]\n\nEtobicoke has the lowest population density out of the former cities and boroughs that currently make up the city of Toronto. This is mainly due to its vast expanses of industrial lands. Several major freeways are routed through the area, making the area ideal for automobile-based transportation. Public transit does not serve the area well, with few rapid transit connections.\n\nMany exceptions to Toronto's gridded street matrix are found in Etobicoke. A number of overpasses and awkward intersections, such as Bloor/Kipling/Dundas West, have been created in an effort to reconcile the grid with these planning anomalies.\n\nEtobicoke has numerous public parks, notable among them is James Gardens on the banks of the Humber River. The park includes seasonal flowers, walkways, a rock garden, streams, and waterfalls. It is a very popular site for taking wedding photographs. The Humber Bay park is mostly located in Etobicoke.\n\nMany areas in Etobicoke have become neglected, \"inner-ring\" suburbs, such as Rexdale. Car culture infrastructure built in the 1960s is in a state of disrepair. Etobicoke is dominated by this unadorned, single-storeyed development and treeless, tarmac-covered prairie. Deflated real estate values have created many concentrated areas of poverty and crime. These factors are compounded by the suburb's proximity to the downtown core: too distant for an acceptable commute, yet not distant enough for the benefits of country living. These central and northern areas of Etobicoke contain numerous high-density apartment complexes set in the middle of sizable, open fields and parks. This residential housing stock is largely ill-maintained, and exaggerates pedestrian distances.\n\nThe southern areas of Etobicoke are better served by public transit and closer to the city centre. These areas, such as Markland Wood, The Kingsway and New Toronto, have attracted more affluent residences.\n\nEtobicoke is home to Humber College, University of Guelph-Humber, Woodbine Race Track and Slots, Woodbine Centre and Sherway Gardens Shopping Centre.\n\nMayors and Reeves of Etobicoke[]\n\n1850 William Gamble, Reeve\n\n1851-1854 Joseph Smith, Reeve\n\n1855-1857 Alexander McFarlane, Reeve\n\n1858-1864 Edward Musson, Reeve\n\n1865-1870 William Wallace, Reeve\n\n1873 John Clark, Reeve\n\n1874-1876 William Wallace, Reeve\n\n1877-1884 Matthew Canning, Reeve\n\n1885-1896 John D.
