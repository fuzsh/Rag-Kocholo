The Etobicoke exfiltration system (EES) was developed in 1993 to remediate the impact on the hydrologic cycle after urbanization. The purpose of this research is to model the Etobicoke exfiltration system (EES) and evaluate the stormwater management performance of EES. A comprehensive literature review was conducted on development of stormwater management and Low impact development (LID). The US EPA SWMM was selected to model the EES. Three modelling methods were investigated to simulate the performance of EES. The Orifice-Storage-Pump method was found to perform the best. EES was applied before an existing wet pond in a case study subdivision. The modelling results show that EES meets three criteria: reduce water quantity, impact water balance and improve water quality.\n\nHistory"
