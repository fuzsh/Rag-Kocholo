        "text": "Islington Village emerged in the early 1800s with a cluster of stores, churches, a school and a post office centred along Dundas Street West. The focal point of this village was the Thomas Montgomery Inn. The Montgomery Inn was a popular meeting place for the local villagers as well as thirsty farmers with grain in tow on their way to mills along the Humber River. Montgomery Inn is still standing at 4709 Dundas Street West where it now serves as a local museum. It is one of the few buildings of the Old Village of Islington to survive the residential subdivision of this neighbourhood which took place shortly after the Second World war.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Islington was originally known as Mimico but that its name was changed in 1858 to avoid confusion with the postal station at Toronto’s Mimico lakeshore neighbourhood. The Islington name was chosen by Elizabeth Smith whose husband Thomas was the proprietor of the local hotel. Elizabeth Smith chose the Islington name after her birthplace in England.\n\nEd Note. The Islington Burial Grounds on Dundas Street is one of the oldest cemeteries in Toronto. It was opened around 1807.\n\nKnown as “Toronto’s Village of Murals” Islington Village is located in the heart of Etobicoke. This residential neighbourhood boasts 25 mural “masterpieces”, enhancing the walls of over 15,000 square feet that span five blocks of the historic shopping district on Dundas West. Painted by artist extraordinaire, John Kuna, the murals depict a cohesive history of the neighbourhood. A labour of love this project started over nine years ago and is still expanding.\n\nBoutique style shopping, quaint dining spots, local services, an abundance of greenspace and parkland, convenient access to TTC and Go Transit stations make Islington Village a great Downtown lifestyle alternative.\n\nThe original homes consisted of traditional architectural styles and were built on generous size lots. Some of these houses have been replaced by newer custom builds. The Mimico Creek and the Islington Golf Club wind their way through the centre of this picturesque neighbourhood.\n\nToday Dundas W. between Montgomery Road and Kipling Avenue is the location of the Village of Islington Business Improvement Area (BIA). Visit this link to see shops, services and amenities in this colourful neighbourhood.\n\nThe Village of Islington on Dundas Street West between Montgomery Road and Kipling Avenue has an upscale tone with a small town feel. Stores here include a gourmet food shop, a deli, two drug stores, a hardware store, several flower shops, coffee houses and over 30 pubs, restaurants and cafes. The area known for its art and history is home to Arts Etobicoke, Creative Village, The Music Studio and Montgomery’s Inn.\n\nFurther west along Dundas Street in the Dunbloor area are a cluster of small retail plazas, family style restaurants, professional and medical offices, new condos and specialty stores including a lingerie store and many salons.\n\nThis area participates in the City-wide Doors Open Toronto and Culture Days events showcasing local art and history and offering free walking and trolley tours.\n\nVisitors are always welcome in the Village of Islington to enjoy a leisurely stroll along Dundas Street West where you will spot colourful murals painted on the sides of local buildings. The Village of Islington has earned the well-deserved reputation of having the best quality murals in the city. Some of the mural themes include: tributes to Islington’s past volunteer fire brigade and acknowledgement of local farmers and prominent residents. The murals also look at the area’s role in historical events including Hurricane Hazel and the War of 1812. And one of the area’s most beloved murals entitled “Briarly – Gone but not forgotten” showcases an original home in the village, that unfortunately is no longer standing.\n\nEach mural is accompanied by an historical plaque which provides details about the subjects painted in murals. For groups of 10 or more contact the Business Improvement Area (BIA) for a free guided mural tour at info@villageofislington.com or 647-703-4802.\n\nIslington’s housing stock dates from the 1930’s, 40’s, and 50’s. The older houses in this neighbourhood represent some of the best examples of Georgian, Colonial, English Cottage and Tudor style houses in the city. There is also a nice mix of Cape Cod style houses, ranch style bungalows and split-level homes. Many of these houses are situated on premium size lots that either front or back onto the Islington Golf Course.\n\nIslington also has a growing number of custom built new homes. Most of these houses are well designed and blend in well with the older houses in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe historic Montgomery’s Inn located at 4709 Dundas Street West, is now a museum. This Georgian Loyalist Inn with its handsome riverstone exterior is one of the most beautiful and alluring buildings in Toronto. Montgomery’s Inn hosts a number of year round festivals, a lecture series, and an afternoon tea in its cosy and comfortable tea room.\n\nThe Islington Golf Club features a Par 72, 6400 yard course that was designed by renowned golf course architect Stanley Thompson. This private club has a friendly atmosphere and is geared towards families.\n\nIf tennis is your game you will want to head to Rosethorn Park located just north of the Islington Golf Club. This park has three tennis courts and a children’s playground.\n\nThe Islington Baseball League has been in operation since 1952. This club operates out of Rosethorn Park. Programs include Co-ed T-Ball, Boys and Girls Rookie Ball, Clinics and Rep teams."
