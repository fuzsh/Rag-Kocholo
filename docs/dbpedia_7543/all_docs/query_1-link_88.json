        "text": "Are you thinking of moving from Central Toronto to a more affordable spot in the GTA? If so, you’re not alone. Every day, Torontonians make the decision to leave the downtown core in favour of a nearby city or district where their dollars will go further. Two of the most popular options are Etobicoke and Mississauga.\n\nWhile Etobicoke is part of Toronto, its natural beauty and community-oriented neighbourhoods give it a distinct identity. Mississauga is a thriving city in its own right, with a growing population and urban skyline.\n\nGet the latest market insights, community news, and more delivered right to your inbox! Subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nIf you’re weighing the potential benefits of living in Etobicoke vs. Mississauga, here are some of the key factor you should consider.\n\nThe basics\n\nEtobicoke\n\nPopulation: 376,237\n\nAverage age: 44.2\n\nIncome (average before tax): $61,115\n\nMississauga\n\nPopulation: 717,961\n\nAverage age: 39.6\n\nIncome (average before tax): $45,267\n\nAs Canada’s sixth biggest city, Mississauga has a much larger population than Etobicoke. Its residents are also (on the whole) younger, but their average yearly earnings are significantly lower. While Mississauga provides plenty of urban vibrance, Etobicoke offers the best of both worlds—a quiet refuge that’s not far from downtown Toronto.\n\nDiscover more reasons to love living in Etobicoke here:\n\nBest Family-Friendly Neighbourhoods in Etobicoke\n\nTop Private Schools in Etobicoke\n\n5 Things to Know About Buying an Etobicoke Condo\n\nAmenities\n\nEtobicoke restaurants & shopping\n\n• Sherway Gardens\n\n• Cloverdale Mall\n\n• Tich\n\n• Sushi Kaji\n\n• Cellar Door\n\n• Old Mill Toronto Restaurant\n\n• Sanremo Bakery\n\n• Drupati’s\n\nMississauga restaurants & shopping\n\n• Square One Mall\n\n• Erin Mills Town Centre\n\n• Goodfellas Wood Oven Pizza\n\n• Eddie’s Wok and Roll\n\n• Piatto Restaurant\n\n• Kravings\n\n• Sushi Tei\n\n• Emerald Chinese Restaurant\n\nBoth Etobicoke and Mississauga are known for their top-notch malls.

In Mississauga, go with Square One—one of the biggest malls in Canada.\n\nEtobicoke’s cuisine is incredibly diverse, and it’s becoming more inventive all the time. Critics across the GTA rave about Tich, where you’ll find superb Indian food with a creative twist. Sushi Kaji is considered one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto, while Cellar Door offers some of the most flavourful Southern Italian fare outside of Italy. Of course, a city the size of Mississauga is also bound to have some great eateries. Goodfellas is the place to go for fantastic wood-fired pizza, while Emerald Chinese Restaurant is a wildly-popular spot for dim sum.\n\nGet to know living in Mississauga with these posts next:\n\n5 Great Mississauga Communities to Call Home\n\n5 Top-Notch Schools in Mississauga\n\n5 More Great Mississauga Communities to Call Home\n\nThings to do\n\nEtobicoke attractions\n\n• Centennial Park\n\n• Humber Bay Park\n\n• Village of Islington\n\n• Great Lakes Brewery\n\n• Humber Arboretum\n\n• Montgomery’s Inn\n\nMississauga attractions\n\n• Erindale Park\n\n• Kariya Park\n\n• Jack Darling Memorial Park\n\n• The Art Gallery of Mississauga\n\n• The Adamson Estate\n\n• Playdium\n\nIf you’re thinking about living in Etobicoke vs. Mississauga, don’t forget to consider the fun activities that each region has to offer. Nature enthusiasts will fall in love with Etobicoke, which features ample green space and gorgeous waterfront trails. Additionally, when it comes to outdoor space, it doesn’t get better than Centennial Park (though Mississauga does have some beautiful parks of its own).\n\nIn Etobicoke, exploring the natural world isn’t the only thing you should add to your to-do list. Check out the outdoor murals in the Village of Islington, or immerse yourself in history at Montgomery’s Inn or the Black Creek Pioneer Village. You might also want to enjoy a drink at one of the area’s fantastic breweries. In Mississauga, you can visit the local art gallery, tour the historic Adamson Estate, or dive into some\n\nfamily fun at the Playdium.\n\nRead our full Etobicoke neighbourhood guide right here.\n\nGetting around\n\nOne of the best things about Etobicoke is the convenient lifestyle it provides. The area offers a refuge from the hustle and bustle of Central Toronto, yet it’s just a short commute from the city’s core. For drivers, the Gardiner makes it easy to get downtown quickly. Etobicoke is also well served by transit; residents can take their local bus routes to Kipling, Islington, or Royal York Station in order to connect to the Bloor-Danforth line.\n\nMississauga residents also have a relatively short drive to downtown Toronto via the Gardiner. When it comes to public transportation, the city is served by its MiWay transit system. Although MiWay integrates with the TCC, there’s no denying that taking public transportation into Toronto can be a hassle.\n\nReal estate: Etobicoke vs. Mississauga\n\nNo comparison of Etobicoke vs. Mississauga would be complete without considering local real estate. Both areas boast a variety of housing types that reflect their unique histories—along with plenty of new development. In recent years, Etobicoke’s waterfront has really taken off. Today, you’ll find no shortage of sleek, modern condo buildings in this highly-walkable area. In Mississauga, there are a ton of great buildings downtown. One of the most memorable developments is Absolute Towers, which has garnered worldwide attention for its unique design.\n\nIn both Etobicoke and Mississauga, average selling prices can vary from one neighbourhood to the next. Very generally, they tend to be upwards of $800K for detached homes and over $400K for condos. For buyers, either area can provide great value.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nSo, when it comes to Etobicoke vs. Mississauga, which area should you choose? The answer will depend on what you’re looking for. If you value green space, peace and quiet, and a highly-convenient lifestyle, Etobicoke may be the perfect place to call home. If you’re looking to live in a thriving city that’s outside of Toronto (but not too far away), Mississauga might be the right choice for you.\n\nThinking of buying a condo in Etobicoke?
