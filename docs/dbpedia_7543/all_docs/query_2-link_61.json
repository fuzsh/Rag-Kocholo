        "text": "Some call it \"The Beach\" of the west end. Mimico residents can feel like they have escaped some of the hustle and bustle of city life in their peaceful little corner of the city along Lake Ontario. While you're only a short drive, GO Train ride, or streetcar ride into the city core, it's easy to forget you are in the city when you are soaking up the peace and quiet by the water.\n\nA nature lover and cyclist's dream neighbourhood. If you find your zen in the outdoors or on a long bike ride, you will love Mimico's green space, parks, lake access, and winding cycling paths on the Waterfront Trail. Humber Bay Shores is extra beautiful with it's secluded beachfront and bike trails right along the water's edge. Head to Etobicoke Point for a clear view of the Toronto skyline.\n\nHome of the infamous SanRemo Bakery. We bet it would be hard to find a South Etobicoke resident that doesn't know about SanRemo Bakery and their delicious selection of baked goods, huge sandwiches, and grocery staples. It is always busy, with lots of regulars who come for lunch and a coffee daily. Don't be surprised if they are sold out of their famous apple fritters before 11am.\n\nAn easy commute to downtown Toronto. Mimico residents needing to commute into the city core benefit from having a GO Train stop located in their neighbourhood, and also the streetcar line running along Lake Shore. If you get on the GO Train at Mimico station, you can get to Union Station in 15 minutes. Nearby access to Highway 427 and the Gardiner Expressway make getting where you need to go easier.\n\nRoyal York Meat Market is much more than a butcher. You will know you are in the right spot when you see the vintage green truck parked out front along Royal York with the truck bed filled with seasonal produce like watermelon, pumpkins, or corn. Royal York Meat Market is more than just a place to get fresh meat, but is like a mini grocery store in the heart of Mimico. You will find fresh produce, an extensive selection of sauces and seasoning, dry goods, and dairy products. Nic is a big fan of their Korean short ribs and their wide variety of housemade sausages. Afterwards pop over to SanRemo for fresh bread and a sweet treat, and then to Royal York Flowers to grab yourself a nice bouquet.\n\nA mix of classic Toronto homes with their charm intact and custom built modern homes. You will find lots of houses built in the 1920s-1950s in Mimico, and as young families have continued to move into Mimico over recent years more homes have seen renovations and improvements while keeping their historical charm intact. We are also seeing an increase in custom homes being built as people realize that larger lot sizes and greater affordability that can be found in Mimico in comparison to a bit further east.\n\nThe views from the Humber Bay Shores condos are hard to beat. Located on the east end of Mimico, Humber Bay Shores has seen a boom in condo developments over the last decade. An area that was historically known for run down motels has now become a hub of activity as new condo towers have gone up quickly. While this has brought some growing pains and traffic congestion along the main arteries, the condos have attracted people looking to live in a great community right outside the city core, and the lucky ones score an awesome view of Lake Ontario.\n\nMimico's popularity is continuing to grow. After being classified as \"up and coming\" for a while, Mimico seems to be gaining in popularity as more and more people discover this gem. In 2012, Toronto Life magazine named Mimico their #1 neigbourhood for \"where to buy now.\" It's likely not a coincidence that bidding wars on Mimico houses have become a frequent occurrence over the last several years. While home prices have been climbing, people are finding that their dollar still goes farther here - often getting a larger home, with a bigger yard, and more parking than they were looking at getting closer to downtown.\n\nIndependent restaurants and bakeries to satisfy any craving. Breakfast Room and Panagios are popular breakfast spots, and Universal Bakery and The Bread Essentials are great places to stock up on fresh bread and baked goods. Check out Pearl Sushi, Tich if you're craving Indian food, LaVinia for Spanish inspired dishes, and Appalachia Smokehouse and BBQ for classic and delicious BBQ dishes. Try their gold sauce, you won't regret it. For classic pub food check out Blue Goose Tavern, located in the historic Windsor Public House built in 1909. If you're looking to pick up fresh pasta to take home, Queens Pasta supplies many restaurants in the city and their wholesale location is on Newcastle in Mimico and they welcome walk ins.\n\nThe arts are celebrated here. Lakeshore Arts has a goal of \"connecting communities through art\" and runs a diverse selection of programs for all age groups from their Lake Shore Blvd studio and within the community. Oak Learners on Royal York is another great spot for those looking to nurture their children's creativity through music, art, and mindfulness programs. They also run March Break and PA Day camps for kids.\n\nStop by SanRemo Bakery for a life changing doughnut. This place is always packed and the doughnuts often sell out before noon. Not a doughnut fan? Not to worry. They have fresh bread, pastries, meats, cheeses, gelato, massive sandwiches, and a hot table for lunch on the go. Enjoy lunch al fresco on their patio. But seriously, their apple fritter doughnut will change your life.\n\nWalk or cycle along the beautiful Waterfront Trail. If you're looking for a relaxing and scenic walk or bike ride, we suggest picking up the Waterfront Trail from the end of Norris Cres. You'll wind your way through Mimico Waterfront Park, Amos Waites Park, past the Etobicoke Yacht Club, through beautiful Humber Bay Shores, over the Humber Bay Arch bridge, and then you can relax on the Sunnyside boardwalk. Be warned - you may forget you are in the city it's so picturesque. If you stop at Sheldon Lookout, you can capture a great photo of the Toronto skyline and the Humber Bay Arch bridge.\n\nCheck out one or all of Mimico's great parks. Visit Ourland Park's outdoor pool and playground, Mimico Memorial Park's big playground and wading pool, and Amos Waites Park for a fun nautical themed playground with lake views, a great splash pad, an outdoor swimming pool, and Muskoka chairs for the parents to relax in.\n\nEnjoy lunch next to Lake Ontario at Eden Trattoria. An Italian restaurant with a huge menu of pizza, pasta, seafood, and steaks. Work off your lunch with a stroll along the Waterfront Trail, located right outside the restaurant.\n\nVisit the Humber Bay Shores Farmers Market. Held every Saturday between late May and early October from 9am-2pm in Humber Bay Park West. This very popular market offers a great selection of local meat, cheeses, fruits and vegetables (some organic), baked goods, coffee, and tea.\n\nSatisfy your sweet tooth at Ed's Real Scoop. Ed's Real Scoop on Lake Shore is always busy and always delicious, known for their homemade ice cream, gelato, frozen yogurt, sorbets, and ice cream sandwiches. They have over 100 flavours of ice cream that they rotate through, and we highly recommend the s'mores, Ed's rocky driveway, cookies and cream, and pistachio almond ice cream. They have great seasonal flavours too. How can you go wrong with Mini Egg themed ice cream?\n\nLearn to sail at Etobicoke Yacht Club or just watch all the sail boats. Sailing lessons are open to youth between ages 7 and 17.\n\nHave a pizza date at FBI Pizza or Pizzeria Oro Di Napoli. FBI \"Full Blooded Italian\" pizza geniuses offer more than just your average pizza toppings (think portobello mushrooms, porchetta, and grana padano cheese), and they deliver! Pizzeria Oro Di Napoli has likely the best Italian food in South Etobicoke. Their pizzas and pastas are excellent, and we are especially big fans of their tartufo pizza. Both spots have nice patios right along Lake Shore.\n\nStop for a cup of coffee at Birds and Beans. Definitely a favourite among Mimico residents, Birds and Beans specializes in \"sustainable coffee offering a wide selection of certified organic, shade grown, fairly traded, and Bird Friendly coffees.\" With a patio offering a view of the lake and Amos Waites Park, it's easy to see why this place is a neighbourhood hot spot.\n\nCatch the Mimico Summer Music Series. Friday evenings in the summer you can catch some live music with your neighbours at Mimico Square, next door to Birds and Beans Cafe.\n\nAttend the Humber Bay Shores Waterfront Festival. One Saturday in August, the residents of South Etobicoke celebrate with a big street festival in Humber Bay Shores with live music, buskers, kid's activities, food trucks, and a farmers market.\n\nGet in the holiday spirit at the Etobicoke Lakeshore Santa Claus Parade. The parade has been ranked the 4th best Santa Claus parade in Ontario (yes, somebody actually ranks Santa Clause Parades) and is filled with floats, marching bands, the jolly man himself, all with its own Etobicoke kind of flare. The parade runs from Dwight Ave in Mimico into Long Branch, along Lake Shore Blvd."
