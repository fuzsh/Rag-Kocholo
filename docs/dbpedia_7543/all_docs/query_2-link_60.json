This sentiment is shared by CSA Group’s employees as well. There are so many people and departments that provide support and diligently work in the background to help us create and develop standards and the tools to effectively use them.\n\nEmployee Spotlight\n\nRoshini Chandran\n\nProduct Safety Engineer – Certifier I\n\n“\n\nBeyond my day-to-day tasks, training and development is ongoing.

However, I’m amazed at the level of innovation that CSA Group is willing to explore to improve our offerings and provide customers with the solutions that they need.\n\nEmployee Spotlight\n\nClaudia Ibarra\n\nCertifier II (Wire & Cable)\n\n“\n\nBefore joining CSA Group, I worked in Mexico as a certification engineer for an appliance manufacturer. While working in this role, I had the opportunity to visit CSA Group’s appliance labs in Toronto to prepare for and witness the start of a test. Very quickly I decided that I wanted to move to Canada and grow my career at CSA Group."
