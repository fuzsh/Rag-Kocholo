You’ll also find condominium and apartment developments throughout the area, many of which are next to the Humber River or on the waterfront.\n\nCheck out the Etobicoke homes for sale.\n\nRecreation\n\nEtobicoke is known for its lush landscape and touch of natural beauty, so it’s no surprise that you’ll find numerous green spaces and parks throughout the area. Local favourites include James Gardens, Centennial Park, Colonel Samuel Smith Park, and Humber Bay Park. Etobicoke is also home to the world-class St. George’s Golf and Country Club, a five-time host of the Canadian Open, ranked as one of the world’s top golf clubs."
