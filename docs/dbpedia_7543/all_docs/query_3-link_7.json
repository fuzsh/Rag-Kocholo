        "text": "Why visit Toronto? There are plenty of great reasons why Toronto should be at the top of your Canadian Travel list. In fact, it’s such a great city that I moved here 5 years ago!\n\nOn top of being Canada’s largest city, Toronto is home to some of Canada’s most important landmarks and is a vibrant hub for music, art, culture and food. With a wide range of fascinating sites, museums, nightlife, entertainment venues, sporting facilities and outdoor spaces, there is something for everyone here.\n\nHow do I know? I’ve lived in Toronto since 2018 and I love it here. As a Toronto local, I’m constantly exploring everything the city has to offer, from key attractions to local hotspots. And, by now, I know what the best things to do here are.\n\nSo, read on for a local’s perspective of why you should visit Toronto, and everything you need to know to plan your trip.\n\nWhy Visit Toronto?\n\nWhen planning a trip to Canada, you probably envisage trekking in the mountains, wandering the cobble stone streets of Montreal, and visiting natural landmarks like Niagara Falls and Lake Louise. But, another Canadian destination which should be at the top of your travel bucket list is Toronto.\n\nToronto is a modern city, but it’s beautiful in its own right and has so much to offer. It actually has a lot of history and culture, from its early indigenous roots to its growth into a major metropolis. And it’s the most multicultural city in the world!\n\nThere’s tons of culture, attractions and entertainment\n\nThe various neighbourhoods around the city all offer different cultural experiences and rich and diverse foods from different regions. In particular, Chinatown, Little Italy, Greektown and Little Portugal are some of the best areas to visit.\n\nToronto is also home to some of the country’s most important landmarks. And there is an interesting mix of impressive sky scrapers and historic architecture. Plus, there’s a beautiful waterfront and lots of green spaces to explore around the city.\n\nAnd the city has a lively arts, sports and entertainment scene, featuring theatres, galleries, museums, and numerous festivals and music, film and sporting events throughout the year.\n\nIt’s a great place to base yourself to explore Canada\n\nAnd if that’s not enough of a reason to visit Toronto, the city is also located within easy reach of other popular Canadian destinations, making it a great base to explore the country from.\n\nNiagara Falls and the surrounding wine regions are a great day trip from the city, at only a 1.5 hour drive away. Algonquin Provincial Park, which is Canada’s oldest provincial park and one of the world’s best canoeing destinations (and my favourite place in Ontario!) is about a 3 hour drive away. And you can also get to Montreal in around 5 hours by car or train, or a 1.5 hour flight.\n\nIt’s the perfect start or end to your Canadian travels\n\nFinally, Toronto is a very easy city to get to! With two airports and plenty of inter-regional bus and train services, it’s likely you may have to transit through here anyway on your Canadian travels. Therefore, it’s a great place to spend a few days to start or end your trip to Canada.\n\n15 Best Things to Do in Toronto\n\nNow that you know why you should visit Toronto, here are my recommendations (as a local) for the top things to do when visiting the city.\n\n1. Go Up the CN Tower\n\nAs one of the world’s tallest free-standing structures, the CN Tower is Toronto’s top attraction. This iconic Canadian landmark offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city, and has something for everyone.\n\nWith multiple viewing platforms and huge floor-to-ceiling windows, you will get unobstructed views of the city skyline and beyond. If you’re not too afraid of heights, then you can walk across the Glass Floor to check out the view below.\n\nAnd, for true thrill seekers, see the view from 116 stories high from the outside, on the EdgeWalk. This is the world’s highest hands-free full circle walk and is an exhilarating experience. Although this really isn’t for the faint hearted!\n\nIf you’re like me and prefer to stay inside at these heights, then you might find dining at the 360 Restaurant more enjoyable. This rotating restaurant, 351 metres above Toronto, completes a full rotation every 72 minutes, so you’ll be able to take in views of the skyline from all angles during your meal. Plus, if you dine at the restaurant, your admission ticket is included in the price.\n\n2. Tour Casa Loma\n\nCasa Loma is a Gothic Revival castle-turned-museum in Midtown Toronto. This is a one of a kind building in Canada, set amidst beautiful grounds, which you can explore at your own pace.\n\nYou can wander through the great hall, marvel at the 10,000+ book library, tour the castle’s elegant suites, and learn about Canada’s history by visiting several onsite exhibits.\n\nNot only is Casa Loma one of Toronto’s most historic buildings, but it’s also a popular event venue and filming location for television and movies, making it a must-visit attraction for movie buffs. Some of the most famous films which were shot here include X-men, Chicago and the Rocky Horror Picture Show!\n\nAnd keep an eye out for seasonal events held here, such as Christmas at the Castle, Symphony Orchestra concerts, a haunted house at Halloween, high teas and escape room events.\n\n3. Spend a Day at the ROM\n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is Canada’s largest museum and is a cultural treasure trove. With over 1 million objects from around the world, the ROM celebrates rich cultures, natural history and fascinating art through its many collections.\n\nThe ROM’s variety is huge, from indigenous artwork to dinosaur fossils, historic textiles, Archaeological artefacts, and objects from the ancient world including Egypt, Greece and the Near East, and much more.\n\nYou can easily spend a whole day exploring the ROM’s extensive collection. But, at the very least, I would recommend allowing yourself half a day to visit the museum.\n\nAnd, if you’re looking for even more of an art fix, and can fit it into your itinerary, the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) is another museum in Toronto worth visiting. With over 90,000 works of art, it’s one of the most distinguished galleries in North America.\n\n4. Browse Kensington Market\n\nKensington Market is one of Toronto’s coolest and most eclectic neighbourhoods. It’s a lively street market with everything from vintage, music and cannabis stores, to meat, fish and produce markets, street food vendors, and some of Toronto’s best holes-in-the-wall.\n\nIn the warmer months, the neighbourhood comes alive and buzzes with creativity. It get so busy that pedestrians take over the sidewalks and streets, making it a very difficult place to drive or bike through. In fact, I would never recommend anything other than walking through Kensington, or you will likely find yourself at a standstill.\n\nPlus, on the last Sunday of the month throughout the summer, Kensington Market hosts ‘pedestrian Sundays’, which effectively turns the whole area into a street festival.\n\nTo see the best of Toronto’s creativity, try unusual and delicious street food, and shop for unique one-of-a-kind pieces, Kensington Market is a must-visit neighbourhood!\n\n5. See a Sports Game\n\nWith several iconic sports teams, one of the best things to do when visiting Toronto is to see a game. Toronto has several sports venues, including two major stadiums: Scotiabank Arena and Roger’s Stadium.\n\nThe three most popular sports to watch in Toronto are ice hockey, basketball and baseball. And the NHL (National Hockey League), NBA (National Basketball Association) and MBL (Major League Baseball) all host games here throughout the season.\n\nToronto’s key teams to try and see are the Blue Jays for baseball, the Toronto Raptors for basketball, and the Toronto Maple Leafs for hockey.\n\nAlthough tickets to a Maple Leafs game can be quite difficult to get and very pricy. So, as an alternative, you could try to get tickets for the Toronto Marlies instead, which play as part of the AHL (American Hockey League). Although not as big as the Maple Leafs, Marlies games are often much more fun, and have an amazing atmosphere!\n\nPlus, if you’re a hockey fan, make sure to also visit the Hockey Hall of Fame while in Toronto. You will see some amazing hockey memorabilia, the Esso Great Hall, and the major NHL trophies. And there are interactive games and a chance to learn more about Canadian sporting history.\n\n6. Explore Toronto’s Old Town\n\nAlthough Toronto is a very modern city, it’s actually over 230 years old! As such, Toronto has an old town, with quite a few historic buildings, amidst the modern skyscrapers. And this area is absolutely worthwhile exploring!\n\nToronto’s Old Town is located just east of Yonge Street, on the west side of the Don River, between Queen Street East and the Gardiner Expressway.\n\nHere, you can see iconic architecture like the Gooderham Building (also known as the ‘Flatiron Building’), wander the cobblestone streets of the historic Distillery District and eat your way through vibrant St. Lawrence Market (which has been named one of the world’s best food markets).\n\n7. Experience Canada’s Most Diverse Food Scene\n\nAs the most multicultural city in the world, it’s expected that Toronto would have an extremely diverse food scene. And it does not disappoint!\n\nIn fact, for many people the city’s food scene is one of the best reasons to visit Toronto.\n\nFrom upscale eateries to hidden gems and every type of cuisine imaginable, the options are endless. Some of Toronto’s most notable restaurants include the Michelin star Alo Restaurant, Spanish Tapas bar Bar Raval, and Don Alfonso 1890, which has been named the best Italian Restaurant in the world.\n\nHowever, you don’t have to opt for fine dining to experience excellent food in Toronto. My favourite places in the city are actually much more casual spots in areas like Kensington Market, Chinatown, Koreatown and along the Ossington strip. In particular, I recommend trying Seven Lives for Toronto’s best tacos, Rasta Pasta for Jamaican with a twist, and PG Clucks for the ultimate chicken sandwich.\n\nAnd, in the summer, Toronto hosts a different street festival almost every weekend, including several cultural and food-focused festivals. Some of the best ones to look out for are Taste of Little Italy in June, Ribfest in July and Taste of the Danforth in August.\n\n8. Stroll Through Graffiti Alley\n\nToronto is a hub for art and culture, which also includes street art. And the best place to see amazing street art in the city is Graffiti Alley.\n\nLocated parallel to Queen Street West in the Fashion District, Graffiti Alley is effectively an open-air gallery which stretches for three blocks. And it’s actually due to the vibrant alley that street art was legitimized in Toronto in 2011, resulting in more and more colourful murals to appear across the city.\n\nGraffiti Alley showcases work by iconic artists including Elicser, Uber5000, Poser, Duro the Third, Spud and many more.\n\nIn addition to admiring the intricate and colourful works of art, Graffiti Alley is one of the best places in Toronto to take photos. So make sure to bring your camera!\n\nAlthough it is generally safe to stroll through Graffiti Alley during the day, I would not recommend walking through here after dark. After all, it is an alleyway, and it’s poorly lit at night. Plus, I have encountered some unsavoury characters around here after dark in the past. So, it’s best to save Graffiti Alley for the daytime.\n\n9. Explore the Toronto Waterfront\n\nToronto is located on one of the biggest lakes in the world, Lake Ontario. As such, the city has a huge waterfront area to explore.\n\nThe best way to see as much of Toronto’s waterfront is by biking the Waterfront Trail. This is one of my favourite activities to do in Toronto. Going east, I’ve gone as far as the Scarborough Bluffs, and heading west I’ve biked over 50 miles all the way to Hamilton!\n\nAlthough you don’t have to go quite this far to get to some amazing spots along the waterfront. Cherry Beach is only 3 miles east of downtown, and Woodbine beach is only 6 miles. Or, heading west, the Humber Bay Bridge is a beautiful 5 mile ride, passing by several beaches and parks along the water.\n\nAnd if you’re not keen on cycling, don’t worry as some of the best places to explore on Toronto’s waterfront are within walking distance. Some of the best parks along the water are HTO Park, Trillium Park and Coronation Park. And make sure to check out Toronto’s downtown beach – Sugar Beach – with it’s iconic pink umbrellas.\n\nBut my favourite place along Toronto’s waterfront is the Music Garden. This peaceful garden is a harmonious blend of nature and melody. Inspired by Bach’s Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello, each section of the garden reflects a different dance movement. And, in the summer months, free open-air concerts are held at the garden’s curved amphitheatre, with beautiful views of the harbour.\n\n10. Have a Beach Day at Toronto Islands\n\nWhen you think of Toronto, you probably don’t imagine a beach destination. But, with its huge waterfront, Toronto actually has tons of great beaches. And the best beaches can be found just off the shores of downtown, on the Toronto Islands.\n\nThe Toronto Islands are a cluster of 15 islands all joined together with a total area of 332 hectares. The Islands have 9 miles (14 kms) of trails which can be explored on foot or by bike. There are also 4 official beaches, various parklands and gardens, sporting facilities, lagoons, and even an amusement park.\n\nYou can get to the Toronto Islands easily from downtown by taking a 13-minute ferry ride, or a 10-minute water taxi.\n\nThis is the ideal place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. When I visit the islands I usually take my bike over with me (which is allowed on both the ferry and water taxi) so I can explore as much of the parks and trails as possible before settling in for the day at the beach.\n\nThe islands are also a great place for paddling, with canoe, kayak and SUP rentals available onsite.\n\n11. Visit The Toronto Zoo\n\nThe Toronto Zoo is the biggest zoo in Canada and one of the largest and most diverse zoos in the world. With over 710 acres and hundreds of different species, this is somewhere you can easily spend a full day exploring.\n\nWhile I don’t normally advocate for animals being kept in captivity, the Toronto zoo is an excellent centre for science and education, and it actively promotes conservation science. In fact, the zoo commits itself to exceptionally high animal welfare standards, undertakes important conservation work and helps to preserve endangered species through breeding programs and reintroducing them into the wild.\n\nThe Toronto zoo is also a really interesting and fun family-friendly day out. It has something for everyone, with fascinating wildlife from 7 geographical locations around the world, and North America’s most impressive animals.\n\n12. Learn About Canadian History at Fort York\n\nTo learn more about Canada’s history and see the birthplace of urban Toronto, a visit to the Fort York National Historic Site is a must.\n\nFort York is an early 19th-century military fortification, which was used by the British and Canadian militaries to defend the entrance to the Toronto harbour, most notably in the War of 1812. the Natonal Historic Site spans 43-acres of archeological parkland which includes the fort, military cemeteries, vast archaeological resources and a a visitor centre.\n\nAt the Fort, you can explore the grounds, browse the Exhibit Gallery and partake in an immersive experience of the lead up to the Battle of York\n\nGeneral Admission to Fort York is free, and there are also free 45-minute guided tours which run on the hour, to make sure you get the most out of your visit.\n\n13. Shop at the Eaton Centre\n\nNo trip to a major city would be complete without doing some shopping! And Toronto is no exception.\n\nThere are several amazing shopping districts in Toronto. Most notably Yorkville for designer goods, Kensington Market for vintage stores, and Queen Street West for specialty shops. But the most popular place for shopping in Toronto (and all of Canada) is the Eaton Centre.\n\nLocated downtown on Yonge Street, the Eaton Centre houses over 230 shops, services and restaurants, attracting millions of visitors each year. And this mall has something for everyone with big brands, specialty stores, independently owned boutiques and everything in-between.\n\nAnd even if shopping isn’t up your alley, the Eaton Centre is still worth a visit to marvel at its impressive architecture, with its huge glass roof and iconic “Flight Stop” sculpture. Designed by artist Michael Snow, the sculpture features a flock of Canada geese in flight, soaring high above shoppers.\n\nPlus, just outside the Eaton Centre you will find Dundas Square, which is also a great place to check out. This square is Toronto’s own mini Times Square. It’s a buzzing place day and night with dazzling billboards, vibrant energy, street performers and excellent people-watching.\n\n14. Visit Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada\n\nRipley’s Aquarium of Canada is the country’s largest indoor aquarium and one of Toronto’s top attractions. And with good reason.\n\nRipley’s features over 135,000 square feet (12,500 square metres) of interactive aquarium. Housing over 100,000 animals from 500 different species, the aquarium features one of the most extensive jelly fish exhibits in the world, 10-foot sharks, colourful tropical fish, 65-year-old giant lobsters and more.\n\nPlus, there are stingray touch pools where you can interact with the animals, and several events hosted each day including live dive shows, aquarist talks and penguin feedings.\n\nAnd Ripley’s is not just a fun attraction, it’s also a great learning experience. The aquarium strives to promote environmental education for all ages, as well as research and conservation work through its various programs.\n\n15. See the Toronto Sign at Nathan Phillips Square\n\nFinally, you can’t visit Toronto without seeing Nathan Phillips Square. Located in the heart of Toronto, with City Hall in the background, this is a vibrant and active space which hosts a variety of events throughout the year. Although it’s best known for its famous “Toronto” sign, which is one of the city’s most photographed landmarks.\n\nOriginally installed for the Pan America Games in 2015, the illuminated sign instantly became an iconic landmark in Toronto. Although it was replaced in 2020 with a more durable replica, which features artwork along the edges by a local artist, which highlights Indigenous culture.\n\nThe square also features a fountain at the base of the Toronto sign, which is turned into an ice rink in the winter. Skating in front of the Toronto sign is one of the most iconic activities to do in the city. Plus, access to the rink is free with your own skates, although you can also rent skates onsite.\n\nBest Time to Visit Toronto\n\nThere’s no bad time to visit Toronto, as there are tons of great activities to do in the city year round. And each season offers something different. Although, most locals would agree that the best time to visit is in the summer or fall.\n\nTo help you decide what time of year will suit you best to visit Toronto, here is an overview of each season in the city, from my experience living here.\n\nSummer\n\nMy favourite time of year in Toronto is the summer (June to August), as the days are long, the weather is beautiful and the city really comes alive during these months. Not only is this the best time to enjoy all the beautiful outdoor spaces in the city – such as the various beaches, bike trails and parks – but it’s also the best time of year for events and entertainment.\n\nIn the summer, bars and restaurants open their sidewalk patios, so certain neighbourhoods become really lively. And the beaches and parks become hotspots for people to socialize, have picnics and play sports. Plus, throughout the summer there’s a different festival on almost every weekend, so you will never struggle to find something to keep you entertained.\n\nHowever, the downsides to summer in Toronto is that it’s peak tourist season, and it can get very hot and humid. Average temperatures range from about 18 to 27°C (64-81°F) during the summer, but can get as high as the low 30s (86-93°F)! If you’re not a big fan of crowds and the heat, then I would recommend visiting in the fall.\n\nFall\n\nIn the fall (September to November), the weather is a little cooler, so it’s a more comfortable time to visit Toronto. (Although, be warned, we sometimes do get a few very hot days in September!)\n\nWhat makes fall in Toronto so special is that the city lights up with spectacular hues of red, orange and gold as the leaves change. So it’s a particularly beautiful time to explore the city and surrounding landscapes. The leaves usually start to change around the end of September, and peak during mid to late-October. But this varies from year to year, and often some beautiful colours can still be seen in November.\n\nThe temperature in Toronto during fall varies quite a lot. Average temperatures are as high as 25°C (77°F) during September and as low as 2°C (36°F) during November. If you want to make the most of the beautiful fall colours and pleasant weather, I would recommend visiting Toronto at the end of September or anytime in October.\n\nWinter\n\nThe winters in Toronto do get very cold. In fact, the coldest I’ve experienced was -35°C (-31°F), during my first year living here! Although temperatures this freezing cold aren’t that common. Instead you should expect average temperatures ranging from -10 to +3°C (14-37°F).\n\nBut, despite the cold, Toronto can still be a great place to visit in the winter! The city gets a lot of sun, which makes the cold quite pleasant, with a crisp and fresh feeling. And when it snows, the city looks especially beautiful.\n\nPlus, there are still tons of great activities to do in Toronto in the winter. You will often find locals outside, even in the midst of winter, making use of the city’s free skating rinks and going tobogganing when there’s fresh snow.\n\nFrom mid-November to early January, the historic Distillery District hosts their annual Winter Village. This is a magical outdoor Christmas market with shops, restaurants and cafes, visits from Santa, performances, and a huge Christmas tree as the centrepiece.\n\nAnd there are plenty of indoor activities to do here. Winter is the perfect time to visit Toronto’s main attractions, like the various museums, the CN Tower and Ripley’s Aquarium, go shopping, and indulge in the city’s countless, bars restaurants, theatres and other entertainment venues.\n\nConveniently,, the city also has a huge underground pedestrian network in the downtown core, called the PATH. Spanning over 30 kilometres of tunnels and underground shopping centres, the PATH connects many of Toronto’s key sites and attractions. This means that on particularly cold and snowy days, you don’t even have to go outside to get around and explore the city!\n\nSpring\n\nSpring is an exciting time in Toronto as the city comes to life following the winter. But, although spring officially starts in March, it isn’t until April that you will see the grass turning green and the very first leaves starting to appear.\n\nAnd, at the end of April or early May, you can witness thousands of beautiful cherry blossom trees bloom all around the city. In particular, High Park, Centennial Park and Trinity Bellwoods Park are some of the best places to see them.\n\nThen, in May, the weather significantly warms up, the parks become busier, locals resume their outdoor activities, and the city turns green, almost overnight! This is a great time to visit Toronto if you’re looking for fewer crowds and mild weather, so you can enjoy the best of what the city has to offer.\n\nWhere to Stay in Toronto\n\nThe best place to stay in Toronto depends on what you’re looking to do here, as well as your interests and budget. But, unless you have a good reason to stay outside the city centre, I would always recommend staying in one of Toronto’s downtown neighbourhoods.\n\nDowntown Core\n\nIf you’re looking to make the most of Toronto’s key attractions, I would recommend staying in the downtown core or Entertainment District. This is where you will find Toronto’s main attractions like the CN Tower, Ripley’s Aquarium, Nathan Phillips Square and the Eaton Centre, as well as the city’s most prominent theatres and sporting venues. Plus, the neighbouring Fashion District is only a short walk away and has some of Toronto’s best restaurants and nightlife.\n\nThere are a lot of great hotels in these areas, which you can browse here.\n\nMy favourites are the Ace Hotel Toronto, the Broadview Hotel, and the Ivy at Verity. All three of these are beautiful and unique properties in excellent locations. And, in particular, the Broadview and Ivy are both set in historic buildings with a lot of character and charm.\n\nOther Downtown Neighbourhoods\n\nIf you prefer to stay outside the hustle and bustle of downtown Toronto, then Yorkville and West Queen West are also great neighbourhoods to stay in. Yorkville is a very upmarket area with plenty of museums, galleries and designer shopping. It also has some beautiful hotels, but most of them come with a hefty price tag.\n\nWest Queen West is a lively neighbourhood located west of downtown, which is home to popular music venues, independent boutiques and trendy restaurants. There are two fabulous hotels in this area which I would highly recommend – the historic Gladstone House, and the iconic Drake Hotel.\n\nOutside the City\n\nOr if you don’t mind traveling a little further, for a more budget-friendly trip consider staying on the outskirts of Toronto. In particular, Etobicoke and North York aren’t too far away and are well-connected to the city by public transit.\n\nHow to Get Around Toronto\n\nIt’s relatively easy to get around Toronto, as the city has different transport options to suit different needs and preferences.\n\nWalking\n\nDowntown Toronto is actually really walkable, so the best way to get around is on foot. Even in bad weather, you can still easily walk to many of the key sites by using the city’s PATH network of underground walkways.\n\nPlus, exploring on foot really is the best way to experience the city. And in certain areas you will have no choice but to walk anyway. In particular, the Distillery District is pedestrian only. And Kensington Market is an unofficial pedestrian zone, with so much foot traffic that vehicles virtually come to a standstill trying to get through the area.\n\nWalking around Toronto is actually one of my favourite things to do. I love exploring different neighbourhoods on foot. And I’m constantly discovering new things, from beautiful houses, cute coffee shops and hidden street art, to some truly weird and wonderful things!\n\nREAD MORE: Everything You Need to Know to Explore Toronto on Foot\n\nBiking\n\nIf you’re wanting to travel a bit further in Toronto, I would highly recommend cycling. Toronto is a really bike friendly city, with a huge network of bike paths. And this is a great way to get in-between neighbourhoods and see as much as possible of the city.\n\nThere are several bike rental stores in the city. But the easiest way to get your hands on a bike is to use Bike Share Toronto. This program has over 700 stations and 9,000+ bikes around Toronto and it offers both short-term passes and annual memberships.\n\nPublic Transit\n\nBut if biking isn’t your thing, don’t worry, as Toronto also has an excellent public transit system (the TTC), which operates buses, streetcars and a subway. And the city also has plenty of taxis and rideshare options. Uber is the most commonly used ridesharing service here, but Lyft is another popular option.\n\nDriving\n\nAnd if you prefer to drive, you can also drive your own vehicle or rent a car while in Toronto. Although I would only recommend doing this if you’re planning to take trips outside the city. As the traffic downtown does get pretty bad and parking in the city can be expensive and difficult to come by.\n\nHow Many Days in Toronto is Enough?\n\nThe ideal number of days to spend in Toronto really depends on what you’re hoping to see and do here.\n\nHowever, I would generally recommend allowing yourself around 3 to 4 days to explore the city comfortably. But, you could easily spend more than this if you’re hoping to take some day trips out of the city to see more of Ontario.\n\nTo help you plan your trip, here is my recommended itinerary for 4 days in Toronto:\n\nDay 1\n\nSpend the day in the downtown core visiting the city’s key attractions like the CN Tower, Hockey Hall of Fame and Ripley’s Aquarium, and stroll or bike around the waterfront. In the evening, catch a performance or show at one of Toronto’s many theatres, comedy clubs or live music venues.\n\nDay 2\n\nExplore some of Toronto’s most iconic neighbourhoods, such as Kensington Market, the Distillery District and Queen Street West, where you can see vibrant street art, try some of the city’s most interesting food, and experience Toronto’s unique history and culture. And make sure to stop off at St. Lawrence Market!\n\nDay 3\n\nTake a day trip to Niagara Falls and the surrounding Niagara region. If you’re able to, I highly recommend visiting both Niagara Falls and the quaint town of Niagara-on-the-Lake, as well as driving the stunning Niagara Parkway. The best way to make sure you can comfortably fit everything in is by booking a Niagara Falls day tour from Toronto.\n\nDay 4\n\nVisit the Royal Ontario Museum and, if you have time, the Art Gallery of Ontario. Then, for your last night, dine at one of the city’s best restaurants, such as Canoe, Alo Restaurant or Bar Raval.\n\nAnd, if you have more time to spend in Toronto, I would highly recommend taking a day trip to the Toronto Islands and exploring some of the city’s other green spaces and beaches.\n\nWhy Visit Toronto – FAQs\n\nIs Toronto expensive?\n\nAs a prominent North American city, Toronto is not the cheapest destination to visit. In fact, Toronto is actually ranked as Canada’s most expensive city.\n\nHowever, from my personal experience living and traveling in Canada, I haven’t noticed much of a difference between the prices in Toronto and Canada’s other major cities, like Montreal and Vancouver.\n\nFortunately, lots of the key attractions in Toronto are free or relatively cheap to experience. And, with such diverse neighbourhoods and a huge food scene, it can actually be really affordable to explore and eat out in the city.\n\nHere are some of the best ways to keep your costs down in Toronto:\n\nWalk, bike and use public transit to get around rather than driving or using taxis and rideshare services.\n\nBook accommodation outside the city where it’s a bit cheaper.\n\nEat street food and takeaway rather than dining in restaurants. (You will find plenty of excellent food vendors in Kensington Market, St. Lawrence Market and dotted around the city).\n\nMake the most of free events in the city, like street festivals, open-air concerts and weekly markets.\n\nBuy a CityPass for cheaper admission to Toronto’s top 5 attractions.\n\nSpend time exploring Toronto’s various parks, trails, beaches and huge waterfront.\n\nFor evening entertainment, visit a bar with live music (like a Jazz bar) or go to a comedy show. (Tickets to comedy shows are usually only $10-15 per person!)\n\nSpend time sightseeing and exploring Toronto’s different neighbourhoods on foot.\n\nPlan ahead! Booking in advance is often cheaper. And, if you do your research, you can plan an amazing trip around your budget!\n\nWhat is Toronto know for?\n\nToronto is Canada’s largest city and is the most multicultural city in the world. It’s particularly well known for its cultural diversity, iconic skyline, and vibrant neighbourhoods.\n\nPlus, it has some of Canada’s key attractions, such as the CN Tower, Ripley’s Aquarium, Casa Loma and the Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nThe city is also home to several popular sports team. These include the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL), Toronto Raptors (NBA), and the Toronto Blue Jays (MLB). Plus, Toronto has several major stadiums – most notably the Scotiabank Arena and Roger’s Stadium – which host hockey, basketball, baseball and other sporting events throughout the year.\n\nWhat is the top attraction in Toronto?\n\nThe CN Tower Toronto’s top attraction, with approximately 2 million people going up it every year.\n\nAt 1,815 feet tall, it’s an iconic symbol of the city and offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Toronto and its surroundings. The main observation level, Skypod observation platform, glass floor, EdgeWalk and high speed elevators all offer thrilling experiences with spectacular views of the city’s impressive skyline.\n\nCan you visit Niagara Falls from Toronto?\n\nYes, absolutely! Niagara Falls is one of the most popular day trips from Toronto, and it’s relatively easy to get there. The drive takes around 1.5 to 2 hours. But you can also get there by train, or by taking a Niagara Falls day tour, which includes transport from Toronto.\n\nIn addition to the Falls, there are several attractions worth visiting in the Niagara region, such as the Niagara Parkway and Niagara-on-the-Lake, as well as various historic sites, parks, gardens and monuments.\n\nTaking a tour is the best way to see everything, as these key points of interest are included in most tours. Plus, the itinerary, timing and and transport will all be taken care of for you, making this the most convenient way to experience Niagara.\n\nIs Toronto a walkable city?\n\nYes, Toronto is a very walkable city, especially in its downtown core! Most of the city’s popular attractions, key shopping areas, top restaurants and entertainment venues are within walking distance of each other. Plus, the city has a well-developed grid system, making navigation on foot relatively straightforward.\n\nHowever, Toronto is a big city, and some neighbourhoods can be quite far away from each other. In such cases, my favourite way to get around is by cycling. Toronto has a great bike share program and there are bike lanes all around the city.\n\nOr, if you’re not a big fan of cycling, there are various public transport options in Toronto, with a Subway, streetcars and buses. And, if all else fails, there are always plenty of taxis around the city, or rideshare services you can use.\n\nIs Toronto or Vancouver better?\n\nThe choice between Toronto and Vancouver depends on your preferences and what you’re looking for in a destination. Personally, I love both cities and appreciate them for different reasons.\n\nToronto is known for its vibrant city life, diversity, food scene and huge variety of attractions and entertainment options. It’s a bustling metropolis with a mix of modern skyscrapers, historic neighbourhoods, art and culture. If you’re looking to see some of Canada’s most iconic sites and enjoy excellent food, nightlife and entertainment, then Toronto will likely suit you better.\n\nVancouver, on the other hand, offers a stunning natural setting on the ocean, surrounded by mountains in the background. The city is known for its outdoorsy lifestyle, with locals making the most of the waterfront, trails and sporting facilities. Plus, the surrounding mountains offer excellent snow sports, hiking and climbing.\n\nThe city itself also has several interesting attractions, but it isn’t as lively as Toronto and doesn’t have much of a late-night scene. When I’m in Vancouver, I always find that we have early nights and make the most of our daytime activities. Saying this, we also do plenty of daytime activities in Toronto! However, in Toronto, we usually start the day a little later in the morning and stay out later at night.\n\nOverall, if you prefer a mix of outdoor activities and a more laid-back urban environment, Vancouver will likely be more appealing to you. But, if you’re able to, I would highly recommend trying to visit both Vancouver and Toronto, as they’re both great in different ways.\n\nFinal Thoughts – Why Visit Toronto?\n\nSo, why visit Toronto? As you can see, there are plenty of great reasons why Toronto is worth visiting, and tons of things to do here!\n\nFrom the nightlife, culture and arts scene, to the wide range of attractions and interesting urban and natural landscapes, there is something for everyone.\n\nIt’s an ideal city to spend a weekend, or a great place to base yourself for longer as you explore more of Ontario. Plus, as Toronto is well-connected to the rest of the world, it’s likely that you will pass through here anyway on your Canadian travels.\n\nSo, hopefully this post has inspired you to stop off in Toronto and spend a few days exploring the city next time you visit Canada.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nIs Toronto Safe?
