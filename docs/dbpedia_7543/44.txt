Etobicoke Centre, Toronto’s Western Focal Point

Exciting new growth is coming to Etobicoke as this municipality has been designated an Urban Growth Centre (UGC) by the Ontario government. One of five UGCs in Toronto, Etobicoke is making strides toward implementing world-class transit infrastructure, stellar region-wide and institutional public service, as well as significant employment and population growth.

This district aims to develop into Toronto’s western mixed-use focal point. Conveniently located between Lester B. Pearson Airport and the Downtown core, Etobicoke is perfectly positioned to house the necessary growth needed to accommodate Ontario's rapidly increasing population. Increasing the concentration of housing and employment opportunities in Etobicoke will mean that the existing well-established public transit and additional infrastructure will be better utilized.

Etobicoke will become even more vibrant and lively. Its condensed mix of varied housing and employment will allow residents to walk or use public transit, run errands and get to work. Etobicoke Centre will act as a cultural hub, with recreational, social, and administrative facilities in Etobicoke. It will foster social interactions and create a tight-knit community identity in the municipality.

Growth Targets

In 2002, the Etobicoke Centre Secondary Plan and Zoning By-Law created guidelines that encouraged the urbanization and intensification of Etobicoke, resulting in a healthy development boom in recent years.

This UGC is about 165 hectares in size and seeks to increase the population and jobs of the region by 205%. To achieve its Growth Plan and Municipal Density Target, Etobicoke is expanding its gross density from 131 people and jobs per hectare in 2006 to 400 people and jobs per hectare by 2031.

The Secondary Plan and Zoning By-law allow densities between 2.0 times the lot area in low-density areas to 3.5 along the major arterial corridors and 5.0 at major transit stations. These densities will support Etobicoke’s transition into a pedestrian-friendly, transit-supportive community.

Based on current forecasts, Etobicoke is expected to reach 66,000 people and jobs by 2031, a considerable jump from 21,615 back in 2006 and a big step up from its minimum density target of 44,385. With such large strides made within the past several years, Etobicoke is set to become one of the province's most significant employment and housing powerhouses.

Vision

Etobicoke is working tirelessly to achieve a robust, transit-oriented, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use community where people can live, work, and play. Etobicoke Centre is transforming itself from an area of densely packed residential and office buildings near Bloor and Islington to an integrated, well-functioning district.

This area is well fit to house a dynamic blend of homes, jobs, amenities and commercial spaces as Etobicoke has two TTC subway stations and a GO transit station, not to mention beautiful widened sidewalks with lights and charming greenery. Etobicoke also boasts conveniently separated bicycle lanes. This excellent transportation infrastructure means that new residents will be well accommodated and have an easy time travelling across Toronto and the surrounding GTA.

Four key initiatives that Etobicoke Centre will carry out to archive its growth plan are:

Developing Community Identity

Creating a Livable Community

Creating a Climate for Reinvestment

Relocating Inter-Regional Transit Terminal Facilities

Developing Community Identity

To better establish Etobicoke's sense of identity, the region will promote itself to attract new visitors, investors, and businesses. This area plans to amplify the feeling of community spirit through public art, architecture, and shared spaces that will visually unify Etobicoke. This greater feeling of character will cement Etobicoke's place as the cultural and civic hot spot of Western Toronto and encourage further investment into the locale.

Creating a Livable Community

To satisfy a diverse and continuously increasing population, Etobicoke aims to become a comfortable and high-performing community that meets the needs of future and existing locals through a wide range of facilities and services. It plans to feature a range of public spaces where people can relax, celebrate, and connect.

Etobicoke will be adding more schools, parks, housing, recreation facilities, social services and transportation to its already extensive list of social infrastructure. There will be an increase in senior services, youth services, daycares, library facilities, immigration services, cultural programs, and healthcare facilities. A total of $251,900 has been invested in improving the Tom Riley Park North Tennis Court. Etobicoke also has plans for more sewers, roads, and water. The Community Service Strategy will help identify gaps in service and local capacities in order to set goals and priorities for improvements. Existing programs such as youth drop-ins will be expanded upon, and the number of community meeting areas and recreation spaces will be raised.

This well-built network of easily accessible, affordable, premium services that changes with time to better meet the community's needs will help ensure the safety, health and wellbeing of Etobicoke residents.

Natural heritage sites, green spaces and parks will upgrade the lives of Etobicoke residents, thus increasing the area's desirability. Etobicoke is adding new parks as well as enhancing and enlarging existing parkland. These green spaces will offer an oasis in the hustle and bustle of city life.

A Pedestrian Paradise

Newly added street and pedestrian-friendly blocks will encourage the creation of street-oriented developments and supply a connection to existing buildings. These well-connected streets and walkways will give this region a bustling atmosphere that lures people to city life. Eateries and shopping opportunities will line the road, further adding to the vibrancy of the municipality. Residents will find the street visually stimulating, with beautiful architecture and breathtaking public art. By creating highly functional streets, walking in Etobicoke will be an effective travel method and a safe and enjoyable affair.

A Soaring Locale

The Etobicoke Official Plan calls for further residential and business development to strengthen Etobicoke’s economy. In order to achieve the population growth targets, new housing will come in the form of mid-rise and high-rise towers. Additionally, zoning for the development around Kipling and Islington stations will allow for greater heights and densities. The Planning Act allows zoning bylaws that grant a height or density increase if the development provides community benefits. These benefits include re-using and preserving a heritage property, providing cultural or arts facilities, affordable housing, community services, and green spaces. This will increase housing units' availability and will improve Etobicoke's social infrastructure. Furthermore, the large scale of the new buildings will promote a sense of urban character within Etobicoke.

The intersections Bloor-Kipling and Bloor-Islington will be one of the hot stops for future development. Retail, parks, housing, and employment opportunities will all be steps away from local transit options.

Since 2002 when the Secondary Plan was implemented, more than 3,600 residential units have been proposed, went under construction, or have been built. Many development applications have been submitted and approved for significant portions of Dundas Street West west of Kipling, all of which propose great heights and densities.

Thus, the success of the Secondary Plan is evident to all who visit Etobicoke, but this municipality has just gotten started. Planned and approved future initiatives will continue to work towards Etobicoke’s vision of a stunning, harmonious hub.

Transportation

To become a cultural centre, Etobicoke must become a mobility hub with major public transit facilities that efficiently transport people in and out of the region. Etobicoke Centre already has a strong background of highly accessible local and regional transit that allows its residents and employees to get around quickly and easily. Islington and Kipling subway stations, the GO station, and the connection between TTC and Mississauga Transit bus routes are vital parts of Toronto’s west-end transportation network. However, in order to support its growing population, Etobicoke must further improve by catering to broader transportation needs.

A total of $1 million was put towards the Bloor-Islington Bridge rehabilitation that has been recently completed. In addition, Kipling and Islington stations, along with the other TTC stations, will be accessible by 2025.

Kipling Mobility Hub

A new mobility hub has been proposed by Metrolinx at Line 2’s Kipling Station.

This development will relocate most of the bus traffic from Islington Station and place the TTC, GO, and Mississauga Transit into a single location. This project will positively impact Etobicoke Centre by making more room around Islington station, and creating space for redevelopment. It also allows for sustained growth and better travel. A total of $8 million has been invested into the TTC Kipling Interregional Bus Terminal, and $12 million is being put towards the station’s east entrance and passenger pick-up and drop-off.

10-Year Capital Plan

The 2010 Capital Budget and 10-year Capital Plan established several projects to enhance Etobicoke’s public realm and streetscape. Some projects include the Bloor-Islington Bridge rehabilitation, adding the inter-regional bus terminal at Kipling Station and improving access to the station, along with the Six Points Interchange redevelopment that will create new roadways to provide better transit accessibility to jobs, housing and services.

Education

Etobicoke is not only a hot spot for new commercial development and condos, but also has the perk of being home to two top-rated post-secondary academic institutions, Humber College, Canada’s sixth-best research college, and the University of Guelph-Humber, where students can get both a degree and a diploma during a four program.

Humber College and the University of Guelph-Humber have a combined student population of 23,900, which creates important investment opportunities renting units to students that want to live closer to campus.

In 2020, the Ontario government announced that they would invest over $62.4 million towards building two secondary schools in Etobicoke. These new schools will support over 2,000 students and will come equipped with modern classrooms, and state-of-the-art technology to ensure students have access to the latest teaching methods.

This funding will be divided into $36 million given to the Toronto Catholic District School Board to construct a replacement facility for Bishop Allen Academy that will accommodate about 1,300 students and $26.4 million allocated to developing a new Catholic secondary school in central Etobicoke.

New school facilities will encourage young families to make the move to Etobicoke, increasing the population and workforce. With many new investments underway to make Etobicoke Centre a desirable place to live, work and play, Etobicoke will be a great opportunity for investors.

This employment region has excellent access to rail, air, and highway transportation, making it the perfect candidate for future growth.

Major employment sectors include manufacturing, warehousing and wholesale trade, business, accommodation and food services, construction, professional, scientific and technical services, and retail. Woodbine Entertainment Group is the largest employer here.

Employment continues to increase steadily in this area, reaching 45,000 jobs in 2019, an increase of 10.8% since 2011. About half of this growth can be attributed to the rise of business, building and other support service sectors in the area.

Old office buildings are being replaced or transformed into top-of-the-line industrial facilities.
