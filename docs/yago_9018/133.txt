It’s All Gone Pete Tong is a 2004 mokumentary / comedy film directed & written by Michael Dowse and starring Paul Kaye. It details the story of Frankie Wilde – a British music producer and DJ in Ibiza Spain – who goes completely deaf at the peak of his career. The film includes cameos from Carl Cox, Pete Tong, Tiesto, Sarah Main, Paul van Dyk and many others, and features a massive soundtrack from artists like The Beata Band, Reflekt / Deline Bass, Trisco, Ferry Corsten, The Beach Boys, Schwab and a score by Graham Massey of 808 State.

McCann was Supervising Sound Designer and Music Editor for the film, responsible for creating all the DJ sets, and conceptualizing the overall sound of the movie including Frankie Wilde’s descent into deafness. McCann also contributed additional music to the score, including the ambient track that opens the film, and (along with Gordon Hoshimoto) that awful EDM track Frankie makes when going deaf.

McCann and the entire audio team were nominated and won multiple awards including 2 Leo Awards and 2 Genie nominations. The film went on to win the Jury Award at the US Comedy Arts Festival, Best Canadian Feature at the Toronto International Film Festival, Audience Award & Best Feature at the Gen Art Film Festival, a “Best Achievement in Production” BIFA nomination and a total of 8 Genie nominations.
