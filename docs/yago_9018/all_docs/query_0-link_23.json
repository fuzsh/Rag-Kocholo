        "text": "Born into an Irish immigrant family and raised in Calgary, Michael Dowse has been making award-winning films for the last ten years. After graduating with an M.B.A. from Yale business school, he started out as a director of short films, commercials and music videos. He also worked as a film editor on John Hazlett's Bad Money (1999), and Matt Bissonnette and Steve Clark's Looking for Leonard (2000). His short film 237 (2000) was followed by his feature debut, Fubar (2002), which he wrote, edited, produced, shot and directed. Fubar became a cult hit in Canada, was released around the world and earned Dowse a Genie nomination for best editing. His follow-up, the raucous faux biopic It's All Gone Pete Tong, premiered at the Toronto International Film FestivalÂ®, where it won the City TV award for Best Canadian Feature Film. It was also named one of Canada's Top Ten of 2004 by an independent, national panel of filmmakers, programmers, journalists and industry professionals."
