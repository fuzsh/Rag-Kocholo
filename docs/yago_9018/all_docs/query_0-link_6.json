        "text": "”You and me, we got the same hobby”\n\nI’ll see your Sound of Metal, and raise you several Beats-Per-Minute.\n\nRewatching this criminally under-seen movie after ‘Sound of Metal’ makes it feel like a hip underground remix of a song everyone’s listening to on the radio.\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that I like this lost treasure way more than the average viewer. Perhaps it’s the ex-DJ in me, or maybe it’s just my bizarre sense of humor, but this film cracks me up and even makes me feel sympathy for a completely unlikable protagonist. Plus the soundtrack is bumping!\n\nBONUS POINTS for the Coke Badger in the ballerina outfit, which has got to be the best representation of a drug demon ever committed to celluloid.\n\n”It’s brilliant to almost hear that”\n\nCinematic Playlist - “I’m with the Band”\n\nCinematic Time Capsule - 2004 Ranked\n\nLong Live Physical Media\n\nTotal unadulterated chaos at Baz Luhrmann ADD speed with SO MUCH booze & blow you fear getting wasted via visual osmosis. Frankie Wilde is untamable spectacle, batshit insane, making any addiction flick I’ve ever seen feel like an evening stroll.\n\nSuper bleak, super dark mockumentary style commentary on showbiz/superstar DJ culture ping-ponging between kinetic madness & visceral suffering. It’s All Gone Pete Tong goes HARD, is what I’m saying, and only lets up to deliver quieter moments of sheer agony & pain.\n\nAnd somehow, it’s kind of hilarious at times, too. Shout-out to Mike Wilmot as Frankie’s perpetually sweaty agent Max whose scene-stealing larger-than-lifeness is second only to the Coke Badger. Who is the Coke Badger, you ask? Let’s hope we never really find out, kids. Nightmare fuel for days.\n\nWhat begins as ugly (that cocaine clinger...) and unbearable quickly becomes sweet and life-affirming.\n\nMy cousin, Mia, whom I very much look up to, recommended this to me a while back when she would drive my ass to and from work at the (then) Scotiabank Place, where I ran overpriced beer to the club seats—a job she kindly got me to help me pay my way through university. Mia, being a massive Dance fan, would always have the latest Pete Tong's Essential Mix on, and often extolled this film as both a fantastic satirical skewering of, and love letter to the industry, shouting over whatever fresh percussive blitz pulsed through her Kia Soul while I clung to the passenger side…\n\nI had totally forgot just how funny this was. The cocaine badger is the boss! It is even rather insightful, and I love the way it's made to look like a documentary with \"talking heads\".\n\nSome brilliant moments and some good laughs counterbalanced by some heavy and depressing drama. Peter Kaye gives a masterful performance, and carries the film brilliantly.\n\nFunny, tragic, but in the end, quite uplifting. A missed little gem!\n\nStarted off thinking this would be a sort of Proto-Popstar following the antics and misdeeds of a out of control celebrity, but It's All Gone Pete Tong goes far deeper than that. Shifting between drama and comedy in a askew version of our own world making for a hillarious and somewhat endearing experience. By no means the perfect mockumentary but when it sticks the landing, it really fucking sticks the landing. Best to go into this blind."
