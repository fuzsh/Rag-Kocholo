        "text": "In this send-up-cum-celebration of rave scene excess, English comedian Paul Kaye pulls out all the stops as Frankie Wilde, a deranged Cockney exile who scratches and mixes his way to club-scene stardom in the über-trendy Spanish resort island of Ibiza. As other (genuine) jet-setting DJs and partiers gladly testify in the movie (and on the equally reliable websites that support it), Frankie’s hard-driving dance mixes, maniacal stage antics and soccer-hooligan fashion sense revolutionised Ibiza nightlife in the late 90s, while his coke habit revolutionised the economy of Colombia. But sooner or later people had to notice that Frankie had become very, very deaf. In Pete Tong’s and Paul Kay’s sweetest comic coup, Frankie’s deafness cements the legend, and you feel pleased for the guy. The soundtrack is for real, a first-rate dance mix.\n\n“This is a crazily energetic evocation of an amped-up subculture, telling a crazier story still. 24 Hour Party People fans willing to go along with a joke will rightfully lap it up.” — Glenn Kenny, Premiere"
