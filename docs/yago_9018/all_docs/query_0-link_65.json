        "text": "IT’S ALL GONE PETE TONG is a sad comedy about a European dancehall DJ who goes deaf, thereby losing his ability to do the only thing he loves and the only thing he’s good at doing.\n\nFrankie Wilde is an English-born DJ who finds success in the party hotspot of Ibiza, Spain. His popular status in the club scene allows him a luxury house, a beautiful (if dim) wife, and a life of leisure. His life is fast paced and drug fueled. As he begins to produce records and continues working at clubs, Frankie’s hearing ability worsens. He gets nervous but thinks he can fake it. He even attempts one DJ gig without most of his hearing, selecting records purely by impulse and memory.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Frankie doesn’t fool anyone, and soon he loses his reputation as a DJ. His shallow wife leaves him, his hearing goes completely, and he has nothing to turn to but drugs and alcohol. Frankie locks barricades himself in his house for almost a year, relying on delivery men for food, spending the whole time in a stupor. He emerges to kill himself, but just before completing the deed, he has an epiphany. He realizes that his life can continue, even without hearing.\n\nFrankie solicits someone to teach him sign language and lip reading. To complete the picture, he falls in love with his teacher. Together, they have a child and, essentially, live happily ever after.\n\nMost of the characters in IT’S ALL GONE PETE TONG are addicted to drugs and alcohol and live aimless lives that center on pleasure. Frankie’s marriage is especially depressing since his wife constantly cheats on him, and in one scene, Frankie and his wife make out with other people in front of each other.\n\nThe movie has the feel of a music documentary, which drains away energy and momentum from the story. Overall, PETE TONG has very little positive qualities to offer and a lot of extremely negative ones. The movie’s redemptive elements prove, however, that a godless, humanist worldview is unbearable. Despite all the tragedy life often has to offer, even a humanist needs to have faith in something, even a humanist can’t overlook the beautiful things and positive moral values that God has provided for us in His universe."
