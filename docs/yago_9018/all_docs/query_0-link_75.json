        "text": "It's All Gone Pete Tong (a commonly-used Cockney expression for \"it's all gone wrong\") begins as an irreverent look at the life of a world-famous dance party DJ -- with the requisite wild parties, excesses and pitfalls that accompany fame and power. The story then takes an unexpected turn, and ends up a redemptive study of a music pioneer who, against fate, finds a whole new rhythm for his life.\n\nAt the height of his career, DJ Frankie Wilde, played by British comedian Paul Kaye, suffers the ultimate occupational hazard: he goes completely deaf. Frankie loses his wife, record deal and, most tragically, his music, finally isolating himself in his villa under a pile of self-pity and a mountain of drugs.\n\nBut Frankie meets the enchanting Penelope (Beatriz Batarda), who opens him up to a whole new world and reconnects Frankie with the almighty beat that had defined him. Frankie's return to the top of the scene and his eventual disappearance is the stuff of legends."
