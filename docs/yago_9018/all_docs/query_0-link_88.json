        "text": "The F word is a romantic comedy filmed in Toronto directed by Canadian Michael Dowse (Goon) starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rafe Spall, Zoe Kazan and Adam Driver. It has been dubbed the perfect date movie.\n\nMichael Dowse joins a number of Canadian directors including Atom Egoyan (Devil’s Knot), Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners, Enemy), Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club), Xavier Dolan (Tom a la Ferme), Bruce La Bruce (Gerontophilia) and Michael Dowse (The F Word) who have films at TIFF this year.\n\nWith The F Word, Michael Dowse delivers a delightful film with a colorful script, sprinkled with humor. The story starts when Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter) meets Chantry (Zoe Karan) at a party, he immediately falls under her spell, before learning to his dismay that she already has a boyfriend. Wallace tried to move on with his life but Chantry keeps crossing his path and the two develop a symbiotic relationship, gradually finding themselves faced with a big question: just friends or lovers?\n\nThe setting establishes Toronto as a city that is lively and engaging, comparable to other North American world class cities. The story is well constructed; the fun palpable. The on screen chemistry between Radcliff and Kazan really works.The F Word is sure to hit a soft spot in many of us.\n\nDowse began his career as an editor and directing short films and music videos. In 2000 Fubar, his first feature, opened Midnight Madness at the Sundance Film Festival. Its All Gone Pete Tong, Dowse’s second feature, won the City Award at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival, and Best Film at both HBO’s Aspen Comedy Festival and the Gen Art Film Festival in New York. Recent films include Fubar II, which opened Midnight Madness at TIFF13 in 2010, Take Me Home Tonight, released by Relativity Media in 2011, and Goon, the top grossing Canadian film of 2012. The F Word is Michael’s sixth feature film.\n\nChristophe Chanel"
