        "text": "“Stuber” is a fair depiction of American life in 2019. Stu (Kumail Nanjiani) is forced to work two jobs: days at an outdoor supply company and nights as an Uber driver (the film’s title is a portmanteau-Stu plus Uber). In the course of his labor, Stu’s dragged into a cycle of senseless violence all while slowly roasting on a warming planet.\n\nGrizzled LAPD detective Vic (Dave Bautista) also has a lot of problems, the most pressing of which is a Lasik eye surgery that leaves him nearly blind. When he gets a tip on a location for his sworn enemy, Tedjo (Iko Uwais), he promptly crashes his old gas guzzler and has to Uber it-enter Stu, with electric car. Vic, unfamiliar with the ridesharing, sits in the front seat, which Stu takes to mean that he’s DTT (down to talk), and yammers a blue streak in a desperate attempt to climb to a five-star rating.\n\nThey doggedly follow the trail of Vic’s nemesis Tedjo, a villain strong in hand-to-hand combat and heroin sales. Perhaps Vic’s still enraged that he lost his best chance to arrest his perp when Tedjo used the exact same getaway plan as Ryan Gosling in “Drive” (melting into the crowd after a Clippers game outside Staples Center).\n\nStu and Vic’s odyssey that takes them all over Los Angeles from Compton (Stu comments, “This place is not gentrified at all!”) to San Pedro and they have a successful odd couple vibe in the style of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan in “Rush Hour.”\n\nWhen not dodging bullets, Stu is in constant FaceTime contact with his platonic friend and new business partner Becca (Betty Gilpin). He wants to get her into bed, “When Harry Met Sally” style, and escape the friend zone. She wants his money to start a women-only indoor biking school called Spinster.\n\nVic insists on a detour to see his daughter Nicole (Natalie Morales), a sculptor, at her art opening (she is favorably compared to “a young Richard Serra” by one attendee). She has a good chat with Stu where she points out that Spinster is a terrible name for a Soul Cycle knockoff and they might as well call it “Old Hag Bikes.”\n\nThe leads engage in physical comedy that’s occasionally very amusing, as when Mr. Bautista gets several fishing lures hooked on his howling mug. It’s nice to see him without the blue skin he wears in the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, though he remains an odd-looking man-rather like Steven Seagal, if he were mangled going through a car crusher machine.\n\nDirector Michael Dowse, while not quite emulating the visual verve of Michael Mann in the similarly car-bound L.A. story “Collateral,” at least keeps things moving at a brisk pace. Your mileage may vary, but the oddness of the central pair and a sprinkling of strong gags gets you from A to B pleasantly enough."
