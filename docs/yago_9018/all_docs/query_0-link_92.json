Greenlighted in April, FUBAR II, the sequel to the 2002 Sundance film FUBAR began shooting Monday in the Tar Sands of Alberta.\n\nFUBAR is the largely improvised 2002 mockumentary about headbangers directed by Michael Dowse (who also wrote and directed 'It's All Gone Pete Tong', and gave us the surreally terrifying mascot for the perils of drug addiction, the Coke Badger - NSFW).\n\nA labor of love, the film was funded largely by the credit cards of Dowse, his friends and his family, many of whom helped in the production of the film. His father took a second mortgage on his house to help pay for the film's $400,000 budget. The movie was hand-edited with manual splicing equipment. All of which paid off; it won a Genie award for the editing and launched Dowse's career (though learning editing by working at MuchMusic probably helped).\n\nCo-writers Paul Spence (Deaner) and David Lawrence (Terry), will reprise the improv roles that were part of the inspiration for the film. Lawrence and Spence's chemistry comes honestly; from experience. They grew up a few houses apart, both attended the Loose Moose Children's Theatre (where they first developed the Dean and Terry characters) and they've worked together in other projects.\n\nThe Loose Moose is where the improv technique of Theatresports originated, and has produced its share of talent including Mark McKinney and Bruce McCulloch from Kids in the Hall, Norm Hiscock (producer on Corner Gas, Parks and Recreation and King of the Hill), and Veena Sood.\n\nAbout MetaFilter\n\nMetaFilter is a weblog that anyone can contribute a link or a comment to.
