Marco Ferreri was simply the most punk Italian filmmaker of his generation. A cine-provocateur of the highest order, Ferreri developed an oeuvre that is one of the most eclectic and surprising in all of Italian cinema, composed largely of black-as-night social satires and uncannily affecting dramas. From his earliest features—produced in Spain—to the vital skewerings of the European bourgeoisie he made upon returning for a long, prolific run in the Italian film industry (such as the 1969 Dillinger Is Dead and the 1973 La Grande Bouffe), Ferreri’s films take a delirious and critical view of the times in which he lived and worked and remain some of the funniest, darkest, and most thought-provoking works of their era. Join Film at Lincoln Center and Cinecittà for a rare opportunity to spend time with Ferreri’s tales of ordinary madness in this extensive career retrospective of one of world cinema’s most indelible enfants terribles.

Highlights include Ferreri’s third feature The Little Coach, starring the famous comic actor José Isbert, which established young Ferreri as a European master of black humor; The Ape Woman, which underwent harsh censorship and is now presented with its three different endings: the one dictated by Italian censorship, the one provided by the French producers, and the one that Ferreri and his accomplice and co-writer, Rafael Azcona, had written; The Man with the Balloons, the virtuoso depiction of a sudden fall into the absurdity of life, starring a flamboyant Marcello Mastroianni at his best; Dillinger Is Dead, a mix of pop art and existentialist philosophy and one of Ferreri’s most famous films; La Grande Bouffe, one of Ferreri’s signature films, which is best remembered for causing one of the biggest scandals of the Cannes Film Festival but whose public success made it an immediate cult classic; Bye Bye Monkey, Ferreri’s first film shot in the United States, starring Gérard Depardieu and Marcello Mastroianni as two men trying to cope with the decline of man and the rise of woman; and the 1980 Berlinale Silver Bear–winning film Seeking Asylum, one of Ferreri’s gentlest films, starring Roberto Benigni as a kindergarten teacher who falls in love with the mother of one of his students.

Organized by Florence Almozini and Dan Sullivan of Film at Lincoln Center and by Camilla Cormanni and Paola Ruggiero of Cinecittà. Co-produced by Cinecittà, Rome. Film descriptions by Gabriela Trujillo, author of Marco Ferreri: Le cinéma ne sert à rien (Capricci, 2021).

The Little Coach

Ferreri’s third feature, and the last he directed under the Franco regime in Spain, about an old man who wishes to buy an electric scooter, established him as a European master of black humor.

The Conjugal Bed

Starring Marina Vlady as a newlywed who wants to have a baby and Ugo Tognazzi as her boorish husband, The Conjugal Bed is an implacable parable about maternal desire as dictated by society and religion to all women.

The Ape Woman

In Ferreri’s unforgettable polemical tale set in the circus world, Annie Girardot stars as Maria, an extremely shy orphan living in a convent who is almost totally covered with hair—and who marries an enterprising showman.

The Wedding March

A wedding march in four sketches rich with bravura and caustic humor, written for the legendary Italian actor Ugo Tognazzi, Ferreri’s longtime collaborator.

The Man with the Balloons

One evening, a successful industrial manager (Marcello Mastroianni) finds himself asking: How much air can a balloon contain? He will seek the answer through the night as this odd question grows into a desperate and increasingly metaphysical quest.

Dillinger Is Dead

Presented on 35mm

A mix of pop art and existentialist philosophy, Dillinger Is Dead, about the nocturnal wandering of an industrial designer on the brink, is one of Ferreri’s most famous films—and probably his greatest masterpiece.

The Seed of Man

Presented on 35mm

In one of Ferreri’s most desperate films, the survivors of a plague that has eradicated almost all of humankind (Anne Wiazemsky and Marzio Margine) need to decide whether they should have a child or refuse to repopulate a toxic planet.

L’udienza

An exemplary work of absurdist cinema, L’udienza follows a furloughed young soldier’s efforts to confess a terrible secret to the pope, leading him to meet an assortment of wild characters (portrayed by Claudia Cardinale, Michel Piccoli, and others).

La Grande Bouffe

In one of Ferreri’s signature films, four rich men (Marcello Mastroianni, Philippe Noiret, Michel Piccoli, and Ugo Tognazzi) gather in a magnificent Parisian villa for a gastronomic blowout—but, in fact, they have decided to die together.

Don’t Touch the White Woman!

Presented on 35mm

A burlesque and anachronic revisiting of the Battle of Little Bighorn transposed to the center of Paris, Ferreri’s political farce lights the fuse of a glorious icon of American mythology.

The Last Woman

Presented on 35mm

Among Ferreri’s most underrated films, The Last Woman follows a tragic romance between a single father (Gérard Depardieu) and his child’s young caregiver (Ornella Muti).

Bye Bye Monkey

Presented on 35mm

In Ferreri’s first film shot in the United States, Gérard Depardieu and Marcello Mastroianni star as two men trying to understand the world in which they live and coping with the decline of man and the rise of woman.

Seeking Asylum

Presented on 35mm

One of Ferreri’s gentlest films, this 1980 Berlinale Silver Bear–winning film stars Roberto Benigni as a kindergarten teacher who falls in love with the mother of one of his students.

Tales of Ordinary Madness

Presented on 35mm

In Ferreri’s radical portrait of an artist, inspired by the short stories of Charles Bukowski, Ben Gazzara stars as a drunken poet who wanders the streets of Los Angeles.

The Future Is Woman

Presented on 35mm

Ferreri’s long-standing engagement with the feminism of his day finds one of its strongest expressions in this film about a love triangle, starring Hanna Schygulla, Niels Arestrup, and a pregnant Ornella Muti.

How Good Are the Whites

A humanitarian organization sends six trucks loaded up with supplies and provisions to combat starvation in the Sahel desert—but the true colors of the group’s volunteers are revealed when they yield to their pettiest, most selfish impulses.

The House of Smiles

Presented on 35mm

Adelina (Ingrid Thulin), once crowned a beauty queen, has lost her teeth in the nursing home. She falls in love with another patient, and their mutual desire shocks all of the home’s young nurses and employees.

The Flesh

In Ferreri’s last romantic masterpiece, a down-on-his-luck piano player in a bar meets the perfect woman and begins an intense love affair, only for her to decide abruptly to leave him.

Diary of a Maniac

Presented on 35mm

In Ferreri’s final fiction feature, a middle-aged, half-broke salesman becomes convinced that his meticulously maintained diary could become a literary masterpiece.
