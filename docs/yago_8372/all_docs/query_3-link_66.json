        "text": "It’s that time again! A classic Lupin III television special, as voted by you - the fans - has been uploaded to YouTube in the United States for a limited time!\n\nBye Bye, Lady Liberty, the first ever Lupin III special (released in Japan during 1989), can now be viewed for those within the U.S. throughout the month of April, 2024.\n\nIf you are living within the U.S., you can catch it from April 5th through to May 2nd. Please note that this particular upload has Japanese language audio with English subtitles only.\n\nWith the development of information networks, Lupin's information has been accumulated in databases all over the world, and all his behavior patterns have come to be predicted. Jigen with his old friend Rooster brings a new job to Lupin, who is thinking of retiring. However, a mysterious secret society, Three Mason, appears in the hiding place and Rooster is shot dead while he escapes. With Rooster's last words in mind, Lupin and Jigen vow to steal the world's largest diamond hidden in the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWhile it’s been a few years since I last saw it, Bye Bye, Lady Liberty is a fun Lupin special that is well worth your time. There are some silly moments between Lupin and Inspector Zenigata - which are always a highlight for me in any Lupin content - and despite its age, the animation and story holds up. If you’re familiar with the characters or show and want to get into the longer movies, this is an ideal starting point!"
