        "text": "The protagonist, a swindler who lives by his wits, discovers a young bearded woman in a religious institute run by nuns. Pretty, but bearded. This knight of industry, as they used to be called, persuades her to go with him; he leads her into a vulgar fiction, and makes money staging a show for fools. Obviously, the swindler has made a one-sided deal with his victim: she works hard on stage and at home, he collects the money.\n\nAt Cannes they booed and yelled, because the French didn’t like a hairy Annie Girardot. They thought she was in bad taste. [...] When it came out they said it was badly made. What does it mean that it was badly made? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? No idea! I don’t make distinctions between the genres: you laugh when you laugh. There are dramas that turn into comedies, comedies that turn into dramas."
