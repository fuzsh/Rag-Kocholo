        "text": "World-renowned for his experimental and sometimes controversial pieces, Marco Ferreri offers his unique interpretation of modern rugs in his addition to Sahrai’s Designers Selection. Combining graphical imagery and geometric patterning, this range is an eye-catching display of artistry-made-functional – with flair.\n\nFerreri’s Selection is comprised of six designs, and each piece makes a statement. Purposefully bold, Ferreri has captured the spirit of the rug and interpreted it into an instantly recognisable style. A genuinely unique range, Ferreri’s collaboration with Sahrai demonstrates why Sahrai is a leader in innovation amongst luxury carpet brands.\n\nGRAPHIC STYLES\n\nThe circular Stone rugs deliver a modern take on classic style, while the lifelike Elephant and Crocodile designs express the beauty of these animals in graphical form. These contemporary area rugs are exquisitely designed as functional art at its finest.\n\nABOUT THE DESIGNER\n\nBorn 26th February 1958 in Imperia Italy, Marco Ferreri is one of the masters of his trade, being described by Silvana Annicchiarico, Curator of the Milan Triennale as, “The key link between the generation of Masters and Nouvelle Vague.”\n\nHe graduated from the Politecnico of Milan in 1981. His fields of design research range from industrial to graphic design, and from architecture to installations.\n\nFerreri exhibits in significant collections, such as the Permanent Design Collection at the MOMA in New York, the Permanent Design Collection of the Israel Museum of Jerusalem, and the Collection du Fond National d’Art Contemporain of Paris.\n\nHis work has been highly acclaimed, with pieces such as ‘Less Chair’ and the ‘Libroletto’ (designed with Bruno Munari) having been selected for the Compasso d’Oro. Ferreri’s broom, ‘Titi’, won the Design Plus 2000 Award, and in 2002 his ‘Foglia’ chair was selected for the Red Dot Award.\n\nIn 2010, the Milan Triennale held a monographic exhibition entitled ‘Marco Ferreri_progettarepensieri’ (Marco Ferreri_DesignThoughts).\n\nAlways pushing forward innovation for himself and the next generation of designers, Marco Ferreri recently travelled to Mumbai and Cologne as the Ambassador for Italian Design Day in the World (2018).\n\nBringing his innovative take on Modern Art and the future of design to the Sahrai collection, Ferreri’s range offers eye-catching statement pieces that work in harmony with modern chic aesthetics as well as more traditional rooms."
