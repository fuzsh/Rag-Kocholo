        "text": "The Care Bears Movie was the first Care Bears feature film of the franchise. It was released on March 29, 1985.\n\nMovie Summary[]\n\nMr. and Mrs. Cherrywood are a middle-aged couple who run an orphanage. Mr. Cherrywood tells the orphans a story about the Care Bears and their home in the clouds called Care-A-Lot.\n\nAs the story starts, two of the Care Bears (Friend Bear and Secret Bear) travel around the Earth to cheer people up.\n\nThey soon meet two orphaned children named Kim and Jason, who lost their parents in the car accident. Friend and Secret introduce themselves and remind the children of their ambitions; neither of them takes interest.\n\nMeanwhile, at an amusement park, another Care Bear, Tenderheart, spots a magician's apprentice named Nicholas. While unloading a trunk of goods for his master, the \"Great Fettucini\", Nicholas finds an old book with a diary-style lock on it.\n\nWhen he unlocks the book, an evil spirit appears as a woman's face and starts corrupting his mind. With Nicholas' help, the spirit lays waste to the amusement park and begins a quest to remove all caring from the world.\n\nBack at Care-a-lot, some of the other bears are working on their new invention: the Rainbow Rescue Beam, a portal that can send any Bear to Earth and back in an instant. The two youngest bears, Baby Hugs and Baby Tugs interfere with the machine and bring forth a group of unexpected visitors—Friend Bear, Secret Bear, Kim, and Jason.\n\nThe Bears introduce themselves to the children and give them a tour of their home. Tenderheart soon returns before a \"Cloud Quake\", an earthquake-like disaster, ruins Care-a-lot due to The Spirit. Tenderheart informs the others of Nicholas' troubles on Earth.\n\nBringing them to the Rescue Beam, he sends Kim and Jason to the park, along with Friend Bear and Secret Bear. The four of them end up in the Forest of Feelings after the portal malfunctions. From a nearby river in the clouds, the rest of the Care Bears begin searching for the group aboard the Cloud Clipper.\n\nWithin the Forest, the children and their friends are introduced to Brave Heart Lion and Playful Heart Monkey, two of the Care Bear Cousins. Later on, the other Bears discover more of the cousins, among them Cozy Heart Penguin, Lotsa Heart Elephant, Swift Heart Rabbit, and Bright Heart Raccoon.\n\nDuring their stay, the spirit attacks them in several guises—as a spearfish, a tree, and an eagle. After the Care Bears and the Cousins defeat them, the friends venture back to Earth to save Nicholas from the spirit's influence.\n\nAt the park, Nicholas obtains the ingredients for his spell against the children and the creatures. After he casts it, the Care Bears and Cousins engage in a long battle against him.\n\nThe bears shoot beams of bright light towards him, forming their \"Stare\"; the Cousins help with their Call. As their power drains, Nicholas and the spirit briefly regain control.\n\nBut after Kim and Jason assist him, the apprentice finally realizes his misdeeds; with Secret Bear's help, he closes the spirit's face back into the book and saves himself, the park, and the world.\n\nNicholas thanks the group and reunites with Fettucini while Tenderheart Bear inducts the Care Bear Cousins into the Care Bear Family, and Kim & Jason find new parents at one of Nicholas' shows.\n\nAfter Mr. Cherrywood finishes his story and looks over the orphans, his wife reveals his first name, Nicholas, before the two head off to sleep. Tenderheart Bear, who had been listening from outside the window, giggles and returns to Care-a-lot in his Cloud Mobile.\n\nThe film ends with most members of the Care Bear Family waving good-bye.\n\nGallery[]\n\nCast[]\n\nMickey Rooney as the voice of Mr. Cherrywood\n\nJackie Burroughs as the voice of The Spirit\n\nGeorgia Engel as the voice of Love-a-Lot Bear\n\nSunny Besen Thrasher as the voice of Jason\n\nEva Almos - Friend Bear & Swift Heart Rabbit\n\nPatrice Black - Share Bear & Funshine Bear\n\nMelleny Brown - Cheer Bear & Baby Tugs Bear\n\nBobby Dermer - Grumpy Bear\n\nJayne Eastwood - Birthday Bear\n\nAnni Evans - Secret Bear & Champ Bear\n\nGloria Figura - Bedtime Bear\n\nCree Summer Francks - Kim\n\nBrian George - The Great Fettucini\n\nJanet-Laine Green - Wish Bear\n\nLuba Goy - Lotsa Heart Elephant & Gentle Heart Lamb\n\nTerri Hawkes - Baby Hugs Bear\n\nDan Hennessey - Brave Heart Lion\n\nJim Henshaw - Bright Heart Raccoon\n\nHadley Kay - Nicholas\n\nMarla Lukofsky - Good Luck Bear & Playful Heart Monkey\n\nPauline Rennie - Grams Bear & Cozy Heart Penguin\n\nBillie Mae Richards - Tenderheart Bear & Mrs. Cherrywood\n\nBrent Titcomb - Additional Voices\n\nReception[]\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. While the film resonated well with a smaller audience, many have criticized the film for being too childish and underdeveloped for the big screen. It’s been said that the film would’ve worked better as an extended Saturday morning cartoon for television rather than a theatrical motion picture.\n\nHowever, the film was an unexpected box-office success grossing up to $34 million worldwide on a $2 million budget which saved Nelvana’s studio from shutting down.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Care Bears Movie is the only 1980s theatrical movie of the franchise that was released on DVD more than once, as it was considered successfully marketed. Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation was only released once on DVD back in 2003, as it wasn't nearly successful due to the frightening themes that were regarded by parents. The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland never made it on DVD in North America at all, as it was considered a marketing failure.\n\n\"Strawberry Shortcake Meets the Berrykins\" is a theatrical featurette, played before the Care Bears when first released in theatres. It was later, also included on VHS of The Care Bears Movie.\n\nSee Also[]"
