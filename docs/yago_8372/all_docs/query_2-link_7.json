First foray into film work was filming commercials, and as promoter of a cinema magazine. Worked in Spain from 1957, making his directorial debut there.\n\nMany of his films are black comedies or satirical observations of social conventions and middle-class sexual mores. He was at times criticised for his stridently bleak view of human nature."
