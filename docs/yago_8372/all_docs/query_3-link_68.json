        "text": "The Bye Bye Man is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen and the best advice I can give any cinephile thinking about watching this film is, \"Don't think it. Don't Say it. Don't See it.\"\n\nJanuary 31, 2023\n\nIt never quite develops itself nor does it explain a lot of avoidable mistakes. It's one of those films that is so painful to watch that you wonder, did they make it this bad on purpose?\n\nJanuary 2, 2021\n\n\"The Bye Bye Man\" is one of those movies that takes on a completely different meaning when you know its backstory.\n\nSeptember 27, 2020\n\nThe opening scene is legitimately fantastic, but the rest of the movie falls far, far short of that.\n\nJuly 2, 2020\n\nNot only can the movie not keep track of its own mythology, every clich√© is trotted out, and it seems to be borrowing from anywhere and everywhere too.\n\nOctober 7, 2019"
