Men are stupid.\n\nAndreas Flaxman: Ah, during the time if Julius Caesar rodents were the cause of starvation among the populace. Bear this in mind, Lafayette, civilizations fade away, but the rats remain. The future belongs to the rats!\n\nGerard Lafayette: You put Nixon's head upon Nero's body. I saw up there.\n\nAndreas Flaxman: There is history and there is compromise. Sometimes the two flow together, and we have what is called historical compromise.\n\nAndreas Flaxman: Look, can't you see he already considers you his father? Listen to me, Lafayette. Get rid of it before it's too late. Listen to the voice of reason. Ah, ah, ah, ah!\n\n[Lafayette stops picking his nose]\n\nAndreas Flaxman: Mon frere, get rid of it.\n\nGerard Lafayette: [saddened] Sure.\n\nAndreas Flaxman: [gently] Forget the dictates of your heart.\n\n[Lafayette tearfully shakes his head no]\n\nSchoolboy with baseball cap: [seeing the chimp] Boy, you shouldn't have that! It's an endangered species.\n\nAndreas Flaxman: [nastily] Really? Well, if you don't get out of here, you're going to be an endangered species.\n\nAndreas Flaxman: [as Luigi leaves] Out! Out! Never come back!\n\nLuigi Nocello: [returning, he brandishes his cane] You are worse than... than a judge, worse than a cop, worse than a policeman!
