        "text": "no stars out of\n\nDon't Touch the White Woman (July 14/09)\n\nA sure candidate for the worst movie ever made, Don't Touch the White Woman details the events surrounding Custer's Last Stand - with filmmaker Marco Ferreri's expectedly irreverent sensibilities transforming what could've been an intriguing endeavor into a relentlessly obnoxious and flat-out unwatchable film-school experiment. Ferreri's notorious incompetence is reflected in virtually every frame of the proceedings, as the director mixes contemporary and historical elements - ie Nixon is President and characters wander around in sweats, yet Custer sports his full regalia and travels by horse - for reasons that are never made entirely clear. It's consequently impossible not to wonder just what the point of all this is, with the woefully nonsensical atmosphere exacerbated by a persistent emphasis on some of the ugliest visuals ever committed to celluloid (ie your garden-variety home movie possesses more impressive production values than this utterly worthless piece of work). And though it boasts an admittedly strong cast (including Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, and Catherine Deneuve), Don't Touch the White Woman remains a hopelessly (and aggressively) interminable experience from start to finish - with Ferreri's staggering lack of talent cementing his place as a hack of the highest order.\n\nno stars out of\n\nMenage (July 15/09)\n\nThough it opens with a fair amount of promise, Menage ultimately succumbs to the aggressively weird attributes that writer/director Bertrand Blier has hard-wired into the proceedings - with the frustratingly uneventful nature of the screenplay only exacerbating the movie's myriad of problems. The storyline - which follows a feuding couple (Michel Blanc's Antoine and Miou-Miou's Monique) as they encounter (and eventually become entwined with) a homosexual criminal named Bob (Gerard Depardieu) - boasts few attributes designed to capture and sustain the viewer's ongoing interest, as Blier's relentlessly off-the-wall modus operandi effectively ensures that the film runs out of steam almost as soon as it starts. There's subsequently little doubt that the unabashedly ludicrous premise plays a significant role in Menage's downfall, with the seemingly endless parade of eye-rolling plot twists - ie Antoine and Monique rob a house with Bob minutes after meeting him, Antoine eventually embarks on a torrid love affair with Bob, etc, etc - draining the movie of both its momentum and authenticity. It would, of course, be relatively easy to overlook such deficiencies were the film not entirely lacking in laughs, yet Blier's inability to elicit even a chuckle from the viewer inevitably highlights the storyline's inherently shallow and downright pointless nature. The enthusiasm with which the three stars tackle their respective roles is impressive, admittedly, though this is hardly enough to justify the existence of what is otherwise a hopelessly wrong-headed piece of work.\n\nout of"
