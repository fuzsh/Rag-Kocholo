        "text": "Gerard Depardieu as a brotherless, aimless Harpo Marx adrift in a strangely depopulated New York. No one is at home, here - the interiors never feel lived in, just as the exteriors never feel like public spaces. A world invaded and paralyzed by props.\n\nThe general air of weirdness, the jabs at popular culture, the casting of a porn star opposite Depardieu and Mastroianni: all of these are less punkish gestures than vessels for melancholia in one of the more interesting post 68 films. Social cohesion has been lost, irrevocably (the only collective project depicted in the film: how to experience rape), but the various retreats into private fantasy are being blocked, too.\n\nIn the end, masculinity, lost in its…\n\nWhen did downtown Manhattan ever look like this? Partly there's an intent to portray it as vacated and post-apocalyptic -- no cars, no crowds -- but I realize that most of that desolate NYC film of the 70s and 80s never ventured below Chinatown and Tribeca. Here, captured for the film, what became the high end developments of Battery Park City are still an aspirational void of dunes, a vast sand beach extending from the west side highway out, more impressive than any of the parks and condos that went in later could ever be. It almost seemed like some impossible trick of compositing, but yes, downtown was really like that. Into this perfect backdrop, Italian surrealist-satirist Marco Ferreri dumps…\n\nAo invés de transgressor, inteiramente livre e despido de qualquer convenção ou cartilha fácil. Uma Nova York quase mambembe, com ares de Terceiro Mundo, porque tomada pela peste, o colapso e o apocalipse, doenças crônicas nas localizações periféricas do planeta, aqui vistas no coração geográfico do mundo. E com astros europeus num filme ambientado na América, dividindo o mesmo plano na abertura com um exército do extermínio, homens completamente de branco e de máscaras, controladores de praga que parecem saídos de filme de Romero. O teatro e o museu de cera as artes resistentes e possíveis depois da catástrofe (\"Aqui, preservamos a história junto com a fisionomia dos homens que a criaram.”). Se em Não Toque na Mulher Branca já…\n\nMarco Ferreri directs a two hour film starring Gérard Depardieu, Marcello Mastroianni and James Coco, about a guy who picks up a monkey and attempts to raise it.\n\nA film that is far too strange for you to dismiss it, and a one that may have some gaps that would leave you thinking it could be tighter.\n\nSome of hornier stuff doesn't always register, but the dry and absurd humour is definitely there, Marcello plays this deprecated weary figure of a man and Gerard, as he is, is playing a very Gerard character, the cinematic oaf. Coco's character is the most openly silly in the film.\n\nAnd the film has this otherwordly feel to it for the whole runtime .…\n\nThe purveyor of the bizarre, Marco Ferrari, once again finds new ways to amuse us with his strange renderings and mad world with 1978’s Bye Bye Monkey. The plot is just as horny and perplexing as it is intriguing. While reading any synopsis may give you some vague understanding of the film that reaches out in so many different branches, it is better to experience it than to try and make sense of what resembles any form or narrative. An English language film with French and Italian production set in New York that is an allegorical mishmash of who we are as a species as we evolve through history. Ferrari again indulges in absurdist satire to remind us of our…"
