New York City, a bleak season. Gérard Lafayette finds a young monkey by the seashore, and decides to raise him as his own child. Ciao maschio (literally “Goodbye, Male”) is the Italian title of the first film shot in the United States by Ferreri with two of his emblematic actors: the young Gérard Depardieu and an aging Marcello Mastroianni. In this tale of two men trying to understand the world in which they live, Ferreri seems to acknowledge the death of all male figures and the rise of feminine characters stronger than ever. 35mm print from Cinecittà.
