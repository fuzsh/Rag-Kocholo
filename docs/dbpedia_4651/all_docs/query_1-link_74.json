        "text": "Medicare Part B of Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage (Part C) cover the costs of doctor visits. However, there may be extra costs.\n\nMedicare is a federally funded insurance plan consisting of various parts, mainly including Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D. Each part covers different medical expenses, such as doctor visits.\n\nIt primarily covers people who are over 65 years old. However, younger people with end stage kidney disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or those with certain disabilities are also eligible.\n\nThis article explains which parts of Medicare cover doctor visits, what types of appointments they cover, and how much the plans cost.\n\nGlossary of Medicare terms\n\nWe may use a few terms in this piece that can be helpful to understand when selecting the best insurance plan:\n\nDeductible: This is an annual amount that a person must spend out of pocket within a certain time period before an insurer starts to fund their treatments.\n\nCoinsurance: This is a percentage of a treatment cost that a person will need to self-fund. For Medicare Part B, this comes to 20%.\n\nCopayment: This is a fixed dollar amount that an insured person pays when receiving certain treatments. For Medicare, this usually applies to prescription drugs.\n\nOriginal Medicare comprises Part A, which covers hospital care, and Part B, which covers many medical services, including doctor visits.\n\nMedicare Part B\n\nMedicare Part B covers two types of services: medically necessary and preventive.\n\nIt covers services, such as:\n\ndoctor’s visits and services\n\noutpatient care\n\nother services that Part A does not cover, such as:\n\nambulance services\n\ndurable medical equipment\n\nclinical research\n\nmental health services\n\nPreventive care helps prevent illnesses or stop early stage conditions from progressing.\n\nIt also covers preventive services, such as:\n\ncardiovascular disease screenings\n\ncervical and vaginal cancer screenings, such as:\n\nPap smears, until the age of 65\n\npelvic exams\n\nhuman papillomavirus tests\n\ndepression screenings\n\ndiabetes screenings\n\nglaucoma screenings\n\nmammograms\n\nprostate cancer screenings\n\nshots, including:\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine\n\nflu shots\n\nhepatitis B shots\n\npneumococcal shots\n\nMedically necessary services are those that a healthcare professional uses to diagnose someone’s medical condition according to their symptoms and to provide them with treatment.\n\nSome preventive services have no associated costs when a healthcare professional agrees to accept the assignment. This means they have a contract to bill Medicare directly.\n\nIndividuals can check whether their plan covers the test or service they need using Medicare’s online tool.\n\nLearn more about Medicare Part B.\n\nMedicare Part C (Medicare Advantage)\n\nMedicare Part C, which is known as Medicare Advantage, is an all-in-one alternative to Original Medicare that private insurance companies administer. These plans must provide the same coverage level as Original Medicare, including coverage for doctor visits.\n\nMedicare sends payment directly to the doctor, although individuals may need to pay coinsurance and meet a deductible. These costs vary by plan.\n\nLearn more about Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nMedicare typically does not cover certain services and doctor’s appointments, including:\n\npodiatry, which can involve callous removal, corn removal, or toenail trimming\n\noptometry, including regular eye health checkups and getting a new prescription — Medicare Advantage plans may offer this as an added service\n\nnaturopathic medicine, including acupuncture, unless it is to treat lower back pain\n\ndental services, although Medicare Advantage may cover some dentistry\n\nmost chiropractic services, unless they are for spinal subluxation, or misaligned spinal disk\n\nPart B may limit coverage to a set number of services in a year or lifetime. For example, someone can have blood tests to screen for heart disease once every 5 years.\n\nAnyone who has had Medicare Part B for longer than 12 months is entitled to a free annual wellness visit that is not subject to a deductible.\n\nBeyond that, Medicare Part B covers 80% of the Medicare-approved cost of medically necessary doctor visits. The individual must pay 20% to the doctor or service provider as coinsurance.\n\nThe Part B deductible also applies, which is $240 in 2024. The deductible is the amount of money that a person pays out of pocket before the insurance begins to cover the costs.\n\nA person also needs to pay a premium to keep the policy. The standard monthly premium in 2024 is $174.70.\n\nIf a person did not sign up when they were eligible at the age of 65 years, they might also need to pay a late enrollment penalty. This penalty can increase the premiums by 10% for each year that someone qualified for Medicare but did not enroll.\n\nThe costs relating to Medicare Advantage Plans vary depending on several factors, including:\n\nwhether the plan has a premium\n\nwhether the plan pays the Medicare Part B premium\n\nthe yearly deductible, copayment, or coinsurance\n\nthe annual limit on out-of-pocket expenses\n\nthe type of healthcare services a person needs\n\nMedicare resources\n\nFor more resources to help guide you through the complex world of medical insurance, visit our Medicare hub."
