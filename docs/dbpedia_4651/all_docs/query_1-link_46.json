        "text": "What are skin tags?\n\nSkin tags are growths that hang from your skin — your doctor might call them 'acrochordons'. They range from 1mm to 1cm and are made of collagen (a type of protein) and blood vessels surrounded by skin. They usually grow in the folds of the skin, where skin rubs together, such as, armpits, groin, anus, thighs, eyelids, neck or under the breasts.\n\nSkin tags look different from warts and other benign skin lesions because of the small stalk that attaches them to the skin. Warts tend to be flat, while skin tags hang off the skin.\n\nWhat causes skin tags?\n\nThe exact cause of skin tags is unknown, and there are likely to be both lifestyle and genetic causes. Some people develop them for no known reason.\n\nYou are more likely to get skin tags in areas where the skin tends to rub against itself. Some health conditions are through to contribute to the risk of developing skin tags, such as:\n\noverweight and obesity\n\ndiabetes\n\npregnancy\n\nAnyone of any gender can develop skin tags, and they are more common in older people. If you're pregnant and develop skin tags, they usually disappear after your baby is born.\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nIf you ever notice a new spot or growth on your skin, you should always see your doctor to check what it is. It is important that your doctor examines you in person, and checks for signs of skin cancer and other skin conditions.\n\nYou should also see your doctor if you have a skin tag that is bothering you, if you would like to have it removed. Your doctor can give you information about skin tag removal options.\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nHow are skin tags diagnosed?\n\nYour doctor will diagnose skin tags by asking you some questions and examining your skin. In most cases, you won't need medical tests or scans.\n\nHow are skin tags treated or removed?\n\nThere is no medical need to remove a skin tag. Skin tags can sometimes drop off by themselves over time.\n\nIf you decide to have a skin tag removed — for example, because it is bothering you or you don't like its appearance — talk to your doctor.\n\nYour doctor can remove the skin tags by:\n\nfreezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy)\n\ncutting them off with surgical scissors or a scalpel (excision)\n\nburning them with electrical energy (hyfrecation)\n\nDepending on where the skin tag is on your body, your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist (skin doctor) to have it removed.\n\nIt's not a good idea to try to remove skin tags by yourself since they can bleed heavily or get infected.\n\nCan skin tags be prevented?\n\nSkin tags can't be fully prevented. You can, however, reduce your chances of getting skin tags by maintaining a healthy body weight with a balanced diet and exercise.\n\nResources and support\n\nThe Australasian College of Dermatologists provides information about the symptoms, causes and removal of skin tags.\n\nThe Cancer Council factsheet on skin cancer outlines signs and symptoms, causes and treatment. It is important to check your skin regularly and check with your doctor if you notice any changes.\n\nCall healthdirect on 1800 022 222 at any time to speak to a registered nurse (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria) for more information and advice."
