        "text": "Also be sure to check out All Fluxx FAQ for more general questions. If you don’t see your question answered among these, please email us at:\n\nFAQ@looneylabs.com\n\nQ: If my play is canceled by a Surprise, do I get to take a different play instead?\n\nA: When someone counters your Play with a Surprise, no, you do not get to choose a different card to play. That play was canceled.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Does using a special ability listed on a Keeper or Creeper count as a Play?\n\nA: No, using any special powers or abilities listed on Keepers or Creepers does not use up one of your plays for your turn.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I choose to Get on With It or Swap Plays for Draws, and I end up getting Creepers when I draw, can I still use Free Actions or Keeper powers to get rid of them?\n\nA: Well you can… just not until your next turn.\n\nWhen a player chooses to take either of these Free Actions, the effect is simultaneous with their turn ending immediately. Most notably, this means that if you draw any Creepers with your draws from Swap Plays or Get On With It, you’re stuck with them until your next turn, even if there are conditions which allow you to trash or give them away on your turn. Your turn ended immediately with the draw, so that window is over.\n\nFor more info on when you can do what during a Fluxx turn, see the link at the bottom of the right sidebar: Order of Events in a Fluxx Turn\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I’m drawing multiple cards on my turn, and I draw a Creeper that makes me win, do I have to finish drawing the rest of the cards for my turn?\n\nA: Yes, you must finish drawing the rest of your cards for your turn – you might draw another Creeper which would prevent your win. You must accept any and ALL Creepers acquired during your initial Draw phase before assessing win conditions.\n\nConsider the initial Draw phase to be all one simultaneous thing. Think of it this way: not everyone draws one… card… at… a… time. Some grab the total number for the Draw, add them to their hand, then deal with Creepers at that time, putting them immediately into play, and drawing to replace. Differences in draw style should not affect the outcome of the game.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I’m going to use a Time Machine Keeper (where you discard/insert into the draw pile for an extra turn), must I do that as the last step in my turn?\n\nA: There are many Time Machines in all of Fluxxdom (list below answer). These are Keepers which, if they are in play, you can get rid of (either to the top of the discard pile or the middle of the draw pile) to gain an extra turn after the one you are currently taking.\n\nThe question at hand is whether one must wait to use this Keeper power as the last thing during one’s turn, since taking another turn is something that happens right after your current turn ends, or whether one could use this power at any time, thereby “putting an extra turn in the bank” to use after you do a bunch of other things during the rest of your current turn.\n\nThe answer, of course, is that you can choose to utilize this power at any time during your turn that you would any other “free action” allowed by Keepers and such.\n\nWe originally could not figure out why it would make any difference when the Time Machine Keeper was utilized, but it does make a difference. For example, if you know that, during your current turn, you will be doing something which may affect your Keepers in play, like, for example, Exchange Keepers, Share the Wealth, or Mix It All Up. If you anticipate using one of these Actions, you may want to make sure you utilize that Time Machine power before you might lose that Keeper.\n\nThe only possible danger is that you might forget to take your extra turn, if there’s a lot of time between your disposing of the Time Machine, and your extra turn after your current one. If you utilize it early to protect it, and then forget you did it, that’s just the risk you take.\n\nThe Batmobile (Batman Fluxx, discard)\n\nThe TARDIS (Doctor Who Fluxx, discard)\n\nThe Time Machine (Regular Show Fluxx, drawpile-insert)\n\nThe Guardian of Forever (Star Trek: TOS Fluxx, drawpile-insert)\n\nThe Orb (Star Trek: DS9 Fluxx, drawpile-insert)\n\nTimeship Aeon (Star Trek: Voyager Fluxx, drawpile-insert)\n\nTimeship Relativity (Star Trek: Voyager Fluxx, drawpile-insert)\n\nThe Atavachron (Archer Expansion for Trek Fluxxen, drawpile-insert)\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What happens if only Psychic Paper is in the discard pile, because you’ve just played, it, and the only card you can copy from someone’s hand is What Do You Want?\n\nA: Remember that Actions do not technically go into the discard pile until completed, though many people simply put them there directly when they use them, that’s a shortcut – which doesn’t matter in most cases. However, there are plenty of weird edge cases like this one where it DOES matter that that’s how they work. If you are still executing Psychic Paper by looking in someone’s hand to find an Action, it is technically not in the discard pile yet, since you’re not done using it until you complete the copied card, in this case, What Do You Want.\n\nSo you play Psychic Paper, it waits, not yet in the discard pile, while you look at the people’s hands and find an Action to copy.\n\nSadly for you, there is NO discard pile, as Psychic Paper is not yet in it, so What Do You Want has no effect.\n\nAt that point, the Psychic Paper goes into the discard pile, a wasted play.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for a card to be played and have no effect at that time: for example, if you play Exchange Keepers (presumably because you were forced to) and nobody has anything to exchange. Of course, you could not know that your options from someone else’s hand would be so limited when you played the Psychic Paper. It’s just a risk you take in Fluxx.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I have a Creeper needed to win, and I also have other Creepers not mentioned on the Goal, can I win?\n\nA: No, you cannot. In most cases, if you have a Creeper not mentioned on the Goal you are trying to win with, then it prevents you from winning.\n\nThe exception could be considered to be Batman Fluxx, where, if you are winning with ANY Goal which requires a specific Villain (the Creepers of the Batman version) then no Villain prevents your win. You are considered to be “on the side of the bad guys” for that win. Batman Fluxx is also an exception in that, if the Goal does NOT require a Villain, then Villains ANYWHERE (in front of ANY player) will prevent the win.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If someone stopped my play with a Surprise, and then I used Mystery Play, and drew a Surprise, can I use that to counter their Surprise?\n\nA: No, the Surprise you draw via Mystery Play* cannot be used to stop the previous Canceling of your play. It’s far too late. Whatever card you played has been Canceled, and that’s that. With no Surprise available, you could not stop the Surprise, so you have moved on and taken your next game action: choosing to use Mystery Play.\n\nSince choosing to use Mystery Play will always disrupt the immediacy required for a reactive Surprise play, any Surprise drawn via Mystery Play would have to be used for it’s in-turn function.\n\n* Or any of its analogues below:\n\nMystery Play in Fluxx 5.0, SE, Remixx, Astronomy, SpongeBob, and Wonderland\n\nMythtery Play in Fantasy\n\nWormhole in Star, Star Trek TOS, TNG, and Voyager\n\nShiny! in Firefly\n\nAllons-y/Geronimo! in Doctor Who\n\nSpontaneous Reaction in Chemistry\n\nEgads! in Batman\n\nUnknown Variable in Math\n\nTHWIP! in Marvel\n\n(the Infinity Gauntlet Keeper in Marvel has this as its special power as well)\n\nGreat Idea! in Stoner\n\nMagic Spell in Fairy Tale\n\nMagic Portal in Adventure Time\n\nMagic Shoes in Oz (if you click your heels together three times)\n\nOpen The Door in Monster (if the Spooky Door is in play)\n\nOpen A Gift! in Holiday (if The Gift is in play)\n\nChemical X in Cartoon Network (if at least one Powerpuff Girl is in play)\n\nTime Doorway in Regular Show (if the Time Machine is in play)\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: It is possible to use Get On With It if the rules are only Play 1?\n\n… The wording “final play” makes it seem as if there’s more than one play needed….\n\nA: If you have only one Play (or only one card to play, even if the rules allow more) then that one card would be both your first and your final play. So yes, there IS a final play, even if you’d only be playing one card.\n\nSo, in order to use Get On With It, you’d have to do it before your final play, i.e. before your ONLY play. You’d just not take your Play for that turn, and do Get On With It instead.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I use two different cards which get me an extra turn, do I get two extra turns? What if I use them again during my extra turns? Do I get even more extra turns?\n\nA: This situation could arise in any deck (or combined decks) where you have two cards which can give extra turns. For example, in Doctor Who Fluxx you have the Surprise My Turn Next (MTN) and the TARDIS Keeper. In Star Trek: Voyager Fluxx, there are two Timeships each of which can give you an extra turn.\n\nThe wording on most of these cards reads “The maximum number of turns you can take in a row using this card is two.” Another way to say this is that, no matter how many times you play this card in a string of turns, you’re only going to get ONE EXTRA turn in a row before someone else gets to play.\n\nSo, if you manage to play two different “extra turn” cards on your turn, yes, you’re going to get to take two extra turns, for a total of three. If, on one of your extra turns, you then manage to re-play one or both of those cards, they’re not going to give you more extra turns.\n\nIf someone tries to argue that the extra turns gained from each card are not “in a row” from each other (“The first extra turn was from MTN, and the second one was from the TARDIS, and now the third one is from MTN, and the fourth one is from the TARDIS again…” we would respond that this is an overly narrow reading of the rule, and goes against the intention of the restriction.\n\nWe want to avoid the abuse of these cards where one player takes a ridiculous number of turns in a row. That’s just not fun for the other player/s, and we want everyone to have fun. Only ONE EXTRA turn per special card.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Are Keeper/Creeper powers that say “On your turn…” only able to be used once when you first put the Keeper in play, or on every turn?\n\nA: “On your turn” means every time your turn comes around (assuming favorable conditions apply).\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I have a Goal which requires Creepers, and I’m playing with a deck that has duplicate Creepers do extras of one of the Creepers required prevent my win?\n\n…for example, for the Goal Enemy Alliance that requires Romulans and Klingons, if I have both the TNG and TOS versions of the Romulans Creeper, does the second Romulans count as an extra Creeper which prevents my win, as mentioned in this FAQ? Or is it just more of what I need to win?\n\nA: Since the Goal specifically mentions Romulans without specifying one of the other, they’re effectively identical, and both count towards the Goal and not against it, and it doesn’t matter that you have a superfluous one. It’s more like what’s described in this FAQ.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If we have the War Doctor in our Doctor Who Fluxx deck, and he counts as Doctor 8.5, are Doctors 8 and 9 no longer consecutive?\n\nA: Yes, that is correct. If you have the War Doctor in your deck, he comes between Doctors 8 and 9, sequentially, so those two Doctors on their own should not be considered consecutive in that case.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: The Master Creeper says that it can be given away to “the player that has The Doctor” but what if there are multiple players who have a Doctor in play?\n\nA: The person with The Master can give that card away to any player with any Doctor in play.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If my opponent has a Keeper in play which says “On your turn you may…” can I use that power on my turn, since it doesn’t specify who “you” are?\n\nA: No. In order to use the powers of a Keeper or Creeper in play, it must be in your possession. “You/your” in this case refers to the owner of the card only.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can I trash someone else’s Doctor to get rid of my Dalek, instead of my own?\n\nA: The Dalek says you can discard the Doctor from anywhere on the table. You’re not required to kill your own Doctor first, so, it makes the most sense, strategically, for your Dalek to target someone else’s Doctor.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: When a player is allowed multiple plays on their turn, are there any guidelines for timing between plays?\n\nA: TLDR: Officially, no… BUT, when playing in any of our games which include interrupt cards which cancel a previous play (Surprise, Memo From Your Future Self, Stop Time) it’s good practice to play a little slower if you happen to be executing multiple plays, so that your opponents have plenty of time to play one of these cards, should they so desire.\n\nDeliberately playing super-fast, “shotgunning” as one fan put it, is just rude, and, rather than avoiding arguments about interrupts, actually ends up causing them. So if you have someone who insists upon playing that way, feel free to implement a requirement of a full one-hippopotamus silent count between card plays. We think those worried about their second-to-last winning play being foiled by an interrupt will find that others are not as psychic as they feared. Read on…\n\nSo here’s a typical Surprise situation, which can cause a bit of controversy:\n\nI recently won when the rules called for Play 2. I played my first card, a Keeper, and then a moment later I played a Goal card that caused me to win. My opponent then showed me that he had the Surprise card in his hand that could have stopped me from playing the Keeper, and we had a brief discussion about whether I should have left him more time to consider playing it.\n\nIn my opponent’s defense, I didn’t leave him much time to play his Surprise card that would have allowed him to take my Keeper for himself. In my defense, he didn’t really have any reason to play the Surprise card and take the Keeper – until he saw that my next play was the winning Goal.\n\nSo… are there guidelines on timing between playing consecutive cards?\n\nSlapping them down so quickly that no one has a chance to do anything doesn’t seem entirely fair – but it also doesn’t seem strategic after playing a card to wait and look around at other players to see if they have any game response before playing the next card.\n\n(Related question: A player doesn’t have to “announce” or “report” their play out loud, right? They can just play their cards and if other players aren’t paying attention, that’s the fault of the other players? We all want to have good sportsmanship, but you know how games can sometimes get, in terms of either other players not paying attention, or in terms of being very competitive!)\n\nHere’s our response:\n\nWhile we don’t have any official guidelines about exact timing of card plays, We recommend a slight pause between a two-card play like this when the active player knows it’s going to make them win. It’s rarely the case that the person with the Keeper-stopper will intuitively know that the necessary Goal is coming… until it gets there (or vice-versa: if they had the Goal-stopper, and you’d decided to play the Keeper last, they couldn’t know you’d have the winning Keeper to play after the innocuous Goal), so playing slow is often to your advantage, as the player who’s about to win.\n\nIn fact, playing casually, even pretending you don’t know what you want to play next, can be a great move. Playing slowly enough to allow a possible Surprise doesn’t have to mean broadcasting your impending win. (For example, looking significantly around the table as if expecting a challenge). Of course, announcing your your play is in no way required, but could even be part of your nonchalant act, depending on how you do it. (“Hmm… Well, there’s this Small Moon… and… let’s see… That’s No Moon, for the win!”)\n\nThat said, one often doesn’t have the presence of mind to think about deliberately hesitating. In real life, you’re usually just taking your play, and winning, at regular game speed.\n\nHere is where the question is really about what your opponent was thinking, and they have to be honest about it: did it only occur to them to play the Surprise after you’d played the winning Goal? If you’d just accidentally played the Goal first, and then the Keeper, their Keeper-canceling Surprise would have gone through and prevented your win. But just as they couldn’t know your next play would be the end of the game, you couldn’t know they had a Surprise. For all you knew, they had the Goal-stopping Surprise, and it’s just chance which order you chose to play those two cards in. It’s not as though you deliberately played in such a way as to deliberately thwart a Surprise on your first play.\n\nThe thing to point out here is that, had you stopped playing after the Keeper, would it even have occurred to them to use the Surprise? Probably not, if they’re being honest. It’s extremely rare that one’s opponent is prescient or observant enough to realize that this play might be your second-to-last. People rarely want to squander a Surprise on the off-chance that your next play will be the winning one*. In the kind of situation you describe, the Surprise-having player usually just shrugs, and says “Darn! I had [the Surprise that would have prevented your second-to-last play], and I could have stopped that play, but it’s too late now… Oh well. Let’s deal again…”\n\nBecause, in the end, if they didn’t get that Surprise in after the applicable card, that’s the way it goes, and that’s the official ruling if people get – ahem – unruly.\n\n*I mean, imagine it. If they’d canceled your Keeper before you’d played the winning Goal, your best reaction is probably simply to shrug as if mildly confused by such a powerful play, apparently for nothing, and make them feel like they just wasted their Surprise on a random Keeper play… heh heh. You don’t have to let them know they totally blocked your win. Meanwhile… you don’t have to get upset about missing that chance… it’s just Fluxx, and victory is snatched away at all the time in the course of any given game – usually completely by accident. Or you can let them know their spidey-senses were working, or congratulate them on how observant they are. It’s up to you.\n\nNow let’s return to that “shotgunning” player who’s deliberately playing quickly so that nobody can slip a Surprise in on that penultimate play… It is, as the fan above pointed out, not entirely fair, and, moreover, it invites the argument “But you didn’t leave me enough time to play my Surprise!” If, on the other hand they had played it slowly, as described above, their opponent has no excuse to challenge the win, on the claim that they “were going to play a Surprise.” The opponent had plenty of time, but in the vast majority of cases, they won’t play the Surprise, because they have no idea what’s coming next. That’s part of the beauty of Fluxx!\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: How should we treat the War Doctor with respect to the Blinovitch Limitation Effect?\n\nA: The War Doctor should be considered Doctor 8.5.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: When I play a Keeper with a power or special ability, must that be invoked immediately?\n\nA: No, you don’t HAVE to use it immediately. You MAY use it immediately if you want to, however.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: When I use a free power on a Keeper (or Creeper), is the Keeper destroyed?\n\nA: Keeper powers do not usually destroy or take the Keeper out of play to use them – unless they specifically say they do.\n\nA couple say you’ll have to pick the Keeper up and put it back in your hand when you use its power, and one or two say to insert the Keeper into the middle of the draw pile. Only a couple will cause destruction of the Keeper being used. In any case those requirements will all be specified on the Keeper in question.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: How does the Future Doctor work in Doctor Who Fluxx? What about the Regeneration Goal?\n\nA: The Future Doctor is always exactly one higher than the highest numbered Doctor in the game (not the highest numbered Doctor in play, but the highest numbered one in the deck). So, for purposes of the Goal Regeneration, the Future Doctor consecutively follows the highest numbered Doctor in the game.\n\nImagine all the Doctors are waiting in a queue. The Future Doctor is always behind the last Doctor in line. So if Peter is the last Doctor in line, the Future Doctor is next in line behind Peter. And when Jodie joins the line, she’s behind Peter, and the Future Doctor is behind her.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If My Turn Next is played (out of turn) in the same turn as someone discards the TARDIS, who gets the next turn, and do they both get extra turns?\n\n…Player B starts turn, Player A puts down My Turn Next then. During their turn Player B discards their TARDIS in play for another turn. Who goes next, and do they both still get the extra turn?\n\nA: They both get an extra turn, but, in this case, if there are only two players in the game, it’s going to look like nothing happens. If you’ve got more than just those two players in the game, the non-involved player/s will definitely notice that A and B got extra turns, no matter what order they went in!\n\nSo the order in which those extra turns play out depends on the order in which the extra-turn cards are invoked. Since Player A played My Turn Next before the TARDIS extra turn was invoked, the Surprise player gets the next turn… then the TARDIS discarder… then whoever was going to go next after that turn. If it’s only a two player game, that next person is Player A, which will feel like nothing happened. Otherwise, it’s whoever is usually after Player B, which may be Player C, D, etc…\n\nIn more detail for this situation:\n\n(Presumably Player A’s turn was before this)\n\nPlayer B starts turn\n\nPlayer A plays My Turn Next\n\nPlayer B discards the TARDIS, and does whatever else they may do on their turn\n\n–> Player A gets their magical Surprise turn\n\n–> Player B gets their TARDIS turn\n\nThe next player takes their turn.\n\nIf it’s a two-player game, Player A’s turn is next, and it will seem like nothing happened: (A), B, ->A, ->B, A… Though technically, those turns with arrows are extra, but since the two players continued to simply alternate, there’s no practical effect.\n\nIf there are more than two players, however, then (A) B, ->A, ->B, C, D, etc… and players C and D will notice that A and B got extra turns in there, out of order.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Player A played My Turn Next after Player B discarded their TARDIS, the turn order would go like this:\n\n(Presumably Player A’s turn was before this)\n\nPlayer B starts turn\n\nPlayer B discards the TARDIS\n\nPlayer A plays My Turn Next\n\n–> Player B gets their TARDIS turn\n\n–> Player A gets their magical Surprise turn\n\nThe next player takes their turn.\n\nIf it’s a two-player game, Player A’s turn is next, but the order will go like this: (A), B, ->B, ->A, A…\n\nIf more than two players, then (A) B, ->B, ->A, C, D, etc… Once again, players C and D will still notice the extra turns by A and B.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I have Doctors 7 and 8, and another player has Doctors 3 and 4, and the Goal Regeneration comes up, who wins?\n\nA: Sounds like a classic case of two people meeting the winning conditions at the same time.\n\nOn the rule sheet itself, at end of the first page in “Notes” is the ruling for ties:\n\n“The game doesn’t end until there is a clear winner. If for some reason two of more players meet the winning conditions simultaneously, the game continues until a single winner emerges.”\n\nSo, for your situation, the answer is actually fairly simple: there were two players meeting winning conditions simultaneously, so keep playing until a clear winner emerges. Note that the “clear winner” need not be one of the two originally tied. It could happen that the game state changes, and someone else wins instead of either one of them.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: How do I handle Creepers which are dealt to me at the beginning of the game?\n\nA: Some versions of the rules deal with this explicitly, and some don’t, so we’re answering this here in the FAQ, just in case there is any confusion.\n\nCreepers may not be held in your hand, so if you get a Creeper as part of your dealt hand, you put it on the table in front of you (play it pre-game, essentially) and draw to replace. If it’s another Creeper, continue until you have a starting hand containing zero Creepers.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What happens if I play an Action that causes my turn to end immediately in the middle of Draw 3 Play 2 or Draw 2 & Use Em (or Fizzbin, or Goal Bonanza)?\n\n…Since these cards are all played as part of a single play, would the player get to finish playing them out, or would their turn just stop? And if it just stopped, what would happen to any unplayed cards? We’ve been letting the player keep them.\n\nA: The clear answer is that if you decide to play one of these turn-ending Actions, your turn would end immediately, and you would not get to continue playing cards from your temporary mini-hand (in other words, no, you would not get to finish playing D3P2/D2UE.\n\nOf course, in the case of Fizzbin, you don’t get a choice as to the order of cards played, but that card most closely resembles D3P2/D2UE, since you set your main hand aside, and are working from a temporary hand of extra cards to execute the Fizzbin.\n\nUsing the optional Free Action Rule Goal Bonanza also creates a sub-hand with your main hand set aside. While it’s not in any decks with turn-ending Actions, it’s in the More Packs, which could be added to any deck, including those with turn-ending Actions.\n\nHowever, there is NO way that any remaining cards would go back into your set-aside hand. They are never intended to go into your actual hand at all, as indicated by the requirement to set your hand aside. Any cards left unplayed when you played the turn-ending card are discarded. If you wanted to play them, you should have done it before the turn-ending card.\n\nBrain Transference: Discard remaining cards in your temporary hand and trade places with the player of your choice. Turn ends.\n\nTime Portal: Choose a card as described and add to your set-aside hand. Discard remaining cards in your temporary hand. Turn ends.\n\nWhat Do You Want: If you choose to take a Keeper or Goal out of the discard, it goes into your set aside hand. Discard remaining cards in your temporary hand. Turn ends.\n\nI’ll Be In My Bunk or I’ll Be Right Back: This card does not specifically say that your turn ends immediately, but you certainly can’t continue your turn if you “Excuse yourself from the game and leave the room for a few minutes.” Discard any cards remaining in your temporary hand. Leave the room.\n\nSwap Plays For Draws and Get On With It, while they do involve having your turn end immediately, are New Rules, not Actions, so, as you can see from this answer, things would work a bit differently:\n\nSee: Can you Get On With It or Swap Plays For Draws with your cards from an Action like Draw 3 Play 2?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Does countering a Surprise on my turn count as one of my plays? Can I also use it for the in-turn function if I do this?\n\nA: If you are the active player, counter-Surprising does not use up one of your total plays for the turn. By the same token, however, this means you cannot use the Surprise for it’s function which would use a play. To wit:\n\nYou can only use a Surprise to do one of three things:\n\n1) use it on your turn as a play, for it’s in-turn function\n\nOR\n\n2) Use it to Surprise another player,\n\n2a) on another player’s turn to cancel a play\n\nOR\n\n2b) on your turn to counter their interruption of your own play (“counter-Surprise”)\n\nYou cannot do more than one of those things.\n\nSo if you’re using it to counter-Surprise on your turn (2b), you can’t also use it as one of your plays for it’s “in-turn” function (1).\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can I use Get On With It if I played my only card, but the Play rule says to play more? Does that count as “before my final play”?\n\n…I had one card in my hand, with Play 4 in effect. I played my card, an Action card which was then discarded. I wanted to claim to able to get 3 new cards because “Get On With It” which was on the table says I could since I had discarded my hand and had 4 – 1 = 3 plays left.\n\nA: In order to take the option to Get On With It, you must be sacrificing (at least) one of your Plays, and you must be discarding a hand of at least one card.\n\nThe most obvious issue is that, at the point when you wanted to Get On With It, you didn’t discard your hand. You played an Action, and now your hand is empty. You have to have something to discard in order to discard something. Your hand has to exist in order to be discarded.\n\nThe second issue is almost a side effect. We would not consider you to “have plays left” if you have no cards to play. In this case your first play WAS your final play, so you can’t take this option because it’s not before your final play. In order to have a final play, you have to have a card to play.\n\nThe whole thing follows logically, since the card/s you could have played – but didn’t – will be remaining in your hand, and therefore among the cards you’re throwing away.\n\nSee also: Is Swap Plays For Draws limited by the number of cards you have in your hand?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: It seems like Get On With It or Swap Plays for Draws would contradict Play All. Would putting either of these into play cause Play All to be discarded?\n\nA: No. The instructions on Get On With It (or Swap Plays for Draws) only temporarily override the instructions on Play All and only on the turn of the player using it. Since choosing to use one of these is optional, simply putting either of them into play doesn’t contradict Play All, so you wouldn’t discard Play All just because you played one of them (nor vice versa!)\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: When we draw a Creeper, put it into play, and then “draw another card to replace it,” does that card replace the Creeper, discarding it?\n\nA: It’s true, the Creeper card does say “immediately draw another card to replace it” but this doesn’t mean you replace the Creeper on the table, discarding it. This means “replace the Creeper in the number of cards you drew.” If you needed to draw 3 cards, and you drew them and one of them was a Creeper, you play the Creeper and draw another card, because that Creeper doesn’t count as one of the 3 cards you needed to draw (neither does it count against the number of cards you get to Play on your turn), so you have only drawn 2 cards, so you still need to draw a third.\n\nYou’re not replacing the Creeper from it’s place “in play” (i.e. on the table). You’re just replacing the card “lost” as part of your draw count because it was a Creeper. The idea is that Creepers go into play automatically, whether you want them to or not. They’re usually a problem for you, and you have to work to get rid of them (though sometimes you need them for Goals, otherwise, they hinder you).\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What happens if you draw a turn-ending card when you use Wormhole?\n\n…It says the card played does not count as a Draw or Play, so does it still end your turn?\n\nA: Yes, while that card you draw from Wormhole (or any of its analogues) doesn’t count against the Draw or Play count as shown on the rule cards, it’s still part of your turn, and the card still counts as being fully played. Whatever it says happens, happens. That’s the risk you take, pulling a card out of the Wormhole! Keep in mind that the turn-ending effect of New Rules is optional, so simply playing them does not end your turn.\n\nAlso remember you can take the Wormhole option at ANY time during your turn: before your Draws and Plays, in the middle of your Draws, in the middle of your Plays, or after both, if you like. That’s the only control you get to exert: WHEN and WHETHER you decide to play a card from the Wormhole.\n\nAnalogues of Wormhole (which is in Star Fluxx) include (some with slight variations such as conditional requirements for use):\n\nMagic Shoes in Oz Fluxx\n\nShiny! in Firefly Fluxx\n\nThere are many other Wormhole analogues in other versions, but those versions don’t also include turn-ending Actions.\n\nSee also: Q: What cards have effects that include ending my turn immediately if I play/use them?\n\nSee also: Q: What are all the different cards in different versions where you get to draw the top card and play it immediately?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What cards have effects that include ending my turn immediately if I play/use them?\n\nA: Cards (Actions) that end your turn immediately if you play them:\n\nBrain Transference: Star Fluxx\n\nClean Cup!: Wonderland Fluxx\n\nTime Portal: Star Fluxx, Doctor Who Fluxx, TNG Fluxx, Voyager Fluxx,\n\nWhat Do You Want?: Star Fluxx, Oz Fluxx, Doctor Who Fluxx\n\nI’ll Be In My Bunk: Firefly Fluxx\n\nI’ll Be Right Back: Fluxx Remixx\n\n(These last two cards don’t specifically say that your turn ends immediately, but you certainly can’t continue your turn if you “Excuse yourself from the game and leave the room for a few minutes.”)\n\nCards (Rules) that end your turn immediately if/when you execute them, but not when you play them:\n\nSwap Plays for Draws\n\nGet On With it\n\nPlay All +1 (not optional, but see below)\n\nFree Action Rules are optional, so you could choose not to use one that will end your turn immediately. While Play All +1 is not optional, you have some options about when you choose to take that final +1.\n\nAlso see:\n\nAlso see: Order of events in a Fluxx turn\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can the Stop That! Surprise counter the “free action” provided by some Rules or Keepers?\n\nA: Those are not considered “Actions” in the sense that they are not Action cards, and Stop That (or Belay That) is intended to cancel out Action cards specifically. Nor will Veto! which cancels Rules stop this type of free action.\n\nMore broadly worded Surprises might prevent some of these, however. For example, Skullduggery, It’s A Trap and You Can’t Take This Guy From Me are designed more broadly, so that they can prevent “any game action” which can include the results of Action cards, Free Actions from Rule and Free Actions from Keepers or Creepers. The first two can be acquired in the More Surprises pack.\n\nThere might be some confusion on Let’s Keep Doing That, since there is an Action card permanently in play, but it is intended to act as if it were a New Rule, so we would rule that it’s no longer stoppable by the Stop That! Anti-Action Surprise.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can a Surprise be used to cancel a Hand Limit on your own turn?\n\n…Example:\n\nPlayer A plays a Hand Limit\n\nPlayer B and C discard down to the hand limit\n\nPlayer A plays Veto to cancel the Hand Limit for themselves.\n\nIs this allowed?\n\nA: Well, it all depends how Player A was trying to play the Veto. Every Surprise has two different instructions on it. One for when you’re using it to interrupt someone else’s play, and one for if you play it out of your own hand as a regular card on your turn.\n\nFirst case (the out-of-turn function):\n\nIf Player A was trying to use the out-of-turn function to cancel the play of their own card, that’s not allowed. It’s their turn, so they can only use the in-turn function. See also: Can one ever use the out-of-turn function of a Surprise on their own turn?\n\nNote that even if it were another person playing out-of-turn to cancel the card (let’s call them Player D) the Surprise should be played immediately after the card one wants to cancel: in the case of a Hand Limit, that would ideally be before anyone has discarded anything.\n\nMoreover, even if everyone decided to cut imaginary Player D some slack about the timing, and they did let Player D play the Veto after some people had discarded, canceling the Rule would “prevent it from ever taking effect” and everyone would get to take all their cards back as though the Hand Limit had never been played. Long story short: you can’t Veto a rule just for you. The Rule applies to everyone, so when you Veto it, it’s Vetoed for everyone.\n\nSecond case (the in-turn function):\n\nIf Player A still had a play left on their turn after playing the Hand Limit, they could simply play the Veto for its in-turn function. What it does in this case is let them “discard [their] choice of up to 2 New Rules currently in play”. The Rules discarded don’t even have to be ones that were recently played.\n\nIn this case, those rules are not being “canceled” without ever having taken effect, they’re just being discarded. The Rules were played, they took effect for as long as they were in play, and then they were discarded. So if Player A did that, they could simply trash the Hand Limit before their turn ends, thereby avoiding having to discard down at all. Of course, this uses up one of their plays for their turn.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If someone plays Trade Hands with me, and I have some Surprises (other than Stop That, which could prevent the trade) can I use them up with no effect, just so I don’t have to give them to the other player?\n\nA: No. Surprises can only be played for an out-of-turn effect when there is an effect to be had. You can’t just play a Surprise for no effect just to burn it.\n\nWhen used for their in-turn effect, of course, they behave much the same way as Actions, and, as such, may or may not have an effect.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If multiple Surprises are canceled by each other, how do you figure out what happens in the end?\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer A uses That’s Mine for its in-turn function to steal a Keeper from Player B\n\nPlayer B uses It’s A Trap! to cancel the steal, and instead steal from Player A\n\nPlayer A uses Canceled plans to cancel It’s A Trap, since Surprises can cancel Surprises.\n\nDoes the original steal go through? Player B argued that there was no steal in either direction, as both That’s Mine and It’s A Trap had been canceled by subsequent Surprises.\n\nA: The short answer is that That’s Mine is carried out for it’s in-turn function for the Keeper steal.\n\nThe long answer:\n\nThat’s Mine is played in turn: Keeper is stolen\n\nIt’s A Trap is played out of turn by victim: That’s Mine is negated and the Keeper steal is reversed\n\nCancelled plans negates It’s a Trap, which had previously been reversing the Keeper steal and negating That’s Mine. This leaves That’s Mine un-negated to steal the Keeper as originally played\n\nIt’s not that cards just get put on the discard pile, covered and they’re gone. Think of each card as going into a “being played” area only into the discard pile when they are done being used, or when negated for good. There was sort of a little wrestling match out there in the “being played” area between all the Surprises, and It’s A Trap lost.\n\nHere is a generic version of what a battle like this could look like. It can continue until you run out of Surprises. Keep in mind that it’s totally possible and allowed for some other player, for example, Player C, to jump in on either side, potentially confusing the toggle state of the original play. If things come to this, it may be very important to keep track of the original play being canceled, perhaps putting it in the middle and flipping it over to indicate which state it is in: effective, vs canceled.\n\nA plays some card X.\n\nB plays Surprise 1, canceling X.\n\nA cancels surprise 1 with Surprise 2, so X is in effect again.\n\nB cancels surprise 2 with Surprise 3, so Surprise 1 goes through, and X is canceled again.\n\nand so forth. If there were more, it would look like this:\n\nA cancels surprise 3 with Surprise 4, so Surprise 2 goes through, canceling Surprise 1, so X happens.\n\nB cancels surprise 4 with Surprise 5, so Surprise 3 goes through, canceling Surprise 2, so Surprise 1 is in effect again, so X is canceled.\n\nSo far, the maximum number of Surprises in a version is 6, in Batman Fluxx, but here’s the page where we would update that info:\n\nComplexity Factors for Fluxx editions\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What are all the different cards in different versions where you get to draw the top card and play it immediately?\n\nA: There are many analogues to Wormhole (the first one we made) or Mystery Play (the most generic one). Some may require a token action (click your heels together to use Magic Shoes in Oz Fluxx, for example) or condition (if a certain card is in play) to activate them but they are essentially all the same kind of card.\n\nMystery Play in Fluxx 5.0, SE, Remixx, Astronomy, SpongeBob, and Wonderland\n\nMythtery Play in Fantasy\n\nWormhole in Star, Star Trek TOS, TNG, and Voyager\n\nShiny! in Firefly\n\nAllons-y/Geronimo! in Doctor Who\n\nSpontaneous Reaction in Chemistry\n\nEgads! in Batman\n\nUnknown Variable in Math\n\nTHWIP! in Marvel\n\n(the Infinity Gauntlet Keeper in Marvel has this as its special power as well)\n\nGreat Idea! in Stoner\n\nMagic Spell in Fairy Tale\n\nMagic Portal in Adventure Time\n\nMagic Shoes in Oz (if you click your heels together three times)\n\nOpen The Door in Monster (if the Spooky Door is in play)\n\nOpen A Gift! in Holiday (if The Gift is in play)\n\nChemical X in Cartoon Network (if at least one Powerpuff Girl is in play)\n\nTime Doorway in Regular Show (if the Time Machine is in play)\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Could you clarify how many cards we can eliminate with Let’s Simplify? What does “up to half (rounded up)” mean?\n\nA: The wording on Let’s Simplify is as clear as we could make it. If we had said that you may discard up to half of the New Rules in play, and there were an odd number (for example, five of them) you wouldn’t know whether you should round up or down. But we tell you that you should ROUND UP when figuring out what “half” is, so in this example, you know you can discard up to three.\n\nOf course, you may discard up to half – you don’t have to discard three; you could choose to discard just one or two, or even zero if you want. Those numbers are all less than “half (rounded up) of five”.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If a Goal requires something + either of two Creepers. Can I win if I have both Creepers?\n\nA: Our call would be that you could win if you have both, since both are mentioned on the same Goal, and the rule regarding winning with Creepers is that it’s possible if the Goal specifically requires that Creeper. Another way to think of it is that it’s not an “exclusive or” (XOR) it is an “inclusive or” (and/or). An exclusive or would mean one or the other, but not both, whereas an inclusive or means one or the other or both.\n\nThis is true for any Goal which requires any subset of a group of Creepers. If the Creeper is shown on the Goal, it will not prevent the win, but if the person in question has any Creepers NOT shown on the Goal they’re trying to win with, then those excess unrelated Creepers will prevent the win.\n\nIt would be difficult to find all of them to list them here, but we will tag various applicable Goals as they are brought to our attention.\n\nTerrifying Inspiration (Cthulhu Fluxx)\n\nQ Who (Star Trek TNG Fluxx)\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Is it possible to win with a Goal that uses a specific Keeper even though it would be “immediately discarded” due to conditions with a mutually exclusive Keeper already in play?\n\nA: We’ve had this question in several different forms so far, so I’m tweaking it to make it generic. We’d say NO on this one. For example, if Batman is in play, it’s just not possible for Bruce Wayne to be somewhere else, even for an instant. Same with Yolanda/Saffron/Bridget. The Doctor is a bit different, but we think it’s cleaner to keep this working the same way as the others. Blinovitch prevents you from actually having any earlier Doctor for any amount of time if a later one is already on the table.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can you Get On With It or Swap Plays For Draws with your cards from an Action like Draw 3 Play 2?\n\nA: You could certainly put either of these New Rules (Get On With It, or Swap Plays For Draws) into play as part of an Action like Draw 3 Play 2 of them (D3P2) or Draw 2 and Use Em (D2UE), or Fizzbin (or your cards drawn via the Rule Goal Bonanza) but you could not utilize their functions while in the middle of executing one of these cards. While all four of these Actions/Free Actions do give you a sort of temporary hand, you can’t substitute it for your real hand to “discard and draw back up to 3”, for example.\n\nYou would either need to invoke Get On With It! before the Free/Action with the temporary hand is played or after. The Playing of D3P2/D2UE/Fizzbin/Goal Bonanza, and all actions as a result of it are considered 1 “Play”.\n\nSee also: What happens if I play and Action that causes my turn to end immediately in the middle of Draw 3 Play 2 or Draw 2 & Use Em (or Fizzbin, or Goal Bonanza)?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If a card says “Your turn ends immediately,” but Play All is in effect, which takes precedence?\n\nA: When you play an Action or use a New Rule card says “your turn ends immediately” it means it’s specifically overriding any Play rule that might otherwise require you to keep playing cards on this turn. You also end any option you may have to use Keeper powers or “Free Action” Rules. If it says “your turn ends immediately” then your turn ends immediately – so make sure you’re all done with stuff before you play/use one of these cards!\n\nSee: Q: What cards have effects that include ending my turn immediately if I play/use them?\n\nAlso see: Would putting either of these two into play cause Play All to be discarded?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Is the third Surprise function (countering another Surprise) limited to in-turn or out-of-turn play?\n\nA: You can use the counter-Surprise function at any time, either during someone else’s turn or your own. Here are some basic examples:\n\nOn your own turn:\n\nSomeone cancels one of your plays with a Surprise. You play a Surprise to counter their Surprise. Note: although it is your turn, this does not count as one of your Plays.\n\nOn someone else’s turn:\n\nThey play a Surprise for the in-turn function. You play a Suprise to counter it.\n\nOn someone else’s turn:\n\nThey play a card. You cancel it with the appropriate Surprise. They counter-Surprise you. You counter-Surprise them!\n\nOn someone else’s turn:\n\nPlayer A plays a card. Player B cancels it with a Surprise. You decide to counter Player B’s Surprise, for whatever reason motivates you.\n\n(In other words, if there is a Surprise/counter-Surprise “battle” going on between two other players, as described in the previous example, you can jump in at any time on either players “side”.)\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If something is played where “your turn ends immediately,” does it mean that you are not subject to the hand and Keeper limits that turn?\n\nA: No. Hand and Keeper Limits apply to you when it’s not your turn, so you would observe them as soon as your turn ends.\n\nSee also: Q: What cards have effects that include ending my turn immediately if I play/use them?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What do I do if I draw a Creeper because of an Action?\n\nA: If a Creeper is drawn by the active player, they must take the Creeper (play it in front of themselves) and draw to replace, such that all the cards they have drawn for whatever the Action indicates will contain no Creepers.\n\nFor example, if I play Everybody Gets One, then I, as the active player, am the one drawing cards. As such, I have to take all the Creepers I draw, redrawing until I’m holding enough non-Creeper cards to give 1 to each player including myself. In a deck with a lot of Creepers, anything that makes you draw cards is a liability!\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If the rules are Draw 1, and I draw three Creepers in a row, how many cards do I redraw?\n\n…I say it’s just one card, but my husband says it should be three, since three Creepers were drawn. Who is right?\n\nA: For practical purposes, you are correct. If you have laid down three Creepers in a row like that, you are left needing to draw 1. After your draw phase, you should end up having drawn just 1 non-Creeper for your Draw 1.\n\nIf anyone is having a hard time wrapping their head around why this is, here’s a blow-by-blow description of what happens when you draw three Creepers in a row while trying to Draw 1.\n\nYou Draw 1. It’s a Creeper.\n\nIt goes in front of you, and you draw to replace it, hoping for a non-Creeper to satisfy the current Draw rule.\n\nYour “draw to replace” is… a second Creeper.\n\nIt goes in front of you with the first, and you draw to replace it, hoping for a non-Creeper to satisfy the current Draw rule.\n\nYour “draw to replace” is… a third Creeper.\n\nIt goes in front of you, and you draw to replace it, hoping for a non-Creeper to satisfy the current Draw rule.\n\nYour “draw to replace” is… finally a non-Creeper, which you add to your hand, and you have successfully followed the current Draw rule, which is Draw 1.\n\nAs you can see, in some ways, your husband is right… but the thing is, the three cards that were “drawn to replace” did happen… they’re just over as soon as you draw 1 non-Creeper.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: What does it mean when a card says its action is a “free play” or a “free action”?\n\nDoes it count as one of your plays for your turn to do this thing?\n\nA: No. That’s the whole point of it being “free”. It does not use one of your plays. Depending on the game we’re talking about (there are cards like this in Chrononauts and Back To The Future, in addition to many in Fluxx editions), you might only be getting one play per turn, and whatever this thing does won’t use up your play for the turn.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Do Surprises work any differently in a two-player game than they do in a game with more people?\n\nA: There is no reason Surprises would work any differently depending on the number of players. Surprises always counter Surprises in full, no matter what the function of the Surprises in question.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can a Surprise card be played to stop a card played previously during someone’s turn?\n\nSome examples:\n\nExample 1: Player A plays a Keeper, and then plays a Goal card to win. Player B plays That’s Mine (the counter-Keeper Surprise) to cancel Player A’s Keeper card hoping to cancel the win. Conversely, maybe Player A played a Goal, then a Keeper, and Player B tried to use Canceled Plans (the counter-Goal Surprise).\n\nExample 2: Player A played the That’s Mine as an in-turn card and stole the Computer from Player B. Then Player A set down a Keeper. Player B then played a Surprise card, claiming that the wording on the card says it may be used on the Surprise card just played.\n\nExample 3: Player A played Draw 3 Play 2 Of Them, drew three cards, and one of them is a Goal that let them win, so they played it. Player B then played Stop That (the counter-Action Surprise) to try to cancel the playing of Draw 3 Play 2, hoping to cancel the win.\n\nA: In all of these cases, Player A’s actions stand, as the Surprise has been played too late. The counteractive Surprise must be played IMMEDIATELY after the card you wish to counteract. It also doesn’t apply to “the most recently played card of the target type played this turn.” Once another card of any type has been played, or a subsequent resulting action taken, it becomes too late to retroactively stop a previous card play with a Surprise.\n\nDon’t be that person needing to ask for a special exception to the rules, and make sure the new players you’re teaching understand: Surprises need to be used in a timely manner. Whenever you have one in your hand, acquaint yourself with its power right away so that you can make a snap decision about whether to use it, since, if you hesitate too long, your opportunity is likely to pass.\n\nSo are there ever exceptions? It depends how relaxed you want to play, and how everyone is getting along. If Player B was a less-than-experienced player, it’s highly likely that it just took them a little while to read their own Surprise card to realize that it could be used in that way. If the results of a rewind are relatively inconsequential, one might cut them some slack. If Player A somehow anticipated that Player B was going to counter their play, and took their next action with barely a blink then that’s a bit rude. But if there was a heated disagreement, please do fall back on the official ruling. The ONLY reason you might choose to ignore it is if you wish to cut Player B some slack for being a n00b, or if you want to call shenanigans on Player A’s playing style for some reason.\n\nRemember: it’s never appropriate to see the consequences of a previous card play, and THEN realize that you wish you’d stopped it before something else happened as a result of that play. In example 1, Player B probably didn’t realize that the first play would result in the win until the second card was played. In example 3, Player B couldn’t know when Draw 3 Play 2 was played that it would result in a win. Too bad. No exceptions for those cases.\n\nThis is where careful ordering of your plays and a good poker face are important so as not to broadcast your intentions. And people say there’s no strategy in Fluxx…\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If someone cancels one of my plays with a Surprise, do I get the card back, and still have that play to use?\n\n… or does the card that was canceled go in the trash (or to my opponent in the case of That’s Mine), and my attempt has used up one of my plays?\n\nSee this answer in a video!\n\nLittle Answers\n\nA: No, it’s that second thing you said: the card that got canceled goes away, and that play has been squandered. On the other hand, your opponent had to give up a card from their hand as well, so it’s not as though it’s without sacrifice on their part too.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If a surprise card can cancel out other surprise cards can a 3rd (or even 4th) surprise card be played consecutively?\n\nQ: With That’s Mine (That Be Mine, Twist Of Fate) played out of turn, if someone is receiving a card via an Action, can I use That’s Mine to intercept it, and get that Keeper myself?\n\n…For example, if they’re using Steal A Keeper, or Exchange Keepers, can I get the Keeper they’re acquiring?\n\nOr if they’re Plundering a Keeper, can I take the Keeper they’re Plundering?\n\nOr if someone plays Mix It All Up, or Share the Wealth, can I get a Keeper that’s being dealt out to someone else?\n\nA: No, No, and No. You can only use the out-of-turn* function of That’s Mine when someone else is putting a Keeper into play in a situation where it was previously NOT in play. You can’t use it to intercept a Keeper being allocated, traded, stolen, or acquired in any other way.\n\nIn most cases it’s an Action, or possibly a Free Action, for which there are Surprises you could use – but they wouldn’t gain you the Keeper which is in transit. They would only stop the Action or Free Action from happening, preventing the Keeper from changing hands in the first place.\n\nThere are, however, some situations besides normal playing of a Keeper from someone’s hand, where wording on another card does actually include the word “play” in the way a Keeper is acquired. See this FAQ about cards played via the Free Action Wormhole (AKA Mystery Play). Or this FAQ about Actions which allow you to take a Keeper out of the discard pile and play it.\n\n* Of course you could use your That’s Mine card on your next turn, for it’s in-turn function which is essentially the same as Steal a Keeper, so you’re really not in a bad place, even if you couldn’t get that Keeper in the middle of the results of an Action.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I use the “during my turn” part of a surprise card on my turn, does that count as a play?\n\nA: Yes\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can one ever use the out-of-turn function of a Surprise during one’s own turn?\n\nA: If you use the Surprise card as one of your plays during your turn, then you must use the “during your turn” functions. The “out of turn” functions almost always cancel some other card play, and it is not allowed to cancel your own play with your own Surprise. Thematically, consider this: it’s hard to really call it a “surprise” if you’re doing it to yourself in this manner.\n\nThe only time when you might not use the “during your turn” on your turn is when you’re using a Surprise to counter a Surprise played by another player against you during your turn.\n\nSee Does countering a Surprise on my turn count as…\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can you use the out-of-turn option on Canceled Plans to nullify a goal you are forced to play during your turn that would cause someone else to win?\n\nA: No. In general, you can’t use the out-of-turn portion of a Surprise during your turn, moreover the Canceled Plans card specifically says it is used to stop a Goal which another player has just played.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: With Canceled Plans played out of turn, does this card only discard a Goal that a player has just played or an existing goal on the table?\n\nA: Only the Goal just played.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can Canceled Plans prevent someone from winning the game? What about That’s Mine?\n\nPlayer #1 contends that he won the game because the rules say that as soon as a goal is achieved the game is over and no other actions/cards can be played. Player #2 says that no, the Surprise card overrides the general rule and cancels the playing of the goal and therefore the game does not end. Which is true?\n\nA: Yes. If the Canceled Plans card played is played immediately, it cancels the Goal and play continues to the next person. That is the intent of the card.\n\nIt works the same way for That’s Mine. If the winning play is a Keeper, That’s Mine can be used to cancel that play, preventing the win.\n\nAgain, Surprises are meant to be able to work this way… but you have to be using the correct Surprise for the type of play you’re canceling – and you must play your Surprise in a timely manner: say, within a few seconds of the player playing their card.\n\nFor more nuanced suggestions about how to resolve some tweaky timing issues, check\n\nWhen a player is allowed multiple plays on their turn, are there any guidelines for timing between plays?”\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Does a counter-Surprise count as a Play for the person whose turn it is?\n\nIf I play a card on my turn and another player plays a Surprise to cancel it, then I play another Surprise to cancel the first one, since it’s my turn, does mounter Surprise count as a Play for me?\n\nA: It does not count as a play. It’s sort of meta-out-of-turn.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Can I use a Surprise from my set-aside hand to cancel a Surprise played on one of my Draw 2 & Use Em, or Draw 3, Play 2 (or Fizzbin, or Goal Bonanza) cardplays?\n\nAlso, could I use a Surprise that was part of the subturn to cancel the attacking Surprise, and if so would that count as one of the plays?\n\nExample:\n\nPlayer #1 plays “Draw 3, Play 2 Of Them” and gets an Action, a Keeper, and a Surprise.\n\nThey play their Action and Player #2 plays Belay That [Avast, Stop That] to cancel it.\n\n–> can Player #1 use the Surprise in their mini-hand to cancel that Surprise,\n\n–> and if so do they still get to play their Keeper afterwards?\n\nA: Yes, you can use a Surprise from your main hand, or from your sub-hand, to cancel another player’s Surprise during your Draw 3, Play 2 Action. Playing a Surprise to cancel a Surprise is a free action, so yes, you would get to play the third card if your second card is a Surprise that you use to counter a Surprise being used to stop your first card.\n\nUsing Goal Bonanza also results in the play of a “sub-hand” while the rest of your hand is put aside, and the same things would apply there as well. Yes, you can counter-Surprise from either your main hand or your sub-hand.\n\nIn the case of Fizzbin, you don’t have the option of using any of the cards in your temporary hand, you have to play them blind, in random order, so any Surprises that are in that temporary hand won’t be useful to you – but you can still use Surprises in your set-aside hand to counter Surprises played against cards played as part of your Fizzbin action.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If a player uses Trade Hands, and their hand contains Stop That (which cancels actions) can the other player use it immediately upon receipt to cancel the Trade Hands?\n\nIn this scenario Player #1 has the Trade Hands and Stop That, and Player #2 is being forced to trade hands.\n\nA: No. If the surprise were in Player #2’s hand, then Player#2 could use it to stop the Action, but if the surprise is in Player #1’s hand, then Player #2 does not have access to the card until after the Trade Hands Action has been resolved, by which time it’s too late to be stopped.\n\nIf you think about it too hard, you’ll realize it can ONLY work this way. If it worked the way you described there would be a paradoxical loop:\n\nYou used the Stop That you received in Trade Hands to stop Trade Hands, so you didn’t trade hands, so you didn’t have the Stop That, so you couldn’t use it, so you traded hands, but then you had the Stop That, and you used it to prevent the Trade Hands, but then you didn’t have it, didn’t use it, but then you traded and had it…\n\n…and so forth to insanity.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Regarding Canceled Plans and Stop That, if you play them during your turn, it says “All other players must discard one Goal/Action, or a random card, from their hands.” Does that mean players get a choice?\n\nOr must you discard a Goal/Action if you have one, and a random card only if you don’t?\n\nA: Players get to choose. They may either look at their cards and select a Goal/Action to give up, or they may select a random card from their hand to give up. Of course, if they don’t have any Goals/Actions, they can only opt to lose a random card.\n\nNote that random means RANDOM. They don’t get to decide which card they give up in this case. They can do this either by mixing their own hand face down, and pulling one out without looking, or they can have you pull one from their hand as they hold it up facing themselves.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: If I have specific Creepers required for a Goal, but I also have other Creepers, can I still win with that goal?\n\nA: In the vast majority of cases, you cannot win if you have Creepers not specifically required by the goal.\n\nExceptions:\n\n• Do your extraneous Creepers say that they keep you from winning? (Almost all Creepers do, but if they don’t then go for it.)\n\n• Is there a Rule in play that lets you win even if you have Creepers? (There are a couple of these, depending on which versions you have.)\n\n• In Batman Fluxx, if the Goal requires a Villain, Villains don’t prevent you from winning. However, if the Goal does NOT require a Villain, then Villains ANYWHERE prevent you from winning.\n\n• In Nature Fluxx (aka EcoFluxx) all Creepers prevent everyone from winning, regardless of who has them.\n\nSee also: The… Goal requires a Keeper and either of two Creepers…\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: For Actions that re/distribute Keepers and/or Creepers among the players, how are those dealt back out?\n\nDo I get to decide who gets what? Do I get to decide how many to deal to each player? Do the recipients put them in their hands or on the table in front of them? Are they face up or face down? When I’m dealing them out, who do I start with?\n\nA: First of all, only for Everybody Gets 1 (or Dreams & Omens) does the active player get to look at and decide who gets what. That’s a very different situation that the ones we’re talking about here. This question focuses on random (fairly even) redistribution along the lines of Share The Wealth.\n\nThe cards in question are shuffled or otherwise randomized so that the dealer does not know what’s being given out. They are then dealt out evenly, going around the circle clockwise, one card to each player in turn, continuing until the cards are all gone. Dealing starts with either the active player or the player to their left, with the intention of providing any possible benefit to the active player.\n\n• So if it’s for Keepers, or a mixture of Keepers and Creepers, the active player should get the first card, because this is felt to be to their advantage, so they won’t get shorted if the number doesn’t deal out evenly. However, we would consider it an officially sanctioned house-rule if your group wanted to give the active player the option of starting with the player to their left instead of themselves. There could be reasons…\n\n• For redistribution of Creepers-only, the card will usually say to start with the player to the left of the active player, because Creepers are generally considered a disadvantage, and this would mean that if anyone was going to receive fewer, it would always be the active player. However, as with other redistribution cards, your group may choose to let the active player decide whether they want to start with themselves or the person on their left. Again, we can think of reasons why someone might want to start distributing Creepers to themselves first.\n\nOnce dealt, all cards will be put into play immediately, so it’s OK to deal them out face up, but it’s sometimes better to deal them out face down, then have everybody reveal what they got all at once. As mentioned above, re/distributing by dealing will cause all players to end up with roughly equal numbers of cards. So if there are large discrepancies in the number of cards players had in play, this will even them out: players with a lot more than other players will end up with fewer than they had, and players with few or zero cards in play may end up with more. That’s the way it goes.\n\nHere’s a list of redistributing cards, and their types:\n\nKeepers only\n\nShare the Wealth\n\nMonster Mash\n\nRun!!!\n\nThe Grand Ball Keepers & Creepers\n\nMix It All Up\n\nZombie Jamboree\n\nCrawling Chaos\n\nMass Hysteria\n\nIt’s a Cyclone!!! Creepers only\n\nReturn of the Dead\n\nJailbreak/removal of Arkham Asylum rule\n\nScramble Keepers, which is only in early versions of “Basic” Fluxx (1.0-3.x) is the only Action which is different. While you still shuffle up the Keepers and hand them back randomly and they go back into play, you don’t deal them out evenly, but instead give each player the same number of Keepers they had before. When we came up with Share The Wealth, we felt it was far superior, as we liked the way it leveled the playing field, keeping the game more competitive, to maximize player engagement.\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Does the Rule Mystery Play require one to play the specific card flipped up from the top of the deck?\n\nMy friends think you can add it to you hand, and play some other card from their hand.\n\nA: You are correct, your friends are incorrect. You pull the top card off the deck, and immediately play that card. You do not get to add it to your hand, or play any other card from your hand.\n\nAlso see: What are all the different cards in different versions where you get to draw the top card and play it immediately?\n\nBack To Top\n\nQ: Do Keeper Limits apply to Creepers as well?\n\nA: No. There is no limit to the number of Creepers you can have in front of you.\n\nBack To Top"
