        "text": "In two days Doctor Who arrives on Disney+! That means the trio of Doctor Who 60th anniversary specials will kick off with Doctor Who: The Star Beast! And many new viewers will be trying Doctor Who for the first time just as older viewers return to see where the Whoniverse is now! So this seemed like a good time to write a short (and I do mean short as the number of Doctor Who episodes can be most off-putting for newbies) “Guide to Doctor Who” to give new viewers everything they need to jump right in! It’ll also have a short rundown on major plot points for returning viewers. You’re in good hands too, as I teach a class on Doctor Who where the majority of my students have never seen it so I’ve got the short intro down ;D. And if you’re reading this and you’re new to the world of Doctor Who, WELCOME. I’m so happy you’re here! I’m also excited (and a little envious) that you get to do all this for the first time! There’s nothing like it. If I lived in a cruel, dystopian world where I could only participate in one fictional universe, I’d walk away from Marvel, DC, the Ghostbusters, TMNT, Star Wars, and all the TV shows I watch again and again for Doctor Who…and I’d never look back :). Are you ready? I’m ready! Allons-y!\n\nBy the way, “Allons-y” was the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant)’s catchphrase and it’s French for “let’s go.” See? You’ve already learned something! Go you!\n\nI think it’s important to note you can just watch Doctor Who on Disney+. You don’t need to know anything before you begin! Russell T Davies, the returning Doctor Who showrunner, wouldn’t’ve had it start on Disney+ with Doctor Who Season 1, episode 1, if it wasn’t welcoming to new viewers. But if you still want a little background care of my Doctor Who Guide for New Viewers (and, if you’re still reading, I take it you do ;D), then let’s get to it!\n\nThe Doctor:\n\nThe Doctor is an alien who’s over 2,000 years old. Each time they near death, whether from old age or sickness or a mortal wound, they regenerate. This means they get a new face, a new body, and a new personality but they keep all their memories from their previous lives. They can travel anywhere in time or space with the TARDIS – that blue police box – and it’s bigger on the inside! The TARDIS isn’t strictly a machine; it’s sentient, a living organism which doesn’t always take you where you want to go but always where you need to be.\n\nFor the first time, the Doctor has regenerated into a familiar form! Confused, the Fourteenth Doctor (don’t get hung up on numbers, it’s just a way to differentiate in Doctor Who conversation, not something used in the show) finds himself wearing the face of the Tenth Doctor again – a face he hasn’t had in over 1,000 years.\n\nDonna Noble:\n\nThe Doctor always travels with a companion(s), usually a human being from the same time the show is airing, and they become a handy vehicle for exposition. As the Doctor explains everything about their life, the worlds they visit, and the beings they meet to their companion, they also explain it to us!\n\nDonna was one of the Doctor’s best friends. They travelled together in 2008, the last time the Doctor had this face. To save her life, the Doctor had to wipe all her memories of their time together and install a memory block. If Donna remembers the Doctor, she’ll die. Now, twenty years later for Donna and 1,000+ years later for the Doctor, something seems to be drawing them back together…\n\nKate Stewart and UNIT:\n\nKate Stewart runs UNIT (or the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce), a scientific research and military organization designed to investigate extraterrestrial and paranormal events and combat those posing a threat to Earth. The Doctor has worked closely with UNIT since the 1970s, when Kate’s father – Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart – was running the taskforce. They work to protect the Earth when the Doctor isn’t around and whenever things become too much for UNIT to handle on their own, they try to find the Doctor.\n\nCongratulations! You’re ready!:\n\nThat’s all you need to know to watch Doctor Who on Disney+ even if you’ve never seen a single episode before! And yes, of course there will be characters who pop up and events referenced you won’t know about but – with the Doctor’s exposition to Donna, Kate, and whoever else he’s working with – you’ll get everything you need to know.\n\nPlus, part of the fun of becoming a Doctor Who fan is wading into the legacy. There’s over sixty years of characters and plot points so there’s always more fun waiting! Learning as you go is part and parcel of being a Doctor Who fan. So the first time you hit a character it feels like you should know but you don’t and you have to wait for in-show exposition, well that’s just Doctor Who saying, “Welcome to the family!”\n\nIf you’re a returning fan who hasn’t watched the show in awhile, here’s a quick rundown of the major story beats you may’ve missed. If you’re a brand new viewer, feel free to read on, too! It’s a bit more of the lore for you.\n\nThe Timeless Child and the Flux:\n\nNo matter what the last episode was of Doctor Who you watched, you know the Doctor and their companions have been running down corridors, facing Daleks/Cybermen/the Master/new foes, dodging laser blasts, making speeches, and proving victory comes not with weapons and fighting but through being clever and kind. Though Chris Chibnall did introduce an exciting new layer to the Doctor Who story and Russell T Davies has been very clear he likes it, won’t be retconning it, and both the Timeless Child and the Flux will be mentioned in Doctor Who: Wild Blue Yonder, the second 60th anniversary special.[1]\n\nThe Thirteenth Doctor learned she wasn’t, in fact, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. Rather she was a being called the Timeless Child, from an unknown universe, kidnapped when she was young and taken to Gallifrey where the soon-to-be Time Lords would reverse engineered their ability to regenerate from her. The Doctor can regenerate an unlimited number of times and has lived for unknown millions of years, though her memories (of any life not seen on the show) have been taken from her. This restores the mystery to the Doctor’s origins (being a Time Lord was a retcon added in 1968) and opens up the potential for future storytelling not limited by regenerations! It also lets us have David Tennant back as a full-on regeneration without “wasting” a life!\n\nThe Flux was a universe-destroying event, unleashed as Time (imprisoned by the Time Lords in the early days of the universe when magic and chaos were reined in and the rules of physics put in place) was set free and eroded much of the universe. It’s unclear if the Doctor just stopped it or undid it…so hopefully Russell T Davies lets us know!\n\nCue Up Disney+ and Let’s Watch Doctor Who:\n\nAnd there you have it, dear reader. You’re ready to go! As I said at the top, I don’t think you’ll need this. Russell T Davies will have you covered. But now you’ve got a little background going in all the same.\n\nThere really isn’t another hero like the Doctor or any other story or fictional universe like Doctor Who. And it makes my heart so happy you’re thinking of jumping in and giving the show a go! I am so excited for the Disney Distribution Era because, with Disney’s reach, more people will get to see Doctor Who! And that makes me smile and our world a little brighter.\n\nAs Steven Moffatt, the Doctor Who showrunner for Series 5-10, said, “When they made this particular hero, they didn’t give him a gun — they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. They didn’t give him a tank or a warship or an X-wing fighter — they gave him a call box from which you can call for help. And they didn’t give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat ray — they gave him an extra heart. They gave him two hearts. And that’s an extraordinary thing. There will never come a time when we don’t need a hero like the Doctor.”[2]\n\nWelcome to the family! Or welcome back! It’s so exciting that you’re here! Also, HAPPY DOCTOR WHO DAY! Sixty years ago today, 23 November 1963, Doctor Who aired on the BBC for the very first time! So, for new viewers, you’re also gaining a new holiday and that’s fun :). Also also, for me (and if you’re an American reader), it’s Thanksgiving and I am so very thankful for you, dear reader. I love writing so much and the fact that you’ve stopped by my little corner of the internet and spent part of your day with something I’ve written means the world. I love you. I appreciate you. And I hope you have a beautiful day.\n\nIf you’re excited to start watching Doctor Who or, if you’ve tried it on Disney+ and are thinking of giving the older episodes a shot, here are some other short essays which you may like!\n\nShould I Begin Watching Doctor Who? / How to Begin Watching Doctor Who addresses the biggest concerns people may about jumping into a show with sixty years of history and also offers some suggestions about where would be good places to start (and why) viewing Doctor Who!\n\nWhere to Start Watching Doctor Who for the First Time explores several places in the show’s long history where you can easily jump in without any previous knowledge – including my personal recommendation of the best place to start and where I begin with my students in my Doctor Who class!\n\n[1] Patrick Cremona, “Doctor Who’s second 60th anniversary special will have Flux connection,” Radio Times.
