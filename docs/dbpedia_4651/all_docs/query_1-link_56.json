        "text": "When you go to the doctor for your annual check-up, if you have insurance, you may expect that visit to be fully covered. The I-Team learned that's not always the case.\n\nPatients say they have been billed for asking or answering typical health questions at their wellness visit. Elaine Gearheart is one of them. She told the I-Team during a wellness visit with a pediatrician at her medical provider, she brought up how her child was getting headaches and then was charged.\n\n\"It really surprised me,\" said Gearheart.\n\n\"My daughter had been complaining about some headaches at school and the advice was to keep doing the log and maybe try a sugary drink,\" she explained.\n\n\"There was a $114 charge on there for an office visit.\"\n\nGearheart showed us the bill. Her insurance covered most of the charge. So, she only had to pay about $40. But when she called to dispute the bill, that didn't work.\n\n\"They were like well, they gave you a treatment, and therefore it's non-negotiable,\" Gearheart said.\n\nAnother mom, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the I-Team over the phone, she was charged an extra $70 at her toddler's yearly check-up visit for discussing a few typical health care topics like bed-wetting.\n\nThe woman learned the \"medical visits\" charge on her explanation of benefits included a \"urinary incontinence\" diagnosis.\n\nThose medical billing cases involved kids, but we've also heard from adult patients who had similar experiences but with different medical providers like Kris Ender.\n\n\"It was a normal check-up physical which is supposed to be fully covered,\" said Ender, who said she was charged $78.65 for talking with her doctor about a minor eczema rash she had during her annual preventative exam.\n\nIt was billed to Ender's insurance as an additional office visit.\n\n\"Unfortunately that's the nature of our health care system's billing right now is a fee-for-service model,\" said independent patient advocate Chris Van Haren with A Better Way Professional Health Advocacy LLC.\n\nVan Haren says what you talk about during your yearly check-up can cost you extra. It all depends on your medical provider's policy.\n\n\"If you have new symptoms that you want addressed, that goes above that preventative care, it's no longer preventative, it's now a diagnostic visit,\" she explained.\n\nThe Wisconsin Hospital Association echoed that explanation and provided the below response to the I-Team:\n\n\"It's really difficult. It's difficult to understand our system. It's just as difficult for the doctors, and all of the providers, to understand the system as well,\" Van Haren said.\n\nAs a patient, however, you aren't powerless. Van Haren suggests before bringing up a health concern, ask your doctor if you will see an extra charge. Before your wellness visit, you can also call the billing office and ask them the same question. Finally, you can always fight the charge, by filing an appeal.\n\n\"It's an uphill battle right now because everybody is short on time,\" she said.\n\nShe stresses you need to realize what you're up against. A lot of patients are rescheduling neglected doctors visits and COVID overall is still taxing our healthcare system.\n\nFor Elaine Gearheart, it's not about the money, it's the principle. The nearly $40 charge upset her so much, she switched providers.\n\n\"I'm one that likes to pay my bills on time, so I just ate the $40 and decided that was the last $40 they were going to get from us.\""
