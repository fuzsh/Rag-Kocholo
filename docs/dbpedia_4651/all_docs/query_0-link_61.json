        "text": "Magic: The Gathering is setting out to explore time and space in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™. Doctor Who™ first premiered in 1963, so we're helping celebrate their anniversary with a new Universes Beyond set. As Magic turns 30 and Doctor Who™ turns 60, it's time to learn all about the new cards you can find in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™.\n\nIf you missed our debut livestream, don't worry! We'll provide you with a handy guide of the different treatments, products, and secrets in this exciting Universes Beyond release. We're so excited to have you join us on this timey-wimey adventure when the set releases on October 13, 2023. You can preorder it now from online retailers like Amazon, your local game store, and elsewhere Magic products are sold.\n\nMagic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Set Details\n\nSet Code: WHO\n\nMagic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Set Legality: Legacy, Vintage, and Commander\n\nMTG Arena Legality: Not available on MTG Arena\n\nWebsite: Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™\n\nMagic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Important Dates\n\nPreviews: October 3–6\n\nThe Command Zone Podcast's Extra Turns Gameplay: October 11\n\nGlobal Launch: October 13\n\nLaunch Party Events: October 13–15\n\nThe Booster Fun of Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™\n\nWe wanted to capture the otherworldly beauty seen in the Doctor Who™ series through Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™. Throughout their many journeys, the Doctor has visited several planets, timelines, and even met themself. With Doctor Who™, there's no telling where you'll end up next. That's why when you shuffle up one of the four Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Commander decks, it'll feel just like you're taking off in the TARDIS with the Doctor.\n\nTraditional Foils and Surge Foils\n\nIf you're a fan of foils, you've come to the right place in time and space! Each Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Commander deck contains two traditional foil cards: the face commander and the featured commander. Those hoping to join the Doctor can find the Doctors and their companions leading three of the four decks. For fans of villainy in all its forms, you'll find Davros, Dalek Creator and Missy in the Masters of Evil deck.\n\nYou'll also be able to find every card in the Commander decks, apart from the plane cards, in traditional foil in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Collector Boosters. Every Eternal-legal card, like reprints, new-to-Magic cards, and tokens, will be available in Collector Boosters!\n\nIn addition, we've brought back a fan-favorite foil treatment: surge foils! These give an electrifying shine to your cards that's sure to catch the eye of your fellow Commander players.\n\nIn addition to traditional foil versions, surge foil versions of Commander cards (except plane cards) from this set can be found in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Collector Boosters, too!\n\nTARDIS Showcase Treatments\n\nThe TARDIS is travelling somewhere new: into the Magic card frame! In this set, 30 cards—3 uncommons, 23 rares, and 5 mythic rares—have variant TARDIS showcase treatments. They depict the characters of Doctor Who™ with special stylized artwork inside of a beautiful blue TARDIS frame. The Doctor, their companions, and even their enemies can be found in the TARDIS showcase frame.\n\nCards with the TARDIS showcase treatment are only available in Collector Boosters. While the traditional versions of these cards more closely resemble their live-action counterparts, the TARDIS showcase variants add a stylistic flourish that Whovians are sure to love. You can find these treatments in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Collector Boosters.\n\nExtended-Art Cards\n\nWhile Magic cards aren't bigger on the inside (yet!), you'll be able to find extended-art variants of these cards where more of the Doctor Who™ artwork is on display. Rare and mythic rare reprints and new-to-Magic cards will receive the extended-art treatment. Please note: Sagas do not have extended-art frames and won't receive the extended-art treatment.\n\nExtended-art cards can also be found in traditional foil and surge foil. All extended-art reprints and new-to-Magic cards can be found in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Collector Boosters in non-foil, traditional foil, and surge foil.\n\nSerialized Doctor Cards\n\nYou may cross timelines with serialized variants of the Doctor. Each main incarnation of the Doctor, from the First Doctor to the Thirteenth Doctor, will receive a serialized variant with the TARDIS showcase treatment. Printed in beautiful double rainbow foil and marked with their own serial number, each card will receive only about 500 printings and can only be found in Collector Boosters.\n\nSerialized Doctor cards are localized in English only and are available in Magic: The Gathering® – Doctor Who™ Collector Boosters of any language.
