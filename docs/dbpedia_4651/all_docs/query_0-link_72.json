        "text": "More Tom for all! The Fourth Doctor Adventures moves to a three volume format with Series 11\n\nThere’s bonus Baker in the upcoming Doctor Who – The Fourth Doctor Adventures, with extra full-cast audio adventures now planned throughout 2022 and 2023. In addition to the stories already announced for each series, a third release will now be added to both Series 11 and Series 12. This brings the Fourth Doctor into line with the recent changes in release format for the other Doctor Who ranges from Big Finish.\n\nProducer David Richardson said: “It perhaps won’t have escaped listeners’ notice that our schedules will look very different from next year, with each Doctor getting their own ongoing range of three-disc box sets. With Series 11 and 12 of the Fourth Doctor Adventures recorded so far in advance, the change in format required the addition of an extra story to each – which we approached with excitement and joy!\n\n“It gave us an opportunity to add new flavours to the series – a surreal excursion to another world with Mervyn Peake in Peake Season, and a moving character piece in The Ghost of Margaret. Things have worked out for the best – these stories are just the loveliest bonus, adding so much more to the line-up.\n\n“How wonderful to think, 40 years after the Fourth Doctor regenerated at the end of Logopolis, we can look forward to more TARDIS trips with Tom Baker than ever before.”\n\nThe additional tales are:\n\nPeake Season by Lizbeth Myles\n\nThe Ghost of Margaret by Tim Foley\n\nPeake Season will be released as part of The Fourth Doctor Adventures: Series 11 Volume 2 in June 2022, and The Ghost of Margaret will be released as part of The Fourth Doctor Adventures: Series 12 in June 2023.\n\nThis makes the complete line up for the next two years of Tom Baker escapades:\n\nSeries 11\n\n11.1 Blood of the Time Lords by Timothy X Atack\n\n11.2 The Ravencliff Witch by David Llewellyn\n\n11.3 The Dreams of Avarice by Guy Adams\n\n11.4 Shellshock by Simon Barnard and Paul Morris\n\n11.5 Peake Season by Lizbeth Myles\n\nSeries 12\n\n12.1 Ice Heist! by Guy Adams\n\n12.2 Antillia the Lost by Phil Mulryne\n\n12.3 The Wizard of Time by Roy Gill\n\n12.4 The Friendly Invasion by Chris Chapman\n\n12.5 Stone Cold by Roland Moore\n\n12.6 The Ghost of Margaret by Tim Foley\n\nAs previously announced, Tom Baker returns as the Fourth Doctor alongside companion Leela (Louise Jameson) and new friend Margaret Hopwood (Nerys Hughes) across the series, running into old enemies including the Ice Warriors and Weeping Angels.\n\nDoctor Who: The Fourth Doctor Adventures\n\nEach volume of Doctor Who – The Fourth Doctor Adventures: Series 11 and Series 12 is now available to pre-order individually as a collector’s edition box set (on CD at £24.99 each) and as a digital download (at £19.99 each), exclusively from www.bigfinish.com. Big Finish listeners can also pre-order each complete series (both volumes together) in a bundle for £46 on CD or £39 on download.\n\nPlease note that Big Finish is currently operating a digital-first release schedule. The mail-out of collector’s edition CDs may be delayed due to factors beyond our control, but all purchases of this release unlock a digital copy that can be immediately downloaded or played on the Big Finish app from the release date."
