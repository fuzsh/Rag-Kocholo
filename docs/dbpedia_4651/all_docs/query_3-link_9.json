        "text": "Yay – thanks for setting this one up @craig.\n\nAs we are in the 50th Anniversary year I thought it might be fun to talk about companions past and present. This could be favourites, wishes for the future, pet hates even…\n\nThere is a fun “extra” on the DVDs in Moffat’s first season where the TARDIS shows Amy images of past companions and she ribs the Doctor about how many of them happen to be young attractive Earth females. One of the reasons I like the Dreamlord episode so much it that it addresses this proclivity of the Doctor’s (that he “likes them young” – legally young, I should hasten to add, whatever that might mean to a TimeLord, of course) because he is looking to re-experience a sense of wonderment at the many mysteries of the universe through their innocent eyes.\n\nThe Doctor, funnily enough, has become progressively younger (in terms of appearance and the age of the actors playing him) as he has aged on our screens. Although Matt Smith has been, and is, absolutely wonderful, I think his ability to play “old” in his twenties is a rather rare actor’s gift and I must say that if some sort of misguided “audience demographic” calculation insists that the next regeneration also be in his/ her twenties when they commence, I will be disappointed.\n\nCompanion-wise, I have favourites past and present, as we all do I’m sure. I’m a River fan, as those of you who know me from the Guardian blog will appreciate. However, I’m particularly delighted by Jenny and Vastra as occasional travelling companions. Not only do the two actresses have great chemistry, but it is a pleasure to see a non-homo-sapiens companion in the person of Madame V.\n\nNu Who received a fair amount of idle online flak initially (although surprisingly not as much as I thought it might) for being quotes “PC” in its inclusion of LGBT characters, but now it has become something of a tradition. The fact that Jenny and Vastra are in a female-female inter-species overt relationship warms the cockles of my heart. Obviously (as the Beeb is not HBO) their private life is going to remain private (or rather, exhaustively confined to fan-fiction) but the gentle expansion of world-view this affords to children makes me happy.\n\nWishes for future companions? I’m getting a teensy bit tired of “the Doctor has to snog all of his companions at least once” trope. I might quite enjoy seeing a future Doctor briefly travelling with some haughty and gorgeous alien (any gender) on whom he has a hopeless and unrequited crush!\n\nIf I had to identify a favourite it would have to be Romana II. I was very disapointed that she did not accompany her husband to Australia last year. While everyone else was lining up to get books signed by him I would have been lining up with an armfull of Dr Who books for her to sign. I liked Romana because she could hold her own against the Dr. Other favourites, (I have quite a lot of them) include Barbara and Ian. There was a good dynamic between them. When critics remark upon the earlier “feeble woman” type assistant I get rather annoyed. Barbara was no feeble woman. Leela was good because she was tough and even developed a little as a character. A pity she and Tom Baker did not get along. Sarah Jane was special of course. When she died it felt like loosing a friend. I did not like any of the post Romana II assistants until Ace.\n\nNu Who assisants have been far more developed as individuals and brought more to the story. I like this however at times it has been over done. Love-lorn Rose became tiresome. I don’t think RTD knew how to make Martha inteseting. Donna was excellent and Wilf was an added bonus. Turn Left is one of my favourite Nu Who episodes. I found Amy annoying at first but the Amy/Rory combination worked very well. So not so keen on Amy as assistant but loved Amy/Rory as assistant. Clara has potential to be good but I really really don’t want more shoehorned in romance on the Tardis. The Doctor is a 900 year old alien, not a love object.\n\nCheers\n\nJanette.\n\nLooking back to the RTD era – I think my favourite companion had to be Donna. Which really surprised me, as I was a bit wary about the announcement based on her performance in Runaway Bride.\n\nI actually loved what they did with the character. The bolshy bravado we’d seen previously was a mask for a troubled woman who genuinely thought she was worthless. Having that mother couldn’t of helped. The fact she just thought the Doctor was brilliant, but wasn’t attracted to him in any way just set the scene for a marvellous friendship, crashing about through space and time. The dialogue helped with a level of piss-taking that I could only remember being matched by Romana II.\n\nHer tears at the fate of the Ood, her appeal for the Doctor just to save someone from Pompeii, and her palpable joy in her adventures with the Doctor just made me love her. Her hug of the Doctor at the end of “Midnight” just encapsulated their friendship for me.\n\nTo be backed up by the mighty Bernard Cribbins as Wilf was just the icing on the cake. I still think that “Turn Left” is a gem of an episode. After all we went through in series 4 – her fate at the end left me in tears. It actually seemed worse than physical death.\n\nIt didn’t surprise me that Catherine Tate and David Tennant became such good friends – later to appear in theatre together.\n\nThere was a series called “Chain Reaction” on Radio Four. The idea was simple – it was a chat show. The previous week’s interviewee became the following week’s interviewer. One marvellous week saw Catherine Tate interview David Tennant. It’s genuinely hilarious in parts. This is a link to it on YouTube (Part 1 of 3, but you can link to the rest from it).\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBXB49zublM\n\nFavourite companion? Such a tough question.\n\nSo, I will go about it a different way (how odd for me!)\n\nIn Hartnell’s time, the most important companions were Ian and Barbara. But my favourite companion was Vicki – mostly because of the change she wrought in Hartnell. She made him happier, lighter, and friendlier – and I loved her for that.\n\nIn Troughton’s time, the most important companion was Jamie. But Zoe was my favourite companion of the Troughton era. She sparked so well with both Jamie and Troughton that she brought the absolute best out of them both.\n\nIn Pertwee’s time, the most important companion was Jo Grant. But Sarah-Jane Smith was my favourite companion of the Pertwee era. Pertwee’s dynamic with Jo was very different to his dynamic with Sarah – and she never let him get away with bad conduct. I thought she made Pertwee’s Doctor work harder and at a more sophisticated level and I never thought Pertwee was better than in his final year.\n\nIn Baker’s time, both Sarah-Jane Smith and Romana (both of them) were the most important, but Leela was my favourite. I don’t think Tom Baker was ever better than in Robots of Death and Talons of Weng-Chiang and the wonderful Higgins/Eliza relationship between the two of them was original and alarmingly good.\n\nIn Davison’s time, Tegan was the most important , but Nyssa was my favourite. There was something ineffable about Sarah Sutton, something graceful, vulnerable and worthwhile and she worked easily and smoothly with Davison. Her character had suffered more than any other companion, before or since, and yet she was always cheerful, positive and smart.\n\nIn Colin Baker’s time, Peri was the most important companion but my favourite was Mel. And only because she was fresh and Terror of the Vervoids the best Colin Baker story by a county mile.\n\nIn Sylvester McCoy’s time, Ace was both the most important companion and my favourite. She had no competition because Mel was not good with McCoy. But, in her own right, Ace was a new take on a travelling companion – she had her own mystery and she was cheeky, irreverent and she worked well with her Professor, even in the ghastliest of stories.\n\nMc Gann only had one outing so there is no contest there.\n\nFor Ecclestone, Rose was the most important character but my favourite was Captain Jack. Jack was so off-the-scale, so unexpected, so disturbing and likeable at once – he shook up the status quo in the TARDIS beautifully – and he made Rose work harder and better.\n\nFor Tennant, Rose and Donna were equally important, but Donna was my favourite. Her season with Tennant is, for me, the high-point of the rebooted series. Everything Donna did was wonderful and her journey so beautifully plotted and so achingly ended. Both Rose and Donna were taken from the Doctor, but it was Donna’s loss, I think, that affected him more.\n\nFor Smith, Amy has, so far, been the most important companion, but Rory is my favourite. Rory made the dynamic between Smith and Amy work, he provided the heart which was otherwise sorely lacking and he was a complete and questioning character in his own right. He never point a foot wrong in my view – and he brought better work out of both Smith and Gillan.\n\nBut – ask me, overall, on an entire run of series basis, who the five “best” companions were and I would say:\n\nSarah-Jane Smith\n\nJamie McCrimmon\n\nDonna Noble\n\nIan Chesterton and Barbara Wright (they were an inseparable Double Act)\n\nLeela\n\nEach of those helped “make” their Doctors who they were in distinctive and diverse ways. And I love them all for that.\n\nSarah did it twice. And she certainly made an impact on Tennant’s Dr too.\n\nOf course, there are two other characters who should be mentioned honourably, neither of who are “companions”: Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart and the TARDIS. Without them, honestly, where would we be?\n\nI’ll limit my thoughts to companions 2005 onward, as my classic who experience is pretty limited.\n\nRose – At the time, I wasn’t massively keen on Rose. On re-watching, I think it’s just that she’s very young, and that she reacts to things in such a different way to me that I find it hard to relate to her. I much prefer her interactions with Nine to Ten, and wasn’t too sorry when she left. I was also a little disappointed to see her brought back through series 4.\n\nMartha – She didn’t make much of an impact on me first time, but have grown to like her very much. Freema’s performance is good, and I really believed in her crush on The Doctor. I think her decision to leave The Doctor at the end of LotTL was admirable\n\nDonna – Definitely my favourite companion from the RTD era – her “best mates” relationship with The Doctor and the way she mellows him out are wonderful, and the heartbreaking way they are ripped asunder was really moving. I also think she had the best “domestics” of Ten’s companions – I’ve loved Cribbens since he was reading me stories on Jackanory as a kid.\n\nAmy – I find I have no strong feelings about Amy. Karen Gillan played the part well, but I found Amy to be an odd combination of bolshy and passive, and for all the growing she did as a person, her personality never felt fully formed. I’m not really sure why The Doctor was so potty about her, to be honest!\n\nRory – Now, Rory I did like. Self deprecating, slightly insecure, but faithful, brave and kind. And funny too. Arthur Darvill’s performance is great (he was good in Broadchurch, too), and I look forward to seeing him in a lot more stuff in the future.\n\nClara – She’s a bit new still, but I like her so far. I’ve seen people say she’s too similar to Amy, but I think she’s quite different actually. Although they share a sarcastic streak where Amy was flaky, Clara actually seems pretty solid and where Amy had built her life around the Doctor, Clara seems to have overcome her past and be comfortable with who she is now.\n\n@jimthefish\n\nHave to disagree with @htpbdet re. episode three. It was very much padding. Quality padding that brought much richness and texture to the secondary characters — which helps greatly in feeling trepidation for Litefoot and pathos for Casey in this episode, but padding nonetheless. But narratively speaking absolutely sod-all of any importance happens whatsoever. The only thing that really advances is that we learn what Weng-Chiang wanted the girls for and in terms of sheer story that could have been dealt with in a single scene. (Which is what Nu-Who would almost certainly have done.)\n\nOkay, fair enough. I guess it depends on what you describe padding as?\n\nIt seems on your definition, and I may have misunderstood, that if it does not really advance the action, its padding.\n\nOn that basis, then, episode three is entirely padding because this exchange occurs in episode two:\n\nWENG: I am dying, Chang. You must bring another linnet to my cage.\n\nCHANG: But only yesterday…\n\nWENG: The disease grows worse. Each distillation lasts less than the time before.\n\nCHANG: And with every girl reported missing, panic increases. I fear one of them will be traced here.\n\nDistillation makes it pretty clear what is happening to the girls I think?\n\nI guess I have a narrower definition of what constitutes padding. There is a lot of corridor running in Seeds of Death, for instance, which is padding; the multi-vehicle chase of Lupton in Planet of the Spiders; quite a lot of Android Invasion and Time Flight…too name just a few. These are the examples I think of as padding, together with, say, the manufactured quark cliff-hangers in Dominators.\n\nFor me, padding is material which does not add anything to the narrative.\n\nPerhaps the greatest example of padding in Doctor Who is episode one of The Mind Robber – nothing that happens there really needs to happen for the adventure in the Land of Fiction to begin. And yet…I don’t think anyone would characterize that episode as padding in the sense that “we would have a better story without it” or am I wrong about that?\n\nTo me, that initial episode sets up what is to come. It is an integral part of what makes Mind Robber unique and disturbing and exciting.\n\nIn the same way, it seems to me anyway, the detailed character work that is the backbone of episode three of Talons of Weng-Chiang sets up what follows and builds on what has happened, heightening the drama, upping the suspense and adding texture and depth to the proceedings, while allowing Leela, in particular, and the Doctor to take their central roles.\n\nI don’t think Talons of Weng-Chiang would be nearly as enjoyable or nearly as highly-regarded if it did not have all of the material in episode three.\n\nI am curious: do you think there is padding in AG Doctor Who?\n\nFor instance, is this padding?\n\nDARLA: First, there were the Daleks. And then, there was a man who fought them. And then, in time, he died. There are a few, of course, who believe this man somehow survived, and that one day he will return. For both our sakes, dearest Hannah, we must hope these stories are true.\n\nDOCTOR: I got your message. Not many people can do that. Send me messages.\n\nDARLA: I have a daughter, Hannah. She’s in a Dalek prison camp. They say you can help.\n\nDOCTOR: Do they? I wish they’d stop. I love your choice of meeting place.\n\nDARLA: They said I’d have to intrigue you.\n\nDOCTOR: Skaro. The original planet of the Daleks. Look at the state of it. Who told you about me?\n\nDARLA: Does it matter?\n\nDOCTOR: Maybe not, but you’re very well informed. If Hannah’s in a Dalek prison camp, tell me, why aren’t you?\n\nDARLA: I escaped.\n\nDOCTOR: No. Nobody escapes the Dalek camps. You’re very cold.\n\nDARLA: What’s wrong?\n\nDOCTOR: It’s a trap.\n\nDARLA: What is?\n\nDOCTOR: You are, and you don’t even know it.\n\nOr this?\n\nAMY: I’ll just be a minute.\n\nPA: Your husband is here.\n\nAMY: Hmm. I don’t have a husband.\n\nPA: Oh, well, apparently you still do.\n\nRORY: You have to sign these.\n\nAMY: And then we’re not married?\n\nRORY: Just like magic.\n\nAMY: Can’t chat. Working.\n\nRORY: Really? Thought you were just pouting at a camera.\n\nAMY: Rory?\n\nCASSANDRA: Sorry, love. Was I interrupting?\n\nAMY: No.\n\nCASSANDRA: Gosh, look at you. You’ve gone so pale. Come on, take a seat. We’ll soon sort that out.\n\nI ask only because I would like to understand what the consensus is about what “padding” is. I think I might not have it right in my mind.\n\n🙂\n\n@htpbdet @jimthefish\n\nmy two cents (for what its worth) is that padding should be defined along the lines of anything that is of no intrinsic value to the story or the characters and is really dull to watch.\n\nI’m sure Robert Holmes could have written this story which is around 2 hours long (cutting out the titles and the repeat of the cliff hanger) to fit 4 four parts (80 minutes) or even the current series format (45 minutes) IF he’d been required too. I guess he would have cut-out some of the music hall scenes, eliminated one of Lightfood or Jago (combining the two roles perhaps) shortened other scenes etc. I’m absolutely sure the end result would still have been one of the best stories ever made in either BG or AG Who.\n\nI guess which format you prefer to see (6, 4 or 1 part) is a matter of personal choice. I, along with HTPBDET I guess ?, prefer the 6 part format for this story and don’t see much if any padding in the writing or execution here. Other though wouldn’t survive the padding test.\n\nOne problem I have with some of the AG stories is the lack of padding if you like. In the recent Rings of Akhaten for example, the whole sacrifice/singing stuff I found a bit confusing and hence had little empathy for the main character (the little girl). More character and story development here would have improved the overall end result. That I found the end rather contrived and silly is purely down to my preferences regarding how a story should end.\n\nIn AG we now have a different sort of padding now as well surely ?\n\nTaking HTBPDET’s Amy/Rory dialogue as an example, did we really need the arc of their relationship embedded into the series ? I loved the duo because of what the actors and writers managed to do with their characters and the inter-play with each other and the Doctor. The ups and downs in their relationship didn’t add anything much for me.\n\nNick\n\n@jimthefish @htpbdet @nick\n\nOne person’s padding can be another person’s texture!\n\nJtF, I suspect you’re using “padding” in Talons context slightly mischievously, to provoke some discussion! (You say as much in your post). The chase round the backstage in Talons2 could be counted as padding I think, in classic Who running-about-corridors tradition. But the scenes with Jago, Casey, Litefoot add to the plot, drive up the tension and add a bit of well placed comic relief as well as building their own characters and giving a strong sense of setting and period context to the story. Yes you could amalgamate eg Jago and Litefoot into one character and lose Casey, but the story would be much less rich as a result.\n\nMany people in this story wear masks/disguise. Jago is outwardly confident, swaggering and convivial yet he’s also insecure, aware that his persona is a bluff; his closest human contact seems to be his employee Casey – they have an easy tolerance of each others faults which suggests a long term acquaintance. Litefoot is ostensibly a well to do professional man, the epitome of a succesful Victorian. Yet he too comes across as a solitary figure, slightly out of sync with his place and time. Chang too is not what he first appears, he is far more than the caricature of a mysterious oriental of his stage persona.\n\nBoth the real bad guys in Talons wear actual masks, which we have yet to see under, tho the glimpses so far are not promising!\n\nNick re Amy/Rory – you say you loved them because of their characters and the interplay between them, but could have done without their relationship ups and downs. Yet you wouldn’t know the characters so well if you hadn’t seen those moments. Eg in The Girl Who Waited, their relationship drives the plot – Amy’s anger at having been “abandoned”, her will to survive driven by her memory of Rory, Rory’s devotion regardless of how old she is – is made even more poignant by our previous knowledge of their ups and downs and their own insecurities about how the other one feels.\n\nAnything that doesn’t progress the narrative and, in effect, leaves it treading water is pretty much story padding.\n\n@jimthefish – no, that’s unnecessarily strict. The normal rule is that any line that doesn’t EITHER\n\nProgress the narrative OR\n\nProgress the characterisation OR\n\nmake the audience laugh\n\nshould be cut. The ideal line, of course, is one that does all three.\n\nFrom the rest of your post, I’d say that you know perfectly well that ‘progressing the characterisation’ isn’t padding 😉\n\nWould stories work as well without character progression? Nope – unless you’re writing an action-adventure. @nick – yes, you certainly could have had ‘The Girl Who Waited’ with a different set of characters. But it would’ve been a different story. And Amy would be a different person if you omitted the memory of Rory as her primary motivation. With Rory and Amy, Rory is the more obviously loving in relationship terms (which fits their respective personalities: Amy is assertive, easily angered and adventurous; Rory calm, caring, and domestic).\n\nSo it’s important to have stories where the audience is reminded that while Amy isn’t as demonstrative, her love for/need for Rory is as deep as his love for/need for her. Otherwise we won’t believe it when the time comes for them to leave: and they leave because Rory’s stuck and Amy – given the option – refuses to live without him.\n\nIn Pre-Gap Who, we wouldn’t have needed all this story arc for Amy and Rory, giving them a believable reason to leave the TARDIS. That’s not necessarily good – at the end of Leela’s story, for example, she leaves because she’s fallen in love with an entirely characterless Gallifreyan. In one scene, it appears, because both actors concerned were rather desperately searching through the scripts of that story to find anything, anything at all that would suggest that they had the slightest attraction to one another.\n\nIn After-Gap Who it’s admitted that travelling in the TARDIS is something so spectacular that Companions need a really good reason to leave. It’s either part of their arc (Amy won’t live without Rory, Martha’s family may be irritating, but she loves them more than she does the Doctor) or forced upon them by a catastrophic event (Rose, Donna).\n\nAnyway, going back to Weng-Chiang – they definitely don’t need this episode to progress the narrative. At all. Because Holmes is a superb writer, he’s gone for ‘progressing characterisation’ – we find out a lot about Chang, Jago, Litefoot and Casey. It’s really the difference between a short story and a novella; he’s got more room to progress the characters, and he’s taken it.\n\n@jimthefish\n\nI did not mean to suggest that those AG excerpts were padding – I was just trying to see what you thought about them viv-a-vis the Talons stuff.\n\nTo me the terms “padding” and “filler” are inherently derogatory, at least in a way. And while I do not mean you, I think a lot of people use them without really knowing what they are discussing.\n\nI totally agree with you about horizontal and vertical writing – and vertical writing always is the most satisfying in Television terms. Holmes was a master of it, but there were others too: David Whittaker, Brian Hayles, Chris Boucher – even Uncle Terrence clearly gets it.\n\nFor me, the Mrs Samuelson discussions have a clear purpose – they show that Jago is on the ropes and that he is not paying money where it is needed – which means that there is no security at the theatre and much more chance for Weng-Chiang to come and go. And the speech sets up the kind of relationship Jago has with Casey and reveals one of the many masks (spot on @scaryb) that he wears. That simple exchange tells us volumes about Jago and his assumed air of bombastic indifference and control – and that lets what happens later to Jago and Litefoot make a definite kind of sense.\n\nSo, while, strictly speaking they are not necessary for the tale being told, they have a real purpose – one that works and helps make the story the classic it is.\n\nPerhaps an alternative definition of padding would be writing that sponges off the main narrative but in a way that ultimately harbours resentment in the viewer.\n\nI like that definition and I think I agree with it entirely.\n\nA vertical story takes as long as it takes. Sometimes, especially in Pertwee’s time, the stories were really three episode stories or two episode stories, but budgets made them into four; or they were four or five episode stories made into six.\n\nAnd another time, it would be good to chew over War Games, a story with ten episodes about which I harbour no resentment of any scene (although I resent the ending entirely!!) I also found Dalek Masterplan quite remarkable – much much better than The Chase, for instance, which was half its length.\n\nAnd I think it is largely for that reason that I think the second excerpt from Asylum constitutes padding in my mind – or perhaps something worse: contrary narrative.\n\nAfter The Girl Who Waited why would there be a divorce? Why would Amy act so appallingly towards Rory? I never thought it was explained satisfactorily, or in a way that was coherent with what had gone before, and I thought it got entirely in the way of the drama of the actual story being told.\n\nI think this is what @nick is saying – but also wonder if this is the right place to have this discussion. I don’t want to incur @bluesqueakpip‘s rage…\n\n🙂\n\nOn a slightly different topic, I sometimes wish in AG Doctor Who that they would tell the story for as long as it takes – this might mean 1 and 1/2 episodes, so a story starts, has its 45 minutes and then finishes twenty minutes into the next episode, when the following story could begin. That simple formula could have made a big difference in, say, Bells of St John and Rings of Akhaten. Bells could have been told in shorter time than it was and the extra time would have assisted Rings.\n\n@bluesqueakpip (tempting rage here. This really isn’t the right place, but still..)\n\nyes, you certainly could have had ‘The Girl Who Waited’ with a different set of characters. But it would’ve been a different story. And Amy would be a different person if you omitted the memory of Rory as her primary motivation. With Rory and Amy, Rory is the more obviously loving in relationship terms (which fits their respective personalities: Amy is assertive, easily angered and adventurous; Rory calm, caring, and domestic).\n\nAbsolutely, the story would have been different and would have felt differently, but I don’t know that I completely agree with you that Amy would be a different character. As @HTBPDET comments above, the Amy/Rory separation was for me shoe horned in as it suited a particular angle that Mr Moffat wanted to highlight without any (apparent) real thought given to the reasons why it happened. In retrospect your explanation makes a lot of sense when we see how they departed together looking back across their story line, but did the elements really get us their.\n\nThere’s lots of different perspectives which is why I enjoy reading what is written here. Again, not the place, but I found that the mechanism Mr Moffat used to write the Amy/Rory characters out unsatisfactory on an emotional and intellectual level, but that’s me.\n\nIf you think about it\n\nTravelling in the TARDIS is something so spectacular that Companions need a really good reason to leave\n\nis just a writers conceit, even if its one we choose to believe and share. No sane Human Being I’ve met really wants to “suffer” multiple near death experiences, even if there are interludes (which we don’t see on screen too often) which are the complete opposite.\n\nI absolutely agree that the treatment of companions departures in Old Who was, most of the time, awful at the best.\n\nCheers\n\nNick\n\n@bluesqueakpip\n\nThe loss of a child and enduring a miscarriage are both matters with which, unhappily, I am personally familiar, although obviously not from the role of the mother.\n\nBut I did closely observe and care for McLeela during both times. And I watched my parents deal with their own issues and their own marriage.\n\nIts the timing of the breakdown of their relationship that I find most surprising about the segments in Asylum. That and the fact that Amy takes out her issues on Rory rather than the Doctor.\n\nBut I have serious issues with the way the whole “loss of Melody” arc was dealt with and, like @nick, did not find the Angels Take Manhattan resolution of Pond Time satisfying on any level. Well, except that Amy was finally gone.\n\nWe will now return you to your normal discussion of Weng Chiang by asking whether Pre Gap Doctors had much more experience of normal human life. Discuss\n\nI think they had plenty of experience of human life but they had almost no contact with the dynamic of specific personal relationships. But when they did, they usually acted as a healer or a catalyst for healing – I guess Victoria provides the best example: the Doctor takes her with him because she has no one and needs time to heal after the Daleks’ destruction of her father and then he leaves her with the Harris family because she needs a family and they need a daughter.\n\nBut the whole point of BG Doctor Who was that the companions did not lead normal lives when they traveled with the Doctor: they were always out of their place and time (with the odd hiccup for the Pertwee exile years).\n\nAs we know, AG Doctor Who deals with companions in a very different way. It will be interesting to see what now happens with Clara…\n\nI agree with @htpbdet that the Pond split as depicted in Pond Life was inconsistent with the character development to that point. (I am writing from memory however as I found this morning that we don’t have Pond Life “on file”.) The inference, as I recall, is that their relationship becomes acrimonious for no obvious reason, as some relationships do. However in AofD Amy reveals that she left Rory because she was unable to give him children and he wanted children. It might have been a poor decision but it is understandable and becomes for her proof of her love for him. The testing of her love for Rory was crucial to the story, it saved her from becoming a Dalek, at least until we discover that the Doctor has given her his wrist bracelet.\n\nAs to whether it is padding or not, I guess that depends upon whether one views the entire Amy/Rory relationship as padding or not. The problem with using a relationship to give a story emotional depth is that after a time it can get repetitive and the drama begins to feel contrived because ongoing conflict is necessary to generate tension. I think this was becoming the problem with the Amy/Rory thread. There was only so much tension that could be milked from their characters before the puppetier pulling the strings becomes too obvious. (The same problem weakened the final series of Fringe.)\n\nHope this makes sense. AS usual I my thoughts are rather muddled, ending up with a different argument to the one I started with.\n\nCheers\n\nJanette\n\n@janetteb – “The problem with using a relationship to give a story emotional depth is that after a time it can get repetitive and the drama begins to feel contrived because ongoing conflict is necessary to generate tension.” **\n\nI was reading this whole conversation yesterday, trying to distil my many conflicting feelings about the Amy/Rory relationship, and what you said here is very close to my problem (I’d only change it to say ‘using a relationship to create plot points’). Yes, it was repetitive in that way of ‘once again, Amy’s being condescendingly dismissive of Rory’ and ‘yes again, Rory’s dying (or living for 2000 years) because of the puppy-dog pureness of his flame for Amy’. To me, the disintegration of their marriage as a plot point felt like it was only there because even the writers were growing bored, too.\n\n@htpbdet – “the fact that Amy takes out her issues on Rory rather than the Doctor.”\n\nYes, that’s my other problem. I could understand a bit of reluctance for her Raggedy Man to have any responsibility for how her life was going (well, not ‘understand’ but have empathy that that is how Amy might view it). But by this time in their marriage the Doctor was showing up more intermittently and having less lasting impact; the ratio of ‘real life’ to ‘Doctor life’ was getting larger, and that should have made it easier for Amy to offload her issues on the absent person and not the real live one in front of her – and we as observers could see it was the Doctor’s fault, not Rory’s.\n\n** It is also, of course, what soap operas are all about, solely using relationships to create plots and ‘dramatic tension’. Which is why even though they are drearily repetitive (who’s having whose baby this time? {sigh}), they also start branching out into the seriously weird (X suddenly becomes a crack addict?!) and the frankly disturbing (teenaged girls being trafficked for sex) in an attempt to ramp up the ongoing conflict – until the whole thing explodes unedifyingly.\n\n@bluesqueakpip (and @htpbdet @jimthefish ) – “In After-Gap Who it’s admitted that travelling in the TARDIS is something so spectacular that Companions need a really good reason to leave.”\n\nThis is a really good conversation point for this topic – how and why the companions stop travelling with the Doctor. You’re well aware of the woeful amount I know of BG Who so I’m relying on your perceptions and thoughts to flesh this out.\n\nWouldn’t Sarah Jane Smith fall into your AG category, too, though? She was one of the unceremoniously dumped BG companions, and apparently found Tardis life so thrilling that she ended up devoting her life to similar (albeit Earth-bound) adventures.\n\nOther BG-ers were rudely memory-wiped (with none of Donna’s later ability to wake up and help save the world), or were lumbered with unconvincing new relationships which made them (metaphorically speaking) say ‘toodle-pip Doctor, off I go’, etc.\n\nI’d say that Martha doesn’t quite fit your AG companion category, either. After a year of tramping around the planet to help save the Doctor from the Master’s clutches (and birdcage), it’s safe to say she viewed her Tardis life increasingly more jadedly. Her reason for leaving, to me, was simply that she yearned for a normal life again.\n\nIt’s been said before, but is pertinent to this conversation to repeat, that the main difference between BG and AG companions is that the latter have real life / families to experience in between travelling and having adventures with the Doctor. Is this the crux, then, of the difference in how BG / AG companions leave their Tardis life?"
