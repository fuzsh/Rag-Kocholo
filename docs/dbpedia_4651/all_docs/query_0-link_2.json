        "text": "Since its beginning in 1963, Doctor Who has spawned a number of spin-offs that do not feature the Doctor as the main character, or, indeed at all.\n\nThese can be separated into two distinct categories: productions officially licensed by the BBC, whose lack of use of the Doctor or their TARDIS are a stylistic choice; and ones created without BBC involvement, grown around an element of the DWU owned by another party.\n\nWhile some series spin off directly from a Doctor Who-branded work, spinoffs can themselves engender spinoffs. The sum total of Doctor Who's licensed \"descendance\", provided they pass our four little rules of validity, comprise the DWU as we define it.\n\nPete McTighe stated in DWM 571 that he viewed each of his minisodes packaged with trailers for The Collection as \"the opportunity for a brand-new Doctor Who spin-off (…) albeit on a budget of 59p\", although these minisodes were still released under the Doctor Who name rather than having their own series names.\n\nOfficially licensed by the BBC[]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nK9 and Company[]\n\nMain article: K9 and Company (TV series)\n\nTorchwood[]\n\nMain article: Torchwood (TV series)\n\nThe Sarah Jane Adventures[]\n\nMain article: The Sarah Jane Adventures\n\nClass[]\n\nMain article: Class (TV series)\n\nProse[]\n\nSouvenir Press Ltd[]\n\n\"Dalek books\"\n\nWorld Distributors Ltd[]\n\n\"Dalek annuals\"\n\nTarget Books[]\n\nThe Companions of Doctor Who\n\nTurlough and the Earthlink Dilemma\n\nHarry Sullivan's War\n\nK9 and Company\n\nBBC Books[]\n\nThe Legends of Ashildr\n\nThe Legends of River Song\n\nThe Missy Chronicles\n\nI Am The Master: Legends of the Renegade Time Lord\n\nPanini Comics[]\n\nThe Paternoster Gang Investigates\n\nAudio[]\n\nSilver Fist/Who Dares[]\n\nThe ArcHive Tapes\n\nBig Finish[]\n\nMain article: Big Finish Doctor Who audio spin-offs\n\nBBC Audio[]\n\nBeyond the Doctor\n\nThe Kairos Ring\n\nBessie Come Home\n\nLondon, 1965\n\nSleeper Agents\n\nThe Penumbra Affair\n\nRedacted\n\nComics[]\n\nMarvel UK[]\n\nMain article: DWM backup comic stories\n\nThe Cybermen\n\nHome video[]\n\nDowntime [1]\n\nP.R.O.B.E.[2]\n\nOfficially licensed from individual copyright holders[]\n\nBeginning in 1987 with the release of Wartime by Reeltime Pictures, a number of professionally produced spin-off films and audio dramas have been produced. As noted above, these differ from BBC and Big Finish productions in that they usually only feature characters or monsters not owned by the BBC, but rather licensed from their creators. Some spin-offs are original works using original character strongly suggested by characters in Doctor Who (such as The Stranger). In many cases, original cast members from Doctor Who reprised their TV roles for these films and several involved behind-the-scenes veterans of the series (for example, Christopher Barry, who co-directed the very first Daleks story in 1963-64, directed Downtime).\n\nA number of writers and actors involved in these productions later went on to work with BBC licensed Doctor Who spinoffs such as the Big Finish Productions audio dramas, and even on the revived Doctor Who series itself when it returned to TV in 2005 (most notably Nicholas Briggs and Mark Gatiss). By way of comparison, these spin-off productions, often classified as fan films, are in spirit similar to the professionally made fan films based upon the Star Trek franchise that began to emerge in the early 2000s when the rights holders for Star Trek relaxed their restrictions. However, unlike the Star Trek fan films, all of the productions listed below were fully licensed.\n\nTelevision[]\n\nMetal Mutt Productions[]\n\nK9\n\nVideo[]\n\nReeltime Pictures[]\n\nWartime\n\nShakedown: Return of the Sontarans\n\nDowntime\n\nMindgame Saga\n\nDæmos Rising\n\nThe White Witch of Devil's End\n\nSil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor\n\nBBV Productions[]\n\nAuton Trilogy\n\nZygon: When Being You Just Isn't Enough\n\nAudio[]\n\nBBV Productions[]\n\nThe Time Travellers\n\nAdventures in a Pocket Universe\n\nZygon\n\nKrynoid\n\nSontarans\n\nThe I\n\nThe Rani\n\nWirrn\n\nFaction Paradox\n\nThe Faction Paradox Protocols\n\nDionus's War\n\nRutans (In 2 Minds)\n\nThe Quality of Mercy\n\nP.R.O.B.E.[2]\n\nNew Companions\n\nThe Brigadier Adventures\n\nErimem: The Audio Adventures\n\nBig Finish Productions[]\n\nVienna\n\nMagic Bullet Productions[]\n\nKaldor City\n\nThe True History of Faction Paradox\n\nBBC Radio 4[]\n\nImaginary Boys\n\nBafflegab Productions[]\n\nVince Cosmos: Glam Rock Detective\n\nStorytel[]\n\nMystery Lady\n\nRadio Static[]\n\nThe Minister of Chance\n\nAUK Studios[]\n\nChildren of the Circus\n\nProse[]\n\nSparrow Books[]\n\nThe Adventures of K9\n\nVirgin Books[]\n\nThe New Adventures (1997-99)\n\nMad Norwegian Press[]\n\nFaction Paradox (2002-06, 13)\n\nAllison & Busby[]\n\nTo the Devil — a Diva!\n\nRandom Static[]\n\nFaction Paradox (2008)\n\nTelos Publishing[]\n\nTime Hunter\n\nTelos novelisations\n\nOlive Hawthorne and the Dæmons of Devil's End\n\nDæmos Rising\n\nSil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor\n\nMindgame\n\nBig Finish Productions[]\n\nIris Wildthyme (2005)\n\nBernice Summerfield\n\nNew Worlds\n\nWildthyme on Top\n\nThe Coming of the Queen\n\nProject: Valhalla\n\nObverse Books[]\n\nIris Wildthyme (2009-present)\n\nFaction Paradox (2013-present)\n\nObverse Quarterly\n\nSeñor 105 & the Elements of Danger\n\nThe Casebook of the Manleigh Halt Irregulars\n\nThe Obverse Book of Detectives (The Unwoken Princess)\n\nThe Periodic Adventures of Señor 105\n\nThe City of the Saved\n\nWelcome Home, Bernard Socks\n\nObverse Sextet\n\nThe Mystic Menagerie of Iris Wildthyme\n\nThe Rise & Fall of Señor 105\n\nThe Immortal Seaton Begg\n\nHyponormalisation: A Faction Hollywood Production\n\nClosing the Casebook\n\nVanishing Tales of the City\n\nParadise Towers\n\nThe Berkeley Publishing Group[]\n\nThe Story of Fester Cat\n\nFirefly Press[]\n\nThe Lora Trilogy\n\nCandy Jar Books[]\n\nCounter Measures\n\nLethbridge-Stewart\n\nThe Lucy Wilson Mysteries\n\nTravers & Wells\n\nUNIT\n\nThebes Publishing[]\n\nErimem\n\nMeteoric Books[]\n\nK9:\n\nThe Essential Book of K9\n\nMegabytes\n\nArcbeatle Press[]\n\nP.R.O.B.E.\n\nCwej: The Series\n\nCyberon\n\nAuteur\n\nColoth\n\nSIGNET\n\nSnowbooks Ltd[]\n\nIris Wildthyme (2011-13)\n\nResurrection Engines\n\nFellowship of Ink\n\nCe Acatl[]\n\nGolden Age\n\nRyan Fogarty[]\n\nThe Bloodletters\n\nWringing Off\n\nBBV Productions[]\n\nNovelisations in Time & Space\n\nComics[]\n\nTV Century 21[]\n\nThe Daleks\n\nMarvel UK[]\n\nFree-Fall Warriors\n\nImage Comics[]\n\nFaction Paradox\n\nGraveyard Shift Comics[]\n\nThe Forge\n\nComeuppance Comics[]\n\nMiranda\n\nMeteoric Books[]\n\nThe Essential Book of K9\n\nLucky Comics[]\n\nDevil's End: The Adventures of Olive Hawthorne\n\nTelos Publishing[]\n\nSil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor\n\nCutaway Comics[]\n\nLytton\n\nOmega\n\nOmega\n\nThe Demons of Eden\n\nParadise Towers\n\nThe Happiness Patrol\n\nOne-shots\n\nOrcini\n\nEldrad Must Live!\n\nNon-fiction spin-offs[]\n\nBBC[]\n\nSince the revival of the Doctor Who franchise in 2005, several ongoing non-fiction series have been commissioned to supplement the main programmes. All primarily featured behind-the-scenes documentary coverage of production, but some also served as the venue for the release of some new licensed Doctor Who fiction: Totally Doctor Who included a serialised form of the animated serial The Infinite Quest, and The Fan Show frequently included more-or-less developed humorous skits.\n\nDoctor Who Confidential (2005-11)\n\nTotally Doctor Who (2006-07)\n\nTorchwood Declassified (2006-11)\n\nDoctor Who Extra (2014-15)\n\nThe Fan Show (2015-18)\n\nInside Look (2017)\n\nCloser Look (2018)\n\nAccess All Areas (2018-19)\n\nReeltime Pictures[]\n\nMyth Makers (1985-2016)\n\nMad Norwegian Press[]\n\nAHistory (2006-present)\n\nAbout Time (2006-present)\n\nObverse Books[]\n\nThe Black Archive (2016-present)\n\nOther[]\n\nDevious[]\n\nDevious is an incomplete privately made fan film notable for featuring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor in his final known performance in the role. Audio of Pertwee was reused by Big Finish Productions for the audio drama Zagreus. In 2009, a 12-minute excerpt/trailer from the production, featuring the extant footage of Pertwee, and which cannot really be deemed a complete narrative in its own right, was released by BBC Video with the DVD release of The War Games.\n\nNotwithstanding a few Reeltime-produced comedy skits included in previous DVD sets, this makes Devious to date the only fan/unofficial spin-off to actually be released by the BBC. It is not, however, by far, the only unlicensed spin-off project to have featured a DWU actor returning to their original part in an unauthorised context.\n\nNon-valid and non-covered spin-offs[]\n\nSome series feature characters and/or elements that originated in a Doctor Who universe story but do not pass this wiki's four little rules and as such are not considered valid; in some cases, their connection to Doctor Who is even so tenuous that they are not even covered on the Wiki at all.\n\nBBV[]\n\nDo You Have a Licence to Save this Planet? (video; featuring Autons, a Krynoid and a Sontaran)\n\nBig Finish[]\n\nThe Confessions of Dorian Gray (audio; featuring a version of Dorian Gray)\n\nEpic Comics[]\n\nThe Sleeze Brothers (comics; featuring the Sleeze Brothers)\n\nSnowbooks Ltd[]\n\nThe Brenda and Effie Mysteries\n\nBafflegab Productions[]\n\nBaker's End"
