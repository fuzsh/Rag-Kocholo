        "text": "Ever wanted to marathon all of Doctor Who post-2005 – plus the spin-offs – but felt a bit intimidated by the sheer size and scale of the task ahead of you?\n\nHere's an essential guide for anyone planning just such a venture: all official televised BBC canon, in the most suitable viewing order.\n\n(\"Chronological order\" is a bit of a dicey issue for a show that deals in time-travel, but this is the order that'll make most sense for the viewer.)\n\nHere are the rules: we've included all full-length episodes, as well any standalone scenes broadcast on television, made available online or released on DVD or Blu-ray.\n\nThough it's a sketchy area, we've omitted anything we feel falls obviously into the realm of parody – so no BAFTA or National Television Awards skits, no Comic Relief crossovers with Call the Midwife and no spoof scenes from Tonight's the Night or Brian Cox's The Science of Doctor Who.\n\nAlso nothing produced outside of the BBC makes our list, either – so we've left out that odd K-9 series from Australia. And while we love 'em to bits, no Big Finish audio plays either – just for the sake of clarity (and our sanity). Here we go...\n\n- Series 1\n\n- 2005 Children in Need special (a.k.a. 'Born Again')\n\n- 'The Christmas Invasion'\n\n- 'Attack of the Graske' (BBC Red Button mini-episode)\n\n- Series 2 (All 13 episodes should be preceded by their 'Tardisodes': a series of online mini-episodes released in 2006.)\n\n- Torchwood: series 1\n\n- 'The Runaway Bride'\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: 'Invasion of the Bane'\n\n- Series 3, episodes 1-5\n\n- 'The Infinite Quest' (The Character Bios on the DVD release of this animated special state that Martha is travelling with the Doctor for \"one more trip\", which seems to set this before series 3, episode 6, in which her invitation to travel in the TARDIS is made permanent.)\n\n- Series 3, episodes 6-13\n\n- 'Time Crash'\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: series 1\n\n- 'Voyage of the Damned'\n\n- Torchwood: series 2\n\n- Series 4\n\n- 'Music of the Spheres' (Mini-episode from 2007's Doctor Who BBC Proms special)\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: series 2\n\n- 'The Next Doctor'\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: 'From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love' (Comic Relief mini-episode)\n\n- 'Planet of the Dead'\n\n- Torchwood: 'Children of Earth'\n\n- 'Dreamland' (This animated serial was originally released in six parts, from November 21-26, 2009, between transmission of 'The Waters of Mars' and 'The End of Time – Part One'; however, given the Doctor's jovial state of mind, we've decided to place 'Dreamland' before the harrowing events of 'The Waters of Mars'.)\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: series 3\n\n- 'The Waters of Mars'\n\n- 'The End of Time' Parts One and Two\n\n- Series 5 (Two mini-episodes – both billed as 'Meanwhile in the TARDIS...' – feature on series five's DVD and Blu-ray box sets. 'Meanwhile, in the TARDIS... (Part 1)' should be watched between series 5, episode 1 'The Eleventh Hour' and episode 2 'The Beast Below', while 'Meanwhile, in the TARDIS... (Part 2)' should be enjoyed between episode 5 'Flesh and Stone' and episode 6 'The Vampires of Venice'.)\n\n- Night and the Doctor: 'Bad Night' (Mini-episode from series 6 DVD / Blu-ray box set)\n\n- Night and the Doctor: 'Good Night' (Mini-episode from series 6 DVD / Blu-ray box set)\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: series 4\n\n- 'A Christmas Carol'\n\n- 'Space / Time' (Comic Relief mini-episodes)\n\n- Series 6, episodes 1-7 (Prequels to episode 1 'The Impossible Astronaut', episode 3 'The Curse of the Black Spot', and episode 7 'A Good Man Goes to War' were also released online. Another online mini-episode, 'The Battle of Demon's Run – Two Days Later', is to be watched after episode 7 'A Good Man Goes to War'.)\n\n- Torchwood: 'Miracle Day'\n\n- Series 6, episodes 8-13 (Prequels to episode 8 'Let's Kill Hitler' and episode 13 'The Wedding of River Song' were also released online. 'Night and the Doctor: Up All Night' from the series 6 DVD / Blu-ray box set precedes episode 12 'Closing Time'.)\n\n- 'Death Is the Only Answer' (Doctor Who Confidential mini-episode)\n\n- Night and the Doctor: 'First Night' (Mini-episode from series 6 DVD / Blu-ray box set)\n\n- Night and the Doctor: 'Last Night' (Mini-episode from series 6 DVD / Blu-ray box set)\n\n- The Sarah Jane Adventures: series 5\n\n- 'The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe' prequel (mini-episode released online)\n\n- 'The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe'\n\n- 'Good as Gold' (Blue Peter mini-episode)\n\n- 'Pond Life' (five mini-episodes released online)\n\n- Series 7, episode 1 (A prequel to this episode, 'Asylum of the Daleks', was also released online.)\n\n- 'The Inforarium' (It's unclear where this episode – released on series 7's DVD and Blu-ray box sets – falls in the Doctor's chronology, but since it involves his deleting himself from history, as in 'Asylum of the Daleks', we've decided to place it directly after that episode.)\n\n- Series 7, episodes 2-5 ('The Making of The Gunslinger' is a prequel to episode 3 'A Town Called Mercy', which was released online.)\n\n- 'P.S.' (Mini-episode released online)\n\n- 'The Great Detective' (Children in Need mini-episode, prequel to 'The Snowmen')\n\n- 'Vastra Investigates' (Mini-episode released online, prequel to 'The Snowmen')\n\n- 'The Snowmen'\n\n- Series 7, episodes 6-10 (Online mini-episode 'The Bells of Saint John – A Prequel' is to be watched before episode 6.)\n\n- 'Clara and the TARDIS' (Mini-episode from series seven DVD and Blu-ray box set)\n\n- 'Rain Gods' (Mini-episode from series seven DVD and Blu-ray box set)\n\n- Series 7, episode 11\n\n- Doctor Who Proms 2013: 'A Hyperscape Body Swap Ticket'\n\n- Doctor Who: The Ultimate Guide (The Doctor and Clara book-end scenes)\n\n- Series 7, episodes 12-13 ('She Said, He Said' online mini-episode and 'Clarence and the Whispermen' – released on series 7's DVD and Blu-ray box sets – should both be watched before episode 13, 'The Name of the Doctor'.)\n\n- The Night of the Doctor (optional: was originally released, and can be watched, between 'The Name of the Doctor' and 'The Day of the Doctor' – but as the Eighth Doctor's swansong, it should properly be placed before 'Rose' and the 2005 series.)\n\n- 'The Last Day' (Online mini-episode)\n\n- 'The Day of the Doctor'\n\n- 'The Time of the Doctor'\n\n- Series 8\n\n- 'Last Christmas'\n\n- Series 9 (Two mini-episodes, 'The Magician's Apprentice – Prologue' and 'The Doctor's Meditation', were released online and should be watched before episode 1)\n\n- 'The Husbands of River Song'\n\n- Class: series 1\n\n- 'The Return of Doctor Mysterio'\n\n- Series 10 (Mini-episode 'Friend from the Future' was broadcast ahead of series 10 to introduce new companion Bill Potts, played by Pearl Mackie – in terms of chronology, it takes place during episode 1 'The Pilot'.)\n\n- 'Twice Upon a Time'\n\n- Series 11\n\n- 'Resolution' (New Year special)\n\n- Series 12\n\n- 'Revolution of the Daleks' (New Year Special)\n\nDigital Spy has launched its first-ever digital magazine with exclusive features, interviews, and videos.
