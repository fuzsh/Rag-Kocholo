        "text": "You may call them simply doctors. But most doctors have extra expertise in one type of medicine or another. In fact, there are several hundred medical specialties and subspecialties. Here are the most common types of doctors you'll likely see.\n\nAllergists/Immunologists\n\nThey treat immune system disorders such as asthma, eczema, food allergies, insect sting allergies, and some autoimmune diseases.\n\nAnesthesiologists\n\nThese doctors give you drugs to numb your pain or to put you under during surgery, childbirth, or other procedures. They monitor your vital signs while youâre under anesthesia.\n\nCardiologists\n\nTheyâre experts on the heart and blood vessels. You might see them for heart failure, a heart attack, high blood pressure, or an irregular heartbeat.\n\nColon and Rectal Surgeons\n\nYou would see these doctors for problems with your small intestine, colon, and bottom. They can treat colon cancer, hemorrhoids, and inflammatory bowel disease.Â\n\nCritical Care Medicine Specialists\n\nThey care for people who are critically ill or injured, often heading intensive care units in hospitals. You might see them if your heart or other organs are failing or if youâve been in an accident.Â\n\nDermatologists\n\nHave problems with your skin, hair, nails? Do you have moles, scars, acne, or skin allergies? Dermatologists can help.\n\nEndocrinologists\n\nThese are experts on hormones and metabolism. They can treat conditions like diabetes, thyroid problems, infertility, and calcium and bone disorders.\n\nEmergency Medicine Specialists\n\nThese doctors make life-or-death decisions for sick and injured people, usually in an emergency room. Their job is to save lives and to avoid or lower the chances of disability.\n\nFamily Physicians\n\nThey care for the whole family, including children, adults, and the elderly. They do routine checkups and screening tests, give you flu and immunization shots, and manage diabetes and other ongoing medical conditions.\n\nGastroenterologists\n\nTheyâre specialists in digestive organs, including the stomach, bowels, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. You might see them for abdominal pain, ulcers, diarrhea, jaundice, or cancers in your digestive organs.Â They also do a colonoscopy and other tests for colon cancer.\n\nGeriatric Medicine Specialists\n\nThese doctors care for the elderly. They can treat people in their homes, doctors' offices, nursing homes, assisted-living centers, and hospitals.\n\nHematologists\n\nThese are specialists in diseases of the blood, spleen, and lymph glands, like sickle cell disease, anemia, hemophilia, and leukemia.\n\nHospice and Palliative Medicine Specialists\n\nThey work with people who are nearing death. Theyâre experts in pain management. They work with a team of other doctors to keep up your quality of life.\n\nInfectious Disease Specialists\n\nThey diagnose and treat infections in any part of your body, like fevers, Lyme disease, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and HIV and AIDS. Some of them specialize in preventive medicine or travel medicine.\n\nInternists\n\nThese primary-care doctors treat both common and complex illnesses, usually only in adults. Youâll likely visit them or your family doctor first for any condition. Internists often have advanced training in a host of subspecialties, like heart disease, cancer, or adolescent or sleep medicine.Â With additional training (called a fellowship), internists can specialize in cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrinology, nephrology, pulmonology, and other medical sub-specialties.\n\nMedical Geneticists\n\nThey diagnose and treat hereditary disorders passed down from parents to children. These doctors may also offer genetic counseling and screening tests.\n\nNephrologists\n\nThey treat kidney diseases as well as high blood pressure and fluid and mineral imbalances linked to kidney disease.\n\nNeurologists\n\nThese are specialists in the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They treat strokes, brain and spinal tumors, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nObstetricians and Gynecologists\n\nOften called OB/GYNs, these doctors focus on women's health, including pregnancy and childbirth. They do Pap smears, pelvic exams, and pregnancy checkups. OB/GYNs are trained in both areas. But some of them may focus on women's reproductive health (gynecologists), and others specialize in caring for pregnant women (obstetricians).\n\nOncologists\n\nThese internists are cancer specialists. They do chemotherapy treatments and often work with radiation oncologists and surgeons to care for someone with cancer.\n\nOphthalmologists\n\nYou call them eye doctors. They can prescribe glasses or contact lenses and diagnose and treat diseases like glaucoma. Unlike optometrists, theyâre medical doctors who can treat every kind of eye condition as well as operate on the eyes.\n\nOsteopathsÂ\n\nDoctors of osteopathic medicine (DO) are fully licensed medical doctors just like MDs. Their training stresses a âwhole bodyâ approach. Osteopaths use the latest medical technology but also the bodyâs natural ability to heal itself.\n\nOtolaryngologists\n\nThey treat diseases in the ears, nose, throat, sinuses, head, neck, and respiratory system. They also can do reconstructive and plastic surgery on your head and neck.\n\nPathologists\n\nThese lab doctors identify the causes of diseases by examining body tissues and fluids under microscopes.\n\nPediatricians\n\nThey care for children from birth to young adulthood. Some pediatricians specialize in pre-teens and teens, child abuse, or children's developmental issues.\n\nPhysiatrists\n\nThese specialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation treat neck or back pain and sports or spinal cord injuries as well as other disabilities caused by accidents or diseases.\n\nPlastic Surgeons\n\nYou might call them cosmetic surgeons. They rebuild or repair your skin, face, hands, breasts, or body. That can happen after an injury or disease or for cosmetic reasons.\n\nPodiatrists\n\nThey care for problems in your ankles and feet. That can include injuries from accidents or sports or from ongoing health conditions like diabetes. Some podiatrists have advanced training in other subspecialties of the foot.\n\nPreventive Medicine Specialists\n\nThey focus on keeping you well. They may work in public health or at hospitals. Some focus on treating people with addictions, illnesses from exposure to drugs, chemicals, and poisons, and other areas.\n\nPsychiatrists\n\nThese doctors work with people with mental, emotional, or addictive disorders. They can diagnose and treat depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and sexual and gender identity issues. Some psychiatrists focus on children, adolescents, or the elderly.\n\nPulmonologists\n\nYou would see these specialists for problems like lung cancer, pneumonia, asthma, emphysema, and trouble sleeping caused by breathing issues.\n\nRadiologists\n\nThey use X-rays, ultrasound, and other imaging tests to diagnose diseases. They can also specialize in radiation oncology to treat conditions like cancer.\n\nRheumatologists\n\nThey specialize in arthritis and other diseases in your joints, muscles, bones, and tendons. You might see them for your osteoporosis (weak bones), back pain, gout, tendinitis from sports or repetitive injuries, and fibromyalgia."
