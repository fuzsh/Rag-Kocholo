        "text": "A primary care physician (PCP), or primary care provider, is a health care professional who practices general medicine. PCPs are our first stop for medical care. Most PCPs are doctors, but nurse practitioners and physician assistants can sometimes also be PCPs.\n\nA PCP is the person your child should see for a routine checkup or non-emergency medical care. If your child has a mild fever, cough, or rash, or is short of breath or nauseated, a PCP usually can find the cause and decide what to do about it.\n\nUsually, PCPs can treat conditions in their own offices. If they can't, they can refer you and your child to a trusted specialist. If your child needs ongoing treatment or is admitted to a hospital, the PCP may oversee the care, help you make decisions related to treatment, or refer you to other specialists if needed.\n\nOne of a PCP's most important jobs is to help keep kids from getting sick in the first place. This is called preventive care.\n\nThe best preventive care means:\n\nforming a relationship with a PCP you like and trust\n\ntaking your child for scheduled checkups and vaccines\n\nfollowing the PCP's advice for establishing a healthy lifestyle, managing weight, and getting the right amount of exercise\n\nWhat Are the Types of PCPs?\n\nDifferent types of PCPs treat kids and teens. Which is right for you depends on your family's needs:\n\nFamily doctors, or family physicians, care for patients of all ages, from infants, kids and teens, to adults and the elderly.\n\nPediatricians care for babies, kids, and teens.\n\nInternists, or internal medicine doctors, care for adults, but some see patients who are in their late teens.\n\nAdolescent medicine specialists are pediatricians or internists who have extra training in caring for teens.\n\nCombined internal medicine and pediatric specialists have training in both pediatrics and internal medicine.\n\nObstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs) specialize in women's health issues and are sometimes PCPs for girls who have started menstruating.\n\nNurse practitioners or physician assistants sometimes are the main providers a child or teen sees at a doctor's office.\n\nWhen to Go to the PCP\n\nCall your PCP first about any health-related questions or concerns that aren’t an emergency. These can include:\n\na high fever\n\near pain\n\nbelly pain\n\na headache that doesn't go away\n\na rash\n\nmild wheezing\n\na lasting cough\n\nWhen in doubt, call the PCP. Even if the PCP isn't available, someone else in the office can talk with you and decide whether your child should go to the ER. On weekends and at night, PCPs often have answering services that let them get in touch with you if you leave a message.\n\nWhen to Go to an Emergency Room\n\nGo to the ER if your child:\n\nhas trouble breathing or is short of breath\n\nhas a change in mental status, such as suddenly becoming unusually sleepy or hard to wake, lethargic, disoriented, or confused\n\nhas a cut in the skin that won’t stop bleeding\n\nhas a stiff neck along with a fever\n\nhas a rapid heartbeat that doesn't slow down\n\ningests a poisonous substance or too much medicine\n\nhas had more than minor head trauma\n\nHow Can I Find a PCP?\n\nTo find a PCP, start by asking yourself what matters to you. For example, you'll want the PCP's office to take your health insurance and, ideally, be close to home. Also consider include how helpful and friendly the staff is, how easy it is to get in touch with the PCP, and whether the office hours work with your schedule.\n\nAsk for recommendations from friends, neighbors, relatives, and doctors or nurses you already know and trust.\n\nWhen you have a list of candidates, learn what you can about the PCP. For instance, does the PCP:\n\ncome across as open and friendly or more formal?\n\nprefer to treat conditions aggressively or take a \"wait and see\" approach?\n\ntry to handle things in the office or refer most patients to specialists?\n\nFind out about any extra services. Some offices also have specialists, mental health providers, dietitians, lactation consultants, and social workers on-site. It’s convenient to have all these services under one roof.\n\nYour health insurance plan may have a directory of preferred PCPs, and many practices will let you meet with a provider to see if they’re a good fit. And while it's easier to stay with one care provider, if you feel your child isn't getting the right level of care, you can choose another PCP."
