        "text": "There is a lot to learn about cancer and your treatment. There are many things to remember. And if you’re scared or confused, it can be even harder to take it all in. But, there are things you can do to make it easier to learn.\n\nExpress yourself clearly. Describe your problem or concern briefly. State the most important points first.\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse to write down the name and stage of your cancer. There are many different types of cancer. \"Stage\" refers to the size of the cancer tumor and how far it has spread in your body. Knowing the name and stage of your cancer will help you find out more about your cancer and help your doctor decide which treatment choices you have.\n\nLearn about your treatment choices. Ask your doctor to tell you about your treatment options. Ask how each treatment can help and which side effects you might have. Try to learn all you can about each choice. Let your doctor know if you need more time to think about these issues before you choose one. (For tips, see Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Your Treatment.)\n\nAsk as many questions as you need to. Your doctor needs to know your questions and concerns. Write down your questions and bring them with you to your visit. Ask your most important questions first, in case the doctor runs out of time. If you have a lot of questions, you may want to plan extra time to talk. You should also make sure to get a name and number of someone on staff to call in case you have follow-up questions.\n\nLet your doctor know your concerns about costs. Your health care team wants to know if you're worried about finances for your cancer treatment so they can help you find ways to manage them. For more details on this topic, see Managing Costs and Medical Information.\n\nDon't worry if your questions seem silly or don't make sense. All your questions are important and deserve an answer. It's okay to ask the same question more than once. It's also okay to ask your doctor to use simpler words and explain terms that are new to you. To make sure you understand, use your own words to repeat back what you heard the doctor say.\n\nTake someone with you when you go to the doctor. Ask a family member or friend to go with you when you see your doctor. This person can help by listening, taking notes, and asking questions. If you can't find someone to go with you, ask your doctor if he or she will talk with a friend or family member over the phone.\n\nLet your doctor know how you like to receive news. Tell your doctor how you like to hear updates and information about your cancer. For example, do you want it all at once or gradually as you go through treatment? Do you want all the details or just the main facts? It's also very important to let your health care team know which family members or friends they can share information with and when.\n\nTalk with the doctor about any medical advice you have heard or found on your own. Some advice may be wrong or misleading, or may not apply to you.\n\nTake notes or ask to record your conversation. Many patients have trouble remembering what they talk about with their doctor. Take notes or ask if you can record the conversation. You can also ask if the hospital or health system allows you to see your electronic clinic notes (see article on this page)."
