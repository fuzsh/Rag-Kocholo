        "text": "Hematologists are internal medicine doctors or pediatricians who have extra training in disorders related to your blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic system. Theyâre specialists who may work in hospitals, blood banks, or clinics. Hematologists who practice in labs are called hematopathologists. Theyâre trained in pathology, a branch of medicine that examines body tissues and blood with microscopes or tests.\n\nAll hematologists have at least 9 years of medical education. It includes 3 years of on-the-job training called residency after medical school and up to 4 years of subspecialty training. Some hematologists are generalists, while others focus on specific conditions and organs that require extra training.\n\nTests and Procedures\n\nNo surprise: Hematologists spend a lot of time checking your blood. But they donât just diagnose illnesses. They also do treatments, such as transfusing blood.\n\nComplete blood count. This common test helps your doctor diagnose or monitor your disease. Blood drawn from your vein or finger is checked for the levels and characteristics of all three types of blood cells, including platelets.\n\nProthrombin time. This and a similar test called partial thromboplastin time look for bleeding or clotting disorders. They also check how well your medications and treatments are working.\n\nBlood transfusion. It replaces blood youâve lost in surgery, an accident, or an illness\n\nChemotherapy. This is given by a specialist called a hematologist-oncologist. It infuses your body with chemicals to kill fast-growing cancer cells.\n\nBone marrow transplant. Also called a stem cell transplant, it replaces diseased stem cells from the spongy center of your bone with healthy cells from other parts of your body or from a donor.\n\nAblation therapy. Your hematologist uses heat, cold, a laser, or chemicals to destroy damaged tissue.\n\nWhat to Expect During Your Visit\n\nYou may not always come face to face with your hematologist. They often work closely with your internist, pediatrician, oncologist, or other primary doctor to interpret your test results or to monitor your condition. A lab technician who takes your blood sample usually isnât a doctor. Blood draws take only minutes. You may wait a few days to get your test results.\n\nIf you have a long-term blood-related condition, such as hemophilia, you probably will see them regularly."
