        "text": "NB. All these stories except one (The Massacre) are available to watch on iPlayer. In some cases, episodes are missing\n\n60. Village Of The Angels (2021)\n\nStarring: Jodie Whittaker, Mandip Gill, John Bishop, Kevin McNally, Annabel Scholey\n\nThe Flux storyline which spanned Jodie Whittaker’s penultimate series was uneven and often confusing. However, the standout was this thrillingly old-fashioned instalment, which saw the 13th Doctor facing off against recurring foes the Weeping Angels. After finding a rogue killer statue in the Tardis, the Doctor and her companions became stranded in a Devon village in 1967, where Professor Eustacius Jericho was conducting psychic experiments and there was one gravestone too many in the local cemetery. Angels surrounded the “cursed” village, creating a textbook siege with several killer twists. As the Doctor herself was turned into a Weeping Angel, it made for a highly effective cliffhanger.\n\n59. The Doctor’s Wife (2011)\n\nStarring Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill, Suranne Jones, Michael Sheen\n\nThe TARDIS was revealed to be capable of communication, albeit very cryptically, in the early story The Edge of Destruction (1964). But in his first script for the series, fantasy writer Neil Gaiman gives her – and the TARDIS is most definitely a her – a voice. With the Type 40 machine’s essence transferred into the body of a dotty-seeming Victorian woman named Idris (Suranne Jones), the TARDIS and the Doctor finally get to exchange witty repartee and home truths like an old married couple. The dialogue crackles, and in an interesting addition to the mythos we learn that ‘Sexy’ chose the Doctor as a means of leaving Gallifrey just as much as he chose her.\n\n“You didn’t always take me where I wanted to go,” the Doctor complains at one point. “No,” comes the reply, “but I always took you where you needed to go.”\n\n58. Carnival of Monsters (1973)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning, Andrew Staines, Jenny McCraken, Michael Wisher\n\nA satire on reality television, even before there was such a thing, Carnival of Monsters is also a postmodern take on Doctor Who itself. The Doctor and Jo find themselves trapped in the Miniscope, a device which puts the inhabitants of various worlds on display for the amusement of the horrendously stratified society of Inter Minor, who are also able to manipulate them. Alongside roaring, carnivorous monsters the Drashigs (“They’re great favourites with the children!”) we get a view of xenophobia and how it can lead to wrong-headed prejudices.\n\n57. Rose (2005)\n\nStarring Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper, Camille Coduri, Noel Clarke\n\nThis episode had to be just right. With Doctor Who returning for its first full series in 16 years, and back in its rightful place as a centrepiece of Saturday evening television, it was critical that Russell T Davies did not just provide a fix of nostalgia to those with fond memories of the original series but show that the programme could hold its own in the 21st century. Thankfully, Davies delivered.\n\nWhile giving generous nods to the original series, and plundering Spearhead from Space for the Autons’ attack via killer shop window dummies, Rose confidently strode forward on its own terms. It had emotional truth, convincing special effects, clever use of British landmarks (the London Eye as alien transmitter) and was like nothing else on television. Most importantly, the core of the story was the Doctor and his companion, the titular Rose; Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper more than delivered.\n\n56. Day of the Daleks (1972)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin, Katy Manning, John Levene\n\nThe series’ greatest villains make their colour debut, and battle UNIT for the only time in the classic series. Time travel paradoxes are surprisingly rare in Doctor Who, but here assassins from a Dalek-controlled future Earth who believe they are stopping the perpetrator of World War III are the ones who actually set it off. The Daleks’ apelike henchmen, the Ogrons, are well-designed and Jon Pertwee’s Doctor runs the full gamut from one-man wine and cheese society to man of action, to stern authority in his scenes in the 22nd century.\n\n55. The End of Time (2009/10)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Billie Piper, Catherine Tate, Bernard Cribbins, John Simm\n\nDavid Tennant had proved to be such a great Doctor that he needed to bow out in style, and Russell T Davies, in his swansong as showrunner, provided a suitably epic story for him to do so. The seeds had been sown at the end of Last of the Time Lords for a return of the Master, and back he comes, in an initially more feral form due to his sabotaged resurrection. He soon finds his diabolical mojo, pulling Gallifrey back from the Time War and threatening to knock Earth out of its orbit.\n\nThe stakes are raised even higher by the sudden and surprising return of the Time Lords and their founder Rassilon (Timothy Dalton), and the fascinating revelation that the Master was a pawn in his plan to enable the aversion of Gallifrey’s destruction. Davies’s take on their founder lives up to the darker legends ascribed to him in The Five Doctors, but he just about manages to avoid the story disappearing up its own mythological backside in the process. When Tennant said “I don’t want to go” and did just that in apocalyptic fashion, there wasn’t a dry eye in the land.\n\n54. Fury from the Deep (1968)\n\nStarring Patrick Troughton, Frazer Hines, Deborah Watling, Victor Maddern\n\nAn object lesson in how a foam machine and amplified heartbeat can form the basis of a genuinely scary story. Of course there’s much more to that with Fury from the Deep as Victor Pemberton transfers his pet story of something nasty emerging from the sea to Doctor Who, and melds it with the then new field of North Sea Gas. Like so many of the stories from this era it is essentially a “base under siege” thriller but succeeds thanks to the sheer style with which it delivers the threat.\n\n53. It Takes You Away (2018)\n\nStarring Jodie Whittaker, Bradley Walsh, Mandeep Gill, Tosin Cole\n\nIn the finest Jodie Whittaker episode so far, the Tardis lands in 21st century Norway on the edge of a picturesque fjord. As the team entered a boarded up cottage, we were treated to the whole gamut of horror tropes: dark corners, creaking floorboards, slowly turning doorknobs, dead birds strung up on the ceiling. Hiding upstairs in a wardrobe was a terrified blind girl named Hanne (actress and singer/songwriter Eleanor “Ellie” Wallwork, who has herself been blind since birth) in need of help. “The Thing” had taken her widowed father and he’d been gone for four days.\n\nWhat started as a Scandi horror film became something more nuanced – a moving study of guilt and grief, all wrapped up in a supernatural sci-fi package. There were enough twists, turns and ideas packed into 50 minutes to scare children and make grown-up heads spin. It certainly did take us away.\n\n52. The War Games (1969)\n\nStarring Patrick Troughton, Frazer Hines, Wendy Padbury, David Savile, Jane Sherwin\n\nGiven that this was cobbled together by Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke after several putative stories for that season collapsed, The War Games is a surprisingly well-structured affair which doesn’t lag over its mammoth 10 parts. What starts as a historical story set in World War One soon becomes something very strange as a 1917 ambulance is attacked by a group of Roman soldiers. It is then revealed that the War Lord and his minions are building a universe-conquering army from survivors of various wars through history.\n\nMore importantly, this is the story that finally names the alien species the Doctor comes from, and astonishingly the mention of the Time Lords does not come in some great revelation, but as a throwaway line from a War Lord scientist! The War Games is the end of an era. It’s the last Troughton story, the last story in black and white and the last story of the Sixties. Perhaps because of this, a genuine sadness surrounds it, and the Doctor saying goodbye to his assistants Jamie and Zoe is very touching, particularly as they have their memories of him removed by the Time Lords.\n\n51. Cold War (2011)\n\nStarring Matt Smith, Jenna-Louise Coleman, Liam Cunningham, David Warner, Tobias Menzies\n\nCold War is in some ways a throwback to the Patrick Troughton era of Doctor Who, a claustrophobic base-under-siege scenario featuring the Ice Warriors (their first appearance on the show since 1974). Here, it is the Ice Warrior Skaldak who turns up on a Soviet submarine in 1983, hell-bent on destroying humanity. Dark lighting adds a sense of claustrophobia to the setting and some great dialogue (words rather than action save the day) make for a stylish and well-crafted story.\n\n50. Fugitive of the Judoon (2020)\n\nStarring: Jodie Whittaker, Bradley Walsh, Tosin Cole, Mandip Gill, Jo Martin, Neil Stuke, John Barrowman\n\nThe Jodie Whittaker era was largely a disappointment but this was a high-water mark. A twist-packed romp not only saw the surprise return of former companion Captain Jack Harkness after a decade away but revealed that Gloucester cathedral tour guide Ruth Clayton was in fact a forgotten incarnation of the Doctor. Rhino-headed intergalactic cops the Judoon landed in modern-day Gloucester to arrest a runaway human. It turned out to be the Fugitive Doctor, who’d hidden her Tardis and true self in a lighthouse to stay safe. Meanwhile, something was coming for the 13th Doctor...\n\n49. A Good Man Goes To War (2011)\n\nStarring Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill, Alex Kingston, Frances Barber\n\nThis episode from Matt Smith’s second series presents the Doctor as a mythical being whose impact is felt throughout the universe. Fittingly, then, he isn’t glimpsed until halfway through. Given the pyrotechnics of David Tennant-era Doctor Who finales, this is a surprisingly talkative affair with a series of conversations between the protagonists providing a lot of exposition. Fortunately the quality of Steven Moffat’s writing means that this never became dull and at times proves genuinely gripping, particularly as the Doctor has to confront the anguishing fact that he is a warrior. Matt Smith’s performance has never been as controlled and authoritative as it is here.\n\n48. The Horror of Fang Rock (1977)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Louise Jameson, John Abbott, Colin Douglas, Ralph Watson\n\nWhen Graham Williams was appointed producer of the show in 1977, he had a brief to tone down the horror in the series. However Williams’s debut story in the role shows little evidence of this approach, as the programme’s 15th season opened with this grim tale in which only the Doctor and Leela survive the arrival of the jellyfish-like Rutan at a lighthouse in Edwardian times. It might have been a result of budgetary constraints that a number of stories over the years have been set in closed or claustrophobic environments, but often these settings have led to effective and memorable stories. This story, filmed (unusually) at the BBC’s Pebble Mill in Birmingham, is no exception.\n\nColin Douglas and Ralph Watson give nicely nuanced performances as the old lighthouse keeper suspicious of the move to electricity and the green young apprentice. Louise Jameson has, by this time, got Leela to a tee, and her character possesses an almost feral authority here.\n\n47. Listen (Sept 2014)\n\nStarring Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman, Samuel Anderson, Remi Gooding\n\nMonsters under the bed, anyone? Another early Capaldi era hit, written by showrunner Steven Moffat and directed by Mackinnon, this creepily unsettling episode flitted between the paranoid Doctor trying to track down a creature which had perfected the ability to hide, and Clara on an amusingly awkward date with boyfriend Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson).\n\nThe two strands came together in the theory that everyone in the universe has a nightmare where a hand grabs their ankle from beneath the bed - with Clara herself being unveiled as the monster under the young Doctor’s, in a familiar barn back on Gallifrey. A powerful psychological horror story with the moral that pushing through fear makes us stronger: “Scared is a superpower!”\n\n46. The Ark in Space (1975)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen and Ian Marter\n\nThe debut offering from both script editor Robert Holmes and producer Philip Hinchcliffe, this episode signalled a new direction for the series: Gothic horror-inspired, with a more sombre tone, and action scaled back in favour of atmosphere.\n\nAs a group of humans who had been cryogenically-preserved to escape Earth’s devastation, wake to find their space ark infested by an insect-like Wirrn, it is down to their leader, Noah – who is infected by and turned into a Wirrn – to sacrifice himself and destroy the enemy.\n\nDesigner John Friedlander’s creation of the full-sized adult Wirrn rises to the challenge of Holmes’ first script, as do the cast. Tom Baker is up and running as the Doctor here – his speech extolling the achievements of mankind is one of the great monologues of the series. The episode pulled in a startling 13.4 million viewers, giving the series the highest chart placing it would achieve for the next three decades.\n\n45. Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks (2007)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Freema Agyeman, Hugh Quarshie, Miranda Raison\n\nRenegade Daleks The Cult of Skaro resurface in 1930s Manhattan, having escaped the Battle of Canary Wharf, and plans to fuse Daleks and humans to create a hybrid race. The scheme inspires a mutiny among the Daleks, who use a gamma ray burst to overwrite human DNA with their own. The Doctor attempts to foil the transmission but, by being in contact with the Empire State Building’s mast when the strike hits, accidentally transmits some of his DNA into the mix. In a final confrontation the dalekised humans and most of the Cult of Skaro perish, with only Dalek Caan escaping.\n\nThe first story to be written by a woman (script editor Helen Raynor) since the series returned in 2005, it raises an interesting question about the Daleks. For creatures obsessed with genetic purity they have a curious obsession with humankind.\n\nMiranda Raison and Hugh Quarshie both put in good supporting performances, the latter bringing a dignity to his scenes as Solomon. With a well-realised sense of place and time, good performances all round and an interesting development of the series’ greatest monsters to boot, Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks makes for a highly enjoyable watch.\n\n44. Vincent and the Doctor (2010)\n\nStarring Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Tony Curran, Bill Nighy\n\nEvery so often, a Doctor Who story comes along that is like no other. This episode (the only one to date to be written by Richard Curtis) barely seems like part of the canon, so keen is its emphasis on human emotion (odd for a sci-fi show) and the restorative power of art. When he becomes intrigued by a figure in a Van Gogh painting, the Doctor takes Amy back in time to visit the tortured artist who is being plagued by an alien called a Krafayis. The story deals sensitively with mental illness and is framed by a psychological clarity that the series has rarely bettered. Tony Curran gives a wonderful performance as Van Gogh, both enigmatic and full-blooded, and the scene when the Doctor takes Van Gogh to the future to show how his work will be remembered as heartbreaking (Amy learns that the painter committed suicide weeks after their encounter).\n\n43. Planet of Evil (1975)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Frederick Jaeger, Ewen Solon\n\nUnder the aegis of producer Philip Hinchliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, Doctor Who in the mid Seventies was characterised by a love of the Gothic and a need to look for the potential horror of science fiction. Planet of Evil was the first example of this. The Doctor and Sarah arrive on Zeta Minor, a planet at the edge of the universe, where all the members of an expedition from the planet Morestra have been killed save the leader Professor Sorenson, who has been experimenting on anti-matter obtained from the planet. A Morestran military expedition also arrives; the Doctor has to prove his innocence and prevent an anti-matter monster from under the planet from killing the Morestrans.\n\n42. The Tenth Planet (1966)\n\nStarring William Hartnell, Anneke Wills, Michael Craz, Robert Beatty\n\nThis story is significant for two reasons. Firstly, the Cybermen, the second most popular monsters in the series’ history, make their debut. Secondly, this is William Hartnell’s final story and paved the way for the show’s future as Hartnell regenerated (although that term was not then used) into Patrick Troughton and ensured Doctor Who’s longevity. Hartnell fell ill during the recording of The Tenth Planet and so his appearances are restricted. However, when he is on screen, you can see him at his authoritative best.\n\n41. The Power of the Daleks (1966)\n\nStarring Patrick Troughton, Anneke Wills, Michael Craze, Bernard Archard\n\nWiped from the BBC archives, The Power of the Daleks is the holy grail for Doctor Who fans. A tightly written Dalek story which also marks Patrick Troughton’s debut in the title role. The newly regenerated Doctor arrives with Ben and Polly on the planet Vulcan, and discovers that a scientist, Lesterson, has found a crashed Dalek ship and has brought one back to life. The Dalek pretends to be a servant of the colony so that it can restore power to the ship and create a Dalek army and conquer the planet.\n\n40. The Unquiet Dead (2005)\n\nStarring Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper, Simon Callow\n\nThe Doctor takes Rose on her first trip into history, but instead of Naples in 1860 they end up in Cardiff in 1869. Corpses are coming to life, and it emerges that they are being animated by the Gelth, creatures rendered gaseous by the effects of the Time War who have travelled through a rift and see Earth and humanity as an ideal location for colonisation and reclaiming some sort of form. Charles Dickens is also in Cardiff giving a reading, and he assists the Doctor and Rose in defeating the Gelth’s plan. This was Mark Gatiss’s first script for the series and it’s a clever, tightly constructed affair. The fact that Simon Callow played Dickens and is an expert on the 19th-century-author gives the episode a real authority.\n\n39. The Curse of Peladon (1972)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning, David Troughton, Geoffrey Toone\n\nScience fiction has often been used as a way of commenting on the present in an allegorical fashion, and here Doctor Who takes the then-topical issue of the UK’s entry into the European Economic Community and gives it its own spin. The Doctor and Jo find themselves on the planet Peladon, just as it is preparing for entry to the Galactic Federation. Not everyone on Peladon is keen on this, and High Priest Hepesh, in league with Federation delegate Arcturus as it turns out, arranges the murder of the Chancellor and attempts to assassinate another of the delegates to ensure it does not join. As old foes the Ice Warriors are among the Federation delegates, the Doctor suspects them of wrongdoing…\n\n38. The Day of the Doctor (2013)\n\nStarring Matt Smith, David Tennant, John Hurt, Jenna Coleman, Billie Piper, Jemma Redgrave, Ingrid Oliver, Joanna Page, Tom Baker, Nicholas Briggs\n\nThe 50th anniversary of Doctor Who was met with huge fanfare and the pressure was on Steven Moffat to produce a feature-length special worthy of such a big event. On that, he did not disappoint. Bringing together three generations of the Doctor, we got to see Matt Smith and David Tennant act alongside each other, as well as the hitherto unseen War Doctor, played by John Hurt. Set on the last day of the Time War, we learned the War Doctor’s dark secret as he prepared to destroy Gallifrey to stop the invasion of the Daleks. But, with the help of Tennant and Smith’s Doctors (and all the other Doctors), he managed to rewrite his timeline and instead hide Gallifrey somewhere else in time and space.\n\nIt managed to be both an incredibly touching and staggeringly tense episode that stuffed in as many nerd-references as you could wish for, as well as the return of Billie Piper and – in an unexpected twist – Tom Baker in the show’s final moments.\n\n37. The Invasion (1968)\n\nStarring Patrick Troughton, Frazer Hines, Wendy Padbury, Nicholas Courtney, Kevin Stoney\n\nAfter avoiding attack on the dark side of the Moon the TARDIS lands on Earth. Deciding to look up old friend Professor Travers the Doctor discovers he is missing. The Doctor’s search takes him to International Electromatics and its manager Tobias Vaughn. Vaughn is working with the Cybermen who are planning an invasion of Earth, which comes to pass. Vaughn discovers he has been double-crossed…\n\nWith plans afoot to bring the Doctor to Earth in the Seventies, The Invasion is the precursor of this, introducing UNIT (United Nations Intelligence Taskforce) which would prove a mainstay of the series up to 1976. The Cybermen’s costume undergoes a third redesign, and Bobi Bartlett comes up with the definitive look for the creatures.\n\nAt eight episodes this is one of the longest stories Doctor Who ever attempted, and remarkably the extra length works in the story’s favour. There is a feeling of real time waiting for the titular invasion to start, and the sense of mystery and anticipation is gradually ramped up.\n\n36. Frontier in Space (1973)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning, Roger Delgado\n\nThe TARDIS lands on a space cargo freighter in 2540 when tension between Earth and Draconia, the two major powers in the Milky Way, is threatening to spill into war. Each side is being blamed for attacks on the other’s vessels, but in reality they are being staged by the Ogrons using a hypnotism device to make them look like humans or Draconians. Victims of such a raid in which the TARDIS is stolen, the Doctor and Jo are forced to return to Earth where they are accused of being spies and imprisoned. The Ogrons are, in fact, working for the Master who is attempting to start a war between Earth and Draconia on behalf of his employers, the Daleks. This was the last time Roger Delgado appeared as the Master before his tragic death in a car crash in Turkey, and an emergency reshoot of the end of the last episode meant that his swansong was rather confused ending.\n\n35. Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways (2005)\n\nStarring Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper, John Barrowman\n\nThe Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack find themselves taken from the TARDIS and placed on the Gamestation in futuristic versions of 21st century television programmes. The Doctor, accompanied by fellow player Lynda, escapes from a version of Big Brother and Captain Jack from What Not to Wear, but they arrive too late to save Rose being apparently disintegrated for having lost The Weakest Link. It emerges that the Gamestation is the successor of Satellite Five which the Doctor freed a hundred years previously, and is being manipulated by the Daleks. The Doctor discovers the Emperor Dalek survived the Time War, is using humanity to rebuild the Daleks, with himself as their God and is launching an attack on Earth. Eccleston’s swansong is also his finest hour and his stirring speech at the cliffhanger of Bad Wolf where he informs the Daleks that he will be coming to rescue Rose and then proceed to wipe out the whole stinking lot of them shows his true power as a performer.\n\n34. The Curse of Fenric (1989)\n\nStarring Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred\n\nThe Doctor takes Ace to an army camp in 1943, home to a booby-trapped Ultima decryption machine that a party of Soviet troops intend for their country. Meanwhile, mysterious runes have been discovered in the local church, and it transpires that all this has been orchestrated by Fenric, an entity defeated hundreds of years ago by the Doctor. It emerges Ace’s hated mother is a baby at the camp, her grandmother working there, and the Doctor is aware that she is a pawn in Fenric’s game. Fenric then brings back from a polluted future the Ancient One, Earth’s last survivor, and awakens the vampire-like Haemovores to attack the camp and church.\n\nThe focus on a companion’s backstory – the first time the series had done this - is just one aspect of a story that manages to be complex and dark, despite the stunt casting of Nicholas Parsons as Reverend Wainwright. Although the evil from the dawn of time aspect is a bit hackneyed, it does help give added impetus to the increasing portrayal of the Doctor as an almost Machiavellian arch-manipulator.\n\n33. The Magician’s Apprentice (Sept 2015)\n\nStarring Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman, Julian Bleach, Jemma Redgrave\n\nDear old prune-faced Davros (Julian Bleach) is one of the show’s most iconic villains and his surprising back-story made a gripping subject for the Dalek-stuffed opening episode of Capaldi’s second full series. The Doctor is faced with the classic moral conundrum: if you met a child who would grow up to be an evil dictator, would you kill him?\n\nDirected by Hettie MacDonald and written by that man Moffat, the thrillingly packed two-parter - “more like a season finale than an opener”, as Moffat said - also featured UNIT, Missy and Clara teaming up, the striking concept of “handmines”, all the planes on Earth freezing in mid-flight, and the Doctor arriving at a 12th century duel by playing an electric guitar on top of a tank. As you do.\n\n32. The Daleks (1963/4)\n\nStarring William Hartnell, William Russell, Jacqueline Hill, Carole Ann Ford\n\nThe TARDIS lands in a petrified forest and the Doctor and his companions explore it, discovering a city at the far end occupied by the Daleks, survivors of a nuclear war on the planet Skaro. The Daleks’ enemies, the Thals, have embraced pacifism; the Doctor and his companions persuade them that they need to fight for their survival and attack the city. A battle ensues.\n\nDaleks creator Terry Nation had originally turned down the commission but recanted after being sacked by Tony Hancock. Aided by Raymond Cusick’s unique design - for which he was given an ex gratia payment of £100 - and with ring modulated voices created at the BBC’s Radiophonic Workshop, he gave the series a fully-formed master race from the off, and an instant hit. Without them, it is highly likely we would not be celebrating 50 years of Doctor Who.\n\n31. Ghost Light (1989)\n\nStarring Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, Frank Windsor\n\nIn what is probably the most dense and complex story the programme had attempted until Steven Moffat took over, the Doctor takes Ace to Gabriel Chase, a house that a century later she would burn down in her teens. Ostensibly the home of Josiah Samuel Smith, he is actually the evolved form of an alien hidden in the basement, who is manipulating explorer Redvers Fenn-Cooper in a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria. Smith came to Earth in a spaceship in the basement, along with Control, a female whose life cycle is in balance with his own and Light, an alien whose had come to Earth to catalogue the planet’s species. Ace inadvertently releases Light, who discovers his catalogue has been made obsolete by evolution, which maddens him to the extent he decides to destroy all life on the planet. The Doctor convinces Light that he too is evolving which drives him to suicide; Fenn-Cooper and an evolved Control leave with a regressed Smith and Nimrod the Neanderthal butler in the spaceship.\n\nIn the Nineties, a witty cartoon appeared showing two fans hoping episode 4 would explain everything (this was a three-parter). It had a point. This story needs repeat viewings to make sense, yet it’s an experiment that pays off.\n\n30. The Power Of The Doctor (2022)\n\nStarring: Jodie Whittaker, Mandip Gill, John Bishop, Jemma Redgrave, Sacha Dhawan, Sophie Aldred, Janet Fielding, David Bradley, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann\n\nWhittaker’s swansong episode was arguably her very best. Aired to mark the BBC’s centenary, a feature-length saga saw her take on the unholy trinity of the Master, Cybermen and Daleks - with help from former companions and previous Doctors. A giddy ride took in Rasputin, a volcano machine, a bullet train in space, a forced regeneration and mental manifestations of her former selves. These surprise comebacks had somehow been kept secret and delighted fans. Whittaker was never more moving than during her quietly beautiful farewells, before she embraced her fate and sprung one last surprise with her regeneration. Meanwhile, Yaz attended a support group of former companions. An emotional epic which celebrated not only the 13th Doctor’s Tardis tenure but the show’s glorious past, leaving things beautifully poised for Russell T Davies’ return to mastermind the 60th anniversary.\n\n29. Remembrance of the Daleks (1988)\n\nStarring Sylvester McCoy, Sophie Aldred, Simon Williams, Pamela Salem, Karen Gledhill\n\nThe Doctor and Ace arrive in Shoreditch in 1963, where a Dalek faction has arrived on Earth to find the Hand of Omega, a stellar manipulator secreted in the area by the First Doctor. The Daleks are in the area, firstly a group of “renegade” Daleks, and then the Imperial Daleks, governed by a disguised Davros, both of which are attempting to claim the Hand for themselves.\n\nDoctor Who is often accused, not without reason, of disappearing up its own backside too often for its own good in the Eighties, with stories laden with what were thought to be fan-pleasing continuity references; Remembrance of the Daleks is positively heaving with them. For starters we go back to the very first episode with scenes shot in 76 Totters Lane and Coal Hill School, and since it’s set in November 1963 we even get Ace seeing a television announcing the launch of a new BBC series! This isn’t a story for the casual viewer. However, writer Ben Aaronovitch’s series debut is definitely a crowd pleaser for the fans, with its new-style Dalek (the decidedly lethal Special Weapons Dalek) and the Doctor as manipulator luring the Daleks to Earth for his own purposes. And Andrew Morgan helms the story with quite a bit of flair – for an unloved show with an inadequate budget it does not show in the slightest here.\n\n28. The Green Death (1973)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning Nicholas Courtney with Richard Franklin, John Levene\n\nUNIT are called in to investigate a miner found bright green in the Welsh village of Llanfairfach, where Jo is using leave to visit the Wholeweal community due to her regard for its founder Professor Clifford Jones. The Global Chemicals plant in the village is found to be pumping toxic waste into the disused mine, causing the death of the miner and mutating maggots to a giant size. Captain Yates is sent to infiltrate Global Chemicals, but is captured and hypnotised by its computer system, BOSS (Biomorphic Organisational Systems Supervisor) which is planning to stage a world takeover by linking itself to all other major computer systems.\n\nIf Doctor Who stories had Friends-style episode titles then this would be “the one with the maggots”. They’re one of the more memorable Earth-based threats created during the Pertwee era and well-brought to life by the visual effects men (even if their giant fly isn’t anywhere near as good).\n\nThis eco-minded story is probably the programme at its most preachy, but to its credit, there’s enough action and adventure to make sure the drama isn’t drowned out. And to round it all off we get one of the classic companion departures – as Jo flies the coop the Doctor keenly feels her loss. The scenes of him departing quietly alone in Bessie into the sunset whilst everyone else parties, to Jo’s obvious sadness, still bring a lump to the throat.\n\n27. The Brain of Morbius (1976)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Philip Madoc\n\nThe TARDIS arrives on the planet of Karn which arouses the suspicions of the Sisterhood of Karn, who suspect the Doctor is there to steal the Elixir of Life. Also on Karn is Dr Mehendri Solon, who has preserved the brain of executed Time Lord criminal Morbius and is building a body from scavenged parts to put it in, and is particularly keen on utilising the Doctor’s head.\n\nThe Philip Hinchcliffe/Robert Holmes era is seen as the “Gothic” era of the programme, and no story exemplified this more than The Brain of Morbius, a fairly blatant pastiche of Frankenstein, borrowing heavily from the Hammer horror films for inspiration. Nevertheless, the makers of The Brain of Morbius manages to adapt the story to its own universe with flair and the result is a darkly atmospheric tale.\n\n26. The Sea Devils (1972)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning, Roger Delgado, Clive Morton, Donald Sumpter\n\nNot far from the island where the Master is imprisoned, ships have been disappearing and a sea fort appears to be at the centre. Investigating, the Doctor discovers that a colony of Sea Devils, maritime cousins of the Silurians, have been woken and are on the attack, and have allied themselves with the Master who wants to revive the colony. The Doctor allies himself with the local Royal Navy base and attempts to arrange peace between the humans and the Sea Devils, but then a civil servant intervenes...\n\nThis is a cracking story with strong characterization and great location filming in Portsmouth (exotic for 1972!). You cannot underestimate the co-operation of the Royal Navy either. It adds a layer of reality which does not always work in Doctor Who.\n\n25. World Enough And Time (June 2017)\n\nStarring Peter Capaldi, John Simm, Pearl Mackie, Michelle Gomez, John Simm\n\nCapaldi and showrunner Steven Moffat saved one of their best until second last, with their penultimate “proper” episode proving an absolute belter.\n\nSet aboard a colony ship stuck in a black hole, it acted as both an origin story for the Cybermen and the first ever multi-Master episode, with companion Bill (Pearl Mackie) getting shockingly shot in the chest and “converted” into a Mondasian Cyberman, while Missy (Michelle Gomez) came face-to-face with her earlier incarnation (John Simm). Macabre, haunting, full of surprises and by far the best chapter of Capaldi’s farewell series.\n\n24. The Waters of Mars (2009)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Lindsay Duncan\n\nThe TARDIS lands on Mars, and the Doctor realises that he has arrived at Bowie Base One on the day it is destroyed. Members of the crew are being infected by an intelligent water-borne virus and despite the crew and the Doctor’s best efforts to counteract it, the base has to be destroyed to prevent it from infecting Earth. Although its destruction is a fixed point in time, the Doctor decides to rewrite history and rescue the last three survivors of the crew. Depositing them on Earth, Captain Adelaide Brooke, having discovered the Doctor’s knowledge of the outcome of that day, disagrees with his intervention and shoots herself to preserve history. A shaken Doctor wonders if he has gone too far…\n\nTrailed beforehand as one of the scariest stories in the history of the series, The Waters of Mars does not quite live up to that tag. However it’s still a powerful tale, with Adelaide’s suicide being one of the most shocking scenes of the Russell T Davies era. It shows the danger of the Doctor’s hubris in striking fashion.\n\nIt was a fitting swansong for director Graeme Harper, ending a 43-year association with the series that dated back to The Power of the Daleks in 1966.\n\n23. The Web of Fear (1968)\n\nStarring Patrick Troughton, Frazer Hines, Deborah Watling, Jack Watling, Nicholas Courtney\n\nThe setting is the London Underground, where, naturally, there are beasts roaming in the darkness. Unnaturally, they are Himalayan Yeti, transported from the mountains of Tibet. Great shaggy towering creatures with glowing eyes and hair as matted and filthy as any tube rat, they have infested the system and acquired the habits of spiders, spinning webs across the ribbed tunnels of the Northern Line.\n\nThe recovery of this story – which contains nightmarish imagery worthy of Buñuel or Dali – is quite remarkable. While cataloguing for the Nigerian Television Authority in Jos, archivist Philip Morris discovered all five missing episodes from The Enemy of the World and all the missing episodes (well, almost) of The Web of Fear. Until that point, all the BBC had was the first episode of The Web of Fear. But one of the Web of Fear episodes discovered by Morris – episode three – went missing. It was presumed stolen, passed to a private collector. (So the Who conspiracists say, at least.) An animated reconstruction of the third episode 3 was released in 2021 and features on iPlayer.\n\n22. Earthshock (1982)\n\nStarring Peter Davison, Matthew Waterhouse, Sarah Sutton, Janet Fielding, Beryl Reid, James Warwick\n\nThe TARDIS lands in caves in 2526, where an archaeological expedition is being attacked by killer androids guarding a bomb. The Doctor defuses the bomb and traces its signal back to space. He lands on a freighter which has been infiltrated by the Cybermen. They now plan to crash it into Earth as a plan B, and awake a Cyber army to take it over. Despite the Doctor’s efforts to thwart them they gain control and reprogramme the controls before evacuating. The Doctor kills the Cyberleader using Adric’s Gold badge but Adric, kept as a hostage by the Cybermen on the freighter, is trapped on board attempting to crack the Cybermen’s controls. Having travelled through time due to Adric’s tampering, the freighter crashes into Earth in 65million BC, killing the dinosaurs and Adric.\n\nPeter Davison’s first season was unremarkable until Earthshock descended with a mighty thud ten weeks in. Peter Grimwade’s pacy direction keeps the action and tension levels high, and the Cybermen once again come across as a credible menace, backed by some appropriate marching music courtesy of Malcolm Clarke. One of the most memorable stories of Eighties Doctor Who.\n\n21. School Reunion (2006)\n\nStarring David Tennant and Billie Piper with Elisabeth Sladen, Noel Clarke, Anthony Head\n\nAlerted by Mickey, the Doctor and Rose go undercover to investigate Deffry Vale High School, location of mysterious UFO sightings and disappearing teachers. Also on the case, unbeknownst to them, is former companion Sarah Jane Smith. The school has been taken over by Krillitanes, shape-changing aliens who are using an oil secreted by them to augment the children’s brains with the aim of using them to solve the Skasas Paradigm, a universal theory which would enable control of the building blocks of the universe. This plan is defeated, and K9 Mark III sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Krillitanes.\n\nVery rarely in Doctor Who do we see the effect that meeting him has on the lives of those around him, and never before have we seen the impact on a former companion. Sarah Jane - she and K9 are the only non-villain characters from the original series run to appear in the 21st Century version - is reintroduced beautifully, particularly the scene where Sarah discovers the TARDIS hidden in the school and the Doctor emerges from the shadows (“Hello, Sarah Jane.”)\n\nRose comes to realise that she is not unique, and there are many before her in the TARDIS, whilst Sarah (the late Elisabeth Sladen looking hardly to have aged) has to realise that the Doctor quickly moved on effectively abandoning her; as Mickey observes, it’s a “missus and the ex” scenario. As Tennant was a fan of the series at a time K9 was a regular character, one wonders just how much acting was required by him when Sarah brings the robotic dog out of the boot.\n\n20. Dalek (2005)\n\nStarring Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper\n\nThe TARDIS arrives in an underground facility owned by magnate Henry van Statten, a collector of alien artefacts. One of these has been christened a Metaltron, but the Doctor discovers it is in fact a Dalek which has escaped the Time War. Accidentally revived by Rose, the Dalek goes on the rampage in the base, but it has also absorbed some of Rose’s humanity; realising it is no longer wholly Dalek, it commits suicide.\n\nWhen the series returned in 2005, the nation began counting the days until its perennial baddies would make their comeback. And Robert Shearman’s only story for the televised series didn’t disappoint. Its power lies in both the Dalek’s merciless killing spree, but also pathos-laden scenes in which we see it experiencing pain and emotions for the first time. Indeed the Doctor comes out as no better in his dealings with his greatest foe (“Why don’t you just die?”), and the Dalek’s observation to the Doctor that he would make a good Dalek is all too accurate.\n\n19. Spearhead from Space (1970)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Nicholas Courtney, Caroline John, Hugh Burden\n\nThe newly-regenerated Doctor arrives on Earth in the middle of an apparent meteorite shower. It emerges that the so-called meteorites are alien in origin and part of an attempt by the Nestene Consciousness to colonise the Earth. UNIT are investigating, and the Doctor joins forces with them to defeat the invasion attempt.\n\nSo began an entirely new era for the Doctor. It was the first time in colour, plus and a new Doctor and assistant - this was a relaunch much like Rose was in 2005. We even have the same monster, the Autons, and the template for the scene in which shop window dummies come to life and start gunning people down. The Doctor is comatose for much of the first episode, but but once Pertwee dons his frilly cloak and cape he acquires a flamboyant authority; by the end of the story you fully accept that he is the Doctor.\n\n18. The Pyramids of Mars (1975)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Bernard Archard, Michael Sheard\n\nIn Egypt, 1911, Marcus Scarman unearths a tomb of Sutekh, and awakens this malevolent Osirian trapped for centuries by his species. This awakening drags the TARDIS off course and it lands in Scarman’s house. Sutekh animates Scarman’s cadaver as a vehicle to arrange his escape, aided by Servitor Robots looking like Egyptian mummies.\n\nTen years after the First Doctor visited ancient Egypt whilst being pursued in The Daleks’ Masterplan the series went the whole hog and had an entire story inspired by the mythology and iconography of that country. However, it gave a twist on the whole thing in that it was aliens from Phaester Osiris whose internal struggles had brought them to Egypt and inspired the mythology, a concept borrowing from Chariots of the Gods author Erich von Daniken.\n\nAlthough the mummies are excellent, it is the organic characters who take centre stage, with Baker cementing the increasing alienness of his portrayal of the hero. Pure gold.\n\n17. Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead (2008)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Catherine Tate, Alex Kingston\n\nThe Doctor takes Donna to the greatest library in the universe, a planet-sized version in the 51st century but which is curiously empty of people. He received a mysterious summons on his psychic paper to go there, and when he and Donna meet a team of archaeologists investigating why the library sealed itself a century ago it emerges that it was one of them, River Song, who sent the paper. She knows the Doctor but he does not know her – future meetings between the pair will be in her past. The library was taken over by the Vashta Nerada, voracious microscopic creatures who lurk in shadows, who claimed it for their own when the books stored there were made from the forests of their home planet.\n\nSteven Moffat seemed to specialise in creepy stories during the Russell T Davies era, and this, his final offering prior to taking over showrunning duties, was no exception. Fear of the dark and what could be lurking in the shadows is one thing; here, your own shadow can kill you. The use of atmospheric lighting (or lack of it) accentuates this overall creepiness, and two tense episodes result.\n\nRiver Song’s first appearance is suitably intriguing, and add in the mystery of the little girl and Doctor Moon, and what Donna is doing in some fantasy world, and you have a nuanced, multi-layered story which delivers plenty of atmosphere and chills.\n\n16. Heaven Sent (Nov 2015)\n\nStarring Peter Capaldi, Jenna Coleman, Jami Reid-Quarrell\n\nWhen word got out that Capaldi would helm a single-hander, few fans expected it to be this daring and dazzling. Written by Moffat and directed by Rachel Talalay, almost its entire 55-minute running time saw the Doctor trapped alone in a mysterious water-locked castle as he mourned the loss of Clara.\n\nHe had to survive an epic series of trials to escape, working out the island’s unique laws of time and physics, and evading a shrouded wraith-like creature which was trying to kill him. The twist was that he turned out to be imprisoned in his own Confession Dial by Timelord president Rassilon. A tense, trippy, looping puzzle with a heart-wrenching portrayal of grief at its emotional centre - and a virtuoso solo performance which will go down as Capaldi’s finest hour.\n\n15. The Robots of Death (1977)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Louise Jameson\n\nThe TARDIS arrives on a sandminer where the crew are gradually being murdered. Initially the Doctor and Leela are accused of the murders, but it emerges that they are being carried out by robots reprogrammed by a scientist, Taren Capel.\n\nThirty one years before the Doctor met Agatha Christie in The Unicorn and the Wasp this story was clearly influenced by the Queen of Crime, particularly Ten Little Indians. By deft characterisation and dialogue, Chris Boucher managed to create a credible planetary society, one dependent on robots to an extent that when things go awry they have problems coping.\n\nFurthermore, Kenneth Sharp’s designs take things to another level with an Art Deco look which creates some of the most beautiful-looking robots ever put on television. When script, cast, design and direction come together and intertwine perfectly the result is memorable, and this is certainly the case here in a thrillingly enjoyable murder drama.\n\n14. The Seeds of Doom (1976)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Tony Beckley, John Challis\n\nAlien seed pods are found in the Antarctic. Called in by the World Ecology Bureau the Doctor and Sarah investigate, and the Doctor establishes they are Krynoid seed pods and if they get established on Earth all animal life will be wiped out. Plant fanatic Harrison Chase arranges the theft of one of the pods, and it germinates by infecting his botanical expert Arnold Keeler, who is turned into a Krynoid and starts making plants attack animal life.\n\nOccasionally Doctor Who will come up with something so utterly bonkers that it defies description, and The Mind Robber is the acme of this. One wonders whether hallucinogenics were taken, so off the wall is this story. However, it is a very clever concept to put the regular characters in a world of fictional ones, perhaps even postmodern in that they are fictional to begin with! A dizzying series of images - lifesize clockwork soldiers, a forest of words, Jamie as a cardboard cutout, him and Zoe being trapped in the pages of a giant book – then follows. The Mind Robber wins the prize as the maddest Doctor Who story ever attempted, but its sheer lunacy makes it somehow irresistible.\n\n12. Human Nature/The Family of Blood (2007)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Freema Agyeman, Jessica Hynes, Harry Lloyd, Pip Torrens\n\nThe Doctor is being pursued by the Family of Blood who wish to take his life force to prevent themselves from dying; to evade them he uses a “chameleon arch” to make himself human and takes up a schoolmaster’s role at Farringham, a public school, just before the First World War. His Time Lord essence and memories are stored in a fob watch, which is taken by Timmy Latimer, a schoolboy. The Family arrive on Earth and with the help of stolen bodies and animated scarecrows seek the Doctor who has fallen in love with the school nurse.\n\nThis two-part story was based upon a 1995 New Adventures novel which featured the Sylvester McCoy incarnation of the Doctor. It is the only televised story to be based on a previously published Doctor Who novel.\n\nAlthough sundry companions and other characters in the series have had love stories, it is always something the Doctor had stayed aloof from until Russell T Davies’s time as showrunner. The relationship with Rose showed a few chinks in this emotional armour, but now we had the full-blown thing, albeit with a Doctor temporarily turned human. His relationship with Joan lies at the crux of this story, and Tennant and Jessica Hynes deliver pitch-perfect performances.\n\n11. The Daemons (1971)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Katy Manning, Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin, John Levene, Roger Delgado, Stephen Thorne\n\nAn archaeological dig at a barrow near the village of Devil’s End is accompanied by rumours of death and destruction if the central tomb is opened. Also in the village is the Master, posing as the local Vicar, who has created a coven out of villagers. The barrow is the resting place of Azal, a Daemon who has interfered with humanity’s development as an experiment and will now decide whether it is worthy of survival, in which case he will pass on his power, or destruction. The Master wishes to receive Azal’s power, and utilises it to animate a gargoyle, Bok to do his bidding. The dig awakens Azal, who goes to the church’s crypt to make his decision…\n\nFilmed in Aldbourne, Wiltshire, The Daemons was cited as a favourite story by most of the regular cast and prompted a video release, Return to Devil’s End, a documentary where various cast and crew returned to the village.\n\nIt’s a story that was very much a product of its time with references to the Age of Aquarius, as well as black magic covens that brought classic Hammer films to mind. The Daemons is also the quintessential Pertwee story, pitting all the UNIT regulars against the Master in dealing with an alien presence in an English village. It may not be one of the greatest stories, but in terms of sheer fun, The Daemons is one of the best.\n\n10. The Massacre (1966)\n\nStarring William Hartnell, Peter Purves, Leonard Sachs, André Morell\n\nThe TARDIS arrives in Paris in 1572, where the Catholics are about to slaughter Huguenot Protestants in the St Bartholomew Day’s Massacre. One of the leading plotters against the Huguenots is the Abbot of Amboise, who is a double of the Doctor. The Doctor reappears in time to extricate Steven from the massacre, but his insistence on leaving the Huguenots to their fate, disgusts Steven to the extent that he walks out of the TARDIS once it has landed again.\n\nPart of the remit of Doctor Who at the time was to be educational, and The Massacre certainly fulfils this – a notorious episode in 16th century French history is something not many viewers then, or now, would be particularly familiar with. And it pulls no punches: the story is more like a standard adult costume drama than Saturday teatime children’s TV. Hartnell’s performance as the Abbot demonstrates how much of his slightly erratic performance as the Doctor was acting and characterisation rather than the effects of the illness that would see him give up the role later that year. The story isn’t quite over though, for Steven’s walkout leads to one of Hartnell’s finest moments in the role, a monologue reflecting on his companions, and his refusal to go back home. Unfortunately, this story is completely absent from iPlayer.\n\n9. The Stolen Earth/Journey’s End (2008)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Catherine Tate, Billie Piper, Elisabeth Sladen, John Barrowman, Freema Agyeman, Noel Clarke, Camille Coduri\n\nThe Earth vanishes from Time and Space, and in trying to establish what has happened the Doctor and Donna go to the Shadow Proclamation where they discover it is one of 27 planetary bodies that have vanished this way. On Earth chaos has broken out, and then the Daleks invade. The barriers between the universes begin to break down, the Doctor is gunned down by a Dalek, The TARDIS and its occupants are captured and taken to the Dalek Crucible, where Davros has developed a means of destroying the multiverse, leaving the Daleks as the only creatures left in reality. And that’s only the half of it.\n\nFor the climax of the fourth season of the reborn series Russell T Davies really pulled out all the stops, and produced one of the most epic and cinematic stories the series has ever produced, as well as a superlative cliffhanger. By pulling in a huge number of elements from the series since its return in 2005, as well as both the Torchwood and Sarah Jane Adventures this was a two-parter that ran the risk of trying to do too much. Instead it’s full of wonderful moments, both big and small: look at Captain Jack’s and Sarah Jane Smith’s reactions to the Daleks when their message of “Exterminate” is broadcast to the Earth and they realise just what they are up against. Taking in comedy (thanks to Bernard Cribbens), action, tension (that regeneration cliffhanger), romance (Rose finally gets her man in the shape of the half-human Doctor), and tragedy (Donna having her memory wiped and not being able to remember her time with the Doctor), this is a real rollercoaster ride.\n\n8. Inferno (1970)\n\nStarring Jon Pertwee, Nicholas Courtney, Caroline John\n\nUNIT is providing security for Project Inferno, which is seeking to drill through the Earth’s crust to access pockets of gas discovered by its director Professor Stahlmann. Coming up the drill pipes is a type of slime which causes those who touch it to repress to primordial apelike beings who thrive on heat and turn violent. The Doctor is using the nuclear power at the project to try and get the TARDIS console working and in one experiment he finds himself transported to a parallel Earth. Here the UK is run by a fascist regime; the project is more advanced and succeeds in breaking through the crust.\n\nSeason 7 was arguably the most adult, in terms of themes, concepts and drama, that the series ever got. This tale could have been grimly compelling enough just on this planet, but sending the Doctor to a parallel universe ups the stakes. OK making the parallel counterparts Fascists isn’t the most original of ideas, but the cast rise to their counterparts – Courtney’s thuggish Brigade Leader is a bullying coward whilst Caroline John makes Section Leader Elizabeth Shaw’s journey from paid-up follower of the party line to someone more sympathetic credible.\n\n7. City of Death (1979)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Lalla Ward\n\nThe Doctor and Romana notice fractures in time whilst in Paris in 1979. These are being caused by experiments funded by Count Scarlioni, who is in fact part of Scaroth, last of the Jagaroth, who was splintered through time when his ship exploded on Earth 4 billion years ago. Another of his splinters, Captain Tancredi, is in Renaissance Italy making Leonardo da Vinci paint seven versions of the Mona Lisa; these Scarlioni will sell to collectors once he has stolen the version on display in The Louvre to fund the time experiments so that he can return in time and prevent his ship from exploding. Teaming up with private detective Duggan, the Doctor and Romana discover Scaroth’s plan but are unable to stop him travelling back in time.\n\nThe programme’s 17th season, with Douglas Adams in the script editor’s chair and Tom Baker out of control in the lead, was one of the funniest. For once a story set outside the UK is actually filmed there, the Parisian setting adding a Pink Panther-ish touch of glamour. It’s no surprise that this story is often cited as the one best to show non-fans as an example of how good the show can be. The John Cleese cameo certainly helps.\n\n6. The Deadly Assassin (1976)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Peter Pratt, Angus MacKay\n\nEn route to Gallifrey to attend the Presidential changeover, the Doctor has a premonition that the outgoing President as to be assassinated. On landing, the Doctor tries to shoot the assassin. The gun has been tampered with, the President is killed, and the Doctor stands accused. The only way for him to avoid a precipitate execution is to stand for President against the presumed successor Chancellor Goth, and the period of grace this gives him enables him to discover that the Master is on Gallifrey and clearly in league with somebody on the planet.\n\nAmid all the Gothic horror and wholesale plundering of films of the Hinchcliffe/Holmes era comes a political thriller with more than a touch of The Manchurian Candidate about it, and a dramatic reimagining of the Time Lords. No longer an awesome, all-powerful race, Robert Holmes casts them as a finicky, bureaucratic, fossilised lot – no wonder the Doctor wanted to get away from them. What really lifts this story to dizzying heights is the sudden swing at the end of episode 2, when the Doctor enters the Matrix and embarks on a surreal duel with Goth in a virtual world where willpower can cause reality to seemingly change. So much of the series’ later mythology – the various appurtenances of Rassilon, the Matrix and all it can do, the corruption of Time Lord society and the effects on them, comes from Robert Holmes’s ground-breaking, radical story.\n\n5. The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (2005)\n\nStarring Christopher Eccleston, Billie Piper, John Barrowman, Richard Wilson, Florence Hoath\n\nThe Doctor and Rose chase a mysterious metal cylinder through the Time Vortex which lands in London in 1941. While searching for it the Doctor meets up with a girl called Nancy who leads a group of children who eat dinners left standing during air raids. Meanwhile Rose gets entangled in the ropes of a barrage balloon and drifts across London before being saved by a former Time Agent calling himself Captain Jack Harkness. Captain Jack is using the cylinder as part of a scam with the Doctor and Rose as the intended targets. Wandering the streets of London is a boy in a gas mask who is repeatedly asking the question “Are you my mummy?” Nancy warns the Doctor he is an “empty child” and he seems to be the source of an infection through which people’s faces become combined with gas masks\n\nThis story saw the first appearance of Captain Jack and was the first written by Steven Moffat (excluding the 1998 Comic Relief spoof). It has been a trope since the series started that part of its aim is to scare, and if there were any doubts that its 21st century incarnation might not follow in this vein, this two-parter would have put them firmly to rest. Cannily using a night-time setting to add a layer of eeriness, the simple image of a boy in a gas mask asking a repeated question leads to a generally scary couple of episodes. It is another example of how in the right hands the seemingly mundane can be transformed by Doctor Who into something unsettling, and by the device of making him speak through a variety of media (including an external phone on the Tardis police box) it gives him a genuinely unsettling ability.\n\nHowever there is more to this story than simple chills as Moffat gives it a number of layers as well. For the first time in this life the Doctor has something of a rival in Captain Jack, and their interaction adds something new to Eccleston’s portrayal (the lovely scene where he justifies his sonic device as compared with Jack’s is an example). Florence Hoath shines as the Faginesque Nancy and Richard Wilson may not be seen much but steals the show whenever he is on screen. Chilling, gripping and emotionally truthful, this two-parter was the crowning glory of the first series of the reborn show.\n\n4. The Caves of Androzani (1984)\n\nStarring Peter Davison, Nicola Bryant, Christopher Gable, Robert Glenister\n\nLanding on Androzani Minor, the Doctor and Peri become caught up in the conflict between Trau Morgus and Sharaz Jek. They are captured by General Chellak, whose government-backed army is seeking to stop Jek and his android army, accused of being gun-runners and sentenced to execution. Later, having come into contact with a ball of the raw drug spectrox, the Doctor and Peri start to suffer from toxaemia.\n\nThe Peter Davison era of the programme had been generally solid rather than spectacular but this explosive finale saw it go out with a considerable bang. The Caves of Androzani is a tale of duplicity and revenge: Sharaz Jek may at first seem like a bad guy, but his actions are perfectly understandable given what had happened to him. He is an interesting, nuanced character, well played by former ballet dancer Christopher Gable.\n\nIndeed, characterisation is a strong point, with hardly a dud turn from the major characters, and the outgoing Peter Davison, perhaps realising it is his last chance to shine, responds accordingly with his finest performance. However, what lifts this story into the stratosphere is Graeme Harper’s direction, a truly astonishing debut in the directorial chair which barely lets the tension slip.\n\n3. Genesis of the Daleks (1975)\n\nStarring Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, Ian Marter, Michael Wisher\n\nThe Time Lords send the Doctor, Sarah and Harry to Skaro before the Daleks were created and charge the Doctor with preventing their development. On Skaro, the Kaleds and Thals have been at war for a millennium, and caught up in a Thal attack the Doctor and Harry are taken prisoner by the Kaleds whilst Sarah is lost in a no-man’s-land. There, she witnesses the testing of a Dalek, before being captured by the Thals to work on their rocket. Later, the Doctor and Harry encounter the Kaleds’ scientific corps, led by Davros, a crippled scientist artificially kept alive. Davros has developed the ultimate mutation of the Kaleds, removed humanising emotions and housed it in a “Mark III travel machine” which he christens a Dalek …\n\nHaving felt that Terry Nation’s offering for the 1975 series was a retread of old ground, Terrance Dicks suggested that he explore the creation of the Daleks, and he hit the jackpot. You do wonder how much of the final version was Terry Nation and how much was script editor Robert Holmes, though, as there is a depth to this tale which hadn’t been evident in Nation’s work since his original tale in 1963. Take the Doctor and Davros’s philosophical discussion about whether to release a killer virus and the Doctor’s “have I the right” scene over whether to commit genocide on the early Daleks. It’s powerful, thought-provoking stuff.\n\nAlthough Harry is made a bit redundant and some of Davros’s rejected experiments aren’t terribly convincing, these are only minor glitches in a gripping story which displays the brutality of war in a way rarely matched in the series. It also gives the Doctor only a partial victory, but there again he could hardly succeed and eliminate the Daleks from history, could he?\n\n2. Blink (2007)\n\nStarring David Tennant, Carey Mulligan, Freema Agyeman\n\nSally Sparrow enters an abandoned house looking for photographic ideas but discovers messages to her from the Doctor behind wallpaper. Returning with a friend the next day who disappears and finds herself in the Twenties. Sally receives a letter from her friend’s grandson explaining what had happened to her and requesting that Sally tell her brother Larry why she has disappeared. When she reports it to the local police station, the detective also disappears and Sally then receives a call from him on his deathbed in hospital in 1969. Through a series of DVDs, Sally discovers a series of messages from the Doctor saying that the statues in the house are Weeping Angels who have transported him back to the past and want the Tardis for its potential power. Telling Sally not to blink when Angels are around, she suddenly realises there is an Angel in the room …"
