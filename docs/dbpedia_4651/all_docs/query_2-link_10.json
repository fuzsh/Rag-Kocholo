        "text": "Throughout their travels in time and space, the Doctor took on and was called by a number of different aliases, titles and names. Some were fleeting, while others, like John Smith, were used by almost all of their incarnations, with some variations. The Doctor told very few people their original name, instead asking others to simply call them the Doctor. By many accounts, the Doctor considered this title to be their real name. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013). et al.) It was their chosen identity, and a promise to the universe. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nIn other accounts, however, the Doctor's \"true name\" was the one which was hidden, a guarded secret the Doctor kept from almost everyone. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007)., The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) Most names the Doctor kept were a matter of convenience, and they were prone to take on whichever name would help them blend in best, or stand out more, depending on the situation. Some companions felt this was not the Doctor's strongest suit, however. (AUDIO: What Just Happened? et al.)\n\nThe Doctor's real name[]\n\nThis section's awfully stubby.\n\nInformation from Return of the Living Dad\n\nMost accounts treated the Doctor's true name as a complete mystery. Bill Potts, his student, asserted that \"nobody [knew] the Doctor's real name\", although Missy claimed that she was an exception to this given that she \"grew up with him\". (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) One account even implied that their given name was ceremoniously withdrawn and stricken by their Cousins as punishment for a disgrace the Doctor had brought upon their House. (PROSE: Lungbarrow [+]Marc Platt, adapted from Lungbarrow, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) However, the Doctor's true name did appear in secret files created by the High Court of the Time Lords, containing a transcript of the Doctor's trial, where it was spelled as \"∂³Σx²\". (PROSE: The Trial of Doctor Who) While wandering in the Doctor's TARDIS, Clara Oswald read a history of the Time War which apparently told her the Doctor's name, causing her to remark \"So that's who.\" (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nEven when put on trial by the Time Lords, they were only referred to as \"the Doctor\", (TV: The War Games [+]Terrance Dicks and Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 6 (BBC1, 1969).) although the Valeyard, a culmination of the Doctor's darker side who prosecuted the second trial, acknowledged that this was an alias. (TV: The Mysterious Planet [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) When the Fifth Doctor was officially inducted as Lord President, he declared that it was \"out of the question\" for him to be introduced by his true name, stating that he would accept being introduced as \"Lord President Doctor\". (AUDIO: Time in Office) Even those who had known them in childhood addressed them only as \"the Doctor\", such as the Master, (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) and the Rani. (COMIC: Weapons of Past Destruction)\n\nAccording to one account, during their first incarnation, the Doctor adopted this name in dealing with human colonists on the planet Iwa at the same time that his granddaughter adopted the name \"Susan\". (PROSE: Frayed [+]Tara Samms, Telos Doctor Who novellas (Telos Publishing, 2003).) Other accounts implied that the Doctor's title had been chosen as a Gallifreyan custom, (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) and that he had been using it before he left Gallifrey. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor's real name has been said to be difficult to pronounce, for humans at least, (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Auton Invasion [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from Spearhead from Space (Robert Holmes), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1974)., AUDIO: Slipback) and certainly for adults, (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).) possessing thirty eight syllables. (PROSE: SLEEPY [+]Kate Orman, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1996).) The First Doctor once told an interrogator he \"wouldn't be able to pronounce the first syllable of [his name].\" (PROSE: Salvation [+]Steve Lyons, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1999).) His seventh incarnation likewise told one of his captors that he \"doubt[ed] [they]'d be able to pronounce the name [he] was originally given.\" (PROSE: Illegal Alien [+]Mike Tucker and Robert Perry, adapted from Illegal Alien, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) When asked about the Doctor's name, Peri Brown once said that the Doctor had told her she would find it unpronounceable. (AUDIO: Slipback) Moments before his regeneration, however, the Twelfth Doctor stated his belief that \"children [could] hear [his name]\", but only when \"their hearts [were] in the right place, and the stars [were] too.\" (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nThe Doctor kept their true name hidden despite numerous \"mind-probe\" attempts and the effect of a truth field. (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006)., The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) The Carrionite Lilith, unable to discover the Tenth Doctor's true name even with the \"witchcraft\" used by her kind, remarked that \"there [was] no name,\" and that the Doctor was hiding it in despair. (TV: The Shakespeare Code [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The psychically-gifted Evelina, who attempted to foretell the Doctor's future, remarked that his \"true name\" was \"hidden\" from her. (TV: The Fires of Pompeii [+]James Moran, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nBy one account, in his youth, the Doctor had outright removed his name from time, all but he and the Master forgetting his birth name. (AUDIO: Blood of the Time Lords)\n\nSignificance[]\n\nBy one account, names held mystic importance in Time Lord society, meaning that all Time Lords kept their true names as closely-guarded secrets. In this sense, the Doctor's name was not any more or less significant than any other Time Lord's. (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Auton Invasion [+]Terrance Dicks, adapted from Spearhead from Space (Robert Holmes), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1974).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor told Clara Oswald that his original name was not important since he specifically chose the title of \"Doctor\" to take its place, saying it was \"like a promise [one made].\" (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) This promise was; \"Never cruel or cowardly. Never give up, never give in.\" (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) Even Clara considered \"the Doctor\" to be his true name and the only one that mattered. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).) Despite their hatred of the War Doctor's actions, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) both the tenth and eleventh incarnations admitted \"[he] was the Doctor more than [any of them].\" (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) When Clara was forced to take on his role for him, the Twelfth Doctor told her that \"goodness has nothing to do with [being a Doctor]\". (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor considered abandoning his name if he felt he had to do something highly immoral. (TV: The Beast Below [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010)., Face the Raven) The War Doctor rejected the name to fight in the Time War, (TV: The Night of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Specials minisode (BBC One, 2013).) but proudly called himself the Doctor once he was given the chance to end the conflict without killing the Time Lords. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) During his final day, the Twelfth Doctor stated being \"the Doctor\" was being kind, even if it meant pulling a self-sacrifice to bring others a small amount of extra time to live. (TV: The Doctor Falls [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) The Thirteenth Doctor said that a \"bit of adrenaline, dash of outrage and a hint of panic\" helped her to remember she was the Doctor. (TV: The Woman Who Fell to Earth)\n\nThe Saxon Master knew of this and implied that the Doctor's title had been chosen because it meant \"the man who makes people better\", although he found the choice \"sanctimonious\" for someone who ended millions of lives and ruined many others. (TV: The Sound of Drums [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) River Song was aware of this contradiction in the Doctor's behaviour: she said that the Doctor was the first to have this title and that the rest of the universe later adopted it, usually to mean \"healer\" or \"wise man\". However, she added that, in some parts of the universe, such as in the Gamma Forests, it eventually came to mean \"mighty warrior\". (TV: A Good Man Goes to War)\n\nAccording to Dorium Maldovar, the Silence had a particular interest in the Doctor's name. He explained that if the Doctor lived long enough, \"on the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, [when] no creature could speak falsely or fail to answer\", a question that must never be answered would be asked: \"Doctor Who?\". The Silence wanted to stop the Doctor from revealing his true name. (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe Doctor was at a later time forced to go to Trenzalore to rescue his friends from the Great Intelligence, which sought to gain access to the Doctor's tomb. The tomb, which was a future version of his own dying TARDIS, would open only to the Doctor's real name. The Intelligence threatened to kill Clara Oswald and the Paternoster Gang if he did not speak his name and open the tomb; the situation was resolved when the data ghost of River Song was able to silently transmit his name to the TARDIS, thus opening the door for the Great Intelligence. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor's real name became important during the Siege of Trenzalore, as it was the signal chosen by the Time Lords to come back to the universe, broadcasting the question \"Doctor Who?\" through a crack in reality, simultaneously broadcasting a Truth Field so that they could be sure that it was truly the Doctor responding to them. Despite this, when the Doctor was facing death, Clara told the Time Lords through the Crack that the only name of his that mattered was \"the Doctor\" and everything he stood for under that name, prompting them to give the Doctor a new regeneration cycle at the cost of closing the crack. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter meeting his twelfth incarnation, the First Doctor was confronted by the mysterious Testimony Foundation, who claimed that the Doctor was the \"Doctor of War\". Although the First Doctor initially feared this interpretation of his future, after witnessing the Twelfth Doctor's efforts to save Captain Archibald Hamish Lethbridge-Stewart, he came to conclude that the \"Doctor of War\" was not a man who revelled in war, but a man who sought the moments of peace that existed amid open warfare, and who would always try to find another way to end war, and to find resolution, rather than resorting to bloodshed. (TV: Twice Upon a Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\nUbiquity of the title[]\n\nThe Doctor did possess at least one doctorate. (TV: The Moonbase [+]Kit Pedler, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).', The Armageddon Factor [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1979)., The Mysterious Planet [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 23 (BBC1, 1986).) They sometimes described themselves as a \"doctor of many things\" (TV: Four to Doomsday) or of \"everything\", (TV: Spearhead from Space [+]Robert Holmes, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970)., Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) as well as \"a scientist, an engineer, builder of things\". (TV: The Aztecs) However, their knowledge was limited to anything prior to the Rassilon Era. (TV: Utopia [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).) The Eleventh Doctor claimed that one of his doctorates was in cheesemaking, (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) but only the \"stinky, blue kind\". (PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nOn several occasions, the Doctor claimed they were not a medical doctor. (TV: \"\"The Forest of Fear\" [+]Part of An Unearthly Child, Anthony Coburn, adapted from The Pilot Episode (Anthony Coburn), Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1963).\", \"\"Mighty Kublai Khan\" [+]Part of Marco Polo, John Lucarotti, Doctor Who season 1 (BBC tv, 1964).\") Though by their second incarnation, he had studied medicine in the 19th century, (TV: The Moonbase [+]Kit Pedler, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).') although Clara recalled the Doctor telling her that he graduated in the wrong century. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) The Eleventh Doctor described himself as a medical doctor. (TV: The God Complex [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).) The seventh, eleventh and twelfth incarnations displayed some medical knowledge, being able to help with minor injuries (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988)., The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) and tell if a person was vitamin deficient. (TV: Thin Ice [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) The Ninth Doctor could also diagnose patients in a hospital ward, quickly deducing they all shared the injuries of a scar on the back of their hands, collapsed chest cavities, crushed rib cages and gas masks fused into the flesh on their faces, (TV: The Empty Child [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) and displayed extensive knowledge on nanogenes, such as their ability to repair organic matter and restore life as a mere \"quirk of matter\". (TV: The Doctor Dances [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) The Tenth Doctor in particular proved a proficient medic, performing life-saving surgery on Laszlo, sustaining him as a Human-Pig hybrid, able to live as long as a human again. (TV: Evolution of the Daleks [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nWhen asked by Mabli if her doctorate was in medicine, the Thirteenth Doctor described herself as having a doctorate in \"medicine, science, engineering, candyfloss, Lego, philosophy, music, problems, people, [and] hope.\" (TV: The Tsuranga Conundrum [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 11 (BBC One, 2018).)\n\nIndividuals with knowledge of the Doctor's name[]\n\nSusan Foreman knew the Doctor's real name, and wrote it on the wrappings of a hypercube she sent to him after she had settled down on Earth. (PROSE: Ghost of Christmas Past)\n\nThe Sixth Doctor told his dance instructor, Becky, his name. (PROSE: Teach Yourself Ballroom Dancing)\n\nThe Eighth Doctor's companion, Sam Jones, overheard his real name being said. She found it quite alien and virtually unpronounceable. (PROSE: Vanderdeken's Children [+]Christopher Bulis, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1998).)\n\nWhen the Tenth Doctor first encountered her, River Song claimed to have known him at some point in his future, (TV: Silence in the Library [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) and, to prove her \"credentials\", she whispered his name in his ear, and apologised for having to do so. The Doctor was shocked at this, as \"there [was] only one reason [he] would ever tell anyone [his] name, [and] only one time [he] could.\" (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).) River indicated to Clara Oswald that she \"made\" the Doctor tell her his name and that \"it took a lot of effort\". (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nNear the end of his life, despite believing there was no one left in the universe who knew it, the Tenth Doctor encountered members of an unidentified pan-dimensional race that knew his real name. (AUDIO: The Last Voyage)\n\nWhile separated from the Eleventh Doctor, Clara Oswald read his name in The History of the Time War. Though that timeline was aborted, leaving her with no memory of it, (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) she later began to recall certain moments of the timeline, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and claimed to know the Doctor's name when bluffing to the Cybermen about being the Doctor. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Additionally, she was able to hear and see River when she said the Doctor's name to open his tomb, but the circumstances of River's saying of the Doctor's name are unknown. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nMissy claimed to know the Doctor's real name from their time together on Gallifrey. She said it was \"Doctor Who\", and the Doctor had chosen it to be mysterious, but dropped the \"Who\" when he realised it was \"too on-the-nose\". The Twelfth Doctor said she was just teasing Bill Potts, but he refused to answer if it was truly his name. (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).)\n\n\"Doctor Who\"[]\n\nThe name \"Doctor Who\" was used by or applied to the Doctor on a large number of occasions, with accounts varying on whether this seemed to be the time-traveller's actual name — or at any rate a name they accepted and used for themselves — or simply a placeholder applied to them by others for lack of knowledge of his real names.\n\nThe Third Doctor once stated that his real name was not \"Doctor Who\", but that others often called him that for lack of him divulging his actual true name. (TV: The Shrink [+]BBC One (1989).)\n\nThe Master addressed a postcard to the Third Doctor as \"Dr Who\". (COMIC: Fogbound) Missy later made two bold claims to Bill Potts in quick succession, first that \"Doctor Who\" was in fact the Doctor's real name, and second that it was, more specifically, an alias he had chosen himself early on, as an attempt to \"sound mysterious\". In this account, he would later drop the \"Who\" because it was \"a tiny bit on-the-nose\". The Twelfth Doctor told Bill she was just trying to wind her up, but he later identified himself as \"Doctor Who\" to Jorj, noting that he liked the name. (TV: World Enough and Time [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 10 (BBC One, 2017).) According to one account, a conversation he had with Missy at an earlier point bore out Missy's claim, seeing him explain to her that the name arose from the question of \"who to save\", calling it \"the Doctor's Who\". (COMIC: The Road To...)\n\nWhen the First Doctor was using the name \"Doctor Caligari\" and someone remarked, \"Doctor who?\" he replied, \"Yes, quite right.\"; (TV: The Gunfighters) similarly, when Jimmy Forbes asked \"Doctor who?\", another incarnation of the Doctor replied \"Yes, if you like.\", (AUDIO: Seven Keys to Doomsday) and when Citizen 327KL asked \"Doctor who?\", the Fourth Doctor simply said \"yes\". (TV: Dr. Who For Keep Australia Beautiful [+]1979.) The Fourth Doctor outright stated that his name was \"Dr Who\" when Richard the Lionheart asked for his name; King Richard later referred to him as simply \"Who\". (PROSE: Doctor Who Discovers The Conquerors [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe TARDIS-Keeper on Gallifrey also knew the Doctor as \"Who\". (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon [+]Malcolm Hulke, adapted from Colony in Space (Malcolm Hulke), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1974).)\n\nThe computer WOTAN repeatedly referred to the First Doctor as \"Doctor Who\". (TV: The War Machines [+]Ian Stuart Black, Doctor Who season 3 (BBC1, 1966).) Both Ian Chesterton and Vicki occasionally called the Doctor \"Doctor Who\", (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Zarbi) as did Argon, (PROSE: Terror on Tiro) Mitzog, (PROSE: The Cloud Exiles) and Phlege. (COMIC: Mission for Duh) The Doctor's grandson John (COMIC: The Klepton Parasites) used the last name \"Who\". (PROSE: Beware the Trods!)\n\nThe First Doctor used the username \"Dr_who\" when bidding on the TARDIS, which he lost to Buchanan in a bet, on RetroAuction.com in 2006. (PROSE: The Mother Road)\n\nThe Second Doctor briefly used the name \"Doktor von Wer\" (literally, \"Doctor [of] Who\") during his visit to Scotland on 16 April 1746, (TV: The Highlanders [+]Elwyn Jones and Gerry Davis, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1966-1967).) and he once signed a message as \"Dr W.\" (TV: The Underwater Menace [+]Geoffrey Orme, Doctor Who season 4 (BBC1, 1967).) The Zaons called him \"Doctor Who\". (PROSE: Daleks Invade Zaos)\n\nBessie's license plate during the Third Doctor's time at UNIT read WHO 1; (TV: Doctor Who and the Silurians [+]Malcolm Hulke, Doctor Who season 7 (BBC1, 1970).) in the Doctor's seventh incarnation it read WHO 7, (TV: Battlefield [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 26 (BBC1, 1989).) and WHO 8 in his eighth incarnation. (PROSE: The Dying Days [+]Lance Parkin, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1997).) Miss Hawthorne referred to the Third Doctor as \"the great wizard Qui Quae Quod\"; those three words all mean \"who\" in Latin. (TV: The Dæmons) The aged Keeper of the Files referred to the Doctor with the name \"Who\". (PROSE: Doctor Who and the Doomsday Weapon [+]Malcolm Hulke, adapted from Colony in Space (Malcolm Hulke), Target novelisations (Target Books, 1974).) The Curator referred to his nose as a \"Who nose\", (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).) and after discovering his formative role in Davros's early life, the Twelfth Doctor remarked that \"Who made Davros.\" (TV: The Magician's Apprentice)\n\nThe Fourth Doctor wrote a series of children's books during his time with UNIT which were mistakenly published under the name \"Doctor Who\": they were intended to be \"The Doctor, Who Discovers Historical Mysteries\", but the publishers, due to a miscommunication, presented it as \"Doctor Who Discovers Historical Mysteries\". (AUDIO: The Kingmaker) A version of the Doctor in a young boy's imagination, based off a fictional depiction of the Doctor off television, claimed that she was \"not allowed\" to refer to herself as \"Doctor Who\", despite personally finding it \"brilliant\". (PROSE: The Terror of the Umpty Ums)\n\nK9 occasionally made playful remarks related to the \"Who\" name. (TV: A Girl's Best Friend, Invasion of the Bane) Clive Finch's website called him \"Doctor Who\". (TV: Rose [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Upon reading the Tenth Doctor's mind, Reinette remarked that \"Doctor Who\" was \"more than just a secret\". (TV: The Girl in the Fireplace [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One, 2006).) The oldest question in the universe was \"Doctor Who?\" (TV: The Wedding of River Song [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 6 (BBC One, 2011).)\n\nThe version of the Doctor in the Land of Fiction was known as Dr. Who. (PROSE: Prelude Conundrum, Conundrum, Head Games) On television in the 1960s, fans referred to him as Dr. Who. (COMIC: TV Terrors)\n\nTheta Sigma[]\n\nThe Doctor's old Academy schoolmate Drax knew the Doctor as \"Theta Sigma\", which he informally shortened to \"Thete\". The Fourth Doctor repeatedly corrected him when they met again centuries later, wanting to be called Doctor instead. (TV: The Armageddon Factor [+]Bob Baker and Dave Martin, Doctor Who season 16 (BBC1, 1979).)\n\nSome accounts treated \"Theta Sigma\" as the Doctor's actual, proper name as far as Gallifrey was concerned; for example, some Gallifreyan records noted that K9 Mark I had formerly been a companion to \"the Time Lord Theta Sigma\". (PROSE: K9 and the Beasts of Vega, etc.) In an alternate timeline in which Rassilon failed to finish the Eye of Harmony before his death, the Doctor never left Gallifrey and became a commentator rather than a renegade Time Lord. He was known as Commentator Theta Sigma. (AUDIO: Forever)\n\n\"ΘΣ\" was part of River Song's message to the Eleventh Doctor on the universe's oldest cliff-face. (TV: The Pandorica Opens [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) River Song claimed and demonstrated on numerous occasions that she knew the Doctor's secret real name. (TV: Forest of the Dead [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)., The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013)., etc.)\n\nHowever, the Seventh Doctor would later claim that \"Theta Sigma\" was his \"nickname at college\" to the coincidentally-named Trevor Sigma. (TV: The Happiness Patrol [+]Graeme Curry, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) The Ninth Doctor would later reiterate this in a duel with the Grimminy-Grew to guess the other's true name, saying that \"old school nicknames don't count\". (AUDIO: Station to Station)\n\nIn one account, the Doctor considered it a \"Time Lord coding\", which he couldn't \"bear [to be] addressed as\".

(PROSE: Alien Bodies [+]Lawrence Miles, BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 1997).) It was often preceded by the title \"Doctor\", though not always — for example, when he was undercover as a teacher at a school or a patient in a hospital. (TV: School Reunion [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 2 (BBC One|BBC One]], 2006)., Smith and Jones [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).') As \"John Smith\" was considered a generic name in some Earth cultures, the Doctor's use of the alias was occasionally treated with scepticism. (TV: Midnight [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nThe First Doctor used a library card with the name Dr J. Smith while living at 76 Totter's Lane, (TV: The Vampires of Venice [+]Toby Whithouse, Doctor Who series 5 (BBC One, 2010).) as well as for identification when renting the junkyard.

The UNIT files referred to him as \"Dr. J.S.\". (AUDIO: Tales from the Vault)\n\nThe Doctor twice changed himself into a human who used the name John Smith. This occurred in their seventh incarnation, (PROSE: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1995).) and in their tenth incarnation. (TV: Human Nature [+]Paul Cornell, adapted from Human Nature (Paul Cornell), Doctor Who series 3 (BBC One, 2007).)\n\nOften, the Doctor would use variations of the name, like the online handle \"jsmith\", jsmith8\", (PROSE: Blue Box [+]Kate Orman, BBC Past Doctor Adventures (BBC Books, 2003)., Lonely) the French variation \"Jean Forgeron\", (COMIC: The Forgotten) or the German translation \"Johann Schmidt\".

(TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) In Draconian, the title was pronounced \"Karshtakavaar\". (PROSE: Love and War [+]Paul Cornell, Virgin New Adventures (Virgin Books, 1992).) After being told of the title by the Ninth Doctor, (TV: The Parting of the Ways [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 1 (BBC One, 2005).) Rose Tyler called the Tenth Doctor by the \"Oncoming Storm\" when she and Mickey Smith were being prepared for dissection by the Clockwork Droids.

(TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, 50th Anniversary Specials (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Eleventh Doctor began calling himself the \"Oncoming Storm\" when he misinterpreted Sean's request to help the King's Arms football team \"annihilate\" another team at a match.

(PROSE: Timewyrm: Revelation) or possibly, \"Nice guy, if you're a biped\". (PROSE: Continuity Errors) He had been awarded the name upon orchestrating the destruction of the Dalek home planet Skaro in his seventh incarnation, (TV: Remembrance of the Daleks [+]Ben Aaronovitch, Doctor Who season 25 (BBC1, 1988).) though the Daleks also used it prior to Skaro's destruction. (COMIC: Bringer of Darkness) Davros also referred to the Doctor as \"the Destroyer of Worlds\" after the Meta-Crisis Tenth Doctor destroyed the New Dalek Empire on the Crucible. (TV: Journey's End [+]Russell T Davies, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).)\n\nFirst Doctor[]\n\nKnown uses of John Smith[]\n\nHe used it as identification when renting the junkyard from its owner, Hawkins.
