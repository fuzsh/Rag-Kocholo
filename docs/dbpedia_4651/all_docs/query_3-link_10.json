        "text": "@Ozzy​ hey, that’s great news! The only thing I noticed that I think needs to be changed is that the 2023 specials that released on Disney+ should actually be considered part of the new show, especially the Christmas Special, “The Church on Ruby Road”.\n\nThe BBC distinguishes the shows on their websites as “Doctor Who (2005-2022)” and “Doctor Who (2023-)”.\n\nThanks so much for your work on this!\n\n@Ozzy​\n\nwhile Russell T Davies and BBC are referring to the Series as “Season 1” this is purely for marketing reasons and mostly to do with Disney +. It is still technically Series 14, at no point as it been said that Series 13 was the last series of Doctor Who and and no point has it been said one series has ended and another has started. Therefore it seems odd to list to start a new listing. This also goes for having things like “The Night of the Doctor” having its own page when it’s part of the series and a mini episode. Is it possible to review the decision to create a separate page?\n\n@MitchellK​ Just out of curiosity, why do you feel it is (so) important how the BBC feels about this? IMDb is not owned by the BBC so IMDb can list it however they want and you are allowed to have your own idea about whether or not something is a new series or a continuation of an already existing series, regardless of how the BBC or IMDb feels about it.\n\nI personally have never seen anything regarding Doctor Who, so I can't say anything definitive about this, but in general, I find a significant gap in time a good (potential) reason to consider something a new series. So in the case of Doctor Who (1963-1989) and Doctor Who (2005-2022), it doesn't come across as strange to me that they are listed as two series. Obviously, the gap in time can't be the reason to consider this new season a new show, so it must be something else. IIUC, there have been several actors who have portrayed the Doctor and that never seems to have been a reason for anybody to consider a new season a new show, so that can't be it either.\n\nAs I've said earlier in this thread, there might be a very good reason, or even several good reasons, to consider the new season a new show. But up until now, the only reason I've seen in this thread (and yes, I know IMDb uses this argument as well) is \"some people who happen to work on this show say so\". Not really the best argument ever I would say, especially if those people who work on this show don't care to explain why they feel the way they do."
