Each episode was broadcast on BBC Three on Saturdays, immediately after the broadcast of the weekly television episode on BBC One. The first and second series episodes ran 30 minutes each; third series instalments ran 45 minutes.[1] BBC Three also broadcast a cut-down edition of the programme, lasting 15 minutes, shown after the repeats on Sundays and Fridays and after the weekday evening repeats of earlier seasons. Confidential received its own version of the Doctor Who theme tune, at least three different versions of the theme appeared in the series.\n\nIn September 2011, the BBC announced the cancellation of the series as a cost-cutting measure. Fans attempted to reverse the decision using an online petition. The decision was criticised by writers for the show and the incumbent Doctor, Matt Smith.\n\nIn February 2013, Doctor Who Confidential was voted the best BBC Three show of all time in a Radio Times poll on their website.[2]\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series is described as focusing on the human element of the series, Confidential features behind-the-scenes footage on the making of Doctor Who through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series over the years of its existence. Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the Doctor Who episode that preceded it. There have also been several episodes of Doctor Who Confidential broadcast apart from the showing of Doctor Who episodes.\n\nNarrators\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Tennant (series 1, episode \"New Dimension\" only.)\n\nSimon Pegg (series 1)\n\nMark Gatiss (series 2)\n\nAnthony Head (series 3, 4, 2009–2010 specials)\n\nNoel Clarke (2009–2010 specials, episode \"Desert Storm\" only.)\n\nAlex Price (series 5)\n\nRussell Tovey (series 6)\n\n\"Greatest Moments\", the \"2010 specials\", and \"My Sarah Jane\" primarily consisted of interviews and clips from the series featuring no primary host.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following table dictates the season or series in question; singular specials are not included in episode counts.

New episodes were broadcast on BBC Three immediately following the broadcast of Doctor Who, two documentary specials were made for broadcast on BBC One, incorporating material from the Confidential episodes. The first was broadcast on the evening of the first episode, \"Rose\", and was narrated by David Tennant, prior to his being named as the Tenth Doctor. The second was broadcast immediately prior to the final episode, \"The Parting of the Ways\", and was narrated by Pegg. These episodes were not given the Confidential title, and are therefore separate from the series proper. Thirdly, a special DVD-only episode of the series, containing behind-the-scenes information on \"The Christmas Invasion\", was also made by the production team for release on the set.\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseriesTitleDoctor Who episodeOriginal air date1S1\"A New Dimension\"Preview and creation of reviving Doctor Who.26 March 2005 ( ) 21\"Bringing Back the Doctor\"\"Rose\"26 March 2005 ( ) 32\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\"\"The End of the World\"2 April 2005 ( ) 43\"TARDIS Tales\"\"The Unquiet Dead\"9 April 2005 ( ) 54\"I Get a Side-Kick Out of You\"\"Aliens of London\"16 April 2005 ( ) 65\"Why on Earth?\"\"World War Three\"23 April 2005 ( ) 76\"Dalek\"\"Dalek\"30 April 2005 ( ) 87\"The Dark Side\"\"The Long Game\"7 May 2005 ( ) 98\"Time Trouble\"\"Father's Day\"14 May 2005 ( ) 109\"Special Effects\"\"The Empty Child\"21 May 2005 ( ) 1110\"Weird Science\"\"The Doctor Dances\"28 May 2005 ( ) 1211\"Unsung Heroes and Violent Death\"\"Boom Town\"4 June 2005 ( ) 1312\"The World of Who\"\"Bad Wolf\"11 June 2005 ( ) 1413\"The Last Battle\"\"The Parting of the Ways\"18 June 2005 ( ) 15S2\"The Ultimate Guide\"Series 118 June 2005 ( )\n\nSeries 2 (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Doctor Who (series 2)\n\nA second season of Doctor Who Confidential was commissioned to accompany the 2006 series.

Initially, repeat airings of the series were the full length episodes; however, beginning with Episode 6, BBC Three broadcast fifteen-minute versions, entitled Doctor Who Confidential: Cut Down, containing only the new series-related footage were released on the Series 1 DVD box set. The full versions of the episodes have since been made available on BBC iPlayer.\n\nFor series two, a special episode of the programme was produced for BBC's Doctor Who Night on 9 April 2006. Due to a wide range of schedule changes that either delayed or altered transmission of Doctor Who, the series aired at various times during its run. Unlike the first series, no episodes were webcast. These were also released on the DVD in edited-down format (once again subtitled Cut Down); the first episode of the season, \"One Year On\", was not released to DVD. A documentary special that was made for broadcast on BBC One on the day of \"The Runaway Bride\". The special was broadcast with the \"Confidential\" title (albeit with \"Christmas Special\" attached), opening theme, and unique titles (with images from \"The Runaway Bride\") and followed the creation of the Doctor Who: A Celebration concert.\n\nSeries 3–4, and the 2009–2010 specials\n\n[edit]\n\nThe episode running length was increased to 45 minutes for the third series, with 30-minute and 15-minute versions also prepared for broadcast. The 15-minute versions were available for download from the official website. As per previous seasons, all regular episodes were edited down into shorter versions for inclusion on the DVD release; for the first time, however, a complete Confidential episode was included on the DVD release: the \"Music & Monsters\" special. One episode, covering the making of the Children in Need special \"Time Crash\" was posted on the Children in Need website after the scene's airing. A 30-minute special, created by the Confidential team, was shown as part of the BBC's arts' season, entitled \"On Show - Designs on Doctor Who\", was first broadcast on BBC Two Wales. After \"Voyage of the Damned\", an episode was broadcast on BBC Three.\n\nThe 2008–10 specials were the first Confidential editions to be broadcast on BBC HD as well as BBC Three. The series also made a move to a high definition format. The full episodes of Confidential relating to the 2008–10 specials are available for immediate broadcast through Amazon Prime Video in the United States with an Amazon Prime subscription. These are the only full episodes of Confidential legally available for video-on-demand streaming. A 30-minute \"best moments\" feature was included on the DVD release of the Cybermen Collection.\n\nSeries 5–6, the 2010 specials, and the My Sarah Jane special\n\n[edit]\n\nEpisodes continued to be broadcast on BBC Three and BBC HD for series five and six. Similar to previous series, versions of the episodes entitled Cut Down were released on the DVD sets however, the full episode of Confidential relating to A Christmas Carol was released instead. Two specials were created between series five and six, on which was made specifically for broadcast on BBC America. A third special commemorating the death of Elisabeth Sladen was produced by the Confidential team as well and was aired on CBBC.\n\nCancellation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 28 September 2011, a few days prior to the broadcast of the Confidential episode to accompany season 6 finale \"The Wedding of River Song\", BBC controller Zai Bennett announced the cancellation of the series as a cost-cutting measure.[6] Within 24 hours of the show being officially cancelled, pages on both Facebook and Twitter were established in an attempt to save it, both with links to an online petition that gained over 20,000 signatures within the same period,[7] and eventually garnered over 50,000.[8] People involved with the show such as writers Neil Gaiman (\"The Doctor's Wife\") and Tom MacRae (\"The Girl Who Waited\") expressed their concern with the axing of the programme,[9] as did lead actor Matt Smith.[8]\n\nOnline featurettes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, seventh series executive producer Caroline Skinner announced that smaller behind-the-scenes featurettes would be released on the BBC's Doctor Who website to make up for Confidential's cancellation.[10] The majority of these featurettes last for less than 5 minutes.\n\nSeries 7 (2012–2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Doctor Who (series 7)\n\nNo.TitleDoctor Who episodeOriginal air date1\"Steven Moffat: The Return of the Daleks\"\"Asylum of the Daleks\"29 August 2012 ( ) 2\"Life Cycle of a Dalek\"\"Asylum of the Daleks\"1 September 2012 ( ) 3\"Raptors, Robots and a Bumpy Ride\"\"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\"8 September 2012 ( ) 4\"Wild, Wild…Spain?\"\"A Town Called Mercy\"15 September 2012 ( ) 5\"A Writer's Tale\"\"The Power of Three\"22 September 2012 ( ) 6\"A Fall with Grace\"\"The Angels Take Manhattan\"29 September 2012 ( ) 7\"The Last Days of the Ponds\"\"The Angels Take Manhattan\"1 October 2012 ( ) 8\"Clara's First Christmas\"\"The Snowmen\"25 December 2012 ( ) 9\"Behind the Scenes of The Bells of Saint John\"\"The Bells of Saint John\"30 March 2013 ( ) 10\"Behind the Scenes of The Rings of Akhaten\"\"The Rings of Akhaten\"6 April 2013 ( ) 11\"Behind the Scenes of Cold War\"\"Cold War\"13 April 2013 ( ) 12\"Behind the Scenes of Hide\"\"Hide\"20 April 2013 ( ) 13\"Behind the Scenes of Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS\"\"Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS\"27 April 2013 ( ) 14\"Behind the Scenes of The Crimson Horror\"\"The Crimson Horror\"4 May 2013 ( ) 15\"Behind the Scenes of Nightmare in Silver\"\"Nightmare in Silver\"11 May 2013 ( ) 16\"Behind the Scenes of The Name of the Doctor\"\"The Name of the Doctor\"18 May 2013 ( )\n\nSpecials (2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Doctor Who (2013 specials)\n\nNo.TitleDoctor Who episodeOriginal air date1\"The Day of the Doctor: Behind the Lens\"\"The Day of the Doctor\"23 November 2013 ( ) 2\"Doctor Who: The Surprise – Paul McGann\"\"The Night of the Doctor\"4 December 2013 ( ) 3\"The Time of the Doctor: Behind the Lens\"\"The Time of the Doctor\"26 December 2013 ( )\n\nPost-cancellation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 20 August 2014, it was announced that a series of 10-minute behind-the-scenes featurettes would accompany the twelve episodes of the eighth series, under the title of Doctor Who Extra.[11] These featurettes were made available on the BBC's iPlayer and Red Button services.[11]\n\nDoctor Who: Unleashed was officially announced in September 2023, and follows every new episode of Doctor Who, starting with the 60th anniversary specials in 30 minute episodes on BBC Three, hosted by Newsbeat presenter Steffan Powell.[12]\n\nOther shows in Confidential format\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the popularity of Doctor Who Confidential, Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood was produced with its own set of backstage documentaries entitled Torchwood Declassified. The BBC also broadcast Heroes Unmasked in the same format, narrated by Anthony Head, to complement the NBC series Heroes on BBC Two, Merlin: Secrets and Magic, narrated by Greg James, to accompany the second series of the BBC One Drama Merlin, and Greek Uncovered, narrated by Fearne Cotton, for the comedy drama Greek when it was shown on BBC Three.
