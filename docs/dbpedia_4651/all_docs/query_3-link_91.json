        "text": "Tomas Thomas\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n10 min read\n\n·\n\nAug 8, 2021\n\n--\n\nLet’s just make it clear: It’s a crazy way to make television.\n\nI’ve only every convinced my friends to watch a black-and-white episode of Doctor Who once.\n\nIt was the first two episodes of An Unearthly Child. It was a lovely night, the four of us in the lounge, sitting in the dark, the images being the sole source of illumination. And they did enjoy it. The cavemen business tried their patience but a pleasant evening was had. However, any further attempts for the four of us to watch the remaining 251 black-and-white episodes have not been successful.\n\nI mean, we all blame our lives for that. It’s hard enough to catch-up for the sake of catching-up, juggling the spinning plates that is work, children, and living on different sides of the country.\n\nBut let’s be honest: There’s a lot of things that my friends — empathic, open-minded, curious lot that they are — would rather do with me than watch cavemen argue slowly. When the oldest films we tend to watch come from the 1980s… Well, poor measly, low-budget sci-fi from before the moon landings don’t really stand a chance.\n\nAs much as I think 1960s Doctor Who needs no adjusting — the optimism about humans living on moonbases, or the odd failed rival of the Daleks are endearing rather than off-putting — it perhaps does need explaining. It’s archival television nature extends more than the fact it is in black and white and is occasionally fuzzy: It’s entire DNA comes out of how television was produced in 1960s Britain.\n\nImportantly, these shows were meant to be broadcast exactly once and never to be seen again. But because we are breaking that unspoken contract, these defenceless collection of episodes need some support. So, let’s offer some sympathies and forgiveness by quickly summarising how they got made, how it shows, and why that is.\n\nMaking the Show\n\nNever mind spaceships, sometimes the show can’t do outside convincingly.\n\nIndeed, we can see the wind blow the leaves of the trees as the First Doctor strolls the countryside in The Reign of Terror and be convinced: the Doctor is definitely in the countryside. Yet, the view from the top of the pyramid in The Aztecs seems to suggest that the entire ground is at an interesting incline, and that there’s at least two suns.\n\nThese are quirks of how television was produced in Britain in the 1960s. To fully explain this, it needs to be acknowledged that the way of making television now is very different and more in step with feature films. Nowadays, if the story has several corridor scenes, those scenes get recorded. All the scenes set in the kitchen get recorded on the same set. Then the production moves on to all the scenes in the lounge room.\n\nThe difference is that the BBC was producing programs either live or “as live”. As such, television was produced more like theatre. You would record your kitchen scene, then your scene in the lounge room, and then go back to the kitchen.\n\nTo get a sense of how this worked, examine this colour overhead shot of “The Destruction of Time” (the final episode of The Dalek’s Master Plan)\n\nAll the sets needed for the episode are built in the studio. A recording of a Doctor Who episode would take 75 minutes to record one 25-minute episode.\n\n10:30 — Camera rehearsals begin. This is the first time the crew would see the camera scripts, detailing where each camera needed to be. This is because televisions productions were multi-camera events. They would rehearse moving from one set to the other, making sure not to get their wires crossed.\n\n1:00–2:00 Lunch break\n\n3:45–4:15 Tea break (occasionally, this time would be used for the BBC or for newspaper press to take images.)\n\n7:00–8:00 Dinner break\n\n8:00–8:30 Technical line-up (ensuring the cameras were each recording the same brightness, contrast, etc.)\n\n8:30–9:45 Recording begins. The aim is to finish by 10:00 — beyond that, directors risked unbudgeted overtime (if the union representatives even allowed such overtime to happen)\n\nThis method seems insane to us now, where television is recorded in much the same way as film: out of sequence, opportunity for retakes, shooting days based on actor and location availability, etc. However, the process used was borne out of the tradition of live broadcast dramas, something the BBC was still doing at this time. This process was itself, in terms of approach, informed by theatrical traditions.\n\nYet, for those watching early Doctor Who, it’s perhaps important to be aware of that. Recording something “as live” in 75 minutes was a challenge. An extra factor to this was a hesitation to do retakes. The shots of each of the cameras were seen by the director who was upstairs in the gallery (directors were rarely on the floor during the recording, speaking through the production manager) where the vision mixer would select each cameras’ outputs that would go on the master videotape. This is what would be broadcast (it’s perhaps worth pointing out, that even the titles and credits were recorded on this day rather than added in after. A camera would be positioned in front of a projection. Hence, every title sequence in 1960s Doctor Who is a lower quality than the actual episode. This has been corrected through remastering on the DVDs. In fact, in some cases, the end credits for the episodes are remade for the DVD release.)\n\nThis videotape could NOT be recorded over. In order to wipe it, it needed an electromagnetic eraser, something the videotape would only encounter after the episode had been broadcast. This meant, that if a retake was needed, the videotape would have to be physically sliced and the offending portion removed.\n\nThe whole point of using videotape was that it could be re-used.\n\nStep One: Record an episode\n\nStep Two: Broadcast the episode\n\nStep three: Wipe the videotape to be re-used.\n\nOf course, if the tape had been spliced to many times, there was a risk of the tape being unworkable. Videotapes were expensive, and if they needed to be replaced, it would come out of the budget of the offending program. Just like overtime payments, producers didn’t budget for these replacements (Doctor Who was simply unable too, as well. The program was frequently overspending and the BBC was learning that a science-fiction adventure serial was costing more than they originally thought).\n\n(Also, some of you might question the idea of the tape being wiped. Yes, that means the actual master tape was erased. Yes, that means that the master tapes for many episodes of Doctor Who were wiped, as in, they no longer exist! But let’s put that to one side for a moment; we’ll get to the interesting relationship between Doctor Who and the BBC archive some other time.)\n\nYou Know Your Watching Old Doctor Who When…\n\nThis style of working led to some peculiarities, all which are present in Doctor Who’s first season. In particular, the examples below can all be seen in The Sensorites:\n\n· Actors getting their lines wrong: While William Hartnell, the actor who played the Doctor is infamous for this, he’s not the only one to do it though.\n\nHere’s Clive Doig, a vision mixer for many of Hartnell’s episodes describing the impact:\n\n· Voices off-screen being heard: William Hartnell can be heard coughing off-screen in the fifth episode. In the sixth episode, the sound of the Production Assistant calling the camera shots can be heard (For myself, this is something I can only hear once it’s been pointed out to me. Nonetheless, it was considered enough of an issue that The Sensorites’ first commercial release on VHS in 2002 actually cut the scene where it occurs)\n\n· Sounds not being heard: An example from The Sensorites: “Ssh!” demands the Doctor in episode one, “What’s the noise?”. “Yes,” Captain Maitland acknowledges, “We always hear that.” BUT THERE’S NO NOISE! This is because music and sound effects were played live in the studio. Obviously, there was an issue with the grams operator at this moment. The music being played live is also an interesting idea: It was timed based on approximate times for action and sometimes it’s off.\n\n· Props and sets not working: There’s a door in the second episode that is pretty uncooperative at the whole futuristic sliding open business.\n\n· Peculiar continuity errors: These aren’t drastic by any means and a lot of them wouldn’t even be noticed. I’m talking here about the differences between one week’s episode and the next. For example, take the episode one cliff-hanger on the left: the first appearance of a Sensorite! There is a significant difference in blocking, lighting, and the body language of the Sensorite actor.\n\n· Actors leaving the story: It happens in The Sensorites. Episodes four and five do not feature Barbara. That’s because actress Jacqueline Hill gets two weeks off for a holiday. After all, Doctor Who was in production essentially all year round. William Hartnell had his two weeks first, disappearing from the plot in The Keys of Marinus. Carole Ann Ford (who plays Susan) and William Russell (who plays Ian) do it slightly differently when it’s their turn. In these stories (The Aztecs and The Reign of Terror, respectively) they get sidelined for two episodes, having minor roles entirely on one set. This is because their scenes were pre-filmed using actual film. On the recording day, they would be absent and instead, a camera would be aimed at a projection of this film.\n\n· Pacing and padding: With the multi-camera set-up, all the sets had to made in studio. Thus, scenes take place in a relatively few locations each episode requiring less sets to be built (remember that they were recording “as live”, so there was no time to pull down sets and erect new ones). This also means that scenes exist to enable actors from one set to get to another. For example: in the third episode, the Doctor, Ian and Susan prepare to leave the spaceship and visit the Sense-Sphere. They say this, and we cut to a scene of political intrigue on the Sense-Sphere before the Doctor, Ian and Susan turn up. It looks like part of the story — and it is — but it’s structured like that for filming purposes. There’s a similar sequence where the Doctor and friends realise that there’s a traitor amongst the Sensorites and head to the city. We would expect the next scene to be them following their investigation, but it’s not, because they need time to get to the city sets.\n\n· We also get Hartnell’s style of acting. He’s standard pose is him holding his lapels. It’s often impersonated by fans (indeed, it was mimicked by Peter Capaldi in 2013 when he was announced as the Doctor). But there’s a reason behind it: It’s too make sure his hands are seen in a close-up as the close-up is going to be the camera moving towards him more often than not (there’s a sequence in the first episode where the camera zooms into Hartnell and the camera bumps slightly when it hits the control panel in front of him). Indeed, once you know this, you almost begin looking for it."
