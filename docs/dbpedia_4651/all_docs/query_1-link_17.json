        "text": "What is a nephrologist, otolaryngologist or physiatrist? You’re not the only one who’s stumped. If you ever find yourself confused and relying on Google to get a description of a specialist you need to see, read on. Doctors specialize—and sub-specialize—in certain areas of the body and in treating specific conditions. Depending on your health plan, you might not even need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist.\n\nIf you find some of these specialty names hard to decode (and pronounce), it’s not surprising—often medical terms are derived from Greek and Latin. “Patients should not feel embarrassed if they don't know the names of all of the different medical specialties and subspecialties or even how to pronounce them,” says Michael Lerner, MD, a Yale Medicine laryngologist (translation: voice and swallowing doctor).\n\nHe explains that when doctors specialize, it means they have completed several additional years of specialized training after finishing up their general medicine training.\n\n“Specialists are trained to diagnose and treat the more complex and sometimes more nuanced problems in medicine,” says Dr. Lerner. “While not everyone needs to see a specialist, it's important to know that they are available for consultation if you need them.”\n\nMeet 15 specialists you might not know, and learn some interesting facts about what these doctors can do for you, too:\n\nThis is a doctor who diagnoses and treats diseases associated with the gallbladder, pancreas and liver. They treat acute or chronic liver disease, ranging from fatty liver disease to cirrhosis to liver cancer. Both a hepatologist and a gastroenterologist can help diagnose and treat liver disease.\n\nChronic liver diseases are on the rise, as is liver cancer. \"However, there is lot that can be done today if you have liver disease as many of these conditions are now treatable and also preventable,\" says Mario Strazzabosco, MD, a hepatologist who is also the deputy director of Yale Medicine's Liver Cancer Program. \"Working in collaboration with your primary care physician, a hepatologist can help you preserve the health of your liver by identifying risk factors and counseling you on how to keep your liver healthy and happy.\"\n\n\"Interventional radiologists are experts at shutting down blood flow to body parts when it is not wanted,\" says Raj Ayyagari, MD, a Yale Medicine interventional radiologist. “When a patient has internal bleeding from trauma to a body part such as the liver, kidney, or spleen or a pelvic fracture, interventional radiology doctors perform embolization procedures that involve plugging up the bleeding vessels.” These doctors also can reopen blood vessels that have shut down abnormally due to narrowing of the arteries or blood clots to the legs or lungs, for example.\n\nIn addition, they embolize malignant tumors in the liver and kidneys, explains Kevin Kim, MD, director of Smilow Interventional Oncology, as well as benign overgrowths of organs like the prostate and uterus to shrink them back down to normal size. These doctors use X-rays, ultrasounds, MRIs and CT scanners to guide many procedures throughout the body—from head to toe."
