        "text": "Surprise Medical Bills and Emergency Services\n\nConsumers in New York are protected from surprise bills when treated by an out-of-network provider at a participating hospital or ambulatory surgical center in their health plan’s network. Additionally, consumers with health insurance coverage provided by an insurer or HMO are protected from surprise bills when a participating doctor refers them to a non-participating provider. Consumers in New York are also protected from bills for emergency services in hospitals, including inpatient care following emergency room treatment.\n\nLearn more about Consumer Protections Under the No Surprises Act\n\nThe following information explains what you need to know about these important protections if:\n\nyou have coverage with an HMO or insurer subject to New York law\n\nyou are uninsured or your employer or union provides self-insured coverage that is not subject to New York law\n\nyou are a health care provider.\n\nInformation Your Doctor and Other Health Care Professionals Must Give You\n\nInformation Your Hospital Must Give You\n\nHow to Protect Yourself from a Surprise Medical Bill\n\nIf You Have Health Insurance Coverage Subject To NY Law – (your health insurance ID card says “fully insured”)\n\nSurprise bills happen when an out-of-network provider treats you at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center OR you are referred by an in-network doctor to an out-of-network provider. (In-network means in your health plan’s network.) You only have to pay your in-network cost-sharing for a surprise bill.\n\nIt’s A Surprise Bill At An In-Network Hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center if an Out-of-Network Provider Treats You and:\n\nAn in-network provider was not available; OR\n\nAn out-of-network provider provided services without your knowledge; OR\n\nUnforeseen medical services were provided when you received health care services.\n\nIt is NOT a surprise bill if you chose to receive services from an out-of-network provider instead of from an available in-network provider before you got to the hospital or ambulatory surgical center.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the following services will usually be a surprise bill when provided by an out-of-network provider in a hospital or ambulatory surgical center: emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services.\n\nIf your health care services were before January 1, 2022, you are only protected from a surprise bill if you were treated by an out-of-network physician (and not other health care providers) at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center.\n\nIt’s a Surprise Bill When Your In-Network Doctor Refers You to an Out-of-Network Provider if:\n\nYou did not sign a written consent that you knew the services were out-of-network and would not be covered by your health plan; AND\n\nDuring a visit with your participating doctor, a non-participating provider treats you; OR\n\nYour in-network doctor takes a specimen from you in the office (for example, blood) and sends it to an out-of-network laboratory or pathologist; OR\n\nFor any other health care services when referrals are required under your plan.\n\nIf You Get a Surprise Bill Because An Out-of-Network Provider Treats You At An In-Network Hospital Or Ambulatory Surgical Center OR Your Doctor Refers You To An Out-of-Network Provider:\n\nYou only have to pay your in-network cost-sharing.\n\nIf an out-of-network provider bills you for any amount over your in-network cost-sharing (copayment, coinsurance, or deductible) this is called balance-billing.\n\nIf your doctor referred you to an out-of-network provider, you MUST send a Surprise Bill Certification Form to your health plan and your provider to make sure that they know you received a Surprise Bill and that you must be protected from balance billing.\n\nIf an out-of-network provider treats you at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical facility, you MUST send a Surprise Bill Certification Form to your health plan and your provider if you received the health care services before January 1, 2022 to make sure that they know you received a Surprise Bill and that you must be protected from balance billing. The form is not required for services provided after January 1, 2022 at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical facility, but it is recommended.\n\nYou may also file a complaint with DFS.\n\nIf You Have Employer/Union Self-Funded Coverage (your health insurance ID card says “self-funded” or does not say “fully insured”)\n\nThe Federal No Surprises Act protections from surprise medical bills from an out-of-network provider in an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center apply if your employer or union self-funds your coverage for plans issued or renewed on and after January 1, 2022.\n\nYou are only responsible for paying your in-network cost-sharing (copayment, coinsurance, or deductible) for a surprise bill.\n\nFor more information about the Federal consumer protections, visit the CMS No Surprises Act website.\n\nFor plans issued or renewed before January 1, 2022, you may qualify for an independent dispute resolution (IDR) through New York State by submitting an IDR application to dispute the bill. To be eligible, services must be provided by a doctor at a hospital or ambulatory surgical center and you aren’t given all the required information about your care.

You have to ask for the review within 120 days of getting the bill. An independent reviewer will look at the good faith estimate, the bill, and information from the provider to decide the amount, if any, that you have to pay for each service.\n\nYou can use the Federal patient-provider dispute resolution process starting in 2022 for billing disputes with the provider that scheduled the service for you.

Notice done on the day of the services does not give the patient a meaningful opportunity to choose an in-network provider.\n\nIt will not be surprise bill when the patient signs the standard written notice and consent form. However, surprise bill protections will typically apply to emergency medicine, anesthesiology, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, and intensivist services (even if the patient receives written notice that you are an out-of-network provider and gives written consent.)\n\nIt will not be a surprise bill if the out-of-network service was preauthorized in advance and the patient received notice that the service was out-of-network and other disclosures required by the Insurance Law, like the amount the health plan would pay for the service.\n\n(*If health care services were before January 1, 2022, the surprise bill protections only apply to the services of out-of-network physicians (and not other health care providers) at an in-network hospital or ambulatory surgical center.)\n\nA Bill For Services Referred By An In-Network Doctor To An Out-of-Network Provider Is A Surprise Bill If:\n\nYour patient did not sign a written consent acknowledging that the services would be out-of-network and would result in costs not covered by the patient's health plan AND (1) During a visit with an in-network doctor, an out-of-network provider treats the patient; or (2) The patient's in-network doctor takes a specimen from the patient in the office (for example, blood) and sends it to an out-of-network laboratory or pathologist; or (3) For any other health care services when referrals are required under the patient's plan.\n\nSurprise Bill Certification Form.

Once you submit the IDR, you will receive an IDR case number:\n\nDFS Portal\n\nOnce you have the case number:\n\nfill out the IDR Provider and Insurer Application AND\n\nsend the application to the assigned Independent Dispute Resolution Entity.\n\nReview Of Disputes By Independent Dispute Resolution Entity (IDRE)\n\nIDR Entity Reviews. Disputes are reviewed by independent dispute resolution entities (IDREs). Decisions will be made by a reviewer with training and experience in health care billing and reimbursement in consultation with a licensed physician in active practice in the same or similar specialty as the physician providing the service that is the subject of the dispute.\n\n30 Day Timeframe. The IDRE will make a determination within 30 days of receipt of the dispute. Parties to the dispute must submit all necessary information with their IDR application and immediately when contacted by the IDRE, or the information will not be considered.\n\nIDRE Determines The Fee. For disputes involving health plans, the IDRE chooses either the out-of-network provider’s bill or the health plan’s payment. For disputes submitted by uninsured patients, the IDRE determines the fee.\n\nIDRE Considers These Factors When Making a Determination:\n\nWhether there is a gross disparity between the fee charged by the provider and (1) fees paid to the provider for the same services provided to other patients in health care plans in which the provider is out-of-network, and (2) the fees paid by the health plan to reimburse similarly qualified out-of-network providers for the same services in the same region;\n\nThe provider's training, education, experience, and usual charge for comparable services when the provider does not participate with the patient's health plan;\n\nIn the case of a hospital, the teaching status, scope of services, and case mix;\n\nThe circumstances and complexity of the case;\n\nPatient characteristics; and\n\nFor physician services, the usual and customary cost of the service.\n\nIDRE may direct a good faith negotiation for settlement. In cases when settlement is likely, or if the health plan's payment and the provider's fee are unreasonably far apart, the IDRE may direct the parties to negotiate.\n\nReview is Binding. The review is binding but admissible in court.\n\nPayment For Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR)\n\nDisputes Between a Provider and a Health Plan, Involving an Insured Patient.\n\nProvider pays the cost of the dispute resolution when the IDRE determines that the health plan's payment is reasonable.\n\nHealth plan pays the cost of the dispute resolution when the IDRE determines that the provider's fee is reasonable.\n\nProvider and the health plan share the prorated cost when there is a settlement.\n\nThere may be a minimal fee to the provider or health plan submitting the dispute if the dispute is found ineligible or incomplete.\n\nDisputes involving an Uninsured Patient.\n\nThe provider pays the cost of the dispute resolution when the IDRE determines that the provider’s fee is not reasonable.\n\nThe patient pays the cost of the dispute resolution when the IDRE determines that provider’s fee is reasonable, unless it would pose a hardship to the patient. \"Hardship\" means a household income below 250% of the Federal Poverty Level.\n\nQuestions About IDR\n\nIf you have questions about IDR, or need help completing an application, call (800) 342-3736 or email [email protected]. Where applicable, please indicate the date(s) of service in your inquiry as different laws and processes may apply depending on when you received the services.\n\nQuestions About Becoming a Certified IDRE"
