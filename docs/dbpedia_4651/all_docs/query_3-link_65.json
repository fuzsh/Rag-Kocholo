        "text": "I love that, after sixty years, Doctor Who is still inspiring so much creative fandom. New generations of fans come to the show, explore its history, have their imaginations fired up, and go on to create their own stories. Some of these stories go on to inspire other fans; some writers will even go on to create official Doctor Who. It's all rather wonderful. Admittedly, it's a bit strange for me to see a book full of authors and artists going by their online handles, but then, pseudonyms have a long history and, well, I guess I'm getting old.\n\nThe History Between Us is a collection of stories featuring the Doctor and the Master, from the 77 Years Team. This group previously published 77 Years itself, exploring the Dhawan Master's accidental exile alluded to in Spyfall (I've now bought the digital edition of this, so expect another review in the future). This volume, which I picked up on the reprint for the 60th anniversary and have finally had time to sit down and read properly, is more expansive, covering the two Time Lords' lives from their childhood on Gallifrey to their most recent run-in on TV, and beyond.\n\nFanthologies are nothing new, and nor is fiction exploring the relationship between the Doctor and the Master. Even the idea that they were once a couple, whose love has turned to an intense enmity that they've dragged out across time and space, isn't without precedent. Forcing them to sit down and talk to a marriage counsellor, though – that's a stroke of genius.\n\nThe first thing you notice when you pick up this book is just how gorgeous it is. Kris Merola's cover is absolutely stunning, and only the first of a selection of incredible illustrations in an array of styles. Then, of course, we have the stories themselves – one for each main Doctor, plus a framing story and an extra story at the very end, set some time in the future. (I won't reveal which Doctor and Master this one features, but they may have recently been brought into TV canon.) The stories explore their relationship and its fluctuating levels of friendship and enmity across the centuries. Any romance is included with a lightness of touch – the more intimate details of their relationship is kept to background and inference.\n\nThere's a very high standard to the writing here. Every story is strong, with the best being really quite excellent. I have some particular favourites. “On the Contrary Nature of Temporal Exobiology” by Ana M. explores the first meeting and growing friendship between the charismatic Koschei and the awkward Theta at the Academy. “Doctor Who and the Vortex Bloom” by Fennric explores the Third Doctor's life in exile, including the nature of his prisoner tattoo (in reality, Jon Pertwee's tattoo from his time in the Royal Navy, which has caused no end of fan debate). The story has a spot-on portrayal of the affectionate rivalry between the Third Doctor and the Delgado Master (and it's nice to see someone remember that sometimes the Three discarded his fancy clothes and got down to a T-shirt and jeans).\n\n“Taphonomia” by Soph features the Fourth Doctor and “Crispy” Master, on his last legs and desperate. It's a subtly chilling story with a touch of horror. Sariane's Fifth Doctor story “The Wandering Mind” is a fascinating exploration of the Doctor's subconscious. “Nothing but Time” by Red brings the Eighth Doctor and the War Master together, in a tremendously fun, time-twisting tale that handles the tricky business of fitting in with TV continuity better than Big Finish usually manages. The highlight of the modern Doctor-Master pairs is “Not a Vessel for Your Good Intent” by Jay, a thoughtful exploration of the Missy's imprisonment and the reasons she and the Doctor are going through with it.\n\nWhile these were the stand-out entries for me, every story presents an intriguing take on the Doctor and the Master. Of course, not every Doctor met the Master on TV, and while most of their respective incarnations meet in order, there are some unexpected pairings. A truly masterful collection."
