        "text": "“Jeremy A. Greene is the foremost medical griot of our time! In this extraordinary book, Greene combines his skills as an historian, medical practitioner, and gifted storyteller, probing the long arc of medical innovation with exquisite detail without losing sight of the urgent and overarching stakes that plague healthcare today. Wide-ranging and deeply researched, The Doctor Who Wasn’t There is a history of forgetfulness when it comes to the many tech fixes that have promised better care, more profit, and greater equity in medicine. From telephones to artificial intelligence, this book reveals how what was once considered subversive becomes mundane and taken for granted. But with Greene as our guide, we see that this process is not neutral or inevitable. Instead, this book reveals how the media of medical care are shaped by powerful and often competing interests, which we can and should question. The Doctor Who Wasn’t There is a powerful reminder that tech-driven dreams of democratizing healthcare will come to naught if we do not invest in the social and political foundations of democracy itself.”\n\nRuha Benjamin, Princeton University, author of \"Race after Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code\" and \"Viral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want\"\n\n“Greene’s book brilliantly examines the promises and pitfalls of telemedicine for health access, equity, and the making of new digital divides. A masterful study of past, present, and future medicine, and of how communications technologies that have offered so much for equalizing health—radio, television, and computerization—have also run into logistical challenges, economic constraints, ethical worries, failures of political will, and convenient forgetting on the road to promised health equity. A superb analysis, Greene’s book will be widely read. It is packed with trenchant insights on new communications technologies, the promise and reality of how they shape healthcare, and the challenge of marrying such innovations to the promise of health equity.”\n\nKeith Wailoo, Princeton University, author of \"Pushing Cool: Big Tobacco, Racial Marketing, and the Untold Story of the Menthol Cigarette\""
