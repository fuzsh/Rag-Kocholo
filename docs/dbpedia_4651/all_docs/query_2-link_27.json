        "text": "A referral is a letter from your doctor or health professional to another health professional or health service. Referrals are made to get expert help with the diagnosis or treatment of your health problem.\n\nMost referral letters are written by your family doctor (general practitioner, or GP). Referrals can be made to:\n\na specialist doctor\n\nan allied health professional, such as a psychologist or physiotherapist\n\nradiology, for x-rays or other imaging services\n\npathology services (for blood tests)\n\nWho can make a referral?\n\nReferrals can be made by health professionals such as:\n\ndoctors\n\ndentists\n\nnurse practitioners\n\nmidwives\n\nphysiotherapists\n\noptometrists\n\npsychologists\n\nWhat information does a specialist referral include?\n\nYour referral should include:\n\nup-to-date information about your health issue\n\nthe date of the referral\n\nthe reason for the referral\n\nthe name, contact details and signature of the person writing the referral\n\nYou can choose which specialist you want to be referred to. You can also ask your doctor to recommend someone.\n\nYour doctor can address the referral to a particular person. Sometimes they can make a general referral â€” this is when they write the referral without using the name of a particular specialist. An example would be writing 'Dear psychiatrist' instead of a name.\n\nHow do I get a referral?\n\nMake an appointment with your doctor to talk about your health issues. You can ask your doctor to write you a referral. They will be able to advise you on which type of specialist you need to see.\n\nHow much will it cost to see the specialist?\n\nIf you have a referral, Medicare should cover at least part of the cost of further tests or treatment advice.\n\nIt's always a good idea to ask the cost when you book your appointment.\n\nIf you have private health insurance, this may cover some of your costs, depending on what your referral is for. Private health insurance does not cover:\n\nvisits with specialists in their rooms\n\nimaging and tests to diagnose a condition\n\nIt's best to check with your insurance company to see what they will cover.\n\nWhat happens if you visit a specialist without a referral?\n\nMany specialists will still see you, although some might not. Medicare will not cover any costs if you visit a specialist without a referral.\n\nHow long does a referral last?\n\nMost referrals from GPs to specialists last for 12 months. This amount of time should cover a single course of treatment for your health condition. The referral covers all of your visits to the specialist for that condition.\n\nSome people need longer-term care, such as for chronic (ongoing) health conditions. In these cases, your GP can write a referral beyond 12 months. They could also write the referral with no end date.\n\nIf you develop a new health issue, you will need a new referral.\n\nSometimes a specialist may want to refer you to another specialist. These referrals are usually limited to 3 months.\n\nSharing information and privacy\n\nYour referring doctor or health professional will give the specialist information about you and your health condition.\n\nThe specialist that you see will send back details of your treatments and their advice to your doctor. All your medical information is private and confidential.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with this, talk to your referring doctor or health professional.\n\nHow do I get a second opinion?\n\nSometimes you may be unhappy with a diagnosis or feel there might be better treatment choices. Do not be afraid to ask your doctor to refer you to another specialist for a second opinion.\n\nA second opinion can help you have peace of mind or give you another point of view. You have the right to ask for as many opinions or referrals as you want.\n\nResources and support\n\nThere is more information on referrals at Services Australia.\n\nYou can also call the healthdirect helpline on 1800 022 222 (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria). A registered nurse is available to speak with 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
