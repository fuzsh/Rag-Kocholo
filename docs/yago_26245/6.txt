She was married in 1380 at the age of 15 to Infante John, Duke of Girona, the heir to the throne of Aragon, thus becoming Duchess of Girona and Countess of Cervera..

Her husband became King John I of Aragon in 1387. He was often ill, and Violante wielded considerable administrative power on his behalf. She transformed the Aragonese court into a center of French culture. She especially cultivated the talents of Provençal troubadours (poet-musicians).

Family troubles sometimes got in the way for John and Violante. John and his brother, Martin of Aragon, had never agreed on the father Peter marrying Sibila of Fortia, for the marriage could cause dynastic problems that could imperil their rights in the line of succession.

Sibila had two sons with Peter but both did not survive to adulthood. They had a surviving daughter, Isabella; John had her married off to James II of Urgell. After Peter's death, Sibila was placed under house arrest in Barcelona, where she stayed for the rest of her days. Sibila was treated with respect, but she was kept under close surveillance.

John and Violant had six children, but only one daughter, Yolande lived to adulthood.
