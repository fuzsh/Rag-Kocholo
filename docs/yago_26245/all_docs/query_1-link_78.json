        "text": "Spanish History:\n\nMaria de Luna (1358 – 1406)\n\nMaria de Luna was known as “La Grande” (The Great), and is regarded as one of the most notable queens of the Crown of Aragon. She was politically active and exerted influence upon society and policy, and was considered to exceed King Martin the Humane as a ruler. She was the eldest daughter of the Aragonese noble Lope, Count of Luna and Lord of Segorbe, and the Provençal noblewoman Brianda d’Agout. Her father was a favorite of King Peter IV the Ceremonious, and one of the wealthiest and most esteemed magnates of the Kingdom. When the Count of Luna died in 1360, Maria inherited her father’s estates. A circunstance that would quickly draw her into the royal family.\n\nWhen Maria was four or five years old, she was brought to the royal court of her future husband, infant Martin, Duke of Montblanc, the second son of Peter IV of Aragon and Eleanor of Sicily, where she was mentored by her mother-in-law, who wielded considerable authority in her husband’s reign, and who served as Maria’s model for a good and useful queen. Maria and Martin spent their childhood together, growing up as near siblings, along with the other royal children. The couple married in Barcelona on 13 June 1372. She was probably fourteen, and he a year older. Together they had four children, only one (Martin the Younger) survived to adulthood. From the very beginning Maria acted as an independent seigneur and administered her own estates.\n\nFrom 1392, the Duke of Montblanc was in Sicily helping his son claim the kingdom he gained by marriage. Martin the Younger was married to Queen Maria of Sicily. Maria de Luna supported both her husband and her son with stable management and valuable economic resources. In 1396 the Duke of Montblanc succeeded his elder brother King John I, who had died sonless, on the throne of the Crown of Aragon. When not having put end to the Sicilian insurrection the new king had to delay his return to the Iberian Peninsula. Maria de Luna assume power in the Crown of Aragon as her husband’s lieutenant. She adroitly protected her husband’s claim, and her son’s inheritance. Maria energetically quelled opposition to Martín’s rule, facing down the claims of the Queen dowager, Violant of Bar, and the king’s bellicose relatives, the Foix.\n\nViolant of Bar announced that waited a son of the deceased king, who would be his legitimate heir. Maria assigned a guard of four noble ladies, all widows of the highest standing, to watch over Violant. She instructing them not to let Violant stray from their presence for even one minute, until it could be ascertained whether her pregnancy was genuine or not. For more than five months, they maintained a strict vigil over the widow. Finally, the passing of time revealed that the pregnancy, if it was genuine, would not result in the birth of a child. Count Mathieu of Foix, who for his marriage with Joanna of Aragon, eldest daughter of King John I and his first wife Mata d’Armagnac, alleged his rights to the Aragonese throne. Maria de Luna successfully warded off an invasion by the Count of Foix. She held the crown safe for her husband until his return in 1397.\n\nMaria de Luna remained active in government even after King Martin’s return. She served as Queen-lieutenant in 1396-7 and 1401. She was simultaneously a generous wife and mother, pious patron, diplomatic intercessor, and a tough-minded governing partner and shrewd, strategic lieutenant-general. She was an intelligent ruler, highly skilled in the subtleties of governance; historians agree that Maria de Luna was both “steadfast and astute”.\n\nShe supported the poor financially, handled taxes, protected Jews and Muslims, aspired to stop the wars between noble clans, including her own family, fostered good relations with England, and wrote to her relative Pope Benedict XIII to suggest bans toward laws and practises she saw as injustice, like the customary abuses that secular lords could heap upon their peasants. Maria’s actions served as precedent for later settlements in the 1460s and 1480s. In the arena of her court, she constructed a carefully orchestrated world of luxury and ceremony that bore her distinctive mark.\n\nQueen Maria was an active proponent of arts and culture. She was interested in music and literature. She commissioned the writing of some books. Her religious patronage was significant. She was responsible, for example, for bringing the Observant Franciscan movement to the Iberian Peninsula when she founded the convent of Sancti Spiritus in 1402 outside the town of Sagunt. Secular patronage was also deeply connected to Maria’s practices of kinship. As the head of the Luna family, Maria certainly played favorites, helping her reckless sister Brianda, as well as making good use of her family connections whether in the service of her politics or her piety. The queen did not enjoy good health. Rheumatism and headaches embittered many of her days. Maria de Luna died of a stroke during a travel to Valencia in 1406.\n\nSources:\n\nShell Games: Studies in Scams, Frauds, and Deceits (1300-1650) by Margaret Reeves,Richard Raiswell,Mark Crane\n\nhttps://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/tmr/article/view/16749/22867\n\nhttp://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1829&context=mff"
