        "text": "The thirteenth century was a transformative period for Western European monarchies, which experienced the development of institutions and an increasing bureaucratisation of their administrative systems. During this time in Castile, the queen’s establishment began to be recognised as progressively differentiated from the king’s own household. This study examines the composition and structure of the Castilian queen’s household in the thirteenth century through two case studies: the households of Juana of Ponthieu (r.1237-1252), wife of Fernando III; and Violante of Aragon (r.1252-1284), wife of Alfonso X. It draws upon the references to their personnel contained in the repartimientos, the grants of land that followed the conquest of new territories in the Southern Iberian Peninsula. This approach demonstrates that the examination of well-known sources through the lens of queenship provides important new insights into the personnel and households of thirteenth-century queens consort. This article argues that, during the thirteenth century, the queen’s household constituted a space of connection which linked together people from diverse origins, kingdoms, and backgrounds; and provided the queen with a sphere of influence, through which she could exercise her largesse and patronage.\n\nIn May 1561, King Philip II informed the town hall of Madrid that he had chosen their town as the site for his royal residence and court. That year, the city was swiftly transformed into the Catholic king’s court and the heart of his vast monarchy. It also became the principal political and cultural space for the nobility. Yet the greatest noble houses, particularly those in Castile, were initially resistant to the establishment of a sedentary royal court and continued to exercise and represent their status at their own traditional courts. Increasingly, however, they were obliged to reside in Madrid in order to ensure direct access to the king’s grace and favour. Throughout the seventeenth century, the Spanish aristocracy became courtiers through necessity rather than conviction. In response to this situation, and without neglecting their noble estates and interests, they created their own spaces at court, and over time were able to colonize the royal capital and convert it into their own natural habitat.\n\nThe analysis of land management, lineage and family through the case study of early modern Spanish nobility from sixteenth to early nineteenth century is a major issue in recent historiography. It aims to shed light on how upper social classes arranged strategies to maintain their political and economic status. Rivalry and disputes between old factions and families were attached to the control and exercise of power. Blood, land management and honour were the main elements in these disputes. Honour, service to the Crown, participation in the conquest and ‘pure’ blood (Catholic affiliation) were the main features of Spanish nobility. This book analyses the origins of the entailed-estate (mayorazgo) from medieval times to early modern period, as the main element that enables us to understand the socio-economic behaviour of these families over generations. This longue durée chronology within the Braudelian methodology of the research aims to show how strategies and family networks changed over time, demonstrating a micro-history study of daily life.\n\nThis article discusses the social mobility strategies of the Teles de Meneses family throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, seeking to understand their influence on the family's social evolution and improved ranking at the court. Marriage policy and service in the Iberian courts are analyzed over three different generations and from two standpoints: first, the preservation of the family's pre-acquired status; second, the diversification of the services performed in the various settings where its influence could be exercised. This will highlight the reasons behind the social evolution of this family and the subsequent granting of titles to some of its members."
