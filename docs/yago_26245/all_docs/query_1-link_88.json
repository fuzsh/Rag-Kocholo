        "text": "“Era esta Infanta Doña Blanca a marauilla hermosa, y muy excelente Princesa, y aficionose al Rey en grá manera que casasse con ella el Rey su hijo […]”\n\nin Jerónimo Zurita y Castro, Anales de la Corona de Aragon, book X, ch. LXXIIII\n\nBlanca was born in Pamplona on July 6th 1387 (or 1385, according to other sources), the third child and daughter of King Carlos III of Navarre and Earl of Évreux, and his wife Leonor of Trastámara, infanta of Castile.\n\nThe first years of her life were quiet and eventless, but everything changed in 1401. That was the year the unfortunate Queen Maria I of Sicily died. Her marriage to Martino I of Sicily (born Martí of Aragon and called the Younger to differentiate him from his homonymous father) had been childless. Her now widowed husband, had succeeded her on the Sicilian throne, in virtue of their kinship (they were cousins). Without heirs, Martino needed urgently to remarry and Carlos of Navarre was among the many who proposed their daughters as possible future queens.\n\nMartino’s father, King Martí I of Aragon thought Blanca “molt bella et molt savia e endreçata et dotata de totes virtuts”(very beautiful and very wise and neat and endowed with all the virtues), far preferable than the daughters of Holy Roman Emperor Robert, of Charles VI of France or Henry IV of England.\n\nMarriages between the House of Aragon and that of Navarre had been pretty common since the Aragonese sovereigns aimed to annex Navarre to their territory. The first wife of King Pere IV of Aragon ( Martí of Aragon’s father) had been Maria of Navarre, one of Carlos’ aunts and, incidentally, Maria of Sicily’s maternal grandmother.\n\nOn the other hand, the future husband, the King of Sicily, felt more inclined towards Giovanna of Anjou-Durazzo (the future Queen Giovanna II), sister of Ladislao I of Naples and his heir presumptive (the King being without legitimate issue). By marrying Giovanna, Martino would have finally reunited Sicily and Naples (which had been divided since the Peace of Caltabellotta, which ended the War of the Sicilian Vespers) and ruled over the jointed kingdom, plus the marriage would have caused the rupture of the relationship between Naples and the duchy of Anjou (and consequently France), and the House of Habsburg since William of Habsburg Duke of Carinthia, Styria and Carniola, had already concluded “per verba de praesenti” the marriage talks between himself and Giovanna.\n\nConsidering the Navarrese option safer and less provocative, the King of Aragon accepted Carlos’ candidate and sent his emissaries to make arrangements for the future marriage. He did this behind his son’s back.\n\nOn November 1401, Juan Dez Vall was in Navarre to conclude the arrangements on behalf of the King of Aragon (and the oblivious King of Sicily). Blanca’s dowry consisted on 100.000 florins, 40.000 to be paid at the moment of the marriage, while the remaining amount consisted in the castles and towns of Arguedas, Santacara, Murillo del Fruto and Gallipienço. On the other hand, once arrived in Sicily, Blanca would have had at her disposal the vast territory pertaining the Camera Reginale, that since 1302 (on occasion of the marriage between Federico III of Sicily and Eleonora of Naples ), represented the traditional wedding present given to Sicilian Queen consorts. It will be abolished in 1537 and (though its extension changed with time) it pretty much consisted on the feuds of Paternò, Mineo, Vizzini, Castiglione di Sicilia, Francavilla di Sicilia, Siracusa, Lentini, Avola, the village of Santo Stefano di Briga, the island of Pantelleria, and its core was the Castle of Maniace in Siracusa. On February of the following year, Blanca left her country headed for Barcelona. It was only when the princess reached the Aragonese capital that Martí of Aragon made known to his son and the Sicilian court of his decision.\n\nAfter having obtained the papal dispensation from Antipope Benedict XIII, on account of the spouses’ family ties, on May 21st 1402 was ratified in Catania the union between Martino and Blanca. Leonel de Navarra, Ramon de Llupià-Bages, and Diego Vaquedano signed the document on behalf of the bride, currently in Valencia. Blanca set off directed to her new home in October and on November 26th she was finally wedded to Martino and crowned Queen of Sicily in Palermo Cathedral. The couple then left to reside in Catania.\n\nMarried life proved not to be sunshine and rainbows. If in a letter the King of Sicily wrote to his father he was grateful for the bride chosen for him (a “bella, bona e sàvia muller”, a beautiful, good and wise wife), in her correpondence with her father Blanca describes her union to be so unhappy the King of Navarre had to write to his co-parent-in-law about the hardship his daughter had to deal with in her new country. The birth of two natural children within the first year of the royal marriage (Federico, son of Catanese noblewoman Tarsia Rizzari, and Violante, daughter of another Catanese noblewoman, Agatuccia Pesce, and ancestor of Empress Eugenie of France) clearly showed that Martino wasn’t a faithful husband. In the meantime Blanca suffered from natural aborts and couldn’t get pregnant, and her husband affairs and the birth of the royal bastards made her feel more miserable. Finally, on December 19th 1406, she gave birth to the heir, Martino, like his frather and grandfather. Unfortunately for the couple, the child died of infection eight months later, on August 1407 and, once again, Martino I lost his legitimate heir and the succession to the Sicilian throne was definitely in danger.\n\nIn 1407 Mariano V Doria-de Serra Bas, Judge of Arborea (Sardinia), died of plague and without direct heirs, causing a succession crisis. The King of Aragon urged his son to take advantage of the political vacuum and seize the Sardinian Kingdom before the arrival of Guillaume II of Narbonne, cousin of the late Judge (their mothers were sisters) and his closest relative as well as heir. The House of Aragon had actually a claim over the Sardinian island. In 1297 Pope Boniface VIII through the papal edict Ad honorem Dei onnipotenti Patris had created the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica and had invested the then Jaime II of the ius invadendi (the right to invade the lands named in the edict). The Aragonese soon gave up on Corsica since they couldn’t snatch it from the Genoese, but even the control over Sardinia had been a pure nominal one. It’s no wonder then that the death of the heirless Mariano had been almost manna from heaven for the Aragonese King. When Martino of Sicily left to campaigning in Sardinia in 1408, he left Blanca to act as Regent in his absence. He had done the same when he went in Catalonia 1404 and stayed away for almost a year. During this time, on November 11th 1405, while she was staying in Paternò castle (which was part of the Camera reginale), Blanca had issued the so called Consuetudines Terre Paternionis, a system of customary laws. The document (one of the surviving copies was drawn up in Latin, the others are written in Vulgar, and signed La Reyna), consists of 87 articles about important issues, like protection of private property, hereditary succession, property relationship between spouses, the right of first refusal, etc. This meant that disputes concerning these issues were now more easily solved, because now the interested parties (mainly the landowners) could refer to actual written laws that entailed sanctions in case of violation.\n\nAt that time Blanca did such a good job, her husband didn’t think twice before trusting her a second time. Before leaving headed for Sardinia, Martino defined the distribution of powers and defined the relationship between the Regent and Council of State, formed by the High Court judges, the maestri razionali (such as high officials), the maestro portulano (who oversaw the marine and harbours authorised to deal with grain and had jurisdiction over everything that concerned that particular market) and six representatives sent by the major cities of the Kingdom (Palermo, Messina, Catania, Siracusa, Agrigento and Trapani). Like the previous time and this time even better, Blanca managed to balance her powers to that of the Council of State so that she could avert any controversy and successfully sent soldiers, weapons and supplies to her husband in Sardinia.\n\nBlanca’s excellent work was almost nullified by the death of her husband. Martino had managed to defeat Guillaume of Narbonne at the Battle of Sanluri (June 30th 1409) and drove him out from the island, but the Sicilian King had died less than a month after the battle, on July 25th in Cagliari of malaria (some maligned he had been infected by one of his lovers, a beautiful girl from Sanluri). In his will, the late King of Sicily remembers “filium nostrum don Fredericum natum ex…Tarsie muliere…Blanca consors nostra…filiam nostrum naturalem…Violanti… Agatuciam matrem dicte Violantis” (Our son don Federico born to… lady Tarsia…. Our wife Blanca… Our natural daughter…. Violante….the mother Agatuccia called Violante).\n\nNot only then the victory in Sardegna proved to be worthless (Guillaume of Narbonne took advantage of the situation and came back to finally settle in his lands), but now it was the Kingdom of Sicily and consequently also of Aragon which had to deal with a succession crisis. Martí of Aragon himself had no living children. The ones born from his first marriage to Maria de Luna (Martí the Younger, Jaime, Juan and Margarita) had already all died. The Aragonese King (who had succeeded to his son as the new King of Sicily, with the name of Martino II) took immediately precautions and, on August 6th, he confirmed his late son’s arrangements to reconfirm his daughter-in-law as Regent of Sicily and gave her the powers “de regir e administrar, governar e senyorejar en lo dit regne de Sicilia” (to reign and administer, govern and rule in said Kingdom of Sicily). Moreover, a month later, he married for a second time (Maria de Luna, had died three years prior). The new Queen was the 14 years old Margarida de Prades i Cabrera, a distant relative to the king. The old King wanted to ensure the status quo while he looked for a way to solve this dynastic crisis. His sole hope was to ensure the right of succession for his natural grandson, Federico of Sicily. The process of legitimation had already started in April of the same year, while the boy’s father was still alive, and Federico was created count de Luna and Lord of Segorbe (titles belonging to his paternal grandmother). Moreover the desperate King contacted Antipope Benedict XIII (born Pedro Martínez de Luna y Pérez de Gotor, and related to late Queen Maria de Luna) and asked him to produce a legal document that would nominate Federico as his gradfather’s legitimate heir to the throne of Sicily.\n\nOn May 31st 1410 the King died, and with him the House of Barcelona. The death of Martí the Older influenced, of course, Blanca’s regency. Following the death of her husband, towards the end of 1409, the young widow had gotten engaged to Ludwig the Bearded of Bayern-Ingolstadt, son and heir of Stephan III of Bayern and Taddea Visconti, as well as brother of Queen Isabeau of France, but the engagement got cancelled soon after. The following year she was again engaged, this time to Édouard of Bar, son of Duke Robert I of Bar and Marie of France. Once more the betrothal was called off, but given that Edward will die 5 years later in Agincourt, perhaps this wasn’t much of a loss. During the two years of interregnum that almost lead the Kingdom of Aragon to a civil war given the presence of no less than six claimants to the throne (Federico de Luna, Jaume II de Urgell, the brothers Juan and Alfonso de Aragón i Foix, Luigi III of Anjou-Valois, and Fernando de Trastámara, each one of them more or less closely related to the late king; all men since women were barred from succeeding), she was left basically on her own to deal with the growing pretensions of the Sicilian barons and among them, principally, those of the Catalan born Bernat IV de Cabrera i Foix, earl of Modica.\n\nNowadays, that tradition regarding which the earl was in love with the Regent and that the feud that will soon be born between that was due to the fact he had been rejected by Blanca, has been declared unreliable. Although Cabrera was most certainly moved by personal resentments against the Queen and her late husband. In his arrangements for the government of the Island, Martino I had excluded both his favourites Cabrera and Sancho Ruiz de Lihori, because he knew how much these two hated each other and, if he had put them together in the same council, they would have jeopardised the Kingdom’s peace and harmony. When the King died and his father the King of Aragon reconfirmed Blanca as Regent and all his late son’s arrangements, the Earl of Modica surely wasn’t happy about it. Seeing how he had been excluded from the Queen’s council (and not even remembered in the King’s will), and Blanca’s decision to appoint his rival Ruiz Lihori as Grand Admiral was, for Cabrera, the last straw. He must have felt wronged, especially after all those years of distinguished service. Martí of Aragon’s second marriage had given Cabrera the illusion his moment had finally come. Margarida was in fact his niece, being the daughter of his sister Joana de Cabrera i Foix. The Earl perhaps had thought he could use his royal relation to exert his influence.\n\nWhile he was still alive, Martí the Older might have tried to ease the damage by appointing Cabrera as Chief Justiciar of the Kingdom and asking him, via the trusted Jaime Roures, to put aside any grudge for the sake of the Kingdom and for this reason the Earl had to remain in his lands and wasn’t allowed to travel to any of the cities, mansions or lands belonging to the Crown. As soon as Cabrera received news of the King’s death, he acted quickly. He moved to Catania, in fact disobeying the order given to him to not leave his domains, to more closely attack his rival, who resided in that city. Since the source of her power was now extinct, he declared Blanca’s regency decayed in accordance to customary rules that recognised that only the Chief Justiciar had the power to act as regent during an interregnum.\n\nSoon the island was divided into two factions: those who supported the Regent Blanca and wished she kept governing the Island as the previous two Kings had intended, and among them the Grand Admiral Sancho Ruiz de Lihori Viscount of Gagliano, Antonio Moncada Abbate earl of Adernò, Enrico IV Rosso Earl of Aidone, Riccardo Filangieri Earl of San Marco, and Vitale Valguarnera Earl of Assoro; and those on Cabrera’s side, such as the majority of the Catalan born aristocracy and some cities, like Siracusa, that supported him in the hope that he would abolish the Camera reginale. In order to try a way to stabilize the situation and put an end to the contention, it was suggested (mainly by the people of Messina) to call the Parliament. Since at that time the Island was hit by a plague, the Parliament was called in Taormina (on July 1410) instead of Messina. The Parliament was attended by the former Queen, her right-hand Ruiz de Lihori, the procurators of some of the state-owned cities, as well as many barons and prelates. Cabrera didn’t participate, adducing as an excuse the fact he was too busy governing, while in fact he was luring to his side (sometimes with the use of force) many cities and lands belonging to the crown.\n\nThe Parliament of Taormina reached to the solution that Blanca had to voluntarily give up to the regency and had to hand over the control of those castles once in her custody. The government of the Island should have rested on a Council made of one prelate, two barons, six representative of Messina, two of Catania and only one each for Siracusa, Palermo, Agrigento and Trapani since any of these cities had taken part to the session of the Parliament. In charge of the army was to be Antonio I Moncada Abbate earl of Adernò. Finally, they asked to be ruled by an exponent of the House of Aragon (and Federico de Luna seemed the perfect candidate as King of Sicily), but they asked for Sicilian kingdom to remain independent from the Kingdom of Aragon. The former Queen, in a letter intended to the University of Palermo (she sent various letters to the various universities of the Island to get the people acquainted of what had been decided in the Parliament, all of these signed as La Reyna), wrote of the decision to sent envoys to Catalonia to ask for an Aragonese King and, at the same time, the recognition of Cabrera as an enemy of the House of Aragon and outlawed occupier and destroyer of the Kingdom of Sicily. If those who took part in the sessions thought the outcome would have restored peace, they were terribly mistaken. If Blanca graciously accepted of being deprived of the regency, on the other hand the decisions taken managed to enrage many and if anything it fuelled even more the hostilities. The bigger cities were enraged because of Messina had raised above them, especially Palermo couldn’t accept it. Even though it was nominally the capital of the Kingdom, it got only one representative, less than Messina of course, but also less than Catania! And then there were the Catalan-born nobles, who were horrified at the proposal to detach the Kingdom of Sicily to the Aragonese one and, among them, Artal de Luna, earl of Caltabellotta and a kinsman to Martín I. Cabrera was the one who benefited the most from it as in many decided to abandon Queen Blanca’s side and join his one. The Earl of Modica, much supported by his new allies (particularly the cities of Palermo and Trapani), asked that the decisions taken had to be revoked and that the same Parliament had to be dissolved. He overstated the situation by calling traitors those barons and cities who had taken part since they intended to separate the Crown of Sicily from the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nFearing that Cabrera could get on his side even Siracusa, which was part of the Camera Reginale as well as its political centre, Blanca sent Ruiz de Lihori to settle in the castle Marchetto and from there he had to watch over the city with the help of 600 knights and 1000 infantrymen. The same Queen followed soon and moved to the castle since she feared for her safety. She was right as Cabrera didn’t waste time and soon laid siege on the castle from both land and sea. Blanca had to endure continuous bombings and her situation was so dire, her mother Queen Leonor of Navarre sent envoys to Catalonia to ask for help on her daughter’s behalf. Unfortunately for the two women, the Catalan nobles (who were discussing who would have succeeded to the throne of Aragon) sided with Cabrera, especially considering what the Parliament of Taormina had approved concerning the future of the Kingdom of Sicily, and that, in fact, Blanca’s role as Regent had been terminated. Cabrera blamed his enemy Ruiz de Lihori as the one who had convinced and de facto manipulated the former Queen to hold on to power. Soon the majority of the inhabitants of the Mazara Valley, part of the Camera reginale, deserted their former mistress and joined Cabrera’s side. The reason behind their betrayal was that Blanca had handed over part of the lands to some of her supporters to ensure their help against the Earl of Modica. After a stop-over to check on the newly acquired allies, and then to Catania, Cabrera went to Siracusa to take part on the siege, or as he would put it, on the plan to free the Queen from the people who were using her. As a display of sincerity, he declared his willingness to return to her the land he had previously occupied.\n\nBlanca might have felt she was doomed, but luckily Giovanni Moncada Alagona (nephew of Commanding General Antonio Moncada) came to her rescue. The plan was to engage (with the help of 300 cavalrymen and roughly the same number of infantrymen) Cabrera’s army while Ramon de Torrellas, who led the fleet, approached the coast. The Queen would then escape and find shelter on one of the galleys. Unfortunately the platform to the galley got destroyed as she was about to set foot on it, and so the escape plan failed. For Moncada there was anything else to do than to rout the enemy and break the siege. And this is exactly what he did, with the help of the people of Siracusa. Now that she was free, she had to make sure of the loyalty of her allies, in order to avoid any repetition of the past dangers. Her wandering led Blanca to Randazzo, Nicosia, Taormina, and from any of these cities she sent letters to her supporters, and came to the aid of those who were being harassed by Cabrera (like the city of Naro, which unfortunately fell into the Earl’s hands). In the meantime, in Palermo the people had decided to abandon Cabrera’s side in Blanca’s favour. The plan was to have the Regent marry Nicolò Peralta, son of Giovanni Earl of Burgio, Calatamauro and Chiusa, and of Costanza Chiaramonte Ventimiglia, and have the couple crowned as Sovereigns of the Kingdom of Sicily. From his father side, Nicolò was grandson of Eleonora of Aragon, in turn granddaughter of Federico III of Sicily and Eleonora of Naples. Because of his royal connections, he was an ideal pretender to the Sicilian throne, and marrying him to the former Queen consort and Regent would have strengthened his position and claim, in turn Palermo would have raised above the other cities.\n\nWhether or not she was aware or consented to the marriage plans, nevertheless in October 1410 Blanca headed to Palermo not before her supporters had dispersed Cabrera’s troops who had posting up in the surrounding area in order to sneak up on her. Once the road was safe, the Queen settled in the Chiaramonte Palace, which stands near the sea and would have made the escape easier had the situation become direr. In the meantime in Barcelona, the Commission tasked with the investiture of King Martín’s successor was well aware of the Sicilian troubling situation. Up until now, they had stalled, thinking it was the future King’s task to settle the situation. To complicate the matter, Sicilian envoys as well as Ramon de Torrelles were asking to let Federico de Luna to at least inherit the Sicilian crown, as per his late grandfather and father’s wishes. When both the King of Navarre and Pope Benedict XIII intervened to ask the Commission to come to Blanca’s rescue and pacify the island (since there was the serious risk of a secession of Sicily from the Kingdom of Aragon), ambassadors were finally were sent to Sicily to obtain from both Cabrera and Blanca’s sides to lay down her weapons and cease all hostilities. It would have taken some time before those men reached Sicily and, in the meantime, the feud continued.\n\nIn Palermo the former Queen was now able to plan a reconquista. She managed to draw the support of many of the cities which had previously sided with Cabrera. By the end of 1411 and start of 1412, Ruiz de Lihori reconquered for her Catania, making that a great victory for Blanca’s side. Cabrera, stationed not far from Palermo (in Alcamo), received news of the ambassadors sent from Barcelona to order the ceasefire, and fearing he’d lose his chance to gain power, he decided to try everything. The Earl commanded his troops to march upon Palermo during night-time and attack the city by surprise. Unfortunately for him, his army didn’t go unnoticed and so Blanca and her side were timely alerted. She fled by sea with her ladies-in-waiting, while Cabrera penetrated in the city and occupied the Chiaramonte palace. Frustrated he couldn’t take Blanca prisoner, he vented out by spoiling the palace and seizing all the Queen’s belongings (including her jewels).\n\nMeanwhile, the ambassadors sent from Barcelona had arrived in Trapani and, as soon as they heard what was happening in Palermo, they rushed towards it. They managed to meet up with Blanca and persuaded her to recover to the nearby castle of Solanto, where she could have waited safely for the situation to unfold. She gladly accepted and declared her willingness to completely rely on their judgement to solve the strife between her and Cabrera. The ambassadors’ desire for peace was made stronger by the intervention of Antipope John XXIII who thought to take advantage of the situation to gain even more control over the island. By tradition, the Papacy had always considered, by virtue of the (false) Donation of Constantine and many others donations, the Sicilian island as part of its dominion, one of its fiefs, which they basically rented to the royal dynasties that succeeded one another on the island for a fee. Since nobody had recently paid the rent, John XXIII declared Sicily was now to be returned to its original owner and sent a papal legate to take over the island. Easily Messina and Milazzo swore allegiance to him and it was feared that many other cities would have followed, jeopardizing the position of the House of Aragon, the Regent, and the whole Catalan born nobility. Both Blanca and Cabrera were therefore eager to settle the situation between them, having in mind the famous proverb that two dogs strive for a bone, and the third runs away with it. The ambassadors’ decision favoured by far Cabrera, entrusting him the management of the territories part of the Camera reginale on behalf of the future King. In return the Queen would have received 20 thousand fiorini and the Earl of Modica pledged to not go after those who had supported his rival. Stripped of her role of Regent, and unable to complain about it since she had remitted herself completely on the Catalan envoys’ decisions, Blanca left Solanto to settle in Catania’s castle on February 21st 1412. Needless to say, the Queen’s supporters were extremely unsatisfied, even more so since Cabrera, as soon as the ambassadors left, started picking on his enemies. It didn’t take much to convince Blanca to reject what had been decided in Solanto, and try to take back what had unjustly (according to her faction) been stripped from her. The first to rebel to the established order was Giovanni Ventimiglia Aragona, Earl of Geraci, who reconquered Cefalù on the Queen’s behalf. Antonio Moncada and Ruiz de Lihori reached then Palermo to order Cabrera to give up his position, to return all the lands belonging to the Camera reginale and to travel to Catania to pay homage to Regent Blanca. Understandably Cabrera refused, but this time fortune didn’t smile on his case. The Earl was defeated and captured. To make sure he wouldn’t escape, Ruiz de Lihori took him prisoner in on of his castle, the rock of Motta Sant'Anastasia, near Catania. Imprisoning the Earl didn’t stop his faction and de facto the conflict lasted for almost the whole year 1412, until the new elected King didn’t put a stop on it. On June 25th, two years after Martí the Older’s death, Fernando of Trastámara Infante of Castile was proclaimed King of Aragon. His mother, Leonor, was the late King’s sister, as well daughter of Pere IV and Eleonora of Sicily (He was also Blanca’s first cousin since his father, King Juan I of Castile, was Queen Leonor of Navarre’s brother) Fernando, now Fernando I of Aragon, had thus bypassed the poor Federico de Luna, whose only fault was being born illegitimate and whose legitimization had basically been considered useless. The Sicilian situation was basically a thorn in the Aragonese Crown’s side as this long conflict was making Sicily an easy prey for external powers like the Papacy and King Ladislao of Naples.\n\nThe King then sent four ambassadors (Romeo de Corbera, Fernando de Vega, Fernando Velasquez and Martín de Torres) to the island to assess the situation and sort out the feud. By the end of 1412, these men reached Trapani and then left to join Blanca in Catania. Fernando’s orders were to release Earl Cabrera, all in all a man who had so loyally served the Crown of Aragon in the past. Once freed he had to leave Sicily in eight days and show up in the presence of the court. He complied and on July 12th 1413 he arrived in Barcelona. Even though she was upset for having to free her enemy, Blanca was definitely the winning party. She resumed her role as Regent, although this time she would have ruled with the help of a Council, made of equally of Catalans (the ambassadors included) and Sicilians. Still, the majority of the Sicilian lords hadn’t given up on the idea of having a King on their own. They intended to ask King Fernando to at least give them one of his numerous sons (out of 7 children, 5 were sons), though they would have preferred Federico de Luna by far. As soon as the new Aragonese King learned of the coming of the Sicilian legation, he tried to stop them from coming. When he realised he couldn’t do it, he manifested his intention to accommodate partly their request by offering one of his sons, the Infante Don Juan Duke of Peñafiel, as viceroy. To further appease the Sicilian, Fernando ordered the release of extremely powerful Antonio Ventimiglia, Earl of Collesano, whose exile and captivity in Malta since 1408 (due to crimes and rebellion against the Crown) was still a reason for discontent among many barons in Sicily.\n\nSending a viceroy would have meant Blanca’s regency was now useless. From Aragon were then sent ambassadors with the task of having the Queen leaving the Island, either by sincerely and directly asking her to leave or by using the excuse (which was true by the way) that the Infantes Juan and Henry were coming to take on the Island’s ruling. Fernando might in fact have feared his cousin wouldn’t have given up her position easily since he’d heard Blanca had ordered to strengthen the defences of the Kingdom, so he wanted the Sicilians to know he had taken matters on his own hands. Even more worrying about Fernando were the news that spoke of the intention of João I of Portugal to have Blanca marry his second son, Pedro, and seize Sicily from Aragon. Understanding the dreaded moment had finally arrived, Blanca spontaneously gave up on the Regency on April 13th 1415. It wasn’t only Blanca’s loss but also Sicily’s since from this moment the Sicilian Kingdom lost his autonomy and became just one of the many territories belonging to the Aragonese (and the Spanish) Crown. This was what the Sicilian born nobles had tried to avoid at all cost, but were powerless to do so. Before leaving the island she provided to reorganize the lands belonging to the Camera reginale. Finally, she left forever the Island which had been for 13 years her home and Kingdom and went back to Navarre.\n\nHer position in her native country had dramatically changed. Her older sister Joana, heir to the throne of Navarre and married to Jean I of Foix-Grailly, had died two years prior childless. Being the second oldest surviving legitimate daughter (both her younger brothers, Carlos and Louis, had died in infancy), she was now her father’s heir. To secure her succession, on October 28th 1416 Carlos of Navarre summoned the Cortes in Olite and had its members swear allegiance to Blanca. In the meantime, on April 2nd of the same year, Fernando I of Aragon had died. His eldest son and heir, Alfonso V, succeeded him and one of his first decision was to call back his brother Juan. Alfonso might have fought it was safer to distance Juan from Sicily since the viceroy was well-loved by the Sicilians and it was well known their desire to have a King of their own. In his place the King of Aragon sent Antonio de Cardona y Jérica and Domingo Ram y Lanaja, bishop of Lérida. Soon between Alfonso and Carlos of Navarre undertook talks to have Blanca marry the Infante Juan with the intention to strengthen the ties between Aragon, Navarre and Castile. While King Fernando had been still alive, Juan had been previously betrothed to the widowed Queen Giovanna II of Naples, sister and heir of the late King Ladislao. When this engagement failed (Fernando had required the clause that if the Queen died childless, then her husband would inherit her Kingdom and understandably she refused and later took as her second husband the twice widowed Jacques II of Bourbon-La Marche, Blanca’s former brother-in-law as her sister’s widow ), there were talks about marrying the Aragonese Infant to Isabel of Navarre, Blanca’s youngest sister. Again this union failed as the Navarrese princess married Jean IV, Earl of Armagnac.\n\nOn December 1418 the couple received the papal dispensation (being Blanca Juan’s father first cousin) so on November 6th 1419 the wedding pacts signed. The marital contract established that Blanca’s heir would be the couple’s eldest child. If the Queen were to die childless, her husband had to leave the country since his power and position depended on his marriage to her (“por el derecho que a vos pertenesce por causa de la reina donna Blanca, nuestra reina y seinnora, propietaria del dicho regno de Navarra”). The Kingdom of Navarre would keep being ruled by one of its own. No provision was made about which was in fact the duty of the King consort and his role if, despite having living children, he survived the Queen. This would prove a fatal oversight for the future of Navarre. On July 10th (or, according to chronicler Álvar García de Santa María, June 18th) 1420, the 35 years old Blanca married the Infante Juan, 13 years her junior in Pamplona’s Cathedral. Their arranged marriage would not become one of love (Juan will father at least five illegitimate children), but unlike her first marriage to the King of Sicily, Blanca will give birth to four children (three of whom survived her): Carlos, born on May 29th 1421; Juana, born on 1423; Blanca, born on June 9th 1424; and Leonor, born on February 2nd 1426. Once married, the couple moved to Peñafiel, where the firstborn, Carlos, was born.\n\nThe following year Blanca and her family returned to Navarre since her father had intended to name his grandson as his heir and, because of that, on January 20th 1423, in Tudela, Carlos III proclaimed his homonymous grandson Prince of Viana, a title he had specifically created (with the consent of the Cortes) for the child, and comparable with the more famous Prince of Asturias, Prince of Wales, or Dauphin.\n\n1425 saw the death, on August 22nd, of princess Juana and soon after, on September 8th, of King Carlos. Blanca and Juan were the new rulers of Navarre. On August 8th 1428, the Queen called the Cortes to renovate the oath of allegiance towards the Prince of Viana, recognised as the heir to the throne and the one who’ll succeed as King of Navarre after the Queen’s death. Blanca was basically ruling alone (and her Sicilian adventure must have been the perfect “training for life”) as her husband would spend a lot of time outside Navarre, mixed up in his brother Enrique’s attempt to gain power in Castile at the expense of their cousin, King Juan II. Moreover, part of the reason of his absence was that he valued more his status as Prince in Castile than his title of King (consort) of Navarre, or any other titles he derived from Aragon and Catalonia. So, when at some point in 1428 the Council of the King of Castile asked him to leave the country and go back to Navarre (since he was after all a foreign sovereign), the Infante Juan took great offence and felt like he was sent to a disgraceful exile. Nevertheless, he went back to Navarre.\n\nOn May 15th 1429, after almost four years of waiting, Blanca and him were officially crowned as Queen and King of Navarre, as Blanca I and Juan II, in Pamplona Cathedral. Less than a month later Juan will get entanled, along with his brothers Alfonso and Enrique, in a war against Castile. The so called Castilian-Aragonese War (during which Navarre would lost part of its border lands to Castile) will last until the following year, when the Treaty of Majano would settle the conflict. The Infantes de Aragón (this is how Alfonso, Juan, Enrique and the other children of Fernando I of Aragon and Leonor of Alburquerque were known) lost their claims to the throne of Castile, had to let five years pass (the duration of the truce) before they could travel again to Castile, but in the meantime a group of judges would have worked to sort out the Infantes’ claims. Both the King of Navarre and of Aragon, being in disadvantage, accepted the terms. Their younger brothers, Enrique and Pedro kept fighting until, in 1432, Pedro was captured and Enrique was forced to leave Castile in exchange for his brother’s freedom. The expulsion of the brothers marked the end of the hostilities. The Castilian adventure had costed Navarre part of its border lands lost to Castile.\n\nIn 1434 Juan travelled to Sicily to meet his brothers Alfonso, Enrique and Pedro. Together they decided to attack the Kingdom of Naples, but were defeated and captured on August 5th, in Ponza, by the Genoese fleet, sent by Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, to give help to Gaeta, besieged by the Aragonese forces. Juan would be set free on the order of the same Duke of Milan and by the end of 1434 he was again on Spanish soil.\n\nBlanca, in the meantime, had always tried to avoid getting Navarre entangled in a war (which was becoming more and more unpopular) that didn’t concern it. She sent ambassadors to Castile to clear herself and her son, explaining how they didn’t mean any harm. The Queen was especially embittered by the fact that the territories attacked by the Castilian forces mostly belonged to her son as they were part of his dowry. Not to mention the conflict had basically emptied the treasury to the point she had to sell her jewels to replenish it somehow.\n\nSo, taking advantage of her husband’s absence, she reached to Maria of Trastámara, sister of King Juan II of Castile as well as Alfonso of Aragons’s (cousin and) wife. The Queen of Navarre managed to obtain an extension of eight months of the truce, which allowed her to negotiate the definitive peace that put an end to the Castilian-Aragonese War. The Concordia de Toledo (the Concordat of Toledo) was signed on September 22nd 1436 included as a guarantee the future marriage between the Infante of Castile and Prince of asturias, Enrique, and Princess Blanca of Navarre. If the union were to be dissolved or Blanca were to die or the marriage proved childless, Castile would retain her dowry (which included part of the lands in Castile that had belonged to her father as a Castilian prince, but were seized during the war). No mention was made to those territories belonging to the Infantes that had been seized, but were already been distributed among the Castilian nobles and clearly the King of Castile had no intention of giving back. Moreover, both the King of Navarre and the heir, Prince Carlos, were prohibited to enter Castile without its King’s approval. Perhaps the only bright spot for Navarre was that it got back the border territories that had been occupied during the war, and in exchange Castile got back those that had been seized by the Navarrese army. On September 30th 1439 Crown Prince Carlos married Agnes, daughter of Count Adolf I von Kleve-Mark and Marie of Burgundy. It’s not clear why Juan chose this girl for his son, her father wasn’t particularly rich and perhaps her only value was her connection to the Burgundian ducal family (future Duke Charles the Bold was her cousin).\n\nAs soon as Agnes reached her new home, Queen Blanca introduced her daughter-in-law to the pious Navarrese court and made her (as everyone in the Royal family) member of the Fraternity of St. Catherine of St. Saturnino Church in Pamplona. Blanca also chose Agnes’ confessor and together with the princes the two women took part to a pilgrimage to Ujué. In return, the now Princess consort of Viana brought in Navarre fashion and entertainments typical of the Burgundian court. The union between Carlos and Agnes, despite being short (she will die in 1448) and childless (though the Prince of Viana would father three illegitimate children with three different women), will prove to be a happy one.\n\nIn 1439 Queen Blanca would escort her homonymous daughter to Asturias to finally marry Don Enrique of Castile. The wedding would take place in Valladolid on September 16th 1440. From there, the Queen of Navarre decided she would fulfil one of her long-time wishes and take part to a pilgrimage to St. Mary of Guadalupe, in Extremadura. She also wished to make use of this trip to act as peacemaker with some noblemen in conflict with her husband. Her health was already declining and the long journey must have worsened her conditions. Queen Blanca never made up to her destination as she died in Santa María la Real de Nieva, near Segovia, on April 1st 1441. She was 54. Contrary to her wishes to be buried in the church of St. Mary of Ujué, she would be put to rest in the city’s monastery (the church of Nuestra Señora de la Soterraña), and later her relics would be moved to the church of Nuestra Señora de la Misericordia in Tafalla, near Pamplona, following her daughter Leonor’s decision.\n\nHer death would spark a terrible war of succession that would put her husband against her son and will also involve her two daughters. In her will (dated back to February 17th 1439), and as it had been already decided, Blanca declared her intention to leave the crown to her heir, her son Carlos Prince of Viana. Perhaps in an attempt to strengthen the relationship between father and son, she had included a paragraph that, unbeknownst to her intentions, would be used as weapon by Juan. In it she established that her son couldn’t success to the Kingdom of Navarre and the Duchy of Nemour without the consent and the blessing of his father. (“Y aunque el dicho príncipe, nuestro caro y muy amado hijo, pueda, después de nuestra muerte, por causa de herencia y derecho reconocido, intitularse y nombrarse rey de Navarra y duque de Nemours, no obstante, por guardar el honor debido al señor rey su padre, le rogamos, con la mayor ternura que podemos, de no querer tomar estos títulos sin el consentimiento y la bendición del dicho señor padre”). This clause prompted Juan to refuse to give up his title of King of Navarre even though his wife, the real titular sovereign and source of his power, was dead. Carlos, the true heir, was then deprived of his rights and refused his father’s proposal to be named mere Governor of the Kingdom.\n\nIn 1444 Juan remarried. His second wife was Juana Enriquez de Córdoba, a strong willed noblewoman belonging to the Enriquez, an illegitimate branch line of the Castilian royal family. She will bore him three children: Leonor (who died in infancy), Fernando II, the Catholic King, and Juana, Queen consort of Naples. Princess Blanca (whose unhappy union with Enrique of Castile had been annulled by Pope Nicholas V in 1453, on account of being childless since it might not having been ever consummated) sided with her brother and even asked her father-in-law to support militarly Carlos. When in 1461 Carlos died, she succeeded him as Blanca II (as late Queen Blanca’s oldest living child), though her father prevented her from exercise her powers and de facto segregated her, furious of her decision to take Carlos’ side. Blanca II would die of poison three years later, and her sister Leonor and her husband Gaston IV de Foix-Béarn (they had married in 1442) would be accused to be the instigators. The couple had taken Juan’s side and, through the Treaty of Olite of 1462, acknowledged him as rightful King of Navarre (in addition to his title of King of Aragon, having succeeded in 1458 to his brother Alfonso V, who had died without legitimate heirs). To thank her for her support, Juan confirmed Leonor Governor of the Kingdom. In 1468 Leonor rebelled to her father, but they made peace soon after and when he died in 1479, she succeeded him as Leonor I, despite the attempt of her half-brother Fernando to steal her title. Queen Blanca’s last child died on February 12th, merely after two weeks of reign. She left Navarre to her grandson François Fébus of Foix-Navarre, son of her late firstborn Gaston Prince of Viana (who had died in 1470).\n\nSources\n\n- Jerónimo Zurita y Castro, Anales de la Corona de Aragon, books X-XIII;\n\n- Giovanni Battista Caruso, Memorie istoriche di quanto è accaduto in Sicilia dal tempo de’ suoi primieri abitatori sino alla coronazione del re Vittorio Amedeo, part 2, vol. 2;\n\n- Rosario Gregorio, Bibliotheca Scriptorum Qui Res In Sicilia Gestas Sub Aragonum Imperio Retulere, vol 2;\n\n- Vincenzo Di Giovanni, Cronache siciliane dei secoli XIII.
