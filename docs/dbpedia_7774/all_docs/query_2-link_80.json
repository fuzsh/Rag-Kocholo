        "text": "\"I didn’t want to leave him in any doubt that we love having him here\"\n\nWEST LAFAYETTE – Before Jeff Brohm engaged in a face-to-face meeting with Louisville and before he knew exactly how strong Purdue’s commitment was to keep him, a handwritten letter had already made its way to his office.\n\nThe Brohm-to-Louisville conversation became a nearly three-week intense battle between one school trying to lure the hometown hero back to his alma mater and the other trying to keep its new coaching superstar. The tug-of-war was underway.\n\nWhat’s the big deal about a handwritten letter? It's old and archaic. Texting is easier. A quick email can accomplish the same message. A phone call or face-to-face conversation might have the same impact.\n\nBut a handwritten letter on a 5x7 card is a personal touch that has tremendous value. It's a lost art in today’s world of communication.\n\n“Nobody can hack it,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels joked.\n\nDaniels should know. He takes pride in his letters. His one to Brohm last fall played a role in keeping the football program on its current trajectory.\n\nDaniels sat at his desk, conveyed his thoughts about Brohm on one of his personal cards, which features the president's name at the top and a Purdue University logo.\n\nThe letter was delivered to Brohm at the Football Performance Complex in the days after Louisville fired Bobby Petrino and the reality that the Boilermakers could lose their coach after just two seasons and two consecutive bowl berths.\n\nPurdue has the right coach, who assembled the right staff and the success on the field was beginning to translate to the recruiting world and starting over wasn’t an option. Daniels, athletic director Mike Bobinski, the Board of Trustees and the fan base were not eager to face life without Brohm, at least not yet.\n\nDaniels and Brohm declined to share with the Journal & Courier the exact contents of the letter, other than the overall tone and message.\n\n“I don’t want to talk about it too much, but I would say that I understood the situation he was in and clearly could empathize,” Daniels said. “I wanted to do everything we could, but I did not want to pressure somebody who had an unusually difficult call.\n\n“This wasn’t just about what’s the best place to coach. It had the whole other dimension to it. I wanted to let him know I understood that, and I could empathize with that. I didn’t want to leave him in any doubt that we love having him here and I was excited about it.”\n\nWe all know how this chapter in the program’s history ended.\n\nBrohm remains Purdue’s coach, the school rewarded him with a seven-year contract worth $36.8 million, including a hefty $1.7 million signing bonus and numerous retention bonuses to provide enough financial incentive to stay in West Lafayette.\n\nBrohm acknowledged the “great job of communicating and so-called recruiting” by Bobinski, Daniels and Michael Berghoff, chairman of the Board of Trustees, last fall to stay at Purdue.\n\n“When you get a handwritten letter and when you get things delivered to you - I got other letters on my doorstep from other important people as well - but when those people reach out and open up the line of communication and say you can call them if you need anything or call them when you have a chance, yes, you build a trust a factor there and it does make you feel more comfortable when decisions are being thrown at you that you have to make,” Brohm said.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for Daniels to send handwritten letters. On the day of this interview, Daniels was preparing to write a letter to an author who had sent him a book. He comes from an era where the personal touch is often appreciated.\n\nAnd the letter to Brohm was noticed and admired.\n\nRECRUITING: Pittsburgh offensive lineman commits to Purdue\n\nPURDUE RECEIVER: Another layer of Rondale Moore's work ethic revealed\n\nBIG MONEY: Paying big guarantees for nonconference games reaches Purdue\n\n“The commitment could not be any stronger than it is at Purdue,” said Oscar Brohm, Jeff’s father. “The support, the confidence they’ve shown in him. It meant a lot to us and it means a lot to Jeff.\n\n“We love Purdue. Mike Bobinski is the best athletic director you could ever have. Mitch Daniels, he's the best president around. The fans are great. All the people are great. The players played hard for Jeff. He loves it at Purdue.”\n\nWhen the 48-year old Brohm met with Bobinski and Berghoff the day before Thanksgiving to discuss the Louisville situation, Daniels’ letter was still on his mind. Of course, Purdue would have to step up financially – and it did – but it didn’t hurt that the foundation created by Daniels’ letter was in place.\n\n“To me, that was a meaningful, significant gesture. It was from the heart,” Bobinski said. “Putting pen to paper still to me means more than typing out an email or firing out a text. That’s who Mitch is.\n\n\"It shows his own style and he wanted to express his feelings about that as Jeff was in the middle of a difficult decision. I thought it was a well-timed and well-executed gesture and I know it didn’t hurt our cause. It only helped.”\n\nIf Brohm’s decision was just about football, he probably doesn’t consider coaching at Louisville for more than a few minutes. But it was his hometown. It’s where he was a star quarterback, not only in high school at Trinity but with the Cardinals under legendary coach Howard Schnellenberger.\n\nOscar and his wife, Donna, still live in Louisville. Other family members and close friends remain in the city and the area. The emotional ties played a bigger role than the practical ones.\n\n“Some emotional, difficult discussions and frank discussions,” Oscar said of the days after the win over Indiana and leading up to his son’s final decision. “Sometimes, not rough but honest discussions. It was tough. Jeff made the final decision. He wavered back and forth. The logical decision was Purdue but there was emotion involved.”\n\nJeff Brohm has acknowledged the difficulty of informing his family, especially Oscar, about his decision to stay and continue building Purdue’s program instead of returning home.\n\nIf there were emotional wounds from the discussions, they no longer exist.\n\n“Everything is great there,” Jeff Brohm said. “Just like any situation when kids, grandkids, everyone that is involved, and people are a certain age, everybody wants to be around each other and enjoy the experience. All of that is great now. It didn’t take very long after that.”\n\nIn his letter, Daniels said he emphasized his feelings about what Brohm has accomplished in two short seasons, but it was more than just about the words. It was the way they were communicated that likely had a profound impact on the decision.\n\n“When the president spends that much time going out of his way to communicate things he believes in and expresses where he thinks the program is at and where it can go, his thoughts on me and everything in numerous ways and opening up that line of communication &mldr; they understand what I’m about; I understand what they’re about and we have confidence in each other,” Jeff Brohm said."
