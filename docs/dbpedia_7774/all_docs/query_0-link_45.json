        "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – The “2017 Influence List,” the Chronicle of Higher Education’s annual compilation that includes Purdue University President Mitch Daniels, comes with a caveat right in the secondary headline:\n\n“The people who make a difference in higher ed – for better or worse.”\n\nDaniels is referenced as a “Dealmaker” in a list that editors of The Chronicle, a campus staple, said “sought to spotlight the less obvious players &mldr; who are likely to remain influential in the year ahead.”\n\nChronicle reporter Goldie Blumenstyk wrote:\n\n“When opportunity knocks, Purdue University’s president, Mitch Daniels, isn’t afraid to open the door.”\n\nThe piece discussed Daniels’ work with the Gallup-Purdue Index, income-sharing agreements and Purdue’s pending and controversial deal to acquire for-profit Kaplan University – “the most talked-about business move on the higher-education landscape in 2017.”\n\n“Hailed in some quarters for his audacious stroke, Mr. Daniels has also faced criticism over it from his own faculty senate and some outside critics, who question the secretive negotiations leading up to the arrangement and some of the financial terms tying Purdue with Kaplan.\n\n“The deal still requires final approval from the U.S. Department of Education and the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits both institutions. The fate of Kaplan will be closely watched — and will help determine whether Mr. Daniels’s deals go down as examples of bold innovation or misguided presidential ambition.”\n\nBANGERT: Senator takes new swipe at Mitch Daniels over Purdue-Kaplan deal\n\nPURDUE-KAPLAN: 300+ faculty petition against NewU deal, say it will hurt Purdue's name\n\nPAY: Mitch Daniels’ pay hits $769K as Purdue trustees cheer his performance\n\nCOST OF AN EDUCATION: Can Mitch Daniels keep Purdue tuition streak going?\n\nHere are the others on The Chronicle’s list:\n\n► Jalane D. Schmidt, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, for her activism after white supremacists came to her campus this summer.\n\n► Jessica B. Sandberg, director of international admissions at Temple University, for a #YouAreWelcomeHere campaign in the face of anti-immigrant rhetoric from the Trump White House.\n\n► Ray Chetty, a Stanford University economics professor, for the Equality of Opportunity Project’s efforts to track how well higher education affects upward mobility.\n\n► Candice Jackson, deputy assistant secretary for strategic operation and outreach in the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, for her influence on rolling back Title IX regulations.\n\n► Elizabeth Kiss, president of Agnes Scott College, for the way her campus is working to increase enrollment at the small, liberal art school in Decatur, Ga.\n\n► Sterling Beard, editor in chief of Campus Reform, a publication with a mission to expose “bias and abuse on the nation’s college campuses.”\n\n► Bond, Schoeneck & King, a Syracuse, New York, law firm, for defense of the University of North Carolina in the wake of an NCAA investigation in academic fraud.\n\n► Timothy Piazza, a sophomore at Penn State University, whose hazing death at his fraternity turned into a rallying point for a new look the Greek system nationwide.\n\nThe full version is available in the Dec. 3 edition of The Chronicle."
