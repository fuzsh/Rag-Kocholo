        "text": "Back in August, an interviewer stumped Mitch Daniels, a Republican star of yesteryear who is stepping down at the end of this month as president of Purdue University, with a question about how he might fare in the flame-throwing partisan warfare of today.\n\n“Can your brand of conservatism still win in the current environment?” Adam Wren asked in a lengthy interview in Politico Magazine.\n\n“I don’t know,” responded Daniels, who served as governor of Indiana from 2005 to 2013. “I’ve been in isolation and quarantine for 10 years.”\n\nThat wasn’t entirely true: Daniels writes a monthly column for The Washington Post, where he has weighed in regularly on national affairs from the perspective of a scholarly, genial conservative. But he has mostly spent the last decade cocooned away from the public arena as the decidedly unscholarly Donald Trump molded the Republican Party in his own image.\n\nAnd the next part of his answer was intriguing.\n\n“In one way I think about it,” Daniels said, “maybe I haven’t been infected by the viruses that are running around on both sides.”\n\nDaniels, 73, is “fascinated by the idea” of running for office again, his allies have said, and is now weighing a run for the Senate seat that will soon be vacated by Mike Braun, who is running for governor in Indiana.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
