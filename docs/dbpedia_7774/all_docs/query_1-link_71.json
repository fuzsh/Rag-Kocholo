        "text": "Daniel Jay Wetekam, 44, of Colorado Springs, CO, went to be with our Lord on Friday, July 26, 2024. Born on November 20, 1979, in Tampa Bay, FL, Daniel “Dan or Danny” was a beloved father, grandfather, father-in-law, son, brother, nephew, cousin, uncle, and friend to many.\n\nDaniel had a strong passion for sports, music, movies, video games, and of course his friends, all of which played a significant role throughout his life. Dan’s favorite day of the week was always football Sunday, as he loved cheering for the Broncos. He bled orange and blue. Dan also loved everything about music, from listening to singing to performing. He always dreamt of making it big as a singer and guitar player. During high school Dan performed with the Mitchell Madrigals which evolved to playing in bands with his friends; Monkey in the Middle and Negative 2. He also enjoyed singing karaoke; he had an amazing voice. People loved it when he sang. Daniel also had a deep love for his family and friends, he made a lasting impact on everyone he met. He was incredibly friendly, kind and outgoing. He had many friends and cherished his friendships; they meant the world to him.\n\nFrom birth, Dan had a sweet and joyful disposition that continued throughout his life. His entire family adored him, as well as others he met along the way. Growing up Dan was close to his grandparents, Robert “Bob” and Helen McSpadden. He idolized his grandfather and always wanted to be like him. Dan also had a very special relationship with his stepdad, Tom Hanna. He loved to talk about sports and cars with him. Dan and his mom, Suzanne Hanna, shared a close bond. She was his go-to, his number one supporter. She was always there to encourage and motivate him through life.\n\nAbove all Dan loved his family with his whole heart. He was extremely proud of his children: Baby Girl (Jadyn) and Little Man (Eli). He also adored his granddaughter, Daniella Marie, or Baby Baby Girl. Dan would do anything for his family. His favorite day of the year was the Saturday before Halloween, when the family would have a “campin” in the living room. Everyone would watch Halloween movies and eat smores all night.\n\nDan was not a fan of school, however in time, he decided to attend trade school through an apprenticeship with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to become an electrician. This was a large part of his life. When he joined the IBEW he became part of another family, the brotherhood. The brotherhood meant a lot to Dan, he held this dearly. He enjoyed sharing his wisdom with others and helping them become electricians.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Jadyn and Eli Wetekam; granddaughter, Daniella Wetekam; mother and stepfather, Suzanne and Tom Hanna; father and stepmother, Donald and Sheri Wetekam; sisters and brothers: Noelle McAdams, Sarah Michelle (Shelley) Walsh, Jim Hanna, Amy Lengyel, Julie Hanna-Smith, Brian Hanna, LeAna Warner; as well as many friends and extended family members who will miss dearly.\n\nIt’s difficult to put in words the depth of sadness we, his family, will always feel at the loss of this wonderful loving son, brother, husband, father, grandfather and friend. Daniel’s kind heart, generous spirit, and unwavering loyalty will be deeply missed by all who knew and loved him. He was an amazing person throughout his life and a huge part of our family. His legacy of love and friendship will continue to inspire us.\n\n“‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” Revelation 21:4 NIV"
