Mitch Daniels, former governor of Indiana, sought as governor to remove works by historian Howard Zinn from Indiana classrooms and curricula. Emails obtained through FOIA requests show Daniels took steps to eliminate what he saw as liberal influences at Indiana public universities. Daniels is now president of Purdue University, and critics argue his past censorship efforts are inappropriate for a university leader tasked with protecting academic freedom. Daniels defends his actions and views on Zinn and says he would defend academic freedom at Purdue.",
