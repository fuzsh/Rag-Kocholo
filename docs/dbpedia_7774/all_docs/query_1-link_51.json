That focus is reflected in turn by the high level of satisfaction his patients report on surveys conducted at the area hospitals, at his clinical practice and in earning the designation of “Best Doctor” on multiple occasions. Beginning with a commitment to treat each patient with compassion and respect, Dr. Daniels works to help them thoroughly understand their conditions, the treatment options available, and together formulate a treatment plan. That plan will usually emphasize conservative, nonsurgical care first, with surgery always being the last option.\n\nDr. Daniels recognizes and respects the value of a team approach. By utilizing the skills offered by many types of healthcare providers he is able to achieve excellent outcomes from his patient care. This includes utilizing his physician assistant, Chelsea Thomas, physical therapists, and physiatrists to craft the best course of care for each patient’s unique condition.\n\nHe specializes in hip and knee joint replacement and has completed advanced training to stay current with new minimally invasive procedures and the most advanced technology. He is the only area orthopedic surgeon trained and experienced with custom and robotic technology, including the MAKO Robotic-Arm Assisted Technology and is an area leader in the advanced Direct Anterior Approach hip procedure. With 20+ years experience, Dr. Daniels has performed close to 4,000 total joint procedures for area residents as well as accumulated extensive experience and training in sports medicine, trauma, and general orthopedics.\n\nIn addition to patient care, Dr. Daniels is involved in medical research and the development of new orthopedic products and procedures. He is active in leadership at the local hospitals, serving as director of the Centegra Hospital Total Joint Program. As a life-long area resident, he is committed to his community and has coached youth sports and served as Team Physician for Marian Central and other high schools throughout his career.\n\nWhen he is not practicing medicine, Dr. Daniels is an avid adventurer and traveler. With a love of both the sea and mountains, he has enjoyed extensive travel with his family. He is an accomplished mountaineer, completing over 40 summit climbs, has adventure raced and even swam with sharks. Closer to home, he enjoys restoring old wooden boats, home brewing beer, golf, marathon running, tennis, and water sports.\n\nAs an osteoarthritis sufferer himself, Dr. Daniels understands and empathizes with his patients. He looks forward to the opportunity to assist you in a return to a more active and pain-free life."
