        "text": "As a donor family, you may decide to write a letter to the recipients of your loved one's organs. This is a personal decision, and you should not feel any pressure to act in one way or another. Sometimes, donor families choose to write to recipients to share information about their loved one and the decision to donate. For some families, sharing helps them with the grieving process. All correspondence is anonymous and identities are kept confidential. There is no time limit for sending a letter, and you may write at any time. Many choose to send a letter during the holidays, or an anniversary card. Others opt to send a \"Thinking of You\" card instead. Sometimes the hardest part is writing those first few words. If you want to write, but are having trouble or need more information about writing to recipients, please don't hesitate to call our office at 210.614.7030.\n\nIf you decide to write, here are some suggestions and guidelines:\n\nOnly include information you are comfortable with sharing about yourself and your loved one. This may include occupation, hobbies, interests, or special things your loved one enjoyed. First names are welcome.\n\nPlease do not share last names, geographic locations, phone numbers, email addresses, social media pages, hospital names, physicians that helped you, etc. Due to TOSA's confidentiality policy, this information will be omitted if included in any letters.\n\nYou may want to briefly explain the circumstances that led to your loved one becoming a donor and how you made the decision to donate. You can also include how this decision has impacted you, your family, and community.\n\nOther things to consider:\n\nUse simple language.\n\nIf there is more than one recipient you may choose to write separate letters or use the same letter for all recipients.\n\nBe thoughtful when using spiritual comments since the religion of the recipient(s) is unknown.\n\nAfter you have completed your correspondence:\n\nPlace the letter or card in an unsealed envelope.\n\nInclude a separate sheet of paper with your full name, your loved one's full name, date of donation, and your contact information.\n\nMail to:\n\nDonor Family Services\n\nTexas Organ Sharing Alliance\n\n5051 Hamilton Wolfe Rd.\n\nSan Antonio, TX 78229-4455\n\nOnce your correspondence is received, it will be reviewed by the Donor Family Services Coordinator to ensure confidentiality. It will then be forwarded to the recipient's transplant center, reviewed by their social worker and forwarded to the recipient. Although we strive to complete this task quickly, this entire process may take several weeks before the letter reaches the recipient.\n\nWill I hear from the recipients?\n\nKeep in mind some recipients may send a response to your letter while others may not write back. This is their personal decision that could be made for various reasons. Many recipients state they feel overwhelmed with emotion and have difficulty expressing their gratitude in a letter, while others are continuing to heal and adjusting to their new lives as a transplant recipient. Most recipients have said that writing to their donor family is the most difficult thing they have ever done. Even if you never receive a letter, we hope you will take comfort in knowing that your loved one's gift has helped others.\n\nWill I ever be able to meet the transplant recipients?\n\nContact between donor family members and recipients and their families has been reported to be a fulfilling experience for all parties. However, before initiating such contact, both the donor family and the recipient should take time to explore their feelings regarding direct contact.\n\nTOSA will only allow direct, unedited communication between the donor family and recipient following an initial letter where both parties express a desire to have further communication. Both parties must sign a waiver releasing their right to confidentiality. After both waivers have been received, the exchange of personal information may be made and TOSA will no longer be involved in communication between you and this recipient. Please keep in mind this process must be done for each recipient."
