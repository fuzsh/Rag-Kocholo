        "text": "Former Gov. Mitch Daniels (R-IN) announced he would not run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN), avoiding what was likely to become one of the most contentious GOP primaries in the 2024 cycle as Republicans seek to gain control of the upper chamber.\n\nDaniels said on Tuesday he would not be seeking higher office, noting that he didn’t believe it would be the right decision at this point in his career, according to Politico. His decision marks the end of a monthslong period of uncertainty as the Purdue University president mulled whether to return to the realm of politics.\n\nFORMER INDIANA GOV. MITCH DANIELS MEETS WITH SENATORS AMID SENATE BID SPECULATION\n\n“After what I hope was adequate reflection, I’ve decided not to become a candidate for the U.S. Senate,” Daniels told the outlet. “With full credit and respect for the institution and those serving in it, I conclude that it’s just not the job for me, not the town for me, and not the life I want to live at this point.”\n\nDaniels previously served as the Hoosier State’s governor from 2005 to 2013 before accepting a job as president of Purdue University. The former governor later announced his retirement from Purdue in 2022, stoking speculation he was preparing for a Senate run.\n\nAs Daniels privately considered a Senate bid, he faced widespread scrutiny from allies of former President Donald Trump who sought to paint the former governor as a RINO, or “Republican in Name Only.”\n\nBraun announced in December he would not seek reelection, becoming the first Senate Republican to announce his retirement for the 2024 cycle.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWith Daniels no longer in the running, the GOP primary field has opened up for other Republican candidates to replace Braun. Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) has not yet indicated whether she plans to run, but she is considered a favored candidate. So far, only Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) has announced his intent to run for the vacant seat.\n\nSenate Republicans responded to Daniels’s announcement, lauding the former governor for his previous political experience while expressing support for his decision.\n\n“I have the utmost respect for the years of service Governor Daniels has given to Indiana and wish him well in the future,” National Republican Senate Committee Chairman Steve Daines said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to working with one of our top recruits this cycle, Jim Banks, to keep Indiana red in 2024.”\n\nWhoever wins the GOP primary is likely to win the Senate seat in 2024, as Indiana is considered a reliably red state."
