In addition to many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, great nieces, great nephews and many friends.\n\nThe thing she enjoyed most in life was spending time with her family and friends. A 1981 graduate of Boston College, Leslie was an avid Boston sports fan especially the Boston College Eagles, Red Sox, Bruins and Patriots. She loved to travel especially taking cruises with Peter and her family or later in life with their dear friends Joe and Lisa Flynn. A true Mainer at heart, she spent many summers as a child in Biddeford, and later at camp on Sebago Lake with her family and Maine friends and more recently Lake Winnipesaukee. She loved to cook and to bake. She will be remembered for her love, her sense of humor, her cakes and her chocolate chip cookies which she brought to every special occasion.\n\nVisiting hours will be held on Tuesday May 28, at Mackey Funeral Home, 128 S. Main Street Middleton, MA from 4 to 7 PM. A Mass of Christian Burial to celebrate her life will be on Wednesday May 29, at 10:30 AM at St. Agnes Church, 22 Boston Street, Middleton. The burial will be private at a later date. The family suggests that in lieu of flowers, a donation in Leslieâ€™s memory can be made to the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. ( Link is below)."
