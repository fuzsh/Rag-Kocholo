        "text": "Founded in 1926, ROTC stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps. Itâ€™s a college program offered at more than 1,000 colleges and universities across the United States that prepares young adults to become officers in the U.S. Military. In exchange for a paid college education and a guaranteed post-college career, cadets commit to serve in the Military after graduation. As detailed below, each Service branch has its own take on ROTC.\n\nService Academies and Senior Military Colleges\n\nFor students who would like to experience a military environment while getting a first-class education, the four Service academies offer an outstanding education and full four-year scholarships. Tuition, books, board and medical and dental care are all fully paid for all four years. The competition to get in is fierce.\n\nThe U.S. Military Academy (Army) in West Point, N.Y.\n\nThe U.S. Naval Academy (Navy/Marine Corps) in Annapolis, Md.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force Academy (Air Force) in Colorado Springs, Colo.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard Academy (Coast Guard) in New London, Conn.\n\nThe U.S Merchant Marine Academy Kings Point, NY.\n\nAdmissions criteria include:\n\nHigh school academic performance\n\nStandardized test scores (SAT or ACT)\n\nAthletics and extracurricular activities\n\nLeadership experience and community involvement\n\nA congressional letter of recommendation (not required by the Coast Guard Academy)\n\nGraduates of all four academies receive a Bachelor of Science degree and are commissioned as officers in their respective Service branch.
