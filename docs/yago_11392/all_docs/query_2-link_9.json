        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Buck_%28animal_collector%29\n\nFrank Howard Buck (March 17, 1884 – March 25, 1950) was an American hunter, animal collector, and author, as well as a film actor, director, and producer. Beginning in the 1910s he made many expeditions into Asia for the purpose of hunting and collecting exotic animal and bringing over 100,000 live specimens back to the United States and elsewhere for zoos and circuses, earning a great deal of money, and garnering a reputation as an adventurer. He co-authored seven books chronicling or based on his expeditions, beginning with 1930's Bring 'Em Back Alive, which became a bestseller. Between 1932 and 1943 he starred in seven adventure films based on his exploits, most of which featured staged \"fights to the death\" with various wild beasts. He was also briefly a director of the San Diego Zoo, displayed wild animals at the 1933–34 Century of Progress exhibition and 1939 New York World's Fair, toured with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, and co-authored an autobiography, 1941's All in a Lifetime. The Frank Buck Zoo in Buck's hometown of Gainesville, Texas is named after him.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrank Buck, hunter, author, and filmmaker, son of Howard D. and Ada (Sites) Buck, was born on March 17, 1884, in a wagonyard owned by his father at Gainesville, Texas. When he was five, his family moved to Dallas, where his father, who was distantly related to the Studebaker family, went to work for their Dallas agency dealing in wagons and carriages.\n\nAfter attending public schools in Dallas, Buck left home at the age of eighteen to take a job handling a trainload of cattle being sent to Chicago. In 1911 he made his first expedition to South America. He eventually also traveled to Malaya, India, Borneo, New Guinea, and Africa. From these and other expeditions he brought back many exotic species that he sold to zoos and circuses, and he ultimately acquired the nickname \"Bring 'Em Back Alive.\"\n\nBuck was author of Bring 'Em Back Alive (with E. Anthony, 1930), Wild Cargo (with Anthony, 1931), Fang and Claw (with F. L. Fraser, 1935), Jim Thompson in The Jungles (1935), On Jungle Trails (with Fraser, 1937), Animals Are Like That! (with C. Weld, 1939), and his autobiography, All in a Lifetime (1941). He was a contributor to the Saturday Evening Post and Colliers, and for some time he had a radio program. He was president of Frank Buck Enterprises, Incorporated, and Jungleland, Incorporated, and produced several motion pictures, including Bring 'Em Back Alive, Wild Cargo, and Fang and Claw (made from his books), and Jungle Menace, Jungle Cavalcade, and Jacare.\n\nBuck married Amy Leslie in the early 1900s, but they separated in 1911. He married Muriel Riley in 1928, and they had one daughter. Buck died on March 25, 1950, at Houston."
