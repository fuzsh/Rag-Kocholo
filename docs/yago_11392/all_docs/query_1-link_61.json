        "text": "LESLIE JEFFERSON - SCWC\n\nPRESIDENT & SENIOR CONSULTANT\n\nHi, my name is Leslie Jefferson, President & Senior Consultant with Wedding Savvy. I was Wedding Savvy’s very first team member shortly after it opened in 2002 and now I am extremely proud to lead the company I had so much of a hand in building. I have been fortunate to have worked in the business for many years with experienced and dedicated wedding professionals that have led me to success in this role.\n\nI graduated from The University of Maryland, Eastern Shore with a degree in Hotel and Restaurant Management and also earned my Bachelor of Science in Speech Pathology from Towson University. I then later went on to earn my Masters in Speech and Hearing Science from East Carolina University.\n\nI actually say I began my career in the hospitality industry at the age of 14 where I was a bus girl at a local restaurant. I continued to work in and out of the hospitality industry at a variety of levels over the course of my career including catering manager, bartender, server, hostess, and restaurant manager. My love for hospitality has always been a part of me and my boots on the ground upbringing gives me an appreciation for all the work that goes into making someone’s day special.\n\nI have been told by clients I have calming and pleasant disposition and that they appreciated my ability to handle difficult situations saving them the stress of worrying about it. Clients commented that they knew I would take care of it and let them know what, if anything they needed to do! I am very flattered by that because it is my goal to make people feel comfortable and confident in working with me and the wedding professional team I build for them. I am organized and timely but also realize the flexibility of last minute changes and unforeseen circumstances.\n\nI have coordinated weddings from 25 to 400 guests in a variety of locations including a tented event on a private property, a winery in Santa Rosa, California, and at many of the beautiful reception sites along the Chesapeake Bay. I live on the Eastern Shore with my teenage son and in my free time love spending time on the water, with family, and traveling. I look forward to meeting and working with you soon!"
