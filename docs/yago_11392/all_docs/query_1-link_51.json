        "text": "At the time, the series — still a nebulous idea — was rumored to be an \"Office\" spinoff. They talked vaguely of concepts, and agreed that it would be fun to work together.\n\nBy the time the series' premise came together, Poehler was pregnant. Schur decided to pitch her anyway. \"Greg's and my general feeling was: Poehler or bust, pregnancy be damned,\" he writes in the footnotes of Poehler's book.\n\nSchur called again, this time from the balcony of his house while chain-smoking. Poehler writes:\n\n\"He told me about a character he and Greg created called Leslie Knope. She was an extremely low-level Parks and Recreation Department employee who had big dreams. She was inspired by the 'Yes We Can' spirit of Obama's recent election. She believed that it only took one person to make a difference. She wanted to effect change, she wanted to someday be president, but most importantly, she wanted to turn an empty parking lot in her town into a park.\"\n\nSoon after Poehler received the script, she said \"it took five minutes to realize Leslie Knope was the best character ever written for me.\"\n\nAfter a long discussion with then-husband Will Arnett, she moved her family out to Los Angeles and shot six episodes in a row. \"Parks and Recreation\" went on to become one of the most beloved female-lead comedies of the last decade, earning five Emmy nominations.\n\nLooking back at Leslie's journey, Schur reflects, \"It's so interesting to think about it this way, now, as we near the end — it was, at the beginning, really that simple: a woman who wanted to make something out of nothing.\""
