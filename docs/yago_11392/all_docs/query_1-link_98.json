        "text": "Tune in for a special edition of Yale Alumni LIVE featuring educator Leslie Blatteau '97, '07 MA. She will be joined by special guest Amy Rodriguez, an ECHO Perfect 10 intern at the Yale Alumni Association this summer.\n\nNo registration is required. To watch, visit the Yale Alumni Association YouTube channel or the Yale alumni Facebook group on August 18 at 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nJoin Echo Intern Amy Rodriguez in conversation with Leslie Blatteau ’97, ’07 MA, social studies teacher at Metropolitan, a magnet high school in New Haven.\n\nLeslie has called New Haven home since 1997 when she graduated from Yale University with a degree in history and theatre studies. Before returning to Yale to earn a Master’s Degree in Urban Education, Leslie served for six years as an outreach worker with student-parents in New Haven Public Schools, supporting their efforts to graduate and helping connect them with resources in the community. She became a social studies teacher in 2007 and earned a 6th Year Degree in Educational Leadership from Southern Connecticut State University in 2014. Leslie lives in the Hill neighborhood with her husband, five-year-old daughter, their dog and two cats. Leslie also volunteers with the New Haven Peace Commission, the New Haven Public School Advocates, and the New Haven Climate Movement on issues related to peace, climate justice, and supporting our city’s public schools.\n\nAmy Rodriguez is a Hamden native interning at the YAA this summer. She is a 2021 graduate of Metropolitan Business Academy in New Haven and will attend Eastern CT State University this fall, where she plans to major in psychology. She has a passion for poetry, painting, and climate justice. She has previously interned at WOW Creative Design Group where she used her talents in art to create digital designs and logos.\n\nEcho Perfect 10 is a training and experiential learning initiative implemented to prepare high school students and young adults for introduction to workplace culture, nurture interest in a variety of employment opportunities, increase self-confidence and ultimately support successful employment placement. It is a preparatory employment program comprised of curricula-based training, job shadowing, and internships and is available to high school students who reside in New Haven. Yale’s New Haven Hiring Initiative supports internships by coordinating opportunities across campus. The Hiring Initiative’s mission is to fuel economic growth in New Haven by preparing the workforce of the future."
