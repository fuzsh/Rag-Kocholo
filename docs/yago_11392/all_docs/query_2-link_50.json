        "text": "Larry Lee Arnett, of Leslie, MI, passed away on Tuesday, October 3, 2023 after a battle with a long-term illness. He was 75 years old.\n\nLarry was born November 3, 1947 in Stockbridge, Michigan to Ernest and Beatrice (Marshall) Arnett. After graduating from Stockbridge High School, he held many unconventional jobs; he was a Hostess delivery driver, a Hickory Ridge milkman and a car salesman, all before purchasing the Wooden Nickel Saloon in Dansville with his ex-wife (and friend), Carol. He also owned “Crazy Larry’s” catering, providing food and service for many weddings, funerals, fundraisers, and other events in the area. He retired in 2018 after 40+ years of serving and employing people from all over mid-Michigan.\n\nLarry was very much a people person, full of many interesting stories he loved to tell. It was guaranteed he would see a familiar face while running errands, as there were very few people he didn’t know. He had a way of making everyone feel like his best friend, even if it was their first encounter, and always had a funny one-liner or joke up his sleeve. A man with a heart of gold, he was willing to give anyone the shirt off his back without asking for anything in return, making him a beloved member of the community.\n\nLarry enjoyed a good game of golf, bantering about Michigan State sports, reminiscing about his old cars, and singing the occasional Conway Twitty or Elvis karaoke song, but his greatest accomplishment in life was his family. No matter how busy he was, he would drop everything to make time for them, and even traveled all over the country in his motorhome to attend their graduations and weddings. He was also quite the dog lover and had many throughout the years, all of whom were always by his side.\n\nLarry was preceded in death by his father, Ernest, in 1950, his brother, Bobby, in 1962, his son, Brad, in 1994, his mother, Beatrice, in 1999, his brother, John, in 2013, his mother-in-law, Christine, in 2016 and his sister, Kay, in 2019.\n\nLarry is survived by his wife, Glenna, his daughters, Gwen (Brian), Shelly and Casey (Dan), his grandchildren, Megan (Jordan), Doug (Maddie), Max (Amanda), Rylee (Bryan) and Chandler, his great-grandchildren, Bradley and Sophia, his father-in-law, Glen, plus many other wonderful extended family members. There is one special person that deserves a shout out: KC Weldon, who was like a son to Larry and always had his back, be it day or night. You are one in a million.\n\nThere will be no funeral service, but there will be a celebration of life for family and friends on Sunday, October 15th, from 1PM to 4PM at the Fraternal Order of Eagles, 835 High St, Williamston. Make sure to bring your best memories!\n\nDonations can be made to the Roscommon County Commission on Aging - Serenity Day Lodge, 1015 Short Dr, Prudenville, MI 48651 or Ingham County Animal Control & Shelter.\n\nArrangements by Caskey-Mitchell Funeral Home, Stockbridge."
