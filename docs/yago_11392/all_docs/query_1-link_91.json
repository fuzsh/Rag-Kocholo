        "text": "I didn’t like Leslie Knope at first. Then again, who did? Leslie, played by Amy Poehler, was the heroine of “Parks and Recreation,” a half-hour comedy on NBC that debuted in 2009 to aggressively middling reviews. Most write-ups shrugged it off as a mockumentary little sister to “The Office,” with which it shared a creative team. Even critics who liked it side-eyed Leslie. “Deluded” came up a lot when they described her. So did “ditsy.” The New York Times compared her to the “women who volunteer to look foolish on reality shows.”\n\nThat call was also coming from inside the house. A midlevel bureaucrat working at the Parks Department in fictional Pawnee, Ind., the Leslie of the pilot was a woman of energy, determination and zero discernment. “It’s a great time to be a woman in politics,” she says. “Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi.” In its truncated first season, the show played her ambition for cringe-watch laughs. “This could be my Hoover Dam!” she says of her promise to transform a ditch into a green space.\n\nPoehler is an actress as irresistible as sheet cake. But lines like that made me squirm. Mostly because Leslie reminded me of me: bossy, eager for approval, a bit of a know-it-all. As a teenager I was a go-getter: a class president, then a student body president and a Junior Statesman of America (since renamed Junior State, thank God) who collected A.P. classes like they were Beanie Babies. And a lot of that pushiness has followed me into adulthood.\n\nWhich is to say that I found Leslie annoying and unlikable in most of the ways that I have worried I am annoying and unlikable, even as I have also worried that a concern with likability is just another way that women keep themselves down. That Leslie was romantically paired early on with one character who clearly disliked her, Paul Schneider’s Mark, and another with whom she had a punishing lack of chemistry, Louis C.K.’s Dave, didn’t help. (Yeah, the C.K. episodes are unwatchable now.) Neither did Leslie’s dowdy pantsuits.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
