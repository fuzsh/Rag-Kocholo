        "text": "“I love you and I like you” is a deceptively simple message that epitomizes the couple at the heart of Parks And Recreation. Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) use this phrase in their wedding vows to remind each other of an undemanding fact: They see each other for who they are and genuinely accept it, warts quirks and all. Ben and Leslie do something unique throughout their relationship: They never attempt to change each other. There’s only unfettered support, trust, horniness, and political dreams aplenty. The dynamic is unlikely yet believably wholesome, a word that also nicely describes the NBC comedy itself, which premiered exactly 15 years ago today. (Earlier this week, we did a rundown of our favorite moments from the show to celebrate the milestone.)\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a Parks And Rec without Scott, whose addition in late season two transformed the trajectory of Greg Daniels’ series. The romance starts with angry banter (a closed-off Ben is there to lay off Leslie’s beloved coworkers, after all) before they seamlessly bond over a wallflower mural, a Harvest Festival, and a desire to run for office. A million such cute, considerate details form their relationship’s crux, and thankfully, there’s no needless drama or forced fights. Instead, they make it a priority to understand and show up for each other in realistic ways.\n\nThe couple competition is fierce, even within Parks—Andy and April! Ron and Diane!—along with a litany of other cherished pairings from shows like I Love Lucy, Friends, How I Met Your Mother, Black-ish, and Schitt’s Creek. And that’s not to mention partners from other big Daniels projects, notably The Office’s Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer). However, Ben and Leslie’s arc surpasses them all, because, against all odds, they prove it’s possible to thrive on radical optimism. (SC’s David and Patrick are a close second on that front.)\n\nThe wisest thing Parks writers did was not drag out their will-they-won’t-they beyond a few episodes because their attraction is undeniable. It’s “crush at first sight” for Ben and Leslie, even if they don’t admit it directly. He’d rather ask her for a beer mid-argument before noon and confess his Ice Clown history. And she’d prefer listening to an unsexy playlist when they’re taking a road trip. Thankfully, they jump to a first kiss and secret dates pretty quickly.\n\nThere are a few hurdles in the relationship, too, with Ben and Leslie facing other cursory challenges: a workplace relationship with different power dynamics, Leslie’s Pawnee council run, and Ben pressuring himself to stay away from the woman of his dreams, to name a few. But even those hardships end fairly fast in season four’s “Smallest Park,” in which the two reunite in perhaps Parks’ most adorable scene. (Fun fact: Chelsea Peretti wrote that delightful episode.) Or maybe the loveliest moment comes when they confess their love via the snide Ethel Beavers. There’s something poetic about the late, great Helen Slayton-Hughes being the one to recite their first “I love you.”\n\nFrom here on out, Parks And Recreation keeps their dynamic incredibly fun and painless. They’re so satisfyingly grounded even as they climb the ladder of Indiana government before moving on to Washington, D.C. with loftier career goals. Political rivalry, long distance, and raising triplets could’ve been prime fodder for quarrels. A lot of other famous sitcom couples have fought for less. That may be relatable, too, but Parks got how important it is to see two committed people be respectful, loving, and hilarious together. So what if her ex rolls into town, if Jeremy Jamm (Jon Glaser) is a nuisance on their wedding day, or if Ben gets offered a job in a different city? We as viewers know they’ll get through it because they’re so clearly made for each other. (Besides, what other couple’s turn-ons include mac-and-cheese pizza and filibustering in roller skates?)\n\nFifteen years after its arrival, there’s a good chance some of the show’s political stances don’t hold up upon rewatch. A far-too-cheerful government employee like Leslie, who can barely contain herself at the sight of Joe Biden, now feels dated. Still, even back then, Parks had figured out how to balance her vivid enthusiasm with a practical Ben. He kept her calm, she enlivened his personality, and together they helped transform the sitcom. Parks And Rec needed them just as much as they needed each other. As he puts it in those vows, he traveled to 46 cities in 11 years, wandering around everywhere looking for her. Once they found each other, Parks ensured they never let go."
