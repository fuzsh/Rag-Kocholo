Utilizing the Predictive Index Assessment Suite has provided us with the tools needed to match candidates to the right jobs during this tough talent recession.”\n\nThe Predictive Index and Amy Leslie have been by far, our best investment made this year. We’ve struggled with turnover in our industry because the demands of our positions are very unique. Operating a service driven company that is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week takes a special individual. We knew this was the perfect tool and just what we needed to accomplish our goals of hiring the right candidates and retaining key performers. Helping our Leadership team initiate personal growth for each individual has been an amazing asset we are currently adopting. ​ I’m very excited to share this new tool we’ve adopted with our other business partners so they too can benefit from this amazing tool as well."
