I’m Dr. Amy Leslie - athlete, mother, connector, supporter, Canadian. Most importantly, I am a doctor who is deeply passionate about the well being of my clients, quality of life, and their ability to do the things they love. My career as a former professional figure skater, training in sports medicine, and journey through pregnancy into motherhood, I have developed a keen sense of body mechanics and am intimately aware of the spine’s potential for movement, strength and grace as well as the injuries and physical changes that result from a body reaching it’s edge.\n\nMy promise to you is to provide the attention, touch, and tools for your body to heal naturally through a holistic approach to chiropractic care based on three pillars: adjustments, facial muscular therapy, and rehab exercises. Different from most “rack ‘em and crack ‘em” chiropractors, I will always meet you where you are by customizing each visit and treatment plan for your specific needs and goals. Together, we will attend to your body in ways that produce results for living a physically active, healthy and vibrant life with the ability to partake in the activities that bring you joy."
