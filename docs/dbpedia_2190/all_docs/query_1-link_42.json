        "text": "Free (but donations gratefully accepted!)\n\nWelcome to “Dream Boston,” a future vision of our city that is somewhere between dream and reality.\n\nThrough short audio plays, Dream Boston asks local playwrights to imagine favorite locations, landmarks, and their friends in a future Boston, when we can once again meet and connect in our city. These micro-plays take place at locations such as the MIT Great Dome on the 4th of July while the sounds of the “1812 Overture” float in the background, at the Boston Public Library where a librarian and library patron debate the ethics of reserving a book, and a not-so-perfect first date on the edge of the Boston Common.\n\nSupported in part by a grant from the Richard K. Lubin Family Foundation."
