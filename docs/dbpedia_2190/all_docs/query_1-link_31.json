        "text": "IN the final moments of the second episode of ''Boston Public,'' the Fox series about an urban high school, the camera finds a vice principal named Scott Guber bent over his office desk well into the night. Tie loosened, brow creased, reading glasses perched down his nose, Guber pores over the class rosters and staff lists arrayed in a puddle of lamplight. Only the arrival of the principal, with a gentle order to go home, dispels his concentration.\n\n''We need more teachers,'' he tells the principal, Steven Harper. ''We're up to 29 students a class. How can we survive that?''\n\nTo which Harper replies in weary fellowship, ''There's only so much we can do in a day.'' As the two men shuffle toward the exit door, they find a waiting parent, upset about the school's dress code, and return with her to the office.\n\nThe succeeding episode of ''Boston Public'' opens with the same Scott Guber teaching what appears to be a civics class. As he lectures about honesty, several pupils look past him to the windows and begin to snicker. Guber turns to discover the source of their amusement. A frail boy is being dangled upside-down off the school roof by unseen tormentors.\n\nThose two set pieces demonstrate what is promising and maddening, in nearly equal measure, about David E. Kelley's series, at least to a viewer like me who approaches it not merely as entertainment but as an attempt to accurately reckon with public education. ''Boston Public'' strikes me as a show deeply divided against itself, as capable of subtle acuity in the first instance as manipulative excess in the second. How can a series that gets it so right simultaneously get it so wrong?\n\nAdmittedly, a fictional series makes no promise of documentary realism and should not be held to a cinema verite standard. Still, the first half-dozen episodes suggest that the show very much wants to affect public opinion about public education. It had its premiere during a presidential campaign in which both Al Gore and George W. Bush debated how to improve America's schools, by reinvestment or vouchers, and at a time when no less a national figure than Roy Romer, the former governor of Colorado and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assumed the position of school superintendent in Los Angeles. Against such a backdrop, popular culture's portrayal of education, particularly in an overcrowded, underfinanced city school, serves as both a mirror and a shaper of civic opinion.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
