        "text": "Boston Public is an American drama television series created by David E. Kelley and broadcast on Fox. It centered on Winslow High School, a fictional public high school located in Boston, Massachusetts. The show was named for the real public school district in which it takes place. It featured a large ensemble cast and focused on the work and private lives of the various teachers, students, and administrators at the school. It aired from October 2000 to January 2004. Its slogan was \"Every day is a fight. For respect. For dignity. For sanity.\"\n\nLa vita professionale e privata del corpo insegnanti della Winslow High School, un liceo della periferia di Boston. Ogni giorno alle prese con i problemi degli studenti, i professori del liceo affrontano con dedizione e coraggio una delle professioni più difficili. Fra di loro c'è il Preside Steven Harper, severo ma comprensivo, il Vice-Preside Scott Guber, il \"nazista\" che in ogni modo cerca di far rispettare le regole, Ronnie Cooke, un'avvocatessa che ha deciso di abbandonare la pratica forense per fare l'insegnante, Harry Senate, il professore che insegna ai piani bassi del Liceo e si fa sempre coinvolgere personalmente nelle vite dei suoi allievi, Marla Hendricks, una donna generosa ma con problemi di instabilità, Marilyn Sudor, l'insegnante di musica apprezzata per il suo talento ma anche per il suo aspetto fisico, Danny Hanson, un uomo dal carattere rissoso che ha deciso di adottare la nipote e Harvey Lipschultz, un professore oramai ottantenne che, oltre ad insegnarla, ha fatto anche la storia. Dal creatore di The Practice, Ally McBeal e Chicago Hope, un vero e proprio spaccato sulla vita sugli adulti che ogni giorno si confrontano con gli adolescenti."
