        "text": "Fall 2012\n\nPolitical Animal\n\nNot only did director-producer Thomas Schlamme create the signature “walk and talk” style of The West Wing, he has also been a powerful advocate for the rights of episodic directors.\n\nBY AMY DAWES\n\nPhotographed by Scott Council\n\nPolitics, media and comedy have become so entwined that it’s hard to remember a time when we didn’t have fly-on-the-wall, fast-paced, behind-the-scenes television series like The West Wing, Sports Night and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip to show us how it looks from the inside. Director Thomas Schlamme had a role in all three.\n\nThough his groundbreaking style would push the camera where it hadn’t gone before, Schlamme started in the business as a decided outsider, directing concert films (Bette Midler) and comedy specials (Robert Klein, Whoopi Goldberg), before moving into episodic television (Mad About You, It’s Garry Shandling’s Show), directing pilots (Parenthood, Mr. Sunshine, Pan Am), and a long-lasting collaboration directing and executive producing three shows with Aaron Sorkin. In his worldview, absurdity and profundity mingle easily, allowing him to move freely from comedy to drama—a factor in his receiving unprecedented DGA Award nominations in 1999 in both categories (and winning for Sports Night).\n\nSchlamme says he remains committed to developing politically-oriented material, citing the 2004 dramatic series Jack & Bobby (he directed an episode and executive produced), about how two teenage brothers are molded by their life experiences, turning one into a future U.S. president. His latest project is a potential series about the men who developed the atomic bomb at the Los Alamos Laboratory and their dawning realization of the impact the weapon would have on the world.\n\nWhen we met in his Shoe Money Productions office on the Sony Pictures lot, Schlamme was recovering from recent knee surgery and eager to get back on the basketball court. He spoke frequently about on-set politics, and his commitment to protecting the creative rights of episodic directors as a longtime member of the DGA National Board, Western Directors Council, and Television Creative Rights Committee. We began by discussing how one handles a fictional depiction of the most political territory of all—the White House.\n\nAMY DAWES: Let’s get right into the pilot for The West Wing. There’s a memorable tracking shot near the beginning when chief of staff Leo McGarry (John Spencer) arrives at work and we follow him through the White House while everyone greets him and he interacts until he reaches his desk and sits down with the senior staff. That established the look of the show and what became known as the “walk and talk” style.\n\nTHOMAS SCHLAMME: It was actually many shots, and it was done on two different sets that weren’t even connected. The whole thing was worked out and choreographed in rehearsal. It did become the visual signature for the show, even Aaron says that.\n\nQ: How did you arrive at that style?\n\nA: It had to do with the energy I felt in Aaron’s writing, and the idea that everything that was happening in the White House was important. It was a way to express what this institution should feel like—that it never stops. In rehearsal, I discovered that we never had to stop. Rather than do a scene in one room, then stop, and cut to another scene, we could keep it going. It all had to be coordinated between our production designer Jon Hutman, DP Tom Del Ruth, and the sound guys, so that we could shoot every which way, and get through doorways from one room into another room. We used a lot of glass walls that weren’t fixed, they had to be able to be tilted so that if you were getting a kick [light flare] you could adjust it. The thing is, there is so much information in every episode, and when the characters are walking, they’re getting it from all sides. But you’ll notice, in some moments there is some coverage—they’ll come to a stop, or turn—and that’s to let the audience know that here, this is information you need to hold onto. It’s all choreographed to the storytelling. It’s driven by the material, as opposed to, ‘Oh, walk and talk is the style, so that’s what everybody should be doing.’.\n\nQ: Why did you build the White House on two unconnected sets?\n\nA: Because it was way too big. We were a new series, and a pilot at that, so Warner Bros. was never going to give us Stage 23, which is the big film stage. After the first year, we convinced them. We said, ‘It’ll save us time, let us build the largest television set ever.’ But for the pilot, we had to cut and move to a different stage across the street. Then the actors had to pick it up at that exact same pace and energy level so that the action appeared to be continuous.\n\nQ: How did you direct Martin Sheen as the president?\n\nA: Martin is so friendly and warm that what I had to work on with him was getting him to be dangerous. Because at the bottom of it all, it has to be ‘don’t fuck with this guy.’ He’s the president, and he got here for a reason. In the episode ‘Noel’ in season two, there’s a scene where Bradley Whitford screams at him, and that’s a line you just cannot cross with the president. All Martin wanted to do was be compassionate to the character, as opposed to rage, which was what I wanted from him—the idea of, ‘I don’t care what the reason is, this is unacceptable.’ That was very hard for Martin to convey. We wound up just doing it with a look.\n\nAs director-producer, Schlamme forged a close partnership with writer-producer Aaron Sorkin on the show. (Photo: Everett).\n\nQ: Do you think it would be possible to do a network drama set in the White House today?\n\nA: I honestly don’t know. I think The West Wing hit at a moment in time that was just right for that show. We were just ending a century and going into a new one, and that engendered a certain amount of hope. The truth is, NBC held the show back for a year, because of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. They felt it was way too much to do a show about the White House while we were still in the middle of that. So I probably owe my career as much to Monica Lewinsky as to anyone, because otherwise I would have been just starting Sports Night, and someone else would have gotten The West Wing. As it turned out, Aaron and I built this great trust by doing Sports Night together, and after that, no one else was going to do The West Wing.\n\nQ: Let’s talk about your roots and how you got into this business. Did you have any idea, growing up in Houston, Texas, that you wanted to be a director?\n\nA: It never dawned on me. I didn’t get to watch too much television as a kid—my father was very strict about it. He was in the retail business, and all I knew was that I wasn’t going to stay there and do that. Probably, the way I ended up in this business was because of air-conditioning. I was a big jock in high school; it was Houston, hot and humid, and tough to do two-a-day practices in football. The theater department had the only air-conditioned class. I met someone there, a teacher called Cecil Pickett, who was enormously influential. And from that point on, I started to formulate what I wanted to do.\n\nQ: What did you learn from him that stuck with you?\n\nA: He’d really break stuff down: ‘What’s going on here? What is this play really about? What’s this guy saying?’ He really unlocked something for me. There’s not a day that goes by when I direct that he isn’t in my brain. By the time I got to college [at the University of Texas in Austin], I was going to movies every night, and I began to understand that people did this for a living.\n\nSchlamme, with John Spencer as chief of staff, tailored his fluid shooting style on The West Wing to fit the material. (Photo: Photofest).\n\nQ: After college you set out for New York to become a filmmaker. Was it a struggle to find your way?\n\nA: Oh, for years and years. The first time, I ran out of money and went back home. I got a job making industrial films in Houston; I was kind of the freak in the back room. When I got back to New York, I drove a cab, and I’d never even driven in New York before. I kept looking for work, knocking on doors. I think I sent out 105 resumes and got one response. I worked as a production assistant on a couple of films and, finally, I got a job at an animation studio as an editor. After that, work begat work. I got into directing music videos and commercials. I eventually got my break shooting a concert film for Bette Midler in 1984. Some of the guys I worked with on that, I’ve continued to work with through the years.\n\nQ: Do you have any personal traits that made you well suited for directing?\n\nA: I’m a voyeur. I say that with no embarrassment. If I could have a superpower, being invisible would be it, no question. I’m fascinated by human behavior; observing people and seeing how much story gets told without a lot of dialogue, and how much our brain fills in. Also, I’m not an introvert, and I think that was a leg up, especially when I was doing episodic. I could go in among strangers and not worry about what they were thinking of me. I’m engaged, I’m interested in other people. I think that’s just as important as knowing how to do the job.\n\nQ: Early in your career you worked with comedians such as Garry Shandling, John Leguizamo, Whoopi Goldberg and Tracey Ullman. What did you learn from them?\n\nA: I learned what it’s like to work with people who have singular visions. That helped me, over the years, to work with writers who felt just as protective of their material. The muscle I had to develop was to get comics to trust me. There’s nothing harder than stand-up comedy. You’re being judged every 30 seconds. If there are no laughs, it’s not a good show. I learned how vulnerable people are and how sensitive one should be to it, so that I could say, ‘I’m actually here as an ally, not as somebody who wants to take this from you and turn it into something else.’ The other thing was recognizing the way they saw the world, the absurdity of it. I love to laugh, but my brain would say, ‘There’s also a lot of drama in there, and there’s a way you can get that across.’ That’s what I was always looking for, and it was easy for me to balance those.\n\nQ: When Sports Night and The West Wing were on the air at the same time, you were nominated for DGA Awards for both comedy and dramatic series in the same year. How unusual was it for a director to be working in both genres at once?\n\nA: It wasn’t really done in television. It was certainly done in features. That’s why Sydney Pollack was someone I admired. He could do Tootsie, but he could also do Absence of Malice. Michael Ritchie was a director that I absolutely loved—the first Bad News Bears was so dark, interesting and funny. And Robert Altman, too.\n\nQ: You’ve mentioned Altman in other interviews. How did his work influence you?"
