        "text": "\"Boston Public\" Season Finale Talkback (spoilers)\n\nUsually we don't talk about Boston Public on the boards, but at the big turn-out for the \"Anybody Watch Boston Public?\" thread I thought it would be great to talk about the season finale.\n\nI'm headed to bed so I'll be back tomorrow with my thoughts but have at it everybody! I even put up a poll!\n\nI thought it was great that right before Senate regained consciousness, the brother on trial got to see that his little brother was about to testify against him. The shocked look in his eyes was priceless. It's not like he didn't deserve it; he was clearly comfortable ruining his little brother's life if it meant he could dodge the law for a few more minutes. I wonder if that brief visual exchange between the two brothers will have an effect on future episodes. Whatever it is, I'm sure it won't be anything major -- the big brother's in frikkin jail.\n\n-Terminatah\n\nThe episode pretty much unfolded the way I had thought it would. I never thought that Senate would die. The only question I had was would the scene in the teaser where he flatlines and they try to revive him be the cliffhanging ending? I was glad they wrapped that up in this episode, but over all, it was pretty predictable. Except for Lauren asking Guber to sleep with her! That's the most shocking thing I've seen recently aside from r2-d2 flying!\n\nYeah, that bit with Scott & Lauren was pretty...well, shocking. And the fact that she didn't renig on her offer after Harry was going to be fine.\n\nI do wish there had been a bit more of a...hanger...at the end. I still have left over disappointment from a couple of finales (X-Files & Ally McBeal) I've seen so far...\n\nI was just going to ask for a talkback section and before I could, here it is. When Boston Public starts Season 3, would it be possible to start feedback threads??\n\nAnyway, I also enjoyed last night's episode. I wouldn't have be surprised if Senate died because the actor who plays Senate is in the new movie Insomnia (I figured maybe he wanted to focus on movies).\n\nThere was a cliffhanger of sorts between Senate and Ronnie (is that the name of Jeri Ryan's character?). They could do a storyline where Senate gets backlashed from students for dating teachers, or something along that line. Either way, I am glad that I watched this show after a long hiatus and I will get back in the habit once Season 3 arrives.\n\nI gotta say I liked it alot. I never expected Senate to die since he's one of the major characters and his actions made many stories both funny and serious. The part with Lauren and Scott shocked me but then made me laugh (espacially Scott's joke about a release that night). And you get to see just how much Steven did care about Senate.\n\nJTurner I'm guessing you didn't see season 1 or just forgot but Senate and Lauren were going out and nearly the whole school knew.\n\nIs Lauren the woman who used to be a nun?? If so, then yes I know. What I mean is that if the students know that Senate is going out with yet another teacher, maybe that could turn into a storyline.\n\nI started watching when they had the episode where the cheerleaders were doing stripper-like routines and I stopped when Senate was protecting that kid who killed someone (the kid was in the choir I believe). I remember that he was going to leave the city, but got killed. Senate was seen crying while \"Killing Me Softly\" was playing. Since then, I haven't had the chance to keep up."
