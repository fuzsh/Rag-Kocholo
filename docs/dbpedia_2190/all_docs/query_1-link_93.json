        "text": "In a raucous high school classroom a teacher has left a message on the board: ''Gone to kill myself. Hope you're happy!'' The teacher sent to replace her complains: ''I can't even get them to turn off their boom boxes. They're animals.'' He has no room to talk; he is being blackmailed by a pretty blond student with whom he has been in a compromising situation.\n\nMeanwhile a student with a future as the next Matt Drudge is terrorizing the faculty by posting satiric cartoons on her Web site, including one of a teacher with his head in a horse's rear end. She says she is protected by the First Amendment and knows she won't be sued, anyway. ''Sure, you're going to go out and hire a lawyer on a teacher's salary,'' she tells one of her victims.\n\nThe school in ''Boston Public'' may look achingly familiar, with its institutional green walls and rows of lockers. But beneath its conventional surface, David E. Kelley's daring, lively new series charts nothing less than a reversal of power from the days when teachers held it all. The student's Web site is more than a high-tech way of scribbling insults on the blackboard. It symbolizes a new social order that Mr. Kelley has astutely latched onto, an information age in which the young have power and money yet need guidance as never before.\n\n''Boston Public'' becomes the third Kelley series on the air now, along with ''The Practice'' and ''Ally McBeal.'' Combining elements of both, it leans heavily toward the shrewd realism of ''The Practice'' yet includes touches of the ''Ally'' exaggeration and whimsy.\n\nAnd it relies on what Mr. Kelley does best: getting inside the minds of his characters. He manages that with deceptive ease by presenting the show from the teachers' point of view. We eavesdrop on problems that didn't exist a generation ago, as these teachers wonder how to handle gay-bashing and gripe about being hamstrung by a fear of lawsuits.\n\nA series needs characters and drama, of course, not just topics for discussion. Here ''Boston Public'' owes a great deal to Chi McBride, who plays the principal, Steven Harper, the most put-upon character. Trying to balance the policies that control chaos with a deep humanity that keeps him going, he deals with the school's enormous mix of races and classes, bullies and prima donnas (and that's just his staff). In a fury Harper is capable of pushing a belligerent student against a locker, though he is more likely to visit a student in the emergency room.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
