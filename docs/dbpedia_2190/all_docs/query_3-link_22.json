        "text": "It's time to check in with the State of the Market. Today's guest is Kevin Higgins. Kevin shares his past experiences, what moved him to Las Vegas, and his favorite dish in this episode. In this clip, Kevin shares what he thinks about the first quarter of 2024. As always, I ask him what he would score it, Barstool Prez style, and while he doesn't give it a perfect 10, there are some reasons for that. üåü Interest in Las Vegas is booming ‚Äì Las Vegas continues to attract a diverse range of businesses and residents, thanks to its market and location. üîÑ The pace has shifted ‚Äì Deals are on the table, but they're taking longer to close. Whether it's leases or sales, the decision-making process has extended, and getting those final signatures is proving to be challenging. üí° The takeaway? ‚Äì Patience is key. We're still moving, still shaking. The interest is there, and so are the opportunities. It‚Äôs all about nudging those almost-there deals across the finish line. If you're looking to make a move or need insights into the market, my team and I are here to help. Send Kevin or me a DM and we'll be happy to answer.
