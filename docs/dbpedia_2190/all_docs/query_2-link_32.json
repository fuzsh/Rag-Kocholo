Our team works out of Washington, DC, Texas, and remotely across the country to bring about our vision of a healthy regulatory and physical environment.\n\nLeadership\n\nJen Duggan\n\nExecutive Director\n\nJen is a veteran environmental attorney who served as Deputy Director and Managing Attorney at EIP before becoming Executive Director in May 2024, with the retirement of founder Eric Schaeffer. Jen has brought successful litigation requiring EPA to limit toxic discharges from coal plants for the first time; developed and litigated cases requiring clean up of three coal ash landfills; and persuaded a state environmental agency to withdraw construction permits for two waste coal power plants. Prior to joining EIP, Jen was the Vice President and Director of Conservation Law Foundation Vermont where she launched a successful regional campaign to secure state drinking water regulations for toxic “forever chemicals.” She also led efforts to pass three “strongest in the nation” state laws to protect drinking water and reduce single-use plastic. Before that, Jen served as the General Counsel for the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, where she led the Office of General Counsel and oversaw the delivery of legal services for the Central Office and Departments of Environmental Conservation, Fish and Wildlife, and Forests, Parks, and Recreation. Jen graduated magna cum laude from Vermont Law School and also earned a Master of Studies in Environmental Law.\n\nEmail: jduggan [at] environmentalintegrity [dot] org\n\nJen Abdella\n\nDirector of Operations and Development\n\nJen brings over two decades of experience in non-profit leadership, environmental law, and ecology.
