        "text": "The Practice is an American legal drama created by David E. Kelley centring on the partners and associates at a Boston law firm that aired on ABC (GoAnimate in Real Life). The series was broadcast for all 8 seasons from 1997 to 2004, initially as a mid-season replacement. The Practice won many Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Drama Series in 1998 and 1999. As part of the fictional universe in which many shows produced by David E. Kelley are set The Practice had crossover story arcs with Gideon's Crossing, Boston Public, and Ally McBeal in addition to its own more jovial spin-off series Boston Legal, which was broadcast from 2004 to 2008.\n\nThe Practice focused on the law firm of Robert Donnell and Associates (later becoming Donnell, Young, Dole, & Frutt, and ultimately Young, Frutt, & Berluti). Plots typically featured the firm's involvement in various high-profile criminal and civil cases that often mirrored current events at the time of the episodes' initial broadcast. Conflict between legal ethics and personal morality was a recurring theme. The series was originally broadcast from March 4, 1997 to May 9, 2004.\n\nProduction Companies[]\n\nDavid E.
