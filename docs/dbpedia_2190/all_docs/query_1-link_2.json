Kelley and broadcast on Fox. Set in Boston, the series centers on Winslow High School, a fictional public high school in the Boston Public Schools district. It features a large ensemble cast and focuses on the work and private lives of the various teachers, students, and administrators at the school. It aired from October 2000 to January 2004. Its slogan was \"Every day is a fight. For respect. For dignity. For sanity.\"[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBoston Public initially preceded Ally McBeal on Monday nights. However, Fox moved it to the Friday night death slot for its fourth season.[2] Viewership declined as a result and it was canceled after the 13th episode aired on January 30, 2004. Production halted after the 15th episode was completed. The final two episodes aired on March 1 and 2, 2005, later in syndication on TV One.[3] Neither episode wrapped up any character stories.\n\nThe title of each episode was a numbered chapter, similar to that in a high school textbook, and each character appeared in a given story arc, with the professional and personal lives often intersecting.\n\nBoston Public was the winner of the 2002 Peabody Award (\"Chapter Thirty-Seven\") from the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia.[4]\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nActor Character Seasons Role Chi McBride Steven Harper 1–4 Principal Anthony Heald Scott Guber 1–4 Vice Principal Jessalyn Gilsig Lauren Davis 1–2 Social Studies teacher; left Winslow to teach at a private school Nicky Katt Harry Senate 1–3 (episodes 1–49) Teacher of \"the Dungeon\"; quit in episode 49 Loretta Devine Marla Hendricks 1–4 Social Studies teacher Sharon Leal Marilyn Sudor 1–4 English teacher and music instructor Fyvush Finkel Harvey Lipschultz 1–4 History teacher Rashida Jones Louisa Fenn 1–2 Secretary Thomas McCarthy Kevin Riley 1 (episodes 1–13; special guest appearance in episode 18) Football coach; fired in episode 13 Joey Slotnick Milton Buttle 1 (episodes 1–13; special guest appearance in episode 15) English teacher; fired in episode 13 Kathy Baker Meredith Peters 1–2; recurring in season 1 Teacher Jeri Ryan Ronnie Cooke 2–4 Teacher; assistant vice principal (end of season 3); guidance counselor (season 4) Michael Rapaport Danny Hanson 2–4 Teacher China Jesusita Shavers Brooke Harper 2–3; recurring in season 2 Student Jon Abrahams Zach Fischer 3 Physics teacher Joey McIntyre Colin Flynn 3 English Teacher Michelle Monaghan Kimberly Woods 3 (episodes 49–57; not featured in opening credits but receives \"also starring\" billing) Teacher; transferred to a school in another state to avoid a dangerous, obsessed student in episode 57 Cara DeLizia Marcy Kendall 2–3 (not featured in opening credits but receives \"also starring\" billing); guest during season 2 Principal's assistant and student Natalia Baron Carmen Torres 4 Physics teacher\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nBoston Public ran for four seasons, consisting of 81 episodes. Each season contained 22 episodes, except the fourth season which had 15 episodes due to cancellation.[5]\n\nCrossover with The Practice\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: The Practice § Crossovers\n\nIn The Practice episode, \"The Day After\" (season 5, episode 14), Kevin Riley asks Ellenor Frutt to represent him in a school board meeting when he's fired from Winslow High School, which takes place in the Boston Public episode \"Chapter Thirteen\" (season 1, episode 13). After Boston Public was canceled, Chi McBride reprised the role of Steven Harper on an episode of The Practice spin-off series Boston Legal in the episode \"Let Sales Ring\" (season 1, episode 16).\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nBoston Public received a total of 31 nominations from various award ceremonies, and won 8 of them.[6]\n\nAwards won\n\n[edit]\n\nEmmy Awards\n\nOutstanding Art Direction for a Single Camera Series (2001)\n\nNAACP Image Awards\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series – Loretta Devine (2001, 2003–2004)\n\nPeabody Awards\n\nPeabody Award for Episode \"Chapter Thirty-Seven\"[7]\n\nYoung Artist Awards\n\nBest Performance in a TV Series – Guest Starring Young Actor – Thomas Dekker (2004)\n\nNominations\n\n[edit]\n\nEmmy Awards\n\nOutstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series – Kathy Baker (2001)\n\nNAACP Image Awards\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series – Rashida Jones (2002)\n\nOutstanding Actress in a Drama Series – Loretta Devine (2002)\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series – Vanessa Bell Calloway (2002)\n\nOutstanding Drama Series (2002–2004)\n\nTelevision Critics Association Awards\n\nIndividual Achievement in Drama – Chi McBride (2001)\n\nYoung Artist Awards\n\nBest Performance in a TV Drama Series – Guest Starring Young Actress – Ashley Tisdale (2001)\n\nBest Family TV Drama Series (2002)\n\nBest Performance in a TV Series – Guest Starring Young Actor – Miko Hughes (2004)\n\nTeen Choice Awards\n\nChoice TV Breakout Star Female – Tamyra Gray (2003)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
