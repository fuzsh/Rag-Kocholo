        "meta_description": "\"Dignity isn't something you practice. You either have it or you don't.\"\r\nFrom the Emmy Award-winning creator of Ally McBeal and The Practice, comes David E. Kelley's newest series, Boston Public. The show is a dramatic, sometimes comedic, behind-the-scenes look at the personal and professional lives of teachers working at a midsize high school in Boston. At the top of the faculty chain of command is Steven Harper (Chi McBride), the strong and intimidating principal. Harper is the force behind the school's objective to make students smarter and better. From handling irate parents to confronting school bullies to settling disputes between his staff, every day brings a new challenge for Harper.\r\nAt the head of the Social Studies department is Lauren Davis (Jessalyn Gilsig), who while battling it out with students has to avoid the advances of fellow administrator, Scott Guber (Anthony Heald), the stern and formidable vice principal. Other faculty members include: Harvey Lipschultz (Fyvush Finkel), the 80-year-old history teacher who longs for the past; Marilyn Sudor (Sharon Leal), the music teacher most of the male students want to sleep with; Harry Senate (Nicky Katt), the rebellious geology teacher known for his unusual teaching tactics; Marla Hendricks (Loretta Devine), the special education teacher who needs a medication cocktail to make it through the day; and Louisa Fenn (Rashida Jones), the school Secretary/Assistant to the Principal; and most recently, Ronnie Cooke (Jeri Ryan), the successful lawyer, who switches careers in order to teach at Winslow High.",
