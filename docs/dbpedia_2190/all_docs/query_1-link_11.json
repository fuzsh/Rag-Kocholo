        "text": "Post by Bob on\n\nBoston Public\n\nBoston Public was an American drama television series created by David E. Kelley and broadcast on Fox. Set in Boston, the series centres on Winslow High School, a fictional public high school in the Boston Public Schools district. It features a large ensemble cast and focuses on the work and private lives of the various teachers, students, and administrators at the school. It aired from October 2000 to January 2004. Its slogan was \"Every day is a fight. For respect. For dignity. For sanity.\n\nBoston Public initially preceded Ally McBeal on Monday nights, became revered and received critical acclaim for its drama and ethnically diverse cast. However, Fox moved it to the Friday night death slot for its fourth season. Viewership declined as a result and it was canceled after the 13th episode aired on January 30, 2004. Production halted after the 15th episode was completed. The final two episodes aired on March 1 and 2, 2005 later in syndication on TV One. Neither episode wrapped up any character stories.\n\nThe title of each episode was a numbered chapter, similar to that in a high school textbook, and each character appeared in a given story arc, with the professional and personal lives often intersecting.\n\nBoston Public was the winner of the 2002 Peabody Award (\"Chapter Thirty-Seven\") from the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Public\n\nChris appeared in Chapter 9. The synopsis was -\n\nThe first day back at school has barely begun when the police show up looking for a murder suspect. A botched robbery has gone down a few blocks away and the panicked assailant, wearing a Winslow High letterman's jacket, shot and killed a man before heading towards school grounds.\n\nChris played Neil Mavromates, the student who'd accidentally killed someone in the botched robbery.\n\nThis is the part with Chris in it.\n\nPost by capsbestgirl on\n\nLali said:\n\nOkay, I watched what happened, but I donâ€™t understand why he did it? What he wanted? if anyone knows please tell me what happened\n\nNo idea. Did the script writers get round to explaining why a high school student was involved in an armed robbery?\n\nMe either. Perhaps it's explored in later episodes, I've only ever seen this one."
