Click here to access our Movement Break Library.\n\nThis summer, BPS Moves Together held our first Wellness Wednesday events for families in Boston! The community came together to play, learn about the value of daily movement, and connect with our amazing team that distributed physical activity equipment for youth who participated in the events.
