        "text": "Game of Thrones director Alex Graves has been chosen by Sony Pictures to direct its live-action Mulan movie and we have a sneaking suspicion it's going to be a bloodbath quite different to Disney's 1998 animated version.\n\nIndeed, it's also highly likely it'll be in another ballpark to Disney's upcoming live-action version of Mulan - both Sony and Disney are adapting the story, confusingly.\n\nRelated: Game of Thrones season 7 release date, spoilers, cast and everything you need to know\n\nSony's take will be based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, the young female warrior who joins the Chinese Imperial Army, taking her ill father's spot.\n\nAccording to Deadline, Sony's version is being designed for the international marketplace. It'll be co-produced with the Chinese, with a Chinese lead, and will be done through Sony Pictures International Productions.\n\nThe Sony film is said to be in the very, very early stages of development with a script from Jason Keller - the writer of Mirror Mirror. It's going to be produced by Doug Belgrad.\n\nRelated: Disney has three things banned from all its movies, says Pete's Dragon director\n\nIn a world of whitewashing, the important news (beyond the fact there are two competing films, obviously) is that both studios are looking to cast Asian actors.\n\nAlex Graves's TV credits range from Homeland and Bloodline to Shameless, with his Game of Thrones episodes including 'The Rains of Castamere' and 'The Mountain and the Viper' (we've still not forgiven him for this one).\n\nWe're excited to see both adaptations of Mulan, though we'll be seriously disappointed if the wonderful Mu-Shu doesn't feature in at least one of them - enjoy his best moments here:"
