        "text": "Full List\n\nThe 101 Best Written TV Series list was announced on June 2, 2013. The writing credits noted are based on that date.\n\n1 THE SOPRANOS\n\nCreated by David Chase\n\nA mobster in therapy, having problems with his mother,\" was how The Sopranos initially sparked, according to creator David Chase, though he was thinking about the premise for a feature film.\n\n2 SEINFELD\n\nCreated by Larry David & Jerry Seinfeld\n\nAt the end of Seinfeld's run, Jerry Seinfeld commented that one of the more underrated aspects of his show was the number of its locations and sets, creating a sense of indoor-outdoor movement unusual for a multi-camera sitcom.\n\n3 THE TWILIGHT ZONE\n\nSeason One writers: Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, Robert Presnell, Jr., Rod Serling\n\nNo show in the history of television has lingered in the imagination quite like Rod Serling's anthology series, which could function both as a science fiction chiller and an issues-driven examination of human behavior and moral complexities, with climactic twists.\n\n4 ALL IN THE FAMILY\n\nDeveloped for Television by Norman Lear, Based on Till Death Do Us Part, Created by Johnny Speight\n\nAsked how he'd been able to be so controversial on All in the Family, creator Norman Lear said to the WGAW website in 2009: \"I don't really know how to explain it. It took me three years to get All in the Family on the air. Let me put it that way.\"\n\n5 M*A*S*H\n\nDeveloped for Television by Larry Gelbart\n\nM*A*S*H remains the only long-running series, comedy or drama, set around a war zone.\n\n6 THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW\n\nCreated by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns\n\nThe MTM brand, under Moore and then-husband Grant Tinker, was responsible for an iconic run of comedies (and dramas) in the 1970s, beginning with The Mary Tyler Moore Show, an updating of the workplace sitcom set at a Minneapolis TV station where Mary Richards (Moore) was a news writer and producer.\n\n7 MAD MEN\n\nCreated by Matthew Weiner\n\nMatt Weiner wrote the Mad Men pilot nearly a decade before it found a home as the first scripted drama at AMC, where the series debuted in the summer of 2007 and quickly took hold of the imagination with its evocation of Madison Avenue and the country as the turbulent 1960s dawn.\n\n8 CHEERS\n\nCreated by Glen Charles & Les Charles and James Burrows\n\nThe qualities that made The Mary Tyler Moore Show a seminal sitcom in the 1970s gave Cheers the same importance to the '80s.\n\n9 THE WIRE\n\nCreated by David Simon\n\nNo series, arguably, is more responsible for the novelistic ambitions possible for television writers now.\n\n10 THE WEST WING\n\nCreated by Aaron Sorkin\n\n\"The people who get angry at us on one Wednesday night will be standing up and cheering the next Wednesday night,\" Aaron Sorkin wrote in Written By before The West Wing premiered.\n\n11 THE SIMPSONS\n\nCreated by Matt Groening, Developed by James L. Brooks and Matt Groening and Sam Simon\n\nThe Simpsons is as ineffable as American humor gets. Among the show's landmarks (hitting 100 episodes, then 200, then 500) was the inclusion of Homer's exclamation, \"Doh!\" in the Oxford English Dictionary (\"used to comment on a foolish or stupid action, especially one's own\").\n\n12 I LOVE LUCY\n\n\"Pilot,\" Written by Jess Oppenheimer & Madelyn Pugh & Bob Carroll, Jr.\n\nThough the show won an Emmy as Best Comedy, the writers were never so honored (in fairness, the Emmy for sitcom writing didn't exist until 1955).\n\n13 BREAKING BAD\n\nCreated by Vince Gilligan\n\nCreator Vince Gilligan said he was joking with Tom Schnauz that the two former X-Files writers might have to rent an RV and cook crystal meth if their stalled Hollywood careers didn't turn around.\n\n14 THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW\n\nCreated by Carl Reiner\n\nCarl Reiner has said he based his first sitcom on his experiences as a writer on Your Show of Shows, working for temperamental star Sid Caesar while also trying to be a husband and father.\n\n15 HILL STREET BLUES\n\nCreated by Michael Kozoll and Steven Bochco\n\nLow rated in its infancy, Hill Street Blues broke as many TV storytelling rules as its ultimate success helped establish for cop shows.\n\n16 ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT\n\nCreated by Mitchell Hurwitz\n\nMitchell Hurwitz offered a glimpse into his take on the family sitcom when he spoke of his own parents' refusal to \"quietly disappear into their middle age.\"\n\n17 THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART\n\nCreated by Madeleine Smithberg, Lizz Winstead; Head Writer: Chris Kreski; Writers: Jim Earl, Daniel J. Goor, Charles Grandy, J.R. Havlan, Tom Johnson, Kent Jones, Paul Mercurio, Guy Nicolucci, Steve Rosenfield, Jon Stewart\n\nIt began as The Daily Show (hosted by Craig Kilborn) in 1996, became The Daily Show (hosted by Jon Stewart) in 1999, and is now just as often referred to as Jon Stewart as its official title, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\n\n18 SIX FEET UNDER\n\nCreated by Alan Ball\n\nAlan Ball pushed dramatic television into uncharted territory with his series about the Fishers and their Los Angeles funeral home.\n\n19 TAXI\n\nCreated by James L. Brooks and Stan Daniels and David Davis and Ed. Weinberger\n\nPost-Mary Tyler Moore Show, James L. Brooks, Stan Daniels, Ed.
