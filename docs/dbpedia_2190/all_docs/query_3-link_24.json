        "text": "The past few weeks (yes, it’s only been a few weeks) of American politics have been, as Vice President Kamala Harris said last night at a rally in Philadelphia, a “whirlwind.” At the vortex was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a lawmaker who, it has been often said, knows how to count votes. Bloomberg’s Karen Breslau read Pelosi’s new book for insights. Plus: Lessons for business leaders about when to step aside, and a hedge fund founder’s insights into Donald Trump’s campaign. If this email was forwarded to you, click here to sign up .\n\nKamala Harris’ choice of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate is the latest in a series of political acts set in motion by another woman elected from San Francisco. She also happens to have been central to President Joe Biden’s decision to drop his reelection bid. In fact, she’s been at the center of almost every big Democratic moment for decades. We are speaking, of course, of Nancy Pelosi."
