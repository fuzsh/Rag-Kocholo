        "text": "Desegregation of the Boston Public Schools was an issue in the 1950's and 1960's, but came to a head in the 1970s with the U.S. District Court decision in the case of Morgan v Hennigan (379 F.Supp 410). This decision led to the oversight of the Boston Public Schools passing into the hands of W. Arthur Garrity, the judge in the case, until the 1980s. It is commonly referred to as the busing crisis or busing in Boston or simply busing.\n\nForty years later it has been added to the Boston Public Schools curriculum. Busing changed not just Boston's public school system, but its politics, demographics and culture. Possibly nothing in Boston's twentieth century history had a greater affect on the city and its citizens."
