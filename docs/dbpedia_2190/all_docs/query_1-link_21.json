        "text": "David E. Kelley’s new series for Fox, the high school-set “Boston Public,” gets off to a compelling, but not altogether satisfying, start. There’s plenty of material in this milieu for Kelley’s elastic mind to grapple with, but it seems as if he hasn’t yet determined the true sensibility of this show. Right now, “Boston Public” has a lot of promise, but the skein doesn’t quite make it as heady or intense drama, and while there are hints he might let it loose in the future, Kelley seems to be holding back his whimsical side, focusing on the warts-and-all aspects of working in a public school. Still, the creator’s track record, and a Monday at 8 time slot where the only other drama is “7th Heaven,” means this series may have the luxury of being able to find its voice.\n\nPerhaps this premiere episode demonstrates that Kelley is better when he’s idealistic rather than cynical. His current hits are ensemble shows revolving around leads with a purity at their core: Ally McBeal, despite all evidence to the contrary, still believes in true love; Bobby, on “The Practice,” always gets to deliver great elegies to the fundamental nobility of the defense lawyer, even when his client’s a drug pusher. “Boston Public” doesn’t really have a single, central lead — Chi McBride as the principal and Jessalyn Gilsig as the young, attractive head of the social studies department form a duopoly within a talented ensemble. And while both characters are committed to their jobs, they already seem overburdened by the practical realities of an urban school.\n\nIn the first segment alone, directed with appropriate freneticism by Thomas Schlamme, McBride, as principal Steven Harper, has to deal with myriad issues: the parent of a football player who’s failing two classes and won’t be allowed to play in the big game; an old-fashioned teacher (the always amusing Kelley regular Fyvush Finkel) who can’t handle a busty student who refuses to wear a bra; a teacher (Loretta Devine) who leaves a note on her blackboard threatening suicide; a student trapped in a locker wearing only a diaper; and a student Webzine that depicts an insecure teacher (Joey Slotnick) jumping into a horse’s rear end.\n\nHarper can delegate some of these problems to his trusty lieutenant, the stern, morose Scott Guber (played by the stern — even morose-looking — Anthony Heald). Guber’s one soft spot is for Gilsig’s Lauren Davis. There’s also the football coach (Thomas McCarthy), who feeds confidential school information to his star player’s attorney, and Harry Senate (Nicky Katt), a talented teacher with extremely questionable judgment.\n\nTypically, Kelley’s not at a loss for plot possibilities, and there’s no question that, even when he’s not at the top of his game, he can be more provocative than anyone else. But with “Boston Public,” Kelley is actually too timid, landing only glancing blows, and heaping one storyline on top of another without providing any single one with depth. The conflicts here have elements of sensationalism, but they’re too superficial to be genuinely controversial, and some are just plain unconvincing. When a teacher shoots off a gun in school, and the administration defends the act to parents, Kelley’s in pure contrivance mode, and he doesn’t even make an effective point to compensate for the lack of believability.\n\nStill, as an environment where all our social ills can come to a head, where race, religion, violence and sex all come up in the natural course of events, and where the underlying purpose remains high-minded, a school seems a ripe environment for Kelley’s exploration. Here’s hoping he figures out where to take this in a hurry.\n\nTech credits are excellent."
