        "text": "Even with all of its issues, this ever-growing list of the best Netflix shows is a key reason why Netflix remains fairly high on our best streaming services list. Even when they lose something, a new title joins the ranks.\n\nNetflix original shows are some of the most talked-about, buzziest titles in television — ranging from \"Stranger Things\" and \"Wednesday\" to \"Bridgerton\" and \"Squid Game.\"\n\nWant to make the most of your account? You might want to check out our Netflix hacks: 7 tips and tricks for saving money if you're feeling like Netflix costs too darn much after the price increase. You can also check out Netflix's secret codes that can unlock new categories for you.\n\nBest Netflix shows: New picks\n\n'Evil'\n\n\"Evil\" follows a trio of investigators who probe some inexplicable phenomena on behalf of the Catholic Church. The team consists of skeptic psychologist Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers), Catholic seminary student David Acosta (Mike Colter), and Ben Shakir (Aasif Mandvi), a contractor. Together, they delve into bizarre and perplexing cases as they work to determine whether the events are rooted in supernatural or earthly origins.\n\nCast: Katja Herbers, Mike Colter, Aasif Mandvi\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nYear: 2019-2020\n\nGenre: Supernatural drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 96%\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Decameron'\n\n\"The Decameron\" is a unique comedy that's loosely based on a 14th-century Italian masterpiece. It follows a group of nobles and their servants in the opulent Villa Santa while the Black Death ravages Florence in 1348. To entertain themselves during their self-imposed quarantine, the characters take turns sharing stories that range from clever to scandalous. But as time passes and societal norms begin to erode, things very quickly devolve into a battle for survival. In addition to its period-perfect hijinks, it often features an ensemble cast of comedy stars like Tony Hale, Zosia Mamet and Saoirse-Monica Jackson in addition to its raucous stars.\n\nCast: Amar Chadha-Patel, Leila Farzad, Lou Gala\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nYear: 2024\n\nGenre: Black comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 68%\n\nWatch now\n\nBest Netflix shows: Dramas\n\n'Baby Reindeer'\n\nInspired by comedian Richard Gadd's autobiographical one-man show, this chilling miniseries explores Gadd's real-life experience with a stalker and sexual assault, but through a frequently comedic lens. After Gadd's fictionalized version of himself, Donny Dunn, gives a strange woman named Martha Scott (Jessica Gunning) a free cup of tea in a pub, she becomes unnaturally, obsessively attached to him as he feeds off of her attention and energy. As Dunn navigates his fragile comedy career, he soon realizes there's nothing innocent about her crush on him – or the lengths she might go to make him \"hers.\"\n\nCast: Richard Gadd, Jessica Gunning, Nava Mau\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nYear: 2024\n\nGenre: Black comedy, drama-thriller\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Fall of the House of Usher'\n\nMike Flanagan has delivered another handful of spine-tingling tale, this one based on the works of Edgar Allan Poe. The miniseries follows siblings Roderick and Madeline Usher in several timelines. As elders, they are the fictionalized version of the real-life Sacklers — ruthless owners of a pharmaceutical company that profited off an opioid that has caused many deaths. Pursued by investigators for decades, they’ve managed to evade prosecution. But when Roderick’s six children begin dying, the Ushers find control over their empire slipping.\n\nCast: Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood, Mary McDonnell, Henry Thomas\n\nSeasons: 1\n\nYear: 2023\n\nGenre: Horror drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 90%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Lupin'\n\nNeed a getaway and a thrill? Then it's time to tag along with Assane Diop, a thief inspired by the fictional 'gentleman thief' Arsène Lupin. Diop's whole life has been a series of moments where he saw his family being poorly treated by the rich. So he does what all daring menaces to high society do: set out for revenge. His target? The art, jewels and cash owned by the wealthy.\n\nCast: Omar Sy, Ludivine Sagnier, Clotilde Hesme\n\nSeasons: 3\n\nYear: 2021\n\nGenre: Crime drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Crown'\n\nClaire Foy and Matt Smith (\"Doctor Who\") garnered praise from critics and audiences alike for their portrayals of Queen Elizabeth II and Philip the Duke of Edinburgh in the first two seasons of \"The Crown\" which made it a must for our list of best Netflix shows. Later seasons introduced Elizabeth Debicki and Dominic West as Diana and Charles, with the final chapter, \"The Crown\" season 6, introducing Ed McVey as Prince William, Meg Bellamy as Kate Middleton and Luther Ford as Prince Harry.\n\nCast: Olivia Colman, Claire Foy, Vanessa Kirby\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nYear: 2016–2023\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 81%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Better Call Saul'\n\nThis \"Breaking Bad\" prequel/spinoff one of Tom's Guide's favorite shows in recent memory.\n\nIt focuses on slick, shady lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but it begins back when he's a small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill — who doesn't work with or for the drug cartels yet. While the series takes its moments showing moments \"after\" Breaking Bad, it's all about the moments that send McGill into the wrong side of the law.\n\nWhile co-star Rhea Seehorn, who plays Jimmy's friend and colleague Kim Wexler, wasn't one of the original main cast members, her performance became central to the series.\n\nCast: Bob Odenkirk, Rhea Seehorn, Michael McKean, Jonathan Banks\n\nSeasons: 6\n\nYear: 2015–2022\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Maid'\n\nIf you haven't seen \"Maid\", but can enjoy TV when it's rivetingly tense, you need to open your eyes to one of the best shows on Netflix. Alex (Margaret Qualley, in the performance of a lifetime), is trying to escape an emotionally abusive relationship with her husband Sean (Nick Robinson), and take her young daughter (Rylea Neveah Whittet) with her.\n\nAnd she does so in the middle of the night, in the first of many chaotic moments. Trying to make it on her own, Alex struggles to find work, and has to settle for being a maid. Her mother Paula (Andie MacDowell, Qualley's real-life mother) doesn't help at all, as she's the most unstable person in this story, and often takes Sean's side.\n\n\"Maid\" swings back and forth between heartwarming energy and bleak moments that will make it difficult to binge. That said, I somehow actually watched it all in a weekend, and came out the other side amazed. I'm hoping we get more like this from Netflix some day. – Henry T. Casey\n\nCast: Margaret Qualley, Andie MacDowell, Nick Robinson, Raymond Ablack, Billy Burke, Rylea Neveah Whittet, Anika Noni Rose, BJ Harrison\n\nSeasons: 1 (10 episodes)\n\nYear: 2021\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 94%\n\nWatch now\n\n'You'\n\nIt's time to meet \"You\", your next guilty pleasure binge watch. A thrilling drama, You is the talk of social media these days thanks to how much the show plays with our own addictions to Instagram and other apps. It focuses on a bookstore manager named Joe, who falls in love with/stalks the heck out of Beck (Elizabeth Lail), a grad student. One of the best shows on Netflix, and one with a strong following, \"You\" will conclude with one final season in 2024.\n\nCast: Victoria Pedretti, Penn Badgley, Elizabeth Lail\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nYear: 2018–2023 (ongoing)\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 90%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Squid Game'\n\nKorean thriller/drama Squid Game has captured Netflix in a nine-episode run that has everyone asking questions left and right. The series revolves around chauffeur Seong Gi-hun, who is broke and finds himself involved in a mysterious series of children's games run by masked guards, for a ₩45.6 billion prize. Squid Game is one of the best shows on Netflix not just for how well it's made, but for how its intriguing cast of characters will send you rooting for people you might not have before. Squid Game season 2 is confirmed, and we can't wait.\n\nCast: Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Jung Ho-yeon, O Yeong-su\n\nSeasons: 1 season\n\nYear: 2021 – ongoing\n\nGenre: Thriller/drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 94%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Ginny and Georgia'\n\nYoung parents often lead to dramatic lives, and such is the case with Georgia Miller, who's ended her years of a nomadic lifestyle only to find more chaos. Her daughter, 15-year-old Ginny, can't escape her mother's past either. A second season of this popular series — often ranked in the top shows on Netflix — is inevitable, as it ended on a cliffhanger built for more stories.

Amy (Zoe Saldaña) is a college dropout pursuing her artistic dreams in Florence, Italy. There, she meets and falls in love with handsome Sicilian chef Lino (Eugenio Mastrandrea). After a whirlwind romance, Lino follows Amy to Los Angeles to turn their fling into a real relationship, with all the attendant complexities involving families and careers.

The series stays rooted to the original concept and characters, beginning with Johnny Lawrence re-opening the Cobra Kai dojo as a way to try and right his erring ways. Meanwhile, Daniel LaRusso may be thriving professionally, but he's still dealing with the absence of Mr. Miyagi. It's been announced that Cobra Kai season 6 will be the final season of the series, but spinoffs are already rumored.\n\nCast: Ralph Macchio, William Zabka, Courtney Henggeler, Xolo Maridueña\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nYear: 2018 – 2022 (ongoing)\n\nGenre: Comedy/drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 95%\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Queen's Gambit'\n\nBelieve it or not, chess is en vogue once more. In The Queen's Gambit, Anya Taylor-Joy (Emma) stars as Beth Harmon, a prodigious master of the chessboard who wants to be the very best in the world. Not only does Taylor-Joy captivate on-screen, but this is a beautifully shot show that's already earned think-pieces about its gorgeously designed spaces.\n\nCast: Anya Taylor-Joy, Bill Camp, Marielle Heller\n\nSeasons: 1 (7 episodes)\n\nYear: 2020\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 100%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Money Heist (La Casa de Papel)'\n\nIf you're looking for an intense and action-packed crime series, check out the greatest heists this side of Danny Ocean. The beautifully-shot series tracks the crews led by The Professor, who aims to take rob the Royal Mint of Spain and the Bank of Spain. This Spanish-language show zigs and zags all over the place, with flash-backs and time jumps to keep you on your toes. You even have to be concerned with the ol' \"unreliable narrator\" conceit, which adds even more intrigue.

Jason Bateman and Laura Linney star as \"Marty\" and Wendy Byrde, who get into the dark, seedy underworld to make ends meet. While early reviews were mixed, season 3 gives a giant stage for Laura Linney to thrive on screen. One of the biggest shows ending in 2022, Ozark is without a doubt one of the best shows on Netflix.\n\nCast: Jason Bateman, Laura Linney, Julia Garner\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nYear: 2017–2022\n\nGenre: Crime drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 81%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Mindhunter'\n\nThought we had enough crime dramas? Think again. Mindhunter brought cinema-quality visuals and strong character development to the genre, and took us back in crime to the 1970s as police began to track serial killers. Excellent acting and moody writing help make it one of the best Netflix series. Frustratingly, Mindhunter has apparently been put on an indefinite hiatus, so we don't know if or when season 3 will happen.\n\nCast: Jonathan Groff, Holt McCallany, Anna Torv\n\nSeasons: 2\n\nYear: 2017–2019\n\nGenre: Crime drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Peaky Blinders'\n\nThe first five seasons of \"Peaky Blinders\" has spanned a decade of crime drama in Birmingham, England.

Co-created by Mindy Kaling and inspired by her own upbringing, Never Have I Ever focuses on the very charming Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), an Indian-American high school sophomore who’s trying to have a normal American teen experience.\n\n\"Never Have I Ever\" ended its run in excellent fashion, with a heartfelt finale. We rarely see shows depict the end of high school as well as NHIE just did.\n\nCast: Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Poorna Jagannathan, Ramona Young\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nYear: 2020 - 2023\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 87%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Insecure'\n\nYes, Netflix has an HBO show. It's a weird world right now, but audiences are winning here. Issa Rae's Insecure is both her and on Max, meaning more people that ever can meet long-time friends Issa (Issa Rae) and Molly (Yvonne Orji), and watch them struggle through their late 20's.\n\nPartially based on Rae's previous web series \"Awkward Black Girl\", \"Insecure\" dives into the contemporary Black experience through its creator's sense of humor. The series begins with relationship issues, and expands out to cover a wider gamut of topics.\n\nCast: Issa Rae, Yvonne Orji, Jay Ellis, Lisa Joyce\n\nSeasons: 5\n\nYear: 2016–2021\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%Watch now\n\n'Beef'\n\nRage is best served in a binge-watch of Netflix's \"Beef\", a dark comedy about that space inside of helplessness where anger blossoms. This A24 series stars Steven Yeun as Danny, a contractor who just so happened to be on the wrong side of a moment of frustration with houseplant business owner Amy (Ali Wong). And while their anger is seemingly infinite, it's also somehow hilarious.\n\n\"Beef\" takes on every single fad in sight, from crypto trading to the weird things rich people pay for. All while Amy's incredibly eager to sell her business and Danny's financials are in dire condition.\n\nWe love \"Beef\" not just for these outrageous performances, but for the bizarre moments that Lee Sung Jin finds as he explores mental health, class differences and the Asian American experience. And, somehow, \"Beef\" found a way to make guns funny.\n\nCast: Ali Wong, Steven Yeun, Joseph Lee, David Choe, Young Mazino, Ashley Park, David Choe, Patty Yasutake, Maria Bello\n\nSeasons: 1 (10 episodes)\n\nYear: 2023\n\nGenre: Dark comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 99%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Russian Doll'\n\nThe first thing you should know is that \"Russian Doll\" is the funny and emotional the series that Natasha Lyonne (its star, co-creator, writer, and director) has long since deserved, as she's spent most of her career as a co-star and not a lead. Its twisting, tricky premise is so good that we won't say anything else. Russian Doll's originality makes it one of the best shows to watch on Netflix. And after a mind-bending second season, we're eagerly awaiting news about \"Russian Doll\" season 3.\n\nNeed more Natasha Lyonne?

That said, some of the funniest moments this season are all about co-creator Tim Robinson's physical performances. Simply failing to use VR properly in the second episode of the season led to some of the funniest expressions of the whole series (one of the best Netflix comedies).\n\nAnd while each season isn't that long, it's ultimately rewatchable. I've often wondered if I should cancel Netflix for a specific month, but \"I Think You Should Leave\" is the first show that's made me realize I actually need Netflix. That's how often I rewatch it. – Henry T.

The series allowed modern horror auteur Jordan Peele and collaborator Keegan-Michael Key to break out as comedy geniuses. Not only do the two show the humor in the world through their bi-racial vantage points, but their takes on awkward masculinity are second to none.\n\nCast: Jordan Peele, Keegan-Michael Key\n\nSeasons: 3 (Netflix doesn't have seasons 4 and 5)\n\nYear: 2012–2013\n\nGenre: Sketch comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 98% (average for seasons 1-3)\n\nWatch now\n\n'Cunk on Earth'\n\n\"Cunk on Earth\" is a send-up of every single pretentious anthropology documentary series that featured a host who took themselves far too seriously. It gains its title from host Philomena Cunk (played by Diane Morgan), a slightly dimwitted presenter who goes around interviewing experts and testing their levels of politeness who's a little dimwitted. Or maybe she really loves to make her interviewees confused.\n\nThe product of the minds of Morgan and writer Charlie Brooker (Black Mirror), Cunk On Earth is ripe for comparisons to the works of Sasha Baron Cohen. That said, we see the character of Ms. Cunk as a more lovable scamp. Because while Morgan also has excellent comedic timing, Cunk spares its audience from gross-out physical comedy.\n\nCast: Diane Morgan, Paul Bahn, Martin Kemp, Nigel Spivey, Shirley Thompson\n\nSeasons: 1 (5 episodes)\n\nYear: 2023\n\nGenre: Mockumentary\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 100%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Dead to Me'\n\nAs bleak as the dark comedy \"Dead to Me\" — which is about women who become friends over one of their husband's death — gets, it's still one of the best shows on Netflix.

Well, now that it's on Netflix, you can yadda-yadda-yadda all you want while you re-discover one of the most loved television shows of all time. Sitting pretty in the Mt. Rushmore of sitcoms, these tales of four selfish New Yorkers are as influential as TV gets, with \"sponge-worthy\" coming back into conversations as we wonder if someone or an event is \"rapid test-worthy.\"\n\nCast: Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards\n\nSeasons: 9\n\nYear: 1989 – 1997\n\nGenre: Sitcom\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 89%\n\nWatch now\n\n'The Baby-Sitters Club'\n\nThis long-awaited series adaptation of the much-loved YA book series is sweet, positive, and heartwarming — without being cloying or mushy. It takes the familiar story of a group of young teens who start a babysitting service and adds modern elements like social media and smartphones. But the essential themes remain the same: friendship, compassion, loyalty, forgiveness and understanding.

But, don't expect tragedy, which often makes every queer series feel like a depressing series of gut punches; \"Heartstopper\" is heart-warming.\n\nConnor earns a ton of praise for his portrayal of popular rugby player Nick, who struggles with his emerging bisexuality.

As is the case with \"Bridgerton\", the first fruit of the deal that Netflix signed with show-runner Shonda Rhimes (\"Grey's Anatomy\"). The cleverly written and beautifully produced series tracks Daphne, a young socialite debuting in the London scene. Each episode has an ending that will leave you clicking \"Play\" again, so beware as the seasons aren't that long!\n\nCast: Phoebe Dynevor, Regé-Jean Page, Jonathan Bailey\n\nSeasons: 3 (season 4 is confirmed)\n\nYear: 2020 - 2024 (ongoing)\n\nGenre: Period drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 89%\n\nWatch now\n\n'Emily in Paris'\n\nIf the eponymous heroine of \"Emily in Paris\" seems to talk, act and dress like a millennial Carrie Bradshaw, there’s a reason for that — series creator Darren Star also masterminded \"Sex and the City\". Emily is a Chicago marketing manager who scores a sweet gig in her dream city. Unfortunately, her new boss, Sylvie, and co-workers are a nightmare. While Paris fashionistas are sneering at the rom-com’s take on Paris and fashion, both Emily and the show are irresistibly charming and fun. And we say “oui, oui” to the handsome eye candy who proves Paris really is the city of lust, er, love.\n\nCast: Lily Collins, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Ashley Park, Lucas Bravo\n\nSeasons: 4\n\nYear: 2020 - 2024\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 60%\n\nWatch now\n\nBest Netflix shows: Horror\n\n'Archive 81'\n\nWe've previously lauded \"Archive 81\" as the one new show you had to watch on Netflix. And so it's no surprise that it landed a slot on our list of the best shows on Netflix.\n\n\"Archive 81\" provides a fresh mix of character-driven drama and jump-scare horror — two things that shouldn't go together at all. It even manages to make a use of found-footage work, even though that should be played out by now. Unfortunately, it joined the ranks of Netflix's canceled shows, as it was killed it off before we could get a second season. If you're upset about \"Archive 81\" cancelation, maybe give Netflix a piece of your mind and call Netflix customer service.\n\nStars: Mamoudou Athie, Dina Shihabi, Evan Jonigkeit, Matt McGorry, Martin Donovan\n\nSeasons: 1 season\n\nYear: 2021\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 84%\n\nWatch now\n\nBest Netflix shows: Animated\n\n'Scavengers Reign'\n\nAfter being canceled after just one season at Max, this beautifully realized, bizarre sci-fi series has crash-landed on Netflix. \"Scavengers Reign\" follows a series of survivors from a damaged interstellar spaceship who find themselves stranded on a hostile, alien planet.

Things are moving fast with Flowers until Pilgrim is met with the shocking realization that he'll have to defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil exes, led by Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman) if they're going to continue dating.\n\nAnd that would normally be where the story ends – except this version adds another Ramona-focused layer to the story that fans will be shocked and delighted to explore.
