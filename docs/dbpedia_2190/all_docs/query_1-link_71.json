        "text": "Iâve been listening to Jim and Margery for about 7 years now on podcast. I live in London, and have been to Boston only once in my life (an overnight trip for a meeting). But, having found BPR through a random search on Apple Podcasts/iTunes (whatever they call it now), I feel like I know the city and the Commonwealth well. Such a great cast of regular guests/commentators, and a day without hearing Margery putting up with/fending off Jim is a dull day. Itâs not perfect - Jim is pathologically unable to stand in the shoes of any caller with an even marginally right-of-center perspective, and the default/automatic vibe of âwoke foreverâ does a disservice to NPR I think - but itâs a great listen nonetheless. A great shop-window for GBH and a great ad for Boston. I will visit some day and show up at the Boston Public Library (Tuesdays and Fridays) to see Jim in his shorts."
