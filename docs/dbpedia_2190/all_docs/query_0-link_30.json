        "text": "Dan Colleran joined the University of Massachusetts athletics department as the Associate Athletics Director for Communications & Broadcasting in September of 2022. Colleran oversees the communications, public relations and broadcasting efforts for the department while also working closely with the UMass football and rowing programs.\n\nPrior to Massachusetts, Colleran spent the previous seven years at the University of Notre Dame, first as an associate director and then as the director of athletics communications for Fighting Irish Media. He worked primarily with the nationally ranked Fighting Irish hockey program while also overseeing communications efforts at various times for the rowing and men's and women's golf teams as well as for the Warren Golf Course.\n\nDuring Colleran's tenure with Notre Dame hockey, he promoted a team that made a national title game appearance, two Frozen Four appearances, four NCAA Regional final appearances and five NCAA tournament appearances. In addition to advancing to the 2017 Frozen Four, Notre Dame also played host to that event in Chicago. Additional highlights included serving as the athletics department's strategic communications liaison ahead of the 2019 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic at Notre Dame Stadium, which featured the Boston Bruins and Chicago Blackhawks. He also spearheaded the public relations efforts as the Irish joined the Big Ten conference as an affiliate member for ice hockey beginning with the 2017-18 season.\n\nColleran managed several assistant and associate directors of communications through various iterations of the Fighting Irish Media department, successfully hiring seven communications staffers who remain with FIM or who have gone on to work with Vanderbilt University, the University of Louisville, Populous and the Cleveland Indians.\n\nPrior to Notre Dame, Colleran spent three years at his alma mater's athletics communications office, Providence College, where he served as the hockey contact and also worked with the men's soccer program. While serving as the hockey contact, the Friars captured the first NCAA Championship in program history in 2015.\n\nBefore returning to Providence College, Colleran spent two years as an assistant executive director at the Ivy League Conference office in Princeton, New Jersey, helping with communications and championship efforts.\n\nA native of Walpole, Massachusetts, Colleran began his athletics communications career a few weeks into his freshman year at Providence College. He continued to work in Providence's athletics commutation's office as an undergraduate student assistant and then as a graduate assistant. He then transitioned to a two-year internship at Notre Dame prior to his stint at the Ivy League.\n\nColleran and his wife, Liz, have one son, James, and one daughter, Emma."
