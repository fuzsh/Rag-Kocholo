        "text": "On David E. Kelley's new Boston Public, which airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on Fox, Jessalyn Gilsig plays Lauren Davis, a young teacher who is so earnest, open-minded, and liberal she'd make a great poster girl for political correctness.\n\nAnd yet, after two incidents of violence, one involving a black student, the other a white one, at the Boston high school where she heads the social studies department, Lauren's been wrestling with the question of whether she might, subconsciously, be a racist.\n\n\"I think that's what makes David such an exceptional writer. There's never just a bad guy and a good guy,\" Gilsig says. \"It's so human, which is to say that we can have the best intentions, but what do our actions really reflect?\"\n\nIn a recent telephone interview, Gilsig chats about her first series. Her voice is so smooth and soothing it's easy to see why her credits include a lot of dubbing and voice-over work.\n\n\"That's what I mostly did professionally. That and theater,\" says Gilsig.\n\nOn Boston Public, she says, she is enthralled by the ethical ambiguities, which have earned the freshman drama loads of critical acclaim.\n\nThus far, Gilsig's juiciest story line has been her character's grappling with racism.\n\nBoston Public is Gilsig's third time in a Kelley series. She guest-starred in two episodes of The Practice, as an assistant district attorney, then played an FBI agent on Snoops. That short-lived ABC detective drama was canceled before her two episodes aired.\n\nBy that point, though, Gilsig knew that Boston Public was in the works. Kelley, impressed with her work, wrote the Lauren Davis part for her.\n\n_ Times wires"
