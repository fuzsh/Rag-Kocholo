        "text": "NBC has found its young Liam Neeson.\n\nVikings star Clive Standen is set to take on the role of Bryan Mills in NBC’s straight-to-series Taken prequel, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\n\nThe drama is described as a modern-day prequel to the Luc Besson-produced 2008 feature of the same name that starred Neeson as retired CIA operative Bryan Mills on a one-man mission to save his kidnapped daughter. The series will illustrate how a young Mills develops his skills.\n\nStanden, who plays Rollo on History scripted series Vikings, will take on the role of Mills, who is recruited to be a black-ops agent in the elite Emergency Covert Action Team.\n\nHomeland‘s Alexander Cary will pen the script and executive produce the drama, with Besson also attached to exec produce alongside Matthew Gross, Edouard de Vesinne and Thomas Anargyros. Alex Graves will direct the pilot.\n\nThe project is a co-production between Europa Corp TV and Universal Television. For Besson, Taken becomes his latest movie to be adapted for TV, joining La Femme Nikita and Transporter.\n\nStanden’s credits also include Starz drama Camelot and features Everest and upcoming Patient Zero. He is repped by CAA and Management 360."
