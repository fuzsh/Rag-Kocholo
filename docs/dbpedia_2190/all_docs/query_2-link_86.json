This year, we are thrilled to be moving forward with a second year of two signature programs from the Anniversary Year:\n\nFirst is Innovation Islands, the successful mini grant program that last year provided 12 community groups with funding, free ferry tickets, and logistics support that enabled them to activate the islands in new ways designed to meet the needs and interests of their community. Partners this year include Thompson Island Outward Bound, DCR, BHN and NPS. The call for proposals closed last Friday (34 proposals!) and we expect to award 9-12 grants this year. Stay tuned for details on award recipients and the experiences they’ll be bringing to life on islands this summer.\n\nThe second 2022 signature program finding new and exciting life in 2023 is the family-friendly Reel Fun Fishing Day championed last year by MWRA and offered at both Deer and Nut Islands with a robust slate of partners, including BHN, NPS, Save the Harbor Save the Bay, Mass Wildlife, MA Dept Fish and Game, and MA Department of Marine Fisheries.

Over the course of the year, we utilized the Partnership meetings to engage the Partnership and the participating public in “looking back” (what was accomplished), “looking inward” (how the Partnership does its work), and “looking toward the future”.\n\nThe Anniversary Report was intended to be an internal working document that could also be shared with various organizations, elected officials, and potential financial contributors. However, its primary purpose was to identify topics and issues that the Partnership can work on over the next five years.\n\nThe committee has taken the various comments that we received after the report was presented to the Partnership at the September meeting and incorporated feedback into the final report that was sent out with today’s agenda. We wanted to ask if anyone has any comments on the final version?\n\nAgreement from multiple Committee chairs (Laskey, Stearns, Abbott), that this project was a great team effort with good collaborative efforts.\n\nLooking Toward the Future, Michael Creasey, National Park Service\n\nIn the last section of the Report is a section entitled “Advancing the Partnership Agenda”. It calls out 7 key focus areas:\n\nConfronting Climate Change Through Collaboration and Innovation\n\nConnecting People to Nature and History\n\nWelcoming All People and Providing Equitable Access\n\nLandscape Scale Conservation\n\nDeveloping Island Destinations\n\nBoston’s “Working” Harbor\n\nShaping Strategic Alliances\n\nBrittany was tasked with dividing participants into breakout rooms for a facilitated discussion. There are 5 facilitators, each with their own questions based on one of the seven topics above. The groups will at random go to 3/5 breakout rooms to discuss each question for 8 minutes. Report outs from each group below, with complete notes from each discussion at the end of the meeting minutes:\n\nQuestion 1, facilitated by Angela Allison, NPS: The report calls for the Partnership to explore hiring a coordinator position. How Might We… define what the greatest needs that this position could assist the Partnership with?\n\nEach group raised important questions that still need to be addressed (full time? Who pays salary? Are they more executive position or secretary-like? Which organization hires and oversees position/how would that position remain neutral if one organization supervises?)\n\nThis position could be more of an ambassador to reach communities that don’t have a voice at the moment.\n\nWould allow us to do more than what we currently can, not necessarily take on more but complete what we can’t.\n\nQuestion 2, facilitated by Liza Stearns, NPS: We had great success with the community cruises, free ferry days, and a mini-grant program whereby organizations applied for funding to create their own experiences to the islands; How Might We… learn from these programs to continue to engage even more diverse audiences?\n\nThe mini-grants stood out as a great idea to allow people to define for themselves how the Islands meet their needs. Encouraged to keep that program.\n\nRecommendation to invest deeply in the evaluation of mini-grant types of programs to learn from them so we can improve environment for community programs.\n\nHow are programs advertised? Highlighting the faces of the people in that neighborhood that’s being advertised to.\n\nEffort to look at additional funding and grants. E.g. work with Boston public schools to open the islands to new, young, audiences.\n\nReally think about who our inactive audience is so we can send someone into that community to activate that audience.\n\nQuestion 3, facilitated by Marc Albert, NPS: Climate Change is the greatest existential threat to the park and our coastal communities. How might We… utilize the Islands to engage scientists and everyday people in hands-on learning of climate change impacts and researching innovative solutions for ongoing management?\n\nThe islands are a warning system for the region.\n\nHave markers on the Islands showing average high tide in 2030, 2040, etc.\n\nWebcams on the Islands, specifically to see the Islands during high tides/storms\n\nMore visitor activities on the Islands in regard to climate change\n\nParks give a good opportunity to provide education programs around climate change because you can physically see the effects of climate change. There’s a way of talking about it so people can interact with reality.\n\nThere’s a tremendous opportunity on the Islands to engage young people\n\nQuestion 4, facilitated by Priscilla Geigis, DCR: There was recognition this year that the Park and the Partnership would benefit from more outreach and engagement from Harbor communities, diverse interests and cultures. How Might We…find ways to be more inclusive and provide opportunities for people to see themselves as active users and stewards of their public lands? Identify who is missing?\n\nTransportation – hard to get there (cost, hard to navigate if unfamiliar with Boston). NPS has put in for electric ferries, but it will be a while before that will be available.\n\nIsland experience – how to expand experience so you don’t have to be on the island.\n\nCommunity – encouraging new groups to come, and to bring a friend.\n\nMultilanguage welcome sign that invites people and assures them that everyone is welcome. Also diverse staff to reflect the community and speak with visitors in their own language.\n\nAsk the communities what they want to build their experiences.\n\nMarketing – social media to invite your friends. Get partnership staff out to the islands.\n\nDifficult to determine which group we’re not reaching, so hard to figure out how to reach them.\n\nQuestion 5, facilitated by Jack Murray, BHN: The Anniversary year explored new ways of collaborating among the different organizations, the Report reflected this work in a broad, but focused, Agenda for the future. How Might We… best work to advance the Agenda through the Partnership and are there creative and more collaborative ways that the Partnership could be working to create a greater collective impact?\n\nCommunication was a recurring theme.\n\nHow to achieve greater collective impact and build upon successes in 2022?\n\nMany Partner organizations took on extra duty – how can we go back to them to see if they are still willing to participate?\n\nApproach each year as an anniversary year to garner enthusiasm and maintain energy and focus on importance of Partnership and park.\n\nThere’s a balance to maintaining the hyper focus within organizations without being a burden.\n\nEvery two years there’s an election, new people new roles. Important to reach out to new players.\n\nFocus on the Partnership priority and agenda setting. Go back to each partner to identify what their priorities and vision is.\n\nIdentify 1-3 of issues that many work on independently to work collaboratively to focus energy/resources/impact.\n\nReimagine advisory council in representing all interest groups.\n\nNext step – use the discussions from today to identify how we activate the “Looking Forward” agenda. The Anniversary Committee will regroup to determine what/how to advance some of the ideas brought forward.\n\nPartnership Updates\n\nBoston Harbor Now, Kathy Abbott\n\nEntered in contract for interpretive features on the Greenway, will be completed this spring\n\nComprehensive conditions assessment of Charlestown Pier 1, Little Brewster\n\nDCR/BHN on visitor enhancements on Spectacle Island for new exhibits, waysides, and tents\n\nWinter Wildlife Cruise is sold out!

Partnership voted unanimously. Meetings minutes were approved as written and distributed.\n\nPresentations\n\nAnniversary Year Goals, Cathie Barner, Red Bridge Group\n\nFred Laskey introduced Cathie Barner.\n\nShe offered a little history of where the Partnership has been over the last 1.5 years as they tried something different from what the Partnership has usually done in the past.\n\nShe said originally when exploring whether the Harbor Islands should be a national park area people came together as they knew they needed to have all of the voices together in the same place. While there was lots of support, there were lots of questions, and even some dissent. She concluded that this Partnership was formed out of a need to see everyone at the table and that this anniversary year it is a great time to think about the future of the Boston Harbor Islands.\n\nShe said for the anniversary year, instead of hiring a PR firm to promote that there is an anniversary, the Partnership decided to look at the Partnership itself and see how it could be the planner/producer of the anniversary year. The approach was to create a series of several teams and organizations that would facilitate cooperative work. The theory that we could accomplish more working in cooperatively proved true and looking to continue that type of collaborating in the future.\n\nThe Anniversary Year organizational structure\n\nCommunity engagement piece rested well in both communications and programming teams\n\nFocus on reaching new audiences and engaging new long-term audiences\n\nPartnership focused on;\n\nLooking back\n\nLooking inward\n\nEnvisioning the future\n\nGoals\n\nIncrease awareness of islands\n\nEnhance community engagement with all aspects of the park\n\nDefine a strategic framework for next 25 years\n\nAnniversary Planning\n\nPartnership defined as the leader\n\nCommunity partners working in tandem with partnership\n\n3 separate teams\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nProgramming\n\nCommunications\n\nNew way of organizing and thinking within the three teams and as a whole.\n\nBuilt teams based on everyone’s strengths.\n\nCollective Impact\n\nMany different skills, talents, institutional expertise that partners can bring to this\n\nPower of Partnerships\n\n$264.7 million in spending leveraged to implement partnership projects and programs\n\nLooking to the Future, Michael Creasey, National Park Service\n\nSo much diversity built into how we approach our goals\n\nPower of Partnerships\n\nAbility to collectively leverage significant investments in the islands through educational programs, restored lands, preservation of historic properties, enhanced visitor experiences, scientific research, new and upgraded infrastructure improvements.\n\nFocus will be on\n\nKeep Eyes on the Prize\n\nBold and innovative ways of thinking about Park for the next 25 years supporting vital public purposes, places for learning and civic dialogue, as well as for outdoor recreation and respite.\n\nWhat are the things that we really need to focus on?\n\nIdea of public purpose\n\nHow do we begin to learn from the layers of history in this place?\n\nHow do we open it up to everyone?\n\nLeverage the Partnership organization and coastal landscapes as a learning lab for developing solution to Boston’s climate resiliency goals\n\nStone Living Lab\n\nWorking to prepare for climate change. 25 years ago when partnership was formed climate change wasn’t really in the vocabulary, now it is front and center\n\nIntentionally support an equitable and inclusive BHINSP.\n\nModel “collective impact” – an intentional way of working together and sharing information for the purpose of solving complex problems and accomplishing common goals.\n\nBegin to think about ways we can better work together\n\nAdvancing the Partnership Agenda\n\nPriorities\n\nConfronting climate change through collaboration and innovation\n\nMaking personal connections to nature and history\n\nIslands have experienced many challenging times\n\nBringing back landscapes and biodiversity along with recognizing histories is important\n\nAnswering the call to welcome all people and provide equitable access\n\nKudos to programming and communications committees for revealing some of the strategies uses\n\nHow do we begin to look at equitable access in a market-based transportation system?\n\nRoughly 50% of visitor ship was at a reduced or free cost\n\nLandscape scale conservation and developing islands destinations\n\nImportant to look at islands from landscape perspective\n\nHow do we build adaptable plans?\n\nMore information available today on developing adaptable plans that what was available 25 years ago\n\nCostly and challenging to build places people can come to experience the islands\n\nLook at the natural and historic elements of the landscape in a cohesive approach\n\nBoston’s “working” harbor\n\nEconomics of the harbor and harbor islands\n\n#2 industry in Boston and Commonwealth\n\nWorking harbor is changing and we need to embrace that\n\nThe Partnership’s Commitment\n\nHow do we look at ourselves for the future?\n\nIdentified common alignment for goals we would like to see in future\n\nThe anniversary year allowed the Partnership to deliberate on strategic alignment around common goals:\n\nMaximize the Partnership’s greatest assets – its size and diversity. Collectively, the eleven organizations make up a dynamic and extremely experience staff that provide great opportunities for collective impact.\n\nExplore the need for a Partnership coordinator that could facilitate and exponentially increase outreach and stewardship.\n\nReimagine the role and membership of the BHI Advisory Council.\n\nAdvisory Council was suspended, which gave the council time to reflect on what has been done and how it contributes to the partnership.\n\nWhat is the role now of the advisory council?\n\nEngage with the community to better understand the factors that contribute to visitation barriers\n\nEnsure the Partnership has productive relations with indigenous peoples in the region\n\nWorking to improve relationship with Massachusett tribe\n\nRemembering that we are on their land and integrating that into how we work\n\nIntentionally integrate an Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access (IDEA) lens into all aspects of Partnership’s work\n\nAnniversary Report Feedback\n\nA tremendous collaborative effort went into the Anniversary year.

Partnerships, friendships, collegial formed during process\n\nConversation on First draft of Futures Report\n\nVirtual participants invited to participate by dropping comments in the chat.\n\nComments from Partners\n\nNeed to consider existential threat of climate change to park and acknowledge that we probably can’t save every place in islands in current state for future. Perhaps advise landowners what should be prioritized for adapting to rising water levels and more (severe) storms.\n\nWhat should we prioritize putting investments into?\n\nImpressed by internal carrying out of anniversary year but to accomplish many of things in Futures report a full-time BHI coordinator would be helpful\n\nCould convene people regularly, focus on public engagement\n\nUse model of what we have done with anniversary and implement in more permanent way\n\nWho is the audience for this document?\n\nSteering Committee spent lot of time thinking through this.

He also said that Jack Murray will be filling in for Kathy Abbott from BHN during today’s meeting.\n\nApproval of minutes from March 15th, Michael Creasey moved it and Jack Murray seconded. Partnership voted unanimously. Meetings minutes were approved as written and distributed.\n\nPresentations\n\nAnnual Partnership Spending, Sarah Waterworth, National Park Service\n\nFred Laskey introduced Sarah Waterworth.\n\nSarah shared the Partnership investments in the Park.\n\nThe Partnership is required to have a 3-to-1 leverage match, but in the recent years it has been 5-to-1 to 6-to-1 match.\n\nWent from $14.93 million spending last year to $15.77 million this most recent year. She did not know if the increase spending was because of inflation or not, but noted we have spent more on leveraging partnerships to get youth, underserved communities, and native peoples out to the Islands.\n\nMichael Creasey thanked everyone who provided inputs to Sarah and Angela Allison. He said it was helpful for fundraising purposes too. He went on to welcome Sarah back and said she started her career at the Boston Harbor Islands and after 8-years she is back as the Director of Business Services and Administration.\n\nBoston Harbor Islands Advisory Council Discussion\n\nFred said at the last meeting the Partnership heard from Elizabeth, Maureen, & Rob. He thanked them for their presentation and for getting the Partnership to think more about the role an advisory council can play in aiding the Partnership.\n\nFred said the Partnership has learned, from the information provided by the National Park Service, that for the advisory council to be reinstated, the Partnership must submit a request showing the council will provide value to us. The Partnership also heard that they need to clarify some of the roles and responsibilities of the council and Partnership so that everyone understands what it would mean to have an advisory council again.\n\nHe said he thinks the Partnership is all in agreement that, if the Partnership supports an advisory council, it needs to be fully representative of the perspectives of the different communities the Partnership serves. Elizabeth has started to explore that and has requested help from the National Park Service in facilitating that process further.\n\nFred ended by saying that this is a very positive step, but recognized that there is a lot of groundwork that is yet to be done to set the stage to have this work the way it was envisioned to work. He then turned it over to Michael Creasey.\n\nMichael Creasey thanked Elizabeth, Rob, and Maureen for their presentation at the last Partnership meeting. He said the takeaway from the last meeting was that the Partnership felt that the advisory council does play a valuable role. But in order to address some of the questions the Department of Interior has the Partnership needs to formulate responses to their questions. Eventually the Partnership needs to formulate a roster of potential FACA members as there are several active advisory council members, but many are not. He said the National Park Service would work with the Partnership and the council members to develop a scope of work for a plan to identify things like roles and responsibilities, representatives of organizations and individuals that would best represent the diversity of the community, as well as include the various interests reported in the legislation. He also said, the Partnership should look at best practices of what an effective council looks like by reaching out to other advisory councils. He said he has reached out to Cape Cod and Acadia and they are more than happy to talk with the Partnership. Best practices for that relationship and being an effective council to the Partnership is really important.\n\nHe said at the last Partnership meeting there was discussion about bringing on a consultant who can help the Partnership think through this approach, but before the advisory council is formalized the Partnership needs to request a reinstatement from the Department of Interior. Michael mentioned that he talked with Fred Laskey and Angela Allison about activating a governance committee to work through the process of reinstatement and then report back to the Partnership. The governance committee has been activated before to talk through legislation and the anniversaries. This committee could work through the reinstatement requirements from the Department of Interior, draft scope of work for a facilitator to guide the Partnership through a strategic plan, and then report back at the next Partnership meeting to keep the full Partnership engaged. Michael recommended that Fred activate the governance committee to look at the requirements to reinstate the federal advisory council and draft a scope of work for the NPS to engage with the advisory council members to hire a facilitator to bring them through a planning process.\n\nFred Laskey agreed with Michael. And suggested that those on the Partnership interested in joining a governance committee, please email David Santucci with the NPS who will collect names.\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\n(Q) Rob Moir: Mentioned that this Advisory Council was unique as it was created by Congress. He suggested to find best practices that the Partnership reconnect with Sarah Peskin with the NPS who helped designed the whole program and Mark Forest who worked in Rep Gerry Studds office when the representative put this legislation forward.\n\n(A) Michael: He said he was familiar with Sarah and that they can certainly reach out to Congressman’s Studds former staff.\n\n(Q) Elizabeth Solomon: She recommended that whatever committee is formed around this that there is representation from the current Advisory Council members.\n\n(A) Fred: He agreed with Elizabeth as the current active members have put in a lot of effort over the years.\n\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) Funding Discussion, Michael Creasey, National Park Service\n\nMichael shared a PowerPoint which gave an overview of Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) which was recently passed and talked about potential projects which could support the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership.\n\nBIL authorizes $542.1 Billion for surface transportation programs for five years (FY 2022-26).\n\nWhat’s in the BIL?\n\n375+ unique programs at over a dozen federal agencies.\n\n125+ new programs across 9 federal agencies representing >25% of total spending.\n\n90%+ of these investments will be delivered by non-federal partners.\n\nClose to 60% flowing through formula programs.\n\nClose to 38% of funding contains provisions that allow for expanded federal cost sharing arrangements – particularly for rural and disadvantaged communities.\n\nAt a glance: The BIL Additional Funding (in billions):\n\nTransportation:\n\nRoads, bridge, major projects - $110.0\n\nRail - $66.0\n\nAirports - $25.0\n\nPorts - $17.0\n\nPublic Transit - $39.0\n\nSafety - $11.0\n\nElectric Vehicles - $7.5\n\nElectric Buses – $5.3\n\nOther - $3.5\n\nEnergy, Environment, Climate:\n\nWater Infrastructure - $55.0\n\nResilience - $50.0\n\nPower Infrastructure - $65.0\n\nEnvironmental Remediation - $21.0\n\nBroadband:\n\nBroadband - $65.0\n\nOther:\n\n$6.0\n\nRelevant Programs to the Partnership:\n\nAuthorized Programs – Direct Federal: Funding Direct to Federal Agencies\n\nFederal Lands Transportation Program – NPS and Other Federal Agencies\n\nDiscretionary/Competitive Grant Programs: Federal, State, Local and Partners (501(c)3) Eligible Applicants\n\nElectric or Low-Emitting Ferry Program\n\nUrbanized Area Passenger Ferry Program\n\nReconnecting Communities Pilot Program\n\nLocal and Regional Project Assistance Grants (RAISE)\n\nSafe Streets and Roads for All\n\nPROTECT Grant\n\nFormula Grant Programs: Allocated to States, Transit Agencies, Federally Eligible Tribes\n\nFederal Lands Access Program\n\nConstruction of Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal Facilities\n\nState of Good Repair\n\nPROTECT Grant\n\nStorm Risk Management, Hurricane, and Storm Damage Reduction Projects:\n\nDirect Federal to Army Corps of Engineers: $2,550,000,000\n\nDescription: Army Corps will use this funding to construct authorized federal storm damage reduction projects.\n\nEligible Uses: Eligible federal projects to reduce the risk of flood and storm damage along the Nation’s coast.\n\nApplications: Army Corps will be issuing multiple contract awards during Fiscal Year 2022.\n\nPromoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost Saving Transportation (PROTECT):\n\nFormula program to states: $7,299,999,998\n\nCompetitive Grant: $1,400,000\n\nDescription: Supports planning, resilience improvements, community resilience and evacuation routes, and at-risk coastal infrastructure.\n\nEligible Uses: conduct resilience planning, strengthen and protect evacuation routes, increase resilience planning, increase the resilience of surface transportation infrastructure from the impacts of sea level rise, flooding, etc. Highway, transit, and certain port projects are eligible.\n\nReconnecting Communities Pilot Program:\n\nCompetitive Grant Program Managed Under Federal Highway Administration - $1,000,000,000\n\nDescription: Projects to restore community connectivity by removing, retrofitting, or mitigating highways or other transportation facilities that create barriers to community connectivity, including to mobility, access, or economic development.\n\nEligible Uses: Grants (>$5 million) for capital construction projects, including the removal and replacement of eligible facilities.

Are the resources like natural and cultural resources considered separate from the infrastructure that supports the resources?\n\n(A) Michael: He said they define it pretty broadly. The BIL is broken up into three broad categories: transportation; energy, environment, and climate; and then broadband. There is a component in energy, environment, and climate that I think gets to your questions with regards to natural and cultural resources – things like environmental restoration that gets tied in.\n\n(Q) Richard McGuinness: He noted a word of caution on the matching funds where those would come from and their availability. He also noted that they like to distribute these funds equally and equitably across the country. He then said that picking battles and prioritizing is important as there could be instances in which we could be competing against each other. Optics are important on these grant applications so they are consistent with local and regional plans.\n\n(A) Michael: He thanked Rich for his insights. NPS met with the Metropolitan Planning Organization and the Governor’s office on some of their transportation priorities. He said one of the reasons why he wanted to bring up this topic at this meeting was so we do not compete against each other, but to also add an opportunity for the Partnership to look at collective impact and how they hitch their wagons up to each other.\n\n(Q) Elizabeth Solomon: She suggested that the Partnership needs to look at what the infrastructure priorities are for the city and the state. She said not to sound controversial, she loves the Harbor Islands, but she does not think that it is a critical infrastructure area in terms of connecting the people. She would feel more comfortable if there was a priority around equitable access to the Harbor Islands, but absent that there are more critical infrastructure issues within the Greater Boston area. She would not want to support funding for the Harbor Islands if it meant it would take away funding for some other critical infrastructure project. She said as a community, not just as a Partnership, they should really look at their priorities and to look beyond the Harbor Islands.\n\n(A) Michael: He thanked Elizabeth for her comments and noted that when they looked through the whole BIL they tried to be very strategic in terms of funding opportunities. He said that there are certain funding programs which only the National Park Service can apply, so they would only be competing with other National Park Service sites. He also said that opportunities like the BIL could allow the Partnership to look at the Gateway elements of the Boston Harbor Islands – places like Long Wharf, Charlestown, or other shoreline areas. He said they are not just chasing dollars for dollars sake, but instead have been strategic and focused. They are working with Climate-Ready Boston and others on how they can meet multiple goals and multiple objectives. He said look at the collective impact of what the Partnership might be able to do with regards to what the city, the state, the national park, and other federal agencies might be able to do to address climate change, equity and accessibility issues, green energy, and transit systems. He noted he did not have a lot of time to fully explain this topic, but he wanted to give some background. He said they have had about three meetings with some Partners to start looking at the opportunities, has attended a White House Advisory Council group briefing with other Boston area federal agencies, attended several NPS briefings on the BIL, and they have hired someone to look at strategic opportunities for the Partnership.\n\n(Q) Cathie Stone: She noted the importance of collective action as it could bring some focus on some needs they have expressed for a long time, but never had the money to address. She also suggested it might be a good time to pull together a small working group to see how the Partnership could capitalize on this opportunity and she where the Partnership might focus. She said the Partnership has a unique authority as a collective for goals that the collective really believes in that can be important and not used by anyone else.\n\n(A) Michael: He said he was trying to make people aware of some of the opportunities that he thought the Harbor Islands have, including the Gateways and to look strategically. He wanted to hear from folks in the Partnership today and as a follow-up maybe sending out more detailed information related to the Partnership and how they can begin to look at collective action to see where the synergies might exist.\n\n(Q) Joe Bagley: He said he understands that the NPS can apply for certain NPS infrastructure projects and for the Harbor Islands, the Long Island Bridge comes to mind. He asked if anyone from the city has contacted the NPS about the Long Island Bridge?\n\n(A) Michael: He said no one from the city has contact the NPS about the Long Island Bridge project. He did add that while there is a lot of money, but a project like Long Island Bridge would have to compete with other NPS projects, which there is already a lot of tough competition.\n\n(Q) Jack Murray: He noted that a lot of the money coming out of the federal government has spending guidelines. He then asked if Michael had a sense of the timing in which the federal government will be ready to accept applications or when they would be putting out a call for applications? He wanted to know how quickly the Partnership needed to move on this.\n\n(A) Michael: He said the federal government is already moving on this as parts of the Fiscal Year 2022 package is already populated. He said they have been trying to get a jump start on some of this to initiate conversations with the city, state, BHN, Stone Living Lab, and others just to see and feel out what opportunities should they apply for with the potential projects he presented today. He went on to say that the NPS has already asked parks to submit projects, especially for pilot projects/programs. He said he does not have an understanding from the NPS transportation funding what the schedules or announcements will be. He went on to say that even from the White house briefing he attended that other federal agencies are still trying to figure out the BIL and how to distribute all this money.\n\nAnniversary Year Steering Committee Updates, Michael Creasey, National Park Service & Priscilla Geigis, MA Department of Conservation and Recreation.\n\nBefore Fred introduced Priscilla, he shared images of a banner with the Anniversary logo that will fly on one of the MWRA buildings on Deer Island.\n\nPriscilla provided an overview of the Free Ferry Day season kick-off event at Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park with speakers from many of the Partners.

After several weeks of joint training on everything from island operations and programming to de-escalation, value setting and team building, the team is gearing up for opening day this Saturday.\n\nMost of the NPS Science and Stewardship seasonal team has also started their seasons – this is our biggest seasonal crew yet – they will be out doing habitat restoration, connecting the community to the park through hands-on projects, and mapping landscape and ecosystem features.\n\nNPS welcomes Amy Carrillo through our Scientist in Parks Internship program. Amy will be working with researchers at Boston University to share the results of their study predicting island erosion into the future, and what facilities and natural and historic elements might be impacted. The focus is on 9 islands – notably including Georges, Gallops, Peddocks, Long, Little Brewster and Thompson. Note that this project was presented to the Partnership about 3 years ago by Julie Wormser when it was starting. Marc Albert and Amy will be reaching out to island owner contacts to make sure the maps and graphics are helpful and easily available, and we hope to have Amy back to a BHIP meeting later this Summer or Fall to report out.\n\nEducation, Youth, and Volunteer Engagement (EYVE) team also has welcomed new seasonal staff. That team has been leading a year-long exploration of the National Parks of Boston with four Boston Public Schools - which will conclude with a culminating experience on a visit to Spectacle Island this Spring, coordinated with DCR.\n\nCity of Boston, Joe Bagley\n\nNo updates today\n\nBoston Planning and Development Authority\n\nNo representative available at the time of Roundtable\n\nMassachusetts Water Resource Authority, Fred Laskey\n\nLooking forward to the fishing day out on Deer Island. It is a great opportunity for people to learn about that Deer Island is a part of a larger national park.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nSuzanne Gall Marsh, Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands\n\nVery excited about everything that is happening. She is excited about the information that Michael shared regarding the BIL, but hopes there is an opportunity for the public to share their input on their hopes and dreams for the Harbor Islands. She is also concerned about access/equity given that it costs $25 roundtrip for an adult to head to the Islands.

He also said it was the kind of work we wished the Partnership was doing to cross pollinate the wisdom and resources.\n\nMichael went on to provide an update on the work the Red Bridge Group has done over the last year. At the last three meetings time was dedicated to taking a look at the future. The initial goals were: to increase awareness and advocacy for the Boston Harbor Islands; to celebrate successes in order to look back as well as move forward; to enhance engagement opportunities; and update the strategic vision for the Partnership as well as the Park itself. The Partnership dedicated the last three Partnership meetings to hear from the Partnership and public on looking back, identifying accomplishments, and how the Partnership can leverage its resources to make a collective impact. At the last meeting the Partnership looked at opportunities for the future and identified several priorities: equitable access to the Islands/waterfront; focus on climate change impacts; elevating the collective impact of the Partnership (identified almost $260 million dollars of funds leveraged over the past 25 years); committing to diversity, equity, and inclusion; and ensuring the Partnership has the capacity to be a sustainable model.\n\nMichael said that over the next several weeks they hope to develop an outline from what they have learned from the last several sessions, continue to look at outreach modeling, and begin to look at the futures report for the Partnership so they can share with the broader public to get feedback. Michael then introduced Priscilla Geigis from MA DCR.\n\nPriscilla Geigis thanked the work the committees are doing. She noted she saw members of the Partnership IRL (in real life) doing a site visit for the upcoming May 21st Kick-off event and it was great to feel the excitement of that event. The work the committees are doing has been tremendous and this is on top of all the other jobs people do. She hoped that work like this can be the framework for the Partnership in the next 25 years and it has been a great way to re-engage everyone and to have a specific focus. She then introduced the Committee leads who have also dedicated a lot of effort into the anniversary years.\n\nProgramming Team, Liza Stearns, NPS\n\nReiterated that the Programming Team is not working in silo, but engaged closely with the Steering Committee, the Communications and Engagement Teams. They have also been working with other partners and people in the community to co-author programming set up for the anniversary year and set a framework on how they should move forward.\n\nThe team developed a robust menu of anniversary programs/events for this year. The team is now broken up into dynamic action teams to move programming from concept to activation/execution.\n\nThe group meets together every two weeks, but it is the subgroups working in"
