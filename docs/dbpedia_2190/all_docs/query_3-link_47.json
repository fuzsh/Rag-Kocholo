        "text": "The Bear Season Three (2024)\n\nWritten by Christopher Storer, Matty Matheson, Courtney Storer, Will Guidara, Catherine Schetina, Joanna Calo, and Alex Russell\n\nDirected by Christopher Storer, Duccio Fabbri, Ayo Edebiri, and Joanna Calo\n\nFairweather fans always seem to balk at season three. I remember when Mad Men Season Three premiered, and slowly but surely, people who had loved it for the first two years decided that elements of the show they had enjoyed were suddenly not good any longer. I found it to be one the best seasons in the run, finally allowing its characters to face the unwelcome truths in their lives. Lost Season Three is still maligned by so many when it has probably the best season finale of the entire show’s run. The best television moves at its own pace. You are either in rhythm with it, or you are not. In an era where plot and IP-driven television seem to dominate the landscape, it is refreshing to have something that chooses character over plot.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – The Bear Season Three”\n\nNorthern Exposure Season Three (1991-92)\n\nWritten by Martin Sage, Sybill Adelman, Ellen Herman, Robin Green, Stuart Stevens, Henry Bromell, Dennis Koenig, Jordan Budde, Craig Volk, Diane Frolov, Andrew Schneider, Jeff Melvoin, David Assael, Mitchell Burgess, Kate Boutilier, Jeffrey Vlaming\n\nDirected by Nick Marck, Bill D’Elia, Miles Watkins, Jim Hayman, David Carson, Sandy Smolan, Michael Katleman, Jack Bender, Michael Fresco, Lee Shallat, Dean Parisot, Rob Thompson, Matthew Nodella, Steve Robman, Tom Moore\n\nThis was the season where the awards started coming in for Northern Exposure. It was also the first season to have a complete order, twenty-two episodes. The budget has been increased, and the amount of care put into many of these episodes approaches cinematic levels. I had to check what year these episodes came out, 1991-92, but they feel more complex than something you would expect from CBS then. It’s become clear to me how this show was one of the experimental US programs of the 1990s that paved the way for the prestige TV of the cable era.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – Northern Exposure Season Three”\n\nFoundation Season Two (2023)\n\nWritten by David S. Goyer, Jane Espenson, Leigh Dana Jackson, Joelle Garfinkel, Eric Carrasco, David Kob, Liz Phang, Addie Manis, and Bob Oltra\n\nDirected by Alex Graves, David S. Goyer, Mark Tonderai, and Roxann Dawson\n\nI was a big fan of the first season of Foundation, but I saw that several critics and viewers found its structure confusing. There are definitely some time jumps that allow many changes to happen. I started to see the show as a mix of serialized storytelling and anthology. Each season would have some cast that would carry over because of cryosleep or cloning. The rest of the cast would rotate out at the end of each season as we jumped centuries ahead to see the Empire’s decline and the Foundation’s rise. Apparently, people liked season two even more, so we’ll have a third coming in the next few years. This second season focused on showing how flawed systems are where one figurehead is expected to lead millions or billions, or in the case of one locale, a few dozen.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – Foundation Season Two”\n\nThe Sympathizer (2024)\n\nWritten by Park Chan-wook, Don McKellar, Naomi Iizuka, Mark Richard, Maegan Houang, and Anchuli Felicia King\n\nDirected by Park Chan-wook, Fernando Meirelles, and Marc Munden\n\nThe portrayal of communism in Western media is fraught with contradiction. It has to be because to honestly present communism would mean capitalism would be critiqued in detail. Part of the ongoing American imperialist project is ensuring no cogent critiques of the dominant economic system happen. This means when communism is presented, it is always a brutal internment camp where people are tortured. This disregards the fact the United States has and continues to operate brutal internment camps where people are tortured. It seems that this behavior isn’t inherent to communism but something people seem to do regardless of the economic system they live under. While The Sympathizer starts out strong, its lead director steps aside three episodes in, and a very neoliberal centrist viewpoint leaves it as an imperfect creation.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – The Sympathizer”\n\nThe End of Evangelion (1997)\n\nWritten by Hideaki Anno\n\nDirected by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Hideaki Anno\n\nApparently, a large enough contingent of viewers were dissatisfied with the ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion, and creator Hideaki Anno produced this follow-up feature that exists parallel to that conclusion. From what I read, it sounded like Anno went back and forth between his original concept and some altered ideas. It is a very jarring experience for the central narrative to suddenly collapse into an internal dialogue between Shinji and mental projections of the important people in life. There’s also a meta-commentary on anime cliches that pops up and a weirdly upbeat ending. Several questions were left unanswered, so it was decided to go back and add more to the finale.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – The End of Evangelion”\n\nOuter Range Season Two (2024)\n\nWritten by Cameron Litvack, Glenise Mullins, Dagny Atencio Looper, Jenna Westover, Doug Petrie, Marilyn Thomas, Aïda Mashaka Croal, and Randy Redroad\n\nDirected by Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Deborah Kampmeier, Blackhorse Lowe, Josh Brolin, and Catriona McKenzie\n\nOuter Range was one of my most pleasant streaming TV surprises in 2022. This Amazon series was different from what I expected after seeing the promotional images of Josh Brolin in a cowboy hat standing in a field. My assumption was that this was some Yellowstone copycat. I could not have been more wrong. Instead, I found a complex and bizarre show about a man displaced in time & space and the odd ripples that seemed to have in his personal life and community. The end of season one dropped a significant twist (which I may have to talk about in this review, so beware if spoilers are a thing for you) that excited me to see where the show went next. Then news of strife behind the scenes came out, and I wondered if we would ever see season two. We have now, but not without dramatic changes, which have altered the original tone.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – Outer Range Season Two”\n\nX-Men ‘97 Season One (2024)\n\nWritten by Beau DeMayo, Charley Feldman, JB Ballard, and Anthony Sellitti\n\nDirected by Jake Castorena, Chase Conley, and Emi-Emmett Yonemura\n\nI was a big fan of the X-Men animated series on Fox in the 1990s. It just so happened that it aired at the same time as my sister’s beloved Saved By the Bell. Thank goodness for VCRs. I ended up with quite a few episodes on tape to rewatch them, which I did many times over. I can’t say I kept up with the show well after the first three seasons. I definitely never would have guessed we’d see a revival of the series and one that doesn’t just try and recreate the original. Instead, this is a slight maturation of the format and the quality of storytelling. It still reads like Saturday morning cartoons, albeit with a more modern serialized structure.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – X-Men ’97”\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion – Episodes 19 through 26\n\nWritten by Hideaki Anno, Akio Satsukawa, and Hiroshi Yamaguchi\n\nDirected by Masayuki, Masahiko Ōtsuka, Hiroyuki Ishidō, Akira Takamura, Shōichi Masuo, and Kazuya Tsurumaki\n\nWhen I first started watching Neon Genesis Evangelion at the start of the year, I read that some fans hated the ending of the anime series. I wanted to know why that could be. Now that I have finished the show, I completely understand why some of the audience would not like this. I, however, am a big weirdo, and I loved it, yet I get that it goes in a wildly different direction and doesn’t provide the direct sort of conclusion you might expect from a show about giant “robots” fighting monsters from space. Of course, I will be watching and reviewing the two feature films that serve as a complementary ending next month, but for now, I just want to focus on the series.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – Neon Genesis Evangelion Episodes 19 thru 26”\n\nNorthern Exposure Season Two (1991)\n\nWritten by Robin Green, Henry Bromell, Andrew Schneider, Diane Frolov, Ellen Herman, and David Assael\n\nDirected by Stuart Margolin, Sandy Smolan, Nick Marck, Steve Robman, Rob Thompson, Bill D’Elia, and David Carson\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen such a deftly handled realignment on a show as I have with Season Two of Northern Exposure. While Season One wasn’t terrible, it was pretty one-note until the end. For the most part, the show was a fish-out-of-water story about Joel Fleishman (Rob Morrow), an NYC doctor transplanted to the remote environs of Alaska. There’s only so much you can do with that premise, and by season two, the showrunners understood this and pivoted away from making every episode center on that concept. What we get instead is a wonderfully written & performed ensemble piece that is clearly influenced by the flights of fancy found in shows like Moonlighting.\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – Northern Exposure Season Two”\n\nFoundation Season One (AppleTV+)\n\nWritten by David S. Goyer, Josh Friedman, Olivia Purnell, Lauren Bello, Leigh Dana Jackson, Marcus Gardley, Caitlin Saunders, Sarah Nolen, and Victoria Morrow\n\nDirected by Rupert Sanders, Andrew Bernstein, Alex Graves, Jennifer Phang, and Roxann Dawson\n\nYou’ve bought a reprieve, but war with Empire is inevitable. In the meantime, remember this day, remember what we’re striving towards. I know a thousand years can seem like an eternity, but it’s the blink of an eye when measured against the whole of human history, and it could so easily slip through our fingers if we’re not vigilant. – Hari Seldon (Jared Harris)\n\nContinue reading “TV Review – Foundation Season One”"
