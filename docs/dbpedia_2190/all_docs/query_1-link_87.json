        "text": "Tamyra Gray, a finalist on Fox television’s talent show “American Idol,” has joined the cast of the network’s dramatic series “Boston Public.” Gray, who is from Norcross, Ga., will portray a student in four episodes of the series, with her first appearance coinciding with the February sweeps.\n\n“She gave a very impressive audition and while it’s possible her character will sing, we are most interested in helping to launch her as a dramatic actress,” said “Boston Public” executive producer Jason Katims.\n\nAs previously reported, Atlanta-born Justin Guarini, the runner-up on “American Idol,” has been signed to a record contract with the U.K.-based 19 Recordings Limited, which is headed by the show’s creator, Simon Fuller.\n\nGray and Guarini, along with “Idol” winner Kelly Clarkson and the rest of the show’s finalists, are out on a national concert tour. The trek stops next in San Antonio, Texas, tomorrow (Oct. 12), and will be out on the road through a Nov. 20 finale in Seattle.\n\nCopyright 2002 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
