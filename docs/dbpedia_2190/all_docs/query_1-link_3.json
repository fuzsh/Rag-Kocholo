        "meta_description": "Chapter One: Directed by Thomas Schlamme. With Jessalyn Gilsig, Chi McBride, Anthony Heald, Nicky Katt. Another school year is off to a booming start at Winslow High School - an urban high school outside of Boston. Principal Steven Harper spends his days putting out fires, defending his faculty and just trying to keep it together. Lauren Davis, the idealistic head of the social studies department, and Harry Senate, a geology teacher with buried secrets, are embroiled in controversy for failing the star running back before a huge game with the cross-town rivals. But they both have bigger personal problems. Lauren has been asked out on a date by the icy vice principal and Harry has been put on probation for wielding a gun in one of his classes. When he's not dodging the star running back's lawyer or pulling a bully off the class geek, Principal Harper is trying to calm Ms. Hendricks. She left her class after scrawling \"Gone to kill myself, hope you're happy\" on the chalkboard. Meanwhile, English teacher Milton Buttle has become the star attraction on student Sheryl Holt's website. His unflattering, animated portrayal has made Buttle the butt of everyone's jokes. And let's not forget dear old Mr. Lipschultz. The 80-year-old American history teacher kicked popular Dana Poole out of class for not wearing a bra.",

        "text": "I'm sad when I recognize the low attention to this great TV show. I think everything has some defects but as a mass, it is a wonderful series. I think that when the show lost Harry Senate it loses a powerful role that no one can fill in. that is the the most important loss in this show. I was so attracted to this great show that is recently ended in an Arabic open channel ( mbc 4 ).It is interesting to watch a real live drama about everyday life of Winslow High School. I was surprised about these losses in the great cast every episode that the producer thinks it is important for the plot to be successful!!! I hope you will give this show its true place in the history of American TV shows. Thank you."
