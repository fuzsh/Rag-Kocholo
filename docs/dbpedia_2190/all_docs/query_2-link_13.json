In April 2000, the GBH Archives in Boston was awarded a National Endowment for the Humanities Archives and Special Collections Preservation and Access grant to arrange, describe, and reformat master Say Brother programs dating from 1968 to 1982 to keep the collection accessible. GBH welcomes you to explore this invaluable programming, whether performance, political commentary, or conversations with distinct voices from the African American community.\n\nView project staff and funding."
