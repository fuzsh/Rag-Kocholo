KelleyOctober 23, 2000 ( )1B01\n\nAnother school year is off to a booming start at Winslow High School – an urban high school outside of Boston. Principal Steven Harper spends his days resolving problems, defending his faculty and just trying to keep it together. Lauren Davis, the idealistic head of the social studies department, and Harry Senate, a geology teacher with buried secrets, are embroiled in controversy for failing the star running back before a huge game with the cross-town rivals. But they both have bigger personal problems. Lauren has been asked out on a date by icy Vice Principal Scott Guber, and Harry has been put on probation for wielding a gun in one of his classes. When he is not dodging the star running back's lawyer or pulling a bully off the class geek, Principal Harper is trying to calm Ms. Hendricks. She left her class after scrawling \"Gone to kill myself, hope you're happy\" on the chalkboard. Meanwhile, English teacher Milton Buttle has become the star attraction on student Sheryl Holt's website. His unflattering, animated portrayal has made Buttle the butt of everyone's jokes. Also, Harvey Lipschultz, the 80-year-old American history teacher, kicked popular student Dana Poole out of class for not wearing a bra.\n\n22\"Chapter Two\"Jack BenderDavid E. KelleyOctober 30, 2000 ( )1B02\n\nLast week's bra protest has resulted in school unity. All the girls have decided to go bra-less in a show of solidarity with Dana Poole. The superintendent is pressing Harper because Lauren has rallied a few of the other teachers, and they all refuse to get fingerprinted. Also, Marla, who is supposed to be on medical leave, has arrived at work. Lipschultz, the man behind the bra debacle, has shown up on Sheryl Holt's infamous website in a bra and panties. Meanwhile, Vice Principal Guber tries to regain control by meeting with Dana Poole. He suspects that she is high, so he demands a urine sample. She protests and bolts to Harry.\n\n33\"Chapter Three\"Mel DamskiDavid E. KelleyNovember 6, 2000 ( )1B03\n\nPrincipal Harper's job is in jeopardy and an impending school board meeting has him on edge. Still, he can't help but get involved when Anthony Ward is found hanging upside down from the roof. It turns out the entire soccer team has ganged up on little Anthony since he thwarted their attempts to download answers for a test. Harper's decision to suspend the entire team, and thereby forfeit the soccer season, only adds fuel to Superintendent Marla Shinn's fire. Meanwhile, Harry Senate confesses to kissing Dana Poole and explains her blackmail scheme. Guber sends a shocked Dana to Bob \"Big Boy\" Lick for counseling but Harper does not suspend Senate. Coach Riley, on the other hand, is dealing with a football team who has marked one of their teammates as gay and will not shower with him. Plus, Lauren is left to defend herself when Superintendent Shinn questions the topic of cannibalism being taught in Lauren's classroom. At the school board meeting, things come to a head when all of the faculty's – and Principal Harper's – indiscretions are exposed. Surprisingly, an impassioned speech by Marla Hendricks puts everything into perspective, and even manages to silence Superintendent Shinn whom she calls for only showing up when it’s convenient. At least, temporarily.\n\n44\"Chapter Four\"Bryan GordonDavid E. KelleyNovember 13, 2000 ( )1B04\n\nRehearsals are in full swing for the annual charity show. Marilyn is dismayed to learn that the main skit the students have prepared is a spoof of the Winslow High faculty – complete with a gun-toting Senate and Buttle stuck inside a donkey! Elsewhere on campus, Lauren enters a stairwell and catches two student body presidential candidates engaged in a sex act. Lauren confronts the students – Peter and Susan – who deny any wrongdoing. However, when Peter later drops out of the election, it becomes clear that Susan's sexual favor was a motivating factor. On top of all this, Lauren must also deal with John LeBlonde. John's an excellent student on the recently suspended soccer team and needs Harper's approval to apply for a prestigious academic award.\n\n55\"Chapter Five\"Rachel TalalayDavid E. KelleyNovember 20, 2000 ( )1B05\n\nIt's Thanksgiving week, but no one seems particularly grateful. Guber, for example, is still upset over his onstage serenade at the charity show. Football player Jason Harrelson broke bully Malcolm White's arm during a fight in the hall. Buttle is starring in yet another Sheryl Holt original online humiliation cartoon. Last, but not least, Lauren discovered a senior sex posse which awards senior guys points for sex. In response to the sex posse scandal, Principal Harper organizes a sophomore assembly to preach the benefits of chastity. The teachers draw straws, and Lipschultz is chosen to head up the event. Later at the assembly, Lipschultz' boring speech turns shocking when he confesses to catching his beloved late wife in bed with another man.\n\n66\"Chapter Six\"Jonathan PontellDavid E. KelleyNovember 27, 2000 ( )1B06\n\nA popular and beloved teacher, Mr. McMahon, has a heart attack and dies at school. A close friend of the deceased, Principal Harper overcomes his own grief to help his students cope with the loss. To make matters worse, it appears that McMahon had been having an affair with a female senior, Karen Fitzgerald. While Harper struggles to deal with the incident's aftermath and maintain status quo, the students and faculty begin to fall apart. A defiant pupil, Webster, spits on Lauren and she vows to have him expelled. The case becomes more complex, however, when Harper learns that Webster was close to Mr. McMahon and is extremely upset over his death.\n\n77\"Chapter Seven\"Michael SchultzDavid E. KelleyDecember 4, 2000 ( )1B07\n\nLife seems to be one big lawsuit for Principal Harper. First, Mrs. Walsh, who was fired for spanking her students, sues for wrongful termination. Then, after Harper suspends Sheryl Holt for offensive content on her website, she sues to get the suspension overturned. Lauren gets knocked out by a launched breast implant. While Marylin counsels the girl on her self-image, Lauren decides to let the boyfriend off the hook. In court, Lipschultz's testimony – on both the Holt and Walsh cases – is disastrous and results in two losses for the school.\n\n88\"Chapter Eight\"David SemelDavid E. KelleyDecember 11, 2000 ( )1B08\n\nButtle meets a beautiful girl, Lisa, who shares his love of Shakespeare. Back at Winslow High, Senate learns that Juan Figgis' mother has been convicted on drug charges and is going to prison.

KelleyJanuary 15, 2001 ( )1B10\n\nSheryl Holt breaks the news about Milton and Lisa's secret affair on her website.

Meanwhile, Marylin suspects that a girl in her class is a victim of incest when the student writes a \"fictional\" essay about her father molesting her. In the middle of this crisis, Guber asks Lipschultz to resign after accusing him of being a racist.\n\n1111\"Chapter Eleven\"Alan MyersonDavid E. KelleyJanuary 22, 2001 ( )1B11\n\nCoach Riley has a serious crush on Marylin Sudor but is nervous about asking her out due to their racial differences. Meanwhile, Harper is concerned about the cheerleading squad. They have been rehearsing for an important competition, but their new routine is extremely sexual. The choreographer argues that it's impossible to tone down the program, so Harper cancels the meet. Regardless of the consequences, Lisa and Buttle continue to tempt fate and continue their heated affair, and in an effort to help his kids discuss their feelings, Senate forms a \"Suicide Club,\" which outrages parents and faculty alike.\n\n1212\"Chapter Twelve\"Alex GravesDavid E. Kelley, John J. Sakmar & Kerry LenhartFebruary 5, 2001 ( )1B12\n\nAs Senate approaches the school grounds, he saves a student from being attacked by gang members. After numerous attempts, Harry finally manages to get the boy to reveal that he is a member of the Crips. Meanwhile, Harper grows even more suspicious about Lisa and Buttle's deepening friendship, so Guber takes the reins and alerts Lisa's parents about their daughter's rumored affair. In the midst of these crises, Lauren has her hands full trying to help an overweight female wrestler, Christine, cope with the loss of her boyfriend.\n\n1313\"Chapter Thirteen\"Jonathan PontellDavid E. KelleyFebruary 12, 2001 ( )1B13\n\nWhen Coach Riley is fired for withholding information about Buttle's affair, he hires the best attorneys in Boston – Ellenor Frutt and Jimmy Berluti. Ellenor immediately begins subpoenaing witnesses, sending a message to Winslow High that she means business. Meanwhile, Lauren discovers that Harry had dated another co-worker, Jenna, before her.
