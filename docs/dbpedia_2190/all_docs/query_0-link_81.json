        "text": "A locally trained professional dancer and choreographer who studied under E. Virginia Williams and Lynne Simonson and performed in Peter Goss Compagnie de Danse and Matt Mattox JazzArt Company, Joanne began teaching classes in the area in the mid-1970s. When she opened the Joanne Langione Dance Center in 1976, it was the first “family center” in Newton. Over the course of those early years she designed a program based on her background in dance and choreography that combines sound training, artistry, discipline, performance and fun to a wide range of students. Though it is constantly evolving and modernizing, that program continues to form the core of JLDC’s approach to dance, to teaching and to character building. A recipient of the Elsa H. Kemp Memorial Award in teaching, Joanne has taught Ballet and Jazz technique at all levels and holds the Teacher’s Advanced Professional Certificate from The Dance Teacher’s Association of Boston affiliated with the American Society.\n\nMeli Currie joined JLDC in 2003 and was appointed Managing Director in 2007 and today serves as Director overseeing the schools’ training and creative process. In addition, Ms. Currie is head of Faculty and Students serving as school principal managing all level classes and performances and has created a vision that inspires JLDC education teams to do their best work. Meli has spent her career dedicated to teaching and mentoring students of all ages. Using her background in education and psychology and teaching experience, Meli has earned the respect and devotion of a generation of JLDC students. During Meli’s tenure at JLDC, she has produced JLDC’S Senior Solo Performance Concert, SeniorSpeak for the past ten years. As a choreographer, Meli has created ballet performance productions highlighting students of the JLDC middle school preparatory program. Meli directs the JLDC Student Wellness Initiative that allows students to learn the discipline of dance in healthy ways while forming strong peer relationships. Ms. Currie serves on the JLDC Board of Directors.\n\nMeli began her dance studies in a strict ballet environment in which she excelled. This advanced training at an early age afforded her full scholarship to NYC’s Joffrey Ballet Company Trainee Program in her early teens. Once in New York Meli began to seek out other opportunities in dance genres conducive to her changing body and mindset which led her to study ballet and modern in New York City with David Howard and Finis Jung.\n\nWhile a dance major at U. Mass Amherst under Andrea Watkins, Meli received her BFA with honors in Dance Technique and Theory. Meli was an instructor in the Dance Dept. of Harvard University for 3 years.\n\nJaime Endreny leads the school as Executive Director, having joined in 2015 after a wide range of experiences leading arts organizations. Jaime’s vision for JLDC is to expand its reach while continuing the school’s traditions. As you enter the halls of JLDC’s state-of-the-art facility you’ll be greeted by the historic photo gallery that she curated.\n\nPrior to joining JLDC, Jaime served as Executive Director of The Center for Architecture Foundation, New York for six years where she created Arts programs for over 5000 New York City school age children each year. She held previous positions with NYC Clifford Ross Studio, the Brooklyn Arts Council and Providence CityArts Council. Jaime is a graduate of Colby College and New York University, Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service with an MPA in Arts Management.\n\nJaime began her training with her mom, Joanne at JLDC and continued at Concord Academy under Richard Colton and Amy Spencer, former members of Twyla Tharp Dance. Jaime continued her dance training at Colby spending summers in NYC at Alvin Ailey School for intense training in ballet and modern.
