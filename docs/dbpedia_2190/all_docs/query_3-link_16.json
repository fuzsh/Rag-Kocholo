        "text": "Game of Thrones director Alex Graves is in early talks to helm Sony’s live-action film Mulan.\n\nThe story is based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan, the daughter of an aged warrior who disguises herself as a man in order to take her father’s place in the army and go to war.\n\nWith a script by Mirror Mirror‘s Jason Keller, the project is being co-financed by Doug Belgrad via his new banner 2.0 Entertainment. Sony is planning the pic as an international/Chinese co-production.\n\nSony is one of two studios working on a live-action version of Mulan. Disney, which made the 1998 animated film, is also moving quickly on a film, setting a release date of November 2018.\n\nGraves has directed several episodes of HBO’s Game of Thrones, along with episodes of Proof, House of Cards and Bloodline. He also wrote and directed the 1997 film Casualties. Graves is repped by WME and Loeb & Loeb."
