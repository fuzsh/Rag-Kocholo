Playing pop to a trio of challenging teens (blossoming Hillary, sexually misunderstood Larry and videogamer Mike) is Michael Rapaport (Small Time Crooks, Hitch), whose previous TV run was as a firebrand teacher on Boston Public. TVGuide.com got a few minutes during the busy actor's lunch break to discuss fatherhood, films and his real-life friend in need.\n\nTVGuide.com: What did your three-season stint as Boston Public's Danny teach you?\n\nMichael Rapaport: It taught me that good work is good work, and having the opportunity to act every day is a really special thing. That's what I walked away [with].\n\nTVGuide.com: Did it give you an appetite for further episodic series such as War at Home?\n\nRapaport: It definitely did. I liked the consistency of the work and, as I said, I enjoy acting a lot. So often in this business, you rarely get to act; you spend time trying to get jobs and that kind of thing. But what's great about doing a TV show, especially one that I like, is that you do get to act every day, as opposed to chasing work, which is a real pain in the ass.\n\nTVGuide.com: Some liken War at Home to Married... with Children. Do you agree with that comparison?\n\nRapaport: I think it's more like a Roseanne or an All in the Family. Although Married... with Children was an extraordinarily funny show, this show is based in a stronger sense of reality.\n\nTVGuide.com: Are you excited about Sunday's premiere?\n\nRapaport: I'm really, really, really excited. I'm so proud of this show and so proud of the cast. I can't wait for people to see it. I think once people see it they're going to enjoy it. I really believe in this show\n\nTVGuide.com: How do you like Anita Barone (The Jeff Foxworthy Show) as your TV wife?\n\nRapaport: I love her. She's great. Dave and Vicky have a good, healthy, fun and playful relationship  they're friends and still very attracted to and sexually into each other.\n\nTVGuide.com: Where are you coming from to play a father of teens? Your own kids aren't nearly that old.\n\nRapaport: A big inspiration for me is always my father, and I also sort of take from [creator/executive producer] Rob Lotterstein's inspiration, which is his father. But the fact that I am a father of two boys  Julian, who's 5, and Maceo, my 3-year-old  is obviously the best firsthand experience I have.\n\nTVGuide.com: What do you make of the pseudo-\"controversy\" of a show titled The War at Home's debuting on 9/11?\n\nRapaport: I didn't even think about it. It didn't cross my mind.\n\nTVGuide.com: Not that you are averse to controversy, which you experienced much of as a cast member of Bamboozled.\n\nRapaport: I'm extremely proud of that movie. It dealt with a lot of stereotypes in the black community and the way they are exploited by Hollywood  the television industry, more specifically  and it didn't pull any punches. [Writer/director] Spike [Lee] took incredible risks making it, and because of the controversy and all that, it didn't get a chance. But it's a very, very important movie that people should be able to enjoy for a long time.\n\nTVGuide.com: Are there any new films coming up that you're particularly proud of?\n\nRapaport: Special, which is going to premiere at the [January 2006] Sundance Film Festival, I'm really excited about. It's a little independent movie about a guy who is sort of depressed and sheltered and he winds up taking an antidepressant and starts to [experience] adverse reactions  he starts to think he has supernatural powers because the medication doesn't really work properly. It has a dark, comedic element to it, but it's really a dramatic portrayal of a guy who is suffering from depression and is desperate to try to fix it. I'm enormously proud of it, and I'm looking forward to people getting a chance to see it.\n\nTVGuide.com: Lastly, I'd like to ask if you have heard any updates regarding Natasha Lyonne (American Pie). [Rapaport's longtime friend/Comic Book Villains cast mate was recently in a New York City hospital ICU with hepatitis C, a collapsed lung and a heart infection.]\n\nRapaport: I haven't spoken to her. I hope she's doing good. I've been thinking about her a lot lately and I care about her....\n\nTVGuide.com: I saw somewhere that her father was threatening the hospital with a lawsuit for violating confidentiality and letting her admittance be leaked out.\n\nRapaport: The thing about her father that hasn't been put out there is... she doesn't speak to her father  she has a restraining order against him  so he's just trying to get his face into the papers for some reason. I don't know why a sixtysomething-year-old man would be so interested in getting in the press when his daughter is so sick. Natasha knows how I feel about her, aside from all the stuff that we went through [when her unruly behavior forced Rapaport to evict Lyonne from an apartment building he owns]. She's like family to me. She's a very, very good person, and I'm hoping that she's able to get better.\n\n6.8.05 - Jessalyn Gilsig is being promoted to cast regular on Nip/Tuck.\n\n3.16.05 - Chi McBride has been cast in the Fox drama pilot Deviant Behavior.\n\n3.8.05 - Nicky Katt has been added to the cast of The Evidence, a new show from Warner Bros.

Unplugs for 'Boston Public' - So many people are crowded into Doyle's Cafe on the set of FOX's \"Boston Public\" that, if it were a real pub, the place might be in violation of the fire code. The occasion is the filming of \"Chapter Seventy-Six,\" the Friday, Dec. 19, episode of the high-school drama, and it's far from business as usual on the soundstages in Manhattan Beach, Calif....\n\n10.29.03 - R.E.M. will perform an acoustic version of \"Losing My Religion\" during Boston Public's Christmas-themed episode Dec. 19.

The Boston Public grad will play a sapphic singer who develops a crush on Rachel True's Mona character on the Nov. 3 episode of UPN's Half & Half. The 24-year-old crooner admits she had some reservations about making her sitcom debut with such a \"challenging\" role.\n\n\"In the beginning [I was a little apprehensive], but mostly because I didn't know the other actress, Rachel, who I was playing side-by-side with,\" she tells TV Guide Online. \"But it's kind of lighthearted, so it wasn't so bad. It wasn't bad at all, actually; it was pretty easy.\"\n\nIn the story, Mona tries to sign a hot new singer named Zora (Gray) to Delicious Records, but the hetero-leaning exec quickly realizes that the artist is sporting designs on more than just a lucrative album deal. \"My character on Boston Public was a little shy,\" Gray says. \"[Zora] is much more outgoing and aggressive.\"\n\nUm, just how aggressive are we talking here? \"There are no kissing scenes,\" laughs Gray. \"That probably would have been my [deal]breaker, because I don't know if I'm ready for it just yet.\"\n\nWhen Gray is not pursuing girls, er, acting gigs, she's busy putting the finishing touches on her debut album, which is due out in the spring. \"For the most part, I will have written most of my album except for one song,\" says the Maryland native, who describes the CD as \"a blend of old school and new school, with alternative pop and R&B.\"\n\nAnd if Gray has it her way, her album's release will coincide with another big career development. \"Hopefully by the time my album is about to drop, then I'll be back on Boston Public,\" she says with a smile, \"because [my character] ended with a record deal. So, she'll have something to do.\" Sounds like Gray may have a future in marketing, too.\n\n10.9.03 - Zap2It.com: Milo Ventimiglia: Neither Bad Nor a Boy - \"My manager makes fun of me,\" says Milo Ventimiglia. \"He's like, 'Since you started in the business, you've aged eight years, but on television, you've only aged two or three.'

The hiring of actress Jeri Ryan by executive producer David E. Kelley to spice of Fox's Boston Public all but guaranteed an endless supply of tawdry double entendres. And the only disappointment in Ryan's first episode on October 29 was that the entendres didn't even aspire to the level of double. Kelley, who seems increasingly incapable of creating female characters who are not miniskirted sexpots, gave Ryan a truly inauspicious welcome. In one commercial for the series, Ryan, as teacher Ronnie Cooke, was asked by an inquisitive student whether she was a \"a real teacher.\" Her response\"Yes, are you a real student?\" was only slightly wittier than \"I know you are, but what am I?\" But the real indignity came when, in Ryan's first episode, a student asked to see her breasts. We've seen old Van Halen videos with more class.\n\n11.13.01 - David E. Kelley is developing a new series for Fox, but he's not writing it.

The show is about a 21 year old in NYC trying to make a career for herself on Broadway.\n\n10.31.01 - TV Guide Online reports that Fox's Monday night dramas returned to mixed results: Boston Public debuted strongly with 13.8 million viewers, but Ally McBeal averaged a disappointing 10.8 million viewers.\n\n10.30.01 - Don't miss the full-length article in the October 27th issue of TV Guide on new cast member Jeri Ryan.\n\n10.30.10 - The November 6th issue of Soap Opera Digest reports that Sharon Leal and fiancé Bev Land welcomed their first child, Kai Miles Land, into the world on September 13th.\n\n9.9.01 - Boston Public won one Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series (\"Chapter One\").\n\n8.6.01 - TV Guide Online: Jeri Ryan's New Boss - When Boston Public begins its sophomore year this September, Winslow High's male pupils won't be the only ones ogling former Star Trek: Voyager bombshell Jeri Ryan - who's enrolling as curvaceous corporate-lawyer-turned-teacher Ronnie Brooks...\n\n7.12.01 - Boston Public received 2 Emmy nominations including Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series (\"Chapter One\") and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series (Kathy Baker as Mrs. Peters).\n\n6.19.01 - The June 19th issue of Soap Opera Digest reports that Sharon Leal is pregnant.

During a conversation between teachers Harry and Lauren, a chalkboard in the background listed the day's assignment. Or rather, assingment.\"\n\n4.9.01 - Boston Public has received a Prism Commendation for the episode \"Chapter Eight.\" Prism recognizes work in which members of the entertainment community take an active role in addressing drug abuse in America.

I'm entitled to a tone,\" says the formidable Chi McBride as Steven Harper, the exasperated yet dedicated principal on Fox's high school melodrama Boston Public. McBride, best known for comedy (including UPN's notorious The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer), sets the dramatic tone for this often over-the-top series, projecting a powerful aura of quiet, steely authority, even when his fractious faculty and rebellious students wear him down. Both rational and explosive, McBride's Harper is a stern general who nonetheless inspires loyalty among his troops. In this role, McBridge shows he's an actor of, yes, principle."
