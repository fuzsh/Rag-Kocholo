A legacy of a time prior to 1488 when parliamentary and judicial proceedings were conducted in Norman.[21][22]\n\nIndia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn India, Roy is an anglicized variant of the surname Rai, likewise meaning \"king\". Rai (title) is a historical title of royalty and nobility in the Indian subcontinent used by rulers and chieftains of many princely states.[2]\n\nScotland\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name Roy is also found in Scotland, an anglicisation from the Scottish Gaelic nickname ruadh, meaning \"red\".[2]\n\nGiven name\n\n[edit]\n\nRoy Acuff (1903–1992), American country music singer and fiddler\n\nRoy Andersen (born 1955), Norwegian former long-distance runner\n\nRoy Andersen (general) (born 1948), South African businessman and military officer\n\nRoy Anderson (American football) (born 1980), American football coach\n\nRoy M.
