        "text": "Roy Acuff Biography\n\n“What a beautiful thought I am thinkin’; Concernin’ the Great Speckled Bird.”\n\nOn November 9, 1962 Roy Claxton Acuff was the first living member to be inducted into the Country Music Hall-Of-Fame. The citation on his plaque begins: “The Smoky Mountain Boy”…Fiddled and sang his way into the hearts of millions the world over.”\n\nRoy Acuff was The Smoky Mountain Boy who recorded 341 songs during his long career. His first session as Roy Acuff and His Crazy Tennesseans featured Roy Acuff on fiddle, Sam “Dynamite” Hatcher on harmonica, Clell Summey on steel guitar, Jess Easterday on guitar and Red Jones on stand-up bass. In Chicago on October 20, 1936 for ARC they cut “Singing My Way To Glory,” “Charmin Betsy,” “My Mountain Home Sweet Home,” the jug band song “Gonna Raise A Ruckus Tonight” and the song that one day would make Acuff famous, “Great Speckle(d) Bird.”\n\nKnown as The King of Country Music Roy Acuff was an artist whose devotion to his work boosted not only his own career, but also the credibility and popularity of his field. This country music legend helped bring the fledgling industry and its capital, Nashville with The Grand Ole Opry, from the classification of regional entertainment to a certified national institution.\n\nThe Early Years\n\nBorn September 15, 1903 in Maynardville, Tennessee, Roy Acuff was the third of five children. The son of a small-town Baptist preacher, Roy’s first musical instrument was the Jew’s harp and he moved on the harmonica. A mischievous boy, he learned to sing hymns and his father was a good country fiddler: “When Papa would get out of bed and the house was warming up on a winter morning he would take the old fiddle out from under the bed and play it up there in the hollow.”\n\nIn 1919 the family moved to Fountain City, a Knoxville suburb. In high school the five-foot eight inch and 140-pound Roy, played football, basketball and starred in baseball, his favorite sport. Although he was small, he was fast and tough, at sports and using his fists. After high school Roy worked for the railroad and played basketball and baseball.\n\nDuring a fishing trip in Florida Roy suffered severe sunstroke and after he returned passed out during a baseball game and had to be hospitalized. After he was released he passed out again and spent most of 1930 in bed recovering. “It was hard to express how dark my life was,” said Acuff. “Not being able to play baseball and be in sports.” Many biographical accounts of Roy’s life make it seem like this prevented him from a major league baseball career, nothing could be further from the truth; Roy was a good athlete but probably not major league caliber. What did happen was Roy began to play the fiddle seriously and listened to records of Fiddlin’ John Carson and Gid Tanner.\n\nTo replace sports in 1931 he began to throwing and catching a yo-yo. When his neighbor Dr. Hauer, heard the young Acuff fiddlin’ on his porch, Hauer invited him to join his medicine show in the summer of 1932. There he played fiddle with guitarist Jake Tindell and banjoist/guitarist Tom Ashley, who taught his Rising Sun Blues. Besides learning songs he did blackface comedy, skits and told jokes and learned to work a crowd. “I didn’t make much money at it,” recalled Acuff, \"but I got a pretty good background in show business.” It was also where Roy learned to belt it out. “You sang to several thousand people in the open,” he said, “and you couldn’t get to them unless you put your lungs to the fullest test.”\n\nTennessee Crackerjacks\n\nBy 1933, Acuff formed a group, the Tennessee Crackerjacks with Clell Summey (dobro), Jess Easterday (guitar) and Red Jones (bass) that played in 1934 on WROL, a Knoxville radio station. For eight months they also did the ‘Mid-Day Merry Go-Round” show on WNOX where Bill Carlisle and Pee Wee King got their starts.\n\nCrazy Tennesseans; Great Speckled Bird 1935\n\nIn 1935 the band got a new name when WROL announcer Allen Stout said, “Listeners, these are just crazy Tennesseans.” During this time Roy met Charlie Swain during his radio performances and learned “The Great Speckled Bird” from him. Charlie got the song from Rev. Guy Smith, who sang six verses to the tune of “I’m Thinking Tonight Of My Blue Eyes,” a melody that had been sung in the mountains for years. The lyrics are based on the ninth verse, twelth chapter of Jeremiah: \"Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.\" Roy stated that the Great Speckled Bird to him represented the bible and the church.\n\nIt was recorded (the original record labels, however, spelled it 'Speckle' and to many people it will always bear that title) at Roy's first session in 1936. The popular Bird was later recorded by many country and bluegrass artists including Johnny Cash (in 1959), Bert Southwood [in 1990], and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nBiblical Analysis- Summary of the book of Jeremiah:\n\nAccording to one biblical scholar: \"Jeremiah warns the people of Judah about their coming captivity, which is God's judgement for their persistant sins and failure to live as God's people should. The people have chosen to ignore God; now God will ignore them, but only for a time. God also promises to restore His people when they turn back to Him. Jeremiah tells the people that judgement should not be looked at merely as punishment, but rather as a loving act by God to restore His people to Himself. God's people had become vultures, birds of prey, and therefore unworthy of a place in God's house. Birds of prey were not allowed to be offered in sacrifice to God in the Temple.\n\nThey are continually pulling and pecking at one another, speckled with shed blood. They have made their country a cock-pit. The Hebrew root word behind the word \"speckled\" is the same as the one behind the word \"to color\", so as well as denoting a speckling with blood, it also denotes a blending together of the Law of Moses with the paganism of the surrounding nations, a mixing of the superstitious with the divine. The birds round about (the surrounding nations) are against her. Those that have made a prey of others shall themselves be preyed on. In other words, to be like a \"great speckled bird\" is not good!\n\nHowever, underneath all of this wrath of God is His love for His people and the ultimate promise of His mercy. When the song implies that the great speckled bird is somehow \"better\" than the rest, the lyrics are theologically innaccurate. The same is true when lyrics also mention the bird's \"meekness.\" The great speckled bird in the Bible is certainly not something to be admired or aspired to.\"\n\nThis song was adopted by a denomination known as the \"Church of God\", who felt themselves attacked by other denominations, and therefore identified with the bird in the song being attacked by others. There is a reference of Roy Acuff having been a member of the Church of God.\n\nMarries- Cuts First Record- First Sessions in 1936\n\nWilliam R. Calloway ARC A &R man heard Acuff singing great speckled bird on the noon radio show WROL and signed him to a record contract. They cut twenty songs including the Great Speckled in four sessions on consecutive days from Tuesday, Oct. 20 until Friday. Two songs with bawdy lyrics were cut the last day to fill out the twenty: \"Doin It The Old Fashioned Way\" and “When Lulu’s Gone.” Roy wouldn’t issue the bawdy songs under his name so they were issued as by the Bang Boys.\n\nAcuff married Mildred Douglas in 1936, that same year recording two sessions for ARC (a company controlling a host of labels, later merged with Columbia). Tracks from these sessions included two of his greatest hits: \"Wabash Cannonball\" (featuring vocals by Dynamite Hatcher) and \"The Great Speckled Bird.\"\n\nIn March 1937 ARC and Calloway got Acuff back in the studio. They did another session but Roy was dissatisfied with Calloway and he felt the rights to his songs had slipped through his hands especially “a song he wrote titled “A Three Room Shack” about his homeplace. Later in October 1938 he was convinced by Art Satherley to renew his contract with ARC (which was also now Columbia Records). In November they cut another session with sixteen songs.\n\nGrande Ole Opry\n\nRoy began making trips to Nashville as early as 1934. He would talk to Judge Hay about letting his band play on the Grand Ole Opry. Roy also wrote several stars on the show including Robert Lunn to see if they could help. Eventually David Stone, head of the WSM touring service, arranged a trial performance for the band in October 1937. Arthur Smith, the opry’s main fiddler had missed a show (he was having reoccuring problems with alcohol abuse) and they need Acuff and his band to fill in the first fifteen minutes.\n\n“I did a poor job of fiddlin’,” recalled Roy. \"I was scared to death. I played back of the bridge as much as front of the bridge.” He sang “Great Speckled Bird and played some fiddle tunes including “Old Hen Cackle and Turkey Buzzard.” Roy said, \"My voice sounded to me like a whinin' pups!\" They failed to impress the Opry staff and returned to Knoxville.\n\nIn February 1938 a spot had opened for a band to join the Delmore Brothers on the Opry tours and fill in for Arthur Smith’s Dixieliners. According to Alton Delmore there were four bands that tried out for the position.\n\nBy 1938 the Delmores were growing tired of behind-the-scene politics that went with their WSM Grand Old Opry shows. Before they left they managed to help out a young performer trying to break into the big time music business- Roy Acuff, the eventual Father of Country Music. Acuff had already made records with his band the Crazy Tennesseans and arranged to meet the Delmores and visit them back stage.\n\nRoy’s band was one of four bands that auditioned to temporarily fill a spot on the Opry and do road shows with the Delmores. Alton remembered, “Their performance was too far away from good entertainment” and “they sounded really pitiful.” When Alton went down to talk with the bands he realized the leader of the Crazy Tennesseeans was his friend Roy Acuff! Since Alton got to select the band they would do the road shows with he picked Acuff’s band, knowing, \"that old boy will crawl to make good.\"\n\nAcuff and his band changed their name to appease the Opry brass, and Roy Acuff and his Kentucky Mountain Boys appeared with the Delmores on the Opry. The first night he sang, “Great Speckled Bird” and after receiving “a ton of mail” became a regular on the show. And the rest is history…\n\nOn Feb. 10, 1938 Stone offered the band now called Roy Acuff and his Smoky Mountain Boys a spot on the Opry and lined-up road shows with the Delmores.\n\nHouse of the Rising Sun\n\nIt was during versatile entertainer Clarence \"Tom\" Ashley medicine show days one summer in 1932 that he first played with Roy Acuff. Ashley related the experience to a reporter for the Tennessee paper in the following way: \"Just before one summer, the Doc told me he had a neighbor boy who could sing a little and play a little and said he'd like to take him along. He asked if I'd train him, and I said I would. That boy stayed with us two summers and I taught him some songs, and after that he went off on his own and did right well. He was Roy Acuff.\"\n\nThe oldest known existing recording of \"House of the Rising Sun\" is by Ashley and Gwen Foster and was released in 1934 . Ashley said he had learned it from his grandfather, Enoch Ashley. Texas Alexander's \"The Risin' Sun\", which was recorded in 1928, is sometimes mentioned as the first recording, but this is a completely different song. Roy Acuff, who recorded the song commercially on November 3, 1938, surely learned this number from Ashley during those two summers. By recording the Rising Sun and singing it on The Opry, Acuff helped perpetuate an old song that probably would have been forgotten.\n\nNew “Smokey Mountain Boys” Wabash Cannonball 1939\n\nThe band had frequent clashes with Roy over what songs they would perform. Red Jones the bass player wanted to do popular songs and jazz oriented songs. By the end of the 1938 the band quit and returned to Knoxville. Roy put together a band from players he had played with in Knoxville that featured Pete “Os” Kirby (dobro), Lonnie Wilson (guitar), Jess Easterday, an original member (bass and mandolin) with Jake Tindell (blackface comedian).\n\nHe added a singer and banjo picker Rachel Veach to the line-up in April. Rachel was born on a farm near Peytonville, TN. She met Sam McGee who introduced her to Roy. Billed as “Rachel, Queen of the Hills,” she became part of the act with her bandmates Lonnie and Pete billed as, “Pap and Oswald, Rachel’s Two Comedian Boy Friends.” Their first gig was in Robbins, NC where they dressed as hillbillies. Another Smoky Mountain Boy was Pete “Os” Kirby nicknamed “Bashful Brother Oswald,” who born dec. 26, 1911. Os became an excellent banjo and guitar player, learning from his father at an early age.\n\nOs (Pete) had a famous laugh that convulsed many an audience. Rachel sang \"I Want My Mommy,” on one Acuff recording session. She quit the band in 1946 when her husband returned from the service about the time harmonica wizard Jimmy Riddle became another Smoky Mountain boy again. Riddle was born Sept. 3, 1918 in Dyersburg TN. He was give a harmonica when just a baby. “I was just born with it,” said Riddle, who also learned to play piano and accordian. He formed his first band in 1934 called Uncle Rube Turnipseed. Jimmy played harmonica for a Swift Jewel Cowboy recording session in 1939 for ARC and Art Satherley. Riddle joined Acuff in 1944 but was drafted and returned in 1946.\n\nLonnie Wilson was a member until 1958 and appeared in all of Roy’s movies. He did a brief stint in the service as a marine during the war 1943 to 1945. Joe Zinkan joined the band when Lonnie went in the service and remained until 1958. When Lonnie rejoined in 1945 Joe switched to bass. Oral “Odie” Rhodes played bass and was the rube comedian Odie. He also played guitar.\n\nLate in 1943 Roy hired Bill Monroe’s fiddler Tommy Magness. In 1948 Magness recorded eight fiddle tunes on Roy’s Columbia Album Old Time Darn Dance. In 1949 the La Croy Sisters joined the band. In 1951 fiddler Howdy Forrester joined the band. “I studied down in Hickman County where a large percentage of people play the fiddle but not many of them actually learn it.”\n\nThe other song Roy became known for on the Opry was “The Wabash Cannonball.” The song, written by William Kindt in 1904, was a rewrite of “Great Rock Island Route” by J.A. Roff in 1882. Although Roy recorded the song in 1936 he didn’t sing it on the record. He probably learned the song from The Carter Family’s popular record. By the 1920s “The Wabash Cannonball” had entered tradition and most versions, including the Carter’s, have problems rhyming [they start off rhyming “shore” with “shore”] the lyrics in the first verse.\n\nCuriously there's a verse refering to Daddy Claxton and ironically Claxton is Roy's middle name. It's as if Roy was destined to sing his popular rendition of the song. Roy didn't record his most requested song with him singing until 1947... and it was a hit again! Another unusual fact about Roy was his ability with a yo-yo, he later taught the President of the United Sates a few tricks.\n\nGrande Old Opry Movie; Roy’s First Songbook 1940\n\nRoy went to Hollywood and starred with Uncle Dave Macon in the 1940 movie Grande Ole Opry. Roy and his wife Mildred compiled a book of songs and published Roy Acuff’s Folio of Original Songs Featured Over The Grande Ole Opry. The books cost a nickel to print and sold for a quarter. After announcing the book on the air the first week in 1941 Roy got orders for 5,000 books.\n\nWar Days; The Rose-Acuff Publishing Firm\n\nAcuff was at the height of his popularity during the War years (1942-1945). Thousands of southern boys entered the service, exposing Northern GIs to Bob Wills and Ernest Tubb. “I went into the merchant marine in 1943 and took my guitar with me,” said the fifties country star Ferlin Husky during a 1958 congressional hearing on the music industry. “There were lots of boys . . . who had never really heard country music before, and it was interesting to see how fast they acquired a taste for it.” In September 1945 a debate raged among GIs in Munich: Who was better, Frank Sinatra or the Grand Ole Opry’s Roy Acuff? A four-thousand-vote radio poll put Acuff ahead by six hundred.\n\nThe patriotic mood was probably responsible for Roy Acuff’s status as “King of Country Music” (the title was bestowed on Roy by baseball’s Dizzy Dean, a big hillbilly fan). A Tennessean raised on folk music and hymns, Acuff performed in a completely unironic, almost solemn style. Unlike almost every other country-music star of the thirties and forties, he eschewed cowboy clothes and never recorded a single cowboy song, cloaking himself instead in Appalachian hearth-and-home values. In 1942 his income topped two hundred thousand dollars. The story is often told that when the Japanese attacked American positions on Okinawa, they cursed the three things they thought Americans held dearest: “To hell with Roosevelt, to hell with Babe Ruth, to hell with Roy Acuff!”\n\nAt a sold-out concert in Dallas, Roy introduced two guests to the audience Dizzy Dean and Gene Autry. At the concert said, \"Friends it’s always an honor to appear on the stage with the “King of the Hillbillies.” The name stuck (although it had been used before by Riley Puckett ion the 1920s) and when the term Country Music replaced hillbilly music the name was updated to: King of Country Music.\n\nIn 1942 after the success of Roy’s first songbook, he approached Fred Rose, who he knew from the Grand Ole Opry, about starting a publishing company. Rose, a songwriter for twenty years, had just started writing Country songs for Gene Autry in Hollywood and scored hits with “Tears on My pillow,” “Be Honest With Me” and “Tweed-O-Twill.”\n\n‘When I finally approached Fred he thought I was just kidding,” said Acuff. Several weeks later Fred Rose agreed to start the company and Acuff acting as the financier withdrew $25,000 and began the company. The money was to be used for expenses but Roy later said, “The truth is Fred Rose never touched that initial money that I put in; he didn’t have to. He was writing songs at that time and I had songs; and he took them all and got started.” One of the songs was “Fireball Mail,” a song written by Rose (under the name Floyd Jenkins, he also wrote under the name Bart Dawson). Acuff added two words at the end of the chorus (bye, bye) “Let her bye, bye, bye, the Fireball Mail” when he recorded it, and it was changed. In 1943 the firm opened at first run from Fred’s home then moved to 220 Capitol Boulevard.\n\nFred would go to Roy’s sessions and if another songs was needed he would write one on the spot; within 30 minutes the song would be done. “He was just that fast,” said Roy. In 1946 Wesley Forster joined the firm and they hired Mel Foree as the first field promotion manager. One of Rose’s abilities was finding and developing songwriters. It was then that they bought six of Hank Williams songs and signed him to an exclusive contract. Roy never mentioned to Fred that he knew Williams and Acuff wasn’t there when Hank signed.\n\nWilliams was a long time fan of Roy Acuff and Hank made it a point to attend Roy’s shows when they played near Mobile. Hank would come back to Roy’s dressing room and say, “Here’s one of your songs, Roy and I’ll even play it on the fiddle to be sure it sounds like you.” Roy commented on Hank’s singing: “He loved my type of songs. And he, truthfully, would copy me to a great extent. I guess in a way he idolized me as a country artist.”\n\nBy 1948 they moved again and filled a complex on Franklin Road and scored one of their biggest songs, “Tennessee Waltz.” By then Williams songs were huge hits and Rose-Acuff was on its way. Roy never recorded Hank’s songs until 1966 when he cut the LP: For the First Time- Roy Acuff Sings Hank Williams.\n\nIt was Rose that began writing with Williams and set up recording sessions as well as promoting his records and songs. Rose set up the first sessions in Nashville for newly formed MGM records and became an A&R man along with Frank Walker.\n\nRoy Acuff, co-organized in Nashville the first publishing house for country music. By 1943 the Grand Ole Opry was syndicated by CBS and broadcast across the nation. Roy was featured every Saturday night on “The Prince Albert show.” He later formed a music publishing venture with Chicago songwriter Fred Rose. Hank Williams, the Everly Brothers and Roy Orbison were among those who initially signed with Acuff-Rose Music.\n\nThe problem was Roy was making big money on his tours but could play Saturday night because he had to come back to Nashville. He made little money for appearing on the Opry but the publicity was making his carreer.\n\nMakes Films- Leaves Opry 1946\n\nAfter the Grand Ole Opry film in 1940 Roy starred in seven more films for Republic and also Columbia Pictures. In 1942 he made Hi Neighbor for Republic peforming the songs “Stuck Up Blues,” “I Know We are Saying Goodbye” and Pass The Biscuits Mirandie.” The next year he shot O’ My Darling Clementine with Irene Ryan (who became granny in the Beverly Hillbillies TV show) singing his original song “Fireball Mail.” His fist film in February 1944 teamed Roy up with Tex Ritter in the Cowboy Canteen for Columbia. Then he shot Sing Neighbor Sing for Republic that summer. In 1945 Roy traveled to Hollywood again to make his best film, Night Train In Memphis. During his movies Roy had to record his Opry radio show by remote telephone.\n\nHis movie associates in Hollywood offered Roy contracts but he never wanted to move to Hollywood and become a full-time movie star. He did make two more films in 1948: Smokey Mountain Melody and Home in San Antoine.\n\nAfter a contract dispute Roy decided to leave the network portion of Opry in April 1946 so he could concentrate on his road shows. Red Foley was hired to replace him as host of the network show. The radio network show faded out somewhat in the mid-50s after television became popular. Roy would never again enjoy the same popularity as he did from 1940-46.\n\nBack To The Opry 1947\n\nOn April 26, 1947 Roy was asked by Harry Stone and Ernest Tubb to return to the Opry. Though Foley remained the host of the Opry’s network show Roy retuned and hosted the “Royal Crown Cola Show” at the Opry in 1947 and hosted it until 1956. He also had the “Roy Acuff Songbook Show.”\n\nRuns For Govenor 1948\n\nRoy became interested in politics in 1943, after he invited Tennessee Governor Prentice Cooper to be the guest of honor at a gala held to mark the nationwide premier of the Opry's Prince Albert show. Cooper rejected the offer, however, and lambasted Acuff and his \"disgraceful\" music for making Tennessee the \"hillbilly capital of the United States.\" A Nashville journalist reported the governor's comments to Acuff, and suggested Acuff run for governor himself. While Acuff initially didn't take the suggestion seriously, he did accept the Republican Party nomination for governor in 1948.\n\nAcuff's nomination caused great concern for E.H. Crump, the head of a Memphis Democratic Party political machine that had dominated Tennessee state politics for nearly a quarter-century. Crump was not worried so much about losing the govenor's office— in spite of Acuff's name recognition— but did worry that Acuff would draw large crowds to Republican rallies and bolster other statewide candidates. While Acuff did relatively well and helped reinvigorate Tennessee's Republicans, his opponent, Gordon Browning, still won with 67% of the vote.\n\nLater Years\n\nAfter leaving the Opry, Acuff spent several years touring the Western United States, although demand for his appearances dwindled with the lack of national exposure and the rise of musicians such as Ernest Tubb and Eddy Arnold, who were more popular with younger audiences. He continued to play on the Opry, although by the 1960s, his sales had dropped off considerably. Acuff's tremendous contribution to country music was recognized in November 1962, when he became the first living musician to be honored as a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nAfter nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of Sparta, Tennessee in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on the Opry stage and similar shows, and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald. He was guest performer on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's triple album set \"Will The Circle Be Unbroken?\" in 1972 which brought Roy's music to contemporary and country-rock music fans.\n\nOn March 16, 1974, when the Opry officially moved from the Ryman Auditorium to the Grand Ole Opry House at Opryland Roy was featured. The first show at the new venue opened with a massive projection of a late-1930s image of Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys onto a large screen above the stage. A recording from one of the band's 1939 appearances was played over the sound system, with the iconic voice of George Hay introducing the band, followed by the band's performance of \"Wabash Cannonball.\" That same night, Acuff showed President Richard Nixon (who was in attendance) how to yo-yo, and convinced the president to play several songs on the piano.\n\nIn ‘82, he was feted with a two-hour TV special celebrating his 50 years in country music and, in a tribute that was piped in from the White House, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed him \"the epitome of the American dream.\" Other awards included the Music City News Living Legend Award in 1983, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987, the Music City News Minnie Pearl Award in 1989 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1997. Roy continued to appear regularly on the Grand Ole Opry throughout the '80s, but cut down on his previously extensive touring schedule, until by the early '90s his only appearances were infrequent guest spots at Opryland.\n\nThe King of Country Music died on November 23, 1992, following a short illness. \"I like to think I was the first person to bring voice to the Opry,\" Mr. Acuff once said. \"I was one of the first fellows who reared back and hit a microphone with a strong voice.\"Recordings: Roy Acuff- fiddle;
