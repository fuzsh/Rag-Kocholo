        "text": "Longtime Gardnerites who recall tuning into radio station WGAW in the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s will no doubt recall with fondness the name Doc Snow. Unquestionably one of the most recognizable personalities in the history of local radio, it was the legendary on-air persona of Edgar J. Arsenault, who wore many hats in Gardner throughout his life. Whether he was doing his morning shift at WGAW, continuing the day with his local catering business as he dispensed coffee and donuts to the local factories, or entertaining with his country and western band, Doc Snow could be found all around his adopted hometown of Gardner. It was during this week in 1977 that the familiar radio voice was silenced forever when Arsenault was felled by a sudden heart attack and died at the age of 62 at his home on Summer Street. His morning show over WGAW was best known for showcasing the cornball on-air quips which he perfected during his days as a performer with the local Bar X Cowboys. The show was frequently peppered with homespun humor and tidbits regarding the notables of Gardner, always finding time for a good word for a neighbor or other local dignitary both great and small. “That was his big deal over the radio, he always liked to mention people’s names from the community,” recalled Danny Snow, the youngest of eight children born to Edgar and his wife Doris. Danny, who took on his father’s famous pseudonym surname Snow, lives in Florida where he also became an entertainer. He once toured as a drummer with country star Freddie Fender, was a member of the local rock band Home and also previously operated Beaver Brook Music Store in Gardner in the 1990s. Edgar “Doc Snow” Arsenault was a native of Moncton, New Brunswick, whose father Napoleon was a noted singer in Canada before he died while his son was only six years old. It was while growing up in Canada that Edgar received the unique name he used on radio. When he was about eleven years old, he attempted to do some pole vaulting with a birch tree branch which snapped, leaving him with a badly injured wrist. Rather than visiting a physician, he decided to treat the injury himself with a homemade splint earning the nickname “Doc” from his friends. Since his last name sounded too French when pronounced Ar-sen-oh, he decided to merge the last two syllables and became Doc Snow. Once he moved to Gardner in his youth, he and a number of friends decided to showcase their musical talents by purchasing ten-cent harmonicas from Goodnow-Pearson and forming a harmonica band, marching in the Memorial Day parade. He later became well-known as an area country and western musician, with his band Doc Snow and His Bar X Cowboys entertaining throughout the area on weekends. With fellow bandsmen Sparky Lane, Tex Tyler, Johnny Ross, Joe Dorsey and Sid D'Ambrose, among others, the Bar X Cowboys were always in great demand. They made numerous appearances at the Lone Star Ranch in Reeds Ferry, N.H. with the legendary Gene Laverne, while also doing shows at the Wagon Wheel Ranch in Ashburnham. Doc frequently emceed shows along with Peppy Howard, welcoming such nationally known country acts such as Roy Acuff, Kitty Wells, Ernest Tubbs, Kenny Roberts, Doc Williams and Yodeling Slim Clark. However, it was as a radio personality that Doc Snow became best known to so many devoted listeners who would catch his morning show each day. “My dad was a big fan of Arthur Godfrey, and I think he emulated him a lot on the radio,” Danny Snow noted. “I have some old radio tapes of my dad and in the early years you can detect a French accent, but later on he sounded a lot like Arthur Godfrey.” On his daily radio show, Doc would occasionally trade barbs with the late Cliff Hill, proprietor of the Union Square Lunch, who was a suitable on air foil. Occasionally, Hill would make unscheduled appearances before the microphone at the station to exchange quips, corny jokes and conversation with Doc during a brief segment known as “Pepper and Salt.” “Cliff owned the Union Square and he also spent a lot of time at the old (Andrews Park) race track in Gardner,” Danny noted. “My dad used to make jokes about him all the time.” In addition, Doc would also have fun with other local shopkeepers and business owners such as Robbie’s Meat Market on Chestnut Street, or Eddie Mizerick’s Used Car lot in Baldwinville. Perhaps Doc's greatest pet peeve during his early morning show was when he would receive phone calls from persistent youngsters wanting to know if the dusting of snow on the roads would cancel school. It irked him all the more, since he'd just given out all the cancellations seconds earlier on the air. Occasionally, he would foul them all up when he would aver, “There’s no school today at the Fernald School,” making reference to the former name of the Templeton Developmental Center. “My dad used to have a lot of fun doing weather reports, where he would sometimes open the window and stick the microphone out there, with the wind and snow whipping in the background,” Danny recalled. He would also mix his cornball style into the weather with his famous forecast: “High winds, followed by high skirts, followed by me.” His was the type of show where even the 6:45 a.m. whistle at Heywood Wakefield got some billing. He would play the sound bite “Blow that whistle....” followed by a blast from the smokestack whistle over the air, again capturing the famed last call to work. The last few seconds of the show always included his trademark closing, “Put the coffee pot on mother, your oldest son is coming home.” In reality, the final words were actually a cue for his wife Doris, according to Danny. “My mother was usually at home making the donuts in the kitchen for his catering business, listening to dad on the radio,” Danny said, “so those words usually meant for my mom to get the coffee ready.” In 1969, Doc Snow apparently had a dispute with WGAW owner Judge C. Edward Rowe, who wanted him to change his daily format to play more present-day music and cut out some of his comic repartee. He left WGAW for Fitchburg’s AM stations WEIM and WFGL, and later was heard over Worcester’s WORC. He still remained working at his daily catering job, making the morning canteen rounds to Heywood-Wakefield, Simplex, Harrington and Richardson, Bents and other local factories. On the morning of April 28, 1977, after returning from his catering job, he told his wife that he had experienced a bout with heartburn and went to lie down. “My mom went into the kitchen to get him an Alka Seltzer and when she brought it over to him, he was gone,” his son Danny recalled. “The doctors said his heart just gave out.” Doc Snow left four sons and four daughters and a legion of fans who still share great memories of the morning radio personality who brought so much entertainment to his daily broadcasts. His son Danny has been gathering information on his dad’s career to have him considered for induction into the Country and Western Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. “I have traveled the country, doing a lot in the field of music, and you can’t believe how many people I’ve run into who remember Doc Snow,” Danny noted. Certainly if the folks at the Country Music Hall of Fame would be looking for endorsements on his behalf, there are thousands from the Gardner area who would highly recommend Doc Snow for mention among country radio’s all-time greats.
