        "text": "(1903–92). American singer, fiddler, and songwriter Roy Acuff reigned for decades as the “King of Country Music” at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee. His booming country tenor voice regaled listeners with such all-time favorite songs as “The Great Speckled Bird” (1936), his first and one of his biggest hits, and “Wabash Cannonball” (1936), featuring his train-whistle imitation.\n\nAcuff was born in Maynardville, Tennessee, on September 15, 1903. A gifted athlete, he played semiprofessional baseball before a series of sunstrokes ended that career and prompted him to practice and master the fiddle during his nearly two-year recuperation. He performed in a medicine show before forming his own string band, the Tennessee Crackerjacks, who were renamed the Crazy Tennesseans and finally the Smoky Mountain Boys. Acuff’s emotive, white-gospel singing style helped brand him a “hillbilly music” traditionalist. His recordings of “The Great Speckled Bird” and “Wabash Cannonball” earned him widespread popularity, and the latter piece became his theme song. Acuff performed at the Grand Ole Opry from 1938.\n\nIn 1942 Acuff organized Acuff-Rose Publishing Company, the first publishing house exclusively for country music, with songwriter Fred Rose. Following an unsuccessful bid for the Tennessee governorship in 1948, Acuff continued to record extensively from the 1950s on, lending authenticity to the new boom in country music with such albums as Will the Circle Be Unbroken (1972), performed with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In 1962 Acuff, who had sold more than 25 million records, was elected as the first living member of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He was also the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement award in 1987 from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and of a National Medal of Art in 1991. He died in Nashville on November 23, 1992."
