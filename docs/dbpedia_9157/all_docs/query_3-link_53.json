        "text": "During the entertaining tours, guests can visit the historic dressing rooms and stand on the center stage.\n\nFormerly the Grand Ole Opry House and the Union Gospel Tabernacle, Ryman Auditorium has been an iconic landmark in Nashville since it first opened its doors in 1892. A more than 2,300-seat entertainment complex, Ryman is known for its unsurpassable acoustics and is considered by many to be the city’s most popular venue, including hosting world-renowned performers and serving as a location for television and film productions. Today, in addition to the many concerts and events, guests can enjoy a variety of experiences at the Ryman, including tours, shopping and dining. While in Nashville, visiting the Ryman is a definite for those who wish to discover all they can about the roots of country music and the impact that this historic structure has had on the city.\n\nA little bit of history\n\nThe brainchild of a prominent Nashville businessman, Thomas G. Ryman, the Ryman Auditorium was originally constructed in 1892 as the Union Gospel Tabernacle to provide a place for evangelist Reverend Sam Jones. It was Ryman’s dream to build a venue for Jones to project his voice and message to everyone and this Victorian Gothic Revival structure went on to do just that. In 1904, after Thomas Ryman passed away, it became known as the Ryman Auditorium.\n\nIn the beginning, the Ryman was the largest structure of its kind in the area, so it became the place to host community gatherings and political rallies and numerous entertainment events including operas, symphonies, ballets and theatrical productions. It wasn’t too long before the Ryman was hosting some of the world’s top performers and most important figures including Ignacy Paderewski, Marian Anderson, John Phillip Sousa, Roy Rogers, Harry Houdini, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields, Katharine Hepburn, Bob Hope and Mae West. The Ryman soon earned the nickname “Carnegie Hall of the South”.\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry Years\n\nAt the same time, the radio show, The Grand Ole Opry began to gain international fame and in 1943, when the show drew crowds too big for any other Nashville venue, the Ryman became its new home. For the following 31 years, the Ryman was the premier stage for the Grand Ole Opry’s live radio shows, featuring the likes of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Minnie Pearl, Patsy Cline, Roy Acuff and Hank Williams, to name just a few.\n\nThe Ryman is also credited with being the birthplace of Bluegrass. It was on the Ryman stage that Earl Scruggs and Bill Monroe took the stage together for the first time in December of 1945, belting out the first definitive sounds that would become known as Bluegrass.\n\nAfter the Grand Ole Opry moved to its new location in 1974, the Ryman was still one of the city’s hottest attractions. And in 1994, the auditorium received a much-needed $8.5 million restoration that returned the National Historic Landmark back to its original magnificence. The renovation included removing all the original oak pews, restoring them and then reinstalling them. Also a part of the project was installing performer dressing rooms for legendary acts that had graced the Ryman stage, upgrading sound and lighting technology, central heat and air conditioning and a 14,000 square foot building for ticketing, concessions and a gift shop.\n\nToday, the Ryman remains a top venue for performers and attracts visitors from all over the world. New and renowned artists including Aretha Franklin, the Zac Brown Band, Annie Lennox and others continue to wow crowds at this legendary Nashville icon.\n\nWhat you’ll see and do\n\nAs a visitor to the Ryman, you’ll have the opportunity to see the stage that has been graced by so many famous musicians and performers.
