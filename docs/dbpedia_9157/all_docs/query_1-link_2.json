        "text": "Roy Acuff (born September 15, 1903, Maynardsville, Tennessee, U.S.—died November 23, 1992, Nashville, Tennessee) was an American vocalist, songwriter, and fiddle player, called the “King of Country Music,” who in the mid-1930s reasserted the mournful musical traditions of Southeastern rural whites and became a national radio star on the “Grand Ole Opry” broadcasts.\n\nTurning his attention to music after an aborted baseball career, Acuff gained immediate popularity with his recordings of “The Great Speckled Bird” and “The Wabash Cannonball.” The latter piece became his theme song. By the early 1940s his sincere singing style, backed by the traditional sound of the Smoky Mountain Boys, was earning him $200,000 per year.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
