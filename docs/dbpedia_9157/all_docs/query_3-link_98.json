        "text": "Ryman Auditorium is one of the most well-known performance venues in music–and for good reason. It’s the Mother Church of Country Music, the birthplace of bluegrass, and the original home of the Grand Ole Opry where the careers of countless musical legends were launched. Constructed with stunning, unique acoustics and steeped in history, the Ryman offers something for everyone. After reading this post, you’ll understand why the Ryman is so special and deserves its unmatched reputation.\n\nReasons to Consider Visiting the Ryman\n\nThere are countless reasons to visit the Ryman no matter who you are. If you’re a music fan, you’ll appreciate touring a building so important to music history. If you’re a history fan, you’ll love learning about the role Ryman Auditorium has played in the development of Nashville. If you just appreciate seeing cool things, the Ryman’s got plenty of those, too. Whatever interests you, you need to tour Ryman Auditorium in person on your next visit to Music City.\n\nA Key Player in Nashville History\n\nRyman Auditorium exists thanks to the inspiration of Thomas G. Ryman, a sea captain who lived in Nashville in the 1800s. After he attended a tent revival led by charismatic evangelist Sam Jones, Ryman felt called to dedicate his fortune to building a church in the city. It was named the Union Gospel Tabernacle, and it opened its doors in 1892. The church hosted services by Jones and other preachers, as well as lectures and community events. When Ryman died in 1904, the church was renamed Ryman Auditorium in his honor.\n\nThe Mother Church of Country Music\n\nSince the beginning, music was a part of the Ryman’s very foundation. In fact, once opened, the church hosted a concert even before Rev. Sam Jones’ first sermon! At the time, Ryman Auditorium was the largest structure of its kind in the city, so it quickly became the host of many gatherings featuring some of the world’s top performers, like Harry Houdini, Bob Hope, and Mae West. In April 1895, money was raised from the congregation at the Easter service to pay for the wooden church pews in the tabernacle–pews where concert-goers still sit at the Ryman today.\n\nThe Original Home of The Grand Ole Opry\n\nIn 1943, a live radio show called the Grand Ole Opry took up residence in Ryman Auditorium. It had outgrown its previous four venues, including War Memorial Auditorium, and the Ryman had the right vibe and just enough space to accommodate the show’s sold-out crowds. It was at the Ryman that the Grand Ole Opry gained notoriety across the U.S. with a star-studded list of performers including Johnny Cash, Minnie Pearl, Hank Williams, and Patsy Cline. The Ryman was the home of the Grand Ole Opry for more than 30 years.\n\nThe Birthplace of Bluegrass\n\nIn 1945, a performance by Earl Scruggs with Bill Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys introduced a whole new musical genre to a large audience for the first time. With Monroe on mandolin, Scruggs on banjo, Howard Watts playing bass, Lester Flatt on guitar, and Chubby Wise playing fiddle, the band defined what would become the traditional Bluegrass sound, and audiences couldn’t get enough. Bluegrass music was born\n\nA Springboard for Launching Careers of Musical Legends\n\nCountless careers were launched on the Ryman Auditorium stage. It’s where the Carter Family, including Mother Maybelle of the Carter Sisters and her daughters Helen, Anita, and June, had some of their early performances. Johnny Cash joined the Opry in 1956 and Patsy Cline in 1960. It’s hard to overstate the important influence the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium had on the careers of these music legends.\n\nHome to So Many Famous Moments in Musical History\n\nHaving hosted musical performances for more than 130 years, Ryman Auditorium is the site of many significant moments in music history. In 1945, it was the birthplace of bluegrass music. Perhaps most notably, it’s where June Carter, of the Carter Family, would meet Johnny Cash. In 1968, after the pair met backstage at the Ryman, Cash proclaimed to Carter, “I’m going to marry you someday.” He did, 12 years later.\n\nPurpose-Built for Transformative Experiences\n\nIn 1974, the Grand Ole Opry moved out of Ryman Auditorium and into its permanent home across town in the Opry House. For years after its departure, the Ryman sat empty and unused, eventually falling into disrepair. In fact, the building was slated for demolition and would have been erased from the city skyline if not for the efforts of Nashvillians who fought for the building to be saved. They were successful, and restoration efforts began in the early 1990s to return Ryman Auditorium to its former glory. Today, the venue is regarded as one of the best music venues in the U.S. It’s hard to imagine Music City without the Ryman.\n\nStunning, Unique Acoustics\n\nThere are many unique things about Ryman Auditorium, but one of the things that makes it most special are its acoustics. The Ryman was originally built as a church and the venue still bears some reminiscent architectural qualities today, like its church-pew seating, its infamous stained-glass windows, and its impressive acoustics. In fact, it’s these acoustics that contribute to the Ryman being a favorite music venue for performers and audiences alike. The result is a sound that’s unmatched by any other venue in the world. It’s part of what makes Ryman Auditorium such a significant spot in Music City.\n\nImmersive, Inspiring Tours\n\nWhen you tour Ryman Auditorium, it’s not just a chance to have access to the historical site. You get an experience that takes you back in time through the venue’s 130-year history. Each tour starts in the Soul of Nashville theater where you’ll be treated to a star-studded video complete with immersive, choreographed light and sound design.
