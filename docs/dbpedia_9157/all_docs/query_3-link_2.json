        "text": "In This Article\n\nOrigin, Meaning, And History Of Roy\n\nRoy is an Anglicized variant of the Scottish Gaelic and Irish nickname Ruadh, which means ‘red.’ Roy may also be a derivation of the Norman word “Roy,” which means ‘king.’ The Indian variant of the name is the surname Rai which also translates to ‘king.’ It is often used as a shortened variant of the surname and first name Roice.\n\nThus Roy is both a personal name and a last name.\n\nBeginning in the Medieval Ages, the name Roy has a long history. It was a Breton appellation for someone who frequently assumed the regal guise or played the king during local celebrations. From ancient times, this distinguished family has had a seat in Brittany, where the surname Roy originally appeared. This clan included Simonnet des Roys, Lord of Roys, co-Lord of Brignon, magistrate, and military captain. Etienne and Gilbert Roys participated actively in the Crusades, earning them the title of Knights of Malta for their bravery. Etienne Roy, the son of Mathurin and Marguerite of La Rochelle, is one of the first people with the name Roy to be mentioned in Canadian history.\n\nRoy can be used either as a standalone name or a shortened version of names such as Leroy and Elroy. It is a majorly masculine name, but sometimes parents may use it for their baby girl.\n\nRoy has appeared immensely in fiction. One prominent one is Roy Anderson. He appeared for three whole seasons of the hit sitcom The Office as the ex-fiance of Pam. Even though he had a minor role, he became popular in the fandom. Other characters are Roy Batty, the renegade replicants’ leader in Blade Runner; Roy Carson, the factory worker and union locale boss from the gripping horror movie Final Destination 5; and Roy Kent from the sports comedy series Ted Lasso.\n\nHow To Pronounce Roy?\n\n‘Roy’ In QR Code\n\nNotable People Named Roy\n\nThis section covers people who have made the name Roy famous with their contributions in various fields.

According to Western astrology, the zodiac or sun sign depends on the sun’s position in one of these sectors at the time of your birth. Starting from the sun’s position at the March equinox, the chart goes anti-clockwise from Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. These signs are ruled by planetary bodies - Mars, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Furthermore, they are categorized into triplicities or elemental signs - fire, water, air, and earth - that govern their characteristics. Each of these zodiac signs features certain personality traits that may determine how a person presents themselves.\n\nEach zodiac sign in Western astrology is linked to a specific range of dates in the year. Unlike Vedic astrology, where names can sometimes be used to infer astrological details, Western astrology relies entirely on the birth date.\n\nTo know more about your baby’s zodiac sign, choose the period in which your baby’s date of birth falls, from the options given below.
