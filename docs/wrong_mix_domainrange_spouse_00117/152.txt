Barker, who maintains a rigorous exercise regimen, shared his daily routine: "I start every morning with a 30-minute walk while listening to an audiobook or podcast. I repeat this at night, especially since I have difficulty sleeping after shows."

Kardashian also reflected on how their shared love for fitness played a role in their relationship. "We used to work out and run together long before we were a couple. We were fitness buddies," she told.

Barker's commitment to health and wellness took on new significance after a harrowing plane crash in 2008 that left him with burns over 70% of his body. Reflecting on that time, Barker once wrote on Instagram, "Doctors said I might never walk or play drums the same way again. I wasn't athletic and never played sports, but I felt a need to prove everyone wrong, including myself."

He began with short walks, which gradually turned into daily runs. "Running gave me a sense of peace and a rush of dopamine. It's something I continue to this day. I run three miles every day before my shows while on tour," he explained.

Barker's passion for running culminated in his participation in his first half marathon and several 5K races over the past year. "I was inspired by the camaraderie and support within the running community," he shared. This inspiration led to the creation of "Run Travis Run," aimed at bringing like-minded individuals together to encourage outdoor activity and healthy lifestyle choices.

"I want to motivate people to get outside, run or walk for a few hours, and make healthy decisions," Barker concluded.

The Quran - Chapter Al-Hadid : 27

Then in the footsteps of these ˹prophets˺, We sent Our messengers, and ˹after them˺ We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and granted him the Gospel, and instilled compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. As for monasticism, they made it up—We never ordained it for them—only seeking to please Allah, yet they did not ˹even˺ observe it strictly. So We rewarded those of them who were faithful. But most of them are rebellious.
