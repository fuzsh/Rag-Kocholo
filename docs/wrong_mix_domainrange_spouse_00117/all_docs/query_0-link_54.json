        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are parents again, but this time, it is their first child together. The Lemme founder, 44, and the Blink-182 drummer, 47, have welcomed their first baby together, sources confirm to People Saturday (November 4). The couple previously revealed that they would be welcoming a little drummer boy via a gender reveal party a few months ago in June. In a new interview, the legendary drummer revealed that their son will be named Rocky Thirteen Barker.\n\nLast month, Kourtney shared a message for critics who say she shouldn’t have a baby at 44 years old. In an interview with Vanity Fair Italia, the Poosh founder brushed off the haters. She told the publication, “Those comments don’t affect me. To those who do them, I just say: how dare you question God’s plan?” That’s how the mother of three sees this pregnancy. She further explained that she and her husband, Travis Barker, stopped thinking about having a baby for a year after they stopped trying with IVF.\n\nRELATED: Kourtney Kardashian Needed Urgent Surgery to Save Unborn Baby\n\nThe Kardashians star said the decision to try assisted fertilization was “almost a non-choice, in the sense that I was pushed towards it as if it were the only option.” She felt the process made her feel like she was “doing something that wasn’t right for me. My intuition was telling me that she wasn’t right for me.” She added, “I knew deep down that it wasn’t the right thing. And in fact, I kept telling Travis: if we’re meant to have a baby, then it’s just going to happen. And so it was: when we stopped forcing the process, then it happened.” Kourtney is also a mother to Mason, 13, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 8, whom she shares with ex Scott Disick. Barker is already a father to son Landon, 20, daughter Alabama, 17, and stepdaughter Atiana De La Hoya, 24, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
