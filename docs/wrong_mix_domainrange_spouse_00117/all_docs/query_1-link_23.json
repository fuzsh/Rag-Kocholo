        "text": "Travis Barker serenaded his 'rockstar wife' Kourtney Kardashian in front of the whole world, and she’s all for it.\n\nThe smitten Kardashian star, 44, shared the lyrics from Blink-182’s latest single, Fell in Love, which were partly penned by drummer Barker, drawing focus to the very sweet and suspiciously relevant-to-their-relationship chorus of the song.\n\nTaking to her Instagram stories on Monday, the expecting mother posted a Spotify screen recording of her husband’s latest musical achievement, his ninth studio album entitled One More Time.\n\n\"Do you remember the time when we first met?/ You were at a party with your ex/ I said hello, then I got drunk/ Do you remember the time we fell in love?\" vocalists DeLonge and Hoppus sung the lyrics partly penned by Barker.\n\nNotably, Barker not only co-wrote but almost entirely produced the album, per an interview with The Zane Lane posted on October 18th.\n\nWhether or not they actually reflect real life events, the lyrics definitely struck a chord with Kourtney, who met her husband-of-one year and the father of her unborn child over a decade ago, while she was involved with now ex, Scott Disick, per a relationship timeline by US Weekly.\n\nThe Poosh founder and the musician then sparked dating rumours in 2018, three years into Kourtney and Scott’s post-divorce co-parenting relationship.\n\nFast forward to today, Kourtney is living her best \"rockstar world tour wife\" life, as she referred to herself in an old Instagram post from last year."
