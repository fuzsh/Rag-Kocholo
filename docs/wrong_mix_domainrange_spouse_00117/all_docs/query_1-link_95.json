        "text": "01. Back From The Dead (feat. Big Sean and Travis Barker)\n\n02. Final Warning\n\n03. Wear Me Out\n\n04. Religion\n\n05. C’mon Let Me Ride (feat. Eminem)\n\n06. Sunshine\n\n07. Pulse\n\n08. Glow In The Dark\n\n09. Shit, Man! (feat. Angel Haze)\n\n10. Clear Blue Sky\n\n11. Tower (Don’t Look Down)\n\n12. White Suburban\n\nIt has leaked and it's surprisingly relieving after the disappointment that was Magna Carta... Holy Grail. Travis Barker is a beast on the opening track, and I'm not bored yet. In fact, I really like the feel and sound of this relationship stuff - it's a more active attack, unlike Adele, and it feels scarier, instead of the sugarcoated BS Taylor Swift delivers.\n\nI'll listen. All of the tracks released before sounded really good. Will post my opinion.\n\n8.5/10 Wow, such a great album. Skylar just has an incredible voice. Loved the beats and everything. Couple of things I disliked: all rap features except Eminem, and the song Shit, Man!.\n\nAbsolute favorite: Weirdo (Yeah, I listened to deluxe edition) and Final Warning.\n\nReally good album. Nice mix of hip hop style and pop. Love her voice. \"Wear Me Out\" is a stand out track for me, and \"C'mon Let Me Ride\" is much better than I remember it being.\n\nAgreed - it fits much better within the rest of the album and is definitely the silliest. Hearing that first and then the album was a nice surprise and makes the album significantly better because of it.\n\nI've been listening to this record for a couple of days now. Wow. I've never paid attention to Skylar/Holly and I really didn't expect to love this so much. Incredible record with almost no weak points. Not a big fan of the track with Eminem (although it's good for what it is - parodying today's music) and the rap guests (especially on Shit, Man!, I absolutely love Back From The Dead and grew to like the rap part, too). I LOVE her voice and her style. Definitely got a new fan.\n\nHaven't listened to the entire record yet, but I just wanted to let you guys know that Tower (Don't Look Down) is free this week on iTunes.\n\nBest Song on the album is the bonus track: \"Only Thing I Hear\"\n\nTravis Barker's beat is so addicting. You can hear it on Spotify.\n\nThere's also the bonus track \"Ticking Time Bomb\" which is pretty surprising because it has a huge dubstep beat throughout this beautiful slow song.\n\nStand Outs:\n\n\"Wear Me Out\"\n\n\"Clear Blue Sky\"\n\n\"Back From The Dead\"\n\n\"White Suburban\"\n\n\"Ticking Time Bomb\"\n\nI haven't listened the the album yet, but Tower (Don't Look Down) is the single of the week on iTunes, it's great! Has me really interested in listening the the full album.\n\nIs no one else going to listen to this record? LMAO\n\nI can't even find Ticking Time Bomb"
