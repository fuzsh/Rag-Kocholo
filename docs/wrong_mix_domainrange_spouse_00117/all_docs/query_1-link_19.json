News where Ora was.\n\nWithout any sort of hesitation, Barker said Ora was probably coming later. When prompted, he said they would “possibly” be dressing up for Halloween together.\n\nRita Ora Talks New Album, ’50 Shades of Grey’ & More at iHeartRadio Music Fest 2015\n\nHe continued, on his own accord, “We actually share a lot of the same tastes in music. Little did I know that she likes punk rock a lot. I love that. I was raised on it.”\n\nThe couple first met a couple weeks ago at the Power 106 All-Star basketball game in Los Angeles, Barker’s rep confirmed with TMZ."
