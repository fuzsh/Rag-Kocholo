        "text": "STARTING life with a single mum in a trailer park in Detroit, Eminem always vowed to give his own kids a better life.\n\nAnd while Hailie Jade - his daughter with ex-wife Kim Scott - is his only biological child, the rapper ended up raising an entire brood, adopting two more family members and bringing up his own little brother Nate, 14 years his junior.\n\nAs Kim’s sister Dawn succumbed to drug addiction, he took in her daughter Alaina, now 28, and later adopted her.\n\nHe also adopted Kim’s second child Whitney, conceived after the couple split in 2001.\n\nThis week the 19-year-old, who has adopted the name Stevie Laine, has come out as non-binary.\n\nStevie revealed their true identity in a series of Instagram and TikTok posts after cutting their hair short, showing off their quirky fashion sense for followers.\n\nHere we look at the complex family life of the £100m rapper - from his turbulent relationship with Kim Scott to his adopted children.\n\nKim Scott\n\nBorn in Michigan, Kim had a troubled childhood and claimed she was abused by her alcoholic stepdad.\n\nAfter running away from home at 13, she met Eminem, then 15, and moved into his mum Debbie Nelson’s trailer.\n\nThe pair had a rocky relationship and after the birth of their daughter Hailie Jade, in 1995, they lived in crime-stricken areas and struggled to get by, with Eminem working as a dishwasher in a hotel for £4 an hour.\n\n“He didn’t want his daughter to grow up like he did, living from day to day and moving from week to week,” his boss, Mike Mazur, told Salon in 2000.\n\nThe pair wed in 1999 but both struggled with drug addiction and Eminem later admitted he was abusive to Kim.\n\nThe violent lyrics to 97 Bonnie and Clyde and Kim also saw him fantasising about killing her, and they split after she saw him beating a blow-up doll in her image, on stage, in 2000.\n\nDuring their split, Kim got pregnant with Stevie, christened Whitney, in a brief affair with Eric Harttner, but when she reconciled with Eminem, in 2005, he filed for adoption.\n\nThe couple divorced in 2006 and Kim has battled depression and addiction since, attempting to take her own life several times.\n\nThis week she was rushed to hospital after her latest suicide attempt following the death of her beloved mum, Kathy Sluck.\n\nHailie Jade Mathers\n\nFans of Eminem heard Hailie’s name repeated the lyrics of over 20 songs throughout his career, including Hailie’s Song, My Dad’s Gone Crazy, Kim, 97 Bonnie & Clyde, Beautiful and My Darling.\n\nHailie was born on Christmas Day, 1995, and initially brought up in poverty, with warring parents.\n\nBut, despite her chaotic homelife and instability, she grew up well-adjusted - graduating from Chippewa Valley High School in 2014 with highest honours.\n\nNow 25, Hailie has developed a huge following on Instagram where she posts fashion shots and fitness routines.\n\nOn March 2020 Eminem spoke publicly about Hailie telling how \"proud\" he was of her.\n\nOn Mike Tyson's Hot Boxin podcast he said: \"Hailie is 23, no babies, she has a boyfriend, but she’s doing good.\n\n\"She's made me proud for sure, she's graduated from college.\"\n\nStevie Laine\n\nBorn on April 16, 2002, Stevie - christened Whitney - was the result of a short relationship Kim had with tattoo artist Eric Harttner.\n\nEminem legally adopted them back in 2005, after he and Kim rekindled their relationship, four years after their divorce.\n\nTheir biological dad, a professional tattoo artist, had various run-ins with the law and was in and out of prison as he reportedly battled drug addiction. He died in 2020 aged 40.\n\nStevie unveiled the new name on August 12 and revealed they identify as non-binary.\n\nIn one post, they wrote out their pronouns, telling fans: \"Call me Stevie (they/she/he),\" which was liked by sister Hailie Jade.\n\nA TikTok video also shows their transformation over the years, with the words: \"Watch me become more comfortable with myself,\" and \"forever growing and changing.\"\n\nAlaina Marie Scott\n\nKim's twin sister Dawn battled heroin addiction throughout her teens and adult life, and tragically died from an overdose in 2016, aged 41.\n\nAlaina also has a twin brother, Adam, who was reportedly born with mental and physical disabilities as a result of his mother's addictions and is thought to have been raised by his father.\n\nEminem adopted Alaina and told Rolling Stone: \"My niece has been a part of my life ever since she was born.\n\n\"Me and Kim pretty much had her, she’d live with us wherever we was at.\"\n\nNow 28, Alaina is an influencer who promotes body positivity.\n\nNate Mathers\n\nEminem brother Nate is 14 years younger than him and was born on February 3, 1986 as the result of a brief affair between his mother, Debbie Nelson and Fred Samara.\n\nThe brothers were close to each other but distanced from their mother, who they have claimed was abusive and neglectful.\n\nAt one point Nathan was placed in foster care but Eminem, now a successful star, took him in when he was 16 and gained legal custody.\n\nNate, now an actor of 35, has always said he was grateful to his big brother for taking him in."
