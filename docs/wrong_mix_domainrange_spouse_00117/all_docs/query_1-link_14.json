        "text": "Travis Barker's secret romance with wife Kourtney’s sister Kim Kardashian has been unearthed amid their feud.\n\nThe sisters have been locked in a bitter fight that has been the main subject of their reality TV show The Kardashians, leading to the total breakdown of their relationship. The sisters have fought constantly over the last few years, and their relationship hit an all-time low earlier this month, when Kim told her older sister that she had started a text group, called Not Kourtney, in which her family and friends gossip about her behaviour behind her back.\n\nDevastated Kourtney - who is pregnant with her and Travis’ first child - broke down, and told Kim she “hated” her, leaving their bond almost completely destroyed. However, super sleuth fans have discovered a possible reason as to why Kim and Kourtney have a fractured relationship and have been unable to resolve their differences. Resurfaced quotes from the Blink-182 drummer’s 2015 memoir Can I Say: Living Large, Cheating Death, and Drums, Drums, Drums, the rocker recalled meeting Kim back in 2006, and confessed he couldn't take his eyes off her.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE:Kourtney Kardashian drops major clue she's already given birth as she approaches due date\n\nBack then, Travis was dating heiress Paris Hilton, and Kim - who was dating Ray J at the time - was working as her wardrobe assistant. But during a trip to Amsterdam, Travis admitted he was attracted to Kim, who he called “f***ing hot”.\n\nReflecting on a trip to Amsterdam he took with Paris, Kim, and their friends, he wrote: “We all checked into our hotel and then rented bicycles and rode all over Amsterdam - that's what you do there. It was me, Lil Chris, my drum tech Daniel, Paris, and Kim. I was having a blast and was happy to let the world know it. I kept on secretly checking out Kim, telling Lil Chris, ‘I don't care if she's the closet girl, she's f***ing hot.’”\n\nFollowing their return from Europe, Kim and Ray J split up, and Travis got in touch with her to ask her out, shortly after the former couple’s infamous sex tape was released. “We went to dinner, we went to lunch. You might think I would be doing the worst things with this girl because of her tapes, but it was the exact opposite of any other encounter I've had with a woman: With Kim, I wanted to be nothing but a gentleman to her. It was so weird,” he explained.\n\nTravis went on to share sweet details of their brief relationship, and revealed their shared a special bond. “We were around each other a lot. We’d be really sweet around each other, like little kids, and then when we were apart, she’d call me and say, ‘I want to see you again.’ ‘Me too,’ I’d say,” he wrote. Promoting his book back in 2015, Travis insisted he and Kim “never touched each other”, but admitted he had a big crush on the star. “We were flirtatious, but nothing ever happened. She was so kind and polite, I just felt like being a perfect gentleman around her. It was a trip!” he told Us Weekly.\n\nKourtney and Travis became friends in 2017, when the drummer moved into a property close to hers. Following her split from Scott Disick, the duo struck up a close friendship, and their relationship developed into romance in 2021, when they began dating. Just a few months later, Travis popped the question in a gothic-inspired proposal, and the couple wed in a star-studded ceremony in Portofino, Italy, last summer.\n\nKourtney, who is expected to give birth to her and Travis' first child at the end of October, also rehashed her fued with sister Kim over her Dolce Vita themed wedding, as she claimed the Skims founder was \"unhappy\" during her nuptials. \"You cannot stand someone else being the centre of attention. You came to my wedding, you couldn't be happy. You complained from the second you got there till the second you left,\" she fumed during a recent episode of The Kardashians."
