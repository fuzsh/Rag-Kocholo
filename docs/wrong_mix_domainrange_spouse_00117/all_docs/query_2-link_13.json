        "text": "Released: Feb. 2.\n\nSure, Lil Wayne's rock album, “Rebirth,” is a misfire, the kind of thing that happens when a star overestimates his skills (and calls his opening track “American Star”). But if Kid Rock can rap, why can't Lil Wayne try being a rocker?\n\n“Rebirth” is a detour in a hip-hop career that was phenomenally prolific up to the triple-platinum album “Tha Carter III,” the best-selling album of 2008. (There was also plenty of free Lil Wayne available on mixtapes.) Even while touring extensively, Lil Wayne tossed off a quick-tongued album-length mixtape, “No Ceilings,” in 2009. Meanwhile, after the very premature release of the rock single “Prom Queen,” “Rebirth” was repeatedly delayed.\n\n“Rebirth” often trades away Lil Wayne's bugged-out wordplay and brilliantly flaky delivery — with its pauses, chants, rushes, leaps, wheezes and slurs — for annoyingly Auto-Tuned singing (more or less), though he can't resist rapping now and then. The lyrics stay dutifully on topic, while the music has power chords, crashing drums and more riffs than melodies, along with some shaky jabs of lead guitar, probably played by Lil Wayne himself.\n\nWhat makes the album interesting, though not exactly good, is how it reveals a rapper's view of rock. For Lil Wayne rock is bombast and cliché in which high-school traumas are avenged, heaven and hell are frequently invoked and existential predicaments are taken seriously: “It feels like I'm runnin' and life is the miles,” he intones in “Runnin.” This is rock at its most humorless, as learned from the grim-faced latter-day grunge bands, self-absorbed pop-punks, wounded macho rap-rockers and earnest U2 imitators of modern-rock radio. Lil Wayne and his producers mimic an across-the-board assortment of styles, among them new wave (“Get a Life”), power ballads (“One Way Trip,” featuring Travis Barker from Blink-182 on drums) and, most vigorously, the Beastie Boys (“Ground Zero”). The songs might have been better as parodies than as imitations, although “Knockout” — a Coldplay homage backing a raunchy lyric — comes close to being both.\n\nIt's a relief when Lil Wayne turns off the Auto-Tune and raps, as he does in “Drop the World.” Synthesizers and minor chords carry the song, which dwells on the Sisyphean demands of ambition — “The top gets higher the more that I climb” — and is catapulted by a ferociously competitive guest verse from Eminem. Instead of branching out or crossing over, Lil Wayne would be better off guarding his home turf.\n\nReleased: Jan. 26.\n\nPatty Griffin's work occasionally has ventured into soul-gospel territory, as with last year's duet with Mavis Staples on the “Oh, Happy Day” gospel compilation and on a couple of songs, such as “Heavenly Day,” from her previous album, 2007's “Children Running Through.”\n\nBut “Downtown Church” is her first album of hymns, and it's enough of a departure that it's being released on EMI-distributed Christian label Credential Recordings rather than on ATO Records, where Griffin remains under contract.\n\nLet's hope that move doesn't keep these gloriously rendered songs from reaching a larger audience; “Downtown Church” is a stunningly powerful and compassionate work addressing homelessness, kindness, deceit and finding the strength to persevere through troubled tides. Produced by Buddy Miller, and partly recorded in a 19th century chapel in Nashville, Tenn., “Downtown Church” proves again that Griffin's talents transcend the singer-songwriter category through sheer force of her soulful voice and interpretive ability.\n\nThe songs mix traditional standards (“Wade In The Water,” “Move Up”) with country and blues spirituals (Hank Williams' “House Of Gold,” the blues classic “If I Had My Way”) and originals written by Griffin, Julie Miller and others. Guests include Emmylou Harris and Raul Malo, and the arrangements blend gospel-rooted R&B with acoustic mountain soul music, tied together by a message of living with ethical fortitude and empathy.\n\nCheck this track out: “Waiting For My Child,” originally recorded by gospel duo the Consolers in 1963, finds a mother crying out for her lost child, but becomes an allegory for how we're all children who go astray. With harmony vocals by Ann and Regina McCrary, Griffin conveys this message of faith with a balance of delicateness and force that touches that eternal chord in all of us.\n\nReleased: Feb. 2.\n\nThe most striking chorus on “The Courage of Others,” the third full-length album by the indie soft-rock band Midlake, arrives stealthily, in a haze of petulance. “I only want to be left to my own ways,” declares Tim Smith, the band's lead singer and songwriter, like a precocious child from behind a closed door. The song is “Rulers, Ruling All Things,” and its harmonious purr, aflutter with flute and finger-picked guitars, creates a damp and cloistered feeling. You come away with the sense Smith says this a lot, and often gets his wish.\n\nMidlake was formed just over a decade ago by jazz students at the University of North Texas. The band takes its time in all things. Smith, trained as a saxophonist, became a singer by default, picking up acoustic guitar along the way. He has gradually steered Midlake through its Crosby, Stills and Nash phase and toward something more in line with Fairport Convention. (Fleetwood Mac still applies.) Left to his own ways, he writes songs of stoic interiority: This album begins with a plea for hibernation and ends, approvingly, with a burial.\n\nSylvan and solemn, gorgeous and a little listless, “The Courage of Others” feels like the sincerest kind of put-on. For a band still based in Denton, Texas, there's an awful lot here about wintry privations, maidens and servants and lords. One song in 6/8 meter, “Core of Nature,” borrows its title from a passage in a Goethe poem. Another one, “Bring Down,” reconfirms these musicians' infatuation with the Radiohead of their late-teenage years.\n\nBut there's a strong presence to the album, with its meticulous atmosphere and granite consistency of tone. The chiming guitars of a pair of Erics (Pulido and Nichelson), and the tasteful work of the drummer McKenzie Smith bring gravity to the band's gloss on psychedelic folk. Even the dull surface of Smith's voice exerts some heavy pull. “I had the path of wonder, there before me,” he laments in “Rulers, Ruling All Things,” sounding less wide eyed by the second.\n\nReleased: Jan. 26.\n\nThe Magnetic Fields have always relished the contrast between sentiment and production — for instance, by drowning bleak emotions in a tsunami of major-key guitars, or swaddling classic, literate couplets in bright, dime-store synthesizers.\n\nAnd while leader Stephin Merritt's songwriting credentials are unquestionable (see the Fields' flawless run of 1990s releases), on “Realism,” his fussy temperament gets the better of him.\n\nThe opposite of 2008's “Distortion,” “Realism” finds Merritt going unamplified and acoustic. Unfortunately, the arrangements on many songs are cutesy to the point of suffocation (see “We Are Having a Hootenanny” and “The Dolls' Tea Party”) and the songwriting rarely justifies the treatment. Bloodless and grating, “Realism” is only a hint of what this otherwise excellent band is capable of creating.\n\nReleased: Feb. 9.\n\nMassive Attack is less a band than a cloud of free-floating anxiety. Its members, Robert Del Naja (or 3D) and Grant Marshall (Daddy G), are pioneers of the trip-hop that emerged from clubs in Bristol, England, in the late 1980s. (A third founder, Andy Vowles, aka Mushroom, left in 1999.)\n\nMassive Attack worked like a reggae sound system and production team, collaborating with singers. The Bristol sound, from Massive Attack and associates like Soul II Soul and Tricky, was cavernous, shadowy and foreboding — not party music, but a premonition of the burned-out, dread-infused morning after. “Fish like little silver knives/Make the cuts on my inside,” Del Naja sings in “Atlas Air,” on its new album.\n\nBut Massive Attack evades trip-hop basics for most of the new “Heligoland,” its first studio album since 2003. (The title recalls a German archipelago in the North Sea.) The group has largely sworn off deep bass, making for its crispest, most transparent productions but losing a lot of atmospheric murk. Its sound is also less personalized than ever. Various tracks might be mistaken for Radiohead, Nine Inch Nails or TV on the Radio (with Tunde Adebimpe from that band taking lead vocals on the opening song, “Pray for Rain”).\n\nWhat unites “Heligoland” is Massive Attack's love of repetition, its way of transforming arrangements near the end of a song and its somber attitude about love and world affairs alike. Marshall's deep voice talk-sings through the bitter “Splitting the Atom,” with observations like “The jobless return/the bankers have bailed”; unfortunately, it's set to a mechanized music-hall beat that's merely drab.\n\nGuests draw more out of Massive Attack. The reggae singer Horace Andy, a regular with the band, croons about thwarted romance in “Girl I Love You” between an insistent double-time bass line and a wasp's nest of horns. For Damon Albarn, from Blur, Massive Attack constructs a ravaged version of Britpop grandeur (via Radiohead) in “Saturday Come Slow” as he muses, “Do you love me?/Is there nothing there?”\n\n“Flat of the Blade,” featuring Guy Garvey of Elbow, has looping, ratcheting electronics, hints of a dance beat, hummed vocal overdubs and a brass ensemble; it could be a Bjork production of Robert Wyatt. Martina Topley Bird, who sang with Tricky, appears in “Babel,” a skeletal rocker, and “Psyche,” with hypnotic arpeggios bouncing between stereo channels. Hope Sandoval, from Mazzy Star, whispers about love and sin in “Paradise Circus,” as the track evolves from minimal vibraphone and piano chords through a reggae vamp to a string-laden elegy.\n\n“Heligoland” comes across as an anthology rather than an album. It's a dour collection of concepts and strategies — some successful — as Massive Attack ponders what to do after trip-hop."
