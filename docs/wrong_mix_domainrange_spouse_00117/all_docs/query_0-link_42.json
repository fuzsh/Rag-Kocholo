        "text": "Tyga and Travis Barker have reportedly teamed up to drop a joint project, and it’s looking like it could be arriving sooner rather than later.\n\nAccording to a TMZ report on Monday (June 12), Tyga has been seen going to Barker’s Calabasas studio quite frequently as of late. The pair are said to be putting together an EP that they plan to drop “in the coming months.”\n\nThe connection isn’t totally random, as they’ve teamed up for music in the past. They’ve also both been a part of the Kardashian/Jenner crew — but not at the same time.\n\nTyga is also gearing up to release a joint project with YG, which the pair revealed at Rolling Loud Los Angeles in March.\n\nPrior to the performance of the pair’s 2019 hit, “Go Loko,” Tyga made the announcement about the upcoming project.\n\n“So it’s crazy because last year, or like a year or two ago, we was working on the album, but the shit was going so crazy that we only came up with one song,” Tyga said, with YG in agreement. “But now we about to drop the new album, coming soon you feel me.”\n\nAfter the announcement, the crowd lit up with excitement once they started rapping the chorus to the infectious record.\n\nIn other Tyga news, the Los Angeles native recently shared his choices for the “Best Rappers Of All Time” — and Lil Wayne and Eminem are at the top of his list.\n\n“Lil Wayne & Eminem are the best rappers of all time! Lyrical word play, delivery, flow, pockets, originality , raw, intentional, clarity, generational influence,” he wrote in a tweet in March.\n\nSeveral days later in a series of follow-up tweets, he also acknowledged his former Young Money partner in rhyme, Nicki Minaj. Tyga highlighted the Pinkprint rapper’s “word play, punchlines, creativity” and more.\n\n“Nicki is the best female rapper of all time no one comes close! World play , punchlines , delivery, pockets , beat selection, creativity. Inflictions,” he tweeted."
