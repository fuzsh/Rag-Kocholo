        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's baby boy's name may've just been revealed. Bible.\n\nThe Kardashians star and the Blink-182 drummer recently celebrated their little one's upcoming arrival with a Disney-themed baby shower, with footage of the event circulating on social media over the weekend.\n\nAnd, after taking a closer look at the photos and videos from the magical baby shower, it appears that Kardashian and Barker settled on a name for their unborn baby: Rocky Barker.\n\nSpecifically, one decoration—an apple tree paying tribute to Disney classic Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs—featured sweet handwritten notes for the couple's unborn boy. And, as spotted in blurry party footage, one note referred to the little one as \"Baby Rocky.\"\n\n>>> Sign up for Parade's Trending News newsletter and we'll keep you in the know on the viral pop culture moments and celebrity news everyone is talking about <<<\n\nThis isn't wildly surprising to read, however, as Barker previously expressed interest in the name Rocky.\n\nIn an interview with Complex in July, the music producer noted that he liked \"Rocky 13\" as a moniker for his first child with Kardashian. He explained at the time, \"Rocky George played guitar for Suicidal Tendencies and 13 is just the greatest number of all time.\"\n\nStill, Rocky could just be a placeholder until Kardashian and Barker go public with the kiddo's real name.\n\nWe're sure Kardashian and Barker are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their baby, especially after the baby boy suffered a medical incident earlier in September.\n\n\"I will be forever grateful to my incredible doctors for saving our baby’s life,\" Kardashian wrote on Instagram after her baby required, what she described as, \"urgent fetal surgery.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock. And to my mom, thank you for holding my hand through this.\"\n\nKardashian—who is also a mom to kids Mason, 13, Penelope, 11 and Reign, 8—confirmed she was pregnant with baby No. 4 at Blink-182's Los Angeles concert in June. Not long after this public announcement, Kardashian and Barker revealed they're having a baby boy.\n\nBarker is also a dad to son Landon, 19, daughter Alabama, 17, and stepdaughter Atiana, 24, who he shares with ex-wife Shanna Moakler."
