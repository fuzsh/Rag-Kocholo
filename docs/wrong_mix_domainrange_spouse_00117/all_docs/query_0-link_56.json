        "text": "“I’m doing this because I want to help him go viral because this is sad,” Owens continued. “This is very sad. I want you to feel sad for Eminem. Because this is just not the way for someone’s career to go down the drain, and I want us all to do our part to help make Eminem relevant again. At the very least, he can be relevant just by me speaking about him. And he understands that.” Owens then went on to take more digs at Eminem’s career, claiming his verbal hits at her “would have meant something if he was at his prime,\" but “he is not at the peak of his career. He’s at the end of it.” As Owens is no stranger to making controversial statements, she kept true to form, going on to note that she believes Eminem is “making a plea to the public” of “’I hate white people.’”\n\n“He’s calling white people crackers,” Owens elaborated. “He’s using a slur against his own people who at the same time, unironically, accusing me of doing what he’s doing. He’s like ‘she turned her back on her own race’ as he turns his back on his race and calls them crackers. I’ve never used slurs to describe Black Americans because I don’t have an issue with my race but you very much have an issue with yours.” Owens had more to say on the race topic, noting, “Black Americans… they actually like me. They’re starting to hear what I have been saying... one of those people they’re not going to listen to is you, Eminem, because you’re so irrelevant… You’re the one that’s actually cos-playing a race that you aren’t. You’re desperate for Black Americans to pick up your tracks because you abandoned the audience of a lot of people who were listening to your music.” “He is a lesson to a lot of people out there that you need to know when it’s time to retire,” Owens concluded. ‘He still thinks he’s a 13 year old boy that is rapping in his room… when in reality he’s 51 years old.”"
