Well, replace Travis Barker with Kanye West and you've got the complete lineup for the mega collaboration track \"\n\n.\" It's likely they'll be performing it for the first time together live.\n\nAlso, just a hunch, but the fact Kanye was left out of the Grammy performance likely has something to do with\n\nat the MTV Video Music Awards back in September.\n\n\"Forever\" isn't\n\nfor any awards, but Eminem is up for three awards: Best Rap Solo Performance for \"\n\n,\" Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group for \"Crack a Bottle\" with Dr. Dre and Best Rap Album for \"\n\n.\"\n\nTune in on Sunday, Jan. 31 at 8 p.m. on CBS."
