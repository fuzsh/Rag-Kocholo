        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker took full advantage of being in Las Vegas this weekend for the Grammys: they had a secret wedding ceremony, gossip website TMZ reports.\n\nKourtney, 42, and Travis, 46 went to a wedding chapel around 1:30 AM Monday (April 4), following Barker’s Grammy performance with H.E.R. and Lenny Kravitz at the Grammys. Apparently, the couple didn’t allow the venue to take any photos and brought their own photographer and security instead. Sources connected to the couple told TMZ they had a marriage license and presented it to the chapel’s owner, who was also a witness. They were intent on having an Elvis impersonator officiate the ceremony. As we previously reported, this isn’t going to be the only ceremony the couple will have, as they are expected to have a more elaborate one this spring or summer, with their wedding showcasing both of their styles with “some sexiness and elegance,” a source said.\n\nTravis popped the question back in October at a beachside hotel in Montecito, CA with an elaborate floral arrangement on the sand. The couple has never been shy about their romance, packing on the PDA any chance they get. This marks Kourtney’s first marriage, who never said “I do” to ex Scott Disick despite having 3 children, Mason, 12, Penelope, 9, and Reign, 7, together. For Travis, this is his third marriage. He was with his first wife, Melissa Kennedy, for only 9 months before he filed for divorce back in 2002. The Blink-182 drummer then married Shanna Moakler a few years later in 2004, but filed for divorce after nearly 2 years in 2006 and in 2008 their divorce was finalized.\n\nGALLERY: Kourtney Kardashian Looking Fabulous On The Red Carpet\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
