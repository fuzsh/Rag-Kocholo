        "text": "Eminem settled his beef with Limp Bizkit and mgk in the new song \"Guilty Conscience 2,\" which appears on his brand new album The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce).\n\nThe record just came out today (July 12), and is apparently supposed to mark the metaphorical death of his alter ego Slim Shady. He initially released a song titled \"Guilty Conscience\" back on his 1999 second album The Slim Shady LP, and now, he has a \"Guilty Conscience 2.\"\n\nThe track is meant to serve as a dialogue between Eminem and Slim Shady, with both personas going back and forth at each other and referencing a variety of controversial topics and things that happened during the rapper's career.\n\nToward the end of the song, Eminem grabs hold of a gun and starts shooting Slim Shady, and mentions some notable figures he's dissed or had beef with in the past — including actor Christopher Reeve, mgk, Nick Cannon, Limp Bizkit, Benzino and a few others.\n\nSee the lyrics below [via Genius], and a summary of his beef with both artists underneath.\n\nYeah, bitch this is for him\n\nChristopher, MGK, Nick\n\nAnd for Limp Bizkit and them\n\nMidgets and Ben\n\n'Zino, in addition to him\n\nWill Smith and to Canibus\n\nIf you're listening, this is the end\n\nSo to Jamar and Ja Rule and to all\n\nMy feuds including ma\n\nI'm welcoming you to my\n\nLast hoorah, I bid you goodbye\n\nEminem, 'Guilty Conscience 2'\n\nWhat Happened Between Eminem and Limp Bizkit?\n\nThough the rapper appeared in the video for Limp Bizkit's \"Break Stuff\" in early 2000, he later wrote a diss track about the group titled \"Girls,\" which he released in 2001 with his side project D12.\n\nIn the lyrics, Eminem directly name-dropped Limp Bizkit, referring to them as \"corny son-of-a-bitches.\" He also called DJ Lethal a \"little fuckin' weasel\" and Fred Durst a \"Fuckin' sissy, up on stage / Screamin' how people hate you.\"\n\nD12, 'Girls'\n\nThe song was inspired by a beef Eminem had going on with Everlast. When he went to write a diss track about him, Limp Bizkit volunteered to be on it, then apparently backed out because DJ Lethal didn't want to betray Everlast, his House of Pain bandmate.\n\n“The reason I dissed Limp Bizkit is because they’re little fucking girls,” Eminem once said in an interview about the song.\n\nHe elaborated that he saw the band doing an interview on TV, and didn't like what DJ Lethal said when he was asked about the rapper's feud with Everlast.\n\nREAD MORE: The 10 Most Insane Nu-Metal Feuds of All Time\n\n\"Lethal says, ‘I think personally Eminem is a good rapper, he’s a better MC but I think in a fight, Everlast would whip his ass.' Now come on dawg... I’m sitting at home watching the TV and I’m like, ‘What?! What the fuck?! You were supposed to be on the song with me!’\"\n\nEminem Explains Why He Dissed Limp Bizkit on 'Girls'\n\nWhat Happened Between Eminem and mgk?\n\nEminem's feud with mgk was much more recent, dating back to before mgk's transition to pop-punk. In 2012, mgk wrote a tweet about Eminem's daughter Hailie, calling her \"hot as fuck.\"\n\nHailie was 16 at the time, and the musician was 22. He attempted to justify his remark by calling Eminem \"king.\"\n\nAfterward, mgk was apparently banned from radio stations because of the comment, according to Cosmopolitan. He talked about it in some interviews, and then referenced the situation on a Tech N9ne song in 2018 called \"No Reason.\"\n\nI pop cherries and pop stars, you popsicles is not hard\n\nPopped in on the top charts out the cop car\n\nTo remind y’all you just rap, you’re not God\n\nAnd I don’t care who got bars\n\nEminem fired back at mgk in the song \"Not Alike,\" which came out on his 2018 album Kamikaze.\n\nBut next time you don’t gotta use Tech N9ne if you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun\n\nAnd I’m talking to you but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly\n\nI don’t use sublims and sure as fuck don’t sneak-diss\n\nWithout getting too much into anymore detail, mgk released \"Rap Devil\" in shortly after, which was a diss track directed at Eminem, and then Eminem released his own called \"Killshot.\"\n\nThey went back and forth at each other a bit more in the press and other songs afterward, but it seems that Eminem has finally put the situation to rest.\n\nMGK, 'Rap Devil'\n\nEminem, 'Killshot'"
