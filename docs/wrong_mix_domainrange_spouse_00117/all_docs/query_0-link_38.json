Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license). Practice makes perfect.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecommended\n\nMarty Frierson, owner of the chapel, said he had received a phone call “asking for Elvis” in the early hours of Monday morning (April 4).\n\nHe told PA news agency via Sky News that he was not told which celebrities were coming to be wed at the chapel prior to their arrival, but that the couple had arrived at 1.45am (9.45am UK time) with four guests who had filmed the occasion.\n\nDespite their marriage confirmation, they are still not officially married until they obtain a marriage licence in the US state of Nevada.\n\nAdvertisement"
