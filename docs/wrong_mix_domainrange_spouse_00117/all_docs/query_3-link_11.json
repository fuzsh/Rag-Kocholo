        "text": "Here’s one more reason to tune into the Grammy Awards this Sunday. According to Rolling Stone, and the Grammy Awards’ official Twitter account, Eminem, Drake, Lil Wayne, and Blink-182’s Travis Barker are all scheduled for a “special performance.” Of course, if you’re familiar with the show, you’ll know “special performances” are a commonality, as the stage productions precede the actual awards.\n\nBut, where’s Kanye West, you ask? Given that West appears in the hit single “Forever”, which includes all of the aforementioned rappers, one would think he’d be involved, too. However, he’s nowhere on the bill. The reason? Anyone’s guess, though it’s one of two things. Either the award show wasn’t happy with his performance in last year’s all-star rap collaboration or West just isn’t welcome at award shows anymore.\n\nWe’re betting on the latter, although that conclusion doesn’t make much sense either, especially considering that the Chicago rapper is nominated for three of the five songs under “Best Rap/Sung Collaboration” (oddly enough, “Forever” is not one of them). In hindsight, it’s a pretty special performance with or without West as this might be your last chance to see Lil Wayne perform live (at least for quite some time). Next month, the Grammy nominated rapper will be in prison for last year’s gun charges.\n\nRelated Video\n\nThis all-star collaboration, however, is the latest addition to a lineup that already features Beyoncé, Roberta Flack, Lady Gaga, Elton John, Dave Matthews Band, and Taylor Swift. But, that’s not all. The Grammys have also announced some stranger performances, such as Green Day performing with its American Idiot musical cast and Jamie Foxx and T-Pain (nominated together for “Blame It”) performing with Slash and Doug E. Fresh (not nominated). The show will also feature a couple tributes: Jeff Beck and Imelda May honoring the recently-deceased Les Paul, and Usher, Carrie Underwood, Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson and Smokey Robinson doing a Michael Jackson tribute with 3D video.\n\nIn the meantime, CBS has been running Grammy commercials claiming a duet will commence the show; the duet is rumored to be Lady Gaga and Beyoncé performing “Telephone” off Gaga’s The Fame Monster."
