        "text": "The Beginning: Travis and Machine Gun Kelly Cover “Misery Business”\n\nI still remember seeing this video pop up in my recommended feed on YouTube during the early days of quarantine. It was a bit surprising to see Travis Barker for the first time in years, but even more surprising to see Machine Gun Kelly collaborating with him. I have a game I like to play called “Is that Machine Gun Kelly?” where I ask myself said question whenever Machine Gun Kelly pops up in places that confuse or surprise me. The beauty is that it happens a lot — such as when he played a flame demon being hunted by Jamie Fox in Project Power, hit a home run on LSD, or feuded with Eminem way past the point of interest. This video was no exception, and I cannot lie that I was presently surprised by the entire experience. The two play off each other extremely well and it’s easy to see that they energize eachother’s performances. By the end of the video, MGK is wailing his heart out into the microphone, while Barker does windmills on the cymbals — it’s pure gold. The addition of a legend like Barker also adds some credibility to MGK’s performance, making skeptics (myself included) accept that if Barker trusts him, he must be good. The video gained millions of views instantly, giving the world a taste of what the pair was capable of and generating tons of buzz for their next project.\n\nThe Next Project: MGK’s Tickets to My Downfall\n\nFor me, this album marked a turning point with MGK where he stopped being the guy who told Eminem his beard was weird and became Pete Davidson's friend who is actually pretty good at pop punk. Overall, this album was a very enjoyable listening experience. “bloody valentine” and “my ex’s best friend” were both instant saves with super catchy lyrics and really fun instrumentation. Despite “WWII” being only a minute long, it’s a quintessential pop punk song with super fast, tight drums and lyrics that sound like they were written by a hot topic employee on an especially terrible shift (MGK sings: “Hey / Who the fuck are you / To tell me what to do? / 'Cause I am not your bitch, shit!”).\n\nAll throughout, Travis Barker’s drums are one of the strongest elements. Like with the “Misery Business” cover, they make every song he’s on feel more “authentically” pop punk, as if Machine Gun Kelly is performing something that could have come out in 2008 just as much as 2020. Herein lies the key to Barker’s collaborations: reopening the door to pop punk with his familiar sounding drums so that new artists can take a turn on an old genre. If you decide to listen to this album I will warn you that the songs can get angsty and repetitive sometimes to the point of eyeroll. The aforementioned lyrics, along with a two minute interlude of him and Megan Fox that’s essentially an extended version of the “you smell like weed”/”I am weed” conversation, are guaranteed to produce some cringing throughout the album, though at the same time, they sort of add to the charm. At its core, the album is MGK fully embracing the overly dramatic angst of pop punk, and in order to fully enjoy it you kind of have to do the same.\n\nPutting Work In: Willow’s Lately I Feel EVERYTHING\n\nIn April of 2021 Willow released the single “t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l”, which featured Travis Barker on the drums. Genre-wise it was a pretty big departure from Willow’s previous work, but it, along with a cover of her mother’s heavy metal song on Red Table Talk, let the world know that she was going in a new direction. The single also demonstrated that Baker’s drums are a perfect match for Willow’s powerhouse vocals; together they produced a song you could really scream your heart out to. I counted the days until the release of her next album and when it came out in July, I played it on repeat for the whole summer. Unlike the MGK album, this featured less of Travis Barker and was much shorter, coming in at 26 minutes. The combination of these factors, along with Willow’s talent for songwriting, created a much fresher experience where each song really stood out on its own. Like the MGK album, Barker serves to elevate the lead musician to their fullest potential by setting up the pop punk foundation and letting them take the genre to new heights, which Willow does by incorporating sound elements which are uniquely hers. I think the chorus of “t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l” perfectly demonstrates this: the quick drum switch up into the chorus creates the perfect ramp up in energy before Willow’s long, powerful belt. The album has plenty of unforgettable tracks, such as the slow, haunting “Come Home” featuring Ayla Tesler-Mabe and “XTRA” which includes a great verse from Tierra Whack. Willow takes the album home by adding Barker back and bringing in pop punk legend Avril Lavigne for the song “G R O W,” an upbeat anthem about giving yourself time and space to heal. It’s the kind of song that could play at the end of a Hillary Duff movie after a bully falls into a conveniently placed fountain or a homecoming date is finally secured, which is exactly why it’s so good.\n\nReturn of The Queen: Avril Lavigne’s “Bite Me”\n\nTravis Barker’s latest collaboration is with Avril Lavigne for her single “Bite Me.” It’s the first song Lavigne has released in about a year, and in it she returns back to her early 2000’s roots with snappy drums and lyrics about getting screwed over by someone you trusted. The music video matches the energy and features Lavigne and Barker trashing an ex-boyfriend’s art studio in true pop punk fashion. What’s especially notable about this project is that it’s a collaboration with an already established pop punk artist, rather than a newcomer. Could it mean that Avril Lavine, and maybe even other older pop punk artists, are coming back to build on their older work? The beauty of Travis Barker is that he’s versatile enough to work with really anyone, which makes the possibility of future pop-punk revival collaborations all the more exciting.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nTravis Barker has provided a great foundation for pop punk to get back on its feet again. Whether or not people’s taste for it will last is to be seen, but I think there’s some real potential here to create something new. As demonstrated with Tickets to My Downfall and especially Lately I Feel EVERYTHING, new artists are putting their own spin on pop punk to create a new sound that takes the best things about the genre and blends them with modern elements. There’s more evidence of this outside of Travis Barker projects as well, exemplified by a few songs on Olivia Rodrigo’s Sour as well as my personal favorite, Fall Out Boy’s remix of 100 gec’s “hand crushed by a mallet.” The idea of hyper-pop-punk is so amazing that I’m upset it isn’t already a thing! The ultimate pain is realizing that no element of the music is safe in order to create something new, even those most quintessential like the drums. Attaching Barker to projects like these is sure to generate a sound that people recognize and love, but I also hope to see him step back and give new drummers a chance. Giving newcomers the opportunity to rethink that essential element could be the secret ingredient pop punk needs to truly blow up again."
