        "text": "After an iconic wedding ceremony in Vegas complete with an Elvis impersonator (post-Grammys, might we add), matching ‚Äôfits at the Met Gala, an entire weekend of wedding celebrations at a legit Italian castle in Portofino, and a tear-jerking pregnancy announcement, you could say that Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker are giving every other celeb couple a run for their money. While this pairing was surprising to fans at first, a little birdie told Us Weekly back in January 2021 that Travis was ‚Äúvery smitten with Kourtney and has been for a while.‚Äù Even though it seems like it‚Äôs been eons since then‚Äîamid horny Instagram comments, countless PDA moments, and even Insta surname changes (looking @ you, Kourt!)‚Äîit‚Äôs preeeetty safe to say these two are def in it for the long haul.\n\nAnd if by now you‚Äôre one of the *maybe* seven people still not well versed in all things Travis, allow me to fill you in. Fear not, oh curious one‚ÄîI have taken the liberty of investigating every detail about Travis‚Äôs earnings, assets, and more for your pleasure. You‚Äôre welcome!\n\nTravis has made big $$$ from being in Blink-182\n\nTravis wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be Blink‚Äôs full-time drummer, but when the band‚Äôs original drummer left the group in 1998 and they needed someone to fill in, Travis stepped up to the plate.\n\nBy 1999, the temporary gig became permanent and Travis and the rest of Blink-182 released their now-iconic debut album, Enema of the State. The album was a complete smash, and to date, it‚Äôs sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. So, uh‚Ä¶yeah, that translates to a sh*t ton of üí∏üí∏üí∏.\n\nTravis has also released five other albums with Blink-182: Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), Blink-182 (2003), Neighborhoods (2011), California (2016), and Nine (2019).\n\nHe‚Äôs released a bunch of albums in collaboration with other artists\n\nWhen Travis isn‚Äôt working with Blink-182, you can probs find him dropping something with his contemporaries. Travis‚Äôs three albums‚ÄîGive the Drummer Some, Rawther, and Might Not Make It‚Äîfeature his collaborative efforts with Lil Wayne, Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg, Kid Cudi, and Young Thug. The man is T-A-L-E-N-T-E-D.\n\nHe owns a record label, of course\n\nTravis founded LaSalle Records, a division of Atlantic Records, in 2004. Although most of the original signees have moved to other labels, LaSalle still represents Travis and Transplants, the punk rock/rap rock supergroup he‚Äôs also a part of.\n\nHe casually founded his own music/tattoo festival???\n\nBecause why the hell not, right?\n\nHe has ~major~ air time on The Kardashians\n\nLike all Kar-Jenner beaus do at some point (well, with the exception of Kendall‚Äôs lucky man)! Per Entertainment Tonightback in June 2021, ‚ÄúTravis is expected to make an appearance on the Kardashians‚Äô Hulu show. His kids may appear as well but not as much as he will be featured.‚Äù And on the show he is! Whether it‚Äôs being at Kourt‚Äôs side while they first embarked on their pregnancy journey to semi-awk interactions with Scott, we can now confirm the musician is def getting a slice of that reality TV show check.\n\nAaaaand he has his clothing line too\n\nTravis started dabbling in fashion and founded his own line of clothing in 1999 called Famous Stars and Straps, which is inspired by punk rock and rap music. Kim Kardashian, Eminem, Machine Gun Kelly, and Fergie have all been spotted in styles from the brand, so I‚Äôd say it isn‚Äôt doing too shabby.\n\nExactly what is Travis Barker‚Äôs net worth?"
