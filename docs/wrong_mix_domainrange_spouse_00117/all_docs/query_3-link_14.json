        "text": "When Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker first revealed plans for his debut solo album last February, the list of collaborators was already quite impressive: Lil Wayne, RZA, Rick Ross, The Game, Beanie Sigel, and Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor.\n\nSince then, as XXL reports, Barker has recruited even more hip-hop heavyweights, including Eminem, Drake (duh), T.I., Pharrell Williams, Snoop Dogg, RZA, Lupe Fiasco, Clipse, Yelawolf, and The Cool Kids. In other words, basically everyone except Kanye… but he has an excuse.\n\nXXL reports the still-untitled record is due for release in October, and that Barker not only handled the album’s drumming but its production as well.\n\nOf course, we’ll update you as more details become available."
