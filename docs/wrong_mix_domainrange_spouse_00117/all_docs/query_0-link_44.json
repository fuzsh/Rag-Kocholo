        "text": "Eminem's girlfriends and love life have always made headlines even though he prefers to keep personal details away from the spotlight. But his relationship with Mariah Carey was especially tumultuous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn Marshall Bruce Mathers III in St. Joseph, Missouri, on October 17, 1972, Eminem has had an outstanding music career spanning three decades. Although he often makes headlines, he has kept most details of his dating life under wraps.\n\nEminem has been romantically involved with a few celebrities, married the same woman twice, and has three children. However, he doesn't trust people easily, which makes dating harder. Read on and see all the women Eminem has dated.\n\nEminem on January 30, 2020 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nEMINEM MARRIED KIM SCOTT TWICE\n\nRap fans have probably heard Kim Scott Mathers' name before, mainly because she has been the only woman capable of marrying \"The Real Slim Shady\" singer not once but twice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim was born on January 9, 1975, and she met Eminem at a house party in 1988. Although she was 13 and he was 15, they hit it off immediately and dated throughout high school.\n\nOn December 25, 1995, four years before Eminem achieved worldwide fame with \"The Slim Shady LP,\" he and Kim welcomed their eldest daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers.\n\nEminem and Kim Scott circa 1995 | Source: Getty Images\n\nHailie got a psychology degree from Michigan State University in 2018 but is now a social media personality. Eminem admitted Hailie made him proud and also credited her for helping him go through life and overcome his insecurities.\n\nIn 1999, Eminem and Kim tied the knot. Unfortunately, their relationship was short-lived, and they divorced only two years later. The former couple shared custody of their daughter for most of her upbringing, but their relationship was far from perfect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationship between [â€¦] Mariah Carey and Eminem has made headlines for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Kim,\" one of Eminem's songs in his 2000 album \"The Marshall Mathers LP,\" reflected intense hatred toward Kim even though they were still married.\n\nThe song understandably hurt Kim, but after Eminem performed it on stage with a blow-up doll, she self-harmed and needed hospitalization. Kim also had problems with the law during and after her relationship with Eminem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter leaving the rapper, Kim was in a relationship with Eric Hartter and welcomed Whitney, now known as Stevie Laine, in 2002.\n\nEminem and Kim worked things out and gave love a second try. He adopted Stevie in 2005 and married Kim in 2006. However, they divorced later that year, supposedly because of Kim's substance abuse.\n\nKim needed time, but she eventually got sober and became a children's book writer and illustrator. Unfortunately, she made headlines again in July 2021 after attempting suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was hospitalized for medical and psychological evaluation and has kept a low profile since then. Apart from Stevie and Hailie, Eminem and Kim have another girl named Alaina.\n\nKim's twin sister, Dawn Scott, welcomed Alaina in February 1993. Dawn struggled with addiction for years, so Kim and Eminem took care of Alaina since she was born. Dawn died in 2016.\n\nEminem and Brittany Murphy in a \"8 Mile\" scene in 2002 | Source: Getty Images\n\nWHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN EMINEM AND BRITTANY MURPHY?\n\nOne of Eminem's career highlights is \"8 Mile,\" the 2002 film he starred in alongside late actress Brittany Murphy. Murphy and Eminem reportedly dated while filming.\n\nAlthough they never confirmed their relationship, how they addressed the situation sparked even more rumors. Murphy didn't name anyone but admitted there was romance off the screen. It \"came and went,\" though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2018, [Nicki Minaj] claimed they were dating.\n\nBrittany Murphy on November 26, 2006 in London, Great Britain | Source: Getty Images\n\nMurphy and Eminem also spoke highly of each other. She described him as one of the funniest and most honest and hard-working actors she had worked with. He said she was a good person with whom he was very close at one point.\n\nHowever, Murphy once said the dating rumors were \"not true,\" and she would never be \"Mrs. Marshall Mathers.\" She began dating Ashton Kutcher shortly after \"8 Mile\" hit theaters and sadly died on December 20, 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDID EMINEM DATE MARIAH CAREY?\n\nThe relationship between \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" singer Mariah Carey and Eminem has made headlines for years. It is essential to point out that Carey denied dating him, though. She explained:\n\n\"I hung out with [Eminem]. I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times, and I don't consider that dating somebody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Carey claims they never dated, they were about to have sex. They didn't do it because Eminem was so excited that things ended earlier than expected.\n\nThey have released songs dissing each other since then. Carey's \"Obsessed,\" released in June 2009, is believed to be about the rapper because the music video shows a man looking like Eminem stalking Carey.\n\nOne month later, Eminem fired back and addressed their relationship in \"The Warning.\" He referenced Carey in a few other songs, proving that their feud was more serious than most people thought.\n\nNicki Minaj and Eminem on February 13, 2011 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nNICKI MINAJ DENIED DATING EMINEM\n\nEminem and Nicki Minaj released \"Roman's Revenge\" in 2010. Since then, they have kept play-fighting and mentioning each other in their songs, but in May 2018, she claimed they were dating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMinaj revealed it was a joke shortly after, but Eminem didn't let the situation go that easily. He asked concert-goers in Boston if he should date Minaj, and they said yes. Eminem then sent Minaj a message during the concert, asking her to text him later to discuss it.\n\nShe addressed the situation on Twitter and wrote that Eminem was \"silly and a goof\" like her. Minaj added that he should be part of her \"Queen\" album and joked their first date would be at the studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEMINEM WAS RUMORED TO HAVE DATED MANY WOMEN\n\nApart from Minaj, Eminem has been linked to many other celebrities. He reportedly dated Gina Lynn after appearing in one of his music videos, but they never confirmed their relationship.\n\nEminem allegedly dated Kim Basinger (his on-screen mother in \"8 Mile\"), Britney Spears, Joy McAvoy, Skylar Grey, and many other women, but he has never confirmed most of those relationships. Nowadays, Eminem appears to be single and focused on his music career.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text \"help\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741, or go to suicidepreventionlifeline.org."
