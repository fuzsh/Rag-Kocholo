        "text": "Chicago rapper Vic Mensa is a fascinating artist, one who is as comfortable making punk music with Blink-182's Travis Barker and Bad Brains' H.R. as he is opening for Jay-Z on his 4:44 tour.\n\nMensa, whose debut The Autobiography, earned him strong reviews as well as the opening spot on the jay-Z tour, among other gigs, has a lot of new music, from punk to hip-hop, and a clothing line, Punk93, due this year.\n\n\"There's always somebody telling you what you're not supposed to like. But that's not the way I grew up,\" Mensa says. \"So now that I've been making music for some time that's not the way I create. And people can say what they want and say I should just stick to a sound and can say I'm f**king reaching because I'm trying to make punk music and Afro-beat music and rap music, but I'm like, 'F**k you, this is the s**t I like. This is what I've been listening to my whole life.'\"\n\nIn one of the most compelling and provocative editions yet of Who I Am Mensa tells me how skateboarding, Nirvana, Nas and police brutality, among other things, made him into one of the most intriguing and diverse young artists in music going into 2019.\n\nTattooed Skater Dad (Age 6)\n\nThis was a dude in my neighborhood in Chicago, Hyde Park. He was all tatted up and he used to push his baby around in a stroller riding his skateboard. He owned a skateboard warehouse and he gave me my first skateboard and taught me how to Ollie. So much of my life and my style and sensibility are influenced by skateboarding. It's counter-culture and skateboarding is my introduction to counter-culture. I got into hip hop through skateboarding, graffiti and the music that is in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is probably the first time I heard Rage Against The Machine. Skateboarding is a real pillar of who I am.\n\nNirvana, Nevermind (Age 10)\n\nI remember this girl that came to my school in fifth grade and she introduced us to Nirvana and had us writing all the bands we liked in Sharpie on our Converse Chuck Taylors. She was the one that really introduced me to Nirvana, which was music that I immediately resonated with. It's like when you find something that is tailor-made for you, that describes the way you feel. Being someone that grew up in a biracial household I never really felt accepted by black people when I was a little kid, I didn't feel fully accepted by black kids and I definitely didn't feel fully accepted by white kids cause I just felt like I could never be neither one. So Kurt [Cobain's] lyrics really speaks to the soul of someone who doesn't feel accepted.\n\nKRS-One, The Mix Tape (Age 11)\n\nI wasn't really into hip hop before that. I didn't identify a certain way with hip hop because I didn't understand it. I didn't get why Eminem and 50 Cent were so mad. I didn't realize 50 had been shot nine times either, that's a good reason to be mad. But I just remember I didn't identify with the rap music that much. And right around that age is when I started to realize myself as a young black man. That's when society starts to really treat you differently and I could just see the way the police went from like, \"Get over here\" to \"Take your hands out of your hoodie before I punch you in the f**king face.\" Oh, I get it, f**k the police. So that's around the same time I was introduced to KRS-One. He was like, \"I'm not saying I'm number one/Oh, sorry, I lied/I'm number one, two, three, four and five.\" And it was just like brute force and intelligent and anti-establishment. These are the things I already did identify with and so when hip hop was introduced to me through skateboarding and it started to make sense to me.\n\nNas, Illmatic (Age 12)\n\nIllmatic is like The Bible to us. I used to print out lyrics from Nas songs and write my own lyrics in the same syllable count but with different words and different rhymes. What's so ill about Illmatic is that I feel like it puts this timeless literary analogy in front of us for rap and hip hop. You print Nas lyrics out, you write them out and it reads like [Ernest] Hemmingway. Rap is often characterized by a lot of people who don't understand it as being mindless, thug s**t, but when you're growing up in the inner city areas and you're seeing all of this inequity and I'm looking outside the window and I'm just starting to question, \"Why it is that I don't live in this nice house and these guys down the street with these big-ass mansions? What has created this division between them and the buildings across that street from me that are Section 8 where they're selling drugs out the window and people are getting shot on the corner?\" When you're trying to put all those things together and to understand it, Nas is somebody that is just informed and writes from the perspective of a kid like me looking out the window. Nas wasn't a big-time kingpin in his music and wasn't like a gangster. He was the observer and the narrator. He was an author and I always was a heavy reader, so Nas contextualized all this s**t to me as I'm starting to write lyrics and made me see hip hop as being an author and a narrator and create on that literary level of the greats, but in our own street-informed medium.\n\n\"Glow In The Dark Tour\" (Age 14)\n\nThat was crazy. That's when I was like, \"I wanna do that!\" It was so grandiose and such an artistic expression, the absolute coolest s**t I'd ever seen in my life. I remember my girlfriend at the time, her mom got us tickets to the \"Glow In The Dark\" tour. I'm in the crowd and I'm seeing N.E.R.D. performing on stage, Lupe Fiasco, my absolute favorite, it was the coolest. Lyrically, he was light years ahead of everybody. Then I saw N.E.R.D. and despite growing up and being hella into rock music I didn't get N.E.R.D. yet. I didn't know their music yet. I just remember staring at it, they're doing \"Spaz,\" I'm looking at it like, \"What the f**k is this? I don't even know, but this is crazy fresh.\" Then Kanye [West] being on the spaceship I was like, \"Oh yeah, I need to be a part of this.\" I was into rap, but I wasn't trying to be a rapper. I had been freestyling, but I wasn't writing raps or writing songs or trying to do that. That was the moment that really made me want to be a part of it from a creative aspect.\n\nRage Against The Machine, Evil Empire (Age 16)\n\nThis was a pivotal musical moment that showed me this intersection between rock music and rap music and it was punk as f**k and was so topical and so charged and so powerful. And being the age I picked up on that, I had just started reading Malcolm X and Huey Newton and Black Panther revolutionary thought processes were swirling around in my adolescent mind. And that music hit me right at the right time because it took everything I was reading and put it to beats and guitars, which were the two things I loved most, in rap form. So that album is everything to me. I've been working with Tom [Morello] and he's the coolest f**king dude.\n\nFalling Off The Bridge At Lollapalooza (Age 17)\n\nI was trying to sneak into Lollapalooza. There was this Spanish foreign exchange student I was madly in love with who was like, \"Come to the South Side with me.\" And I was bringing her back to the festival. It's a crazy age because that's the age when people around me started to die and that never slowed down. That's when it really started. That's when I started feeling the weight of morality. I was in a place like Chicago, people started disappearing and a good friend of mine drowned. My mentality was all f**ked up and I went back to the festival. Growing up in the city we didn't have Lollapalooza money. So I sent her in there and I'm thinking I'm gonna sneak in easy cause that's what I did the day before. But security was very heightened. and my mentality was off because I just found out my friend died. I tried to climb off this bridge, some Spider-Man s**t cause I'd been doing graffiti forever, and I got shocked by 15,000 volts of electricity and I fell 30 feet. Somehow I just got up and walked away until the transit police came and arrested me and my arm had a huge electrical burn in it. I still got the scar. I was in the hospital for some time. That was impactful to me because it was my first real brush with death and also a moment that really made me feel I was alive for a purpose.\n\nPolice Killing Of Laquan McDonald (Age 21)\n\nThat was a very impactful moment for me because it takes place in what I feel is a larger turning point in this ongoing civil rights struggle, whatever you want to call it, Black Lives Matter. It's all a continuation of the civil rights movement, I believe. And that moment, Laquan McDonald being killed by the police on video, 15 shots, is also coming right around the time Tamir Rice was killed, Mike Brown, Trayvon Martin, and all of these executions, black boys forefront in the news. And I feel like our ability to see all the information in the internet age, it makes it like Emmett Till on repeat. Emmett Till's mother opted for that open casket and those photographs of his battered body and face, lynched, for the alleged whistling of a white woman. That moment was a serious catalyst for the civil rights movement, because it brought just that visceral reaction of this heinous nature of racism in America right to everybody's Sunday paper. And I feel like that's what Laquan McDonald's killing did for me. And it galvanized me, in a way, to focus a lot more of my energy on the betterment of the situation of black people, of my people. Working in the community and also making my music explicitly political at the time in ways. That changed everything for me. All those things on camera, I think that just lit a fire under our ass.\n\nPerforming On Saturday Night Live With Kanye (Age 21)\n\nThat was so dope because it was just full circle, going from really getting into rap and hip hop through Kanye's \"Glow In The Dark\" tour to sharing the stage with him. It kind of felt like, in certain ways, I had come of age and it confirmed to me that I was on the right path and I was in the presence of my idols and creating with my idols. That was super impactful for me because creating music with Kanye and being on that stage was a real turning point in my life. It was like I had come of age.\n\nVisiting Palestine (Age 25)\n\nThis was last August and going to Palestine was very impactful for me because it informed my global perspective on oppression and white supremacy, for sure. I was speaking earlier about the intersection between struggles of different oppressed people. And being out there and just witnessing firsthand this very potent brand of racism and white supremacy made me realize how much of a duty I feel, as someone who is of the oppressed people and speaks for the oppressed people, to keep my eye on the world around me and to be an ally to those in different struggles globally. You see what these people are going through in real life and it makes you realize we are blessed in certain ways and also that we have so much work to do. It's a lifelong battle."
