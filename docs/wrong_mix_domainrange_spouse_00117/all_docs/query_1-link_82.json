In the months that have ensued, we've seen Travis getting Kourtney's name tattooed on him and many, many moments of PDA.\n\n\"Isn't it great?\" Kris said to Ryan Seacrest on his radio show. \"I know, it's the best.\"\n\nKris was then asked for her thoughts on Kourtney's Instagram pics of a vial of Travis's blood.\n\n\"Here's the thing. I don't know what that means,\" Kris jokingly replied. \"I've got to have a little chat with Ms. Kourtney and find out what's going on.\"\n\nPlease let us know when you do, Kris!\n\nShare This Article"
