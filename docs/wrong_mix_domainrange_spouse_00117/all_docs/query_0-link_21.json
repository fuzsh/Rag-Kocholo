        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian has revealed the emergency that had husband Travis Barker racing home while out on tour with his band Blink-182. The reality personality — who is pregnant with the couple’s first child together — shared in an Instagram post that she recently had surgery to save their unborn child.\n\n“I will be forever grateful to my incredible doctors for saving our baby’s life,” she began her post on Wednesday (Sept. 6), which was accompanied by a black-and-white photo of the drummer holding the Poosh founder’s hand while she appeared to be in the hospital. “I am eternally grateful to my husband who rushed to my side from tour to be with me in the hospital and take care of me afterwards, my rock.”\n\n“As someone who has had three really easy pregnancies in the past, I wasn’t prepared for the fear of rushing into urgent fetal surgery,” she continued. “I don’t think anyone who hasn’t been through a similar situation can begin to understand that feeling of fear. I have a whole new understanding and respect for the mamas who have had to fight for their babies while pregnant.”\n\nThe Kardashians star concluded her post by thanking God and counting her blessings. “Walking out of the hospital with my baby boy in my tummy and safe was the truest blessing,” she shared.\n\nBlink-182 — who had been touring overseas — announced on Instagram Sept. 1 that the band was postponing shows in Ireland and Scotland. “Due to an urgent family matter, Travis has had to return home to the States,” the band said at the time without divulging further information about the situation.\n\nBarker and Kardashian married in May 2022. She shares kids Mason, Penelope and Reign with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick; the drummer is dad to Landon and Alabama, and stepdad to Atiana with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.\n\nThe reality star announced her pregnancy to the world during Blink-182’s June 16 concert in Los Angeles. She shared the news by holding up a sign that read “Travis I’m Pregnant,” recreating a scene from the band’s music video for “All the Small Things.”\n\nRead Kardashian’s announcement below:"
