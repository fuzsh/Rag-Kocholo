During the event, she held up a cardboard sign from the audience that read, \"TRAVIS IM PREGNANT.\"\n\nThe ups and downs of Kourtney's pregnancy\n\nIn June, the couple unveiled their baby's sex during a rock 'n' roll-themed party. Barker hinted at their son's name in a post about the event, saying, \"I already know his name ,\" and later mentioning \"Rocky 13\" as a name option.\n\nIn September, Kardashian stirred excitement when she shared and then deleted a photo from a baby shower that featured the same moniker. Barker\"liked\" a tweet praising the name as \"cute\" and later confirmed their choice.\n\nThe musician had to leave Blink-182'sEuropean tour abruptly in the same month to be there for his wife during \"urgent fetal surgery.\"\n\nKardashian opened up about the \"terrifying\" procedure in an October Vogue interview, expressing gratitude for an ultrasound that \"saved\" their baby's life without providing further details.\n\nKeeping up with the Barker-Kardashians\n\nBefore their romantic relationship, both stars were parents. Barker shares a son, Landon, 20, and a daughter, Alabama, 17, with Shanna Moakler. He also has a close relationship with Atiana, 24, his ex-wife's daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nThe reality TV star shares Mason, 13, Penelope, 10, and Reign, 8, with her ex Scott Disick.\n\nWhen blending their families, Kardashian and Barker welcomed the idea of \"the more kids, the merrier.\" Kourtney stated during a May 2022 episode of her family's show that marrying Barker gave her \"more people to love,\" emphasizing her deep affection for his children.\n\nIn the following year, the couple shared their intention to stop pursuing IVF treatments and focus on conceiving naturally to expand their family."
