        "text": "Drake, Lil Wayne, Eminem and Travis Barker are the latest acts added to the Grammy roster.\n\nAccording to an early Thursday tweet posted on the official Grammy Awards Twitter page, the three rappers and drummer will team up for a “special performance” at Sunday night’s presentation. Although the song the group will be performing wasn’t announced, the rap crew represents nearly the entire line-up for the remix to Drake’s “Forever” song, sans Kanye West. The song reached No. 2 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in October.\n\nLady Gaga, previously announced as a performer, will open the show.\n\nAs previously reported, Mary J. Blige and Andrea Bocelli will perform Simon & Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” to raise money for the victims of the Haiti earthquake. Other performers include: Beyoncé, the Black Eyed Peas, Dave Matthews Band and Taylor Swift (with Gaga, the five Album of the Year nominees) as well as Bon Jovi, Green Day, Lady Antebellum, Maxwell, Pink and the Zac Brown Band. In addition, the show will host a 3-D tribute to Michael Jackson featuring Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson, Smokey Robinson, Carrie Underwood and Usher."
