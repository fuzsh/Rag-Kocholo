Another chimed in, “I’m so sorry but the toilet pic is nasty. I hope Kourtney approved that?”\n\nBarker’s birthday tribute, of course, included other snaps of his spouse.\n\nKourtney Kardashian claps back at body shamer on her 45th birthday: ‘I LOVE this body’\n\nSeveral show tender moments exchanged between the reality star and their 5-month-old son, Rocky Thirteen.\n\nOthers show Kardashian lounging in bed, on a private jet and on a boat with Barker.\n\n“Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife, soulmate and best friend forever. I love you,” the “Miss You” musician — who married Kardashian in 2022 — wrote in an accompanying caption.\n\n“I love our life together. Thank you for being the most amazing wife a person could ask for,” he continued.\n\n“Here’s to many more years of adventure together.”\n\nKardashian’s famous family members also sent her birthday blessings in equally touching social media posts.\n\nKourtney Kardashian celebrates her birthday with a hilarious cake and more star snaps\n\n“Happy Birthday Queen @kourtneykardash There’s no one on this planet that I have spent more time with and have all of the same memories with growing up than you and I cherish them all,” Kim Kardashian wrote alongside a photo of the sisters enjoying a recent beach vacation to Turks and Caicos.\n\n“Sharing a room and friends and cars and our lives together for four decades has been the most magical journey to have you by my side. I love you and I can’t wait for another 45 years together!” the Skims creator, 43, continued.\n\n“I will especially cherish this last sister trip where all of our kids had dance parties til they passed out, the way we all did growing up! Celebrating you today and grateful to you forever for always giving the best advice a sister could possibly give!”\n\nMeanwhile, momager Kris Jenner reflected on her eldest daughter’s milestone birthday by acknowledging that “time is twirling so fast.”\n\n“And I can’t believe you are 45!!!” Jenner, 68, captioned her Instagram post.\n\n“It seems like just the other day you were wearing your 5 year old party hat going to Buckley to be the line leader and I was bringing cupcakes for the class to celebrate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO PAGE SIX DAILY FOR MORE CELEBRITY NEWS\n\n“Well you have grown into the most beautiful and amazing daughter, wife, mommy, sister, auntie and best friend a girl can have,” she elaborated.\n\n“You are a kick ass business boss and I am so proud of you every day! Thank you for making me a grandma for the first time and for every single moment and memory we share. I love you beyond measure ❤️🙏🏼.”\n\nKourtney replied in the comments of Jenner’s post, expressing her gratitude for the sweet sentiments.\n\n“I love you mommy! ❤ time is flying so fastttttt!” wrote the mother of four, who shares Rocky Thirteen with Barker and kids Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9, with ex Scott Disick.\n\n“So grateful for every memory with you.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kourtney’s sister Khloé Kardashian shared her own celebratory message beneath Jenner’s post.\n\n“Happy birthday my dapper little cutie,” the Good American designer, 39, wrote. “We love you my Janey balls!
