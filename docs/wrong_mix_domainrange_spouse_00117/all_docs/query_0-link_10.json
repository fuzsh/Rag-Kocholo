        "text": "Shanna Moakler Says She’s ‘Sick’ Of The ‘F*cking Kardashians’ & No Longer Speaks To Ex-Husband, Travis Barker\n\nShanna Moakler isn’t holding back when it comes to her feelings about the Kardashian family and her relationship with ex-husband Travis Barker.\n\nIn a recent interview, Shanna Moakler, 49, expressed her frustration with the constant attention surrounding the Kardashians, especially concerning Travis Barker’s current wife, Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nInitially reflecting on a tumultuous period following the deaths of both her parents in 2023, Shanna Moakler shared,\n\n“I was in a very, very dark place… Paparazzi were at my front door from the Kardashian media circus with Travis. It was on another level, and I didn’t know how to deal. I was sad. And I just missed my parents so much.”\n\nThings took a turn when she firmly stated,\n\n“I also don’t have to like the f****** Kardashians, and I’m honestly sick of talking about them. As I stand here today, as a mature woman who’s gone through all that… I do not give a f*** what anyone thinks of me anymore. I’m proud of who I am.”\n\nRegarding Shanna Moakler’s current relationship with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, she revealed,\n\n“We don’t speak anymore. I don’t have a relationship with Travis, but I think that’s okay. I don’t feel like it’ll be like that forever, but I feel like right now — I think that’s where we are at in our evolution, and maybe in the future, it’ll change.”\n\nMoakler’s connection to Travis Barker, 48, dates back to their marriage in 2004. They share two children: Landon Asher, 20, and Alabama Luella, 18.\n\nOn May 15, 2022, Barker married 45-year-old reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian. They welcomed a baby in November 2023.\n\nShanna Moakler continues to be vocal about her challenges in the media spotlight, including her grief over losing both parents and her struggles to redefine herself and her public image. She is working on directing and starring in both scripted and reality TV shows while continuing her role as a pageant director, helping other women achieve their dreams of becoming Miss USA.\n\nWhat do you think of Shanna’s latest comments?
