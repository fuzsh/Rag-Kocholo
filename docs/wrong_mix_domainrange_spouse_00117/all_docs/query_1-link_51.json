        "text": "Timid Doesn't Love The Way You Lie\n\nNew York, NY\n\nHead Nod Music\n\nwww.HeadNodMusic.com\n\nTimid remixes the Eminem hit \"Love The Way You Lie\" that features Rihanna expanding the idea of the original of relationship turmoil to the societal zeitgeist. Timid's point is that we apparently, as the hook suggests, \"Love the way you lie\" and \"Like the way it hurts\" the way we continue actions that may satisfy us in the present while fooling ourselves that they aren't ultimately working against ourselves.\n\nDOWNLOAD: Timid - Love The Way You Lie (Eminem f.
