        "text": "'There's not many songs I hear and trip out on, but this was one of them,' drummer says of the Relapse track.\n\nIt's one of the darkest, goriest songs on an album positively oozing with dark and gory songs. That's why Travis Barker knew he had to record a version of Eminem's \"3 A.M.\"\n\n\"I first heard it on some blogs, and right away, I was like, 'Oh, damn, this is demonic,' and I love stuff like that.\" Barker laughed. \"So I spoke to [Blink-182 and Eminem manager] Paul Rosenberg and said I wanted to do a remix of it, then Em and I spoke and discussed putting a rock twist on the song, and I got to it.\"\n\nSo, over the course of four very short days — during breaks from rehearsals for Blink's upcoming tour — Barker and a pair of his engineer pals laid down live guitar and bass tracks (and, of course, a healthy dose of his patented precise-yet-pounding drums). He sent them to Em for some tweaking, then put the finished product up on YouTube, and the rest is history.\n\n\"There's not many songs I hear and trip out on, but this was one of them. The song is really dark and moody, and so that's what I wanted the remix to be,\" Barker said. \"And it was cool, because I got to work with Eminem the producer, which is something that I don't think a lot of people get to do. He listened to it, made some tweaks and gave it the OK.\"\n\nAnd for Barker, it was a welcome return to the world of remixing — a world he's dominated over the past years with his takes on Flo Rida's \"Low\" and Soulja Boy's \"Crank That.\" He had to take a break from remixing while recovering from the dozens of surgeries he endured after walking away from a fiery South Carolina plane crash last year.\n\n\"I hadn't done one since I was out of the hospital, so it was time, you know?\" Barker said. \"This was a dope-ass song, and when things come at me that I love, I pursue them. I was due for one, and it won't be the last.\"\n\n- MTV.com\n\nComment the news below or talk about it in the forum."
