        "text": "Rita Ora's love life has become akin to Rihanna, with a constant shuffle of lovers being reported week to week. Since parting ways with Rich Hil, Rita Ora was tied to Wiz Khalifa, but only for a brief moment (and really, that appeared to all be convenient promotion for the UK singer's collaboration with Wiz). After Wiz rumors died down, she was spotting holding hands with an unknown dude. As of late though, rumors have been swirling that she's dating former Blink-182 drummer, Travis Barker, a rumor which Travis' reps have now confirmed with TMZ.\n\nThe two have reportedly been spending every day together since they became acquainted at the Power 106 All Star Celebrity Basketball Game in LA, which was just ten days ago. So their romantic involvement is still pretty new. We'll have to see how long this one lasts."
