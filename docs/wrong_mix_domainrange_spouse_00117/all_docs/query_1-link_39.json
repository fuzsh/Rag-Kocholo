        "text": "A year after first teasing the project, Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker release their new album Tickets To My Downfall, which sees 15 tracks and additional appearances from Halsey, Trippie Redd, Blackbear, and Iann Dior. The project marks MGK’s fifth official LP and was preceded by the singles “concert for aliens,” “my ex’s best friend,” and “bloody valentine,” the last of which sees him taking on new concepts around love:\n\n“I don’t do fake love, but I’ll take some from you tonight, I know I’ve got to go, but I might just miss the flight/\n\nI can’t stay forever, let’s play pretend, and treat this night like it’ll happen again, you’ll be my bloody valentine tonight…/”\n\nTickets To My Downfall is also notable for its expansion into other genres like pop and punk rock, something that Kelly gradually began teasing on previous efforts like 2017’s Bloom and last year’s Hotel Diablo. Visuals, performances, and even his album artwork have sees him donning and playing a pink guitar, adding to his overall musical skill set.\n\nIn promotion of Tickets To My Downfall, Machine Gun Kelly recently sat down with Howard Stern, speaking on his relationship with Megan Fox, Pete Davidson, Eminem (or lack therof), and more. He also further explained the album title, revealing that it called to the assumption that the masses were looking for him to fail:\n\n“The Goodyear blimp is just up there. It’s cool to look at once or twice and then you forget that it’s up there, but if that thing catches on fire and starts falling to the ground we’re all going to be like, ‘Oh, wow, look at that,’ … We just want to see it crash and burn.”\n\nPress play on Machine Gun Kelly and Travis Barker’s Tickets To My Downfall below."
