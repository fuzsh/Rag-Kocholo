You look great!\"\n\nOne TikTok user tried to rationalise the initial comments, and said it came from a place of concern, \"I think people are just concerned about the over sexualization of youth in Hollywood/La culture.\"\n\nKourtney Kardashian puts husband Travis Barker on a 'sex ban' after struggling to conceive\n\nAlabama replied directly to this comment and justified her video: \"Well I'm doing great thank u.\""
