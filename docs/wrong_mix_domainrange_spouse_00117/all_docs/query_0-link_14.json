        "text": "Travis Barker learned his wife Kourtney Kardashian is expecting their baby when she held up a sign saying \"Travis I'm Pregnant\" at a Blink-182 show on Friday night (June 16).\n\nBlink were performing at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles when Kardashian held up the sign, catching the attention of bassist Mark Hoppus who alerted drummer Barker – who appeared stunned by the news.\n\nThe couple, who recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary, have documented their IVF journey on reality TV show The Kardashians.\n\nThe sign is a reference to the video for Blink's 1999 hit single All the Small Things in which a fan holds up a sign that says “Travis I’m Pregnant”.\n\nWhen the drummer, 47, realises what is happening, he leaves his drum stool to jump down into the audience and embrace his wife, 44. Footage of the sweet moment can be viewed in the couple's Instagram post below.\n\nBlink-182 are on the road as part of their World Tour. Tom DeLonge recently rejoined the band after a spell away from the lineup. Alkaline Trio's Matt Skiba replaced DeLonge in 2015 and recorded two albums with Blink, including 2016's critically acclaimed California.\n\nWhen DeLonge rejoined the fold last year, Skiba stood aside.\n\nBlink-182 World Tour 2023/2024\n\nNORTH AMERICA\n\nJun 20: San Diego Pechanga Arena, CA\n\nJun 22: San Jose SAP Center, CA\n\nJun 23: Sacramento Golden 1 Center, CA\n\nJun 25: Seattle Climate Pledge Arena, WA\n\nJun 27: Vancouver Rogers Arena, BC\n\nJun 29: Edmonton Rogers Place, AB\n\nJun 30: Calgary Scotiabank Saddledome, AB\n\nJul 03: Denver Ball Arena, CO\n\nJul 05: Dallas American Airlines Center, TX\n\nJul 07: Austin Moody Center, TX\n\nJul 08: Houston Toyota Center, TX\n\nJul 10: Tampa Amalie Arena, FL\n\nJul 11: Ft.
