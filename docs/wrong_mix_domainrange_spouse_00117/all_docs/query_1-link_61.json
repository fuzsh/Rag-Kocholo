        "text": "Reality television personality Kourtney Kardashian and musician Travis Barker have announced their engagement after eight months of dating. According to E! News, Travis proposed to Kourtney on Sunday at Rosewood Miramar hotel in Montecito, California.\n\nKourtney, 42, confirmed the news on her Instagram moments after the Blink-182 drummer popped the question. \"forever @travisbarker,\" the former \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star wrote alongside photos of the couple locked in an embrace.\n\nKourtney has three children Mason, 11, Penelope, nine, and Reign, six, who she co-parents with former husband and Talentless founder Scott Disick.\n\n\"Kourtney looked very surprised to see Khloe and Tristan there. Travis escorted Kourtney down to the beach, where he had red and white florals set up in the shape of a heart. It looked very romantic. I could see Kourtney smiling from ear to ear and put her hand over her mouth looking surprised. The family cheered for them and went back into the hotel,\" an eyewitness told E! News.\n\nBack in December 2020, Kourtney and Travis, known by fans as Kravis, sparked romance rumours. They later make their relationship Instagram official in February 2021 with a picture of their intertwined hands. In just the past couple of months, the pair has documented romantic vacations to Palm Springs, Utah, Las Vegas and the Happiest Place on Earth.\n\nAs for what Scott Disick thinks of the relationship, the Talentless founder has been supportive of his ex's public romance with Travis. In fact, the pair continues to successfully co-parent their three kids including Mason, 11, Penelope, 9, and Reign, 6. \"I think if you really love somebody, right, you want them to be happy no matter what,\" Scott expressed during the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' reunion. \"So, I do give her a blessing to be happy.\n\n(With Agency Inputs)"
