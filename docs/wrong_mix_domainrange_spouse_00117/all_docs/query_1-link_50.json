        "text": "EminemMusic is the official YouTube channel of EMINƎM. Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III (b. October 17, 1972 (1972-10-17) [age 51]), better known by his stage name Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM) or his alter-ego known as Slim Shady, is an American rapper, songwriter, producer, and actor.\n\nOverview[]\n\nHe released his debut album Infinite in 1996 and Slim Shady EP in 1997. However, he didn't achieve mainstream popularity until 1999, with his 2nd studio album The Slim Shady LP under Aftermath, which earned Eminem his first Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. His next two albums, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002) were worldwide successes, both winning Best Rap Album Grammy Awards.[1][2]\n\nHis fifth album, 2004's Encore was also a success. After touring in 2005, Eminem went on a hiatus. In 2009, he released his sixth album Relapse and in 2010, Recovery, which was 2010's best-selling album in the US and worldwide. Eminem's eighth album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was released in 2013 and it won the Best Rap Album Grammy Award. His ninth album Revival was released in 2017. On August 31, 2018, he released Kamikaze, his tenth album, which the album cover referencing the classic 1986 Beastie Boys album Licensed to Ill. On January 16, 2020, he released his eleventh album Music To Be Murdered By.[3]\n\nEminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)\". He has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits (2005), \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\n\nHe has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2002, Eminem starred in the musical drama film 8 Mile, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"Lose Yourself\", becoming the first rapper to ever win an Oscar. He was also a member of bands Soul Intent, D12 and duo Bad Meets Evil.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nIn high school, Eminem met Kimberly Anne \"Kim\" Scott while standing on a table with his shirt off rapping \"I'm Bad\" by LL Cool J. Kim and her twin sister Dawn moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15. In 1989, he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim. On Christmas Day 1995, their daughter Hailie Jade was born. In 1999, the couple were married and in 2001, they divorced. Eminem remarried Kim in January 2006, but he filed for divorce in early April. In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Scott had renewed their romantic relationship; however, in the same statement, his representative also confirmed that they now maintain a friendly relationship.\n\nTheir daughter, Hailie, is a social media influencer, specifically for fashion and beauty. She and her childhood friend Brittany Ednie had podcast called \"Just a little shady\". She married her long-term partner Evan McClintock on May 20, 2024.\n\nEminem legally adopted and was given custody of his ex-sister-in-law Dawn Scott's daughter Alaina Marie (by. 1993), as well as Kim Scott's child from other relationship, Stevie Laine (b. 2002). He also raised his younger half-brother Nathan (b. 1986).\n\nHealth Problems[]\n\nEminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium. According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002. During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount ... I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30.\" The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg) and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me — it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad.\" Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat\".\n\nIn December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose. He had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Hailie, Alaina and Stevie, Eminem checked himself out of the facility, weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program that emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him. Eminem has been sober since April 20, 2008.\n\nFaith and beliefs[]\n\nEminem is a Christian, and has rapped about his faith in a few songs, including on the remix to \"Use This Gospel\".[4]\n\nInterests[]\n\nEminem is a fan of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Pistons. He is also an avid comic book collector. His collection includes Amazing Fantasy #15, which is the comic book that introduces Spider-Man. The comic is worth over $1 million. A former Shady Records executive referred to his collection as \"otherworldly\".[5][6][7]\n\nThreats[]\n\nIn April 2020, Matthew David Hughes, a 26-year-old homeless man, broke into Eminem's house in Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan, breaking a kitchen window with a brick paver. Eminem woke up with Hughes standing behind him and he said that he was there to kill him. In a plea agreement in 2021, Hughes pleaded guilty to second-degree home invasion in exchange for dismissal of other charges; he was sentenced to probation and time served (524 days in the county jail). In 2019, Hughes had pleaded guilty to breaking into a Rochester Hills home in search of Eminem.\n\nOn August 30, 2023, it was revealed that the perpetrator of the 2023 Jacksonville shooting Ryan Palmeter targeted Eminem and Machine Gun Kelly as his victims in a racially-motivated attack.[8]\n\nPolitics[]\n\nIn multiple songs, Eminem has expressed political views that align with the Democratic Party; however, he has refrained from direct endorsements of politicians, focusing more on criticisms instead. The first was \"Mosh\", which was released in 2004, a few weeks before the 2004 United States presidential election, and heavily criticized then-president George W. Bush but did not directly endorse John Kerry either.[9] Eminem would not express political views again until the 2016 United States presidential election when he released \"Campaign Speech\", which criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump.[10] The following year, Eminem criticized Trump in a freestyle titled \"The Storm\". In the freestyle, Eminem expressed support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and the U.S. national anthem protests, and expressed his displeasure for any of his fans that support Trump.[11] In his song \"Darkness\", Eminem heavily references the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting, and at the end of the music video expresses his support for gun control.[12] The week before the 2020 United States presidential election, Eminem approved his song \"Lose Yourself\" to be used in a campaign video for Joe Biden.[13][14] After the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Eminem posted a tweet to his Twitter expressing his displeasure for the decision saying \"As a father it pisses me off that women have fewer rights 2day than just a few days ago… we r fuckin goin bckwards. Here's how 2 help in Michigan.[sic]\" and included a link to a pro-choice organization in Michigan.[15] In 2023, he requested that Republican election candidate Vivek Ramaswamy stop rapping his song \"Lose Yourself\" at campaign rallies, sending Ramaswamy a cease and desist letter.[16]\n\nFeud with Machine Gun Kelly[]\n\nEminem and rapper Machine Gun Kelly have had an ongoing feud for several years, and Kelly released a diss track in response to \"Not Alike\" titled \"Rap Devil\" in September 2018; both songs were produced by Ronny J. Kelly continued the feud at a concert, calling it \"a battle between the past and the fucking future\". The song's title refers to Eminem's \"Rap God\" and Eminem went into the studio days later to record his own response, as did former D12 associate Bizarre.[17] Eminem responded with \"Killshot\" on September 14 and Bizarre's \"Love Tap\" was released on September 20. \"Killshot\" garnered 38.1 million streams on YouTube in its first 24 hours and over 80 million views in its first week, making it the most successful debut for a hip hop song and the third-biggest debut in the platform's history. The track also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Eminem's 20th top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Kelly has continued the feud publicly.[18][19]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe has influenced a number of artists, including The Weeknd, Tech N9ne, Lil Wayne, Hopsin, Logic, J. Cole, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar, 50 Cent, Royce da 5'9\", Machine Gun Kelly, Ed Sheeran, Usher, Tyler, the Creator, Chance the Rapper and more.\n\nRappers 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, David Banner, Drake, Kool G. Rap, Redman, Kurupt, Wiz Khalifa, Talib Kweli, Machine Gun Kelly, N.O.R.E., Royce da 5'9\", Rakim, Busta Rhymes, Nick Cannon, Jay-Z and Yelawolf have each called Eminem one of the greatest rappers of all time.\n\nDiscography & Studio Albums[]\n\nStudio albums[]\n\nInfinite (1996)\n\nThe Slim Shady LP (1999)\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP (2000)\n\nThe Eminem Show (2002)\n\nEncore (2004)\n\nRelapse (2009)\n\nRecovery (2010)\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)\n\nRevival (2017)\n\nKamikaze (2018)\n\nMusic to Be Murdered By (2020)\n\nThe Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) (2024)\n\nCompilation Albums[]\n\nCurtain Call: The Hits (2005)\n\nCurtain Call 2 (2022)\n\nExtended Plays[]\n\nSlim Shady EP (1997)\n\nMixtapes[]\n\nFuckin Yzarc (2000)\n\nThe Freestyle Show (2002)\n\nStraight From The Lab (2003)\n\nThe Singles (2003)\n\nThe Freestyle Manual (2006)\n\nShady Classics: The Mixtape (2014)\n\nSoundtrack albums[]\n\n8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture (as Shady Records) (2002)\n\nSouthpaw: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture (2015)\n\nReissued albums[]\n\nRelapse: Refill (2009)\n\nMusic to Be Murdered By – Side B (2020)\n\nBox sets[]\n\nƎ (The Singles) (2004)\n\nThe Vinyl LPs (2015)\n\nEminem x Fortnite Radio (2023)\n\nCollaborative albums, EP's and mixtapes[]\n\nEP's[]\n\nSoul Intent EP (with Soul Intent) (1995)\n\nThe Underground E.P.
