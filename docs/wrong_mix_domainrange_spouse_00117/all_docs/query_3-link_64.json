        "text": "Lil Nas X has another unexpected collaboration in the works with none other than Travis Barker.\n\nIn an interview SPIN published yesterday (June 12), Barker opened up about his own creative process while working with rappers like 03 Greedo. Later on, the Blink-182 drummer revealed that he says will appear on the forthcoming 7 EP.\n\n“I have a song with Lil Nas X that’s going to be on his EP,” Barker shares. “He came to the studio, and I played a couple [of] beats that I thought would be stuff he was into. Then I played something on accident where he stopped and was like, ‘What is that? I’ve got to have that.’ It was actually an idea I had for the blink album.”\n\nSince his song began its climb to the top of the Billboard charts, Nas X has enticed the masses with his high-profile collaboration with Billy Ray Cyrus for the \"Old Town Road\" remix. When his project drops, there's a chance we'll hear even more dope collabs between Lil Nas X and other artists.\n\n“'7' the EP! next month,\" Lil Nas X tweeted on May 18.\n\nAside from the vague announcement about his EP, the Atlanta native doesn't offer up any other details about the project. Nas X has been spotted with a handful of major artists recently like Tory Lanez, Usher, YBN Cordae and more. However, the only confirmed guest so far is Barker.\n\nLater on in his interview, the veteran drummer also reveals that he's been working on a rock-based album with Trippie Redd."
