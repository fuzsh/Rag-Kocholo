        "text": "In the song \"Pain = BESTFRIEND (feat. Travis Barker)\", XXXTENTACION delves into the complex relationship between pain and personal growth. The lyrics reflect a deep sense of introspection and emotional turmoil, as the artist grapples with feelings of regret and the inescapable presence of pain. The repetition of being \"lost in the good\" suggests a struggle to find solace or happiness, indicating that even positive experiences are overshadowed by an underlying sense of sorrow. This duality is a recurring theme in XXXTENTACION's music, where he often explores the darker aspects of the human psyche.\n\nThe chorus, which addresses children directly, serves as a poignant reminder of the inevitability of pain. By stating that \"pain will always be my friend,\" XXXTENTACION personifies pain, suggesting that it is a constant and familiar presence in his life. This personification can be interpreted as a coping mechanism, where accepting pain as a companion rather than an adversary allows for a form of emotional resilience. The advice to children not to cry implies a message of strength and endurance, encouraging listeners to accept and coexist with their pain rather than be overwhelmed by it.\n\nTravis Barker's involvement in the song adds a layer of intensity and raw emotion, complementing XXXTENTACION's introspective lyrics. Barker's drumming style, known for its energy and precision, amplifies the song's emotional weight, creating a powerful auditory experience. The collaboration between the two artists highlights the fusion of different musical influences, blending elements of hip-hop, punk, and emo to convey a universal message about the human condition. Through this song, XXXTENTACION invites listeners to reflect on their own relationship with pain and consider how it shapes their identity and experiences."
