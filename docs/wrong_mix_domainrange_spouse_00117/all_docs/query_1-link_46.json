        "text": "March 15, 2024 (Los Angeles, CA) — Flexing his range once again, Alabama-born and Nashville-based multiplatinum chart-topping artist, entrepreneur, and Slumerican Founder Yelawolf shares a new single and music video entitled “Make You Love Me” out today.\n\nListen HERE and watch the video HERE via Slumerican.\n\nOn the track produced by frequent collaborator and GRAMMY® Award winner Malay [Frank Ocean, Alicia Keys], a smoky bass line thumps beneath a hummable vocal harmony. Meanwhile, he leans into a dreamy cadence as he sings, “I’m just a lonely pillar holding up an empty building.” The melodies cut deep until he picks up the pace on the bridge with rapid fire bars punctuated by a proclamation, “You’re pretty enough to make a crook admit it, but I am a poet, upfront, no edit.”\n\nThis complicated romance plays out on-screen in the accompanying captivating visual directed by Patrick Tohill. Nodding to Prohibition-era flicks like Public Enemies with a fashion sense straight out of Peaky Blinders, it finds Yelawolf in an intense exchange with a mysterious woman. He sips whiskey in a sprawling southern estate only to meet an unexpected fate shortly thereafter.\n\nAbout the song, he said, “It became about what I was going through and had been through in relationships. I’m giving everything I have just to make you want me. This suffering happens to a lot of people.”\n\nBootleg Kev personally gave the song its broadcast premiere on his syndicated radio show, and Yelawolf sat down with him for a deep interview.\n\nIn February, Yelawolf kickstarted the current season with the hard-hitting “Everything.” The latter has already gathered north of 1.5 million YouTube views on the music video in addition to 495K Spotify streams. Earning acclaim, HotNewHipHop raved, “Yelawolf is as hungry as ever on new lead single ‘Everything’,” and HipHopDX promised, “Yelawolf is back with a vengeance.”\n\nLast fall, he initially teased this chapter during an intimate secret listening session. SPIN professed, “One thing is immediately clear—Yelawolf never abandoned his hip-hop roots. The culture is part of his DNA, pumping through his veins and busting at the seams to get out.”\n\nThe stage is set for his much-anticipated magnum opus double-LP War Story coming very soon.\n\nYelawolf is prepared for war in 2024…\n\nMore About Yelawolf"
