        "text": "HOLLYWOOD — It took a brush with disaster to get the members of the multi-platinum-selling pop punk trio Blink-182 to stop giving each other the cold shoulder after a four-year “hiatus” as a band. Specifically, it took drummer Travis Barker nearly dying in September in a plane crash — which claimed the lives of his assistant and bodyguard — to make the group’s singer-guitarist Tom DeLonge re-evaluate his priorities and break the radio silence toward his bandmates.\n\n“We started talking again after Travis’ accident,” DeLonge asserts with uncharacteristic somberness.\n\nThe co-frontman is seated in a backstage dressing room before the band’s performance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” last month. His mouth trembles with emotion before he lapses back into his default goofball mode.\n\n“There was some hate before then,” he blurts out. “Don’t make me cry!”\n\nBut rekindling the bromance that propelled Blink’s potty-mouthed popularity as one of Southern California’s unlikeliest arena rock acts required that DeLonge, Barker and bassist-vocalist Mark Hoppus put aside their differences and come together as creative equals.\n\n“We had to be friends before we could be in a band again,” Barker says.\n\nHoppus, 37, recalls the moment of satori that would result in Blink’s resurrection.\n\n“We were sitting in the courtyard of our studio one day,” he says. “We had been hanging out for about eight weeks or something, just as friends. And it was like there was a giant elephant in the room. “… Tom asked me and Travis, ‘Where is this going? Are we going to do this thing?’ Blink was obviously such a huge thing in our lives. We realized we wanted to continue doing it.”\n\nHe adds: “Not only with a sense of what we brought to the table but an appreciation for what everyone else brought.”\n\nNow, San Diego’s punk princes — who have sold some 13 million albums domestically — are mounting a 50-date North American comeback tour which comes to Shoreline Amphitheatre on Sunday. They are the marquee act on a bill that features a rotating lineup of openers that includes the Weezer (on the Shoreline bill), All-American Rejects, Fall Out Boy and Asher Roth. Blink will play the biggest stadiums and perform for the biggest audiences of its career.\n\nHoppus marvels at how far the group has come.\n\n“We started playing in small punk-rock clubs, touring in a van,” he says. “None of us had any aspirations beyond playing the music we loved and having a good time. Next thing you know, we’ve sold millions of records. And the pressure was gigantic.”\n\nTo hear them tell it, that’s why in 2005, at the height of Blink’s popularity, the trio’s interpersonal discontent boiled over, prompting a career timeout.\n\nOn hiatus, DeLonge put together his successful alt-rock outfit Angels & Airwaves; Hoppus and Barker formed the electronic rock act +44; and Barker became an in-demand hip-hop drummer for top-selling rappers including Eminem, Lil Wayne and Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em while also producing a solo album he still hopes to release in coming months.\n\n“It was never a thing where I didn’t want to be in a band with nobody or something,” Barker, 33, explains. “In our band, it just got kind of crazy. We took a break.”\n\nAfter Barker’s plane crash — which everyone carefully avoids discussing, because the drummer is suing a company that owns the Learjet on which he crashed — the course of action seemed obvious for DeLonge. His reticence is generally credited with having prevented the band from re-forming sooner.\n\n“When you see opportunities in your life, you’ve got to analyze, ‘Why was that choice given to me?’ ” DeLonge, 33, says. “It was very clear to me after Travis’ thing that all these forces of nature were pushing for (a reunion) to happen.”\n\nStill, moments before what was to be Blink’s fourth public post-hiatus performance, the bandmates try to laugh off a palpable sense of performance anxiety. DeLonge was busy re-memorizing the Blink song lyrics he had written down on a yellow legal pad.\n\n“Here’s how wheels-off this organization is: We’re about to walk out onstage tonight in front of a national audience and perform songs we haven’t played in seven years,” Hoppus says.\n\n“Not to mention, I can’t actually remember all the guitar parts,” DeLonge says. “It’s all a blur to me.”\n\nBut when they hit the stage, Blink performed energetic run-throughs of two of its biggest Warped Tour hits, “What’s My Age Again?” and “Dammit,” for Kimmel’s cameras. Then, glancing at each other from across the stage with barely contained class-clown glee, the band members decided they were having too much fun to leave.\n\n“I love you, Tra-vis,” Hoppus drawls into the mike, prompting DeLonge to elucidate for the crowd: “It’s a physical thing.”\n\n“And I love you, Tom De-Long-ee,” Hoppus continues, just before the trio launched into its single “Down.”\n\nWith Fall Out Boy’s Pete Wentz and wife Ashlee Simpson looking on from backstage, flanked by a gaggle of Blink’s preteen children sitting on an overstuffed sofa, the group performs eight songs (not including an off-the-cuff cover of the Beastie Boys’ “High Plains Drifter”) over the course of an hour.\n\nWith all of Hoppus and DeLonge’s sexual double-entendres and frat boy repartee, the mini-concert seems more like a declaration of purpose than a tour warm-up. The implicit message is that Blink-182 is back and as solid as ever — that its tour isn’t going to be some kind of profit-driven road slog even if it represents one of Blink’s biggest paydays to date.\n\n“This isn’t a reunion tour,” Hoppus insists. “That has the stigma of a band that’s riding on its own coattails. “… This is a continuation for us. We want to make an album, do what we love and continue where we left off.”"
