        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – Whether you’re a fan or not, there’s no denying Machine Gun Kelly has amassed a diverse catalog. Between numerous mixtapes, the first part of his career focused on hip-hop and rap rock, and his chart-topping pop-punk run, there’s something to be said for having such a resume in your early 30s.\n\nThat’s what this list is about – looking back on MGK’s journey from upstart rapper spitting rapid rhymes to one of the biggest rock stars in the world. To be clear, we did not rank every Machine Gun Kelly song.\n\nThis list focuses on his six studio albums. No mixtape cuts, non-album singles and remixes, soundtrack and EP songs, or bonus tracks featured on deluxe album reissues. We also excluded interludes and skits (Sorry, Pete Davidson).\n\nGranted, that left some pretty awesome stuff on the cutting room floor, including mixtape standout “Breaking News” and a fun collaboration like “Home” with X Ambassadors and Bebe Rexha. It also means no “Rap Devil,” the Eminem diss track that’s a top-five MGK song by every measure.\n\nLook, this dude has A LOT of songs. We had to establish boundaries. That left us with 79 studio album tracks to rank. As always, this is just one person’s opinion. No follower of the EST movement’s list will be the same.\n\n79. “Can’t Walk” (Bloom, 2017)\n\n78. “Wake + Bake” (Bloom, 2017)\n\nAs previously stated, this is a matter of personal preference. Surely, there’s someone out there reading this and losing their mind over “Wake + Bake” being ranked this low. But I do not get high. Just not my thing, making it hard for me to get into either of these two bottom-placed songs. Consider them the “least good” on a technicality if you must.\n\n77. “Runnin” (feat. Planet VI) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n76. “Stereo” (feat. Alex Fitts) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n75. “All We Have” (feat. Anna Yvette) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\nThere were some slight growing pains on Machine Gun Kelly’s first album “Lace Up.” Mainly, the production didn’t always suit him. The drum-happy vibes of “Stereo” feel like a better fit for Twenty One Pilots than MGK, while the generic beat and chorus on “All We Have” takes away from Kellz’s revealing lyrics. Then there’s the over-produced “Planet VI,” where there’s simply too much going on.\n\n74. “WW4″ (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n73. “Ay!” with Lil Wayne (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n72. “Eddie Cane” (General Admission, 2015)\n\nA quick bit of trivia: The intro on “Eddie Cane” (the title is a reference to a character from “The Five Heartbeats”) comes from Maceo “Chase” Moore, a Cleveland drug trafficker who was sentenced to more than 17 years in federal prison. Indeed, “General Admission” is a Cleveland album through and through. Still, “Eddie Cane” lumbers along, never quite making the impact some of the better tracks from the album do.\n\n71. “Die in California” (feat. Gunna, Young Thug and Landon Barker) (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n70. “Sid & Nancy” (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n69. “Mainstream Sellout” (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\nThe fallout from “Tickets to My Downfall” saw Machine Gun Kelly gaining even more haters disapproving to him jumping into pop punk. Unfortunately, he listened to them. Much of “Mainstream Sellout” is a clap back at his critics. Understandable, but it sucks some of the fun out of things.\n\n68. “World Series” (General Admission, 2015)\n\n67. “Kiss the Sky” (Bloom, 2017)\n\n66. “A Little More” (feat. Victoria Monet) (General Admission, 2015)\n\n65. “Drug Dealer” (feat. Lil Wayne) (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\nA collaboration with Lil Wayne would have been a nice treat during the hip-hop portion of MGK’s career. It still kind of works on “Drug Dealer” from “Mainstream Sellout” mostly because Kellz and Wayne’s charisma offsets a chorus that never really takes off.\n\n64. “Go for Broke” (feat. James Arthur) (Bloom, 2017)\n\n63. “Fake Love Don’t Last” (with Iann Dior) (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n62. “At My Best” (feat. Hailee Steinfeld) (Bloom, 2017)\n\n61. “Wild Boy” (feat. Waka Flocka Flame) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\nThe first single from Machine Gun Kelly’s first album positions him to get in on a mainstream hip-hop landscape circling around trap, crunk and drill music at the time. “Wild Boy” hit the mark on the charts, even if it hasn’t aged well from a pop culture standpoint. The Steve-O shoutouts on the chorus are a bit comical and Waka Flocka’s bars -- “S**k my dragon b***s, call me Goku) -- can be cringeworthy at times. MGK would get better from here.\n\n60. “What I Do” (feat. Bun B and Dub-O) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n59. “Lace Up” (feat. Lil Jon) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n58. “Make Up Sex” (with Blackbear) (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n57. “End of the Road” (feat. Blackbear) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\nMachine Gun Kelly and blackbear have collaborated on tracks before and after “My Ex’s Best Friend.” And yet, everything they’ve ever done or will do will be compared to that monster hit, which is still to come on this list.\n\n56. “Bad Mother F***er” feat. Kid Rock (General Admission, 2015)\n\nIt was probably inevitable we were going to get a collaboration between Machine Gun Kelly and Kid Rock. The latter provides a nice chorus. But it’s Kellz who outshines one of his idols, copying New Orleans rap legend Juvenile’s flow at the end of the first verse like it was second nature.\n\n55. “WWIII” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\n54. “Merry Go Round” (General Admission, 2015)\n\n53. “Nothing Inside” (feat. Iann Dior) (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\n52. “Edge of Destruction” (feat. Tech N9ne and Twista) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n“Edge of Destruction” feels like a contest of who can rap the fastest from three rapid-fire rhymers (It’s Twista for the win). The crazy part is, that they could have gone even faster over a better beat. Still, the technical skill showcased on this cut from “Lace Up” is something to marvel at.\n\n51. “Papercuts” (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n50. “Jawbreaker” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\n49. “Save Me” (feat. M. Shadows and Synyster Gates) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n“Save Me” is a great reference point for anyone who wants to hate on Machine Gun Kelly for “switching” to rock music. It’s telling the first track from his first studio album features members of Avenge Sevenfold with driving guitars. Rock was always part of his music.\n\n48. “Sex Drive” (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n47. “Moonwalkers” (feat. DubXX) (Bloom, 2017)\n\n46. “Everyday” (General Admission, 2015)\n\n45. “Rehab” (Bloom, 2017)\n\n44. “Play This When I’m Gone” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\n43. “Oz.” (General Admission, 2015)\n\n42. “See My Tears” (Lace Up, 2012)\n\n41. “Maybe” with Bring Me the Horizon (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n“Maybe” might be generic pop-punk -- the guitar part on the chorus sounds almost identical to that of Paramore’s “Misery Business -- but Bring Me the Horizon frontman Oliver Sykes’ voice serves as a great change of pace. He gives the song energy that separates it from the other material on “Mainstream Sellout.”\n\n40. “The Gunner” (Bloom, 2017)\n\n39. “Roulette” (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n38. “Twin Flame” (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\nMGK’s Dashboard Confessional moment. “Twin Flame” is what you typically get when a pop-punk or hardcore band goes acoustic. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe you’re tired of the Machine Gun Kelly-Megan Fox love saga. But you can’t blame a guy for wearing his heart on his sleeve on a song where the explosive second half soars.\n\n37. “Lonely” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\n36. “Waste Love” (feat. Madison Love) (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n35. “5150″ (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n34. “Spotlight” (feat. Lzzy Hale) (General Admission, 2015)\n\n33. “5:3666″ (feat. Phem) (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n32. “God Save Me” (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\nFans will recognize the lyrics in “God Save Me” as the infamous incident mentioned in Machine Gun Kelly’s Hulu documentary where he put a shotgun in his mouth and attempted to pull the trigger. “God Save Me” takes things to the extreme with the relatable feeling of feeling lost but hoping for a divine intervention front and center.\n\n31. “Gone” (feat. Leroy Sanchez) (General Admission, 2015)\n\n30. “Title Track” (Tickets to My Download, 2020)\n\n29. “Golden God” (Bloom, 2017)\n\n28. “Floor 13″ (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n27. “Born with Horns” (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\n“Born with Horns” was the original title for Machine Gun Kelly’s sixth studio album and it’s easy to see why. It truly carries over the pop-punk energy from “Tickets to My Downfall.” It’s a blazing opener with Travis Barker’s terrific drumming as the highlight.\n\n26. “D3MONS” (feat. DMX) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\nFor hip-hop heads, this is a dream collaboration. Even past his prime, DMX’s growl was still capable of giving you chills. The darkness of Dame Grease and Snaz’s production suits Machine Gun Kelly as well. You can feel Kellz elevating his skills to perform on a track with a legend.\n\n25. “Let You Go” (Bloom, 2017)\n\n24. “Invincible” (feat. Ester Dean) (Lace Up, 2012)\n\nAlex da Kid has a very distinct production style that lends itself to very emotional verses followed by a soaring chorus. He is the man behind “Airplanes,” “Love the Way You Lie” and “I Need a Doctor.” Throughout “Lace Up,” MGK is seeking to nail that mix of meaningful music with pop sensibility and he comes closest here. The production is heavy-handed, but it works, primarily because of the intensity in Kellz’s voice and the power of Ester Dean’s powerful voice.\n\n23. “Emo Girl” (with Willow) (Mainstream Sellout, 2022)\n\nIt’s easy to hate “Emo Girl,” a track that produced memes almost immediately. But there’s no denying its catchiness and the fact guest star Willow kills it. “Emo Girl” is one of the standout moments from “Mainstream Sellout” that can rival some of the best songs from “Tickets to My Downfall.”\n\n22. “Death in My Pocket” (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n“Death in My Pocket” may feature the best lyrical opening of any Machine Gun Kelly song: “Don’t know, why but it feels like my world is crashing down/I just bought a brand new car, I want to crash it now/How much darkness did it take to get this flashy now?” Kellz brought his hip-hop A-game to his fourth album.\n\n21. Concert for Aliens” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\nSeveral of the songs on “Tickets to My Downfall” sound like Blink-182 tunes. This makes sense considering A) the album was produced by Travis Barker and B) It can be pretty hard to write a pop-punk song that doesn’t sound like Blink-182. To say the fun and bouncy “Concert for Aliens” is one of the best Blink songs that Blink never wrote is a compliment of the highest order.\n\n20. “Alpha Omega” (General Admission, 2015)\n\nIf you needed to explain Machine Gun Kelly to someone who has never heard of him, “Alpha Omega” may be the song. MGK’s flow rides over an epic beat, providing for one of his finest hours as a lyricist: “What’s your religion?/I wanna know what God you’re seeing in a couple of seconds/I wanna see the criticism ‘bout my lyricism/When I’m in your face rippin’ this rhythm up like cannibalism, it’s Kells!”\n\n19. “Drunk Face” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\n18. “Burning Memories” (feat. Lil Skies) (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n17. “Trap Paris” (feat. Quavo and Ty Dolla $ign) (Bloom, 2017)\n\n16. “All I Know” feat. (Trippie Redd) (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\nDiehard punk fans may roll their eyes at Machine Gun Kelly (with Trippie Red) paying homage to Operation Ivy’s classic “Knowledge.” But it’s part of the first half of “Tickets to My Downfall” that can do no wrong.\n\n15. “All Night Long” (General Admission, 2015)\n\nThe closing track from “General Admission” is also one of the longest tracks of Kellz’s career. The beat is simple enough and the piano melody is catchy. But where the song reaches legendary status is when the MGK sits back and narrates the story of how he got his record deal. It’s an insight into everything he’s gone through to make it to the top. Even at seven minutes, you still want more.\n\n14. “On My Way” (Lace Up, 2012)\n\nIt’s not the obvious choice for the best song on Machine Gun Kelly’s debut “Lace Up.” But “On My Way” is a special track. MGK spends much of it talking about the early days before looking to the future. “We too grounded to be Hollywood, man,” he proclaims before spitting a verse that incorporates numerous film titles. Never question this dude’s lyricism.\n\n13. “El Diablo” (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\n“Tell all my competition that I love ‘em/But I brought ‘em back just to kill ‘em again...” Yep, “El Diablo” is the Machine Gun Kelly song sure to give you that “ick” face. The filthy beat and MGK’s lyrics are pure fire, especially when he points out he was one of the first rappers to put on a rock show but doesn’t get credit for it.\n\n12. “Kiss Kiss” (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\nThe first half of “Tickets to My Downfall” is pretty much all killer, no filler, loaded with songs like “Kiss Kiss” that sound like they could have ranked among the best pop-punk songs from the genre’s 21st century glory days. For anyone who thought MGK doing pop-punk might not work, “Kiss Kiss” proved them wrong.\n\n11. “Candy” (feat. Trippie Redd) (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\nIt was the video for “Candy,” which featured Machine Gun Kelly and Pete Davidson going around doing all sorts of wild things, that made MGK’s label call him and ask WTF was going on. It’s a fun antidote to one of the catchiest songs on “Hotel Diablo,” a track that showcases the undeniable chemistry between Kellz and guest Trippie Redd.\n\n10. “Forget Me Too” (feat. Halsey) (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\nPart of the reason “Tickets to My Downfall” was well received is its ability to conjure up 2000s pop-punk nostalgia fans left at the Warped Tour. Perhaps no track does that more than “Forget Me Too,” Machine Gun Kelly’s duet with Halsey. The song revolves around a huge chorus. And, with all due respect to MGK, Halsey steals the show. Seriously, when is her pop-punk album coming out?\n\n9. “Bad Things” (with Camila Cabello) (Bloom, 2017)\n\nThe success of “Bad Things” was a double-edged sword. People didn’t want to stop talking about it or (worse) attributed its success to pop star Camila Cabello’s presence and the sample of Fastball’s 1999 single “Out of My Head.” Those things were tremendous factors, no doubt. But the best part of “Bad Thing” is all MGK: “I want you forever/Even when we’re not together/ Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like/I want you forever...” That’s the hook that kept people coming back time and time again, making it a top-five hit on the pop charts.\n\n8. “Story of the Stairs” (General Admission, 2015)\n\nWhen the tracklist for “General Admission” was revealed, “Story of Stairs” stood out for its intriguing title alone. And it didn’t disappoint. The song tells the story of MGK’s mother leaving him and his attempt to reconnect with her, as well as other struggles such as his girlfriend cheating on him and his battles with his dad. It’s the biggest tearjerker on “General Admission” and a true showcase of Kellz’s storytelling and artistry.\n\n7. “Hollywood Whore” (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\nNever say Machine Gun Kelly can’t write a diss track, whether he’s aiming at a rap legend or -- in the case of “Hollywood Whore” -- exposing someone who ripped him off. “Hollywood Whore” finds MGK going into hard rock mode. The first single from “Hotel Diablo” wasn’t a huge hit. But ask any true fan and they’ll tell you the Linkin Park-influenced “Hollywood Whore” is a monster of a song.\n\n6. “My Ex’s Best Friend”(feat. Blackbear) (Tickets to My Downfall, 2020)\n\nAs Machine Gun Kelly says sometimes at his concerts, “And now for a song no one has ever heard...” Indeed, EVERYONE has heard “My Ex’s Best Friend,” the biggest hit of Machine Gun Kelly’s career. And it deserves all the streams and accolades. A stellar collaboration with Blackbear, “My Ex’s Best Friend” is the finest showcase of Machine Gun Kelly being able to craft an enduring pop hit with ease.\n\n5. “Glass House” (feat. Naomi Wild) (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\nMGK has a way of bleeding all over his most emotional tracks. There isn’t a side of him you’re not allowed to see. That’s never more apparent than on “Glass House,” a haunting single where Machine Gun Kelly pulls no punches about lost friends and internal struggles. The stunning chorus from Naomi Wild paves the way for a jaw-dropping final verse where MGK reveals a suicide attempt (“I didn’t sign up to be a hero/but I don’t wanna wind up a villain”).\n\n4. “Till I Die” (General Admission, 2015)\n\n“One time for the city...My city” It’s a bold move for a major artist to make the lead single from his sophomore album an anthem about Cleveland. On the single version of “Till I Die,” Kellz admits there were people who told him it was career suicide. But he proved them wrong. You know “Till I Die” is special right from the epic opening chords from production team J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League. The combination of the incredible beat and MGK’s swagger represents a Cleveland musical moment. This is a hometown anthem that isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n3. “Bloody Valentine” (Tickets to My Download, 2020)\n\nIt can be hard to pinpoint the exact moment someone became a superstar. But “My Bloody Valentine” may very well be it for Machine Gun Kelly. It was the perfect storm. Between the driving, earworm of a chorus (“In my head, in my head...”), his relationship with actress Megan Fox and the fun video featuring her, Machine Gun Kelly had reached a new level.\n\n2. “I Think I’m Okay” (with Yungblud and Travis Barker) (Hotel Diablo, 2019)\n\nAnd so it begins...The official start of MGK’s pop-punk run takes place on the final track of “Hotel Diablo.” At the time, it felt like a weird choice of a song, let alone a single. In retrospect, “I Think I’m Okay” -- with Travis Barker on drums and pop-punk torch bearer Yungblud’s passionate screams – was the perfect introduction to MGK’s new direction that would take him to stadium status.\n\n1. “27″ (Bloom, 2017)"
