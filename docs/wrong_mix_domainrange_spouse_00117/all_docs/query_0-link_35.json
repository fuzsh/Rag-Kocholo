        "text": "Scott Disick had a few words for Kourtney Kardashian after catching wind of her being too affectionate with her hubby in front of their children.\n\nAccording to reports, media personality Scott Disick spoke to his ex Kourtney Kardashian, 44, and told her to refrain from PDA with her husband Travis Barker, 48, when his children are present.\n\nIf you didn’t know, the Kardashian star and Travis Barker — who wed in 2022 and share a baby boy — aren’t afraid to show off their intimacy in public settings.\n\nReportedly, an insider claimed that Scott Disick, 40, recently spoke out against his ex having intimate moments with the Blink-182 drummer around the kids she shares with him. They said,\n\n“Scott takes being a dad seriously and wants what’s best for the kids. He’s put his foot down on more and more issues lately – including asking Kourtney to tone down the PDA with Travis in front of their children.”\n\nScott and Kourtney dated on-and-off from 2006 to 2015 and share three children; Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9.\n\nScott Disick’s alleged feelings appear to come after his former girlfriend and Travis Barker were slammed for turning their backs on Kourtney Kardashian’s daughter, Penelope, to kiss at a concert back in February.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Scott Disick’s remarks?
