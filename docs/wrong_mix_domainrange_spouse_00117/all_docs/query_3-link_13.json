But there are too many things going on in this rendition of \"Forever,\" and though Eminem slam-dunks his double-timed raps, the sound keeps dropping on CBS's broadcast, so I can hear only half of the song. I have no idea what Drake is doing. I hope Lil Wayne is having fun; the rapper will report to prison on Feb. 9 for what will likely be a one-year sentence related to gun charges.\n\nGrade: C- for the performance; F for the CBS live feed"
