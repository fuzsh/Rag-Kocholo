        "text": "Starting his career playing drums for the ska group The Aquabats in the early 1990s, Travis Barker had his breakthrough a few years later when he replaced drummer Scott Raynor in Blink-182.\n\nThough Blink-182 remains the core for Barker, who has also co-written the band’s “I Miss You,” “First Date,” “Bored to Death,” and more from the band’s third album, Enema of the State, through Nine in 2019, he has also collaborated with everyone from Rihanna, LL Cool J, Slash, Eminem, Lil Wayne, Tom Morello, Cypress Hill, Snoop Dogg, Run the Jewels, Slipknot, Avril Lavigne, and Soulja Boy, among others.\n\n[RELATED: Blink-182’s Tom DeLonge Mentioned During U.S. Congress Hearing Into Aliens]\n\nIn 2011 Barker even released his debut solo album, Give the Drummer Some, just three years after surviving a fatal plane accident, which killed four people and left the drummer with third-degree burns on more than half of his body.\n\nNearly a decade later, Barker started co-writing and producing outside projects, many on his label DTA, while continuing to play with Blink-182.\n\nHere’s a look at five songs the drummer has written, and in some cases also produced, for other artists in the 2020s.\n\n1. “My Ex’s Best Friend,” Machine Gun Kelly, featuring Blackbear (2020)\n\nWritten by Travis Barker, Machine Gun Kelly, Matthew Musto, Nicholas Alex Long\n\nA year prior to releasing his fifth album Tickets to My Downfall in 2020, Machine Gun Kelly collaborated with Barker and Yungblud on the track “I Think I’m Okay” on his fourth album, Hotel Diablo. Barker also co-produced and co-wrote a majority of the tracks on the latter album with Machine Gun Kelly, credited by his real name Colson Baker, along with playing drums on all the songs.\n\nThe drummer later reconnected to co-produce and co-write a number of tracks on Tickets to My Downfall, including “my ex’s best friend,” featuring Blackbear and also worked on Baker’s 2022 album Mainstream Sellout.\n\n“He’s one of my best friends,” said Machine Gun Kelly of Barker. “He’s a brother. Every single time we step in to work with each other, we come out with something better than what we had just done.”\n\nNow we’re in the back seat of the black car going home\n\nWhen she asked me, “Is it wrong if I come up with you?”\n\nWe’re both drunk on the elevator\n\nWhen I kissed you for the first time in New York City\n\nI swear to God, I never fall in love\n\nThen you showed up, and I can’t get enough of it\n\nI swear to God, I never fall in love\n\nI never fall in love, but I can’t get enough of it\n\n2. “Transparent Soul,” Willow (2021)\n\nWritten by Travis Barker, Willow Smith, and Tyler Cole\n\nIn 2015, Willow had already released her debut album, Ardipithecus, at the age of 15, and after years of touring with her mother Jada Pinkett-Smith’s rock band Wicked Wisdom from the age of 3 through 7. After picking up the guitar and writing during the pandemic, Smith started recording demos, which she later took to the studio for her fifth album, Lately I Feel Everything.\n\nReleased in 2021, the album included two tracks co-written by Barker, including “Grow,” featuring Avril Lavigne, and her indie-pop opener “Transparent Soul.”\n\nBarker also plays drums on the song, and is featured on a third track called ‘Gaslight.”\n\nTransparent soul\n\nI can see right through, just so you know\n\nTransparent soul\n\nI can see right through, just so you know\n\nI don’t fucking know if it’s paradise or it’s a trap\n\nYeah, they’re treating me like royalty, but is it kissin’ ass?\n\nNo one’s brave enough to take the fall right\n\nBut it’s all your fault\n\nWhy you actin’ like it’s alright?\n\n3. “Wanna Be,” jxdn, featuring Machine Gun Kelly (2021)\n\nWritten by Travis Barker, jxdn, Machine Gun Kelly, Aaron Jennings\n\nTikTok sensation jxdn (real name Jade Hossler) released his debut album, Tell Me About Tomorrow, on Barker’s DTA Records. Barker also co-produced and co-wrote a number of tracks with the Tennessee native, including the revelatory “Wanna Be,” which explores mental health.\n\n“Yo, I think I just found the first artist I’m going to sign to DTA Records,” Barker can be heard saying in the “Intro” of the album. “This kid’s next. His name is jxdn.”\n\nSedated, isolated\n\nLookin’ in the mirror and I hate it\n\nDepressed, I never say it\n\nFind me face down on the pavement\n\nMaybe, it’s all my fault\n\nThere’s no one I can call for help\n\nIt’s really gettin’ worse than I thought\n\nAnd I’m done (no prescription makes me better)\n\nI wanna be alright\n\nI wanna be okay\n\nI’m sick of the nightmares\n\nI’m sick of the bad days\n\nA different direction (a different direction)\n\nI’m headed the wrong way (I’m headed the wrong way)\n\nI wanna be alright (I wanna be alright)\n\nI wanna be okay (I wanna be okay)\n\n4. “Obvious,” Iann Dior (2022)\n\nWrittten by Travis Barker, Iann Dior, and Kevin Gruft\n\nOn to Better Things marked Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Iann Dior’s second album and helped elevate the young artist from his 2019 debut Industry Plant with a collection of producers and appearances by Machine Gun Kelly and Lil Uzi Vert.\n\nThe album made the top 40 (at No. 28) of the Billboard 200 and peaked at No. 2 on the Top Alternative Albums chart.\n\nCan’t be told what to do, don’t even give it a try\n\nI’m not the type to lose, walk with a tear in your eye\n\nWhen I walk in the room, know you feeling my presence\n\nShe don’t like how I move, leavin’ you was a blessing\n\nDidn’t wanna bring it up, but I feel it, it’s obvious\n\nIt’s hard to be around someone who never learned to love themself\n\nAlready learned my lesson, girl, you know that we’ve been here before\n\nWe’ve both been here before, don’t get too comfortable\n\n5. “F.U.” Avril Lavigne (2022)\n\nWritten by Travis Barker, Avril Lavigne, and Nick Long\n\nAfter playing drums on Avril Lavigne‘s 2007 album, The Best Damn Thing, Barker collaborated with her again 15 years later on her seventh release, Love Sux. Barker plays drums on most of the tracks, along with co-producing several songs on the album, and co-writing the punk-popped “F.U..”\n\nBlink-182 bandmate Mark Hoppus also appears on the album singing along with Lavigne on the song “All I Wanted.”\n\nI would tell you that I’m pissed\n\nBut I know you won’t hear me\n\nThere’s no point in talkin’ shit\n\nBut I’ll still say this clearly\n\nYou used to drive me crazy\n\nBut I don’t feel nothing lately\n\nAnd I think we’re done here, maybe\n\n6. “Neo Punk,” Iggy Pop (2023)\n\nWritten by Travis Barker, Iggy Pop, Andrew Watt, Josh Klinghoffer\n\nOn Iggy Pop‘s 19th album, Every Loser, Barker co-wrote the two-and-a-half minute harder core “Neo Punk.”\n\nEvery Loser also features contributions from Jane’s Addiction‘s Dave Navarro, Chris Chaney, and Eric Avery, Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, Pearl Jam’s Stone Gossard, and the late Taylor Hawkins.\n\nI’m a mini thug, I’m all jacked up on drugs\n\nI’m a Neo Punk\n\nEmotionally, I’m a celebrity\n\nI’m a Neo Punk\n\nI don’t have to sing, I got publishing\n\nI’m a Neo Punk\n\nI can puke and drool in your swimming pool\n\nI’m a Neo Punk (help)\n\nGot a custom Rolls-Royce, I’m a Neo Punk\n\nGot a spot on The Voice, I’m a Neo Punk\n\nOld ladies cum when I flash my junk\n\nI’m a hunky, Gucci model Neo Punk\n\nPhoto by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for SiriusXM"
