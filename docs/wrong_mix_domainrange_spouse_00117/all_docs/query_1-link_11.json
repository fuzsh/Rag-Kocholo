        "text": "Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian have made things official — or at least official adjacent.\n\nAccording to TMZ — who was first to report the news — the pair visited a wedding chapel in Las Vegas early Monday morning (April 4) and got hitched by an Elvis impersonator while in town for the Grammy Awards, where Barker performed just hours earlier with Lenny Kravitz and H.E.R.\n\nHowever, sources confirm to Billboard that while the pair did go to the chapel, they are not legally married. Rather, the ceremony was just for fun — and the photo opp — after a few drinks (the two have apparently joked about eloping in Vegas before). The couple does plan to get legally married this year, and as seen in previews for Hulu’s The Kardashians are focused on having a baby.\n\n“I didn’t know who it was until they pulled up. I advertise as 24-hours but they wanted to make sure I was still there,” One Love Wedding Chapel owner Marty Frierson told People of Barker and Kardashian. “They paid and they requested Elvis Presley, that was mandatory. I called back 5 minutes later and was like, ‘I got an Elvis,’ and there they were.” Frierson also told the magazine that the entire event lasted about 30 minutes. This comes a year after they made their relationship Instagram official.\n\nThough the pair have not been shy about packing on the PDA in the past, TMZ reported that they didn’t allow the wedding venue to take any pictures, preferring to staff the blessed event with their own photographer and security. The couple also reportedly had a marriage license in tow, which they gave to the chapel’s owner, who also served as a witness.\n\nAccording to TMZ, there will be “several” other wedding celebrations in the future.\n\nThe Blink-182 drummer and Kardashian posted a picture of their hands holding on Valentine’s Day in 2021, confirming that they were dating a few weeks before they first officially discussed their relationship on the Drew Barrymore Show several weeks later. A few days later, Barker, a twice-divorced father of two, shared a handwritten love note he wrote for the reality star in his Insta Stories.\n\nOver the next few months, the couple were spotted out several times, often with their couples friends Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox. In April, Kardashian — who shares three children with ex Scott Disick — revealed that Barker had tattooed her name on his body, followed in May by more ink on the drummer that read “I Love You” in her handwriting.\n\nThe next few months found them gushing about each other, sharing some private moments with their blended family, packing on the PDA, and, in October, announcing their engagement via Instagram posts with the caption “forever.”\n\nEd. note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the marriage was official."
