        "text": "Kim Kardashian said she loves her sister Kourtney's new relationship with Travis Barker - but joked that their PDAs are a little much.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star chatted about her sibling's romance with the Blink-182 drummer during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\nWhen asked if it's likely Travis will be part of the famous family's next reality project, Kim told Ellen: \"I honestly haven't talked to them about it, but I'm assuming because he's such a big part of Kourtney's life that they will be on.\n\n\"I love their relationship. They've grown so much together.\"\n\nSpeaking about how they got together, Kim reiterated that Kourtney and Travis had known each other for a long time.\n\nShe said: \"They've been neighbours and friends for almost 15 years — neighbours for like a decade!\"\n\nEllen joked: \"All of a sudden they can't keep their hands off each other.\n\n\"What's wrong with them? They are at it likes it's the last time they're going to see each other. It's a lot.\"\n\nKim agreed: \"It's a lot, but it's so cute.\"\n\nWhen Ellen joked that Kourtney and Travis were \"making out\" every time you see them, Kim said: \"You know what, that's what they do.\"\n\nThis will be Ellen's final series of her show, after she announced she would be leaving after 19 series.\n\nHer decision followed allegations of a toxic workplace on the show, something she had apologised for, but denied that her resignation was anything to do with the claims.\n\nEllen told the Hollywood Reporter : \"My brother was like, 'People look forward to this show every day, and there aren’t many shows out there that are just pure joy like this'.\n\n\"He’s always been my biggest advocate and — not that Portia isn’t, but she’s also selfish and wants me to do things that I’m challenged by, and she’s watched me come home every day saying, 'I just feel like there’s something more I could be doing'.\n\n\"I care about the environment. I care about animals. I care about design and furniture … So, definitely, people have been saying, 'Why don’t we just try to go a little longer?' But 19 years is a long time to do anything.\"\n\nEllen also addressed the toxic workplace accusations and admitted that they did \"almost\" impact the show.\n\nBut she said that she and her team managed to work through it."
