        "text": "VIA: MTV News\n\nEminem, Drake, Lil Wayne and Travis Barker will team up for a special performance at Sunday night’s Grammy Awards. The addition of the rap crew that represents nearly the entire lineup for the remix of Drake’s “Forever” — only awards-show fire starter Kanye West is missing — was announced via the Grammys’ Twitter early Thursday morning.\n\nThey join a major roster of performers that is already packed with all five Album of the Year nominees — Beyoncé, the Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, Dave Matthews Band and Taylor Swift — as well as Bon Jovi, Green Day, Lady Antebellum, Maxwell, Pink and the Zac Brown Band. The show will also boast a 3-D tribute to Michael Jackson featuring Celine Dion, Jennifer Hudson, Smokey Robinson, Carrie Underwood and Usher.\n\nThe Grammys Twitter also announced that Simon Baker, Ryan Seacrest, Chris O’Donnell, Robert Downey Jr. and Kaley Cuoco will be presenters at the 52nd annual awards show. Previously announced presenters include Kristen Bell, Justin Bieber, Jeff Bridges, Miley Cyrus, Josh Duhamel, the Jonas Brothers, Norah Jones, Ke$ha, LL Cool J, Ricky Martin, Carlos Santana and Ringo Starr.\n\nFor the show, Mary J. Blige will team up with famed tenor Andrea Bocelli to perform Simon & Garfunkel’s “Bridge Over Troubled Water” as part of a fundraiser for Haiti earthquake relief.\n\nThe special fundraising segment of Sunday night’s program will be released as an iTunes/Target.com download following the telecast, and all proceeds from its sale will go to the American Red Cross for earthquake recovery efforts in the devastated Caribbean island nation.\n\nHere’s Travis Barker’s remix of the song in case you forgot what it sounded like.\n\nRELATED: Drake Covers Complex Magazine"
