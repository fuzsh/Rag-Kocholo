I didn’t realise she was a minor and assumed she was my age. I made a careless mistake and this is a big lesson for me,” he added. \"I would like to apologise again to Alabama, her dad Travis, and her family.”\n\nAlabama later posted a statement via her Instagram stories and said: \"He is very sorry about the situation and regretful. I forgive him and would like for this all to be over.\"\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
