        "text": "lol @ peddle stool\n\nCan we #FreeKanye now? Jfc.\n\nEdited at 2010-01-28 08:06 pm (UTC)\n\nI really like \"Forever\", but if anyone had to be missing from the performance i wish it was Wayne.\n\nAw not my little wayney-pooh! It just wouldn't be the same without him. Everytime I hear his voice I think of my chain-smoking nana. Its kinda soothing.....\n\nlegendary drummer? really?\n\nlol, i'm assuming they meant of this generation.\n\nIKR?\n\nChris Daddy Dave is a legendary drummer.\n\nTravis Barker was in a band.\n\ntoo bad he hasn't been relevent since 2002, GRAMMYS.\n\nikr why is everyone on Eminem's dick again???\n\nI've always hated him and his fucking whiney voice. such trash, such white trash. hahaha\n\ni guess because he is relevant lol\n\nHe's very relevent, just not on ONTD.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nDon't drop the soap! 8-0\n\ni'd rather be pushing flowers than be in the pen sharing showers~\n\nLOL Stefan Raab.\n\nI just came in to post this exact comment :P\n\nhaha me too :D\n\nDitto!\n\nHaha, mte.\n\n(no subject) - davejohn Expand\n\nneeds more kanye >:|\n\nI thought Wayne was ALREADY back in prison. Maybe that was last year?\n\nIt's amazing though,everytime I think he's locked up,50 tracks come out with him on them lmao.\n\nYou may be thinking of T.I. as he was locked up for most of last year. haha\n\ni want kanye ://///\n\nfucking grammys. no kanye means i won't be watching it.\n\nYeah, the only reason I would watch that shitty show is if some drama were to happen....we all know Kanye - Award = Drama, which I call entertaining.\n\nI sold my peddle stool at the flea market :[ Well it was more like a step ladder. Good luck at the Grammy's Mr Eminem.\n\nomg J.D. Salinger passed :(\n\nyour icon in conjunction with your comment is making me LOL like crazy.\n\nI don't like Kanye, but if they are keeping him away from the show that's bullshit.\n\nEdited at 2010-01-28 08:15 pm (UTC)\n\nThe Grammys are classy, they don't want drunk people going on stage and embarrassing the music industry and the value the grammy awards have.\n\nHope Mariah isn't going then\n\n(no subject) - disco_balla Expand\n\nFuck that! If Kanye did something over-the-top like whip out his penis then told Taylor to try it, it tastes just like chocolate, then i'd understand but this is downright unjustified! I'm almost certain he's not going to beat Taylor Swift to a bloody pulp any time during the award show, or even acknowledge her at all the whole time he's there. There's nothing classy about judging people's character by media influence, the shit's died down. Plus, it really has help Taylor's career a great deal so I don't get why she would be upset by him being at the same event she's at.\n\n(no subject) - mrcelebrity Expand\n\n(no subject) - simplylovely1 Expand\n\nI hate how when they show the song forever they sometimes advertise it as\n\na lil wayne song\n\na kanye song\n\na eminem song\n\na drake song\n\nit's like who the fuck sang it so i can update it on my itunes"
