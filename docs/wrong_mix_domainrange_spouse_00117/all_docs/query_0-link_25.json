        "text": "Travis Barker 's ex-wife has seemingly reacted to the news of his engagement to Kourtney Kardashian by declaring she needs \"spiritual maintenance\".\n\nThe Blink-182 drummer proposed to his reality TV star girlfriend on Sunday, after less than a year of dating.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians star Kourtney shared a series of happy images on Instagram after the rocker got down on one knee to pop the question on a beach adorned with flowers and candles.\n\nTheir forthcoming wedding will be the first for 42-year-old Kourtney, who shares three kids with ex Scott Disick, and the third for drummer Travis.\n\nOn Monday, Travis' ex-wife Shanna Moakler appeared to react to the news of her former husband's engagement on her Instagram Stories.\n\nThe former Miss USA, who shares two teenage children with Travis, shared two cryptic quotes with her 292,000 followers, just hours after the news of her ex-husband and Kourtney's engagement broke.\n\nThe first posted to her Stories read: \"Tupac once said: Before you ask why someone hates you, ask yourself why you give a f***.\"\n\nShanna added a red love-heart emoji to the reposted quote, before going on to share a second mysterious Story.\n\nThe next quote shared by the model read: \"Temporarily closed for spiritual maintenance.\"\n\nShanna and Travis married in October 2004 and went on to star in MTV reality show, Meet the Barkers, which followed their everyday life with their two children. The pair filed for divorce in 2006, with the rocker going on to date Paris Hilton.\n\nThe former couple share two children together, Alabama and Landon Barker.\n\nEarlier this year, Shanna dubbed her ex-husband's PDAs with Kourtney as \"weird\" and claimed her children spend more time with their father due to his \"mega mansion\".\n\nDaughter Alabama seemed to react to her mother's claims on TikTok, in a now deleted post.\n\nPosting her thoughts over a screenshot of what appears to be a message from Shanna, the teen TikTok star claimed: \"My mom has never completely been in my life, can you guys stop painting her out to be an amazing mom.\n\n\"Did your mom ask to see you on Mother’s Day cause mine didn’t? I’m done keeping a secret, reality shows.\"\n\nBoth Alabama and brother Landon have been publicly supportive of their dad's romance with Kourtney ever since the pair first went public with their relationship at the start of the year.\n\nShortly after their fairy tale proposal on Sunday, Travis and Kourtney were joined by both their families to celebrate the happy news.\n\nLandon, 18, and Alabama, 15, were among those in attendance at the intimate dinner, and shared their approval for their dad's new fiancée.\n\n\"Congratulations [Kourtney] and [Travis] I’m so happy for you guys love you guys so much,\" Landon wrote, while sharing a clip of the newly-engaged couple.\n\nAlabama also shared a sweet image of the happy pair, writing: \"So happy for you guys I love you both!\""
