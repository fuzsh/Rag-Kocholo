        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and stepson Landon show off secret handshake\n\nSome fans have spotted a huge red flag between Travis Barker, Kourtney Kardashian, and their newborn son.\n\nThe Blink-182 rocker, 47, and reality star, 44, recently welcomed their first child together, son Rocky 13 Barker.\n\nWhile the couple have been celebrating the end of what was a turbulent pregnancy and their new addition to the family, fans have begun to accuse Barker of acting in a seemingly controlling way toward Kourtney.\n\nThe now mother of four's fans noticed that they had called their son \"Rocky\" because Travis wanted the name.\n\nIn July, Travis said he wanted to name his son Rocky 13 after his favorite musician, Suicidal Tendencies' guitarist, and his favorite number.\n\nRead more: 'Kourtney knows truth' Travis Barker hits back at ‘ridiculous’ Kim Kardashian feud rumor\n\nHe told his daughter Alabama: \"I like Rocky 13. That's this name that's just been going through my head lately.\"\n\nSomewhere along the way, Barker either convinced his wife or they agreed together that the name was a right fit for their unborn baby.\n\nShortly before the birth, Barker accidentally let slip the baby's name on an episode of the One Life One Chance podcast.\n\nTalking about their Halloween plans, the drummer said: “There was a benefit in Hawaii that we were gonna do, but it’s the week that Rocky’s due.”\n\nFans have slammed the musician for seemingly not letting Kourtney have a say in their child's name.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nTravis Barker 'bites' Kourtney Kardashian's hand in terrifying Halloween costume [REPORT]\n\nTravis Barker screams in behind-the-scenes video - and Kourtney leaves comment [LATEST]\n\nKourtney Kardashian shares new baby update as she shares glimpse of nursery [INSIGHT]\n\nOne wrote on Reddit: \"Travis is controlling in my opinion. He’s the one who named their son based on his interests.\n\n\"Idc if Kravis fans will start to attack me for this but this is giving major red flags.\"\n\nThe user also reflected on their dramatic Italian wedding in May 2022 and Kourtney's changing style to reflect Barker's rocker vibe.\n\nThey wrote: \"Like both Kourtney and Travis’s wedding was all based off his vibe and Kourtney changed her whole wardrobe to match his style.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Her allowing this baby’s name to be Rocky Thirteen will confirm for me that he is controlling.\n\n\"Rocky, that’s one thing. Not my vibe, and not the real Kourtney’s vibe, but I could see it. THIRTEEN? Baby, this ain’t stranger things!!!!\"\n\nA third posted: \"Yeah I don't like that the new kid's name is completely Travis's interest. Kourt was the only one that had normal names for her kids and then Barker wanted Rocky 13.\n\n\"He seems very controlling and the only reason why Kourtney accepts it, is because to her he loves and is devoted to her.\"\n\nSources close to Kourtney confirmed to People on Saturday that she and Barker have welcomed their baby boy after other sources were reporting seeing her at the hospital on Friday.\n\nTMZ confirmed that Kourtney arrived at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Monday."
