        "text": "The 44-year-old reality star, who announced she married Barker in May last year, posted an Instagram video showing her holding up a sign at his band’s gig saying: “Travis I’m pregnant.”\n\nIn the clip, bassist and singer Mark Hoppus is also heard saying: “Let’s hear it for Travis, someone’s having a baby.”\n\nBarker is then seen getting off the stage, hugging and then kissing Kardashian.\n\nThe moment appears to be a reference to Blink-182’s music video All The Small Things in which the musicians mocked various boy bands and played in front of a crowd with someone carrying a sign saying: “Travis I’m pregnant.”\n\nDrummer Barker, 47, had been on stage at the BMO Stadium in Los Angeles on Friday alongside the other members of the rock band.\n\nOn Kardashian’s stories, she also shows a large screen at the concert displaying her notice to the crowd.\n\nShe had previously documented in her family’s Hulu series The Kardashians how she was going through fertility treatment to get pregnant.\n\nThe reality star already shares three children with US media personality Scott Disick, who she was in an on-off relationship with previously.\n\nBarker has been married twice previously, first briefly to Melissa Kennedy and then to actress and former Miss USA titleholder Shanna Moakler, with whom he shares two children."
