        "text": "Alliteration happens when words that start with the same sound (not just the same letter) are used repeatedly in a phrase or sentence. The sound is a consonant sound, and the words don't have to be right next to one another. Alliteration can make ordinary sentences sound funny, so get ready for giggles with these alliteration examples for kids!\n\nFrom brunch to athleisure, portmanteaus have become an everyday part of existence. In practical terms, they’re convenient, but they’re also a cool look at the way language can flex and form to our needs. Portmanteaus have become so commonplace that they tend to be the go-to for naming things, even holidays and events. From Movember to Halloween, knowing these names can help you learn our weird language and impress your friends along the way."
