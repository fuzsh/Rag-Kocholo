The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather, declining sugar prices, and declining textile and apparel production, have slowed economic growth, leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community.\n\nGeography Back To Top\n\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\n\ntotal: 0.61 cu km/yr (25%/14%/60%)\n\nper capita: 488 cu m/yr (2000)\n\nTotal renewable water resources:\n\n2.2 cu km (2001)\n\nLand boundaries:\n\n0 km\n\nEnvironment - international agreements:\n\nparty to: Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nClimate:\n\ntropical, modified by southeast trade winds; warm, dry winter (May to November); hot, wet, humid summer (November to May)\n\nMap references:\n\nPolitical Map of the World\n\nGeographic coordinates:\n\n20 17 S, 57 33 E\n\nNatural resources:\n\narable land, fish\n\nElevation extremes:\n\nlowest point: Indian Ocean 0 m\n\nhighest point: Mont Piton 828 m\n\nTerrain:\n\nsmall coastal plain rising to discontinuous mountains encircling central plateau\n\nGeography - note:\n\nthe main island, from which the country derives its name, is of volcanic origin and is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs; home of the dodo, a large flightless bird related to pigeons, driven to extinction by the end of the 17th century through a combination of hunting and the introduction of predatory species\n\nArea:\n\ntotal: 2,040 sq km\n\nland: 2,030 sq km\n\nwater: 10 sq km\n\nnote: includes Agalega Islands, Cargados Carajos Shoals (Saint Brandon), and Rodrigues\n\nLocation:\n\nSouthern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar\n\nCoastline:\n\n177 km\n\nArea - comparative:\n\nalmost 11 times the size of Washington, DC\n\nIrrigated land:\n\n220 sq km (2003)\n\nEnvironment - current issues:\n\nwater pollution, degradation of coral reefs\n\nMaritime claims:\n\nmeasured from claimed archipelagic straight baselines\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin\n\nNatural hazards:\n\ncyclones (November to April); almost completely surrounded by reefs that may pose maritime hazards\n\nLand use:\n\narable land: 49.02%\n\npermanent crops: 2.94%\n\nother: 48.04% (2005)\n\nPeople Back To Top\n\nTotal fertility rate:\n\n1.83 children born/woman (2008 est.)\n\nSex ratio:\n\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\nunder 15 years: 1.03 male(s)/female\n\n15-64 years: 0.99 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.67 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 0.97 male(s)/female (2008 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate:\n\n0.1% (2001 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - people living with HIV/AIDS:\n\n700 (2001 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth:\n\ntotal population: 73.75 years\n\nmale: 70.28 years\n\nfemale: 77.4 years (2008 est.)\n\nLiteracy:\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 84.4%\n\nmale: 88.4%\n\nfemale: 80.5% (2000 census)\n\nNet migration rate:\n\n-0.09 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2008 est.)\n\nEthnic groups:\n\nIndo-Mauritian 68%, Creole 27%, Sino-Mauritian 3%, Franco-Mauritian 2%\n\nMedian age:\n\ntotal: 31.5 years\n\nmale: 30.6 years\n\nfemale: 32.3 years (2008 est.)\n\nPopulation:\n\n1,274,189 (July 2008 est.)\n\nEducation expenditures:\n\n3.9% of GDP (2006)\n\nPopulation growth rate:\n\n0.8% (2008 est.)\n\nLanguages:\n\nCreole 80.5%, Bhojpuri 12.1%, French 3.4%, English (official; spoken by less than 1% of the population), other 3.7%, unspecified 0.3% (2000 census)\n\nDeath rate:\n\n6.55 deaths/1,000 population (2008 est.)\n\nInfant mortality rate:\n\ntotal: 12.56 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nmale: 14.94 deaths/1,000 live births\n\nfemale: 10.06 deaths/1,000 live births (2008 est.)\n\nHIV/AIDS - deaths:\n\nfewer than 100 (2001 est.)\n\nSchool life expectancy (primary to tertiary education):\n\ntotal: 14 years\n\nmale: 14 years\n\nfemale: 13 years (2005)\n\nAge structure:\n\n0-14 years: 23% (male 148,573/female 143,859)\n\n15-64 years: 70.1% (male 443,968/female 449,670)\n\n65 years and over: 6.9% (male 35,269/female 52,850) (2008 est.)\n\nBirth rate:\n\n14.64 births/1,000 population (2008 est.)\n\nReligions:\n\nHindu 48%, Roman Catholic 23.6%, Muslim 16.6%, other Christian 8.6%, other 2.5%, unspecified 0.3%, none 0.4% (2000 census)\n\nNationality:\n\nnoun: Mauritian(s)\n\nadjective: Mauritian\n\nGovernment Back To Top\n\nDiplomatic representation from the US:\n\nchief of mission: Ambassador Cesar CABRERA\n\nembassy: 4th Floor, Rogers House, John Kennedy Street, Port Louis\n\nmailing address: international mail: P.

For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).\n\nNatural gas - exports:\n\n0 cu m (2007 est.)\n\nImports - commodities:\n\nmanufactured goods, capital equipment, foodstuffs, petroleum products, chemicals\n\nIndustries:\n\nfood processing (largely sugar milling), textiles, clothing, mining, chemicals, metal products, transport equipment, nonelectrical machinery, tourism\n\nElectricity - exports:\n\n0 kWh (2007 est.)\n\nPopulation below poverty line:\n\n8% (2006 est.)\n\nCommercial bank prime lending rate:\n\n21.87% (31 December 2007)\n\nStock of quasi money:\n\n$6.759 billion (31 December 2007)\n\nElectricity - production:\n\n2.321 billion kWh (2007 est.)\n\nImports:\n\n$4.503 billion f.o.b.
