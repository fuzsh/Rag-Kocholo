Hungry Horse is at the edge of the lake formed by Hungry Horse Dam. It is a s'#39;s throw away from Glacier National Park's west entrance. Completed in 1953, Hungry Horse Dam is Montana's highest dam at 564 feet and the eleventh largest concrete dam in the U.S. The visitor center is located at the dam where guided tours begin. The dam and reservoir are surrounded by spectacular mountains, offering excellent fishing and hiking in the immediate area.
