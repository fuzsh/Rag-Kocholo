Best bets for weekend fishing It is grasshopper season with best fishing on the Wood River, and meadow areas of SF Sprague, NF Sprague, Upper Sycan Rivers and Long Creek. Brook trout fishing is excellent in the headwater areas of the Sycan, SF Sprague, North Fork Sprague, Long Creek, Upper Williamson, and Sevenmile Creek. Fishing for largemouth bass continues to be good at Lake of the Woods Yellow perch fishing remains excellent at the classic areas (mouth of Sevenmile, Williamson River, Crystal Creek near Pelican Bay, Fourmile Canal and Pelican Bay). Ana Reservoir was stock with over 2,700 rainbow trout in late July. The constant temperature in this spring fed lake means fishing continues to be good this time of year. Anglers up for a 2.5 mile hike into the Gearhart Wilderness will find good fishing at Blue Lake. There has been some fun hopper fishing recently on the Chewaucan River. In Ana Reservoir, anglers have been catching smaller 10-inch hybrid bass, which put up a good fight for their size. Anglers have been catching nice crappie in Bully Creek Reservoir. Fishing for holdover and recently stocked trout has been hot on Beulah Reservoir, Chickahominy Reservoir and Fish Lake. Trout stocking Scheduled to be stocked the week of Aug. 12:‌ No stocking scheduled for this week. Stocking will resume in September.‌ Recently stocked:‌ Ana Reservoir‌ Trout stocking maps‌ Check out the ODFW fishing and trout stocking maps to find nearby fishing locations, driving directions and descriptions of amenities. Announcements 5 tips for fishing in hot water‌ With temperatures soaring to near 100 degrees this weekend, fish will start feeling the heat. Give them a break by following these warm weather fishing guidelines.‌ Anglers: What to know about wildfires‌ Wildfire season is hitting Oregon hard. Be sure to \"know before you go\" by checking for closures or fire restrictions before heading out. You can check for the latest fire updates and closures using the links on this webpage.‌ Fishing during blue-green algae (cyanobacterial) blooms‌ As temperatures heat up during spring and summer, be on the watch for harmful algae blooms when recreating in Oregon lakes, rivers and reservoirs. Before you go fishing, check water quality conditions at the Oregon Health Authority website.‌ Fish consumption advisories‌ The Oregon Health Authority has issued consumption guidelines for various waterbodies in Oregon including the Snake and Columbia Rivers due to high levels of mercury and/or PCBs. Fish with these chemicals look, act, smell and taste like any other fish, so caution is important.‌ Statewide advisories Bonneville Dam fish advisory Safe fish choices for pregnancy and young children Sign up for the latest information on boater access ‌ Marine Board's Opportunities and Access Report incorporates information from federal and state agencies, local facility operators and fellow boaters to provide up-to-date information so boaters can decide where to recreate and what to expect this season. Subscribe to receive email updates.‌ Got a good fish story?‌ If you have been out fishing and have a recent fishing report you would like to share, we would love to hear it! Please send your fishing updates to: odfw.info@odfw.oregon.gov. Updates by waterbody AGENCY LAKE (including Straits): redband trout, yellow perch, brown trout‌ Open year-round. Likely all redband trout have moved to the mouth of the Wood River area or other water quality refuge. The algae bloom is abundant in locations. Agency Lake is terrible to fish in the wind and even harder to launch/trailer your boat at Henzel Park. Launching at Petric Park is another option. The channel at Petric can fill with aquatic vegetation. Due to abundant aquatic vegetation at the mouth area of Wood River casting lures or flies is the best method for catching redband trout. Vegetation is getting worse aslake level declines rapidly. Fishing just outside the vegetation line on the south end of the Wood River mouth is best.‌ Overall fishing is fair. Some trophy redband trout are being caught. ‌ Catch rates remain low due to record setting drought in the years 2020 thru 2022 resulting in poor survival of juvenile redband trout and subsequent recruitment into the adult population.‌ Agency Lake regulations are catch-and-release for redband/rainbow trout with no bait allowed (artificial flies and lures only). The boundary of Agency Lake is the south end of the Straits. This change is due to record low spawning escapement for trophy redband trout throughout the Klamath Basin in 2020. ODFW also encourages the use of single barbless hooks in this fishery, not removing the fish from the water, and using catch-and-release rubber nets.‌ Keep on the lookout for radio tagged redband trout. These fish must be released unharmed. The long antenna looks like fishing line coming from the abdomen. Please report any radio tagged fish. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ ANA RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, hybrid bass‌ The reservoir was stocked with 2,750 legal rainbow trout at the end of July. Fishing should be good this month as the temperature of the reservoir is constant. There should be mayfly hatches that can benefit fly-fishers and fishing along the bottom with bait near the dam usually produces. The reservoir is full and all boats can launch at the ramp. There have not been any recent fishing reports, but trolling is a good option. If fishing from ODFW property on the south side of the reservoir you will need a wildlife area parking permit.‌ Some fishermen have been catching hybrid bass from last year's stocking. These fish are around 10 inches and put up a good fight for their size. Casting lures and trolling have been effective. Just remember you can only keep 1 hybrid bass per day and it needs to be 15 inches long. ‌ Bait fishing is the proven method for catching hybrid bass, but fly-fishing and casting Rapalas are also effective when these fish are feeding. Rapalas that imitate tui chub and rainbow trout, favorite food sources for hybrid bass, are good bets for catching these fish. On sunny days you will need to fish deeper than cloudy days. Last updated 8/14/24.‌ ANNIE CREEK: brook trout, brown trout and redband trout‌ Open year round with bait allowed. Fishing is slow. Flows have dropped but still a little high. ‌ Annie Creek flows‌ Most of the creek is dominated by small brook trout up to 10 inches. Brown trout are rare and redband trout are highly unlikely in the catch. Please report any redband/rainbow trout caught in the creek to ODFW at 541-883-5732. ‌ Access is available year-round off Hwy. 62 at the USFS snow park. Access also available south of the Snow Park off Sun Pass State Forest. There is plenty of public property on USFS, State Forest and Crater Lake National Park – fishing is regulated by the National Park (541-594-3000). ‌ Several waterfalls occur on the creek inside Crater Lake National Park offering exceptional views. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ BECK KIWANIS POND, Ontario: trout, bluegill, largemouth bass‌ Fishing for bluegill should be great. Bluegill can be caught using bait such as night crawlers, worms, or grasshoppers fished under a small bobber. Artificial lures such as spinners, jigs, and flies will also be effective. Bluegill have small mouths so using a smaller hook size and downsizing bait will improve success. The pond is experiencing an algae bloom that happens annually throughout the warmer months of the year. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ BEULAH RESERVOIR: redband trout, hatchery rainbow trout, whitefish, bull trout‌ Beulah Reservoir is around 70 percent full and the boat ramp is in good shape. Recent sampling indicated there are some very nice trout in Beulah right now up to 20 inches long. ‌ Surface water temperatures will be warm so if you are targeting trout your best bet will be trolling in some deeper water from a boat or fishing near some of the steeper drop offs from the bank. Fishing near the inlet of the North Fork Malheur in the submerged river channel can also be productive during the heat of the summer. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ BIG ROCK RESERVOIR: hatchery rainbow trout‌ Fishing should still be fair, but algae and vegetation will be problematic. Try to keep your offering in the top of the water column. Bait, lures and flies are sure-fire ways to catch rainbow trout in this reservoir. Rainbow trout will continue growing this spring and summer. Water level is unknown at this time, but fish should be hungry. Last updated 7/31/23.‌ BLITZEN RIVER: redband trout, carp‌ The Blitzen is flowing around 60 cfs with temperatures reaching the low 70s in the afternoon. If you are fishing during the heat of the day follow warm weather fishing guidelines to reduce stress on fish if you are catch-and-release fishing. Fishing has been fair so far this season. There are some large redband in the Blitzen right now but densities are low so you may need to cover plenty of water to find fish. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ BLUE LAKE: rainbow trout‌ Fishing was fantastic mid July. Trolling flies behind a float tube and casting towards rising fish were productive for fish in the 10- to 15-inch range. Using bait or casting lures can also be quite effective. The water is warm so wet wading is also an option.‌ This is a great 2.5 mile hike into the Gearhart Wilderness. Don't forget your mosquito spray! Access is available via the North Fork Sprague Trailhead and the trail Has been cleared. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ BURNS POND: trout‌ Burns Pond was stocked with 7,000 legal trout in late May. No recent reports but there should still be trout available. Water temperatures are now warm so fishing early and late in the day will be most effective. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ BULLY CREEK RESERVOIR: bass, catfish, crappie, rainbow trout‌ There has recently been a large carp die off at Bully Creek Reservoir. At this time, the fish kill appears to be carp specific. If you notice other species of fish dead, dying, or in poor health please contact ODFW Hines office at 541-573-6582.‌ The reservoir is around 60 percent full and the boat ramp is in great shape. Bully Creek Reservoir was stocked with 2,000 legal rainbow trout in May.‌ There are some larger smallmouth and largemouth bass available but the majority of the bass sampled recently were less than 12 inches long. Anglers have reported catching some nice crappie this spring. There is a strong year class of age one crappie right now so expect crappie fishing to get even better in a couple of years. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ CAMPBELL LAKE: rainbow trout, brook trout‌ Fishing has been good for stocked trout the past couple of weeks. Trolling lures is by far the most productive during the day. There is a small boat launch at this site. Fishing from the bank can also be productive as casting lures around fallen logs. Keep moving if not successful. Last update 7/31/24.‌ CAMPBELL RESERVOIR: redband trout, largemouth bass, white and black crappie, bluegill‌ BLM, ODFW, and BOR stocked a total of 431 crappie in April ranging in size from 8 to 14 inches. ‌ . The reservoir was dry in summer of 2022. All fish perished. ODFW and BLM have stocked many size classes of largemouth bass and a few crappie in 2023. Catch-and-release is encouraged to allow for establishment of fish populations. There might also be a few redband trout around. The reservoir is about 40 percent full. ‌ There is no boat ramp on the reservoir that occurs on public property. Most of the reservoir sits on private property. You can park close to the water and haul a small boat to water's edge on BLM property. Water is slightly turbid but better water clarity than most desert reservoirs. Best fishing near the deeper water near the willows at the dam. This can only be accessed by boat. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ CHERRY CREEK: brook trout and redband trout‌ Open all year. Water temperatures are ideal. Catch rates improving and mosquitoes are not as abundant as earlier this year. These fish are spooky and water is crystal clear.‌ Cherry Creek flows‌ This creek is very small; well-suited to fly-fishing. Brook trout are more abundant higher in the system. A very big fish in the creek is 10 inches. Water is crystal clear after it settles from the spring snow melt, and habitat is exceptional. ‌ The Cherry Creek trail parallels the creek and leads to many productive wilderness lakes. One of the best waterfalls in the basin is just off the trail.‌ ODFW encourages unlimited harvest of brook trout Recent sampling showed high densities of brook trout and redband trout lower on the creek. The redband trout in this creek are some of the prettiest around. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ CHEWAUCAN RIVER: redband trout, largemouth bass, brown bullhead‌ Fishing was great this past weekend for fish in the 8- to 16-inch range. Fishing with hoppers at this time of year is a lot of fun. Casting dry flies in the morning and evening while fishing throughout the water column mid-day are productive tactics. Lures will also catch fish if retrieved correctly. Plan for fishing to be a tad slow as redband populations are lower right now due to drought and recent wildfires. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ CHICKAHOMINY RESERVOIR: trout‌ Chickahominy is about 50 percent full right now and boat ramp and dock are in great shape. There is a prolific algae bloom in the reservoir now which can be toxic at times. Avoid swimming and keep your pets out of the water if you observe blue green algae stains on the shoreline. ‌ There are some nice holdover trout in Chickahominy up to 20 inches and fishing has been great so far this spring and early summer.‌ Fly-anglers have been having success with leach patterns, various nymphs, and streamers fished under an indicator or striped in.‌ Fishing from shore using putty bait also has been effective. Artificial lures including spinners and crankbaits have also been effective especially in the early morning and evening.‌ Water temperatures are warm right now so if you plan to catch and release fish follow the warm weather fishing guidelines to avoid unintended mortality. Last updated 7/3/24.‌ CORRAL CREEK (SF Sprague): brook trout and brown trout‌ Open year round. Bait is allowed. Fishing should be good at the large beaver ponds near confluence with SF Sprague River. A 10-inch brook trout would be huge for this area. There is a campground on the creek as well as very cool hiking trails in the Gearhart Mtns. No limit on brook and brown trout. Catch is typically dominated by Brook Trout with Brown Trout making up about 5% of catch. Please release adipose clipped Brook Trout. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ COTTONWOOD MEADOW LAKE: rainbow trout, brook trout‌ Fishing during the summer months is usually pretty slow as vegetation and temperatures increase. Try fishing early in the morning when temps are the lowest. Trolling with flies or lures is by far the best option. Most fish are in the 8- to 12-inch range, but there are plenty of fish 16-20 inches.‌ The boat ramp near the dam is the best way to launch here. If bank fishing, try areas with less vegetation and keep your offering off the bottom. Last update 7/31/24.‌ CROOKED CREEK (Klamath Co): redband trout, brook trout and brown trout‌ Crooked Creek is open to fishing. Public access occurs above HWY 62. This section is typically slow for all fish. Small brook trout occur in the spring areas. Last updated 6/17/24.‌ CRYSTAL CREEK redband trout and yellow perch‌ There are many small redband trout this year from 8-16 inches. No bait is allowed. Best flies are those that mimic leeches or dragonflies. ‌ There is a boat ramp at Malone Springs. Best fishing is downstream of Malone Springs. The channel above Malone Springs can fill with aquatic vegetation later in the summer. The creek is best fished from a boat. ‌ Yellow perch are most abundant near Pelican Bay. Fishing is best during August and September when perch are densely schooled. The creek remains full of aquatic vegetation making fishing challenging in most areas. Look for the vegetation edges for yellow perch. The beaver dam at the start of Recreation Creek off Crystal Creek was blocking boat traffic and potentially fish three weeks ago. A small cut was created to allow fish and boat traffic, but they might have it plugged again. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ Check Crystal Creek Flow. ‌ DEADHORSE LAKE: rainbow trout‌ Fishing has been good for stocked trout the past couple of weeks. Insect production in the lake might be affected by recent wildfires as holdover trout have been skinny. Most fish are in the west end of the lake away from the campground and boat ramp. Trolling and casting lures was the proven method while some fish were being caught from the shore. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ DEEP CREEK: redband trout‌ The headwater stretch should be fishing well right now for smaller redband and brook trout. Make sure to bring mosquito spray! The creeks associated with the upper sections of Deep Creek will also produce pan sized fish.‌ Current river conditions are pretty low, but fishing is good for fish in the 8- to 16-inch range. With lower water, stealth is key to fool these wary trout. A recent fishing trip at the end of June proved there are multiple age classes in this area with fish up to 16 inches. Fly-fishing with nymphs is the best method to target these redband trout although a well-retrieved spinner can also catch fish. Fly-fishing with hoppers can also be a heart pounding experience right now. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ DELINTMENT LAKE: rainbow trout‌ The campground at Delintment Lake is currently closed due to the Falls Fire. Please check with Malheur National Forest for updates on this closure and other area closures due to the Falls Fire.‌ Delintment Lake was stocked with 5,000 legal trout this spring. There are also some holdover trout available from last year. Fishing should be great. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ DOG LAKE: largemouth bass, yellow perch, black crappie, brown bullhead, redband trout‌ The lake is open and can be a great producer of warmwater fish in the summer. There have not been any recent fishing reports, but bass, perch and crappie can be caught right now. There is a good boat launch at this lake, but vegetation might restrict some motors. Fishing from the bank is pretty difficult in most areas. Try fishing crappie jigs under bobbers and soft plastics for bass in the shadows. Best fishing will be during the morning and evening hours. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ ELKHORN MOUNTAINS HIGH LAKES: brook trout, rainbow trout‌ Warmer weather has opened much of the high country. Many high lakes are now ice free or thawing. Throughout the rest of the summer, brook trout and rainbow trout can be caught in many alpine waterbodies. These fish are often aggressive feeders and can be readily caught on flies and lures. They also can make a tasty camp dinner for backpackers. Last updated 7/17/24.‌ FISH LAKE (Steens Mountain): rainbow trout, brook trout‌ The Steens Loop Road is now open. Fish Lake was recently stocked with 400 trophy rainbow trout and 2,000 legal rainbows. There are still plenty of trout available and fishing has been fair. Casting a fly to rising trout may be the most effective way to catch fish. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ FORT CREEK: brown trout, redband trout, brook trout, bull trout‌ Fishing for brown trout can be very challenging in Fort Creek due to crystal clear water year-round. Most of the creek on private property. If you can get access, fishing is good near the confluence with the Wood River. Salmonflies were observed last week. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ FOURMILE CREEK (CANAL) (tributary to Agency Lake): brook, brown, redband trout, yellow perch‌ Open all year. Bait is allowed. Yellow perch fishing should be excellent in Fourmile Canal, if you can find them. You can access the canal by boat from launching at Henzel Park. Best fishing for perch is August and September. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in areas of Fourmile Canal.‌ Fishing at Fourmile Creek will be improving if you can find the concentrations of brook trout. Try the confluence with Fourmile Canal or where the Cherry Creek channel hits Fourmile Creek. A kayak can be launched at the headwaters at Fourmile Springs. There is also a beaver dam. Concentrate efforts around the dam. Flows and water levels are high. ‌ Fishing in the area downstream of where Fourmile Creek hits Fourmile Canal can be excellent especially with grasshopper patterns. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ Check Fourmile Canal Flow.‌ FOURMILE LAKE: hatchery rainbow trout, lake trout, kokanee, brook trout‌ Access to the lake is available. The lake is currently 14 percent full. The lake has been stocked multiple times with rainbow trout. In hot weather rainbow trout hold in deeper water that is more accessible by boat. Fishing should be slow for stocked rainbow trout. Fishing should be slow for brook trout and lake trout. Best fishing is from a boat.. Look for areas of flooded timber, tributary inputs and the large points. ‌ Check Fourmile Lake Levels.‌ Please report any kokanee caught from the lake. ‌ Launching boats becomes particularly challenging as the lake recedes. There is no official concrete boat ramp with dock. Launching takes place from a sandy shoreline. Only small boats are recommended. You can also call Lake of the Woods Resort for updates. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ GERBER RESERVOIR: white and black crappie, yellow perch, brown bullhead and largemouth bass‌ Fish sampling by Bureau of Reclamation this year showed incredible densities of yellow perch and some larger crappie. Use small hooks and bait for the perch as most are small with smallmouths.‌ Fishing should be improving for brown bullhead and yellow perch. Best place to fish for perch is at the north boat ramp. Near the Barnes Valley Boat ramp can also be worth a try if lake levels are high enough. Crappie are suspended in the main part of the reservoir or near deeper water.‌ The reservoir is 16 percent full. Call the Klamath Falls BLM office for updated information. A higher lake level improves the crappie fishery.‌ Gerber Reservoir water levels‌ Gerber Reservoir is a large turbid reservoir with good bank access. Most of the reservoir is on BLM property. Open all year. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ HEART LAKE: hatchery rainbow trout‌ There have not been any fishing reports, but fishing should be fair towards the far end of the lake. Trolling is a good option and bait fishing near the dam can be great. If fishing from the bank, try different areas around the lake. There is very little activity near the dam and fish know it. The boat ramp is horrendous, but small boats can still be launched. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ HOLBROOK RESERVOIR: hatchery rainbow trout‌ The reservoir is getting weedy and fishing has slowed down. Bank fishing is probably more productive right now. If bait along the bottom is not working try increasing your leader length or fishing bait under a bobber. The dam area is probably going to be your best bet right now. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ J.C. BOYLE RESERVOIR (Topsy Reservoir), now Klamath River‌ The reservoir is now a river. All boat ramps are closed. The river is not accessible due to deep sediment and KRRC rules. The old reservoir will now change to the Klamath River regulations, which are: no bait allowed and one redband/rainbow trout in the 12- to 15-inch size class. Fishing will be closed June 15-Oct. 1 from Keno Dam downstream to Highway 66 Bridge. Last updated 3/6/24.‌ UPPER KLAMATH LAKE: native redband trout, yellow perch, kokanee, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, tui chub and blue chub‌ The lake is open to fishing all year. It's likely most redband trout have moved to water quality refuge. ‌ Best location to fish for redband trout will be Pelican Bay, Odessa Creek, and Harriman Creek. Yellow perch fishing should be excellent in Pelican Bay, Mouth of Williamson River, Mouth of Recreation Creek.‌ Please remember that nets or traps of any type cannot be used to catch any species of fish. This includes minnows to use for bait. See page 20 of the Sport Fishing Regulations for legal harvest methods for minnows and chubs. ‌ ODFW encourages catch-and-release on this fishery due to record low spawning numbers in 2020 and very low numbers in 2019 and the record setting drought from 2020 thru 2022 which reduced survival. Please fight your fish quickly and then release your fish immediately without removing it from the water. Releasing fish is easier with barbless hooks.‌ As water temperatures warm please make sure that your catch has swam away strongly and into deeper water. Water temperature at the surface is much higher. White pelicans are waiting for redband trout that have been improperly handled. ‌ The lake is 3.1 feet below full pool and 51 percent full.   Klamath Lake water levels‌ Please remember that once you retain your one redband/rainbow trout limit you must stop fishing for redband/rainbow trout. Also, all radio tagged redband trout must be released unharmed. Redband trout will have what looks to be fishing line coming from the abdomen. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ KLAMATH RIVER: native redband trout, rainbow trout, brown trout‌ Keno Dam downstream to Hwy 66‌ The river below Keno Dam downstream to Hwy 66 is closed. The river will open again Oct. 1. Last updated 6/19/24.‌ Hwy 66 Bridge downstream to Springs ‌ This section of river is open year-round. Access is currently prohibited by KRRC from Hwy 66 to the dam. Removal of JC Boyle Dam has begun. Fishing not recommended in this section due to difficult access. The Powerhouse Road on the west side of the river will be closed all year. Access to the Klamath River will be available from the Topsy Grade Road or traveling through Dorris. The Topsy Grade Road can have large potholes. This section of the river will require a significant hike to the river on the east side. ‌ Regulations will change Jan. 1, 2024 to a bag limit of one redband rainbow trout per day in the 12- to 15-inch size class. This is to protect large redband trout spawners, chinook, coho and steelhead smolts and Chinook salmon, coho salmon and steelhead adults. Last updated 8/6/24. ‌ Springs to state line with California‌ The Frain Ranch section is not very fishable. Turbidity declining fast after the breeching of the coffer dam at JC Boyle. Take the road through Dorris to access. This section of river is open year-round. Turbidity can be tracked by visiting the USGS Real Time Klamath River Gage. ‌ Currently, turbidity is low at 38 FNU. Fishing only recommended when turbidity (FNU) is less than 40. The Powerhouse Road on the west side of the river will be closed all year. Access to the Klamath River will be available from the Topsy Grade Road or traveling through Dorris. The Topsy Grade Road can have large potholes.‌ Patterns and lures that mimic crayfish, golden stoneflies, salmonfly nymphs, caddisflies and leeches should work well. Panther Martin spinners can work well down there. Dry flies that mimic caddisflies or mayflies hatching can also work well. ‌ Click here for Klamath River flow and turbidity.‌ Regulations changed on Jan. 1, 2024 to a bag limit of one redband-rainbow trout per day in the 12- to 15-inch size class. This regulation is to protect large redband trout spawners, Chinook salmon smolts and adults, and steelhead smolts and adults. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ KRUMBO RESERVOIR: trout, bass‌ Fishing for holdover trout has been great this spring. Anglers are consistently catching trout in the 17-inch range using a variety of methods. Fly-fishing with streamers from the bank has been productive, PowerBait has been working well, and trolling from a boat will also turn up a few fish.‌ Krumbo was stocked with 5,000 legal-size rainbow trout in June. We saw some nice bass during recent sampling, the most productive bass fishing will be near the reservoir inlet among the rushes. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ LAKE EWAUNA-KLAMATH RIVER (Above Keno Dam to Link River): redband trout, largemouth bass, Sacramento perch, yellow perch, crappie, brown bullhead, goldfish, tui and blue chub‌ Fishing not recommended at this time. This stretch of river and lake has typically been an area that lacked significant fish densities to warrant much of a fishery. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the summer approach 0 mg/l in many areas thus reducing fish densities. Water quality is declining fast in this area.‌ Recent sampling found good numbers of small, juvenile largemouth bass, Sacramento perch, yellow perch and even a few crappie. These findings are surprising. This is a very large area and anglers might be able to find largemouth bass and perch. Look for areas of water return from wetlands or pumps. These areas will have more oxygen and better water quality. The area near Lake Ewauna and below the Tule Smoke Hunt Club (Rat Club) are places to focus as water quality is typically better in those locations. The side channel area near the island below Hwy140 bridge might also be worth some effort. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ LAKE OF THE WOODS: hatchery rainbow trout, kokanee, hatchery brown trout, yellow perch, brown bullhead, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, crappie, tui chub‌ Fishing for rainbow trout is slow. Trout typically hold in 15 feet of water when water temperature are warm. Using a downrigger or heavier lines can improve catch rates. For recent fishing updates, call the resort at 1-866-201-4194. ‌ The lake is dominated by stunted yellow perch. Very small bait and hooks will catch these fish. Yellow perch fishing should be fair. Fishing bait near the submerged vegetation beds can be good for brown bullhead.‌ Fishing for warmwater fish should be good this week with continued hot weather. Fishing for largemouth bass along the many docks on the lake can be productive. The area near the lily pads on the northeast side of the lake can be good. Smallmouth bass fishing has been fair around the rocky areas northwest of the lodge.‌ You can also visit Lake of the Wood's website to observe current conditions at the lake. Scroll down and click on the right-side video link for a live video of current conditions on the lake at the Lodge. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ LINK RIVER: redband/rainbow trout‌ Fishing not recommended at this time. Fishing regulations for the Link River changed on Jan. 1, 2021. New regulations include catch-and-release for redband/rainbow trout and no bait allowed (artificial flies and lures only). This change is due to record low spawning escapement for trophy redband trout throughout the Klamath Basin in 2020.‌ Flows have increased to 1,370 cfs. Redband trout numbers in the Link River are very low. Most redband trout have moved out of the Link River.‌ Check Link River Flows.‌ ODFW also encourages the use of single barbless hooks in this fishery, not removing fish from the water and catch-and-release rubber nets. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ LOFTON RESERVOIR: hatchery rainbow trout‌ This reservoir is getting weedy, and fishing is poor. If you don't catch any fish at Lofton, I would go down to Heart Lake and try your luck there. The gravel launch is getting tough to launch small boats due to the low water. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ LONG CREEK: brook trout, redband trout, bull trout‌ Open to fishing all year. Flows will be good for fishing. Best section to fish is the lowermost Green Diamond section just above the Nature Conservancy. The meadow sections of the creek should also be good for brook trout. Grasshoppers are abundant therefore dry flies that mimic them will do well. Small black beetles have also been seen in recent stomach samples. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ LOST RIVER: largemouth bass, yellow perch, brown bullhead, tui and blue chub‌ Lost River is open year-round with bait allowed. Fishing is slow at the Crystal Springs Bridge crossing and also near the boat ramp off Crystal Springs Road. Fishing bait for brown bullhead is your best bet. Water quality is degrading quickly.‌ The river near Big Springs in Bonanza is slow. Fishing for largemouth bass at this location is your best bet. Another place to try is near Horseshoe Dam. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ MALHEUR RESERVOIR: rainbow trout‌ The Cow Valley and Durkee fires are actively burning near Malheur Reservoir. This area is under an evacuation order. Do not travel to this area until the fires have been contained. ‌ Malheur Reservoir still has plenty of water and the boat ramp is usable. Anglers have reported catching some nice holdover trout this spring. Trout stocked last season have grown quickly and there are fish available up to 20 inches right now. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ MANN LAKE: ‌ Mann Lake has filled up enough to support a fishery but has not been stocked. We are still working to re-stock with Lahontan cutthroat but the lake remains fishless. Last updated 7/3/24.‌ MILLER LAKE: brown, rainbow, brook trout and kokanee‌ The lake has been stocked with rainbow trout. Fishing from shore or boat should be slow for rainbow trout. Best fishing is from a boat for brown trout. Trolling deep is your best bet. Brown trout are eating kokanee. Kokanee rarely exceed eight inches in the lake. ‌ The area at the outlet of the lake near Miller Creek has decent dry fly-fishing for smaller brown trout. Callibaetis mayflies are hatching now. ‌ There is a nice boat ramp, sandy swim beach and campground at the lake. Mosquitoes can be bad.‌ Call the USFS in Chiloquin for more information, 541-783-4001. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ MOON RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, largemouth bass‌ Moon Reservoir was recently stocked with 5,000 rainbow trout and 580 largemouth bass. No recent reports on fishing. Warmer water might make trout fishing a little slow but bass fishing may still be good near the boat ramp. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ NORTH POWDER POND: hatchery rainbow trout‌ The pond has been stocked with rainbow trout that should be available throughout the summer months. Last updated 6/12/24.‌ OWYHEE RESERVOIR: largemouth and smallmouth bass, crappie, yellow perch, catfish‌ Owyhee Reservoir is 85 percent full, with Gordon Gulch, Indian Creek and Leslie Gulch boat ramps all open and usable. There are some older, larger crappie in the 12-inch range. Fishing for crappie can be productive if you can find them. Many crappie may be suspended in the water column right now. ‌ Channel catfish will be most concentrated in wide flats with relatively shallow water between 2 and 15 feet deep.‌ Trout fishing has been productive this spring in the lower reservoir as well. Trolling or fishing streamer flies from the bank can be effective in the lower reservoir near the forbay.‌ Anglers targeting bass may catch some with tags near the dorsal fin. ODFW is studying bass movement, condition and angler harvest of bass. The tags have a four-digit number and can be reported by phone or on MyODFW.com. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ OWYHEE RIVER (Lower): brown trout, hatchery rainbow trout‌ Fishing on the lower Owyhee River should be great. The reservoir spilled for an extended period this spring and flows are currently around 260 cfs. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ PHILLIPS RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, yellow perch‌ Phillips Reservoir is starting to drain with increased irrigation demand during the summer. Rainbow trout were stocked earlier in the year, and perch are available. ODFW sampled Phillips Reservoir the week of the Aug. 29. Perch and pikeminnow were numerous. Samplers found larger perch in deeper water. Few trout and smallmouth bass were sampled. We have not had any recent fishing reports, though. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ PILCHER AND WOLF CREEK RESERVOIRS: trout, crappie‌ We have not received any recent fishing reports for either reservoir. Both are stocked annually with fingerling rainbow trout that grow to catchable sizes. Additionally, there are crappie in both reservoirs with some fair-size fish in Wolf Creek Reservoir. Last updated 7/17/24.‌ POISON CREEK RESERVOIR (Grant County): rainbow trout‌ Recent sampling showed there are high densities of large trout in the reservoir right now. Anglers have been catching trout up to 23 inches long weighing in around 4 pounds. Flies and lures have been the more productive fishing methods in this water body recently. Productive lures include spinners, crankbaits and spoons. Productive flies include midges, damsels, leaches and probably scuds. ‌ Water temperatures will be warm so fishing may be slow.

This area is under an evacuation order so do not travel to this area until the fires have been contained. ‌ Pole Creek Reservoir filled up this spring and was stocked with 3,000 catchable rainbow trout and 15,000 fingerling rainbows. ‌ Recent sampling showed black crappie are quite abundant but most of them are very small. There are a few nice trout available in the 14– to 16-inch range. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ SEVENMILE CREEK (CANAL): brook trout, brown trout, redband trout, yellow perch‌ Open all year. Sevenmile is a very cold and clear creek and fishing for brook trout should be good if you can find them. Fishing for brook trout is best in the beaver dam pools above Nicholson Road. Most brook trout caught are less than 12 inches. ‌ Catch-and-release for redband/rainbow trout with no bait allowed from Agency Lake to Nicholson Road.‌ Anglers can access Sevenmile Creek at Nicholson Road and fish upstream of Nicholson Rd. Bait is allowed upstream of Nicholson Road. There are currently large beaver dam pools immediately upstream of the bridge. Brook trout will concentrate, therefore keep moving until you find the schools. Flows are at a good level for fishing.‌ The mouth of Sevenmile Creek at Agency Lake is picking up for yellow perch and a few largemouth bass. You can access this area by hiking two miles down the Wood River Wetland Trail. Last updated 8/3/24.‌ Check Sevenmile Creek Flows‌ SKY LAKES AND MOUNTAIN LAKE WILDERNESS: brook trout and rainbow trout (Cranebow triploids)‌ Access is available to all lakes. Fishing continues to be good in the early mornings and late evenings. Rainbow trout Rapalas, Crocodiles, Super Dupers can work really well for the larger fish. Accessing the middle of the lake with a flotation device can improve fishing success.‌ Best lakes to catch fish are Clover, Como, Harriette, Echo, Weston and South Pass in the Mountain Lakes Wilderness and Sonya, Margurette and Isherwood in the Sky Lakes Wilderness. ‌ Best lakes for brook trout are Badger Lake (Sky Lakes Wilderness), which is a short hike from Fourmile Lake, and Clover Lake (Mountain Lakes Wilderness). Please report any Brook Trout caught in other lakes. Badger and Woodpecker Lakes are accessible from Fourmile Lake.‌ Best lures are typically dark Panther Martin spinners.‌ The biggest trout come from the bigger and deeper lakes of Harriette, Isherwood, Margurette, Sonya and Wizard Lakes. ‌ Please report Brook Trout captured in Elizabeth, Little Heavenly, Big Heavenly or Isherwood Lakes. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ SPENCER CREEK: redband trout and brook trout‌ Spencer Creek is open. Spencer Creek is excellent for small redband trout up to 10 inches. This is a great area to learn to fly fish. The USFS forest service campground off Clover Creek Road is worth a try. The area below the Spencer Creek hookup road culvert is also good. Small dry flies such as elk hair caddis and stimulators work well. Last updated 7/29/24.‌ Spencer Creek Flow. ‌ SPRAGUE RIVER: redband trout, brown trout, largemouth bass, brown bullhead, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed‌ Redband trout have moved to water quality refuge areas as most of the Sprague River is very warm. Small black wooly buggers or jigs work best. In some areas grasshopper patterns can work OK.‌ Best places to fish for brown trout and redband trout are the fast water areas near Chiloquin High School, the narrows and near all the springs in Beatty. Boats can be launched at two locations above Beatty. ‌ There are a few warmwater fish in the Sprague. The dominate warmwater fish is yellow perch. A few largemouth bass are around but their population has declined. There are also small brown bullhead. The best place to fish for warmwater fish is above Saddle Mtn Pit Road Bridge to near Godowa Springs Road Bridge. Bait is allowed in this section.‌ Anglers can find several kinds of flow date here: Near Real Time Hydrographics Data. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ NORTH FORK SPRAGUE RIVER AND ALL TRIBUTARIES: redband trout, brook trout, brown trout, bull trout‌ Open year-round. The area upstream of the Elbow should be good for redband trout and brown trout. Water temperatures are perfect. Bait fishing near Lee Thomas Meadows for brook trout should be good. Fishing the beaver pond areas upstream should be productive. Grasshoppers are around in the meadow areas above and near Sandhill Crossing. Fishing dry flies can be productive. Last updated 8/13/24. ‌ NF Sprague River flows‌ SOUTH FORK SPRAGUE RIVER AND ALL TRIBUTARIES: brook trout, redband trout, brown trout, bull trout‌ Open year-round. Fishing will be good for brook trout. The area near Blaisdell has fair fishing for redband trout especially near the beaver pond areas. Brook trout fishing can be good along FS road 34 at the beaver dams just below Corral Creek. Please release adipose fin clipped BrooK Trout. Grasshopers are abundant especially below Camp Creek. Dry fly fishing will be good in this area. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ Check SF Sprague River Flows.‌ SPRING CREEK: redband trout, brook trout and brown trout‌ Spring Creek is now open. Fishing is typically very slow for most of the season. Best fishing is in October for brown trout entering to spawn. The very cold, unproductive water does not support a robust fishery. Brook and brown trout are present but hide out during the day. Last update 5/29/24.‌ SUN CREEK: brook trout, bull trout, brown trout, redband trout‌ Access to Sun Creek is open. Fishing not recommended at this time as density of fish is low. Open to fishing all year but closed to fishing for bull trout. Only bull trout occur in upper Sun Creek just above the Sun Pass Forest bridge crossing. Fishing is not recommended now as fish density remains low. Recent sampling found low numbers of brook trout, brown trout and no catchable sized redband trout. ‌ Recent sampling found low numbers of brook trout, brown trout and no catchable-size redband trout. ‌ Bull trout numbers are very high, so anglers need to know their fish species. Signs onsite show the differences between brook trout and bull trout. This article on MyODFW.com has good tips for distinguishing bull and brook trout, and their hybrids.‌ ODFW encourages release of all redband trout. The Sun Creek channel has been rerouted into the historic channel and is connected to the Wood River below Kimball State Park.‌ If you fish here, make sure you know your fish species well. If you don't know then let it go. Check stream level. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ SYCAN RIVER: brook, redband and brown trout (below marsh)‌ Open year-round. Fishing above the marsh is best for redband trout near the Rock Creek campground. Areas upstream are best for brook trout. Look for beaver dam areas for the largest and highest concentration of brook trout. Grasshoppers are abundant in the meadow areas. Large beaver dams occur near the Hanan Trailhead. Look at Google earth for the large numbers of large pools created by beavers. Numbers of fish in some areas are low due to the Bootleg Fire affects.‌ Fishing has been very slow below the marsh. ‌ Fishing below the Sycan Marsh is not recommended as most of the river has been dry most summers. Last updated 8/6/24.‌ Check Sycan River Flows.‌ THIEF VALLEY RESERVOIR: trout‌ Thief Valley has started draining as irrigation demands increase during the heat of the summer. Algae is becoming prevalent, and fishing conditions will likely deteriorate as the reservoir continues to drop. For those that do fish Thief Valley, some good-size rainbow trout are available as well as some decent-size yellow perch. Rainbow trout can be found throughout the reservoir, and anglers should look for perch in deeper water.‌ Follow this link to see the Bureau of Reclamation website listing current reservoir levels. Last updated 7/17/24.‌ UNITY RESERVOIR: trout, smallmouth bass, crappie‌ Recently, fishing at Unity Reservoir has been somewhat slow. However, this reservoir is stocked with fingerlings that grow quickly and catching 14- to 16- inch trout is not uncommon. In the spring, anglers can use a variety of techniques to catch trout, and bank anglers can be successful fishing at the state park. In addition to trout, there also are some warmwater fishing opportunities available at Unity Reservoir. ‌ ODFW sampled Unity Reservoir the week of Aug. 29. Multiple large trout were sampled along with hundreds of 6-inch black crappie and some smaller smallmouth and largemouth bass. Additionally, there is a large population of crayfish in the reservoir with many in the rocks on the dam. ‌ Follow this link to see the Bureau of Reclamation website listing current reservoir levels. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ WARM SPRINGS RESERVOIR: smallmouth bass, crappie, bullhead, perch, rainbow trout‌ Warm springs is around 70 percent full right now, both boat launches are in good shape and usable. Warm Springs Reservoir was stocked with 30,000 rainbow trout fingerlings last spring and another 60,000 this spring. No recent reports on fishing but we had some reports of anglers catching bass this fall. ‌ Recent sampling showed trout stocked last year are now in the 14-inch range. During sampling, our highest catch per unit effort for trout was north of the lower boat ramp. The reservoir is still recovering from extreme draw down in 2022 but sampling indicates there is a strong year class of age 1 bass that will provide a good fishery in a couple more years. Last updated 7/24/24.‌ UPPER WILLIAMSON RIVER: redband trout and brook trout‌ The giant Hex mayfly hatch is waning but a few are still around. These giant mayflies hatch around 9 p.m. Fishing should be only fair for redband trout due to past drought and there are few redband trout on public lands. Targeting brook trout near Deep Creek is another option. This area has some of the largest brook trout in the Klamath Basin. ‌ . Fish are looking up as the Hex hatch continues. Recent reports state that few grasshopers are around. Move until you find good concentrations of hoppers.‌ There are incredible populations of scuds in the Williamson River. Flies that look like scuds can be productive. Brook trout are also of high quality.‌ Past drought from 2020- 2022 have affected adult redband trout numbers. Flows are good for fishing. Fishing on the private pay-to-fish ranches on the Sand Creek and Yamsi Ranches should be excellent for brook trout with redband trout mixed in. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ Check Upper Williamson River Flows.‌ LOWER WILLIAMSON RIVER: redband trout, brown trout and yellow perch‌ Yellow perch fishing is excellent below and above Modoc Point. Look for deep pools and the aquatic vegetation edges.‌ Please remember no bait, no treble hooks and catch-and-release for redband trout. ‌ Numerous mayflies are hatching, therefore small pheasant tail nymphs fished on clear intermediate fly lines with fluorocarbon leaders can be effective. ‌ Redband trout have moved into the area above Chiloquin. This section has more brown trout as well. Brown trout can be targeted above and below Spring Creek. ‌ Large streamers and leech patterns are more effective lower in the river towards the mouth. Check Williamson River Flows. Last updated 8/13/24.‌ WILLOW VALLEY RESERVOIR: largemouth bass, crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, Sacramento perch.‌ ODFW and BLM have restocked the reservoir with small numbers of bass and crappie, and hundreds of pumpkinseed sunfish in 2023. ‌ Fishing for warmwater fish should be fair. This reservoir warms quickly. This fishery seems to be slow due to turbid conditions. With warmer weather this week fishing should improve.‌ Willow Valley is a very turbid, desert reservoir. The boat ramp is in good condition but there's no dock. Bass and crappie can be found at the habitat structures placed by BLM and ODFW in the past. Yellow perch are prolific in the reservoir but stunted. The Antelope Creek channel can be a good place to start for bass. The flooded aquatic plants just west of the dam is also a good bet. Last updated 7/3/24.‌ WOOD RIVER (including Petric Canal): redband, brown, brook and bull trout‌ The Wood River should continue improving for brown trout this week. Grasshoppers are around. The river remains slightly off-color due to runoff on Sun Creek and Annie Creek. Water temperature will continue warming significantly this week increasing hatches. Fishing below Weed Rd is best.‌ For brown trout the best section to fish is above Crooked Creek from boat. Fishing near Fort Creek might also be productive. Bank access is available below Weed Rd and at the USFS Day Use Area. The day use area should be fair for casting hopper and caddis patterns. The best bet from shore is below Weed Rd.‌ Large redband trout are moving into the river. ‌ Bull trout are becoming more common in the catch. Know the difference between brook trout and bull trout.

Be sure to \"know before you go\" by checking for closures or fire restrictions before heading out. You can check for the latest fire updates and closures using the links on this webpage.‌\n\nFishing during blue-green algae (cyanobacterial) blooms‌\n\nAs temperatures heat up during spring and summer, be on the watch for harmful algae blooms when recreating in Oregon lakes, rivers and reservoirs. Before you go fishing, check water quality conditions at the Oregon Health Authority website.‌\n\nFish consumption advisories‌\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority has issued consumption guidelines for various waterbodies in Oregon including the Snake and Columbia Rivers due to high levels of mercury and/or PCBs.

Please send your fishing updates to: odfw.info@odfw.oregon.gov.\n\nUpdates by waterbody\n\nAGENCY LAKE (including Straits): redband trout, yellow perch, brown trout‌\n\nOpen year-round. Likely all redband trout have moved to the mouth of the Wood River area or other water quality refuge. The algae bloom is abundant in locations. Agency Lake is terrible to fish in the wind and even harder to launch/trailer your boat at Henzel Park. Launching at Petric Park is another option. The channel at Petric can fill with aquatic vegetation. Due to abundant aquatic vegetation at the mouth area of Wood River casting lures or flies is the best method for catching redband trout. Vegetation is getting worse aslake level declines rapidly. Fishing just outside the vegetation line on the south end of the Wood River mouth is best.‌\n\nOverall fishing is fair. Some trophy redband trout are being caught. ‌\n\nCatch rates remain low due to record setting drought in the years 2020 thru 2022 resulting in poor survival of juvenile redband trout and subsequent recruitment into the adult population.‌\n\nAgency Lake regulations are catch-and-release for redband/rainbow trout with no bait allowed (artificial flies and lures only). The boundary of Agency Lake is the south end of the Straits. This change is due to record low spawning escapement for trophy redband trout throughout the Klamath Basin in 2020. ODFW also encourages the use of single barbless hooks in this fishery, not removing the fish from the water, and using catch-and-release rubber nets.‌\n\nKeep on the lookout for radio tagged redband trout. These fish must be released unharmed. The long antenna looks like fishing line coming from the abdomen. Please report any radio tagged fish. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nANA RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, hybrid bass‌\n\nThe reservoir was stocked with 2,750 legal rainbow trout at the end of July. Fishing should be good this month as the temperature of the reservoir is constant. There should be mayfly hatches that can benefit fly-fishers and fishing along the bottom with bait near the dam usually produces. The reservoir is full and all boats can launch at the ramp. There have not been any recent fishing reports, but trolling is a good option. If fishing from ODFW property on the south side of the reservoir you will need a wildlife area parking permit.‌\n\nSome fishermen have been catching hybrid bass from last year's stocking. These fish are around 10 inches and put up a good fight for their size. Casting lures and trolling have been effective. Just remember you can only keep 1 hybrid bass per day and it needs to be 15 inches long. ‌\n\nBait fishing is the proven method for catching hybrid bass, but fly-fishing and casting Rapalas are also effective when these fish are feeding. Rapalas that imitate tui chub and rainbow trout, favorite food sources for hybrid bass, are good bets for catching these fish. On sunny days you will need to fish deeper than cloudy days. Last updated 8/14/24.‌\n\nANNIE CREEK: brook trout, brown trout and redband trout‌\n\nOpen year round with bait allowed. Fishing is slow. Flows have dropped but still a little high. ‌\n\nAnnie Creek flows‌\n\nMost of the creek is dominated by small brook trout up to 10 inches. Brown trout are rare and redband trout are highly unlikely in the catch. Please report any redband/rainbow trout caught in the creek to ODFW at 541-883-5732. ‌\n\nAccess is available year-round off Hwy. 62 at the USFS snow park. Access also available south of the Snow Park off Sun Pass State Forest. There is plenty of public property on USFS, State Forest and Crater Lake National Park – fishing is regulated by the National Park (541-594-3000). ‌\n\nSeveral waterfalls occur on the creek inside Crater Lake National Park offering exceptional views. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nBECK KIWANIS POND, Ontario: trout, bluegill, largemouth bass‌\n\nFishing for bluegill should be great. Bluegill can be caught using bait such as night crawlers, worms, or grasshoppers fished under a small bobber. Artificial lures such as spinners, jigs, and flies will also be effective. Bluegill have small mouths so using a smaller hook size and downsizing bait will improve success. The pond is experiencing an algae bloom that happens annually throughout the warmer months of the year. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nBEULAH RESERVOIR: redband trout, hatchery rainbow trout, whitefish, bull trout‌\n\nBeulah Reservoir is around 70 percent full and the boat ramp is in good shape. Recent sampling indicated there are some very nice trout in Beulah right now up to 20 inches long. ‌\n\nSurface water temperatures will be warm so if you are targeting trout your best bet will be trolling in some deeper water from a boat or fishing near some of the steeper drop offs from the bank. Fishing near the inlet of the North Fork Malheur in the submerged river channel can also be productive during the heat of the summer. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nBIG ROCK RESERVOIR: hatchery rainbow trout‌\n\nFishing should still be fair, but algae and vegetation will be problematic. Try to keep your offering in the top of the water column. Bait, lures and flies are sure-fire ways to catch rainbow trout in this reservoir. Rainbow trout will continue growing this spring and summer. Water level is unknown at this time, but fish should be hungry. Last updated 7/31/23.‌\n\nBLITZEN RIVER: redband trout, carp‌\n\nThe Blitzen is flowing around 60 cfs with temperatures reaching the low 70s in the afternoon. If you are fishing during the heat of the day follow warm weather fishing guidelines to reduce stress on fish if you are catch-and-release fishing. Fishing has been fair so far this season. There are some large redband in the Blitzen right now but densities are low so you may need to cover plenty of water to find fish. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nBLUE LAKE: rainbow trout‌\n\nFishing was fantastic mid July. Trolling flies behind a float tube and casting towards rising fish were productive for fish in the 10- to 15-inch range. Using bait or casting lures can also be quite effective. The water is warm so wet wading is also an option.‌\n\nThis is a great 2.5 mile hike into the Gearhart Wilderness. Don't forget your mosquito spray! Access is available via the North Fork Sprague Trailhead and the trail Has been cleared. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nBURNS POND: trout‌\n\nBurns Pond was stocked with 7,000 legal trout in late May. No recent reports but there should still be trout available. Water temperatures are now warm so fishing early and late in the day will be most effective. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nBULLY CREEK RESERVOIR: bass, catfish, crappie, rainbow trout‌\n\nThere has recently been a large carp die off at Bully Creek Reservoir. At this time, the fish kill appears to be carp specific. If you notice other species of fish dead, dying, or in poor health please contact ODFW Hines office at 541-573-6582.‌\n\nThe reservoir is around 60 percent full and the boat ramp is in great shape. Bully Creek Reservoir was stocked with 2,000 legal rainbow trout in May.‌\n\nThere are some larger smallmouth and largemouth bass available but the majority of the bass sampled recently were less than 12 inches long. Anglers have reported catching some nice crappie this spring. There is a strong year class of age one crappie right now so expect crappie fishing to get even better in a couple of years. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nCAMPBELL LAKE: rainbow trout, brook trout‌\n\nFishing has been good for stocked trout the past couple of weeks. Trolling lures is by far the most productive during the day. There is a small boat launch at this site. Fishing from the bank can also be productive as casting lures around fallen logs. Keep moving if not successful. Last update 7/31/24.‌\n\nCAMPBELL RESERVOIR: redband trout, largemouth bass, white and black crappie, bluegill‌\n\nBLM, ODFW, and BOR stocked a total of 431 crappie in April ranging in size from 8 to 14 inches. ‌\n\n. The reservoir was dry in summer of 2022. All fish perished. ODFW and BLM have stocked many size classes of largemouth bass and a few crappie in 2023. Catch-and-release is encouraged to allow for establishment of fish populations. There might also be a few redband trout around. The reservoir is about 40 percent full. ‌\n\nThere is no boat ramp on the reservoir that occurs on public property. Most of the reservoir sits on private property. You can park close to the water and haul a small boat to water's edge on BLM property. Water is slightly turbid but better water clarity than most desert reservoirs. Best fishing near the deeper water near the willows at the dam. This can only be accessed by boat. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nCHERRY CREEK: brook trout and redband trout‌\n\nOpen all year. Water temperatures are ideal. Catch rates improving and mosquitoes are not as abundant as earlier this year. These fish are spooky and water is crystal clear.‌\n\nCherry Creek flows‌\n\nThis creek is very small; well-suited to fly-fishing. Brook trout are more abundant higher in the system. A very big fish in the creek is 10 inches. Water is crystal clear after it settles from the spring snow melt, and habitat is exceptional. ‌\n\nThe Cherry Creek trail parallels the creek and leads to many productive wilderness lakes. One of the best waterfalls in the basin is just off the trail.‌\n\nODFW encourages unlimited harvest of brook trout Recent sampling showed high densities of brook trout and redband trout lower on the creek. The redband trout in this creek are some of the prettiest around. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nCHEWAUCAN RIVER: redband trout, largemouth bass, brown bullhead‌\n\nFishing was great this past weekend for fish in the 8- to 16-inch range. Fishing with hoppers at this time of year is a lot of fun. Casting dry flies in the morning and evening while fishing throughout the water column mid-day are productive tactics. Lures will also catch fish if retrieved correctly. Plan for fishing to be a tad slow as redband populations are lower right now due to drought and recent wildfires. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nCHICKAHOMINY RESERVOIR: trout‌\n\nChickahominy is about 50 percent full right now and boat ramp and dock are in great shape. There is a prolific algae bloom in the reservoir now which can be toxic at times. Avoid swimming and keep your pets out of the water if you observe blue green algae stains on the shoreline. ‌\n\nThere are some nice holdover trout in Chickahominy up to 20 inches and fishing has been great so far this spring and early summer.‌\n\nFly-anglers have been having success with leach patterns, various nymphs, and streamers fished under an indicator or striped in.‌\n\nFishing from shore using putty bait also has been effective. Artificial lures including spinners and crankbaits have also been effective especially in the early morning and evening.‌\n\nWater temperatures are warm right now so if you plan to catch and release fish follow the warm weather fishing guidelines to avoid unintended mortality. Last updated 7/3/24.‌\n\nCORRAL CREEK (SF Sprague): brook trout and brown trout‌\n\nOpen year round. Bait is allowed. Fishing should be good at the large beaver ponds near confluence with SF Sprague River. A 10-inch brook trout would be huge for this area. There is a campground on the creek as well as very cool hiking trails in the Gearhart Mtns. No limit on brook and brown trout. Catch is typically dominated by Brook Trout with Brown Trout making up about 5% of catch. Please release adipose clipped Brook Trout. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nCOTTONWOOD MEADOW LAKE: rainbow trout, brook trout‌\n\nFishing during the summer months is usually pretty slow as vegetation and temperatures increase. Try fishing early in the morning when temps are the lowest. Trolling with flies or lures is by far the best option. Most fish are in the 8- to 12-inch range, but there are plenty of fish 16-20 inches.‌\n\nThe boat ramp near the dam is the best way to launch here. If bank fishing, try areas with less vegetation and keep your offering off the bottom. Last update 7/31/24.‌\n\nCROOKED CREEK (Klamath Co): redband trout, brook trout and brown trout‌\n\nCrooked Creek is open to fishing. Public access occurs above HWY 62. This section is typically slow for all fish. Small brook trout occur in the spring areas. Last updated 6/17/24.‌\n\nCRYSTAL CREEK redband trout and yellow perch‌\n\nThere are many small redband trout this year from 8-16 inches. No bait is allowed. Best flies are those that mimic leeches or dragonflies. ‌\n\nThere is a boat ramp at Malone Springs. Best fishing is downstream of Malone Springs. The channel above Malone Springs can fill with aquatic vegetation later in the summer. The creek is best fished from a boat. ‌\n\nYellow perch are most abundant near Pelican Bay. Fishing is best during August and September when perch are densely schooled. The creek remains full of aquatic vegetation making fishing challenging in most areas. Look for the vegetation edges for yellow perch. The beaver dam at the start of Recreation Creek off Crystal Creek was blocking boat traffic and potentially fish three weeks ago. A small cut was created to allow fish and boat traffic, but they might have it plugged again. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nCheck Crystal Creek Flow. ‌\n\nDEADHORSE LAKE: rainbow trout‌\n\nFishing has been good for stocked trout the past couple of weeks. Insect production in the lake might be affected by recent wildfires as holdover trout have been skinny. Most fish are in the west end of the lake away from the campground and boat ramp. Trolling and casting lures was the proven method while some fish were being caught from the shore. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nDEEP CREEK: redband trout‌\n\nThe headwater stretch should be fishing well right now for smaller redband and brook trout. Make sure to bring mosquito spray! The creeks associated with the upper sections of Deep Creek will also produce pan sized fish.‌\n\nCurrent river conditions are pretty low, but fishing is good for fish in the 8- to 16-inch range. With lower water, stealth is key to fool these wary trout. A recent fishing trip at the end of June proved there are multiple age classes in this area with fish up to 16 inches. Fly-fishing with nymphs is the best method to target these redband trout although a well-retrieved spinner can also catch fish. Fly-fishing with hoppers can also be a heart pounding experience right now. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nDELINTMENT LAKE: rainbow trout‌\n\nThe campground at Delintment Lake is currently closed due to the Falls Fire. Please check with Malheur National Forest for updates on this closure and other area closures due to the Falls Fire.‌\n\nDelintment Lake was stocked with 5,000 legal trout this spring. There are also some holdover trout available from last year. Fishing should be great. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nDOG LAKE: largemouth bass, yellow perch, black crappie, brown bullhead, redband trout‌\n\nThe lake is open and can be a great producer of warmwater fish in the summer. There have not been any recent fishing reports, but bass, perch and crappie can be caught right now. There is a good boat launch at this lake, but vegetation might restrict some motors. Fishing from the bank is pretty difficult in most areas. Try fishing crappie jigs under bobbers and soft plastics for bass in the shadows. Best fishing will be during the morning and evening hours. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nELKHORN MOUNTAINS HIGH LAKES: brook trout, rainbow trout‌\n\nWarmer weather has opened much of the high country. Many high lakes are now ice free or thawing. Throughout the rest of the summer, brook trout and rainbow trout can be caught in many alpine waterbodies. These fish are often aggressive feeders and can be readily caught on flies and lures. They also can make a tasty camp dinner for backpackers. Last updated 7/17/24.‌\n\nFISH LAKE (Steens Mountain): rainbow trout, brook trout‌\n\nThe Steens Loop Road is now open. Fish Lake was recently stocked with 400 trophy rainbow trout and 2,000 legal rainbows. There are still plenty of trout available and fishing has been fair. Casting a fly to rising trout may be the most effective way to catch fish. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nFORT CREEK: brown trout, redband trout, brook trout, bull trout‌\n\nFishing for brown trout can be very challenging in Fort Creek due to crystal clear water year-round. Most of the creek on private property. If you can get access, fishing is good near the confluence with the Wood River. Salmonflies were observed last week. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nFOURMILE CREEK (CANAL) (tributary to Agency Lake): brook, brown, redband trout, yellow perch‌\n\nOpen all year. Bait is allowed. Yellow perch fishing should be excellent in Fourmile Canal, if you can find them. You can access the canal by boat from launching at Henzel Park. Best fishing for perch is August and September. Aquatic vegetation is abundant in areas of Fourmile Canal.‌\n\nFishing at Fourmile Creek will be improving if you can find the concentrations of brook trout. Try the confluence with Fourmile Canal or where the Cherry Creek channel hits Fourmile Creek. A kayak can be launched at the headwaters at Fourmile Springs. There is also a beaver dam. Concentrate efforts around the dam. Flows and water levels are high. ‌\n\nFishing in the area downstream of where Fourmile Creek hits Fourmile Canal can be excellent especially with grasshopper patterns. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nCheck Fourmile Canal Flow.‌\n\nFOURMILE LAKE: hatchery rainbow trout, lake trout, kokanee, brook trout‌\n\nAccess to the lake is available. The lake is currently 14 percent full. The lake has been stocked multiple times with rainbow trout. In hot weather rainbow trout hold in deeper water that is more accessible by boat. Fishing should be slow for stocked rainbow trout. Fishing should be slow for brook trout and lake trout. Best fishing is from a boat.. Look for areas of flooded timber, tributary inputs and the large points. ‌\n\nCheck Fourmile Lake Levels.‌\n\nPlease report any kokanee caught from the lake. ‌\n\nLaunching boats becomes particularly challenging as the lake recedes. There is no official concrete boat ramp with dock. Launching takes place from a sandy shoreline. Only small boats are recommended. You can also call Lake of the Woods Resort for updates. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nGERBER RESERVOIR: white and black crappie, yellow perch, brown bullhead and largemouth bass‌\n\nFish sampling by Bureau of Reclamation this year showed incredible densities of yellow perch and some larger crappie. Use small hooks and bait for the perch as most are small with smallmouths.‌\n\nFishing should be improving for brown bullhead and yellow perch. Best place to fish for perch is at the north boat ramp. Near the Barnes Valley Boat ramp can also be worth a try if lake levels are high enough. Crappie are suspended in the main part of the reservoir or near deeper water.‌\n\nThe reservoir is 16 percent full. Call the Klamath Falls BLM office for updated information. A higher lake level improves the crappie fishery.‌\n\nGerber Reservoir water levels‌\n\nGerber Reservoir is a large turbid reservoir with good bank access. Most of the reservoir is on BLM property. Open all year. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nHEART LAKE: hatchery rainbow trout‌\n\nThere have not been any fishing reports, but fishing should be fair towards the far end of the lake. Trolling is a good option and bait fishing near the dam can be great. If fishing from the bank, try different areas around the lake. There is very little activity near the dam and fish know it. The boat ramp is horrendous, but small boats can still be launched. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nHOLBROOK RESERVOIR: hatchery rainbow trout‌\n\nThe reservoir is getting weedy and fishing has slowed down. Bank fishing is probably more productive right now. If bait along the bottom is not working try increasing your leader length or fishing bait under a bobber. The dam area is probably going to be your best bet right now. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nJ.C. BOYLE RESERVOIR (Topsy Reservoir), now Klamath River‌\n\nThe reservoir is now a river. All boat ramps are closed. The river is not accessible due to deep sediment and KRRC rules. The old reservoir will now change to the Klamath River regulations, which are: no bait allowed and one redband/rainbow trout in the 12- to 15-inch size class. Fishing will be closed June 15-Oct. 1 from Keno Dam downstream to Highway 66 Bridge. Last updated 3/6/24.‌\n\nUPPER KLAMATH LAKE: native redband trout, yellow perch, kokanee, pumpkinseed, brown bullhead, tui chub and blue chub‌\n\nThe lake is open to fishing all year. It's likely most redband trout have moved to water quality refuge. ‌\n\nBest location to fish for redband trout will be Pelican Bay, Odessa Creek, and Harriman Creek. Yellow perch fishing should be excellent in Pelican Bay, Mouth of Williamson River, Mouth of Recreation Creek.‌\n\nPlease remember that nets or traps of any type cannot be used to catch any species of fish. This includes minnows to use for bait. See page 20 of the Sport Fishing Regulations for legal harvest methods for minnows and chubs. ‌\n\nODFW encourages catch-and-release on this fishery due to record low spawning numbers in 2020 and very low numbers in 2019 and the record setting drought from 2020 thru 2022 which reduced survival. Please fight your fish quickly and then release your fish immediately without removing it from the water. Releasing fish is easier with barbless hooks.‌\n\nAs water temperatures warm please make sure that your catch has swam away strongly and into deeper water. Water temperature at the surface is much higher. White pelicans are waiting for redband trout that have been improperly handled. ‌\n\nThe lake is 3.1 feet below full pool and 51 percent full.\n\nKlamath Lake water levels‌\n\nPlease remember that once you retain your one redband/rainbow trout limit you must stop fishing for redband/rainbow trout. Also, all radio tagged redband trout must be released unharmed. Redband trout will have what looks to be fishing line coming from the abdomen. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nKLAMATH RIVER: native redband trout, rainbow trout, brown trout‌\n\nKeno Dam downstream to Hwy 66‌\n\nThe river below Keno Dam downstream to Hwy 66 is closed. The river will open again Oct. 1. Last updated 6/19/24.‌\n\nHwy 66 Bridge downstream to Springs ‌\n\nThis section of river is open year-round. Access is currently prohibited by KRRC from Hwy 66 to the dam. Removal of JC Boyle Dam has begun. Fishing not recommended in this section due to difficult access. The Powerhouse Road on the west side of the river will be closed all year. Access to the Klamath River will be available from the Topsy Grade Road or traveling through Dorris. The Topsy Grade Road can have large potholes. This section of the river will require a significant hike to the river on the east side. ‌\n\nRegulations will change Jan. 1, 2024 to a bag limit of one redband rainbow trout per day in the 12- to 15-inch size class. This is to protect large redband trout spawners, chinook, coho and steelhead smolts and Chinook salmon, coho salmon and steelhead adults. Last updated 8/6/24. ‌\n\nSprings to state line with California‌\n\nThe Frain Ranch section is not very fishable. Turbidity declining fast after the breeching of the coffer dam at JC Boyle. Take the road through Dorris to access. This section of river is open year-round. Turbidity can be tracked by visiting the USGS Real Time Klamath River Gage. ‌\n\nCurrently, turbidity is low at 38 FNU. Fishing only recommended when turbidity (FNU) is less than 40. The Powerhouse Road on the west side of the river will be closed all year. Access to the Klamath River will be available from the Topsy Grade Road or traveling through Dorris. The Topsy Grade Road can have large potholes.‌\n\nPatterns and lures that mimic crayfish, golden stoneflies, salmonfly nymphs, caddisflies and leeches should work well. Panther Martin spinners can work well down there. Dry flies that mimic caddisflies or mayflies hatching can also work well. ‌\n\nClick here for Klamath River flow and turbidity.‌\n\nRegulations changed on Jan. 1, 2024 to a bag limit of one redband-rainbow trout per day in the 12- to 15-inch size class. This regulation is to protect large redband trout spawners, Chinook salmon smolts and adults, and steelhead smolts and adults. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nKRUMBO RESERVOIR: trout, bass‌\n\nFishing for holdover trout has been great this spring. Anglers are consistently catching trout in the 17-inch range using a variety of methods. Fly-fishing with streamers from the bank has been productive, PowerBait has been working well, and trolling from a boat will also turn up a few fish.‌\n\nKrumbo was stocked with 5,000 legal-size rainbow trout in June. We saw some nice bass during recent sampling, the most productive bass fishing will be near the reservoir inlet among the rushes. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nLAKE EWAUNA-KLAMATH RIVER (Above Keno Dam to Link River): redband trout, largemouth bass, Sacramento perch, yellow perch, crappie, brown bullhead, goldfish, tui and blue chub‌\n\nFishing not recommended at this time. This stretch of river and lake has typically been an area that lacked significant fish densities to warrant much of a fishery. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the summer approach 0 mg/l in many areas thus reducing fish densities. Water quality is declining fast in this area.‌\n\nRecent sampling found good numbers of small, juvenile largemouth bass, Sacramento perch, yellow perch and even a few crappie. These findings are surprising. This is a very large area and anglers might be able to find largemouth bass and perch. Look for areas of water return from wetlands or pumps. These areas will have more oxygen and better water quality. The area near Lake Ewauna and below the Tule Smoke Hunt Club (Rat Club) are places to focus as water quality is typically better in those locations. The side channel area near the island below Hwy140 bridge might also be worth some effort. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nLAKE OF THE WOODS: hatchery rainbow trout, kokanee, hatchery brown trout, yellow perch, brown bullhead, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, crappie, tui chub‌\n\nFishing for rainbow trout is slow. Trout typically hold in 15 feet of water when water temperature are warm. Using a downrigger or heavier lines can improve catch rates. For recent fishing updates, call the resort at 1-866-201-4194. ‌\n\nThe lake is dominated by stunted yellow perch. Very small bait and hooks will catch these fish. Yellow perch fishing should be fair. Fishing bait near the submerged vegetation beds can be good for brown bullhead.‌\n\nFishing for warmwater fish should be good this week with continued hot weather. Fishing for largemouth bass along the many docks on the lake can be productive. The area near the lily pads on the northeast side of the lake can be good. Smallmouth bass fishing has been fair around the rocky areas northwest of the lodge.‌\n\nYou can also visit Lake of the Wood's website to observe current conditions at the lake. Scroll down and click on the right-side video link for a live video of current conditions on the lake at the Lodge. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nLINK RIVER: redband/rainbow trout‌\n\nFishing not recommended at this time. Fishing regulations for the Link River changed on Jan. 1, 2021. New regulations include catch-and-release for redband/rainbow trout and no bait allowed (artificial flies and lures only). This change is due to record low spawning escapement for trophy redband trout throughout the Klamath Basin in 2020.‌\n\nFlows have increased to 1,370 cfs. Redband trout numbers in the Link River are very low. Most redband trout have moved out of the Link River.‌\n\nCheck Link River Flows.‌\n\nODFW also encourages the use of single barbless hooks in this fishery, not removing fish from the water and catch-and-release rubber nets. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nLOFTON RESERVOIR: hatchery rainbow trout‌\n\nThis reservoir is getting weedy, and fishing is poor. If you don't catch any fish at Lofton, I would go down to Heart Lake and try your luck there. The gravel launch is getting tough to launch small boats due to the low water. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nLONG CREEK: brook trout, redband trout, bull trout‌\n\nOpen to fishing all year. Flows will be good for fishing. Best section to fish is the lowermost Green Diamond section just above the Nature Conservancy. The meadow sections of the creek should also be good for brook trout. Grasshoppers are abundant therefore dry flies that mimic them will do well. Small black beetles have also been seen in recent stomach samples. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nLOST RIVER: largemouth bass, yellow perch, brown bullhead, tui and blue chub‌\n\nLost River is open year-round with bait allowed. Fishing is slow at the Crystal Springs Bridge crossing and also near the boat ramp off Crystal Springs Road. Fishing bait for brown bullhead is your best bet. Water quality is degrading quickly.‌\n\nThe river near Big Springs in Bonanza is slow. Fishing for largemouth bass at this location is your best bet. Another place to try is near Horseshoe Dam. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nMALHEUR RESERVOIR: rainbow trout‌\n\nThe Cow Valley and Durkee fires are actively burning near Malheur Reservoir. This area is under an evacuation order. Do not travel to this area until the fires have been contained. ‌\n\nMalheur Reservoir still has plenty of water and the boat ramp is usable. Anglers have reported catching some nice holdover trout this spring. Trout stocked last season have grown quickly and there are fish available up to 20 inches right now. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nMANN LAKE: ‌\n\nMann Lake has filled up enough to support a fishery but has not been stocked. We are still working to re-stock with Lahontan cutthroat but the lake remains fishless. Last updated 7/3/24.‌\n\nMILLER LAKE: brown, rainbow, brook trout and kokanee‌\n\nThe lake has been stocked with rainbow trout. Fishing from shore or boat should be slow for rainbow trout. Best fishing is from a boat for brown trout. Trolling deep is your best bet. Brown trout are eating kokanee. Kokanee rarely exceed eight inches in the lake. ‌\n\nThe area at the outlet of the lake near Miller Creek has decent dry fly-fishing for smaller brown trout. Callibaetis mayflies are hatching now. ‌\n\nThere is a nice boat ramp, sandy swim beach and campground at the lake. Mosquitoes can be bad.‌\n\nCall the USFS in Chiloquin for more information, 541-783-4001. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nMOON RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, largemouth bass‌\n\nMoon Reservoir was recently stocked with 5,000 rainbow trout and 580 largemouth bass. No recent reports on fishing. Warmer water might make trout fishing a little slow but bass fishing may still be good near the boat ramp. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nNORTH POWDER POND: hatchery rainbow trout‌\n\nThe pond has been stocked with rainbow trout that should be available throughout the summer months. Last updated 6/12/24.‌\n\nOWYHEE RESERVOIR: largemouth and smallmouth bass, crappie, yellow perch, catfish‌\n\nOwyhee Reservoir is 85 percent full, with Gordon Gulch, Indian Creek and Leslie Gulch boat ramps all open and usable. There are some older, larger crappie in the 12-inch range. Fishing for crappie can be productive if you can find them. Many crappie may be suspended in the water column right now. ‌\n\nChannel catfish will be most concentrated in wide flats with relatively shallow water between 2 and 15 feet deep.‌\n\nTrout fishing has been productive this spring in the lower reservoir as well. Trolling or fishing streamer flies from the bank can be effective in the lower reservoir near the forbay.‌\n\nAnglers targeting bass may catch some with tags near the dorsal fin. ODFW is studying bass movement, condition and angler harvest of bass. The tags have a four-digit number and can be reported by phone or on MyODFW.com. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nOWYHEE RIVER (Lower): brown trout, hatchery rainbow trout‌\n\nFishing on the lower Owyhee River should be great. The reservoir spilled for an extended period this spring and flows are currently around 260 cfs. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nPHILLIPS RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, yellow perch‌\n\nPhillips Reservoir is starting to drain with increased irrigation demand during the summer. Rainbow trout were stocked earlier in the year, and perch are available. ODFW sampled Phillips Reservoir the week of the Aug. 29. Perch and pikeminnow were numerous. Samplers found larger perch in deeper water. Few trout and smallmouth bass were sampled. We have not had any recent fishing reports, though. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nPILCHER AND WOLF CREEK RESERVOIRS: trout, crappie‌\n\nWe have not received any recent fishing reports for either reservoir. Both are stocked annually with fingerling rainbow trout that grow to catchable sizes. Additionally, there are crappie in both reservoirs with some fair-size fish in Wolf Creek Reservoir. Last updated 7/17/24.‌\n\nPOISON CREEK RESERVOIR (Grant County): rainbow trout‌\n\nRecent sampling showed there are high densities of large trout in the reservoir right now. Anglers have been catching trout up to 23 inches long weighing in around 4 pounds. Flies and lures have been the more productive fishing methods in this water body recently. Productive lures include spinners, crankbaits and spoons. Productive flies include midges, damsels, leaches and probably scuds. ‌\n\nWater temperatures will be warm so fishing may be slow. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nFor reservoir elevations click here. ‌\n\nPOLE CREEK RESERVOIR: rainbow trout‌\n\nThe Cow Valley and Durkee Fire are actively burning near Pole Creek Reservoir. This area is under an evacuation order so do not travel to this area until the fires have been contained. ‌\n\nPole Creek Reservoir filled up this spring and was stocked with 3,000 catchable rainbow trout and 15,000 fingerling rainbows. ‌\n\nRecent sampling showed black crappie are quite abundant but most of them are very small. There are a few nice trout available in the 14– to 16-inch range. Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nSEVENMILE CREEK (CANAL): brook trout, brown trout, redband trout, yellow perch‌\n\nOpen all year. Sevenmile is a very cold and clear creek and fishing for brook trout should be good if you can find them. Fishing for brook trout is best in the beaver dam pools above Nicholson Road. Most brook trout caught are less than 12 inches. ‌\n\nCatch-and-release for redband/rainbow trout with no bait allowed from Agency Lake to Nicholson Road.‌\n\nAnglers can access Sevenmile Creek at Nicholson Road and fish upstream of Nicholson Rd. Bait is allowed upstream of Nicholson Road. There are currently large beaver dam pools immediately upstream of the bridge. Brook trout will concentrate, therefore keep moving until you find the schools. Flows are at a good level for fishing.‌\n\nThe mouth of Sevenmile Creek at Agency Lake is picking up for yellow perch and a few largemouth bass. You can access this area by hiking two miles down the Wood River Wetland Trail. Last updated 8/3/24.‌\n\nCheck Sevenmile Creek Flows‌\n\nSKY LAKES AND MOUNTAIN LAKE WILDERNESS: brook trout and rainbow trout (Cranebow triploids)‌\n\nAccess is available to all lakes. Fishing continues to be good in the early mornings and late evenings. Rainbow trout Rapalas, Crocodiles, Super Dupers can work really well for the larger fish. Accessing the middle of the lake with a flotation device can improve fishing success.‌\n\nBest lakes to catch fish are Clover, Como, Harriette, Echo, Weston and South Pass in the Mountain Lakes Wilderness and Sonya, Margurette and Isherwood in the Sky Lakes Wilderness. ‌\n\nBest lakes for brook trout are Badger Lake (Sky Lakes Wilderness), which is a short hike from Fourmile Lake, and Clover Lake (Mountain Lakes Wilderness). Please report any Brook Trout caught in other lakes. Badger and Woodpecker Lakes are accessible from Fourmile Lake.‌\n\nBest lures are typically dark Panther Martin spinners.‌\n\nThe biggest trout come from the bigger and deeper lakes of Harriette, Isherwood, Margurette, Sonya and Wizard Lakes. ‌\n\nPlease report Brook Trout captured in Elizabeth, Little Heavenly, Big Heavenly or Isherwood Lakes. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nSPENCER CREEK: redband trout and brook trout‌\n\nSpencer Creek is open. Spencer Creek is excellent for small redband trout up to 10 inches. This is a great area to learn to fly fish. The USFS forest service campground off Clover Creek Road is worth a try. The area below the Spencer Creek hookup road culvert is also good. Small dry flies such as elk hair caddis and stimulators work well. Last updated 7/29/24.‌\n\nSpencer Creek Flow. ‌\n\nSPRAGUE RIVER: redband trout, brown trout, largemouth bass, brown bullhead, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed‌\n\nRedband trout have moved to water quality refuge areas as most of the Sprague River is very warm. Small black wooly buggers or jigs work best. In some areas grasshopper patterns can work OK.‌\n\nBest places to fish for brown trout and redband trout are the fast water areas near Chiloquin High School, the narrows and near all the springs in Beatty. Boats can be launched at two locations above Beatty. ‌\n\nThere are a few warmwater fish in the Sprague. The dominate warmwater fish is yellow perch. A few largemouth bass are around but their population has declined. There are also small brown bullhead. The best place to fish for warmwater fish is above Saddle Mtn Pit Road Bridge to near Godowa Springs Road Bridge. Bait is allowed in this section.‌\n\nAnglers can find several kinds of flow date here: Near Real Time Hydrographics Data. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nNORTH FORK SPRAGUE RIVER AND ALL TRIBUTARIES: redband trout, brook trout, brown trout, bull trout‌\n\nOpen year-round. The area upstream of the Elbow should be good for redband trout and brown trout. Water temperatures are perfect. Bait fishing near Lee Thomas Meadows for brook trout should be good. Fishing the beaver pond areas upstream should be productive. Grasshoppers are around in the meadow areas above and near Sandhill Crossing. Fishing dry flies can be productive. Last updated 8/13/24. ‌\n\nNF Sprague River flows‌\n\nSOUTH FORK SPRAGUE RIVER AND ALL TRIBUTARIES: brook trout, redband trout, brown trout, bull trout‌\n\nOpen year-round. Fishing will be good for brook trout. The area near Blaisdell has fair fishing for redband trout especially near the beaver pond areas. Brook trout fishing can be good along FS road 34 at the beaver dams just below Corral Creek. Please release adipose fin clipped BrooK Trout. Grasshopers are abundant especially below Camp Creek. Dry fly fishing will be good in this area. Last updated 8/13/24.‌\n\nCheck SF Sprague River Flows.‌\n\nSPRING CREEK: redband trout, brook trout and brown trout‌\n\nSpring Creek is now open. Fishing is typically very slow for most of the season. Best fishing is in October for brown trout entering to spawn. The very cold, unproductive water does not support a robust fishery. Brook and brown trout are present but hide out during the day. Last update 5/29/24.‌\n\nSUN CREEK: brook trout, bull trout, brown trout, redband trout‌\n\nAccess to Sun Creek is open. Fishing not recommended at this time as density of fish is low. Open to fishing all year but closed to fishing for bull trout. Only bull trout occur in upper Sun Creek just above the Sun Pass Forest bridge crossing. Fishing is not recommended now as fish density remains low. Recent sampling found low numbers of brook trout, brown trout and no catchable sized redband trout. ‌\n\nRecent sampling found low numbers of brook trout, brown trout and no catchable-size redband trout. ‌\n\nBull trout numbers are very high, so anglers need to know their fish species. Signs onsite show the differences between brook trout and bull trout. This article on MyODFW.com has good tips for distinguishing bull and brook trout, and their hybrids.‌\n\nODFW encourages release of all redband trout. The Sun Creek channel has been rerouted into the historic channel and is connected to the Wood River below Kimball State Park.‌\n\nIf you fish here, make sure you know your fish species well. If you don't know then let it go. Check stream level. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nSYCAN RIVER: brook, redband and brown trout (below marsh)‌\n\nOpen year-round. Fishing above the marsh is best for redband trout near the Rock Creek campground. Areas upstream are best for brook trout. Look for beaver dam areas for the largest and highest concentration of brook trout. Grasshoppers are abundant in the meadow areas. Large beaver dams occur near the Hanan Trailhead. Look at Google earth for the large numbers of large pools created by beavers. Numbers of fish in some areas are low due to the Bootleg Fire affects.‌\n\nFishing has been very slow below the marsh. ‌\n\nFishing below the Sycan Marsh is not recommended as most of the river has been dry most summers. Last updated 8/6/24.‌\n\nCheck Sycan River Flows.‌\n\nTHIEF VALLEY RESERVOIR: trout‌\n\nThief Valley has started draining as irrigation demands increase during the heat of the summer. Algae is becoming prevalent, and fishing conditions will likely deteriorate as the reservoir continues to drop. For those that do fish Thief Valley, some good-size rainbow trout are available as well as some decent-size yellow perch. Rainbow trout can be found throughout the reservoir, and anglers should look for perch in deeper water.‌\n\nFollow this link to see the Bureau of Reclamation website listing current reservoir levels.

However, this reservoir is stocked with fingerlings that grow quickly and catching 14- to 16- inch trout is not uncommon. In the spring, anglers can use a variety of techniques to catch trout, and bank anglers can be successful fishing at the state park. In addition to trout, there also are some warmwater fishing opportunities available at Unity Reservoir. ‌\n\nODFW sampled Unity Reservoir the week of Aug. 29. Multiple large trout were sampled along with hundreds of 6-inch black crappie and some smaller smallmouth and largemouth bass. Additionally, there is a large population of crayfish in the reservoir with many in the rocks on the dam. ‌\n\nFollow this link to see the Bureau of Reclamation website listing current reservoir levels.

Warm Springs Reservoir was stocked with 30,000 rainbow trout fingerlings last spring and another 60,000 this spring. No recent reports on fishing but we had some reports of anglers catching bass this fall. ‌\n\nRecent sampling showed trout stocked last year are now in the 14-inch range. During sampling, our highest catch per unit effort for trout was north of the lower boat ramp. The reservoir is still recovering from extreme draw down in 2022 but sampling indicates there is a strong year class of age 1 bass that will provide a good fishery in a couple more years.

These giant mayflies hatch around 9 p.m. Fishing should be only fair for redband trout due to past drought and there are few redband trout on public lands. Targeting brook trout near Deep Creek is another option. This area has some of the largest brook trout in the Klamath Basin. ‌\n\n. Fish are looking up as the Hex hatch continues. Recent reports state that few grasshopers are around. Move until you find good concentrations of hoppers.‌\n\nThere are incredible populations of scuds in the Williamson River. Flies that look like scuds can be productive. Brook trout are also of high quality.‌\n\nPast drought from 2020- 2022 have affected adult redband trout numbers. Flows are good for fishing. Fishing on the private pay-to-fish ranches on the Sand Creek and Yamsi Ranches should be excellent for brook trout with redband trout mixed in. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nCheck Upper Williamson River Flows.‌\n\nLOWER WILLIAMSON RIVER: redband trout, brown trout and yellow perch‌\n\nYellow perch fishing is excellent below and above Modoc Point. Look for deep pools and the aquatic vegetation edges.‌\n\nPlease remember no bait, no treble hooks and catch-and-release for redband trout. ‌\n\nNumerous mayflies are hatching, therefore small pheasant tail nymphs fished on clear intermediate fly lines with fluorocarbon leaders can be effective. ‌\n\nRedband trout have moved into the area above Chiloquin. This section has more brown trout as well. Brown trout can be targeted above and below Spring Creek. ‌\n\nLarge streamers and leech patterns are more effective lower in the river towards the mouth. Check Williamson River Flows.

This reservoir warms quickly. This fishery seems to be slow due to turbid conditions. With warmer weather this week fishing should improve.‌\n\nWillow Valley is a very turbid, desert reservoir. The boat ramp is in good condition but there's no dock. Bass and crappie can be found at the habitat structures placed by BLM and ODFW in the past. Yellow perch are prolific in the reservoir but stunted. The Antelope Creek channel can be a good place to start for bass. The flooded aquatic plants just west of the dam is also a good bet. Last updated 7/3/24.‌\n\nWOOD RIVER (including Petric Canal): redband, brown, brook and bull trout‌\n\nThe Wood River should continue improving for brown trout this week. Grasshoppers are around. The river remains slightly off-color due to runoff on Sun Creek and Annie Creek. Water temperature will continue warming significantly this week increasing hatches. Fishing below Weed Rd is best.‌\n\nFor brown trout the best section to fish is above Crooked Creek from boat. Fishing near Fort Creek might also be productive. Bank access is available below Weed Rd and at the USFS Day Use Area. The day use area should be fair for casting hopper and caddis patterns. The best bet from shore is below Weed Rd.‌\n\nLarge redband trout are moving into the river. ‌\n\nBull trout are becoming more common in the catch. Know the difference between brook trout and bull trout. This article on MyODFW.com can help. Last updated 8/13/24. ‌\n\nCheck Wood River Flows‌\n\nYELLOWJACKET RESERVOIR: trout ‌"
