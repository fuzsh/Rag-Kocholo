        "text": "The Western Fishing District includes all waters in Montana west of the Continental Divide.\n\nColumbia River Basin â Inspection Prior to Launch: All watercraft crossing the Continental Divide into the Columbia River Basin are required to be inspected prior to launch.\n\nFor additional information about fishing in this district, please call the following regional headquarters Monday-Friday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.:\n\nKalispell....................................................... 406-752-5501\n\nMissoula....................................................... 406-542-5500\n\nFWP Headquarters......................................... 406-444-2449\n\nHearing Impaired (use Montana Relay).......7-1-1 or 1-800-253-4091\n\nWestern District Standard Regulations\n\nBeaver Ponds: Beaver ponds on streams are governed by the same regulations that govern the streams.\n\nBoat and Motor Restrictions: All passengers under the age of 12 must wear a personal floatation device (PFD) at all times when theboat is in motion if the boat is less than 26 feet long. A wearable, U.S. Coast Guard approved PFD must be available for each occupant ofany boat.\n\nClosed Waters: Waters operated as fish hatcheries and rearing ponds by FWP and the US Fish & Wildlife Service shall be closed to fishingat all times. Waters in which FWP operates fish traps and other structures are closed to fishing as posted. Certain water-supply lakes,streams and hazardous areas are also closed as posted.\n\nDam Closures and Use Restrictions: In the interest of public health and safety, certain areas above and below most dams are closed to the public. These restrictions include areas where no public access is allowed below the ordinary high-water mark. Therestricted areas are identified and delineated by signs and/or boat restraining systems.\n\nThe following dams are closed to all boating, sailing, floating, swimming, fishing or other recreational activity as marked by boatrestraining systems or as posted to restrict access. Other dams not listed here may also be posted for restricted access. For more information call the FWP Fishing Access Coordinator at 406-444-2449, or contact the Army Corp of Engineers (ACOE) 406-293-7751, x255, AVISTA 1-800-227-9187, Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) 406-387-5241, CSKT 406-883-2888, Northwestern Energy (NWE) 888-467-2669 or PacificCorp Energy 503-813-6666.\n\nBig Fork Dam (PacifiCorp, Lake County)\n\nHungry Horse Dam (BOR, Flathead County)\n\nKerr Dam (CSKT, Lake County)\n\nLibby Dam (ACOE, Lincoln County)\n\nNoxon Rapids Dam (AVISTA , Sanders County)\n\nFlathead Indian Reservation: A tribal permit is required to fish on waters within the boundary of the Reservation. Call tribal headquarters at 406-675-2700 for information.\n\nIrrigation Canals and Ditches: Man-made irrigation canals and ditches are open to fishing year round unless stated otherwise in exceptions to standard regulations. The same daily and possession limits apply to them as for rivers/ streams. Anglers need to be awarethat the Montana Stream Access Law does not apply to canals and ditches. Under Montanaâs trespass law, permission to access these waters is implied if the land is not posted, but that implied permission may be revoked at any time. It is best to obtain the explicit permission of the landowner. Where ditches cross land belonging to others, rights of the ditch owner versus those of thelandowner vary. Therefore, always obey any sign clearly marking the ditch as closed to public access or fishing.\n\nReservoirs: Under normal operations, reservoir pool elevation, surface acreage and the mouths of the inlet stream(s) are expected to vary throughout the year. An imaginary line connecting the reservoir shoreline across the mouth of the stream marks the boundarybetween reservoir and stream/river, and the boundary will move as reservoir levels change. Streams are defined by a sloped streambedthat results in a defined current flow between two discernible stream banks. Stream regulations apply upstream from the mouth of thereservoir and often are managed under seasons, limits and special regulations that differ from the reservoir regulations.\n\nSloughs: Sloughs with surface water connecting to a river at any time during the year fall under the river regulations for that river, unless listed under the exceptions. Sloughs with no surface water connecting to a river at any time during the year fall under standard lake limits unless listedunder the exceptions.\n\nTransporting Live Fish: An import permit is required to bring live fish into Montana (see page 89). It is unlawful to possess or transport live fish away from the body of water in which the fish were taken except for transportation of fish for valid (approved)commercial purposes or as authorized by FWP.\n\nMethods of Taking Fish\n\nA valid Fishing License is required for all types of fishing.\n\nSpears and bows count as lines for purposes of determining line limits.\n\nAll unattended fishing devices (crayfish traps, minnow traps, fish traps, setlines, etc.) must have the anglerâs name and phonenumber or name and an individual identifying number issued by the department.\n\nHook and Line Limits\n\nOpen Water\n\nRivers and Streams\n\n1 line with 2 hooks per line, with or without a rod. The rod or line must be attended and in the anglerâs immediate control.\n\nLakes and Reservoirs\n\n2 lines with 2 hooks per line, with or without a rod. Each line must be attended and in the anglerâs immediate control.\n\nIce Fishing\n\nLakes and Reservoirs\n\n2 lines with 2 hooks per line on all lakes and reservoirs open to fishing. When a line is used through the ice, the angler need notbe in immediate control but must be in the vicinity and in visual contact with the line.\n\nSize of Hole\n\nIn waters not open to spearing, the maximum size hole that may be used for ice fishing is 144 square inches or 12 inches indiameter.\n\nThere is no size limit for a hole used for fishing with a spear.\n\nShelters: It is unlawful to use any ice fishing shelter not conforming to the following rules:\n\nDefinition/Use: Any hut or enclosure constructed of any material, except ice or snow, for the purpose of ice fishing.\n\nIdentification: Identification must be painted on or otherwise affixed to all unattended shelters in legible, 2-inch letters plainly visible at a distance of 100 feet. Identification must include the ownerâs name and address, name and phone number, or anindividual identifying number issued by the department. Attended shelters at Brownâs Lake and Georgetown Lake must also beidentified.\n\nInspection: Each closed shelter shall have a door that an officer may readily open from the outside for inspection when it is occupied.\n\nWaste and Rubbish Disposal: Owners and occupants of shelters are required to keep their shelters (and the area immediatelyaround them) free from rubbish and trash. Anglers must remove waste materials before they leave for the day.\n\nRemoval: Daily removal of shelters is required on:\n\nBrowns Lake (near Ovando)\n\nEcho Lake (near Anaconda)\n\nGeorgetown Lake\n\nRemoval After the Season: The owner of an ice fishing shelter shall remove it from the ice before it becomes irretrievable at the end ofthe season, or within five days from receipt of notification from FWP to remove the shelter.\n\nBow and Arrow: All waters are closed to bow-and-arrow taking of game and non-game fish, except as noted under DistrictExceptions.\n\nCrossbows: Unlawful.\n\nNets and Traps: Landing nets may be used for landing hooked fish. See Bait Regulations for use of nets to harvest bait fish.\n\nSetlines: Setlines (unattended lines) are not allowed in the Western Fishing District.\n\nSnagging: All waters are closed to snagging of game and non-game fish, except as otherwise noted under District Exceptions.\n\nSpearing: All waters are closed to spearing of game and non-game fish except as otherwise noted under District Exceptions.\n\nUse of Attractor: A bead fixed on a line or leader two inches or less from the eye of a bare hook is considered an artificial lure.Fishing with a bead more than two inches from the eye of a bare hook or artificial fly is considered snagging and is unlawful.\n\nBait Regulations\n\nNo fish species may be used as live bait in the Western Fishing District. Possession of live bait fish or use of live bait fish isprohibited in the Western Fishing District.\n\nIt is unlawful to release live bait of any kind into Montana waters; do not empty any live bait containers at your fishing site.\n\nOnly non-game fish native to the Western Fishing District (Large Scale Sucker, Longnose Sucker, Northern Pikeminnow, Peamouth Chub, Redside Shiner, Longnose Dace) may be captured and used as dead bait and may be taken for use as deadbait in the following manner:\n\nwith hook and line; or\n\nwith seines no larger than 12 feet x 4 feet; or\n\nwith minnow traps (the dimensions shall not exceed 24 inches x 12 inches x 12 inches); or\n\nwith cast nets (maximum 6-foot radius) and dip nets (no larger than 3 feet x 3 feet).\n\nDead Bait\n\nTrout, Salmon, Whitefish, and Sculpins may not be used whole or in parts/pieces as dead bait.\n\nThe eggs of Char, Cisco, Arctic Grayling, Salmon or Trout may be used as bait. Other parts/pieces of Salmonids may not beused as bait.\n\nOnly non-game fish native to the Western Fishing District (Large Scale Sucker, Longnose Sucker, Northern Pikeminnow, Peamouth Chub, Redside Shiner, Longnose Dace) may be captured and used as dead bait.

Anglers who import leeches must have in theirpossession a bill- of-sale (a receipt) from the approved out-of-state leech dealer when fishing with leeches in Montana. A list of approved out-of-state leech dealers may be obtained from FWP by calling 406-452-6181.\n\nGeneral Regulations\n\nPossession limit means the number of fish that you may possess at any time in any form: fresh, stored in freezers or lockers, salted,smoked, dried, canned or otherwise preserved. It is unlawful to preserve fish (salted, smoked, dried, canned, or otherwise preserved) before taking them to your permanent residence (the physical abode or structure you maintain as your principal, legal residence) unlessthose fish can be counted. Mobile recreational vehicles, travel trailers, tents or storage/freezer lockers do not qualify as permanentresidences. No person may sell or take for the purpose of sale any fish except as authorized in commercial fishing regulations.\n\nDaily limit means the number of fish you may legally take during a calendar day. It is unlawful to exceed the standard daily limit unlessthe regulations for the water body where you are fishing specify a different limit. âLegally takenâ means fish caught and not immediatelyreleased alive. Where catch-and-release is allowed, fish immediately released alive are considered not taken. A fish when landed andnot immediately released becomes part of the daily limit of the person originally hooking the fish, even if the fish is donated to another person. If you receive fish from another angler, those fish also become part of your daily limit. You may possess the daily limit allowed only for the body of water on which you are fishing.\n\nHandling and Transporting Legally Taken Fish\n\nWhile a person is fishing, or while on the water or on the ice:\n\nAll fish in possession must be visibly identifiable to species.\n\nAll fish in possession must be whole with head, skin, fins and tail attached. Gills and entrails may be removed (see Disposal of DeadFish and Fish Entrails on page 16).\n\nThis doesnât prohibit the consumption of fish on the ice or water. However, the fish consumed are part of your daily limit.\n\nOnce off the water or ice, fish may be dressed and filleted for transport to your permanent residence, unless size limits apply, under thefollowing conditions:\n\nAll fish can be counted and identified. Two fillets will be counted as one fish. If the catch is frozen prior to transport, each fish or fillet must be packaged so it can be counted.\n\nSalmonids (Trout, Salmon, Arctic Grayling, Char and Whitefish): the entire skin must be attached to the fillet for identification.\n\nGeneral Fishing Seasons and Hours\n\nFishing Hours\n\nFishing is allowed at all hours during open fishing seasons unless otherwise specified in District Exceptions to StandardRegulations.\n\nFishing Season: Rivers and Streams\n\nOpen third Saturday in May through November 30 unless otherwise specified in District Exceptions to Standard Regulations.\n\nFishing Season: Lakes and Reservoirs\n\nOpen entire year unless otherwise specified in District Exceptions to Standard Regulations.\n\nWestern District Standard Daily and Possession Limits\n\nEach angler may take all of the limits listed in the chart, unless otherwise noted in the Western District Exceptions. For species not listed, there areno limits on the number of fish that may be taken or possessed. Check for exceptions to the standard regulations in the following pages.\n\nAnglers who move from one fishing water to another may possess the limit of fish allowed only for the water on which they are currently fishing.\n\nWestern District Exceptions To Standard Regulations\n\nCheck the following list of waters for the body of water you intend to fish in the Western District.
