        "text": "Imagine yourself floating on calm, crystal clear waters with a picturesque mountain range in the far distance and a beautiful, dense conifer forest surrounding the lake shore. The water is glacier cold, but the bright sun is warming. From your vessel, the peaceful sounds of nature surround you. You may hear the rustling of a ground squirrel on the shore or the quiet sound of a fish jumping from out of the water. This image may seem like a dream, but for guests who stay at Mountain Meadow RV Park, this is a reality. Just ten miles from our secluded RV Park is Glacier National Park, a national park known for its outdoor recreational opportunities. Beyond Glacier National Park, Northwest Montana offers an abundance of water access points to kayak. Here are a few of our favorite lakes to kayak in Montana.\n\nLake McDonald\n\nLake McDonald is the largest lake in Glacier National Park. At 10 miles long, there are plenty of small beaches and historical landmarks to discover along the shore. Load your vessel into the water at Apgar or Lake McDonald Lodge (don't forget to grab a boating permit). Each location on the lake provides visitors with beautiful views and exciting adventures.\n\nLake Five\n\nLake Five is less than fifteen minutes from Mountain Meadow RV Park. With public access available at Paul's Fishing Access, you can enjoy the quaint beauty of Lake Five for free. Private homes surround the lake, and many locals use this location for fishing and swimming.\n\nLion Lake\n\nJust two miles from our Hungry Horse campground is Lion Lake. So close to our property, this lake is practically in our backyard. Lion Lake is a small, tranquil lake surrounded by modest mountains and a relatively easy walking trail; this location is ideal for a quick adventurous getaway.\n\nHungry Horse Reservoir\n\nLocated past the Hungry Horse Dam is the Hungry Horse Reservoir. Land behind the dam is a wilderness lover's dream. Stop by the Glacier View ranger station in Hungry Horse for maps of this vast outdoor recreational paradise.\n\nWhitefish Lake\n\nIn the town of Whitefish, about twenty scenic miles from Mountain Meadow RV Park is Whitefish Lake. With views of the ski runs on Whitefish Mountain and rolling mountains surrounding the lake, it's an ideal location to kayak and enjoy other water sports.\n\nFlathead Lake\n\nFlathead Lake is a massive body of water. As the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi, it provides many locations to kayak. At thirty miles long, this water giant can be intimidating. State parks around the lake are perfect access points to get in and out of the water.\n\nInterested in kayaking Northwest Montana's lovely mountain lakes? Mountain Meadow RV Park offers kayak rentals, so you don't have to worry about the hassle of bringing your vessel from home. If you bring a boat of your own, please remember to help Montana by preventing the spread of aquatic invasive species and get your boat inspected before launching. Just stop by our camp store for more information or contact us today.\n\n*Kayaking can be a dangerous water sport. Always wear proper safety gear. Dress appropriately. Be aware of current weather conditions. Consult a professional before kayaking to learn the basics and safety precautions of kayaking. Be bear aware. Always have your bear spray nearby and know how to use it. Have a map of lake access points."
