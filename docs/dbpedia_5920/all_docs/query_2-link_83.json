        "text": "Santa Margarita Lake Recreation & Natural Area\n\nCreated by the construction of the Salinas Dam in 1941, Santa Margarita Lake was originally designed to furnish water to Camp San Luis Obispo. Today, swimming in the lake is not permitted as it is the drinking water reservoir for the City of San Luis Obispo.\n\nBeyond the developed area of the park, Santa Margarita Lake Natural Area represents several thousand acres of designated open space. This section of the park is managed for its natural resource values, passive recreational use, and environmental education opportunities. The area is accessible to hikers, bicyclists and equestrians. Motor vehicles are not permitted in the Natural Area. Santa Margarita Lake is a nature lover’s retreat. With thousands of acres of unspoiled open space, the park is home to countless species of plants and wildlife making it the perfect location for nature study, boating, and fishing.\n\nQuagga Mussel Notice:\n\nWe are conducting boat inspections at both Santa Margarita Lake and Lopez Lake. The following link will provide information regarding invasive species that could affect both these lakes.

Campsites are located in the Coyote, Roadrunner, Grey Pine, and Osprey campgrounds. The Sapwi and Khus campgrounds are primitive boat-in sites that can be reserved by individuals or groups (up to five sites maximum). There are coin-operated shower facilities available.\n\nFishing / Boating\n\nSanta Margarita Lake is known for its excellent fishing and peaceful boating atmosphere.

The park also has a vast range of hiking and riding trails offering breath-taking views of the lake and surrounding mountains.\n\nSwimming Pool\n\nDue to a shortage of lifeguards, the pool will be open on a limited schedule.
