While Santa takes it easy at the north pole, his agents the toy manufacturers are arguing, hotly with the office of stabilization. Hanging in the balance is the cost of skates for Tim and a doll for Mary next Yuletide. OPS told about it in a press release Saturday: Up to now, toys have been under the general freeze, their prices fixed at last January's levels. OPS says that effective July 2 they must be priced by 8 different system .\n\nThis will fix ceiling prices at about mid1950 levels with cost increases since then. Santa and his agents prefer the freeze. Oddly enough, they protest their ceiling prices actually would be forced up by the new system. Moreover, they say they've already shipped half their toys for next Christmas, and changing pricing methods now would spell confusion. OPS scoffs at these arguments .\n\nIt told the toymakers that some of their number disregarded President Truman's request to keep prices down prior to last November and that their price-boosting gave them a \"tremendous advantage\" over competitors when the freeze went on. The new system will iron out such inequities, forcing some big manufatcurers to reduce prices, OPS contended. The agency declared it would stand firm. So if Santa wants to stay under the freeze he'd better hop down from the north pole and apply some heat. BACK FROM KENTUCKY Hamilton .\n\nMr. and Mrs. S. A.
