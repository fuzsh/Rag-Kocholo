        "text": "Located 15 miles south of the entrance to Glacier National Park from Highway 2, Hungry Horse Reservoir is a 34 mile long reservoir noted more for its water recreation sports than for fishing. Nonetheless, anglers targeting smaller cutthroats in secluded bays with beautiful beaches and stunning scenery do well from May until October. Bull trout can not be targeted and must be released if caught. Whitefish is the other species found in the reservoir. The South Fork of the Flathead drainage and Hungry Horse Reservoir is one of the few watersheds in Montana where healthy populations of Bull trout and Westslope cutthroats exist without the threat of non-native trout species.\n\nTwo roads encircle the reservoir and lead to Spotted Bear Ranger Station and the trailhead to the South Fork of the Flathead River in the Bob Marshall Wilderness. Road #895 follows the west side of the reservoir and passes over Hungry Horse Dam. The first eleven miles to the Lid Creek Campground is paved. On the eastern side of the reservoir, Road #38 is also a primary road leading to Spotted Bear. No gas is available after you leave the town of Hungry Horse.\n\nThe reservoir offers 10 boat ramps scattered around the reservoir. The longest ramp on the east side for draw-downs of 130 feet is the Abbot Bay Launch. The west side provides a boat launch for a 73-foot draw-down at Lost Johnny Point. Fourteen campgrounds ring the reservoir, along with many undeveloped, dispersed campsites. (See Access Points below map.)\n\nFor more information call the Hungry Horse District Office at (406) 387-3800.\n\nAccess Points and Campgrounds / West Side\n\nMileage Distance for the Westside Road\n\nMM 0: Hungry Horse Dam.\n\nDoris Boat Landing .
