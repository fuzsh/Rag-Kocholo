The Tribes or a prospective lessee dissatisfied with a decision of the Board made pursuant to this Article IV.B.7.g may appeal that decision by filing a petition for judicial review with a Court of Competent Jurisdiction within 30 days of the issuance of the Board’s decision. The court shall review the Board’s decision for abuse of discretion.\n\nC. Exercise of Certain Portions of the Tribal Water Right Related to the FIIP.\n\n1. Priority for the Exercise of the FIIP Instream Flow and FIIP Water Use Rights. Once the water rights described in Article III.C become enforceable, the following relative priorities among those rights shall apply:\n\na. Minimum Enforceable Instream Flows.\n\nb. Minimum Reservoir Pool Elevations.\n\nc. River Diversion Allowances.\n\nd. Target Instream Flows.\n\n2. Reallocated Water in excess of Target Instream Flows will be split as equally as hydrologically practicable between the Instream Flow water rights set forth in Article III.C.1.d.ii and the FIIP Water Use Right set forth in Article III.C.1.a.\n\n3. MEF and TIF implementation and schedule. Exercise of FIIP Instream Flow Rights set forth in Article III.C.1.d.ii shall be accomplished through the implementation and enforcement of MEFs and TIFs and is subject to the Shared Shortage and Adaptive Management provisions set forth in Article IV.E and F and Appendix 3.5.\n\na. MEFs and TIFs shall be enforceable at the values set forth in Appendix 3.1.\n\nb. Implementation and enforceability of MEFs and TIFs.\n\ni. Incremental implementation of Operational Improvements will result in additional FIIP Instream Flow.\n\nii. MEFs and TIFs shall be enforceable following the completion of Operational Improvements according to the schedule attached hereto as Appendix 3.4.\n\niii. Reallocated Water from Rehabilitation and Betterment Projects shall be used to incrementally achieve FIIP Instream Flows set forth in Article III.C.1.d.ii.\n\niv. If the schedule attached hereto as Appendix 3.4 cannot be met due to lack of available funding or other circumstances outside of the control of the Parties or Project Operator, the Parties may agree to adjust the schedule as necessary to allow for timely implementation of MEFs and TIFs. Such modifications are pursuant to, and shall not be deemed an amendment of, this Compact.\n\nv. If the Project Operator fails to implement the schedule attached hereto as Appendix 3.4 due to acts, errors, or omissions of the Project Operator, MEFs and TIFs will be enforceable as though the schedule had been implemented.\n\nc. Until an MEF has become enforceable, the interim Instream Flow, where applicable, for that location shall be the enforceable Instream Flow. Where the Instream Flow has been incrementally increased above the interim Instream Flow level as a result of the partial completion of actions listed in the Implementation Schedule attached hereto as Appendix 3.4, the incrementally achieved level may be maintained until the MEF is achieved.\n\nd. Until a Minimum Reservoir Pool Elevation has become enforceable, the interim reservoir pool elevation, where applicable, for that location shall be enforced.\n\ne. TIFs shall be determined seasonally according to Appendix 3.5, and will vary between the wet and normal year levels attached hereto as Appendix 3.1.\n\n4. Minimum Reservoir Pool Elevations. Minimum Reservoir Pool Elevations attached hereto as Appendix 3.1 shall be enforceable according to the schedule specified in Appendix 3.4. Enforceability of Minimum Reservoir Pool Elevations is subject to Article IV.E, Appendix 3.5, and superseding Federal law allowing for regulation of reservoir elevations.\n\nD. Exercise of the FIIP Water Use Right.\n\n1. FIIP Water Use Right.\n\na. The FIIP Water Use Right shall be satisfied by meeting the RDA values for each RDA Area attached hereto as Appendix 3.2 and as evaluated pursuant to Article IV.D.1.e.\n\nb. RDAs shall be enforceable according to the schedule attached hereto as Appendix 3.4, subject to evaluation pursuant to Article IV.D.1.e.\n\nc. Headworks diversion amounts shall be progressively adjusted to achieve the RDAs as Operational Improvements are completed pursuant to Appendix 3.4.\n\nd. Once RDAs are achieved through completion of Operational Improvements, headworks diversion amounts shall be progressively adjusted as Rehabilitation and Betterment is completed pursuant to Appendix 3.6. The enforceable RDA for the location in which a particular Rehabilitation and Betterment project has been completed is the amount defined in Appendix 3.2, reduced by the volume of Reallocated Water made available by that Rehabilitation and Betterment project. The amount actually diverted may be adjusted pursuant to the evaluation process described in Article IV.D.1.e.\n\ne. RDA values shall be evaluated to ensure their adequacy to meet Historic Farm Deliveries. Initial evaluation of RDAs shall occur once the Parties and Project Operator have completed all Operational Improvements in a given RDA Area according to the schedule attached hereto as Appendix 3.4. Evaluation of RDAs will continue as part of the responsibilities of the CITT described in Appendix 3.5 as follows:\n\ni. The Project Operator must measure and record farm turnout deliveries within a given RDA Area.\n\nii. If the aggregate measured deliveries to farm turnouts do not meet Historic Farm Deliveries for a given RDA Area, actual diversions shall be adjusted to assure that Historic Farm Deliveries are met for wet, normal and dry water years. If water in excess of the RDA is needed to meet Historic Farm Deliveries, it will be provided through an increase of the Flathead River pumping plant diversion allowed by the Flathead Pumping Station RDA attached hereto as Appendix 3.2. If the aggregate measured deliveries to farm turnouts exceed Historic Farm Deliveries within an RDA Area, the actual diversions shall be reduced accordingly.\n\niii. Any adjustment of actual diversions pursuant to this section shall not result in decrease of the MEFs, TIFs, or Minimum Reservoir Pool Elevations.\n\nf. RDAs are quantified for wet, normal, and dry Natural Flow years, attached hereto as Appendix 3.2, and shall be set each year according to the process specified in Appendix 3.5.\n\n2. FIIP Delivery Entitlement Statement. Assessed land within the FIIP is entitled to have water delivered by the Project Operator if the FIIP customer is in compliance with the applicable BIA rules and guidelines for FIIP.
