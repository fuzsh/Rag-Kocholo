        "text": "Hey Guys!\n\nThis post continues our time in Glacier National Park.\n\nRead Days 1-3 here, Day 4 here, Day 5 here, Day 6 here, Day 7 here – Read my post on 101 Things to do Outside of the Park here & Read my posts from when we went back to the park in 2021 to see the East side here.\n\nToday is our last full day in the park so we decided to take it easy and not do too much.\n\nWe started our morning with coffee on the patio admiring the beautiful Lake McDonald.\n\nOf course, I had to take a few more hundred pics of the lake before we went home! 😉\n\nI spotted more of those tiny fish swimming around.\n\nThe rocks are so colorful!!\n\nAfter our coffee, we decided we would head back up to the Hungry Horse Dam and drive further past the dam this time.\n\nThe road is actually a scenic loop drive. The entire loop is approx. 112 miles mostly on gravel road with no services other than Forest Service Campgrounds and boat launches.\n\nVisitors often access from the west side, which is paved for the first 11 miles to Lid Creek.\n\nThe loop ushers you along the shores of Hungry Horse Reservoir and across the South Fork of the Flathead River. The area offers access to a multitude of hiking, fishing, water recreational activities and camping.\n\nOn this drive you have scenic overlooks, wildlife viewing, campsites, boat launches & more..it also makes for an exceptional fall foliage scenic drive.\n\nHungry Horse Dam is 564-feet and is Montana’s highest controlling flooding on Flathead and Columbia Rivers.\n\nThere is a visitor center nearby and tours are available in the summer months.\n\nThe drive is truly beautiful!\n\nWe spotted an old eagle’s nest and nearby was an Osprey perched on a tree limb.\n\nViews of the dam from a distance\n\nAter driving about 15 miles of the road, we turned around and headed to the Huckleberry Patch for lunch.\n\nI ordered the cheeseburger ($10) and my hubby ordered the french dip ($12)…both came with fries. The food was average.\n\nBefore we left, we ordered a slice of that famous Huckleberry pie!\n\nAfter we ate, we did a little shopping in the gift shop that’s attached to the restaurant.\n\nAfter leaving here, we decided we would drive down the Going to the Sun road and spend a couple of hours relaxing by Lake McDonald.\n\nAs soon as we arrived, we ate our yummy huckleberry pie!\n\nWe decided we would take a swim in the ice cold water …it was freezing!! The temperature of most lakes in the park never gets above 50 degrees F.\n\nLake McDonald is Glacier National Park’s biggest lake; ten miles long and 472 feet deep.\n\nAfter getting out of the water, we laid out in the sun to warm up!\n\nWe somehow managed to get the place all to ourselves! So peaceful.\n\nI spotted lots of berries nearby.\n\nAfter spending a couple of hours here, we headed back to our room to relax for a while before heading to dinner.\n\nLater, we headed back to Josephine’s for those yummy bison gyros! This was our 3rd night in a row eating here.\n\nRead reviews here\n\nAfter dinner, we decided to head back into the park and watch the sunset.\n\nThe sun was lighting up the mountain peaks!\n\nHeading through the first tunnel..there are two tunnels on the Sun Rd that you will drive through…The East Side Tunnel is 408 feet long, while the West Side Tunnel is 192 feet in length.\n\nOn the way up to Logan pass, we spotted the moon.\n\nAs usual, I was taking tons of pics!!\n\nA shot of Haystack Creek Falls\n\nMore shots along the way\n\nA shot of Triple Arches Bridge….built in 1927, it’s one of the most unique bridges along Going-to-the-Sun Road.\n\nWe decided to pullover before Logan Pass to watch the sunset.\n\nThe views were spectacular!\n\nThere was a small waterfall nearby.\n\nThe sun was starting to set behind the mountains…so beautiful!\n\nI highly recommend you visit the park during sunrise and sunset!\n\nAfter leaving here, we continued our drive up to Logan Pass.\n\nWe pulled over at the Oberlin Pass Overlook...this pull out offers a short board walk to a raised wooden platform that gives stunning views of Going to the Sun Rd and Mt. Oberlin.\n\nThere were mountain goats in the parking lot! They were licking the pavement…not sure why.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see the Highline Trail above the Going to the Sun Road.\n\nThe views were incredible!\n\nWe then headed for the parking area at Logan Pass..\n\nWe walked a little ways up the Hidden Lake Overlook trail to take a few pictures.\n\nAfter leaving here, we headed back to our hotel..\n\nOn the way, we pulled over so I could photograph the moon sitting on top of the mountain!\n\nAfter arriving back to our hotel, we sat outside to watch the stars. I had downloaded an app called Nightcap…it allows you to photograph the stars, milky way & the aurora with an iPhone. The cost is $2.99 and worth it! It records also.\n\nThe next morning, we cooked breakfast in the room and sat outside on the patio before packing up and heading home.\n\nI’m definitely going to miss these views!!\n\nWe had to get someone to snap our picture before we checked out!\n\nA few shots of the hotel\n\nAfter checking out, we headed to Kalispel for lunch…we ended up eating at Panera Bread.\n\nAfter lunch, we headed to the airport…the airport is very small…we had to walk outside and up some stairs to board the plane.\n\nThe plane had very few people on it! It was great! 🙂\n\nShots from the plane\n\nWe had a layover at Dallas so we decided to find somewhere to eat dinner…we ended up eating at TGI Fridays.\n\nI ordered salmon ($18) and the hubby ordered a burger ($12.50)…the food was really good.\n\nLater we boarded our plane and headed home.\n\nThanks for reading!!\n\nI hope this helps you plan your own trip to Glacier National Park.\n\nRead Days 1-3 here, Day 4 here, Day 5 here, Day 6 here & Day 7 here."
