        "text": "The Hungry Horse Dam is one of the coolest dams we’ve ever seen! Check it out today.\n\nThere is a lot of history, benefits, and even fishing opportunities for you and the kids. You won’t want to miss out on this cool viewing area of the Flathead River and the 25 mountain peaks that surround it.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hungry Horse Dam was named after two horses named Tex and Jerry who pulled wagons in the oil rush in 1900-1901. They were caught in the winter snow, starving, before their handler found them and nursed them back to health. When the dam was being built the story and the name stuck with the Flathead Valley people, and so it became known as Hungry Horse Dam. It was originally built as a wartime production site; however, it was not completed until after World War II was finished.\n\nIt took 5 years to build due to the safety of the construction worker. The dam stands at 564 feet tall which is one of the highest dams in the United States of its type. The Glory hole spillway that was created from the dam, is a 490-foot drop for water which is the highest water drop in the world! You won’t want to miss out on the opportunity to see it while staying at Three Bears RV Park. It is also 15 miles from the entrance of Glacier National Park, so you can see both in one day! Check out their website to book a tour today!\n\nDam Benefits\n\nThe dam has many benefits to Kalispell and the surrounding areas. Unlike some other reclamation dams, Hungry Horse was built to create water storage which in turn creates power. The increase in hydrostatic electricity from the four generators power two dams in the Columbia River as well as provide power to us all in Kalispell, Whitefish, and Columbia Falls. This is about one billion kilowatt hours of power in a year!\n\nFishing\n\nThe Hungry Horse Reservoir allows anglers to have 23,500 acres of fishing. Although certain times of year might be difficult to fish in, inlets and bays where the South Fork of the Flathead river enter the reservoir are neat spots with lots of fish. Cutthroat trout, whitefish and even some scattered bull trout are some of the fish you will find in this area. This spot is perfect for kids fishing as well. Bring the whole family out on the river and catch some fish! Check out the beautiful and serene scenery while you fish!\n\nLooking for other types of recreation and entertainment?
