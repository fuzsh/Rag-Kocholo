        "text": "Located less than 15 minutes from Spotted Bear Retreat, Hungry Horse Dam is on the South Fork of the Flathead River, 15 miles south of the west entrance to Glacier National Park and 20 miles northeast of Kalispell, Montana. The dam was built as part of the Hungry Horse Project to provide hydroelectric power and flood control. At 564 feet, the dam is the 10th highest in the U.S. In addition to static and interactive exhibits that cover local area history and the construction of Hungry Horse Dam, the Visitor Center offers free tours of the damâ€™s crest.\n\nThe reservoir is about 34 miles long and 23,800 acres and offers excellent opportunities for fishing, boating, water skiing, and swimming. Available fish species are cutthroat trout, bull trout, and whitefish. The surrounding mountains are popular big game hunting areas and several of the small tributaries have their headwaters in nearby alpine lakes. The area is managed by the Flathead National Forest.The Hungry Horse visitor center is open daily from Memorial Day Weekend through Labor Day, although these dates are subject to change. Please visit Hungry Horse Dam for specific opening and closing dates of the visitor center at https://www.usbr.gov/pn/hungryhorse."
