        "text": "Glacier National Park, nestled in northern Montana along the Canada-U.S. border, is a realm where nature’s grandeur unfolds across over one million acres of skyscraping mountains, lush waterfalls, abundant wildlife, and ancient glaciers. Whether you’re planning to immerse yourself in the beauty of nature, hike rugged trails, or fly fish in pristine waters, here’s your guide to planning the perfect visit to Glacier National Park.\n\nPlanning Your Glacier Getaway\n\nGlacier is one of the most popular national parks in the U.S. and has a limited season when all attractions and facilities are open. It’s important to plan your trip in advance to ensure you get the necessary reservations, tours, and accommodations for your ideal getaway.\n\nWhen to Visit Glacier National Park\n\nFrom July to mid-September, summer is the best season for exploring Glacier National Park. The warm weather means all park facilities and attractions are open. For those looking to avoid the crowds, early to mid-September is a golden time window.\n\nGetting To and Around Glacier National Park\n\nGlacier Park International Airport (FCA) in Kalispell, Montana, is your gateway to the park. Renting a car is recommended for flexibility and ease of exploration. A free park shuttle within Glacier National Park runs along Going-to-the-Sun Road on a first come, first serve basis. Secure an “America the Beautiful National Park Pass” for entry to Glacier and the other national parks and forests, valid for 12 months from the Visitor Center or online in advance.\n\nNew in 2024: Glacier National Park Timed Entry Reservations\n\nStarting in 2024, Glacier National Park introduced timed entry vehicle reservations for Going-to-the-Sun Road, the North Fork, and Many Glacier. These reservations are essential for accessing the park’s most popular areas and are designed to manage visitor numbers, ease traffic, and conserve natural resources. Ensure to book separate vehicle reservations for each area you want to visit in advance to fully explore the park’s highlights.\n\nHow to Make a Glacier National Park Timed Entry Reservation\n\nThere are two ways to secure your Glacier National Park reservation:\n\nBook 120 days in advance. Most reservations will be released in advance, beginning on January 25, 2024, at 8 a.m. MT, on Recreation.Gov. After that, reservations will be released on a rolling basis:\n\nFebruary 2, 2024, for reservations on June 1, 2024\n\nMarch 3, 2024, for reservations on July 1, 2024\n\nApril 3, 2024, for reservations on August 1, 2024\n\nMay 4, 2024, for reservations on September 1, 2024\n\nBook the night before. The remaining reservations will be released the evening before at 7 p.m. MT, starting May 23. You can also make these reservations via Recreation.Gov.\n\nWe recommend arriving before 10 a.m. to avoid crowds and find parking or by 7:30 a.m. for busy trailheads like Logan Pass since a reservation does not ensure a parking spot.\n\nIf You Don’t Have a Reservation\n\nDon’t have a Glacier National Park reservation? Don’t worry. Consider entering the park before 6 a.m., driving Going-to-the-Sun Road from east to west (St. Mary Entrance), or booking a tour with park access. Use the Going-to-the-Sun Road shuttle or explore lesser-visited areas like Two Medicine, where reservations are no longer needed, for less traffic and fewer crowds.\n\nBest Hikes In and Around Glacier National Park\n\nGlacier National Park has an expansive trail system, with over 700 miles of paths and more than 50 day hikes.
