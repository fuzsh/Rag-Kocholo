        "text": "Abundances of important and imperiled fishes of the Snake River Basin continue to decline. We assessed the rationale for breaching the four lower Snake River Basin dams to prevent complete loss of these fishes, and to maximize their likelihood of recovery. We summarize the science surrounding Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), Chinook Salmon (O. tshawytscha), steelhead (O. mykiss), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and Pacific Lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus). From this, we drew ten conclusions: (1) development of the Columbia River System (including the Snake River Basin) has converted mainstem rivers into reservoirs, altering fish behavior and survival; (2) most populations currently record their lowest abundance; (3) the Columbia River System dams reduce productivity of diadromous fishes in the highest-quality spawning grounds that could buffer against future climate dynamics; (4) past actions have done little to reduce impacts or precipitate recovery; (5) the Columbia River System constrains survival and productivity of salmon, steelhead and Bull Trout; (6) Snake River Basin salmon and steelhead remain at high extinction risk; (7) eliminating migration impediments and improving mainstem habitats are essential for maintaining genetic diversity and improving Bull Trout persistence; (8) the lower Snake River Basin dams preclude passage of adult White Sturgeon, constraining gene flow and recruitment; (9) the lower Snake River Basin dams impede dramatically passage of adult and juvenile Pacific Lamprey, and (10) Snake River Basin Pacific Lamprey is at high risk of extirpation. Breaching the four lower Snake River Basin dams is an action likely to prevent extirpation and extinction of these fishes. Lessons from the Columbia River System can inform conservation in other impounded rivers.\n\nLotic fish have developed life history strategies adapted to the natural variation in stream flow regimes. The natural timing, duration, and magnitude of flow events has contributed to the diversity, production, and composition of fish assemblages over time. Studies evaluating the role of hydrology in structuring fish assemblages have been more common at the local or regional scale with very few studies conducted at the continental scale. Furthermore, quantitative linkages between natural hydrologic patterns and fish assemblages are rarely used to make predictions of ecological consequences of hydrologic alterations. This study asks two questions: 1) What is the relative role of hydrology in structuring fish assemblages at large scales? and 2) Can relationships between fish assemblages and natural hydrology be utilized to predict fish assemblage responses to hydrologic disturbance? We developed models to relate fish life histories and reproductive strategies to landscape and hydrologic variables separately and then combined. Models were then used to predict the ecological consequences of altered hydrology due to dam regulation. Although hydrology plays a considerable role in structuring fish assemblages, the performance of models using only hydrologic variables was lower than that of models constructed using landscape variables. Isolating the relative importance of hydrology in structuring fish assemblages at the continental scale is difficult since hydrology is interrelated to many landscape factors. By applying models to dam-regulated hydrologic data, we observed some consistent predicted responses in fish life history strategies and modes of reproduction. In agreement with existing literature, equilibrium strategists are predicted to increase following dam regulation, whereas opportunistic and periodic species are predicted to decrease. In addition, dam regulation favors the selection of reproductive strategies with extended spawning seasons and preference for stable conditions."
