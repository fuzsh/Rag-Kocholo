There are a few self made fire rings. Fairly level.\n\nReport Check-In\n\ngreat place to camp. several sites but the first one off the dirt road is best for larger rvs. I'd only reccomand vans and small trailers beyond that. very safe and quiet here. please keep it clean! everyone else does...\n\nReport Check-In\n\nGravel lot, mostly flat. Good gravel road off Hungry Horse west road. 1bar Verizon.\n\nReport Check-In\n\nI did not actually visit this site but I was given directions by a local National Forest Officer for sites all along this road. He instructed camping is allowed any place once you cross the damn. He did say 2 wheel drive would be fine as most are off a paved road (perk because less dust).\n\nReport Check-In\n\nThere are actually dozens of free boondocking sites along this Forrest Service Rd in addition to 3 campgrounds.
