Listening to Telling Me Lies from the Trio album (1987) always affects me greatly. Part of it is the tight harmony among Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris.

The song was the album’s second single, and it reached #3 on the US Billboard country singles charts. The recording was nominated for a Grammy award in 1988 for Country Song of the Year.

The message is painful:

You told me you needed my company

And I believed in your flattering ways

You told me you needed me forever

Nearly gave you the rest of my days

Should’ve seen you for what you are

Should never have come back for more

Should’ve locked up all my silver

Brought the key right to your door

The song first appeared on Linda Thompson’s One Clear Moment album (1985), her first solo collection “after divorcing husband and former collaborator, Richard Thompson.” The track was written by Linda Thompson and Betsy Cook, as were most of the songs on the album, which many critics believed included many well-written songs, often marred by that era’s heavy-handed production.

Don’t put your life in the hands of a man

With a face for every season

Don’t waste your time in the arms of a man

Who’s no stranger to treason

Listen to Telling Me Lies:

Linda Thompson here

Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris here or here

I cover my ears, I close my eyes

Still hear your voice and it’s telling me lies

Telling me lies

For good measure, another 1980s female trio with tight harmonies, though a somewhat different style:

You work too hard to take this abuse

Be on your guard jerks on the loose
