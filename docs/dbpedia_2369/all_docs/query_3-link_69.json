        "text": "There’s no musical generation gap in the Thompson Family Band, which started a sold-out three-night stand at City Winery on Thursday. Richard Thompson, a pioneer and grandmaster of British folk-rock, shared the stage with his children, a grandchild and some helpful in-laws.\n\nThey continue to follow the songwriting template he laid out in the 1960s with Fairport Convention and in the 1970s with his wife at the time, Linda Thompson. Mr. Thompson, then and now, has fused a British traditional heritage with hardheaded contemporary lyrics and the kick and twang of American rock and country. While the rest of the family members are not his equals as a songwriter — few are — they don’t tarnish the family name either. And their vocals harmonize richly even when they’re airing familial tensions.\n\nThe songwriter Teddy Thompson, Richard and Linda’s son, gathered new songs and arrangements from his relatives via overdubbing and some shared sessions for the album “Family” (Fantasy/Concord), released last year; Linda Thompson has songs on the album but is not on the tour. It’s a self-conscious project; Teddy’s own song, “Family,” which opened the concert, starts with the words, “My father is one of the greatest to ever step on a stage/My mother has the most beautiful voice in the world,” and goes on to confess his own insecurity. He also sang an older ballad, “Home,” about visiting his mother, falling back into “the family embrace” and then, after a few days, wanting to escape."
