        "text": "Folk/rock pioneer Richard Thompson appeared at the GRAMMY Museum's Great Guitars series on March 17, discussing his career and answering questions for an intimate audience of 200.\n\nThompson, highly regarded as a guitarist and songwriter, talked about his approach to the guitar, his musical legacy and upcoming projects in an informal and enlightening conversation-style interview and question-and-answer session.\n\nThompson began his career in the British folk/rock group Fairport Convention along with other soon-to-be stars of the movement Sandy Denny and Ian Matthews. The group became the definitive folk-rockers in England, bringing indigenous British styles into the folk movement of the '60s. Thompson's solo career and work with his former wife, Linda Thompson, includes the classic albums I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight and Shoot Out The Lights.\n\nUpcoming events at the GRAMMY Museum include interview and performance sessions with Rodrigo Y Gabriela (March 23), Shooter Jennings (March 25), Jakob Dylan (April 5), and George Thorogood (April 14).\n\nFor more information on the GRAMMY Museum, visit www.grammymuseum.org.\n\nClick on the \"GRAMMY Museum events\" tag below for links to other GRAMMY News stories in this series.\n\nIn 2005, South Korean producer and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk (aka \"hitman\" Bang) founded Bit Hit Entertainment. Only eight years later, he finished assembling what would come to be the label’s groundbreaking boy group, BTS. The rest is history, now chronicled in \"HYBE: We Believe In Music,\" the first full-floor K-pop exhibit at the GRAMMY Museum, which runs through Sept. 15.\n\nFollowing the success of Bit Hit’s premier act, and that of other artists under acquired labels SOURCE MUSIC and PLEDIS Entertainment, the company eventually evolved to become HYBE in 2021. \"I think HYBE is very special in that they have gone beyond being just a K-pop company,\" says Kelsey Goelz, curator of the exhibit. \"They have many different sub labels. They’ve come to America and gotten involved in the music business here, and then they’re also working in AI and gaming.\"\n\nBut beyond its global presence, one of K-pop’s ever-captivating elements is the sheer amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into making it possible, even when HYBE artists like ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, and LE SSERAFIM make it look easy. There’s a core humanity to this work ethic and dogged tenacity — to the level of artistry in general — that speaks to K-pop fans around the world.\n\nWhile HYBE’s growth shows no signs of slowing down yet, the GRAMMY Museum exhibit takes a look back on the entertainment company’s legacy thus far. Read on for the five things we learned from the \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" exhibit.\n\nAll photos Courtesy of the Recording Academy™️/photo by Rebecca Sapp, Getty Images© 2024.\n\nIn A Decade, BTS Built Themselves IntoA Global Phenomenon\n\nLet’s start with a history lesson: despite being around for almost a decade, HYBE’s story begins in earnest with the formation of one of K-pop’s breakthrough acts, BTS, in 2013. (At that point, the company was still a standalone label.) Led by rapper RM, the seven boys hopped off a yellow school bus with a bratty, adolescent attitude — and that’s where the GRAMMY Museum’s exhibit picks up.\n\nThere’s a lot that happened between then and their seven Billboard No. 1s. Luckily, a wallpapered timeline breaks down all the major global highlights: the first U.S. tour, their UNICEF campaign, a landmark performance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" and the announcement of BTS as TIME’s 2020 Entertainer of the Year, to name just a few.\n\nSitting in the middle of the museum floor is a glass case of polaroids — in them, Jin, Suga, j-hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook toss up peace signs while sporting novelty hats designed to look like BTS’s lightstick. Nostalgic and deeply silly, these photos date back to 2017 and 2018, serving as a reminder of the colossal strides BTS has taken in the intervening years.\n\nLearn more: Breaking Down Every Solo Act From BTS: Singles, Debut Albums & What's Next For The Septet\n\nIt Takes A Village To Make A K-Pop Music Video\n\nHYBE’s proffered ethos is \"we believe in music\" — this motto gives the special exhibit its name, while also serving as a mission statement.\n\nIn a series of recorded interviews on view in the exhibit, HYBE’s idol songwriters share their process for and perspective on making music. The main takeaway: Inspiration comes in different forms. While writing, BTS’s j-hope pictures ideas as tree branches that sprout outward, while RM sees his rap verses as a realized world to live inside.\n\nLiterally, too, their lyrics mark the passage of time. If you’ve ever wondered why Suga circles back to motifs across the years, the rapper has all the answers for you here.\n\nThere’s also a conversation with WOOZI of SEVENTEEN, one of the K-pop industry’s most prolific idol composers with more than 150 credits to his name. It’s a penchant for plain language, he says, that makes the lyrics he writes really sing; the band’s beloved B-side \"Hug,\" for example, gets its potency from everyday words and phrases. TOMORROW X TOGETHER’s Yeonjun likewise fills visitors in on the origin story behind co-written \"Maze in the Mirror,\" a misty reflection of their tough trainee days.\n\nThis isn’t to say they haven’t had help, of course. Nearby, clips of HYBE producers Pdogg, BUMZU, and ZICO, settled in their respective studios, walk us through how the instrumentals for songs like BTS’s \"ON\" and SEVENTEEN’s \"Lilili Yabbay\" came to be. Peruse at your leisure — for those curious about the creation of K-pop’s biggest hits, this corner of the exhibit could easily take up the better part of a trip.\n\nFans Make K-Pop Special\n\nAccording to another timeline, the story so far has three chapters. There was the era of Big Hit Entertainment, when BTS came into the picture; then, the establishment of HYBE, with its many labels. Finally, as the U.S. and Latin America enter the fold, we’re in the end game. Representing this future is L.A.-based girl group KATSEYE, a collaboration with Geffen Records and the most recent inclusion to HYBE’s roster.\n\nBut K-pop hasn’t entirely let go of its \"K\" just yet, if the special guests for the exhibit’s launch were any indication. As the sun set over the GRAMMY Museum’s rooftop terrace, rookie boy group TWS kicked things off; before performing high-energy five songs back to back, the six boys charmed the audience by cutely cruising through a moderated conversation in English and Korean.\n\nAs the exhibit reveals, there’s a reason HYBE — and K-pop — went global in the first place. On top of the spectacle, their success has everything to do with the work that goes into making the effort seem effortless. Audiences root for real people, and that's what makes them keep coming back.\n\nThe GRAMMY Museum joins forces with HYBE to present its newest exhibit, HYBE: We Believe In Music, A GRAMMY Museum Exhibit. This interactive exhibit chronicles the history and impact of HYBE, and showcases its legacy of unparalleled innovation and creativity as a trend-setting global entertainment brand.\n\nThe exhibit opens on Aug. 2 in downtown Los Angeles and features spotlight moments with K-pop stars BTS, SEVENTEEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, ENHYPEN, LE SSERAFIM, and many more. \"HYBE: We Believe In Music\" runs through Sept.15. The exhibit will kick off on Aug. 1 with \"Global Spin Live: TWS,\" a program featuring a moderated conversation with K-pop group TWS, followed by a performance.\n\nThe exhibit traces HYBE's evolution and influence by showcasing instantly recognizable artifacts from its roster of artists, creators, and fans. The displays notably feature original outfits worn in iconic music videos such as \"Yet To Come (The Most Beautiful Moment)\" by BTS, \"MAESTRO\" by SEVENTEEN, \"Sugar Rush Ride\" by TOMORROW X TOGETHER, \"Sweet Venom\" by ENHYPEN, and \"EASY\" by LE SSERAFIM. HYBE: We Believe In Music also boasts accessories and performance gear donned by ZICO, fromis_9, BOYNEXTDOOR, TWS, &TEAM, and ILLIT. The exhibit marks the first time these artifacts will be on display together in one location.\n\nOther highlights include interactive sing-along and dance rooms, a dedicated Fan Section celebrating the endless support between HYBE artists and their fandoms, a Mono to Immersive room featuring BTS's 2022 GRAMMYs performance of \"Butter,\" and a Photoism Booth that allows visitors to pose alongside their favorite K-pop artists. The GRAMMY Museum exhibit will also feature exclusive video content with producers, artists, music videos, and more.\n\n\"HYBE and their artists represent the present and future of the global music landscape, and our goal with this exhibit is to deepen the appreciation and respect for its creators and performers,\" says Michael Sticka, President/CEO of the GRAMMY Museum. \"HYBE has contributed to creating a playground of innovation that inspires fandoms that transcend age, gender, geography and beyond. The GRAMMY Museum is thrilled to provide a space where fans can express their love for K-pop and feel closer to their favorite idols.\"\n\nRead more: 11 Rookie K-Pop Acts To Know In 2024: NCT Wish, RIIZE, Kiss Of Life & More\n\nHYBE Chief Operating Officer Taeho Kim added, \"Putting out an exhibition that captures HYBE's journey is a new experience for us. We're very excited about this partnership with GRAMMY Museum, and we look forward to welcoming music fans who visit the museum to enjoy and connect with our historical pieces.\"\n\nThe exhibit highlights the roots of HYBE's meteoric rise. In 2005, South Korean producer, composer, and songwriter Bang Si-Hyuk, known as \"hitman\" Bang, changed the trajectory of Korean pop music by launching the record label Big Hit Entertainment. He soon signed a talented 16-year-old rapper named RM, which became the first step in creating the label's groundbreaking boy band — BTS. With the group's global success, \"hitman\" Bang and Big Hit Entertainment became known as musical trailblazers and record industry innovators. Big Hit Entertainment has now evolved into HYBE, which only continues to break boundaries in music and beyond.\n\nRichard Thompson remains something of a cult rocker rather than a bona fide rock star — but there are few similarly worthy candidates for the genre's personification on earth.\n\nFirst of all, he's one of rock's undersung triple threats. \"Richard's been one of my favorite guitar players for a very long time,\" said Jeff Tweedy, who produced and played on Thompson's 2015 album Still. \"When I think about it, he's also one of my favorite songwriters and favorite singers.\"\n\nThompson's 2021 memoir, Beeswing, renders him something like rock's Forrest Gump: By the tender age of 19, he'd co-founded Fairport Convention, seen Hendrix shred and turned down a birthday invite from Paul McCartney.\n\nHe had also pretty much solidified his artistry as an emotion-forward, English-Scottish yawp who was equally virtuosic on acoustic and electric guitar. And Thompson's probing lyrics continue to twist the knife, again and again.\n\nHis guitar work has inspired scores of imitators, but nobody's played the instrument like Thompson. In retrieving the bagpipe's drone, his music didn't become old-timey or quaint; rather, it enabled him to tear the roof off.\n\nCrank up his introductory calling card \"Roll Over Vaughn Williams\"; his roiling last album, 13 Rivers; and anything in between: Thompson's electric guitar will spin your head like a top. And on the acoustic, he's muscular, searching and incisive: both his Acoustic Classics discs will ravish you.\n\nHappily, Thompson is still making some of the strongest music of his career. His new album, Ship to Shore, is a taut yet spacious new offering. After the sturm und drang of the modern-rocking 13 Rivers, mellower, rootsier tracks like \"Freeze,\" \"The Day That I Give In\" and \"Life's a Bloody Show\" seem to loop back to the artist's essence.\n\nWith a whopping 19 studio albums since the early 1970s — six with his ex-wife Linda Thompson — to boil down Thompson's discography into essential tracks is a bit daunting. From here, seek out underrated '80s albums like Hand of Kindness; middle-of-the-road yet satisfying '90s works like Mock Tudor, and of course, his inspired work in the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nBut for now, if you're a Thompson newbie, read on for 10 songs you must hear by the three-time GRAMMY nominee.\n\n\"Roll Over Vaughn Williams\" (Henry the Human Fly, 1972)\n\nMany years ago, veteran CBS journalist Anthony Mason lost his entire record collection when it disappeared in transit as he moved from one place to another. Mason was inconsolable, and you could still hear a tinge of sadness in his voice when he recounted this painful story at the inaugural GRAMMY Hall of Fame Gala, held on May 21 at the Novo Theater in Los Angeles. The evening’s eloquent and entertaining host, Mason was making a point with his personal anecdote of lost records: music is priceless, one of our most treasured possessions — both as individuals and as a community. Preserving its legacy is essential.\n\nIt’s been over 50 years since the GRAMMY Hall of Fame was established by the Recording Academy's National Trustees to honor records of deep historical significance that are at least 25 years old. This year, the Recording Academy and the GRAMMY Museum paid tribute to 10 newly inducted recordings (four albums and six singles) by artists including De La Soul, Lauryn Hill, Buena Vista Social Club, Donna Summer, Guns 'N Roses, Charley Pride, Kid Ory’s Creole Orchestra, the Doobie Brothers, William Bell, Wanda Jackson, and Atlantic Records, the annual Gala's inaugural label honoree.\n\nThe first Hall of Fame Gala was a dazzling event presented by City National Bank, complete with guest speakers and performances by Andra Day, The War and Treaty, William Bell, Elle King, and HANSON covering some of the inducted works. The event underscored the sumptuous variety that continues to define popular music, spanning the sounds of hip-hop, rock, country, R&B, disco, and even the venerable Cuban dance music of decades past.\n\nHere are six takeaway points from an evening marked by celebration and transcendent musical memories.\n\nDonna Summer’s “I Feel Love” Has Lost None Of Its Edge\n\nStudious music fans are well aware that “I Feel Love” — written by Donna Summer with visionary Italian producer Giorgio Moroder and British songwriter Pete Bellotte — is a shimmering disco gem, a futuristic precursor to the entire EDM genre. What was stunning about the Gala performance of the track by singer and actress Andra Day is how edgy and fresh the 1977 track still sounds today. Day’s ethereal reading was appropriately hypnotic, with live drums, nebulous synth textures and glorious, three-part vocal harmonies.\n\nThe Future Of American Music Is In Good Hands With The War and Treaty\n\nFormed by husband and wife Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter, The War and Treaty were rightfully nominated for Best New Artist at the 2024 GRAMMYs earlier this year. The duo’s electrifying combination of Americana, gospel, and rock is especially effective on a live stage, and the pair delivered a memorable rendition of Charley Pride's inducted Hall Of Fame country hit, “Kiss an Angel Good Mornin’,” recorded in 1971. The War and Treaty also received a standing ovation later in the evening for their performance of Ray Charles' classic, \"What'd I Say,\" released in 1959.\n\n26 Years Later, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill Is Still Ahead Of Its Time\n\nReleased in August 1998, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill sold more than 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and became the first hip-hop artist to win Album Of The Year at the 1999 GRAMMYs. At the Gala, Andra Day delighted the audience — including Lauryn Hill and her family — with a soulful version of hidden track “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You,” originally a Frankie Valli hit from 1967. Day's performance was marked by brassy accents and funky bass lines, creating an unapologetically lush rendition that mirrored the sonic richness of Hill's original take.\n\nRead more: Revisiting 'The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill': Why The Multiple GRAMMY-Winning Record Is Still Everything 25 Years Later\n\nAtlantic Records Transformed The Face Of Global Culture\n\nCelebrating 75 years of inaugural label honoree Atlantic Records in the span of a few minutes loomed like an impossible task, but the Gala producers paid tribute to the legacy label well. Beginning with a short video, the event segment highlighted the miraculous roster assembled by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson that included Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin, ABBA, Phil Collins, and Bruno Mars — to name just a few. But it was the actual performances that highlighted the label’s hold on pop culture: Ravyn Lenae’s breathy take on Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly With His Song” made a case for considering the 1973 hit as one of the most vulnerable recordings of all time. On the other side of the dynamic spectrum, the epic rendition of Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven” by alt-rock quartet Shinedown was appropriately intense.\n\nThe Wondrous Legacy Of Stax Records Should Not Be Underestimated\n\nThe home of such legendary artists as Otis Redding, The Staple Singers and Carla Thomas, Memphis-based Stax Records developed a rich, ragged sound with gospel, blues, R&B and luminous pop as its foundational pillars. Currently the subject of an HBO documentary series, \"Stax: Soulsville USA,\" the record label defined American music during the ‘60s and ‘70s. Memphis singer/songwriter William Bell was one of its most prolific artists, and he regaled guests with a performance of his Hall of Fame inducted debut 1961 single, “You Don’t Miss Your Water.” At 84 years of age — and the winner of a Best Americana Album at the 2017 GRAMMYs — Bell was in rare form, and the band backed him up seamlessly, reproducing the sinuous organ lines of the original.\n\nRead more: 1968: A Year Of Change For The World, Memphis & Stax Records\n\nFuture Editions Of The Gala Will Continue To Surprise And Delight\n\nThe inaugural GRAMMY Hall of Fame Gala set a high standard for future celebrations of iconic recordings. The event proved to be fertile ground for the creation of indelible music moments, showcasing the beauty and authority of music across genres and generations. Other honored Hall of Fame inducted recordings including De La Soul’s 3 Feet High And Rising, Guns’N’Roses Appetite For Destruction, the Buena Vista Social Club’s debut, Wanda Jackson’s “Let’s Have A Party,” Kid Ory’s Creole Orchestra’s “Ory’s Creole Trombone” and The Doobie Brothers’ “What A Fool Believes.”\n\nAs we look ahead, the excitement for future Galas grows, with each event promising to honor more historic recordings, and uphold the tradition of celebrating excellence in music's rich legacy.\n\nExplore The 2024 GRAMMY Hall Of Fame Inducted Recordings: Lauryn Hill, Guns N' Roses, De La Soul, Donna Summer & Many More"
