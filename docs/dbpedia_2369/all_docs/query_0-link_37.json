        "text": "Simon And Garfunkel\n\nArt Garfunkel – circa 1969\n\n“Time, time, time, see what’s become of me / While I looked around for my possibilities / I was so hard to please” – ‘Hazy Shade Of Winter’ (Paul Simon)\n\n“Paul, I think it behooves you to come back to the States because our record has just got into the top ten and it looks as if it is going to be number one!” writes Art Garfunkel. The ‘Paul’ to whom he addresses himself is Paul Simon, the other half of the American folk rock duo Simon And Garfunkel. It is 1965 and Paul Simon is in England, working on a potential solo career. The record under discussion is ‘The Sound Of Silence’. The duo recorded the song to meagre effect before Simon’s overseas jaunt. Without the knowledge or consent of either Paul Simon or Art Garfunkel, record producer Tom Wilson added another ingredient that totally transformed the song and its fate. The added element is electricity.\n\nPaul Frederick Simon is born 13 October 1941 in Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A. He comes from a Jewish / Hungarian background. His father, Louis Simon, is an educator who also has a small jazz combo. Paul’s mother, Belle Simon, is an English teacher. Paul has a younger brother, Eddie (born 14 December 1945). The boys are raised ‘in a middle-class residential district of New York.’\n\nArthur Ira Garfunkel is born 5 November 1941 in Forest Hills, New York, U.S.A. He is of Romanian Jewish descent. His father, Jack Garfunkel, is a salesman. Art’s mother, Rose Garfunkel, is a housewife. Art has two brothers, Jules (14 November 1939 – 17 September 2006) and Jerome (born 5 June 1945).\n\nArt Garfunkel says, “Paul [Simon] and I go back to the sixth grade where we grew up in Queens, [New York}. They cast the two of us in the elementary school graduation play, ‘Alice in Wonderland’. I was the Cheshire Cat…” Paul Simon takes up the narrative. “We met when we were 11 years old in ‘Alice in Wonderland’. I was the White Rabbit. It’s a leading role. And Artie was the Cheshire Cat, a supporting role – a very important supporting role.”\n\nPaul Simon and Art Garfunkel both attend Forest Hills High School in Forest Hills, New York. “We started to sing together when we were 13 years old,” Simon says of his partnership with Art Garfunkel – and then quips, “And we started to argue when we were 14.” They are exposed to early rock ‘n’ roll music as teens. Paul takes a particular interest in doo wop, a vocal harmony style practiced by young African-American singers. Paul Simon learns to play guitar. Although he is otherwise left-handed, Paul plays guitar right-handed. The duo begins writing songs together in 1955. Their first song is ‘The Girl For Me’ in 1955. Although the copyright for the song is secured, it is never recorded.\n\n“We made our first record when we were 16 years old,” recounts Paul Simon. “They called us Tom And Jerry and our song was called ‘Hey Schoolgirl.’” The Tom And Jerry cognomen is taken from the cat and mouse, Tom and Jerry, appearing in MGM’s theatrical short cartoons. The singing duo extend the aliases to the fabricated names Tom Graph (Art Garfunkel) and Jerry Landis (Paul Simon). Based on the vocal harmonies of pioneering rock act The Everly Brothers, ‘Hey Schoolgirl’ (US no. 49) (a tale of falling in love at too young an age) is recorded as a demo for fifteen dollars. Big Records puts out the single in 1957. Tom And Jerry perform the song on television’s ‘American Bandstand’ in the same episode that premieres ‘Great Balls Of Fire’ by piano-playing wild man Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\nThe success of ‘Hey Schoolgirl’ suggests a bright future for Tom And Jerry, but the follow-ups ‘crash’. Two singles in 1958, ‘Our Song’ and ‘That’s My Story’, 1962’s ‘Surrender, Please Surrender’ and 1963’s ‘I’m Lonesome’ all fail to make any impact and the duo split up in 1964.\n\nDuring this time Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel finish high school and go on to further education.\n\nPaul Simon, even while Tom And Jerry is a going concern, is exploring other options. In March 1958 he issues ‘True Or False’ backed with ‘Teen Age Fool’ under the pseudonym of True Taylor. In 1959 comes ‘Anna Belle’ b/w ‘Loneliness’, a single released under the name of Jerry Landis. Somewhere around this time, Simon also finds the time to act as lead singer for a couple of ‘semi-professional groups’, The Passions and The Mystics. ‘Don’t Take The Stars’ is a 1959 single by The Mystics. Paul Simon also becomes involved with a group called The Cosines in 1959. This is a studio collective that cuts demos for songwriters. One of his fellow Cosines is Carole Klein, better known later as the singer-songwriter Carole King. In 1960 ‘Just A Boy’ is issued by Jerry Landis, ‘All Through The Night’ by The Mystics, and ‘Swanee’ by Jerry Landis. In 1961 come two more Jerry Landis singles, ‘I Wish I Weren’t In Love’ and ‘Play Me A Sad Song’. In 1961 Amy Records puts out ‘Motorcycle’ b/w ‘I Don’t Believe Them’, a single credited to Tico & The Triumphs – which is Paul Simon ‘with a handful of vocalists’. The year 1962 brings ‘Express Train’ by Tico & The Triumphs, ‘Cry Little Boy’ by Tico & The Triumphs, ‘The Lone Teen Ranger’ (US no. 97) by Jerry Landis, and ‘Cards Of Love’ by Tico & The Triumphs. While conducting all this musical business, Paul Simon also graduates from Queens College of the City University of New York (CUNY) with a B.A. in English. He also studies Law, but drops out in early 1964. He records ‘He Was My Brother’ in 1964 using the alias of Paul Kane.\n\nArt Garfunkel says, “I thought I was going to college” after his brief flirtation with fame. He does a Bachelor of Arts in art history at Columbia University, though that is not completed until 1965. At the same university he also obtains a Master of Science in Mathematics in 1967 and was going to pursue his PhD but his music career prevents that. However, even during his more academic days, Art Garfunkel still dabbles in music. Under the name of Artie Garr he releases ‘Beat Love’ in 1959 and ‘Forgive Me’ (US no. 102) in 1961. These singles appear on the Octavia and Warwick labels.\n\nIn 1964 Paul Simon goes to England and begins performing in folk clubs. He meets Kathleen Mary Chitty – better known as Kathy – on 12 April 1964 and falls in love with her. She is a secretary from Essex. Paul Simon makes the acquaintance of British folk music performers like Bert Jansch and Martin Carthy. The latter performs a traditional folk tune, ‘Scarborough Fair’, which piques Simon’s interest. Judith Piepe is impressed with Paul Simon’s own work and starts touting him to record companies.\n\nPaul Simon returns to the U.S.A. in 1964 and re-teams with Art Garfunkel. Although the duo started out as Everly Brothers-style rock harmony singers in 1957, over the successive years the first blush of rock has faded and folk music has become more popular. Simon’s own experiences in the U.K. have been as an acoustic folk singer rather than as a rock musician. Probably the central figure in the whole folk music scene is the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. Tom Wilson produces Dylan’s second through fifth albums (1963 to 1965). Columbia Records (home to Dylan) takes an interest in ‘He Was My Brother’, the song Simon recorded as Paul Kane, and offers a recording contract.\n\nThis time, the duo is known as Simon And Garfunkel, not Tom And Jerry. “When we first formed our group, I wanted to call us Garfunkel And Simon,” says Art with – presumably – tongue-in-cheek. With Tom Wilson as producer, Simon And Garfunkel record their first album, ‘Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.’ (1964) (US no. 30, UK no. 24), which is released in October. The contents are a mix of traditional folk songs and Paul Simon originals. It is a very basic recording – just Simon’s acoustic guitar and the two voices. Despite the presence (in acoustic form) of ‘The Sounds Of Silence’ [sic], the album’s ‘initial impact is minimal.’\n\nPaul Simon decides to return to England. He reunites with Kathy Chitty. “Paul was having a ball in England. It was one of the happiest times of his life,” Art Garfunkel explains. “He had this terrific lady friend [Kathy Chitty]…Working in folk clubs [he] was making thirty pounds a night, which was good money then.” A solo album, ‘The Paul Simon Songbook’ (1965) is released in August. The album is produced by Reginald Warburton and Stanley West. The cover photo shows Simon with Judith Piepe, his long-time supporter. Like ‘Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.’ this is a stripped-down, acoustic album. It also includes ‘The Sound Of Silence’ and another couple of songs that will also be revisited later, ‘I Am A Rock’ and ‘Kathy’s Song’. Paul Simon works through England and Europe promoting the disc. In Paris, France, in 1965 he shares a bill with a Peruvian folk group, Los Incas.\n\nBack in the U.S.A., Tom Wilson re-examines the material from ‘Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.’. In July 1965, The Byrds topped the U.S. charts with a version of Bob Dylan’s ‘Mr Tambourine Man’. The Byrds used electric guitars and drums, creating the hybrid folk rock sound. Wilson thinks that such a contemporary sound may work for ‘The Sounds Of Silence’, so he arranges for overdubs. Wilson is correct, the song races up the charts, and Art Garfunkel summons his erstwhile partner back to the U.S.A. The only negative aspect is that Paul Simon’s departure from England also ends his relationship with Kathy Chitty. A shy girl, she wants no part of Simon’s impending fame and bids him farewell.\n\nSimon And Garfunkel are usually characterised as a folk rock act. They started out as Tom And Jerry, a rather polite rock ‘n’ roll duo. Simon And Garfunkel’s debut disc and Paul Simon’s solo album are, essentially, pure folk music. However it is folk rock that makes the duo’s reputation. Folk rock takes the more literate and thoughtful lyricism of folk and weds it to a rock music beat, embellished by electric guitars and keyboards. Folk’s political dimension is largely lost in the transition. Simon And Garfunkel’s brand of folk rock becomes increasingly complex and stylised. A certain grandiosity and ambition (pretentiousness?) is ever present.\n\nAlthough Simon And Garfunkel co-wrote in the earliest days of Tom And Jerry, it is now almost exclusively Paul Simon who composes their material. “Artie is a singer, and I’m a writer and player [of acoustic guitar] and a singer. We didn’t work together on a creative level and prepare the songs. I did that,” insists Paul Simon. Their most casual fans may see them as equals, but the reality is very different. “Paul’s the writer,” Garfunkel concedes.\n\nEven when it comes to the vocals, Simon And Garfunkel is a partnership weighted towards Paul Simon. He generally takes the lead, with Art Garfunkel confined to providing high harmonies. There are some songs that showcase Garfunkel’s fragile, ethereal voice and these work out well. “Without Arthur’s voice, I never would have enjoyed that success,” Simon admits. “So many of the songs I wrote were greatly enhanced by the fact that Art Garfunkel sang on them.”\n\nAlthough still in his 20s, a common theme in Paul Simon’s songs is time and aging. He was never really built for crafting party anthems or odes to the power of rock. Instead, Paul Simon’s works are more bookish and thoughtful. Such paths of musing naturally enough lead to issues of impermanence and the passage of time. Although Simon And Garfunkel may never have been a hard rock act, their more genteel sensibilities allow them to connect with a broader and larger audience than many of their rock music peers.\n\nThe career of Simon And Garfunkel really gets underway when the electric version of ‘The Sound Of Silence’ (US no. 1) becomes a U.S. hit in November 1965. Its folk rock frames an oblique and enigmatic lyric that, towards the end, proclaims that, “The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls / And tenement halls.”\n\nThe album, ‘The Sounds Of Silence’ (1966) (US no. 21, UK no. 13), is released in January. Both this and the next Simon And Garfunkel album are produced by Bob Johnston. Ironically, Johnston replaced Tom Wilson (the innovator of Simon And Garfunkel’s folk rock sound} as producer of their Columbia Records label-mate Bob Dylan as well. Beyond the revised model of ‘The Sound Of Silence’, this disc includes the two other previously mentioned tunes from ‘The Paul Simon Songbook’, ‘I Am A Rock’ and ‘Kathy’s Song’. ‘I Am A Rock’ (US no. 3, UK no. 17) nails its colours to the mast as the declaration of an introvert, an anthem of intellectual fortitude: “I have my books / And my poetry / To protect me.” ‘Kathy’s Song’ is about Kathy Chitty of course. In its beauteous melody it evokes Simon’s former love. ‘We’ve Got A Groovy Thing Goin’ attempts to be more upbeat and full-bodied while ‘Richard Cory’ looks at rural poverty and injustice.\n\n‘Parsley, Sage, Rosemary And Thyme’ (1966) (US no. 4, UK no. 13, AUS no. 14) in October offers another strong menu of music. ‘Homeward Bound’ (US no. 5, UK no. 9), a song of life on the road, was written by Paul Simon during his sojourn in England. He began the song while waiting for a train in Lancashire: “I’m sittin’ in a railway station / Got a ticket for my destination.” When the song speaks of going home “Where my love lies waiting silently for me”, this refers once again to Kathy Chitty. The album’s title, ‘Parsley, Sage, Rosemary And Thyme’, is taken from the song ‘Scarborough Fair / Canticle’ (US no. 11, AUS no. 5). The four herbs cited in the lyric (and the album title) ‘are associated with death and are traditional charms against the evil eye.’ ‘Scarborough Fair’ is the folk tune Martin Carthy brought to Paul Simon’s attention during the New Yorker’s stay in the U.K. The song is interwoven with ‘Canticle’, a Simon original from ‘The Paul Simon Songbook’. Given the mixed origin of the piece, the songwriting credit is shared between Simon and Garfunkel since they adapt and arrange the blended traditional folk tune and the Simon song. “Are you going to Scarborough Fair? / Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme / Remember me to one who lives there / She once was a true love of mine,” it commences before becoming a sort of roundelay with overlapping lyrics. It is delicate, yet mysterious. ‘Scarborough Fair / Canticle’ is Simon And Garfunkel’s best song. It defies time, sounding like something from medieval days gone by, yet remaining somehow timeless as well. Given that time is one of Simon’s lyrical motifs and the song sports some of their loveliest vocal performances, it stands as their definitive work. ‘Cloudy’ is light and wistful, tripping along on a bell-like melody. Light in a different way is ‘The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin’ Groovy)’. Cringing, Paul Simon claims he would hate to be remembered for this song. He’s being rather harsh on himself. Sure, this brief (1.41) track is feather-light but, with its carefree whistle, it is so genial, the feel-good atmosphere fairly radiates outwards from it in a pleasant glow. At the other extreme, the album contains a couple of the duo’s most self-consciously poetic works. ‘The Dangling Conversation’ (US no. 25) poses such questions as “Can analysis be worthwhile? Is the theatre really dead?” The same listeners might see ‘For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her’ (featuring Art Garfunkel’s lead vocals) as being about the poet Emily Dickinson (who is name-checked in ‘The Dangling Conversation’). Both these songs feature elaborate string sections in their instrumentation.\n\nThe single ‘Hazy Shade Of Winter’ (US no. 13) is released in November 1966. This is about the nearest thing in Simon And Garfunkel’s catalogue to outright rock. It boasts a fairly aggressive electric guitar line. This makes for a nice change of pace.\n\nThe March 1967 single ‘At The Zoo’ (US no. 16) is ‘playful’ and whimsical, almost like a children’s song.\n\nThe motion picture ‘The Graduate’ (1967) includes musical contributions from Simon And Garfunkel. The album, ‘The Graduate – Soundtrack’ (1968) (US no. 1, UK no. 3, AUS no. 1), is released in January 1968. The young lead character in the movie, played by Dustin Hoffman, is seduced by Anne Bancroft’s older woman, Mrs Robinson. Paul Simon was writing an as-yet-untitled new song and found it had a gap with the same number of beats as the name of Bancroft’s character so he called it, jokingly, ‘Mrs Robinson’ (US no. 1, UK no. 4, AUS no. 4). When director Mike Nichols learned about the song, he demanded to hear it and put it in the film, even though, title aside, it has nothing really to do with the story. In an early example of cross-promotion, the popularity of the song helps the film and the popularity of the film helps the song. ‘Mrs Robinson’ is an addictive slice of acoustic strumming and picking as Simon asks, “What’s that you say, Mrs Robinson? / Joltin’ Joe has left and gone away.” ‘Joltin’ Joe’ is baseball star Joe DiMaggio as the lyric later confirms: “Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?” “’Mrs Robinson’…has nothing to do with Joe DiMaggio,” Paul Simon insists. What the song seems to be about is the loss of a better, more innocent, past, perhaps characterised by such famous sportsmen of days gone by. It’s a common theme to the aging Mrs Robinson and Paul Simon, whose familiar subject of time’s passage resurfaces here.\n\n‘Hazy Shade Of Winter’, ‘At The Zoo’ and ‘Mrs Robinson’ are all included on the next Simon And Garfunkel album, ‘Bookends’ (1968) (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 3), in April. This and the duo’s next album are co-produced by Simon And Garfunkel and Roy Halee. Paul Simon describes ‘Bookends’ as “the quintessential Simon And Garfunkel album.” It is ‘mostly dark’ and ‘deals with people in positions of despair and anxiety.’ The title track medley of ‘Old Friends / Bookends’ is, naturally, a song of two parts. ‘Old Friends’ is an extraordinary meditation written by a young man (Simon is 27 at the time) about being old: “How terribly strange to be 70.” Still, it fits with Simon’s work on the passing of time. The companion, ‘Bookends’, is more opaque: “A time it was and what a time it was / It was.” The album’s other notable track is ‘America’. A young couple set out to ‘find’ the true America in a piece that moves from delicate acoustic miniatures to sweeping orchestration. Simon sings, “’Kathy, I’m lost,’ I said / Though I knew she was sleeping / ‘I’m empty and aching / And I don’t know why.’” This is the last manifestation of ‘Kathy’ in Paul Simon’s songs. However, it is a name only inspired by Kathy Chitty, since – so far as is known – the real Kathy never left the U.K. and didn’t travel across the U.S.A. with Simon.\n\nThe single ‘The Boxer’ (US no. 7, UK no. 6, AUS no. 3) is released in April 1969. Paul Simon calls this “a really nice record.” It has a broad, cinematic canvas. The track is assembled from, supposedly, over one hundred hours of sessions. These take place in multiple venues including Nashville, New York’s St Paul’s Church, and the Columbia studios. “People often called us perfectionists,” Paul Simon acknowledges. “I am just a poor boy / Though my story’s seldom told,” begins the narrative. “Just a come on from the whores on Seventh Avenue,” is all the pugilist of the title receives. This line raises eyebrows in some quarters. The folky chorus is punctuated by percussive booms, simulating punches thrown. In the climax, the song states, “In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade / And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame, ‘I am leaving, I am leaving’ / But the fighter still remains.” Although ‘The Boxer’ works as a straight account of a struggling fighter, it can also be interpreted as a metaphor for a struggling rock musician.\n\nIn late autumn 1969 Paul Simon marries Peggy Harper. They have a son, Harper James Simon (born September 1972), presumably named after his mother’s maiden name.\n\nSimon And Garfunkel’s finest album, ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ (1970) (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 1), is released in January. It marks both the end of the 1960s and the end of Simon And Garfunkel’s partnership. “A great deal of the time during ‘Bridge’, Artie wasn’t there,” Paul Simon points out. Art Garfunkel was in Mexico, appearing in the movie ‘Catch 22’ (1970). ‘The Only Living Boy In New York’ obliquely refers to this, since it takes the form of a message to an absent friend named Tom (remember Garfunkel was Tom Graph in the duo’s Tom And Jerry days). ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ includes ‘The Boxer’ as well as some of the duo’s most musically expansive work. The title track, ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ (US no. 1, UK no. 1, AUS no. 1), is sung by Art Garfunkel alone and, aided by Larry Knechtel’s sensitive piano-playing, is an achingly lovely performance. “He felt I should have done it,” Simon reports, “and many times I’m sorry I didn’t.” Nonetheless, Simon calls it, “A very good song. Artie sang it beautifully.” The song is written for Simon’s wife, Peggy. However, what sets it apart is that it is composed in the style of the gospel group The Swan Silvertones. It is this almost elegiac grace that gives ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ a universal currency due to it being, as its author puts it, a “hopeful…resting, peaceful song.” “When you’re weary / Feeling small / When tears are in your eyes / I will dry them all,” sings Art Garfunkel. ‘El Condor Pasa’ and ‘Cecelia’ both absorb music from other cultures, a trademark of Paul Simon’s later solo recordings. Simon writes an English lyric for ‘El Condor Pasa’ (US no. 18, AUS no. 6), an eighteenth century Peruvian folk song by Jorge Milchberg and Daniel A. Robles. Los Incas, the folk group from Peru Simon met in 1965, are called upon to provide the exotic backing music infused with flutes. Although characterised as ‘slightly calypso’, ‘Cecelia’ (US no. 4) actually sounds more African with its emphasis on percussion and rhythm. The slightly risqué lyrics run, “Makin’ love in the afternoon with Cecelia up in my bedroom / I got up to wash my face / When I come back to bed someone’s taken my place.” The unusually boisterous ‘Keep The Customer Satisfied’ bumps its way to a brassy pile-up of horns in the finish. ‘Song For The Asking’ closes the disc and acts like a musical after-dinner mint. Although ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ may be the work of a disintegrating partnership, its lush and varied musical palette makes this the duo’s most satisfying album.\n\n“We’d known each other since we were kids,” says Paul Simon, “but I thought we’d gone about as far as we were going to go as a duo with the ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ album.” He continues, “We’re really two different guys…The bigger we got, the more insistent we got that each of us should have his way.” Simon attributes the split to “ego”, while Garfunkel points instead to “tiredness.”\n\nPaul Simon and Art Garfunkel go on to separate solo careers. While Simon And Garfunkel never again becomes an ongoing creative concern in a major way, there are a number of reunions and détentes.\n\nOn 14 June 1972 a reunited Simon And Garfunkel are one of the acts involved in a fundraising show for U.S. Presidential candidate George McGovern. The concert takes place in New York’s Madison Square Garden. The occasion virtually coincides with the release of ‘Simon And Garfunkel’s Greatest Hits’ (1972) (US no. 5, UK no. 2, AUS no. 10) in June, an album whose contents mix-and-match live recordings with the better known studio versions of the duo’s output. Simon And Garfunkel next join forces on 18 October 1975 on ‘NBC’s Saturday Night’ television program. This publicises a new song they have recorded together, the dynamic ‘My Little Town’ (US no. 9, AUS no. 1), which shows up on both Paul Simon’s ‘Still Crazy After All These Years’ (1975) and Art Garfunkel’s ‘Breakaway’ (1975). In 1977, singer-songwriter James Taylor makes it a trio, joining Simon And Garfunkel for a cover version of Sam Cooke’s 1960 hit ‘Wonderful World’ (US no. 17). This recording is included on Art Garfunkel’s album, ‘Watermark’ (1977). Perhaps the duo’s most celebrated reunion is for a free concert in New York’s Central Park on 19 September 1981. This yields the live album ‘The Concert In Central Park’ (1982) (US no. 6, UK no. 6, AUS no. 5) and a world tour in 1982-1983. Excitingly, plans are made for a new Simon And Garfunkel album to be titled ‘Think Too Much’. However, these plans fall through and the material is recycled for Paul Simon’s solo album ‘Hearts And Bones’ (1983). Their next get-together is for the duo’s induction to the Rock ‘N’ Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. In 1993 Simon And Garfunkel again work together, putting on twenty-one shows in New York. A joint appearance at the Grammy Awards on 23 February 2003 leads to a U.S. tour from October to December 2003. With another live album (plus DVD), ‘Old Friends – Live On Stage’ (2004) (US no. 154, UK no. 61, AUS no. 22), to their credit, Simon And Garfunkel tour the U.S. and Europe in June-July 2004. When Paul Simon appears at New York’s Beacon Theatre on 15 February 2009, Art Garfunkel joins him for three songs. Simon And Garfunkel tour Australia, New Zealand and Japan in June-July 2009.\n\nThe personal lives of Simon And Garfunkel also go through changes after the duo splits in 1970.\n\nPaul Simon’s marriage to Peggy Harper ends in divorce in 1975. Simon has a relationship with the actress Shelley Duvall from 1976 to 1978. He marries actress Carrie Fisher on 16 August 1983. Although Simon and Fisher divorce in July 1984, they go on dating for a number of years before finally calling it quits in 1991. On 30 May 1992 Paul Simon marries singer and musician Edie Brickell. They have three children: a son named Adrian (born December 1992), a daughter named Lulu (born April 1995), and a son named Gabriel (born May 1998).\n\nArt Garfunkel weds Linda Grossman, an architect, on 1 October 1972. They divorce in 1975. Garfunkel is then romantically linked with actress and photographer Laurie Byrd from March 1974 until her suicide in 1979. He dates actress Penny Marshall from 1984 to 1985. In late 1985, Art Garfunkel meets Kathryn (Kim) Cermak. The couple marry on 18 September 1988. They have a son, James (born 15 December 1990). Art Garfunkel fathers a second son, Beau (born 5 October 2005), via a surrogate mother.\n\nIf Paul Simon had not responded to Art Garfunkel’s summons back to the U.S.A. in 1965, things could have turned out very differently. Yet, in a way, Simon’s subsequent solo career investigates what that would have been like anyway. Would Paul Simon alone have enjoyed the same level of success as Simon And Garfunkel in the 1960s? It’s hard to say – but perhaps not. Art’s prettier voice may have helped the duo reach a wider audience and he may have modulated some of Simon’s greater self-indulgences with an eye towards accessibility. With the possible exception of ‘Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.’, the duo’s five albums of studio material [this count does not include their contributions to ‘The Graduate’ soundtrack] are fairly consistently high quality work. The themes of time and aging in Paul Simon’s songwriting are also reflected in the career of Simon And Garfunkel. They had already had a career as Tom And Jerry and broke up before reuniting as Simon And Garfunkel…only to break up again…only to reunite periodically after 1970. The pattern repeated as they aged. Time passes, but some things remain constant…like the music of Simon And Garfunkel…and that’s entirely fitting. ‘Simon And Garfunkel combined the best of the folk tradition and the rock revolution all in one place.’ They offered ‘intimate harmonising, observant lyrics, innovative arrangements and singular tunes.’\n\nSources:\n\n‘Simon And Garfunkel – 20 Greatest Hits’ – Sleeve notes by Glenn A.

In the 1950s and 1960s, when Australia’s biggest pop sensations are, respectively, Johnny O’Keefe and The Easybeats, the usual venues are a few large concert halls in capital cities. By the late 1970s, Australia’s pub circuit is the home to most of the country’s bands. Sherbet fall somewhere in between those two poles both chronologically and in terms of where they play. ‘Sherbet was the first Australian band to realise the potential worth of taking their music to the people – all the people – on long, tedious national tours.’\n\nDaryl Braithwaite is born 11 January 1949 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Daryl has a twin brother, Glen. Their father is a plumber. Daryl Braithwaite attends the Punt Road Primary School in South Yarra, Victoria. He moves on to Christchurch Grammar School – which is also in Punt Road. One of Daryl’s classmates is future pop star Olivia Newton-John. The two go steady briefly. “We were boyfriend and girlfriend for about a week or two,” Daryl reports. “We held hands; that’s about it.” In 1963, when Daryl is 14, the family moves north to Coogee, New South Wales. In his new locale, Daryl Braithwaite attends Randwick Boys High until the end of fourth form (i.e. Year 10, the fourth year of high school). He gets an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner that continues until 1969. Before his apprenticeship ends, Daryl Braithwaite begins singing with his first band, Bright Lights, in 1967. Over the next couple of years he goes on to perform in two other bands: House Of Bricks and Samael Lilith. In all three of these groups, Daryl Braithwaite works with bass player Bruce Worrall.\n\nIn 1969 Daryl Braithwaite meets a woman named Micki who becomes his girlfriend.\n\nAlthough Daryl Braithwaite goes on to become the public face of Sherbet, the band is in existence before he joins. The story of Sherbet’s creation begins with Clive Shakespeare.\n\nClive Shakespeare (3 June 1949 – 15 February 2012) is born in Southampton, Hampshire, England. His family migrates to Australia. As a guitar player, Clive Shakespeare forms The Road Agents in Sydney, New South Wales, in 1968. His next group, The Down Town Roll Band, includes drummer Danny Taylor.\n\nSherbet is formed in April 1969. The name Sherbet is borrowed from an effervescent form of confectionary popular with children. The adoption of such a tag suggests that Sherbet’s target audience is youngsters. Keep in mind that, in April 1969 when Sherbet is formed, Clive Shakespeare is himself not yet 20 years old. Sherbet’s original line-up is: Dennis Laughlin (lead vocals), Clive Shakespeare (guitar), Sam See (keyboards, guitar), Doug Rea (bass) (born 10 October 1948) and Danny Taylor (drums).\n\nThree months later, in July 1969, Sherbet experiences its first line-up change. Alan Sandow takes over from Danny Taylor on drums. Alan Sandow is born 28 September 1952 in Adelaide, South Australia. He attends Newington College from 1964 to 1968. Although Sherbet may court younger listeners, Sandow’s musical tastes are a bit broader. He claims to listen to “jazzmen and everything.” Some consider him ‘easily the best musician’ in the group. Alan Sandow is also perhaps the most macho of the bunch, his live performance characterised by ‘his rugged torso awash with…copious sweat.’ When not playing with Sherbet, he tears along the countryside on his motorcycle.\n\nBass player Doug Rea leaves Sherbet before the end of 1969.\n\nDaryl Braithwaite joins Sherbet early in 1970 as second vocalist, backing up Dennis Laughlin. Braithwaite’s friend, Bruce Worrall, fills the bass role vacated by Doug Rea.\n\nSherbet’s first single is released on Festival Records in April 1970. ‘Crimson Ships’ is a cover version of a song originally recorded by British pop group Badfinger earlier in 1970. Dennis Laughlin is the vocalist on ‘Crimson Ships’ but, by the time the song is released, he has left Sherbet. Daryl Braithwaite steps up to fill the lead vocalist role.\n\nSam See leaves Sherbet in 1970. He later shows up in The Stockley, See & Mason Band at the end of the 1970s.\n\nBy the end of 1970 the revised Sherbet consists of: Daryl Braithwaite (vocals), Clive Shakespeare (guitar), Garth Porter (keyboards), Bruce Worrall (bass) and Alan Sandow (drums).\n\nGarth Porter is born 24 September 1948 in Hamilton, New Zealand. “My first introduction to music was tinkering around on the family piano,” Porter recalls. “My first inspiration…was probably The Shadows [the backing band for British pop star Cliff Richard who also made instrumental records without the singer] and then on to The Beatles [Britain’s biggest 1960s pop group]. I decided then that I really wanted to join a rock ‘n’ roll band. I played in a lot of bands and then I eventually found one band that shared all my musical directions and ambitions. And that was Sherbet.”\n\nSherbet release two singles in 1971, both under Festival’s Infinity imprint, the label that will be their home for most of their career. ‘Can You Feel It Baby’ (AUS no. 16) is issued in March and ‘Free The People’ (AUS no. 18) in October. Both of these tracks are cover versions. ‘Can You Feel It Baby’ was first recorded by Blue Mink in 1970. ‘Free The People’ was recorded by Delaney And Bonnie (and written by Barbara Keith) in 1970. ‘Can You Feel It Baby’ is cool and breezy and showcases a falsetto vocal from Daryl Braithwaite. His adopted high voice is also employed on the more oddball ‘Free The People’, a semi-vaudeville gospel tune underpinned by a tuba (!). In 1971 Sherbet also issues the EP ‘Can You Feel It Baby’ (AUS no. 22) produced by Pat Aulton.\n\nSherbet compete in 1971’s ‘Battle of the Sounds’ sponsored by Hoadley’s, an Australian company that manufactures chocolate bars. They lose to a group called Fraternity, an outfit that includes Bon Scott, later to become famous as the vocalist of hard rock band AC/DC.\n\nBruce Worrall leaves Sherbet in 1972. This clears the way for new bass player Tony Mitchell, who is born 5 September 1951 in Sydney, New South Wales. His addition in January 1972 gives Sherbet a stable line-up consisting of Daryl Braithwaite (vocals), Clive Shakespeare (guitar), Garth Porter (keyboards), Tony Mitchell (bass) and Alan Sandow (drums).\n\nSherbet may be described as a bubblegum act or a teenybopper band. However this does them a disservice. More correctly, Sherbet is a pop group. Garth Porter’s inspiration, The Beatles, was a pop group. It is possible to be a pop group and have significant musical talent. Daryl Braithwaite is described as ‘a soul-style singer’ – which may be a little strong. It is more accurate to say he has a ‘Steve Winwood-esque vocal style.’ Winwood sang for British pop bands The Spencer Davis Group and Traffic in the 1960s, but his grainy voice belied him being a young white Brit and invoked memories of Ray Charles, the rhythm and blues – perhaps even soul – singer. “The image we wanted when we started off [was] like The Small Faces,” Braithwaite claims. Between Steve Winwood and The Small Faces, gritty British pop bands of the 1960s, rests Sherbet’s more-than-just-pop style.\n\nPart of what Daryl Braithwaite refers to as “the Sherbet stigma, the teenybopper tag” has to do with their personal charisma and visual appeal. It’s impossible to deny that ‘they were the archetypal 1970s girl fodder pop band – groomed hair, colourful satin stage outfits.’ Daryl Braithwaite carries himself with the casual confidence of the school captain, the star of the cricket team, the impossible object of every young girl’s adoration. As for being a pop star, he says, “It’s what I like doing [singing in a band], yet it’s got its drawbacks as well.” He points to a lack of privacy and the loneliness of life on tour. “The greatest demand, the greatest thrill, is being on stage.” This sentiment about live performance is echoed by Tony Mitchell: “The best buzz I could ever get, the best feeling I could ever get.” Garth Porter shares Braithwaite’s misgivings about being a teen idol: “I used to have thirty or forty kids outside the house all weekend. They actually pitched tents in my front yard and they’d scream and holler whenever I passed a window. They forced us very inwards. It was a worry even going to the shops.”\n\nMost of Sherbet’s songs from 1972 to 1975 are written by the team of Garth Porter and Clive Shakespeare. Clive suggests that songwriting is “about the inner emotions we go through, that everyone goes through.” Garth explains, “What we do is get the idea for the song individually, then I take my idea to Clive once I’ve turned it into some sort of recognisable shape. Then we get together and work on it from there.” From 1976 Tony Mitchell becomes Garth Porter’s songwriting partner.\n\nSherbet hones their craft in 1972 with a residence at Jonathan’s Disco in Sydney, New South Wales. They play there for eight months, giving seven hour shows (8 P.M. to 3 A.M.), four nights a week. They receive two hundred and sixty dollars a week. One of those who attends a Sherbet gig at Jonathan’s in 1972 is Roger Davies. Having dropped out of an economics degree at Monash University, 20 year old Davies is writing for the Australian counter-culture newspaper ‘The Daily Planet’ and working as a roadie for rock band Company Caine. Davies is impressed by Sherbet and, later in the year, becomes their manager.\n\nIn June 1972 Sherbet releases ‘You’re All Woman’ (AUS no. 19), a slow, grinding boogie penned by Ted Mulry, a local singer-songwriter. October’s ‘You’ve Got The Gun’ (AUS no. 27) is their first single composed within the band. The song is co-written by Garth Porter, Clive Shakespeare and Daryl Braithwaite. It’s a funky, bass-heavy number that, again, makes use of Braithwaite’s falsetto. However it is in his natural voice that he barks, “You shot me, but I didn’t die / You were Bonnie and I was Clyde,” referencing the American bank-robbers Bonnie and Clyde.\n\nIn 1972 Sherbet serve as support act on an Australian tour by U.S. band Creedence Clearwater Revival.\n\nSherbet wins the 1972 Hoadley’s ‘Battle of the Sounds’ contest. This is the last year in which the contest is held.\n\nIn 1972 Sherbet vocalist Daryl Braithwaite marries his girlfriend, Micki.\n\nSherbet’s debut album, ‘Time Change – A Natural Progression’ (1972) (AUS no. 66), is released in December. Production duties are shared by Howard Gable, Pat Aulton and Ross Linton. This album includes the earlier singles ‘Can You Feel It Baby’, ‘Free The People’, ‘You’re All Woman’ and ‘You’ve Got The Gun’.\n\nSherbet releases two singles in 1973. In June there is a bouncy cover version of Elvis Presley’s 1956 hit ‘Hound Dog’ (AUS no. 18). August brings the original composition ‘Cassandra’ (AUS no. 9). A dramatic ode to “This girl from far beyond the stars / Who do you think you are?”, ‘Cassandra’ has a soaring string section in the background. ‘Cassandra’ also appears on the album ‘On With The Show’ (1973) (AUS no. 13) in November. This disc is produced by Tweed Harris. A 1973 Australian stage production of ‘Tommy’, the rock opera created by British band The Who, sees Daryl Braithwaite performing alongside The Who’s Keith Moon. Sherbet wins the ‘Most Popular Group’ title for the first time in the 1973 ‘King of Pop’ awards sponsored by ‘TV Week’ magazine. They win the same award in every subsequent year up to and including 1978, the final year for the ‘King of Pop’ ceremonies.\n\n‘So Glad You’re Mine’ (AUS no. 44) in March starts 1974 for the band. More impressive is June’s ‘Slipstream’ (AUS no. 5). “With you by my side / Like birds we will fly / Into the slipstream,” suggest the lyrics in this song. Garth Porter deploys some wailing sci-fi sounds from his keyboards in this song. “I really love playing keyboards because of the range of keyboard instruments that are available today,” he enthuses. ‘Silvery Moon’ (AUS no. 5) in August has tight vocal harmonies and light syncopation. ‘Slipstream’ and ‘Silvery Moon’ are both on the third Sherbet album, ‘Slipstream’ (1974) (AUS no. 3), in September. This album is produced by Richard Batchens.\n\nIn October 1974 Sherbet’s lead vocalist, Daryl Braithwaite begins a parallel solo career by issuing the single ‘You’re My World’ (AUS no. 1). Without Garth Porter and Clive Shakespeare as songwriters, Braithwaite’s solo work mixes cover versions and new songs from other composers. ‘You’re My World’ was originally recorded by British songstress Cilla Black in 1964. It’s a big ballad and, as sung by Sherbet’s heartthrob, seems designed to quicken the collective pulse of his many adoring young fans.\n\nThe Sherbet live album, ‘In Concert’ (1975) (AUS no. 11), in March is matched in the same month by ‘Wishing Well’ backed with ‘Freedom’ (AUS no. 52). ‘Wishing Well’ is a cover version of a 1972 song by Free, a hard rock act from the U.K., and shows a welcome heavier side to Sherbet. The pseudo-gospel ‘Freedom’ hails from the previous year’s ‘Slipstream’ album and is a Garth Porter and Clive Shakespeare original. In a tactical move, Sherbet flexes their commercial muscles by switching to EMI Records in 1975. As it turns out, they record only one single for EMI before returning to Festival / Infinity…but it is their best single. ‘Summer Love’ (AUS no. 1), released in March 1976, is as effervescent as a soft drink commercial, but with less hard-sell. ‘Summer love / Is like no other love,” insists Daryl Braithwaite in the lyric. A keen surfer, he seems to relish the warm weather vibe: “When you bring your lovin’ to me / Let your love come easy and free, yeah.” A bluesy mid-section to the song is evidence of Sherbet’s growing musical prowess. A catchy tune, a good-time feel and strong musicianship are the qualities that make ‘Summer Love’ rise above the pack.\n\nIn August 1975 Daryl Braithwaite releases his second solo single, ‘Cavalry’ (AUS no. 13). In 1975 he also wins the individual ‘King of Pop’ accolade and repeats that feat in 1976 and 1977 thanks to his popularity with the young voters.\n\nBack at Festival, Sherbet’s next single, August’s ‘Life’ (AUS no. 4), may be their most musically complex and ambitious. It surges with power and drama, drenching Daryl Braithwaite’s voice with echo. The double A side single ‘Only One You’ b/w ‘Matter Of Time’ (AUS no. 5) offers markedly different sounds for the group. ‘Only One You’ is a pretty acoustic ballad that Braithwaite tackles with poise and restraint. ‘Matter Of Time’ features Garth Porter on lead vocals. It apes 1950s rock ‘n’ roll playfully to the accompaniment of a rough-edged guitar. Released in November, the album ‘Life…Is For Living’ (1975) (AUS no. 3) includes ‘Life’, ‘Only One You’ and ‘Matter Of Time’. Displaying new confidence Porter and Clive Shakespeare co-produce with John L. Sayers.\n\nThe sublime pop of ‘Child’s Play’ (AUS no. 4), released in January 1976, is Clive Shakespeare’s final bow with Sherbet.\n\nDuring the recording of ‘Life…Is For Living’, Clive Shakespeare decided he had enough and quits Sherbet in 1976. Given Shakespeare’s importance in the group and the expected brief life-span of a ‘girl fodder pop band’, there are predictions that Sherbet’s time is up. This talk proves incorrect. Bassist Tony Mitchell ably fills the songwriting void – but the guitar-player deficiency is less easily remedied.\n\nGunther Gorman is brought in ‘as a temporary fill’ in on guitar. However, he is soon replaced by Harvey James. Born in Sheffield, England as Harvey James Harrop, Harvey James (20 September 1952 – 15 January 2011) migrates to Australia with his parents in the early 1960s. A veteran of other notable Australian bands Mississippi and Ariel, Harvey James brings an impressive new edge to Sherbet with his vibrato-laden guitar work. Harvey James is already married. He wed Australian-born Christine Marshall during Ariel’s U.K. tour circa 1973. The couple have three children: Gabriel, Alexandra and Joshua. None of this stops Sherbet’s teenage female fans idolising the newcomer just as much as the rest of Sherbet.\n\nApril 1976 brings another Daryl Braithwaite solo single, a tinkling piano ballad called ‘Old Sid’ (AUS no. 9).\n\nThe new line-up of Sherbet is in the recording studio ‘within weeks’. The result is ‘their finest hour’, their best album. ‘Howzat’ (1976) (AUS no. 1) is released in July. It is produced by Sherbet and Richard Lush, a canny fellow influenced by George Martin’s work with The Beatles. The title track, ‘Howzat’ (AUS no. 1, UK no. 4) is the first product of the new songwriting team of Garth Porter and Tony Mitchell. ‘Howzat’ is a term from the game of cricket. During a match, when a bowler believes he has successfully got a batsman out, he appeals to the umpire with the cry, “Howzat!?” (i.e. ‘How’s that?’). Sherbet’s song transfers the general concept to a romantic setting: “Howzat / You messed about / I caught you out.” From slow, funky verses to a more upbeat chorus, ‘Howzat’ is musically dynamic and Harvey James’ drawling guitar solo is an added bonus. One of the major strengths of the album ‘Howzat’ is the incredible diversity of the songs on the disc. ‘Can’t Find True Love’ is a country music hoedown, ‘Lady Of The Night’ (co-written by Porter, Mitchell and Daryl Braithwaite) is a sympathetic ballad about a prostitute, and the closing track, ‘I’ll Be Coming Home’, is a humorous pub sing-along to an (original) 1940s style music hall number. ‘Motor Of Love’ and ‘Gimme Love’ are more straightforward songs, albeit with a rockier inclination than previously heard in Sherbet’s pop songs. ‘If I Had My Way’ is a high quality ballad while ‘The Swap (You Can Get The Lot)’ is murky funk. That leaves the two songs that, apart from ‘Howzat’, are the album’s highlights. Garth Porter takes the microphone to sing ‘Hollywood Dreaming’ (AUS no. 43), a song that goes from black-and-white to explosive colour in musical terms, matching its celluloid theme. The brooding, organ-rich ‘Blueswalkin’’ makes the most of Sherbet’s Small Faces / Steve Winwood inclinations, as Daryl Braithwaite toughs out the lyric: “Blueswalkin’ / Tryin’ to get you out of my mind / Blueswalkin’ / Got to get away to unwind.” Drummer Alan Sandow gets a co-writing credit with Porter and Mitchell for ‘Blueswalkin’’. ‘Howzat!’ is a strong showing and the group’s masterwork.\n\nTo promote the album, Sherbet undertakes an ‘Around Australian in 80 Days’ tour in mid-1976. They are accompanied on the trek by The Ted Mulry Gang (or TMG), the group formed later by the author of Sherbet’s 1972 hit ‘You’re All Woman’.\n\nSherbet also makes some ripples in overseas markets at this time and head off to investigate those possibilities. “It wasn’t so much important to go overseas. It was just a matter of getting out of Australia,” suggests Garth Porter. “It was just life in a fishbowl. We were overexposed to the hilt and working non-stop.”\n\nWith the common language of cricket, Sherbet’s ‘Howzat’ translates into a hit single in England as well. Although no such cultural link aids them in the U.S., Sherbet also does some promotion in the American market and MCA Records takes an interest in them.\n\nWhile Sherbet is out of town, another single is released in December 1976. ‘Rock Me Gently’ (AUS no. 6) has a swaying rhythm and pattering drums. The flipside is a 1976 re-recording of the group’s 1972 hit ‘You’ve Got The Gun’.\n\nReturning to Australia in December 1976, Sherbet plays more concerts. They use their increased commercial clout to start their own Razzle Records imprint, distributed by Festival.\n\n‘Photoplay’ (1977) (AUS no. 4) is released in June. It is co-produced by Sherbet and Richard Lush. In some overseas markets the album is retitled ‘Magazine’. This may be to tie in with the single, ‘Magazine Madonna’ (AUS no. 2). The song is about “a model in a magazine” with “A supernatural smile / A cover girl with a magic style.” It is an appropriately glossy production with a fairly complex arrangement. The other well-known song from this set is ‘High Rollin’’ (AUS no. 33), a muscular pop tune with a hand-clapping introduction. Sherbet lends this song to the Australian film, ‘High Rolling’ (1977). During the recording of the ‘Photoplay’ album, Harvey James leaves the group to be replaced by Jim Gannon. However, within forty-eight hours, the ‘musical difficulties’ are resolved and Harvey James is back in the fold, leaving Jim Gannon Sherbet’s shortest-serving member.\n\nIn October 1977 Daryl Braithwaite’s next solo single is ‘Afterglow’ (AUS no. 37), a Small Faces song from 1969.\n\n‘Caught In The Act…Live’ (1977) (AUS no. 33) in October is taken from Sherbet’s concerts to promote ‘Photoplay’. A live version of The Beatles’ 1965 hit ‘Nowhere Man’ (AUS no. 40) is given a fairly straight reading and released as a single.\n\nDaryl Braithwaite’s solo single, ‘If You Walked Away’ (AUS no. 14) – a soft rocker, arrives in June 1978.\n\n‘Sherbet’ (1978) (AUS no. 6) in August includes ‘(Feels Like It’s) Slippin’ Away’ (AUS no. 22) and the long-distance traveller anthem, ‘Another Night On The Road’ (AUS no. 10). This album is recorded in the U.S.A. and produced by William Bowden. This is part of a new overseas record deal arranged with RSO, the label owned by expatriate Australian Robert Stigwood. It also involves re-branding the group with the name Highway. So when it is released in the U.S.A. in February 1979, the album is retitled ‘Highway 1’. The change may give the group a more mature image, but it also makes them seem like a corporate rock act. ‘In Australia, [the name] Highway is not greeted well by the media.’\n\nDaryl Braithwaite’s January 1979 single ‘Why Do I Break It Up’ (AUS no. 35) is followed by his first full-length solo album, ‘Out On The Fringe’ (1979).\n\nThe February 1979 single, ‘Angela’ (AUS no. 85), is the last issued under the name of Sherbet. ‘Angela’ is from the soundtrack for the Australian film ‘Shapshot’ (1979), starring Sigrid Thornton. The July 1979 single ‘Heart Get Ready’ (AUS no. 89) is credited to Highway both in Australia and overseas.\n\nThe change to Highway does not give the group a breakthrough overseas and they are left with a dissatisfied home market as well. After taking stock, the group elects to press on using a third name, The Sherbs. This modified version of the group’s original sobriquet signals their switch to a more new wave orientation.\n\nThe marriage of vocalist Daryl Braithwaite and his wife Micki comes to an end around 1979/1980.\n\nIn 1980 The Sherbs release a volley of singles – ‘Never Surrender’, ‘I’m OK’, ‘Julie & Me’ and ‘I Have The Skill’ (US no. 14) – all of which fail to chart in Australia. The album, ‘The Skill’ (1980) (AUS no. 85, US no. 100), is co-produced by the group and Richard Lush. ‘The Skill’ consists largely of group compositions with the odd solo songwriting credit for Garth Porter. Despite the lack of commercial impact, The Sherbs’ dogged persistence elicits grudging admiration.\n\n1981 brings the singles ‘Crazy In The Night’ and ‘Free The Sailor’ and the album ‘Defying Gravity’ (1981), again co-produced by The Sherbs and Richard Lush. Another single from the album is 1982’s ‘We Ride Tonight’ (US no. 26).\n\nGuitarist Tony Leigh replaces Harvey James in 1982. ‘Some People’, ‘Don’t Throw It All Away’ and ‘Shaping Up’ (AUS no. 76) are released in 1982 as is the EP ‘Shaping Up’, produced by Richard Lush. The Arrow’ in 1983 is the only activity from the band in that year.\n\n“We’d passed our use-by date well and truly,” concedes Garth Porter. “After three years [as The Sherbs] we saw that it just wasn’t working,” adds Daryl Braithwaite.\n\nA final tour is undertaken early in 1984 with guest appearances from Clive Shakespeare and Harvey James. The group’s final single, ‘Tonight Will Last Forever’ (AUS no. 69), is released in February 1984 – under the name of Sherbet.\n\nAlthough Sherbet never officially reforms full-time, they do get together a number of times in subsequent years for special occasions, one-off shows and the like. The first such reunion is in 1998, with both Clive Shakespeare and Harvey James on guitars, and John Watson substituting on drums for Alan Sandow. This reunion is for an ABC television New Year’s Eve special. Further Sherbet reunions take place in 2001, 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2011.\n\nDaryl Braithwaite marries his second wife, Sarah Taylor, and they have a son, Oscar (born May 1986).\n\nDaryl Braithwaite resumes his solo career. He issues the albums ‘Edge’ (1988) (AUS no. 1), ‘Rise’ (1990) (AUS no. 3), ‘Taste The Salt’ (1993) (AUS no. 13), ‘Snapshot’ (2003), ‘The Lemon Tree’ (2008) (AUS no. 74), ‘Forever The Tourist’ (2013) (AUS no. 47) and the two CD compilation album ‘Days Go By’ (2017) (AUS no. 5). Some of his better known singles from his latter solo career are ‘As The Days Go By’ (AUS no. 11) and ‘All I Do’ (AUS no. 23) (both from 1988), ‘One Summer’ (AUS no. 8) in 1989 and ‘The Horses’ (AUS no. 1) in 1991.\n\nHarvey James dies on 15 January 2011 from lung cancer. He is survived by his second wife, Fay Carlin, and the children from his first marriage.\n\nClive Shakespeare dies from prostate cancer on 15 February 2012.\n\n‘Sherbet forged the original Australian touring circuit…They were the earliest pop group to take on Australia’s immense size.’ Although this was a tribute to the band’s credentials as a road-tested outfit, it is perhaps more significant in light of their populist impulses. Sherbet was not a trendy, elitist operation; they were aiming to be as accessible as possible. They certainly attracted young girls who idolised them as handsome young men, but they were not merely a teenybopper band. Pop music at its best embraces the widest possible audience and Sherbet’s general appeal is sometimes underestimated. They maintained too lengthy a career to be sustained merely by screaming little girls. At their height, from 1973 to 1977, Sherbet embodied a wider Australian character that symbolised the 1970s. ‘Sherbet was Australia’s most popular group of the 1970s.’ ‘The band achieved everything that an Australian pop band of the time could reasonably aspire to.’\n\nSources:\n\n‘The Big Australian Rock Book’, ‘Sherbet’ by Bruce Elder (Megabooks, 1985) p. 124\n\n‘30th Anniversary Celebration Collection’ – Sleeve notes by Glenn A.

Here we go now…a sociology lecture, with a bit of psychology, a bit of neurology, a bit of f***ology…” – Johnny Rotten’s preamble to The Sex Pistols’ version of ‘No Fun’\n\nOn 18 June 1977 the British singles chart shows a blank space in the no. 1 position. How can this be? Is it an error? No. The song is banned from the British Broadcasting Corporation’s charts. The BBC also places a ban on radio airplay for the track. Yet, in spite of such a media blackout, the single still sells sufficient copies to reach the top. This is incredible. Something unprecedented is happening here. Some act has recorded an unidentified song that has – somehow! – defied an embargo from the authorities to connect with consumers in such vast numbers as to be the week’s best-selling single. The song is ‘God Save The Queen’ by The Sex Pistols.\n\nThe man who is the public face of The Sex Pistols is Johnny Rotten. He is born John Joseph Lydon on 31 January 1956. His place of birth is officially given as Holloway, London, England, but it is possible he was actually born in County Galway, Ireland, before his parents – John Cristopher Lydon and Eileen Lydon (nee Barry) – moved to England. John has three younger brothers: Jimmy, Bobby and Martin. “Us growing up in London [in the Finsbury Park area] was no fun,” he recalls. “It was serious hardcore…We’re tough lads, us.” John adds, “I had an Irish Catholic education. Horrible nuns, vindictive and cruel.” When he is 7, John Lydon suffers from spinal meningitis. It is quite serious, putting him in a temporary coma and leading to lengthy hospital stays. “I was a very sickly boy when I was young,” he confirms. Returning to his Catholic school, John finds the academic work very difficult, at least partly because of all the time he’s missed from class. He glumly observes, “You learn to expect nothing. You get nothing. You start off in school and they take your soul away.” John Lydon is expelled from school when he is 15. He does ‘as little of anything as possible.’ John Lydon spends some time at Hackney & Stoke Newington College for Further Education. It is here he meets John Simon Ritchie who will re-enter this story at a later point. John Lydon moves out and recalls the parting with his father: “We never ever spoke, really, seriously at all until the day I left home.”\n\nAlthough John Lydon (as Johnny Rotten) may be the catalyst for The Sex Pistols’ eventual emergence, in another way, their story begins with their guitarist.\n\nSteve Jones is born Stephen Philip Jones on 3 September 1955 in London, England. His father, Don Jarvis, is an amateur boxer and abandons the family when Steve is 2. Steve’s mother, Mary, is a hairdresser. She soon finds a new partner who becomes Steve’s step-father. After living for a time with Steve’s grandparents, the three of them move into a single bedroom flat in Shepherd’s Bush. It is an unhappy childhood. Steve feels his mother hates him. By 1968, Steve Jones has a criminal record and spends eighteen months in reform school. When he gets out, Steve leaves school, though he is virtually illiterate. His step-father tosses the boy out when he is 16. Uninterested in getting a job, Steve Jones half-heartedly works as a window-cleaner. In 1972 he forms a band called Q.T. Jones And The Sex Pistols. Steve Jones is the vocalist, not the guitarist, in this group. By the time he is 18, Steve Jones’ criminal past threatens to land him in jail and he realises that music is the only way out of the situation.\n\nOne of Steve Jones’ bandmates is Paul Cook, a drummer. Paul Thomas Cook is born 20 July 1956 in Hammersmith, London. He attends Christopher Wren School in White City Estate, Shepherd’s Bush. It is here that Paul Cook meets Steve Jones. With school friend Wally Nightingale, the three boys form a group called The Strand – named after a 1973 song called ‘Do The Strand’ by British glam rock act Roxy Music. This means The Strand replaces Q.T. Jones And The Sex Pistols (formed in 1972). While playing drums in the group, Paul Cook works as an electrician’s apprentice. It is a post he retains for much of his time in The Sex Pistols, only quitting after the band is a success.\n\nThe other member of the embryonic Sex Pistols is bass player Glen Matlock, born 27 August 1956 in Paddington, London. Glen may be the quietest and ‘nicest’ of the group but, perhaps for that reason, he is not very well liked by the others.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Wally Nightingale has been dropped and the group are called The Swankers. Glen Matlock is working at a clothing boutique owned by Malcolm McLaren and McLaren’s wife, Vivienne Westwood. The other boys hang about there in lieu of anything better to do.\n\nMalcolm McLaren will become the manager of The Sex Pistols. Started in 1971, the King’s Road shop he owns with Vivienne Westwood is known as ‘Let It Rock’. In August 1973, along with several other stores in the area, they are invited to exhibit their wares in New York, U.S.A. They don’t do very well with their line of apparel but, during the trip, McLaren’s attention is claimed by a band called The New York Dolls. A kind of American version of glam rock, the members of The New York Dolls are attired in gaudy fabrics, platform boots, and the all-male line-up is heavily smeared with make-up. McLaren follows them about and sees the group ‘taunting audiences, making Nazi jokes, vomiting in front of the press.’ While some (most?) would find this off-putting, McLaren is entranced by the business of outrage. Late in 1974, The New York Dolls lose their recording contract and Malcolm McLaren briefly relocates to New York, becoming the group’s manager in their dying days.\n\nReturning to the U.K., Malcom McLaren’s mind is still preoccupied with his taste for rock, fame and sensationalism. His boutique goes through a number of name changes from ‘Let It Rock’ to ‘Too Fast To Live, Too Young To Die’ to ‘Sex’ to ‘Seditionaries’. As mentioned, Glen Matlock is one of the shop’s employees. McLaren is aware that Glen has a band. However, McLaren thinks they would be better served with a new vocalist. He has in mind another youth hanging about his shop. His name is John Lydon.\n\nBefore joining the band, John Lydon is described as a ‘sickly, quiet, bookish type’. Yet he is also brash, insolent and irreverent, the very qualities that Malcolm McLaren thinks will make him an ideal frontman for the band he envisions. John Lydon is given the new sobriquet Johnny Rotten. This may be because of his ‘cheesy, crud-caked incisors’ or it may be because of his habit of saying, “You’re rotten, you are!” He auditions by singing American shock rocker Alice Cooper’s ‘School’s Out’. It’s debatable how much Johnny Rotten is just John Lydon unleashed and how much it is an invented character he plays. Reputedly, he bases the Johnny Rotten persona on Laurence Olivier’s performance of the hunchbacked title character in the film ‘Richard III’ (1955). Paul Cook recalls, “We thought, he’s got what we want. Bit of a lunatic. A frontman. That’s what we was after: a frontman who had definite ideas about what he wanted to do and he’d definitely got them. And we knew straight away. Even though he couldn’t sing. We wasn’t really interested in that ‘cos we were still learning to play at the time.”\n\nSteve Jones is convinced to step aside in favour of Johnny Rotten as vocalist. Jones becomes the group’s guitarist and first plays live on stage with the band after only playing guitar for three months. Malcolm McLaren takes credit for both rechristening Johnny Rotten and renaming The Swankers as The Sex Pistols. The latter claim at least seems doubtful since, back in 1972, Steve Jones was leading Q.T. Jones And The Sex Pistols. The Sex Pistols is a name suggestive of male genitalia. In any case, The Sex Pistols are officially founded in August 1975 with the line-up of: Johnny Rotten (vocals), Steve Jones (guitar), Glen Matlock (bass) and Paul Cook (drums).\n\nThe Sex Pistols are a punk rock band. America’s Iggy Pop And The Stooges had been playing a sort of proto-punk rock since 1968. The New York Dolls antics certainly informed Malcolm McLaren’s vision. The Ramones, another American act, were perhaps the first punk band in 1974. Johnny Rotten snarls that there is “a lot of talk about that New York started the punk scene and we ripped them off or some bulls***. People think we were influenced by it. We weren’t.” If The Sex Pistols are not the first punk band, they become the definitive punk rock band.\n\nPunk rock strips away the artificiality accumulated by rock music in the many years since its birth in the mid-1950s. Even obviously fake names like Johnny Rotten are throwbacks to first generation rockers who adopted blatantly false stage-names like Billy Fury, Marty Wilde and Johnny Gentle. Punk’s nearest cousins are glam rock and heavy metal. It borrows the crunchy pop sound of glam, but not the look. Similarly, the devastating ultra-loud guitars of heavy metal are repurposed by punk, but metal’s long hair and fantasy images are ditched. Punk thumbs its nose at the pretensions of art rock and the cult of personality around musical skills. Punk has no guitar heroes. It glories in the basic, rudimentary sound and almost inept musicianship. When asked about his lack of musical ability, Steve Jones proclaims, “We’re not into music. We’re into chaos.” Punk is not about studying at a conservatory; it’s about angry young people making themselves heard. A lost generation of unemployed youths with (at best) limited prospects for the future give the world an earful of their discontent. Its fashion is anti-fashion. “I made ugly beautiful,” boasts Rotten.\n\nThe Sex Pistols songwriting is credited jointly to the four members of the band. The level of participation of various individuals varies from song to song. “We didn’t work on songs like for ages. They came about very quickly,” suggests Paul Cook. Johnny Rotten points out, “I had very little at all to do with The Pistols’ music. I knew nothing about music. While they’d be fiddling about, I’d be in the corner writing. I’d just shout out if I liked certain bits and I had lyrics to fit in…You don’t need to be technically proficient at your art to write songs.” Rotten concludes, “We credited the band with songwriting…Once you start separating people when it comes to copyright on publishing, you’re not a band anymore.”\n\nThe Sex Pistols claim they want “more bands like us.” They get them. England explodes with a proliferation of punk rock bands: The Damned, The Buzzcocks, The Clash (The Pistols’ biggest rivals – though Johnny Rotten insists, “[We had] none of the deadpan, dreary political opinions like The Clash wallowed in.”), The Jam, The Stranglers, Sham ’69, Stiff Little Fingers and Siouxsie And The Banshees amongst others. However, history tends to inflate the legend of Britain’s punk rock revolution. “[Punk] wasn’t big at all. It was very small,” says Johnny Rotten in clarification. It’s true – but the music’s cultural impact and subsequent influence is disproportionately many times greater than its commercial success at the time.\n\nThe Sex Pistols first gig is at Saint Martin’s College of Art in London on 6 November 1975. Four and a half months later they play to an audience of fifty people at London’s 100 Club on 30 March 1976. In June they begin a weekly residency at the same venue. A lot of the early audience consists of what Johnny Rotten describes as “Malcolm McLaren’s friends.” He suggests, “It was just a clothes horse display by that lot. None of the band wanted to be part of that.” The group begins playing gigs in Milton Keynes, St Albans, Welwyn Garden City and what Rotten says are “all those godforsaken new towns.” Paul Cook insists, “It was a chance for us to get away from the bulls*** of London.” “They had nothin’ [else] at all,” leers Rotten. “That’s what built The Sex Pistols’ crowd.” The punk fans become known as ‘the Bromley Contingent’. Their number includes Rotten’s old school friend, John Simon Ritchie, and Siouxsie Sioux, later of Siouxsie And The Banshees. A show at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall by The Sex Pistols on 20 July 1976 acts as inspiration for both the future members of The Buzzcocks and post punk outfit Joy Division.\n\nAlthough many of the new breed of punk rock acts appear on do-it-yourself independent record labels, on 10 October 1976 The Sex Pistols sign up with a major label, EMI, for forty thousand pounds. EMI outbid Polydor to secure the deal. A debut single, ‘Anarchy In The U.K.’ is scheduled to be released on 3 December.\n\nOn 1 December 1976 The Sex Pistols appear on ‘The Today Show’, a television program on Britain’s ITV Network. They are a last minute replacement for British glam rock group Queen. The host, Bill Grundy, taunts The Sex Pistols about their ‘nasty’ reputation. Although most of the band seem to swear under their breaths and are generally inaudible, Glen Matlock reputedly says “f***”. Actually, Steve Jones is a lot more voluble, uttering, “You dirty b*****d, you dirty f***er, f***in’ rotter.” Since this is broadcast at 6.15 P.M., it causes a furore. The next day, the ‘filthy’ Sex Pistols are splashed across newspaper headlines.\n\nAlthough EMI ‘squirms in embarrassment’, ‘Anarchy In The U.K.’ (UK no. 38) duly appears on 3 December 1976. Paul Cook reports that, “It was Glen [Matlock’s] riff originally, and Steve [Jones] beefed it up.” Johnny Rotten chips in: “When I finally finished the words, Glen was completely furious.” Cook concurs that, “Glen felt a little precious about it being his song.” Rotten adds, “He thought it was appalling and a silly idea for a song.” For his part, Glen Matlock claims, “I had this idea for a sort of ‘theme tune’…John came up these amazing lyrics a half hour later.” “I am an antichrist, I am an anarchist,” howls Rotten in this sonic hand grenade of punk fury. “Anarchy for the U.K. / It’s coming some time may be,” warns the lyric. Anarchy is a political state without formal rules, a condition of chaos and disorder.\n\nWith this single in the marketplace, The Sex Pistols embark on a national tour. However their tabloid press infamy results in them being banned from ninety per cent of the towns on the itinerary. The Sex Pistols only play in five cities, one of them being Manchester. EMI are dismayed. In January 1977 Steve Jones is accused of vomiting on an old woman in a lounge at Heathrow Airport. This is the last straw and EMI ends their contract with The Sex Pistols on 6 January 1977. ‘Anarchy In The U.K.’ is withdrawn from circulation. EMI’s press release cites The Sex Pistols’ ‘disgraceful aggressive behaviour’ and EMI’s obligation to ‘encourage restraint.’\n\nThe Sex Pistols begin work on recording their first album even though they are currently without a recording contract. The work exacerbates tensions within the band. On 15 February 1977 bassist Glen Matlock quits – or is kicked out. Matlock wearily explains, “There was no working relationship” anymore between him and the group. He is “sick of all the bulls***.” An appalled Johnny Rotten complains that Matlock “wanted to make us fun, like The Beatles,” the loveable 1960s British pop group. Glen Matlock is replaced in The Sex Pistols by Rotten’s friend, John Simon Ritchie, now known as Sid Vicious.\n\nSid Vicious (10 May 1957 – 2 February 1979) is born John Simon Ritchie a.k.a. John Beverley in London, England. He is the child of John Simon Ritchie, senior, a grenadier guard in the British army, who leaves shortly after the child’s birth, never to return. Sid’s mother, Anne, marries Christopher Beverley, who becomes Sid’s stepfather. Christopher Beverley dies six months later. Anne Beverley is a heroin user – and sometimes also sells the drug – during Sid’s childhood. After the end of her marriage, she goes to Ibiza in Spain. They return to England in 1965. Sid meets Johnny Rotten in 1974 at Hackney & Stoke Newington College for Further Education.\n\nThe name Sid Vicious is bestowed on John Simon Ritchie as a joke. “Sid couldn’t punch his way out of a bag of crisps,” mocks Johnny Rotten. Contradicting this are tales of Sid ‘chain-swinging’, ‘beating a rock writer with a chain’, ‘beating up other members of the audience’ and ‘spitting and spraying beer into the audience.’ He first becomes known as part of the Bromley Contingent, the hard core Sex Pistols fans. He then has a brief stint in September 1976 as the drummer in Siouxsie And The Banshees, the band formed by fellow Bromley Contingent identity Siouxsie Sioux. “I was getting my own group together, The Flowers Of Romance,” Sid recounts. Sid is the lead vocalist in the combo. He abandons such plans to join The Sex Pistols. Sid is credited with inventing the pogo, the ‘dance’ move associated with punk. Given the music’s frenetic energy, pogoing involves just bouncing up and down in place. Sid is also noted for wearing a Nazi swastika t-shirt, though Steve Jones is also seen in a similar garment. The Sex Pistols are not really Nazis; they just like to be outrageous. If wearing a swastika provokes a response, so be it, as long as people are shaken from their numb lethargy. Sid Vicious suggests that EMI dropped The Sex Pistols because, “We weren’t nice boys. We were nasty little b*****ds.”\n\nThe Sex Pistols have some doubts about the newcomer. “I kinda regret [Glen Matlock’s] leaving,” says Steve Jones, “because Sid [Vicious] couldn’t play a f***in’ note.” Indeed, Matlock is asked – grudgingly – to temporarily return to help with the recording of The Sex Pistols’ debut album because Sid is so staggeringly inept on the bass.\n\nOn 10 March 1977 A & M Records give The Sex Pistols one hundred and fifty thousand pounds to sign a recording contract with them. A & M boasts they can handle the notorious act. The signing takes place on a trestle table set up in the street in front of Buckingham Palace. Nine days later, A & M fires The Sex Pistols, giving them a seventy-five thousand pound pay-off, without issuing any music by the group. Publicly, the decision of A & M to change their mind is said to be due to ‘the reputation for violence’ accompanying the act. Less officially, ‘acts the Pistols reportedly committed in the A & M offices’, including ‘obscenities members of the group have been hurling at A & M executives at business meetings’, are thought to be responsible for the rift.\n\nOnce again without a recording contract, The Sex Pistols are virtually unable to play any gigs. Such is their infamy that no venue is willing to risk allowing them on stage. They may be ‘the hottest act in Britain’, but they are also in limbo.\n\nVirgin Records, founded by the entrepreneur Richard Branson, is the next company to offer a contract to The Sex Pistols. The deal in May 1977 earns the band another fifty thousand pounds. The Sex Pistols’ second single, ‘God Save The Queen’ (U.K. no. 1), is released on 27 May 1977. Although it shares the same title, this is not the British national anthem every schoolboy is taught to sing. Paul Cook remembers that, “It started with Glen [Matlock’s] bass riff. Then [guitarist] Steve [Jones] got hold of it, then I started playing. Suddenly, John came up with ‘God Save The Queen’. We thought, ‘What’s this?’” Johnny Rotten explains, “I had the lyrics ready. I wrote them a while back, but never used them. The words didn’t fit in with any of the other tunes…It was more like a big tirade.” “God save the Queen” barks Rotten in the lyrics, “The fascist regime / That made you a moron / Potential H-bomb [hydrogen bomb].” The singer denounces the British monarch (“She ain’t no human being”) over buzzsaw guitars. The song ends with the repeated refrain of “no future.” It could be the monarchy that has ‘no future’, but it could just as easily be the country’s dead-end youth who have been handed ‘no future.’ Despite a ban on airplay because of its ‘treasonous sentiments’, the song sails to the top of the charts in a triumph of the power of the group’s fans. The scurrilous effect of the song would be felt at any time, but with Queen Elizabeth II’s Silver Jubilee celebrations set to begin in June 1977, the impact is even greater. “It wasn’t written specifically for the Queen’s anniversary Jubilee,” protests Paul Cook. “We weren’t even aware of it at the time. It wasn’t a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone. No way. It didn’t even click that there was a Jubilee coming up.” The video for ‘God Save The Queen’ is Sid Vicious’ introduction to the general public. ‘God Save The Queen’ is a cracking, muscular effort, but due to its attack on repressive society and its simultaneous heroic triumph over that authority, this is The Sex Pistols’ best song.\n\nOn 18 June 1977 Johnny Rotten is slashed on the face and hands by knife-wielding hoodlums offended by the anti-monarchist sentiments of ‘God Save The Queen’. On 19 June 1977 Paul Cook is bashed with an iron pipe by thugs motivated by the same Royalist impulse.\n\nThe Sex Pistols’ third single, ‘Pretty Vacant’ (UK no. 6), is released in July 1977. A pulsing guitar rises into a rallying cry and the band kick over the barricades, taking flight. The lyric is fairly meaningless and just seems to exist to give Johnny Rotten an excuse to reach the chorus. He wilfully pronounces the title “Pretty…Vay-C***-Ah!” as though the middle syllable of the latter half is the swear word for a part of the female anatomy. “I love to play with words,” Rotten later chortles. “They didn’t mind it on the radio because they didn’t know.” The B side of the single is a cover version of ‘No Fun’, a Stooges’ song from 1969.\n\n“We had to get out of London,” Paul Cook says. “[Manager] Malcolm [McLaren] wanted us to leave for a while because we were causing too much trouble at the time…We went down to [the Isle of] Jersey, then had quite a good time in Berlin [in Germany] for a couple of weeks’ holiday.” Johnny Rotten adds, “Berlin and its decadence was a good idea. The song came about from that.” ‘The song’ is ‘Holidays In The Sun’ (UK no. 8), the next Sex Pistols single. “I don’t wanna holiday in the sun / I wanna go to the new Belsen,” it begins. Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp during World War Two. In 1977 Germany was still divided by the Berlin Wall into communist East Germany and the German Democratic Republic in the west. The wall is demolished in 1990 and the country unified as a democracy. However in 1977, Johnny Rotten was singing, “Well, I was waiting for the communist call / I didn’t ask for sunshine / And I got World War Three / I’m looking over the wall and they’re looking at me!” In a harrowing crescendo, Rotten babbles about going over or under the Berlin Wall and repeatedly cries, “I don’t understand this bit at all!!” Steve Jones concludes that this berserk, foaming-at-the-mouth rant “pretty well sums up the trip.”\n\nThe Sex Pistols’ debut album, ‘Never Mind The Bollocks, Here’s The Sex Pistols’ (1977) (UK no. 1, US no. 106), arrives in October. ‘Bollocks’ is an English slang term for testicles. However, it is also used colloquially in a variety of ways. One of these is to describe something as rubbish (e.g. ‘That’s total bollocks”). The album title uses the same context, urging listeners to discard imitations and punk wannabes in favour of the real thing – The Sex Pistols. The album cover is in eye-gouging fluoro colours with the group’s name formed from a stencil of ill-matched letters like a terrorist threat pasted together from letters cut out of newspapers. “If the sessions had gone the way I wanted, it would have been unlistenable for most people,” says Johnny Rotten. “I guess it’s the nature of music: if you want people to listen, you’re going to have to compromise.” Chris Thomas and Bill Price produce this actually very uncompromising disc. It includes ‘Anarchy In The U.K.’, ‘God Save The Queen’, ‘Pretty Vacant’ and ‘Holidays In The Sun’. Rotten gibbers, sneers, howls and rants all over a blasted sonic landscape of rubble and ruin, demolished by a band whose instruments have been set for maximum destruction. Aside from the stunning singles, the album has many other dark delights. ‘Bodies’ is an astonishing anti-abortion assault. “She was an animal / She was a f***ing disgrace,” is how Rotten describes “a girl from Birmingham / She just had an abortion.” He works himself into a lather, screaming, “F*** this and f*** that / F*** it all and f*** a f***ing brat!” Who is the subject of the niggling and nervy ‘Liar’? “John announced this as being about [former U.K. Prime Minister] Harold Wilson,” reports Glen Matlock. “I was pretty relieved as I thought he was having a poke at me.” Rotten contradicts this, saying that ‘Liar’ is “self-explanatory really…considering the manager [Malcolm McLaren] we were working with.” ‘Seventeen’ is a punk era teen anthem with its “I’m a lazy sod” chorus. “That was around the time Steve Jones was learning to read and write…everything was misspelled,” comments Rotten. He continues, “It was about being young [and] having nothing to do.” The album closes with the legend-building exercise ‘EMI (Unlimited Edition)’, a tart rejoinder to their former record company. Somehow, what should sound petty instead turns grandiose. “The material is glorious. It’s one of my fave of the lot,” insists Rotten. The song (and the album) ends with the words, “Hello EMI / Goodbye!…A & M.” and then a raspberry is blown. This is ‘one of the classic rock records’ and The Sex Pistols’ peak.\n\nThe next stop for The Sex Pistols is a tour of the United States. When they first apply for visas in December 1977 they are rejected. Johnny Rotten is denied entry because of an indictment for possession of one illegal amphetamine; Steve Jones is taken to task because of lack of information about his criminal record; and Sid Vicious and Paul Cook are both accused of ‘moral turpitude.’\n\nAfter smoothing things over with the authorities, The Sex Pistols U.S. tour opens in Atlanta, Georgia on 5 January 1978 and closes in San Francisco, California, on 18 January 1978. Perversely, the band avoids cities like New York and Los Angeles where there are greater concentrations of punk rock fans in favour of southern and Midwestern cities. Sid Vicious is involved with Nancy Spungen, ‘a Philadelphia runaway turned groupie.’ The two are using heroin and ‘everybody but Sid finds her totally objectionable.’ Johnny Rotten observes that, “I could take on England but I couldn’t take on one heroin user.” Relations within the band are poor.\n\nOn 18 January 1978, during The Sex Pistols show in San Francisco, Johnny Rotten despairs aloud, “Oh bollocks, why should I carry on?” He laughs, “Ha ha ha. Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated?” and quits The Sex Pistols the next day. He tells the press that, “We had gone as far as we could go. Everyone was trying to turn us into a big group, and I hated that.” Rotten sagely comments, “The day The Sex Pistols ceased to exist was the day they became important and relevant.” In other words, their legend has a greater cultural impact than their physical existence. In many ways, The Sex Pistols finish on 18 January 1978 with Johnny Rotten’s departure…except that, zombie-like, they stagger on for some time.\n\nOn 19 January 1978 (the same date Johnny Rotten announces his exit), as the band prepares to leave America, there is an emergency involving Sid Vicious. He is removed from the plane at Kennedy Airport in New York. Taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital, Sid is treated for an overdose of barbiturates and alcohol. “John’s just jealous because I’m the brains of the group,” he boasts in a swipe at Johnny Rotten.\n\nWhile Sid Vicious is in hospital, Malcolm McLaren sends Steve Jones and Paul Cook to Rio De Janiero to meet with Ronnie Biggs. A fugitive from British justice, Biggs committed the so-called Great Train Robbery in 1963. Together with The Sex Pistols, he records vocals for two songs, ‘No One Is Innocent’ and ‘Belsen Was A Gas’.\n\nOn 22 February 1978 Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen are arrested by the police in a room at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. The couple are charged with drug possession. “I don’t want to be a junkie for the rest of my life,” says Sid. “I don’t want to be a junkie at all.”\n\nIn 1978 The Sex Pistols release the single ‘No One Is Innocent’ backed with ‘My Way’ (UK no. 7). The latter is a cover version of the song made famous by Frank Sinatra in 1969. Sid Vicious provides the oddball lead vocal, but can’t remember all the lyrics so he makes up some lines. Paul Cook does not play drums on ‘My Way’, but Steve Jones tries to make it work anyway.\n\nThe next Sex Pistols single for 1978 is ‘Somethin’ Else’ b/w ‘Friggin’ In The Riggin’’ (UK no. 3). Sid Vicious sings the former, a cover version of the 1959 song by rockabilly singer Eddie Cochran. Steve Jones sings ‘Friggin’ In The Riggin’’.\n\nOn 13 October 1978 Nancy Spungen is found dead in the Chelsea Hotel room she shares with Sid Vicious. The death is due to abdominal knife wounds. Sid Vicious is arrested for her murder. He is ‘nearly unconscious due to the effects of several different drugs, including heroin, barbiturates and alcohol.’ Sid confesses to the murder but, according to his statement, it appears Nancy Spungen encouraged him to kill her.\n\n‘Silly Thing’ (UK no. 6) is the last Sex Pistols single for 1978. Paul Cook: “’Silly Thing’ was a thing Steve [Jones] and I put together. It was originally called ‘Silly C***’. It was about Sid [Vicious] or it could have been about Malcolm [McLaren].” Steve Jones’ literary skills have improved to the point where he writes the lyrics for this song – which is better than it has any right to be. ‘Silly Thing’ is the best work from the post-Johnny Rotten Sex Pistols.\n\nSid Vicious attempts suicide on 22 October 1978 at New York’s Bellevue Hospital. He uses a smashed light bulb to slash his wrists. He survives.\n\nReleased on bail, on 6 December 1978 Sid Vicious is involved in an altercation at Hurrah, a New York nightclub. He smashes glass in the face of Todd Smith, the brother of American punk singer, Patti Smith.\n\nThe trial of Sid Vicious for the murder of Nancy Spungen begins on 2 January 1979.\n\nOn 2 February 1979 Sid Vicious is found dead of a heroin overdose in the Greenwich Village apartment of his new girlfriend, Michelle Robinson. The death is ruled accidental. Apparently, Sid Vicious had detoxified himself to the point where a shot of heroin was too much for him and proved fatal. Some contend the overdose was deliberate. The murder case against Sid Vicious is left unresolved. He was 21. In 1996, Sid’s mother, Anne Beverley, commits suicide.\n\n‘The Great Rock ‘N’ Roll Swindle’ (1979) (UK no. 7) is released on 24 February. This is the soundtrack to the film of the same name, ‘a series of “lessons” in rock subversion by Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren.’ The movie is directed by Julien Temple. As well as the Johnny Rotten era hits, the album includes all the 1978 singles and their final singles from 1979 and 1980: (i) ‘C’mon Everybody’ (UK no. 3), another Eddie Cochran cover sung by Sid Vicious; (ii) ‘The Great Rock ‘N’ Roll Swindle’ (UK no. 21) with guest vocals by Edward Tudor-Pole a.k.a. Ten Pole Tudor; and (iii) 1980’s ‘(I’m Not Your) Steppin’ Stone’ (UK no. 21), a previously unreleased Johnny Rotten led version of The Monkees’ 1966 pop hit.\n\nOn 26 February 1979 a London court hears a case in which Malcolm McLaren and the surviving Sex Pistols argue over the division of the band’s money. Although they earned eight hundred thousand pounds, only thirty thousand is left.\n\n‘Some Product: Carri On Sex Pistols’ (1979) (UK no. 6) in August is a collection of spoken word interviews and radio spots. ‘Flogging A Dead Horse’ (1980) (UK no. 23) in February is a greatest hits set. It comprises the A sides of the four 1977 singles, the B sides of three of those singles, the six A sides from 1978 to 1980, plus ‘My Way’.\n\nJohnny Rotten reverts to his birth name of John Lydon and leads Public Image Limited (or P.I.L.) which is ‘not a group, but a wide-ranging corporation.’ He marries Nora Foster, a publishing heiress from Germany. This also makes him the step-father of Ari Up from the female punk trio, The Slits.\n\nGlen Matlock works with The Rich Kids (September 1977 to November 1978), then Spectre.\n\nPaul Cook marries, and he and his wife, Jenni, have a daughter named Hollie.\n\nThe Sex Pistols – Johnny Rotten, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook – reunite in 1996 for the ‘Filthy Lucre’ international tour. The group reconvenes again in 2007-2008.\n\nDespite a BBC ban, The Sex Pistols’ ‘God Save The Queen’ topped the U.K. singles chart on 18 June 1977. Such an achievement indicates the depth and loyalty of The Sex Pistols’ fanbase. How did they win them over? Malcolm McLaren grasped the concept that alienating the parents wins the devotion of their rebellious kids. The same principle partially accounts for the success of Elvis Presley in the 1950s and The Rolling Stones in the 1960s. “They can control The Stones, they can’t control us,” boasted Paul Cook in 1977. Unlike their predecessors, The Sex Pistols were not celebrating rock ‘n’ roll as a new hope; they were ‘wreckers.’ “Rock ‘n’ roll is over, don’t you understand?” asked Johnny Rotten in February 1980. “It’s gone on for twenty-five years and it’s got to be cancelled. The Pistols finished rock ‘n’ roll; they were the last rock ‘n’ roll band.” Perhaps they should have called a halt after Rotten’s departure in January 1978. Paul Cook noted that, “A lot of stuff came out under The Sex Pistols’ name after John left because Malcolm was trying to get the film [‘The Great Rock ‘N’ Roll Swindle’] together. He was desperate and Virgin [Records] was giving him money to finish it. Using the name Sex Pistols was the only way to raise cash.” In that phase, The Sex Pistols were acting just as would the old school rock ‘dinosaurs’ they had railed against. It’s hard to fault the reunions from the 1990s onwards that helped give the members of the band some financial support, but – again – it seems contrary to the reckless spirit of 1977. What made The Sex Pistols significant was not what made them the same as other acts, but what set them apart: a brave attempt to draw a line under rock ‘n’ roll and say, ‘it ends here.’ The Sex Pistols’ ‘total effect was to make rock ‘n’ roll dangerous again, to restore its unpredictability.’ ‘They changed the face of popular music through their raw, nihilistic singles and violent performances.’\n\nSources:\n\n‘Rolling Stone Rock Almanac’ by the Editors of ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine (Papermac, 1984) p. 248, 254, 261, 263, 266, 267, 268, 270, 271, 272, 275, 277, 280, 281, 289, 291, 294, 295\n\n‘The Rolling Stone Illustrated History Of Rock ‘N’ Roll’, ‘Anarchy in the U.K.’ by Greil Marcus (Plexus Publishing, 1992), p. 594, 596, 597, 598, 599, 601, 605, 606, 607\n\nNotable names database – nndb.com – as at 6 December 2013\n\nInternet movie database imdb.com as at 6 March 2014\n\n‘Late Late Show’ (U.S. television program, CBS Network) – Johnny Rotten and Steve Jones interview conducted by Craig Ferguson (3 November 2007)\n\n‘Rock Stars’ by Timothy White (Columbus Books, 1984) p. 214, 218, 219\n\nbrainyquote.com as at 7 March 2014\n\n‘The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time’ – ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine (February 2004) p. 42, 68\n\nwikipedia.org as at 6 December 2013\n\nallmusic.com, ‘The Sex Pistols’ by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as at 2 April 2002\n\n‘Friday On My Mind’ by Ed Nimmervoll (Five Mile Press, 2004) p. 110, 111, 112, 116\n\n‘The Illustrated Rock Handbook’ edited by Roxanne Streeter, Ray Bonds (Salamander Books, 1983) p. 9, 46, 108, 175, 191, 257\n\n‘Kiss This’ – Sleeve notes by Johnny Rotten, Steve Jones, Glen Matlock and Paul Cook (Virgin Records Ltd., 1992) p. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16\n\n‘The Illustrated New Musical Express Encyclopedia of Rock’ by Nick Logan, Bob Woffinden (Salamander Books, 1978) p. 56, 208\n\n‘The Today Show’ (U.K. television program, ITV Network) – Sex Pistols interview conducted by Bill Grundy (1 December 1976)\n\n‘The History of Rock’ by Mark Paytress (Parragon Books, 2011) p.187\n\nwatchmojo.com – ‘History of the Sex Pistols’ (15 January 2013)\n\nazlyrics.com as at 5 March 2014\n\n1977 interview with The Sex Pistols in Denmark Street, London (Australian interview, ABC Network?)\n\nSong lyrics copyright Stephen Philip Jones / Warner Chappell Music Ltd / Rotten Music Ltd.\n\nLast revised 25 March 2014\n\nRoxy Music\n\nBryan Ferry – circa 1987\n\n“You’re dressed to kill and guess who’s dying?” – ‘Dance Away’ (Bryan Ferry)\n\n“I do have a vast wardrobe,” acknowledges Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music. “But it’s certainly not on the Elton John scale,” he adds in reference to the flamboyant British pop star. Nonetheless, Ferry’s rather more distinguished sartorial splendour is part of Roxy Music’s image. His look is akin to a lounge lizard from the 1930s, or perhaps an exiled Count from some tiny middle European principality. Roxy Music comes to prominence in England in the early 1970s as part of the glam rock movement. In this case, ‘glam’ is short for ‘glamour’ and Roxy Music – particularly Ferry – live that part to the hilt. The style is not so much about ensuring one’s jacket has the correct number of buttons as it is an artistic creation in its own right. “Right from the beginning, Roxy Music were about presenting music in a visually attractive way,” points out guitarist Phil Manzanera.\n\nBryan Ferry is born 26 September 1945 in Washington, Tyne and Wear, County Durham, in north-east England. He is the son of Frederick Charles Ferry and Mary Ann Armstrong. Fred Ferry is a coal-miner. “I do have memories of deprivation,” says Bryan Ferry, “but I don’t carry them around like some bitter, left-wing hammer to beat people on the head with.” The singer muses, “You know, we were poor, and I thought we were poor, but in many ways my life was easy. My education was funded by the State, I went to a really nice Northern grammar school, and then I went to university on a full grant.” Ferry refers to the University of Newcastle where he studies art. “At school I was on my own, studying art. I felt I was in my own little world.” One of his teachers is Richard Hamilton, the nearest thing the U.K. has to U.S. pop art icon Andy Warhol. Looking at Hamilton’s collages of images from pop culture, young Ferry thinks, “I’ll try and do something like that in music with all the things that are important to me.”\n\nBryan Ferry is as interested in music as he is in art. “I was torn between the two,” he advises. However, not every kind of popular music connects with Ferry. “Folk music…it was not my thing. I was very much into Otis Redding, soul music, Stax, Motown…” Ferry begins his singing career before he goes to university. “Someone asked me to sing in a band. It was called The Banshees. We played working men’s clubs. When I got to university I started my own band called The Gas Board.”\n\nAfter graduating university, Bryan Ferry is employed as a teacher. “I got a year’s travelling scholarship from Royal College of Art, London. Instead, I stayed in London and wrote songs,” he reports. The conflict in his mind between art and music is also resolved: “When I started writing songs, I stopped painting completely.”\n\nIn 1970 Bryan Ferry seeks out an old college friend, bass player Graham Simpson (13 October 1943 – 16 April 2012), with the intent of starting a band. Ferry intends to call the group Roxy, after the Roxy Theatre. However, upon learning there is already an American group called Roxy, Ferry modifies the name of his outfit to Roxy Music. So it is that in November 1970 Roxy Music is founded…with only Bryan Ferry and Graham Simpson. A trade advertisement for musicians leads them to Andy Mackay in January 1971.\n\nAndy Mackay (the latter part of the surname rhymes with high, not hay) is born 23 July 1946 in Lost Withiel, Cornwall, England. He grows up in Pimlico in central London. Andy Mackay plays saxophone and oboe and studies avant-garde music. He attends Reading University. “Bryan [Ferry] tells me we met at Reading…but [I only] vaguely remember,” admits Andy Mackay. “I was introduced [properly] to [Ferry] in 1971, by which time he’d already started trying to put his band together. And then, of course, I introduced Brian Eno to that situation.”\n\nBrian Peter George St John Le Baptiste De La Salle Eno is born 15 May 1948 in Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. He is the son of a postman, William Eno, and his wife, Maria. Brian has a sister, Rita, and a brother, Roger. Like Bryan Ferry, Brian Eno is also an art student. After attending Ipswich Art School, he goes on to Winchester College of Art (1966 – 1969). “I started performing music at art school but it was the kind of music that happened in mid-1960s art schools – not necessarily pop music, but experimental music,” notes Eno. Along the way, Brian Eno marries Sarah Grenville in 1967 (though they will later divorce) and they have a daughter, Hannah (born 1967). Brian Eno meets Andy Mackay when the two young men catch the same tube train.\n\nBy this time, Bryan Ferry and Graham Simpson have found some other musicians. Andy Mackay brings Brian Eno along to a rehearsal, not to join the band, but to make use of his technical knowledge to assemble a demo tape. “I went along with one of my [tape] recorders,” recounts Eno, “and there was a synthesiser [belonging to Andy Mackay] there that no one was playing…Andy said, y’know, ‘Have a go at it if you like’…”\n\nSo it is that in 1971 Roxy Music is constituted with this line-up: Bryan Ferry (vocals, some keyboards), Roger Bunn (guitar), Brian Eno (synthesisers), Andy Mackay (saxophone, oboe), Graham Simpson (bass) and Dexter Lloyd (drums). This version of the band exists until June 1971.\n\nRoger Bunn quits Roxy Music in June 1971, becoming a freelance session musician instead. His replacement on guitar is David O’List (born 13 December 1948). The newcomer played in the first version of The Nice (circa 1967), before being squeezed out by that act’s flamboyant keyboardist, Keith Emerson. Phil Manzanera also applied for the vacant slot in Roxy Music, but lost out to David O’List. Manzanera settles for acting as the sound-mixer for Roxy Music. However, in February 1972, David O’List and Dexter Lloyd quit Roxy Music.\n\n“I put an ad in [U.K. music newspaper] ‘Melody Maker’,” explains Bryan Ferry. “We interviewed a few people. One of them was Paul Thompson who walked in fresh from the building site.” Paul Thompson (born 13 May 1951), cheerfully acknowledges, “I did feel a bit out of place – intellectually.” Ironically, as a child, Thompson showed some artistic ability, but gave up on such things due to peer pressure. Now he finds himself amongst a self-consciously arty crew of musicians."
