        "text": "One song into this curious concert, a blustery gentleman stood up in the front rows and loudly demanded: “Can you introduce the people on stage properly and explain what’s going on for those of us who don’t know?” There was a rumble of bemused laughter in the usually polite environs of the intimate Cadogan Hall, whereupon band leader Teddy Thompson mumbled apologetically “I was just about to get to that.”\n\nTo be fair to the baffled if boorish heckler, this concert did have a complicated back story, which I will try to summarise more succinctly than Teddy managed stumbling over unscripted remarks about his “mum” whilst tuning his guitar.\n\nLinda Thompson is a 76-year-old singer and songwriter, who rose to acclaim in the 1970s as wife and duet partner of guitarist Richard Thompson (to whom she was married for 10 years). Linda’s subsequent solo career was derailed by spasmodic dysphonia, a degenerative vocal condition.\n\nIn recent years she has lost all confidence in her singing but continued to write songs, resulting in a delightful new album featuring family and friends singing on her behalf. Wittily entitled Proxy Music, it was produced by her musician son Teddy, who fronted a band including Linda’s singer-songwriter daughter Kami and guitarist grandson Zak at a one-off performance dedicated to Linda’s music, in which Linda herself was nowhere to be seen.\n\nWell, when I say nowhere – she was quietly ensconced a few seats away from me, with a baseball cap pulled low, mouthing lyrics with giddy delight. But though her name was top of the bill, she didn’t appear onstage until the final encore, when she had to be reluctantly dragged out by her daughter.\n\nThe whole thing had the air of an impromptu family shindig rather than a slickly presented show. The hugely talented band were under-rehearsed, watching each other closely for cues. Guest singers leafed through sheets of lyrics, leaving discarded pages scattered over the stage, whilst Teddy searched for a tuner and the soundman struggled with feedback. “It’s folk music,” as Kami pointed out to her brother. “No one cares if you’re in tune.”\n\nHonestly, you can get away with being shambolic when you have talent of this pedigree. It was a set of beautifully honed songs, played by fantastic musicians, sung by glorious vocalists of character and passion. Highlights included Eliza Carthy’s furious fiddle playing, John Grant’s emotionally complex delivery of a song called John Grant, Romeo Stodart and Ren Harvieu’s duet of Lonely Hearts and Martin Simpson’s incredible guitar picking on Strange Affair.\n\nAdding layers of family irony, the latter were both written by ex-husband Richard, as indeed were many of the most striking songs of the evening, including an epic version of The Great Valerio sung beautifully by Teddy. “I wonder where he got that voice from?” Martin Simpson speculated cheekily. It all concluded with Kami sounding spookily like her mother on I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, whilst Teddy sang their father’s harmony parts, Zak pealed off a scintillating replica of his grandfather’s lead solo and Linda herself waltzed silently in the background with her baseball hat pulled low. Talented family. Strange affair.\n\nNo further performances"
