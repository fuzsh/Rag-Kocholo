        "text": "True Yarns: songs inspired on real events and people Volume 14\n\nThe Go-Go Train [Mike Stevens & The Shevelles] The Shevelles started off in Cardiff in Wales in the mid 1960’s. Their roots go back to 1962 when Brian Davies teamed up with Tony Sheveton and Dave Edmunds to form The Raiders. Tony departed to go solo and Edmunds would later emerge in the early 1970’s as a solo act. Released in 1967, this song celebrates the British Blues/R&B world by assigning various railroad jobs to the current movers and shakers such as Rod Stewart, Long John Baldry and Eric Burden.\n\nRobert Lowell and Sylvia Plath [Aimee Mann] I venture that this song is an imagined walk in the garden of Boston’s famous McLean (mental) Hospital of two of America’s great modern poets. Lowell was regarded as America’s foremost poet in the 1950s and in the latter part of that decade taught Sylvia Plath at Boston University. For her part, Plath is arguably the most famous female American poet. Other than poetry, the two shared struggles with depression and mental illness and both were at different times admitted to McLean Hospital. The institution had a rather ironic reputation which is explained in this article which focuses on both poets’ experiences in it.\n\nRobert Lowell\n\nAnd Sylvia Plath\n\nPaint and plaster, stripped down\n\nTo the lath\n\nOne now broken\n\nOne now dust\n\nVictim of a\n\nMental wanderlust\n\nIn this podcast Mann explains how her own obsessive thoughts can be so powerful and overwhelming, that her depression is almost a response to keep the intensity of her thoughts in check — like a “lid” that keeps her anxiety in check. She also discusses how just as mental illness is devastating when we experience it ourselves, it is also crushing when someone close to us struggles with their own issues. She also released an album titled Mental Illness in 2017.\n\nDo Ya Think I’m Sexy? [Rod Stewart] Thanks to a C90 Lounge regular I have been alerted to the backstory of this 1978 disco romper by Sir Rod, which relates to the Ben Jorge song Taj Mahal which I shared in a recent volume (12) of True Yarns. Hilarious! Thanks CrabDevil.\n\nLong Walk to D.C. [The Staple Singers] On 28 August 1963, more than 200,000 demonstrators took part in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in the nation’s capital. The march was successful in pressuring the administration of John F. Kennedy to initiate a strong federal civil rights bill in Congress. During this event, Martin Luther King delivered his memorable “I Have a Dream” speech.\n\nMidnight Special [Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder] One of America’s great train songs. And one of America’s great prison songs. Midnight Special has a long and much argued-over history but most attribute the basic song we all know these days to the folk/blues singer Leadbelly. The train that provided the title got its name because it departed Jackson, Mississippi at 12:05 a.m. on Sunday mornings, arriving at Parchman Prison, 130 miles to the north, at dawn. The prison, also known as Parchman Farm (or more formally, Mississippi State Prison), was on thousands of acres of land, where the inmates did hard labor. While they worked, they would sometimes sing about the Midnight Special, which brought visits from friends and family, so for conjugal visits, the first of their kind.\n\nThe Night Before May Day [Lisa Knapp] “Bringing in the May” meant going out into the woods and fields on May Eve, the night before May Day (May 1), to gather flowers and greenery for decorations and also to enjoy the many amorous possibilities of an unchaperoned night in the woods. This is a song by English folk/pop artist Lisa Knapp about the traditional English spring festival of May Day which involved dancing around a ‘May pole’. As much as it was loved it was not always allowed by the government of the day which this article explains.\n\nBugeilo’r Gwenith Gwyn [Bryn Terfel] a Welsh folk song which in English means, Watching the White Wheat. It describes the tragic love affair between Wil Hopcyn and Ann Thomas (The Maid of Cefn Ydfa) from the village of Llangynwyd in Glamorganshire. Ann belonged to a wealthy farming family but Wil was only a farm labourer. Ann’s mother rejected Wil and forced Ann into a marriage with Anthony Maddocks, the son of a local squire. A few days before the marriage took place Wil left Llangynwyd. Months later Wil had a dream in which Ann’s new husband had died, so he returned home. However, when he arrived he discovered that in fact it was Ann who was dying, from a broken heart. Ann died in his arms that day. Maddocks inherited the Thomas’ estate and soon re-married. Wil died in 1741, never having married. Both he and Ann are buried at Llangynwyd.\n\nThe “Fish” Cheer / I-Feel-Like-I’m-Fixin’-To-Die Rag [Country Joe & The Fish] Pretty much self-explanatory. Live from the granddaddy of all festivals, Woodstock.\n\nThe Ballad of the Fallen [Charlie Haden & Carla Bley] Another folk song, this time from El Savador, location of a long cold war proxy battle in the 1980s. In 1980, El Salvador’s civil war officially began. The government-supported military targeted anyone they suspected of supporting social and economic reform. Often the victims were unionists, clergy, independent farmers and university officials. Over the ensuing twelve years, thousands of victims perished. Some of the most notable were Archbishop Oscar Romero (shot to death 1980), four US church workers (raped and murdered 1980) and six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter (shot to death at home 1989).\n\nThe lyrics which inspired this tune were found on the body of a student massacred by the national guard. The song gives the title to Haden and Bley’s gorgeous album of 1983.\n\nSEX/WORK (Clarence/Anita) [Don Byron] A jazz meditation on the first time most Americans heard the name Clarence Thomas. The conservative Supreme Court Justice has been a divisive figure for all his public life. These days he’s in a spot of hot water thanks to his wife’s outing as a die-hard MAGA-ster and supporter of the January 2021 coup. It’s worthwhile to remind ourselves of this case as all the principals are still with us with two of them (the men) having progressed to very top rungs of their profession. But has anything really changed?\n\nToo Hip 4ZZZ [Fox n Firkin] A punk Celtic put down of Brisbane’s (Australia)mainstream rock radio station 4ZZZ. No doubt these sentiments are echoed throughout the world by music lovers who can’t stand the ‘shit’ they hear coming over the airwaves.\n\nThe Shrine of St. Cecilia [Gus Clark] I could not for the life of me understand why so many musicians have covered this Andrews Sisters song from 1958. Until I did a bit of research and discovered St. Cecilia is regarded as the ‘patron saint of musicians’. The first record of a music festival in her honour was held at Évreux in Normandy in 1570. The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world. It was founded by the papal bull, Ratione congruit, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, after whom Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music.\n\nThe Invaders [Ray Davies] American popular music experienced a seismic shift in 1964. That year, British bands launched what became commonly known as an “invasion” of the American pop charts and culture. Led by The Beatles, other British bands and artists such as the Rolling Stones, Donovan, the Dave Clark Five, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, the Searchers, the Animals and many more completely and dramatically affected the course of rock & roll in America. At no other time in the 20th century had American popular music been so jolted by foreign sounds and influences. One of the veterans of that musical military assault is Ray Davies, formerly a Kink, who reflects back on those days.\n\nThey called us “The Invaders”\n\nSo we came from another world\n\nAnd the man from immigration\n\nShouted out “hey punk, you a boy or a girl?”\n\n“Hey tutti-frutti give us a kiss”\n\nThe custom man proclaimed\n\n‘Cause the world as you knew it turned upside down\n\nAnd things would never be the same\n\nThe day The Invaders came\n\n1952 Vincent Black Lightning [Richard Thompson] There’s no denying the power of the black-and-white image—a man clad in swim trunks and sneakers lying at across a speeding motorcycle, his head down and his feet dangling far past the back wheel. (See the cover of this volume of True Yarns). The man was Rollie Free, and the 1948 picture shows him setting the American motorcycle land-speed record of 150 mph (it has since been broken many times, including by Free himself two years later). There is arguing about the bike, however. Some say it’s a Vincent Black Shadow; others claim it’s a Vincent Black Lightning.\n\nBilly’s Bones [The Pogues] Many smaller countries regularly second their soldiers and police to the United Nations to man ‘peacekeeping’ operations in hot spots and war zones all around the world. Pakistan, Nepal, Fiji, Malaysia and Indonesia are some of the most enthusiastic participants. So is Ireland, and this song tells a story of an imaginary young man, Billy, who goes off to the UN Mission in Lebanon but who doesn’t come back.\n\nBilly saw the Arabs and he had ’em on the run\n\nWhen he got ’em in the range of his sub-machine gun\n\nThen he had the Israelis in his sights\n\nWent a ra ta ta and they ran like Shiites\n\nTaj Mahal [Cricket Smith & The Symphonians] Clearly this Indian love tomb is a huge inspiration for musicians across the ages and genres. Rod Steward disco, Ben Jorge bossa nova-funk and now hot jazz. Bombay, where this record was made, was a major stop on the hot jazz global tour of the 1930s and 40s. The Taj Mahal Hotel was the most prominent (but by no means, only) jazz venue in the city. Or the country. Jazz was the musical currency of the time and every mid-size city (and even small backwater podunks) had a club or hotel where Filipino, European and especially African American jazz musicians entertained the British expatriates and wealthy Indians. Trumpeter Cricket Smith and pianist extraordinaire Teddy Weatherford were probably the two most prominent. The latter was a HUGE star in 1940s India where he settled and ultimately died of cholera in Calcutta. Weatherford was a big name before he arrived in India. Smith recruited him from his long standing and highly lucrative gig in Shanghai to join his new band The Symphonians who acted as a house band at the Taj Mahal Hotel. This song’s lyrics were composed by a Bombay Jew, Mena Silas.\n\nTaj Mahal Taj Mahal\n\nIndia’s mystic pride\n\nTaj Mahal Taj Mahal\n\nBuilt to love divine\n\nTaj Mahal you fill us with amazement\n\nWe all stare with amazement at you\n\nJohnson Machine Gun [Sunnyland Slim] Sunnyland is pissed off and on a mission.\n\nI’m gonna buy me a Johnson machine gun\n\nand a carload of explosion balls\n\nBabe, I’m gonna buy me a machine gun,\n\nand a carload of explosion balls\n\nYes, I’m going to be a walking cyclone,\n\nfrom Sagino’ to the Niaga’ Falls\n\nGo and bring me typewriter\n\nand a whole round belt of balls\n\nGo and bring me typewriter\n\nand a whole round belt of balls\n\nI’m gonna free my no good woman,\n\nboy she’s down at state penitentiary\n\nBarry G [Toyan] Barrington ‘Barry’ Gordon is one of Jamaica’s longest serving and influential DJs and music broadcasters. A few years ago his death was widely reported and mourned. Until the man himself showed up on a video refuting the rumor!\n\nMemphis Flu [Elder Curry & Congregation] In 1929 people in Memphis are dying from influenza. Doctors say they will have the flu under control in a few days, but God shows his power by sending the doctors and nurses to sickbeds too. This is a recording of a local African American minister and his congregation singing about this dire situation.\n\nIt was God’s mighty hand/He is judging this old land…\n\nYes, He killed the rich and poor/And he’s going to kill more/\n\nIf you don’t turn away from your shame\n\nLizzie Borden [The Chad Mitchell Trio]\n\nElizabeth Borden took an ax/and gave her mother forty whacks/\n\nand when the job was nicely done/ she gave her father forty one\n\nSo does the singing trio named after Chad Mitchell introduce the gruesome murder spree of Lizzie Borden. Part of the puzzle of why we still remember Lizzie’s crime lies in Fall River, Massachusetts, a textile mill town 50 miles south of Boston. Fall River was rocked not only by the sheer brutality of the crime, but also by who its victims were. Cultural, religious, class, ethnic, and gender divisions in the town would shape debates over Lizzie’s guilt or innocence—and draw the whole country into the case.\n\nThe Ballad of Thunder Road [Robert Mitchum] The lead song to the movie of the same name, written by and starring the singer/actor, Thunder Road refers to a well-established moonshiner’s track. The locations heard in the song actually describe real places in east Tennessee and Kentucky. The “Thunder Road” route runs south from Harlan, KY, thru The Cumberland Gap to Maynardville, TN, just north of Knoxville. The moonshine runner then goes through downtown Knoxville and onto Kingston Pike where he crashes on Bearden Hill (Bearden is a Knoxville suburb). The route is easily followed on a map.\n\nParchman Farm [Mose Allison] Early in his recording career in 1937,Bukka White, the author of another song with the same name, was arrested and convicted for a shooting incident and was sentenced to Parchman Farm prison in rural Sunflower County, Mississippi. The institution was operated as a hard-time prison labor work farm, which was notorious for its harsh conditions and use of the trusty system. A notorious institution has inspired several songs, including this one by Mississippi native, Mose Allison. It was also the Prison/Farm which inspired the aforementioned song, Midnight Special.\n\nWell I’m sittin’ over here on Number Nine\n\nAnd all I did was drink my wine\n\nWell I’m gonna be here for the rest of my life\n\nI’m gonna be on this farm for my natural life\n\nWell I’m a gonna be here for the rest of my life\n\nAnd all I did was shoot my wife\n\nBad Man [Loudon Wainwright III]. The United States sees itself as peace loving and the champion of freedom. In reality American leaders belong to the cult of warfare. I recently watched the documentary on Jimmy Carter and Rock ‘n’ Roll which confirmed my love and admiration for him. Especially, his summation of his own single term in office: it was the only presidency that did not shoot a missile or drop a bomb or kill anyone.\n\nHere’s what Loudon Wainwright III thinks about this topic.\n\nHey everybody, we’re havin’ a war\n\nBigger and better than the one before\n\nRemember that Panamanian strong man\n\nYeah, we took him to Miami and we locked him in the can\n\nIn Panama City they’re livin’ in tents\n\nWar is hell and it don’t make sense\n\nStill some folks can’t understand\n\nWhy we kill a good people just to get a bad man\n\nIndependence Cha Cha [Grand Kalle] When one considers the full sweep of European Imperialism/Colonialism it’s hard not to conclude that every Imperial power has blood on it hands. [To take just a single metric.] And within this Hall of Infamy the Belgian colony of Congo (nee Zaire now Democratic Republic of Congo) is probably the place where the most horrific version of white supremacy haunted the people. Set up as King Leopold’s personal estate, the Congo Free State, was larger than Germany, France, Spain, UK, Portugal, Netherlands and Belgium and the site of gross crimes against humanity. When the horrors could no longer be ignored the Belgian government took possession of the territory off the King’s hands and retained tight control until Independence in 1960.\n\nIn 1959 the Belgian government decided to host a Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels to discuss the political future of the Belgian Congo. One of the Congolese delegates to the conference was politician Daniel Kanza. Two of his sons, Thomas and Philippe, decided they should invite a group of Congolese musicians to the conference under the leadership of Joseph Kabasele [Grand Kalle] so as to keep the delegates entertained. In late 1959 Thomas formally extended an invitation to Kabasele, who led the band African Jazz, and Victor Longomba, bandleader of OK Jazz. Grand Kalle participated in the transfer of power discussions himself and when they were concluded the group performed this upbeat, hopeful tune that expressed the aspirations for freedom of one of the most oppressed colonial peoples in the world.\n\nStreets of Tamworth [Roger Knox] Tamworth in New South Wales, is Australia’s answer to Nashville. The home of country music Down Under. Every year an huge annual country music festival is held here and the luckiest of all winners is gifted the Golden Guitar.\n\nThis song by Aboriginal singer Roger Knox extols the virtues of a quiet country home and traditional life (where the white man’s ways won’t bother me no more) as opposed to the harsh realities of city life in the town.\n\nDon’t Bet Money on the Shanghai [BR5-49] A not so well known Stephen Foster song discussed here.The topic of the song is cockfighting. Pitting fighting roosters against one another has an ancient history, and is still very popular in countries such as Mexico, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Cockfighting is now outlawed in every state in America; Louisiana, in 2007, was the last to abolish the sport. But, in the 19th century it was a very popular form of sporting entertainment. Like horse racing, another favorite sport of the South, cockfighting offered the opportunity to gamble. Small fortunes were won and lost on the ability of one rooster to spur and peck to death another.\n\nTobacco Road [Lou Rawls]. Basically ,an American standard now, this song has been recorded by countless artists. Lou Rawls is my fave. The songwriter, John D. Loudermilk states,\n\n“I got the idea for writing that song from a road in our town that was called Tobacco Road because it was where they rolled the hogsheads full of Tobacco down to the river to be loaded onto barges. Along that road were a lot of real tough, seedy-type people, and your folks would have just died if they thought you ever went down there”. North Carolina, where Loudermilk is from, has a rich history of tobacco agriculture and cigarette production.\n\nSputnik 57 [Minus 5] On October 4, 1957, the USSR launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. The satellite, an 85-kilogram (187-pound) metal sphere the size of a basketball, was launched on a huge rocket and orbited Earth at 29,000 kilometers per hour (18,000 miles per hour) for three months.\n\nI was born in 57\n\nand somewhere in the heavens\n\na Sputnik started beeping night and day\n\na shiny little ball\n\nthat could never ever fall\n\npassing slowly by the window where I lay\n\nI went out there on the launch pads\n\nup there with the Sputnik\n\nstayed up all night when a man walked on the moon\n\nI was born in the trip\n\nof the rockets very trail\n\nand I saw that brighter future coming soon\n\nwhen the winners of the human race\n\nfloated weightless up in space\n\nabove the poor and the heavy and the doomed\n\njust one small step for man\n\none giant leap from Vietnam\n\nwalking with the men up on the moon\n\nyeah I was up there on the launch pads\n\nup there with the Sputnik\n\nstayed up all night when the men walked on the moon\n\nI was born in the trip\n\nthat rockets find a trail\n\ncause I saw that brighter future coming soon\n\nRoland The Headless Thompson Gunner [Warren Zevon] A timeless, epic tale of a Norwegian mercenary who roams the world’s shit holes looking for a fight with a ‘Thompson Gun for hire’. While Roland is fictional, those who inspired him are very real and still operate in the shadows and flashes of gunfire, explosions and trouble. The Thompson submachine gun, by name Tommy gun, submachine gun patented in 1920 by its American designer, John T. Thompson. It weighed almost 10 pounds (4.5 kg) empty and fired .45-calibre ammunition. The magazine was either a circular drum that held 50 or 100 rounds or a box that held 20 or 30 rounds.\n\nThe word mercenary comes from the Latin merces (wages or pay) and is no different than the solde or pay due to fighters, from which the word “soldier” is derived. For much of the past, mercenaries and soldiers were synonymous. Most of military history is privatized, and mercenaries are as old as war itself. A fascinating article on the historical role of mercenaries around the world.\n\nTrue Yarns: songs inspired by real events and people Volume 13\n\nJulius Caesar [The Golden Gate Quartet] In which the fabulous Golden Gate Quartet reimagine the great Caesar as a swinging singing band leader in Dixieland. The King before Elvis.\n\nHe had a jamboree every Saturday night/ and he was there to see everything was all right\n\nThe Darktown Strutters’ Ball [Alberta Hunter] the song was inspired by an annual ball in Chicago, Illinois, that was “a kind of modern equivalent of the medieval carnivals of misrule, financed by wealthy society folk but with a guest list of pimps and prostitutes.\n\nAlberta Hunter was over 80 years old when she recorded this and the album Amtrak Blues is a must to have in your collection. Hunter began her singing career in a bordello and soon moved to clubs that appealed to men, black and white alike. By 1914 she was receiving lessons from a prominent jazz pianist, Tony Jackson, who helped her to expand her repertoire and compose her own songs. She was still in her early teens when she settled in Chicago. Part of her early career was spent singing at Dago Frank’s, a brothel. She then sang at Hugh Hoskin’s saloon and, eventually, in many Chicago bars.\n\nSpirits, Angels, Or Lies [Riddy Arman] When my oldest brother, with whom I was once very close, passed away, he came to visit me in my sleep on the very night he died. We had a nice chat and when I awoke I felt at peace for the experience and less resentful of the distance that had built up between us. This is a song based on the same sort of experience.\n\nWas a Fall Friday morn’ mid-September /Dad he would die one month later /Mom went to visit in the place he would pass/ across from the river, and in front of the tracks.\n\nHe said, You won’t believe who came to my bedside/ Johnny Cash on a freight train, sometime in the night./He wanted me to go along for a ride. But I told him I’d stay for my children and my wife.\n\nMom turned on the TV and to her surprise/Breaking news this morning, Johnny Cash has died. He passed away in Nashville, sometime in the night.\n\nThe nurses told my mom/don’t be surprised\n\nFunny things happen before someone dies\n\nYou can call it Spirits, Angels, or Lies\n\nAmerican Bandstand [Buddy Guy], American Bandstand was an American music-performance and dance television program that aired in various versions from 1952 to 1989, and was hosted from 1956 until its final season by Dick Clark, who also served as the program’s producer. It involved Top 40 pop artists lip syncing their current hit while white suburban teenagers danced, wiggled and shook.\n\nThis unreleased song by blues guitar legend, Buddy Guy, is from 1960. He was an up and coming blues guitarist/singer trying to make his way in the very heartland of urban electric blues, Chicago. After a short stint at Cobra Records where he was championed by Otis Rush, he eventually landed, thanks to Muddy Waters, at Chess. According to Alan Harper, the author of Waiting for Buddy Guy: Chicago Blues at the Crossroads, “Buddy Guy was not going to be the new Chuck Berry. Nevertheless, he was a good looking kid, and even the Chess Brothers could see that their little country boy could play. They just needed to find him the right material. One bizarre and incongruous attempt to pitch the young bluesman into the white youth market was a song called ‘American Bandstand’. Ironically, it was pretty good. Guy’s vocal were smooth yet admirably committed, the lyrics were blandly on message—it was a song about the popular TV show after all—the session musicians outstanding, production top-notch and the whole marshmallow-cream confection was underpinned by the polished steel of Lacy Gibson’s rock ‘n’ roll guitar. This was music not for the Southern juke joint but for the chrome-trimmed radio of a pink Chevy convertible filled with well-scrubbed white teenagers.”\n\nRed Army Blues [The Waterboys] With all the current shit happening in Ukraine I’ve been doing a lot of listening to and reading on the history of that part of the world. Especially during the interwar years. The writings of Timothy Snyder and Steve Kotkin in particular have been fascinating and enlightening. This song tells the sad story of a Soviet soldier who helps to liberate Berlin and defeat Nazism but is then transported to the infamous Gulag because his supposed exposure to non-Soviet people and countries represented a threat to the USSR.\n\nThe Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners [The Foo Fighters] Dave Grohl wrote this acoustic instrumental piece for two miners in the Beaconsfield gold mine collapse in Tasmania, Australia, in 2006. A few days after the collapse, while the rescue was still being planned, one of the miners, Brant Webb, requested that an iPod be sent down to them, filled with Foo Fighters songs. Dave Grohl heard about this story, and wrote a note to them stating, “Though I’m halfway around the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I want you to know that when you come home, there’s 2 tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and 2 cold beers waiting for yous. Deal?” The men were safely rescued, and Dave Grohl later met up with Webb during the band’s 3-night acoustic tour at the Sydney Opera House in October 2006. Grohl played this piece for the meeting with the miner, and assured him it would be on the next Foo Fighters album.\n\nExile [Hugh Masekela] a moving piece by the great South African trumpeter who, like his one-time wife, Miriam Makeba, spent many years in exile. This an interesting write up on how living in exile effected his music making.\n\nThe Klan [Gil Scott-Heron]. A follow up to Steel Pulse’s Ku Klux Klan on yesterday’s post.\n\nCountryside was cold and still\n\nAnd there were three crosses on the hill\n\nAnd each one wore a burning hood\n\nTo hide its rotten core of wood\n\nAnd I say father, father I hear an iron sound\n\nHoof beats on the frozen ground\n\nAnd downhill the riders came\n\nLord it was a cryin’ shame\n\nTo see the blood upon their whips\n\nTo hear the snarlin’ from their lips\n\nAnd I cried mother, mother I feel a stabbing pain\n\nBlood runs down like summers rain\n\nAnd each one wore a mask of white\n\nTo hide his cruel face from sight\n\nAnd each one sucked a hungry breath\n\nOut of the empty lungs of death\n\nAnd I say sister, sister, I need you to take my hand\n\nIt’s always lonely when it’s time to stand\n\nHe who rides with the klan\n\nIs a devil and not a man\n\nFor underneath his white disguise\n\nI have looked into his eyes\n\nAnd I say brother, brother, stand by me\n\nIt’s not so easy to be free\n\nFather, mother, sister, brother, stand by me\n\nIt’s not so easy to be free (x3)\n\nNobody ever said it would be easy (x2)\n\nGrosebeck Blues [Lightning Hopkins] “A Groesbeck Jail or Prison is a secure facility located in Groesbeck, TX where individuals, referred to as inmates, are involuntarily confined and their freedoms and movement are restricted as a consequence of criminal behavior. Groesbeck Jails are short-term facilities where inmates either await trial or sentencing for a crime or serve relatively short sentences. Groesbeck Prisons are longer-term facilities where inmates serve out a prison sentence, usually of a year or more, for their crimes.“ So states the bureaucratic blurb at CountyOffice.org.\n\nLightnin’ Hopkins gives a more humane look at this place:\n\nGrandma said, “Son, if you had been a good boy yes/ and stayed at home, you’d have been working for your mama, I’m talking about, and picking up chips on your grandma’s farm”/ can’t do nothing but hang my lonesome head and moan\n\nThe Story of Bo Diddley [The Animals] No commentary needed. A story of Bo Diddley and a potted history of his role in the emergence of rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nHellfire Club [Imelda May]: In the 16th and 17th centuries Hellfire Clubs, establishments where gentlemen of standing (many politicians in their number) could behave like debauched teenagers without mummy watching, sprung up across Britain and Ireland. As their name suggests these clubs had a reputation for dangerous, risky and risqué business.\n\nMontpelier Hill, better known as The Hellfire Club to Dubliners, is a lovely place for a walk. It has a variety of short forest trails and provides wonderful views of the city from the southwest. Imelda tells a story of a card game with the Devil himself supposedly played on this very site.\n\nThe story goes that on one night\n\nA game of cards was played\n\nA knock on the door and entered in\n\nA man of wealth in spades\n\nHe stayed and played one hell of a game\n\nBut when one card fell loose\n\nUpon bending down a player saw\n\nThe stranger’s feet were hooves\n\nOh welcome to the Hellfire Club, the Hellfire Club\n\nEnola Gay [OMD]: According to Song Facts “Enola Gay was the American plane that dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima in World War II. It was named after Enola Gay Tibbets, the mother of the plane’s pilot, Paul Tibbets. So why did the electronic music group OMD write a song about it? In our 2010 interview, we asked their lead singer Andy McCluskey, who replied: “Many people simply don’t know what it’s actually about. Some even thought it was a coded message that we were gay. We were both geeks about WWII airplanes. The most famous and influential single bomber was Enola Gay. Obvious choice for us, really.”\n\n41 Shots (American Skin) [Bruce Springsteen] Remember when one Rudolph Guliani was mayor of New York City? A crime buster. A Mafia-destroyer. A fearsome and much loved public figure. Used to known as America’s Mayor. That was not too long before his true colors were exposed during the Trump years. The killing of Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo by NYC’s finest as stepped outside his apartment, is one of the many notorious episodes of police violence directed at people of colour in the land of the “Free”. The police officers thought that Diallo was a serial rapist drawing a pistol against them. However, Diallo was an innocent man who was unarmed.\n\nThe Last Honky Tonk in Chicago [Wild Earp & The Free For Alls] You can imagine that there are many contenders for this appellation. Carol’s Pub is one which did indeed close down but then opened again in 2019. But according to Bloodshot Records for whom Wild Earp recorded this song, “With their response to Buck Owens’s “Close Up the Honky Tonks,” they give gratitude to the Sunday two-step matinee at the Empty Bottle. The message is inspired by the resurgence of traditional country music following the closure of some local honky tonks.” So there you have it folks. The definitive answer. Next time you’re in the Windy City, check it out. I know I will.\n\nHell of a Night [Roy Gaines and The Crusaders]: Another song in praise of the musicians and blues music joints of Chicago’s West and South Sides. Major name drops herein.\n\nRichard Manuel [Black Prairie] a poignant but disturbing retelling of the suicide of troubled Canadian keyboardist/singer of the The Band.\n\nPediatric Brain Tumor Facts [Dave Desmelik] A recitation of some sad statistics and data of a disease that took the singer’s song’s life.\n\nStrawberry Fields Forever [The Beatles] John Lennon, in his 1980 interview with Playboy magazine stated: “Strawberry Fields is a real place. After I stopped living at Penny Lane, I moved in with my auntie who lived in the suburbs in a nice semidetached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around… not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all the Beatles stories. In the class system, it was about half a class higher than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in government-subsidized housing. We owned our house and had a garden. They didn’t have anything like that. Near that home was Strawberry Fields, a house near a boys’ reformatory where I used to go to garden parties as a kid with my friends Nigel and Pete we would go there and hang out and sell lemonade bottles for a penny. We always had fun at Strawberry Fields. So that’s where I got the name. But I used it as an image. Strawberry Fields forever.”\n\nCutteslowe Walls [Thea Gilmore]: The Cutteslowe Walls in Oxford, built in 1934, were over two metres high and topped with lethal spikes. They divided the City Council’s Cutteslowe estate from private housing to the west which was developed by Clive Saxton of the Urban Housing Company. Saxton, described as every inch a businessman, was afraid that his housing would not sell if so-called ‘slum’ dwellers were going to be neighbours, and the walls were built to separate them. In fact, the council tenants settled in well and soon raised a petition asking for the walls to be demolished. Abe Lazarus, a Communist politician, took up their cause. He called himself Bill Firestone because he had once led a successful strike at the Firestone Rubber Company. He put on a pantomime in which he even played the part of the good fairy. The residents doubted whether the interference of a left-wing politician would help their cause. In 1936 Lazarus and his supporters marched on the wall with pickaxes. The police barred their way and the attempt failed.\n\nThea’s song tells a working class story of children playing the shadow of the Walls.\n\nShe was 3 years old when they built them\n\n9 feet tall and an iron crown\n\nHer brother’s friend laid the foundations\n\n‘Cause there’s nothing like money keeps a poor boy down\n\nHer daddy flew in 1940\n\nDidn’t remember his voice at all\n\nBut she recalled all kinds of trouble\n\nIf she played in the shadow of the Cutteslowe Walls\n\nNicaragua [Bruce Cockburn] It was the American war against the Marxist Sandinista regime of Nicaragua in the early 1980s that was the issue that sparked Cockburn’s interest in political song writing.\n\nBreakfast woodsmoke on the breeze —\n\nOn the cliff the U.S. Embassy\n\nFrowns out over Managua like Dracula’s tower.\n\nThe kid who guards Fonseca’s tomb\n\nCradles a beat-up submachine gun —\n\nAt age fifteen he’s a veteran of four years of war\n\nProud to pay his dues\n\nHe knows who turns the screws\n\nBaby face and old man’s eyes\n\nGuantanamo [Ry Cooder] How time passes and the crimes of one era fade so quickly. At the beginning of this century the name Guantanamo was on everyone’s lips. Obama didn’t do the right thing and kept the prison operating. Around the world, Guantánamo remains one of the most enduring symbols of the injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law that the US unleashed in response to the 9/11 attacks,” said Letta Tayler, an associate Crisis and Conflict director at Human Rights Watch and a recent report on the prison camp’s history.\n\nKarla Faye [Mary Gauthier] Karla Faye Tucker was executed on 3 February 1998 by lethal injection in Texas. There is probably no better artist today to tell the story of this murderer; stark but compassionate.\n\nA little girl lost, her world full of pain\n\nHe said it feels good, she gave him her vein\n\nThe dope made her numb and numb felt like free\n\nUntil she came down, down, down to a new misery\n\nAtlantic Cable [Big Big Train] Let’s close out with one of the oddest subjects for a song, the first transatlantic telegraph cable!\n\nTrue Yarns: songs based on real events and people Volume 12\n\nSpirit of the Falklands [New Model Army]: It’s 1982. Margaret Thatcher, the steely Prime Minister of Britain is in deep political strife. Her fellow Tories are nipping at her heels. The newspapers are predicting she won’t be able to lead the party to victory in the upcoming elections. The defence budget was being readied for a huge cut, including the legendary British navy. The lease on Hongkong negotiated as part of the settlement of the Opium Wars in the 1840s, is up. The famous port city will be handed back to China very soon. Deep in the South Atlantic the generals of Argentina sense that given Britain is so weak, this might be a good time to do some ‘grabbing back’ of their own. They’ve long wanted to regain control the tiny Malvinas/Falkland Islands where a mere 2000 (mostly sheep farmers) souls reside. They invaded. Thatcher, ever quick to mine even the thinnest sliver of silver from a black cloud’s lining, ordered the Royal Navy to sail out and knock the bloody fools out. It was a gamble and it worked a treat. Lasting 74 days, the conflict was the first military action since the Second World War that utilised all elements of the Armed Forces.\n\nOf course, in certain circles—such as left leaning students, workers and several rock ‘ roll bands– the war was nothing but a move to rally the country around a war time leader and save her despised regime. Hence the opening verse of the New Model Army’s song:\n\nThe natives are restless tonight, sir\n\nCooped up on estates with no hope in sight\n\nThey need some kind of distraction\n\nWe can give them that\n\n‘Cause they’d kill if they only had something to kill for\n\nThey’d die if they only had something to die for\n\nThey’d cheer if they only had something to cheer for\n\nWe can give them that\n\nSo it’s off to war we go (I couldn’t believe it)\n\nBring out all the flags (I never believed it)\n\nFight the good fight\n\nKu Klux Klan [Steel Pulse]: Everyone is at least superficially aware of who this pack of pointy-hatted racists is. But did you know that in the 1920s membership in the KKK was massive not just in the South but all across the USA? Donald Trump’s grandaddy was a member. Robert Byrd, long serving Senator of West Virginia, was a member. So too (so some say) were Presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson, Calvin Coolidge and Warren Harding.\n\nSergio Leone [Jackson Browne]: Often directly associated with the Spaghetti Western, director Sergio Leone was by no means the inventor of the sub-genre, but did more than any other Italian director to popularize it overseas, particularly in the United States. Jackson Browne tips his hat to the genre and the giant.\n\nBlack Velvet [Alannah Myles]: Not the famous fictional horse but the very real King of Rock n Roll, Elvis Aaron Presley. The title of this song is a wonderful way to describe the forcefield that was Elvis. The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything\n\nAlways wanting more, he’d leave you longing for\n\nAs last count that boy has sold 146.5 million records! Just a bronze medal in the music Olympics however, behind silver medallist Garth Brooks and golden winners, The Beatles.\n\nThe Presidents [Jonathan Coulton]: I’ve been asked so many times to name all 50 American States (fairly easy) and sometimes to include their capitals (very hard). I’ve never been asked however, to name all of the American Presidents. But Jonathan Coulton, folkie/comic song-writer does just that all the way from George Washington to Dubya. I hope he updates this at some point with another verse, as the last 2 go rounds would provide incredibly rich material. The first African American and the first infant President.\n\nAcadian Driftwood [The Band] Acadia was a North American colony started by France in 1604. “Acadian Driftwood” is about the Expulsion of the Acadians, which involved Britain forcing the deportation of more than 11,000 Acadians during the French and Indian War. Known as the Acadian Migration. In the years after the British conquest, the Acadians refused to swear unconditional oaths of allegiance to the British crown. During this time period some Acadians participated in militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to Fortress Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting them.\n\nThis process began in 1755, after the British captured Fort Beauséjour and began the expulsion of the Acadians with the Bay of Fundy Campaign. Between six and seven thousand Acadians were expelled from Nova Scotia to the lower British American colonies. Some Acadians eluded capture by fleeing deep into the wilderness or into French-controlled Canada. The Quebec town of L’Acadie (now a sector of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu) was founded by expelled Acadians. After the siege of Louisbourg (1758), a second wave of the expulsion began with the St. John River Campaign, Petitcodiac River Campaign, Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign and the Île Saint-Jean Campaign. The Acadians and the Wabanaki Confederacy created a significant resistance to the British throughout the war. They repeatedly raided Canso, Lunenburg, Halifax, Chignecto and into New England. Any pretense that France might maintain or regain control over the remnants of Acadia came to an end with the fall of Montreal in 1760 and the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which permanently ceded almost all of eastern New France to Britain.\n\nThe war was over\n\nAnd the spirit was broken\n\nThe hills were smokin’\n\nAs the men withdrew\n\nWe stood on the cliffs,\n\nOh and watched the ships,\n\nSlowly sinking to their rendezvous\n\nJack The Ripper [Link Wray]: The Jack the Ripper murders occurred in the East End of London in 1888 and, although the Whitechapel Murderer was only a threat to a very small section of the community in a relatively small part of London, the crimes had a huge impact on society as a whole. Indeed, by focusing the attention of the press and the public at large on the streets and people of one of London’s poorest and most crime-ridden quarters, Jack the Ripper, whoever he may have been, managed to expose the sordid underbelly of Victorian society and, in so doing, he helped create an awareness amongst the wealthier citizens of London of the appalling social conditions that had been allowed to develop, largely unchecked, right on the doorstep of the City of London, the wealthiest square mile on earth.\n\nLink Wray’s 1963 instrumental is dark, eerie and full of menace and lurking danger.\n\nIngrid Bergman [Billy Bragg]: Bergman was one of the greatest actresses from Hollywood’s lamented Golden Era. Her natural and unpretentious beauty and her immense acting talent made her one of the most celebrated figures in the history of American cinema. Bergman is also one of the most Oscar-awarded actresses, tied with Meryl Streep and Frances McDormand, all three of them second only to Katharine Hepburn. Apparently, Woody Guthrie was a big fan. While the folk singer is commonly thought of as a composer of socially and politically charged songs and a champion of the common man, he wrote on a variety of topics, and composed this song about Bergman in 1950. Guthrie’s granddaughter Anna Canoni says, “He had a huge crush on her, and he wrote just this wonderful song about her. It’s a very erotic song. Just the fact that he wrote an erotic song about Ingrid Bergman is so funny to me.” This is Billy Bragg’s cover of Guthrie’s original.\n\nBen McCulloch [Steve Earle]: Unlike many generals who served during the Civil War, Benjamin McCulloch did not receive formal military training prior to the outbreak of war. Born in Tennessee, McCulloch moved to Texas in 1835 along with Davy Crockett. He fought with the Texas army in the Battle of San Jacinto against Mexican forces and went on to serve during the Mexican American War under Zachary Taylor. When Texas seceded from the Union in February of 1861, McCulloch led a group of Texas state troops as a colonel and forced Union general David Twiggs to surrender arms and equipment in San Antonio. On May 11, 1861, McCulloch received a commission as brigadier general in the Confederate army and was placed in charge of troops in Arkansas.\n\nSteve Earle’s song tells the story of two Confederate soldiers who fought under McCulloch. At first they idolize him but as things go south (pun intended) their feelings turn bitter.\n\nPresident Diawara [Dembo Konte, Kausu Kuyateh & The Jali Roll Orchestra]: I’m not entirely sure whether this is correct but I am pretty confident that this West African song is about the President of Gambia, Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara. My thinking is based only on the fact that the artists—with the exception of The Jali Roll Orchestra aka. 3 Mustaphas 3—are Gambian and there is a tradition of singing praise songs to prominent leaders in Africa. But if anyone can set me straight I’d love to hear from you.\n\nGalileo [The Indigo Girls]: Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei provided a number of scientific insights that laid the foundation for future scientists. His investigation of the laws of motion and improvements on the telescope helped further the understanding of the world and universe around him. Both led him to question the current belief of the time — that all things revolved around the Earth. Though not a song directly related to the great man’s life, here is how the writer Emily Saliers (one of two Indigo Girls) sees it. “I was thinking about him because he came up with such great truths. He was like this pinnacle of light and truth, and the church made him recant. So, I was thinking, he’s a great role model for a truth seeker, and with reincarnation being a spiritual pursuit and its relationships to the church, I was just sort of lumping those things together. His name just popped in my head. I thought he was such a brave guy, and then to have to recant that, and then of course we all know what he discovered is true now, or as true as we can believe it to be, so he just became the focal point [of the song].”\n\nThe Lawson Family Murder [Boxcar Bandits]: Nobody knows why Charles ‘Charlie’ Lawson snapped on Christmas 1929 morning and performed one of the most unspeakable acts a human being can, but as you can imagine, there is plenty of speculation surrounding just what drove him to slaughter all but one member of his family.\n\nThis version is an adaption of the Stanley Brothers song ‘The Story of the Lawson Family. Deeply sad.\n\nMyrna Loy [Josh Ritter]: A song about one of Hollywood’s most beloved stars of the 20s and 30s. Josh Ritter’s story doesn’t mention the actress by name but is a fan’s touching homage to the queen of the silent screen.\n\nBeing for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! [The Beatles]: I’ve been listening to this song for nigh on to 45 years and only recently discovered it has a fascinating and true back story! Most interesting (to me) is that the oddly-named Pablo Fanque was a famous Afro-British showman from Norwich!!\n\nA League of Notions [Al Stewart]: After a series of bilateral armistices had brought an end to the hostilities, the victorious powers of World War I met at the Paris Conference in 1919 to negotiate comprehensive peace agreements. They drafted and signed the Treaty of Versailles which officially ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied and Associated Powers. Part I of the Treaty was the Covenant of the League of Nations, the document that constituted the League of Nations and laid out its purpose and activities.\n\nI’m here sitting in the wreck of Europe\n\nWith a map of Europe\n\nSpread out in a hall of Versailles\n\nAnd every single nationality and principality\n\nhave come for a piece of the pie\n\nAl Stewart is a huge history buff; many of his songs are poetic retelling of real world events, especially Europe between the Wars. According to Song Facts: When Al performed it at Redondo Beach, California on July 19, 2009, he explained some of the background to the song, which includes a reference to “Churchill’s hiccup”. As British Colonial Secretary, Winston Churchill was given the task of drawing the boundary of what was then Transjordan; the curiously zig-zagged line was – said Al – attributed to the three brandies that preceded his drawing it, a mistake he refused to correct afterwards. Although this tale appears to have no basis in fact, Churchill’s fondness for the demon drink has been well documented by historians as disparate as David Irving and John Charmley. The betrayal of Lawrence of Arabia (and the Arabs he enlisted to the British cause) is also included in the song, and was no laughing matter, leading as it did to decades of strife and bloodshed in the Middle East which continues to the present day.\n\nGeronimo’s Cadillac [Michael Murphey]: Geronimo (lit. ’the one who yawns’;) is probably one of the two or three most recognised names in American western history. As an Apache shaman (not chief) of the Ndendahe clan, he led many attacking raids against Mexican and European/American incursions into traditional Apache land. Geronimo’s raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache–United States conflict, which started with the American invasion of Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848. Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people, and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life. Geronimo led breakouts from the reservations in attempts to return his people to their previous nomadic lifestyle. During Geronimo’s final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886, he surrendered three times and eventually accepted life on the Apache reservations.\n\nThis article is an interesting explication on Murphey’s song –a mix of fact and fiction– which is very worth reading. It tells the story of the great shaman’s final years of humiliation as a curiosity for European Americans.\n\nThey put Geronimo in jail down south\n\nWhere he couldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth\n\nSergeant, Sergeant, don’t you feel\n\nThere’s something wrong with your automobile?\n\nGovernor, Governor, now aint it strange\n\nThey didn’t have no cars on the Indian range?\n\nWarden, Warden, listen to me\n\nBe brave and set Geronimo free\n\nTom Rushen Blues [Charley Patton]: Charley Patton was actually singing about Tom Rushing, who was elected sheriff of Merigold, Mississippi in 1928 and served in that office until 1932. Paramount Records transcribed the name of the song incorrectly when Patton recorded it in 1929. According to writers Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow\n\n“An apparent arrest for drunkeness led him to concoct a sedate blues that smacks of an attempt to curry favor with the recently-installed high sheriff of Merigold, O.T. Rushing, who had assumed office in 1928 and would hold that position for the next four years.” The song is like a newspaper article speaking of many people who lived in Merigold. I highly recommend taking a few minutes to read the linked article. Full of great details about Rushing and Patton.\n\nThomas Merton [Judy Collins]: From one Tom to another. This one, Thomas Merton is arguably the most influential American Catholic author of the twentieth century. His autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain, has sold over one million copies and has been translated into over fifteen languages. He wrote over sixty other books and hundreds of poems and articles on topics ranging from monastic spirituality to civil rights, nonviolence, and the nuclear arms race.\n\nJudy Collins, an icon of the 60s folk music revival and enduring performer and writer has always been spiritually inclined. When asked in a recent interview to explain the connection between music and spirituality, Collins responded: The things that count to most of us are not things we can touch, and they’re not things we can even describe. The things that move us and that change us, I think, and nourish us are music and art and painting and singing and all the things we can’t see. We hear them. We look at things. We internalize things, but we can’t really say what is it about hope? Hope — you can’t touch it. Pain and loss — you can’t touch it, but you know you feel it. So the things that I feel are the most important things in my life — love and hope and courage and attitude — and so all of my life, with music, I have had an inspiring kind of other-worldly voice or voices sometimes, whether it’s Mozart or whether it’s Pete Seeger or songs that I — or whether it’s pop music, whether it’s Lennon-McCartney. It’s always mystical in a way, and it heals me, and it heals other people. I think I was given music so that I could get through life and be the first participant in the healing — of making my own music.\n\nThe wind sang in the bare woods\n\nAnd Thomas prayed by the trees\n\nI heard him whisper through my dreams\n\nThat life was a reprise\n\nI met him on the mountain\n\nSeven times we walked\n\nI heard his voice and saw his life\n\nAnd listened to his talk\n\nTaj Mahal [Jorge Ben]: The Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. It is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. But more than just the architecture, the love story that inspired the building of the monument is what fascinates Brazilian singer Jorge Ben in this awestruck tribute.\n\nThe Pill [Loretta Lynn]: And from awe inspiring love to casual sex, Loretta Lynn, the conservative feminist icon of country music, lets it rip in one of her greatest [and most controversial] anthems:\n\nAll these years I’ve stayed at home\n\nWhile you had all your fun\n\nAnd every year that’s gone by\n\nAnother baby’s come\n\nThere’s a gonna be some changes made\n\nRight here on nursery hill\n\nYou’ve set this chicken your last time\n\n‘Cause now I’ve got the pill\n\nThe contraceptive pill is often described as one of the most significant medical advances of the 20th century. Inextricably linked to the swinging 60s, free love and women’s liberation, the pill, a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progestin, was developed in the US in the 1950s by the American biologist Dr Gregory Pincus.\n\nAs for Loretta, many stations banned the song when it was released in 1932…no actually 1975! That was the year I graduated High School. Not too long ago. And they were still banning songs as basic as this?!\n\nMy Parents Think Fox News Is Real [Michael Brown]: Has there ever been a more reviled or adored source of news in the silly history of humanity? For a leftie like me there are dozens of articles ranting about the malignant effect of Murdoch’s little TV network on American society. Michael Brown’s parents (as well as most of my Arizona, Montana and California living) cousins would beg to differ.\n\nYoung Abe Lincoln [Johnny Horton]: The 16th President of the US of A is loved by everyone –the current GOP and Democrats—who both argue they are true upholders of his legacy. This New Yorker article looks at how old Abe is always being reinvented to suit various agendas. In this song Johnny Horton gives a pretty bog standard recitation of the great man’s life before the fateful day he was shot down by John Wilkes Booth.\n\nThe War Between the States [The Austin Lounge Lizards]: Nobody does satire better than the boys from Austin. You got to read the lyrics as you listen to this ditty. A satirical song about the United States Civil War from the perspective of an oblivious southerner. Like many Austin Lounge Lizard Songs, it pokes fun at unjustified southern pride, in this case excessively romantic “Lost Cause”-style nostalgia for the war.\n\nDixie [Bob Dylan]: A traditional song—and unofficial Confederate national anthem—loved by millions (including a Young Abe Lincoln who was born in the South and often had it performed at his campaign rallies). Why is the southern US known as ‘Dixie’? Here are a couple interesting theories.\n\nMiriam’s Goodbye to Africa [Miriam Makeba & The Skylarks]: Miriam Makeba is an icon not just of South Africa and the anti-apartheid struggle but of world music. In the late 50s she was in New York when news of the death of her mother arrived. When she applied for permission to return to South Africa to say goodbye the consulate cancelled her passport, starting a 31-year exile from Africa.\n\nTrue Yarns: songs inspired by real people and events Volume 11\n\nTrue Yarns Volume 11\n\nBlack Betty – According to American Songwriter, “The original song, “Black Betty,” started as a work song, sung predominately by Black people in the early 20th century. Though its roots may even extend beyond that into the 19th. While it may seem obvious the song is about a woman named “Betty,” that meaning is likely not accurate—at least, not entirely. The song, like many early blues songs, has ties to the great songwriter and performer Lead Belly. Some sources claim that “Black Betty” was written by Lead Belly, though others claim that he adapted it from even earlier versions. Because of its populist origins, the song has many recordings—more recently, Tom Jones took a stab at it. But the most famous in modern day is Ram Jam’s rock version, which is sung with slightly modified lyrics. While some may think “Black Betty” refers to a woman, others claim it’s a nickname for any number of objects, including a bottle of whiskey, a whip, or even a penitentiary transfer wagon. In Northern England and southern Scotland, wrote David Hackett Fischer, the term “Black Betty” was offered used for a bottle of whiskey. That euphemism was later adopted in the country regions of the eastern United States.” (More on this song HERE)\n\nGhosts of Cape Horn – An old sailing saying goes, “below 40 degrees latitude, there is no law; below 50, there is no God.” Cape Horn, the southerly headland of the Tierra del Fuego archipelago, is at 56 degrees south – which makes sailing around Cape Horn especially difficult. When gale force winds and huge waves hit, even the most experienced sailors need their wits about them. Many famous seamen of the ages have taken a look at Cape Horn and turned back. Allegedly, Sir Francis Drake set eyes on the cape in 1578 but thought better of making the crossing. Portuguese sailor Ferdinand Magellan also had serious reservations about sailing around Cape Horn. Instead of attempting to sail past the headland, Magellan opted for the strait which now bears his name. The first sailor to conquer the cape was Dutchman Jacob le Maire in 1616. Le Maire named the outpost after the town of Hoorn, in honor of the sponsors of his expedition. Captain Cook also managed to circumvent Cape Horn about 150 years later with his ship HMS Endeavour. Despite le Maire and Cook’s successes, Cape Horn’s infamy was far from forgotten. Captain William Bligh failed to make the crossing with his ship The Bounty in 1787 and Spanish conquistadors feared the cape so much they hauled their looted gold across land. In 1830, Richard Henry Dana Jr. wrote about his experience sailing around Cape Horn in his memoir: “Hurrying upon deck, we found a large black cloud rolling on toward us from the south-west, and blackening the whole heavens. “Here comes Cape Horn!”, said the chief mate; and we had hardly time to haul down and clew up before it was upon us. In a few moments, a heavier sea was raised than I had ever seen before…At the same time, sleet and hail were driving with all fury against us.” Gordon Lightfoot’s song remembers the many boats and sailors who sunk to the bottom of two oceans at this most treacherous of Capes.\n\nElmore James for President – “Elmore James was born on January 27th 1918 in Richland, Holmes County, Mississippi as the illegitimate son of 15 year old Leola Brooks. His father was Joe Willie “Frost” James, who moved in with his mother and was the reason Elmore took his surname. At the age of 12 he started making music using one-string instruments like the diddley-bow, which was strung on a shack wall. Eventually as time passed Elmore developed into a solid musician by the time he was 18. It was during this period that he met a certain musician who went onto became one of his strongest influences. This was none other than the legendary Robert Johnson. His unique ability as a singer, songwriter, instrumentalist & guitarist earned him the title “King of The Slide Guitar”. As a guitarist he is notable for loud amplification and a distant tone, which went onto influence generations of musicians like Eric Clapton, Brian Jones & Peter Green for example. Although his name may disappear alongside the commercial likes of his Chicago Blues peers, without him Rock N’ Roll wouldn’t have existed today.” This full bio/article on this great bluesman is definitely worth reading.\n\nRetread Cadillac (Lightnin’) – Along with Muddy Waters and “Champion” Jack Dupree, Sam ‘Lightnin’’ Hopkins is an essential part of my personal blues holy trinity. “Born Sam Hopkins on March 15, 1912, his father was a musician who died when Sam was very young. The family moved to Leona in Texas where he grew up; in 1920 he watched Blind Lemon Jefferson at a picnic in Buffalo, Texas, which inspired him to make a “cigar box” guitar. His older brother Joel taught him to play the homemade guitar before his mother, Frances, encouraged him to play organ at her home church services. However, he was drawn to the music played by his older brothers Joel and John Henry. He soon dropped out of school and started work on a plantation. “I did a little plowin’ – not too much, chopped a li’l cotton, pulled a li’l corn. I did a little of it all.” He, like many other bluesmen, began playing at picnics and dances at local farms on a Friday and Saturday night; later he took to hoboing throughout Texas. By the end of the 1920’s he formed a partnership with his cousin, Texas Alexander, and the two of them played on street corners for tips. Their partnership continued until the mid 1930’s when Hopkins was sent to Houston County Prison Farm, for some unknown offense. After his release, he rejoined Alexander working at picnics, parties, and juke joints, as well as working outside of music. He would travel around Texas, often on buses, where the drivers would even let him ride for free as long as he played for the passengers. In 1946, Hopkins and Alexander were given the chance to record by an Aladdin Record’s talent scout, inexplicably only Hopkins followed up the offer when Lightnin’ made the trip out west to Los Angeles on November 4, 1946. He cut “Katie Mae Blues,” with pianist Wilson “Thunder” Smith; they were billed as Thunder and Lightnin’. It was a hit in the Southwest, so Aladdin got him back into the studio a year later and he recorded “Short Haired Women,” which sold around 40,000 copies. In 1948 he sold over twice that many records with his recording of “Baby Please Don’t Go,” almost all of them around the Houston area and his home state.” Hopkins was naturally very sensitive to being ripped off by white music promoters so always insisted upon ‘cash in hand’ PRIOR to taking the stage. A little factoid Nathan Bell mentions in this tribute.\n\nJesse + Phil – refers to none other than two Southern Senators, Jesse Helms and Phil Gramm, two of the most divisive politicians in recent American history. Think of them as precursors to Trump, Cruz and the other yahoos who claim to stand for the American way. A New York Times Oped bids them an ungracious farewell in 2001. And the never boring Austin Lounge Lizards imagines them as an old married couple!\n\nVanessa – this song by one of the kings of Calypso, Mighty Sparrow, is acerbic, witty, salacious but ultimately celebratory. It’s danceable and funny. It’s cleverly constructed and it’s irreverent as most good Calypso is. In 1983, Vanessa Williams was the first African American woman to be crowned Miss America. 10 months later she was stripped of her title thanks to Bob Guccione, publisher of Penthouse, who published private nude photos she had made a year earlier as part of her modelling career. Scandal. Shock. Horror. Sadly, for the many moralising detractors who no doubt drew lofty and pious conclusions about oversexed black women trying to game an American institution, Vanessa was no pushover. She rebounded in the next few years to be a successful singer (with a #1 hit) actress and role model of grace and poise. In 2015, the Miss America CEO Sam Haskell publically apologised: “I want to apologise for anything that was said or done during the photo scandal. I have been a close friend to this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years,” Haskell said. “You have lived your life in grace and dignity and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984 when you resigned.” This song came out as the scandal was still fresh in people’s minds.\n\n“Sexy Vanessa/I hope you understand/I love the picture and I’m still your greatest fan/ I’m upset with you/and I’m jealous I’ll admit/ not for what you do/but because it’s not me you do it with”\n\nLone Pine Hill – an antiwar song set during the American Civil War is inspired by real events not descriptive of an actual event. “The song mentions several battles, including Manassas, Monocacy, Sailor’s Creek, and Five Forks. Sailor’s Creek and Five Forks were two of the last battles of the war. Five Forks was fought on April 1, 1865 as a rear-guard action to protect General Robert E. Lee’s supply lines as he evacuated Petersburg, Virginia. Union Major General Philip Sheridan (also mentioned in the song) overwhelmed the Confederates and inflicted heavy casualties. Sailor’s Creek, April 6, 1865, was the largest battle on the road to Appomattox Courthouse and the Confederate Army’s eventual surrender three days later. Interestingly, the 2nd Regiment, West Virginia Cavalry did fight at the Battle of Sailor’s Creek, but for the Union.”\n\nBaai is a song from a wonderful album titled Ceasefire by two Sudanese musicians: Emmanuel Jal, rapper from what is now South Sudan, and Abdel Gadir Salim, Sudan’s most famous musical export. The conflict in that country—now nearly 50 years running—has been one of Africa’s most persistent and brutal. When I worked in the Horn of Africa for the UN I found the stories I was told by refugees escaping Sudan to be among the most horrific and indescribable I’ve ever heard. Emmanuel Jal was himself a child soldier who probably was forced to commit some terrible crimes before he managed to escape to Kenya where he was adopted by an Englishwoman, aid worker Emma McCune. Interestingly, I met McCune once in the southern Sudanese town of Nasir, a small settlement built on a sharp bend in the Sobat River. I was there to meet some high level refugees from the recently fallen Communist government of Ethiopia in 1992 who were being protected incognito in the town as they awaited resettlement abroad. McCune was a legendary ‘African Queen’ type figure in the area. She was young and pretty and had married a prominent commander in the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). When my little plane landed on the mudstrip in Nasir she was commanding a logistics operation of sorts, moving quickly about the area on a muddy motorbike. Sadly, two years later she was killed in a road accident (how most aid workers who lose their lives die) in Kenya. Her husband, Reik Machar went on to be (and is) the Vice President of South Sudan. Her adopted son Emmanuel migrated to Canada and launched his music career. This song pleads for unity between the warring North and South.\n\nCalamity Jane –in which Grant Lee Phillips compares his woman to the legendary Deadwood amazon Calamity Jane.

The territory was first identified as East Timor in 1769 when Portugal the most powerful European power in the 16th and 17th centuries established a settlement and fort as part of their Indian Ocean spice-trading empire. In 1974/75 a democratically elected government in Portugal ousted the sclerotic Soares dictatorship and immediately announced it would grant independence to all its overseas colonies. Of course, this was not as much an act of magnanimity as one of political and economic reckoning. Wars against Portuguese power had been raging in most colonies for years; Portugal was a weak and exhausted power. ‘Granting’ independence was in fact, acknowledging defeat. Indonesia quickly invaded the former colony and from 1975-1999 maintained a brutal occupation. The USA and Australia played a dirty game in supporting Indonesia through most of these years but eventually when that country fell out of favor with the Western powers, East Timor was championed as the little nation that could. An Australian-led UN force went into the country soon after it declared independence and remained there until 2005. General Ken Gillespie led the force and is the one mentioned in this simple–almost nursery rhyme like—ditty. The country is now known as Timor Leste.\n\nBilly the Kid and Geronimo – An imagined conversation between two American legends: Billy the Kid, the outlaw and Geronimo, prominent leader and medicine man from the Bedonkohe band of the Apache people. Dave Alvin plays the part of Billy and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Geronimo.\n\nBaghdad – a song written in praise of the great city of history and capital of modern-day Iraq. Ilham Madfai, is a wonderful artist known as the John Lennon of Baghdad. Find out why!\n\nStewball – As a lad the Peter, Paul and Mary version of this folk song was one I loved to sing out loud. I never thought it was a song about a real racehorse but blow me down: “Skewball (the horse’s name has also been variously recorded as ‘Squball’, ‘Sku-ball’, or ‘Stewball’) was the name of an 18th-century British racehorse, most famous as the subject of a broadsheet ballad and folk-song. The Irish turf calendar states that he won six races worth £508 in 1752, when he was eleven years old, and was the top-earning runner of that year in Ireland. Skewball’s most famous race took place on the plains of Kildare, Ireland, which is generally the subject of the song of the same name.”\n\nRoy Rogers – From Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, this love song to a childhood idol is another one of my favorite history songs. “Born Leonard Franklin Slye, Rogers was raised on a farm in Duck Run, Ohio. In June 1930 the Slye family visited one of Roy’s sisters in California. The lure of warm weather and the hope of better job prospects led Rogers and his family to move to Los Angeles. Still, the Great Depression made jobs hard to find. Rogers drove a gravel truck and then worked as a fruit picker in the same central California farm camps John Steinbeck wrote about in The Grapes of Wrath. Rogers had grown up playing mandolin and calling square dances. When his sister encouraged him to appear on a local radio program that featured amateurs, he reluctantly gave it a try. A few days later he was asked to join a country music band called the Rocky Mountaineers, as a singer and guitarist. Before long he convinced them to add another vocalist so they could harmonize together. Bob Nolan was hired, and when he left the group, Tim Spencer replaced him. Over the course of the next two years, Rogers sang with a variety of country music groups, each of which was less successful than the one before. Finally, late in the summer of 1933, he decided to give it one more try by forming a group consisting of himself, Bob Nolan, and Tim Spencer. The Pioneer Trio, as they originally called themselves, worked on their harmonies while Nolan and Spencer began writing the songs that would become the heart of their repertoire.

If you don’t know what this song is about then I believe in Rip Van Winkle.\n\nMontcalm And Wolfe – The venerable Norman Blake tells the tale of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, a decisive battle in the French & Indian War that engulfed Quebec in 1758-9. In June 1759, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm the French commander made a major strategic error and lost the war to British General James Wolfe. According to Wikipedia: “In the second half of 1758, the British began to take the upper hand in North America, due in part to the massive resources they organized against the French and in part to the lack of reinforcements and supplies from France to support its colony, which was already on the brink of starvation following a catastrophic harvest. Louis XV therefore ordered the colony to reduce its defensive perimeter to the valley of the Saint Lawrence River, evacuating all forts in Ohio along with those around Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. The French Minister of War nonetheless expressed his full support to Montcalm, confident that despite the odds, he would find a way to frustrate the enemy’s plans, as he had done at Fort Carillon. This news, along with the threat of impending attack by the British, crushed Montcalm’s spirit, who had lost all hope of holding the city in case of a siege. Wolfe’s forces reached Quebec in late June, 1759, and taking position on the opposite shore, started bombarding the city on July 12, reducing the city to rubble over the course of two months. Montcalm, on many occasions, managed to repel attempted landings by the British forces, most notably at the Battle of Beauport, on 31 July 1759. After spending the month of August ravaging the countryside, the British would once again attempt a landing on September 13, this time at l’Anse au Foulons, catching the French off guard. Before Montcalm could react, Wolfe’s forces had already reached the plains outside the city, and were ready for battle. In a decision largely considered to be Montcalm’s greatest mistake, the general decided to attack the British with what forces he had rather than wait for the forces garrisoned along the shore to come and bolster his numbers. The marquis believed that if he allowed the British to fortify their position, he would not be able to defeat them, and the attack therefore could not wait. In the ensuing Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the French forces were defeated.”\n\nPoor Ellen Smith – “On July 20, 1892, Ellen Smith was fatally shot by Peter DeGraff near the Zinzendorf Hotel in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The murder became the subject of a popular turn-of-the-century ballad, “Poor Ellen Smith,” which has survived in at least three different versions.” This rendition by Gillian Welch and David Rawlings is one more.\n\nLee Harvey – maybe the second most famous assassin of an American President. Maybe the most famous. In case you don’t know anything about this guy, read this chronology. Hickoids’ singer claims that Harvey was a boyhood friend who took him ‘fishing all the time.’ Like the whole JFK story, there is much to consider there.\n\nBicentennial Blues – Just best to consult the lyrics as you listen to this classic track from Gil Scott Heron and Brian Jackson. No explanation from me needed.\n\nFlood Of ’57 – Natural disasters are a consistent theme of American folk music. Here is one about a fairly recent event, the devastating floods that ravaged West Virgina, Virginia, Tenessee and Kentucky in the year of my birth. “Devastating floods occurred across southeastern Kentucky, southwestern West Virginia, western Virginia, and northeastern Tennessee in late January and early February of 1957. In eastern Kentucky, the headwaters of the Big Sandy, Kentucky and Cumberland Rivers were especially hard hit. In fact, the 1957 flood remains the flood of record at several points on the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy, the North, Middle and South Forks of the Kentucky River, and on the upper reaches of the Cumberland River.”\n\nHey Bob Dylan – India is home to some truly diehard Bob Dylan fans such as Calcutta based folkie Susmit Bose. Based loosely on Dylan’s own Song for Woody, Bose confesses his love for the boy from Minnesota.\n\nMister Blue – White Bones of Allende – The CIA sponsored overthrow of Salvador Allende’s government in 1973 stands as one of the great stains on the American flag. Central to the violence was one Henry Kissinger generally regarded as the greatest American diplomat of modern times. New documents attest to his and Nixon’s intimate knowledge of what was going on, despite repeated official statements to the contrary.\n\nFrom St Kilda to Kings Cross – a classic of Australian popular music, this song extols the virtues of St Kilda and Kings Cross two iconic locations in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. Here is a bit on what inspired Paul Kelly’s composition. By the way: I am a supporter of the St. Kilda Football Club…who are doing well this year (so far!).\n\nWe Gotta Get Out of This Place – “Animals lead singer Eric Burdon came in #57 in a Rolling Stone poll to find the greatest singers of all time. On this song, he delivers an anger and energy that was an influence on later punk bands. In our 2010 interview with Eric Burdon, he said: “I’ve always viewed myself as a punk. The Animals could have evolved that way. We had the energy and the anger, but we didn’t stick together. When the punk scene became commercial, I was all for the politics of the movement, but the music didn’t really stand up and ultimately, it was self-destructive.” The song was very popular with the United States Armed Forces members stationed in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. It was frequently requested of, and played by, American Forces Vietnam Network disc jockeys. In 2006 two University of Wisconsin–Madison employees, one a Vietnam veteran, began an in-depth survey of hundreds of Vietnam veterans and found that “We Gotta Get Out of This Place” had resonated the strongest among all the music popular then: “We had absolute unanimity is this song being the touchstone. This was the Vietnam anthem. Every bad band that ever played in an armed forces club had to play this song.”\n\nTrue Yarns: songs inspired by real people and events Volume 10\n\nTrue Yarns: songs inspired by real events and people Volume 8\n\nTrue yarns 8\n\nZombie – A protest song against violence and especially the killing of two children by an IRA bomb. The Warrington bombings were two separate bomb attacks that happened during early 1993 in Warrington, England. The attacks were carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), and it has been claimed that members of Red Action were also involved. Shortly before midday on 20 March 1993, The Samaritans in Liverpool received a bomb warning by telephone. According to police, the caller said only that a bomb had been planted outside a Boots Pharmacy shop. Merseyside Police sent officers to branches of Boots in Liverpool and warned the Cheshire Constabulary, who patrolled nearby Warrington. About 30 minutes later, at about 12:25, two bombs exploded on Bridge Street in Warrington, about 100 yards (91 m) apart. The blasts happened within a minute of each other. One exploded outside Boots and McDonald’s, and one outside the Argos catalogue store. The area was crowded with shoppers. Witnesses said that “the first explosion drove panicking shoppers into the path of the next blast just seconds later”. It was later found that the bombs had been placed inside cast-iron litter bins, causing large amounts of shrapnel. Buses were organized to ferry people away from the scene and 20 paramedics and crews from 17 ambulances were sent to deal with the aftermath.\n\nThree-year-old Johnathan Ball died at the scene. He had been in town with his babysitter. The second victim, 12-year-old Tim Parry, received the full force of the blast and was gravely wounded. He died on 25 March 1993 when doctors switched his life support machine off, having asked permission to do so from his family, after tests had found minimal brain activity. Fifty-four other people were injured, four of them seriously. The Provisional IRA issued a statement the day after the bombing, acknowledging its involvement but saying: “Responsibility for the tragic and deeply regrettable death and injuries caused in Warrington yesterday lies squarely at the door of those in the British authorities who deliberately failed to act on precise and adequate warnings.”\n\nJames Dean – At the dawn of the rock and roll age there was no greater inspiration for the ‘spirit’ of the music than James Dean. The rebel. For no particular reason. The coolness. The danger. The sexuality. The dying young before you got too old and square. The Eagles were by no means the only group to make music in the actor’s memory but this pretty much sums up what that generation felt.\n\nYou were the low down rebel if there ever was\n\nEven if you had no cause\n\nJames Dean, you said it all so clean\n\nAnd I know my life would look alright\n\nIf I could see it on the silver screen\n\nWe’ll talk about a low-down bad refrigerator\n\nYou were just too cool for school\n\nSock hop, soda pop, basketball and auto shop\n\nThe only thing that got you off was breakin’ all the rules\n\nJames Dean, James Dean, so hungry and so lean\n\nDoomsday Cult Blues – A lumbering dark blues written from the perspective of a cult leader. Is this about any particular cult? No, but you can take your pick: Jim Jones; Shining Path; Aum Shinrikyo; David Koresh and His Branch Davidians; the Republican Party. Doomsday cults typically center around predictions of the apocalypse. What many of these groups also have in common is a leader who suggests his own messianic destiny. Several individuals have come forth throughout history holding these extraordinary beliefs and a select few garnering the enough attention to capture a crowd. Often, those who manage to attract a vast following do not actively recruit members or attempt to convince nonbelievers, rather they wait for the “chosen ones” to fall in line. To many, the idea of an individual who can predict the end of the world seems completely outside the boundaries of logic and reasoning. Our society is based on the notion that without scientific evidence, novel claims cannot be held to be true. Hence, when apocalyptic cults lack concrete proof for their predictions of the end times, they are dubbed implausible. However, for the many people who come to join Doomsday cults, their leaders are exactly what they preach to be. Consider, for example, what may be considered the largest cult to persist in history: Christians. Christianity is the largest religious following in the world and has been for centuries. Millions of people read the Bible, attend mass and pray devotedly in honor of a Messiah who led others to salvation. In the minds of cult followers, their group is no less legitimate than Jesus and his disciples.\n\nByrd From West Virginia – The longest serving senator in history, Robert C. Byrd gained his higher education in the United States Senate. Rising from an impoverished childhood in the coalfields of West Virginia, Byrd entered public office in 1947 without a college degree. As a senator he earned a law degree by attending classes in the evenings, and he never stopped studying. His careful reading of the Senate’s rules, precedents, and history made him a formidable opponent in debate and fueled his rise through party leadership to become Democratic Conference secretary (1967-1971), whip (1971-1977), and leader (1977-1989). He delivered more than 100 addresses on the history of the Senate, which were collected and published for the Senate’s bicentennial in 1989. On September 15, 1998, Senator Byrd delivered a “Leader’s Lecture” to his colleagues in the Old Senate Chamber. Senator Byrd died on June 28, 2010, having served for 51 years, 5 months, and 26 days.\n\nAccording to Robert Waller from the Los Angeles-based band I See Hawks in LA: “We were very sorry to hear of Senator Byrd’s passing today. We send our condolences to his family, West Virginians, and all Americans who benefitted from his long service in Congress. The original inspiration for our song “Byrd from West Virginia” came in 2003 when Byrd was the sole voice in the Senate to stand up vigorously against the Iraq War, making the Constitutional argument we were longing to hear. After further researching his life, we learned about his darker periods: a relationship with the KKK, opposition to the Civil Rights movement, etc. We could not sweep these sins under the rug. The song recalls the tumultuous history of 20th century America: the Depression, WWII, the racial tension of the ‘60s, and the Kennedy assassination. The end of the story is one of redemption, as Byrd challenges the establishment of American hegemony and the Iraq War. Byrd’s story, like America’s, is long and complex. Farewell and good journey.”\n\nThe Krugman Blues – Paul Krugman, professor of Economics, NY time columnist and Nobel Peace Laureate, is also a voice of the liberal ‘left’ of American politics. As only he can, Loudon Wainwright III sings a song of hilarious praise to the great man.\n\nWhen Paul goes on The News Hour to talk to old Jim Lehrer\n\nHe looks so sad and crestfallen it’s more than I can bear\n\nAnd all the other experts all seem way off base\n\nAnd I guess that I identify with that pissed off look on Paul’s face\n\nWhen Paul gets really bummed out that’s when I get scared\n\nBut if Paul says there’s a glint of hope I feel we’ve all been spared\n\nSometimes when he’s on the TV in the background you can spot his school logo\n\nKrugman teaches at Princeton you so Krugman ought to know\n\nCome Back Home, All Refugees – Checkpoint 303 is a non-profit musical collective from the emerging Arabic and Middle-Eastern underground electronica scene. The activist musical project, launched by Tunisian SC Mocha and Palestinian SC Yosh in 2004 and has secured an avant-garde position on the Arabic underground music scene. The non-commercial aspect of this musical project is a fundamental dimension of the band’s work since it allows for creative freedom and the liberty to express activist opinions. Checkpoint 303’s compositions are inspired by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the suffering it causes to the civilian populations throughout the region. This song speaks to an issue at the very heart of the Palestine/Israel conflict, the return of all Palestinians to their homeland. The narrator mentions the (in)famous Balfour Declaration, the “statement of British support for “the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.” It was made in a letter from Arthur James Balfour, the British foreign secretary, to Lionel Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild (of Tring), a leader of the Anglo-Jewish community. The British government hoped that the declaration would rally Jewish opinion, especially in the United States, to the side of the Allied powers against the Central Powers during World War I (1914–18). They hoped also that the settlement in Palestine of a pro-British Jewish population might help to protect the approaches to the Suez Canal in neighbouring Egypt and thus ensure a vital communication route to British colonial possessions in India.` The declaration had two indirect consequences, the emergence of a Jewish state and a chronic state of conflict between Arabs and Jews throughout the Middle East. It has been described as the “original sin” with respect to both Britain’s failure in Palestine and for wider events in Palestine. The statement also had a significant impact on the traditional anti-Zionism of religious Jews, some of whom saw it as divine providence; this contributed to the growth of religious Zionism amid the larger Zionist movement.\n\nSrinivas – Steve Earle condemns President Trump on the mournful yet uplifting “Srinivas,” which Marc Ribot wrote after reading about the February 2017 murder of two Indian men, Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, in Kansas. “Madman pulled the trigger; Donald Trump loaded the gun,” the singer belts over a strummed acoustic guitar. “My country ’tis of thee.” The track slowly crescendos with drums and waves of post-punk guitar feedback. In February 2017, “The Jameson guys,” as some on the staff at Austin’s Bar and Grill knew the pair, were on the patio on Wednesday evening. It was hardly unusual: Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India, often enjoyed an after-work whiskey at the bar they had adopted as a hangout. Adam W. Purinton was also there, tossing ethnic slurs at the two men and suggesting they did not belong in the United States, other customers said. Patrons complained, and Mr. Purinton was thrown out. But a short time later, he came back in a rage and fired on the two men, the authorities said. Mr. Kuchibhotla was killed, and Mr. Madasani was wounded, along with a 24-year-old man who had tried to apprehend the gunman, who fled.\n\nProhibition is a Failure – At midnight, January 16, 1920, the United States went dry; breweries, distilleries, and saloons were forced to close their doors. Led by the Anti-Saloon League and the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, the dry forces had triumphed by linking Prohibition to a variety of Progressive era social causes. Proponents of Prohibition included many women reformers, who were concerned about alcohol’s link to wife beating and child abuse, and industrialists, such as Henry Ford, who were concerned about the impact of drinking on labor productivity. Advocates of Prohibition argued that outlawing drinking would eliminate corruption, end machine politics, and help Americanize immigrants. Even before the 18th Amendment was ratified, about 65 percent of the country had already banned alcohol. In 1916, seven states adopted anti-liquor laws, bringing the number of states to 19 that prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages. America’s entry into World War I made Prohibition seem patriotic since many breweries were owned by German Americans. Wayne Wheeler, lobbyist for the Anti-Saloon League, urged the federal government to investigate “a number of breweries around the country which are owned in part by alien enemies.” In December 1917, Congress passed the 18th Amendment. A month later, President Woodrow Wilson instituted partial prohibition to conserve grain for the war effort. Beer was limited to 2.75 percent alcohol content, and production was held to 70 percent of the previous year’s production. In September, the president issued a ban on the wartime production of beer. Prohibition devastated the nation’s brewing industry. St. Louis had 22 breweries before Prohibition. Only nine reopened after Prohibition ended in 1933. Anheuser-Busch made it through Prohibition by making ice cream, near beer, corn syrup, ginger ale, root beer, yeast, malt extract, refrigerated cabinets, and automobile and truck bodies. The jobs and tax revenue that a legal liquor industry would generate looked attractive as the country entered the Great Depression. During his presidential campaign in 1932, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, who never hid his fondness for martinis, called for Prohibition’s repeal. The noble experiment ended at 3:32 p.m., December 5, 1933, when Utah became the 36th state to ratify the 21st Amendment, repealing Prohibition. By then, even some proponents admitted that the 18th Amendment resulted in “evil consequences.” The Rev. Sam Small, an evangelist and temperance advocate, said that Prohibition had created “an orgy of lawlessness and official corruption.” John D. Rockefeller, a teetotaller, observed in 1932, “drinking has generally increased, the speakeasy has replaced the saloon, and a vast army of lawbreakers has been recruited and financed on a colossal scale.” This song was written and sung originally by Lewis Stokes in 1930.\n\nThe Disappearance of Bigfoot – Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, is a giant ape-like creature that some people believe roams North America. It is a cryptid (or species rumored to exist)and just like the Chupacabra or Loch Ness monster, there’s scant physical evidence to suggest Bigfoot is actually out there. But that doesn’t stop alleged sightings of the ape that never shows its face or Bigfoot buffs from trying to prove there’s life in the legend. Most Bigfoot sightings occur in the Northwest, where the creature can be linked to Indigenous myths and legends. The word Sasquatch is derived from Sasq’ets, a word from the Halq’emeylem language used by some Salish First Nations peoples in southwestern British Columbia, according to the Oregon Encyclopedia. It means “wild man” or “hairy man.” This song in an interesting take on the myth, as seen from Bigfoot’s perspective.\n\nElvis Shot the Television – Firstly, a little background. This all starts with a singer named Robert Goulet. Goulet was most known for playing Sir Lancelot in the Broadway musical Camelot. On one occasion he sang the Star Spangled Banner on TV. Elvis was dating an actress called Linda Thompson at the time. Thompson’s brother Sam recalled what the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll said about Goulet’s singing voice. “He said ‘He’s got a lovely voice, but there’s no feeling there,’” Sam recalled. “‘It’s like, vocally, you sing an opera and you have to have feeling in your voice, like you’re talking.’” Elvis took huge issue with Goulet’s performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” because Goulet got the words wrong. In response, the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll said “You learn the words of our national anthem, you SOB!” Afterward, he shot the television set. His daughter. Lisa Marie Presley, asked her father why he chose to shoot the TV. He responded he did so because he didn’t want to stand up and turn it off.\n\nBallad of Birmingham – Dudley Randall first published “Ballad of Birmingham” as a broadside in 1965. The poem was written in response to the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which had a predominantly Black congregation and was targeted by white supremacists on September 15, 1963. Four young Black girls were killed in the explosion, and 22 other congregants were injured. This attack was set against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement and the efforts of leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to end segregation in the United States and, more specifically, in southern states like Alabama.\n\nMoses In the Wilderness – Larry Norman was the controversial lightning rod of the Christian rock movement, and that genre’s first superstar. A very, very good songwriter, Norman had a genuine love affair (and deep intuitive understanding) of the rock n roll idiom. He was also a very committed Jesus Freak and so his work is not known much outside the CCM culture. But he is one of my favorite writers and singers. In this song he tells the story of Moses with the wit of Loudon Wainwright III.\n\nMoses tending sheep in the fields one day\n\nHe thought he heard a burning scrub-brush say\n\nGotta free your people\n\nFrom the pharoah’s hand\n\nGotta take em all to the promised land\n\nHo Chi Minh – “Ho Chi Minh (originally Nguyen That Thanh) was born on 19 May 1890 in Hoang Tru in central Vietnam. Vietnam was then a French colony, known as French Indochina, but under the nominal rule of an emperor. Ho’s father worked at the imperial court but was dismissed for criticising the French colonial power. Ho Chi Minh led the Vietnamese nationalist movement for more than three decades, fighting first against the Japanese, then the French colonial power and then the US-backed South Vietnamese. He was President of North Vietnam from 1954 until his death. Like many revolutionaries of the time, he first approached the United States for support in ridding the French from Vietnam. They declined. And we know how that went.” The Last Poets’ song imagines a conversation between Uncle Sam and his counterpart, Uncle Ho.\n\nThe Night David Bowie Died – This song says little about David Bowie and a lot about the singer’s state of mind, separated from her lover. But like so many ‘Do you remember where you were when xxx died/happened?”, the song is a subtle tribute to the man who British musicians say has had the greatest influence on popular music.\n\nHappy Birthday Elvis – another wonderful Loudon Wainwright ditty. In which a fan of the King’s wishes him birthday greetings in a conspiratorial way. Official records show that Presley had a heart attack and passed away on August 16, 1977; but fans have always adamant that he actually faked his own death, so that he could enjoy a more relaxed life free of fame.\n\n(Sometimes I Feel Like) Fletcher Christian – “Fletcher Christian, born September 25, 1764, was a seaman and leading mutineer on HMS Bounty, under the command of William Bligh. Christian, a member of a family that had moved from the Isle of Man to Cumberland, England, had already served some years in the navy when, in 1787, he became master’s mate on the Bounty, a discovery ship sailing (December 23, 1787) from Spithead to the South Seas to collect breadfruit trees for the West Indies. The ship arrived in Tahiti on October 26, 1788, and remained more than five months, providing apparently an idyllic life for the crew. On April 4, 1789, it set sail for the West Indies. On the morning of April 28, Christian, at the head of 25 petty officers and seamen, seized the ship, reacting to the alleged tyranny and insults of Bligh. Bligh and 18 of the crew were set adrift in a lifeboat, and the mutineers attempted to establish themselves on Tubuai in the Austral Islands. That attempt was abandoned, and 16 crewmen who requested to return to Tahiti were permitted to do so. Christian and eight others, together with some Tahitian men and women (including Mauatua, who became Christian’s wife), sailed away, not to be heard of again until 1808, when a lone survivor (John Adams, who called himself Alexander Smith) and the mutineers’ descendants were found on Pitcairn Island. His story was that the group landed at Pitcairn (reportedly in 1790), stripped and burned the Bounty, but later fell out among themselves and with the Tahitians and were wiped out—Christian included.” Hot tip: Read the Mutiny on the Bounty…a bloody good true yarn.\n\nRambler- Whenever we returned to the US for visits from India, my dad’s employers would provide a Rambler American to use. I crisscrossed America at least twice in the back of a Rambler station wagon and learned how to drive in one. American Motors, the makers of the Rambler, were always the ‘poor cousin’ of the American auto industry but had and as Jim White points out, still has, a very loyal customer base.\n\nRikki Don’t Lose That Number – According to a 2006 interview with Entertainment Weekly, the Rikki of the title is Rikki Ducornet, a New York writer and artist. Steely Dan co-front Donald Fagen met her while both were attending Bard College, a small liberal arts school located in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. Ducornet said they met at a college party, and even though she was both pregnant and married at the time, he gave her his number, although not in the same context"
