        "text": "As long as there’ve been confessional songwriters, there have been divorce records.\n\nBob Dylan’s “Blood on the Tracks.” Marvin Gaye’s “Here, My Dear.” “Devotion and Doubt” by Richard Buckner. The explosive “Shoot Out the Lights” by Richard and Linda Thompson. Oh, yeah, and a little pop record from Fleetwood Mac called “Rumours” that has reportedly sold more than 40 million copies around the world.\n\nIt shouldn’t be shocking that many of these records are career highlights. These are albums where the artist is at his or her most personal. It’s a rare honest glimpse into their lives, and the vocals tend to be more primal.\n\nThe Kickback leader Billy Yost was going through an emotionally draining divorce while penning the material that became the recently released second album, “Weddings & Funerals,\" for the band that formed in Vermillion and now is based in Chicago. Somewhat surprisingly, Yost says the main influence on these tracks was a “Frank Sinatra record called ‘Watertown,’ \" he said.\n\n\"It’s a concept record he did about a dude who comes home and his wife and kids are just like, ‘We’re out. We can’t do this anymore.’ I listened to that record a lot. Our first record has songs about growing up or whatever. There’s songs about steroid abuse in professional wrestling. There’s a lot of weird one-off stuff.\n\n\"This record is definitely a lot more grounded in one particular thing.”\n\nYet “Weddings & Funerals” is not a depressing record. In fact, it may be the poppiest record you’ll hear this year, with almost every song full of hooks and hooks. Yost says that was the main goal for the album. “It’s still a record you could turn on at a party and be OK. I don’t think it’s going to drag everybody down. I was sort of hoping to write about the saddest thing I’ve ever been through but with the hardest backbeat behind it possible. I’m hoping it can be a sad thing that people want to sing along to.”\n\nQuestion: The last time we talked, the first album, “Sorry All Over the Place,” had finally come out after two years of waiting. Looking back, how much had the band changed between the 2013 recording sessions and the 2015 release?\n\nAnswer: Right after we had got done making that first record, I think I had finally figured out what I was supposed to be doing musically in the world. I think the first record touches on that, but I finally realized that, like, giving in to all of the oldies radio that I grew up with and just brutalizing people with hooks after hooks is kind of my strong suit, for better or worse. And that I should try to, at least for a record, see how much melody I could pollute 30 minutes of music with.\n\nQ: Was it weird at times playing these songs that you have lived with for so long but the audiences believed were new tunes?\n\nA: Yeah. As you can understand, some of those songs had been around for four or five years. A couple of those songs I had written even before I moved to Chicago. So it’s a weird sort of dual head space you have to maintain. You had to find new stuff to be excited about in the song because most people you were playing the songs for had never heard them before. That’s an awkward sort of dance to do, but you’re ripping people off if you’re not going to give them the best possible version of the song if they’ve never heard it before.\n\nQ: You also said back then that you were already working on new material. I’m assuming those are the tracks that are on this new record, “Weddings & Funerals.”\n\nA: Yeah. I think I wound up sending (producer) Dennis (Herring) about 30 tunes. You always read about U2 or the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the Rolling Stone interviews saying that “we had 30 ideas”, and you never secretly believed that that was even humanly possible. I guess in my case, Dennis just kept saying “what do you got.” It was frustrating because I couldn’t tell if he liked what I was sending. He just kept wanting more. At least in that little period of time I was capable of kicking out quite a bit of stuff.\n\nQ: You have stated in the past that the band tends to spend way too much time on “small parts of a 3½ minute song.” Is that still the case?\n\nA: That’s a tough question. All the new stuff is basically a first-time demo in the basement, and I’d do maybe two vocal passes tops. You know, just trying to capture the idea. When it comes to playing the stuff live again, we will still sit on a drum fill that all of us firmly believe is ruining a song until we figure out the three-note pattern that it needs to be. So we still definitely get sucked into the minutiae, but having to make so much in such a short period of time was so revealing to me. Especially figuring out what master you have to serve. In this case, I wanted melody, and that’s either there or it’s not in most cases. It’s not like a rhythmic thing. You either have a killer melody, or you don’t.\n\nQ: So you have all of these songs, but you still have to get the label’s approval to record. How hard did you have to push to make this record?\n\nA: Fortunately, our label is pretty artist-minded. They don’t even own our masters. We were anxious to work with somebody who had a more long-term vision in mind and not a vision where you became an indentured servant for the rest of your life. They were ready, and they were excited that we were ready to go. I had gone through a divorce, and it was nasty. It was terrible, but we got a lot of songs out of it, and we were ready to go. And they were ready to go when we were ready to start pushing. Everything just kind of came together in what I think was an appropriate timeline. We certainly didn’t have to sit on it for two years, which is great for everybody involved.\n\nQ: How did producer Dennis Herring become involved?\n\nA: I had been a fan from afar. When I hear something I like, I start looking at the liner notes and stuff. A lot of my brothers had been big fans of the Cracker records he did, so I heard Cracker a lot growing up. If you look at his discography, it’s really weird. It’s just a lot of really disparate stuff, and he’s kind of found a way to evolve as music has changed over the years, which I’ve always kind of admired. In 2012 (I think), we had talked via email. He was into the songs, so I took a Greyhound bus from Chicago to Oxford, Miss. We spent the 4th of July together, and he was like, “Play me every song that you have on guitar.” I played him every song and walked out of there with this handshake agreement that we were going to make a record. Dennis has a little bit of a reputation in the music business as a little bit of an evil genius, and a lot of people he works with have spoken very vocally about not working with him again. In our case, the first record we thought we were going to do with him ended up not happening, and I was pretty upset about it. We lost touch for a couple of years, but I was asked to write a song for this thing that wound up being in a movie. I sent him the song, saying, “Dennis, I know we haven’t talked for awhile, but I need some feedback on this.” Dennis heard that tune about a year and a half ago and then came to see us play in L.A. I think he decided it was time to do the first record he was supposed to do, but it turned out to be our second record.\n\nQ: How does his process of recording differ from ‘Sorry All Over the Place” producer Jim Eno?\n\nA: I’m not sure if it could be more different. Jim is maybe one of the nicest people I’ve ever met in my life. Jim will work feverishly to get the most sonically pure sound that you can and will make this great-sounding thing. Dennis will inflict whatever he thinks is appropriate for what he thinks the song needs. Working with Jim was all about making sure everybody was cool with everything. Dennis really didn’t care, and he let you know that going in. That’s part of the reason why I was excited to work with Dennis. I don’t know if it’s because of growing up with all of these brothers, but I think I thrive on conflict. I wanted somebody who would challenge me and not just be OK with something. Whereas Jim was all about what was good for the group was best for the song, and all about getting that “band in the room” sound, Dennis takes a sound and pulverizes it and makes it ugly. It doesn’t matter if it’s in tune or not; if it’s got the vibe that he wants, that’s what we’re rolling with. I’d make a record with either of them again, for sure, but it’s two real different schools of thought.\n\nQ: You told Billboard that the first single off the record, “Will T,” actually dates back to your teens. Why did you pull that tune out of the archives?\n\nA: I still remember tracking that song back then. My parents had this new iMac that came with this new program called Garageband on it. I was really excited. I had watched Mike Dresch run ProTools and was positive I’d never have the smarts to run that in my whole entire life. It was too technical, so I was really excited about this thing that was as dumb as I was. I remember working on that song in my parent’s basement, and it just kind of always hung around. If I played a solo show, it was an easy song to pull out. It’s a dumb song, musically. I don’t know why it came up again, but there was something about getting divorced that made me revisit this song. It’s about being scared to get into a relationship because you were scared there was something wrong with you. To revisit that from the other side of having gone through a whole relationship cycle was sort of gross but funny to me. It just seemed to be the right song to go back to at that moment in time.\n\nQ: One of the tracks, “False Jeopardy,” is part of the big Lily Collins/Rebekah Kennedy Netflix movie, “To the Bone.” How did that come about?\n\nA: Chris Douridas, who is a DJ in L.A., had asked us if we had any stuff lying around because he had a project he was working on. I looked up this guy’s name, and he had done the soundtrack to “Grosse Pointe Blank.” He was a consultant on that. I loved that movie so much, and the music is such an integral part. There’s so much good Joe Strummer stuff on that record. So I was just crazy to work with this guy in some capacity. I worked up this song and sent it to my brother Danny, who punched it up and threw a little bit of synth on it. We kind of sent the demo into the ether and never really heard anything back on it. All of a sudden we got a clip of a movie with the song playing over the top of it, and it was just nuts. It’s our first real taste of anything like that. It’s still kind of surreal. It happens right out of the gate in the movie, and they play the song for like a full minute. We got real lucky.\n\nQ: What’s the plan for fall and winter?\n\nA: Yeah, we’ve been out for quite awhile. We’re still waiting to hear about our next big run of shows. My birthday is Oct. 16, and I would assume I’m not going to see that in Chicago. We’re running pretty hard right now.\n\nQ: As you tour this record, are you repeating the process that led to it by working on new songs?\n\nA: There’s a lot of acoustic lines on phone memos. This record was made in kind of an emotional outburst, so I’m a little interested to see how this next one’s going to work out. I’m really hoping there’s not something to trigger the record No. 3. I’m just working on little pieces right now, so we’ll see what happens once we stop for a minute.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Kickback all-ages concert with Heatwarmer and Tenenbaums\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: Icon Lounge, 402 N. Main Ave.\n\nTickets: $10 in advance; $12 at the door"
