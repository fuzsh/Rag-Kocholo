        "text": "Though its sound is dark and austere, there is something bottomlessly reassuring about Fashionably Late, British singer Linda Thompson's first album in 17 years. Despite itself, every moment testifies to the unlikely persistence of connection.\n\nPut it into your stereo, press play and hear new recordings of Thompson's voice, once called one of contemporary music's greatest, purest instruments by Rolling Stone and folk cultists alike. Better yet, tonight in Toronto, you can listen in person.\n\nFor anyone who ever felt a hush fall over the Earth as those black-diamond tones rang out on her revered 1970s albums with ex-husband Richard Thompson, this is like going out one day to find a dead relative sipping lemonade in the backyard. It was not supposed to happen. Richard's following had only grown in the meantime, with his cynical wit and supernatural guitar prowess. But Linda? She was gone, gone, gone.\n\nThompson's retirement was never her choice. For a decade and a half after the release of her first solo album, One Clear Moment, in 1985, Thompson suffered \"hysterical dysphonia.\" It seemed to be a giant case of stage fright: Her vocal cords seized up and left her unable to sing a note; at times, she was unable even to speak.\n\nAnd so she settled into a comfortable London life with new husband Steve Kenis, travelled, raised her children, invested in a Bond Street antique-jewellery stall and took advantage of her escape from her ex's long shadow by starting to write songs, but for other people to sing.\n\nFew who saw Thompson the last time she headlined a North American tour, with Richard in 1982, would begrudge her leisure. Right before they set out, Richard revealed his infidelity with Nancy Covey (now his wife) and broke up with her -- after Thompson had gone along with Richard's conversion to Sufi Islam and spent years living in an impoverished commune. (She held on to her London apartment in secret.)\n\nThe slash-and-bleed tunes on their now-classic Shoot Out the Lights album all seemed to describe the situation, and the stage performances were musical heaven and personal hell, powered by alcohol and verging on physical violence. Witnesses say it was like divorce as a performance art.\n\nThough it seems voyeuristic to dredge up that history today, when Thompson suddenly fell \"hysterically\" silent, the world assumed it was a delayed reaction to the breakup, as if the muse had not survived the loss of her patron artist. After the anguish on stage, even those who gave her more credit found such conclusions irresistible.\n\n\"Here's to the dream that went awry/ Here's to the tears that I could not cry,\" she sings on Fashionably Late's final track, Dear Old Man of Mine, surely one of the most unflinching, yet affectionate, songs to an ex-spouse ever recorded, especially by a woman in a happy second marriage. Kenis must be a very reasonable soul.\n\nIn fact, Thompson's history frames the album, since the opening song features Richard singing and playing along. He had been playing Dear Mary with its co-writer, the ex-couple's musician son Teddy, who told her Richard had written an exquisite guitar part. So, as Thompson told me by telephone, she called Richard up and asked him to drop by the session. His rippling lines sound like 20 years of water washing under the bridge.\n\nIn her wry, British way -- a pleasant surprise from a singer so synonymous with musical intensity -- Thompson's story also communicates that contact with Richard was no big deal. Obviously, they've been back in touch for a while; fade out the messy flashbacks, the melodrama's over.\n\nThompson's dry, realistic wit also makes it hard to believe her voice problems came from mental imbalance. Doctors now say dysphonia is not psychosomatic but neurological, or at least a combination of the two. And her cure wasn't reconciliation with Richard, but a push from an old friend: David Thomas, lead singer of American avant-rock band Pere Ubu, who had collaborated with Richard in the past.\n\nIn 1999, Thomas sat down at her kitchen table and refused to budge until she agreed to appear in his musical-theatre experiment, Mirror Man. \"I wish I could be as autocratic as David,\" she said, laughing. So she sang with Thomas's production in London, New York and at Quebec's Victoriaville new-music festival. \"We were staying in the most flea-bitten motel,\" she recalled. \"It was straight out of a sideshow movie.\"\n\nThe mix of British folk-revival diva and art-punk avatar seems improbable, but that was the trick: \"It's because he's the antithesis of me. I can't think of two artists who are so different,\" she says. \"He's so esoteric and so quirky.\" Was it the change of musical habit that helped her open up vocally? \"Absolutely -- nobody's ever asked that before. Yes, it's a much freer environment and, of course, it's 'The David Thomas Show,' so if it stinks, it's not my fault.\"\n\nThe other remedy was a periodic injection of Botox, the paralyzing toxin that's become high society's snake oil against wrinkles, but which Thompson uses to stop throat convulsions. (Finally, cosmetics makes a real contribution to humanity.)\n\nHer voice is certainly wrinkle-free on Fashionably Late. \"In some ways,\" she said, \"I feel it's better, because there's a little more experience: I'm not so scared of singing in falsetto or making a fool of myself. Though you can never quite have the clarity and physical acuity than you have when you're in your 20s.\"\n\nIt does seem richer, I said, but no less fluid. She laughed. \"I'm usually very harsh on myself. But I thought on the new one there was just more, kind of, soul. People are free to disagree. Send your comments on a postcard -- to Linda Rondstadt.\"\n\nAs for personal regimen: \"I try not to speak during the day too much -- present company excepted -- and that's all. And try to get a bit of exercise. I'm not going to give up putting milk in my coffee.\"\n\nAnother circle closes with this album's return to the traditional ballad style the Thompsons championed in their start with folk-rock band Fairport Convention. \"It's really the way I like to write. The poppy stuff isn't really me,\" she said.\n\n\"I suppose I made more money on that stupid album with too much reverb on it [ One Clear Moment] but I like everything to be quite spare and that way it never quite gets dated.\"\n\nThe antiquated mode distances her from her soap-opera history, and lets her tap something bigger and older. \"I just about stopped myself from putting 'methinks' into songs. I love that old-time syntax.\" The language lets her relate her experience through metaphor, as in On the Banks of the Clyde, a lament sung by a whore.\n\n\"Literally, I wasn't a prostitute,\" she said. \"But everybody's a hooker in one way or another. Everybody has their price, except for some really, really special people, about five of them. We all do things that we shouldn't do for material gain.\" When I asked for an example, she laughed again. \"How long have you got? Everything from going out with people to telling lies to plagiarizing ideas.\"\n\nYet Fashionably Late seems free of compromise, from writing to casting, including Fairport-era comrades such as Martin Carthy, and his fiddler daughter Eliza, as well as Teddy Thompson as co-writer and musical director, his sister Kamila on harmonies, and cameos by their Canadian counterparts, Rufus and Martha Wainwright -- progeny of dysfunctional folk couple Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle.\n\nThompson's co-write with Teddy's close friend Rufus, Paint and Powdered Beauty, abandons the Celtic lilt for a vaudevillian lope that summons up Thompson's nearer ancestry, a mother and grandmother who worked variety shows, as well as the younger Wainwright's signature camp theatrics.\n\n\"I've known Rufus since he was born,\" she said. \"His mother and I are quite similar, and I think Loudon and Richard are quite similar, so there's a lot going on there -- more than you think. Our kids certainly share a lot musically. I think it's less difficult for Rufus and Martha. My kids aren't so brought up to it. Kamila's never been on the road before, Teddy's very knowledgeable, it's in the blood, but I don't know that he loves [folk]as much as I do. It doesn't show up in his own stuff.\"\n\nOn this tour, both her children are accompanying her on the road. \"But I'm not letting them sing any leads,\" she specified. \"What am I, crazy?\"\n\nNot at all. Startlingly sane, given the public muck she's gone through. Not only a remarkable comeback, Thompson's new music stands as evidence that no matter how much acid is poured over the bonds we've made, they never disappear; they stay strung across the footpaths of our lives, radiant, however threadbare. Linda Thompson, with Teddy Thompson opening, is in Toronto tonight at the Phoenix."
