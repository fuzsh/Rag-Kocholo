        "text": "When I first did this project eight years ago, I was single. I had plenty of time. The last time I did this project three years ago, my wife asked, \"Never again.\"\n\nSo naturally, with a newborn, I told my wife, \"Honey, I think I'm doing the alumni bracket again!\" Her response wasn't suitable for print.\n\nBut with folks picking their NCAA tournament brackets by color, mascot, dumb luck or actual analysis, why not pick schools based on which ones have the best celebrity alumni?\n\nWhen we ran this tournament last time, Maryland rode the Larry David wave to the title. Well, the Terrapins didn't make the cut this year. So we'll have a new champion.\n\nAlumni for each of the 68 schools in this year's NCAA tournament have been researched, with the term alumni being used loosely. If there's proof of attendance, it'll play.\n\nSo here is this year's IndyStar NCAA tournament celebrity alumni bracket\n\nSOUTH\n\nVIRGINIA (1) VS. UMBC (16)\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nTina Fey\n\nKatie Couric\n\nEdgar Allan Poe\n\nBoyd Tinsley\n\nDylan Walsh\n\nOne of the funniest women in the industry, Fey was fantastic on \"Saturday Night Live\"'s Weekend Update and NBC's \"30 Rock\", which she created. She also created \"Mean Girls\", which holds personal significance to me because I proposed to my wife while she was watching it. (I wrote the book on romance.)&mldr; Couric enjoyed a 15-year run on NBC's \"Today\" show, and one of her most recent noteworthy interviews provided plenty of fodder for the aforementioned Fey (see: Palin, Sarah)&mldr; Born and raised in Charlottesville, Tinsley attended UVA and was asked by Dave Matthews in 1991 to play violin for “Tripping Billies.” More than 60 million albums sold later, Tinsley remained with DMB until last month, tweeting he was taking a break from the band to focus on his family and health&mldr; At UVA to study ancient and modern languages, Poe attended the school in just its second year of existence (1826). A poet and author, Poe's work was often steeped in mystery and darkness, like his most notable works, \"The Raven\" and \"The Tell-Tale Heart\"&mldr; Known for his role as Dr. Sean McNamara on FX's \"Nip/Tuck\", Walsh also played the lead in the film adaptation of Michael Crichton’s book “Congo”. He starred alongside Mel Gibson in the Vietnam film “We Were Soldiers.”\n\nUMBC\n\nKathleen Turner\n\nDuff Goldman\n\nBrian Dannelly\n\nJonathan Schaech\n\nTony Harris\n\nTurner earned a degree in fine arts from UMBC in 1977, the same year she made her TV debut in the NBC soap opera “The Doctors.” She’s known for her role opposite Michael Douglas in “Romancing the Stone” (1984) and “Peggy Sue Got Married” (1986).

A TV news crew joined Ryan on the trip that ended with an ambush at the airport and Ryan dead on the runway&mldr; Ricketts founded TD Ameritrade and is worth more than $2 billion. He owns the Chicago Cubs, but lets his kids run the show. Under their watch in 2016, the Cubs won their first World Series since 1908.\n\nKANSAS STATE\n\nEric Stonestreet\n\nErin Brockovich\n\nKirstie Alley\n\nGene Keady\n\nSean Lowe\n\nStonestreet has won two Emmy Awards for his role as Cam on ABC sitcom \"Modern Family.\" A Kansas City native, he graduated from KSU with a degree in sociology in 1996...

A seven-time Big Ten Coach of the Year, Keady went 512-270 (.655) in 25 seasons in West Lafayette... Lowe, a former Kansas State football player, was “The Bachelor” after finishing third on “The Bachelorette” the year before. While I tell people my wife made me watch his season, in reality, I wanted to. And I was rewarded because SEAN FOUND LOVE. He fell for Catherine and the two got married and are expecting their second child. He appeared on “Dancing With The Stars” and didn’t last very long. That, I don’t watch.\n\nWho wins: Erin Brockovich's next environmental cause will likely be Gene Keady's hair. We'll look into it in Round 2. Kansas State.\n\nKENTUCKY (5) VS. DAVIDSON (12)\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nAshley Judd\n\nPat Riley\n\nFrank Vogel\n\nGlenn Kotche\n\nJohn T. Scopes\n\nA Division III point guard and starter at Juniata College in central Pennsylvania, Vogel gave up playing to transfer to Kentucky and become a student manager under Rick Pitino. He's the Pacers' all-time leader in NBA coaching wins, but was not retained following the 2016 season. He landed on his feet in Orlando, but the Magic have struggled going 49-100 under Vogel&mldr; The Wildcats' Super Fan and former Mrs. Dario Franchitti, Judd is usually front and center if Kentucky's in a big game. Truth be told, she hasn't really done much in terms of Hollywood success in the past decade, but she's been active humanitarian work and even been suggested for a political run&mldr; Drafted in both the NBA and NFL drafts, Riley stuck with basketball and while his playing career was for the lack of a better term, \"meh.\" he turned into one of the game's top coaches. winning titles with the Showtime Lakers and the Miami Heat.

The trial drew national publicity, but Scopes' guilty verdict and $100 fine were later overturned due to a technicality&mldr;\n\nDAVIDSON\n\nSteph Curry\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\nPatricia Cornwell\n\nLunsford Richardson\n\nTony Snow\n\nDavidson's all-time leading scorer, Curry was a phenomenon in college, showing the deft 3-point touch his father Dell displayed in the NBA for 16 seasons. But Curry is doing things in the league his dad never dreamed of. He won back-to-back MVP awards and led Golden State to the 2015 and 2017 NBA titles&mldr;The 28th U.S. President, Wilson is mostly associated with Princeton University, but he began his college career at Davidson in 1873. .. A popular crime novelist, Cornwell has sold more than 100 copies of her books, highlighted by the Kay Scarpetta series&mldr; Have a bad cough, get some Vicks VapoRub. Richardson invited the stuff and founded Vicks after he graduated with the highest honors from Davidson with a degree in latin. Useful&mldr; The third White House press secretary under George W. Bush, Snow was also the president's chief speech writer.\n\nWho wins: Ashley Judd may be the president of the UK fan club, but Woodrow Wilson was actually president. Davidson.\n\nARIZONA (4) VS. BUFFALO (13)\n\nARIZONA\n\nGeraldo Rivera\n\nKristen Wiig\n\nCraig T. Nelson\n\nGreg Kinnear\n\nSavannah Guthrie\n\nA \"Saturday Night Live\" alum, Wiig's star rose after the success of the comedy \"Bridesmaids.\" She also featured in the all-female remake of \"Ghostbusters\" in 2016&mldr; A longtime talk show host and reporter, Rivera is still popping up on Fox News. He was great on “Celebrity Apprentice” so he’ll be an awesome 46th president&mldr; Nelson was a \"Coach\" for all of us. Plus, his role as Zeke on NBC's \"Parenthood\" often brought my wife to tears, so I've got no choice&mldr; Kinnear, born in Logansport, Ind., graduated from UA with a broadcast journalism degree. He was the first host of E!’s “Talk Soup,” which he hilariously hosted from 1991-95. He was nominated for a best supporting actor role for “As Good as it Gets” in 1997. He’s played John F. Kennedy and Dick Vermeil... Guthrie graduated from Tucson cum laude with a degree in journalism. She’s been NBC’s “Today” co-anchor since 2012.\n\nBUFFALO\n\nWolf Blitzer\n\nHarvey Weinstein\n\nJames Foley\n\nJohn Walsh\n\nJeffrey Wigand\n\nThe son of Holocaust survivors, Blitzer was raised in Buffalo and stayed there for his undergrad work. After his distinguished work covering the Middle East, Blitzer joined CNN in 1990 and has become the face of the network&mldr; The co-founder of Miramax films, Weinstein and his brother, Bob, got their start producing rock concerts in Buffalo before getting in the movie business.

Great movie, which also features my great cousin Christopher Plummer (true story) as Mike Wallace.\n\nWho wins: Wildcats in a walkover. Arizona.\n\nMIAMI (6) VS. LOYOLA-CHICAGO (11)\n\nMIAMI\n\nDwayne Johnson\n\nRay Liotta\n\nSylvester Stallone\n\nJoseph Mascolo\n\nGloria Estefan\n\nJohnson, Stallone and Liotta give us some testosterone star power on the front end. Johnson, formerly The Rock, played football for Miami, winning a national title in 1991. He turned to wrestling and became a star&mldr; and a New York Times best-selling author. He made the crossover to film and has been one of Hollywood’s leading men the past decade. They’ll be rolling him out for “The Fast and the Furious 53” in no time&mldr; Liotta, who will forever be remembered for his role as Henry Hill in “Goodfellas.” Personal Liotta favorites of mine include 1994’s “No Escape” and “Cop Land” in 1997&mldr; Stallone attended, but never graduated from Miami, but he was awarded a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1999. He gave us “Rocky,” “Rambo,” “Cliffhanger” and “Don’t Stop or my Mom Will Shoot.” The range&mldr; If you ever stayed home sick from school, then you likely know of Stefano DiMera, the villain in NBC soap opera “Days of Our Lives.” Mascolo played the role from 1982 to until his death with 2016, though DiMera was resurrected, so we might not have seen the last of Mascolo&mldr; The lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine, Estefan graduated from Miami in 1979 with a degree in psychology. She’s sold more than 100 million records worldwide and won three Grammy Awards.\n\nLOYALA-CHICAGO\n\nBob Newhart\n\nLori Greiner\n\nLeslie David Baker\n\nJim O’Heir\n\nBill Rancic\n\nA comedian and actor many millennials may not know, fewer were funnier than Newhart. This generation may know him from the Will Ferrell comedy “Elf” or his role as Professor Proton on “The Big Bang Theory.” But the “Bob Newhart Show” in the 70s and “Newhart” in the 80s were hilarious shows. Go find them on Netflix or Amazon or something&mldr; An inventor and entrepreneur, Greiner, aka the Queen of QVC, is worth roughly $50 million. A cast member on ABC’s “Shark Tank,” Greiner majored in communications at Loyola. Sticking with the business-themed reality shows, Rancic, a 1994 grad, won the first season of NBC’s reality series “The Apprentice.” You know Baker as “Stanley” from his role on “The Office.” A former special education teacher, Baker hit it big as Michael Scott’s office curmudgeon. In contrast, O’Heir played the office doofus in NBC’s “Parks and Recreation.” His role as underappreciated Jerry Gergich of the Pawnee Parks department is gold.\n\nWho wins: Loyola is sneaky good, and any other first round opponent may have been in trouble, but despite Jerry Gergich and Stanley Hudson's greatness, they are no match for Sly and The Rock. Miami.\n\nTENNESSEE (3) VS. WRIGHT STATE (14)\n\nTENNESSEE\n\nPeyton Manning\n\nDeanna Carter\n\nTamika Catchings\n\nPaul Finebaum\n\nDavid Keith\n\nNo. 18 will always be No. 1 around here. There’s no Lucas Oil Stadium without Manning and now there’s a statue outside to remind all of us. What’s next for Peyton? Apparently Fox and ESPN are bidding for his services&mldr; Carter I’m sure has written and recorded hundreds of other songs, but “Strawberry Wine” will always be the song I remember my sister jamming to on the way to school&mldr; Catchings was the Indiana Fever. She led the team to the 2012 WNBA title, won the 2011 WNBA MVP and won four Olympic gold medals. But her contributions went far beyond the court with herl foundation and camps for Indy’s youth. She works for Pacers Sports & Entertainment. That is when she’s not serving tea&mldr; Most people associate Finebaum with Alabama because of his Birmingham-based radio show and crazy call-in fans. But he’s actually a product of another SEC school. He’s the face of the SEC Network and an enjoyable ESPN personality&mldr; Keith played Jack Parkman in “Major League II” and also featured in the submarine flick “U-571.” He’s popped up in pretty much all the “Law and Orders” and “CSIs.”\n\nWRIGHT STATE\n\nEddie McClintock\n\nBrad Sherwood\n\nNicole Scherzinger\n\nRobert Pollard\n\nVitaly Potapenko\n\nScherzinger led the burlesque pop group Pussycat Dolls from 2003-2009. She won Buzz Aldrin’s season of “Dancing With the Stars” and has been a judge on “The X Factor” and “The Sing Off”&mldr; McClintock has made more than 45 guest appearances on more than 25 different shows. Who could forget his role as Guy By Pool in a 2000 episode of “Sex and the City?” He’s appeared in other sitcoms like “Friends,” “Spin City” and “Just Shoot Me!” He was a regular on SyFy’s “Warehouse 13,” which had a 64-episode run. An actor/comedian, Sherwood was a regular on the improv comedy show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” and often pops up on VH-1 shows “I Love the 70s,” “I Love The 80s,” “I Love the 90s,” you get the idea&mldr; Pollard is the founder, lead singer and only omnipresent member of Guided By Voices, a Dayton, Ohio indie rock band, which broke up a few times and has made up a few times... Potapenko spent a decade in the NBA after Cleveland drafted him No. 12 overall out of Wright State in 1996. He averaged 6.5 points and 4.5 rebounds a game, starting 189 of 610 games played. He spent the 2010-11 season as an assistant coach for the Pacers.\n\nWho wins: Wright State gave me fits. Rocky Top all day. Tennessee.\n\nNEVADA (7) VS. TEXAS (10)\n\nNEVADA\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nGabriel Damon\n\nCharley Douglas\n\nRon Toomer\n\nMills Lane\n\nDrafted to play baseball by the Cubs, Kaepernick chose Nevada and football and set records for the Wolfpack. He filled in for an injured Alex Smith in 2012 and led the 49ers to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994. He struggled to keep hold of the starter's job the next few seasons and begun taking a knee during the national anthem in protest of police brutality. He started a near-league-wide phenomenon, which has crossed into other sports nationwide. He went unsigned as a free agent after the 2016 season and hasn't played in the NFL since... Damon was a commercial child actor and appeared in “RoboCop 2” and “Newsies.” He voiced Littlefoot in the first “Land Before Time” and Little Nemo in a 1989 Japanese animated fantasy flick. So no, not as interesting as the fish. Douglas was a sound engineer for CBS Radio and eventually served in the Navy developing radar systems during World War II. He’s credited with creating the first laugh track. So, fans of “Friends,” he’s your MVP. Toomer used his mechanical engineering degree to build the world’s first upside down roller-coaster in 1974. How’s this for irony? The man who creates close to 100 roller coasters around the world suffers from motion sickness. He was also part of the design team of the Apollo spacecraft heat shield&mldr; “Let’s get it on!” Lane started each bout he refereed with his catchphrase, that eventually earned him a TV courtroom show. He was in the ring for the infamous “Bite Fight” between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in 1997. Lane’s legacy will last forever thanks to MTV’s “Celebrity Death Match.”\n\nTEXAS\n\nMatthew McConaughey\n\nWes Anderson\n\nOwen Wilson\n\nFarrah Fawcett\n\nRichard Linklater\n\nAlright, alright, alright. McConaughey graduated from UT in 1993 and can often be spotted on the sidelines of big Longhorns games. He met Linklater while in Austin and got his big break when Linklater cast him as David Wooderson in \"Dazed and Confused\". McConaughey won the 2013 best actor Oscar for his role in \"Dallas Buyers Club\", while Linklater was nominated this year for best director for the 12-year project \"Boyhood\"&mldr;A quirky filmmaker, Anderson has created such popular movies as \"Rushmore\", \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" and \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", which earned him an Oscar nomination. While at Texas, Anderson befriended Wilson, who has starred in a number of Anderson's films, including his first, \"Bottle Rocket\", which became an underground hit and launched their careers. Whether it's in \"Zoolander\", \"Wedding Crashers\" or \"Meet the Parents\", Wilson has done a good job making us laugh during the 2000s&mldr; I'm a little young to have had Fawcett's poster hanging in my bedroom, but an entire generation of men before me did. The star of \"Charlie's Angels\", Fawcett got her start in modeling after she was named among the campus' 10 most beautiful coeds. The rest as they say, is history.\n\nWho wins: Alright, alright, alright. Horns roll. Texas.\n\nCINCINNATI (2) VS. GEORGIA STATE (15)\n\nCINCINNATI\n\nOscar Robertson\n\nGeorge Clooney\n\nSandy Koufax\n\nUrban Meyer\n\nJoseph Strauss\n\nThe Big O starred at Cincinnati after leading Indy's Crispus Attucks to become the first all-black team to win a high school state title in the country in 1955. The king of the triple-double, Robertson was a 12-time NBA All-Star and is a no-brainer for the top basketball players of all-time&mldr; Clooney briefly attended UC after attending Northern Kentucky (1979-81), but did not graduate from either. He got his big break with NBC's hospital drama \"ER\" and has gone on to an Award-winning film career\"&mldr; Koufax, a Brooklyn native, walked-on to UC's freshman basketball team and in 1954 made the baseball team, striking out 51 batters in 31 innings. He returned east, tried out for a few teams, and was eventually signed by his hometown Dodgers. Koufax went on to become one of the most dominant pitchers in Major League Baseball history, winning three Cy Young Awards and two World Series MVPs&mldr; Already with three national championships to his credit, Meyer is staking claim as the best coach in the business. He played cornerback for the Bearcats while getting his degree in psychology and is building a dynasty at Ohio State&mldr; Strauss designed San Francisco’s iconic Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nGEORGIA STATE\n\nJulia Roberts\n\nLudacris\n\nDouglas Edwards\n\nCoy Bowles\n\nWilliam Duvall\n\nThe star of \"Pretty Woman\", Roberts was born and raised in suburban Atlanta and attended Georgia State but never graduated. She's one of the most successful and recognizable actresses in the world, and has one Oscar to her credit for her role as \"Erin Brockovich\"&mldr; Ludacris, aka Chris Bridges, is a chart-topping rapper who studied music management at GSU in the late 90s. In addition to rapping, Ludacris has also appeared in a number of films, including a recurring role in \"The Fast and Furious\" series. What are they on, No. 73?...

Cincinnati.\n\n► Second Round\n\nVirginia vs. Kansas State: \"30 Rock\" > \"Modern Family.\" Virginia.\n\nDavidson vs. Arizona: Wildcats empty the vault, get coached to a win. Arizona.\n\nMiami vs. Tennessee: Sorry, Peyton. Miami.\n\nTexas vs. Cincinnati: Bearcats left \"Dazed and Confused.\" Texas.\n\nSweet 16\n\nVirginia vs. Arizona: Always the bridesmaid never the bride? Not this time. Arizona.\n\nMiami vs. Texas: This one is no \"Cliffhanger.\" Miami.\n\nElite Eight\n\nMiami vs. Arizona: Despite how bad \"Rocky V\" was, the Hurricanes keep advancing. Miami.\n\nEAST\n\nPLAY-IN GAME: LIU-BROOKLYN (16) VS. RADFORD (16)\n\nLIU-BROOKLYN\n\nJohn Leguizamo\n\nJackee Harry\n\nDina Meyer\n\nLarry Doby\n\nNicholas Pileggi\n\nWe’ll also pull from LIU-Post, the other main campus of the LIU system. Hard to imagine one’s career getting any better than playing Luigi in “Super Mario Bros.” but Lequizamo has had quite the run. He’s starred in “Carlito’s Way” “Romeo + Juliet” and “Crash.” He recently appeared in Paramount Network’s miniseries “Waco.”&mldr; Jackee played Sandra in the 1980s sitcom “227” and Lisa in the WB comedy series “Sister, Sister.” She also featured alongside Rodney Dangerfield in the classic soccer flick “Ladybugs.” Meyer is best known for her role in “Starship Troopers” but also had starring roles in the “Saw” horror film series and “Star Trek: Nemesis.” Doby attended LIU on a basketball scholarship but signed to play baseball with the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League three months into his LIU stint.

One of country music's most successful artists, Keith has sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and received a honorary degree from 'Nova&mldr; While Keith had 20 No. 1 hits on the country music charts, Croce provided two songs that reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (\"Time in a Bottle\" and \"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\")&mldr; The King of the Flat Top, Long played 13 years for the Raiders in his Hall of Fame career before transitioning to TV as part of Fox's \"NFL Sunday\" crew.

He was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.\n\nWho wins: Tim Donaghy's crimes wouldn't have even made a footnote in \"Goodfellas\" or \"Casino.\" Upset alert, Cinderella moves on. LIU-Brooklyn.\n\nVIRGINIA TECH (8) VS. ALABAMA (9)\n\nVIRGINIA TECH\n\nHoda Kotb\n\nJaxson de Ville\n\nBruce Arians\n\nBruce Smith\n\nKen Pomeroy\n\nThe newest full-time co-anchor on NBC's \"Today,\" Kotb takes over for Matt Lauer, who was fired following inappropriate sexual behavior. She earned a degree in broadcast journalism in 1986 and delivered the keynote speech at the school's 2008 graduation. She and Kathie Lee Gifford often have a bit too much fun in the fourth hour of \"Today.\" ... Arians is a Colts fan favorite, having helped a young Peyton Manning early in his coaching career and then returning to Indy as Andrew Luck's offensive coordinator. Arians filled in more than capably for Chuck Pagano, while the Colts head coach was fighting leukemia. It earned him a head gig of his own in Arizona, where the coached the past five years before retiring after this past season... Pomeroy, or KenPom, is the new RPI, and no March Madness story would be complete with out his mention. When Pomeroy isn't devising new analytics for basketball coaches and fans to consume, he's teaching atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah... The original Jaguars mascot Jaxson de Ville, Curtis Dvorak began his career as Virginia Tech's Hokie. In most seasons Jaxson de Ville's antics are much more interesting than the on-field product. He retired in 2015... Smith holds the NFL record for career sacks with 200 and the former Buffalo Bills star still gives QBs nightmares. He was a first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Fame selection and was a big reason the Bills reached four straight Super Bowls.\n\nALABAMA\n\nJoe Namath\n\nJim Nabors\n\nHarper Lee\n\nSela Ward\n\nForrest Gump\n\nNamath quarterbacked the Crimson Tide to the 1964 national championship before heading to NYC to become \"Broadway Joe.\" A member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he backed up his Super Bowl III guarantee with an MVP performance leading the Jets past the Baltimore Colts. And yes, the man likes coats... Known for his role Gomer Pyle in \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" Nabors holds a special place in Hoosiers' hearts for singing \"Back Home Again In Indiana\" at the Indianapolis 500 from 1974 to 2010, and one last time in 2014... Lee won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize for \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" which I still haven't read... Ward was homecoming queen and a Crimson Tide cheerleader while double majoring in fine art and advertising.

Alabama.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA (5) VS. MURRAY STATE (12)\n\nWEST VIRGINIA\n\nPat McAfee\n\nSteve Harvey\n\nJerry West\n\nDon Knotts\n\nCheryl Hines\n\nMcAfee was a fan favorite in Indianapolis, despite the fact that he's the PUNTER! His work in the community and on social media with fans (and free agents) is unparalleled. Oh yeah, and he's a Pro Bowler. I mean, we liked him so much, we gave him a show!&mldr; Jerry West is the NBA logo. What else do you need to know?&mldr; The role of Larry David's wife isn't an easy one, but Hines nailed it. She starred opposite the neurotic comic in HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\", a role which earned her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She also attended Florida State and Central Florida Universities&mldr; Another Walk of Famer, Knotts was born in Morgantown and returned to WVU after serving in the U.S. Army during World War II. The perfect TV goof ball, his roles as Barney Fife (\"The Andy Griffith Show\") and Ralph Furley (\"Three's Company\") landed him at 27th on TV Guide's list of \"TV Stars of All-Time\"&mldr; Harvey and Ferrell, both born in West Virginia, attended the state's largest school, but also went elsewhere. Ferrell been acting since 1974, but we all know her as the housekeeper, Berta, on \"Two and a Half Men\". Harvey was among \"The Original Kings of Comedy\", had his own long-running sitcom and now hosts \"Family Feud\".\n\nMURRAY STATE\n\nW. Earl Brown\n\nPopeye Jones\n\nChrishell Stause\n\nChris Thile\n\nJude Deveraux\n\nHaving the internet rumor Jim Varney attended Murray State debunked by his family hurts the Racers’ case. With Ernest in tow, Murray State could have been a first-round upset candidate. Brown is best known for his role as Al Swearengen’s right-hand man Dan Dority in HBO’s “Deadwood.” You may also know him as Mary’s brother Warren in “Something About Mary.” A soap opera actress, Stause played Amanda Dillon on “All My Children” and Jordan Ridgeway on “Days of Our Lives.” She also featured on “The Young and the Restless.” Thile was party of the bluegrass acoustic trio Nickel Creek and became host of “A Prairie Home Companion,” a radio variety show that ran from 1974 to 2016 before being renamed “Live From Here.” Deveraux has written more than 40 romance novels that reached the New York Times’ Best Seller list. Her romantic stories range from post-Revolutionary America to time travel. Love knows no bounds.\n\nWho wins: I'm going to ask a second time just in case Steve Harvey has the envelope.

MARSHALL (13)\n\nWICHITA STATE\n\nBill Parcells\n\nDan and Frank Carney (founders of Pizza Hut)\n\nJoe Carter\n\nThe Big Show\n\nGary Burrell\n\nAfter transferring from Colgate, Parcells played linebacker for Wichita State, earning a degree in physical education. He was drafted but never played in the NFL. A two-time Super Bowl winning coach, Parcells was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013&mldr; I'm not much of a Pizza Hut guy, but original founders Dan and Frank Carney attended WSU. Heck, even Frank jumped ship for Papa John's&mldr; The Sporting News' College Player of the Year in 1981, Carter went No. 2 overall in the draft to the Cubs. He played with six MLB teams, most notably for the Blue Jays, where he's remembered for his Game 6 World Series-winning walk-off home run against the Phillies in 1993&mldr; Real name Paul Wight, The Big Show was a member of the Wichita State basketball team in the early 90s, but ended up transferring to Northern Oklahoma where he was all-conference. The 7-foot-1 giant is one of the WWE's most recognizable champions of the past 20 years&mldr; Burrell, the founder of global positioning system Garmin, got an electrical engineering degree from Wichita State, and is worth an estimated $1.67 billion.\n\nMARSHALL\n\nRandy Moss\n\nBilly Crystal\n\nConchata Farrell\n\nMark D'Antoni\n\nBrad Dourif\n\nA member of Pro Football Hall of Fame's most-recent induction class, Moss was a receiving revelation. His path to Marshall was a bit circuitous, but once he returned home to West Virginia, he rewrote the record books. He finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1997. Character concerns dropped him to No. 21 in the draft to Minnesota, where he thrived as a game-breaker. He holds the NFL single-season touchdown reception record (23 with New England in 2007) and is second on the all-time regular season TD reception list with 156... Manhattan-born Crystal attended Marshall on a baseball scholarship in 1965, but never played for the Thundering Herd because the team was suspended during his only year on campus. He left West Virginia to head back to New York and began his comedy career. He's hosted the Oscars nine times and starred in classic comedies \"City Slickers\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\" ... Farrell began her college career at West Virginia, but finished a degree in history from Marshall, where she made her first on-stage performance in 1969. She's been acting since 1974, but is best known for her role as Charlie's housekeeper Berta in \"Two and a Half Men.\" ... Huntington-born, Dourif attended Marshall before quitting school after Farrell talked him into an acting career. He was nominated for an Oscar for voicing Chucky in \"Child's Play\" in 1988. He won a Golden Globe for his role as Billy Bibbit in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" I'm rewatching \"Deadwood,\" so to me, he's Doc Cochran... D'Antoni won the 2005 NBA Coach of the Year for his turnaround job with Phoenix. He's bounced around since, coaching the Lakers and Knicks since, but now is in charge of Houston, which boasts the NBA's best record.\n\nWho wins: Headline – \"'City Slickers' star leads Herd to Round 2.' Marshall.\n\nPLAY-IN GAME: ST. BONAVENTURE (11) VS. UCLA (11)\n\nST. BONAVENTURE\n\nBob Lanier\n\nTed Marchibroda\n\nNeil Cavuto\n\nChuck Daly\n\nAdrian Wojnarowski\n\nA three-time All-American, Lanier led St. Bonaventure to the 1970 Final Four and was the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft. He was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992... Marchibroda played QB for the Bonnies, in fact, he was the final QB to ever play for the school, which cut football in 1951. He has the rare distinction as being the head coach for the Baltimore Colts (1975-79) and Indianapolis Colts (1992-95) in two different stints. He posted a 30-34 record in Indianapolis and led the Colts to the memorable 1995 AFC Championship Game in his final season... Wojnarowski, or simply Woj, is the don of NBA news breakers. ESPN got tired of watching of the 1991 St. Bonaventure graduate scoop their guys, and hired Woj from Yahoo! this past year... A 1980 graduate, Cavuto hosts three shows on Fox News/Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal called named him the best interviewer in business news four straight years... Daly spent one year at St. Bonaventure before transferring to Bloomsburg. He made his name coaching the Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys teams, culminating with back-to-back NBA titles in 1989 and 1990. He was also head coach for the first Dream Team, winning gold in Barcelona.\n\nUCLA\n\nJames Dean\n\nBen Stiller\n\nJames Franco\n\nTim Robbins\n\nJaleel White\n\nWe can call this squad \"Team Hollywood\", which you'd expect from a school based in L.A. And like you'd expect with most actors, a lot of them didn't finish college. Stiller lasted nine months as a UCLA film student before returning to New York, the Indiana-born Dean was enrolled at the school for a semester before dropping out and Franco, who would later play Dean in a biopic, left school after just one year&mldr; Robbins actually graduated from UCLA's Film School and starred in two of my all-time favorite films, \"Bull Durham\" and \"Shawshank Redemption\". He won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role in 2003's \"Mystic River\"&mldr; Another graduate, White is relevant for one reason, and one reason only: he played Steve Urkel in \"Family Matters\". Game over.\n\nWho wins: A few Woj bombs doesn't deter the Bruins. UCLA.\n\nFLORIDA (6) VS. UCLA (11)\n\nFLORIDA\n\nTim Tebow\n\nErin Andrews\n\nGregg Doyel\n\nStephen Root\n\nRobin Weisman\n\nTebow won the Heisman Trophy in 2007 and an NFL playoff game, but folks knew he wasn’t a long-term solution under center. So, he’s giving baseball a try, and after spending a year in the minors for the Mets, he’s in spring training with a chance to earn a spot&mldr; A member of Florida’s dance team, the Dazzlers, Andrews now co-hosts “Dancing With the Stars.” That, of course, is in addition to her sideline role with Fox&mldr; Doyel is an award-winning sports columnist for IndyStar and is probably tweeting about walking dogs right now&mldr; Root is an actor/comedian I remember most for his role as Milton Waddams in “Office Space.” Always put your name on your stapler. He was also great in “NewsRadio” – which was actually a pretty funny show&mldr; Weisman is the little lady in “Three Men and a Little Lady” — the classic 1990 comedy with Ted Danson, Steve Guttenburg and Tom Selleck. She also featured in TNT’s “Thunder in Paradise” with Hulk Hogan that I totally remember watching.\n\nWho wins: Tebow is big on redemption, but the Gators star gets Shawshanked. UCLA.\n\nTEXAS TECH (3) VS. STEPHEN F. AUSTIN (14)\n\nTEXAS TECH\n\nJohn Denver\n\nG.W. Bailey\n\nBrad Leland\n\nScott Pelley\n\nGeorge Eads\n\nDenver, wo studied architecture at Texas Tech, recorded roughly 300 songs and sold more than 33 million albums worldwide during his career.

AUSTIN\n\nWill Jennings\n\nDon Henley\n\nBum Phillips\n\nJeremiah Trotter\n\nJoseph W. Kennedy\n\nA member of the Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Jennings provided many slow dances with the \"Titanic\" theme song \"My Heart Will Go On\". My personal Jennings favorites are Steve Winwood's \"Higher Love\" and Eric Claption's \"Tears in Heaven\". Absolute classics&mldr; Jennings never wrote a song for The Eagles, but they did just fine without him. Henley, the drummer and co-vocalist for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, was ranked the 87th greatest singer of all-time by Rolling Stone. He also attended North Texas University&mldr; After serving as a marine in World War II, Phillips returned to his native Texas to play football at Stephen F. Austin. He had a lengthy coaching career, which included an 86-80 stint as an NFL head coach with the Oilers and Saints. His son, Wade, succeeded him in coaching&mldr; Trotter played 12 NFL seasons, which included three separate stints with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was named to four Pro Bowls between 2000-05&mldr; Born and raised in Nagadoches, Texas, Kennedy earned his bachelor's degree from his hometown school before graduate work at Kansas and Cal-Berkeley.

BUTLER (10)\n\nARKANSAS\n\nJerry Jones\n\nJimmy Johnson\n\nJohn Daly\n\nS. Rob Walton\n\nPat Summerall\n\nIt's a little more sports heavy than we'd like, but we doubt J. William Fulbright would do it for you. Jones, the Cowboys owner/general manager/sideline hype guy/coach?, was a co-captain and offensive lineman on the Razorbacks' 1964 national title team and is worth an estimated $4.2 billion&mldr; A teammate of Jones' at Arkansas, Johnson won his college pal two Super Bowls (1992-93) and restored the Cowboys' luster&mldr; More of a sideshow now, Daly sprung to prominence after winning the 1991 PGA Championship right here at Crooked Stick. He has a British Open trophy on his mantle as well, though his closet is full of zubaz pants meets grandma's basement couch&mldr; One of many in a long line of Razorback Waltons, Rob, the eldest son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, is the current chairman and worth about $41.7 billion, the 17th-richest person in the world&mldr; Summerall's voice was familiar to generations of sports fans and he and John Madden lasted 22 seasons in the broadcast booth.\n\nBUTLER\n\nGordon Hayward\n\nEd Carpenter\n\nJim Jones\n\nKaren Pence\n\nBobby Plump\n\nHayward brought the Bulldogs inches to within winning the national title in 2010. He turned himself into an NBA rising star in Utah before joining up with his former Butler coach Brad Stevens in Boston this past summer in free agency. Hayward suffered a season-ending injury in the Celtics’ season opener this season&mldr; Plump's Last Shot is more than a watering hole in Broad Ripple, it's the iconic moment of the Milan Miracle and the inspiration for \"Hoosiers\". After his 1954 state title winning exploits, Plump went on to star at Butler and played briefly professionally before going into insurance&mldr; Winner of back-to-back Indy 500 poles, Carpenter is still searching for his first IndyCar win at his hometown track. Carpenter, who owns his own racing team and doesn’t race a complete schedule himself, has three series driving wins to his credit&mldr; An infamous cult leader, Jones was responsible for the mass suicide of 909 people via cyanide poisoning at Jonestown, Guyana in 1978. He got his degree from Butler in secondary education by attending night school. Pence, the current Second Lady of the United States, has a bachelor’s and Master’s degree in education from Butler. She taught at Indianapolis elementary schools.\n\nWho wins: We'll go local, at least for one round. Butler.\n\nPURDUE (2) VS. CAL-STATE FULLERTON (15)\n\nPURDUE\n\nNeil Armstrong\n\nOrville Redenbacher\n\nChelsey Sullenberger\n\nJim Gaffigan\n\nDrew Brees\n\nThe first man to walk on the moon, Armstrong is pretty much that guy at the party that can one up you every time&mldr; At Purdue, Redenbacher competed in track, performed in marching band and graduated with a degree in agronomy. He developed his famous popcorn in Valparaiso, which still hosts an annual popcorn festival in Redenbacher's honor&mldr; r span as a coach with the Bruins, giving birth to the Wizard of Westwood legend&mldr; In 2001, Brees led Purdue to its last Rose Bowl appearance and shattered all sorts of school and Big Ten passing records. Despite concerns about his stature, Brees has developed into one of the NFL's premier passers. He’s led the league in passing yardage seven times, has made 11 Pro Bowls, and as you recall, defeated the Colts in Super Bowl XLIV&mldr; An Air-Force grad, Sullenberger got a Master's in Industrial Psychology from Purdue. He is known for piloting a 2009 US Airways flight to a successful water landing in the Hudson River... A Chesterton, Ind. native, Gaffigan attended Purdue for a year before transferring to Georgetown. He walked on to the Boilers football team. “I have so many fond memories from Purdue,” Gaffigan told a Purdue crowd in 2007. “Most seem to involve walking. I walked onto the football team and walked away after I didn't like getting my head bashed in. I remember walking to some classes that were, for some reason, at 7 a.m., walking to Hardee's at 11:30 at night, finally buying a bike, and then walking after it fell apart after two days. Go Boilers.”\n\nCAL-STATE FULLERTON\n\nKevin Costner\n\nGwen Stefani\n\nJames Cameron\n\nBruce Bowen\n\nCedric Ceballos\n\nA Fullerton native, Stefani hit it big with No Doubt's debut album \"Tragic Kingdom\" in 1995 as the band became an instant success. She went on her own for a bit and tried her hand in a few things before returning to the band in 2009. She was a judge on NBC's \"The Voice,\" which is pretty much on every night... Costner is basically the only general manager that can turn the Cleveland Browns around... Cameron, who directed \"Titanic,\" \"Terminator\" and \"Avatar,\" studied physics at Fullerton in 1973... A defensive specialist, Bowen won three NBA titles with the San Antonio Spurs and was first team All-Defense five times. He's currently an analyst for ESPN... Ceballos played 14 seasons in the NBA, won the Dunk Contest in 1992 and was an All-Star in 1995. He paired up with Shawn Marion on this past season's \"Amazing Race\" on CBS.\n\nWho wins: Neil Armstrong may have been to the moon, but Fullerton has the star power. Cal State Fullerton.\n\n► Second Round\n\nLIU-Brooklyn vs. Alabama: Broadway Joe has too much style for Brooklyn. Alabama.\n\nWest Virginia vs. Marshall: McAfee gives Thundering Herd the boot. West Virginia.\n\nUCLA vs. Texas Tech: \"Police Academy\" actors can only get you so far. UCLA.\n\nButler vs. Cal State Fullerton: \"Bull Durham\" or Bulldogs? Sorry, Blue. Cal State Fullerton.\n\n► Sweet 16\n\nAlabama vs. West Virginia: It's time to use The Logo as the trump card. Jerry West Virginia.\n\nUCLA vs. Cal State Fullerton: This is where \"Avatar\" catches up to Fullerton. UCLA.\n\n► Elite Eight\n\nUCLA vs. West Virginia: Don Knotts is cool, but we'll give the edge to James Dean. It's close though. UCLA.\n\nMIDWEST\n\nKANSAS (1) VS. PENN (16)\n\nKANSAS\n\nWilt Chamberlain\n\nPaul Rudd\n\nDon Johnson\n\nRob Riggle\n\nMandy Patinkin\n\nOne of the greatest basketball players of all-time, Chamberlain was a 4-time NBA MVP and led the NBA in scoring for seven straight seasons (1960-66). Oh yeah, he also led the league in rebounding 11 times&mldr; Crockett on \"Miami Vice\", Johnson owned the late 80s. I was a toddler then, so I know him as Kenny Powers' dad in \"Eastbound and Down\"&mldr; Part of the Judd Apatow Machine, Rudd has starred in comedies such as \"Anchorman\", \"The 40-Year Old Virgin\" and \"Knocked Up.” Riggle graduated from Kansas with a theater degree — and then naturally joined the Marines. He got his big break in comedy with his appearances on “The Daily Show” and has popped up in comedies like \"The Hangover,\" \"Stepbrothers\" and \"Talladega Nights.\" He hosted the 2012 ESPY's and picks games weekly on Fox's NFL Sunday pregame show... Patinkin plays Saul on Showtime's \"Homeland\" but he'll forever be Inigo Montoya.\n\nPENN\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElon Musk\n\nJohn Legend\n\nElizabeth Banks\n\nMaury Povich\n\nAfter starting college at Fordham University, Trump transferred to Penn's prestigious Wharton School of Business, where he learned some tricks to the real estate trade. He inherited an empire and turned his family name into a brand. After years hosting his reality TV show \"The Apprentice,\" Trump decided to run for president and to pretty much everyone's dismay won... Musk got a degree in physics and economics from Penn and has put them both to good use in business and science. I mean, the Tesla CEO just sent cars into space. He's looking to Mars next... Legend began attending Penn at 16 years old. He served as the school's musical director of a pop a cappella group. After years of collaborating with artists, Legend hit it big solo in 2013 with \"All of Me,\" which hit No. 1. He won an Oscar for the theme song for \"Selma\" in 2015... Banks, who graduated magna cum laude with a degree in communications in 1996, is best known for her roles in \"40-Year-Old Virgin\" and as Effie in \"The Hunger Games.\" ... \"You are not the father!\" Those five words are pretty much the key to Povich's career these days. A 1962 Penn grad, Povich's talk show has morphed into Jerry Springer light. And it always seems to be on in the newsroom in the background before folks can change the channel after the local news is through.\n\nWho wins: A really tough early-round matchup, but it comes down to the Dons and Penn trumps Kansas. Penn.\n\nSETON HALL (8) VS. NC STATE (9)\n\nSETON HALL\n\nBob Ley\n\nDule Hill\n\nDick Vitale\n\nMax Weinberg\n\nChuck Connors\n\nAn ESPN stalwart and New Jersey native, Ley, graduated magna cum laude with a degree in communications. He's been with ESPN since 1979 — three days after the network launched. A former \"SportsCenter\" host, Ley anchors the channel's more in-depth issues show \"Outside The Lines\"... Connors played on Seton Hall's baseball and basketball teams and is one of just 12 athletes to play in both MLB and NBA.

In '63, Vitale was finishing up his business administration degree from Seton Hall and took his first coaching job at New Jersey's Garfield High School. He had a successful four-year run at Detroit-Mercy, leading the Titans to the Sweet 16 in 1977 and coached the Pistons for a year and 12 games (he was fired in 1979 after a 4-8 start to the season). He went into broadcasting and his enthusiasm is credited with helping grow college basketball. In 2008, he was inducted into both the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame... I know Max Weinberg from his role as Conan O'Brien's drummer on late night TV. But most everyone else associates him with Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band... Hill played Charlie Young on NBC's \"West Wing\" and starred in USA Network's \"Psych.\" You may also know him as the Dolphins GM in HBO's \"Ballers.\"\n\nNORTH CAROLINA STATE\n\nBill Cowher\n\nZach Galifianakis\n\nPhilip Rivers\n\nJohn Tesh\n\nSpud Webb\n\nA linebacker and team MVP his senior year for the Wolfpack, Cowher was mostly a special teams player during his five-year NFL playing career. As a coach, Cowher led the Steelers to the Super Bowl title in 1995 and he retired with a 161-99-1 coaching record before joining CBS' football coverage&mldr; A Wilkesboro, N.C. native, Galifianakis attended, but didn't graduate from NC State. A comedian with bit roles early in his career, he gained fame for his role as Alan in \"The Hangover\" trilogy&mldr; A five-time Pro Bowl QB and agitator to Colts fans, Rivers has thrown for more 36,000 yards and 252 touchdowns in 11 NFL seasons&mldr; A former co-host of \"Entertainment Tonight\" and sportscaster, Tesh is also an accomplished pianist, who's greatest achievement was providing us \"Roundball Rock,\" better known as the NBA on NBC theme song in the 90s&mldr; At 5-6, Webb is a hero to all vertically-challenged folk after winning the 1986 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. He spent 12 seasons in the NBA, seven with Atlanta.\n\nWho wins: For all fellow 5-foot-nothings out there, this one is for Spud. N.C. State.\n\nCLEMSON (5) VS. NEW MEXICO STATE (12)\n\nCLEMSON\n\nNancy O’Dell\n\nJames Michael Tyler\n\nDale Davis\n\nDolph Lundgren\n\nNikki Haley\n\nMiss South Carolina in 1987, O’Dell graduated summa cum laude from Clemson in 1990 before embarking on a broadcast TV career. She hosted “Access Hollywood” from1996-2009 and has been the host of my mom’s favorite show “Entertainment Tonight” since 2011&mldr; Fans of “Friends” know Tyler as coffee shop worker Gunther. Over a 10-year run, Tyler appeared in 148 of 236 episodes, making him the show's most-frequent guest star&mldr; Folks around here have a soft spot for Davis, who is fifth all-time in minutes played for the Pacers. Davis holds the franchise record for career field goal percentage (.543) and only Mel Daniels has more career rebounds as a Pacer than Davis&mldr; Apparently a genius, Lundgren studied chemical engineering at a number of schools, including Washington State and Clemson. He could figure out the meaning of life, but he’ll always be Ivan Drago from “Rocky IV” — which to this day has the best film soundtrack ever. He gave us He-Man in “Masters of the Universe” and Frank Castle in 1989-version of “The Punisher,” but after that it was pretty much straight-to-video action flicks&mldr; The former governor of South Carolina, Haley now serves as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.\n\nNEW MEXICO STATE\n\nPaul Wilbur Klipsch\n\nLou Henson\n\nAlan Hale\n\nAlvy Ray Smith\n\nRich Beem\n\nBorn in Elkhart, Ind., Klipsch's family relocated to Texas after his father, whose father taught mechanical engineering at Purdue, died when Klipsch was 12. Klipsch attended NMSU and played in the school band before going to work for GE. He made great advances in speakers and the company that bears his name is closely tied to this city, with the Klipsch Music Center (formerly Deer Creek, Verizon) as well as celebrity endorsement deals with Andrew Luck and Roy Hibbert&mldr; A guard for the Aggies, Henson began his coaching career at a New Mexico high school before a lengthy and successful college coaching career. He led his alma mater from 1966-75 and 1997-2005, but it's his time at Illinois for which Henson is most remembered for. Illinois won the 1984 Big Ten title and advanced to the 1989 Final Four under Henson's guidance. He finished with 779 career wins and in 2014, was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame&mldr; Hale, who received his Ph.D. in astronomy from New Mexico State, co-discovered Comet Hale-Bopp with a telescope on his driveway. According to NASA, the comet was likely the most seen of the 20th century&mldr; Smith is the co-founder of Pixar, the animation studio that gave us \"Toy Story\" and \"Up\"&mldr; Beem conquered Tiger Woods to win the 2002 PGA Championship, but he hasn't won on the PGA Tour since.\n\nWho wins: You don't need Dolph Lundgren's brilliant mind to see this one is a rout. Clemson.\n\nAUBURN (4) VS. CHARLESTON (13)\n\nAUBURN\n\nCharles Barkley\n\nLionel Richie\n\nOctavia Spencer\n\nTim Cook\n\nJimmy Buffett\n\nAn 11-time NBA All-Star, Barkley was one of the best power forwards of the 1990s, despite only being 6-6. “The Round Mound of Rebound” and original Dream Team member has been one of the game’s more outspoken personalities, invading our TVs on TNT’s “Inside the NBA.” And who knows, he may run for governor of Alabama some day&mldr; Richie attended Auburn as a grad student briefly after earning his degree from Tuskegee. He joined the Commodores in 1968 and went solo in 1982. He is currently seen on E*Trade commercials trying to be coaxed into saying “All Night Long.” Buffett spent one year at Auburn – where it’s said he learned to play guitar – but transferred to Southern Miss. I’m not a Parrothead nor do I like cheeseburgers, but he’s got nine platinum albums and continues to sell out venues to middle-aged day-drinkers&mldr; Apple’s CEO, Cook graduated from Auburn with an industrial engineering degree before getting an MBA from Duke. An Alabama native, he joined Apple in 1998 and was COO under Steve Jobs, eventually taking over for Jobs in 2011&mldr; Spencer won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her role in “The Help” in 2011. She added Oscar nominations in each of the past two years for “Hidden Figures” and “The Shape of Water.”\n\nCOLLEGE OF CHARLESTON\n\nRobert Mills\n\nMatt Czuchry\n\nErick Avari\n\nThomas Gibson\n\nOrlando Jones\n\nBelieve to be the first American-born architect. Mills designed the Washington Monument as well as the Department of Treasury building. You’d recognize Avari if you saw him. From “Encino Man” to “The Mummy” and “Independence Day” to “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” Avari has been in a bunch of stuff. The 1998 Mr. College of Charleston pageant winner, Czuchry attended the school on a tennis scholarship. His most prominent acting roles include Logan in “Gilmore Girls” and Cary in “The Good Wife.” The Greg in the CBS sitcom “Dharma and Greg,” which had a five-season run, Gibson also starred in medical drama “Chicago Hope” and “Criminal Minds.” In 2010, he won an Entertainment Weekly online poll for Under-appreciated Entertainer of the Year for his role as Aaron Hotchner in “Criminal Minds.” Jones rose to prominence on MADtv and got a national 7 Up ad campaign. FX gave him his own late-night talk show (eight episodes). Jones’ notable roles include Clifford in football comedy “The Replacements,” Dr. Lee in “Drumline” and Harry Block in “Evolution.”\n\nWho wins: Charleston's group isn't turrrrible, but I'm working on an Apple laptop and I'd like it to keep working. Auburn.\n\nPLAY-IN GAME: ARIZONA STATE (11) VS. SYRACUSE (11)\n\nARIZONA STATE\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nPhil Mickelson\n\nDavid Spade\n\nBarry Bonds\n\nNick Nolte\n\nKimmel attended ASU for two years and was a noted caller into Phoenix radio shows before getting his own show. He went into television and went from co-hosting \"Win Ben Stein's\" money to hosting the Oscars in the span of 20 years... Mickelson is ninth all-time in PGA Tour wins (43), has won three Masters and picked up PGA Championship and British Open titles as well. Six runner-up finishes in the U.S Open leave him just short of the career grand slam... Spade graduated with a degree in business and got his comedic start in university comedy sketch shows. The perfect match for Chris Farley, the duo was great together on \"Saturday Night Live\" and feature film \"Tommy Boy.\" He was good in NBC's \"Just Shoot Me\" and CBS' \"Rule of Engagement\" and he'll forever be remembered as \"Joe Dirt.\" ... Nolte attended Arizona State on a football scholarship, but eventually lettered at Eastern Arizona. He had a good run in the early 90s with \"Blue Chips\", \"Cape Fear\" and \"Another 48 Hours.\" He's acted plenty lately, but I'm not sure if he's acting or if that's just Nick Nolte now... Bonds smashed baseball's most-hallowed record and still won't sniff Cooperstown for what seems to be a while. While at ASU, he led the Sun Devils to the College World Series.\n\nSYRACUSE\n\nTaye Diggs\n\nMegyn Kelly\n\nBob Costas\n\nVera Farmiga\n\nDick Clark\n\nMy wife would kill me if I didn't put him here. Diggs received a bachelor's of fine arts in musical theater from Syracuse and helped Stella get her groove back in his 1998 film debut. He starred as Dr. Bennett in \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Private Practice\" and currently features on Fox's \"Empire.\" And he probably follows you on Twitter... Kelly earned a political science degree from Syracuse in 1992 before pursuing a law degree and a law career. She transitioned to TV and over time became one of the faces of Fox News. She has since made the switch to NBC and has a daily talk show after \"Today.\" ... Clark started his radio career in 1945 after minoring in radio at Syracuse. His \"American Bandstand\" TV show was a cultural phenomenon, lasting from 1957 to 1987. He hosted the \"Pyramid\" game show, and I brought in many a new year with \"Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve.\" ... Farmiga was great in \"The Departed\" as Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon's love interest, and equally impressive alongside George Clooney in \"Up In The Air.\" ... For a school that churns out sports broadcasters left and right, Costas is in a class by himself. The nights he calls games on the MLB Network are always a treat.\n\nWho wins: Not even David Spade could hold the Sun Devils back. Arizona State.\n\nTCU (6) VS. ARIZONA STATE (11)\n\nTCU\n\nBob Schieffer\n\nChris Klein\n\nRod Roddy\n\nReverend Timothy Lovejoy\n\nSandra Brown\n\nA national politics reporter/anchor for CBS, Schieffer had a near 25-year run on \"60 Minutes\" and was moderator of \"Face the Nation\" from 1991-2015... Klein will always be known for his role as Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher from \"American Pie.\" He's been other movies, too. Like \"American Pie 2\" and \"American Reunion.\" ... \"Come on down! You're the next contestant on the \"Price is Right!\" Roddy was the show's announcer from 1986 until his death in 2003. He also announced the classic game show \"Press Your Luck.\" No whammy, no whammy... Lovejoy is minister at The First Church of Springfield on “The Simpsons” and attended TCU before moving to Springfield. Don't believe me? Google it... Brown has written more than 70 romance novels, including 50 New York Times best-sellers, though I must admit, I missed “Tempest in Eden” and “Where There’s Smoke.”\n\nWho wins: Kimmel preaches more these days than Lovejoy. Arizona State.\n\nMICHIGAN STATE (3) VS. BUCKNELL (14)\n\nMICHIGAN STATE\n\nMagic Johnson\n\nJames Caan\n\nTom Sizemore\n\nRobert Klark Graham\n\nJackie Martling\n\nA 12-time NBA All-Star, five-time NBA champion and three-time MVP, Johnson was the premier attraction for the Showtime Lakers of the 1980s. His rivalry with Larry Bird, which began in college and continued throughout their pro careers, became so legendary it got the Broadway treatment&mldr; Nominated for an Oscar for both his role as Brian Piccolo in \"Brian's Song\" and Sonny Corleone in \"The Godfather\", Caan didn't finish his schooling at MSU, but after being tortured by Kathy Bates in \"Misery\", we'll offer some leeway. An actor who peaked in the late 90s with roles in \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Heat\" and \"Natural Born Killers\", Sizemore has struggled with substance abuse and the law in recent years and appeared on VH1's \"Celebrity Rehab\"&mldr; Graham made a fortune by developing shatterproof plastic eyeglass lenses and founded a sperm bank for geniuses. The initial idea was to only accept donations from Nobel laureates, but there are only so many of those, so any genius will do. It lasted from 1980-99 with 218 children created via its process. Martling, aka Jackie the Joke Man, graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, but pursued singing instead. He found out he was a better comedian than musician and became a fixture and head writer on Howard Stern’s radio show from 1983-2001.\n\nBUCKNELL\n\nAlan Stillman\n\nEdward Herrmann\n\nChristy Mathewson\n\nLes Moonves\n\nGbenga Akinnagbe\n\nStillman opened the first T.G.I.Friday’s restaurant in New York in 1965 to meet girls. What started as one of NYC’s first singles bar turned into a chain of family -friendly restaurants with decent potato skins. Known for his role as Lorelai’s grandfather Richard Gilmore in “Gilmore Girls,” Hermmann also played Richard Rich alongside Macaulay Culkin in “Richie Rich.” Akinnagbe wrestled at Bucknell before playing Marlo’s deadly right-hand man Chris Partlow in HBO’s “The Wire.” And as you all know, “The Wire” trumps all. Moonves is the CEO and Chairman of the Board for CBS Corporation and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2013&mldr; One of the first five members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, Mathewson is considered one of the best pitchers in the history of the game. He was Bucknell class president before going on to a storied pro career with the New York Giants (1900-16). He is just one of two pitchers that rank in the top 10 for career ERA (2.13) and wins (373).\n\nWho wins: Any genius could tell you, Michigan State.\n\nRHODE ISLAND (7) VS. OKLAHOMA (10)\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nChristiane Amanpour\n\nLamar Odom\n\nMichael Flynn\n\nJ.T.

She now has her own news show, worked on \"60 Minutes\" for a decade and is an important international voice for CNN... A highly-decorated general turned disgraced Trump National Security Advisor, Flynn was fired by the White House and pleaded guilty to a felony count of lying to the FBI... Never really a leading man, Walsh was a great character actor. You know him from his roles as Lt. Col. Markinson in “A Few Good Men” and “Happy Kuykendall in “Blue Chips.” &mldr; After a controversial beginning to his college career at UNLV, Odom transferred to Rhode Island and led the Rams to the Atlantic 10 title in 1999 – his only season at Rhode Island. He was the fourth overall pick in the '99 draft by the Clippers and spent 14 seasons in the NBA, winning titles with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010. He's battled substance abuse and had a pretty public divorce with Khloe Kardashian, with whom he had reality TV show with, \"Khloe & Lamar.\" ... The creator of workout craze P90X, Horton gained an appreciation for fitness at a weightlifting class while at URI. He moved to California to try his hand at comedy, which is what it would look like if tried P90X.\n\nOKLAHOMA\n\nOlivia Munn\n\nBrian Bosworth\n\nEd Harris\n\nLarry Merchant\n\nMickey Mantle\n\nMunn should have felt at home in her role in HBO's \"Newsroom\" having earned a journalism degree from Oklahoma. She gained fame on \"Attack of the Show!\" and then spit in the eyes of those nerds who watched that show by dating star jock Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers and Munn broke up and he's currently dating Danica Patrick&mldr; A two-time All-American and Dick Butkus Award winner, \"The Boz\" was a phenomenon in the mid-80s, and thorn in the NCAA's side. He entered the NFL via the supplemental draft and was given the league's biggest rookie contract in history, 10 years for $11 million. He played just parts of three seasons in the pros and is considered among the biggest busts in draft history&mldr; A veteran actor, Harris is 67 — and my wife thinks he's \"super sexy.\" I don't know about all of that, but he was pretty darn good in \"The Rock\", \"Apollo 13\" and \"The Truman Show\"&mldr; Now seen as the cantankerous, overly&mldr; wait for it&mldr; still waiting&mldr; deliberate boxing analyst for HBO, Merchant is still one of the greatest boxing broadcasters of all-time, and he wasn't afraid to mix it up in his post-fight, in-ring interviews&mldr; A native of Spavinaw, Okla., the state school offered Mantle a football scholarship. He's widely considered one of the greatest baseball players in baseball, was named an All-Star 20 times and won seven World Series titles with the Yankees.\n\nWho wins: Sorry, Michael Flynn, but you could say the Sooners have this one... Locked up. Oklahoma.\n\nDUKE (2) VS. IONA (15)\n\nDUKE\n\nAdam Silver\n\nKen Jeong\n\nStephen Miller\n\nGranville Semmes\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nSilver, David Stern's successor, as NBA commissioner, is off to a good start. In 2015, he was one of Time's 100 Most Influential People and one of Fortune's 50 Greatest Leaders. And he’s bringing the All-Star Game to Indy, so he’s alright &mldr; &mldr; Jeong got his undergrad degree from Duke before getting an M.D. from North Carolina. You know him from NBC's \"Community\" and as Leslie Chow in \"The Hangover\" trilogy&mldr; Miller has shot to prominence as Donald Trump’s senior advisor and just might outlast everyone in the administration. Miller was a key voice in the conservative movement on Duke’s campus and worked on political campaigns before joining up with Jeff Sessions to push a new populism movement, which culminated with Trump’s election&mldr; Gates is in charge of giving away Bill Gates' money. The wife of the Microsoft billionaire is a noted philanthropist through her work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation… The founder of 1-800-FLOWERS, Semmes has made it simple for guys on-the-go, or those that forgot to stop on the way home, a chance to make it all OK.\n\nIONA\n\nDon McLean\n\nTommy Dreamer\n\nBud Cort\n\nJohn Gilchrist\n\nRichie Guerin\n\nAfter leaving Villanova, McLean returned to New York and attended night school at Iona, earning a degree in business administration.

He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013. Cort starred as Harold in the 1971 dark comedy “Harold and Maude.” Not a commercial success, the movie grew a cult following and is ranked among the top 50 funniest movies by the American Film Institute. He also featured in “MASH” – the movie not TV series. Dreamer, aka Thomas James Laughlin, is a pro wrestler, who is best known for his time in the ECW but also spent time in the WWE (2001-10, 2015). He was WWE Raw Hardcore Champion for 14 matches before losing the title in a unification bout with Rob Van Dam for the Intercontinental Championship in 2002 at Madison Square Garden.

In 1950, Hunter led NCC to the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association Tournament championship and was the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract when he signed with the Washington Capitals. He was cut in training camp and never played in the NBA, but went on to coach at Tennessee State for nine seasons and was the first black coach to lead the U.S. Olympic team in 1968&mldr; Jones’ 10 NBA titles are the second-most by any player (only former Boston teammate Bill Russell has more, 11). A five-time All-Star, Jones was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and his No. 24 is retired by the Celtics&mldr; Little Brother was a rap group from 2001-10 made up of three NCC students (Phonte, Rapper Big Pooh and 9th Wonder).

Strahan played his entire career with the Giants and has stayed in the bright lights of New York as Kelly Ripa's co-host and Regis Philbin's replacement on \"Live! with Kelly and Michael\"&mldr; Named the No. 1 gospel singer of the decade for the 2000s by Billboard, Adams has sold more than 8 million records worldwide and won four Grammys&mldr; Hines won two gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics, setting world records in the 100 meters and well as the 4x100 relay team. With his record time of 9.95, Hines became the first sprinter to officially break the 10-second barrier, a record he held for 15 years. The Miami Dolphins hoped his track speed would translate to the NFL. It didn't. He caught just two career passes and is ranked by Deadspin as the 10th worst NFL player of all-time&mldr; A trailblazing politician, Jordan was the first black female member of the U.S. House of Representatives. She was also the first black woman keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention, giving a speech researchers rank as the fifth-best of the 20th century, behind Martin Luther King's \"I Have A Dream\", JFK and FDR's inauguration addresses and FDR's \"A Date Which Will Live in Infamy\"&mldr; Taylor won gold at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the 4x100 meter relay and captured silver in the 100m, a race remembered for two Americans missing their heat start times because of a communication error, while Taylor made it just in time. \"These sprinters missed the start-line in their heats!

The General won three national titles at IU and finished his coaching career with a 902-371 record (.709)&mldr; Arguably the greatest track athlete of all-time, Owens owned the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, basically giving Adolph Hitler the finger the whole time. Owens won four gold medals (100m, 200m, long jump, 4x100 relay) and became an international superstar&mldr; If you read books in elementary and middle school, you probably know who R.L. Stine is. He's authored more than 100 books but is known for his \"Goosebumps\" and \"Fear Street\" series. \"Night of the Living Dummy\" was a guaranteed nightmare&mldr; Heaton gained prominence for her role as Ray Ramono's wife in \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and stars in ABC's \"The Middle\", which is set in Indiana.
