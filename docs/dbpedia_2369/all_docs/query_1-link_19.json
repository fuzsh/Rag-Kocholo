        "text": "Album of the Week, October 7: Shoot Out the Lights by Richard and Linda Thompson\n\nOctober 7, 2012\n\nThis week Music and Meaning launches a new Sunday feature, the Album of the Week. It’s only fitting to kick things off with my favorite album of all time.\n\nIn many ways, Shoot Out the Lights is an album that should never have happened. Richard Thompson met Linda Peters at a one-off recording session called the Bunch. Mutual friends — many of whom had been in Fairport Convention with Richard — were making an album of 50s covers. The two soon became a couple. Linda performed backing vocals on Richard’s first solo album after leaving Fairport. They recorded two albums together before retiring from music to a Sufi commune. Music continued to call, however. They released two more wonderful albums as they transitioned away from the commune.\n\nTitle Shoot Out the Lights Act Richard & Linda Thompson Label Hannibal Release Date 3/15/82 Producer Joe Boyd U.S. Chart n/c U.K. Chart n/c Tracks\n\nDon’t Renege On Our Love\n\nWalking On A Wire\n\nMan In Need\n\nJust the Motion\n\nShoot Out the Lights\n\nBack Street Slide\n\nDid She Jump (or Was She Pushed)?\n\nWall of Death\n\nTheir fifth album, Sunnyvista, was a commercial and artistic disappointment. Gerry Rafferty had sung on the album, however, and he used his post-Baker Street star power to help finance the sessions for a sixth album. The sessions were tense and the results were mixed. Rafferty was unable to find a label for the disc, and the project was shelved. Long-time friend and Fairport producer Joe Boyd had just launched a small label, Hannibal, and invited the duo to start fresh with the Rafferty session material. Sadly, their marriage was disintegrating, and the sessions, while productive, were tense at best. The result, perhaps fueled by the drama and energy, was one of the finest albums ever made. Accompanied by former Fairport colleagues, future Richard bandmates, and vocal wizards the Watersons, the assembly of talent was amazing, and the results managed to exceed that promise.\n\nAlthough only eight tracks long, it’s a perfect view into the darker realms of the human heart and mind. These were not new themes for Richard and Linda, but they emerged with striking clarity and musical power. Man In Need emerged as Richard’s desperate plea as the past decade collapsed. Did She Jump? was one of only two tracks co-written by Linda during the duo’s musical partnership; like the previous Pavanne, it showcased a woman on the edge, flirting with crime and dark forces to make her life meaningful. Back Street Slide was one of Richard’s earliest forays into a straightforward dissection of cruel human interaction, devoid of the folk trappings and metaphors of his previous songs. The title track, on the surface a look at the mind of a serial killer, is an effective look at human darkness in its many forms. It also features a powerful guitar solo which has shown up on many best-of lists. Don’t Renege On Our Love is a stunning plea for reconciliation or separation. Just the Motion and Walking On A Wire are two of Linda’s finest vocal performances and show two sides of coping — looking for hope in the wreckage and trying to rise above it, however hopeless. The final track is the starkly uplifting Wall of Death. This is one of my favorite songs of all time. Using a carnival metaphor, it’s a wonderful duet vocal with a make-the-best-of-it message that redeems the dark path blazed by the other seven songs.\n\nRichard and Linda divorced as the album was released, barely touring to support its release. Shoot Out the Lights emerged on many 1982 best-of lists. Since that time it has appeared on dozens of all-time-best lists, including Rolling Stone‘s 500 Best Albums of All Time. Richard has spent the three decades since its release carving out a respected career as a singer, songwriter, composer, and music historian. Linda, suffering from a vocal paralysis that limits her ability to sing, has nonetheless released a handful of wonderful albums and worked closely with son Teddy and daughter Kami as they launched their recording and performing careers. Thirty years on, however, Shoot Out the Lights remains the masterpiece, forged in a crucible of circumstance that caused two great talents to reach amazing and powerful levels.\n\nSong of the Day, March 7: Telling Me Lies the Trio (originally by Linda Thompson)\n\nMarch 7, 2012\n\nToday’s song is Telling Me Lies by Linda Thompson and covered by the Trio. After divorce from husband Richard in 1982, Linda began the gradual work of assembling her first solo album. She wrote many of the tracks with Betsy Cook whom she had met through Gerry Rafferty when he was exchanging album work with Richard and Linda in the late 70s. Although many (including Linda herself) bemoan the heavy 80s production values, One Clear Moment is a strong album with many great songs. One of the true standouts is Telling Me Lies. Although it’s tempting to read it as autobiography (and perhaps a counterpoint to Richard’s She Twists the Knife Again from Across A Crowded Room, his album of the same year), it is a very universal song that fits easily into her catalog.\n\nYou told me you needed my company\n\nAnd I believed in your flattering ways\n\nTold me you needed me forever\n\nNearly gave you the rest of my days\n\nShould’ve seen you for what you are\n\nShould never have come back for more\n\nShould’ve locked up all my silver\n\nBrought the key back to your door\n\nI cover my ears I close my eyes\n\nStill hear your voice and it’s telling me lies\n\nTelling me lies\n\nThe song took on new life in 1988 when Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt recorded a beautiful cover version for their album Trio. That recording went to #3 on the Country charts led to a Grammy nomination for Best Country Song and Linda Thompson’s only performance at a Grammy ceremony. (The song lost to Forever and Ever, Amen as performed by Randy Travis.) Copyright restrictions prevent the online availability of Linda’s brilliant original recording, so enjoy this video for the great Trio version today.\n\nSong of the Day, February 15: Wall of Death by Richard and Linda Thompson\n\nFebruary 15, 2012\n\nToday’s song is Wall of Death by Richard and Linda Thompson. The closing track of their 1982 masterpiece Shoot Out the Lights, this song is the perfect fusion of the skepticism, storytelling, determination, and sheer musicality that define their brief but potent partnership and their subsequent solo careers. It’s unusual in that it is sung by both Richard and Linda in harmony throughout the song, a fitting form for the end of their final album together.\n\nThe song takes its title and inspiration from a carnival show involving a motorcyclist defying gravity in a cylindrical stage. The lyrics carry a perfect grim optimism well suited to making the best of the world as we face it. The music and wonderful harmonies are more buoyant, lending an added air of hope. While the song tells of oddities and off-beat opportunities — the bearded lady and the tunnel of love, for example — the carnival analogies are a fair match for everyday life.\n\nLet me ride on the Wall of Death, one more time.\n\nLet me ride on the Wall of Death, one more time.\n\nYou can waste your time on the other rides\n\nbut this is the nearest to being alive.\n\nO, let me take my chances on the Wall of Death.\n\nThis is what a life well-lived is all about: taking good chances and finding ways to be alive.\n\nRegular readers of this blog will have noticed that my musical tastes are pretty eclectic. The wide variety of Songs of the Day is truly reflective of what I enjoy; each one is a track I really love from among the thousands in my collection. It’s nice to have so many choices to meet the many different kinds of days and moods that I encounter. If compelled, however, I would easily pick this as my favorite song of all. For that reason, I picked it as my birthday song. Please celebrate my 46th birthday with me and enjoy this magnificent song of determination and hope. (Added bonus: Richard plays this song live regularly, too!)"
