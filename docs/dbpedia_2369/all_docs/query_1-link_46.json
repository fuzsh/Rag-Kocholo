        "text": "(OPEN) A FEW OF MY FAVORITE THINGS – John Coltraine – I know. Not an unknown song but it sure worked for the open.\n\nFOR SPACIOUS LIES – Beats International (After the Housdmartins and before Fat Boy Slim Norman Cook was part of this long-forgotten group that made one album that included this joyful track I always go back to)\n\nI DON’T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU – House of Love – This came out of the alternative explosion of the early nineties and holds up as one of the best examples from the UK.\n\nKISS YOUR LIPS – Allo Darlin’ – My favorite song from The British band’s self-titled 2010 perfect debut. They should have been more successful!\n\nIS IT TRUE – Brenda Lee – About 25-years-ago a friend turned me on to this unlikely song from the “I’m Sorry” vocalist and I’ve been listening all the time ever since. The song just rocks!\n\nLOVE AND LONELINESS – The Motors – When I was a youngster back in the early 80s I was moved by the songs pseudo-psycho-analysis and unforgettable new wave groove.\n\nBROKEN ENGLISH – Marianne Faithful – When I first saw Marianne perform this song from the eponymous album on SNL in ‘79 my head was blown. Nothing i’d heard was quite like her. Then when I learned her backstory: wow!\n\nROCK ‘ N ROLL GIRL – Paul Collins Beat – Great song from this West Coast power pop group was on a remarkable CBS Records (The Police, Joe Jackson) collection I picked up when visiting my uncle in Sweden circa 1979 (too). Still love it!\n\nDAVEY CROCKETT – Thee Headcoats – A lark of a song from 1959, always makes me smile. Is this where The Ramones got “Gabba Gabba Hey”?\n\nLOCO DE AMOR – David Byrne – Song during open credits of “Something Wild,” one of my favorite Jonathan Demme movies. Perfect!\n\nBIG BROWN EYES – Old 97s – First song I saw these guys play at SXSW many years ago. Great blend of power pop and classic country! Been a fan ever since.\n\nHAVE I STAYED TOO LONG – Sonny & Cher – I first heard this song on their 1991 CD Greatest Hits Collection. It’s always stuck with me.\n\nA SHOT IN THE ARM – Wilco – Their early album SUMMER TEETH is one of my favorites by Wilco and this is my favorite song from it.\n\nTEAR STAINED LETTER – Richard Thompson – The gateway song from his first solo album to Richard and Linda Thompson and all of his wonderful solo work.\n\nREACH OUT IN THE DARKNESS – Friend and Lover – I had never heard this song from the 60s before it played during the closing credits of a Mad Men episode about 15 years ago. Still sounds perfect!\n\nSPRINGTIME IN NEW YORK – Jonathan Richman – I love Jonathan and this song from 2002’s HER MYSTERY NOT OF HIGH HEELS AND EYESHADOW is special as he strolls through the New York neighborhood I call home.\n\nANNIE’S GONE – Redd Kross – From one of the quintessential west coast band’s only major label releases when they were all signing indie bands. I go back to this one often. Power pop doesn’t get much better than this.\n\nSOMETHING I’VE GOT TO TELL YOU – Glenda Collins – This was on a collection of a British 60s cult figure Joe Meek’s productions I heard for the first time about 25 years ago. It has about 16,000 plays on Spotify when it should have been a massive hit.\n\nHAMMOND SONG – The Roches – I didn’t first hear this song for some time after its initial release (it wasn’t cool!) but once I did I was blown over by the pure harmonies. So good!"
