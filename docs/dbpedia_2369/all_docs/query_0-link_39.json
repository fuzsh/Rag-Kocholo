        "text": "Jimmy Rabbitt \"...And Renegade\" (Capitol Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Waylon Jennings)\n\nA decent Commander Cody-ish set, though nothing amazing, really. Jimmy Rabbit was a Texas-born radio deejay who had previously been a rocker, playing in Texas bands such as Mouse & The Traps and a short-lived psychedelic garage band called Positively 13 O'Clock. Switching gears, Rabbitt moved to California in 1969 and became an influential member of the \"freeform\" radio scene, notably with a long stint on KROQ in LA, where his sets mixed classic country with material bubbling up from the '70s country-rock scene. He also played music and is best known for co-writing \"Long Haired Redneck\" with David Allan Coe... He seems to have hooked up with Waylon Jennings as well -- ol' Waylon not only produced this album, playing geetar and whooping along on a tune or two -- and that's nothing to sneeze at. Rabbitt seems to have had his heart in the right place, covering folks like Delbert McClinton and Alice Stuart, as well as a version of Lee Clayton's \"Ladies Love Outlaws,\" which chipped its way into the charts. It sounds like Rabbitt wasn't really able to cut loose on this album, playing it safe when he should've gotten a little wild. This is okay, but it ain't gonna make a big difference in your life... Worth a spin, though!\n\nJimmy Rabbitt \"The Texas Album: Outlaw Country\" (St. Roch Recordings, 2015) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jerry Wexler & Keith Olson)\n\nLong-lost demo recordings, cut for Atlantic Records in 1973... Jerry Wexler helmed the sessions, with fabled session player James Booker backing Rabbitt's band on the ivories...\n\nBuzz Rabin \"Cross Country Cowboy\" (Elektra Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pete Drake)\n\nSongwriter Buzz Rabin (ne Raybon Busby) was a Nashville journeyman who is probably best known as one of the main contributors to Ringo Starr's country-oriented 1970 solo album, Beaucoups Of Blues. Rabin was recommended to Ringo by producer Pete Drake, and rode that coup all the way into a solo album several years later. Other than one single released in '69, this was apparently the only record Rabin released, though his career as a songwriter in Nashville lasted many years, most notably with the Top Five hit, \"Your Body Is An Outlaw,\" recorded by Mel Tillis in 1980, as well as gigs with David Allan Coe and others. (Note: I'm not sure where Rabin was from originally -- he occasionally seems to be confused with the much-older, Louisiana-born bluegrass legend Buzz Busby, though I don't think there was any real connection, other than them both being from Louisiana. Anyone with more info about Rabin's career? I'm all ears!)\n\nMichael Rabon & Choctaw \"Michael Rabon & Choctaw\" (Uni Records, 1970) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Robin Hood Brians & Michael Rabon)\n\nA non-pop outing from Michael Rabon (1943-2022) the former lead singer of the bubblegum-ish 'Sixties Top 40 band The Five Americans, and who later played guitar in the rock band Gladstone. He apparently dropped out and went to live in the desert after the his days of '60s pop glory, and this album seems to have been a musical declaration of independence. There's some overt country-rock on here, particularly on songs like \"Texas Sparrow\" and \"Country Music,\" though the album is even more full of mellow folk-psych tunes and (semi-) hard rock with power chords though with thankfully little macho swagger. The twang tunes are interesting, particularly how Rabon blended pedal steel with sharper rock guitars... Although this is more of a rock record, its early '70s release does make it a credible country-rock forerunner, and it'll probably be of interest to folks who are into Mike Nesmith's music of the same era.\n\nMichael Rabon \"Texas 'Til I Die\" (Knife Wing Records, 1975) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Thom Caccetta, Michael Rabon & Don Smith)\n\nA quintessential early 'Seventies country-rock outing, with hazy hippiedelic takes on honkytonk twang and drawl, and a few sideways wobbles into folk on one hand and rock on the other... Full of stoned musings and musical indulgences, this album has a few gems, a few mildly cringeworthy moments, and an overall groovy, relaxed vibe. One song, \"Try A Little Harder,\" is a slightly solipsistic diatribe about following you muse and making your own kinda music, no matter what the heartless, bean-counting big-label business guys tell you, while \"Straight Brother\" is a funny, odd hippie-era time capsule about how everyone has some \"straight\" relative who might not be cool, man, but is still okay. (\"Straight\" being hippie-speak for squares, not gay lingo for heterosexuals...) The only tune that make me pick up the needle and skip past it was \"Shotgun,\" a fairly strained attempt at hard-rock, roots-funk; other than that, though, this is a pretty groovy set, in a distinctly Nesmith-ian way. Mike Rabon wrote almost all the songs on here, sings and plays lead guitar, with Jim Grant on bass, Dahrell Norris (drums), Doug Rhone (guitar), Ron Snyder (percussion) and steel player Larry White, who adds a lot of texture to the sound. A real 'Seventies time capsule... definitely worth a spin.\n\nThe Racquette River Rounders \"The Racquette River Rounders\" (Adirondack Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by David Fleur & The Racquette River Rounders)\n\nFounded in 1979, the Racquette River Rounders was an acoustic string-swing and folk trio from Potsdam, New York, made up of Danny Gotham, Michael Hadfield and John Kribs... They took their name from the Raquette River, which originates in upstate New York, up in what folks call \"the North Country.\" This album features lots of original material, including the \"Harrisburg Rag,\" which was inspired by the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear reactor meltdown. The group stayed together for a few years in the early 'Eighties, and according to Mr. Gotham's website, they occasionally played a few plugged-in electric gigs, using the name the Rolling Clones. Gotham later joined a bluegrass band called Summit, which recorded one album mid-decade, while Hadfield and Kribs formed a roots-rock band called Johnny & The Triumphs.\n\nThe Racquette River Rounders \"Liberty\" (Adirondack Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by David Fleur & The Racquette River Rounders)\n\nThe Rader Family \"Fresh Country\" (Ocean Opry Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dennis Rader)\n\nThe Rader Family was a gospel-and-oldies band led by patriarch Wayne Rader (1936-2015) a Missouri native who owned an appliance store in Wichita, Kansas, but found himself drawn to show business after managing a gospel quartet called the Riverside Boys, which featured his sons, Billy and Dennis. The Raders also recorded as an ensemble for a small gospel label in Cincinnati, and having dipped their toes in the entertainment world, they jumped into it whole hog in 1978 when they moved to Panama City, Florida and created their own, family-run country music venue. The first Ocean Opry show debuted in August, 1978, kicking off a multi-decade, multi-generational enterprise, with the venue finally closing in 2005 when Wayne Rader and his wife Patsy retired. Ocean Opry was mostly a family affair, though like many mom'n'pop oprys they hired outside performers such as singer Ric Mason, who recorded an entire album while part of their 1982 season cast. Other featured performers included multi-instrumentalist Dennis Rader, who doubled as the troupe's cornpone comedian, Moonshine, doing parody songs, skits and recitations, and later became an ordained minister before moving to Nashville. His brother Billy sang and wrote original material, helped operate the Ocean Opry until it closed, and soon after went into local politics, although he continued to perform for local charities and community events. This album is mostly cover songs -- oldies such \"Pass Me By,\" \"Silver Threads And Golden Needles,\" \"Tennessee Waltz\" and various novelty numbers, though an original penned by Billy Rader, \"Don't Say Goodbye,\" kicks off the album. This is one of several Ocean Opry souvenir albums; numerous cassettes and CDs were also issued, many perhaps lost to the tides of time.\n\nThe Rader Family \"Some Sweet Day\" (Ocean Opry Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Billy Rader & Dennis Rader)\n\nAn all-gospel album featuring the Rader brothers backed by Mark Dene on harmonica, Calvin Gann (piano), Charlie Gilley (steel guitar), and Mike Latourette on drums, with the brothers each playing multiple instruments.\n\nThe Rader Family \"Ocean Opry's Most Requested Show Songs\" (Ocean Opry Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Billy Rader & Dennis Rader)\n\nMore cover songs, mostly, in a variety of styles. Things kick off with Billy Rader doing a medley of country music impersonations; other highlights include a couple of original songs, \"Sea-Going Cowboy\" (co-written by Billy Rader and Mike LaTourette) and LaTourette's own \"You've Got Me Worried.\"\n\nThe Rader Family \"Food On The Table\" (Ocean Opry Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dennis Rader)\n\nThe Rader Family/Various Artists \"Ocean Opry Live On Stage\" (Ocean Opry Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nGrant Rader \"Grant Rader\" (Jomar Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nOld-time fiddling by an old-timer in the orbit of the Hebron, South Dakota studio operated by the Tibor Brothers. Several Tibors also back Mr. Rader, including Francis Tibor on drums, Gerard Tibor (piano), Harvey Tibor (steel guitar), Kurt Tibor (bass), and Larry Tibor on guitar.\n\nRadio Flyer \"Radio Flyer\" (End Of The Trail Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Radio Flyer)\n\nNot to be confused with the bluegrass band from Missouri, this Radio Flyer was a country bar band out of Van Dyne, Wisconsin, playing classics'n'outlaw, with a peppery dash of western swing. The group included lead guitarist Tim Ferguson and his brother Fred Ferguson on bass, with Wally Messner on steel guitar and accordion and Bryan Christiansen pulling triple duty on banjo, fiddle and mandolin. The musicianship is pretty solid, though sometimes their vocals lapse into a corny bar-band self-parody, as if at times they couldn't take the whole country thing totally seriously. That's okay, though, since for the most part this disc is pretty fun, especially with a cover of the old Webb Pierce hit, \"Tupelo County Jail,\" along with several swell originals. Tim Ferguson also played in a band called Ida Red, and more recently in a band called The Best Westerns.\n\nRadio Star \"Radio Star\" (Trackdown Studios, 1987) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gorman John Ruggerio & Alan W. Prince)\n\nThe star of Radio Star, lead singer Gorman John Ruggerio, claimed fifteen years of experience acting on stage and in television prior to cutting this album at a studio in upstate New York... He has several family members backing him, as well as studio engineer Alan W. Prince on lead guitar, Randy Rollman on pedal steel and bass, Keith Crofut picking guitar on one tracks, and a few other folks. There are some country-themed tunes, such as \"There's A Cowboy Town Where Nobody Knows\" and \"A Cowboy's Holiday,\" as well as some songs that seem to be from stage productions he was in... Years later Ruggerio landed some film roles, though largely he seems pretty obscure, at least on the country scene.\n\nDorothy Rae \"Here Is Dorothy Rae\" (Sundial Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nAn oddball offering from a Southern California \"country\" gal whose show-biz bona fides stretch back to the big band era, and whose father, musician Dolor Michaud, worked as an arranger in the Hollywood film studios. Rae's first big break came when she was hired by western swing bandleader Spade Cooley touring with his band before moving into the less-hectic movie industry herself where she worked as a dubbing vocalist in various Hollywood films. In the 1940s, pop bandleader Horace Heidt signed Rae to work on his radio program and paired her up with celebrity whistler Fred Lowery, with whom she recorded several duets 78s on Columbia Records. The Lowery-Rae duo left Heidt's band after World War Two and touring nationally though they struggled in the late 1940s, having enough name recognition to work the vaudeville circuit, but not enough star power to headline lounge gigs as a \"solo\" act. According to the liner notes, Dorothy Rae eventually burnt out on the entertainment industry, retiring to become a fashion designer... but somewhere along the line she acquired a Hammond organ and revived her act, reflected in this album chock full of brisk comedic ditties with Ms. Rae breezily stroking the keys and trotting through her chatty lyrics, with a bit of a jazzy, Blossom Dearie sound. To be clear: this ain't exactly twang, though it's country enough to include here. There are links to old-school country music, including her tune \"Texan In Paris,\" which riffs on \"Deep In The Heart Of Texas,\" as well as her covers of \"For The Good Times\" and \"Little Liza Jane,\" though the rural material is filtered through a pop-jazz lens, much as it was during the big band era. Dorothy Rae seems to have moved up to the Bay Area at some point: the hype sticker on her second album reads, \"now appearing at Masiani's Santa Clara, California,\" and I found this disc in a dollar bin near San Jose. There's no date on the disc, though she dated an autograph 6/76, so I'd guess it was pressed anytime from 1972-76, given the inclusion of the Kristofferson tune.\n\nNova Rae \"Love And Sunshine\" (1976-?) (LP)\n\nOne of our more elusive artists, possibly because she didn't do many public performances... Although the liner notes of her similarly-titled Just Like Sunshine album (below) say that it was her first LP, I think actually this one came out earlier, and didn't \"count\" because it was a gospel record, while the other one is nominally secular. Not entirely sure about that, but it's a theory. Anyway, Nova Rae was the stage name for Ms. Nova Michaux (aka Nova Rae Harrison Michaux, 1944-2005) who hailed from a tiny town called Woodville, out in East Texas, kinda near Lufkin. She worked in the local schools as early as 1964, and on one of her singles billed herself as \"the singing teacher,\" although I don't think she pursued music as a career. Ms. Michaux copyrighted a bunch of original religious songs early in 1976, tunes like \"The Glory To Find,\" \"Heaven Is Today,\" \"The Leader\" and \"Settin' Around\" and around the same time cut several secular country singles, including two on Chart Records, one on Brack Records, and another that came out under her real name, Nova Michaux, released on a micro-label from New Jersey. And yet, this seems to be the sum total of her online footprint, so some questions remain. If anyone has more info, I'm all ears!\n\nNova Rae \"Just Like Sunshine\" (Brack Records, 1977-?) (LP)\n\nThough the back cover says this was her first album, I'm a little skeptical, though it's kind of a six-of-one, half-dozen-of-the-other situation, since all of her records seem to have been recorded and released around the same time, roughly 1976-77. This is a secular set, though there's a spiritual undercurrent to a few of the songs (\"Love Power,\" for example...) About half the songs first came out as singles, including her cover of Neil Sedaka's \"Love Will Keep Us Together,\" \"Burning Bridges,\" and others. Alas, no musician or producer credits, so while this came out on a Nashville imprint, it's not clear if this was actually recorded in Music City... also, the songs were probably recorded using several different bands, some released as singles and others probably added later to fill out the album.\n\nEd Raetzloff \"It Took A Long Time To Get To You\" (Newpax Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Steve Aune & Joe Wilson)\n\nChristian country-rock with some fancy pickers on the sessions... Ed Raetzloff was formerly lead singer for Blue Jug a southern rock outfit from Virginia, and brings that secular band's roots-rock sound into the CCM movement, carving out a new career in the Christian music scene. The gruff, bluesy twang is an interesting twist, though the sometimes-clunky lyrics suffer (as gospel rock often does) from the need to explain his conversion and preach about it to others -- perhaps not the easiest thing to express artfully. At any rate, an interesting mix of sensibilities, groundbreaking at the time.\n\nEd Raetzloff \"Drivin' Wheels\" (Newpax Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Turley Richards)\n\nThe Railsplitters \"In Dixie\" (Marbil Records, 1978-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Turpin, Scott Long & Fred Perkins)\n\nThis group from Georgia was led by fiddler Everett Clackler (1921-2015), who was born in Clanton, Alabama and later moved to Georgia, eventually settling in the town of Warner Robins, where he owned a business called Kissing Cousins. Mr. Clacker was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall Of Fame, and worked in a variety of bands, including his own Melody Makers (while still in Mobile), the Railsplitters, and a group called the Claude Hicks Vocal Band, in the 1990s. The Railsplitters were together for much of the 1970s and '80s, with a lineup that included Clackler on fiddle, Billy Bumpers (bass), Gene Griffin (drums), Garland Thornton (rhythm guitar), and Jeff Walker on lead.\n\nRain Crow \"Cowboys And Indians\" (Howling Records Company, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Larry Funk & Cliff Shilling)\n\nAnother cool record from the heartland, in this case, from Newton, Kansas, not far from Wichita, albeit released on a label from Longmont, Colorado... There's a wide mix of styles here, from straightforward twang and jaunty rodeo songs to surprisingly hip western swing, ala Asleep At The Wheel. There might be some slight issues of cultural appropriation, what with the \"cowboys and Indians\" motif on the front cover, though singer Cliff Shilling was apparently of first nations descent -- a Pawnee-Choctaw -- and his presumably autobiographical song, \"Choctaw,\" opens the album, complete with a Native American chorus led by powwow singer Harvey Ware, so perhaps it was more legitimate than one might assume. The core of the band included Jim Mangan on piano, Lynn Piller (bass and guitar), Reece Pullen (drums), Katy J. Ray (lead guitar), and Cliff Shilling (bass and guitar) and a whole slew of guest musicians, including fiddler Jeff Pritchart, bassist Armadillo Slim, a small horn section, and harmony singers Brian Driscoll, Jeanette Driscoll, and Joni Richardson. The band's main members take turns singing lead, with Jim Mangan being perhaps the most solid country singer; Katy J. Ray has a distinctive presence, initially coming off as a proto-Lucinda Williams type on her composition, \"Foolish Woman, Foolish Man\" (an album highlight) though she later devolves into sort of a Juice Newton knockoff. Lynn Piller was formerly in the early 'Seventies country-rock band Treefrog, and there may have been other connections to that Lawrence-based band. While not all the songs are that great, the album's first side is pretty solid, while Side Two drifts off onto a few questionable pop-flavored tangents. Overall, this is well worth checking out, especially if you're into Kansas country.\n\nThe Rainbow Boogie Band \"The Rainbow Boogie Band\" (Capital City Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pete Blanchard)\n\nA Texas country-rock band from Abiline...\n\nRainbow Canyon CB \"Rainbow Canyon CB's Greatest Hit\" (1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tommy Lee Reid)\n\nI'm not sure, but I think the CB was meant to stand for \"country band,\" presumably to differentiate these guys from a rock band that had the Rainbow Canyon name in the 'Seventies... This twangband from Columbus, Ohio was anchored by lead singers and primary songwriters Bob Hummel (1947-2019) and Neil Walter, who struck gold with their first single, \"Franklin Country Woman,\" an homage to their hometown that was packed with lots of local references and generated lots of local fans. Other songs such as \"Discobilly Music\" and \"Please Mr. Carter\" underscore their novelty orientation, which frequently tilted towards the crude, as on their profanity-laden \"Corvette Cowboy,\" as well as a version of Jimmy Buffett's \"Why Don't We Get Drunk And Screw.\" Other cover songs include a lesser-known Kenny Rogers song and Johnny Horton's \"Battle Of New Orleans,\" although this album distinguishes itself with its wealth of original material, as on their previous LP. This seems to have been recorded in several sessions over a number of years, with a parade of sidemen including two different bass players and four drummers. Lead guitar Jeff Shaner seems to have been there all the way along, with additional backing by steel player Amos Searan and fiddlers Junior Bennett and Andy Carey. The group continued in various forms for several years, including an edition with a gal named Jojo McQuade, who married Robert Hummell in 1985.\n\nRainbow Canyon \"It Was So Tasty\" (Rainbow Canyon Records, 1985) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Casey & Doug Edwards)\n\nAlthough the Bob Hummel/Neil Walter duo still provided most of the material, additional song credits are given for Ward Foster, Jojo McQuade, and Roy Leslie Lee (who also had a song recorded by Nashville's Bill Phillips) though I'm not sure how many of these folks also played on this album. Hummell and McQuade kept the band up for several years, and there was a \"Rainbow Canyon 88\" that celebrated the band's tenth anniversary.\n\nThe Rainbow Ramblers \"Dance Time With The Rainbow Ramblers\" (Goldust Records, 196-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Emmit Brooks)\n\nLed by singer Bill Marinell, the Rainbow Ramblers were a straight-up country dance band from Ruidoso, New Mexico, with a following throughout the Southwest. The group was formed in 1962 and included Hank Henke playing bass, Jimmy Patterson (drums), Jimmy Temple (lead guitar), Calvin Turbeville (steel guitar), and Fred Wood on fiddle. The set list for this album is almost all cover songs, stuff by George Morgan, Moon Mullican, Buck Owens and Bob Wills, as well as one song penned by Bill Martinell, \"Like I Did You.\" Martinell sings lead on most tracks, with Temple and Wood each taking the spotlight on one song. Other than a single or two, I'm not sure if they made other records; Calvin Turbeville worked as a session player on several other Goldust albums.\n\nThe Rainbow Valley Boys & Sweetheart \"Authentic Blue Grass Music\" (Diplomat Records, 196-?) (LP)\n\nFairly straight-up bluegrass, notable from my end of things for the gal singer referred to only as \"Sweetheart\" (though I sure wish I knew her real name!) This album has was issued under a few different budget-line labels, with different album art as well. The pressings were pretty cheap, though, and the sound quality was also pretty poor. Oh, well.\n\nDel Raines & Bert Raines \"Great Nashville Sounds Of Gospel Music\" (Skyland Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nRoy J. Raines \"Old Time Fiddlin' Bluegrass Style\" (Ozark Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by D. E. Reno)\n\nA back-to-basics, down-home old-timey trio from Columbia, Missouri, spotlighting fiddler Roy J. Raines (1914-2004) along with banjo plunker Nelson Raines and guitarist Ernest Western... Raines grew up in Camden and Morgan counties, in the area surrounding Osage Beach and the Lake Of The Ozarks, and according to the liner notes, the Raines family had deep musical roots: Roy's father won a national fiddling championship in 1937, and Roy picked up the instrument when quite young, later playing in a regional hoedown band called The Missouri Round-Up Boys. There are a plenty of classic fiddle tunes on here -- \"Bill Cheatum,\" \"Grey Eagle,\" \"Eighth Of January,\" etc. -- but also a few less well-known numbers, such as \"Comin' Down From Denver\" and \"Flat Rock.\" As far as I know, this was Mr. Raines's only album.\n\nRains & Harris \"Rains & Harris\" (RCA Victor, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jim Ed Norman)\n\nThe short-lived country/pop duo of Greg Harris and Chick Rains, both veterans of the '70s Southern California country-rock scene, with backing by Al Perkins on pedal steel, and Michael Bowden, who was also in the band Cold Steel. Starting in the late '70s, Greg Harris was a frequent on-again/off-again member of the Flying Burrito Brothers and studio musician, while after this album tanked, Chick Rains went on to become a successful country songwriter in Nashville. I think this was the duo's only album, with all but one of the songs being written by Rains.\n\nJerry Rainwater \"...Presents An Instant Replay\" (Sound Systems, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Hoot Gibson)\n\nA mega-DIY album of rootsy folk-twang, recorded in Odessa, Texas, where Jerry Rainwater (1942-2011) had a long run leading the house band at a place called the Flamingo Bar in the mid-to-late 'Seventies. He was a lifelong Texan, born near Abilene in a tiny town called Snyder, and his band seems to have been all locals, including Doug Atwood on bass, Merle David (fiddle), Jay Hansborough (percussion), Terry Vincent (piano) and Jerry Rainwater playing all the guitars. All the songs are Rainwater originals, including the title track, \"Instant Replay (Of A Time That's Never Been)\" and \"Busted For Loving You.\" Not sure if he made any other records, though I think this one later came out on CD.\n\nThe Rainy Day Singers \"Country Favorites\" (GRT/Sunnyvale Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nThe Rainy Day Singers \"Great Country Songs\" (GRT/Sunnyvale Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dick Heard)\n\nAn odd, Pickwick-esque, cheapo-budget label offering with covers of early- and mid-1970s country hits by an anonymous studio band. The back cover lists several other \"rainy day\" records, including LPs of show tunes and movie themes, so make of that what you will.\n\nRoger Rainy \"Breaker Breaker: Roger Rainy Sings Country\" (197-?) (LP)\n\nA twangster from rural Minnesota who also released some 7\" singles... Roger W. Reini (d. 2010) was an active musician throughout much of the 1960s and '70s, working a day job in the grocery produce business. According to his obituary, Reini performed extensively throughout the Great Lakes region and in Texas before deciding to retire from the music business, and was known for his tenure in the house band at a joint called the Broken Spoke, in Big Lake, Minnesota. He wrote a couple of songs on this album, including \"Best Day Of My Life\" and \"One More Time,\" although the title track was penned by June Petri... There are also a few cover songs, including a version of Mel Street's 1972 hit, \"Borrowed Angel,\" which might place this album somewhere in the '73-74 range... The front of the album is one of those \"cop covers\" showing a staged photo of a police officer \"busting\" the band; the back cover is blank white cardboard, with no info about where or when this record was made. The band included Roger Rainy on vocals and rhythm guitar, Jerry Rahn (lead guitar), Curt Nohrenberg (bass) and Gary Stibal on drums.\n\nRoger Rainy \"These Changes In Me\" (197-?) (LP)\n\nThis later album was recorded in both Nashville and Minneapolis; Buddy Emmons, Leon Jackson and Bud Logan were in the Music City crew...\n\nRaisin Kane \"It's About Time\" (Legend Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Alan Raidt & Raisin' Kane)\n\nAn obscure, super-indie southern rock band from Martin, Tennessee fronted by lead singers Larry Brewer and Paul David Lindsey, with backing by guitarist Larry Bedwell, Bert Dyer (organ), Mike Jenkins (bass), and drummer Gary Wadley. To be honest, a lot of this verges on unlistenable, at least from a country music perspective (fans of 'Seventies rock might be delighted). The uptempo tracks generally feature frantic, piercing rock guitars, though some tracks (like \"Tennessee Foxy Lady\") sound kind of Eagles-ish and fit into a country-rock vibe. Mostly, there's lots of shrill, note-heavy, would-be guitar-god soloing -- including some twin guitar riffs -- and on these all-rock numbers the amateurish production values stand out. Some good vocal harmonies, but the disc really ping-pongs between mellow passages and Spinal Tap-ish excesss. Not my cup of tea, but worth noting.\n\nBonnie Raitt -- see artist profile\n\nPal Rakes \"Palmer C. Rakes\" (Musicor Records, 1977-?) (LP)\n\nOne of those long-term pluggers who just kept toiling in obscurity for years and years and years, Tampa, Florida's Pal Rakes put in plenty of time in Nashville, and scored several major label contracts, though for the most part success proved elusive. After working in a more pop-oriented 'Sixties band called Pal & The Prophets, he shifted more full-time into a country mode, cutting a string of singles on various labels, constantly searching for a way to make things click. This is an odd album: apparently issued only as a promo, it contains nine songs that as far as I can tell were not released as singles, and presumably the folks at Musicor were just trying to clear out his contract before they folded up shop. Rakes landed on his feet, though, moving to Warner Brothers, where he scored his biggest career hits, a pair of Top Forty singles, \"That's When the Lyin' Stops (And the Lovin' Starts)\" (#24) and \"Till I Can't Take It Anymore,\" a remake of an old soul song which made it to #31. Despite this modest success, Warner didn't invest in a full album, cut Rakes loose in the early '80s. His final swan song came with yet another major-label deal, resulting in an album on Atlantic that also yielded a few back forty singles. I'm not sure what became of Rakes since the late '80s, but he sure had a quite a run in the music business!\n\nPal Rakes \"Midnight Rain\" (Atlantic Records, 1988-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Nelson Larkin, Ron Reynolds & Hank Williams)\n\nNorm Raleigh \"Midnight Cowboy\" (Crown Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nAnother anonymous cheapo-label disc with no liner notes, no producer or musician info, no nothin', except the music! It's possible \"Norm Raleigh\" was a pseudonym for one of the Southern California hired guns who banged these discs our, morning, noon and night. Or possibly, Norm was a real guy... Maybe he came from a small town somewhere in Texas or something, headed for the big city with nothing but his guitar, his hat and a jacket, tried to make it in the music business and fell in with some shady characters... Who knows? At any rate, this must have been a reasonably popular album, since Crown was still selling it in the trades several years after it was made. The title track is, of course, a cover of the theme to the 1969 film, Midnight Cowboy, though the rest of the record is packed with idiosyncratic originals, the kind of weird, half-baked gems that make these cheapo albums fun. No songwriter credits, though, of course.\n\nRalph & Clyde \"Clyde And Ralph Present: Ralph And Clyde\" (Big J Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThe roots duo of bassist Clyde Jorgensen and guitar picker Ralph Smith first came to Grand Junction, Colorado to do a few weeks residency at the St. Regis Hotel hotel. They liked the area, liked the audience, and stayed in Colorado for decades, becoming local legends.\n\nRalph & Clyde \"Getting Inside With Ralph And Clyde\" (Big J Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nRalph 'N' Clyde \"Listen To The Lights In The Rain\" (Big J Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nRamblin' \"Enjoy A Touch Of The West\" (Kershenstine Holding Company, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gary Edwards & Jay Gallagher)\n\nIf ever there was an album that screamed out \"tax writeoff,\" this disc issued by the Kershenstine Holding Company would be a pretty good candidate. Kershenstine's was an old-school rib joint in Metairie, Louisiana, and is pictured in the background of the album art... One assume's Ramblin' played there at some point? Anyway, Ramblin' was not, oddly enough, the name of a band, but rather the attempted pseudonym of songwriter Phil S. Malbrough, who wrote all but one of the tunes on this album. Malbrough was born in Marksville, LA and apparently tried his luck in Nashville, possibly in Austin as well. One strong point in his favor is that the liner notes were written by uber-indie honkytonker Norman Wade, so major props for the company he kept. Malbrough seems to have been backed by friends, or at least Louisiana locals -- nary a Nashville cat to be seen in this studio crew. The group included Johnny Bonvillain (bass), Harold Cavalara (steel guitar), Pat A. Flory (lead guitar), Phil Meeks (fiddle), Bobby Stapler (piano), Ray Wood (guitar), and others. The one cover tune here is a version of Jerry Jeff Walker's \"Mr. Bojangles,\" with all other songs credited to \"Ramblin',\" including tunes such as \"Almost Perfect Lady,\" \"Beertender Pour Me A Bar,\" and \"What's A Workin' Man Gonna Do.\" Other than this album, Malbrough remains pretty much a cipher... He apparently passed away a while ago (it was mentioned in his brother's obituary) but where or when is unclear.\n\nRamblin' \"Ramblin' \" (Self-Released, 1982-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Renfro)\n\nNot to be confused with the Louisiana group above, this cover band from Ponca, Nebraska was formed in the late 1970s and had a sweet tooth for melodic hits and harmony vocals, stuff like \"All The Gold In California\" by the Gatlins, \"Fancy Free\" by the Oak Ridge Boys and Johnny Lee's big hit, \"Lookin' For Love.\" They also dug more country-rock type stuff such as \"Lyin' Eyes\" by the Eagles, and \"Third Rate Romance,\" the 1975 hit by the Amazing Rhythm Aces. The group included lead guitar Mark Brewer, bassist Dan Frohberg, drummer Craig Kleinberg and lead singer Jeff Taylor (1954-2010) as well as his wife, Joan Taylor, on vocals (even though they didn't include her in the band photo...) Although eventually the band broke up, the Taylors continued to perform together at weddings and other local events well into the 1990s and 2000s; Mr. Taylor passed away in 2010 at the age of 55.\n\nRamblin' Lou & Joanie Marshall's Family Band \"...Featuring The Waltz Of New York\" (Harmony Records, 1980-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Paul David, Murray Hunt & Louis A. Schriver)\n\nWanna know where the folks from Hee-Haw got all their swell showbiz ideas? Well, it might not have been specifically from this family band from upstate New York, but certainly from countless country revue shows just like theirs. Don't believe me? How about Buck Owens, then? He wrote the liner notes praising these folks, and giving an outline of their decade's-long careers playing old-fashion country both onstage and on the radio. Ramblin' Lou Schriver was a deejay on radio station WXRL in Lancaster, New York and presumably worked on the hillbilly vaudeville circuit as well, or in one of the many echoes of that scene. His wife Joanie was the daughter of another hillbilly performer, Bashful Eddie Marshall, who's joined her by his pal, comedian Armand (\"Accordion Zeke\") Cory... and check out Joanie Marshall pictured with her badass double-neck guitar, her name inlaid in pearl and everything! There are also several Schriver sprats playing various instruments, and a couple of ringers as well, notably Al Brisco on pedal steel. The songs are mostly covers of bandshell standards such as \"Games People Play,\" \"Green, Green Grass Of Home\" and \"Rocky Top,\" as well as a few backwoods oldies and gospel tunes -- the title track was written by Louis A. Schriver (not to be confused for his son Louis E. Schriver, who plays the drums). These folks were the real deal, an old-time family band with old-time country roots. Just ask Buck!\n\nRamblin' Lou (Schriever) \"...And The Twin Pine Mountaineers\" (BACM, 2019-?) (LP)\n\nMany of Lou Schriver's early, vintage recordings are gathered on this collectors-only reissue, including hefty chunks of gospel and western material. It's also worth noting that Joanie Marshall also had some solo records of her own, notably on the Canadian-based label, Arc Records.\n\nRamblin' Rebel Band \"Ramblin' Rebel Band\" (Ramblin' Rebel Band, 198--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Gregory-Andrews Audio Productions)\n\nA country band with an undercurrent of bar-band rock -- slightly clunky, local-level stuff with a very Waylon-esque feel... This group from out of Hot Springs, Arkansas featured a whole slew of Castleberrys -- brothers one would assume -- with the full lineup being Doug Castleberry on lead guitar, Kurt Castleberry (rhythm guitar), Troy Castleberry (steel guitar), Andrew Frye (keyboards), Greg Spurling (bass), and Kevin Thorton on drums. Some of the guys look pretty young, maybe even in their high school-year teens. The vocals are sometimes a little wobbly, and the production's a little static or flat, but they sound like real folks, doin' the best they can. There are a few different singing leaders; one of 'em sounds like he was a little nervous working in the studio, and some of the picking sounds pretty amateurish as well. Also noteworthy is the inclusion of a bunch of originals, as well as cover tunes like Buck Owens' \"Let Jesse Rob The Train\" and Waylon's \"Theme From Dukes Of Hazzard.\" There's no date anywhere on the album, but the \"Dukes\" tune lets us know it's from at least sometime in the early-to-mid '80s.\n\nKathy Ramone \"On The Road Again\" (GP Records, 1981) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ben Arrigo, Joe O'Reilly & Arnie Rosenberg)\n\nThough not directly related to the punk rock legends of the same name, Kathy Ramonez Romanko Findley (1954-1995) also used \"Ramone\" as her stage name around the same time they did, performing locally in Sandusky, Ohio during the late 1970s and '80s under the name Kathy Ramone. The name was also used for a nightclub, Ramones Crystal Room, which she and her husband Larry Findley opening in 1984, the first of several supper clubs they opened in the area. Mr. Findley was also a musician, leading a jazz big band that also performed in the area. This album, which was released by a tiny indie label in New York, is pretty much all country covers, although a GP single that came out the same year featured two original songs penned by the Broadway team of Andy Badale and Frank Stanton, \"Nashville Beer Garden\" and \"Quietly Back To Dreaming,\" neither of which appear on her LP. Ms. Ramone also led a band in the 1990s called Top Notch and may have recorded with them; at least one CD came out under her name, though it may have been a posthumous release.\n\nRand And Betty \"Crisp Country Mornin' \" (Oreana Enterprises, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Betty Hillman & Rand Hillman)\n\nAn album of all-original material written, performed and produced by the Boise, Idaho couple of Betty and Rand Hillman. They both grew up in the rural region along the Snake River and started performing in public at an early age, him working the rodeo circuit and her playing in her family's country band. According to her bio, Betty initially set out on her own and played in bands down in Missouri, presumably in the late 1960s, returning home to meet and marry Rand. They started writing together several years before this album came out: some songs were copyrighted as early as 1971, with her name listed as Betty A. Hillman. The liner notes here only list their own musical contributions -- basically she writes lyrics, sings and plays drums, he sings, writes and plays several instruments. It's not clear, though, if there were other musicians involved: we're informed that another album was in the works, and that they were currently on tour with their \"all-girl\" band, Wild Honey. Rand and Betty seem to switch off on songwriting and led vocals, though two tracks feature lyrics by Helen M. Nanney, a local religious author who may have been a family member. Rand Hillman got deep into the whole cowboy poet/western music scene, performing at various shindigs and also contributing to the music on Buckaroo Bard, a 1988 documentary about cowboy poet Waddie Mitchell. Mrs. Hillman went back to her musical roots and self-released a CD full of yodeling songs and other western material, billed as Betty Adel, which may have been her maiden name. (No idea whether that second album came out... though I sure am curious about the Wild Honey band!)\n\nBeau Randall \"Beau Randall Records Presents...\" (Beau Randall Records, 196-?) (LP)\n\nA mega-barebones self-released LP, with all songs written by Mr. Randall... Plainly labeled as a demo set, it has absolutely no graphics, and a plain-old blank back cover. Raphael Beauvais Randall, aka Beauvais M. Randall, aka Beau Randall (d. 2003), was originally from New Orleans but moved to Decatur, Georgia probably right around the time this disc came out. According to his obituary -- which doesn't mention music at all -- Mr. Randall worked at The Atlanta Journal for forty-three years, and as near as I can figure, this album came out right around 1960, when some of the songs were copyrighted. He gives a New Orleans mailing address (maybe he was still using his family's address?) but very little other info. No date, no info about the musicians or producer, and nary a photo of the artist. A WWII veteran, he was probably about forty when this was made, though that's really just a guess on my part.\n\nDarlene Randel \"...Sings You Are My Man\" (Starway Records, 1978-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jack Logan & John Salisbury)\n\nA vanity album recorded in Nashville by a gal from Eudora, Kansas, just outside of Kansas City. Claudia Darlene Randel (1936-2015) wrote the title track, \"You Are My Man,\" as well as \"Okey Doke Yodel,\" both of which were also released as singles. She had a nice voice for country, and sounds like a dead ringer for Loretta Lynn on several tracks, although she struggled on high notes, and when she'd croon... Producer John Salisbury also contributed three originals, \"Baby Please Don't Take That Plane,\" \"Home Brew,\" and \"It Takes A Man (To Make A Woman Sing The Blues).\" He seems to have been under contract with Acuff-Rose publishing, and had material recorded by stars such as Sue Thompson and Charlie Walker. He had another Kansas connection: originally from the West Coast, Salisbury married singer Mary Taylor, and moved to Nashville around 1971; Taylor later retired to Coffeyville, Kansas, down by the Oklahoma border. Sadly, the backup musicians aren't identified, though I suppose Jack Logan had a stable of sidemen he worked with in the late 'Seventies; it seems likely this was recorded at his sound house, Studio 19, which the Logan brothers purchased in '74.\n\nDoc Randolph \"Call Me Country\" (Uplift Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Randolph M. Howes, M.D., Ph.D)\n\nNot a ton of info about this guy, although we were able to determine that he was Randolph M. Howes, M.D., Ph.D., a twang auteur from Louisiana who rather colorfully self describes as \"singer, plastic surgeon, general surgeon, scientist, writer, musician, composer, inventor, business entrepreneur and classic car collector,\" and according to the liner notes he was the director of the Institute For Plastic Surgery, in New Orleans. Nice work if you can get it, I guess. Mister... I mean Doctor Randolph lived in New Orleans, though he made the trek to Nashville to record this album, which is almost all his own original material, other than two classic country tracks, covers of \"Cold, Cold Heart\" and \"He's Got You.\" Unfortunately, no one thought to include the names of the musicians backing him, though I'm sure they included some of the finest pickers plastic surgery fees could provide. [Note: This was reissued digitally, apparently paired with another album (or perhaps some later singles?) released in 2014 as a combo package called Call Me Country/Luzianna Sportsman.]\n\nPhil Randoy \"Phil Sings\" (Randoy Corporation/Topaz Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThe very epitome of a \"private press\" vanity album, this set of folkie tunes pops up from time to time as a \"country\" record, though for the most part methinks twangfans can pass on it. Seattle, Washington amateur troubadour Phil Randoy covers some interesting material, including three songs by John Prine and a version of Kris Kristofferson's \"Jesus Was A Capricorn,\" but most of the songs were from artists such as John Denver, Kenny Loggins, Don McLean and Buffy Sainte Marie -- mainstream folkie-AOR types given a stripped-down acoustic homage. However, Randoy's low-impact renditions don't really add much to any of these songs... He was earnest and well-meaning, and there's a picture of him singing at a grade-school assembly, but nothing on here really catches fire. There are also two original songs written by Randoy, \"Voice\" and \"Mirror,\" again both in an earnest folk style... No date or recording info on this one, but I'd guess it's a 1974-76-ish affair, maybe even a little earlier.\n\nWayne Raney -- see artist discography\n\nBilly Ranger \"Country And Western Shindig\" (Wyncote Records, 1967-?) (LP)\n\nDespite the youthful promise of a folk-era shindig, this cheapo-label album is actually a fairly straightforward set of middle-aged country crooning, with modest musical backing -- not too poppy, but not too peppy, either. No idea who Billy Ranger really was, or who was backing him... But if you dig country dudes like Bill Anderson or Ernie Ford, or maybe even Claude Gray, this might appeal to you as well. There are a a couple of ho-hum cover songs (\"Green, Green Grass Of Home,\" anyone?) but most of these songs are fairly intriguing, lesser-known country tunes, poached from a wide range of artists, with standouts including versions of Justin Tubb's \"As Long As There's A Sunday\" and \"Honky Tonk Happy,\" a Curly Putnam song that Faron Young and Margie Singleton recorded as a duet back in '64. Not the most electrifying performances, but an intriguing repertoire.\n\nBilly Ranger & The Deputies \"The Sound Of Country\" (Wyncote Records, 1967-?) (LP)\n\nAlthough they came out around the same time and seem equally sketchy, this record is actually different than the Billy Ranger LP above, with no overlap of songs... Although there's no guarantee that the same musicians were involved in all the sessions! This album has a few interesting entries, including \"I'm From Missouri,\" \"A World I Can't Live In,\" \"Poncho Villa\" and \"How's My Ex Treating You.\" But who was Billy Ranger? Your guess is as good as mine!\n\nThe Rangers \"Proud To Be A Man\" (Century Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by B. Farris, C. Hamilton & B. Powell)\n\nStraight-up western/cowboy material with a surprising amount of original material by a band headquartered in Torrance, California. Four guys are pictured on the back cover, but not credited by name... I assumed that three of them were the same folks listed as producers -- B. Farris, C. Hamilton & B. Powell -- but even that set of information didn't get me too far. In addition to covers of a couple of cowboy oldies and songs from Johnny Bond, Stan Jones and the Sons Of The Pioneers, this album includes four originals credited to \"B. Powell\": the title track, \"Proud To Be A Man,\" along with \"Home Wasn't Built In A Day,\" \"Lover Man,\" and \"This Road I Ride.\" Most of those songs drew blanks while searching online, but finally one paid off: a fella named Bill Powell cut an undated single featuring \"Road I Ride\" and \"Home Wasn't Built In A Day\" on a private microlabel evocatively named Contest Recording And Publishing Company, presumably sometime before this album came out. The single gave an address in nearby Lomita, CA, a tiny enclave wedged between Torrance and Long Beach. I don't think this was the same Bill Powell who played lounge piano for fifty years in the Oak Room at the Alisal dude ranch in nearby Santa Barbara... but it's possible.\n\nThe Rangers \"The Rangers\" (Police Records, 1980-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Ham & Ralph Murphey)\n\nA different group than the California cowboys above... This was a vocal trio made up of Jerry, Terry and Wally Gilmore -- who were presumably brothers, though where they were from is pretty hard to track down.\n\nRank Strangers \"Rank Strangers\" (Pacific Arts, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Chris Darrow & Chester Crill)\n\nThis short-lived band was formed by Chris Darrow and songwriter Robb Strandlund, along with singer Cindy Edwards, who had all worked together on Strandlund's first solo album... They covered some oldies, like \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and Dan Penn's \"Do Right Woman,\" along with a bunch of originals, several gems by Chris Darrow. Overall the vibe was a little too folk-ish for me, though it was an interesting approach, much less rock-oriented than their Southern California contemporaries, and more anchored in the pre-Nashville stringband sounds of early rural artists such as the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. I always enjoy Strandlund's voice, and while Edwards added nice harmonies, when she's put in the foreground, it doesn't do much for me. Still, an intriguing and rewarding album, one of the lost nuggets of Michael Nesmith's fabled Pacific Arts label... Apparently there's a reissue edition that also includes some bonus tracks, with an alternate version of Strandlund's bar-room classic, \"Just Another Country Song,\" along with a cover of Hank Locklin's \"Send Me the Pillow You Dream On.\" Haven't heard that edition, though. [Note: not to be confused with the Swedish band of the same name.]\n\nJim Ransom \"Just Come Along For The Ride\" (Biscuit City Records, 1974) (LP)\n\nOriginally from New York state, folksinger Jim Ransom moved west in the 'Seventies and settled down in Denver, where he co-founded the Biscuit City label, which quickly became a focal point for the vibrant Colorado folk/acoustic/bluegrass scene. This was his first album, the prelude to a long career in low-key music making. (I have to confess, this looks too folkie for me to prioritize... But you never know. I might get around to it some day!)\n\nJim Ransom \"The Escape Of J. D. Mackenzie And Other Songs\" (Biscuit City Records, 1976) (LP)\n\nJim Ransom \"Ransom Notes\" (Biscuit City Records, 1977) (LP)\n\nOrrin Ranum \"The Country Voice Of Orrin Ranum\" (Love Productions, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Al Perry)\n\nThis album includes country classics like \"Four Walls,\" \"Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain,\" \"Phantom 309\" as well as standards like \"Distant Drums\" and \"Beautiful Dreamer\" -- also the promisingly titled \"The Wine And The Lord\" and \"There's That Smile Again\" (originals?) This was recorded in Tyler, Texas, with producer Al Perry playing guitar and steel, Glenn Worf on bass and Rags Allen playing piano, and Donna Love playing drums and singing backup. There's no information about when this came out, or where Mr. Ranum lived, but I think there's a good chance that he was from Wisconsin, and that this was recorded early in Glenn Worf's career, before he left Wisconsin to pursue his career in Nashville. Anybody got more info on this one?\n\nLynda Rask \"Lynda Rask\" (Stop Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tommy Hill)\n\nBorn in Battle Creek, Michigan, Lynda Rask made her professional debut at age eleven when she took the stage at the Green Valley Jamboree, a local venue hosted by hillbilly singer Rem Wall. She seems to have regularly performed as a teen, opening locally for numerous national stars before moving to Nashville around 1970 and recording this album while still in her teens. Ms. Rask also released a string of singles in the early 'Seventies, although an upcoming second album mentioned in a 1973 newspaper article may not have materialized.\n\nKenny Raska \"...And The Kickers\" (Camelot Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Charlie Booth, David McCumber, Anthony Puccio & L. W. Wright)\n\nSome indie honky tonkers from Houston, Texas, with almost all original material, including six songs by Kenny Raska and one by George Svbovda, along with covers of oldies by Webb Pierce, Charlie Walker and a countryfied version of Neil Diamond's \"Red Red Wine.\" Raska is kind of a croony singer, and the record has a distinctly 'Seventies production style, with keyboards and synths drifting around in the aether... But overall, nice stuff from the indie side of the mainstream country world. The guys in the band are listed by first name only: Kenny, Jerry, Jimmy, Larry, Tommy... anyone know their full names? And one more question: what exactly was it that they were kicking, anyway?\n\nThe Rathbun Country Music Show \"The Rathbun Country Music Show\" (Professional Artists Records, 1974) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Parvin Tramel)\n\nAn Opry-esque variety show from the Branson area, started in June, 1974 by Willis and Melvin Dickerson. The cast included Debbie and Steve Dickerson, Janice Pickering, Bill Pickering, comedian Bobby Allen, and others. Recorded in St. Louis.\n\nThe Ratliff Brothers \"The Other Side Of Me\" (The Ratliff Brothers, 1983-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Bob Barnhill, Ronnie Light, Mark Moseley & Mike Poston)\n\nSuper-ultra traditionalist/throwback twang from a pair of brothers, Ken and Tom Ratliff, who cover stuff by Jim & Jesse, Ernest Tubb, The Delmore Brothers, Ray Price and others, and who contribute their own original tune, \"The Other Side Of Me,\" to the country canon. I poked around for quite a while online but couldn't find any references to these guys online, although the back cover liner notes mention them playing venues such as Twitty City and Ernest Tubb's Midnight Jamboree. (The liners also mention their longtime goal of playing onstage at the Opry, which it doesn't sound like they'd done, at least not by the time they cut this album in Nashville.) They look like they were twins, and may have been from Kentucky; I'm pretty sure Tom Ratliff was not the same as the East Tennessee bluegrass picker and music store owner of the same name, who passed away in 2016. To be honest, this didn't really wow me... Their vocals sound so-so, perhaps because of the slick but indifferent musical backing..\n\nRattlesnake Annie (Anne McGowan) \"Rattlesnakes And Rusty Water\" (Rattlesnake Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Annie McGowan)\n\nA self-produced album by Texas-based songwriter Anne McGowan (aka Rattlesnake Annie), This is a pretty stripped-down and unpretentious, bluesy set, as much influenced by Jimmie Rogers and the '60s folkies as by more modern country types. Not mindblowing, but kind of an interesting footnote to the whole \"outlaw\" scene... Sorta similar to Townes Van Zandt, I suppose.\n\nJerry Rau \"Minnesota Minstrel\" (Train On The Island Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dakota Dave Hull & Jerry Rau)\n\nPart of the Twin Cities folk scene, Jerry Rau is backed here by Dakota Dave Hull and Peter Ostroushko. Although not really all that \"country,\" this disc does include a track called \"Honky Tonk Steel Whine,\" co-written by Hull and Rau.\n\nRalph Raulerson & The Countrymen \"Sing Your Favorites\" (Auburn Orange Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Jon Corneal & Leonard Walls)\n\nBandleader Ralph Raulerson hailed from Fort Myers, Florida and was active for several decades, first as a honkytonker and later as a bluegrass artist... On this 1970s album he's singing pure hard country, and sounds a lot like Merle Haggard on several tunes, with backing from David Brooks (bass), Roger LeBlanc (lead guitar), George Smith (fiddle), and Wes Hollingsworth on drums. In the 1980s, Raulerson could be heard singing at bluegrass festivals, but the stuff he was playing was more more of an old-school hillbilly boogie style, ala Wayne Raney. At any rate, he was a presence in Florida's traditional country scene for many, many years. Most of the songs on here are covers, though there's one tune written by Mr. Raulerson, \"It Breaks My Heart (To Let You Go)\" and one by lead guitar picker Roger LeBlanc, \"This Is The Place.\" Raulerson sings on three tracks, generously sharing the spotlight with the boys in the band, who handle the rest of the record. Highlights include Raulerson's original, as well as a semi-kooky, slightly wild, amped-up and completely countrified rendition of CCR's \"Proud Mary.\" Good stuff, with plenty of twang.\n\nRalph Raulerson & The Countrymen \"Country Gold: Ralph Raulerson Sings With The Countrymen\" (Music City Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Len Walls)\n\nA sizzling set of rambunctious country covers, with a little bit of rockabilly retro in the mix as well. The album opens with a cover of \"The Race Is On,\" done Buck Owens style, with hefty doses of Merle Haggard, Harlan Howard and Hank Williams to follow... The vibe is a mix of West Coast/Bakersfield Sound and Southern-fried rockabilly bop, with a simplicity and primitive, no-frills approach that sounds really damn good. In technical terms, this album is not well produced, and I'm willing to bet that Raulerson and his band could summon a much bigger, more electrifying sound when they played live, but even with the modest production values, this record oozes authenticity and vigor. It's fun. I'm a fan.\n\nThe Raunch Hands \"Pickin' And Singin' With The Raunch Hands\" (Epic Records, 1960) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Stephen B. Fossett)\n\nThese jovial fellas from Harvard were a straight-up '60s folk-parody group, not quite the kind of twang we're looking for here... But certainly worth mentioning if only to differentiate them from the '80s cowpunk band of the same name. The band included Fritz Donovan, Cam Fordyce, Al Goldman, Raph Henderson, Larry Reeder and Bill Wood. This originally came out in 1959 as a private press release sporting a plain white, no-art back cover, but was later picked up by Epic Records and reissued with fewer tracks, and some altered song titles. (No idea if the actual performances were the same or not, but if someone wanted to donate a copy of the first edition, I'd be glad to compare and contrast...)\n\nThe Raunch Hands \"Against The World... And Other Favorites\" (Epic Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nA swell set of satirical songs, this time including many politically themed numbers... Actually, come to think of it wouldn't it be cool if this were the same band as the '80s Raunch Hands? Like, if they'd been together all those years and just changed with the times? That would be awesome.\n\nLeon Rausch \"Doin' It Bob's Way\" (Discus Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Patterson)\n\nA tribute to western swing patriarch Bob Wills, with a bunch of classic tunes recorded by picker-singer Leon Rausch. Rausch was a veteran of both the Bob Wills band, and that of his brother Johnnie Lee Wills; he also led his own edition of the fabled Texas Playboys. He's backed here by David Brown (drums), Tommy Camfield (fiddle), Casey Dickens (drums), B. D. Griffin (also on fiddle), Tommy Hargrove (drums), Kenny Norman (steel guitar), David Odom (more fiddle), Johnny Patterson (lead guitar), Harlan Powell (bass), Lindsey Reist (piano), Buddy Wallace (still more fiddle), and Bobby Zellnew (on... fiddle!) This early 'Seventies homage was released in 1972, still in time to get the stamp of approval from Bob Wills himself, before he passed away in '73. The liner notes mention Leon Rausch helming a late-vintage lineup of the Playboys, a gig he took even further on numerous albums released as The Original Texas Playboys...\n\nRay & The Emeralds \"Transition...\" (Yellowstone Records, 1975-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ray Burdett & Tom Hersley)\n\nBass vocalist Ray Burdett seems to have been aiming at a sort of Dave & Sugar setup here, backed by three (unidentified) gals collectively known as the Emeralds. They toured with Billy Walker and did their time in Nashville, which is where this album was made. A young-looking fellow, Burdett was cut firmly from the same cheesy cloth as country elders such as Tennessee Ernie Ford or Jim Ed Brown, with a deep, rumbling voice that was (almost) worthy of William Lee Golden -- indeed, he sang bass with Hovie Lister and the Statesmen Quartet from 1973-77, presumably around the time this album was mad. Burdett opens with an amazingly earnest reading of \"Biff The Friendly Purple Bear\" (one of the all-time worst novelty songs of the early 'Seventies) and things are going along just fine until he shakes himself out of recitation mode and goes all uptempo on Roger Miller's super-perky \"I Believe In The Sunshine,\" one of several crypto-Christian, pseudo-secular anthemic pop songs he explores. The trouble is, once he starts singing Burdett reveals that he's got the vocal tone, but perhaps not the performing chops to really pull it off. This disc is a digression from his religious career, packed with covers of hits by John Denver, Carole King, Joe South (\"Games People Play\"), Olivia Newton-John (\"If You Love Me\" and \"Let Me Be There,\" in a nod towards the Oak Ridge Boys...) as well as Kris Kristofferson (\"Why Me Lord,\" of course, and \"Please Don't Tell Me\"). It's a nice snapshot of a would-be Top Forty country band, circa 1975-ish, with professional backing by a bunch of usual-suspect Nashvillers... but it has its limits as actual entertainment. Not surprisingly, Ray Burdett moved decisively back into proper Christian music, letting his little light shine down in Branson rather than the big city nightclubs.\n\nRay & Nell (Lunsford) \"Memories Gone By\" (1985-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Marshall Craven)\n\nSuper-duper old-time music, played by some fairly old-time musicians. This was a Lunsford family affair, led by Nellie Ray Lunsford (1908-1993) on autoharp, and Ray Lee Lunsford (1908-1989) picking banjo. They were both natives of Iredell County, North Carolina, and are joined by several family members on this intimate recording, including their son Clay Lunsford (banjo, guitar and mandolin), Dwayne Lunsford (rhythm guitar), along with Rhyne Dowell and Kim Felts playing bass, and fiddler David Johnson. The album is a mix of gospel songs and sentimental oldies, from \"White Dove\" and \"Old Country Church\" to \"The Weeks Are So Long,\" \"Old Folks At Home\" and \"Wildwood Flower.\" The Depression-era repertoire doubtless reflects the music of their youth, and those of who dig the real-deal old stuff might get a kick out of this album.\n\nAlan Ray \"Mr. Blue\" (Suncoast Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Joe Mills)\n\nNot a ton of information about this one... According to the liner notes, Alan Ray was originally from Saint Petersburg, Florida and had a radio show in Tampa, but he gave it all up when he moved to Nashville, in pursuit of a musical career. This album was recorded at Bradley's Barn with a mostly A-list studio crew, including folks like Jimmy Capps, Sonny Garrish, Billy Linneman and Willie Rainsford, as well as The Four Guys vocal group, and also a couple of musicians I don't recognize who may have been from Alan Ray's own band -- Reggie Allie on rhythm guitar, and bassist Eddie Regger. Although this was recorded in Tennessee, the album itself seems to have come out on a UK-based label, as that's the only place I've seen copies for sale.\n\nBurch Ray \"Woman On My Mind\" (Yellowstone Records, 197-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Burch Ray & Bill Porter)\n\nA singer from Miles City, Montana who caught the rockin' pneumonia, Burch Ray formed his first band, The Walkers, back around 1961 and cut his first record in '62... Though originally a rock band, they drifted towards country in later years, as heard on this disc from the 'Seventies. The album includes several originals, as well as rock, folk and country covers; two tracks -- a version of Buddy Knox's \"Playground\" and Buddy Holly's \"Well, All Right\" -- were released as a single back in 1965, recorded in LA with Glen Campbell on guitar and some members of Holly's old band, The Crickets. (As far as I can tell, this LP reissues those old tracks, along with newer material recorded with unidentified studio musicians.)\n\nBurch Ray \"Nashville Dreams\" (Yellowstone Records, 198-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ronnie Gant & Tommy Williams)\n\nThis album was recorded in Nashville with Nashville pros such as steel player Sonny Garrish, Bunky Keels on piano, and Tommy Williams on lead guitar and fiddle. The set is all Burch Ray originals, except for instrumental covers of Billy Armstrong (\"Fidjun\") and Bob Wills (\"Faded Love\"). Mr Ray comments on the music business in the wistful title track, \"Nashville Dreams\" and in the more philosophical \"In My Home Town I'm A Star.\" The album unfortunately is undated, though it features liner notes by Montana governor Thomas L. Judge, who left office in early 1981; Ray autographed a copy of this album in '81 so I'm guessing it came out around 1980-81.\n\nEddie Ray \"Old Lovers and Friends\" (JEGE Records, 1984) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Earl D. Adkins & Joe Deaton)\n\nA Nashville man through and through, Eddie Ray Russell was born in Kentucky but moved to Music City in 1961, where he mostly found work behind the scenes, as a producer and promotions man and to a lesser extent as a songwriter. Nicknamed \"the golden bear of country music,\" he seems to have done just about everything you can do in the music business, and claims to have composed over five hundred songs, including a slew of original tunes on this album. He also recorded numerous singles, dating back at least to the early 1970s, including one in 1980 called \"Whiskey Talking Woman,\" which generated some regional buzz. This LP was recorded at Joe Deaton's indie studio in Bristol, Virginia, and featured prolific local picker and luthier Chuck Tipton playing lead guitar, as well as Randy Maniss on drums, Tim Compton (bass), Brad Booher (piano), Jack Willis (fiddle) and Eddie Ray singing and playing rhythm guitar. I gotta say, though, it's pretty cheesy record, with Ray fully under the spell of then-superstar Kenny (Sauron) Rogers, dipping into hushed, overly earnest tones and even letting his voice crack a little under the emotive strain of such profound sincerity and heartbreak. He really goes over the top on a few tunes -- huge, swooping arrangements and everything. Some of it's okay, but mostly it's a little too early '80s for me. Worth a spin, though also you were warned.\n\nJohn Ray \"Woman On My Mind\" (Jef Tone Recordings, 197-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Greg Miller)\n\nA truly awful lounge vocals album, from a guy who at the time was holding down a gig at the Chalet Inn, in Gaylord, Michigan. This disc is packed with 'Seventies hits and material ranging from country chestnuts to acoustic-oriented AOR, stuff like \"Tie A Yellow Ribbon,\" \"I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song\" and \"I'll Be Your Baby Tonight.\" On the country side of things, there are spectacularly cheesy renditions of \"Green, Green Grass Of Home\" and \"Now And Then There's A Fool Such As I.\" I'm not really into the whole mocking-cheesy-musicians-on-old-lounge-albums, but this disc is a standout in the genre. The band was okay, but Mr. Ray's super-schmaltzy Elvis-style vocals are -- honestly -- pretty challenging.\n\nLeda Ray \"Hits The Road\" (Allied Artists, 1974-?) (LP)\n\nOriginally from Raleigh, North Carolina, singer Leda Ray made her way to Nashville, and cut a string of singles on the Allied Artists label starting in the early 1970s... There's no date on this album, but several of the songs on here were copyrighted to Ms. Ray in late 1973, so I'm gonna guess it's a 1974 album. The cover songs include Wanda Jackson's \"Two Separate Barstools,\" \"Rose Garden\" and \"Sunday Morning Coming Down,\" which were all hits in 1970, so it could have been even earlier. Anyway, I'm not sure what happened with Ms. Ray's career -- she cut a bunch of discs, got some mentions in the press playing telethons and whatnot, but at some point she packed up and moved to Sanford, North Carolina, where she opened a coffeehouse called Moka Joe's Cafe. This album seems to have been a songwriter's demo set, packed with original songs -- most (including two credited to Leda Ray) were copyrighted by Kilrey Publishing, which seems to be a concatenation of her name and Bill Killian's. Other composers include Carol Jones and Clay Price, though oddly enough one song, \"Crying In Color\" is credited to Clay Price on the album, but copyrighted by Leda Ray in '73. Who knows. Ray seems to have quit her Nashville career rather abruptly, though she did record a couple of singles for the Illinois-based Nashville North label, including one with neo-trad honkytonker Dallas Wayne(!). I'm not sure if she was attached to any local \"opry\" type shows, but it seems likely that at least for a while she was affiliated with the Nashville North club, in Chicago. Later, in the 2000s, back in Sanford, Ray started up a new band, and was available to play regional gigs as recently as 2019.\n\nRandy Ray \"Live At The Nashville Palace\" (Randy Ray Records, 1982) (LP)\n\nAlthough Top Forty star Randy Travis seemed to appear, fully formed from the head of Proteus when he hit the charts in '86, it turns out he also had a past as an indie-label artist... There was this live album as well as a couple of singles in the late '70s under the name of Randy Traywick... Good luck tracking this stuff down -- I just barely learned of its existence myself! But I am mighty curious...\n\nFrank Raye \"This One's For You Mister Elmer\" (Jomar Records, 198--?) (LP)\n\nI'm not trying to be catty or mean, but objectively speaking, this is a pretty painful album to work your way through, the very kind of ultra-amateurism that certain hipster folk expect to hear from \"private press\" records. Stanton, North Dakota's Frank Raye was one of the many hopeful locals who made their way to the Tibor family's Jomar Studios in Hebron to set their music on wax... In the liner notes he says he'd played in Bismarck's regional country scene for about twelve years, and had \"recently\" developed his own one-man-band act, which I guess is what's on display here, in all its monochromatic glory. (There are no musician credits, though I suspect the Tibor Brothers provide some assistance, although the arrangements don't show much variety in tempo or style -- thumping percussion, minimal, rhythmic keyboards and a little noodly guitar, all taken at the same moderate, unvarying pace.) Mr. Raye seems to have been aiming for a gruff Waylon Jennings vibe, and swallows his phrasing in overly-stylized, guttural passages which might have been more effective in a more well-developed musical atmosphere, but quickly wear thin in this setting, with one thinly-produced track after another, and little variation between them. I couldn't find any real information about Mr. Raye online, and suspect \"Frank Raye\" was a stage name. Similarly, although warmly praised in the back cover liner notes, \"Mister Elmer\" remains a mystery as well. No release date, though comparison to other Jomar albums places this somewhere in the late 1980s, maybe around 1988, or '89.\n\nThe Raymond Avenue Ramblers \"The Raymond Avenue Ramblers\" (The Music Will Play, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Brooks, D. B. Brown & Debbie Macfarlan)\n\nFormed in 1976, the Raymond Avenue Ramblers were a stylistically diverse, bluegrass-y string band made up of several professors, students and staffers at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York (Raymond Avenue being the main road running along the western edge of the campus.) A longtime mainstay of the Hudson Valley roots music scene, the original band included Tom Brooks on bass, D. B. Brown (lead guitar), Debbie Macfarlan (guitar), Phil Seitz (mandolin) and David Yurkofsky on violin. Along with covers of folks like Albert E. Brumley and Hazel Dickens, this album includes one original written by Brown, and three by Macfarlan. With slowly shifting lineups and set lists, the group performed together for several decades, with onetime Dean of Students, D. B. Brown at the core. Around 2009, they changed their name to the Roundabout Ramblers, although I believe this was their only album released under either name. By the way, this will all be on the test.\n\nDavid Rea \"Maverick Child\" (Capitol Records, 1969) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Felix Pappalardi & David Rea)\n\nA well-regarded folk-scene sideman, Ohio-born singer-guitarist David Rea (1946-2011) moved to Canada in his teens and kicked off his career in the early 1960s as a sideman for Gordon Lightfoot, later performing with Ian & Sylvia, Jesse Winchester and other stars of the era... By the time he got his own record deal, Rea had moved into more of a rock mode, albeit with strong currents of country in there as well. He worked for a few years with blues-rocker Felix Pappalardi, and Pappalardi's new band, Mountain, co-writing the sludge-y hard-rock anthem, \"Mississippi Queen,\" which became a big hit. He continued working as a studio session player and sideman, including a brief stint with an early-'Seventies lineup of the English folk-rock band Fairport Convention. Jinkies!\n\nDavid Rea \"By The Grace Of God\" (Capitol Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bob D'Orleans, Felix Pappalardi & David Rea)\n\nDavid Rea \"Slewfoot\" (Columbia-Windfall Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by David Rea & Bob Weir)\n\nAlthough this one's mostly on the radar for Deadheads, standard-issue twangfans will wanna check it out too, particularly for the fine covers of real-deal country songs that Rea opens the album with, notably Tom T. Hall's \"The Year That Clayton Delaney Died\" and the Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner duet \"Run That By Me One More Time,\" which spotlights a dead-on Loretta Lynn imitation by Darlene DiDomenico. Rea excels on the copious cover tunes, and picks some doozies, even including one by UK folkie Dave Swarbrick(!) along with some R&B songs by Chuck Berry and Ike Turner that kind of get swallowed up into the early '70s boogie-rock void. Speaking of which, let's circle back to the Dead now... David Rea was definitely in the Dead-o-Sphere, in a major way... His band features Bob Weir, both as a producer and guitarist, Keith and Donna Godchaux, as well as folks from the New Riders Of The Purple Sage and other orbiting musicians: bassist John Kahn, drummer Spencer Dryden, Matthew Kelly (from the band Kingfish), Buddy Cage on pedal steel and even fiddler Richard Greene and post-bop saxophonist Charles Lloyd. The originals on here by Rea are mostly spacey, yearning, folk-rock-boogie tunes, with great concern for capital \"L\" Love, and it sounds perhaps as if Rea was really hoping that the Dead or some of their pals would pick them up to record. Anyway, this is a pretty decent hippie twang album, at least when he is being twangy. Definitely worth a spin.\n\nBill Reader & Barbara Alan \"Together\" (Hawk Records, 197--?) (LP)\n\nNot a lot of info on this one... It's a decent, if low-key country/pop duets set featuring singers Barbara Alan and Bill Reader, modestly backed by an anonymous studio crew whose strongest member was the pedal steel player. Reader seems to be the onetime pop-rockabilly singer Bill Reeder (sic), who recorded a few singles in the early 'Sixties for labels such as Fernwood and Hi Records. (Which would explain why they cover pop oldies like \"Playboy\" and \"Searching.\") I honestly can't tell if this is the same Barbara Alan who recorded the 1978 In Nashville album, though I think it was... If so, this looks (and sounds) like an earlier album, possibly from around 1972-74: he sings a version of the Statler Brothers \"Bed Of Rose's,\" which was a hit in '71, and the general countrypolitan vibe on several tracks has a definite early 'Seventies feel. Sadly, there are no composer credits -- although most of the tracks are cover tunes, there are a couple of uptempo numbers showcasing Alan in a vaguely Wanda Jackson-ish mode which are album highlights. The album opens with the mildly raunchy \"A Kind Of A Woman\" and closes on \"Don't Leave Without Me,\" both of which I think are originals. Not an earthshaking album, but it has its charms.\n\nJoe Reagan \"Memory Of Cowboy Copas\" (Crown Records, 196--?) (LP)\n\nNot quite sure where crooner Joe Reagan was from, or when he cut these tracks, but I'd guess around 1963 or '64, just after Copas and Reeves passed away. In all honesty, I gotta say Reagan sounded kinda geefy, foghorning in a very exaggerated, mannered baritone, he covers some nice old country tunes with pretty solid, if rather minimal, country backing. The band had a good steel player, for sure, although the rhythm stays pretty sedate. I can't say I'm that into his voice -- personally, I'll just stick with the originals. [Note: the album below, Tribute To Cowboy Copas, appears to be a different edition of the same album.]\n\nJoe Reagan \"A Tribute To Cowboy Copas\" (Crown Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThis album was also issued on the Coronet imprint as Hits Made Famous By Cowboy Copas\n\nJoe Reagan \"A Tribute To Jim Reeves\" (Wyncote Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nToby Rean & The Common People \"Outa Space\" (Crown Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nSinger-picker Tobe Rean Mintner (1936-1976) was a minor figure but longtime fixture in the West Coast/Bakersfield country scene of the 1950s and '60s, playing alongside stars such as Merle Haggard and Buck Owens, as well as his own gigs at venues such as the Stallion Club and on some Southern California military bases. This album is a little weird in that it's packaged as though it was a cheapo exploitation album for the psychedelic rock scene, when actually it's pretty solidly a country thang. Well, mostly: the first track, \"Outa Space,\" is a hyperactive psych-funk instrumental based on a Billy Preston song, with a punchy rhythm section and lots of over-the-top wah-wah guitar work... But then things abruptly turn towards twang, and while charmingly down-to-earth, it's also a little bit rickety overall. Rean's mix of straight-up twang and strained comedy material reminds me quite a bit of Bill Carlisle, combining limited vocal talent with plucky energy and a somewhat random, see-what-sticks attitude. You can hear both desperation and resignation in these sessions, as though he knows it ain't really gonna work, but you never really know, right? So there are some interesting country tunes on here, though overall the album is a slapdash, low-budget affair, and like most of the el-cheapo Crown LPs, there often an undercurrent electrified, rock-flavored music courtesy of whichever underemployed hippies they had come in and play on the sessions; Rean's own live band included fellow Crown artist Leon Copas and steel player Frankie Hardcastle, and it's likely they play on here as well. Maybe not the greatest record ever, but certainly worth checking out if you're into Crown Records kitsch, and also another footnote in the saga of the Bakersfield Sound.\n\nFrankie Reb \"The Frankie Reb Show\" (Linda Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kenny Wallis)\n\nRebe And Rabe \"If I Can Just Make It In\" (Linda Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Kenny Wallis)\n\nRevin \"Rebe\" Gosdin (1924-1978) and Auburn J.C. \"Rabe\" Perkins (1923-2005) were an old-timey gospel duo from Alabama, modeled on the Blue Sky Boys and the Louvins. The pair met while working in a local cotton mill, and began performing professionally in the 1930s and '40s. For many years they had a show on radio station WVOK, Birmingham as well as on WBAM in Montgomery, where Gosdin also had a day job in the early 1960s. They recorded prolifically for a while, but gradually gave up their music career, several years before Gosdin passed away. They continued to perform and record together sporadically; an early 'Seventies reunion included an appearance at Bill Monroe's fabled Bean Blossom Festival. This album includes Rebe Gosdin on mandolin and Rabe Perkins on guitar, as well as Wayne Cobb Jr. (drums), Buddy Davis (guitar), Junior Maharrey (bass) and John Probst playing piano. [Also of note is Gosdin's nephew, honkytonk balladeer Vern Gosdin, who became a chart-topping country star in 1970s and '80s.]\n\nThe Rebel Yell Band \"The Rebel Yell Band\" (198--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Melinda Grable, Larry Nix & Andy Black)\n\nThis Memphis-based group played a mix of bluegrass and country and apparently did extensive travel on multiple USO tours in the late '70s. That's according to the group's drummer, John Lodholz (aka Johnny Washboard) who later moved to Nashville, where he landed a gig in Mark Collie's band, as well as finding studio work... The group also included a guy named John Anderson, although as far as I know, he's not the swingin' dude from Florida. Not a lot of info about these guys out there... Anyone who remembers them, feel free to get in touch!\n\nElton Record \"The Maine Man In Nashville\" (Eljan Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Al Harris & Bernie Vaughn)\n\nA stalwart of the Maine country music scene, singer Elton Record cut this album with a little assist from Conway Twitty's backing band, the Twitty Birds. I'm not sure if was in the band at the time, or just finagled a way to get them in the studio. This set is mostly cover songs, though the originals include \"Bernadine\" and \"Pennies, Nickels And Dimes.\" The Record family own country bar in Mechanic Falls called the Silver Spur, which is also the site of the Maine Country Music Hall Of Fame. Mr. Record was induced into the Hall the same year it opened, back in 2008.\n\nRed And Murphy & Co. \"Riding Around On Saturday Night\" (Eljan Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Tom Markham)\n\nRed And Murphy & Co. \"Red And Murphy & Co.\" (Eljan Records, 1977) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Al Harris & Bernie Vaughn)\n\nThe Red Birds \"...Sing And Play Your Favorites\" (Ben Records, 1967-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Bill Nix & John Hacha)\n\nA swell set by a family band from Fort Wayne, Indiana, moving through old-school (1940s-ish) sentimental and novelty country tunes, along with standards such as \"Bill Bailey,\" \"Home Sweet Home,\" and a gospel tune of two. The dad, Joe Taylor, wrote a song called \"He's A Cowboy Auctioneer\" -- which became a hit for Tex Ritter back in 1950 -- and worked steadily in the Midwest for decades to come. This edition of the band also includes his sister-in-law, Patti Corbett, who was an original founding member of the Indiana Redbirds, back in the late 'Forties, as well as fiddler-guitarist Jay \"Pee Wee\" Dickerson, who lays down some sweet, jazzy licks. Also notable here is Taylor's eleven-year old daughter, Paula Jo Taylor, who chugs her way through a version of the Bob Morris instrumental, \"Buckaroo,\" -- her performance is impressive for a pre-teen, but only a faint foreshadowing of the days, decades later when Paula Jo would go viral as the \"Granny Guitarist,\" a smoking hot chicken-picker championed by rocker Nikki Sixx and profiled in Guitar World magazine. Parts of this album seem to have been recorded live, though others, such as Patti Corbett's recitation, \"Letter To Mom,\" notably are not. All in all, this is a swell set -- there's no steel guitar on here, but the Merle Travis-y guitar pickin' more than makes up for it! Nice little record.\n\nThe Red Boot Boys \"Fire!\" (Williamson Recording Studio, 197-?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Stan Willamson & Terry Wilson)\n\nThis band was formed by several middle-aged members of the Greeneville, Tennessee fire department, including producer Stan Williamson on keyboards, Steve Morris on pedal steel, Marty Kaufman on fiddle and Steve Kaufman on banjo and guitar, as well as drummer Marty Llewellyn. Other than a couple of public domain oldies, it's mainly original material, including a few tunes written by guys who apparently weren't in the band, Johnny Jones and Don Williamson. They also released at least a couple of albums as cassette-only records, including the gospel-oriented Songs Of Inspiration and a concert album, Live From Rutgers University.\n\nCharlie Red \"Mother Lode Minstrel\" (G&J Motherlode Productions, 1980) (LP)\n\nNear as I can figure, this fella, Charles Rovenstine, was a modern-day folk minstrel who played gigs up in Angel's Camp and around Sacramento, California, up in the so-called Gold Country. His repertoire spanned historical-ish songs like \"Streets Of Laredo\" and \"The Saga Of The Hotel Leger\" and Utah Phillips' \"Daddy What's A Train,\" as well as good-natured novelty numbers, including several songs by one of my favorite songwriters, Dick Feller: \"Uncle Hiram And The Homemade Beer\" and \"Money, Trouble And Love.\" Charlie Red had a nice, straightforward presentation -- he's not super-charismatic or a particularly arresting performer, but he's completely likeable and sincere, and certainly had good taste in music. Rovenstine played shows across California well into the mid-1980s, though I'm not sure how many albums he made... Maybe just these two?\n\nCharlie Red \"Skinny Dippin' \" (Carco Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Charlie Red & Mark Welborn)\n\nBuddy Red Bow \"BRB\" (First American Records, 1980) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dik Darnell)\n\nA singer, composer and actor, Warfield Richards \"Buddy\" Red Bow (1948-1993) was a Lakota tribal member who grew up on the Pine Ridge reservation in Red Shirt, South Dakota, near Rapid City. In his teens he decided to become an actor, and landed a part in the 1962 classic, How The West Was Won, followed by a few other small roles in years to come; he additionally scored the soundtrack to the 1972 documentary, Hard Rider. After serving in Vietnam as a Marine, Red Bow focussed on his musical career, crafting an canny mix of country and Native American musical themes. Though this album includes a few cover songs, it's mostly his own originals, with tracks such as J.D. Loudermilk's \"Indian Reservation,\" Red Bow's own \"Indian Love Song\" and \"South Dakota Lady.\" The musicians include Buddy Red Bow on vocals and guitar, with Bud Abbott (bass), John Bergeron (piano), San Bressard (guitar), Billy Cox (guitar), Dik Darnell (synthesizer), Jimmy Ibbotson (guitar), John Macy (pedal steel), Jimmy Thompson (drums), and others.\n\nBuddy Red Bow \"Journey To The Spirit World\" (Tatanka Records, 1983) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Dik Darnell)\n\nAlong with a reprise of his song, \"Indian Love Song,\" this album pursues strong cultural themes and includes several songs with political themes addressing the economic hardships imposed on first nation people, the vanishing frontier, as well as spiritual quests and the relationship of indigenous people to the natural world. The electrified music is slightly manic and rock-influenced, but still fits comfortably into the country music vibe of the times, with stylistic callbacks to outlaw icons such as Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings, and most notably to Billy Joe Shaver, whose vocal style is a lot like Red Bow's. Though the arrangements may be a little hard-edged and brash, the lyrics are evocative and heartfelt; definitely worth a spin.\n\nBuddy Red Bow \"Black Hills Dreamer\" (Tatanka Records, 1995)\n\n(Produced by Dik Darnell & Mark Derryberry)\n\nRed Heart \"Introducing Red Heart\" (SRC Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\nThis was a Coeur d'Alene bar band, playing all rock oldies and honky tonk covers... The group included Jim Sherman, Steve Pierre, Jim Boardway and Armando Velazquez (who is described as \"of Mexican descent,\" which gives you an idea of how times have changed...) There's no label or year listed on jacket or LP, so this one's a bit of a mystery.\n\nThe Red Horse Band \"Borderland\" (AMI Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by John Beland & Jerry Abbott)\n\nA country-rock set by a red dirt band out of Sherman, Texas which worked as the road band for the Flying Burrito Brothers in 1983-84. They get production assistance by erstwhile Burrito member John Beland, who had earlier produced a single for the group, as well as a solo album (also on AMI) with keyboard player Jimmie Grokett. For whatever reasons, Grokett was no longer part of the band by the time Red Horse made it to the studios in Hendersonville, Tennessee, although his album seems to have been recorded at basically the same time as this one. (That must have been a fun road trip for Beland, who produced both records...) About half the songs on here were written by John Beland, with additional material by Glenn Frey, Hugh Moffatt, Sonny Throckmorton, and others... The lineup for this album included Danny Batchelor on lead vocals and guitar, Benny Vincent on lead and two new guys, bassist Bob Campbell and Jeff Williams playing drums. No sign of Jimmie Grokett though... Red Horse previously released a single, back in Texas, and there's a mysterious comment in these liner notes about those two songs, \"...master tape to WAITING ON A SOUTHERN TRAIN and WHISKEY TO ME was erased at Precision Audio in Dallas, Texas. THANKS, Rick.\" Hmmm. Maybe there's some connection here to Mr. Grokett leaving the band? At any rate, these guys seemed to know how to hold a grudge... Probably best that we don't know the whole story.\n\nThe Red River Boys \"Red River\" (Jerry Free Records, 1986) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Ansley Fleetwood, Jerry Free & Pat Holt)\n\nThese young fellas were the winners of the fifth annual country music \"battle of the bands\" contest sponsored by Wild Turkey distillery in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. Unlike the previous year's champions, an earnest group calling itself Crossfire, these guys were lucky enough to have their names included on the back cover, although no breathless blurb touting them as hometown heroes and telling us where they were from. The Red River Boys included four vocalists -- Dave Alford, Reuben Buck, Tim Buchanan and Bill Sealy -- with instrumental backing by guitarist Paul Carrol, Mike Cunningham (keyboards), Trevor Reddick (bass), Dave Steinquist (drums) and presumably some studio musician playing pedal steel(?) They seem to have been from Tennessee -- Reddick and Steinquist played together in a jazz combo at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, where Steinquist was an assistant professor... Or at least that's what they were up to in 1987-88. The folks at Jerry Free Productions recycled the album art on at least two of these albums... another entry in the annals of stock cover art.\n\nThe Red Ryder Band \"The Red Ryder Band\" (Decameron Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by J. M. McCarthy)\n\nA modestly shaggy, relatively clean-cut outlaw twangband from the Great Plains... Although they recorded in Omaha, Nebraska, this was an Iowa-based band... The group included lead singer Jack Dahlke on guitar, Betty Frank (guitar and piano), Duane Gallagher (bass), Steve Mether (drums) and Jon Smith (lead guitar and mandolin) with additional steel guitar by Chuck Lettes. Except for a cover of Gram Parsons' \"Sin City,\" all the songs are originals, including six tracks credited to Mr. Dahlke. This band was together for several years, and like many beloved local groups they fanned out into various subsequent bands and seem to have done a reunion show or two over the years...\n\nRed Shadow \"Live At The Panacea Hilton\" (Physical World Records, 1975) (LP)\n\nNow, I'm not saying that this record is any good (wouldn't know) or that it's particularly \"country,\" just that it exists and that it's very, very 1970s. Self-identified as \"the economics rock'n'roll band,\" these longhaired commies (and I mean that literally) met while attending grad school at the University of Michigan and brought their hard-left socialist critiques to The People in the form of hippie-rock musical harangues, with song titles such as \"Stagflation,\" \"Understanding Marx\" and \"Commodity Fetishism.\" Whoo-hoo! Yeahhhhh!! Party down!!!\n\nRed Shadow \"Better Red\" (Physical World Records, 1979) (LP)\n\n\"Marx Had A Word For It,\" \"Daddy, You've Been Played,\" \"History Will Take Me Home,\" \"Labor Is Value...\" So many memories of slow-dancing to these songs at so, so many homecoming celebrations. Really takes you back, doesn't it?\n\nRed, Wilder, Blue \"Red, Wilder, Blue\" (Warner/Pentagram Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Al Schmidt)\n\nWhile it's not much of a country album, this rock record is worth noting for twangfans because it's by an early band of future Texas outlaw, Michael Ballew, who was kickin' it on the West Coast for a few years trying to make it as a rocker. It's mostly a mediocre mix of contemporary styles: LA sunshine pop, CSNY-style group harmonies and a bit of hard/psych, as heard on their riffy cover of Jesse Colin Young's \"Darkness.\" I think they were mostly aiming for the Crosby Stills & Nash sound, and they probably could have been more successful if the album had been better produced, or rather, better edited: the songs drift and meander quite a bit, and generally don't feel all that cohesive. But if you're just into obscure '70s soft rock and soft-psych, you might wanna check this one out; definitely not much overt twang involved here.\n\nRed Willow Band \"Red Willow Band\" (Lost Records, 1976) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Chris Gage & Hank Harris)\n\nSouth Dakota's answer to Asleep At The Wheel, the Red Willow Band blended country, bluegrass, blues and western swing, often led by their fiddlers, but with strong backing by the rest of the band, which included sleek pedal steel and a versatile piano work from Chris Gage, one of the band's two lead singers, along with Hank Harris. They produced two fine albums and toured extensively between 1974-82, and like many regional bands have reunited frequently over the years. The full band on this album included Barry Carpenter, Marley Forman, Chris Gage, Hank Harris, Kenny Putnam and Dale Saukerson\n\nRed Willow Band \"Note For Note\" (Lost Records, 1978) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Barry \"Byrd\" Burton)\n\nOn their second album, RWB traveled to Nashville to record at the Jack Clement studios and stretched out into more ornate pop and jazz stylings, but only on a tune or two -- there's still plenty of great honkytonk and western swing material. A couple of songs feature surprising approximations of more contemporary commercial country sounds -- not enough for them to crack into the charts, but another opportunity to show the band's musical chops and stylistic breadth. All in all, even with the fancy stuff added into the mix, this album was pretty similar to the first, and worth checking out as well. They were a really good band!\n\nRed Willow Band \"Way Back When: A Compilation\" (Moonhouse Records, 1999)\n\nThis handy-dandy CD gathers the songs from the RWB's two long-out-of-print albums, Red Willow Band and Note For Note, a fun, comprehensive collection with good sound quality and a wealth of strong original material. Unfortunately, there are no significant liner notes, nothing to give the story of the band itself, but the music is pretty impressive. Chris Gage compiled the disc, and decided to mix the two albums together, so the more country-sounding tracks from the first album are peppered into the later stuff from '78. I think there were also a few reunion records, though I don't have solid information about thise releases.\n\nLeon Redbone -- see artist discography\n\nJohnny Redd \"Country Hot\" (JRS Records, 19--?) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Johnny Redd)\n\nA hard-rockin' bar-band/outlaw country group from Palmdale, California, with canny covers of Waylon & Willie, Delbert McClinton and Ray Griff... Singer Johnny Redd pens a trio of originals, \"Sunshine,\" \"Lonesome\" and \"Party Party Party,\" while bass player Mike Hufford adds \"Just Her Friend\" into the mix. Though not part of the band, a guy named Big Lloyd Carlson sings lead on a version of Dennis Linde's \"Burning Love.\" I couldn't find out much about these guys online -- dunno when this album came out (looks like late '70s/early '80s) or if the band played live. Anybody out there have more info?\n\nKamie Redell \"I've Got The Country In Me\" (Blue Gem Records, 1982) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Pete Martin & Bill Kredel)\n\nNot totally sure where Redell was from, but this album was recorded in Torrence, California, while the label is credited as from LA proper... The songs appear to be all originals, including songs like \"From Home To Waiting Tables,\" \"Troubled Mind, Lonely Body\" and \"Forget Me Tomorrow.\" Her band included Peter Apodaca on bass, Brad Fenton (steel guitar and banjo), Pete Martin (piano), Pete McIntire (fiddle), Lee Stanley (lead guitar), and several others.\n\nTeddy Redell \"The JLL Sound Of Teddy Redell\" (Collector Records, 1972) (LP)\n\nArkansas-born rock-and-boogie pianist Teddy Redell (1937-2014) was one of the many American rock'n'rollers who found a haven with European audiences in the 'Seventies, recording this album for a Dutch label while doing gigs abroad and at home. Though he touches on familiar 'Fifties rock styles, it's worth noting he also connects with rockabilly's country roots, covering a couple of oldies by country piano plunker Moon Mullican.\n\nTeddy Redell \"Teddy Redell Is Back\" (White Label Records, 1979) (LP)\n\nThe band on this album included Teddy Redell on piano (and vocals), Fred Dale Douglas (bass), Sam Querry (bass) ad drummer Carl R. Stevens. There were some later recordings as well, though I don't have all the info about those...\n\nRedeye \"Redeye\" (Pentagram Records, 1971) (LP)\n\nThis LA-based rock band was apparently a one-hit wonder, placing one single (\"Games\") in the Pop Top 30 before losing their mojo and drifting into obscurity. Singer/guitarist Douglas \"Red\" Mark had previously been in another moderately successful band called the Sunshine Company; I'm not sure what happened to any of these guys after they disbanded. Although they got into twang on their second album, there are few traces of country music here, basically it's a rock'n'roll record, lots of guitar in the early-'70s hard rock style.\n\nRedeye \"One Man's Poison\" (Pentagram Records, 1973) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Al Schmitt)\n\nTheir second album definitely had a more \"country\" feel to it, a rugged, clattersome, rock'n'twang style that recalls the classic early-'70s Grateful Dead albums, as well as stoner jug-band rockers like Jesse Colin Young and the Youngbloods... It's not bad! Definitely a rock band, but they were having fun going into hoedown mode, and this record has a lot to recommend it... It's basically hippie rock, but good for the style. The twangiest tunes are \"Walter Why Knott\" and the spacier \"Beginning To End,\" with the best tracks on here being the ones that are most nakedly imitative of the Dead. The lineup here included drummer Bob Bereman, Dave Hodgkins (guitar), Bill Kirkham (bass) and Douglas Mark on guitar and vocals. Worth a spin.\n\nLarry Redmon \"First Time Around\" (Country Crossings, 1979) (LP)\n\nA sweet, well-produced set of mellow outlaw honkytonk by Lexington, Kentucky's Larry Redmon. On some songs he presents himself as a blatant Waylon Jennings soundalike (which is fine by me) though in addition to the outlaw growling, there's a fairly wide stylistic range. The album is packed with Redmon originals, including one co-written with Greg Austin, as well as one song by Chuck Pyle, a cover of Guy Clark's \"Desperados Waitin' For A Train,\" one from Hank Junior, and the Latin-tinged pop hit \"Come A Little Bit Closer,\" which had already entered into the country canon in 1977 through a hit duet version recorded by Johnny Duncan and Janie Fricke. All in all, this is a pretty solid record for such an off-the-radar artist. Worth tracking down!\n\nRedwing \"Redwing\" (Fantasy Records, 1971) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Russ Gary & Redwing)\n\nThese SF Bay Area roots-rockers had a funky vibe reminiscent of Little Feat, while also colored by John Fogerty and CCR -- and The Band, too, of course. Previously, the Sacramento-based band had been a straight-up rock group called Glad, but when band member Timothy B. Schmit left to join an early lineup of Poco, the group reformed around guitarists Andrew Samuels, Ron Floegel and Tom Phillips and got into a looser, funkier roots-music sound, and are considered one of the classic early California country-rock bands. For me, most of the songs on this debut disc go too far into the \"heavy\" boogie-rock sound of the time, although on Side Two they delve more into twang, notably with their cover of Mickey Newbury's \"(Tell Me Baby) Why You Been Gone So Long\" as well as their funky jam version of the Jimmie Rodgers oldie, \"California Blues,\" as well as their Band-like original \"Oh Maggie,\" which is possibly the catchiest track on the record. Redwing were one of the most promising, on-the-edge-of-fame bands on the early-'70s Northern California rock scene, but it never quite clicked in the end. This disc is worth checking out, though maybe more rock-oriented than some twangfans might like. See for yourself... they were pretty groovy, man!\n\nRedwing \"What This Country Needs\" (Fantasy Records, 1972) (LP)\n\n(Produced by Russ Gary)\n\nThis one was kind of disappointing, at least from a twangfan's point of view. They set aside the funky rural vibe they pioneered on their first album, concentrating instead of crunchier, early-'70s boogie-rock, which was doubtless more salable then, but doesn't hold up so well now. Well, maybe there are jam-band or heavy rock aficionados who will be all over this album, but I thought it was a bummer, considering the innovation and diversity of the surrounding albums. Oh, well. I guess they were just looking for a hit.\n\nRedwing \"Take Me Home\" "
