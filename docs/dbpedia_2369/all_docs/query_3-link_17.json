        "text": "â€” One of the most appealing tunes on the new album by English folkrock doyenne Linda Thompson is called \"Do Your Best for Rock 'n' Roll,\" which is a motto she and the members of her family take quite seriously: Proceed to the T section at your favorite record shop this week and you won't just find Thompson's CD, Versatile Heart - you'll also come across new discs by Linda's ex-husband Richard and their son Teddy. Each is worth picking up.\n\nLinda first found fame in the late '70s and early '80s with a string of duo albums she made with Richard, who by that time was already an established folk-rock star thanks to his role in Fairport Convention. The pair's music traced the contours of their tumultuous marriage; it's not easy to think of a record that better describes the travails of divorce than their final salvo, 1982's Shoot Out the Lights.\n\nLinda released her solo debut, One Clear Moment, in 1985, but an extreme anxiety disorder called hysterical dysphonia sidelined her until 2002, when at long last she issued her wryly titled sophomore set, Fashionably Late.\n\nAt only a half-decade in the making, Versatile Heart (Rounder) sets something of a land-speed record for Linda.\n\nBut the new album hardly seems like a rush job: This is smartly arranged, deeply felt roots music that sounds fresh and modern without sacrificing the timeless spirit that roots music is supposed to offer. In the title track, for instance, Linda upbraidsa former lover- \"You say you love me, I bet you do/Too bad you never told me so\"- while a small brass combo blows politely behind her. (Is she speaking to Richard here? Hmm: \"Stay on the road, you two-faced fool/That way we'll never come to blows.\")\n\nTeddy appears throughout Versatile Heart, as does his sister Kamila, who wrote \"Nice Cars,\" a hushed folk-soul meditation that demonstrates the sly wit that appears to be the birthright of all Thompson women. Linda also duets gorgeously with the New York avant-cabaret crooner Antony Hegarty in \"Beauty,\" an original by Rufus Wainwright, in whose band Teddy often plays guitar. Got all that?\n\nOn Teddy's new one, Upfront & Down Low (Verve Forecast), he solicits help from an expansive cast of side performers including Wainwright, alt-country singers Iris De-Ment and Tift Merritt, and - hey, what do you know? - his dad, Richard, who contributes a typically nimble guitar solo to a version of \"You Finally Said Something Good (When You Said Goodbye),\" an old Eugene Strasser-George Winters gem oncepopularized by Charlie Louvin.\n\nUpfront is composed almost entirely of classic-country covers; like his parents, 31-year-old Teddy is obsessed with the history of popular song, and you can hear his enthusiasm in these delicately updated readings which mellow the originals' C&W twang with the brainy melancholy familiar to fans of emo-folk troubadours like Elliott Smith and Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes. Bonus record-nerd fact: A handful of tracks feature lovely string arrangements by Robert Kirby, who also worked on Bryter Layter by Richard's late English folk-rock cohort Nick Drake.\n\nLast but not least, Richard's new CD, Sweet Warrior (Shout! Factory), is another solid batch of love and war songs from an artist who seems incapable of making a bad record. (Occasionally, it must be said, he'll make a boring one - but with over a dozen to choose from, your chances of being amused are pretty good.) Warrior's centerpiece is \"Dad's Gonna Kill Me,\" a genuinely scary account of life at the center of the war in Iraq.\n\nIn its own way, it emphasizes the preciousness of family even more than his ex-wife's and son's albums do."
