I'm Terry Gross.\n\nThe Volkswagen Beetle may have the strangest history of any car. It was\n\ndesigned in response to Adolf Hitler's demand for an affordable car for the\n\nGerman people. Thirty years later, after it caught on in the US, the Beetle\n\nbecame the affordable car of the hippie counterculture. By the '80s the VW\n\nBug had been overtaken by compact Japanese cars, but the Beetle's design was\n\nso popular, it was revived in the '90s with a new retro model that came in\n\ncandy-colored designs.\n\nMy guest, Phil Patton, is the author of the new book \"Bug: The Strange\n\nMutations of the World's Most Famous Automobile.\" He writes regularly for The\n\nNew York Times' Design Notebook, Public Eye and automotive columns. He was a\n\nconsulting curator for the Museum of Modern Art's 1999 exhibition on\n\nautomobiles for the new century. I asked Patton about Hitler's connection to\n\nthe Beetle.\n\nMr. PHIL PATTON (Author, \"Bug: The Strange Mutations of the World's Most\n\nFamous Automobile\"): Hitler really was the man who made the Volkswagen\n\nhappen. The idea of a people's car had been around in Germany for many years,\n\nand they were advocates for it. But the very first thing Hitler did after\n\ncoming to power as chancellor in January of 1933 was to declare he was going\n\nto help the automobile industry, build highways and build a car for the\n\nmasses. This, of course, was quite popular, and the vision of American\n\nprosperity danced in the minds of Germans. It was something he wanted to\n\nexploit.\n\nGROSS: Does Volkswagen translate from people's car?\n\nMr. PATTON: Volkswagen literally means people's car, and it was really a\n\ngeneric name before it became a trademark. There had been talk of a people's\n\ncar in Germany back in the '20s, and there were even models of cars from other\n\nmanufacturers called people's cars or Volkswagen well before the actual Nazi\n\nmodel appeared.\n\nGROSS: Why was building cars and building roads so important for Hitler's\n\nplan?\n\nMr. PATTON: It's important to remember that Hitler's grasp on power was a bit\n\ntenuous when he first became chancellor. And with unemployment high, building\n\nhighways was an excellent way to create jobs, and helping the automobile\n\nindustry was, in a modern industrial economy, a way to pump up the economy.\n\nIn fact, a lot of economists believe that it did more to restore the German\n\neconomy than rearmament actually did. So he was fairly shrewd in both\n\ncreating economic stimulus and propaganda appeal.\n\nGROSS: Now was the development of cars and highways linked in Hitler's mind\n\nto militarization?\n\nMr. PATTON: William Shirer and other historians have depicted the Volkswagen\n\nas pretty much just a propaganda ploy, but it really was quite closely woven\n\ninto Hitler's own vision. He saw the Autobahns extending into the conquered\n\nterritories in the east, and he even measured out the map of these conquered\n\nterritories according to how far a Volkswagen could go in a day. He ordered\n\nthat villages be built for the new German farmers he was going to install\n\nthere, and there would be a town with an inn a Volkswagen's drive apart from\n\nthe other towns.\n\nGROSS: Now Hitler asked Porsche to design this car. I always thought that\n\nPorsche was the founder of the Porsche and never associated him with designing\n\nthe humble VW Bug.\n\nMr. PATTON: Well, it's funny. Ferdinand Porsche was a major public figure in\n\nEurope. He was a hero engineer who had even worked for the kaiser in the\n\nFirst World War, and he was well-known, having worked designing racing cars\n\nand other cars for Mercedes and other companies. And he had been pushing a\n\npeople's car, too. Like Hitler, he was a guy from the provinces, and he had a\n\nnotion of bringing a fairly inexpensive good car back to the sort of rural\n\nfolk from whom he sprang. So they had an interesting relationship. Porsche\n\ndidn't have much interest in ideology, but he had a kind of almost avuncular\n\nrelationship with Hitler, and the two of them got along in a very strange and\n\nweird way.\n\nGROSS: How did the Bug get its shape?\n\nMr. PATTON: The Bug got its shape from some of the ideas about streamlining\n\nof the period. The airflow in other cars had been appearing. As speeds got\n\nhigher, the engineers were looking to reduce drag. But Hitler was very\n\ninterested in specifically getting involved. He fancied himself an automotive\n\nexpert, and he instructed Porsche to look to nature for the shapes of\n\nstreamlining and specifically told him, `Look to the beetle,' lending this\n\nnickname almost immediately. And Hitler made also, it appears, a number of\n\ndrawings suggesting the shape, and you can be sure that Dr. Porsche hastened\n\nto round the front in just the manner that Hitler had suggested.\n\nGROSS: While the VW Bug was being built, Hitler gave it a different name. He\n\ncalled it the KdF Wagon. What does that name mean? What was the significance\n\nof that name?\n\nMr. PATTON: Hitler wanted the car called the Strength through Joy Wagon.\n\nThat was the organization, Strength through Joy, a propaganda organization\n\nthat organized recreational activities for workers to boost their morale. And\n\none of the things that they had were savings plans. You could save for a ski\n\nvacation or a cruise. Finally, it was hit upon that workers could save a few\n\nmarks each week and buy the car in this manner.\n\nGROSS: But you say even when it was officially being called the KdF Wagon,\n\nthe logo that was coming off of the assembly line and being put on the car was\n\nthe VW logo. How did that happen?\n\nMr. PATTON: There was a KdF logo, which was partly derived from the swastika,\n\nbut there was a lot of public skepticism toward all the Nazi propaganda, and\n\nmost people really referred to it still as the Volkswagen. The name had\n\nsimply been established for so long.\n\nGROSS: Toward the end of World War II, slave labor was used at the VW\n\nproduction plant, and you say that people from occupied countries and Eastern\n\nEurope and in Europe were kind of enslaved to work in this plant. People were\n\ntaken out of Auschwitz to work in the plant. Describe what you know of what\n\nworking conditions were like at that point in time at the VW plant in Germany.\n\nMr. PATTON: Slave labor of all types was used, including, first of all,\n\nSoviet prisoners of war. Prisoners of war, of course, are not supposed to be\n\nimpressed into labor under the Geneva Convention, but they were. People who\n\nwere pulled out of occupied France as political opponents, people who were\n\nbrought from Poland and other conquered territories in the east, including\n\nwomen, and at one point, skilled Jewish metal workers brought from\n\nconcentration camps. And absurdly, each of these different types of laborer\n\nwas given a different food ration, different uniform, different privileges\n\nwithin the plant where a variety of wartime activities were going on, in\n\naddition to simply building military vehicles. Bombs, artillery shells, all\n\nsorts of things were built in this vast factory that had been planned to turn\n\nout millions of cars.\n\nGROSS: Did VW ever offer any public apology for using slave labor and people\n\nfrom the concentration camps?\n\nMr. PATTON: VW was, in the 1990s, one of the most forward of German\n\ncompanies--and most major German companies had used the slave labor--in trying\n\nto come to terms with this under their CEO, Carl Hahn. Hahn commissioned what\n\nturned out to be an 800-page book by the eminent German historian Hans Mommsen\n\nand a team of historians working for him to come to a full accounting of those\n\nyears, and what is amazing is how much documentation there was in both just\n\noffice papers, photographs, things that survived. Volkswagen also established\n\na fund to compensate surviving slave laborers well before there was a national\n\nfund established by the German government. And then they began to turn their\n\nback a little bit when Ferdinand Piech became CEO. Piech's father had been\n\nthe head of the factory during the war. Piech's grandfather was Ferdinand\n\nPorsche, and he felt that, in many ways, the accounting of the slave labor\n\nyears, the whole Nazi experience had been aimed at embarrassing him, and he\n\nrefused to have the book translated into other languages.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Phil Patton, author of the new book \"Bug: The Strange\n\nMutations of the World's Most Famous Automobile.\" We'll talk more after a\n\nbreak. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: We're talking about the history of the Volkswagen Beetle. My guest,\n\nPhil Patton, is the author of the new book \"Bug: The Strange Mutations of the\n\nWorld's Most Famous Automobile.\"\n\nWhen the Volkswagen was exported to the United States, the image of the car, I\n\nthink, really started to change. For a lot of Jewish people in the United\n\nStates, it was a car associated with the Nazis, and they didn't want to go\n\nnear it. And I'm sure a lot of other Americans had similar misgivings about\n\nthis car. What was done to change the image of the Volkswagen Beetle from\n\nHitler's car to a fun, cheap, small car that Americans would enjoy?\n\nMr. PATTON: Well, a few GIs had brought Volkswagens back from Europe, and\n\nthere were a few imported, but it really took a growing sense of the Beetle as\n\na product of West Germany, not of greater Hitler Germany, and also an ad\n\ncampaign by the late 1950s, ironically, as with so many things in the Beetle\n\nstory, by a Jewish ad agency. These were probably the most famous ads of the\n\ncentury, and the campaign was voted the best ad campaign in a number of\n\ncentury-end surveys. The `Think Small' ads, the `Lemon' ads, which talked\n\nabout the single strip of chrome disqualifying a Volkswagen from being shipped\n\nover. All these turned on the German image for high technology, because\n\nfrightening as they were in a military way, we knew their technology was good.\n\nWe knew their rocket scientists were helping us put satellites in orbit in the\n\nlate '50s.\n\nAnd also, there was a sense that the ad agency moved to Americanize the car.\n\nThat was their initial goal. And they did that by latching on to an existing\n\nset of American values. Detroit was advertising its cars on the basis of such\n\nAmerican values as flash and size and power and speed, but the ad agency for\n\nVolkswagen went back to American virtues such as frugality, economy, the\n\ncharacteristics of the Model T or the covered wagon. And probably the best\n\nadvertisement that summed this up was the one they did around the time of the\n\nmoon landing that showed the Lunar Lander, which was itself called Bug, with\n\nthe line, `It's ugly, but it gets you there.' And all those American virtues\n\nof can-do, do-it-yourself, plainness were soon to be reflected in the Beetle.\n\nGROSS: The Beetle caught on for a lot of young college people, and then it\n\nbecame a really big car in the hippie counterculture of the '60s. What do you\n\nthink accounts for that? Do you think it's because it was cheap or do you\n\nthink that there was something else at work there?\n\nMr. PATTON: Part of the Beetle's appeal was first in academic towns. And I\n\ngrew up in a college town where I remember seeing Beetles along with, you\n\nknow, the odd Italian and British sports car. But it was not the people who\n\nbought the people's car in the United States, not the workers and farmers, but\n\nintellectuals and people who appreciated it by contrast with the big chrome,\n\ntail-fin Detroit vehicles. And it was very much a kind of reverse snobbism to\n\nmake a statement with that kind of vehicle. Later, as the '60s went on, there\n\nwas a baby boom in progress; a lot of teen-agers had a Beetle as their first\n\ncar because it was an economical vehicle to add to the family garage.\n\nGROSS: I remember in the '60s, there were a lot of Jewish families in which\n\nbuying a Volkswagen was a very controversial act. You know, the newly adult\n\nkid wanted a Volkswagen because it was a cheap car and it was, you know, a\n\nkind of hip car to have. And the parents often felt like you shouldn't give\n\nthem your money because this was a car associated with Hitler and the Nazis,\n\n`How could you buy it?' Do you remember those debates?\n\nMr. PATTON: I remember those debates not only about Volkswagen--and they're\n\ncompletely understandable--but about Mercedes. And that was the feeling of\n\npeople like George Lois who worked at the ad agency producing the Volkswagen\n\nads; there was a great deal of ambivalence on the part of the ad agency about\n\nworking with a car that he said still reminded you of the ovens. You know,\n\nhow would they deal with that issue?\n\nGROSS: Do you think that link between Volkswagen and Hitler still exists in\n\nthe minds of many American consumers? Do you think that there are many people\n\nnow who would not buy that car because of its roots in the Reich?\n\nMr. PATTON: What surprises me, particularly with the new Beetle, and\n\nparticularly with people in their '20s and younger, is in many cases an\n\nabsence of awareness even of the old Beetle. It's something they see in\n\nmovies, and it's a distant memory, but they don't associate it--they don't\n\neven associate the new Beetle so much with the old Beetle, and they have very\n\nlittle awareness of the whole history of the car and its birth in the Third\n\nReich. And really the whole story of the Beetle has been this twist of\n\nironies, a tragicomic moving in and out of the dark sides into the bright\n\nsides of culture, how you go from Himmler to Herbie, how you end up being a\n\nplush toy sold in the Disney mall store after starting out as a detailed model\n\ngiven to Adolf Hitler on his birthday. It's just one of those very strange\n\ncrystals that takes all of our history of the last century and throws it into\n\nmany fascinating lights.\n\nGROSS: Well, Phil Patton, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMr. PATTON: Thanks, Terry. This was fun.\n\nGROSS: Phil Patton is the author of the new book \"Bug: The Strange Mutations\n\nof the World's Most Famous Automobile.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nProfile: Fall TV season\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nAfter a slow summer, it's a busy time for TV. The Emmy Awards were held last\n\nnight. The fall TV season begins officially today. And TV critic David\n\nBianculli says they both have to do with the same thing, broadcast vs. cable\n\nTV.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI reporting:\n\nAt the Emmys last night, the final two awards made it sound like business as\n\nusual for the big broadcast networks. NBC won best drama for \"The West Wing\"\n\nand best comedy for \"Friends.\" And earlier in the night, CBS won three major\n\nacting awards for \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" and Fox picked up the major\n\nwriting awards for \"24\" in drama and \"The Bernie Mac Show\" in comedy.\n\nBut you take those few shows out of the equation for a second, and what are\n\nthe broadcast networks left with? Almost nothing. Cable went home with\n\nalmost every award for telemovies and miniseries, with HBO's \"Band of\n\nBrothers\" and \"The Gathering Storm\" winning particularly big. And the biggest\n\nwin of all, a stunning upset, came when Michael Chiklis won the best dramatic\n\nseries actor Emmy for his work as a rogue cop on \"The Shield.\" That's a\n\nseries on FX, a cable network about as low on the radar as you can go.\n\nAnd speaking of taking something out of the equation, one of the reasons\n\nChiklis may have won is that another cable series, HBO's \"The Sopranos,\"\n\nwasn't eligible this year. Last year James Gandolfini won the best actor\n\ncategory, just as Edie Falco won best actress. Next year, they'll be back and\n\nit'll be a tougher contest, especially for broadcast TV.\n\nThis season broadcast TV isn't doing much to call attention to itself. The\n\n2002 fall TV season starts today, yet all the thunder, good and bad, seems to\n\nbe taken already. The one TV show everyone is talking about right now is \"The\n\nSopranos\" which returned, finally, two weeks ago. It's on cable. The best\n\nnew show of the season started this summer, \"Monk,\" starring Tony Shalhoub as\n\na brilliant detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's on cable, too,\n\non USA Network. Both of these shows were developed for, then rejected by,\n\nbroadcast networks, \"The Sopranos\" by Fox and \"Monk\" by ABC.\n\nFor Fox, it was the one that got away, but that show would have been a\n\ncompletely different animal on broadcast TV. But \"Monk\" is a classic\n\ndetective series, and ABC has admitted its mistake. It picked up reruns of\n\n\"Monk,\" showing episodes after USA Network did, and they ended up landing in\n\nthe top 20. Starting this Thursday, \"Monk\" reruns will be part of ABC's fall\n\nlineup, and this series, which came from cable, is better than any of the more\n\nthan 30 new shows this fall.\n\nHere's a taste of \"Monk,\" with Tony Shalhoub as the unusually impaired\n\ndetective, and Bitty Schram as his very patient assistant. They've been\n\ncalled in to advise at a crime scene.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Monk\")\n\nMr. TONY SHALHOUB: The stove.\n\nUnidentified Actor: Over here. It's in the kitchen.\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: No, I mean my stove. I think I left it on.\n\nMs. BITTY SCHRAM: It's OK. I checked it as we were leaving.\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: Are you sure? Did you turn the knob?\n\nMs. SCHRAM: Yeah.\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: The little knob, though?\n\nMs. SCHRAM: I turned all the knobs. The stove is off, Adrian.\n\nUnidentified Actor: Excuse me, sir, we believe it was a burglary gone sour.\n\nShe walked in, she surprised him, he panicked...\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: No.\n\nUnidentified Actor: ...he walked back from the kitchen, he...\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: No. No, no. No, no. This was no burglary.\n\nUnidentified Actor: It wasn't?\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: He tried to make it look like one, but this guy was cold as\n\nice. He wore his slippers to avoid leaving shoeprints. Not something your\n\nneighborhood crackhead is prone to do.\n\nMs. SCHRAM: Adrian.\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: He was in here. He was waiting.\n\nUnidentified Actor: Waiting for what?\n\nMr. SHALHOUB: You know, for her. He was here at least an hour. He was\n\nsmoking. You can still smell it on the curtains. Menthols, Salems.\n\nBIANCULLI: As for the other new shows this season, there are a few worth\n\nsampling at least once. There's \"Firefly\" on Fox, the new series from \"Buffy\n\nthe Vampire Slayer's\" Joss Whedon, and two ABC shows, \"Push, Nevada,\" a kind\n\nof warmed-over \"Twin Peaks,\" and \"Life with Bonnie,\" a new sitcom starring\n\nBonnie Hunt, and \"The Twilight Zone,\" a solid UPN remake of the classic Rod\n\nSerling series. And finally there's \"Boomtown\" on NBC, a new cop drama told\n\nfrom many different points of view. But there's not one new show, except for\n\n\"Monk,\" that I truly love. On broadcast TV this season, the real excitement\n\nisn't coming from the new shows popping up, but from the great ones coming\n\nback: \"Alias\" on ABC, \"24\" on Fox, \"Buffy\" on UPN.\n\nGive me those three shows every week, and I'm not complaining. Well, not\n\nmuch.\n\nGROSS: David Bianculli is TV critic for the New York Daily News.\n\nI'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Singer-songwriter Linda Thompson is making a comeback after years of\n\nbeing unable to sing because of a vocal problem. Coming up, we'll meet her\n\nand her son, Teddy Thompson, who performs with Linda on her new CD and\n\nco-wrote many of the songs.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Linda and Teddy Thompson discuss Linda's new CD,\n\n\"Fashionably Late,\" and her recording career with her ex-husband,\n\nRichard Thompson\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest, singer and songwriter Linda Thompson, made a series of recordings\n\nthat are now considered classics; albums like \"Pour Down Like Silver\" and\n\n\"Shoot Out the Lights.\" They were collaborations with her then husband,\n\nsinger, songwriter and guitarist Richard Thompson. Her dark voice seemed to\n\nperfectly suit his brooding songs. The Thompsons married in 1972, the year he\n\nleft the British folk rock group Fairport Convention, which he had co-founded.\n\nTheir marriage fell apart 10 years later.\n\nLinda recorded a solo album in 1985, but then gave up performing because of a\n\nvocal problem that made it impossible for her to sing. Now able to perform\n\nagain, she's making a comeback with a new CD called \"Fashionably Late.\" Also\n\nwith us is her son Teddy Thompson. He collaborated on the new CD, playing the\n\nguitar, singing and co-writing many of the songs, including the opening track,\n\n\"Dear Mary.\" That track is a family, or an ex-family affair, with Richard\n\nThompson adding his guitar and backup vocals. Let's hear it.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Dear Mary\")\n\nMs. LINDA THOMPSON, Mr. RICHARD THOMPSON and Mr. TEDDY THOMPSON: (Singing)\n\nOh, Mary, you may have to run. You may have to be on your way. Consider the\n\nthings that you've done. Oh, Mary, you may have to run.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. THOMPSON, Mr. R. THOMPSON and Mr. T. THOMPSON: (Singing) Remember your\n\ntales and your lies. They'll come back to haunt you one day. And all of the\n\nboys you made cry all remember your tales and your lies.\n\nAh, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah.\n\nYour false heart can never be true. I know it as well as the rest. You'll\n\npay dear for the things that you do. Your false heart can never be true. And\n\none day the tables will turn.\n\nGROSS: Linda Thompson, Teddy Thompson, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nLinda, you basically stopped singing in--What?--around 1988?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: About then, yeah.\n\nGROSS: And you were diagnosed with something that you've called hysteria\n\ndysphonia. What was the diagnosis they gave you?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Well, I mean, it was a diagnosis actually from a shrink, you\n\nknow, rather than a medical man, and that was his diagnosis. You know, I've\n\nalways thought it was more physical or neurological than psychological because\n\nI don't have to be nervous or unhappy or anything for it to happen. I mean, I\n\ncan be talking to the greengrocer, you know, and it's so--but I don't know. I\n\nmean, I'd be overjoyed if it was--you know, they could take a bit of your\n\nbrain out that didn't work or something. But...\n\nGROSS: I don't think they can do that.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No. That's unfortunate. But, you know, maybe they could do\n\nsomething. Who knows? You know, it would be...\n\nGROSS: You expected to never perform again, but you're performing now. You\n\nhave a new record out. What changed?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: A guy--an American guy called David Thomas from Cleveland, who\n\nworks with a group called Pere Ubu, asked me to do some gigs with him. And I\n\nsaid no, but he insisted, so I sort of did it. And he's a very avant garde\n\nmusician, you know, very eternal stuff, which is much easier for me to do, in\n\nfact. And, you know, it seemed to work right. And then we--Teddy and I wrote\n\nsome songs together, and we decided to make a record.\n\nGROSS: Teddy, I want to ask you, you've recorded and performed with your\n\nfather. You have your own record, as well--your father Richard Thompson. Now\n\nyou're performing and recording with your mother, as well. How'd you feel\n\nabout being on your mother's CD and working with her?\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: On it? I was that CD.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: I should mention you co-wrote a lot of those songs on it.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Yeah, it was--I mean, it wasn't as if I came in and, you\n\nknow, for a day and did something on my mom's record. It was long, you know,\n\nprocess that we did together--you know, a lot of writing together and stuff.\n\nAnd so it was very collaborative. It wasn't like a guest spot. You know, it\n\nwas years of my life.\n\nGROSS: Well, during most of your life, your mother wasn't performing. So do\n\nyou feel like you've seen a different side of her now?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: The ugly side.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's like--you know, parents have to\n\nto become people, I suppose, at some point. You know, you have to see them as\n\nsomething else other than your parents and see them doing a job. And you\n\nhaven't had a job for about 25 years.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Been lying in a darkened room for 17 years.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: So perhaps it's a sort of belated version of that.\n\nGROSS: Linda, why did you want Teddy to work with you on the CD?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: He was cheap, basically. And he's very, very good. And I\n\njust like working with family. You know, there's a wonderful dynamic between\n\nvoices, you know, when you're related. Yeah, I think. And I just like\n\nworking--and I like being with my kids more than I like being with anybody\n\nelse. So I--it was a pleasure for me to work with Teddy, and with Kammie, my\n\nyoungest daughter.\n\nGROSS: What's the process when you're writing together?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: It varies. I mean...\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: It involves a lot of faxing.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yes.\n\nGROSS: That's right, because, Teddy, you're in New York and, Linda, you're in\n\nEngland.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. But the first one, I think, Teddy gave me the tune and\n\nthen I did some lyrics, and sometimes we'd do it the other way around. I'll\n\ngive him some lyrics and do a tune, you know. So we'd been played them down\n\nthe phone. Or--I mean, I'm in New York a lot, so, you know, we get to\n\ncollaborate in person, as well.\n\nGROSS: My guests are singer-songwriter Linda Thompson and her son, singer,\n\nsongwriter and guitarist Teddy Thompson. Let's hear a track from Linda's new\n\nCD \"Fashionably Late.\" This is \"Evona Darling.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Evona Darling\")\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: (Singing) Do you remember?\n\nMs. THOMPSON and Mr. T. THOMPSON: (Singing) He can remember you. Evona\n\ndarling, doesn't that make you blue? Living here like you do, doesn't that\n\nmake him love a little, too, girl? He's in love with you, Evona. So in love\n\nwith you, Evona.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: (Singing) Time has come for him to belong to someone. Time\n\nwill come when you will, too.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: (Singing) Evona.\n\nGROSS: That's Linda Thompson and Teddy Thompson's from Linda's new CD\n\n\"Fashionably Late.\" It's her first new recording since 1985. She's making a\n\ncomeback after a long period during which vocal problems prevented her from\n\nperforming.\n\nLinda, I'd like to hear a little about your life. You were born in London,\n\ngrew up also in Glasgow.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yep.\n\nGROSS: Your mother was a vaudevillian?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yes, she was for a very brief, brief period of time. She was\n\nVera Love, speciality dancer.\n\nGROSS: What kind of--does that mean--speciality, does that mean striptease?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah, it does sound like that, doesn't it? No, but actually\n\nit wasn't. It wasn't striptease. She just had an act with a friend of hers\n\ncalled Gay Belaird, and they just sort of sang and danced and wore--I've got\n\nthese pictures of them wearing these funny little costumes. I don't think it\n\nlasted for very long, but, you know, it's a nice story. I love vaudeville and\n\nmusicals. So it's sort of in my blood.\n\nGROSS: So did your mother encourage you to sing and dance when you were a\n\nkid?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. A little too much I think, yes. Yes.\n\nGROSS: What would she want you to do?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Well, you know, we lived in a counselor state, what would be\n\nprojects, I guess, here.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: And, you know, to be a singer or a dancer or a boxer or\n\nsomething, that was a way out. So, yeah, I think they were very keen for my\n\nbrother and I to, you know, have a better life than they did and stuff, you\n\nknow.\n\nGROSS: So what were your speciality numbers as a child?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Oh, what were my speciality numbers as a child? \"Tammy\"--I\n\nused to sing \"Tammy,\" the Debbie Reynolds song. A perfectly execrable song,\n\nbut I liked it at the time. And I can't remember what else. My father used\n\nto sing \"Jealousy,\" which was a very ambitious tune, \"Jealousy,\" so that was\n\nvery clever of him. My mother didn't sing anything because she couldn't sing.\n\nGROSS: Now I understand you also recorded commercial jingles for awhile.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah, I did with Manfred Mann. I did a lot of those in the--I\n\ncan't remember if it was the '60s or '70s--you know, some time when I was\n\nyoung. And that was very lucrative. I think that was the most lucrative\n\nthing I ever did.\n\nGROSS: Now Manfred Mann had the hit \"Do Wah Diddy.\"\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. He had a lot of hits, but, yeah, that was one of them.\n\nAnd...\n\nGROSS: So you and he did commercial jingles. Do you remember what they were\n\nfor?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. You know, for yogurt and for--yogurt and for flour and\n\nthings. And in those days--now you can use snippets of existing songs, but in\n\nthose days, PR-ists didn't let you do that, so you actually had to write the\n\njingle, which was incredibly lucrative.\n\nGROSS: So did you write the jingles yourself?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Well, you know, I co-wrote some of them, you know, with him.\n\nI don't remember them--I don't actually remember getting much money for that,\n\nbut, yes--but you could make a lot of money doing jingles.\n\nGROSS: What do I need to do to get you to sing one of those jingles?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Oh, I'll sing you one. OK. And (singing) `Ski, the fuller\n\nfitness food. It's good for everyone. Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.' See\n\nwhat absolute crap that was?\n\nGROSS: And what was that for, Ski?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Ski was a yogurt. Yogurt.\n\nGROSS: Oh. Uh-huh.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: And the other one was, (singing) `Flour so fine, it flows and\n\nit flows.'\n\nGROSS: What did you folk music friends think of you recording commercial\n\njingles?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Oh, I used to watch the television with them and say, `Can you\n\nimagine anybody stooping that low as to sing that stuff?' I just pretended it\n\nwasn't me.\n\nGROSS: But they knew it was you.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No.\n\nGROSS: They didn't know it was you?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No.\n\nGROSS: You hid it from them.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No. Yes. Well, actually, his dad stopped me doing it. He\n\nsaid, `You can't do things like that. It's disgusting.' And like a fool, I\n\ndid--I stopped.\n\nGROSS: My guests are Linda Thompson and her son, Teddy Thompson, who\n\ncollaborated on her new CD. It's called \"Fashionably Late.\" We'll talk more\n\nafter a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Linda Thompson. After being unable to perform for over a\n\ndecade because of a vocal problem, she's now making a comeback with her new CD\n\n\"Fashionably Late.\" Also with us is her son Teddy Thompson, who collaborated\n\non Linda's new CD, playing guitar, singing harmony and co-writing many of the\n\nsongs.\n\nYou sang for several years with Richard Thompson...\n\nMs. THOMPSON: I did.\n\nGROSS: ...who you were married to for most of the time or all of the time\n\nthat you performed together.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yes. Almost all of the time.\n\nGROSS: How did you change your sense of yourself as a singer and what\n\ndirection you wanted to head in when you teamed up with him?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: I really don't--you know, I don't know. I mean, the material\n\ngot better. That's about--you know, immediately the material got better...\n\nGROSS: Well, Richard writes great songs, yeah.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: ...because he writes great songs. So, you know, I stopped\n\ndoing tried stuff and do--although we did do some traditional stuff. The\n\nmaterial got better and I think at first, I was quite insouciant about it.\n\nGROSS: Did the darkness of the songs that he was writing and you were singing\n\nspeak to you?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. Yes. Yeah, indeed. Yeah, and like--sad songs make me\n\nhappy. I like sad songs. That's what you said, isn't it, darkness?\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Yeah. Dark songs. Yeah.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah, no. I've always liked dark songs, yeah.\n\nGROSS: I'm speaking with Linda Thompson. Let's listen to a recording from\n\nthe '70s featuring Linda and Richard Thompson. This is \"Dimming of the\n\nDay.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Dimming of the Day\")\n\nMs. THOMPSON: (Singing) This old house is falling down around my ears. I'm\n\ndrowning in the river of my tears. When all my willies come, you hold me\n\nsway. I need you at the dimming of the day.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. THOMPSON and Mr. R. THOMPSON: (Singing) In the morning light, the moon\n\ncalls all the time. And you're just where I keep my bad aside.\n\nGROSS: That's Richard and Linda Thompson. My guest is Linda Thompson, and\n\nshe has a new CD, which is called \"Fashionably Late.\"\n\nYou know, we were talking a little bit about what it's like to be married to\n\nthe person who you're performing with. You were recording and performing\n\ntogether as the marriage was breaking up, and even, I think, shortly after\n\nyour marriage broke up.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And that sounds like it must have been quite a trying...\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah, I know.\n\nGROSS: ...quite a trying period, but with great music.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. I mean, it was trying. I mean, when we did \"Shoot Out\n\nthe Lights,\" the marriage was breaking up, but, you know, I didn't know, which\n\nsounds silly, but the wife is always the last to know. And, also, I was\n\npregnant, you know. And when you're pregnant, I think your intellect kind of\n\ndescends into your womb. You know, you sort of think about the baby. And so\n\nI didn't know anything was going on except--you know, maybe subliminally I\n\ndid, but I didn't. You know, nothing was a voiced.\n\nBut after the record came out and we toured, then, you know, I certainly did\n\nknow then. And that tour was, you know, the old `best of times, worst of\n\ntimes,' because I was, you know, singing very well, but, you know, it was\n\ndifficult to be touring with somebody, you know, that I wasn't going to be\n\nmarried to anymore.\n\nGROSS: I want to play a song that you were doing then. It's on the \"Shoot\n\nOut the Lights\" album, but this is a version of it that wasn't on that album,\n\nhowever, it was on an album of yours that came out a few years ago during a\n\nperiod when you weren't singing. And this album collected previously\n\ncollected takes as well as outtakes and unreleased recordings. So this is an\n\nouttake of \"Walking on a Wire.\" This is from the early 1980s. Can you tell\n\nus what was going through your mind? What your life was like when you\n\nrecorded this?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Well, as I say, at that time, I didn't really know anything was\n\nwrong. And Richard--even when we were married, you know, he wrote very bleak\n\nsongs--you know, bleak lullabies and stuff for the kids, and just things that,\n\nyou know, kind of, I guess, normal songwriters wouldn't do. So the fact that\n\nthey were, you know, strange songs about life disintegrating, I just--it\n\nsounds ridiculous, but I just don't think--although I took on board the, you\n\nknow, emotion of the song and loved to sing it, I didn't really connect it,\n\nyou know, with myself. As I say, I was expecting a baby and I--you know,\n\neverybody that's been pregnant out there all know about pregnancy amnesia,\n\nwhich incidentally never went away for me. But, you know, I just think you're\n\nkind of--you're indifferent, you know, hormone heaven, or hormone hell maybe,\n\nwhen you're pregnant. And I didn't connect it.\n\nGROSS: This is Linda Thompson singing the Richard Thompson song \"Walking on a\n\nWire.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Walking on a Wire\")\n\nMs. THOMPSON: (Singing) I wish I could please you tonight. But my medicine\n\njust won't go right.\n\nMs. THOMPSON and Mr. R. THOMPSON: (Singing) I'm walking on a wire. I'm\n\nwalking on a wire. And I'm falling.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: (Singing) Too many steps to take, too many spells to break, too\n\nmany nights awake and no one else. This grindstone's wearing me, the floors\n\nare tearing me, don't use me endlessly. It's too long. It's too long to\n\nmyself. Where's the justice, where's the...\n\nGROSS: That's Linda Thompson, an outtake of the song \"Walking on a Wire.\"\n\nRichard Thompson on guitar there. It was recorded for an album they did\n\ntogether called \"Shoot Out the Lights,\" but this was an outtake that was\n\nissued on Linda Thompson's previous CD called \"Dreams Fly Away: A History of\n\nLinda Thompson.\" She has a new CD now called \"Fashionably Late.\"\n\nNow was it on this tour, this \"Shoot Out the Lights\" tour, when the marriage\n\nwas falling apart and you were pregnant, that you--I've read these stories,\n\nthat you kicked Richard in the shins during a performance and smashed all the\n\nmirrors in a dressing room backstage.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah, I did. I did. I did.\n\nGROSS: Was this after you knew the marriage was falling apart or...\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No. It was because I didn't like the mirrors in the dressing\n\nroom. Yes. No, no, it was after--yes, after I knew the marriage was falling\n\napart, yes. As has oft been documented, I was on the antidepressants washed\n\ndown with vodka. So, you know, it was a bit of a wild time for me. I was\n\nsort of 33 and having a second childhood--you know, sort of scary and\n\nliberating at the same time, because I had been very buttoned up.\n\nGROSS: Had you been inhibited and buttoned up as a kid, or was that...\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No.\n\nGROSS: ...like a different way to live for you?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No, no. I was very, you know--I'm not--you know, like a lot of\n\nmusicians and actors, I veer between grand--you know, feelings of grandiosity\n\nand feelings of worthlessness. And I think I had that even from a child. You\n\nknow, I d--but I was always very loud and wild, and, you know, and happy. I\n\nhad that--sort of good parents and all that sort of stuff. I think I got\n\nmore, you know, closed down in a way when I was with Richard.\n\nGROSS: My guests are Linda Thompson and her son, Teddy Thompson, who\n\ncollaborated on her new CD. It's called \"Fashionably Late.\" We'll talk more\n\nafter a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: With me is Linda Thompson. After being unable to perform for over a\n\ndecade because of a vocal problem, she's now making a comeback with her new CD\n\n\"Fashionably Late.\" Also with us is her son Teddy Thompson, who collaborated\n\non Linda's new CD. In the '70s and early '80s, Linda performed with her\n\nthen-husband singer, songwriter and guitarist Richard Thompson. Their\n\nmarriage broke up in 1982.\n\nThere's actually a song that you wrote about Richard Thompson that's on your\n\nnew CD called \"Dear Old Man of Mine.\" I'd like to play the song. Would you\n\nsay a little bit about it?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. Teddy and I went--no, we didn't go. I went to see Teddy\n\nand Richard play--Teddy was in Richard's band for a little while. And I just\n\nthought he was--Richard was singing particularly well that night. You know,\n\nlike I say in the song, singing like he had a gun to his head, you know,\n\nreally sort of with a sense of great sort of urgency. And Teddy said to me,\n\n`You know, that's a good line. You should work on that.' So I did, and then\n\nhe came up with this wonderful tune.\n\nGROSS: With the melody? Teddy wrote the melody.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Teddy did. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's hear it. This is \"Dear Old Man of Mine.\" And Linda\n\nThompson is singing lead, Teddy Thompson is on guitar and Linda's daughter\n\nKamila Thompson is singing backup vocals.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Dear Old Man of Mine\")\n\nMs. THOMPSON: (Singing) Here's to the man that we thought was dead singing\n\nlike he's got a gun to his head. Hanging on sweet notes and the thread. Dear\n\nold man of mine. Here's to a father of times blessed. Here's to the child\n\nthat he loved best. Does anybody care what happened to the rest? Dear old\n\nman of mine.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: That's Linda Thompson singing \"Dear Old Man of Mine\" from her new CD\n\n\"Fashionably Late,\" with her son Teddy Thompson on guitar and daughter Kamila\n\nThompson doing harmony vocals. Teddy Thompson is with us as well as Linda\n\nThompson.\n\nTeddy, I'm just thinking is this awkward for you to be writing the melody to a\n\nsong that your mother is writing about your father?\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: I was really sitting here listening to the...\n\nGROSS: Yes. Exactly. I'm wondering...\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: ...listening to the rehashing of, you know...\n\nGROSS: Yes.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: ...of my horrendous childhood.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: That's awkward, yeah. What was the question?\n\nGROSS: Oh, if it was as awkward or more awkward co-writing the song?\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Oh, nah. It's just a job. Most of it came in the toilets\n\nin McDonald's writing a tune. It's all the same.\n\nGROSS: Well, you...\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: It wasn't particularly awkward, no. I don't think so.\n\nGROSS: I feel funny even talking about this with you here. Like, we're\n\ntalking about your family history.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Yeah, I know.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah. We're leaving the studio and chucking ourselves under\n\nthe nearest bus.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: But it sounds like everybody's life is in really good shape now. I\n\nmean, Richard's been married since the divorce. You've been married since the\n\ndivorce.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: He has. Yeah, that's right.\n\nGROSS: And...\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: And I'm still lonely. It has a deep effect on my\n\nrelationship.\n\nGROSS: Yes, but you're--but musically you're in good shape. You've got your\n\nown CD. You're on your mother's CD. You're on your father's CDs.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Yeah, but am I happy?\n\nGROSS: Are you happy?\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: No.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Teddy will never give you a straight answer to anything.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Hmm. No.\n\nGROSS: Teddy, did you know along that you would be playing music?\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Quite early on. Well, I always thought I'd rather like to,\n\nbut I wasn't--I didn't quite--I mean, until somebody gave me a record deal\n\nthe first time, I didn't think anybody would, you know, be interested.\n\nGROSS: Were there like family sing-a-longs that you...\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: No. No, there was none of that.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Family fencing matches.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Family shouting matches. No, actually there wasn't any of\n\nthat, really.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: No.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: You know, I mean, there weren't mar--I was seven when they\n\nwere divorced. It was a very short period time when we would have done. And\n\nthen after that, you know, my mom wasn't singing that much, so it\n\nwasn't--music was a big part of our lives. We were all very into music. We\n\nlistened to music, but we didn't play it a lot.\n\nGROSS: Now that you have a new CD and are singing again, what kind of\n\nresponse are you hearing from old fans who thought they might not ever hear\n\nanything new from you again?\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Well, the ones I've spoken to, it's been very positive, you\n\nknow. Very positive indeed.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Both of them.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yes. Sid and Doris Bonkers. Yeah, it's been--you know,\n\neverybody's been fantastic, you know, especially in America. I think people\n\nhave long memories in America 'cause, you know, the reaction's been fantastic.\n\nGROSS: Great. Great. Well, congratulations on the new CD. It's...\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Thank you so much.\n\nGROSS: It's really great to hear you sing again.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Thank you very much.\n\nMr. T. THOMPSON: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Thanks. Thanks to both of you.\n\nMs. THOMPSON: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Linda Thompson has a new CD called \"Fashionably Late.\" Teddy Thompson\n\nis featured on guitar and harmony vocals, and co-wrote many of the songs.\n\nLinda Thompson will tour the States through the month of October. The tour\n\nbegins on the West Coast with stops in Portland, Vancouver, Seattle, San\n\nFrancisco and Los Angeles.\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross.\n\n(Soundbite of song; music)"
