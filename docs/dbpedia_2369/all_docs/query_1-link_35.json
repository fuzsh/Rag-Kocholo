        "text": "Individually, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris have created some of the most beautiful records of all time, blurring the lines between country, pop, folk, and rock-and-roll. Collectively, the threesome released two transcendent and heartfelt albums, Trio (1987) and Trio II (1999). The two landmark LPs garnered sales of over five million copies and three Grammy Awards and became beloved additions to all three artists' discographies. Today, Rhino Records announced the September 9 release of The Complete Trio Collection, available in three formats.\n\nEmmylou Harris has produced The Complete Trio Collection, a 3-CD release containing newly remastered versions of both original albums plus a disc of 20 rare and previously unreleased recordings. On the same date, Rhino will also issue the single \"highlights\" CD My Dear Companion: Selections from The Trio Collection as well as Farther Along, a 2-LP vinyl presentation of all the bonus material from the complete edition. In addition, Trio II will be released on vinyl for the first time.\n\nParton, Ronstadt and Harris had been blending their remarkable voices in song since the 1970s, but it took until 1987 for the first volume of Trio to arrive. (A couple of their earlier collaborative tracks have been appended on this new collection.) The long-awaited release sold more than four million copies, won two Grammy Awards, and topped the Country Album charts for five consecutive weeks. The album featured an eclectic array of songs from writers including Phil Spector, Jimmie Rodgers, Kate McGarrigle, Linda Thompson, Parton, and her old partner Porter Wagoner. A follow-up seemed inevitable, and indeed, it was - but not for another decade-plus. Trio II finally arrived in 1999, winning another Grammy and peaking in the Country Top 5. The platinum seller drew on another varied collection of songs from The Carter Family, Neil Young, Del McCoury, Randy Newman, and Parton.\n\nThe bonus disc of The Complete Trio Collection is loaded with 20 songs, including alternate takes of album tracks like \"I've Had Enough,\" \"Making Plans\" and \"My Dear Companion.\" Also featured are 11 previously unreleased recordings from the trio spanning both album sessions including \"Waltz Across Texas Tonight,\" \"Pleasant As May,\" \"Are You Tired of Me,\" and the gospel standard \"Softly and Tenderly.\" (A Trio II outtake of the latter was included on Emmylou Harris' 2007 box set Songbird: Rare Tracks and Forgotten Gems; it's unclear whether this is the same take.) Among the other unreleased material is an alternate version of \"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\" featuring Parton on lead vocals and an a cappella version of \"Calling All My Children Home.\"\n\nAll iterations of The Complete Trio Collection are set to arrive on September 9 from Rhino.
