H.E.D. Hammond colleced it in September 1905 from master carter Robert Barratt (1834-1907) of Piddletown, Dorset [VWML HAM/2/9/22] . Frank Purslow printed it in his 1965 EFDSS book Marrow Bones and probably most of the recordings shown here are derived from this version.\n\nJon Rennard sang I Live Not Where I Love in 1970 on his Traditional Sound album Brimbledon Fair.\n\nTim Hart and Maddy Prior recorded I Live Not Where I Love in 1971 for their album Summer Solstice. They performed it live for the Steeleye Span BBC radio programme “Peelâs Sunday Concert” on 15 September 1971. This programme was included as a bonus CD on the 2006 reissue of Steeleye Spanâs third album, Ten Man Mop or Mr Reservoir Butler Rides Again.\n\nSteeleye Span sang this song live on their 1982 Australian tour at the Royal Opera House in Adelaide with Tim Hart, Maddy Prior and Peter Knight singing. This recording was published in the following year on their Australian-only LP On Tour, and reissued in 1999 on the CD A Rare Collection 1972-1996. The latter version includes Maddyâs introduction which didnât appear on the original On Tour album release.\n\nLea Nicholson sang I Live Not Where I Love in 1971 on his Trailer album Horsemusic.\n\nJean Redpath sang I Live Not Where I Love in 1975 on her eponymous album Jean Redpath. She noted:\n\nA lengthy note in The British Broadside Ballad and its Music (SimpsonâRutgers U. Press, 1966, pp. 336-339) discusses the possible relationship of this song to two 17th century sources:\n\nThe Constant Lover written by P.L. (Peter Lowberry) and licensed in 1638 (approx.), sung to “a Northerne tune called Share the absence of my Mistresse”.\n\n“A Paire of Turtle Doves: Or, a dainty new Scotch Dialogue between a Yong man and his Mistresse, both correspondent in affection, etc. To a pretty pleasant tune called ‘The Absence of My Mistresse, or I live not where I love’.” This gem was written by Martin Parker and published in 1640. It is hard to tell who borrowed from whom. The language has changed considerably since Elizabethan times—witness the first verse from a Reliquary of English Song:\n\nLoyal lovers, that are distant\n\nFrom your sweethearts many a mile\n\nPray come and help me at this instant\n\nIn mirth to spend away the while\n\nSinging sweetly and com pletely\n\nIn commendation of my love\n\nResolving to part never\n\nThough I live not where I love\n\nIn my own borrowings. Lea Nicholson, Jacqui McDonald and Jon Rennard have all played a part.\n\nDerek Sarjeant and Hazel King sang I Live Not Where I Love on their 1976 album Hills & Dales.\n\nMary Black sang I Live Not Where I Love on her 1984 album Collected.\n\nTim Laycock sang I Live Not Where I Love in 1984 on his Dingleâs album Giant at Cerne. He noted:\n\n[…] Upstream from Tolpuddle is Puddledown, formerly the home of Robert Barratt, who sang some fine songs for the Hammond Brothers, including I Live Not Where I Love [VWML HAM/2/9/22] , which first appeared on broadsheets just before the start of the English Civil War.\n\nRichard Digance played the tune I Live Not Where I Love on guitar in 1985 on Buttons & Bows Volume 2: A Further Celebration of British Tunes.\n\nSeannachie sang Though I Live Not Where I Love on their 1986 album Within the Fire.\n\nStrawhead sang I Live Not Where I Love in 1987 on their album of songs of the English Civil War, Law Lies Bleeding. Their words are from an original in the Roxburghe Ballads and their tune is from Chappellâs Popular Music of the Olden Time (1859).\n\nShip of Fools (John Renbourn, Maggie Boyle, Steve Tilston and Tony Roberts) recorded I Live Not Where I Love in 1988 for their eponymous Run River album John Renbournâs Ship of Fools. This YouTube video shows them at the Thekla, Bristol on 20 September 1989:\n\nLinda Thompson sang I Live Not Where I Love in 1987 on Simon Nicolâs album Before Your Time; this track was included in 1996 on her anthology Dreams Fly Away: A History of Linda Thompson.\n\nVocal trio Artisan (Brian and Jacey Bedford and Hilary Spencer) sang Though I Live Not Where I Love on their 1989 album Driving Home.\n\nCherrington & Ward sang I Live Not Where I Love on their 1989 Brewhouse album Hand of Fate; this recording was included in 2018 on the Fellside anthology Destination: Fellside Recordings 1976-2018.\n\nChris Robson sang Though I Live Not Where I Love at a concert at the Hardy Hall, Dorchester, that was released in 1990 on Nick Dowâs CD An Evening of Traditional Songs From Dorset.\n\nJo Freya sang Though I Live Not Where I Love in 1992 on her Saydisc album Traditional Songs of England. The liner notes commented:\n\nThis beautiful song is unusual in that it is effectively a pure love song rather than a lament. Our version is a composite of a number of variants collected in the south of England and a printed broadside.\n\nJane Threlfall and Carl Hogsden sang Though I Live Not Where I Love on their 1995 CD Who?.\n\nKitty Vernon sang I Live Not Where I Love (You Soldiers All) in 1998 on her and Mick Pearceâs WildGoose CD Dark the Day. She noted:\n\nThis version of I Live Not Where I Love was given to us by an Irish traditional singer who had got it from her sister in Ireland, who had learned it locally, believing it to be a different traditional version from the one more commonly heard. Only later did we find out it was actually Strawheadâs Gregg Butlerâs reworking of the song for a Civil War set. The song provided us with the album title, although ironic to tell, the actual line did not appear in Greggâs original! Such is the folk process.\n\nThe New Scorpion Band sang I Live Not Where I Love in 2004 on their CD The Downfall of Pears. They noted:\n\nCollected by the Hammond brothers from Mr Robert Barratt at Puddletown in Dorset in 1905 [VWML HAM/2/9/22] , and also by Cecil Sharp from Mr Robert Parish at Exford in Somerset [VWML CJS2/9/1305, CJS2/10/1420] . The song seems to be related to, and perhaps directly descended from, Thomas Morleyâs With My Love My Life Was Nestled, published in his First Book of Ayres of 1600.\n\nJon Boden sang I Live Not Where I Love as the 16 August 2010 entry of his project A Folk Song a Day.\n\nNancy Wallace sang I Live Not Where I Love on the anthology Folk Awards 2010.\n\nMark Block sang I Live Not Where I Love on his 2014 CD The Hawthorn Spring. He noted:\n\nThere are lots of recordings of this song, which I first heard sung by the vocal harmony trio Artisan, and the world doesnât really need another one, but hereâs mine anyway. I hope you like it.\n\nGeorge Sansome and Matt Quinn sang I Live Not Where I Love in 2023 on their duo album Sheffield Park. George Sansome noted:\n\nThis is one of those songs I feel Iâve known for as long as Iâve been into folk music but have never sung—until now. Based on the song as sung by Robert Barratt (1834-1907) of Piddletown, Dorset, to Henry Hammond in 1905 [VWML HAM/2/9/22] .\n\nLyrics\n\nTim Hart & Maddy Prior sing I Live Not Where I Love\n\nCome all ye maids that live at a distance,\n\nMany miles from off your swain,\n\nCome and assist me this very moment\n\nFor to pass away some time.\n\nSinging sweetly and completely\n\nSongs of pleasure and of love,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nWhen I sleep I dream about you,\n\nWhen I wake I find no rest,\n\nFor every moment thinking of you\n\nMy heart eâer fixed in your breast.\n\nAlthough far distance may be assistance\n\nFrom my mind his love to remove,\n\nYet my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nAll the world shall be one religion,\n\nLiving things shall cease to die,\n\nBefore that I prove false to my jewel\n\nOr any way my love deny.\n\nThe world shall change and be most strange\n\nIf ever I my mind remove,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nSo farewell lads and farewell lasses,\n\nNow I think Iâve got my choice.\n\nI will away to yonder mountain\n\nWhere I think I hear his voice.\n\nAnd if he calls then I will follow\n\nThrough the world though it is so wide,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\n(repeat first verse)\n\nJean Redpath sings I Live Not Where I Love\n\nCome all ye maids who live at a distance,\n\nMany a mile from off your love;\n\nCome and assist me this very moment\n\nFor to pass away some time.\n\nSinging sweetly and completely\n\nSongs of pleasure and of love,\n\nMy heart is with you all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nWhen I sleep I dream about you,\n\nWhen I wake I find no rest,\n\nEvery moment thinking of you,\n\nMy heart fixed within your breast.\n\nThough great distance may prove assistance\n\nFrom my mind your love to remove,\n\nMy heart is with you all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nAll the world should be one religion,\n\nAll living things should cease to die.\n\nIf ever I prove false to my jewel\n\nAny way my love deny,\n\nThe world would change and be most strange\n\nIf ever I inconstant prove.\n\nMy heart is with you all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nSo farewell lads and farewell lasses,\n\nNow I think Iâve got my choice.\n\nIâll away to yonder island\n\nWhere I think I hear your voice.\n\nIf you call then I will follow,\n\nThough the ocean be so wide;\n\nMy heart is with you all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nMaggie Boyle sings I Live Not Where I Love\n\nCome all you maids who live at a distance,\n\nMany miles from off your swain,\n\nCome and assist me this very moment\n\nFor to pass away some time,\n\nSinging sweetly and completely\n\nSongs of pleasure and of love,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nAll the world shall be one religion,\n\nLiving things shall cease to die\n\nBefore that I prove false to my jewel\n\nOr any way my love deny.\n\nThe world shall change and be most strange\n\nIf ever I my mind remove,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nSo farewell lads and farewell lasses,\n\nNow I think Iâve got my choice.\n\nI will away to yonder mountains\n\nWhere I think I hear his voice.\n\nAnd if he goes there I will follow\n\nThrough the world though it is so wide,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\n(repeat first verse)\n\nGeorge Sansome and Matt Quinn sing I Live Not Where I Love\n\nCome all you maids that live at a distance,\n\nMany a mile from off your swain,\n\nCome and assist me this very moment\n\nFor to pass away some time,\n\nSinging sweetly and completely\n\nSongs of pleasure and of love,\n\nFor my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nWhen I sleep I dream about him,\n\nWhen I wake I take no rest,\n\nFor every instance thinking of him\n\nMy heart eâer fixed in his breast.\n\nAnd though far distance may be assistance\n\nFrom my mind his love to remove,\n\nBut my heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love.\n\nAll the world shall be one religion,\n\nLiving things shall cease to die\n\nBefore I prove false to my jewel\n\nOr any way my love deny.\n\nThe world may change and be most strange\n\nIf ever I my mind remove,\n\nMy heart is with him all together\n\nThough I live not where I love."
