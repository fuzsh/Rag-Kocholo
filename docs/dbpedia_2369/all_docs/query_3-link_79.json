        "text": "The Nelons lived, breathed and sang their faith.\n\nKelly Nelon Clark, husband Jason Clark and her daughters Amber Nelon Kistler and Autumn Nelon Streetman had been recording together for a decade, the latest incarnation of the family-rooted gospel group started in the 1970s by Kelly's father Rex Nelon.\n\nThey'd been on a tear at the Absolutely Gospel Awards since Kelly—who started performing with her dad as a child—was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2017. Jason was named Producer of the Year in 2021, and in 2022 Autumn was named Female Vocalist of the Year, an award won by her sister in 2014.\n\nShe's now the only surviving member of the Georgia-based quartet following a plane crash July 26 that killed Kelly, 64, Jason, Amber, 35, and her husband Nathan Kistler, 34, the band's assistant Melodi Hodges, pilot Larry Haynie and his wife, Melissa Haynie.\n\n\"Thank you for the prayers that have been extended already to me, my husband, Jamie, and our soon-to-be-born baby boy, as well as Jason's parents, Dan and Linda Clark,\" Autumn, who's expecting her first child, said in a statement the next day. \"We appreciate your continued prayers, love and support as we navigate the coming days.\"\n\nWho are The Nelons?\n\nSouthern gospel artist Rex Nelon sang bass for 20 years with the historic group The LeFevres, another family outfit with roots in Tennessee dating back to the 1920s.\n\nRex, who was born in Asheville, N.C., but settled down in Georgia, bought out the retiring LeFevres and changed the name of the group to the Rex Nelon Singers in 1977.\n\nRex and first wife Shirley's daughter Kelly, born in 1959, started singing with her father when she was 13. As the Rex Nelon Singers, they were joined by Janet Paschal from 1977 until 1981, after which Karen Peck was their soprano until 1990.\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly married Jerry Thompson in 1979 and at the time he became the fifth member of the Rex Nelon Singers.\n\nIn the mid-1980s they started performing and recording as The Nelons. After Karen left the group, Kelly's brother Todd Nelon, who had previously played bass, moved into a singing role.\n\nMeanwhile, Jason Clark had joined the Nelons as their bass player in 1995, followed by his singer father Dan Clark in 1998.\n\nKelly and Jason married in 2001 and, as Dan left the band, Amber joined as their soprano in 2002. The Nelons were a trio, with Autumn performing with them occasionally before becoming a full-time member in 2014.\n\nAmong the honors she received over the years, Kelly was named Favorite Alto at the Christian Voice Awards in 2009 and Favorite Female Vocalist in 2010.\n\nWho was Amber Nelon Kistler?\n\nThough she was a devoted member of The Nelons from the age of 13, like her mom, Amber also had solo aspirations, auditioning for American Idol in 2011.\n\nDuring a church service in 2012, Kelly told the congregation about seeking spiritual counsel when Amber first wanted to try out for the series.\n\n\"I called our pastor,\" she said, \"and he said, 'You know what, you just go till god puts a stop in it.' So that's what we did. We found out we could go to Austin, Texas, so we loaded up like the Clampetts [of Beverly Hillbillies fame].\"\n\nLining up with 10,000 other hopefuls in Austin, Kelly continued, Amber \"was the first one to try out, the first one to hold up the golden ticket to Hollywood. We thought that was it.\"\n\nThat was far from it, but eventually Amber got to the point in the process where she was singing in front of judges Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler, according to her mom.\n\nBut ultimately, Kelly said, Amber didn't make it to Hollywood because, while the aspiring Idol said she'd be willing to \"sing songs that have a positive message,\" she refused to compromise her religious values in any way for the sake of being on the show.\n\nAmber posted in June 2023 that she'd just had her last injection.\n\n\"To all the women who struggle with infertility, I understand and empathize with you,\" she wrote.\" No one gets it, unless they’ve been through it.\"\n\nAmber's most recent Instagram posts relayed that she brought home a puppy named George on July 4—\"Happy 4th!! Best day ever!\"—and announced The Nelons' latest single, \"There's a Hole in the Heart.\""
