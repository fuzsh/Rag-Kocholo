By definition, they have had to live public lives, even during periods when women were expected to be devoted to home and hearth. Through the very act of demanding a spot in the limelight, female entertainers have presented a defiant challenge to cultural norms. Consciously or unconsciously, they have helped create new visions of what a woman is and could be. Since the 19th century, Americans have looked to performers to help them define the characteristics of a modern woman. In the 1830s, stage star Fanny Kemble inspired a cultlike following of young women, who slavishly studied her clothes and manners for clues about how they should look and live. From Ethel Barrymore to Mary Tyler Moore to Madonna, many performers have likewise been idolized by admirers as the feminine ideals of their time. Other female performers have made an impact by choosing to be provocateurs. Eva Tanguay became one of the greatest stars of vaudeville, less through her talent, than by her total disinterest in propriety. Tanguay excited audiences by her provocative dress and behavior, which also prompted them to question outmoded Victorian ideas about a woman’s place in society. Similarly, Mae West became a star in the 1920s and 1930s largely because of her willingness to talk about sex\n\nwith a frankness then unacceptable in general discourse. Like many later comedians, West used humor to blunt the blow of her words. Comics such as Roseanne, Joan Rivers, and Lily Tomlin have followed in her stead, using humor to unleash their anger about what they see as the second-class status of women without inciting the anger of their audience. More recently, a keen sense of humor— combined with a knack for self-reinvention and unerring sense of the zeitgeist—has made the singer Madonna one of the most famous and perhaps one of the most influential women in the world. For many fans, the lives of female performers have been at least as exciting, if not more so, than their performances. Often the fascination lay in the mere fact that as successful professionals, these women could earn money and spend it as they wished. One such performer was Gay Nineties actress Lillian Russell, who became a fantasy figure for many women awed by her lavish lifestyle. Another enviable aspect of the performers’ lives was the independence that they enjoyed. With hefty incomes, they were more able to live free of men’s control than was the average woman. And with fame, they were often permitted more latitude to explore nontraditional lifestyles and romantic arrangements. In a time when divorce was uncommon, movie fans relished titillating stories of the multiple marriages of stars such as Lana Turner and Judy Garland. The public occasionally condemned v\n\nA TO Z OF AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE PERFORMING ARTS\n\nan especially obvious disregard for social dictates, as in the case of Elizabeth Taylor’s and Ingrid Bergman’s highly publicized extramarital affairs. Tellingly, after an almost ceremonial display of disdain, both of these actresses were later taken back into the hearts of their admirers, where they were held perhaps even closer because of their transgressions. Many female performers have used their fame and wealth less to mock society mores than to change them. Particularly important has been the role of African-American performers in breaking down racial barriers. Among the most emotional moments of the civil rights movement was classical singer Marian Anderson’s 1969 concert held at the Lincoln Memorial after she was denied the right to sing at Constitution Hall because of her race. Though perhaps less dramatic, the contributions of many other popular stars, such as Diana Ross and Diahann Carroll, were equally important. As the lead singer of the Supremes, Ross became a popular-culture icon beloved equally by African Americans and whites, while Carroll as the star of the television series Julia (1968–70) was welcomed each week into the homes of millions of American families of all races. As among the most famous, most loved, and most powerful women in the nation, female performers have played an instrumental role in the history of the United States. Taken together, the biographical essays in this volume seek to tell their story, revealing the myriad of ways they have helped shape American culture. In addition to offering a discussion of each subject’s life and career, the profiles attempt to explain these performers’ importance in their day and continuing significance in our own. It should be mentioned, though, that this reference is not intended to discuss every notable female entertainer. Certainly, anyone familiar with American popular culture could easily list dozens of other performers who might have been included. A completely comprehensive biographical dictionary on this subject would certainly require many more pages, if not volumes, than are available here. Instead, this book aims to provide an introduction vi\n\nto 150 performers, selected as representatives of the wide range of experience women have had in the American entertainment industry. Although personal taste certainly played a role in the selection process, certain criteria guided the decisions about which subjects to include. The women profiled were chosen represent as many different time periods and many different fields of endeavor as possible. For instance, circus performer Lillian Leitzel, violinist Maud Powell, and actress Charlotte Cushman are largely unknown today, but their popularity in their time earned them a spot in this discussion. An effort has also been made to include women from a variety of racial and ethic backgrounds. The struggles of Bessie Smith, Carmen Miranda, and Anna May Wong, for instance, help give a sense of the unique challenges of minority performers trying to establish themselves within the American mainstream. Due to space constraints, this book defines “women in the performing arts” fairly narrowly, focusing on performers rather than talents working behind the scenes. Many performers included, however, had important second careers offstage or offscreen. For instance, the profile on singer Buffy Sainte-Marie discusses her work as a songwriter, and the essay on actress Ida Lupino explores her importance as a film and television director. The definition of “American” for the purposes of this volume is slightly less stringent. Many foreign-born figures—such as Elizabeth Taylor, Claudette Colbert, and Ingrid Bergman—are included because the book could hardly be considered complete without them. A few important foreign performers were excluded on the somewhat subjective grounds that their most significant work was done outside the United States. For example, by this criteria, Sophia Loren was seen as more an Italian than an American performer and consequently was left out of the book. Many younger performers were also excluded, because their talents are too new and untested to determine whether their work will ultimately stand the test of time. However, a few performers in mid-career were considered important enough\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nto deserve a profile. Jodie Foster and Julia Roberts, for instance, were included on the justification that if neither made another film, she would still be remembered as having made a unique and important impact on Hollywood. Finally, particularly seminal performers—such as Mary Pickford, Lucille Ball, and Judy Garland—were deemed worthy of lengthy profiles so\n\nthat their contributions could be more fully discussed. In most cases, however, the length of an essay should not be construed as a commentary on the subject’s importance. More often, the profiles followed the common-sense rule that figures with lengthy careers demanded longer essays than those who held the public’s attention for relatively little time.\n\nvii\n\nA 7 t\n\nALLEN, GRACIE (Grace Ethel Cecile Rosalie Allen) (1895–1964) Comic, Actress\n\ntested the patience of her reasonable boyfriend, George. Although other female comics played it dumb, Allen’s Gracie was unique. The act eschewed outrageous costumes and pratfalls, instead relying almost exclusively on verbal humor. The laughs also were prompted less by Gracie’s stupidity than by her bizarre perspective on the world. As Burns once explained, the humor in her “logical illogic” grew out of that fact that “Grace played her as if she were totally sane, as if her answers actually made sense.” Soon after marrying in 1926, Allen and Burns became one of vaudeville’s hottest acts. In addition to headlining at the United States’s best vaudeville theaters, they became stars in England during 1928 and 1929. There they made their radio debut on the BBC, an engagement that was extended for 20 weeks. Despite their success abroad, Allen’s high voice was deemed too squeaky for American radio until fellow vaudeville star Eddie Cantor invited her to be a guest on his radio show. As a team, Allen and Burns became the regular comedy act on bandleader Guy Lombardo’s program. In 1932, they received their own show, The Adventures of Gracie (later renamed The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show), which became a favorite with listeners throughout the 1930s.\n\nOne of the most popular comedians of radio and television, Grace Ethel Cecile Rosalie Allen was born on July 16, 1895, in San Francisco. As a child, she learned traditional Irish dancing from her father, and at 14 she made her vaudeville debut. With her three sisters in an act called “The Four Colleens,” she was soon touring the vaudeville circuit throughout the United States. By the time they reached New York City, all the “colleens” but Grace had dropped out. As an emerging star, she asked for better billing and quit when her demands were ignored. Unable to find good bookings on her own, Allen contemplated quitting show business and enrolled in secretarial school. But she changed her mind in 1923 after meeting George Burns, then an unsuccessful vaudevillian. The two decided to perform as a comedy team in an act crafted by Burns. Initially, Allen was the “straight man,” but after seeing audiences respond to her comic timing, Burns reversed their roles. As they refined the act, the character of Gracie emerged as a genial scatterbrain, whose non sequiturs and malapropisms 1\n\nANDERSON, LAURIE\n\nAlthough their radio work was more popular, Allen and Burns also appeared in 15 short films and features during this period. Allen starred in three other films, including The Gracie Allen Murder Case (1939), which made her the first American actress to have her name appear in a movie title. Throughout Allen’s life, Burns was the driving force behind her career. Working with a team of writers, he produced their radio scripts, giving them to Allen on the day of the show. The system allowed her to maintain a fresh take on their material, giving her performance an improvisational feel that contributed to her appeal. Still, for all his work behind-the-scenes, Burns always attributed their popularity to Allen’s comic talents. “Gracie was the whole show,” he once bluntly explained. Alarmed by a dip in ratings, Burns retooled the show in 1945, abandoning his and Allen’s old routines and reworking the program into a situation comedy. In 1950 he also insisted that they adapt the show to the new medium of television despite Allen’s discomfort performing before a camera. Their show was a hit and was later credited with many innovations, including having the characters break the “fourth wall” by talking directly to the camera. For Allen, however, the show became increasingly taxing. She was plagued by migraine headaches and other health problems, which Burns felt were the result of the “chronic strain of making like someone [she wasn’t].” At her insistence, the show ended in 1958 after 299 episodes. Allen spent her remaining years entertaining and spending time with her and Burns’s two adopted children and their grandchildren. An often reluctant performer who nevertheless conquered vaudeville, radio, and television, Allen died of a heart attack in Hollywood on August 26, 1964. In 1997 American Women in Radio and Television acknowledged her trailblazing contribution to American popular culture by naming its highest honor the Gracie Allen Award.

After studying violin in high school, Anderson attended Barnard College in New York City, majoring in art history. She continued her education at Columbia University, where she earned a master’s degree in fine arts. As part of New York’s conceptual art scene, Anderson began producing performance pieces in the early 1970s. In Duets on Ice (1974), she played the violin, accompanied by a taped instrumental track hidden inside the violin. While playing, she wore ice skates encased in ice. When the ice melted, the performance was over. In other early works, including Songs and Stories for the Insomniac (1975) and Refried Beans for Instants (1976). Anderson combined music, sound, and the spoken word. Using references to popular culture to produce social and political satire, the stories she told in performance were anthologized in two collections, Airwaves (1977) and Music for Electronic and Recorded Material (1977). In 1980, Anderson began performing United States II. A section of the piece called “O Superman” featured Anderson’s voice electronically distorted by a Vocoder. Released as a single in England, “O Superman” became a surprise popular hit, reaching number two on the British charts. In addition to marking Anderson’s first financial success, the single led to a long-term\n\nANDERSON, MARIAN\n\nrecord deal in the United States with Warner Brothers. In 1982, her label released Big Science, which included excerpts of an expanded performance piece titled United States I–IV. Premiering at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in February 1983, United States was a multimedia concert that ran for eight hours over two evenings. Anderson described the piece as a “big portrait of the country” and divided it into four sections on transportation, politics, money, and love. The extravaganza brought together monologues, music, sounds, light shows, and photographs to create a witty commentary on modern American life. As Anderson attracted sold-out crowds while touring with the piece through the United States and Europe, Time magazine declared that United States was “the biggest, most ambitious and most successful example to date of the avant-garde hybrid known as performance art.” Anderson brought United States to an even larger audience in 1984, when a live album and book chronicling the performance were released. The same year, she brought out Mister Heartbreak. The album included a piece titled “Sharkey’s Day” that featured the voice of novelist William Burroughs. Two years later, Anderson released the album Home of the Brave and a concert film with the same title. On the heels of Natural History—a 1986 greatest hits tour—Anderson moved in a new direction. Of this period, she later explained, “I was tired of being Laurie Anderson. I wanted to start over.” Responding to criticism that her performances were becoming overproduced, she began creating simpler pieces, such as Empty Places (1989) and Voices from Beyond (1991). She also performed excerpts of Stories from the Nerve Bible, a collection of writings and pictures published in 1994. In Anderson’s solo show, The Speed of Darkness (1996), she returned to familiar themes of art and technology while approaching them through her own personal stories. After taking voice lessons, Anderson sang for the first time on the album Strange Angels (1990). Her other recordings included Bright Red (1994), an album produced by Brian Eno and featuring a\n\nduet with rock star Lou Reed, with whom Anderson has been romantically linked. Anderson also experimented with an interactive CD-ROM titled Puppet Motel (1995). In 1999, Anderson returned to the stage with the ambitious Songs and Stories from Moby Dick. A postmodern reworking of Herman Melville’s classic novel, the performance piece marked the first time Anderson performed with a sizable cast. In Moby Dick, Anderson also employed the “talking stick,” an inventive instrument that translates movement into sound. Calling the piece “10% Melville, 90% Laurie,” Anderson in Moby Dick grappled with larger, eternal themes, such as the search for the meaning of life, suggesting a new direction for her future work. In 2001, Anderson wrote an impressionistic essay on New York City for Encyclopedia Britannica, to be included next to the scholarly entry. Further Reading Anderson, Laurie.

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she was born on February 17, 1897, the first of three daughters. Her father, a deliveryman, died of a brain tumor when Marian was 12. Five years later, her mother became seriously ill, leaving Marian with the burden of her family’s financial support. Anderson’s musical talents emerged early. As a child, she taught herself to play the family piano 3\n\nANDERSON, MARIAN\n\nand did odd jobs to buy a violin from a pawnshop. At six, she joined the choir at the Union Baptist Church, and at eight, she performed her first solo. She awed the congregation with both her rich voice and extraordinary range. As a teenager, Anderson tried to attend a local music school, but was turned away because she was African American. The members of her church then raised funds to pay for the services of Giuseppe Boghetti, a professional vocal coach. Boghetti introduced her to classical music and became the most important of Anderson’s many teachers. Well-established on the African-American church circuit, Anderson made her New York debut at Town Hall in 1924. The recital was a profound disappointment: The turnout was modest, and the reviews were unenthusiastic. Anderson was so devastated that she considered giving up her singing career. The next year, however, she triumphed at a National Music League competition, beating out more than 300 other aspiring classical singers. As her prize, Anderson performed a solo at the New York Philharmonic. Her success, however, did little to advance her career. Anderson’s race continued to keep her from finding bookings in theaters catering to white audiences. In 1931, Anderson was awarded a grant from the Julius Rosenwald Fund to study in Europe. There, she found whites much more receptive to her singing. From 1933 to 1935, Anderson toured widely, visiting Scandinavia, France, England, Italy, Austria, and Spain. Her enormous repertoire included 200 songs in nine languages. In each performance, she combined classical works with spirituals she had first learned in church. Anderson soon emerged as a star, earning accolades wherever she performed. Most memorably, composer Arturo Toscanini, on hearing Anderson sing in Austria, told her that “Yours is a voice such as one hears once in a hundred years.” Equally impressed was American impresario Sol Hurok. After seeing Anderson in concert in Paris, he asked to manage her on a tour through the United States. Although so far her talents had been given their due only in Europe, Anderson welcomed the chance to return home. 4\n\nIn 1935, Anderson again performed at New York’s Town Hall, this time to great acclaim. Her extensive tours were equally successful. Booked two years in advance, her concerts were sold out across the United States. In 1936, she became the first African American to perform at the White House. Two years later, Hurok attempted to book a concert at Washington, D.C.’s Constitution Hall, which was owned by the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). The organization told Hurok the dates he wanted were not available. However, the real reason for DAR’s refusal was clear: It did not want to allow an African American to perform in the hall. Expressing the outrage of many, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt resigned from the DAR in protest. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes offered Anderson an alternate location for her Washington concert: the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. On April 9, 1939, Anderson performed for a crowd of 75,000, while another 2 million listened to the concert on the radio. The performance finally made Anderson a star in her native country. It also made her into icon in the fight against racism. A mural commemorating the event was unveiled at Department of the Interior headquarters in 1943. Now a celebrity, Anderson was more in demand than ever as a concert singer. A year after marrying Orpheus H. Fisher, an architect, she broke the attendance record at Los Angeles’s Hollywood Bowl in 1944. In 1952, she made her television debut on The Ed Sullivan Show. Fulfilling a lifelong dream, Anderson became the first African American to sing at New York’s Metropolitan Opera House in 1949. Although, at 52, Anderson was past her prime, the performance inspired eight curtain calls. Her foray into opera would open doors for LEONTYNE PRICE and many other young African-American opera singers. Anderson sang at the inaugurations of presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy before her retirement in 1965. Throughout her long career, she was given an array of honors. In addition to 24 honorary doctorates, Anderson was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 and a Kennedy Center Honor in 1978.\n\nARDEN, EVE\n\nShe also received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 1991.

She was born Eunice Quendens in Mill Valley, California, on April 30 in either 1908 or 1912 (sources vary on her birth year). Her mother, Lucille, who divorced her husband when Eunice was two, made her living as a milliner, the source of Arden’s later taste for extravagant hats. A grammar school recital made Eunice desperate for a career in show business. With the support of her mother, she started working in local theatrical companies at age 16. After being discovered by producer Lee Schubert, she was invited to join the Ziegfeld Follies as a chorus girl in 1934. While at the Follies, Quendens was asked to adopt a shorter, simpler stage name. She later claimed she took the name “Eve Arden” as a tribute to her favorite perfume (Evening in Paris) and favorite cosmetics brand (Elizabeth Arden). By the mid-1930s, Arden was appearing regularly in small film roles, while periodically returning to her first love, the theater. She was a standout\n\nas a wisecracking starlet in Stage Door (1937), but her greatest movie role came in 1945’s Mildred Pierce, in which she played the quick-witted best friend of the long-suffering title character. For her work, Arden earned an Academy Award nomination. The part also helped establish her most enduring screen persona. Throughout the late 1940s, wise and witty female characters were regarded as “Eve Arden roles.” Arden also began working in radio in 1947. The following year, she enjoyed tremendous success with Our Miss Brooks, a radio comedy about a high school English teacher. A favorite with audiences, the show was brought to television in 1951, where it ran for three years. In 1953 Arden won an Emmy for performance. She later returned to television in two short-lived series, The Eve Arden Show (1957–58) and The Mothers-in-Law (1967–69). Arden continued to make occasional appearances in film and on stage until 1983, when her husband, actor Brooks West, fell ill and died. After a brief marriage to an insurance agent in the late 1940s, Arden had wed West in 1951 and together they had raised four children, three of whom were adopted. She greatly valued family life and her long, successful marriage. To a reporter she once confessed that she sometimes envied more glamorous actresses, but added that she knew “if they only had what I’ve had—a family, real love, and an anchor—they would have been happier.” After West’s death in 1983, Arden retired from public life. She herself died of cancer on November 12, 1990, in Beverly Hills. Further Reading Arden, Eve. Three Phases of Eve: An Autobiography. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1985.

She was born Gladys Georgianna Greene in 1900 in Plattsville, New York, though she was raised in Manhattan. At 15, she left school to become a model. After a talent scout spotted one of her photographs, she signed a film contract and moved to Los Angeles. Taking the stage name Jean Arthur, she appeared in about 20 low-budget comedies and westerns during the 1920s. She worked regularly, yet the breakthrough role she craved eluded her. In 1931, Paramount Studios dropped Arthur from its roster of ingenues. Without a contract, she headed back to\n\nJean Arthur in Only Angels Have Wings (1939) (Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive)\n\n6\n\nNew York to make a stab at a stage career. Arthur appeared in a variety of Broadway and off-Broadway plays, in which she honed her comedic style. Favoring theater over film work, she later remembered this period as “the happiest years of my life.” Arthur was lured back to Hollywood with a five-year contract with Columbia Pictures in 1934. The same year, she married producer Frank Ross, whom she divorced in 1949. Arthur had had a previous marriage to photographer Julian Anker, which lasted only a day. In 1935, Arthur finally got the film vehicle she had been looking for—the leading female role in John Ford’s comedy The Whole Town’s Talking (1935). Arthur played a working girl with a hard facade but a soft heart underneath. Moviegoers so embraced her character that she would be called upon to play a variation on it in a string of romantic comedies. Arthur worked with many of the film industry’s top directors, including George Stevens and Howard Hawks, but she is most remembered for three films she made with Frank Capra—Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can’t Take It With You (1938), and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Arthur was famed for her distinctive voice, which was simultaneously husky and whispery. Film critic Pauline Kael once fittingly described it as “one of the best sounds in romantic comedies of the 30s and 40s.” Another of her trademarks was the air of confidence projected by her characters, who always seemed well equipped to take care of themselves no matter what came their way. Offscreen, however, Arthur was overwhelmed by insecurity. She was so terrified of performing that after a take she would often race to her dressing room to weep and vomit. Capra said that he directed Arthur by literally pushing her in front of the camera, but that once there “that whining mop would magically bloom into a warm, lovely, poised, and confident actress.” Arthur was also in constant battle with Columbia head Harry Cohn. Over and over, she infuriated Cohn by rejecting roles she considered inappropriate for her talents. In part to soothe the\n\nARTHUR, JEAN\n\ntensions between them, screenwriter Garson Kanin tailored a lead specifically for her in The More the Merrier (1943). Playing a woman forced to live with two men because of the wartime housing shortage, Arthur won her only Oscar nomination for the film. In 1944, Columbia finally released Arthur from her contract. Though she was now free to make the films she wanted, her crippling fear of the camera made doing so nearly impossible. She appeared in only two more movies—A Foreign Affair (1948) and Shane (1953). Arthur also made an ill-fated attempt to revive her stage career. She starred in a successful revival of Peter Pan in 1950, but otherwise stage fright and psychosomatic illness foiled her efforts. In one notorious instance, Arthur was set in 1967 to star on Broadway in The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake. At an out-of-town tryout, she came onstage and immediately went out of character. After introducing the cast, she graciously told the audience she would not be able to perform. The play’s producer, shouting from the back of the theater, cowed her into going ahead\n\nwith the performance, but Arthur quit the play as soon as the curtain fell. After brief stints teaching acting at Vassar College and the North Carolina School of the Arts, Arthur retired to Carmel, California. There, Hollywood’s most reluctant star died on June 19, 1991, at the age of 91. Further Reading Oller, John. Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew. New York: Limelight Editions, 1997.

Bacall herself, however, originated the most distinctive aspect of her character. When acting with Bogart, she was so frightened that she held her chin close to her neck to keep her head from trembling and looked at him through upturned eyes. Dubbed “the Look,” the posture became a new symbol of confident female sexuality. To Have and Have Not was an enormous success and won Bacall enthusiastic reviews. During the filming, she also began a romance with Bogart, though he was still involved in a turbulent marriage. They kept their affair quiet until he could obtain a divorce. On May 21, 1945, Bacall and Bogart were married. They eventually had two children, Stephen and Leslie. Conceding to Bogart’s wishes, Bacall made home and family her first priority, though she continued to appear in films. Her second movie. Confidential Agent (1945), was a failure, prompting many critics who had earlier praised her work to question whether she could act at all. Realizing that her reception depended heavily on the quality of her material, she began fighting for better roles. Bacall soon revived her career with several onscreen pairings with Bogart, including The Big Sleep (1946) and Key Largo (1948). She also\n\nBest remembered for her film collaborations with her husband Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske in New York City on September 16, 1924. While still in high school, Perske began taking classes at the New York School of the Theater. Through her uncle, Perske was introduced to her screen idol, BETTE DAVIS. Davis told her that she had to be certain she wanted to act because “it’s hard work and it’s lonely.” Ever the realist, Perske continued pursue her goal despite Davis’s warning. After a year of study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Perske turned to modeling. Her lean figure and sharp features caught the attention of magazine editor Diana Vreeland, who put her on the cover of the March 1943 issue of Harper’s Bazaar. Several Hollywood luminaries, including David O. Selznick and Howard Hughes, tried to sign Perske to a film contract. Renamed Lauren Bacall, she accepted an offer from director Howard Hawks. In his film To Have and Have Not (1945), he cast her as Bogart’s love interest, though she was 25 years his junior. Hawks carefully orchestrated Bacall’s film debut. He told her how to move, speak, and 9\n\nBAEZ, JOAN\n\nproved herself a deft comedian in How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), which costarred MARILYN MONROE and BETTY GRABLE. In 1956 Bogart was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. Bacall devoted herself to nursing her husband until his death the following year. The loss of Bogart devastated Bacall. Selfdescribed as “desperate for companionship,” she was briefly engaged to Frank Sinatra. He later ended their romance. Bacall then fled Hollywood for Broadway, where she starred in the unsuccessful comedy Goodbye, Charlie (1959). In New York, she met actor Jason Robards Jr. whom she married in 1961. They had one son, actor Sam Robards. Bacall devoted much of her time during their eight-year marriage to their family life. She did, however, appear in three films, including Sex and the Single Girl (1964) and Harper (1966), and starred in the Broadway hit Cactus Flower (1965). After divorcing Robards, Bacall returned to work full time and had one of the greatest successes of her career. In 1969, she played the lead in Applause!, a musical based on the classic Bette Davis film All About Eve (1950). Her performance won Bacall a Tony Award. After an eight-year hiatus, Bacall returned to film in Murder on the Orient Express (1974). Throughout the rest of the decade, she took on occasional roles in such movies as The Shootist (1976) and H.E.A.L.T.H. (1979). Bacall also wrote By Myself (1979), an autobiography that focused on her relationship with her mother and with Bogart. As the title implied, she wrote the book without the assistance of a ghostwriter. For her effort, she won the National Book Award in 1980. In the 1980s, Bacall triumphantly returned to the stage in Woman of the Year (1980), for which she won her second Tony. In London, she also starred in a production of Tennessee Williams’s Sweet Bird of Youth (1985) directed by playwright Harold Pinter. The film industry, however, seemed to find little place for Bacall. Although she publicly proclaimed her desire to work in movies, she insisted that there were very few roles available to women her age. In most of 10\n\nher later film appearances, she has been relegated to small roles in which she is asked to play a witty, urbane woman much like herself. The best of these parts came in The Mirror Has Two Faces (1997), a romantic comedy costarring and directed by BARBRA STREISAND. Bacall’s insightful performance as Streisand’s vain and lonely mother earned her her first Oscar nomination. Though Bacall remains best loved as a film star, she has since acted most often in commercials and on the stage, including a production of Noel Coward’s Waiting in the Wings in 2000.

She was born on January 9, 1941, in Staten Island, New York but her family moved frequently in her youth. Her father, a physicist of Mexican heritage, was an academic researcher who had eschewed more lucrative defense work on moral grounds. Joan’s parents, both Quakers, nurtured her social conscience. Her mistreatment by schoolmates because of her dark skin also contributed to her sympathy with the less fortunate. While attending high school in Palo Alto, California, Baez began playing the guitar. After gradu-\n\nBAEZ, JOAN\n\nating in 1958, she enrolled at Boston University but soon became caught up in the renaissance of folk music pioneered by Pete Seeger and the Kingston Trio. Playing coffeehouses in Boston and Cambridge, Baez developed a reputation as a keen interpreter of classic folk. In the summer of 1959, she was invited to perform at the first Newport Folk Festival. Her performance made her an overnight star of the folk scene. Baez refused better-paying offers to sign with Vanguard Records, then the premier folk label. In 1960, Vanguard released Joan Baez, an album of traditional folk songs, including “House of the Rising Sun.” The first of Baez’s eight gold records, it reached number three on the charts. Baez continued to tour concert halls and campuses to growing crowds. In 1963, she played to an audience of more than 20,000 at Los Angeles’s Hollywood Bowl. Baez constantly broadened her repertoire, singing spirituals, hymns, and country and western tunes. She also sang songs by contemporary folk and rock artists, including Phil Ochs, Leonard Cohen, the Beatles, and most notably Bob Dylan. In addition to touring frequently together, Baez and Dylan became linked romantically. By the mid-1960s, Baez was using her celebrity status to bring attention to political and social causes she held dear. In 1964, she refused to pay 60 percent of her income tax as a protest against the United States’s military arms buildup. A vehement opponent of the Vietnam War, Baez was arrested two years later for blocking the doors of an armed forces induction center. She married draft resister David Harris in 1968. Soon after she became pregnant with their son Gabriel, Harris was arrested and sent to federal prison for 20 months. Baez’s antiwar stance won her both supporters and detractors. She was scheduled in 1967 to perform at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., a venue controlled by the conservative Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). When the DAR refused to allow her to play the hall, Baez gave an outdoor concert at the Washington Monument that attracted a crowd of more 30,000. Baez was\n\nalso well-received when she performed at the legendary Woodstock concert in 1969. In the 1970s, Baez developed her talents as a songwriter with such albums as Blessed Are . . . (1971) and Diamonds & Ruse (1975). The decade also brought her her greatest commercial success— a cover of The Band’s “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” one of the biggest singles of 1972. The same year, Baez began a long-term association with the human rights watchdog group Amnesty International and took a controversial tour of North Vietnam. In 1979, she helped found Humanitas International Human Rights Committee, an organization devoted to promoting human rights and nuclear disarmament through educational seminars. In her autobiography And a Voice to Sing With (1987), Baez wrote of “the ashes and silence of the 1980s”—a decade that largely ignored both her music and politics. Nevertheless, she performed to acclaim at the Live Aid concert of 1985 and garnered a Grammy nomination for “Asimbonanga,” a song from Recently (1987), her first studio album in eight years. Baez devoted much of the early 1990s on what she called “inner work,” including therapy to help her overcome stage fright and other phobias that had plagued her for years. At the same time, she discovered a new generation of singer-songwriters playing, in Baez’s words, “this folk/rock kind of music that still suits me best.” Baez’s own work was revitalized as she began touring with younger artists such as Dar Williams, Indigo Girls, and Sinead Lohan. Heading into her sixth decade in music, Baez maintained that she could now perform “a freer concert than I ever thought I could give.” As she told the New York Times in 2000, in recent years she has succeeded in “get[ting] past the myth of being Joan Baez and learn[ing] to enjoy my life.” Further Reading Baez, Joan.

Vanguard, CD set, 1993.\n\nt\n\nBAILEY, PEARL (Pearl Mae Bailey) (1918–1990) Singer, Actress\n\nPearl Bailey’s sultry voice and personal warmth combined to make her a star of cabaret, Broadway, and musical film. She was born Pearl Mae Bailey in March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Virginia, where her father was a minister. She first performed in his church, singing and dancing for the congregation. When she was four, Pearl’s parents divorced. With her mother and three older siblings, she moved first to Washington, D.C., then to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bailey considered becoming a teacher before being drawn into show business at 15, after she won $5 in a talent contest at a Washington, D.C. club. Bailey paid her dues as a chorus girl in Philadelphia and a singer and dancer on the vaudeville circuit in central Pennsylvania. Gradually, she moved into playing African-American nightclubs, before becoming a vocalist for big bands led by Cootie Williams and Edgar Hayes. By 1944, Bailey was headlining at New York’s most popular clubs. In between delivering growling renditions of such standards as “Toot-Toot Tootsie” and “Bill Bailey, Won’t You Please Come Home,” Bailey took to talking with the audience. Her folksy bantering became central to her casual performing style. Bailey made her Broadway debut in the allblack revue St. Louis Woman (1946). Her two songs were the highlight of the show and helped earn her a Donaldson Award for Broadway’s best newcomer. Over the next decade, she appeared in many musicals, including Arms and the Girl, Bless You All, and House of Flowers (1954). Bailey also carved out a career in film. Her most notable performances were the African-American musical dramas Carmen Jones (1954) and Porgy and Bess (1959). In the early 1960s, Bailey returned to 12\n\ncabaret, often with her fourth husband, jazz drummer Louis Bellson, in her band. Bailey and Bellson adopted two children, Tony and Dee Dee. The pinnacle of Bailey’s career was her performance in the lead role of a revival of Hello, Dolly! in 1967. Theater critic Clive Barnes wrote that she “took the whole musical in her hands and swung it around her neck as easily as if it were a feather boa.” The show ran for two years and earned Bailey a special Tony Award. In the 1970s, Bailey appeared regularly on television, particularly on talk shows, which proved a particularly good forum for her charmingly straightforward repartee. She also had her own syndicated cooking show, Pearl’s Kitchen. In addition to a collection of her recipes, Bailey wrote five books, including three autobiographies. Although she never finished high school, she enrolled at Georgetown University in the late 1970s. In 1985, she graduated with a degree in theology at the age of 67. Bailey also had a distinguished career as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations (UN). During the Ford, Reagan, and Bush (Sr.) administrations, she was named a special delegate to the UN and toured throughout Africa and the Middle East to promote racial harmony. In the 1980s, Bailey also became a dedicated advocate for AIDS research. After decades of heart trouble, Pearl Bailey died of a heart attack on August 17, 1990, while recovering from knee surgery. More than 2,000 people attended her funeral in Philadelphia. Speaking for the many who respected Bailey as both a performer and a humanitarian, bandleader Cab Calloway, a longtime friend, told the press, “Pearl was love, pure and simple love.” Further Reading Bailey, Pearl.

Born Josephine Carson on June 3, 1906, she was raised in poverty by her unmarried mother in St. Louis, Missouri. Otherwise, little is known for certain about her early years. She is said, however, to have witnessed the St. Louis riots of 1917, during which 39 African Americans were killed. The incident helped inspire her lifelong interest in the fight for civil rights. At 14, Josephine left home. By 18, she had already been married twice and had taken the name of her second husband, William Baker. During these years, she began her show business career, performing mostly in tent shows, traveling acts that toured African-American venues in the South. Known for her comic dancing, she made her debut on Broadway in The Chocolate Dandies (1924). The next year, Baker headed off for Paris to appear in an all-black show titled La Revue Nègre. Although she was not initially the star, from the start she was the revue’s main attraction. Baker was a sensation dancing the Charleston, a dance that excited Parisians’ newfound enthusiasm for American jazz. But she stunned her sophisticated audiences even more by performing one number in the nude. The show, specifically Baker’s appearance in it, had a great effect on Paris’s theater and art worlds. Artists such as Man Ray and Alexander Calder asked Baker to model for them. One of her greatest admirers was Pablo Picasso, who saw her as a living embodiment of the African sculpture that had inspired his Cubist period. Comparing her to an ancient Egyptian queen, Picasso declared that Baker was “the Nefertiti of now.”\n\nJosephine Baker in about 1938 (© Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS)\n\nAfter taking the Revue to Berlin, Baker returned to Paris to even greater acclaim as the star of the Folies Bergère. There she developed one of her signature acts: singing “Yes, We Have No Bananas” wearing a skirt made from bananas and little else. Now the toast of Paris, she became equally notorious for her impulsive behavior and many passionate love affairs. During the late 1920s, Baker frequently toured Europe. She also opened Chez Josephine, her own Paris nightclub, which was frequented by artists and writers, including Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein. In her performances, she began taking her singing more seriously. By the early 1930s, she was well known for the song “J’ai Deux Amours,” whose chorus explained, “I have two 13\n\nBAKER, JOSEPHINE\n\nloves: my country and Paris.” In 1937 Baker formally became a French citizen with her marriage to her third husband, Jean Lion, a handsome French millionaire. The couple separated only 14 months later and were divorced in 1941. As war broke out in Europe in 1939, Baker showed her patriotism by entertaining French troops and working for the Red Cross. After France fell to the Nazis, she moved to North Africa. There, she was asked to join the French Resistance because, as an entertainer, she could easily travel through Europe and gain access to the highest circles of society. In gratitude for her work as a Resistance courier and spy, the French government awarded her the Croix de Guerre after the war. In the late 1940s, Baker resumed her performing career, appearing largely in Europe. In 1951, however, she made a controversial tour of the United States. Baker drew headlines as she refused to work in any theater that would not admit blacks. She was also involved in a wellpublicized incident at the Stork Club, one of New York City’s leading nightspots. When the club personnel refused to serve her, she became angry and lashed out at fellow patron and newspaper columnist Walter Winchell for not coming to her defense. A regular at the Stork Club, Winchell retaliated by denouncing her in his popular column, calling her a communist and, even more outrageously, a Nazi sympathizer. However preposterous, his charges left a taint on her reputation in America. Nevertheless, Baker continued to speak out against segregation. In addition to performing at benefits for civil rights groups, she delivered a notable speech at the Lincoln Memorial alongside Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1963 March on Washington. Baker also launched a more personal mission to promote racial harmony. With her fourth husband, Jo Bouillion (whom she married in 1947), she began adopting children of different racial and religious backgrounds and bringing them to live in her French chateau Les Milandes. Between 1954 and 1965, Baker took in 10 boys and two girls, 14\n\nwhom she called collectively the “rainbow tribe.” Originally, she planned to turn Les Milandes into a tourist attraction, devoted to demonstrating that people of different race could live in peace. Baker, however, grossly underestimated the enormous costs of renovating Les Milandes to her standards and of raising her large family. Despite her efforts to bring in more money through touring, her debts continued to rise. In 1969 Les Milandes was sold at a public auction. Now homeless, Baker and her children were given refuge by Princess Grace (formerly GRACE KELLY), who provided them with a small villa outside of Monaco. Baker’s financial difficulties deepened as her failing health began to interfere with her work. Nevertheless, by the mid-1970s, she was able to stage a comeback. Baker had a successful engagement at New York’s Carnegie Hall in 1973. The next year, she triumphed in Josephine, a retrospective of her career that debuted in Monte Carlo. Baker brought the show to Paris, where it premiered on April 8, 1975. Two days later she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, which took her life on April 14. With her death, Josephine Baker—the raw beauty who had helped to define Parisian culture during the Jazz Age—became the first American woman to receive a state funeral in France.

She appeared on weekly series almost continually for 23 years, always playing a variation on “Lucy,” the wacky, red-headed scatterbrain who, unlike Ball, had ambitions that far outstripped her talents. Born on August 8, 1911, Lucille Désirée Ball overcame a desperately unhappy childhood. She spent her early years in Jamestown, New York, where her father died when she was three. Her mother remarried and left Ball in the care of her stepgrandparents, stern disciplinarians who tried to stifle Lucille’s natural bent toward theatricality. With her mother’s support, Ball left home at 15 to attend John Murray Anderson/Robert Milton School of the Theater and Dance in New York City. Doubtful of her own talent and intimidated by her fellow students (who included the future film star BETTE DAVIS), Ball quit the school and returned to Jamestown after only a month. She quickly recovered from her bout of insecurity and started visiting New York to find work as an actress. A striking beauty, she had more initial success as a model. Her image in an ad for Chesterfield cigarettes attracted an agent and won her a role in Roman Scandals (1933), an extravaganza directed by Busby Berkeley and starring Eddie Cantor. With characteristic focus, Ball used the opportunity to watch and listen, hoping to learn everything possible about working in films. Show business legend holds that when, for a comic bit, the filmmaker needed a beauty to have her face sprayed with mud, Ball volunteered. Impressed with her pluck, Berkeley supposedly said, “Get that girl’s name. That’s the one who will make it.” Ball began appearing in small film roles and was placed under contract first by Columbia and then by RKO. Although she received regular work, the film industry had difficulty using Ball well: With the looks of an ingenue and the spirit of a comic, she defied attempts to type her in conventional\n\nroles. Her best early role was in Stage Door (1937), where as a smart-mouthed aspiring actress she stood out in a cast that also included KATHARINE HEPBURN, GINGER ROGERS, and EVE ARDEN. In 1940 Ball was cast in the film version of the Broadway musical Too Many Girls. One of the performers recruited from the Broadway cast was Desi Arnaz, a young Cuban musician who was five years her junior. Immediately, Ball and Arnaz were attracted to each other, even though early in their romance, it was obvious their personalities clashed. Despite their tendency toward frequent and ferocious arguments, the practical Ball and reckless Arnaz were married within months. Ball thought she had found her breakthrough role as a bitter nightclub singer in The Big Street (1942). But, instead, soon after it appeared, RKO chose not to renew her contract. Ball, then 33, signed up with another studio, Metro-GoldwynMayer (MGM). Seeing her years as an ingenue warning, she welcomed the studio’s attempts to remake her image. As part of her MGM makeover, her brown hair was dyed a fiery red designed to make her stand out in Technicolor films. Although her red hair would become her trademark, Ball’s stint working for MGM was a disappointment. A studio that specialized in musicals, it produced few vehicles that could showcase the nonsinging Ball. After several years of being cast in ever smaller parts, MGM released her from her contract in 1946. From 1947 to 1951, Ball starred in the radio program My Favorite Husband, a role that brought her to the attention of the early television industry. When CBS approached Ball with the idea of featuring her in a television version of her show, she was hesitant at first. At the time, movie industry leaders so looked down on the new medium of television that starring in a television series would essentially end any chance she would ever have at movie stardom. The offer, however, was still intriguing to Ball for personal reasons. She had been looking for a project on which she and Arnaz could work together, believing that might help save their rocky marriage. A bandleader, Arnaz was often on tour. His infidelities while away had 15\n\nBALL, LUCILLE\n\nalready led Ball to file for divorce in 1944, but the couple soon reconciled. Ball proposed that Arnaz be cast as the male lead in My Favorite Husband, but CBS balked. A Cuban American with a strong accent, Arnaz did not strike the network executives as right for the part of a midwestern banker. They were also not convinced that America would embrace Ball and Arnaz as a couple because of their mixed ethnicity. To change their minds, Ball and Arnaz set out on a touring act, blending music and comedy. Hailed by Variety as “a socko new act,” the show was such a success that CBS became interested in designing a program for the couple. The enterprise, though, was still considered so risky that CBS insisted Ball and Arnaz take a cut in salary. They agreed in exchange for CBS’s grant of ownership of the show to Desilu, a production company the couple borrowed $5,000 to form. Six months pregnant with her first child, Lucie Désirée Arnaz, Ball filmed a pilot for I Love Lucy in early 1951. On October 15, the program premiered and quickly became the most popular show on television. At its height, as many as two-thirds of American families with television sets were faithful viewers. One of the most successful shows in the history of the medium, it was rated the number-one show for four years of its six-year run. I Love Lucy featured the adventures of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo, played by Ball and Arnaz, and their friends and landlords Ethel and Fred Mertz (played by Vivian Vance and William Frawley). The show often focused on the mayhem set in motion by Lucy’s desire for a performing career against Ricky’s wishes. At the core of its success was Ball’s flair for slapstick, a talent her film career had never exploited well. Using Ball’s comic skill and innate appeal to their best advantage, I Love Lucy struck a chord with the public almost immediately. Recognizing the effect, Ball once recalled, “I never found a place of my own, never became truly confident, until, in the Lucy character, I began to create something that was truly mine. The potential was there. Lucy released it.” 16\n\nI Love Lucy was also an innovator in the television industry. At Ball and Arnaz’s insistence, it was filmed before a live audience using three cameras, a technique then rare but now almost universally used for situation comedies. It also explored new subject matter when Ball became pregnant with her second child during the show’s second season. She persuaded CBS to allow her character also to become pregnant, leading to one of the most successful ratings stunts in television history. On January 9, 1953, Lucille Ball gave birth to Desi Arnaz Jr. by a cesarean section scheduled for the day that Lucy Ricardo gave birth to “Little Ricky” on I Love Lucy. A record-making 44 million viewers tuned in to see Little Ricky’s arrival. While still America’s number-one show, I Love Lucy went off the air in 1957. Although Ball and Arnaz reprised their characters in a series of specials, their offscreen marriage had completely unraveled, owing largely to Arnaz’s drinking and philandering. They finally divorced in 1960. The next year, Ball married a young comedian, Gary Morton, who remained her husband until her death. In 1962 Ball also severed professional ties with Arnaz by buying out his share in Desilu. Because of their television work, the production company had become so successful that it was able to buy RKO, the movie studio that years ago had unceremoniously declined to renew Ball’s contract. From 1962 through 1967, Ball served as Desilu’s president and CEO, giving her more power in the television industry than any woman had held before. Although Desilu began to struggle financially, during Ball’s tenure it produced two enduring television classics—Star Trek and Mission Impossible. Ball finally sold the company to Paramount for $18 million, when she decided she could no longer perform both the role of executive and of television star. After I Love Lucy, Ball returned to television in The Lucy Show, which was later renamed Here’s Lucy. From 1962 to 1974, she played a widow and working mother whose constant scheming exhausted her boss Mr. Moody (Gale Gordon). Initially, The Lucy Show reunited Ball with Vivian\n\nBANKHEAD,TALLULAH\n\nVance, and on Here’s Lucy she eventually costarred with her two teenage children. Even after she left episodic television, Ball still appeared regularly on specials and occasionally in films. She also made a splash on Broadway in Mame in 1974 and was recognized for her dramatic range in Stone Pillow (1983), a television movie in which she played a bag lady. A late effort to return to television in a situation comedy, however, proved a disaster. The much-hyped Life with Lucy (1986) drew few viewers and was yanked from the air after only eight episodes. The debacle did little to tarnish Ball’s reputation as the queen of television comedy. Three weeks after the last Life with Lucy program aired, she was in Washington, D.C., to receive from President Ronald Reagan a Kennedy Center Award, the United States’s highest honor for a performer. Following her death on April 26, 1989, the many glowing tributes from her peers and fans gave further testament to her enduring appeal and influence.

Born on January 31, 1902, Bankhead was a member of one of the most distinguished families in Huntsville, Alabama. (Both her father and grand-\n\nfather had been U.S. congressmen.) Several weeks after her birth, Bankhead’s mother died, and she and her older sister were sent to live with relatives in the town of Jasper. She spent much of her youth, however, in boarding schools, where at an early age she showed her flair for the dramatic. Her show business career began in 1917 after she won a contest held by Picture Play magazine. As her prize, she traveled to New York City to appear in a bit movie part. She stayed on in the city, taking up residence at the Algonquin Hotel, a haunt for literary wits of the era. The flamboyant Bankhead became a favorite of Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, and others of the famed “Algonquin Round Table” in the hotel bar. At 21, Bankhead decided to try her luck on the English stage. She was an immediate sensation, although few of the plays in which she performed were memorable. The attraction instead was Bankhead herself. Her larger-than-life persona— witty, urbane, and dressed to the hilt—was especially popular with young women. To them, Bankhead represented a new breed, an independent woman who felt no compunction to obey society’s constraints. Bankhead spent eight years in London, but in 1931 the money of Hollywood lured her home. She signed a five-picture contract with Paramount, which misused her by trying to promote her as a femme fatale. By 1934, she had returned to the stage, this time in New York. Bankhead’s acting style was highly mannered, guided far more by natural instinct than studied technique. Her lack of formal training was never more evident than when she appeared in Antony and Cleopatra with John Emery, an actor she married in 1937. Emery’s performance was highly praised, while Bankhead’s suffered in the comparison. In 1941, the marriage ended in divorce. Bankhead, however, did earn great acclaim for two classic roles she originated: Regina in Lillian Hellman’s The Little Foxes (1939) and Sabina in Thornton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth (1942). For both roles, she received the award for the best acting of the year from the New York Drama Critics Circle. 17\n\nBARA,THEDA\n\nIn 1944, she was also recognized by the New York Film Critics Circle for her performance in her one great film, Alfred Hitchcock’s Lifeboat (1944). Bankhead retired from the stage in 1950, but found a second career as a star of radio. As the host of the popular Big Show (1950–52), she interviewed celebrities and entertained her listeners with references to an exaggerated rivalry between her and BETTE DAVIS, who performed several of her signature stage roles on screen. During the 1950s, she also hosted NBC’s All-Star Revue (1952–53) and frequently had guest appearances on other television programs. Bankhead made her final stage appearance in 1964 in Tennessee Williams’s The Milk Train Doesn’t Stop Here Anymore. Her return, however, was hardly a triumph. Many years of hard living had taken their toll. Cast as an aging actress destroyed by drugs and liquor, Bankhead was more living her part than playing it. She made only two more professional appearances on television—one on Batman, the other on The Tonight Show—before her death from emphysema on December 12, 1968. Further Reading Bret, David.

The daughter of a prosperous garment factory owner, she spent two years at the University of Cincinnati before her family moved to New York City in 1905. There, she began pursuing an acting career with limited success. In addition to working as a film extra, she made her Broadway debut in The Devil (1908), billed (using her mother’s maiden name) as Theodosia de Coppet. Though undistinguished, her early work brought her to the attention of film director Frank Powell, who cast her as the lead in A Fool There Was (1915). Based on a play inspired by Rudyard Kipling’s poem The Vampire, the silent movie told the story of a seductress’s destruction of an upstanding married man who falls under her spell. Fool was an enormous success, and Goodman, now acting under the stage name Theda Bara, became an instant star. Her new acclaim was largely due to a publicity campaign orchestrated by the Fox Film Company. With her name, Bara was given a new personality and history by studio’s publicity machine. The press was told that she was born in an oasis in the Sahara Desert, the product of an illicit relationship between a French artist and his Egyptian mistress. “Theda Bara” was said to be an anagram for “Arab Death,” a claim seemingly supported by publicity stills that showed a heavily made-up Bara dressed in exotic costumes and surrounded by skulls and skeletons. As overblown as Bara’s public persona was, it struck a chord with her mostly female audience. Some female moviegoers were so appalled by Bara’s man-destroying “vamp” that they destroyed posters bearing her image and spearheaded church-sponsored campaigns to ban her films. More, however, found a guilty pleasure in Bara’s screen image, which offered an exciting alternative to the pure and virtuous female characters that then dominated films. Her more adventurous female fans copied her dark makeup and made a catchphrase of her famous line, “Kiss me, my fool.” Others sought her advice about love and sex in the hundreds of fan letters she received each week. Signed to a contract with Fox, Bara made some 40 more films. In most, she played a variation of the\n\nBARRYMORE, ETHEL\n\nBara tried to revive her vamp character on Broadway in The Blue Flame (1920) but was laughed off the stage. She made a few more attempts at a comeback before retiring in 1926. Her last film was Madame Mystery (1926), a comedy short directed by Stan Laurel, in which Bara herself lampooned the roles that had made her famous. She spent the rest of her life out of the limelight, sharing a Beverly Hills home with one of her film directors, Charles J. Brabin, whom she married in 1921. On April 7, 1955, Bara died of cancer at the age of 69. With the exception of A Fool There Was, Bara’s films are all now lost. Still, the screen’s original vamp has had a long-lasting influence. Through her phenomenal success, she was the first to show Hollywood the popular appeal of the “bad girl”—a lesson the film world has well remembered ever since.

A quiet, refined woman, Bara sought to broaden her range in less sensational roles, such as the female lead in an early film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet (1916). Her public, however, was only interested in seeing Bara as an evil woman, and their enthusiasm for even that persona was short-lived. By 1919, when her Fox contract expired, Bara had become a frequent subject of parody. Although her over-the-top screen image seemed liberating at first, film audiences came to see its inherent ridiculousness. While changing popular tastes following the horror of World War I probably contributed to the public’s rejection of Bara, she herself believed that filmgoers had merely become more sophisticated. She once explained that early in her career her fans “thought that the stars of the screen were the way they saw them. Now they know it is all make-believe.”\n\nBodeen, DeWitt.

Her parents, Maurice Barrymore and Georgiana Drew, spent much of her childhood on tour, so she and her two brothers, Lionel and John, were cared for by their maternal grandmother, Louisa Lane Drew. One of the leading stage comedians of the 19th century, Drew was also the manager of Philadelphia’s Arch Street Theater for 30 years. At six, Ethel was sent the Academy of Notre Dame, the convent boarding school her mother 19\n\nBARRYMORE, ETHEL\n\nhad attended. In 1893, however, her mother removed her from the academy so that the girl could accompany her to California. Ill with tuberculosis, Georgiana Drew hoped the warm climate would restore her health, but instead she died after several months. Ethel, only 13, was left to arrange for her return to the East and the shipment of her mother’s casket. In Philadelphia, Ethel went back to school, but soon her education came to an end. As her grandmother left her post at Arch Street and her father remarried, she was told that she would have to go to work to earn her own livelihood. The situation put an end to her childhood dream of becoming a concert pianist. Instead, she practically turned to the family business. “Acting was, after all, the only thing I could do best,” she later remarked. Barrymore made her stage debut in 1894, appearing in a touring production of The Rivals starring her grandmother. She was then taken under the wing of her uncle, John Drew, one of Broadway’s greatest stars. He arranged for her to appear in a series of small stage roles while serving as the understudy for more substantial parts. Her early appearances earned her an invitation to appear in Secret Service (1897) in London. The arrival of the American beauty not only excited theatergoers—it also thrilled English high society, who quickly embraced the sophisticated, yet fresh Barrymore. When she returned to New York City, she left behind a number of rejected suitors, including the future prime minister Winston Churchill. To Barrymore’s surprise, she found that her London success had made her a celebrity in her native land. She was soon being offered leading roles and in 1901 became an established star in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines. Widely admired for her regal manner, Barrymore was particularly popular with young women, who took to emulating the clothing and hairstyles she wore on stage. Cast increasingly in ingenue roles, Barrymore longed for more serious, substantial parts. She was particularly eager to show off her acting in order to combat rumors that was just a beautiful clotheshorse with little real talent. In 1910, she 20\n\nEthel Barrymore in about 1900 (Library of Congress, neg. no. USZ62-97334)\n\nfinally earned the respect she craved playing a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage in MidChannel. The success came on the heels of her own marriage to Russell Griswold Colt, the wealthy son of the president of the United States Rubber Company, in 1909. The couple had three children— Samuel, Ethel, and John. In 1918 Barrymore had another success with Déclassée, which ran for more than 200 performances. Her triumph, though, ushered in a period of professional and personal turmoil. She appeared in a series of lightweight, badly-received plays and had a brief, disastrous run as Shakespeare’s Juliet, a part she was deemed too old to play. At the same time, her marriage to Colt fell apart. The two were divorced in 1923. Barrymore’s fortunes reversed in 1926, when she was cast in the lead in W. Somerset Maugham’s The Constant Wife. She appeared in the play for three years in New York and on tour. Now recog-\n\nBERG, GERTRUDE\n\nnized as the grande dame of the American theater, she received a permanent monument to her achievements when the Shubert brothers named their new theater after her in 1928. Despite Barrymore’s fame, she continued to have difficulty finding good vehicles for her talents as she grew older. Adding to her frustration over the lack of good roles, she also faced a battle with the Internal Revenue Service, which held that she owed a fortune in back taxes. Her desperation led her to set aside her disdain for the film industry and accept a high-paying offer to appear in Rasputin and the Empress (1932). The film also starred her brothers Lionel and John, both of whom had earned their own substantial reputations as actors. The movie marked the only time the three Barrymore siblings performed together. To further dispel her financial crisis, Ethel Barrymore also performed in her own radio program on NBC, in which she played many of the roles she had made famous on the stage. By the late 1930s, Barrymore had returned to the theater but did not find a solid role until 1940, when she starred in The Corn Is Green. In her greatest stage success, she played Miss Moffitt, a Welsh schoolteacher determined to educate a young coal miner. Receiving the best reviews of her career, she gave 461 performances on Broadway. While touring with the show, she appeared in the film None But the Lonely Heart opposite Cary Grant. Her performance won her an Oscar as best supporting actress in 1944. Soon afterward, Barrymore suffered a near-fatal bout of pneumonia. Concerned about her health, she decided to move to California. In demand ever since her Academy Award win, Barrymore made 20 films between 1946 and 1957, appearing mostly in supporting roles. Her late film work brought her three more Oscar nominations for The Spiral Staircase (1946), The Paradine Case (1947), and Pinky (1949). She also briefly hosted her own television program, The Ethel Barrymore Theatre. After more than 60 years of acclaim, Barrymore died on June 18, 1959, and was buried next to her brothers in a Beverly Hills cemetery,\n\nreuniting in death the most celebrated siblings in American theater and film.

In 1918, she married Lewis Berg, a chemical engineer, with whom she had two children. While raising her family, Gertrude Berg took playwriting courses at Columbia University and started writing radio plays. In 1929 she made her first sale to NBC, but her show, a soap opera titled Effie and Laura, was canceled after one episode. The same year she had far better luck with The Rise of the Goldbergs. Later renamed The Goldbergs, the show ran for 20 years and became one of the most popular programs in the history of radio. In addition to writing most of the episodes, Berg starred as Molly Goldberg, the matriarch of a Jewish family from the Bronx. A self-sacrificing fount of common sense, the character was largely responsible for introducing the type of the “Jewish 21\n\nBERGEN, CANDICE\n\nmother” to American popular culture. Although Berg’s characters were sometimes faulted as stereotypical portrayals of Jewish immigrants, her gentle humor sketched the Goldbergs with such warmth and affection that they were embraced by a weekly audience of millions. Berg proved to be a skillful businesswoman, maintaining control over the show she created and negotiating advantageous contracts for herself. She also made the most of The Goldbergs’ success by taking her characters into other media. In 1948, her play Molly and Me, was a hit on Broadway, and in 1951 she brought the Goldbergs to the screen in Molly. In addition, Berg published Goldberg short stories and even authored The Molly Goldberg Cookbook (1955). Gertrude Berg also oversaw in 1949 The Goldbergs’ transition from radio to television, becoming in the process one of the few women to write for television in its early days. Although The Goldbergs on television never equaled the success it had had on radio, the show ran for six seasons. In the early 1950s, the show was almost canceled when Berg refused to buckle under to a sponsor’s pressure to fire her costar Philip Loeb, who was accused of having communist sympathies. The show was saved only after Loeb decided to resign. To combat a fall in ratings, Berg moved the Goldbergs from the Bronx to the suburbs in 1955. Nevertheless, the program was canceled the following year. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Berg transformed herself into a Broadway star. Among the plays in which she performed were The Solid Gold Cadillac (1956), The Matchmaker (1957), and Dear Me, the Sky Is Falling (1967). Her most memorable work, however, was in The Majority of One (1959), a drama that tackled such difficult issues as racial prejudice and the loneliness of her widowed character. Berg’s sensitive performance won her a Tony Award. While preparing to open in a new play, she died of natural causes on September 15, 1966. Further Reading Berg, Gertrude, with Cherney Berg.

Born May 6, 1946, Bergen is the daughter of radio and film comedian Edgar Bergen. At her birth, the press announced that Charlie McCarthy—the dummy Edgar used in his famed ventriloquist act—now had a sister. Candice indeed had an intense case of sibling rivalry with the wooden puppet. In her autobiography, Knock Wood (1984), she recalled the haunting memory of her father placing her on one knee and Charlie on the other, using his voice to speak for both of them. Candice was raised in Beverly Hills, California, where most of her playmates were the children of Hollywood stars. Disturbed by the effect this pampered environment was having on their daughter, the Bergens sent Candice to a finishing school in Switzerland when she was 14. After a few months, Candice greeted her visiting parents, offering them one of her cigarettes and a drink. The Bergens immediately took her back to Beverly Hills for the rest of her high school education. In 1963, Candice Bergen enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to study art history. However, she was more interested in her burgeoning modeling career than in her studies. After flunking out, Bergen moved to New York City, where she attracted the attention of the director Sidney Lumet. He cast her in The Group (1966), in the daring role of Lakey, a young lesbian. Now in demand for ingenue parts, Bergen appeared in a string of undistinguished films, including The Sand Pebbles (1966), T. R. Baskin (1971), and The Wind and the Lion (1975). Critics inevitably were awed by her beauty, though most shared Bergen’s own sense that her acting was stiff and stilted.\n\nBERGMAN, INGRID\n\nReviews were far kinder to her layered performance in Carnal Knowledge (1971), a black comedy in which she played a Smith College student romanced by two roommates played by Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel. In the 1970s, Bergen also developed an accomplished career as a photojournalist. With her Hollywood pedigree, she was able to interview top stars, such as Paul Newman and Lee Marvin. In addition, she won coveted international assignments, including the job of reporting on Kenya’s Masai tribe for National Geographic. Esquire, Life, and Playboy were among the other national magazines that published Bergen’s work. As an actress, Bergen had a breakthrough in Starting Over (1979), in which she had a small role as Burt Reynolds’s self-indulgent ex-wife. Not wanting to compete with her father, she had previously shied away from comedy. The film’s showcase of her comedic flair, however, won her some of her best reviews as well as an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. She returned to comedy in 1981 in the critically disparaged Rich and Famous. In 1979 Bergen met French film director Louis Malle, whom she married the next year. The couple split their time between homes in Los Angeles, New York, and the countryside of France. Bergen gave birth to their daughter, Chloe, in 1985. Bergen set off on still another career path in 1988, when she lobbied for the lead role on Murphy Brown, a television situation comedy about a straight-talking journalist working on a television news magazine. Contrasting Murphy’s professional success with her personal loneliness, the show’s creator, Diane English, called it “a sort of cautionary tale about getting what you wished for.” From the outset, the series was a hit, and earned Bergen five Emmy Awards. It also placed her at the center of a national controversy when Vice President Dan Quayle denounced as immoral a story line that had the pregnant and unmarried Murphy deciding to have her baby and raise him on her own. During the 10-year run of Murphy Brown, Malle fell ill. He died of cancer in 1995. Five years later, Bergen married real estate mogul Marshall\n\nRose, a longtime friend. Also in 2000, Bergen began hosting Exhale, an hour-long talk show for the cable channel Oxygen. A fitting showcase for Bergen’s intelligence and charm, the show has featured such high-profile guests as JODIE FOSTER, Hillary Clinton, and Madeleine Albright. Bergen also returned to film acting in 2001 with a supporting role in the comedy Miss Congeniality. Further Reading Bergen, Candice. Knock Wood. New York: Linden Press, 1984.

Born on August 29, 1915, in Stockholm, Sweden, she was raised by her father, Justus, after her mother died when Ingrid was three. Justus Bergman nurtured Ingrid’s interest in the arts. Their trips to the theater inspired her to crave a career as an actress. After Justus’s death, 13-year-old Ingrid went to live with her uncle and aunt, who were far less sympathetic to her ambitions. While attending a private girls’ school, she began working as a movie extra against their wishes. In 1933, Bergman won a scholarship to the school of the prestigious Royal Dramatic Theater, the alma mater of film star GRETA GARBO. The next year, she won her first movie part and was subsequently offered a contract by Svensk Filmindustri. After a series of small roles, she was given the lead in 23\n\nBERGMAN, INGRID\n\nher sixth film, Intermezzo (1937). Bergman played a young pianist who has an affair with married violinist, but in the end sacrifices her love so that he can return to his family. The romance made her one of the most sought-after actresses in Sweden. In the year of its release, she also married dentist and medical student Peter Lindstrom. She gave birth to their child, Pia, in 1938. After several more films in Sweden and one in Germany, Bergman was called to Hollywood by producer David O. Selznick. He was so impressed by her work in Intermezzo that he wanted to produce an American remake. The second time around, the film again made her star to watch, this time in Hollywood. Selznick signed his new ingenue to a seven-year contract. Her new studio began promoting Bergman as a natural beauty, pointing out that, unlike most starlets, she had not been transformed by the makeup department to seem more glamorous. Even so, Hollywood created its own image of Bergman, casting her often as an innocent. Bergman resented the mold and lobbied for meatier roles. When Selznick lent her to another studio for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1942), she convinced the director, Victor Fleming, to allow her and LANA TURNER to swap roles so that she could play a prostitute instead of Jekyll’s dutiful fiancée. In 1942, Selznick again loaned Bergman out for Casablanca, the film that would make her a legend. As Ilsa Laszlo, Bergman effectively played a woman torn between love and doing what was right, as she had earlier in Intermezzo. With the movie’s success, she became one of America’s hottest stars. Bergman followed Casablanca with a string of popular films. In 1944, she earned her first Academy Award for Gaslight (1946), in which she portrayed a wife driven mad by her husband. Bergman also made two memorable movies with director Alfred Hitchcock—Spellbound (1945) and Notorious (1946). When her contract with Selznick expired in 1946, she took advantage of her newfound freedom to appear as Joan of Arc on Broadway in Joan of Lorraine. The play broke box-office records and 24\n\nIngrid Bergman with Charles Boyer in Gaslight (1944) (Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive)\n\nwon Bergman a Tony Award. However, her next three films—Arch of Triumph (1948), Joan of Arc (1948), and Under Capricorn (1949)—failed to strike a chord with moviegoers or critics. Hoping to reinvigorate her movie career, Bergman wrote to Italian director Roberto Rossellini, expressing her desire to work with him. When he agreed to write a part for her, she traveled to Rome to meet him. Their film collaboration quickly turned into a love affair. Bergman, whose marriage was already crumbling, had had several secret extramarital relationships. But her affair with Rossellini was discovered by the press and widely reported, especially after Bergman became pregnant with Rossellini’s child. Once embraced by the American public for her seeming purity, Bergman was suddenly the target of savage attacks on her morality. Colorado Senator Edwin C. Johnson even denounced her on the senate floor as “a\n\nBOW, CLARA\n\npowerful influence for evil.” As Bergman’s daughter Pia once observed, she went “from being a saint to a tramp in a few days.” Freshly divorced from Lindstrom, Bergman married Rossellini in 1950 soon after giving birth to their son, Robertino. Two years later, they had twin girls, Isotta and Isabella, the latter of whom would become a noted model and actress. For the next seven years, Bergman acted exclusively in Rossellini’s films, including Stromboli (1950) and Viaggio in Italia (1953), but none were successful. Their relationship grew equally troubled. In 1958, their marriage was annulled, and Bergman married theatrical producer Lars Schmidt. She and Schmidt were divorced in 1975. After seven years of exile, Bergman made a triumphant return to Hollywood, playing the title role in Anastasia (1956). She won her second Oscar for best actress for the movie, a gesture widely interpreted as a symbol of forgiveness of her past indiscretions. Two years later, Cary Grant, her costar in Notorious, introduced her as a presenter at the Academy Awards, pointedly calling her “a great actress and a great lady” to thunderous applause. Though clearly back in the Hollywood fold, Bergman found fewer good film and stage roles. Her later films were relatively light fare, such as Indiscreet (1958), Cactus Flower (1969), and Murder on the Orient Express (1974), which earned her a third Oscar, this time for best supporting actress. After being diagnosed with breast cancer, she made one last great film, Autumn Sonata (1978). Directed by Ingmar Bergman (the two are unrelated), the movie brought together the two giants of the Swedish cinema to tell the story of a renowned pianist confronting her failure as a mother. Capping her occasional work in television, Bergman found her final role in A Woman Called Golda (1982), a biography of Golda Meir, for which she won an Emmy Award. On August 29, 1982—Bergman’s 67th birthday—she finally succumbed to cancer. In a late interview, she looked back on her often tumultuous life and career without regrets. Bergman said, “When I was very young in Sweden, I used to\n\npray ‘God, please don’t let me have a dull life.’ And He obviously heard me.” Further Reading Bergman, Ingrid, and Alan Burgess.

Scott Fitzgerald the “quintessence of what the term ‘flapper’ signifies,” Clara Bow was American film’s greatest sex symbol during the 1920s. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on July 29, 1905, she survived a brutal childhood, marred by poverty and her mother’s severe mental illness. Bow found comfort in the movies and dreams of stardom, especially after winning a beauty contest that gave her a small movie part as a prize. After several years in Hollywood, she secured a contract with independent producer B. P. Schulberg that initially paid her $50 a week. Embued with a strong work ethic, Bow made 55 films between 1923 and 1930. In most, she portrayed a young working girl who asserted her independence by smoking, drinking, wearing short skirts, and dancing all night. Although other stars also adopted the pose of the flapper, Bow, with her pixyish face and fiery, bobbed hair, was by far the most popular, receiving at her height more 25\n\nBRICE, FANNY\n\nthan 40,000 fan letters a week. She was known by the public as the “It Girl” after appearing in the 1927 film adaptation of popular author Elinor Glyn’s novel It. “It” became a euphemism for the earthy, highly energized sex appeal of Bow—a distinct departure from the exotic allure of earlier film sirens such as THEDA BARA. Bow’s life was sensational offscreen as well. The lover of many of Hollywood’s leading men and a cohort of gangsters and bootleggers, Bow was dubbed “crisis-a-day Clara” by her producer. Her unconventional love life prompted a major public scandal when her former secretary Daisy Defoe wrote a tell-all book in retaliation for Bow’s accusations of embezzlement. Defoe’s disloyalty lead to one of several nervous breakdowns Bow suffered during her film career. It also encouraged her studio, Paramount, to fire her in 1931. Paramount, however, had already seen evidence that Bow’s film popularity was waning. With the advent of sound movies and stationary microphones, the frantic movements of Bow’s signature acting style had to be reined in, eliminating much of her screen appeal. Within six months, Bow married cowboy film star Rex Bell and retired to his ranch in Nevada. She made several attempts at returning to film, but her efforts were defeated by bad reviews. By the mid1930s, Bow had given up on Hollywood and devoted herself to raising her and Bell’s two sons. Yet, even in the relative quiet of her later life, she continued to be plagued by insomnia and a growing fear that she had inherited her mother’s mental problems. By the early 1950s, Bow had moved permanently to Los Angeles in order to be closer to her psychiatrists and to a mental hospital in which she was periodically institutionalized. Largely removed from the public eye, the former “It Girl” died of a heart attack in her home on September 26, 1965. Further Reading Morella, Joe and Edward Z. Epstein.

Born Fanny Borach on October 29, 1891, she grew up in Newark, New Jersey, where her parents owned seven saloons. She had an early taste of show business while performing impromptu song and dance numbers on tables at the Borachs’ establishments. Fed up with her husband’s gambling, Brice’s mother, Rose, left him and moved her children to Brooklyn, New York.
