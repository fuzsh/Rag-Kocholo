        "text": "Hello Winter\n\nNovember 11, 2020: Well, the month of November hereabouts in close proximately to the San Gabriel Mountains certainly did herald in some weather surprises. It was nice of Mother Nature to put an end to the wildfire threat, but I wasn’t quite ready for rain, graupel, snow, and freezing temperatures.\n\nHere and there with Daylight Saving Time ended, trees were beginning to change colors. As nighttime temperatures began to cool, green trees stopped making chlorophyll and leaves turned to yellow and orange and sometimes to crimson red. Driving around the Tri-Community, those fall colors on taller trees provided striking accent points to rust-colored buckwheat and yellow-colored wild sage blossoms.\n\nHowever, in one fell swoop, strong winds blasted the trees bare. With the first band of winds there were considerable drifts of leaves on the ground. Subsequent gusts swept the ground clear, probably depositing a fair amount of debris into the rain gutters. As the wild gray sage froze, vibrant goldenrod-colored blossoms faded into a washed-out pastel hue.\n\nAnd so with all the dire weather indications, it was farewell to warm weather and a forced march to winterize everything on the structures and surrounding landscape. The first chore was cleaning out the rain gutters. I’m always amazed with how much sand and dirt are deposited there from dust devils. I have screens to prevent leaves from clogging the downspouts, but the other debris can’t be ignored. It is oh so comforting to hear rainwater trickling down the gutters instead of watching a cascade splashing against windows.\n\nNext, screens for vents proving air circulation under the floor and in the attic need to be checked to prevent critters from taking up residence. After that, most but not all of the vents should be covered with insulated material. A little circulation prevents moisture condensation but also requires foam insulation on all water pipes. The same holds true with exterior hose bibs. The caveat here is that the insulation on one hose bib should be easy to remove to accommodate a garden hose in case of a fire. And then again, while most hoses should be drained and rolled up to be stored in a garage, shed, or under a covered patio roof for the winter, keep one hose in an easy-to-reach location. In times of need, a hose buried under snow or misplaced somewhere is useless.\n\nAfter pruning back tree branches over roofs that could collapse under a heavy snow or stiff wind, it’s time to throw a log on the fire, play some tranquil music, and observe the beauty of a winter landscape. As winter sets in and the wood stove crackles, being prepared is a welcome solace.\n\nPresidential Election Dynamics\n\nHaving yet to write my opinion column at 3:30 p.m. on November 3, but not knowing what the topic would be, I began watching the tabulation on MSNBC hosted by Rachel Maddow and Brian Williams. After all, I still had plenty of time to select a topic because my normal window to make a decision and begin writing is 9:00 p.m. Although I really didn’t want to write anything political, it became obvious that after four years of Donald Trump being center stage, it would not be easy to simply limp away from the real news.\n\nFortunately, along the way, I began to take notes of the tabulation process and became captivated with the real star of the evening, Steve Kornacki. Commanding several screens with up-to-the-minute results from states, counties, and cities across the Nation, he was also able to pull up statistics from prior elections to strike comparisons or not.\n\nThe most important factor was Joe Biden would have to do better than Hilary Clinton in the Rust Belt States to secure more Electoral College votes than Trump. A very poignant aspect was this was purely a mathematical exercise with personality traits cast aside. However, the most confusing issue was how each state and when each state in the Union would tabulate three types of election ballots. The quandary involved early-voter ballots, mail-in ballots, and same-day ballots.\n\nFor the first time in political history due to the fears of contracting the COVID-19 virus, an unprecedented number of voters chose early voting or mail-in procedures over traditional same-day voting. That’s how the Nation entered into a dark zone of convoluted mechanisms that turned the 2020 Presidential Election into a never before experienced quagmire.\n\nAccording to the new Donald Trump Dictionary of Semantics, when it appeared that Democrats might usurp traditional and stellar accomplishment of Republicans to register voters and get out the vote with wide use of mail-in (absentee) voting, he simply changed the definition of that procedure and urged Republicans to vote in person on the same day as the election. The same held true with early voting. That opened the floodgate for an array of legal challenges.\n\nWith each state legally in control of timeframes for receiving and tabulating ballots, the ongoing dilemma of the Electoral College became passé. As it turned out, many states counted same-day ballots first and then bogged down in tabulating massive amounts of early vote and mail-in ballots. With same-day ballots favoring Trump, it would be nice to ignore the remainder. However, that has never been the case because every legal vote counts. While all the lawyers may stall some things, it will be the U.S. Supreme Court that decides everything.\n\nOctober Poppy Hour\n\nWith wildfires blazing all around Southern California, the Theodore Payne Foundation’s (TPF) live-stream online class Poppy Hour: Wildfire this Thursday on October 29 is particularly timely. Acknowledging that wildfires are an inherent part of life in Southern California, TPF will feature two wildfire experts discussing fire ecology and actions that can be taken for wildfire resilience.\n\nDr. Jon Keeley is a fire ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and Henry Herrera is the CAL FIRE Regional Urban Forester for Los Angeles and Ventura County. Keeley is currently a research scientist with the USGS. Prior to this appointment he was a professor of biology at Occidental College for 20 years. His research has focused on the ecological impacts of wildfires. Herrera began his forestry career in the San Bernardino National Forest while attending Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. He has worked in several National Forests as a firefighter, forester, and lands/special uses officer. Herrera’s main experience is with fuels/vegetation management, prescribed fire, and reforestation.\n\nTPF Nursery Manager Flora Ito will open the show by sharing a few of her favorite fire- adapted plant selections. That presentation will be especially interesting insomuch as TPF is no stranger to wildfires. Three years ago the La Tuna Fire burned to the property line and the native plant landscape did what it was intended to do – it survived and grew back stronger.\n\nMy own firsthand experience of a similar marvelous rebirth occurred in 1978 after a devastating wildfire in Malibu. On the Kinney Estate, Roland had transplanted clumps of Watsonias for some 30 years on both sides of the west driveway. When the South African native plant became too invasive in formal gardens, he simply planted clumps and corms on the west side for years. In time, bushes and trees shaded everything and the Watsonias went to sleep waiting for a fire.\n\nWhen the fire hit, everything not only burned, it was totally vaporized by the intense heat. In the spring after winter rains, the Watsonias broke ground through the ash. Reaching skyward, the four-foot-high blooms of rose pink flowers, which were similar to Gladiolus but smaller with more numerous flowers per stem, were opulent. From Pacific Coast Highway to the bluff, the Watsonias did what they were intended to do.\n\nTo watch Poppy Hour: go to www.theodorepaynefoundat ion.org and then go to Online Classes & Events and click on Oct. 29: Poppy Hour: Wildfire.

Just last week when I was chagrined about the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) granting the Trump Administration’s request to halt the 2020 Census, I was elated soon afterwards when Supreme Court Justice John Roberts announced the high court would review Trump’s plan to exclude undocumented immigrants on November 30. There is something happening here that is not following the Presidential game plan.\n\nA few days later, Roberts discarded his conservative cloak and sided with liberal judges to deadlock the Court in a four-to-four vote and let stand a Pennsylvania court ruling permitting mail-in ballots, which arrive up to three days after November 3, to be counted. In legal parlance, when a vote is tied, the lower court decision prevails. That means that North Carolina and Wisconsin that also have extended mail-in ballot deadlines may also benefit from a potential deadlock.\n\nThere is nothing in the U.S. Constitution or the Rule of Law that mandates all ballots be counted on Election Day. They must be cast in person or postmarked on November 3. Any notion of President Trump that ballots received by the Registrar of Voters up to three days after Election Day are illegal, is simply a distorted game plan.\n\nThe Covid-19 Pandemic has changed the playing field with an unprecedented number of voters choosing to vote by mail. Recent compromises and manipulation of the U.S. Postal Service required clarification of what could be accomplished on Election Day. That doesn’t mean that a timely delay of up to three days has anything to do with the illegitimacy of the election.\n\nPerhaps that is why GOP Senators are so anxious to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to SCOTUS. With John Roberts being so unpredictable when it comes to defending the U.S. Constitution or the Rule of Law, it’s better to fill the vacancy quickly before hemorrhaging leads to convulsions. After all, in that infamous Rose Garden disclosure, Trump regarded Barrett as essential to resolving Election Day turmoil if he has to appeal the results to SCOTUS.\n\nIn times of civility, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were close friends in spite of the fact they represented two ideological opposites. They were opera fans, travel companions, and New Year’s Eve celebrants. The only thing they disagreed on, while regarding each other as “Absolutely Captivating,” was the Law.\n\nIn one of his famous quotes, Scalia disclosed, “I attack ideas. I don’t attack people. Some very good people have some very bad ideas.” For Election Day 2020, those words resonate for those who respect one another in spite of political differences.\n\nU.S. Census Denied\n\nIn yet another stunning example of lawmakers taking advantage of the Covid-19 Pandemic and natural disasters for political gain, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) on Tuesday, October 13, granted the Trump Administration’s request to halt the 2020 Census count effective on Thursday October 15. Although the high court decision merely shortens the final date of canvassing by just over two weeks, it is considered to be temporary while an array of lawsuits over a bigger issue are appealed to the SCOTUS. However, it appears unlikely the Census Bureau could shut down and then rehire canvassers for the door-knocking operation, which in the past two weeks added one million residents to the head count.\n\nThe far-reaching implication for such hasty action ensures that President Trump will receive the final tabulation before December 31 and in time to adjust the figures on how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed to states each year for the next ten years. In times of turmoil during the 230-year history of the U.S. Census Bureau, the date was moved from December until April of the following year. We will see if that occurs as other cases reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe bigger issue in spite of the U.S. Constitution mandate that “All citizens, non-citizen legal residents, non-citizen long-term visitors and undocumented residents be counted,” is that Trump has been attempting to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census tabulation. At stake, the primary purpose of the Census is to reapportion the House of Representatives seats based on population, and to reallocate Electoral College votes for the next ten years.\n\nThe case for counting every resident ensures adequate funding for infrastructure such as roads, schools and transportation planning, military, and disaster-response planning, economic analyses, as well as commercial investment and marketing decisions. Since 2018 after multiple states sued the Trump Administration over the citizenship issue and prevailed in the SCOTUS, Trump’s rationale has been rejected. However, on July 21, 2020, Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum ordering the exclusion of undocumented aliens from the numbers of the 2020 Census, which is being appealed to the high court.\n\nThe bottom line here is that undocumented residents are here in the United States because they aspire for a better life. They live here, work here, contribute to the economy, use our roads, attend our schools, and rely on hospital emergency rooms for health care. The political strategy of manipulating the population numbers to deny the House of Representatives its funding stream for vital services and infrastructure is disgusting and hateful.\n\nEvery citizen of the United States is either an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants, who embraced a new life and strengthened the fabric of America.\n\nFire Protection Costs?\n\nToday as I was driving west on Highway 138 between Beekley Road and the Los Angele County Line, I noticed many places on the North Slope foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in Pinon Hills burned over the years. When you add the massive scar of the failed 1980s subdivision at the south end of Mountain Road, there doesn’t seem to be that much vegetation left to burn.\n\nThat’s good to have the bare earth fire break in place for the remainder of my life. However, I don’t suppose anyone in the halls of government has considered exempting those land parcels that no longer have any potential to burn from fire prevention taxes and fees.\n\nOn September 13, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (HJTA) announced the Third District Court of Appeal upheld a lower court decision to dismiss their efforts pursuing refunds in the Cal Fire fire prevention fee case. Although HJTA was successful years ago to have the State Legislature and Governor suspend the fee, the case is now closed, and there will be no refunds. With that decision in place, Cal Fire will most likely reinstate the tax or fee or whatever you wish to call it on parcels of land with a structure.\n\nMeanwhile, in the past, San Bernardino County (SBC) pursued a much more ambitious plan to address the County Fire deficit. After voters had an opportunity to protest the creation of Fire Protection Service Zone FP-5 and a special tax on every land parcel developed or not, the small number of protest cards filed was absolutely pathetic.\n\nAnd so it was when property owners in the North Desert Zone woke up and realized they would have to pay $157.56 every year forever, it became apparent this indeed was a special tax. It’s a special tax because in one fell swoop, it handily addresses the questionable deficit and also becomes a runaway revenue generator for SBC. On the November 3ballot, “Measure U” gives property owners an opportunity to repeal the special tax associated with Fire Protection Service Zone 5.\n\nIt’s not that we don’t like firefighters or appreciate their heroic service, but there is a much larger issue here. As a result of climate change, wildfires in California have become more tenacious. The cost of fire services should be borne by all taxpayers because of everyone benefits. As fires burn faster and farther, property owners in one area cannot be expected to generate sufficient revenue to protect homes, vacant property, and recreational lands.\n\nTaxing every land parcel in rural areas of the North Desert, while perhaps appealing to county supervisors, can only stymie the real estate market and a greater revenue source from new development.\n\nTheodore Payne Foundation Struggles\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 Pandemic, the Theodore Payne Foundation (TPF) native plant nursery and education center in Sun Valley, California, has been faced with daunting challenges. Initially, with the nursery, book/gift store, and classrooms closed to the public, TPF launched an ambitious Internet format. When allowed to reopen partially, plants could be ordered by the Internet or telephone and retrieved in the parking lot. However, that just wasn’t the same as casually strolling through the nursery and purchasing much more than anticipated because everything was so special; as a result, sales plummeted.\n\nThe same situation occurred when the Spring Garden Tour became a virtual journey to spectacular native plant landscape designs of Southern California. Instead of walking through gardens and chatting with the property owners, the initial foray into Zoom was distracting with the wind’s sound and passing cars interfering with conversations. As ticket sales languished, viewers who were watching from home for free were asked to make tax-deductible donations to TPF.\n\nIn the spring, TPF launched a live show on the Internet about California native plants, which was broadcast every Thursday afternoon at 5:30 pm. The show called “Poppy Hour” featured native plant education speakers, visits to scenic locales, and virtual garden tours extending well beyond the foothills of Sun Valley. Season 2 Episode 1 premiered on September 24, and the series continues every Thursday on Zoom webinar and YouTube stream. Simply Google: Poppy Hour Theodore Payne Foundation to watch Episode 2, or enjoy all of the first season.\n\nAs for classes and events, TPF now offers an array of virtual activities listed at www.theodorepayne.everbright.com . And now with most in-person Covid-19 restrictions mitigated, TPF is offering “Sunday in the Garden” tours limited to 15 guests.\n\nAlthough the Theodore Payne nursery was scheduled to fully reopen on September 10, an unprecedented heatwave and, more recently, unhealthy air quality from wildfires prevented that. Sadly, with temperatures approaching 120 degrees in Sun Valley, a large portion of the plant inventory was lost. However, with herculean efforts, the inventory has been replaced, and the nursery is now fully open with all plants, books, seeds, clothing, and other merchandise available in the sales yard. Reservations per car are necessary at (818) 768-1802, and visitors must observe departure times. Additionally, face-covering is mandatory and safe distancing is essential.\n\nThroughout the struggle to maintain the legacy of Theodore Payne, many of the profitable ventures have faltered. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, your tax-deductible donation will help TPF survive for its 60th anniversary.\n\nThe Theodore Payne Foundation is located at 10459Tuxford Street in Sun Valley 91352. It is open Thursday through Saturday from 8:30 am until 4:30 pm.

That incident was followed 11 days later when Mississippi National Guardsmen fired 460 shots at students of Jackson State University where two were killed and 12 were wounded.\n\nAddressing the carnage, students at 450 American colleges went on strike and classes were cancelled for the spring semester. Marking an end to the age of innocence and the altruistic dreams of the ‘60s, the execution of protesters was more akin to Third World dictatorships than to American college campuses. The Neil Young song “Ohio,” written for the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young single, was first performed on June 4, 1970. Fifty years later, it remains a poignant anti-war song.\n\nSadly, the Vietnam War has come back into the news recently, with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic now claiming more lives than were lost in the Southeast Asian conflict. As with the Nixon Administration and our modern day “Wartime President,” conflicting reports, distractions, and political leverage are just as apt to occur today as they were then.\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic is an insidious enemy that knows no borders. There are no troops marching into battle, nor Napalm explosions incinerating the horizon. As we have experienced, COVID-19 travels everywhere, surges and retreats, and might have many curtain calls. While there appears to be a pause in the action, that can only be verified with truthful statistical testing. So here we are months after President Trump promised testing for every American, and there remains a shortage of test kits that perform accurately, as well as laboratories that can produce speedy results. Modifying shelter at home and safe-distance protocols without scientific proof that COVID-19 is receding is not acceptable.\n\nMeanwhile, while states compete with the federal government to acquire test kits and protective clothing, our wartime president has been accused of being preferential to those states that truly appreciate him. However, let’s be candid here. America First isolationism might have some traction here, but it is a nonsequitur abroad. On May 4 at a pledging conference to fund test kits, protective clothing, and to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine for COVID-19, the European Union, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Norway and Spain, raised $8 billion. With $1.25 billion given to the World Health Organization (WHO) for vulnerable nations, that amount vastly surpasses what Trump took away from the WHO.\n\nAfter being hard hit and rebounding, the European nations are not resting on their laurels or murmuring, “You like me!” Instead, they are preparing for Act II of a continuing siege.\n\nWritten April 22,2020\n\nUnited At Home\n\nLast Saturday, in the parlance that politics or religion should not be the topic of conversation at family gatherings, more than 100 musicians and vocalists in their homes entertained 20.7 million viewers of the One World Together At Home live stream broadcast, without crossing that line. After all, the concert was intended to pay tribute to frontline workers battling the COVID-19 pandemic and to celebrate their heroic bravery through the universal language of music. The event, presented by Global Citizen (GS), generated $127.9 million in donations pledged before the broadcast from 68 worldwide corporate sponsors.\n\nAfter Lady Gaga announced the two-hour broadcast special on April 6, the list of guest performers who wanted to participate swelled from 24 to more than 100. The solution to the conundrum was to schedule a six-hour segment featuring international acts with videos of world citizens cheering healthcare workers every night at 7:00 p.m. from their balconies as they sheltered at home. Following that telecast, the original cast of superstar U.S. and U.K performers was aired for two hours hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, and Jimmy Fallon. From Lady Gaga, her testimony was, “This is really a true love letter to all of you, all over the world.”\n\nHighlights from the first segment included Hozier and Maren Morris singing her country song “The Bones.” Following up, Rita Ora sang “Lonely Together” with multi-screen visuals of healthcare workers and elderly patients waving to their relatives. Continuing in that emotion, Hussain Al Jassmi sang “I Miss You” in Arabic with English subtitles for the lyrics. Keysha then sang her powerful anthem “Rainbow” with children from around the world holding up images of what has become the logo of hope in the fight against the pandemic. Danai Gurira then made a compassionate plea stressing that patients needed proper care and healthcare workers needed essential supplies. Delta Goodrem from Australia then followed up with a stunning rendition of “Together We Are One.”\n\nOpening up the second portion of the broadcast, Lady Gaga continued with her effort to make the event fun and engaging for everyone by singing the Nat King Cole rendition of the song “Smile.” Playing a bluesy piano, she accelerated at times into a Broadway musical tempo. Following up in that tone was Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Kasey Musgraves, and Elton John. For one of the most imaginative performances, Jimmy Fallon & The Roots filled the screen with a montage of 11 images for the song “Safety Dance.”\n\nGetting back to inspirational songs, Camila Cabeello & Shawn Mendes performed “It’s A Wonderful World,” Lizzo delivered a riveting performance of “A Change Is Gonna Come,” and Jennifer Lopez channeled Barbara Streisand for “People.” Most poignant for those sheltering at home was the Rolling Stones “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.”\n\nLater on, appearing on split screen were Laura Bush and Michelle Obama. Bush commented, “We stand with the people of the world”. Obama followed remarking, “We will get through this crisis together.” Continuing, Billie Elish & Finneas performed a soulful “Sunny” followed by Taylor Swift singing “Soon You’ll Get Better.” Another dynamic performance followed with Jennifer Hudson stunning everyone with “Hallelujah.” A very special finale included Andrea Bocelli, John Legend, Celine Dion, and Lady Gaga singing “The Prayer” with Lang Lang on piano.\n\nThe concert raised $55.1 million for the World Health Organization, and $72.8 million for 46 organizations funded by Global Citizen.\n\nWritten April 15, 2020\n\nSheltering With Music\n\nAlthough sheltering at home to prevent spreading of the Coronavirus has not been difficult because I generally spend a great deal of my time there anyways, there have nevertheless been some exasperating situations. After continuous rainfall with my landline telephone service out of order for nine days and my cell phone breaking up and dropping calls, I was beginning to feel isolated. Thankfully, the Internet remained viable and www.pastemagazine.com provided me with an array of music and film selections.\n\nScrolling through The 50 Best Movies on YouTube (Free and Paid), I came upon three documentary films with each crediting a specific locale as the birthplace of new music genres. From Muscle Shoals Alabama to Hollywood and Van Nuys, California, more than 500 Top 40 singles and albums were recorded during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nRick Hall, who was white, grew up in poverty in Muscle Shoals hearing black laborers singing in the fields as they picked cotton. Aspiring to be something special in life, the producer/songwriter/musician/ remembered those melodies and rhythms when he opened Fame Recording Studio. Forming a house band called “The Swampers,” the multiracial cast of musicians created a sound unique to Muscle Shoals with roots connected to gospel, blues, jazz, R&B, and country music. Arthur Alexander’s song “You Better Move On,” which was the first gold record, was later covered by the Rolling Stones. After that, Aretha Franklin, Percy Sledge, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, Etta James, Duane Allman, Tim McGraw, Kenny Chesney, and many more recorded at Fame. Google: Muscle Shoals-YouTube.\n\nIn narrating The Wrecking Crew documentary, Dick Clark mentioned the name came about because the core house band of producer Phil Spector, “didn’t wear suits and ties to sessions, embraced rock and roll music, and were going to wreck the music industry as ghost players without receiving credits on hundreds of hit songs.” All being accomplished musicians with classical and jazz backgrounds, they were masters at improvising. Glen Campbell and Leon Russell emerged from The Wrecking Crew to become superstars. As ghost players, because session time was highly in demand and expensive, Wrecking Crew musicians actually created musical scores for The Monkees, The Beach Boys, and The Byrds, and then taught the youngsters how to play the song when it became a hit. Others included Jan and Dean, Sonny & Cher, and The Mamas and the Papas. Google: The Wrecking Crew-YouTube.\n\nIn 1969 after Tom Skeeter and Joe Gottfried purchased a state-of-the-art recording console for $75,000 from British electronics engineer Rupert Neve, Sound City Studio became famous for a distinct sound produced by the Neve Electronic 8028. The drums popped like nowhere else. Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, and countless others liked that sound. Google: Sound City-YouTube.\n\nWritten April 8, 2020\n\nOne World Together At Home Concert\n\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide on this planet who will need apolitical financial assistance in order to survive. Collectively, the profession of being a Rock Star generates the magnitude of wealth necessary to fund such a recovery. On Saturday April 18, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Global Citizen (GC) present 25 musicians and performers who have come together to support and celebrate healthcare workers fighting the COVID-19 Pandemic, for what could be the most widely broadcast concert in history.\n\nThe epic world TV special will be produced by WHO and GC and curated in cooperation with Lady Gaga. The global broadcast will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Stephen Colbert, and the cast of Sesame Street. Featured performers include: Lady Gaga, Alanis Morissette, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day, Burna Boy, Chris Martin, David Beckham, Eddie Vedder, Elton John, Finneas, Idris &Sabrina Elba, J.

At the same time, our attention is riveted on the health hazard. Key players entering the stage of international chaos are the United States/Iran, Russia/Saudi, the United States/Venezuela, and Hungary. Interestingly enough, after a telephone conversation between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, Russia airlifted 60 tons of ventilators, masks, protective clothing, and respirators to New York City.\n\nContinuing a week of political distractions, when the only topic that really matters is the worldwide pandemic, world financial markets already hammered by the heath crisis plummeted lower with the Russia/Saudi Arabia wild oil production war. The price per barrel declined to $20.00 decimating the U.S. fracking business. While that was bad for American oil industries, it did not bode well for Venezuelan oil exports. However, the government of President Nicolas Maduro supported by Russia, China, and Cuba, remained in power despite the U.S. Courts’ indictment for smuggling drugs. A point in case, if a sitting U.S. President cannot legally be indicted, what makes the White House think it can indict another president.\n\nFollowing up that action, President Donald Trump believes that Maduro would take advantage of the COVID-19 situation to smuggle more drugs, doubled the U.S. military forces in the Caribbean. Trump offered to begin easing economic sanctions against Venezuela if Maduro formed a coalition government that was not socialistic and did not include him.\n\nFurther saber-rattling of the week occurred on Wednesday when Trump accused Iran and its proxies of planning an attack on U.S. forces in Iraq. If that was to happen, Reuters News reports, Trump warned, “They will pay a hefty price” without disclosing any details.\n\nOn the very same day that Putin pulled off a dynamic public relations coup with the airlift to New York City, Trump could have been equally magnanimous in offering to cease economic sanctions against Iran, in order to expedite shipment of medical supplies to that nation, hard hit by the pandemic. That might have been what Putin was hoping for as an ally of Iran. However, with the White House lacking in diplomacy skills, that opportunity was fumbled.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hungary, the government of President Victor Orban citing concerns for the COVID-19 Pandemic, declared a state of emergency, giving him the right to rule by decree. With no time limit on the additional powers, democracy and freedom of the press were sidetracked, outraging the European Union.\n\nWith the entire world tragically affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic, this should not be an opportunity for grandstanding or regime change. It should be a time when all world powers unite for one cause-to save lives.\n\nWritten March 25, 2020\n\nDoctor, Doctor\n\nNow that there are knowledgeable adults in the room at the side of President Donald Trump in the form of Doctor Anthony Fauci and Doctor Deborah Birx, it appears that Trump is growing frustrated with their candid assessments of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While we as a nation have only weathered through the first week of practicing social distancing, sheltering at home, and self-quarantine for those testing positive, the number of those complying with Presidential directives is being eclipsed by new cases in the second week.\n\nDuring a live townhall broadcast on the Fox News Channel this week, Trump said he would like to have businesses open their doors again by Easter on April 12. His exact words were, “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.” Trump disclosed he was not happy about his public health expert’s recommendation, but he reluctantly accepted two weeks of restrictions because, “We would have been unbelievably criticized for not doing it.”\n\nFollowing up today, as has been the case for many of Trump’s press conferences, Doctor Fauci and Doctor Birx were less optimistic. They explained that Trump’s Easter proposal needed to be addressed with flexibility, depending on what kind of data was available now and what data would be soon be available. As Doctor Fauci commented, “This is a big country. There are areas we need to know more about before we ease restrictions.”\n\nIn viewing a map of the Unites States provided by Reuters News, there are states with a minimal number of COVID-19 infections and no deaths. West Virginia has 20 reported cases, Wyoming has 28 cases, and South Dakota has 30. While those states have a decent chance to curtail the pandemic, they certainly are not major contributors to the national economy that Trump hopes will return to work as soon as possible to prevent financial collapse.\n\nMost people like to work and few like to be confined to their homes for what could be weeks. Doctor Fauci has disclosed that lockdowns in China were successful because it is an authoritarian country. There was no discussion with the population when draconian measures were the only option to prevent complete decimation of the national workforce.\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic is neither a hoax nor a deep state conspiracy. It is something that has never been experienced in the United States since the 1918 Influenza Pandemic killed 675,000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide. There will be no returning to normal by Easter. This is not like the wildfire will crest the mountain in hours, or the hurricane will make landfall next week. Nobody knows how to stop COVID-19 until a vaccine can be produced.\n\nWritten March 18, 2020\n\nWhat To Do\n\nWith most activities and events cancelled as health precautions for the Coronavirus (COVID-19), my first reaction to the “Shelter in Place” declaration made by President Donald Trump was “What am I going to do?” As a journalist here in the Tri-Community, a great amount of my time is spent attending public meetings and events where I scribble copious notes and shoot photographs of the activities. Later on at the home computer, I spend hours researching additional material, editing photographs, and writing articles.\n\nFor each feature article of 500 words, I spend approximately six hours from start to finish. In addition to that time spent, preparing clothes and commuting to events, are activities for each assignment. As a teenager attending Catholic military school, I fell into the life-long habit of ironing a shirt and trousers every morning before heading out the door. And while I have since abandoned the military creases on the shirt, the mindless task of ironing clears my mind for each day’s new adventure.\n\nUnder the present circumstances with nothing to do and nowhere to go, I am particularly at a loss. What comes to mind first are the lyrics of George Harrison’ song “While My Guitar Gently Weeps”… “I look at the floor, and see it needs sweeping”. There will be spring housecleaning like never before. With my accelerated lifestyle grinding to a halt, the former procrastination mantra of, “I can’t do that until I do this,” is totally irrelevant.\n\nSecondly, my workshop needs cleaning and organizing. After constructing it, the space never quite transitioned into being an art studio. So now is the time to crank up the heat and the music and enjoy being productive. With the insidious COVID-19 secretly wafting around, I can use that threat as a stimulus to stay home surrounded by the safe environment I have created.\n\nHowever, until the weather here in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains becomes warmer to work outdoors in the garden, a journey to view Southern California native plant gardens already in bloom has been cancelled. Instead, the Theodore Payne Foundation (TPF) 2020 Garden Tour will be conducted online rather than in-person. On Saturday, March 28, and Sunday, March 29, from 10:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., a virtual journey through Southern California native plant gardens can be experienced for those who have WhatsApp Smartphone features or Skype video feed capabilities.\n\nOn those days, there will be a live stream opportunity to meet and interact with garden owners, designers, and TPF staff. There will be 42 residential native plant gardens featured in the Westside, Mid-City, South Bay, San Gabriel Valley and San Fernando Valley virtual guided tours. Go to http://www.nativeplantgardentour.org for information and a prelude.\n\nWritten Mach 11, 2020\n\nUpcoming Benefit Concert\n\nCenterStage Productions, Southern California musicians, Wrightwood merchants, and the community-at-large have united to present a concert to benefit A Better Way - the Victor Valley Domestic Violence Shelter, on Sunday, March 15, at 3:00 p.m. in the Wrightwood Community Building. Entitled “One Vision Many Voices,” the event will let community voices be heard against domestic violence.\n\nFeatured musicians include Gayle & Company consisting of Gayle Dowling, Adam Webster, Brittan Egnozzi, Danny Flores, and Lynn Davison. Laurie Hedland, formerly of the all-girl band Vixen, will join Susette Andres and Alex Peterson, formerly of the all-female band Precious Metal and current members of the Wild Side Band. Singer/songwriter Kelly Zirbes with her band Kelly’s Lot will deliver a performance anchored in the Blues.\n\nJust to burnish the luster of these musicians, Dowling is a pioneer folk singer/songwriter in the Wrightwood Village who recorded several albums over the years. She is responsible for meeting and bringing to the local music scene Fred Stuart -the master builder for the Fender Guitar Custom Founders Design Shop - best known hereabouts for his twangy pedal steel music. Lynn Davison, on keyboards and vocals, has performed with renowned jazz bassist Marshall Hawkins. Her original music has been featured on TV and in films.\n\nAfter Susette Andres and Alex Peterson achieved fame in the 80s as Capital/Polygram recording artists with Precious Metal, they reunited in 2015 and most recently have opened for Berlin, Missing Person, and Vixen. Kelly Zirbes debuted on the stage of the Roxy in Hollywood 25 years ago. Her first album “Live at the Troubadour” was then followed with 14 CDs recorded since then. Achieving a unique niche with her songwriting and concert touring in the United States and Europe, her songs have been heard in movies and television.\n\nIn addition to an allstar cast of musicians for the concert on Sunday, virtually every storefront and home business in Wrightwood has donated Silent Auction items. At this time more than 30 items include car detailing and service, Mountain High tickets, Zipline at Pacific Crest tickets, a Grand Pines Motel stay, clothing, ceramics, beauty products, spa sessions, wines, gift certificates, and many other unique items. There will also be light hors d’oeuvres and beverages available for purchase, and a 50/50 raffle with all proceeds to benefit A Better Way.\n\nDuring the event, Inger Robertson, Executive Director of A Better Way, will speak on how the campus instills the values of Empathy, Education and Empowerment, while transforming lives affected by domestic violence. Event day donations of new twin-size sheets or comforters will be graciously accepted.\n\nTickets for One Vision Many Voices are $15 online at www.abetterwaybenefit.com or $20 at the door. The concert begins at 3:00 p.m. with doors opening at 2:30.\n\nWritten March 4, 2020\n\nSpring Ahead\n\nThis Sunday, March 8, Daylight Saving Time begins and we steadily progress towards the Vernal Equinox first day of spring on March 19. And although there will probably be additional rain and snow, my rosemary bushes have started to bloom and I spotted the first blush of California poppies in Santa Clarita last weekend. I listen to Tom Waits: “Spring ahead or fall behind, you can never hold back spring.”\n\nThank you, Tom for the bluesy serenade, which always gets me anxious to open up the windows so I can hear the music outdoors as I work in the garden. A bit premature, perhaps, but I can still plan springtime activities and excursions for warmer days and longer sunshine.\n\nOne thing for certain on my list is checking in with the Theodore Payne Foundation (TPF) Wild Flower Hotline each week. For 37 years it has had free weekly recorded and online updates posted every Friday from March through May. It lists the best locations to view spring wildflowers in Southern and Central California, with all sites easily accessible on public lands. Call (818) 768-1802 Ext. 7 or go to www.theodorepayne.org/learn/wildflower-hotline for a PDF format of locations with vivid photographs.\n\nAnother way to enjoy the passion of the preeminent horticulturist of California native plants is to plan a day trip from the High Desert to the TPF located at 10459 Tuxford Street in Sun Valley, California 91350. The most scenic route in the springtime when wildflowers are in bloom is to drive east on Angeles Forest Highway from the 14 Freeway near Acton, traveling over the San Gabriel Mountains to Big Tujunga Road, continuing to Sunland Boulevard and then to Tuxford.\n\nOnce there, the 22-acre grounds feature a retail nursery, Wildflower Hill hiking trail, a native plant demonstration garden, a fire management demonstration garden, gift shop/ seed store, art gallery, and a nature education center for classes and workshops. If all this seems a bit fatiguing, bring a picnic basket and enjoy lunch on tables positioned under ancient oak and sycamore trees.\n\nI usually spend as much time in the gift shop and art gallery as I do in the nursery. In addition to books and unique cards and stationary, there are gardening tools, clothing, and hats. In the gallery each year, a chosen Artist-in-Residence creates a body of work inspired by nature with an exhibit scheduled from September through December. During their residency, each artist also teaches one or more art classes.\n\nTPF also sponsors an adult education program for native plant horticulture, and annual garden tours. The Theodore Payne Foundation is open Tuesday through Saturday from 8:30 am until 4:30 pm.\n\nWritten February 26, 2010\n\nMisunderstanding Socialism\n\nAs a wordsmith, I’m always verifying the correct meaning of words and terms. During the 2020 Presidential campaign, the meaning of the term “Socialism” has already become convoluted. With Bernie Sanders proclaiming to be a Democratic Socialist, he has coined a new phrase that combines Democracy with Socialism. That is the first misunderstanding, because as an Independent he is not a member of the Democratic Party, and he is not a Communist as political ads insinuate.\n\nThe United States as the innovator of the free-market economy has rolled merrily along in times of prosperity. However, when bumps in the road were encountered such as the Great Depression or the Great Recession, it was not the stock brokers or hedge funders that threw a lifeline to the disadvantaged, it was the U.S. Government stepping in to initiate social programs.\n\nFrom a recent article in The New Yorker magazine entitled, “The Many, Tangled American Definitions Of Socialism,” author Peter Slevin interviewed historian, John Gurda, who reported on the evolution of Socialism in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and beyond. It’s peculiar that the 2020 Democratic National Convention will be held in Milwaukee, which embraced social programs long before Bernie Sanders. That city had three socialistic mayors between 1915 and 1960 and constructed the first municipally-sponsored public housing project in the nation.\n\nIn 1935 following the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt created the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through an Executive Order. Providing jobs for millions, public parks, public libraries, public ports, public schools, public housing, and roadways amounting to 6.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, were indeed all socialistic-sponsored public infrastructure.\n\nDuring Cold War red baiting in 1952, President Harry Truman defended socialism in declaring, “Socialism is what they called Social Security. Socialism is what they called farm-price supports. Socialism is what they called bank-deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called free and independent labor. Socialism is their name for almost everything that helps all of the people.”\n\nFor decades, Americans have defined socialism in terms of the Cold War red baiting, equating the term with state control of the economy and, more often than not, authoritarian rule. A Gallup survey released last May indicated 51 percent of Americans believe socialism would be a bad thing, while 43 percent considered it to be a good thing. I can only assume that majority believes falsehoods spread on social media.\n\nWhen traveling through older sections of large cities, picturesque bridges and historic buildings should remind disbelievers of the WPA era. The 1935 Social Security Act – also initiated by Roosevelt – ensured retirement funds for elderly middle-class and lower-class citizens. It also provided unemployment insurance for all workers. Social programs are the backbone of America, not to be misunderstood.\n\nWritten February 19, 2020\n\nPiñon Hills Chamber\n\nThe Piñon Hills Chamber of Commerce held its monthly meeting on February 18. The guest speaker was local artist, Bill Elmore, who displayed and provided narratives for his original paintings of historic structures and landmarks in the Tri-Community. Several years ago Elmore created the Chamber logo, which incorporated the slogan coined by Sandy Young, “Where the Desert Meets the Mountains.” Elmore’s visual interpretation included a roadway heading south toward snowcapped mountains passing by a piñon pine tree.\n\nPresident Lori Weston introduced Secretary Ed Greany who submitted two fundraising proposals to be included in 2020 Summerfest. The first item was to purchase a Cricut Explore One electronic die-cutting machine, which laser engraves identification tags for dog collars, backpacks, or travel bags. Using stainless steel blanks similar to military “dog tags” or more specifically a dog bone image, visitors to Summerfest can specify the information and purchase a tag for $5. The second proposal was to purchase Tee shirts with a Joshua tree emblem design. Both items were approved by the membership and can be purchased on June 6.\n\nDirector James Conkle reported Piñon Hills Elementary School students during International Kindness Week. Conkle that six adults were involved in single and tandem sessions and that students were very receptive to the visitors helping them read. A consensus agreed they would like to continue the program if Principal Shannon Avery could arrange it.\n\n2020 Summerfest for Saturday, June 6, 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the Piñon Hills Elementary School field. The booth fee for a 10 x 10 space is $25 with setup for vendors on Friday, June 5. In addition to live music, rides, arts & crafts, and a car show, there will also be mobile pet adoptions provided by Victor Valley Animal Protection. Additionally the Chamber booth will also be selling license plate frames. For more details, call the Summerfest committee at 760-868-7191.\n\nThe 2nd Annual Piñon Hills Art Exhibit has been scheduled for Saturday, August 8, with a reception for the artists to be held on Friday night, August 7.\n\nClosing the meeting with announcements, Chamber Vice President Scott Brown and President of High Desert Keepers announced Operation Avenal on Saturday, February 22, and Sunday, February 23, from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Having already removed 199 tons of trash from the greater area, Brown is hopeful the community cleanup on Avenal Road near the Sheep Creek Transfer Station will surpass 200 tons.\n\nThe Piñon Hills Chamber of Commerce meets the third Tuesday of every month at 6:00 p.m. at 10405 Mountain Road.\n\nWritten February 13, 2020\n\nHistoric Building Leased\n\nTwo of the most famous names in news journalism have become partners in Downtown Los Angeles as landlord and tenant of the historic Herald Examiner Building, located on Broadway at 11th Street. Boarded up since 1989 when the newspaper ceased operations, the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival building was constructed by William Randolph Hearst in 1914 after being designed by Julia Morgan, later to be the architect of Hearst Castle. According to the Hearst Corporation and two real estate development companies, Arizona State University (ASU) will become the tenant creating a Los Angeles campus for the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.\n\nWith a $52.4 million renovation currently underway, the L.A. Downtown News reported on February 10 that the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has donated $2.5 million towards structural rehabilitation of the building. Although ASU has had a filmmaking satellite in Santa Monica for five years called Film Spark, leasing the entire five-story 80,000-square-foot Herald Examiner Building represents an ambitious move into the journalism, communication, and technology education fields of Southern California, competing with USC, UCLA and Caltech.\n\nIn addition to 1,200 students occupying the building for the Cronkite School, ASU L.A. will also house students of the Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. That school recently launched a partnership with LACMA to create a training program for curators, directors and other museum professionals.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the building will also contain a restaurant and a café positioned between tall arches with sidewalk seating, and perhaps a grocery store facing into the ornate lobby, resplendent with carved wood panels, hand-painted floor tiles, hammered iron grills, and plenty of marble. Formerly anchoring a desolate neighborhood of parking lots, the west side of the Herald Examiner Building is now just across a landscaped alleyway from a new seven-story apartment building.\n\nHowever, just across Broadway and down the block, the 13-story former Case Hotel built in the 1920s is being transformed with a $50 million makeover into the Downtown L.A. Proper Hotel. While nearby, another 1920s 10-story Renaissance Revival-style office building will become the Hoxton Hotel. Nevertheless, the relative low rise combination of old and new in the neighborhood will experience a hiccup when the 15-story Hyatt Centric with a rooftop bar and swimming pool is completed directly across the street.\n\nOften called an architectural jewel box, the crowning glory of the Herald Examiner Building was the penthouse apartment of William Randolph Hearst. In the age of wealth and opulence, that pied-á-terre was always available for Hearst, should he drop by the newspaper office. In time, a toast to architectural preservation from a fifth-floor room at the Hyatt seems appropriate.\n\nWritten February 6, 2020\n\nPaper Ballots For All\n\nIn spite of all the recent issues concerning cyber security for the Internet, the Iowa State Democratic Party took the tried-and-true method of voting by paper ballots with manual tabulation, and then decided to speed up the process using a new untried Smartphone app. Would you trust a secretive for-profit technology firm named Shadow Inc. that is owned by the digital non-profit organization ACRONYM, which is funded by a political action committee named PACRONYM? By the way, my finger did not get stuck on the Caps Lock. That is the way they spell it.\n\nWhile this certainly seems like a bunch of high school dudes sitting around puffing on reefers and thinking up goofy names, it’s not. Many of Shadow’s employees are former Hillary Clinton staff members from her failed presidential effort. Other team members include disgruntled Facebook refugees. And while the dust clears, Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden are attempting to distance themselves claiming they only use Shadow text- messaging services.\n\nIf this is the direction the first presidential contest of 2020 has taken, the perils of incorporating new and untested technologies into the voting process do not bode well for a smooth ride. In Iowa on Monday, precinct chairs tried to use the app to report the results from their caucus to the state party. However, they encountered trouble downloading the app on Smartphone or uploading data. After that, the Democratic Party’s backup telephone was overwhelmed with calls. Coding errors in the hastily programmed and secretive app have been blamed for the breakdown.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, Gregory Miller, cofounder of the Palo Alto-based Open Source Election Technology Institute, called the app, “An inexcusable act of amateurism,” and said, “It should prompt election officials elsewhere around the country to think twice about unnecessarily upgrading tried-and-true paper ballots.”\n\nMeanwhile, David Jefferson, a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who has advised the National Democratic Party, reported to the San Jose Mercury News, “You should not deploy a system that hasn’t gone through rigorous and scaled testing, and you should not deploy a system whose architecture and technical details are secret.”\n\nContinuing, David Sirota, speechwriter for Bernie Sanders, commented, “Maybe it’s not always a good idea to outsource, privatize, and corporatize the most basic voting services in a democracy.” Along similar lines Common Dreams reported, “A party that has spent the last three years talking about data hacking, took a manual process and shifted it to one of the most hackable devices-a cell phone.\n\nIn Iowa, everyone was certain that texting the results of paper ballots via the new app would speed up tabulation. However, the old method would have been faster.\n\nWritten Januaary 29, 2020\n\nStewart Sisters Roundup Saga\n\nBack in the 70s, as I was driving up the frontage road on the land side of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, my attention was riveted on two precious Old Maids known locally as the Stewart Sisters. With Georgina clutching one handle of a push lawnmower and Helen grasping the other handle, they were mowing the small lawn in front of their cottage overlooking Trancas Beach. Dressed in long aprons and straw hats, their apparent vitality was nonetheless betrayed by the sight of Ace bandages wrapped around feeble legs.\n\nI stopped, introduced myself and then asked if they needed help. Much to my surprise, the response was polite yet firm and had probably been murmured to other gardeners who offered assistance, “We’re doing just fine young man.” With that I handed them my business card, wished them a pleasant afternoon and said, “Call me if you change your mind.”\n\nSometime later I received a call from Helen, tasking me with mowing the field surrounding their home and clipping around the rock border. The rocks being the size of large watermelons adequately prevented anyone from driving across their property. Mowing the field was a cinch with my industrial grade rotary mower, however clipping around the rocks was a challenge. As I was told by the Stewart Sisters, as they handed me a pair of Corona hand grass shears, “The only proper way to clip around the rocks is to get down on your hands and knees and use these.”\n\nI did that once after mowing, and although the results were visually stunning I convinced myself that I would not be doing that again. As the sun set I secretly sprayed Roundup around all the rocks and went home. The following day Helen called me and asked, “Michael, can you come down and remove the dead blackbirds from the field?” That was a painful lesson to learn and I never used Roundup again.\n\nFortunately, in recent times the health and environmental hazards of the glyphosate-based weedkiller have led to alternative methods. A BBC News article entitled, “Zap! How microwaves and electricity are killing weeds,” cited several new advancements. The Foamstream machine, which looks like a carpet shampooer, uses hot water and biodegradable foam made from plant oils and sugars to steam cook weeds. Another option, the XPower system attached to a tractor, pulses electricity through weeds destroying the vascular system. Meanwhile, the Growave system emits microwaves that heat up water molecules rupturing cell walls in plants. It can be used when it rains, when it is windy or even at night.\n\nAlthough these new advancements will not totally eliminate the use of Roundup, they do create a safer environment for humans and wildlife.\n\nWritten January 22, 2020\n\nWrightwood Blues Society Fundraiser\n\nThe Wrightwood Blues Society (WBS) and CenterStage Productions will be hosting a fundraising event at the Wrightwood Community Building on Saturday February 15. Take a step back in time and enjoy “The Not-So-Newlywed Game” as four couples from Wrightwood are guided through an adult themed evening of bawdy and embarrassing questions hosted by celebrity TV actor Conor O’Farrell as Master of Ceremonies.\n\nWhile a parody of the popular 1970s game show, the couples will nonetheless be asked a series of revealing questions to determine how well they know or don’t know each other. There will be plenty of fun questions for couples who have been married for some time. In addition to the winning couple receiving a cash prize for their favorite charity, audience members will enjoy an evening of dinner, live music, and the zany antics of the host and contestants.\n\nThe event launches the WBS 2020 membership drive and is also a continuation of the $1,000 music scholarship fundraising drive. As a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization, the goal of WBS is to promote charitable, educational and musical activities honoring the American tradition of Blues, Jazz, and Gospel music and related genres.\n\nIt was a great honor for the Wrightwood Village to be blessed with presence of legendary Blues guitarist Terry “Big T” DeRouen. Big T was an inspiration to local musicians and definitely the impetus for the formation of the WBS, and his memory lives on in the form of the WBS $1,000 music scholarship named for him. The winner was selected from a younger generation of talented performers. This year, the preliminary auditions of Wrightwood’s Got Talent have been scheduled for May 10, in the Community Building. Following up on May 30, WBS and CenterStage present the Buddy Holly Show, also in the Community Building.\n\nIn August of 2019, the WBS also created the Wrightwood Creative Community Wall of Fame, with Lora Steinmann and John Burcher being the first two inductees. Inaugurally recognizing Steinmann for her 50+ years as Director of Snowline Players, and Burcher for decades of presenting multi-genre musical events in the Village, two creative luminaries will be inducted each year.\n\nPlan now to attend The Not-So-Newlywed Game on February 15; doors open at 5:30 p.m. and the show begins at 6:00 p.m. General public admission includes dinner and dessert for $30. Admission for WBS members is $20, while admission for Gold & Lifetime WBS members is $10.

This year, with the emphasis being focused on articulate young performers, my pick of Maggie Rogers - age 25, for Best New Artist might be eclipsed by teenage heartthrob Billie Eilish - age 18.\n\nRogers was discovered by Pharrell Williams, while earning a degree in music engineering and production at New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. Her songwriting skills and choreographed vocal deliveries are inspired by Patti Smith, propelling her into nuances of a chanteuse.\n\nBillie Eilish and her brother Finneas collaborate on everything from songwriting to impeccably produced musical scores. Their 2019 album entitled When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. Collectively, they have been nominated for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Pop Solo, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Engineered Album, and Producer of the Year. Their newest project is writing and performing the theme song for the 25th James Bond film, No Time To Die.\n\nMy current favorite singer/songwriter, Brandi Carlile, who was awarded three Grammys last year, is again all over the place this year. Carlile and Maren Morris have been nominated for Best Country Duo with the song “Common.” Nominated for Best Country Song, Carlile and the twins, Phil and Tim, co-wrote “Bring My Flowers Now” with Tanya Tucker. Also nominated for Best Country Album, While I’m Livin’ features Best Country Solo Performance for Tucker singing, “Bring My Flowers Now.” That song has also been nominated Best Song of the Year, crossing over musical genres.\n\nMeanwhile, across the pond, a brilliant singer/songwriter is poised to create a musical landslide for the 2021 Grammy Awards. Celeste Waite, who performs as “Celeste,” blends British soul music and jazz- tinged blues with subtle R&B melodies. Born in Culver City California to a British mother and Jamaican father, Celeste has lived in Great Brittan since the age of three.\n\nShe wrote her first song at the age of 16, which attracted the attention of a manager who booked studio sessions for her. She made her radio debut in 2017 when her song “Daydreaming” was added to the BBC playlist. In late 2019, Celeste won one Brit Award and one BBC Music Award. After hearing “Both Sides Of The Moon” on BBC Radio 1, Elton John commented, Celeste is quite something…watch out for her.” Celeste’s first tour and debut album are scheduled for April. With crisp and smooth vocals, she is as timeless as Billie Holliday.\n\nWritten January 10, 2020\n\nCultural Heritage\n\nThe reckless decision by President Donald Trump to assassinate Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, has not only endangered the lives of American military and diplomatic personnel in Iraq, but has also impacted the security of American Allies. In the past, both Democrat and Republican Administrations refused to take out Soleimani with the fear that collateral damage would be more severe. That factor came into play last week when Iraqi Militia Commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed in the Bagdad attack and the Iraqi Parliament voted to expel United States troops from the country. Prior to that time, there had been no proven direct conventional hostilities underway between the United States and Iran.\n\nFollowing the attack, Trump threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites “Very Hard” including cultural sites, if Iran were to retaliate. At the same time, the U.S. Pentagon sent a note to Tehran through the Swiss Embassy, which acts as an intermediately between the two foes, calling for a proportional response to the killing of Soleimani. According to The Guardian, the verbatim message was, “If you want to take revenge, do it in a way that’s proportional to what we did.”\n\nIn 2001, the world was appalled with the destruction of the 6th Century monumental Buddhas of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan by the Taliban. The Taliban government considered the 115 to 174-foot-tall sandstone sculptures to be sacrilegious idols and demolished them with dynamite. For Trump to even suggest including Iranian cultural sites, of which 22 are UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Sites, in his war plans, displays his lack of respect for historical treasures.\n\nAdditionally, such action violating the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, is a war crime. The same holds true for the 1972 United States and Iran Convention signed to prevent deliberate measures which might damage cultural and natural heritage sites. Fortunately, the Pentagon stepped in and ruled out striking Iranian cultural sites.\n\nHowever, that decision was made after anthropologists worldwide decried Trump’s threat, noting that the public spaces link Iranians to their past. Iranian citizens have a deep respect and affection for their historical places. Destroying cultural heritage sites would tear out their hearts.\n\nFor the United States being a young nation of just 10 UNESCO World Heritage sites, it is not morally justified for the president to fly by the seat of his pants with no clear strategy as to the proper direction of military force. The Middle East and The Holy Land represent the foundations of all the world’s religions, and they have been fighting each other for centuries. This time around, the United States should resist getting involved in such a quagmire.\n\nWritten January 3, 2020\n\nThank You Wrightwood\n\nI was quite surprised when Greg Jones, President of the Wrightwood Blues Society (WBS), invited me onstage during the recent Christmas Variety Show. Earlier in the concert, as Claudia Campbell sang “Blue Christmas” for the annual scholarship fundraiser, Jones and I were humorously crooning in an Elvis style off to the rear of the audience. When he called me to the stage I thought OMG he wants me to sing a song with him.\n\nHaving always been the observer rather than a singer, dancer or musician, I was relieved there wasn’t going to be a demand for a duet, but nonetheless felt unsettled about being onstage. However, when Jones explained to the audience I was to receive the “Keys to the City” and all music events in Wrightwood on behalf of Music in the Pines, The Wrightwood Arts Center, Keyboard Art School of Music, and CenterStage Productions, my shyness warmed to gratitude for the acknowledgement.\n\nI have been writing for Mountaineer Progress for 19 years, and the Wrightwood art and music scene captured my attention early on. I remember seeing parades of youth streaming into the Community Building in the summer for Snowline Players with Lora Steinmann. I thought to myself, “There is truly something here.” In time met Dan Campbell, John Burcher, Greg Jones, Tyrone Merriner, Claudia Campbell, Gayle & Tommy Dowling, and a host of others.\n\nAs these early innovators invited friends and colleagues up to the Wrightwood Village, the roots expanded. In no time at all, there were concerts at the Village Grind, the Community Building, The Yodeler, Apple Farm, and Mountain High. In parallel to the popular music venues, Chet Noll’s Keyboard Art School of Music increased from 15 students to 150 students. Additionally, the Wrightwood Classical Concert Series, produced by Joyce Wonderly, broadened the appreciation of music to all ages. Woven throughout the fabric of those entities, the Wrightwood Arts Center brought everyone together promoting The Village, and they will sponsor the 2020 Wrightwood Arts & Wine Festival on September 12.\n\nOf all the events, venues and personalities that come to mind, there was no one who shined brighter than Terry “Big T” DeRouen. He was definitely a world class blues guitarist, yet humble and engaging to friends and fans alike. Through the WBS Music Scholarship named in his honor, Terry lives on forever in Wrightwood-his second home.\n\nIn all those years, there truly would not have been much to write about without the halcyon substance of the community. Unlike the art critic Clement Greenburg who suggested changes to famous painters and then wrote about those improvements, I simply chronicled events, “as-is.” I thank all the creative luminaries in Wrightwood for the inspiration.\n\nWritten December 18, 2019\n\nImpeachment Eve 2019\n\nIt’s Tuesday night December 17 and today 700 historians released an open letter coordinated by the advocacy group Project Democracy, demanding the U.S. House of Representatives vote for impeachment of President Donald Trump. Across the nation tonight on the eve of the historic debate and vote, demonstrators rallied in 600 cities supporting impeachment. However once that is accomplished, there are several theories on how the U.S. Senate will handle the impeachment trial.\n\nLast week Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News he did not intend to be impartial and “Everything I do during this I’m coordinating with White House Council.” In other reports, McConnell indicated he has the power to simply block legislative issues as he did in the past with the Supreme Court nomination of Garland Merrick and other House-passed bills.\n\nHowever, according to Slate.com news, it is not McConnell who will be in charge of the Senate Impeachment Trial. Based on the Senate’s “Rules of Procedure and Practice” and as per rules framed to organize the trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will preside over the trial, removing Vice President Mike Pence as the Senate’s presiding officer. For that position, Roberts will take the oath of office within 24 hours of the bill of impeachment being passed over to the Senate.\n\nAs presiding officer, Roberts will direct all forms of the proceedings. If a Senator objects to Robert’s ruling on relevancy, materiality and redundancy of evidence, he could call for a vote to overturn Robert’s ruling. It would be perfectly constitutional for McConnell to push through sweeping changes to Senate rules, but that action would have to be initiated before the 24-hour deadline. That would probably force Senators to spend Christmas Day in session. With these powerful mechanics Roberts could overturn McConnell’s attempt to seize control.\n\nOnce the trial begins, House attorneys and Trump’s lawyers would have an opportunity to state their cases. It would then be up to House attorneys and Senate attorneys to cooperate in the selection of witnesses. The president has the right to testify in his own defense, with House lawyers given the right to cross-examine. As per Slate.com, “If President Trump decides to boycott proceedings and refuses to allow a legal team to represent him, the trial shall proceed, nevertheless, as upon a plea of not guilty.”\n\nAccording to Slate, “The Chief Justice is a serious jurist, dedicated to sustaining the Supreme Court’s central position in our system of checks and balances. He takes the Constitution seriously and does not appear to be a pawn in McConnell’s scheme. How Roberts conducts the trial may well be a defining moment in American Democracy.”\n\nWritten December 11, 2019\n\nHoliday Music Selections\n\nAs the holidays rapidly approach, music plays a pivotal role energizing us through errands and shopping, as an option for gifts, and as a catalyst in bringing community members together at events. My suggestions for holiday enjoyment include local performances, TV appearances, and memorable CDs.\n\nKicking off the holiday season with a gesture of giving, Tyrone Merriner & Francoise Cooper present The Church of Music on Sunday December 15 in the Wrightwood Community Building located at 1275 Highway 2, from 4:30 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. The holiday feast includes free music, and free food drinks, as nourishment for the body and soul. The non-religious yet spiritually uplifting event combines good music, good food, and dancing, intended to make guests feel better. The free event continues in the New Year on January 19, February 16, and March 15.\n\nWith Dolly Parton, our national treasure, appearing everywhere lately, an interview with Parton regarding her current eight-part Netflix Anthology Series, “Heart Strings” reminded me of her 2017 CD collaboration with Brandi Carlile. Celebrating the 10th anniversary of Carlile’s breakthrough album, entitled The Story, Parton sang an outstanding version of the title song for the charity album benefiting the organization War Child UK, which helps children living in areas of war conflict. The recent album Cover Stories features 14 artists singing 14 cover songs, and includes Parton, Adele, Kris Kristofferson, Indigo Girls, Margo Price, Pearl Jam, and others.\n\nFor Blues Music fans, the North Mississippi All-stars and Jimmy “Duck Holmes” continue the Mississippi blues masters’ legacy. Their new album, Up And Rolling, features sons of legendary Memphis blues rocker Jim Dickinson, Duane Betts (son of Dickie Betts), Mavis Staples - daughter of “Pops” Staples, Jason Isbell and others - from the mountains rather than the Delta.\n\nDarlene Love continues a tradition of decades performing her iconic Wall of Sound hit “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” for the ABC television program “The View” on Friday December 20. In 2010, the song was ranked by Rolling Stone Magazine as the #1 Greatest rock and roll Christmas song. One year ago this season, it remained at #50 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, 56 years after first being recorded.\n\nOn Saturday December 21, the Wrightwood Blues Society (WBS) and CenterStage Productions presents a Christmas Variety Show at the Wrightwood Community Building with dinner at 5:30 p.m. and show at 7. The event is open to the public at $20.00 per ticket, $10.00 for WBS members, and free to gold and lifetime WBS members. Advance tickets can be purchased at www.wrightwoodblues.org\n\nUnique gifts for someone special, created by the musical Chet Noll, are his butterflies and ear wings available at Brier Rose Design on Park Drive.\n\nWritten December 4, 2019\n\nPinon Hills Snowfall\n\nWinter definitely arrived last week, with freezing temperatures and plenty of snow in the foothills of Pinon Hills. Insomuch as I had been preoccupied with finishing construction projects the previous week when the fall weather was delightful, I wasn’t quite ready. Fortunately, the concrete set, the paint dried, I stocked up on groceries and had a good supply of firewood. However, there remained one problem.\n\nWhen temperatures approach freezing, colder weather condenses air and significantly lowers tire pressure on vehicles. As a result of that, the tire pressure sensor light on my Mini Cooper was activated and I headed for Pinon Hills Tire the day before Thanksgiving. While Hugo was inflating my tires to the correct pressure, he told me the front-end alignment was bad and the tires were worn. That was probably due in part to the numerous pot holes on Highway 138 between Mountain Road and Phelan Road.\n\nAt any rate, with a snowstorm approaching, I had no travel plans for the next three days and the tires would be safe enough until new ones could be ordered after the long holiday weekend. The only flaw with the equation was that I was ignoring the potential intensity of Mother Nature. After all I convinced myself, there hadn’t been more than a couple inches of snow in Pinon Hills each winter in more than ten years, and I was certain the roads would be clear in time for my Sunday writing assignment at the Wrightwood Arts Center.\n\nWell, Thanksgiving Day was a glorious winter wonderland in the foothills with eight inches of snow on the ground and clumps of snow on the trees looking like puffy white dogwood blossoms. Farther south on Desert Front Road near Highway 2, friends reported two feet of snow. For a while all roads were closed as Mother Nature seized control.\n\nThe following day was when I realized there was a problem, with eight inches of snow fallen and the Mini Cooper having only seven inches of clearance from the ground. Not to worry I thought, clutching the tractor key. The plan was to remove all the snow from the circular driveway in front of and behind the Mini, smugly thinking if I can’t drive forward I will back out to the dirt road. However, in either case there would be a slight incline to navigate at the road.\n\nThat task consumed most of Friday and continued on Saturday. When completed, I slowly drove the Mini around the curve of the frozen driveway and headed for the incline. However, there was little front tire traction on the ice and it would not be until late Sunday afternoon before it melted and I could drive out.\n\nWritten November 26, 2019\n\nNew Music\n\nThe surprise addition last week to new music being streamed on the Internet, involved none other than President Donald Trump receiving writing credits for the lyrics to his song, “I Want Nothing.” As Trump was departing the White House for Texas, he encountered media reporters and began to defend himself from Impeachment Hearing testimony of U.S. Ambassador, to the European Union, Gordon Sondland. As Trump spoke and held White House stationary with bold talking points, hand-written with a marker, Getty Image Photographer Mark Wilson captured the image of the text.\n\nAs Trump recited what amounted to a spoken-word poem with similarities to transcribed song lyrics, the syncopated rant had a cadence as follows: “I want nothing, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo, Tell Zellinsky (sp) to do the right thing. This is the final word from the President of the U.S.” As the image of the incident spread worldwide, musicians added musical scores to the lyrics and created videos.\n\nThe stand-alone champion video was produced by New York City-based creative director Alex Kliment, receiving 2.6 million views in four days. As Trump appears to be singing the lyrics, Kliment’s musical composition and voice over strongly resembled the frenetic pace of the punk rock band The Ramones.\n\nThe Ramones became famous in musical history for performing 27 songs in 55 minutes in a blistering concert performed at the NYC Palladium and preserved on film by King Biscuit Flower Hour. In his video, Kliment channels the immediacy of The Ramones, and for 22 seconds Donald Trump is a rock star singing “I Want Nothing.” According to NBC News, Kliment commented on his production, “When photos of Trump’s notes started circulating, my first inclination was that they looked like emo Trump lyrics.”\n\nComing in at second place, musician Nick Lutsko wrote music similar to the band Dashboard Confessional. A third rendition by Benjammin Ash put the words into a Morrisey/Smiths-style song. Aside from being a real musical hoot, it will be interesting to learn if the Trump Campaign, which is notorious for using musician’s songs at political rallies without paying royalties, will de-mand royalties for Trump’s song. To hear all the renditions, simply Google search: Donald Trump “I Want Nothing” song.\n\nReturning to serious music, the nominations for Grammy Awards were released last week. Tanya Tucker was nominated for Best Country Album, entitled While I’m Livin,’ and for Best Country Song “Bring My Flowers Now.” That song, co-written by Brandi Carlile, Phil Hanseroth, Tim Hanseroth and Tanya Tucker, has rewarded the country legend with a hit sin-gle. A music video with Brandi Carlile can be viewed on YouTube.\n\nWritten November 19, 2019\n\nMore On Chet Noll\n\nIn my feature article on Chet Noll and his many talents, I mentioned parallel aspirations of fine woodworking and music. However, there were so many details involved in explaining the intricacies of creating his three-dimensional wooden butterflies, that I felt a separate dialogue was needed for his music. In most people’s lives, a single direction is adequate, but for multitasker like Chet, it seemed perfectly natural to dovetail many facets of creativity.\n\nChet Noll began piano lessons at the age of six. In seventh grade wood shop his project was building a violin. Continuing with a string instrument, he began cello lessons at the age of 13. Later on, in college, he would earn a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Piano Performance and Early Keyboard Instrument Building. At the same time, he was constructing clavichords, harpsichords and fortepianos on which he and other students performed.\n\nIn comparing those instruments, Chet explained the clavichord struck the strings very softly and could only be heard in a very small room. In contrast, the harpsichord plucked the strings and was considerably louder. With the invention of the piano, the keyboard returned to striking the strings with more volume produced. With those three instruments, musical composition evolved from the Renaissance and Baroque eras to modern periods of Bach and Mozart.\n\nIn 1976, Chet Noll opened his piano studio and has been teaching ever since. Later, he was trained as a Montessori teacher and learned the art of teaching very young students. In 1993 he founded Keyboard Art School of Music in Wrightwood. Over the years, in conjunction with the guidance of Joyce Wonderly, the original enrollment of 15 students being taught piano and cello by Chet expanded to 150 students being taught a full complement of the arts by 15 teachers.\n\nObserving there have been a few former students who have excelled in college and concert venues, I queried Chet about those successes. He explained that in identifying a few prodigies that walked through the door, “I gave them the tools to excel and the freedom to explore music. I taught them how to capture attention and how to make them proud of their progress.”\n\nContinuing, Chet spoke about composing choral pieces sung by a choir in Riverside. He explained, “In writing the overall concept for different instruments, there are factors of color, texture and timbre involved.” He then smiled and confided, “I like that sweet gravely sound of pencil on paper.”\n\nConcluding with a practical solution when creativity does not pay all the bills, Chet Noll has a day job. For the past 25 years, Chet has been a computer software engineer and feels “An elegant computer code is not an antithesis to art.”\n\nWritten November 13, 2019\n\nMysterious Seaside Tower\n\nIt was certainly was déjàvu when I opened an Email from a friend and saw the photograph of “La Tour”-the mysterious tower of Laguna Beach. Indeed, I had been there some 53 years ago and thanks to massive rock formations protecting it from crashing waves, the poured-in-place concrete tower anchored to those rocks in 1926, has magnificently survived. Rising from the edge of the surf to the top of the bluff, the 60-foot-high tower with a spiral staircase inside, provided access to the beach for the property owners.\n\nAccording to www.californiabeaches.com, the castle-inspired tower with a cone shaped shingle roof was modeled after the French Normandy architecture of the bluff top mansion known as the Norman House. The tower has narrow windows that provide illumination for the stairway, and vantage points to observe the coastline.\n\nShortly after high school I moved out of my parent’s home when I discovered a garage apartment situated on an alley behind medical buildings. It was the perfect place for small parties because at night when all the workers went home I had a parking lot for guests and noise was never a factor because there were no neighbors.\n\nIt was there that a friendship with a former classmate strengthened into a bond serenaded by music. Valerie and I were devotees to the early folk music of Bob Dylan and Donavan Leitch. When I felt a party had run its course, I would simply put Dylan or Donovan on the stereo and rock ‘n’ roll fans would depart leaving Valerie and I alone to muse over every word of the lyrics, into the early morning.\n\nSometime later, Valerie moved to Newport Beach and I would spend weekends there enjoying the sun, the surf and music. On one occasion, Valerie said she had surprise for me, holding up two flashlights. In the evening we drove to Victoria Beach in south Laguna, parked in a residential neighborhood and walked down narrow concrete steps to the sand. The sun had set and darkness was approaching as we walked north. At that time, the Victoria Beach Cove was sparsely developed with a few small bungalows and there was nobody on the beach.\n\nWalking farther up the beach, I gasped when I saw a medieval tower connecting the beach to the bluff top. Valerie had been there many times before and had met the caretaker who had agreed to leave the door unlocked for our rendezvous.\n\nInside the tower as gossamer clouds wafted across a crescent moon, we talked about life’s changes and sang the lyrics to Donavan’s mystical song “Celeste.” To experience something almost as good go to: http://californiabeaches.com/la-tour-mysterious-tower-laguna/ for directions to “La Tour.”\n\nWritten November 6, 2019\n\nSteve & Ali Saga Continues\n\nSometime after the incident at the Kinney Estate, in which Steve McQueen & Ali MacGraw roared through on a Harley and ended up in a shouting match with Roland and Kathy Kinney, I encountered Ali once again at Trancas Market. She confided on never having been so embarrassed in her life and thanked me for negotiating an apology before the Sherriff deputy allowed them to drive off. She also questioned if I did landscape work for other clients because she and Steve were having a problem with a crazy and loud next-door neighbor.\n\nAfter following her home to their Broad Beach residence, I met McQueen. After brief introductions and recollections of the motorcycle incident, he began a verbal tirade about loud music, wild parties and bright lights shining in their windows, emanating from next door. I gulped when I heard that from the “Bad Boy” of Hollywood motion pictures. However, McQueen was now living a sedate lifestyle of being married with young children in the household. When I asked about the neighbor, I gasped. It was Keith Moon, drummer of the British band The Who, and yes indeed - the “Bad Boy” of Rock ‘n’ Roll music.\n\nAfter thinking about the situation, I suggested a dense pine forest of mature boxed trees. I knew that Johnny, the construction manager for the nearby Herb Alpert Estate, had laborers and heavy equipment needed for the job. He was well experienced at handling boxed trees and repositioning them constantly at Alpert’s. He even moved the redwood forest from the local Methodist Church, across the road from Shangri-La Ranch recording studio where I used to listen to the music at night, to Alpert’s home. As for McQueen’s pines, they would be purchased from Wensel Gibbs Wholesale Nursery just a couple miles away.\n\nThe difficult part of the project was digging the holes and setting the dirt aside to be backfilled later, while the easy part was having the trees delivered and lifted into place with a crane. I’m not sure what Keith Moon thought about the operation, but in one fell swoop he could no longer be seen parading around in a Nazi uniform to the drumbeat in his head. Additionally, the thick vegetation damped the noise from next door and the height of the trees blocked any sight of the adjacent home.\n\nSometime later, I again ran into Ali at the market, and when I asked how effective the sound buffer was she laughed and said, “Steve and I hardly heard any of the construction noise for the ramp. “The ramp I questioned?” Still laughing Ali replied, “Evel Knievel cleared the pines, splashed down in the swimming pool and ran out the gate.”\n\nWritten October 30, 2019\n\nSteve McQueen & Ali MacGraw\n\nWith the recent death of motion picture luminary Robert Evans, there have been many photographs of his third wife, Ali MacGraw, on the Internet. After all, she was married to him longer than the other six wives, gave birth to Evans’ only child, and starred in “Goodbye Columbus,” and “Love Story.” Those films launched her career, and they orchestrated a financial turnaround for Paramount Studios under the leadership of Evans. When the revolving door of romance turned, Ali MacGraw moved on to Steve McQueen.\n\nI was pushing my shopping cart down the aisle of Trancas Market one evening when I approached the stunning beauty of Ali MacGraw. I quietly passed without staring, turned down the next aisle and OMG she had done the same and this time as we passed one another, she smiled. Without a trace of makeup, she was the most gorgeous looking actress I had even seen.\n\nSometime later when I was the landscape manager of the Kinney Estate, Roland & Kathy were cruising around in the golf cart one morning when a man and woman on a Harley roared through. Slamming on the brakes the man shouted, “Get out of the way old man. Pack your bags and get out. I’m going to buy this place!” When I heard all the commotion, I called the Sherriff and ran up the driveway towards Pacific Coast Highway. Much to my surprise, the intruders were Steve McQueen & Ali MacGraw, and everybody was involved in a heated shouting match.\n\nWhen the officers arrived, Roland insisted that McQueen should be arrested for trespassing and for insulting him in front of his wife. As one officer spoke to me and the other to Roland Kinney, the big questions were, “Does Mr. Kinney know who these people are?” and my retort, “Do Steve & Ali know who Mr. Kinney is?” Anticipating a legal skirmish between an older Los Angeles millionaire, and prominent California Club member, versus nouveau riche film stars, the officers convinced Steve & Ali they would lose. And so, they apologized and were allowed to depart.\n\nA few months later, I saw McGraw again at Trancas Market. This time Ali was gushing with embarrassment and as we chatted she asked if I did landscape work for clients other than the Kinney’s. When I explained I was also a landscape designer, she appeared delighted. I followed Ali home to the Broad Beach residence where McQueen did not mince his swear words about a crazy and loud next-door neighbor. Ali desperately hoped I could create something that would prevent the two antagonists from seeing or hearing one another, because ocean front life had become miserable.\n\nNext week, the story continues.\n\nWritten October 23, 2019\n\nAutumn Chores\n\nDoes your skin feel dry and itchy? If it does, it is because another Santa Ana Wind condition is approaching. The fact that we can feel the dryness in the air, also provides a reminder that plants and trees still need to be watered in the autumn. Even as leaves turn colors and begin to fall, root systems continue to need moisture, be it rainfall or irrigation, to recuperate from the hot summer.\n\nIf you have native plants, you will notice that wilted leaves begin to turn shinny green with the cooler temperatures. Indeed, now is the time to plant natives so they will acclimate before frosts set in. You might also notice that at the same time lilac bushes are losing their leaves, tiny green buds are beginning to form. And, while many plants above ground are preparing to sleep through the winter, bulbs underground are only half asleep - protected from frost by the soil above, while storage organs are strengthened and root systems expand to orchestrate springtime blooming.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy working outdoors this time of year. The lighting is different, temperatures are mild, and there is plenty of vibrant color. It’s a good time to prune dead branches from trees while there are still a few leaves to distinguish what is alive. I find the autumn more desirable than springtime for this task because as the branches fall they won’t damage freshly sprouted leaves. It is also preferable to prune conifers in cooler weather, to prevent excessive sap bleeding, which can occur during hot summer months.\n\nIn our foothill and mountain locales, which are subject to snowfall, pruning back weak branches to stronger limbs in the fall is a good preventative measure. It is rather unsettling to look out the window and see wispy branches laden with heavy snow and then hear that cracking sound. Preparing for rain or snow, there should not be any branches, which could break and cause damage, extending over rooflines.\n\nWith leaves turning colors and blowing everywhere in the wind, there is a good chance that rain gutters are filling up with debris. It’s so much more satisfying to climb up on a ladder now and perform the cleaning task than it is to have water cascading against windows and doorways. An inexpensive wire screen for downspouts, which can be purchased at hardware stores, prevents clogging and a much more tedious repair project in the cold and rain.\n\nNow is the time to get outdoors and enjoy the best season of the year, becoming the observer of what has to be remedied. When winter arrives, puttering around indoors surely beats struggling outdoors with malfunctions.\n\nWritten October 16, 2019\n\nDolly Parton - Literacy Angel\n\nA recent article in Paste, the internet music magazine, revealed yet another compassionate side to Country Music star Dolly Parton. The excerpt in Paste is from the debut novel authored by Elizabeth Chiles Shelburne, and named after the Dolly Parton song, “Holding on to Nothing.” It’s all about the Imagination Library, founded by Parton in 1995, which provides free books to young children around the world.\n\nDolly Parton grew up in the poverty-stricken mountain country of Sevier County in East Tennessee, where many people were illiterate - including her father. As a child, she was a gifted singer and had dreams that her talent would take her away from that locale. In time, that dream came true and she became one of the most famous performers in Country Music. However, fame would never erase where she came from and she would never forget her people.\n\nIn her heart she realized that having books in the household encouraged children to read books and to dream of liberating outcomes. She also felt those dreams helped children to stay in school and learn how to achieve success. Initially, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library mailed free books, once a month, to 1,760 children in Sevier County.\n\nWhen the literacy rate there dramatically improved, Parton expanded the program to impoverished areas throughout the United States. Taking a deep breath with more success, Parton’s dream then went international. Some 24 years later, Imagination Library is now mailing one million books per month to children in the U.S., Australia, Britain, Canada, and Ireland.\n\nAt the 2019 Newport Folk Festival when Brandi Carlile introduced a surprise guest performer to the audience, Dolly Parton spoke of her country roots in the mountains of East Tennessee. In the next moment, as she joined in with Carlile’s latest configuration band The Highwomen, Dolly Parton’s country base was expanded to a new generation of music fans.\n\nA recent documentary film Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris Trio is enlightening as to the big heart of Dolly Parton, and a must view on YouTube. The 2019 documentary Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice, is also a reminder that Parton expanded way beyond her typical fan base to be integral in the West Coast Country Music Scene.\n\nGetting back to the Paste article, Elizabeth Shelburne grew up just 60 miles from Sevier County. She was inspired by the music of Dolly Parton as a child and considered her to be an angel in guiding others to achieve their dreams. In her music, her literacy campaign and newfound recognition, Parton is definitely an angel to millions. Go to: http://imaginationlibrary.com/ where Dolly Parton’s motto is, “You can never get enough books into the hands of enough children.”\n\nWritten October 9, 2019\n\nRecycling Conundrum\n\nFor those who are conscientious about aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and glass containers ending up in landfills, and for others who collect those items to redeem them for their cash California Refund Value (CRV), the closure of two recycling centers in the Tri-Community poses a problem. In August, RePlanet Recycling announced it was closing all 284 centers in California and ceasing operations. Shortly afterwards, Phelan Recycling (actually located in Pinon Hills) on Buckwheat Road, also closed. In both cases, the depressed value of recyclables due to trade war tariffs has erased profits for those businesses.\n\nEver since moving to Pinon Hills, recycling was a breeze with Phelan Recycling located nearby on Buckwheat Road next to CR&R, and RePlanet Recycling located in the Stater Bros. shopping center. When the corner of my storage container was filled with bags of cans and bottles, I would sort everything and load up the car. At each locale I could earn $15.00 on a quarterly basis, which was not a lot but, it paid for a few gallons of gasoline.\n\nI could have earned a bit more under CRV regulation"
