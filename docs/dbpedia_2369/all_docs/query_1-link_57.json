        "text": "Richard Thompson 13 Rivers (2018)\n\nFrom soundblab.com\n\nWhat, never heard of Richard Thompson? It’s okay, you’re not alone. But for over the last 50 years, he’s been one of Rock’s great guitar virtuosos. From his Fairport Convention days to his classics like ‘Calvary Cross’, he’s been dazzling audiences under the radar for decades. He may look more like your high school history professor than Keith Richard, but his guitar playing is pure wizardry in action. The Rock world was never played fair but Thompson’s managed to hang in there as a critic’s darling and a musician’s musician. In terms of being a hitmaker, perhaps it’s a question of his steadfast Englishness or the fact he isn’t afraid of throwing the furniture around in the dark. In any event, these days Richard Thompson is more famous for not being more famous.\n\nOf course, his stellar guitar playing is only the half of it. Unlike Clapton, Thompson’s a prolifically brilliant songwriter. Witty, dark, twisted and when he wants to be, touching. In addition, he’s grown into his own as a vocalist, possessing a gruff edge that can jeer with rancor or sooth with world-weariness and compassion.\n\nAs for Thompson’s output, it’s almost predictable how reliably good his albums are. So, ho-hum here’s another good Richard Thompson album. One might even go so far as to wish he’d put out a bad one, just to break up the monotony. Subjectively speaking, I prefer some to others, but in the scheme of things I find 13 Rivers to be a strong release even by Thompson’s damnably dependable standards.\n\nThings kick off with brooding, doomy, ‘Storm Won’t Come’. ‘Blow these old buildings down, fire to burn what fire may. Rain to wash it all away.” Yet rather than blow us away, Thompson keeps up the tension on the guitar, never quite letting all hell break loose. Suiting the action to the word. In the end, this is a song about impotence and frustration. Wishing for a downpour of biblical proportions, yet lacking the power to summon the weather to one’s bidding. Speaking of the Bible, biblical allusions abound on 13 Rivers.\n\nThe spiky ‘Rattle Within’ gallops up like a stray horse from the apocalypse. When Jesus, voodoo, and booze don’t work, “Who’s going to save you from the rattle within?” Musically, the song is faintly reminiscent of ‘MGBT’ (off 1994’s Mirror Blue) with its menacing Folk rhythms and nervy guitars.\n\nIf the first three ditties weren’t jolly enough, ‘Her Love Was Meant For Me’ has a sentiment worthy enough to wilt the darling buds of optimism: “Don’t need a ticket for the future. The apocalypse is free. Armageddon’s in the mirror.”\n\nThe driving, hypnotic ‘Bones of Gilead’ doesn’t do much to lighten the mood. A storm of neurosis is summoned offering only “heartbreak of the giving kind.” At this point, it isn’t hard to see this is quite a pissed off album. I suspect Mr. Thompson is none too happy with the sorry state of worldly affairs. While Thompson is never specific, the metaphors and allusions all point to a society going to hell in a hand-basket filled with corruption, cruelty, and hypocrisy. Everything thing is open to interpretation, but it isn’t hard to diagnose the disease. Its been with us from the beginning. The knack is finding a cure. ‘The Dog In You’ seems to take on the figurehead of this ailment. “It’s not love you’re hunting down. You’re on the trail of the innocent, the frail.” Remind you of anyone? Someone who reportedly loathes canines and who’s favorite put down is, “dog”? Maybe, I’m reading too much into it. Then again, maybe, not.\n\n‘My Rock, My Rope,’ is the closest thing you’ll find to a love song on this long player. However, it’s more a plea than ode. Elsewhere, ‘You Can’t Reach Me,’ is one of the catchiest numbers on the album. Read between the lines and it’s a satiric skewering of the religious right.\n\nOn ‘O Cinderella’, Thompson dips his pen in poison ink over a Marie Antoinette trying to pass herself off as Cinderella. “I’m not very house trained it’s true, but I want to dust cobwebs with you,” he sarcastically enthuses. Close on Cinderella’s heels is, ‘No Matter’. Chockfull of sweet nothings like, ‘contemplating suicide before the tide has turned’.\n\n“Pride won’t let you walk away without blood on your face,” Thompson sneers on the song of the same name. “Vanity, vanity, all is vanity. Do you feel something for the rest of humanity?” he continues. A sentiment that could extend from the personal to those steeped in nationalistic pride for personal gain.\n\nThe closer, ‘Shaking The Gates’ dials the vitriol back with the ageless query, “If angels are real, then who needs dreams?”. It’s an unexpectedly vulnerable curtain to an album calling for storms to wreak havoc, and hypocrisy to be hoisted on its own petard. Thompson may be shaking the gates of heaven, but he appears to have no intention of going gently into that good night.\n\nTrue, 13 Rivers isn’t as ambitious as 2010’s Dream Attic nor tortured as his 1982 classic, Shoot Out The Lights. Yet there is much to commend it. This is a snarling, slow burn of a record. One that takes a few listens to fully bare its fangs. It’s a record that rewards with repeated listens. The surface of these winding tributaries may look like smooth sailing, but what lies beneath are indeed troubled waters. With more than a few monsters lurking below. As for Thompson being Rock’s greatest living guitarist, I don’t really believe there is such a thing as “the greatest” anything. But will point out that unlike Hendrix, he’s still alive. And unlike Page, he’s still cutting records. What’s more, he’s aging incredibly well.\n\nRichard & Linda Thompson – I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight (1974)\n\nFrom altrockchic.com\n\nI really don’t like writing negative reviews. I mean, who the fuck wants to listen to lousy music, shoddy performances, narcissistic love fests or lazy efforts by musicians who can coast on their fame because they know the fanatics will buy the damn record anyway? By extension, I don’t enjoy singling out substandard work by a musician on a particular album because I know from baseball that everyone can have an off day and going 0 for 4 or getting knocked out of the box after a third of an inning doesn’t mean that management should immediately ship the guy’s ass back to the minors.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, I have to call them like I hear them. In relation to Linda Thompson, I felt she mailed in her performance on Shoot Out the Lights, playing to her weakness as a technically limited singer. I still stand by that opinion.\n\nTo be fair(er), it’s likely that part of what drove her rather flat contributions to that album was the emotional drain of a crumbling marriage. Some performers deal with those situations better than others, and some like Billie Holiday or Robert Johnson were masters at integrating painful emotions based on traumatic life experiences into their vocal performances. And while duos who can barely tolerate each other are not all that unusual (Simon v. Garfunkel, Rogers v. Astaire, Don Everly v. Phil Everly), a marital split is the acrimonious experience par excellence.\n\nSo, to set the record straight and restore balance to the universe, while Shoot Out the Lights was not an album about the break-up as many critics claimed, the emotional strain from the break-up likely resulted in a less-than-satisfying effort from Linda Thompson.\n\nI can’t go back in time and change Linda’s performance on that particular album—but what I can do is recognize her shining moments, and I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight features many of those moments. Singers with limited range and variation can compensate with energy, commitment and emotional connection, and Linda’s performances on the album are in perfect sync with its highly varied lyrical content. Some of the songs demand exuberance while others call for bleak despair or bitter cold, and Linda’s vocals are on-point every time. Her vocal performances surpass the efforts of her then-hubby, who certainly took his time going through the voice change most guys complete during adolescence. Richard’s early vocals sound somewhat thin in comparison to the richer voice that emerged on Shoot Out the Lights, but he more than compensates with obvious spirit, outstanding guitar work and best-in-class songwriting.\n\nThose songs feature modern stories and character sketches largely grounded in vernacular and instrumentation of British folk, an approach that gives the listener some comfort by suggesting that the highs and lows of the human experience we experience today are pretty much the same highs and lows experienced by our ancestors. This orientation is clearly demonstrated on the opening track, “When I Get to the Border.” The first two verses could have been written by an anonymous songcrafter of the 18th Century, but when the narrator reveals the reasons behind his desire to escape to a place beyond the border, there’s no question he’s a 20th Century Man experiencing classic Sunday night dread:\n\nMonday morning, Monday morning\n\nClosing in on me\n\nI’m packing up and I’m running away\n\nTo where nobody picks on me\n\nAs he describes all the wonderful changes awaiting him once he crosses that border (“My troubles will all turn to sand/When I get to the border”), I hear echoes from the conversations I’ve had recently with friends stuck in the USA, who desperately believe in one of two fairy tales: one, if we get rid of Trump, everything will be all right; and two, if I move to (Europe, Asia, South America, Australia) my life will suddenly become immeasurably better. They forget that running away from a bad situation never works unless you have a place you really, really, really want to run to. Richard Thompson cleverly allows the narrator to feast on this sort of one-sided fantasy for much of the song, a subtle hint that his dreams of reaching the Land of Oz are unlikely to bear fruit. The one thing this gent does have to look forward to is a “Salty girl with yellow hair/Waiting in that rocking chair,” an image that doesn’t give us much hope that she’s the British version of Helen of Troy.\n\nThe builds and blends on “When I Come to the Border” are simply fabulous. The song opens with very modest acoustic guitar chords cueing the band to enter with low-key backing. The first verse is voice, acoustic, bass and drums; on the second verse, Richard adds some light electric guitar fills. The first smile on the listener’s face takes place at the start of the bridge, when wham! Linda and Richard harmonize over Richard’s mandolin, suddenly turning black-and-white into full color. A mandolin-electric guitar duet adds another smile and more color, creating a new plateau that continues through the end of the verses. The long fade makes the smile permanent as the band takes the piece to an even higher plane, featuring a cornucopia of instruments trading leads and fills—guitar, krummhorn, accordion, concertina, mandolin, tin whistle—that bring to mind the everybody-join-in-the-fun atmosphere of a pub with singing waiters. Rising from its modest beginnings, “When I Get to the Border” turns out to be a welcoming display of the songwriting excellence and musical variety that characterize the album.\n\nRichard Thompson described “Calvary Cross” as a song “about a muse, or about anything. It’s about a drive that you might not want, but it’s there, and you’re a slave to it.” The woman’s “one green eye” indicates she’s a jealous mistress, seeking nothing less than complete control (“Everything you do/Oh, everything you do/You do for me”). The other half of this fascinating creature exists on a the positive pole, one who will “be your light until doomsday.” The balance is described in the line, “My claw’s in you and my light’s in you,” but she immediately adds, “This is your first day of sorrow.” The artist can never escape the clutches of the muse, and the song’s setting under the calvary cross is meant to convey a life of suffering.\n\nMost of the buzz about this song has to do with Richard’s guitar work, particularly in the many live versions available on recordings both legitimate and bootleg (you can sample several on YouTube). The primary solo on the studio version album serves as a lengthy introduction to the song, a twisting, tortured barrage of notes that echo bagpipe and sitar. The deluxe version of the album features a version that clocks in at almost ten minutes and in parts feels more like a duet featuring both Richard and drummer Dave Mattacks in roughly equal measure. The live solos vary quite a bit, but most take place in an extended segment following the verses, where Richard goes deep to connect with his muse, depicting the love-hate affair with stunning work that is absolutely entrancing.\n\nLinda takes the lead on “Withered and Died,” and it’s hard for me not to hear this song about crushed dreams through the lens of a present-day inhabitant of the United States:\n\nThis cruel country has driven me down\n\nTeased me and lied, teased me and lied\n\nI’ve only sad stories to tell to this town\n\nMy dreams have withered and died\n\nPerhaps “Withered and Died” should become the American anti-anthem of our time, as “We Gotta Get Out of This Place” became the anti-anthem for soldiers stuck in the jungles and rice paddies of Vietnam. Great songs often express feelings that listeners transfer to other contexts that have no connection to the songwriter’s intent.\n\nIn truth, “Withered and Died” has more to do with the dashed hopes and dreams of a young woman who arrives in a new town full of excitement, and her initial impressions indicate the town threw out the welcome mat for her: “Kind words in my ear, kind faces to see.” Things go sour quickly due to a failed relationship, leaving her with a broken spirit, hungering for freedom from her troubles:\n\nIf I was a butterfly, live for a day\n\nI could be free just blowing away\n\nWhile Linda’s vocal is appropriately despairing throughout much of the song, her voice rises to the occasion on that couplet, momentarily floating high above the understated background support to express her one remaining wish. “Withered and Died” is a deeply moving piece, a timeless song about the challenges inherent in the rite of passage from the naive hopes of adolescence to the inevitable disappointments of adulthood.\n\nAfter two trips to the dark side, something cheerful would be really nice right about now and Linda delivers with her spirited rendition of “I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight,” receiving suitably brassy support from The CWS (Manchester) Silver Band. The desire to swap regimentation for chaos that drives the working masses to bars and dance floors on weekend nights is vividly depicted in both Linda’s vocal and in the lines given to the character she plays. “I need to spend some money and it just won’t wait,” she explains to her escort, revealing herself as a proud and independent woman of sufficient means to make it through the weekend. In addition to close dancing, she is desperately hungry for the release of manageable madness:\n\nA couple of drunken knights rolling on the floor\n\nIs just the kind of mess I’m looking for\n\nI’m gonna dream ’till Monday comes in sight\n\nI want to see the bright lights tonight\n\nOur heroine obviously doesn’t mind the violent potential of the “big boys . . . spoiling for a fight,” as she views mixing it up as just another form of release unique to the male half of the species. More than just a “let’s party” song, “I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight” captures the existential motivation that sends millions of people to Vegas every year—the need to let one’s hair down, show some cleavage and do all the naughty things that are socially unacceptable inside the boundaries of nine to five—all within the safe confines of a non-judgmental environment supported by the sacred commandment, “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.”\n\nI have a dream . . . that someday the Vegas ethic will become the universal imperative of the human race.\n\nThat dream is somewhat tempered by the harsh realities of alcoholism and mental illness described starkly and movingly in “Down Where the Drunkards Roll.” Linda approaches her vocal with sad detachment mellowed by obvious compassion for the victims and a clear sense of the indignity of it all. Accompanied only by Richard’s exquisite work on acoustic guitar and chilling bass-range harmonies, Linda relates stories of the fallen in the first three verses—the young bucks who drink themselves into oblivion, the young man who fails in love and is forced to seek a low-priced hooker, and a woman suffering from unknown trauma who finds some kind of validation in the unreal world of the outcast:\n\nThere goes a troubled woman\n\nShe dreams a troubled dream\n\nShe lives out on the highway\n\nShe keeps her money clean\n\nSoon she’ll be returning\n\nTo the place where she’s the queen\n\nDown where the drunkards roll (2)\n\nThe final verse points out the curious similarities between the non-judgmental ethic of weekend nights and the even looser norms of acceptance among people who have hit rock bottom. Those banished from society for their failures, shortcomings and clinical diagnoses are more likely to find comfort among the fallen:\n\nYou can be a gambler\n\nWho never drew a hand\n\nYou can be a sailor\n\nWho never left dry land\n\nYou can be Lord Jesus\n\nAll the world will understand\n\nDown where the drunkards roll (2)\n\nEven at this relatively early stage in his career, Richard Thompson’s insistence on writing songs about those whom society would rather forget is uncompromising, and his gift for language results in songs like this that are searing and unforgettable.\n\nFiguring wisely that we need another break from human inhumanity, Richard offers the very traditional “We Sing Hallelujah.” There are many English folk songs that employ a series of metaphoric riddles to describe the human experience; here Richard adds to the genre with a series of metaphors about men (in the outdated, generic universal use of the word). Unsurprisingly, the metaphors all end in disaster: “a man is like a rusty wheel . . . and then he falls apart,” “a man is like a briar . . . he laughs like a clown when his fortune’s down and his clothes are ragged and torn,” etc. The last riddle paints a particularly gloomy picture of man’s existence:\n\nA man is like his father\n\nWishes he never was born\n\nHe longs for the time when the clock will chime\n\nAnd he’s dead forevermore\n\nAs the music clearly communicates good fun with the return of the krummhorns and a joyous group vocal . . . and the chorus is only partially and ironically dreary . . . I’m going to claim that “We Sing Hallelujah” is about the human tendency to see the worst side of everything in life balanced by the opposing force of the human spirit that picks us up when we’re down. The song certainly accomplishes the mission of restoring listener energy after “Down Where the Drunkards Roll.”\n\nThe good fun fades quickly into memory with the heartbreaking “Has He Got a Friend for Me,” a tune about a girl who is “clumsy and shy” who believes she wouldn’t attract notice even if she were “in the gutter, or dangling down from a tree.” The line that breaks my heart with its undeniable truth is “And nobody wants to know anyone lonely like me,” for loneliness is often accompanied by auras of awkwardness or desperation that make potential friends wary of offering their company. Linda navigates the challenging melodic line while maintaining just the right levels of the varying emotions; Richard’s acoustic guitar is tender and empathetic; the tin whistle mirrors the thin fragility of the anti-heroine.\n\nChanging costume in record time, Linda transforms herself from future spinster to saucy sprite in “The Little Beggar Girl.” Marked by a traditional full-throated chorus that bears repeating again and again, the peg-legged little wench balances her dependence on contributions from the elite with a tart tongue, delivering pungent asides as the privileged step down from their lofty perches to make their modest donations:\n\nI’ve been down to London, I’ve been up to Crewe\n\nI travel far and wide to do the work that I do\n\n‘Cause I love taking money off a snob like you\n\nFor I’m only a poor little beggar girl\n\nLinda really gets into the part, varying her tone from sarcastically sweet and accommodating to screw-the-bastards bite. The chorus is an absolute delight, with Richard entering in harmony as a cue for the listener to sing along. It’s almost impossible not to join in by the third go-round, and melodic structure gives those participating at home lots of opportunity to contribute harmonies or responsive fills.\n\nYou’ll need to save some of the positive energy from “Poor Little Beggar Girl” to get you through the bleakest song of all, “End of the Rainbow.” The song is structured as a dramatic monologue in which a father of a newborn leans over the cradle and imparts his wisdom concerning the life journey awaiting his child:\n\nI feel for you, you little horror\n\nSafe at your mother’s breast\n\nNo lucky break for you around the corner\n\n‘Cause your father is a bully\n\nAnd he thinks that you’re a pest\n\nAnd your sister she’s no better than a whore\n\nLife seems so rosy in the cradle\n\nBut I’ll be a friend I’ll tell you what’s in store\n\nThere’s nothing at the end of the rainbow\n\nThere’s nothing to grow up for anymore\n\nGee thanks, Dad!\n\nThe father goes on to tell the kid how capitalists large and small will continually rip him off, how his future adult male companions will put a knife to his throat at the slightest provocation, that everyone competes against everyone else and that most of the people who inhabit the world belong to the walking dead. He offers no hope, no helpful advice and not a single sliver of sunshine. The song has made critics somewhat uneasy, and several have expressed discomfort with the world view Richard Thompson expresses in those unrelentingly dreary lines.\n\nMethinks they’re missing the point here. “End of the Rainbow” has nothing to do with how Richard Thompson views the world. He’s not talking here—the father is. Richard is playing a role, capiche? This is a song about parenting, not how shitty the world is. The question listeners should consider once the song ends is, “How do we allow such losers to become parents?” This is a guy who has already decided that his other kid is a worthless piece of crap, so why have another child? He’s obviously not doing well from a financial perspective, so why add this “little horror” to the balance sheet? And because he’s failed, he views the world through a madly discolored lens that convinces him that it’s everyone else’s fault but his own. This isn’t about unplanned parenthood, this is about unthinking parenthood and the traumatic consequences that follow from having a parent who hates a kid from the moment of conception—and the disastrous social consequences that follow.\n\nFrom a musical perspective, “End of the Rainbow” is a hidden gem without a single superfluous note. The opening passage is an electric-acoustic duet where the acoustic guitar reflects the softly lit environment of a nursery and the electric guitar paints a picture of tense uncertainty with sustained fretboard-initiated vibrato. The chord pattern is relatively straightforward, with all the punctuation found in descending chords that eventually find their way back to the Cm root (adjusted to the Am position with a capo on the third fret).\n\nThe chord structure to “The Great Valerio” is more challenging, with the base pattern consisting of altering Bm/Fmdim chords, and an out-of-key shift to C#7 to open the chorus (again, much easier to play with a capo, this time on the second fret). The theme of human fascination with the tightrope walker had been covered a few years before in Jethro Tull’s “For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me,” though Ian Anderson focused more on the secret pleasure of “being there” when the tightrope walker slips (“Like the man hung from the trapeze/Whose fall will satisfy”), whereas Richard Thompson uses the opportunity to comment on the nature of life itself and heroic projection. Linda’s vocal is suitably cold and detached, and while Richard’s acoustic guitar is typically excellent, I have a strong preference for June Tabor’s cover that opens her album Aleyn. Not only is June a far more capable singer and a practiced devotee of Richard’s music, but the addition of accordion and strings creates a macabre circus atmosphere in sync with the lyrical content.\n\nAnd that wraps it up for I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, a commercial failure dismissed by the critics of the day now considered something of a masterpiece. The album still gets little in the way of tangible respect; according to Richard Thompson’s website, it is “out of print” in the USA. I attribute the lack of public support to the majority’s desire to hear music that makes them happy and avoid music that makes them sad—or, to put it another way, most people want to hear music that validates their fantasies and want nothing to do with music that deals with their unpleasant realities.\n\nGiven that unpleasant reality, it turns out that the real hero of the album isn’t The Great Valerio, but a courageous artist by the name of Richard Thompson.\n\nRichard Thompson at 70: on love, loss and being a Muslim in Trump’s US (2019)\n\nFrom theguardian.com Sept 2019\n\nThe master of British folk music has weathered a second divorce and lives in the US where ‘Trump has ramped up bigotry considerably’. At least ex-wife Linda has forgiven him\n\nRichard Thompson is drinking mint tea in a Hampstead coffee shop – he doesn’t touch coffee or alcohol – and between Islam and cricket, he’s discussing the remarkable guest list for his upcoming 70th birthday celebration at the Royal Albert Hall in London. “I don’t like being the centre of attention, strange as it sounds,” he insists. “I just want to have a few friends over.”\n\nThe man the LA Times once hailed as “the finest rock songwriter after Dylan” and “the best electric guitarist since Hendrix” will switch between electric and acoustic guitars, and hopes that “most guests will have time to do a couple of songs”. The 15 guests will include Pink Floyd hero David Gilmour, who has featured alongside Richard in a Rolling Stone magazine best ever guitarist list, and who, as a soloist, covered Richard’s 1975 song Dimming of the Day. “He’ll do that,” says Richard. “And then do something of his … or Floyd’s. He has always been a nice guy and we share a love of all things Fender.”\n\nThe cast will also include old and new British folk heroes, from Martin and Eliza Carthy to Olivia Chaney. And then there will be Harry Shearer, the American actor and comedian, reviving his role as Derek Smalls from Spinal Tap, along with his wife Judith Owen who joined Richard in 2006 for the 1,000 Years of Popular Music project, in which they reworked anything from Sumer Is Icumen In to Britney Spears.\n\nRichard Thompson may be a virtuoso guitarist, but he insists that it’s the songs that are most important to him. “Most of what I do revolves around the song. If I play guitar, I’m not interested in playing instrumentals. I like playing guitar to accompany a voice, or if there is a solo, then extending the narrative of the song.” So are his thrilling, spontaneous-sounding acoustic or electric guitar solos inspired by the song? “Yes, it’s that way round. Absolutely.”\n\nFor more than 50 years, his songwriting output has been remarkable, from the gently bleak and lyrical ballads that are performed regularly in folk clubs (where some listeners probably think they are traditional) through to equally bleak, upbeat favourites like Tear-Stained Letter or the pounding, edgy and emotional stories of foreboding on his latest electric album, 13 Rivers.\n\nIt’s a set filled with religious imagery, “because I love the King James Bible, a beautiful piece of poetry, and you have to speak to people in a language that’s familiar”. And it was written, he says, “in a difficult personal time”. Last year, after the ending of his second marriage, to Nancy Covey, he quit California to move to New Jersey, home of his new partner, singer-songwriter and author Zara Phillips. But he insists that the album is not autobiographical. “I have no perspective on what I am doing. I write a song and think, ‘Where does this come from?’ Me? I wrote this? I write fiction … I’m just enjoying myself, throwing lines together. I think it always reflects your own experience and feelings, but it isn’t always in a way that’s clear. If you find something honest enough in yourself then it will be universal.”\n\nBut The Storm Won’t Come – “There’s a smell of death where I lay my head…” – is surely about his divorce? “But you’ve also got Trump in the White House, so maybe there’s a little bit of that in there as well.” And Her Love Was Meant For Me, isn’t that straightforward? “It’s a song I find very confusing, actually.”https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xt2a3WliLA4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembedListen to The Storm Won’t Come\n\nRichard insists that the Albert Hall show won’t be a retrospective, but it will certainly be nostalgic. Another guest will be Hugh Cornwell, of Stranglers fame, who played with Richard in his first band, Emil & the Detectives, when they were both 14 and pupils at William Ellis school near Hampstead Heath. Then there will Simon Nicol and Ashley Hutchings, who along with Richard were the core trio in different teenage bands who evolved into the first Fairport Convention. They will be joined by Dave Mattacks, the drummer who joined Fairport a little later, alongside the late Sandy Denny, to record Liege and Lief, the classic album released 50 years ago that kickstarted British folk-rock. “We might dip our toe into that repertoire,” says Richard. “And someone is going to do a bit of Sandy.”\n\nSo how did he feel about that era now? “We thought that if we are in the charts and it’s taken seriously, it could change peoples’ attitudes to British music and you might have people stopping using American accents when singing. It was totally revolutionary at the time. Rock music with an element of British traditional music in it was pretty much our innovation, and I’m very proud of that. And when people in other countries saw we did, it was possible for them to contemporise their own cultures.”\n\nAfter the Fairports, Richard recorded a serious of glorious, mostly bleak albums with his first wife Linda Thompson, a powerful, evocative singer whose career has been marred by dysphonia, a larynx disorder that makes it increasingly difficult for her to sing. She’ll also be there, along with their musical children, singer-songwriter and producer Teddy Thompson and Kami Thompson, who works with her husband, the Pretenders guitarist James Walbourne, in the Rails. And to complete the family line-up there will Richard’s new partner Zara Phillips.\n\nSo how would Linda feel if Zara sings one of the Richard and Linda classics such as I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight or Wall of Death, as seems likely? “It wouldn’t seem odd,” Linda tells me. “If it were Richard and Emmylou Harris I might be a bit miffed, because she is a genius! And I like Zara. And Richard has changed has a lot. He is much nicer and he’s happy – so that’s great”.\n\nIt was during his marriage to Linda that Richard discovered Islam. The son of a Scottish policeman, he was brought up as a Presbyterian “which I was not interested in. I became a Muslim when I was 23 and have been one ever since.” He discovered Sufism, a mystical form of Islam, after visiting “a very old esoteric bookshop, Watkins in Covent Garden, and started reading about it”. On the cover of their 1975 album Pour Down Like Silver, he and Linda are dressed in turban and headscarf, and for the next three years the couple disappeared from the music scene to spend much of their time in Islamic communities in London and then Norfolk. “And it was a community, not a commune,” said Richard. “Commune implies sharing out the carrots!”\n\nLinda hated it. “Sufism had appealed to me, but the guy who ran it was bit of a tyrant. There was lots of praying and guilt, and women were so subservient.” Richard, who was attracted to Sufism by “the nobility of being … it seemed like the way human being should be,” agreed that it wasn’t ideal. “It was full of human foibles. People are lustful, jealous, God knows what. But then we visited a sheikh in Morocco and saw the other side of it. And it was all wonderful.”\n\nBy 1982 the marriage was at an end, but the deserved success of the Shoot Out the Lights album led to an infamous US tour. “I was living on booze and antidepressants,” Linda says. “I was so angry I was kicking and hitting Richard on stage. I trashed a dressing room, stole a car and got arrested. But it was good for my voice. I guess because I was so heartbroken it freed me up. The dysphonia wasn’t too bad in those days. At the end of the tour Richard rang and said: ‘Bruce Springsteen is male singer of the year and you are female singer of the year.’ Was it in Time or Rolling Stone? I think both. Like everything, good comes out of bad.”\n\nSo has she forgiven him? “I have. It was a bad time but – Jesus Christ – it was 40 years ago. Forget it!” But she is “kind of dreading the Albert Hall” because “as a performer you’d love to get up and wow the crowd, but I never know what will come out of my mouth. But I’ll do something. It’s going to be good.”\n\nAfter the split, Richard moved to California, remarried, and relaunched his career. “At aged 33, when I started singing solo, they treated me as a new artist and put me on college radio. So my audience in the States was 10 years younger than me, and it still is. And very, very slowly I did well. It was word of mouth. I toured America relentlessly, and I still do, and it’s still growing, which is amazing. Without having a hit record, more people come to shows now than they ever did.” As for the move to the east coast, “I was ready for a change. But being a performing musician I do 100 shows a year, and I’m away 150 days, so where you are based is less important.”\n\nDoes he have problems as a Muslim living in the States in the Trump era? “Trump has ramped up bigotry considerably. If you are not a white Christian, the implication is that you’re not a real American. It’s incredibly destructive, divisive, and harmful. We’ll see how it plays out – but the fact is that you still have more religious freedom in America or Britain than you do in a whole lot of Middle Eastern countries.”\n\nThompson is a cricket enthusiast – he cheerfully recalls his appearance on Test Match Special five years ago, singing 1952 Vincent Black Lightning – and he insists he “never wanted to be culturally absorbed by America. I can contribute more having a culturally British point of view.” Even in the midwest, he can still knock them for six."
