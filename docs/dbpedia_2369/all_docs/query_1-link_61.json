        "text": "In 1976, Island Records released (guitar, vocal) by Richard Thompson. Subtitled, ‘A Collection Of Unreleased and Rare Material, 1967-1972’, it is a pioneering compilation (pictured above) which was one of the first to respond to a fact that CD compilers would later take very much to their hearts – true fans are hungry for the obscure. Sales of bootlegs had more than demonstrated this at the start of the decade, though at the time the industry was keen to play this down, despite acknowledging their fears that bootlegs harmed artists’ sales and their own profits.\n\nStill regarded as a favourite album among Richard Thompson fans, (guitar, vocal) offered a wide overview of his talent, with previously unreleased songs, live versions of well-known material, radio sessions and out-takes. Only two of its thirteen tracks had been available before. One was taken directly from Fairport Convention’s debut album. The other was a remixed version of the B-side of their first single for Island, Meet On The Ledge: never reissued in its original form, Throwaway Street Puzzle (Island WIP 6047-b) remains a highly collectible Fairport and Thompson rarity.\n\nTwenty-three months before that single, in February 1968, the group’s debut single had been released on Track. If I Had A Ribbon Bow (Track 604020), featuring the vocals of Judy Dyble as well as a very out-of-character jazz guitar solo by Richard Thompson, was the group’s only release on the label. Its b side was a version of If (Stomp), co-written by Thompson and the group’s male vocalist Ian MacDonald (later known as Iain Matthews): although this was included on Fairport’s debut album, released in June of the same year, the original b-side version was a substantially different mix.\n\nBoth tracks have been included over the years on a number of compilations of Track material, but, despite several reissues of the debut album, it was not until the Island ReMasters reissue of 2003 that Ribbon Bow was available as part of its companion album. The single, which did not sell on first release, remains a collectors’ item, not only for fans of the musicians involved, but also for devotees of the short-lived Track label, whose artist roster included The Who, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, Thunderclap Newman, John’s Children (who included Marc Bolan) and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nIn 1975, Polydor (for whom Track was the “progressive pop” outlet) became the first major record company to acknowledge the growing fascination with rare and obscure releases via a budget priced compilation called simply Rare Tracks (Polydor Special 2482 274). Aside from The Fairport Convention single, the set included non-hits from Cream, The High Numbers (an early incarnation of The Who), Stu Brown’s Bluesology (with Elton John on piano), Soft Machine, Sly and The Family Stone, ‘Jethro Toe’ (a label misprint on the debut single of Jethro Tull), Alex Harvey and Jack Bruce. Not suprisingly, the LP itself has become very collectable.\n\n1969, the year which began with the release of Meet On The Ledge / Throwaway Street Puzzle, was literally an incredible one for Fairport Convention. Much documented elsewhere, it included the tragedy of the van crash which took the life of their drummer Martin Lamble and left both Richard Thompson and Ashley Hutchings in hospital.\n\nThe year also saw their first and only hit single (Si Tu Dois Partir) and a trilogy of albums which were both radical and groundbreaking: What We Did On Our Holidays, Unhalfbricking, and Liege & Lief regularly appear in best / essential definitive albums lists. For record label collectors, these albums saw the change of the Island LP label from its original transparent label name to black concentric ovals around the centre hole and finally to the iconic small case bold “i”. All used the distinctive pink label background.\n\nFairport’s repertoire was totally transformed over this period. As it began they still featured many covers of obscure American singles; the first flowering of Richard Thompson’s songwriting talent and the addition of Sandy Denny to the line up brought a new focus on original material; by applying the extended improvisation approach they had used on songs line Reno Nevada to the folk standard A Sailor’s Life they effectively invented English folk rock, which was the basis of the classic Liege & Lief. It was an astounding metamorphosis over a twelve month period and inevitably a lot of their repertoire never made it to disc.\n\nConsequently, in 1976, Ashley Hutchings privately issued Heyday, a fourteen track compilation of this material, drawn from recordings of BBC Radio sessions. Original copies of the limited edition cassette had a hand printed insert and hand-written cassette labels. The set was issued in modified form on vinyl (in 1987) and expanded form on CD (in 2002, following a straight reissue four years earlier). Not only is the original issue much prized for its rarity, it is also significant for being the very first compilation based on BBC sessions by a rock act – something which has since become effectively a genre in itself.\n\nAfter a year which had been traumatic in so many ways, the Fairport Convention which remained as the new decade began included only two musicians who had been there at the start of 1969 – Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol. The first album release by the new line up, Full House, became instantly collectable. Unhappy with his vocals on one track, Richard insisted on its removal at the eleventh hour. As a result, the very first copies of Island ILPS 9130 featured an overprint of a black box with gold lettering to hide the original tracklist and substitute the new one. Some copies without overprint were sent out to reviewers; a number of overprinted sleeves were sold before a corrected reprint replaced it. Both are now much sought after.\n\nThe original running order of the album was:\n\nSide One: Walk Awhile, Doctor of Physick, Dirty Linen, Sloth\n\nSide Two: Sir Patrick Spens, Flatback Caper, Poor Will & The Jolly Hangman, Flowers of the Forest.\n\nThe album as released – though a handful of white labels with the original tracks is known to exist – was as follows\n\nSide One: Walk Awhile, Dirty Linen, Sloth\n\nSide Two: Sir Patrick Spens, Flatback Caper, Doctor of Physick, Flowers of the Forest\n\nPoor Will & The Jolly Hangman has its own involved and somewhat chequered history of release, which I traced in the book Fairport UnConventional. A Thompson / Swarbrick original, it has remained a live favourite whenever performed at the group’s annual Cropredy reunions. The 2001 CD reissue restored the original running order and added other studio recordings from the era.\n\nOne of these, Now Be Thankful, was issued as a single in September 1970. It failed to make the charts and its rarity was enhanced by the fact that its b side was listed in the Guinness Book Of Records as ‘The Longest Song Title’ – Sir B. McKenzie’s Daughter’s Lament For The 77th Mounted Lancer’s Retreat From The Straits Of Loch Knombe, In The Year Of Our Lord 1727, On The Occasion Of The Announcement Of Her Marriage To The Laird Of Kinleakie. More commonly known as Sir B McKenzie, the track was a medley of tunes and had begun life as Tunes My Mother Taught Me; the medley, in true folk-style, was variable and may include as few as three or as many as six different tunes on any given occasion.\n\nThough he played the A side live with Fairport, including on the now-impossible-to-find video Live At Maidstone 1970 (a VHS release of a film shown as a b movie), by the time the single was released Richard Thompson had decided to leave Fairport Convention and launch his solo career.\n\nThe early seventies are a somewhat confused time in the Richard Thompson discography. He began them as a member of Fairport Convention, became a solo artist and after releasing his debut album formed a duo with his wife Linda which remained together for the rest of the decade.In addition, he undertook a lot of occasional session work and it is here that many of the gems sought by Thompson treasure hunters are to be found.\n\nMany are odd tracks on readily available albums, often by other artists in the Witchseason or Island rosters; these included Sandy Denny, Ashley Hutchings, John Martyn, Nick Drake, Matthews Southern Comfort and Mike Heron. These artists were likely to be known to Thompson fans and as a result their records, which sold in sensible numbers, made it into the appropriate collections. In almost every case, the albums have been reissued on CD.\n\nOther guest appearances were on more obscure releases. Hardcore fans still dream of tracking down a copy. The very first acknowledged Richard Thompson session was on the eponymous debut album by his friend Marc Ellington. Richard and Marc have remained close since the late sixties and Marc’s Scottish home is Richard’s venue of choice for Hogmanay. Although only obliquely credited on his 1969 debut (on Phillips), Richard was both nominally and musically much in evidence on Marc’s Rains/Reins Of Changes (B&C, 1971).\n\nB & C was a label which made notable attempts to capitalise on the folk-rock boom. Among its releases were albums by Steeleye Span, Shelagh MacDonald and Shirley Collins (Richard appeared on both the latter). Never a major commercial success, the label transformed into Pegasus on which many albums were reissued; meanwhile a lot of the back catalogue regularly cropped up in bargain bins.\n\nMarc Ellington’s album has become particularly collectible partly because of the session musicians (a mix of past and present members of both Fairport Convention and The Flying Burrito Brothers) but mainly because the original sleeve, a top opening envelope in soft textured unlaminated cardboard seemed guaranteed to rip when opened without extreme care or stored between two standard albums. Original copies with an intact unscuffed sleeve are now impossible to find. A third album Marc Time (pictured opposite page) was released in 1975 to tie in with a TV series: this not only featured Richard on guitar and backing vocals, it also included Shady Lies, an otherwise unavailable RT song. (RT collectors should be aware that he does not appear on Marc’s second album A Question of Roads.)\n\nHowever, few RT fans picked up on the album Dudu Pukwana And The Spears. Richard perhaps surprisingly is heard playing guitar on the 1969 South African release on Quality (LTJ 5232).\n\nOne might think that releases on the CBS label would have made greater impression. Not so Gary Farr’s 1970 album Strange Fruit (CBS 64138) even though mint copies fetch £200 plus today (see picture page 55). Aside from the title track, a chilling version of the Billie Holiday classic, the album consisted of his own songs. Farr had been making records since 1964, when he fronted The T-Bones, a group which included Keith Emerson on keyboards and Lee Jackson on bass. They went off to form The Nice, laying the foundations of prog-rock; he recast himself as a singer songwriter and for this relaunch of his career brought together Richard and members of Mighty Baby. The backing band would later form a key part of studio aggregation The Bunch. Members of Mighty Baby would later embrace Islam, shortly before Richard himself did so, and work with him on the so-called Islamic Tour, one of the least represented of all phases of Richard’s career.\n\nThe album is significant in Richard’s own development, therefore, but at the time was overlooked by fans and critics alike. The following year CBS 64395 – Mick Softley’s Streetsinger – is almost a second edition of the same story, even though it changes hands for around £50 today. It was the singer-songwriter’s third album and fared less well than his first two, despite an impressive array of session players including RT.\n\nTransatlantic Records provided another home for singer songwriters, most famously Ralph McTell. Richard appeared on TRA 298, Fantasies From A Corner Street by Harvey Andrews and Graham Cooper. This was released in 1975. He had previously played on Stefan Grossman’s Those Pleasant Days (1971) on the same label.\n\nOf all the major folk labels of the era, Leader and Trailer Records have become some of the most prized among collectors. Distributed by Transatlantic at the time, they have not enjoyed extensive reissue in any form, including CD, despite including many influential classics. Richard appeared on two of them: John Kirkpatrick’s Jump At The Sun (on which he is credited as Agnes Mirren), the start of a very long association between the two musicians, and Lal and Mike Waterson’s Bright Phoebus.\n\nLal and Mike, sister and brother, were known as members of The Watersons, famous for determinedly folkie unaccompanied harmony versions of traditional songs. Bright Phoebus was most definitely a folk rock album of their original material, a true contrast. Richard is heard on acoustic and electric lead guitar throughout, including some of his finest work, not least the guitar solo on the album’s title track. The sessions even yielded one out-take, Mole In A Hole, which became one of the few non-originals recorded by Richard himself.\n\nMuch prized by those who own a copy (and much sought after by those who don’t), the album was the first of many collaborations between Richard and members of the Waterson family: they provided backing vocals on one of his albums; he has played with Martin Carthy on several albums and was part of the band brought together for Norma Waterson’s two award winning CDs of non traditional songs.\n\nThen there is a third set of early 70’s session appearances where Richard appeared pseudonymously (most famously Al Stewart’s Love Chronicles whereon Richard is credited as Mavyn Prestwyck) or anonymously (such as The New Seekers’ New Colours).\n\nRichard has continued to remain a session guitarist of choice and to date has appeared on over 200 releases by other artists. These range from big selling mainstream releases by well known names on major labels (J J Cale, Gerry Rafferty, Crowded House and so on) to limited releases by names virtually unknown on labels so obscure that nowhere stocked them.\n\nOf all the session work which Richard undertook in the seventies – and this article highlights only some of the most collectible examples – the album which most RT fans are keenest to track down is Vanishing Trick on the highly obscure Tangent label. The work of many hands, the LP was a celebration of the writing of Mersey Poet Brian Patten. One side featured him reading poems; the other consisted of musical settings of some of his earlier work. Two tracks – Embroidered Butterflies and After Frost – featured Richard and Linda Thompson. The two tracks can be heard on Linda’s retrospective rarities collection Give Me A Sad Song, but few possess a copy of the sparsely distributed and little purchased album on which they first appeared.\n\nBy the eighties, Richard’s reputation had grown in such a way that his hard core fans were rapidly aware of his guest appearances. Albums by the likes of Loudon Wainwright III, Ralph McTell, Any Trouble, J J Cale and his old bandmates Ashley Hutchings, Dave Swarbrick and Fairport themselves became readily available and easy to find. The same was not true of albums like T-Bone Burnett’s Proof Through The Night (Side Effects, 1983), Folk Och Rackare’s Rack Bag (on the Swedish label Amalthea), Julian Dawson’s As Real As Disneyland (on German Polydor) or Studio Romantic by Saeko Suzuki (on Dear Heart in Japan). Even more obscure were a couple of cassette releases for folk labels in 1986 – Tam Reid’s King Of The Bothy Ballad Singers and Charlie Allen’s The Auld Folks On The Wa’ – released on Ross and Pedigree respectively.\n\nBut to return to Richard’s main career. In 1979, Chrysalis released Georgie On A Spree, (see page 55), a remake of 1975 album track, put out to tie in with the song’s use as a TV theme. Chrysalis also released a recording of the final night of The Rainbow, the London music venue, including a live version of Hokey Pokey. The release failed to catch the record buyers’ attention and has long been deleted.\n\nThe 1982 single (pictured opposite page) Don’t Renege On Our Love (Hannibal) has as its b side Living In Luxury; based on an old Everly Brothers song, the b side was a recording with which Richard was unhappy and it was withdrawn before it made the shops.\n\nContractual difficulties at the start of the eighties found Richard without a record deal (despite having a perfectly good completed album, whose saga merits an article in its own right). He used the occasion in 1981 to set up his own label, Elixir, whose sole release was a collection of instrumentals entitled Strict Tempo (pictured below). A hardcore fanbase ensured that the album, sold by mail order and with limited in-store availability, set a new record for the gap between release and profitability. Its rarity today stems not from limited sales at the time (overall it sold in excess of 7,000 copies) but from the fact that it sold to fans, very few of whom would ever be persuaded to part with an original copy. Later in his career, Richard would release a whole series of live CDs available at gigs and via mail order, the first couple of which have been deleted and therefore merit mention here.\n\nThe eighties saw Richard releasing albums on major record labels, first Polydor and then Capitol. In a vain attempt to create a hit, several singles drawn from these albums included live recordings which otherwise are not available, These are:-\n\nWhen the Spell is Broken – b side of You Don’t Say (1986 – issued to radio stations in the UK). Turning of the Tide – b side of Reckless Kind (1988). Pharoah and Can’t Win – b side of the 12 inch version of the same track (for the record the CD version included a live Jerusalem on the Jukebox). I Feel So Good – b side of Read About Love (1991). Now That I am Dead – on a 1991 EP on Capitol, a song otherwise unavailable by Richard at the time.\n\nA 1986 German promo only EP included otherwise unavailable live versions of Shoot Out The Lights, The Great Valerio and Don’t Tell Secrets. Its rarity value diminished when the EP became a bonus album with the German issue of his new LP. But true promos are clearly marked, and more valuable.\n\nWith the advent of the CD era, marked by the Capitol EP release mentioned above, where the vinyl version was clearly marketed as a version of a CD release, the issue of bonus tracks on both album and singles continued. As before, Richard failed to break through to the singles market, and as a result there are many stray tracks which collectors who did not get hold of them at the time try hard to track down. Richard was also a regular contributor to charity and tribute albums, starting with 1989’s Byrds tribute Time Between. In most cases, the tracks issued were unique, quite often specially recorded and would literally form a catalogue in their own right.\n\nA brief selection of these recordings would include The May Day Psalter, Les Flammes d’Enfer, Annihilation in Allah, Sandy Denny’s John The Gun, The Byrds’ Here Without You and Hickory Wind, Donovan’s Season Of The Witch and Lal Waterson’s Red Wine and Promises.\n\nA series of albums recorded at the Newport Folk Festival regularly included a Richard Thompson track, as did the various Mountain Stage CDs. Other albums to include RT live recordings came from German Festivals, and Dutch and US radio.\n\nTracking down such releases – and acquiring them before deletion – is now made much easier for fans by Richard’s official website Beesweb and the fansite Richard Thompson For Completists. Both sites provided valuable information for this article as did Ed Haber’s original Thompson discography one sheet, Patrick Humphries biography Strange Affair with discography by Colin Davis, and my own RT- The Life And Music Of Richard Thompson, part of the five CD compilation of previously unreleased recordings spanning Richard’s entire solo career."
