        "text": "Listening to Telling Me Lies from the Trio album (1987) always affects me greatly. Part of it is the tight harmony among Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris.\n\nThe song was the album’s second single, and it reached #3 on the US Billboard country singles charts. The recording was nominated for a Grammy award in 1988 for Country Song of the Year.\n\nThe message is painful:\n\nYou told me you needed my company\n\nAnd I believed in your flattering ways\n\nYou told me you needed me forever\n\nNearly gave you the rest of my days\n\nShould’ve seen you for what you are\n\nShould never have come back for more\n\nShould’ve locked up all my silver\n\nBrought the key right to your door\n\nThe song first appeared on Linda Thompson’s One Clear Moment album (1985), her first solo collection “after divorcing husband and former collaborator, Richard Thompson.” The track was written by Linda Thompson and Betsy Cook, as were most of the songs on the album, which many critics believed included many well-written songs, often marred by that era’s heavy-handed production.\n\nDon’t put your life in the hands of a man\n\nWith a face for every season\n\nDon’t waste your time in the arms of a man\n\nWho’s no stranger to treason\n\nListen to Telling Me Lies:\n\nLinda Thompson here\n\nDolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris here or here\n\nI cover my ears, I close my eyes\n\nStill hear your voice and it’s telling me lies\n\nTelling me lies\n\n***\n\nFor good measure, another 1980s female trio with tight harmonies, though a somewhat different style:\n\nYou work too hard to take this abuse\n\nBe on your guard jerks on the loose\n\nListen to Keep On Doing What You Do/ Jerks On The Loose – the Roches, written by by Terre and Suzzy Roche, from the Keep On Doing album (1982)"
