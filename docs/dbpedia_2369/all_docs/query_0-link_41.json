Regardless of subject, culture, or era, the requisite qualiﬁcations are the same: (1) challenge the status quo, (2) inﬂuence millions, and (3) impact history. Using these criteria, Greenwood Press introduces a new reference format and approach to popular culture. Spanning a wide range of subjects, volumes in the Greenwood Icons series provide students and general readers a port of entry into the most fascinating and inﬂuential topics of the day. Every title offers an in-depth look at approximately twenty-four iconic ﬁgures, each of which captures the essence of a broad subject. These icons typically embody a group of values, elicit strong reactions, reﬂect the essence of a particular time and place, and link different traditions and periods. Among those featured are artists and activists, superheroes and spies, inventors and athletes, the legends and mythmakers of entire generations. Yet icons can also come from unexpected places: as the heroine who transcends the pages of a novel or as the revolutionary idea that shatters our previously held beliefs. Whether people, places, or things, such icons serve as a bridge between the past and the present, the canonical and the contemporary. By focusing on icons central to popular culture, this series encourages students to appreciate cultural diversity and critically analyze issues of enduring signiﬁcance. Most important, these books are as entertaining as they are provocative. Is Disneyland a more inﬂuential icon of the American West than Las Vegas? How do ghosts and ghouls reﬂect our collective psyche? Is Barry Bonds an inspiring or deplorable icon of baseball? Designed to foster debate, the series serves as a unique resource that is ideal for paper writing or report purposes. Insightful, in-depth entries provide far more information than conventional reference articles but are less intimidating and more accessible than a book-length biography. The most revered and reviled icons of American and world history are brought to life with related\n\nx\n\nSeries Foreword\n\nsidebars, timelines, fact boxes, and quotations. Authoritative entries are accompanied by bibliographies, making these titles an ideal starting point for further research. Spanning a wide range of popular topics, including business, literature, civil rights, politics, music, and more, books in the series provide fresh insights for the student and popular reader into the power and inﬂuence of icons, a topic of as vital interest today as in any previous era.\n\nAcknowledgments This project would not have been possible without the literal, spiritual, and metaphorical help of many people. First and immediately, I need to thank my editors at Greenwood, Lindsay Claire and Kristi Ward, for whom no question was too small and for their editorial guidance and sharp insights. Fellow Greenwood author Chris Smith deserves thanks for recommending me for this project. An extension of gratitude goes to Christine Marra, whose keen eye and close attention to detail polished this manuscript to a spit-shine through its ﬁnal stages. Alexis Walker assisted early on with some sidebar research and writing. Abra Berkowitz, who worked with me as an independent study, needs special mention for her boundless enthusiasm, the old articles she excavated, her passionate questions and exclamatory notes in the margins, the YouTube videos of Joan Baez, and her attention and interest in this project long past the conﬁnes of receiving a grade. Her ability to relate to these women, many of whom are exponentially older than her own nineteen years, demonstrates that the appeal of these artists extends far beyond arbitrary designations like age. The interlibrary loan, circulation, and reference staffs of Skillman Library at Lafayette College worked tirelessly to track down obscure pieces of data and procure the many materials necessary to undertake a task of this scope. To them I say: Thank you, thank you, thank you. I have to thank my parents, Chuck and Susan, who immersed us in a disparate musical environment—Lambert Hendricks and Ross, Barbra Streisand, The Beatles, Cal Tjader, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, and the entire American songbook—which encouraged my curious approach to music and, later, cultural forms in general. My sister Christy offered levity just by being herself; I relied on her entertaining and reassuring responses to my Instant Messenger questions seeking gut-check reactions to a-ha insights throughout my writing. On a professional note, the work of Ellen Willis was an early and signiﬁcant inﬂuence on my thinking (and writing) about feminism, politics, and popular culture. I was blessed to have the opportunity to study with her as a graduate\n\nxii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nstudent at New York University, an experience that offered solace that I could possibly make a living writing about music and popular culture. She, along with Susie Linﬁeld, helped me through what then felt like somewhat inchoate responses to the cultural landscape. And the writing of Ann Powers illustrated continuity and gave me hope that women of another generation were still ﬁnding much to say—and doing so in artful, provocative ways—about women, music, pop culture, politics, and everything in between. Finally and most important, none of this would be possible or worthwhile without my husband John, the original, irreplaceable music maker in my life. Thank you, in this case, is an understatement.\n\nIntroduction What is an icon? What is popular music? What constitutes a female icon in popular music? These are loaded questions, brimming with complicated, discussion-inducing answers. When compiling the list for the twenty-four icons in this book, it was useful to start off by consulting the dictionary. But that move initially made things trickier, as the ﬁrst deﬁnition of the word indicates a pictorial representation, and the second deﬁnition involves the creation of a religious image used for devotional purposes. Although some of the icons in this book boast fans who are ardent and dedicated, that connotation does not satisfy, either. The third deﬁnition, “an object of uncritical devotion: idol,” brings us closer. This deﬁnition, though, seems to negate our ability to be discerning and discourages the use of subjectivity, which is delightfully, frustratingly, at the core of listening to and talking about music. Finally, the fourth deﬁnition, “emblem, symbol,” seems more open-ended and suitable to a wider range of musicians. Regardless of their differences (which we embrace), the women in this two-volume set symbolize a particular moment, aspect, quality, genre, emotion, or memory in the relatively short but extraordinarily diverse twentieth-century convention known as popular music. In the process of selecting candidates for this book, I discussed with my editors whether or not the artist in question has, during the course of her career, produced compelling material and demonstrated an essential star, or iconic, quality. Furthermore, we also looked at whether she exempliﬁes an outstanding level of artistic and/or commercial achievement. Artists such as Madonna, Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, and Tina Turner came to mind quickly—women whose grit and determination and pronounced, early ambition set them apart from their peers and catapulted them to international fame and multiplatinum sales. But beyond this stellar success, these women are true trailblazers who inﬂuenced many artists who followed—and in some cases also creatively deviated—from their footsteps. Reading the remarkable stories of others— such as Patsy Cline and Janis Joplin—that are comprised of much personal\n\nxiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nstruggle highlighted the inevitability of their success and underscored the sadness of their tragic, early passing. Cline and Joplin have become icons of country-pop crossover and blues-rock, respectively, and their discovery by younger generations of fans and artists via greatest hits collections and boxed sets attests to their powerful legacies. Admittedly, some of the artists we chose for this volume have not reached multiplatinum commercial sales—at least not yet. But that is not, nor should it be, a determining factor for inclusion; neither is it solely a marker of one’s relevance or importance. Such a fact, however, ought not discredit the impact and reach of those whose work means something very speciﬁc or captures the zeitgeist in some way. We simply cannot compare the monumental, unprecedented success of Dolly Parton or Madonna—who boast millions of albums sold worldwide—to that of Suzanne Vega, Liz Phair, or Patti Smith, for example. The music world would not be the same without the spare, sensitive, and socially conscious imagery in Suzanne Vega’s songwriting. Nor would the landscape of pop music in the late 1990s and onward be the same without risk-takers such as Liz Phair, who boldly tackled the male rock canon of the Rolling Stones on her debut Exile in Guyville. Nor would punk-pop be the same without Patti Smith, an unapologetic icon-worshipper herself, and her approach to music as performance art. Ironically, she is iconic herself, embodying a particular downtown–New York aesthetic sensibility. Vega showed other female artists that it was possible to combine the impulses of folk music and reach the masses. Phair’s work brought out the latent anger in her female listeners and suggested that it was perfectly justiﬁable for women to use bluntly honest sexual references and, when necessary, curse words in songwriting. And Smith, an androgynous artist with a capital A, inﬁltrated the world of Baudelaire and punk rock. Her path created a trajectory for those artists— male and female alike—who felt restricted by what they felt were arbitrary designations, such as gender, even as such artists remain cognizant to the ways in which it informs their process. Idiosyncratic artists such as these (and others found in these two volumes such as Joni Mitchell and Tori Amos) give us permission to have a larger—and necessary—conversation about art, feminism, politics, performance, image, and songwriting. We also took into consideration the formative impact these female performers had on other artists, whether that meant contemporaries or future generations. Many of the sidebars to the entries are devoted to some of those deserving female artists whose careers could not be overlooked because they showed a lineage to the women in this set. For example, the sidebar in the entry on Patsy Cline, a ﬁrecracker of a woman with a big, conﬁdent voice, focuses on the Dixie Chicks, whose crossover success in the pop world from country music and outspoken ways illustrate a direct link to Cline. The sidebars also enable an exploration of trends and moments in popular music as they pertain to these women. We are able to explore in detail, for example, Lilith Fair, a traveling concert full of female artists organized by\n\nIntroduction\n\nSarah McLachlan during three summers in the late 1990s. Its sellout success forced the music business to acknowledge not only the very real artistic power of these women but the very real and heretofore largely untapped commercial power of female audiences. Including Ani DiFranco in this set, an artist whose career trajectory was sharply rising during the 1990s, allowed us to explore and focus further on her staunchly independent ethos and her label, Righteous Babe Records. And at times, the subject matter of these sidebars dovetails across musical genres. Looking at Madonna in the context of the dawn of music videos reveals her shrewd understanding (and successful control) of her image as an early and enthusiastic adopter of MTV. Fifteen years later, Missy Elliott does something similar with image making in the context of hip-hop, by surprising and shocking fans and the hip-hop community through her own fearless fashion sense and creative restlessness that compels her to never create the same video—or costume—twice. Thus, by asking who we consider to be icons, we found ourselves thinking in adjectives rather than genres: creative, exemplary, intriguing, controversial, groundbreaking, singular, iconoclastic, savvy, feisty, and innovative. Ultimately, when considering these women, their decisions, their achievements, and, most important, their music had to feel necessary to the concept of popular music. Consequently, if they were essential to the evolution of popular music, they must have a home in these two volumes. In discussions with my editor Kristi Ward and editorial consultant Chris Smith, we tried to create a list of women who felt absolutely essential to our understanding of popular music. Because our approach permitted a generous deﬁnition, it logically followed that the conversation could include the early crossover success of country-pop singer Patsy Cline as much it included the multiplatinum R&B artist Mary J. Blige or the eccentric but engaging Tori Amos. This more encompassing approach was also something my editors felt was largely absent among shorter, less indepth women in rock books. Invariably, some readers may disagree with our choices or wonder why certain artists were omitted. As a two-volume set that is geared toward use by high school and college students, along with general readers and fans who are seeking a deeper perspective on what constitutes a female pop music icon, such conversation is welcome. Music critics have been constructively arguing about such ideas for years. Although not every reader may sit down and read the text from start to ﬁnish, those who do and those who read through a few chapters will likely encounter some thematic elements that unite these women. Furthermore, as I researched and read about these women, I began to uncover similarities, some of which were surprising, in their struggles, trajectories, backgrounds, or ideals. When examining the early years of artists such as Diana Ross, Dolly Parton, and Madonna, for example, it becomes clear that all three women possessed an unwavering ambition and unassailable sense of their own fame and musical destiny. Many share an initial early interest in other art forms like painting or dance, such as Joni Mitchell, Madonna, Ani DiFranco, Liz Phair,\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nand Suzanne Vega. Others, like Tina Turner and Emmylou Harris, discovered some of their hidden talents late in their careers; Turner found her voice when she became liberated from her difﬁcult marriage to Ike, and Harris, who has been a much sought-after guest vocalist, found her own voice by writing much more of her own material. Joplin, Turner, and Blige are united by the personal pain that has galvanized their music and performance, which then gave them a reason for triumph. Joni Mitchell and Carole King share the odd distinction of marriages that shaped their work, albeit in different ways. Despite her short marriage to Chuck Mitchell, Joni Mitchell retained his surname as she made a name for herself, and King gained early success with her husband, Gerry Gofﬁn, during the songwriting heyday of the early 1960s before striking out on her own later in the decade. For many of these women the 1960s was formative—either as immediate cultural participants (such as Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, or Janis Joplin, whose work broadened the possibilities for female singers and songwriters) or for those whose work bears the inﬂuence of the decade’s ideals. For example, many of these women have used their celebrity as a consciousness raiser in some way, shape, or form. Joan Baez made a career out of strongly weaving her beliefs into her songwriting and ﬁghting for causes she believed in and inﬂuenced generations of women; she calls the folk-rock duo the Indigo Girls her “young whipper-snappers” due to their shared impulses to make the world a better place through activism and the belief that folk music in particular is best suited for conveying socially conscious messages. Bonnie Raitt, a longsuffering artist whose heady, gutsy mix of blues, rock, and roots music took nearly twenty years to catch on with audiences, is a veteran supporter of nuclear disarmament and established the beneﬁt concerts called No Nukes to rally concern and cash for her ideals. Years later, this impulse was present when Chrissie Hynde, a vegetarian, found herself getting arrested at PETA demonstrations and Tori Amos created RAINN, an organization geared toward providing for women who have been victims of abuse. Through her music and her record label, Ani DiFranco embodies many of the 1960s ideals about making the world a better place, but she also infuses it with a punk rock, do-it-yourself impulse and blends in her own feminism and self-determinism to become the ultimate independent artist. Finally, a woman in the music business is situated in a traditionally maledominated industry, which can mean she is one woman ﬁghting against a larger system that often leaves her subjected to a process of decision making, image making, and money making that may be beyond her control. Refusing to be victim to what feminist ﬁlm theorist Laura Mulvey termed “the male gaze,” many of the icons here took the reins of their careers, called the shots, and tried to create their own paths on their own terms. Many of them played with, manipulated, and/or subverted the idea of what it meant to be a sex symbol. We see this with Debbie Harry, who gave her band the name Blondie as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the catcalls she would receive on the streets\n\nIntroduction\n\nof New York. She deliberately subverted the ideas of movie star glamour before Madonna had even moved to New York. Madonna made image reinvention her mission throughout her career. Liz Phair still shows a ﬂirtation with these ideas and expectations about female behavior even as her material reinvented itself for a larger, younger audience that was unburdened by her previous devil-may-care indie rock persona. Others show different approaches to this idea and have created new paradigms. The tough-and-tender Chrissie Hynde is essentially the Pretenders, but she feels most comfortable as front woman leading a group of men. With her ﬂaming red mane and scorching guitar skills, Bonnie Raitt often appears to be one of the guys, joking and getting along in a historically male-dominated ﬁeld—blues. And Joni Mitchell just did what she wanted, the way she wanted—confessional songwriting— but never stopped there. Throughout her career she has followed her own muse (much like Patti Smith) and always emerges as someone who anticipates a trend or explores a sound well in advance of the rest of mainstream American popular music. The number twenty-four initially seemed limiting, but it forced all of us involved to shape the content in a compelling, unique way. If the careers of these women are, to borrow a phrase from Tori Amos, “little earthquakes,” the women they’ve inﬂuenced are the aftershocks. Through these twenty-four icons we are permitted a glimpse at what came before them and what has followed. Based on what we’ve uncovered, we can speculate about what is yet to come for women in popular music. But because of the depth and breadth of biography and criticism these chapters encompass, we can now have a conversation that deepens their reach, makes plain their roots, and leaves us all rocking in their wake.\n\nxvii\n\nTimeline 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958\n\n1959\n\n1960\n\n1961\n\nPatsy Cline signs with Four-Star/Decca.

Melding her classical piano training, her curiosity about human nature, and an unconventional and occasionally arresting approach to songwriting and performance, Amos’s musical lineage traces itself to England’s Kate Bush for her otherworldly approach and Joni Mitchell because of the confessional nature of her lyrics. Much of Amos’s material is grounded in an examination of feminism and womanhood. Idiosyncratic, fearless, smart, and warm, Amos has an intensely loyal fan base and is surprisingly accessible to her fans. She is also well known for (and sometimes chided by critics because of) her exuberant, sensual approach to playing the piano. Fans were initially surprised by her early concerts, during which she frequently would be writhing, wriggling, and pounding away on the piano— redeﬁning the way in which women relate to musical instruments and reclaiming a little piece of pop music for herself. Known for her vivid imagination, a keen grasp of metaphor, and a tendency toward personiﬁcation—she refers to her songs as “my girls”—Amos constantly pushes, plays, and pokes at the boundaries we inhabit within ourselves, in our relationships to others, and in our world. Some have called her “perversely cryptic,” but Amos believes each song has its own life force, its own agenda, and its own mission. If you listen to her music long enough, you start to grasp the intricate inner logic at work. Almost every single one of Amos’s albums has at least gone gold except for three: a cover album, Strange Little Girls (2001); The Beekeeper (2005); and American Doll Posse (2007). Little Earthquakes (1992), Under the Pink (1994), Boys for Pele (1996), From the Choirgirl Hotel (1998), and To Venus and Back (1999) have all been certiﬁed platinum at least once. Additionally, three video collections, Little Earthquakes, The Complete Videos 1992–1998, and Welcome to Sunny Florida, are all certiﬁed gold. Amos has seen her albums achieve spots on a handful of different charts, including a number one slot for Little Earthquakes on the Heatseekers chart and a number one slot for To Venus and Back for Top Internet Albums. Nearly every other release placed in the Billboard 200; the thorny Boys for Pele even peaked at number two, and From the Choirgirl Hotel, number ﬁve. Her songs have made thirty appearances to date on various Billboard singles charts, from adult Top 40 to the Hot 100 to modern rock tracks to hot dance music/club play, which says as much about her wide appeal as it does the increasingly fragmented, diversiﬁed nature of the music culture of the 1990s. Amos has earned eight Grammy Award nominations for not only her music but also for the packaging of one release: a limited edition of Scarlet’s Walk. Strange Little Girls received a nomination for Best Female Rock Performance for “Strange Little Girl” and a nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance. Boys for Pele also gained her a nomination for Best Alternative Music\n\nTori Amos\n\nPerformance. In 1999, From the Choirgirl Hotel earned her a nomination for Best Alternative Music Performance and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the song “Raspberry Swirl.” To Venus and Back also earned two nominations in 2000: one for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for “Bliss” and one for Best Alternative Music Performance. Despite these accolades, she has yet to win a Grammy. One of Amos’s most striking characteristics is her extreme approachability and warmth. She takes seriously her relationship to her audience and her fans and attempts to encourage them to ﬁnd their own creative calling (Amos and Powers 2005, 8). Many fans, taking solace from the difﬁcult stories her songs have told—especially the a capella “Me and a Gun,” told from the perspective of a woman being raped—have written her letters and have visited her backstage, seeking counsel and telling her how much her music has been a comfort. In fact, one such conversation was with a fourteen-year-old girl who came backstage after a concert to have a cup of tea with Amos. The girl begged her to take her on tour with her, and Amos asked why. The girl revealed, “when I get home I will be raped by my stepfather like I was last night and will be tomorrow. I have been raped for seven years” (Bell 1999). In June 1994 Amos co-founded the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN). The network is comprised of a toll-free phone number that connects callers with their local rape crisis center. Since its inception, the nonproﬁt organization, which is the largest anti–sexual assault organization in the United States, has assisted more than 900,000 people. Its mission is to assist victims of sexual assault and ensure that rapists are brought to justice. The organization has forged many relationships with community outreach organizations and entertainers to spread its message at concerts, on college campuses, and in communities. The commercial and critical success of Tori Amos is no small matter; it has paved the way for and inspired a whole generation of female singer/songwriters, granting them the right to work out their own demons and thoughts on the piano. Many of these women share Amos’s penchants for thorny, introspective, surprising material. Most notably, Amos has inﬂuenced and made possible the work of Fiona Apple, Paula Cole, Nellie McKay, Regina Spektor, Leona Naess, Kate Earl, Sonya Kitchell, and to some degree Norah Jones (see sidebar). By the time Scarlet’s Walk was released in 2002, Amos’s commercial popularity had started to fade slightly, although she currently enjoys a loyal cult following around the world and her tours regularly sell out. Her concerts are legendary, intense affairs, noted for their constantly changing set lists, thus inspiring already devoted fans to attend multiple performances. Amos believes that each city, each new location, has its own energy; this helps keep her live performances fresh and unique. She feels moved to respond to many different factors, from mundane items such as the news of the day in a particular city and the time of year to musical considerations such as creating seamless transitions, allowing for different instrumentation (organ, Rhodes, and the piano, for example), and establishing an emotional momentum for the audience.\n\n3\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\n4\n\nA Legion of (Occasionally) Long-Haired Females Takes Its Place at the Piano Tori Amos has become known for her eccentricities, her classical training, and her intensely personal and imaginative songwriting. She has inspired a diverse generation of piano-playing, introspective female songwriters: the classically trained Russian émigré Regina Spektor; the wounded, engaging Fiona Apple; the ethereal Leona Naess; the folky-electronica Beth Orton; and even R&B pianist sensation Alicia Keys. Apple shares with Amos the sultry, sullen aspects of performance. Her multiplatinum 1996 debut Tidal created several successful singles: The knowing “Shadowboxer” and the bluesy “Criminal,” which starts with the lyric, “I’ve been a bad bad girl/I’ve been careless with a delicate man.” Like Amos’s Little Earthquakes, Tidal took critics by storm for its emotional depth and Apple’s virtuoso playing. Tidal and her 1999 follow-up When the Pawn . . . feature heavy contributions by the unconventional producer Jon Brion, known for lurching, nearly kaleidoscopic arrangements. In three albums over nine years, Apple has demonstrated a storyteller’s eye for detail and metaphor. Her songwriting has become more surprising and textured, especially on 2005’s Extraordinary Machine. Although Spektor has released only two albums via major labels—2004’s Soviet Kitsch and 2006’s Begin to Hope—she is also a critical favorite. Spektor shares with Amos a classical background, a lively percussive approach, and an elastic vocal style. Artsy like Amos, Spektor’s compositions often are sprawling numbers filled with her singing world-weary lyrics in a combination of English, French, and Russian. On Begin to Hope, Spektor added electric guitars and a drum kit and used her voice for percussive flourishes, especially on the engaging ode to relationship foolishness “Fidelity.” Begin to Hope poises her for a breakthrough; it has sold nearly 750,000 copies worldwide and spent five straight weeks at number one on the Billboard New Artist chart.\n\nEARLY YEARS Tori Amos was born in Newton, North Carolina, in 1963 as Myra Ellen Amos, daughter of Edison Amos, a Methodist minister, and Mary Ellen Amos, a schoolteacher. Her family moved to Baltimore when she was two, and as a child, Amos was intellectually and musically precocious, always asking questions of her elders. She recalls her earliest musical memory as trying to get herself up on the piano stool at the age of about two and a half. By the age of four, she was playing piano and singing in the church choir; her father served as the pastor of a large church in Baltimore. Her parents, especially her father, encouraged this budding talent, and Amos started taking piano lessons on a scholarship at Baltimore’s Peabody Conservatory at Johns Hopkins University\n\nTori Amos\n\nfrom 1968 to 1974. During her time at Peabody it eventually became apparent that she could play well by ear but that reading music was much more difﬁcult for her. The childhood she describes in her autobiography seems characterized by open intellectual discussion and debate at the dinner table regarding religion, politics, and other topics. Her parents, both educators by training though her mother stopped working to raise Amos and her older siblings Michael and Marie, created an environment where intelligent inquisition could ﬂourish. Both of her parents had an equal, albeit different, inﬂuence on her as an artist, a person, and a feminist. As an adult, Amos reports being impressed by her father’s humanitarian bent and his ability to minister to people in their time of need; it can be argued that much of what Amos does with her music is similar, because her songwriting often tackles difﬁcult material and crosses social taboos. He came from a Scots-Irish background. However, her mother’s side of the family—the Cherokee side—really impacted her life and her imagination. Amos was extremely close with her maternal grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, whom she called Poppa and who passed away when she was nine and a half. In the summertime she would spend time at his home in North Carolina, where he would regale her with stories of her ancestors. His Southern colloquialisms, his Eastern Cherokee heritage, his gift for speaking in quaint metaphors, and his belief that all living things contained some special, intrinsic knowledge made an indelible impression on her during her formative years. He would also urge her to pay attention to the powerful stories of her ancestors. She learned, for instance, the Native American story of the Corn Mother and her reverence for what the Earth can provide. Amos remembers being impressed, too, with her Poppa’s perfect pitch; she recalls in her coauthored biography Piece by Piece many days when his rich tenor voice sang her to sleep. He told her stories of her ancestors, in particular the grandmother who raised him, Margaret Little, and whom he described as a ﬁerce, shrewd woman who survived the Trail of Tears by carefully wrapping and burying dry goods, food, and necessities in a white Christian graveyard. This strategy enabled her to evade the ransacking and pillaging of “the Bluecoats” because she knew that they, Christians themselves, would not attack a Christian burial ground. Amos’s paternal grandmother also held an important role in her life but not because the two got along well. Instead, she served as a catalyst for Amos to scrutinize her own beliefs more closely. An ordained Christian minister, missionary, and teacher, Addie Allen Amos (called Grandma) possessed a strict, unwavering interpretation of the Bible and was steadfast in her approach to serving as Amos’s grandmother and moral-checker. Amos refers to her as a “shame inducer” and was constantly falling out of favor and made to feel guilty for asking questions and playing music. Amos recalls an occasion where her Grandma punished her by “trying to pray the fear of Jesus into me” because she “talked out of line.” Amos felt she\n\n5\n\n6\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\nneeded to try to understand why her grandmother seemed so destructive (Amos and Powers 2005, 36). In Piece by Piece she notes that her ancestors from her father’s Irish side had been weavers, and Amos took this as her ﬁrst entry point to try to understand the woman’s control issues and how fear can force people to believe something. Amos says she decided she would “weave” herself into her grandmother’s mindset to understand her and ultimately show mercy on her (Amos and Powers 2005, 36). Perhaps what was most disappointing to Amos was the fact that her grandmother had received a college education in the 1920s, something unusual for a young woman at that time. “She was masquerading as a feminist while jailing the Feminine,” she says. Encountering such hypocrisy—or seeming contradiction— made a lasting impression on Amos. Still, she sagely reﬂects on her Grandma’s ways, saying that she recognized that Amos was different, which enabled her to understand herself as a child (Amos and Powers 2005, 36–37). Irrespective of her Grandma’s branding of her, Amos certainly was aware from a very young age that she was different. Not only her talent marked her, but her sensibility did too. She writes, “I was born a feminist. And then, at age ﬁve, when my strict Christian grandmother punished me, I realized, I’m not penetrating here. I’m just pissing people off. So I had to ﬁnd another way to penetrate” (12). But like almost every experience, Amos was able to learn something important from these negative encounters, and put those revelations to constructive creative and personal use. And as any budding songwriter would agree, music became an escape, a safe haven, and a wellspring of good energy. As a result of her grandmother’s inﬂuence, Amos realized something important. “I never would let anyone have power . . . that’s when I started writing songs that other people couldn’t walk into, and I discovered my creative spark” (Amos and Powers 2005, 41). Indeed, her family unknowingly helped lay the groundwork to create a complex, thoughtful, spiritual tapestry that is, admittedly, often oblique. This revelation from Amos sheds light on her songwriting and explains why her music often sounds to listeners like something more than a sophisticated metaphor: a puzzle, a secret language, an enigma. Her songs retain that quality to this day. The way in which Amos would explore her ideas was made more complicated, and arguably more interesting, by her burgeoning sense of inquisitiveness about patriarchy, religion, and personal sacriﬁces. Of particular interest was her mother, whom Amos says played the part of the perfect wife at church functions (41). Growing up, Amos had trouble reconciling this smart, progressive woman in private with the public submissive, docile persona. As Amos got older and was able to converse with her mother about this, she began to understand how women can contain multitudes. And this, naturally, ﬁltered into her music. Despite any perceived failings, Amos’s mother was still a strong role model. She would read to her daughter nearly every day, starting, of course, with children’s books but quickly moving on to more challenging texts. Her mother\n\nTori Amos\n\n7\n\nwould read some of her own favorite poems and short stories from writers such as Robert Browning, Edgar Over a lifetime of learning to Allen Poe, and William Faulkner. Mary Ellen Amos compose, Tori Amos has was a major in literature in college, which she attended perfected her own methods for for two years before she left school and married Edi- transforming raw creative son. Amos describes her father as particularly encour- material into art. Her process aging of her career and as someone who believed in takes her from preliminary, and supported civil rights and the idea that women inspirational wanderings should be educated. Additionally, Amos credits her throughout the world and mother’s extensive record collection and her older within her well-stocked library brother Michael’s music as early inﬂuences; he to the calm space of her brought home the Beatles’ album Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely workroom and then into the Hearts Club Band when she was a child. Growing up surrounded by both the written and oral recording studio, where she traditions of extended family, Amos says simply, “My leads her small crew of mother gave me the text and my father gave me theol- collaborators in realizing her ogy” (Amos and Powers 2005, 3). Her parents have compositions. —Ann Powers, music journalist remained important throughout her career. Despite the and biographer at times shockingly frank nature of her songs and their potential to offend, she and her parents have conversations about her music. In 1994, Edison Amos told a reporter for Washington Magazine, “We love her songs. We don’t always agree with everything she writes and says. But when she writes about God, she writes about how images of God are so extreme, and that males made the rules of religion and left women out” (Dalphonse 1994). Around age eleven or twelve, Amos had started asking teachers at the Peabody Conservatory—who were training her classically—about John Lennon and Paul McCartney. She was already interested in crossing boundaries, mixing genres, and creating something new with music. She wanted to know why the students were not permitted to learn and practice the music of these artists and why there was a separation between classical and popular music. Amos became particularly enamored with Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin and Elton John. She recalls her father coming home from meetings with Christian fathers, remarking that no one knew what to do about Led Zeppelin; no Christian father wanted the band’s records in the house. Because she had difﬁculty reading music and instead played by ear, she was reportedly kicked out of Peabody at age eleven. Undeterred, Amos continued her musical education in other venues. By the time she was fourteen, her father got her gigs playing standards several nights a week at hotels and Georgetown piano bars, including Mr. Henry’s, which had a primarily gay clientele. Although some family friends raised an eyebrow at a minister’s daughter playing at a gay bar, her father, ever tolerant and wise, knew that she would be left alone there. Performing cover tunes gave her experience and an opportunity to learn something new.\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\n8\n\nAmos used her middle name, Ellen, growing up, but spent much time while performing trying out other names for herself. The process of naming herself was an empowering step toward independence, especially because she shares elements of her name with her mother (Mary Ellen) and sister (Marie Allen). Because the name was prescribed to her, it did not feel unique; she felt limited. Finally, at age seventeen, the boyfriend of a friend of hers suggested the name Tori (Amos and Powers 2005, 53). It seemed to ﬁt: She liked its cadence and liked that it was part of other words—conservatory, victory, and many others. Thus, a new name gave her new potential, new opportunities, and the promise of personal growth and reinvention, as well as a reintegration of the various selves that were ﬁghting—and would continue to do so—to gain a voice and power, in her music.\n\nCAREER PATH Though her relationship with her parents—especially her father—was close, like any rebellious teenager who wanted to make music, Amos knew that she had to ﬁnd her own voice and forge her own path. Despite the fact that she was earning her own money playing and singing she was still living at home, which meant she had to live with her father’s watchful eyes and strict curfews. Amos left Baltimore for Los Angeles in 1984 at the age of twenty-one, prompted by a friend (Stephen Himmelfarb), who left Washington, DC, for North Hollywood to become a sound engineer. For Amos, the departure amounted to something much more than just a stereotypical coming-of-age story. She had grown up with numerous stories of her ancestors and experienced the judgment of her strictly religious grandmother, so for her it was more a matter of ﬁnding her place in this family long history. The stories that had inhabited her were slowly beginning to itch to be told. Ironically, religion served as a wellspring of inspiration as Amos tried to reconcile dogma with reality and feminism with religion’s historic subjugation of women. After she moved to Los Angeles, where she lived in an apartment behind a Methodist church, Amos began to meet with A&R executives who kept telling her that “this piano girl thing is dead.” They did not think that her particular talents would appeal to listeners and that she might be too much of a retread of successful artists who had become prominent in the 1970s such as Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush, to whom Amos, ironically, would ultimately be compared. However, Amos managed to sign a six-record deal with Atlantic Records in 1987. Although she felt that what she was doing was not working—the executives did not have faith in her style—she swallowed her pride and did as instructed. The end result was an album (and band) called Y Kant Tori Read, released in 1988. The album was a cross between pop and metal,\n\nTori Amos\n\nwith Amos depicted on the cover wearing black, wielding a sword, with her scarlet hair teased out wildly. Titled as a self-deprecating nod to her inability to read music, this ﬁrst effort was a dismal failure—it sold very few copies and gained little airplay on radio. She recalls in her autobiography that at that time in the music business in California, either the rock chick or the folk poet worked. Clearly, the “Record Company Cheeses” (as she refers to them) felt that rock chick would work better. Somehow, the label did not drop her despite this initial misstep even though Amos had had a hand in writing nearly all of the sixteen tracks on the album. Y Kant Tori Read is regarded by fans who have rediscovered it as somewhat cheesy, corporate, and shallow—in other words, the antithesis of a Tori Amos album. Although hindsight can provide much insight and perspective about one’s life, Amos is especially philosophical about this time period. She told Billboard magazine in 1992, “Every place you land in life has a reason and lesson . . . I think that period of time was partially a means of dealing with sexual repression I experienced when I was growing up” (Flick 1992). Additionally, Amos says that it “took a while to recover and reintegrate” not only after the failure of Y Kant Tori Read but also the experience of producing a result other people wanted rather than something in which she deeply believed herself. In her autobiography, she writes, “By the time I ﬁnally got to make Little Earthquakes, I made a conscious decision not to be objectiﬁed here. My material had to be about the content . . . they couldn’t come between me and my piano” (Amos and Powers 2005, 74). And so, by 1990 she had started writing her haunting, confessional story-songs, visceral in their imagery and marked by the myths, stories, and legends inspired by her own family’s method of storytelling. Breaking Through: The First Few Albums The four years between the releases of Y Kant Tori Read and Little Earthquakes were well spent but difﬁcult. Amos recorded a batch of songs designed to be released following the commercial failure of Y Kant Tori Read, but those did not see the light of day—at least not in that incarnation. She went back into the studio and this time recorded with producer Eric Rosse and reworked the material. Despite the fact that her label, Atlantic, had misgivings about releasing an album of a woman playing the piano, Doug Morris, CEO of Atlantic, stuck by her and encouraged her to be herself, essentially, in her songwriting. Limited by the perspective and tired of the vibe of Los Angeles, Amos decided she needed a change of scenery. Knowing that breaking through in America would be tricky because of the large, diverse market and because her music was eclectic, Morris ingeniously decided to send Amos to England to work on the songs and perform in London in the clubs and for music critics.\n\n9\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\n10\n\nIt was a successful move by all accounts, and her album gained raves from top British music publications, including Q. The nineteenth-century feminist writer Virginia Woolf wrote about the need for women to ﬁnd their own space for creativity and thinking in her groundbreaking book A Room of One’s Own. Little Earthquakes, released in 1992, advocates a similar philosophy. The twelve songs are a collective clarion call for women to —drummer Matt Chamberlain heal themselves, live for themselves, claim their rights to create, and ﬁnd their own voices. But the songs are not all introspective and quiet—instead, Amos charts anger, disappointment, frustration, shame, and naked aggression with a full range of instruments at her disposal, from her signature Bösendorfer piano to electric guitars, cello, haunting vocal tracks ﬂoating behind her own, and even the suggestive crack of a whip. Some of the tracks were co-written with producer (and then-boyfriend) Eric Rosse. In “Crucify,” which leads off the album, Amos uses the chorus to suggest the idea of cruciﬁxion as a means by which women defeat their own best interests and must push past self-doubt to ﬁnd strength. “Crucify” was only the beginning of religious themes that would naturally surface in her songwriting. In the chorus of the cello-tinged “Girl,” Amos sings “she’s been everybody else’s girl/Maybe one day she’ll be her own.” No song suggests this better than “Silent All These Years,” which was one of the album’s two ofﬁcial singles. In the course of ﬁve minutes, Amos creates an evocative portrait of a narrator seeking to ﬁnd herself, ﬁnd love, and literally ﬁnd her voice: “sometimes I hear my voice and it’s been here/silent all these years.” The penultimate song, “Me and a Gun,” tells the story of rape from the point of view of a woman experiencing it. It is perhaps one of her more controversial songs, difﬁcult to listen to because of its bracing honesty and descriptive details, as the narrator invokes a prayer as her body is violated. As a ﬂash point for conversation, the song garnered much attention, possibly more than any of her other songs to date, because it was instrumental in providing an immediate emotional connection with fans who had experienced the same thing. In short, Amos gave voice to sexual assault, which enabled others to ﬁnd their own voice and speak of similar experiences. “I got a lot of letters and heard so many, many stories from fans who were going through situations of rape and abuse; everything from they were at a party and someone raped them to people being abused by someone in their home,” Amos told Billboard (1999). The experience led her to found RAINN. When it was released, the aptly named Little Earthquakes sent shockwaves throughout the music industry and garnered critical acclaim. Her success made it more likely for deejays to play two female artists in a row, a practice that before her success was more or less unheard of on commercial radio\n\nI just find different things every time we play a song. She likes that, which is great for us. She reacts to the rhythmic choices I make as if it were a jazz gig . . . I feel completely satisfied at the end of a gig. I feel I’ve played some music.\n\nTori Amos\n\nstations. Amos told Billboard magazine after the release of Little Earthquakes she considers it a “moment in time when I looked at things I hadn’t ever before. That record was like a ﬁrst kiss. It started a discovery process that never stops” (Flick 1992). From a marketing point of view, Amos boggled the minds of the industry because her music did not neatly ﬁt into one category or another. Initially Amos garnered comparisons to predecessors such as Laura Nyro, Joni Mitchell, and Kate Bush. However, her reach was more diverse because her work was so different and her success on various Billboard types of charts throughout her career exempliﬁes this point. Little Earthquakes barely scratched the surface of Amos’s ultimate capability as a songwriter, but it provided good clues: simple, piano-driven songs alternating with complex, dramatic, orchestrated songs. Doug Morris told the Washington Post, “We’re stretching boundaries with her. . . . These songs are very provocative. She’s on her journey” (Harrington 1992). When it came time to promote her second album Under the Pink in 1994, label executives sent the single “God” to alternative, college, and album alternative radio format stations. The album, on the whole, is not as immediately startling as its predecessor, but it is a logical progression wherein Amos begins to dig more deeply beyond the surface of what she had begun to uncover in Little Earthquakes. The album was recorded in a hacienda in New Mexico with co-producer Eric Rosse. Still, despite its deeper digging, Amos wrote that she was still very much a fragmented woman who had not yet found a way to integrate those separated selves. She said the tour was long and “the compartmentalization process within me had gotten worse and worse” (Amos and Powers 2005, 78). She acknowledged that the fact that she was compartmentalizing herself was useful and served a purpose, to perhaps allow a singular focus on the road, but she observed it could also be destructive. Amos realized that she needed to acknowledge all the seemingly disparate parts of her personality (78). The fragmentation stemmed literally from the events in her life—the relationship between Amos and producer Eric Rosse broke up during the tour. The album’s ﬁrst single, “God,” humorously but effectively imagines the narrator as what Amos describes in Piece by Piece as “Ms. God” or “God’s lover.” With a screechy guitar, a synthetic drum beat, and other rhythmic ﬂourishes, the song possesses that telltale rolling, rhythmic structure that can be found in many of her later songs, anchored by her soulful playing. In the song, Amos asks in the verse “God sometimes you just don’t come through/Do you need a woman to look after you?” Again, the structure is atypical—Amos does not save the name of the song for the refrain—she gets right down to business from the ﬁrst word of the song in a direct address. The metaphors she was creating on Under the Pink started to become more involved, but somehow Amos was still accessible. One might consider the philosophical “Pretty Good Year” a paean to the success of her solo debut. The contemplative “Baker Baker” uses tropes of a nursery rhyme to liken a\n\n11\n\n12\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\nrelationship’s process to making a cake. The oddly titled “Cornﬂake Girl,” Amos has said, was inspired by an Alice Walker novel about female circumcision called Possessing the Secret of Joy. Angered by the ways in which women betray each other, she wrote the song and set up two camps— cornﬂake girl (which could be read as white) and raisin (African American) girls. In “The Waitress,” which starts off quietly but tensely, the narrator states that she wants to “kill this waitress,” only to crescendo in the chorus, with Amos practically shrieking “but I believe in peace, bitch.” Amos’s ability to quickly convey complexity—often a duality—of thought, in this case female jealousy, consistently surprises. Amos tackled another taboo, masturbation, in the tinkling, piano-based “Icicle” and linked it with religion in one swift line: “And when they say take of his body/I think I’ll take of mine instead.” Under the Pink explored what was beyond the surface, lurking underneath the exterior of things, the pinkness, the newness, and the vulnerability of the top layer of skin, for example. In its ﬁrst two weeks of release, it sold 113,000 copies; in contrast, Little Earthquakes sold 2200 copies in that same time frame, according to SoundScan. Furthermore, Amos had built a momentum with her ﬁrst record and the success of Under the Pink, which received platinum status in November 1994, undoubtedly helped Little Earthquakes’s sales, which received platinum status just two months later. Amos’s third album, Boys for Pele, feels the most impenetrable of all her releases to date; the songs are dark and often move in unexpected directions. Named for the Hawaiian ﬁre goddess (for whom a volcano is named in Hawaii), the album’s eighteen tracks comprise some of Amos’s more elaborately abstract and largely piano-based compositions. Few artists would be so bold as to put a six-minute song ﬁrst to lead off an album, but Amos did so with the spare and haunting “Horses.” She calls Boys for Pele “a woman’s journey into the hidden parts of the feminine unconscious” (Reece 1996). Fittingly, given her preoccupations and background, it was recorded in a church in Ireland. In the eyes of some critics, however, Boys for Pele further cemented her image as a strange, unpredictable musician, especially because of the artwork and photography that accompanied the release: Amos is sitting and staring straight at the camera as a pig suckles her breast. The album, regardless of its perceived impenetrability, remains a fan favorite, but it polarized critics. Boys lacks the immediacy and intimacy of her ﬁrst two releases in exchange for a more difﬁcult engagement with the issues of darkness, light, and anger she was wrestling with during the album’s creation. Adding to Boys for Pele’s thorniness, the songs take unexpected leaps and moves in subject matter, instrumentation, and the use of her voice. The percussion-heavy “Professional Widow” uses harpsichord, and the middle section suddenly stops and veers into some light, deft piano playing before returning to heaviness. In this song, Amos sings about death—the woman in\n\nTori Amos\n\nthe song wants to convince her man to kill himself so she does not leave any trace of guilt. Amos also began to really use her own voice as an instrument of its own merit—especially in the album’s single “Caught A Lite Sneeze,” in which she wraps her voice around syllables and a melody in the most surprising way, just a few hairs short of the tempo of the song, but never completely at odds with its rhythm. “Hey Jupiter,” situated in the middle of the album, marks a turning point for the narrator of the songs. “She knows the way she has looked at relationships with men and put them on a pedestal is over. There’s a sense of incredible loss because I knew that I would never be able to see the same way again. It’s freeing, and [yet] there’s a sense of grieving with that” (Cohen 1996). What’s interesting to note, however, is that despite any perceived impenetrability or difﬁcult or odd nature of some of the songs, the record sales did not initially indicate any dismissal by fans. In fact, Boys for Pele sold 170,000 copies in its opening week. “I didn’t change what I do. I actually took it further, and people are opening up to it,” she told Billboard after its release. The record went platinum by late August 1996, indicating that her fans were indeed open to her creative whims. Responding to Tragedy, Both Personal and Political By the time her fourth album From the Choirgirl Hotel came out in the spring of 1998, many fans probably knew that Amos was fond of calling her songs “my girls” as if they were her daughters. But there was something behind what may have appeared simply as a silly, whimsical classiﬁcation: Amos had suffered a miscarriage before she started work on this album, and most certainly felt the child was a girl. Music helped her work through her grief and pain; she says at one point in Pieces that she wanted to bring the child back. Instead, she realized she had to make the songs of Choirgirl her own; that they were her own sonic creations. It makes sense, then, that Choirgirl represented a true turning point for her as a songwriter. Amos started to tackle bigger themes because her life was presenting her with bigger challenges. Consequently, the album took on a fuller sound that was more like that of a modern rock band. The addition of drum loops and other electronic embellishments added a heaviness and new sonic textures, as did multiple and at times overlapping vocal tracks. However, singles such as “Spark,” the album’s ﬁrst track, still exude a feel that can be found in all of her successful singles—a loping, looping, rollicking sensibility and a chorus that ambles and climbs with acrobatic vocals, all of which resolves itself by the song’s end. The intimate, difﬁcult nature of some of the content of the songs, though, did yield some accessible emotional entry points for listeners. Additionally, they were more tuneful than the classically oriented compositions from Boys. On Choirgirl, too, her biting, wicked sense of humor started to emerge.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\nFor example, she told Rolling Stone magazine, “Songs started to come, and they showed me different ways of feeling and expressing, ways that surprised me. ‘Playboy Mommy’ dealt with my feelings of rejection—‘Wasn’t I enough to be your mother, didn’t you want me? Well, don’t come, then. Go choose some little right-wing Christian for your mother.’ It’s a human response” (Daly 1998). Unfortunately, Amos would suffer through two more miscarriages in the next two years by the time she was touring in support of To Venus and Back, a double album released in September 1999. The title pays homage to Venus, the goddess of love, but (according to Amos) in a more compassionate way, as Amos says most women perceive Venus as permission to be narcissistic. Amos sought the more benevolent, healing aspects of the planet Venus’s mythical inﬂuence, responding to events in her personal life and in the music business where there was too much aggression—which she likens astrologically to Mars—especially in rap music. Despite the hardship and emotional upheaval wrought by the miscarriages, Amos said that when she was working on Choirgirl and also Venus, “I was home.” Her selves were more integrated. “If your human woman doesn’t catch up with what’s happening in the song world, then you can’t imprint this knowledge and thread it into your living tapestry” (Amos and Powers 2005, 119). With Venus, that tapestry was even more deeply embedded in electronica with some otherworldly inﬂuences, as heard in the single “Bliss,” with its rambling chorus, and the mid-tempo, keyboard-heavy song “Concertina.” However, there are moments of straightforward, piano-based narratives, such as the single “1000 Oceans.” The ﬁrst album, which she dubbed “Venus orbiting” is comprised of eleven new songs and the second, “Still orbiting,” takes its material from live performances recorded in 1998. All Music Guide called the album “her most cohesive work since Under the Pink.” Although the album eventually went platinum along with the three tracks that sold as singles, it became her ﬁrst album to not debut in the Top 10 UK chart—a signiﬁcant lapse, considering her longstanding success in that market. The single “Bliss” also garnered considerably less radio play than her previous albums and peaked at ninety-one on the Billboard Hot 100. Amos ﬁnally became pregnant successfully and decided to listen to her body and take some time off while she was pregnant with her daughter Natashya. Because she only had one album left to satisfy her contract with Atlantic, she decided to release a collection of covers of songs by male songwriters and singers, rendered from a female perspective. She called the album Strange Little Girls. It was another way she could pay homage to Venus. Notable covers included songs by Slayer, Tom Waits, The Beatles, Neil Young, Depeche Mode, and Eminem. She did not work, per se, during her pregnancy and she did not tour, but the songs she wrote for what would become 2002’s Scarlet’s Walk began to take root as she spent time in her beach house in Florida. As her ﬁrst release for Epic\n\nTori Amos\n\n15\n\nRecords in 2002, the album’s eighteen songs explored Native American history and Amos’s own Eastern Cher- She’s a really, really strong okee roots. Amos cast herself as Scarlet, who journeys player. She has a really wide through the album’s stops, turns, and moments toward depth of range, just dynamibecoming, for all intents and purposes, a middle-aged cally, and she knows the woman. Scarlet’s “walk” is situated against a meander- instrument really well. . . ing map of America included in the album art. The songs with Tori, it’s as if she’s “A Sorta Fairytale,” “Crazy,” “Your Cloud,” “Indian made for the instrument in a Summer,” and “Wampum Prayer” all concern the rever- certain sort of way. There’s ence for the earth that she was taught as a child. “I some sort of spatial relationwanted to communicate that your relationship to ship between her brain and your nation, and to the earth, is very personal,” and that this relationship is something that people must her body and the piano— claim for themselves. “The land has a spirit and she is everything’s always right there. She rarely makes a mistake, alive,” said Amos (Amos and Powers 2005, 218). Something oddly prescient happened during the writ- even when she’s doing someing of this particular album. Although Amos wrote the thing that’s not rehearsed or song “I Can’t See New York” in May 2001, by the time if she’s improvising. —Jon Evans, bassist the album was released in 2002 in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001, most listeners couldn’t help but imbue it with a different meaning. The album also felt more political than previous material, as Amos was responding to America’s military involvement in Afghanistan and the second Gulf War. In “Amber Waves,” inspired by the name of actress Julianne Moore’s character in the ﬁlm Boogie Nights, Amos visits a friend who is an aging, fading porn star by the same name. But Amos also acknowledges that America, as an idea, has been “pimped out,” bought and sold and marketed as a commodity. In some ways, the album can be read as a gentle critique, an affectionate warning, to Americans: If we do not preserve and revere our own land, it will be taken away from us. Although some critics thought Scarlet’s Walk was an all-too-easy rock formula—the concept album—many agreed that it marked a strong return to her previous form. The album, as a whole, for all its extensive metaphorical underpinnings, showed a warmth, cohesion, and groundedness that many fans welcomed. It peaked at number seven on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart, and the same position for Billboard’s Top Internet albums; it also is the only of her albums, thus far, that has stalled before reaching gold status. While writing the songs for 2005’s The Beekeeper, Amos kept in mind ideas of pollination, of the various sides and components that create the shape and substance of a honeycomb. “I’ve been walking through many different types of gardens. The songs were trying to show me they formed a shape and were independent but connected to each other, no different from the structure of hexagonal cells that make up the beehive,” she wrote (Amos and Powers 2005, 78).\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\n16\n\nMuch as Amos was able to use this metaphor to unite and celebrate the various components—or sides—of her own persona, the album also deals with loss—speciﬁcally, the loss of her brother in a tragic car accident prior to its release. The title track addresses it. “It was originally written about my mother— she was critical, and she ﬂat-lined and came back. That’s the last time I saw my brother,” she told Rolling Stone in an online exclusive story. The album’s sad and poignant capper, “Toast,” was written on the airplane on the way home from her brother’s funeral. Overall, like Scarlet’s Walk, The Beekeeper was another overly long (nineteen tracks), loosely autobiographical song-cycle, situated this time in different gardens all tended to by the album’s beekeeper protagonist. Musically The Beekeeper introduces the Hammond B3 and other organs, which allowed Amos to further expand her songwriting capabilities and imbue her music with a newfound soulfulness and at times, a bit of funkiness. The album debuted on the Billboard chart at number ﬁve, selling 83,000 units in the ﬁrst week. Billboard called it “some of the most accessible music of her career, coupled with beautifully obscure lyrics” (2005). At press time, however, the album had not yet reached Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certiﬁcation; it has sold about 350,000 copies in the United States. The album is not completely about loss. Although admittedly inspired by her new B3 organ (she calls it “Big Momma”) and her relationship with another B3 that she views as a male organ, she wrote “Sweet the Sting” to some degree about “the marriage of the sacred and the profane” and the balancing of the masculine and feminine elements in her own songwriting. This merging of sacred and profane, however, is Amos’s lifelong mission as a songwriter: to unite sexuality and spirituality and ﬁght the dichotomy that American popular culture establishes for young women. On her 2007 release American Doll Posse, Amos took the idea of image formation even further. Over the course of twenty-three songs, she sings from the perspective of women whose personalities relate somehow to Greek and Roman female archetypes. As a concept, it’s probably the most risky, intellectual, and “out there” album she has yet to release. In 2007, Jenny Eliscu in Rolling Stone paid Amos a bit of a left-handed compliment and said that “there’s way too much conceptual malarkey surrounding the songs, but if you can ignore her fake posse, you’ll ﬁnd this is Amos’s best album in many years.” Nevertheless, fans are still with her: It became a number ﬁve seller on the Billboard 200 album charts and fared the same for the Internet album charts.\n\nMISSION, MOTIVATION, PROCESS From the very start of her songwriting career, Amos, like many artists, wrestled with the demons, unanswered questions, and inconsistencies she experienced growing up. When she does not know the answer to something, Amos is likely to turn to books for the answer. Amos travels with a library on the\n\nTori Amos\n\ntour bus, an extensive collection of books, newspapers, magazines—anything that shows potential to become fodder for songwriting or general contemplation. When Amos released her ﬁrst greatest hits album, it was not too surprising that she called it Tales of a Librarian. As for cataloging her songwriting process, inspiration, and ideas, Amos keeps a ﬁle—literally or ﬁguratively—of what she calls her “song motifs,” which consist of anything from a line or a lyric to a full-ﬂedged melody. She is painstaking but somewhat disorganized about it and keeps a recorder next to her Bösendorfer piano at her home. She keeps tapes stacked up but not in any particular order—she knows where to ﬁnd what she needs. When she sits down to write, she has already gathered hundreds of notes, snatches of conversations, ideas, words, and phrases. Amos can sit for hours doing this sort of work, but it’s no guarantee that the result is useful. Still, she has faith that although a good idea will stick with her, it may not always reemerge when she’s seeking it. She admitted that sometimes songs do just come through but also “. . . if I don’t go through this painstaking cataloging process, then these pieces of music are just ideas that never become tangible” (Amos and Powers 2005, 110). Sometimes a motif will emerge. Her husband Mark Hawley said that he has seen her write songs in a few minutes, such as “Marianne” from Boys for Pele, but it is not the usual procedure. He says that Amos works painstakingly hard on all aspects of her songwriting, regardless of whether it is one lyric line or an entire section of a song. Inspiration can strike at any moment, and she believes “verses are setups; choruses are payoffs. They need to be. Music and words often come together when a song Being initially shows herself to me. I don’t always get the full story” (115). Showing her keen grasp of and love for metaphor, Amos likened the structure of a song to the structure of a house. “Sometimes you want the chorus to be the kitchen in a song. Sometimes you want the chorus to be the shower, very cleansing. Sometimes it is in the bedroom” (106–107). Regarding the songwriting process, she said, “I believe that the songs choose you, but you have to be willing to develop and stretch as a player, or your repertoire is only going to be of a certain type.” Certainly this is something she has managed to steer clear of: learning to play various types of the organ has expanded her songwriting and essentially changed her music. But she returns to the metaphor of architecture—of a blueprint, of a building. “Imagine that you have been able to let yourself into this fascinating architectural space but you are in only one room and you do not know how to get to the other rooms because as of now there are no doorways. It becomes like a sonic puzzle” (117). Themes: Goddesses, Myths, Archetypes, and Religion Traveling with the extensive library allows Amos to dip into various subjects and areas of interest, whether it’s Jungian archetypes, religious ﬁgures, feminism,\n\n17\n\n18\n\nWomen Icons of Popular Music\n\nor mythology. Most of what she writes is ﬁltered through this self-conscious reservoir of information, and she believes she is “in service” to these myths and ideas. This deep understanding of myths and archetypes allows Amos to explore how they surface in her own life and in her songwriting. One of Amos’s longstanding archetypes of exploration is Mary Magdalene. She tells of a formative experience that occurred when she was just eight years old, sitting at the Sunday dinner table with her family and some bishops from the Methodist church. The bishops were using a metaphor to describe Jesus’s relationship to the church and its followers. The bishop likened Jesus to a bridegroom and the Christian church to his bride. Bravely, but politely, Amos asked about Mary Magdalene. The question raised a few eyebrows and prompted a discussion at the table among the bishops and her father about how Mary Magdalene was a fallen woman whom Jesus saved and blessed. Amos realized that organized religion had downplayed Mary Magdalene’s role. The conversation stayed with her, and as she began to play music and develop into a songwriter, more scholarly and literary works were published that explored the controversial idea (among religious scholars and believers) that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married. It is also debated that she is an uncredited apostle whose teachings and writings were suppressed and subsequently forgotten during the choosing of the gospels—and for much of recent history. But that is not entirely the point—it is not important that Amos believes in what some might consider an historical footnote at best. She was able to see a parallel between the way in which Mary Magdalene had not only been ostracized and eliminated from history by the church, but the way in which women in general—and speciﬁcally in Amos’s own line of work—were silenced and marginalized. She began to see the inﬂexible thinking that is common in established institutions—religion and capitalism speciﬁcally—and started to explore the idea of how a woman could be both sensual and spiritual. These questions stay with her and form much of the impetus of her songwriting. How can a woman be whole if she does not and cannot acknowledge both of these sides of her humanity? Amos believes that the piano enables her to resolve and unite those issues. From the beginning of her solo career, Amos started exploring what she calls the archetypes of the two Marys—Mary, the virgin mother of Jesus, and Mary Magdalene. Feminist scholars refer to this dichotomy of culturally constructed roles for women as the virgin/whore complex—a woman is exclusively one or the other and cannot contain elements of both. Amos also refers to this process as integrating the sacred and profane. She describes the song “God” as a turning point, because it enabled her to unite those seemingly disparate parts of her being. Other songs later in her career, such as “Marys of the Sea,” reprise this attempt for reconciliation as well. In the aforementioned song “Amber Waves” from Sca"
