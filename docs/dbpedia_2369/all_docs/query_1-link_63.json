        "text": "Richard Thompson\n\nAllmusic Biography : An iconic figure in British folk-rock, Richard Thompson is arguably the genres greatest triple threat: a dazzling guitarist, an outstanding songwriter, and a strong and evocative vocalist. As one of the founding members of the group Fairport Convention, Thompson would have a seismic impact on both U.K. folk and rock, incorporating elements of traditional music (most effectively on 1969s Liege and Lief) in a way that sparked a new interest in authentic British folk. After leaving Fairport, Thompson recorded a series of albums with his spouse Linda Thompson that established him as an estimable guitarist and tunesmith; while they were a favorite with critics (especially with 1974s I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight), the sales of their albums were usually dismal. With suitable irony, the couple was experiencing a commercial breakthrough with 1982s Shoot Out the Lights when their marriage rancorously ended. Richard launched a solo career in earnest with 1983s Hand of Kindness, and through the 80s and 90s, thanks to an increased touring schedule, better promotion of his releases, and livelier production (often from frequent collaborator Mitchell Froom), Thompsons cult following grew considerably, and his song \"1952 Vincent Black Lightning\" (from 1992s Rumor and Sigh) became a folk and bluegrass standard, especially after it was covered by the Del McCoury Band in 2001. After more than a decade recording for Capitol Records, Thompson returned to an independent label with 2003s The Old Kit Bag, in which he returned to a more organic production style. Thompson wavered between acoustic projects (2005s Front Parlour Ballads) and more robust full-band efforts (2013s Electric), but despite his status as an elder statesman of the singer/songwriter community, he remained active and engaged as a writer and musician, releasing the powerful 13 Rivers in 2018, when he was 69 years old.\n\nRichard Thompson was born on April 3, 1949 in Ladbroke Crescent, Notting Hill, West London, England. His father, a detective with Scotland Yard, was an amateur guitarist who was fond of jazz (particularly Django Reinhardt and Charlie Christian) and traditional Scottish music, influences that would inform Richards music in the decades to come. Young Thompson was also fond of rock & roll, and began playing guitar at a young age; for a while, his older sister dated a young man in a rock band, and Richard would sometimes get her suitor to teach him licks while his sister got ready for dates. While attending secondary school, Thompson joined his first band, a teen combo called Emil and the Detectives; their bass player, Hugh Cornwell, would later enjoy success as a member of the U.K. punk band the Stranglers. In 1967, Thompson would become one of the founding members of the group Fairport Convention, a group influenced by Jefferson Airplane that initially specialized in American-style folk-rock. Discovered by manager and producer Joe Boyd, Fairport Convention soon landed a record deal and released their self-titled debut album in 1968.\n\nBy the time Fairport released their second album, 1969s What We Did on Our Holidays, original singer Judy Dyble had left the band, and Sandy Denny, one of the finest vocalists of her generation, took her place, and while Ian Matthews originally dominated their original songwriting, Thompson began contributing tunes like \"Meet on the Ledge\" and \"Tale in a Hard Time\" that would become standards in their repertoire. Unhalfbricking, released later in 1969, was an even stronger effort highlighted by a greater emphasis on traditional folk and their extended version of the traditional \"A Sailors Life,\" but between its recording and release, the band experienced a tragedy. After driving home after a gig in Birmingham, Fairports van was part of an accident that claimed the lives of drummer Martin Lamble and dancer Jeannie Franklyn, who was Thompsons girlfriend. Other members of Fairport would experience injuries, and Matthews had already parted ways with the group, so the band added new drummer Dave Mattacks and fiddler Dave Swarbrick as bassist Ashley Hutchings dug deep into researching British folk songs. Released in December 1969, Liege and Lief was a masterpiece that found the group fusing rock and folk in a new and innovative way, and while Denny left before they recorded the follow-up, 1970s Full House, it was another triumph in the fusion of the genres.\n\nIn 1971, Thompson left Fairport Convention, feeling that his songwriting was moving away from what the group did best. Uncertain about the direction of his career, Thompson initially worked on solo efforts from Ian Matthews and Sandy Denny and played on two ad-hoc projects featuring fellow Fairport members, 1972s The Bunch (in which they put their spin on classic rock & roll tunes) and 1972s Morris On (dominated by electric versions of traditional melodies for Morris dancing). By the time the year was out, Thompson had released his first solo album, Henry the Human Fly, which was not warmly received by critics and sold so poorly that its initial release was said to be the worst-selling album ever released by Warner Bros. (Thompson would later quip he was personally acquainted with everyone who bought a copy.) One of the backing vocalists on the Henry the Human Fly sessions was Linda Peters, who had also appeared on The Bunch; the two began performing together, and they were married in October 1972.\n\nIn 1973, Richard & Linda began work on their first album together, I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, released in April 1974. While it was not initially issued in the United States, it won rapturous reviews from critics, and the title song became a minor hit in the U.K. The Thompsons next released Hokey Pokey (March 1975) and Pour Down Like Silver (November 1975) before dropping out of music for several years; Richard and Linda became Sufi Muslims and relocated to a communal Sufi community outside London. While Richard was out of the public eye, a collection of rarities and live material, Guitar, Vocal, was issued in 1976. Returning to the music business in 1978, the Thompsons recorded First Light for Chrysalis Records, which showed a definite Islamic and North African influence, along with their characteristic British folk-rock, though it was recorded with American session musicians. 1979s Sunnyvista, a considerably livelier and wittier effort, earned only more public indifference, and they were dropped by the label. (In a small consolation, \"Dont Let a Thief Steal Into Your Heart\" from Sunnyvista was later covered by the Pointer Sisters.)\n\nWithout a record contract, Richard & Linda demoed eight songs in the summer of 1980 before going into the studio for their next project, with singer/songwriter Gerry Rafferty producing. Rafferty had had a great deal of success during the latter part of the 70s, and as a fan he was eager to bring the Thompsons music to a larger audience. However, the subsequent tracks were shelved due to Richards dissatisfaction with the outcome. In the meantime, Richard went back to work by himself in 1981, recording a collection of instrumental tunes entitled Strict Tempo!, which he released independently on his own Elixir label. Richard & Linda eventually ended up back in the studio, with former Fairport producer Joe Boyd to re-record some of the material from the Rafferty sessions, as well as three new songs. The finished product, Shoot Out the Lights, was the most powerful album in the Thompsons oeuvre, as well as their first real breakthrough. Released by Boyds own Hannibal Records, it not only received universally glowing reviews, but was their biggest seller to date. It also marked the end of their marriage, and following a tumultuous tour of America, their musical partnership ended as well.\n\nRichard remained with Hannibal for 1983s Hand of Kindness, which found him leading an eight-piece band (including two sax players) and sounding noticeably more cheerful than on Shoot Out the Lights. One of the albums songs, \"Tear Stained Letter,\" would become a Top 20 country hit in America in a version recorded by Cajun artist Jo-El Sonnier. 1984s Small Town Romance, drawn from a pair of solo acoustic performances recorded for radio broadcast, would be his last release for Hannibal, and he kicked off a major-label deal with Polydor with 1985s Across a Crowded Room. Once again produced by Joe Boyd, the album sold well by Thompsons standards, and a live video was released documenting one show from the supporting tour. Hoping for bigger sales, the label paired Thompson with American producer Mitchell Froom for 1986s Daring Adventures. Once again, the album fared well with critics but sales were lukewarm, and Polydor dropped him from their roster.\n\nOnce again between labels, Thompson found various side projects to keep him busy. He co-wrote the score for the BBC television series The Marksman and collaborated with John French (former drummer with Captain Beefhearts Magic Band), Fred Frith (formerly of Henry Cow), and Henry Kaiser (a well-respected experimental guitarist) in a group dubbed French Frith Kaiser Thompson. FFKT issued an album in 1987, Live, Love, Larf & Loaf, through Rhino Records that equally favored the musical minds on board. Thompson then struck a deal with Capitol, and his first LP for the label, Amnesia, arrived in stores in October 1988. Like Daring Adventures, it was produced by Mitchell Froom, and while it saw better sales than most of Thompsons previous efforts, he enjoyed a greater breakthrough with 1991s Rumor and Sigh, a relatively accessible effort that included \"1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\" a folk ballad in the classic style that quickly became a fan favorite and one of his most covered songs. (Between Amnesia and Rumor and Sigh, French Frith Kaiser Thompson found time to cut a second album, 1990s Invisible Means, for Windham Hill Records. 1990 also saw the release of Hard Cash, featuring music written by Thompson for a British television series.)\n\nThroughout the 90s, Thompson maintained his fervent cult following while gaining greater acceptance among fans of roots rock and contemporary folk, reinforced by his growing reputation as a stellar live act whose guitar work left fans breathless. In 1992, Capitol released Thompsons score for the Australian film Sweet Talker, and in 1993, Rykodisc (who now owned the Hannibal back catalog) released an ambitious, career-spanning three-CD box set titled Watching the Dark, which testified to the richness of Thompsons body of work. Thompsons next proper album, Mirror Blue, was released in 1994; that same year, Bonnie Raitt brought out the album Longing in Their Hearts, which included a cover of RTs \"Dimming of the Day,\" and Capitol released Beat the Retreat, a Thompson tribute disc featuring performances of his songs by R.E.M., Los Lobos, X, Bob Mould, Dinosaur Jr., June Tabor, and others. (A previous Thompson tribute album, The World Is a Wonderful Place, came out in 1993 and included recordings from Victoria Williams, Christine Collister, Tom Robinson, and Plainsong.) In 1996, he returned with You? Me? Us?, a two-CD set that featured one disc of electric material and another of acoustic recordings. It would turn out to be Thompsons last album produced by Mitchell Froom; after cutting a collaborative concept album with Pentangle bassist Danny Thompson, 1997s Industry, and appearing on Phillip Picketts The Bones of All Men, Richard went into the studio with producers Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf to cut 1999s full-bodied Mock Tudor.\n\nIn 2001, shortly after the release of the compilation Action Packed: The Best of the Capitol Years, Thompsons contract with the label ran out and they opted not to renew the deal. In 2003 he returned to the ranks of the independent recording artists with his album The Old Kit Bag, released by Cooking Vinyl in the U.K. and SpinART in the United States. Thompson continued to follow the indie path with his next release, 2005s Front Parlour Ballads, a primarily acoustic effort that Thompson recorded in his own garage studio. In 2006, the respected folk label Free Reed released RT: The Life and Music of Richard Thompson, a five-disc set of outtakes, live recordings, and album cuts, many of which were pulled from Thompsons personal collection. (Yet another box set collecting highlights from his studio sessions, Walking on a Wire 1968-2009, came out in 2009.) A new studio album, Sweet Warrior, arrived in 2007 (released by Shout! Factory), followed by another collection of brand-new songs (recorded in front of a live audience) called Dream Attic in 2010.\n\nOver the next few years, Thompson continued to tour regularly and in 2012 he headed into Buddy Millers home studio in Nashville to record a new album. Released early in 2013, the resulting record was called Electric and, appropriately enough, showcased Thompsons electric guitar skills. He also appeared on his ex-wife Lindas fourth studio album, Wont Be Long Now, on the track \"Loves for Babies and Fools\" later that year. In July 2014, he released an acoustic collection of his well-known songs entitled Acoustic Classics; a second volume followed in 2017. For his 2015 album Still, Thompson traveled to Chicago, where Jeff Tweedy of Wilco served as producer for the sessions; Tweedy also added musical accents to several songs, recorded at Wilcos private recording studio, the Loft. Thompson self-produced 2018s 13 Rivers, a spare but powerful album he recorded on analog tape with backing from his road band.

With the exception of a couple of short instrumental breaks and various electric shadings, Thompsons Stratocaster defers to accordions, fiddles, whistles, dulcimers, harps, and his own acoustic guitar. The songs, which are more idiosyncratic than his Fairport output, are the primary focus. Cuts such as \"The Poor Ditching Boy,\" \"The New St. George,\" and \"The Old Changing Way\" have the timelessness of the best traditional material Fairport had been mining in the past, while \"Roll Over Vaughn Williams,\" with its swirling electric guitar, and the accordion and electric guitar interplay of the folk-rocker \"The Angels Took My Racehorse Away\" are prime examples of Thompsons vision of fusing the old and the new. At the time of its release, Henry the Human Fly, with its fresh, yet eccentric take on folk and rock, along with tales of \"poor ditching boys,\" racehorses, tinkers, \"painted ladies,\" and weddings where \"nobodys wed\" was not a fashionable record, but like the bulk of Richard Thompsons work, it transcends times and trends.

While Hand of Kindness is dominated by songs about unhappy relationships, the truth is most of Thompsons albums are full of such songs; if you want to read an autobiographical slant into the album, Thompsons well of anger (\"Tear Stained Letter,\" \"A Poisoned Heart and a Twisted Memory\") and regret (\"How I Wanted To,\" \"Hand of Kindness\") seem to run especially deep. But the albums darkest track, \"Devonside,\" is a tragic tale of a dysfunctional relationship that clearly does not involve himself, and the album has a number of solid up-tempo rockers, such as the witty horse-racing tale \"Both Ends Burning\" and the rollicking, Cajun-flavored \"Two Left Feet.\" Thompsons vocals and guitar work is in splendid shape throughout, and his band is particularly fine fettle, especially drummer Dave Mattacks and John Kirkpatrick on accordion. Hand of Kindness lacks a bit of the narrative depth and emotional push-and-pull that made Shoot Out the Lights an instant classic (and while \"Both Ends Burning\" and \"Two Left Feet\" are lots of fun, its a stretch to call them great songs), but it certainly confirmed that Richard Thompson had a more than interesting solo career ahead of him.

Across A Crowded Room takes a slightly more subtle approach than Hand Of Kindness; the arrangements have been pared back a bit (there are fewer horn charts, and John Kirkpatricks accordion is sadly absent), and Joe Boyds production is roomier and more atmospheric, making the most of the albums broader soundscape. But for the most part Richard Thompsons formula remained the same here, and if that makes it sound like hes just treading water, that might be the case for an artist less consistently remarkable. \"When The Spell Is Broken\" and \"Ghosts In The Wind\" find Thompson revisiting his favorite theme, love gone awry (the latter boasting a beautifully delicate, ethereal arrangement), while \"Fire In The Engine Room\" and \"Little Blue Number\" are unusually hard-rocking numbers with Thompson laying into the songs fast and frantic. And \"Love In A Faithless Country\" is a striking sketch of love under difficult circumstances that recalls nothing so much as George Orwells 1984. There arent many musicians who could make an album as strong as Across A Crowded Room and have it sound like business as usual, but given the consistent strength of Richard Thompsons body of work, this set sounds fairly typical ... and typically splendid.

While Frooms approach was noticeably different than Boyds, he displayed an obvious respect for Thompsons gifts, and though Daring Adventures boasts a bit more aural sheen than the albums that preceded it, Richard Thompsons style as a guitarist and songwriter still shines through clear as day. Froom replaced Thompsons usual rhythm section with top-shelf session players Jerry Scheff on bass and Mickey Curry on drums (Jim Keltner sits on three cuts), and if their style is less idiosyncratic than that of Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks, they match the material far better than Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark did on First Light. And Froom kept his fondness for tape-loop keyboards and eccentric signal processing in check, giving the sessions an enjoyably warm, organic sound. If Daring Adventures has a flaw, its the songs; while Thompson, as usual, has a handful of gems on board (among them the joyous near-rockabilly of \"Valerie,\" the disquietingly atmospheric \"Lovers Lane,\" and the two heart-rending tales of life during and after wartime that close the album, \"How Will I Ever Be Simple Again\" and \"Al Bowllys In Heaven\"), there are also a few that dont go anywhere, and \"Baby Talk\" and \"Dead Mans Handle\" could have been left on the cutting room floor without disappointing anyone. If youre not familiar with Richard Thompsons music, youll doubtless find that Daring Adventures has great songs played by a great band, with an amazing guitar player up front. But if youve already heard most of his records, youll know he can do better.

This being a Richard Thompson album, the high quality of the songs and the guitar playing is a given; while Daring Adventures had a few cuts that sounded like padding, Richard comes up aces this time out, and even sounds a bit more upbeat than usual, letting his political side rise to the surface on \"Jerusalem on the Jukebox\" and \"Yankee, Go Home\" and rocking out on \"Dont Tempt Me\" and \"Gypsy Love Songs.\" (Be advised that the gloriously sad \"I Still Dream\" and \"Waltzings for Dreamers\" are on hand to remind us this is a Richard Thompson album.) Frooms production makes more of a difference this time out; Amnesia sounds brighter and cleaner than Daring Adventures, with a sharp but glossy mix that truly flatters Thompsons fiery Stratocaster solos (not to mention Jim Keltner and Mickey Currys drumming), and the blend of British folk-rock stalwarts (John Kirkpatrick, Phillip Pickett, Danny Thompson) and American session veterans (Keltner, Curry, Jerry Scheff, Tony Levin) makes for a set of tart and flavorful performances. Amnesia is one of Richard Thompsons best-sounding albums, and not a bad place for beginners; he hadnt sounded like he was having this much fun since Sunnyvista in 1979.

Given this, 1991s Rumor and Sigh is arguably the best album for those wanting to sample Thompsons work for the first time. It captures Thompson at the top of his form on all fronts, but also gives his songs just enough polish to make them approachable for the unconverted, and though its several shades darker than the average adult-contemporary album, it honors Thompsons obsession with romantic despair and the less pleasant quirks of fate without sounding depressing in the process. Producer Mitchell Froom tricked up Thompsons sound a bit, but his approach added to the material rather than interfering with it; the topsy-turvy keyboards and sharp, snapping drum sound on \"Gray Walls\" and \"You Dream Too Much\" actually add to their narrative drama, and Froom coaxed some of Thompsons most soulful vocals on \"Why Must I Plead\" and \"I Misunderstood.\" Thompson actually gets funny on \"Dont Sit On My Jimmy Shands\" and the darkly hilarious \"Psycho Street,\" and Thompson fans who like his work straight with no chaser will be knocked flat by \"1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\" perhaps the best traditional-style number in his songbook, and the harrowing \"God Loves A Drunk,\" an unnerving tale of several kinds of addiction. While Rumor and Sigh is quite slick by Thompsons standards, its clean lines and bright mix serve both the songs and the bandleader quite well, and make Thompsons tunes sound like the radio hits theyve always deserved to be.

But while Thompson has often expressed his desire to reach a greater number of listeners, hes (thankfully) unwilling to dumb his music down, and its probably no coincidence that he followed up his most user-friendly album with the more difficult Mirror Blue. Mirror Blue was constructed on a more modest scale, with the arrangements scaled down and the mix putting the instruments in greater relief. While Mitchell Frooms production added both polish and punch to Rumor and Sigh, his work on Mirror Blue marked the point where he began to interfere more than he helped; the tinny, crashing sound he imposes on Thompsons guitar and Pete Thomas drums soon wears out its welcome, and Frooms washes of retro-styled keyboards are more prominent than they need to be. And while song for song Mirror Blue boasts material just as strong as Rumor and Sigh (if not stronger), the tone is more dour, with the few rockers decidedly less friendly (\"Mascara Tears\" sounds downright mean) and the ballads more mournful (though \"King Of Bohemia\" and \"Beeswing\" are beautiful and affecting if you dont mind a good cry). But Thompson had a great set of songs here, and he performs them with typical fire and precision; his guitar work is glorious, and his vocals are passionate and unusually well controlled. Mirror Blue suggests that, after making an album with the mass audience in mind, Richard Thompson decided to make one for the fans -- and himself -- and if Frooms production sometimes gets in the way, loyalists will find plenty to revel in here.

Spread out over two discs, the budget-priced album features 19 tracks, separated into an electric (\"Voltage Enhanced\") disc and an acoustic (\"Nude\") disc, which each runs around 40 minutes; \"Razor Dance\" and \"Hide It Away\" appear on both discs. Despite its appearance, you? me? us? isnt one of Thompsons major works. What sinks the album isnt the songs -- as always, Thompson has written a handful of gems -- but Mitchell Frooms production. Frooms gauzy, pseudo-experimental approach masks the songs in an impenetrable haze, which neither Thompsons guitar nor his voice can cut through. There is no texture to the albums sound -- it is mushy and colorless, which cuts away at the heart of Thompsons direct, emotional songs. If the songs on you? me? us? were given the simple, direct production they deserve, it would have been a completely different, more compelling experience. As it stands, its a wildly uneven and unengaging listen, like the great majority of the Froom-produced Richard Thompson records.

The record doesnt come across as, and isnt meant to be, a history lesson, but rather an attempt to evoke the feel of the times and capture the lives of the people who lived and worked through the period. The Thompsons, joined by members of Dannys band Whatever, as well as his uncles Albert and Harry Thompson on trombones and Richards longtime associates Dave Mattacks on drums and Christine Collister on backing vocals, incorporate jazz, rock & roll, and traditional British folk music to convey their impressions of industry through the years. Richard, with songs such as the melancholy \"Drifting Through the Days,\" the edgy \"Saboteur,\" and the bouncy folk of \"Lotteryland,\" has created some of his most challenging music to date. Meanwhile, Danny, whose family actually worked the coal mines, elicits the sadness, drudgery, and even joy of industrial England with sounds ranging from 18th century-style brass bands to British traditional music and modern jazz. Industry, from the foreboding opening instrumental, \"Chorale,\" to the mournful closer, \"Last Shift,\" is for the most part a dark ride through the mines and factories, and the lives and times of the people who made and were affected by the industrial age. The record makes an excellent companion piece to another Richard Thompson project, 1990s Hard Cash, a collection of songs by various artists from the British folk scene about the working class in Britain.

Me? Us? Producers/engineers Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf keep the production clean and direct, allowing the songs to breathe and letting Thompson play guitar. That decision alone would have made Mock Tudor a satisfying listen, but what elevates it into the first rank of his albums is, naturally, the songs themselves. Thompson structured the album as a portrait of suburbia, tackling a different subject with each song. Its not all about desperation, although there certainly is a lot of that there. Instead, Thompson is at the top of his form, offering subtle shadings in his lyrics and remarkably catchy, memorable melodies throughout the album. As a matter of fact, its a bit of a tour de force, opening with the rollicking \"Cooksferry Queen\" and closing with its polar opposite, the hushed, intimate black comedy of \"Hope You Like the New Me.\" Between those two songs, Thompson covers all sorts of emotional textures, resulting in his most affecting effort in years. Since even on his uneven 90s efforts he demonstrated that he still was in full grasp of his talents, it cant be said that Mock Tudor is a comeback, but its certainly the best album hes made in over a decade.

But then, why should he, when record companies have lined up to release his work, even if they ultimately cut him loose after failing to get his account into the black? Thompson has successively signed to large independents Island and Chrysalis (when they were independents), then to major imprints Polydor and Capitol. Beginning in 1988, his Capitol sojourn has been the longest, spanning more than ten years and five regular studio albums, three of which actually nudged into the lower reaches of the charts. Publicity materials for this compilation of that material do not spell out whether he is still signed to Capitol, but the label does seem to be putting some effort into promotion. Certainly, Action Packed is not your typical best-of kiss-off, but rather a well-considered collection drawing on some of the most impressive recordings of Thompsons later career as well as including rarities (the new-to-CD tracks \"Mr. Rebound\" and \"Fully Qualified to Be Your Man\" and a previously unreleased live duet between Thompson and his son Teddy on \"Persuasion,\" a lovely song Thompson co-wrote with Tim Finn). Thompsons Capitol catalog has been uneven occasionally, especially because of the inappropriate production style of Mitchell Froom on some of it, but by gathering together the best of each of his albums, Capitol here demonstrates that, especially as a songwriter, he has frequently matched the uncompromising style of his early work, particularly on \"Turning of the Tide,\" \"1952 Vincent Black Lightning,\" \"I Misunderstood,\" \"I Feel So Good,\" and \"Beeswing,\" songs imbued with his dark, folk-informed sensibility, yet buoyed up by his stirring guitar work. If Action Packed marks the end of Thompsons latest label affiliation, it makes a good tombstone; if it is only an interim report, it demonstrates that his talents are undiminished.

Featuring eight tunes from Mock Tudor, and five others from his back catalog, Semi-Detached Mock Tudor offers up a strong set list (though thats not especially surprising, at least if one is familiar with the album they were supporting), and Thompson and company are in typically splendid form. Thompsons effortlessly amazing guitar work is on prominent display throughout, with the high speed twists and turns of \"Cooksferry Queen,\" and the sinuous jitter of \"Two Face Love\" sounding particularly remarkable in this context. Thompsons vocal readings are especially passionate on Semi-Detached Mock Tudor, making the most of a terrific set of songs, and as always, hes brought a crack set of sidemen along with him; with bassist Danny Thompson and drummer Michael Jerome stacking up as one of Thompsons finest rhythm sections ever, and Thompsons son Teddy Thompson adding lovely harmonies on several numbers. Anyone who has ever seen Richard Thompson live knows that the man never disappoints an audience, and fans who either missed this tour, or are looking for an aural reminder of what they heard, will want to make room for Semi-Detached Mock Tudor in their collection.

One of the musos queried was Richard Thompson, and while many of his comrades couldnt be bothered to go further back than 1940 in their overview of musical history, the scholarly Thompson took the notion seriously enough to extend his own list of notable songs as far back as 1068 A.D. While Playboy never ended up printing Thompsons list, the notion made enough of an impression on him that he put together a special show in which he guided his audience through his own version of the greatest hits of the past ten centuries. 1000 Years of Popular Music is culled from recordings of Thompsons concert series of the same name, and beyond the novelty value of the set list (from the oldest round in the English language to Britney Spears in a mere 76 minutes!), it also offers a rare look at Thompson the interpretive musician, as well as lends a fascinating perspective on his musical influences. As one might expect, the early innings are dominated by the British folk tradition, with \"King Henry Vs Conquest of France\" and \"Blackleg Miner\" suggesting where Thompsons melodic sense first took root, and other tunes demonstrating how operetta and the British music halls absorbed and refined similar themes. Thompson also indulges his passion for classic jazz of the 1930s and 40s on some Nat King Cole and Louis Armstrong chestnuts, and wraps up by following rock & roll through Jerry Lee Lewis, the Who, and the Beatles to Prince and Britney Spears (\"Oops! I Did It Again,\" of which Thompson writes, \"Taken out of context, this is a pretty nice song\"). Considering that precious few of these songs were meant to be performed by a solo acoustic guitar, Thompsons arrangements are inventive and effective; whether hes going for laughs or drama, he gets the most from his material. (Hes also fortunate to be joined in the proceedings by vocalist Judith Owen and percussionist Michael Jerome). 1000 Years of Popular Music is entertaining, informative, and a lot more enlightening than the average lecture on musical history. Perhaps Thompson should consider writing a text on the subject should his remarkable fingers ever fail him.

One of the tracks on this album, a nine-minute workout on \"Cant Win,\" was previously released as an example of Thompsons live prowess on the box set Watching the Dark, and most of More Guitar is every bit as jaw-dropping as that stellar performance. The set list is strong, concentrating on the then-current Amnesia while also paying a few visits to gems from the back catalog (including a surprising version of Henry the Human Flys \"The Angels Took My Racehorse Away\") and a pair of choice covers. The band is one of Thompsons better road units, with the always welcome John Kirkpatrick on accordion, Clive Gregson and Christine Collister adding lovely harmonies, and drummer Kenny Aronoff driving the show like a locomotive. But the real draw of this disc is hearing Thompson go gloriously nuts on electric guitar, and his frenzied down stroking on \"Dont Tempt Me,\" the over-the-top string bends and modal insanity of \"Gypsy Love Songs,\" and ominous Stratocaster gunfire of \"Shoot out the Lights\" are manna from heaven for fans of the mans electric work. And even the most subdued numbers on this set display a passionate emotional intensity thats gripping and beautiful. In short, this was unexpectedly a show for the ages, and More Guitar allows Thompson fanatics to hear it at their leisure. Those who enjoy the more pastoral side of his music may be a bit put off, but if you love to hear him rock out, youve got to hear this disc, and thats that.

In 2000, after a dozen years with Capitol Records, Thompsons contract was not renewed, and 2003s The Old Kit Bag found him recording for an independent for the first time since 1985. Creatively, this actually turns out to be a good thing; after the periodically excessive and self-conscious production Mitchell Froom imposed on nearly all of Thompsons releases for Capitol, 1999s Mock Tudor (produced by Tom Rothrock and Rob Schnapf) found Thompson going for a more lean and live sound, and with John Chelew at the controls, Thompson follows suit on The Old Kit Bag. Cut in a straightforward and stripped-down manner, with just bassist Danny Thompson, drummer Michael Jerome, and harmony vocalist Judith Owen along for company, The Old Kit Bag captures Thompson in spare but sympathetic circumstances; the performances are strong and confident, without a note or gesture wasted, and Thompsons interplay with his rhythm section is nothing short of superb. While Thompson eases back on the \"wow, listen to that!\" solos on The Old Kit Bag, his playing is fluid and superbly tasteful throughout, and his subtle overdubs show hes as good an accompanist as a bandleader. And Thompsons songwriting chops are still in superb shape; \"A Love You Cant Survive\" and \"Ill Tag Along\" are further meditations on Thompsons favorite theme, love and life gone wrong, and \"Outside of the Inside\" (which Thompson introduced on tour as \"a song about how the Taliban see the West\") is a chilling look inside a man blinded by his culture and his faith (and a bit of a surprise coming from a devout Muslim). The Old Kit Bag is Richard Thompsons simplest and most unadorned album since Shoot Out the Lights, and while it isnt an immediate masterpiece like that album, it confirms that this mans work is best presented at its simplest, and the result is a modest triumph.

Me? Us? features one disc of electric performances and another of acoustic material). Front Parlour Ballads marks Thompsons first full studio album of acoustic-oriented material since 1981s Strict Tempo!, and unlike that album, which was dominated by traditional material, this set features a bakers dozen Thompson songs. Thompson also recorded and produced this set all by his lonesome in his home studio, and while the man has always shown good taste in collaborators, Front Parlour Ballads reveals how bright he can shine on his own. With the possible exception of the jaunty opener \"Let It Blow\" and the bitter \"A Solitary Life,\" these elegantly constructed songs sound as if they would gain no aural advantage through bigger and louder arrangements, and the spare production allows the beauty of the melodies to shine through unfettered. While theres less flash in Thompsons guitar work on Front Parlour Ballads than on many of his albums, this restraint makes for a very powerful beauty of its own, especially in the counterpoint of the overdubbed guitars, and Thompsons vocals here are as effective as anything hes ever recorded as he allows his Britishness to run free in his lyrics. Front Parlor Ballads is built from modest stuff, but the finished product is as strong as anything Thompson has recorded in the past ten years; while this album supposedly began as an experiment as Thompson tested out some new recording gear, the results make it clear he shouldnt be afraid to spend a bit more time there, as this is a low-key triumph.

In 1993, noted Thompson, aficionado Edward Haber compiled Watching the Dark, three CDs worth of album cuts, unreleased studio outtakes, and rare live performances which offered a detailed chronicle of Thompsons career in music. However, not all fans were entranced with the set, and Neil Wayne and Nigel Schofield of the noted British folk label Free Reed Music sought Thompsons participation to create RT: The Life and Music of Richard Thompson, a massive five-disc set culled primarily from unreleased recordings taken from Thompsons own archives and accompanied by a 168-page book which includes an exclusive in-depth interview with the man himself. While RT is obviously a tremendous labor of love and a powerful testimony to Thompsons genius as a songwriter and guitarist, compared to Watching the Dark its something of a disappointment. While the notion of five CDs worth of rare and unreleased Richard Thompson recordings is enough to make nearly any loyalist salivate, nearly all the cuts are live tapes of highly variable recording quality; though most sound \"fresh off the board,\" an uncomfortably high percentage are scarred by noticeable technical anomalies (in particular boomy audience recordings and distorted radio broadcasts), and the 1972 recording of \"The Great Valerio\" from a Richard & Linda Thompson concert would barely be acceptable even by bootleg standards. (In all fairness, the booklet acknowledges the poor quality of the latter recording.) Also, given Free Reeds leanings as a folk imprint, its not surprising the set leans heavily on Thompsons solo acoustic performances rather than his electric full-band repertoire, and while the solo stuff here is almost uniformly splendid, the proportions are certainly off in terms of giving an accurate picture of his body of work, especially disc three, which promises a set of \"Epic Live Workouts\" but which leans towards acoustic numbers with extended solos rather than the electric explorations that are truly Thompsons most remarkable live achievements. And though Nigel Schofields liner notes offer an intelligent and impassioned appreciation of Thompsons work, the notes on the tracks themselves are less impressive, and the details on the source materials are often lacking or simply inaccurate (there are no Who covers on any of my copies of Shoot Out the Lights, no matter what Schofield says). None of this should suggest that RT isnt worth a listen -- simply put, Richard Thompson is one of the finest singers, guitarists, and songwriters to emerge in the second half of the 20th century, and there are dozens of dazzling examples of Thompson in full-flight here. Even when the audio is faulty, the performances are sterling, and there are a number of genuine rarities on-board, particularly on disc five, which features precious studio demos of a number of unreleased songs, including the haunting \"Bad News Is All the Wind Can Carry,\" \"Shady Lies,\" and \"In Over Your Head.\" For all its flaws, RT: The Life and Music of Richard Thompson will leave no one with any doubt about the strength of this mans talent. Obsessive fans will find much to revel in, but overall RT seems like a grand opportunity that didnt quite pan out, despite a wealth of good intentions.

But Thompson seems to have relaxed a bit with 2007s Sweet Warrior, which boasts a more expansive sound and ambitious reach than those two albums. Produced by Thompson with his longtime aide de camp Simon Tassano, Sweet Warrior more clearly recalls 1991s Rumor and Sigh than any of Thompsons other albums; it lacks the high gloss of Mitchell Frooms production on that disc, but the broad dynamic between upbeat and dour numbers and the thematic sweep of these 14 songs certainly suggest Thompson was thinking big while making this album, and it suits him. Thompson is able to play his traditional theme of romance on the rocks for laughs on this set with the witty \"Needle and Thread\" and the droll but pointed \"Mr. Stupid,\" while the sax-infused \"Bad Monkey\" is downright rollicking and the ska-influenced offbeat of \"Francesca\" is slinky and sensual. At the same time, Thompson digs deep into more serious themes, especially on the striking \"Dads Gonna Kill Me,\" a tense first-person tale of a soldier on patrol in Iraq, and while a very different sort of combat frames \"Guns Are the Tongues,\" its story of a dull-witted boy turned against his own interests is equally compelling; both songs show Thompsons narrative skill and gift for wordplay are as strong as ever. Producer Thompson gives guitarist Thompson just the right amount of room to show off his estimable skills on these sessions, and the core band -- bassists Danny Thompson and Taras Prodaniuk, drummer Michael Jerome, and rhythm guitarist Michael Hays -- is as strong and versatile as one could hope for. At 68 minutes, Sweet Warrior feels just a bit overstuffed, especially given the simplicity of its immediate predecessors, but theres a hefty portion of fine songs and masterful playing here, and no one who has ever succumbed to Richard Thompsons magic should pass this up.

This may explain why Thompson, a man who could best be described as a \"cult figure,\" is being honored with his third multi-disc box set. The 1993 set Watching the Dark was a brilliant overview of Thompsons body of work that included classic songs from all phases of his career along with rare live material, unreleased studio sessions, and even a few new songs. Released in 2006, RT: The Life and Music of Richard Thompson took a very different approach, instead collecting five discs worth of unreleased material drawn from Thompsons own tape archives, which seemed designed to please obsessive fans at the expense of those who wanted a reasonably clear picture of the arc of his career. And now, Walking on a Wire: 1968-2009 takes the opposite extreme -- its a four-disc set that offers a carefully edited and intelligently compiled chronological summary of Thompsons recorded repertoire, from his early recordings with Fairport Convention to his 2007 solo album, Sweet Warrior. However, it doesnt feature a single recording that hasnt been released before, and the few tracks that could pass as rarities come from \"authorized bootlegs\" Thompson has released through his fan club and website (nearly all still easily available).\n\nFor many artists, this wouldnt be quite such a severe failing, but with rare exceptions a four-disc box set is most likely to be purchased by an artists most loyal fans, and theres almost nothing on Walking on a Wire that wouldnt already be in the collection of a serious Richard Thompson aficionado, making this anthology seem both beautiful and redundant. But if youre looking for a convincing argument for Thompsons status as one of the great treasures of British rock and folk, Walking on a Wire succeeds beautifully. The programming gleans many of the most satisfying and significant moments from Thompsons recordings, and the material flows beautifully from one great track to the next, clearly reflecting the path his music has followed. The remastering is excellent, particularly on the earlier solo material, and Patrick Humphries liner notes offer a superb thumbnail sketch of Thompsons life and music, while the booklet is filled with great rare photos. As the biggest and most comprehensive \"Best of Richard Thompson\" album ever, Walking on a Wire succeeds beautifully, and its a wonderful and loving presentation of his art. But if youre already a fan, this will all seem very familiar, and while this is a splendid starting point for the uninitiated, persuading them they should start their Richard Thompson collection with a four-disc box set will probably be an uphill battle -- though its hard to imagine anyone who appreciates music that speaks honestly to the heart and soul not falling in love with this.

Live at the BBC is an immense body of work that displays Thompsons effortless ability to play many different styles with aplomb.

Not that Electric is entirely recorded on a Stratocaster -- he plucks away at an acoustic for \"The Snow Goose\" and there are other songs where the Strat is tucked away in its case -- but Electric crackles with an amplified energy, even when the instrumentation is decidedly quieter. Much of this is due to Thompsons decision to record the album at Buddy Millers intimate home studio in Nashville, as Miller favors a speedy solution to recording, favoring vibe over perfection. As such, theres atmosphere and air to spare on Electric -- its music that breathes, never feeling suffocated -- and theres plenty of room for Thompson to spin out spiraling guitar leads, but the focus isnt on his peerless playing or even his sharply crafted songwriting, which is once again finely observed and richly detailed. No, the distinguishing character of Electric is its feel, how Miller creates a wide-open space for Thompson, a vista that showcases his crackling musicianship and sharp songs. And Thompson has yet another strong set of songs here, highlighted by the big-footed stomp of \"Stony Ground,\" the lacerating wit of \"Sally B,\" the sardonic resignation of \"Good Things Happen to Bad People,\" and the gentle lilt on \"Salford Sunday.\" As good as the songs are, the distinguishing characteristic of Electric is its atmosphere, how the music jumps and breathes, how Miller has given Thompson his liveliest album in years and, on just sheer sonic terms, his best in a while, too.

Considered a studio companion piece to his frequent solo acoustic tours, the album reflects the modern arrangements hes developed for classic songs like \"Wall of Death,\" \"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight,\" and \"Beeswing.\" His influential guitar playing and showmanship have been well documented through a variety of late-career releases, but its a true pleasure to hear his effortless command of the instrument as well as his rich, commanding baritone in the warm, unplugged format. While some songs like 1991s already acoustic \"1952 Vincent Black Lightning\" essentially get a mostly unaltered encore performance, its interesting to hear something like the lonesome \"Down Where the Drunkards Roll\" updated with Richard singing instead of ex-wife Linda. This record could easily have been chalked up as a gap-filling acoustic highlight reel between new releases, but he attacks these older songs with true enthusiasm and a tastefulness that make this an essential album for Thompson fans and British folk fans in general.

After producing himself since 2005s Front Parlour Ballads, Thompson recruited fellow guitar ace Buddy Miller to oversee the sessions for 2013s Electric, which featured some of Thompsons best six-string work in years. Two years later, Thompson has returned with Still, which finds him working with another songwriter of note, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco. The sessions for Still were recorded at the Loft, Wilcos personal recording studio and rehearsal space in Chicago, and Tweedy and Jim Elkington (who has worked with Eleventh Dream Day and Jon Langford & Skull Orchard) sit in on some tracks. Though the sound and approach of the album is a shade more ambitious and adventurous than much of Thompsons work in the new millennium, rest assured this sounds very much like a Richard Thompson album, spare and clean and allowing his songs and guitar work to take center stage at all times. One of the best things about Still is that Tweedy clearly respects Thompson enough to stay out of his way, and the intimacy of numbers like \"Josephine\" and \"Beatnik Walking\" capture a feel that suggests youre sitting in the room with Thompson and his rhythm section (Taras Prodaniuk on bass and Michael Jerome on drums). And when the production does add some layers to the songs, they complement the material nicely, such as the spectral keyboards on \"Broken Doll.\" Thompson sounds both comfortable and confident on Still, playing and singing with incisive force while maintaining a natural feel that recalls the mans legendary live shows, and songs like \"No Peace, No End,\" \"Patty Dont You Put Me Down,\" \"Broken Doll,\" and \"Dungeons for Eyes\" show Thompson remains a peerless songwriter. And if closer \"Guitar Heroes\" stops and starts too much to keep up its momentum, hearing Thompson put his own spin on the style of his favorite pickers -- including Django Reinhardt, Les Paul, and Chuck Berry -- is a hoot. If fans were wondering if Jeff Tweedy would turn Still into Thompsons Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, the news (good or bad) is that Tweedy helped Thompson make just the sort of album thats made him one of our greatest legacy artists, and its an example of why Thompson is still worth hearing 43 years into a career that shows no signs of stopping.

(04:08)\n\nAcoustic Classics II : Allmusic album Review : Richard Thompson has more than once expressed an opinion (held by few others) that the guitar playing on his recordings of the 60s and 70s isnt especially good. Thompson believes that hes a much better player now than he was in his early days, and in some respects hes right, though the melodic ideas behind his dazzling solos have always been just as important as his estimable technique, which truly has improved with time. Between his mixed feelings about some of his work and the fact hes been performing increasingly as an acoustic act in the 2010s, it makes sense that Thompson might want to revisit some of the tunes from his back catalog, and as the title suggests, 2017s Acoustic Classics II is the second album in which hes cut new interpretations of some of his favorite pieces from his repertoire. On most of these 14 tracks, the arrangements have been pared down to just Thompsons guitar and vocals (a few feature discrete overdubs), and anyone who has seen one of his solo shows knows he can work magic with such a simple format. Here, Thompsons guitar work is subtly brilliant, even at its simplest, and his vocals remind us that hes the most intelligent and nuanced interpreter of songs. And beyond simplifying his performances, here Thompson puts a fresh spin on several of these numbers, and \"Devonside,\" \"Jet Place in a Rocking Chair,\" \"Crazy Man Michael,\" and \"The Ghost of You Walks\" have a decidedly different feel as they appear here. And if \"Guns Are the Tongues\" got lost in the shuffle on 2007s Sweet Warrior, its a true standout here. The performances on Acoustic Classics II dont supplant the original recordings, but they do offer compelling alternate versions of some of the gems from his songbook, and this is a simple but satisfying addition to Thompsons recorded catalog.
