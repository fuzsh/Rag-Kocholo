The style evolved from its humble roots in the foothills and backwoods of rural America to cosmopolitan centers around the country and around the world without sacrificing its cherished, traditional sound. In the late 1970s, the facts-of-life music changed direction when it was delivered to a new audience — one that was educated, middle class and urban. The seeds of change had been planted in the 1960s, but would take a decade or more to blossom. At the time, the dominant trend in recording practices belonged to the Nashville studios. In an effort to compete in the cutthroat music industry, the executives in Music City, U.S.A., decided to incorporate elements of pop into the pure strain of country. The results of this strategy would dictate the course of the genre for the next forty years. The country-pop Nashville Sound began to make serious inroads into mainstream radio, blurring the lines between styles. Popular music acts such as John Denver and Olivia Newton-John scored hits on both the country and Top 40 radio charts; they also won Country Music Association awards. As the decade wore on the style became increasingly polished, further alienating a segment of its fan base. The rebellious nature of performers provided an alternative to countrypop as many challenged the Nashville techniques of song production. This trend began in the 1960s and would be fittingly dubbed the “Outlaw movement.” Initially considered a passing fad and the simple reaction of disgruntled musicians, it dominated the country music charts and awards during the 1970s. It also won the hearts of many rock and roll fans for its use of electric guitars and drums producing a hard-core sound. It was only logical that the two most popular styles of country music to dominate the 1970s — outlaw and country-pop — would merge into one sound. It occurred with the movie Urban Cowboy, which ushered in a new craze and age. Suddenly country dances and fashion, riding mechanical bulls, and hanging out in roadhouse nightclubs were all the rage. Although the 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nUrban Cowboy trend endured throughout much of the 1980s, and influenced many, it never produced a single major artist. However, it did bring one major change in that country no longer belonged solely to the rural populace; it was a form that city dwellers could and did embrace. By the early 1980s, country music was at a crossroads. The style needed to rediscover its roots, its tradition, its simplicity, and it needed a hero to point it in the proper direction. George Strait emerged with his Strait Country album and ignited the New Traditionalist movement. By the mid–1980s, the New Traditionalist movement was in full swing as a whole crop of fresh artists emerged and dominated the charts. They received the most airplay, pushing aside the more established artists. The back-to-basics, non-pop approach to arrangements and instrumentation celebrated the folk roots of the music. Many fans who had drifted away from the genre returned to enjoy the gifts of Strait, Randy Travis and Clint Black. The Outlaw movement continued throughout the 1980s as some of the aging practitioners fought to keep it alive. There were those who took the basics of the sub-genre and pushed it further away from the mainstream to create an alternative to the mainstream. The nonconformist sound provided another dimension to the diversified country music fan base. The New Traditionalists dominated the latter half of the 1980s before they gave way to so-called New Country artists. Clint Black and Travis Tritt were at the forefront, but Garth Brooks was the superstar. An avid fan of the Eagles, Kiss and Billy Joel, he retained the basic elements of country music and mixed them with rock and roll, pop, and singer-songwriter elements that catapulted him to the top. Black represented a new breed of singers who cut a clean, handsome, softer image compared to that of Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams, Jr. Most important, Brooks and his followers were groomed for crossover success and would push the genre into unprecedented record sales at the multi-platinum level. They appealed to the country side of the music industry as well as the pop crowd. The first half of the 1990s saw a boom in the genre and produced an interesting array of artists. There were one-hit wonders and alternative artists as well as mainstream acts. New Country pushed aside George Jones, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard as fresh audiences had little patience with their seemingly outdated music. Country radio stations played music for their contemporary audience and phased out old favorites and alternative artists. By the middle of the 1990s, New Country completely dominated the charts and radio. Shania Twain, the biggest star of that era, enjoyed huge success with her country-pop stylings and blazed the trail for other female artists, including LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood,\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\namong others, to follow. In the latter half of the decade the women ruled the industry. In the late 1990s and the early part of the next decade, country music supporters were treated to a variety of styles providing something for every fan’s taste. The usual styles — bluegrass, honky tonk and western swing — were still popular and sounded fresh when recorded with updated techniques. Alternative, mainstream, and country-pop styles continued to hold their respective audiences. Today, the genre is a powerful industry with a rich and diverse talent base that still provides something for every taste. The term “modern country,” like “modern blues” and “modern jazz,” encompasses a variety of styles as well as sub-styles. For example, alternative country can be broken down into alternative country-rock, Americana, and neo-traditional folk. The blending of the old and the new ensures a very bright future. Despite all of the new trends in country music, the old styles have not been forgotten. There are western swing enthusiasts who have built upon the foundation laid by Bob Wills. There are also dedicated bluegrass players who champion the efforts of Bill Monroe. Honky tonk formed the bedrock of the New Traditionalists movement and remains quite popular. There remains a core group that celebrates the achievements of the early string bands like Gid Tanner and His Skillet Lickers and the Possum Hunters. The major difference between the outfits of yesteryear and today is that the modern groups don’t feature a leader but emphasize the equal responsibility of all members. There have also been a number of duos in the last forty years that have made their mark on the industry. The cowboy songs featured in the old westerns of the 1930s and 1940s that became part of the national psyche have also weathered the test of time. Although not as sophisticated as the slick, special effects-loaded movies of today, the remastered versions on DVD of the old films have won over a new audience, preserving the memories of an era long gone but not forgotten. Many of today’s action heroes owe a great debt to those actors of an earlier era. Many of the country-pop vocalists of today claim a connection to the greatest voice in country music history, Patsy Cline. She injected her songs with a pop flavor that had a strong influence on Shania Twain, LeAnn Rimes, the Dixie Chicks, Trisha Yearwood and Faith Hill, among others. The slick techniques that brought many aspiring singers to Nashville to record their songs remain intact. Today’s CDs are produced with a definite technological skill and mastery to sound modern and contemporary. The legacy of Chet Atkins lives on. Like every other style, country music is constantly evolving in order to appeal to a new generation of fans. However, mainstream twang, a simple\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nmusic at its core, has always been about tradition. The gap between the traditionalists who cherish the older sound and the new enthusiasts who push the boundaries ensures that the genre will forever remain exciting and dynamic. The music has strived to appeal to an audience that grew up on rock and roll, MTV (as a video channel), soul, blues funk, punk and early rap. Interesting marketing strategies have been put in place to encourage appeal to the new fans. Country is no longer solely the music of a certain demographic of the population, but one that appeals to a cross-section of the listening audience. There are three networks devoted to the genre: CMT, VH-1 Country, and GAC. Originally, The Nashville Network (TNN) was the premier American country music video channel; it was launched in the early 1980s. In 2000, it was renamed The National Network to accommodate its reformatted programming. The renamed TNN competed against USA Network, TNT, and superstations TBS and WGN. This book features the modern country artists who have kept the tradition of the genre alive in a contemporary setting. The first section, “The New Traditionalists,” features those that re-established the mainstream country sound in the 1980s by delving into the past. They returned the genre back to its roots and delivered the music to urban America. “Alternative Country” highlights those that made country music on their own terms. “Groups” features those acts that carried on the tradition of the Skillet Lickers, the Carter Family, the Possum Hunters and many others prominent in the 1920s and 1930s while making contributions to every new style of the genre. “CountryPop” celebrates those that were able to spin gold by combining country with pop stylings. “New Country” champions a cross section of country singers from the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. There are hundreds of country music associations that preserve every aspect of the style. There are also thousands of festivals that take place all over the globe. The venues provide something for everyone from the casual listener to the rabid fan. The changes to country music have not affected its popularity or power; in fact, they have kept the style fresh and appealing to a new generation of fans who have discovered the beauty, magic, depth and intensity of the genre. The once regional sound of the Appalachian people has grown into a billiondollar industry and is an integral part of the pop culture scene. However, in the end, country music remains country music.\n\nPART ONE\n\nThe New Traditionalists In the early 1980s, country music was at a crossroads. The Urban Cowboy craze was in full swing. There were country-pop crooners, a handful of aging Outlaws and the country-rock group Alabama. The genre needed to rediscover its roots and draw upon the classic styles of the past. In 1981, an unassuming hero emerged from his native Texas with the song “Unwound.” George Strait had no crossover desires and delivered a back-tobasics, neo-traditional sound that didn’t include any pop elements. The arrangements and instrumentation reflected the celebration of his rural roots. Others would soon take up the cause. Ricky Skaggs, an instrumental prodigy, owed his sound to traditional bluegrass. The Judds, a mother and daughter duo, sang simple songs with mass appeal and were the direct opposite to the country-pop stylings of Barbara Mandrell and Dolly Parton. Reba McEntire dominated the 1980s with her mainstream sound. In 1986, Randy Travis released his debut album that put the New Traditionalist style squarely at the forefront of country music. The New Traditionalists built their sound on classic honky tonk, yet had all the advantages of updated production techniques and equipment, making the music sound authentic and modern. By the mid–1980s, they had taken over the country airwaves and charts. Strait, Skaggs, Travis and Vince Gill only added to the dominance of the style and became the leading figures. Eventually, others such as Alan Jackson, Clint Black, Keith Whitley, and Travis Tritt arrived on the scene. Each had his own distinct style and branched out from the New Traditionalist format. The sub-genre had established a launching pad for the superstars of the early 1990s who would take country music to a commercial universe never thought possible. From the New Traditionalist movement sprang the Neo-Traditionalists, a group of artists that also played in the hard-core country style but were revivalists. The biggest difference between the new and neo camps was that the latter operated on the fringes of the industry while the former were strictly mainstream. Some of the main proponents of the neo-trad movement were Iris DeMent, Lorrie Morgan, Michael Martin Murphey, Diamond Rio, Jamie O’Hara, Carlene Carter and Rosanne Cash. 5\n\n6\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nSome of the names associated with the New Traditionalist style but not featured in this book include John Anderson, the O’Kanes, Joe Diffie, John Michael Montgomery, Marty Stuart, Trace Adkins, Suzy Bogguss, Marty Brown, Tracy Byrd, Mark Collie, Skip Ewing, Radney Foster, Hank Flamingo, Sammy Kershaw, Tracy Lawrence, David Lee Murphy, Collin Raye, Aaron Tippin, Clay Walker, Larry Boone, Mark Chesnutt, Doug Stone, and Ty Herndon. The following artists featured in this book returned country music to its roots, but used modern recording techniques, proving that the style could sound contemporary and authentic: • George Strait, who is credited with igniting the entire New Traditionalist movement. • Ricky Skaggs, a bluegrass enthusiast and one of the best instrumentalists of the modern era. • Reba McEntire, who was the most important female singer of the 1980s and 1990s even after she pursued a television and film career. She could also be classified as part of the Neo-Trad movement. • Keith Whitley, who had a short but powerful career that had a major impact on the future direction of the genre. • Vince Gill, one of the major mainstream performers in the early 1990s going against the grain during the Garth Brooks era. • Alan Jackson, who took the established parameters of the New Traditionalist movement and expanded on it without wavering from the mainstream. • Randy Travis, who broke wide open with his first album and quickly became the poster boy for the style. • Toby Keith, a patriotic country musician who came into prominence in the 1990s. He has not shied away from controversy. • Clint Black, who ignited the mass-market appeal of country music that exploded in the 1990s. • Travis Tritt, a prime voice projecting an Outlaw image without the big hat.\n\nGeorge Strait (1952–) Strait Style The influence of honky tonk, bluegrass and western swing on today’s country music is immeasurable. The new artists have taken the best of mainstream country to forge something fresh and exciting. One of these modern performers managed to weld traditional roots with contemporary elements to create his own style. His name is George Strait.\n\nGeorge Strait\n\n7\n\nGeorge Strait was born on May 18, 1952, in Pearsall, Texas. He was raised in the state on a ranch that had been in the family for nearly a century. Although his mother would leave, taking his sister along, young George remained behind with his father and brothers. When not helping out with chores on the farm, he played music in a local rock and roll garage band. However, his musical dreams seemed far away at this point in his life. He attended college briefly before dropping out and eloping with his high school sweetheart. Later he joined the army and was stationed in Hawaii, where during his posting he played on a base band. The outfit also performed in civilian venues under a different name. In 1975, he gained his honorable discharge from the army and relocated back to Texas hoping to complete his college education. He studied agriculture at Southwest Texas State University, and during this time he formed his own country band, Ace in the Hole. The group developed a local following in the south and central parts of Texas and as far away as Huntsville and Houston. Sometimes they opened for Strait’s idol, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. Although the amateur group recorded, they never gained enough attention to sustain a long term venture. Strait moved to Nashville in an effort to ignite his career, but because he lacked connections in the music business the venture was a negative one. Upon his return home, he was determined to correct this shortcoming and hooked up with a Texas club owner who had once worked for MCA records. In 1980, the company signed him to a recording contract after executives listened to his marketable sound. In 1981, his first album, Strait Country, appeared. His first single, “Unwound,” was released and climbed into the Top Ten. However, the second song pulled from the album, “Down and Out,” was less successful. The record broke open with “If You’re Thinking You Want a Stranger (There’s One Coming Home),” which went all the way to number three on the charts. More importantly, Strait’s record drew deeply from the honky tonk tradition, bypassing the trappings of lush country-pop crossovers, Outlaw, Urban Cowboy swagger and country-rock; it pointed the genre to a new future direction. For the remainder of his career, he would release a string of consistent, quality albums and CDs that were a blend of hardcore honky tonk, western swing and Bakersfield country with some melodic ballads. Each contained at least one number one hit. Over twenty-five years later, he holds the record for more number one songs (41) than any other country singer, surpassing Conway Twitty by one. The 1980s belonged to him as he dominated the singles charts, and all of his albums reached platinum or gold status. While many of the superstars of the 1980s watched their careers fizzle, Strait, because of his dedication to traditional styles, was able to survive the early 1990s when a more\n\n8\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\ncommercial approach ruled in Nashville. His consistency was the key to his success. At various intervals he released greatest hits packages, including a fourdisc career retrospective entitled Strait Out of the Box in 1995. Whether the product was new or repackaged material, fans could not get enough of King George, a moniker that had been rightfully bestowed upon him. In 1982, he began his movie and television career. He had bit parts in The Soldier and Mystery. Later, he played Dusty, the lead in the film Pure Country, which included a successful soundtrack. He also appeared as himself in the movies The Horse Whisperer and Grand Champion. In addition he provided the voice of Cornell on the animated television show King of the Hill. The performance side of his career also made the news. From 1997 through 2001, he headlined the George Strait Country Music Festival, which included appearances by Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson and other stars. Since 1983, one of his regular concert venues has been the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. This resulted in an album, Last Time: Live from the Astrodome, recorded during the final show at the Astrodome in 2002, which set a paid attendance record. In 2003, the Rodeo moved to Reliant Stadium where a year later he would set a new attendance record. In his more than twenty appearances at the Houston Rodeo, he has played to a total of a couple of million fans, making him one of the most visible country artists on the scene. His appeal never faltered over his career and remained steady throughout every new trend. In 2006, he released It Just Comes Natural, a CD of new material that included the hit singles “Give It Away” and the title track. Many of these songs were written with longtime collaborator Dean Dillon. But the biggest news of the year was his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He performed “Give it Away” and became only the second artist (aside from Eddy Arnold) to become a member of the prestigious institution while still recording number one songs. In 2007, he launched a tour with Ronnie Milsap and newcomer Taylor Swift as his opening acts. He performed at the Houston Rodeo where his son worked as a roper. There are also more future releases marked for an audience with an insatiable appetite for his music. Strait continues to perform and record. George Strait is a country music rock. For over twenty-five years he has been one of the most solid performers on the circuit. His albums have ranged from excellent to very good and the fact that some of his recorded efforts seem weaker than others is because so many were simply outstanding. It was evident from the very first release that he was something special when he shot to the top of the charts where he has remained throughout his distinguished career.\n\nGeorge Strait\n\n9\n\nWith his smooth, emotive voice he has crafted a sterling career. There is an effortless ability to his vocal delivery that has enabled him to stay on top of the charts for three decades. Part of his genius exists in his skill to record in the hard-core country tradition, yet give it a fresh, contemporary feel, giving his albums an even balance and mood. His certification according to music industry standards ranks him just behind Elvis and the Beatles. The greatest influences on Strait were the traditional country artists Merle Haggard and George Jones. Another was the western swing enthusiast Bob Wills. Strait managed to borrow heavily from all of these performers and fashion something that was his own without sacrificing anything. It is an essential component of his very successful career. In turn, Strait has made an impact on a number of artists including Clint Black, Brooks & Dunn, Garth Brooks, Billy Ray Cyrus, Pirates of the Mississippi, Steve Wariner, John Berry, Ace in the Hole Band, Kenny Chesney, Daryle Singletary, Mark Wills, Gil Grand and George Canyon. His earnest approach, which has seen him uphold the harder sounds of Haggard, Wills and Hank Williams, Sr., has often been compared to the slickly-produced country-pop material. But King George has blazed a path for the new generation proving that a singer can stick to roots and enjoy celebrated success. Strait has been nominated for more CMA Awards than anyone else and has won sixteen of them. He was Entertainer of the Year in 1989 and 1990. As well, he was acknowledged as the top touring country act of the 1990s and remains a staple of U.S. radio. Strait Out of the Box is the number two box set on the all-time best selling parade. He has given the world a wealth of songs to enjoy. A partial list includes “Marina Del Rey,” “You Look So Good in Love,” “Right or Wrong,” “Let’s Fall to Pieces Together,” “Does Fort Worth Ever Cross Your Mind,” “The Fireman,” “You’re Something Special to Me,” “Nobody in His Right Mind Would’ve Left Her,” “All My Ex’s Live in Texas,” “Am I Blue,” “Ocean Front Property,” “Baby Blue,” “Famous Last Words of a Fool,” “If You Ain’t Lovin’, You Ain’t Livin’,” “Ace in the Hole,” “Baby’s Gotten Good at Goodbye,” “What’s Going on in Your World,” “You Know Me Better Than That,” “If I Know Me,” “I’d Like to Have That One Back,” “I Know She Still Loves Me,” and “Carried Away.” The aforementioned tunes are just some of his number ones. He has also enjoyed many other songs that placed in the top ten. While his albums and singles have sold over sixty million copies, the performance side of his career has also been an important part of his grand success. He has set numerous attendance records across venues throughout the United States. He is a cherished live artist because he is able to reproduce his songs to sound exactly the way they are found on record. George Strait is a country music legend who has fashioned a very powerful career because of his savvy and talent. His dedication to traditional\n\n10\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\ncountry combined with a contemporary edge enabled him to stay ahead of the pack.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY: Let’s Get Down to It, MCA MCAC-53648.

In the modern era there have been many who continued to carry the bluegrass torch. Preeminent among them is Ricky Skaggs. Ricky Skaggs was born on July 18, 1954, in Cordell, Kentucky. Like Alison Krauss and Barbara Mandrell, he was a child prodigy. At five, his father gave him a mandolin, and Ricky taught himself how to play the instrument. That same year he performed on stage for the first time at a Bill Monroe concert, reeling off a driving version of “Ruby Are You Mad at Your Man?” He continued to develop as a musician by adding the fiddle and guitar to his blossoming musical arsenal, as well as playing in the Skaggs Family group. At seven, Ricky appeared with Flatt & Scruggs on television. He absorbed the honky styles of George Jones and Ray Price, and showed an interest in the British Invasion bands the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Although his taste was eclectic, he remained devoted to bluegrass and traditional country that formed the basis of his sound. At fifteen, he was a member of Ralph Stanley’s bluegrass band, the Clinch Mountain Boys, which also included Keith Whitley. The two young virtuosos became good friends since they were both exciting fiddlers, and it was only natural for them to jam together. Sometimes these sessions included Keith’s brother Dwight on banjo and the trio played on radio opening for Stanley, who was truly impressed with them. Skaggs, a multi-instrumental performer on the guitar, mandolin, fiddle, and banjo, was an invaluable member of the group. During his three-year stint with Stanley, he played at numerous bluegrass concerts and shared the stage alongside many country music legends who were always in awe of the Kentucky kid with the wild-eyed licks. He also played on Stanley’s Cry from\n\n12\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nthe Cross album and did session work on Whitley’s solo album, 2nd Generation Bluegrass. In 1972, he left the Clinch Mountain Boys and worked a regular job at the Virginia Electric Power Company, but music was in his blood. When the Country Gentlemen invited him to join the group, Skaggs jumped at the chance and remained with them for two years. Later, he moved on to the more progressive bluegrass band J.D. Crowe & the New South, adding his talent and experience to that outfit. He did more studio work with Whitley on the album That’s It, and later formed his own proper bluegrass outfit, Boone Creek. They played honky tonk, western swing and bluegrass to enthusiastic audiences, but never really made a major impact. Because of his multi-instrumental abilities, Skaggs was asked to join a number of groups, but turned down all offers. Finally, in 1977, after much badgering, he took Rodney Crowell’s place in Emmylou Harris’s Hot Band. For three years he helped the country diva rev up her career through concert appearances and recorded material. Skaggs was featured prominently on her album Roses in the Snow. Also during this time he had a great influence on his boss as he instilled more of a traditional bluegrass element in her alternative sound. During his stint with Harris, he was involved in many different projects including a final effort with Boone Creek, One Way Track, as well as two duet albums with Tony Rice, Take Me Home Tonight in a Song and Skaggs and Rice. However, his most satisfying project was the recording of his first solo album, Sweet Temptation. Sweet Temptation became a bluegrass hit featuring three songs from Ralph Stanley, “I’ll Take the Blame,” “Could You Love Me One More Time,” and “Baby Girl,” as well as the Lester Flatt tune “I’ll Stay Around.” His thenboss, Harris, contributed guest vocals. But perhaps the most encouraging element of the album was the fact that Skaggs was championing bluegrass and New Traditionalism while others were caught up in the Urban Cowboy fad. It was with great enthusiasm and confidence that he entered the studio to work on his second album, Waitin’ for the Sun to Shine. The effort was his first for Epic Records and spawned two number one hits, “Crying My Heart Out Over You,” and “I Don’t Care.” Despite the fact that it contained many remakes and boasted a simplistic approach, the record caught the attention of the country music press as well as rock and roll publications. He would go on to enjoy three more number one hits including “Heartbroke,” “I Wouldn’t Change You If I Could” and “Highway 40 Blues.” His personal success was rewarding, but his overall impact on the course of country music was even more important. Along with George Strait, he opened doors for acts like Randy Travis to solidify the New Traditionalist movement leaving the Urban Cowboy craze behind as a bad memory.\n\nRicky Skaggs\n\n13\n\nHis next album, Highways & Heartaches, displayed a maturity in his bluegrass sound combined with a strong traditionalist sensibility. It would boast four top songs and clearly established him as a major voice on the circuit. Skaggs had rekindled an interest in the style Bill Monroe had pioneered, influencing dozens of outfits to take up the cause. It was only a matter of time before he was recognized for his achievements. In 1983, he won a Grammy for Best Country Instrumental Performance; in 1984, for Best Country Instrumental Performance (“Wheel Hoss”); and in 1986, for Best Country Instrumental Performance (“Raisin’ the Dickens”). The CMA would make him Male Vocalist of the Year in 1982 and Entertainer of the Year in 1985. His group, the Ricky Skaggs Band, would win Instrumental Group of the Year three consecutive times from 1983 to 1985. But the best prize was becoming the youngest member of the Grand Ole Opry, in 1982. Throughout much of the decade he remained a dominant artistic and commercial force in the genre. With the string of Top Ten hits and albums including Don’t Cheat in Our Hometown, Country Boy, Live in London, Love’s Gonna Get Ya, and Comin’ Home to Stay, Skaggs carried the torch that Bill Monroe had lit so long ago. He was an icon and one of the most popular country music performers on the scene. In the latter part of the 1980s, his career began to wane. His records still amassed respectable sales, but his songs spent less time on the charts. However, the respect he commanded in the country music community was reflected in the number of musicians he recorded with including Rodney Crowell, the Bellamy Brothers, Johnny Cash, Jesse Winchester and Dolly Parton. Skaggs suffered through a dry period in the early 1990s as his New Traditionalist/bluegrass mixed sound was pushed aside by the slick contemporary style of Garth Brooks and others. In 1992, Columbia Records dropped him from their label due to poor sales. He concentrated on the performance side of his career and played at many festivals and concerts. He also hosted his own syndicated radio program, The Simple Life, starting in 1994. In 1995, he returned to the recording studio and released Solid Ground on Atlantic Records. It was a comeback effort for Skaggs and included “Cry Cry Darlin’,” “Every Drop of Water,” as well as a remake of Harry Chapin’s “Cat’s in the Cradle.” The title song was also a hit. It was not an adventurous effort, but sparked renewed interest in his career. Alison Krauss (acoustic guitar), Jerry Douglas (Dobro), Glen D. Hardin (piano), Vince Gill (background vocals), and Brad Ahern (guitar, vocals) guested on the album. Life Is a Journey, released in 1997, continued the momentum. While the effort lacked the fresh excitement of his early records, his breathtaking musical skills made up for it. He was still an instrumental force to be reckoned with, and there remained an exuberance that made the listening adventure\n\n14\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nworthwhile. Highlights included “Hillbilly Highway,” “When Life Hits Hard,” and “Let’s Put Love Back to Work.” Fifteen years after his last true bluegrass album, Skaggs returned with a genuine and heartfelt effort called Bluegrass Rules! A dynamite record that featured his backing band, Kentucky Thunder, it restored him at the forefront of the genre. Bryan Sutton, Bobby Hicks, Dennis Parker, Paul Brewster, Marc Pruett and Mark Fain all played superbly on the CD as did their fearless leader. Songs of note included the self-penned “Amanda Jewel” and “Somehow Tonight,” as well as “Little Maggie,” “Ridin’ That Midnight Train,” and “Get Up, John.” In 2000, he released Big Mon: The Songs of Bill Monroe that featured an all-star lineup of Mary Chapin Carpenter, the Dixie Chicks, Charlie Daniels, John Fogerty, Bruce Hornsby, Joan Osborne, Dolly Parton, Travis Tritt, Dwight Yoakam and Patty Loveless among others. Other tributes to his idol included Sing the Songs of Bill Monroe and Uncle Pen. Although Skaggs remained a prolific recording artist, the performance side of his career was much stronger. He toured many different venues with his band, Kentucky Thunder, with a staple of their circuit schedule being bluegrass festivals. A true force on stage, he always gave the enthusiastic crowd their money’s worth. In 2004, Brand New Strings was released. Three of the four songs Skaggs wrote for the album were instrumentals: “I Corinthians 1:18,” “Appalachian Joy,” and “Monroe Dancin’.” He played seven different instruments on the album, sang harmony vocals and was also credited as the engineer. The work was a balance between traditional and progressive bluegrass. He broke tradition with his next effort, Instrumentals, which was composed of numbers without lyrics. Some of the highlights included “Going to Richmond,” “Crossing the Briney,” and “Gallatin Rag,” which featured a guest appearance by Andy Statman on clarinet. Despite the inclusion of this unorthodox instrument in a bluegrass band, they make it work. Ricky Skaggs is a modern bluegrass icon. He has expanded the appeal of the style, building on the work of his prime influences, Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs and Ralph Stanley. He is a country music institution and is one of the most favorite sons in the genre. Ricky Skaggs is a dynamic instrumentalist and arguably the most important one in the modern era of country music. His dexterity, speed and taste are supreme. His musicianship is found on the works of many contemporary artists including Eddie Adcock, Rhett Akins, Mike Auldridge, the Battlefield Band, Jerry Douglas, Keith Whitley, Dolly Parton and a host of others. He was also a part of Emmylou Harris’s group as well as Boone Creek, the Country Gentleman, the Clinch Mountain Boys, and J. D. Crowe & the New South. Of course, his most famous association is with his longtime outfit,\n\nRicky Skaggs\n\n15\n\nKentucky Thunder. He has left his fingerprints throughout the country music world. Kentucky Thunder is a group of highly skilled individuals who take their cue from their leader. Bryan Sutton plays guitar, fiddle, mandolin, and banjo. He left the band in 1999 but returns occasionally. Bobby Hicks, the energetic fiddle player from North Carolina, joined the original Ricky Skaggs band that evolved into Kentucky Thunder. He remains with the group, adding his rollicking instrumental ability. Jim Mills, the banjo player, worked with the Brass Mountain Boys and Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver before joining the group. He has gone on to release a solo album. Darrin Vincent, the fiddler, was also a child prodigy, playing with his family’s band. He worked with dozens of country acts before joining Skaggs’s outfit. Andy Leftwich, a young fiddler, joined the band and immediately raised eyebrows. Mark Fain is a guitar player with a wealth of experience and was a fine addition to the talented lineup. Cody Kilby, a guitarist, and Paul Brewster round out the group. Other members have included Dennis Parker (bassist) and Marc Pruett. The leader of Kentucky Thunder has passed on his love of bluegrass to all members. The greatest influences on Skaggs were Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt, Earl Scruggs and Ralph Stanley. The bold, innovative music of these pioneers made a lasting impact and instilled his musical drive. In many of his albums he paid homage to the musicians who ignited the initial spark in him and provided the fire that allowed him to carry on during the tough parts of his distinguished career. Ricky Skaggs had a positive effect on a number of acts. A partial list includes Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Vince Gill, Wade Hayes, Keith Whitley, George Strait, Randy Travis, and Clint Black. Although not everyone followed in his bluegrass footsteps, he touched many with his instrumental skill and dedication to the style. Ricky Skaggs is a vital modern country musician with a long, colorful career. From his early days as a child prodigy to the dues-paying years as a sideman and on to his solo career, he has always displayed a love of the country style in his heart, especially bluegrass. His instrumental abilities, his choice of material, the awards, the prestige — all are part of the package that make up the leader of Kentucky Thunder.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY: Sweet Temptation, Sugar Hill 3706.

Many of the modern figures have followed the path blazed by their predecessors,\n\nReba McEntire\n\n17\n\ninjecting the same intensity and enthusiasm into their songs. One female singer put so much emotion into her entire catalog that she made her listeners feel the fire. Her name is Reba McEntire. Reba Nell McEntire was born on March 28, 1955, in Chockie, Oklahoma. Her father was a professional rodeo rider who taught all of his children — his three daughters and one son — how to ride; her mother taught them music. The four children formed a family group and enjoyed a regional hit in 1971 with “The Ballad of John McEntire,” a tribute to their grandfather. It was good training ground for Reba. In 1974, when Reba sang the national anthem at the National Rodeo Finals in Oklahoma City all thoughts of a family group evaporated. It was evident that she possessed the most talent of all the McEntire children and a solo career in music loomed over the horizon. Country singer Red Steagall, after hearing her perform, urged her to head to Nashville to cut a demo. The young girl heeded the advice and packed her bags for Music City U.S.A. armed with big dreams. In 1975, McEntire signed to Mercury Records and released her first record that same year. Unfortunately, her traditional hard sound was out of style with the audience’s tastes and the singles received very little airplay. A fiery individual, she was determined to make it in the music business and juggled marriage, school and her fledging singing career. In 1978, the single “Three Sheets in the Wind” b/w “I’d Really Love to See You Tonight” reached the Top Twenty. Despite this slight encouragement, it would be two more years of hard paying dues before she placed another song on the charts. Finally, in 1980, “(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven” made it to number eight in the country singles chart. In an effort to appeal to a great portion of the listening audience, she waxed more ballad-oriented material. The third album, Feel the Fire, was another failure, but she received encouragement when the next single, “Today All Over Again,” reached the Top Five. As well, the fourth studio album, Heart to Heart, was her first record to chart. Her fifth effort, Unlimited, included the number three hit “I’m Not That Lonely Yet” as well as “Can’t Even Get the Blues” and “You’re the First Time I’ve Thought About Leaving,” back-to-back number one hits. It was just the beginning of her assault on the country music charts, and she was definitely a star on the rise. On the performance side of her career, she left behind the nightclubs and honky tonks for a regular gig opening for the Statler Brothers, as well as Conway Twitty, Ronnie Milsap and Mickey Gilley. The concert performances at the better venues helped push record sales, and the record sales encouraged people to see her live. In 1984, she departed Mercury Records, bitter over their musical\n\n18\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\napproach, promotional and overall vision for her career. She recorded one last album, Behind the Scene, before moving on to MCA Records. “Just a Little Love,” the first single for her new label, reached the Top Five; however, it was not quite magic time. She wanted to make country music on her own terms and convinced the top brass at MCA who gave into Reba’s demands. She released My Kind of Country, which included “How Blue,” a number one hit. More importantly, the album covered old favorites from Ray Price, Carl Smith, Connie Smith and Faron Young that placed her firmly within the New Traditionalist movement spearheaded by George Strait. After years of being out of sync with the current trends of country music, she was finally leading the way. This was reflected in her winning the prestigious Female Vocalist of the Year Award by the Country Music Association in 1984. Passed over that year were Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell and Charly McClain; all had better years than McEntire. The rest of the decade would belong to McEntire as she established herself as the top country music female artist. Her songs often reached number one and the albums were certified gold. One of her self-penned efforts, “Only in My Mind,” was a Top Five hit. She began to headline her own concerts and won a second Female Vocalist of the Year award from the CMA. On January 14, 1986, she became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Her next release, Whoever’s in New England, was a very successful, especially the title cut which marked a change in her recorded material. McEntire had begun to write and release feminist songs in a traditional country style that spoke to women of her generation. The song “Whoever’s in New England” was also the subject of her first video and began a run of top singles that would stretch for three years. She found time during her heavy tour schedule to record What Am I Gonna Do About You, which went gold and produced two number one singles, the title track and “One Promise Too Late.” She claimed her third CMA Female Vocalist of the Year Award and was also named Entertainer of the Year. Her position as the top female country music vocalist was solidified. In 1987, McEntire won her first Grammy, divorced her husband, and moved to Nashville. She also released The Last One to Know, which included the number one “Love Will Find Its Way to You” as well as the title track which became a top hit. The album went platinum and won her a fourth CMA award as Female Vocalist of the Year. The seasonal effort Merry Christmas to You would go on to sell a couple of million copies. In 1988, with the album Reba she switched gears stylistically. For the past few years she had been firmly established as a leader of the New Traditionalist camp, but her self-titled record included more country-pop flavored songs. “Sunday Kind of Love” peaked at number three, and the album stayed\n\nReba McEntire\n\n19\n\non top of the charts for eight weeks. Two more singles, “I Know How He Feels” and “New Fool at an Old Game,” helped the effort go platinum. Later McEntire formed Starstruck Entertainment, a company that handled all aspects of her career including booking, publishing and promotion. The agency would go on to represent other artists. In 1989, her fourteenth studio album, Sweet Sixteen, spawned four hit singles including “Cathy’s Clown” (the old Everly Brothers hit), “Till Love Comes Again,” “Little Girl,” and “Walk On.” On a personal note, she married Narvel Blackstock, who had been her road manager as well as steel guitarist in her backing band since 1980. The couple would later have a son. That same year she made her feature acting debut in the comic horror film Tremors. Live, a concert performance, appeared on shelves for the Christmas rush. In May 1990, she returned to touring, and by the fall released Rumor Has It, which contained the number one “You Lie.” Three other songs, the title track, “Fancy,” and “Fallin’ Out of Love,” also placed in the Top Ten. The album would sell a few million copies, and her concert performances were by now major events. However, tragedy struck on March 16, 1991, when seven members of her band and her road manager were killed in a plane crash. It hit McEntire hard, and she dedicated her next studio effort, For My Broken Heart, to them. The album would go gold and platinum, spawning two massive singles, the title song and “Is There Life Out There?” She would later co-star in the television mini-series The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw. Her tours continued to sell out as devoted fans could not get enough of her first-rate performances. The album It’s Your Call went triple platinum and also became her first Top Ten pop record. It included the single “The Heart Won’t Lie,” a duet with Vince Gill that would eventually go to number one. Her next hit, another duet, with Linda Davis, “Does He Love You,” would be found on the Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 effort, selling a few million copies. The aforementioned single would give her a second Grammy and a CMA award for Vocal Performance. She later appeared in the television movie The Man from Left Field. Her career continued to roll on. Read My Mind went triple platinum and spawned the usual array of top hits including “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter” as well as “She Thinks His Name Was John,” a controversial song about AIDS. She had a speaking role in the movie North and a cameo in The Little Rascals movie. McEntire was the executive producer of a television movie based on her song “Is There Life Out There?” She also published her autobiography, Reba: My Story. The book became a best-seller and gave fans insight into her personal life. The album Starting Over marked the twentieth anniversary of her recording career. Although it topped both the country and pop charts, it yielded\n\n20\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nonly one Top Ten hit, “Ring on Her Finger, Time on Her Hands.” The compilation of cover songs from the past was a bit of a disappointment, but she would rebound with her next effort. What If It’s You spawned four Top Twenty hits: “How Was I to Know” (a number one), “The Fear of Being Alone,” the title track, and “I’d Rather Ride Around with You,” peaking at number two. The album would to gold and platinum. That year she also starred in the television mini-series Buffalo Gals, where she portrayed sharpshooter Annie Oakley. Her next top single, “If You See Him/If You See Her,” was recorded with Brooks & Dunn. It enabled her next album, If You See Him, to reach the top of the charts. Three other singles from the album were hits. She expanded her star appeal with numerous guest-star appearances on television series and in the television movie Forever. By this time she had long been a household name among pop culture audiences. Her second memoir, Comfort from a Country Quilt, was released in May 1999. She found time to record two outstanding albums, Secret of Giving: A Christmas Collection and So Good Together. Her first effort initiated a television movie, Secret of Giving, while the second one boasted the singles “What Do You Say,” “I’ll Be,” and “We’re So Good Together.” In 2000, McEntire stepped outside the country music realm to tackle and conquer the Broadway stage. Brought in to star in the musical Annie Get Your Gun because of her famous name, she far exceeded expectations with her performance. With her flair for entertaining, television and film experience, ability to sing, and rodeo background she was a natural. The role garnered her many awards including one from Drama Desk, the Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World. In October 2001, all of her acting experience was poured into her television show Reba. It featured her as a single mother of four children whose ex-husband lives next door with his new love interest. A sitcom with potential, it quickly became the focus of her career. She would manage to release one single, “I’m a Survivor,” that peaked at Top Five and preceded the release Greatest Hits, Vol. 3: I’m a Survivor. She would devote more time to her recording career in 2003 with the release of the single “I’m Gonna Take That Mountain.” As well, her studio album Room to Breathe was released and would eventually go platinum. The single “Somebody” went to number one and was followed by “He Gets That from Me” and “My Sister”; both were Top Ten hits. Although her music production was much smaller in scale than in previous years, it remained pure quality. In 2005, she appeared in a special concert version of the musical South Pacific that was performed at Carnegie Hall. It contained an all-star production team that included Brian Stokes Mitchell and actor Alec Baldwin. Later\n\nReba McEntire\n\n21\n\nit appeared on PBS as part of the Great Performances series. That same year the catalogs of Mercury Records and MCA Records were combined under the label of Universal, which led to many of Reba’s records being repackaged. The Reba album release from Universal first, #1’s, went gold and platinum. In 2006, she provided a voice in the animated film Charlotte’s Web. In February 2007, her television show ended its successful five-year run, which meant that she could now concentrate more on her music career. She continues to record and perform. Reba McEntire is a country music icon. She was the most dominant female voice in the genre during the 1980s and for much of the 1990s. She had a plethora of number one songs and many of her albums went gold, platinum and triple platinum. She was a solid concert headliner who toured all over the world entertaining legions of her adoring fans. Any discussion of Reba McEntire begins with her deep vocal talents. Her voice can wrap itself around a tender ballad and wring every ounce of emotion from it. The passion and fire unleashed on up-tempo numbers demonstrates the rock side of her singing prowess. The smoothness, professional edge and maturity in her abilities provided the soundtrack for a generation of country music fans. She has utilized her superior singing ability in a variety of media including records, movies, television and theatre to expand her career. With a sureness, a confidence and a positive attitude she developed into a powerful actress able to deliver high drama and quality comedy. Her Broadway stage appearances became events and earned her more awards to add to her impressive collection. She was able to project a strong stage presence in concert, and as a performer she became a world class entertainer. There was nothing quite like Reba on tour because she was able to deliver a total package to the audience that included music, personality and fun. Her knack for working a crowd beckoned to years gone by and is reminiscent of the Carter Family’s skills. McEntire has given the world a number of great songs. A partial list includes “Three Sheets in the Wind” b/w “I’d Really Love to See You Tonight,” “(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven,” “Today All Over Again,” “I’m Not That Lonely Yet,” “Can’t Even Get the Blues,” “You’re the First Time I’ve Thought About Leaving,” “Just a Little Love,” “How Blue,” “Somebody Should Leave,” “Only in My Mind,” “One Promise Too Late,” “Love Will Find Its Way to You,” “Sunday Kind of Love,” “I Know How He Feels,” “New Fool at an Old Game,” “Till Love Comes Again,” “Little Girl,” “Walk On,” “You Lied,” “Fancy,” “Fallin’ Out of Love,” “Is There Life Out There,” “The Heart Won’t Lie,” “Does He Love You,” “The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter,” “She Thinks His Name Was John,” “What If It’s You,” “How Was I to Know,” “The Fear of Being Alone,” “I’d Rather Ride Around with You,” “If You See Him/If You\n\n22\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nSee Her,” “What Do You Say,” “I’ll Be,” “We’re So Good Together,” “I’m a Survivor,” “I’m Gonna Take That Mountain,” “Somebody,” “He Gets That from Me,” and “My Sister.” Her immense and diverse catalog speaks volumes of her incredible talent. As the leading female country vocalist for more than a decade it is understandable that she would have a large influence on a number of artists. A partial list includes Linda Davis, Faith Hill, Stephanie Bentley, Terri Clark, Lila McCann, Danni Leigh, Meredith Edwards, Trisha Yearwood, LeAnn Rimes, Sara Evans, Ashley Monroe, Shania Twain, Carrie Underwood, Catherine Britt, Chely Wright, the Dixie Chicks, Danielle Peck, Jo Dee Messina, Kathy Mattea, Kellie Pickler, Lindsey Haun, Lee Ann Womack, Miranda Lambert and Taylor Swift. The Reba McEntire story is about a very talented singer who was determined to make it in the music business and overcome many obstacles to accomplish her dreams. She not only became a star but dominated the charts and the industry for over a decade. She conquered many media with her spectacular talent and her ability to feel the fire.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY: Reba McEntire, Mercury 836330. Out of a Dream, Mercury 836331. Feel the Fire, Mercury 822887-2.

Often, the impact a musician made can’t be measured by longevity, but by creativity, talent and power. One such singer who held great promise died too young and proved a hard act to follow. His name was Keith Whitley. Keith Whitley was born on April 1, 1955, in Sandy Hook, Kentucky. He was a child prodigy: he won a singing contest before he was five years old; learned how to play guitar before his tenth birthday; and sang on the radio a few years before he was a teenager. As a teen, he formed his first group, the Lonesome Mountain Boys, mainly a bluegrass outfit, with high school friend\n\n24\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nRicky Skaggs. The band played Stanley Brothers tunes and found quick success performing at local venues. In the 1960s, bluegrass legend Ralph Stanley re-formed his band after the death of his brother. Some time later, he discovered the talented duo of Whitley and Skaggs and invited them to join his Clinch Mountain Boys, an invitation which they readily accepted. Keith stayed with the group for two years and appeared on several albums including the 1971 offering Crying from the Cross, which was named Bluegrass Album of the Year. He also picked up valuable performance lessons from the veteran entertainer. From 1973 to 1975, Whitley drifted from one band to another looking for a new direction. He was still very much in the bluegrass phase of his career, and the style had enjoyed a renaissance of sorts but was slowly settling to an even level of popularity. He returned to the Clinch Mountain Boys and remained there for two more years, recording five more albums. In 1978, he joined J. D. Crowe & the New South, an established bluegrass outfit where he remained until 1982. Years later, a compilation of songs during this period would be released as Sad Songs & Waltzes. At this point in his career, he had acquired a sufficient amount of experience and boasted strong credentials, but his musical travels were about to take on a more personal path. After years of lending his talents to others, he finally embarked on a solo career. Whitley signed to RCA Records and released his debut record, Hard Act to Follow, a collection of pure honky tonk. Although it was a commercial and critical failure it marked the beginning of his switch from bluegrass-based material to a more traditional sound. Some of the highlights included the title track as well as “Turn Me to Love,” “If a Broken Heart Could Kill,” and “If You Think I’m Crazy Now (You Should Have Seen Me When I Was a Kid).” In 1985, he released L.A. to Miami, which yielded the Top Twenty single “Miami, My Amy,” igniting his ascent. He enjoyed three Top Ten hits: “Ten Feet Away,” “Homecoming ’63,” and “Hard Livin’.” He impressed many in the country music community who had written him off after the first album but were now reconsidering his special sound. Although his career seemed in perfect working order, his personal affairs were a shambles. He attempted to right this wrong by marrying Lorrie Morgan. She was a country star in her own right and the union seemed like the steady, firm influence he needed in his life to help him combat alcoholism. In 1988, his third album, Don’t Close Your Eyes, was released and became a smash hit. The title track, “When You Say Nothing at All,” and “I’m No Stranger to the Rain” were number one hits. He not only solidified his position as one of the top New Traditionalist artists on the circuit but also as a leader and a major influence. He was poised to move on to the next level of superstardom.\n\nKeith Whitley\n\n25\n\nHowever, fate has a way of dealing bad hands to those who tempt it. On May 9, 1989, he suffered a fatal case of alcohol poisoning and died at the age of forty-three. His last studio work, I Wonder Do You Think of Me, completed before his death and posthumously released, contained the number one singles “It Ain’t Nothin’” and “I Wonder Do you Think of Me.” A later single, “I’m Over You,” peaked at number three. Keith Whitley was a rising country music star before he died. After years of paying dues in a variety of outfits and contributing to the careers of many others, he had finally devoted his bountiful talents in order to benefit his own career. As an artist he was a complete package of voice, musicianship and songwriting. He had a twang in his vocal delivery that made him sound like a genuine country artist. Although not the most original singer, he did have the ability to know his limits, and this is one of the major attributes to his style. He never attempted anything that was out of his range and stayed within the parameters of what he could do, earning him much respect. Whitley had a large impact on a number of artists. A partial list includes Ricky Skaggs, Ricky Van Shelton, Travis Tritt, Randy Travis, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Joe Ely, Steve Earle, Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Keith Urban, Toby Keith, and Kenny Chesney. Not only did he touch those in the New Traditionalist camp, but he also was a guiding light to others plying different styles. His influence would have been much more profound if he had lived longer because he was just hitting his peak when he died. During his short career he gave the world a number of interesting songs. A short list includes “Miami, My Amy,” “Ten Feet Away,” “Homecoming ’63,” “Hard Livin’,” “Don’t Close Your Eyes,” “When You Say Nothing at All,” “I’m No Stranger to the Rain,” “I Wonder Do You Think of Me,” “It Ain’t Nothin’,” and “I’m Over You.” Certainly if he had lived his catalog would have been much larger. The many gems that the country audience missed out on due to his untimely death are a painful thought. Few artists with such a slim catalog and short time in the spotlight continued to have an impact long after their death. An electronic duet with his wife, Lorrie Morgan, reached the Top Twenty. Another duet with Earl Thomas Conley, “Brotherly Love,” peaked at number two. The Keith Whitley — A Tribute Album, issued in 1994 and including rare tracks that had been previously unreleased, further expanded on his growing posthumous fame. When Alison Krauss & Union Station had a hit with “When You Say Nothing at All,” which rose all the way to number three, it only added to the Whitley legend. But why should someone who had such a small discography and a short time in the sun be considered such an important artist in country music circles? There is no denying his talent. He possessed a style that was easily acces-\n\n26\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nsible and a true natural wonder. Perhaps the answer lies in the promise that was only starting to surface in Whitley’s career before his untimely death. Many believe that if he would have continued to release quality material like “I’m Over You,” and “Talk to Me, Texas,” over a period of time, he would have reached the stratosphere of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Since he died without ever fulfilling this potential, the fantasy is fueled. Whitley was a New Traditionalist and one of the leaders of the movement to return country back to its roots. Along with George Strait, his good friend Ricky Skaggs, and Randy Travis, Keith was an integral cog in the development and popularity of the style. Interestingly, the movement faded soon after Whitley’s unfortunate passing. The Keith Whitley story was that of a talented individual with a voice that resonates to this day. The quality music he left behind, the talent, the potential, the frustrating death are all part of the package. He proved that he was a hard act to follow and as the years drift by the legend has grown even wider.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY: Tribute to the Stanley Brothers, Jalyn 129. Sad Songs & Waltzes, Rounder 610399.

In modern times, new singers emerged from every part of the nation including metropolitan areas and the suburbs. Another region that has produced contemporary country music talent is the American heartland, the home of the man responsible for Oklahoma Swing. His name is Vince Gill. Vince Gill was born on April 12, 1957, in Norman, Oklahoma. His first taste of country music came from local bluegrass and his father, a judge who played country banjo and guitar. The young Vince picked up both instruments, honing his skills until he was proficient enough to play in local bands. He later added fiddle, Dobro, mandolin, and bass to the sound of his first group, Mountain Smoke. The highlight of the band’s life was to open for the established recording group Pure Prairie League. After high school graduation, he moved to Kentucky and joined the Bluegrass Alliance and stayed for about a year playing alongside band members Sam Bush and Dan Crary. After a brief stint in Ricky Skaggs’s Boone Creek, Gill relocated to Los Angeles, hardly a country music hotspot. He found work in Byron Berline’s group, Sundance. It seemed that Gill’s career wasn’t progressing very quickly. In 1979, he gathered his courage and auditioned for Pure Prairie League, whose members remembered him from the high school concert. To his surprise they hired him as their lead singer, and Gill remained with the group for three years. He recorded a few albums with them and they scored a Top Forty hit with the song “I’m Almost Ready.” He began to write material for them but departed in 1981 because of family duties. After his wife, Janis Oliver, a well-known member of the Sweethearts of the Rodeo duo, located on the West Coast, gave birth to a daughter, he contacted Rodney Crowell who jumped at the chance to have Vince in his band, the Cherry Bombs. It was while a member of this outfit that Gill met Emory Gordy, Jr., and keyboardist Tony Brown who possessed enough contacts to land a Vince a solo recording contract with RCA Records. After paying his dues for a decade and a half, it was the break that he had been looking for his entire career and made the most of it. Gill moved his small family to Nashville and cut his first EP, Turn Me Loose, with Gordy as producer. The EP yielded the single “Victim of Life’s\n\n28\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nCircumstances,” which slipped into the Top 40 of the country charts. It began a run of hit singles that reached into the 2000s and made him a star. His first full length studio effort, The Things That Matter, included a duet with Rosanne Cash, “If It Weren’t for Him,” which became his first Top Ten hit. A second song, “Oklahoma Borderline,” was another Top Ten hit. The album The Way Back Home was a solid effort and yielded the Top Five hit “Cinderella.” When not concentrating on his own career, he sat in on dozens of sessions with a variety of singers including Rosanne Cash and later toured in Emmylou Harris’s back-up band in the late 1980s. In 1989, his solo career began another chapter when he signed with MCA Records. The first album for his new label, When I Call Your Name, yielded the hit “Never Alone,” a song he had co-written with Cash. The record also included a duet with Reba McEntire, “Oklahoma Swing.” The title track peaked at number two and broke everything open. It earned Gill his first Grammy and another single, “Never Knew Lonely,” reached the Top Five as the record would go on to sell over a million copies. He became one of the most popular artists on the country music circuit as a live performer. He also carried on the momentum with his next offering, Pocket Full of Gold. It boasted four Top Ten singles including “Liza Jane,” “Look at Us,” the title track, and the number one hit “Take Your Memory with You.” A year after its release, the CD went platinum. On the strength of the smash record he joined the Grand Ole Opry. Although he had made great strides in just three short years, it was the 1992 studio album I Still Believe in You that made him a superstar. It went platinum within two months of its release. The title ballad became another number one hit and the second single, “Don’t Let Our Love Start Slippin’ Away,” was another chart topper. Later, one album would yield “One More Last Chance” and “Tryin’ to Get Over You,” both top songs, and the number three hit “No Future in the Past.” In 1993, his best-of album went gold, as did his Christmas offering, Let There Be Peace on Earth. He also performed a duet with Reba McEntire, “The Heart Won’t Lie,” from her CD It’s Your Call; the song went to number one. At this point in his career, despite the stiff competition, he was one of the most celebrated and popular male country artists on the circuit. In 1994, he released When Love Finds You, which topped the country charts and crossed over to the pop listings. It would sell over four million copies on the strength of a number of Top Five hits including “What the Cowgirls Do,” the title track, “Whenever You Come Around,” “Which Bridge to Cross (Which Bridge to Burn),” and “You Better Think Twice.” In the era of Garth Brooks, Gill managed to hold his own and carve his own niche in the very competitive industry. Often, when a superstar such as Gill reaches a certain plateau, he begins\n\nVince Gill\n\n29\n\nto coast. However, the Oklahoma native wasn’t about to rest on past performances. He fashioned an American roots album, High Lonesome Sound, which yielded three Top Five hits, “Worlds Apart,” “Pretty Little Adriana,” and “A Little More Love.” Although not quite as successful as some of his other works, it proved that he still had the magic touch. In 1998, amidst a divorce from his wife Janis Oliver, he released The Key, which announced his return to a more hardcore country sound. It produced one Top Five hit, “If You Ever Have Forever in Mind,” and the album went platinum on its way to becoming his first to top the charts. He remained one of the top acts on the circuit, and his performances were events. Like many other artists, his personal life found its way into his songwriting. The Let’s Make Sure We Kiss Goodbye celebrated his new romance with pop singer Amy Grant; the couple were married in 2000. Although it yielded a Top Ten hit in “Feels Like Love,” the critics and fans weren’t enamored with this effort, and it was shut out at the Grammys. The record was special to him for a very important reason because it featured his daughter Jenny on backup vocals. He returned to favor with the 2003 release Next Big Thing, which marked his first foray as full-time record producer. The CD featured guest appearances by Emmylou Harris, Lee Ann Womack, Michael McDonald, Kim Keyes, Andrea Zonn, Leslie Satcher, and Gill’s wife, Amy Grant. Highlights included “We Had It All,” “Young Man’s Town,” “These Broken Hearts,” “Real Mean Bottle,” and “The Sun’s Gonna Shine on You.” It was one of his strongest efforts in some time because he finally took the helm and decided how the record should be made. He followed three years later with These Days, an ambitious four-disc set of new material proving that he was still a force in the country music wars. The multiple disc set featured different sides of his musical personality: acoustic bluegrass, rock and roll, traditional country & western, and modern soul and jazz. “Workin’ on Big Chill,” “Love’s Standin’,” and “Cowboy Up” were highlights from the rock disc. “The Reason Why,” “What You Don’t Say,” “Rock of Your Love,” “The Memory of You,” and “Time to Carry On” (sung with his daughter) made up the pop side. The country & western disc featured “Some Things Never Get Old,” “Sweet Little Corrina,” “If I Can Make Mississippi,” and “Take This Country Back.” The acoustic bluegrass disc included “Little Brother,” “Cold Gray Light of Gone,” “A River Like You,” and “Ace Up Your Pretty Sleeve.” The depth and range of his entire set of musical skills were utilized to create this very interesting work. A number of artists were involved in the project including Gretchen Wilson, Amy Grant, Jenny Gill, Bonnie Raitt, Rodney Crowell, Sheryl Crow, Diana Krall, Buddy Emmons, Phil Everly, Rebecca Lynn Howard, the Del McCoury Band, Patty Loveless, Emmylou\n\n30\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nHarris, John Anderson, Katrina Elam, Lee Ann Womack, LeAnn Rimes, Guy Clark, Trisha Yearwood, Bekka Bramlett and Michael McDonald. Vince Gill is a country music institution. He has been one of the most successful artists of the modern era, enjoying a string of top hits and platinum albums. His concerts are well received, and his work on the efforts of others has only enhanced his reputation. He has fulfilled many roles as a songwriter, picker, producer, singer, and recording and performing artist. He possesses a voice that is tailor-made for the traditional material that has made him famous. However, there are different shades in his delivery that allow him to sing in any style. Gill’s high lonesome vocals always ring true and are the force that makes all of his songs instantly recognizable. Vince Gill is a traditional country music artist, and for most of his career he has explored every inch of this path. He has never followed trends and has remained faithful to the people that influenced him — Ray Price and Jim Reeves. Others who shaped his music include country-rockers the Eagles, Emmylou Harris and bluegrass practitioner Ricky Skaggs. He has been heavily rewarded for the wealth of country music he has delivered to the world. He has won eighteen Grammy Awards including Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his song “The Reason Why,” taken from the These Days CD. He was the CMA Entertainer of the Year in 1993, and again in 1994. He is one of the most honored singers in the modern music era. He is a noted songwriter and has penned many tunes for various artists. A partial list includes “Take This Country Back” ( John Anderson), “The Rock of Your Love” (Bonnie Raitt), “Faint of Heart” (Diana Krall), and “Sweet Little Corrina” (Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers). In addition, Emmylou Harris recorded “Some Things Never Get Old.” His originality, cleverness and attitude as a songwriter shine through every tune. He has also sung a number of his own songs including “Victim of Life’s Circumstances,” “If It Weren’t for Him,” “Oklahoma Borderline,” “Cinderella,” “Never Alone,” “Oklahoma Swing,” “Never Knew Lonely,” “Pocket Full of Gold,” “Liza Jane,” “Look at Us,” “Take Your Memory with You,” “I Still Believe in You,” “Don’t Let Our Love Start Slippin’ Away,” “One More Last Chance,” “Tryin’ to Get Over You,” “No Future in the Past,” “When Love Finds You,” “What the Cowgirls Do,” “Whenever You Come Around,” “Which Bridge to Cross (Which Bridge to Burn),” “You Better Think Twice,” “Worlds Apart,” “Pretty Little Adriana,” “A Little More Love,” “If You Ever Have Forever in Mind,” “Feels Like Love,” and “The Reason Why.” Whether performing an original or a cover of someone else’s material he has always been able to interject a personal appeal to it. The Vince Gill story is the portrait of one of the most successful country artists of the modern era. His songs have constantly charted, and his\n\nAlan Jackson\n\n31\n\nalbums have gone gold and platinum. His Oklahoma swing with its sensibility, originality, dedication, and sincerity has proven to be a winning formula.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY: Turn Me Loose, RCA MHLI-8517.

Since then countless musicians, includ-\n\n32\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\ning many modern performers, have built their careers on its grit and power. One of the New Traditionalists incorporated honky tonk elements of the past in order to gain high mileage out of his contemporary sound. His name is Alan Jackson. Alan Jackson was born on October 17, 1958, in Newnan, Georgia. He began his musical career singing in church and at home. He continued to hone his skills at selected parties, as well as in choirs and as part of a country duo. However, he was still years away from a professional career. He had more dues to pay before achieving success. He left school to sell cars and then worked construction for a few years, but the burning desire to become a professional musician remained. In his spare time, he carefully polished his talents in order to realize his ambitions. At the age of twenty, he turned professional as he was finally confident enough to sit in with other musicians. After woodshedding in a number of groups for some time, Jackson started his own band, Dixie Steel, which played in local bars and clubs to enthusiastic reviews. He continued to write songs in his spare time in an effort to work up enough material for a solid demo. He was waiting for the one big break that would open opportunities for him. Like many other aspiring musicians, Jackson boasted the invaluable support of an ambitious mate, in this case, his wife, Denise. She worked as a flight attendant, and in a chance meeting with country music legend Glen Campbell, she mentioned that her husband was a songwriter. It led to a major break as she received the phone number and address of Campbell’s publishing company. The organization was impressed with Alan’s material but urged him to continue improving his skills. Nevertheless, Jackson and his wife moved to Nashville armed with a demo tape that opened doors for him. But it wasn’t instant stardom in country music town, as the budding singer was forced to work in a mailroom and do other odd jobs. He eventually found work in a musical setting when he joined the staff of Glen Campbell Music where he contributed songs. On the side, Jackson played in local clubs where he met Keith Stegall, and the pair worked on a second demo to take around to the various record companies in town. It was this recording that led to a contract with Arista Records. In 1990, his debut album, Here in the Real World, was released and, a year later, the effort had gone platinum. On the strength of the two hit singles, “I’d Love You All Over Again” and “Someday,” his album Don’t Rock the Jukebox went double platinum. Jackson, with his matinee good looks, his solid country sound and first rate material, was heralded as a new rising force. The industry had always been eager to champion someone with his strong credentials. In 1991, Jackson joined a long list of distinguished country music fig-\n\nAlan Jackson\n\n33\n\nures when he became a member of the Grand Ole Opry. It had taken six years since his arrival in Nashville, but the hard-paid dues proved to be worth it. He rose to national prominence and his future appeared very bright. In 1992, he released A Lot About Livin’ (And a Little About Love), which spawned five Top Five singles. The first two, “She’s Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)” and “Chattahoochee,” went to number one. “Mercury Blues” stalled at the second spot, and “Tonight I Climbed the Wall” and “Who Says You Can’t Have It All” peaked at the fourth spot on the charts. The holiday album Honky Tonk Christmas was sandwiched between his previous effort and the next album, Who I Am. The latter went double platinum very quickly and boasted the number one singles “Summertime Blues,” “Gone Country,” “Livin’ on Love,” and “I Don’t Even Know Your Name.” With each successful effort, he was expanding his star status as one of the top male country acts on the circuit. For the rest of the decade, Jackson balanced strong studio releases with an increasing heavy touring schedule. The Greatest Hits Collection went triple platinum and was one of the most successful country albums to appear in 1995. By this time he was a well-established musician and one of the few who was able to hold his own during the Garth Brooks era. In 1996, Everything I Love surfaced and commenced a new era of his recording career since the material from this point on would eventually find itself on a second greatest hits package. The effort became his fourth straight release to top the country album charts, and it gave him five Top Ten hits, including the number ones “Little Bitty” (a Tom T. Hall cover), “There Goes,” “Everything I Love,” “Who’s Cheatin’ Who,” and “Between the Devil and Me.” The follow-up, High Mileage, released two years later, once again occupied the top spot and became Jackson’s highest-charting album on the pop side when it reached the fourth position. This effort contained the Top Ten singles “Right on the Money,” “I’ll Go On Loving You,” “Gone Crazy,” and “Little Man.” He possessed the ability to churn out classic collections of songs with relative ease. In 1999, he released Under the Influence, a tribute to his favorite country singers that featured material from George Jones, Merle Haggard, Charley Pride, Jimmy Buffett, Hank Williams, Jr., Don Williams and Jim Ed Brown. A successful endeavor, the album just missed topping the charts, breaking his string of number one albums. Jackson was not deterred because he returned to the studio determined to reclaim his high perch. A year later, When Somebody Loves You raced to the top of the charts upon its release on the strength of the number one single “Where I Come From.” That same year, he teamed up with George Strait for the duet “Murder on Music Row,” a defense of traditional country in the face of a new wave of pop\n\n34\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\ncrossover stars. His tough stance only added to his popularity in purists’ circles. Like so many other artists, he was greatly moved by the September 11 tragedy and relied on his musical abilities to make his statement. He wrote and recorded the poignant single “Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning),” which easily topped the country charts and became his first single to crack the pop Top Forty. It took on anthem-like proportions in the post-attack period. In 2002, he emerged with the Drive album, which spawned another number one hit, “Drive (For Daddy Gene),” a tribute to his late father. The album was his seventh to top the country charts, and it also became his first to reign on the pop charts. Despite increased competition and more than a decade in a tough business that often casts many artists aside, Jackson managed to maintain the momentum in his startling career. In 2003, his second greatest hits collection appeared and featured a crossover duet with Jimmy Buffett, “It’s Five O’clock Somewhere.” A year later the well-received What I Do became the purest country album from Jackson in years. It also included the songs “Too Much of a Good Thing” and “Monday Morning Church,” with both songs reaching the Top Five. The latter was a duet with Patty Loveless. In 2006, Precious Memories, a collection of fifteen hymns originally recorded as a Christmas gift for his mother, was released. That same year, the album Like Red on a Rose appeared and featured the Top Five hit “A Woman’s Love.” He continues to record and perform. Alan Jackson is a country music fixture. He has cleverly created a strong career based on superb songwriting, playing and material selection. He is one of the most recognizable figures in country music and a very important artist of the modern era. There are many aspects to his very successful career. He is a competent guitarist but has always been able to add an extra dimension of excitement to his rock-steady playing that gave his music an edge. For example, his workout on “Mercury Blues” gave the song energy without distancing himself from his well-known and beloved personal style. Although never confused with Chet Atkins as a guitarist, Jackson laid down some of the tastiest country licks over the years that others incorporated into their musical vocabulary. His distinctive vocals complement his good guitar work. Although not considered to be one of the great voices of country music, Jackson has a soothing appeal in his vocal delivery that speaks to each listener on an individual level. When combined with his easy instrumental skills it provides a total package that is a proven seller. His musical style is the amalgamation of his two prime influences: George Jones and Waylon Jennings. Although unable to match Jones’s calibre of\n\nAlan Jackson\n\n35\n\nsinging, Jackson has drawn on the strength of his idol’s phrasing skills. He incorporated Jennings’s gritty, bare, electrified elements, yet managed to retain a personal and individual identity. Along with Travis Tritt, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Garth Brooks, Clint Black and Ricky Van Shelton, Jackson is one of the top male stars of modern country music. He has continued the grand tradition of the genre while taking the genre in a new, exciting direction. This ability to preserve and create on an equal basis is a special skill that has always been a major highlight of his style. Alan Jackson’s band, better known as the Strayhorns, has always comprised a solid crop of musicians able to complement their leader on many different levels. They include fiddle player Dan Kelly, guitarists Tom Rutledge and Danny Groah, drummer Bruce Rutherford, fiddler Mark McClurg, keyboardists Monty Parkey and Robbie Flint, bass player Roger Willis and harmonica player Tony Stevens. Many of the members have been part of the outfit for years. For example, Rutherford joined the group in 1990. Jackson has provided the world with a number of classic songs. A short list includes “Summertime Blues,” “Livin’ on Love,” “Little Bitty,” “Who’s Cheatin’ Who,” “Here in the Real World,” “I’d Love You All Over Again,” “Someday,” “Love’s Got a Hold On You,” “She’s Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues),” “Chattahoochee,” “Gone Country,” “I Don’t Even Know Your Name,” “All I Want for Christmas Is You,” and “Mercury Blues.” Whether he covered someone else’s song or played an original, there was a definite touch in Jackson’s delivery. Jackson’s popularity has always been about more than just his catalog. His appearance on television shows like Home Improvement displayed an enhanced artistic dimension. The Ford commercial where he gave “Mercury Blues” a good workout endeared himself to a cross section of the public. His song “Where Were You (When the World Stopped Turning ),” dedicated to the victims and the aftermath to the 9/11 tragedy, demonstrated his large heart. Many of his tunes hold a special place in the annals of country music. He remains one of the most durable country music stars of the last twenty years. He is, after Garth Brooks, one of the best recognized figures of the 1990s, a solid supporter of the New Traditionalist movement. Perhaps of his multitude contributions and abilities the most important has been the consistency that has seen him write much of his material and never hit a dry period, a claim very few can make. The Alan Jackson story is about a very talented individual who made the most of his one major break. His wholesome, down-to-earth image made him one of the most accessible performers on the circuit. Combined with his abilities as musician, singer and songwriter he was able to carved out a per-\n\n36\n\nPart One: The New Traditionalists\n\nmanent niche for himself in the hearts of country music fans. He has gained high mileage out of every aspect of his career.\n\nDISCOGRAPHY: Here in the Real World, Arista 8623. Don’t Rock the Jukebox, Arista 5714.

More importantly, it bypassed the Urban Cowboy fad and pop elements that had dominated the genre at the turn of the decade. One of the leading proponents of the new style who proved that everything comes full circle was Randy Travis. Randy Bruce Traywick was born on May 4, 1959, in Marshville, North Carolina. He was encouraged to pursue his musical ambitions and picked up the guitar when he was eight years old in order to imitate his heroes Hank Williams Sr., George Jones and Lefty Frizzell. At ten, he and his brother\n\nRandy Travis\n\n37\n\nRicky formed the Traywick Brothers, a country western duo that played in local talent contests. Although music was one of their main interests, so was challenging the local authorities. Ricky went to jail in his teens, and Randy ran away from home when he was sixteen. He ended up in Charlotte and won a talent contest at Country City Bar that turned into a regular gig. He also worked as a cook and remained there for a few years despite repeated confrontations with the law. Although he might have ended up in prison like his brother, Randy escaped such a fate due to the relationship with his boss and manager, Lib Hatcher. Travis remained focused on his burgeoning musical career and landed a recording contract with the help of Joe Stampley of Paula Records. In 1978, "
