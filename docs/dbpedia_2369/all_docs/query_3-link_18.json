        "text": "UMC – 11 September 2020\n\nI have to say, Richard Thompson’s artistic integrity is second to none. It was only last August when I spoke to him on behalf of Folk Radio and the subject of the two albums from his back catalogue with Linda Thompson which, until now, remained impossible to find on CD, or indeed anything, came up. He unhesitatingly announced his dislike of them. Considering that was only just over a year ago, as well as the fact that this eight-disc box set hardly appears compiled in a hurry (quite the opposite, it is structured and presented with fantastic care and love) he surely must have known that this was in the pipeline. I can’t think of many artists who, despite having long maintained their negative position on those two long-buried albums, wouldn’t put their salesman head-on during an interview and maybe concede that there are people who seem to like them, at the very least? But no, not Richard, one year before this re-issue, he condemned two of the albums pivotal to the sets sense of completeness as “not very good records”. Actually, he pretty much dismissed any positive comment I made about any of his work on that day so I have to say, as great an artist as he undoubtedly is, on this particular topic he is not the person to take notice of. By his own admission, he has no perspective.\n\nThose two albums, 1978’s ‘First Light’ and 1979’s ‘Sunnyvista’, have long been the gaping holes in Richard & Linda Thompson’s back catalogue. Both released on Chrysalis after the couple moved from Island Records, they did get CD re-issues in the early nineties but certainly, for the last twenty years anyone looking for them has had to trawl the internet and pay over the odds, that’s if they could be found at all. Which all would naturally lead one to conclude that when setting aside the acclaimed trio of Island albums in 1974-75 and 1982’s not-quite-a-breakup LP ‘Shoot Out The Lights’, that this brace of records following a period where the couple lived off-grid in a Norfolk Muslim community village are inessential. Well, that really is so far from the truth, it is virtually a crime against music that it’s taken until now for the hard evidence to be presented in a satisfying chronological context. Put simply, Richard & Linda Thompson did not put out a bad album in their time together.\n\n‘Hard Luck Stories’ is by no means a straight albums re-issue collection. It is the serious collectors dream release with a lot of effort taken to source top quality out-takes, demos and a wealth of live recording that were not available before. And if you have been collecting other Richard & Linda re-issues over the years, well your completist efforts are not going to be made redundant. Take for example the 2004 re-release of ‘I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight’ that included a breath-taking live version of ‘The Calvary Cross’ among the bonus tracks; well that’s not included here (so you’ll need to keep that 2004 disc in your collection). What is included though is an equally wonderful, longer live version of that same track that had previously only been available on the 1976 ‘Guitar Vocal’ compilation released by Island. Also, from that 1976 compilation is the revised version of ‘A Heart Needs A Home’ which I feel is a far superior version to the familiar one that appears on ‘Hokey Pokey’.\n\nMany other loose ends are tied too. In fact, the whole of the first disc, entitled ‘Sometimes It Happens’, is dedicated to the period immediately prior to Richard & Linda’s first album as a duo. They first featured on a record together for a light-hearted Island album called ‘Rock On’, recorded quickly by a collection of the labels Folk-Rock alumni letting their hair down on a bunch of Rock ‘n’ Roll covers. Calling themselves The Bunch, the whole original album is worth checking out but of the two selections featured here, Linda’s take on ‘The Locomotion’ is an indelibly strong announcement of her vocal clout and purity of tone. There’s a couple of previously unreleased tracks from these sessions before a quite revealing example of Richard overreaching in search of his early songwriting groove. “Amazon Queen, seven feet tall, please come and see me whenever I call” indeed! Whoever convinced him to let this one out of the shadows must have a very persuasive manner. Far stronger is Linda’s singing on ‘Embroidered Butterflies’ from an ultra-rare album by the poet Brian Patten, which the couple contributed to in 1972 at the behest of Martin Carthy; it was originally released in 1976.\n\nExtra nuggets like this appear throughout the box set, which has carefully structured everything to appear as close to chronologically correct as possible. Some previously unreleased demos for the ‘Bright Lights’ album are especially interesting. ‘The End Of The Rainbow’ is often regarded as one of the bleakest songs ever committed to tape by a new father singing in reaction to his newborn child. “There’s nothing at the end of the rainbow, there’s nothing to grow up for anymore” was always quite a tough listen, but what this collection reveals is that originally it was intended for both parents to take the vocal duties; if you thought the familiar version was unflinchingly dark wait until you hear this! It’s not too hard to imagine producer John Wood backing away from that idea, “why don’t you take this one on your own Richard?”\n\nAt the centre of the rarity’s bonanza are five live recordings from London in May 1977, when the couple were emerging from their self-imposed isolation. The period has often been dismissed as an ill-advised folly by “the Muslim band”, categorised clumsily as Islamic Folk-Jazz-Rock but the recordings heard here do not back this up. Richard was perhaps tentatively easing his way back into the scene, maybe even feeling a little unsure what with the Punk explosion occurring in the mainstream. And yes, there are some jazzy keys in evidence. But this is good material, not quite the monstrosities that deserve to have fallen off the radar as Richard has previously implied. ‘Layla’ clearly re-invigorated his love for electric guitar when recorded properly the following year for ‘First Light’ while he would return to ‘A Bird In Gods Garden’ much later on the French Frith Kaiser Thompson collaboration. The set also includes a Linda vocal on ‘Night Comes In’ which alone justifies the inclusion of a set sourced from a Capitol Radio Broadcast.\n\nAs for ‘First Light’ and ‘Sunnyvista’, well all I can say is if you haven’t heard them yet your Richard & Linda catalogue is about to welcome some new favourites. In some parallel universe, the title track itself of the former LP had the potential to become another set-closing ‘Meet On The Ledge’ style anthem. Then on ‘Sunnyvista’ you have one of the best Cajun style rockers ever released. No, I am not going over the top with hyperbole here, just play ‘You’re Going To Need Somebody’ and hear for yourself. Much like when Neil Young finally relented and allowed ‘On The Beach’ to be re-issued, you marvel at how a major artist could be happy knowing material as strong as this could remain out of reach to the casual listener. Once more, both these releases are fleshed out with previously unheard period demos and unreleased songs, not to mention superbly detailed notes in the accompanying book; all treatment previously denied to this period. It is capped off with the first appearance of three Gerry Rafferty produced tracks from sessions leading up to the Thompson’s final album together.\n\nThe Gerry Rafferty part in the story during this time is almost as significant, and tumultuous, as the couple’s separation and turbulent 1982 tour that followed. Before I say anything about that I really should underline that ‘Shoot Out The Lights’ remains the classic that everyone claims it to be. OK, it can’t be the divorce album people assume because the songs had been around at least two years prior to the split, still, opener ‘Don’t Renege On Our Love’ does suggest that some storm clouds were brewing, however subconsciously. Whatever, the album itself is so good that the fact that Richard wholly rejected Rafferty’s earlier attempts to produce the sessions in a commercial vein are totally exonerated. That Link Wray rumble on his guitar truly accelerated the solo career that followed, especially in the US where it was ecstatically received by critics. However, I cannot help but feel that all this unfairly casts Rafferty as the villain of the peace.\n\nRafferty was riding high at the time on the back of ‘Baker Street’s’ incredible chart success. Richard & Linda had supported him on a UK tour and by all accounts, he sincerely wanted to help them achieve the wider recognition that they clearly deserved. With the pair having been dropped by Chrysalis, Rafferty funded the sessions for the Thompsons next album himself and set about achieving the kind of big, clean, heavily layered sound heard on his own records. As well as working on new material he also plucked ‘For Shame Of Doing Wrong’ from 1975’s ‘Pour Down Like Silver’, clearly intent on turning it into the hit single it should have been. You can sympathise with his intentions too, “I wish I was a fool for you again” is the kind of simple, relatable sentiment that hit singles are made of. Sometimes that is all you need. “I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now”. It is a straightforwardly expressed feeling like this, sung by a voice with ache and conviction, that can turn a song about a nonsensical wall into a widely loved standard that still endures after 25 years. I believe that’s what Gerry Rafferty heard in ‘For Shame Of Doing Wrong’ and with a voice like Linda’s to work with, you can hardly blame him for wanting to have a go.\n\nThe evidence on offer here, with five of the Rafferty session tracks getting an appearance, leads me to conclude it is a shame the mainstream waters weren’t tested, even if only for a single. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with his tracks, they simply have a commercial sheen and gloss that you did not associate with Richard at that point. Give him ten years or so though and the production on ‘Rumor And Sigh’ does indicate a shifting in position. What I will say though is that, when set in direct comparison to the released versions, I don’t prefer any of the earlier, more produced, versions of the ‘Shoot Out The Lights’ tracks, but it is great to now have a far more complete picture of the Richard & Linda Thompson story. Finally, for the first time ever, in fact, there is one place to go for anyone who wants the complete works of this wonderful duo in their collection. And it’s re-issued with the best quality sound and a box set package with loads to read and many carefully sourced period photos, reproduced adverts and press cuttings; exactly what you want from an essential archive trawling box set.
