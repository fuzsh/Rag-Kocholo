        "text": "Between late 1979 and the end of 1989, there were nearly 500 (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s that reached the BILLBOARD Hot 100 just one time, a list that includes Soft Cell, Gary Numan, Timbuk 3, The Church, Bronski Beat, Nik Kershaw, The Buggles, The Waitresses, Ultravox and two different bands named The Silencers. Once a week or so, I’ll highlight a (real) one-hit wonder for you.\n\nThis morning (11.4.2019), Maryhope texted me in all caps, RONALD WAKE UP PEOPLE ON TWITTER ARE ARGUING ABOUT ONE-HIT WONDERS!!!\n\nWhenever I hear about one-hit wonders in the media (like National One-Hit Wonder Day on September 25), or social media (like on Twitter this morning), I tend to cringe. Because everyone who knows me well knows I am a singles chart nerd of epic 80s proportions and I am passionate about the subject of one-hit wonders, or namely, those artists who are continually labeled as one-hit wonders who had more than one hit on the BILLBOARD Hot 100.\n\n“One-hit wonder” artists, or rather, “Forgotten one-hit wonders” as mentioned on the Twitter today, included The Bangles, who had not one, but two No. 1 songs on the Hot 100 (“Walk Like An Egyptian” and “Eternal Flame”), in addition to three other Top 5 singles, starting with their first chart hit, the Prince-composed “Manic Monday.” Kinda feels like a Manic Monday with all of these crazy tweets about what people consider are one-hit wonders.\n\nOther artists mentioned are the usual band of oft-mistaken one-hit wonders (forgotten or not) here in America: a-ha, Dead Or Alive, Terence Trent D’Arby, The Dream Academy, Eddy Grant, Fine Young Cannibals and Men Without Hats, all who had multiple Top 40 hits on the Hot 100.\n\nI have loved radio for 40 years, and I have been a part of radio (mostly community radio) for nearly 35 years, but a part of commercial radio that has always bothered me is how, somewhere over the course of time, radio programmers have chosen to just forget that many of these artists had more than one hit, and it somehow becomes radio law? To quote Prince’s brilliant “Housequake” from his equally brilliant SIGN “O” THE TIMES album, BULLSHIT!. Maybe that’s one reason commercial radio hasn’t been a fit for me. Because I can’t get behind that.\n\nI get it. Radio time on Classic Rock stations and the like is valuable. “All the hits and nothing more right here on WTF-FM!” For what it’s worth, I’m here to lobby for all those artists who are always misrepresented with the one big hit and who had more than the one big hit that people are forced to remember and nothing more.\n\nI’m also here to lobby on behalf of the nearly 500 (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s, those artists who just had the one hit on the BILLBOARD Hot 100. Some of the tweets today got a few right, like The Buggles, Nena, The Vapors, and even The California Raisins.\n\nOne of my all-time favorite (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s is British New Wavers Haircut One Hundred. Formed in Beckingham (in Greater London) in 1980 by lead vocalist and guitarist Nick Heyward and bassist Les Nemes, it didn’t take long for the six-man band for their sort of Jazzy / New Wave combo to catch on in their native U.K.\n\nThey were quickly signed to Arista Records in 1981, and in October of that year, released their first single, “Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl).” In late 1981, that horn and percussion-heavy debut single (described as “Jazz-Funk”) turned into a No. 4 U.K. hit, and was certified Silver in the U.K., selling more than 200,000 copies.\n\nIn January 1982, the next single for Haircut One Hundred, “Love Plus One,” was released a month in advance of their debut album, PELICAN WEST, with every song written or co-written by Nick Heyward.\n\nIan Birch of SMASH HITS magazine called the single “a nifty mover with plenty of interesting details” and predicted it would chart higher than “Favourite Shirts” did. He was right. “Love Plus One” was an instant hit on the U.K. singles chart, reaching No. 3 and was certified Gold with over 400,000 copies sold.\n\nThe huge success of the band’s first two singles propelled the PELICAN WEST album to even greater success, reaching No. 2 on the U.K. album chart and it was certified Platinum.\n\nOver here in America, or at least in 1982, music from away sometimes take awhile to catch on and reach the States, and in most cases (not always), it works out. “Love Plus One” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in late May 1982, four months after its initial release.\n\nIt took its time climbing the Hot 100, but “Love Plus One” eventually reached the Top 40 in mid-July 1982, peaked at No. 37 a few weeks later, and spent 17 weeks on the Hot 100, departing the chart in early September 1982.\n\nHaircut One Hundred would not grace the Hot 100 again. However, “Love Plus One” did cross over to BILLBOARD’s Mainstream Rock chart (No. 18) and BILLBOARD’s Dance chart (No. 8). It also reached the Top 3 in Canada and France. The success of “Love Plus One” also brought success to PELICAN WEST on the BILLBOARD album chart.\n\nNERDY FUN FACT: If it wasn’t for One Hundred and One, Haircut One Hundred might not have been a (real) one-hit wonder here in America. “Favourite Shirts” just missed the Hot 100 in 1981, stopping at No. 101.\n\nThe overall success of Haircut One Hundred, however, was sadly short-lived. They did reach the Top 10 of the U.K. singles chart with their next two singles, 1982’s “Fantastic Day” (from PELICAN WEST) and “Nobody’s Fool.”\n\nTheir next single, “Whistle Down The Wind,” was postponed in early 1983, and it was announced that Nick Heyward was leaving Haircut One Hundred for a solo career. Nick would go on to have a long solo career, with nine albums released between 1983 and 2017, and reached the Top 40 in the U.K. with six times, led by the aforementioned “Whistle Down The Wind,” which you can hear during one of the dance scenes in the 1984 John Hughes classic, SIXTEEN CANDLES.\n\nHaircut One Hundred, meanwhile, tried to carry on without Nick Heyward, but with their lead singer and primary songwriter gone, also gone was the chemistry. In 1984, they released an album called PAINT AND PAINT, which was not well-received and sealed the fate of the band for 20 years.\n\nIn 2004, Nick Heyward reunited with Haircut One Hundred on VH1’s BANDS REUNITED show, and performed again from 2009 through 2013. While no new Haircut One Hundred albums are in the works, in a 2017 interview with BBC Radio 4, Nick Heyward said he “has a deep love for the band,” and he is “ever hopeful” for a reunion show.\n\nIn the meantime, I am forever grateful that Haircut One Hundred, one of my all-time favorite (real) one-hit wonders, gave us the gorgeous “Love Plus One,” one of my all-time favorite songs ever…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_msHpEa3_Y\n\nThere’s one thing I consistently wish for every Christmas, and that’s peace. I’m sure I’m not the only one. John Lennon was one of those people. In the Spring of 1969, during of the Vietnam War, in a hotel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, John Lennon and Yoko Ono wrote a song that became this huge anthem for the anti-war movement here in America during the 1970s. That song is “Give Peace A Chance.”\n\nThe recording session took place at that Montreal hotel on June 1, 1969, and featured many journalists and celebrities, including Timothy Leary, Petula Clark, and Tom Smothers of The Smothers Brothers even played acoustic guitar with John Lennon on “Give Peace A Chance.”\n\nIt was released a month later, and became the first solo single released by a Beatle (the band was still together at that point), though it was credited to the Plastic Ono Band, and not directly John Lennon. The song was a huge success, reaching No. 1 in The Netherlands, and the Top 10 in a least a handful of other countries, including the U.K., where it reached No. 2. It peaked at No. 14 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 here in America in early September 1969.\n\nFollowing the tragic death of John Lennon on December 8, 1980, “Give Peace A Chance” (along with many other of his songs) re-entered the U.K. singles chart, and in 1981, peaked at No. 33.\n\nOver the years, the song has been covered by the likes of U2, Hot Chocolate, Joni Mitchell, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Louis Armstrong, Aerosmith, and even by Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, as a tribute (and testament) to John Lennon and his message to “Give Peace A Chance.”\n\nIn 1991, Yoko Ono and her son with John, Sean Ono Lennon, along with Lenny Kravitz, spearheaded a new version of the song in response to (what eventually became) the Gulf War. This version recruited many artists from all over the music landscape, including Cyndi Lauper, Peter Gabriel, Ofra Haza, Adam Ant, Terence Trent D’Arby, Dave Stewart, Bruce Hornsby, Little Richard, LL Cool J, Michael McDonald, Wendy & Lisa, Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt, Little Steven Van Zandt, Don Was, Iggy Pop, MC Hammer, Sebastian Bach of Skid Row, Randy Newman, and members of the Zappa family, including Dweezil and Moon Unit.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to find peace, especially this time of year. Right now, the so-called “leader” of America is responsible for a partial government shutdown because he didn’t get funding for an unnecessary border wall between the United States and Mexico. Millions of Americans (including many government workers) are affected by this partial shutdown this holiday season, something they had nothing to do with. Will they have peace this holiday season? One can hope.\n\nBack in November 1989, people were tired of the long-standing Berlin Wall separating East and West Berlin (and Germany as a whole), and the fall of the Berlin Wall began. Within two years, the Wall was removed, save for sections serving as a memorial. East Germany and West Germany became one Germany. That was almost three decades ago. So, what’s happening here in America? Why can’t Mr. Trump take his DeLorean and go back in time to see why it’s wrong to build up walls, and why people don’t want them?\n\nMuch like Germany back in the 80s, the United States of America is not so united these days, sadly. The country is split in two, like there’s a wall between it. When you build walls, whether it’s between countries or within yourself, there’s no room for peace. When you build walls around you, you shut everyone else out. Mr. Trump’s vision is limited because there is a wall in front of it.\n\nI think John Lennon, who so loved this country, would have been deeply disappointed about today’s America. But, I also think he would have done everything he could to give peace that chance it so deserves. And I know he would have loved the fact that his 49-year-old anthem for peace is still cherished by millions around the globe today.\n\nMy annual Christmas wish for peace for everyone will continue to be my wish. Happy Xmas everyone…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yU0JuE1jTk\n\nOn June 15, 2014, Casey Kasem, host of the longtime countdown program, AMERICAN TOP 40, passed away at the age of 82. From my first blog post (and prolly some more inbetween then and now), I explained how, in 1979, I was a geeky, lanky and somewhat lost 12-year-old living in Central Maine, had a few friends and not a lot of interest in much of anything, but at some point early that year, I discovered AMERICAN TOP 40, and was glued to it every weekend. Not only could I hear the 40 biggest songs in the country every week, but also Casey’s cool trivia and facts about the songs and the artists, a trait I treasure to this day. For me, the show was No. 1 with a bullet. And still is (thanks to the re-airing of broadcasts of AT40 on iHeart Radio).\n\nIn honor of my radio hero, Casey Kasem, for the entire month of June (and now through July), I will be highlighting a song each day (some days will have two songs!) that peaked in the Top 40 of the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (including five (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s), and with every blog post, just like on AMERICAN TOP 40, the hits will get bigger with each post. On June 1, 2017, I featured a song that peaked at No. 40. Sometime here in July, I’ll feature a “song of the day” that went all the way to No. 1.\n\nAs Casey used to say on AT40, “And on we go!”\n\nBetween late 1979 and the end of 1989, there were nearly 500 (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s that reached the BILLBOARD Hot 100 just one time, a list that includes Soft Cell, Gary Numan, Timbuk 3, The Church, Bronski Beat, Nik Kershaw, The Buggles, The Waitresses, Ultravox and two different bands named The Silencers. Once a week, I’ll highlight a (real) one-hit wonder for you.\n\nThe nearly 80 songs that reached the No. 4 position on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 between 1979 and 1989 had a bit of everything – Top 40 newbies which included Irene Cara (“Fame”), Asia (“Heat Of The Moment”), Samantha Fox (“Touch Me (I Want Your Body)”), the first two hits by Debbie Gibson (“Only In My Dreams,” “Shake Your Love”), Rickie Lee Jones (“Chuck E.’s In Love”), Suzi Quatro & Chris Norman (“Stumblin’ In”), Run-D.M.C. (“Walk This Way”), and Spandau Ballet (“True”).\n\nSongs that reached No. 4 also included the biggest U.S. chart hits for Howard Jones (“No One Is To Blame”), Electric Light Orchestra (“Don’t Bring Me Down”), Eddie Money (“Take Me Home Tonight”), OMD (“If You Leave”), Soul II Soul (“Back To Life”), Teena Marie (“Lovergirl”), The Fixx (“One Thing Leads To Another”) and Tommy Tutone (“867-5309/Jenny”).\n\nSome of my all-time favorite songs reached No. 4 as well, like “Urgent” by Foreigner, “Eyes Without A Face” by Billy Idol, “Mandolin Rain” by Bruce Hornsby & The Range, “Give Me The Night” by George Benson, Terence Trent D’Arby’s “Sign Your Name,” “Sultans Of Swing” by Dire Straits, “Freeze-Frame” by The J. Geils Band and “Cruisin’” by Smokey Robinson.\n\nMultiple artists hit No. 4 more than once, including Lionel Richie (one solo and two with the Commodores), Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac (who spent an agonizing then-record seven weeks at No. 4 with 1982’s “Hold Me”), the aforementioned Debbie Gibson, Madonna, Phil Collins (one solo and two with Genesis), Ray Parker, Jr. (one solo and one with Raydio), and Stevie Wonder.\n\nTwo memorable Elvis covers also reached No. 4 – “Don’t Be Cruel” by Cheap Trick and “Always On My Mind” by Pet Shop Boys (the highest-charting version of that song here in America).\n\nTwo (real) one-hit wonders of the 80s reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 between 1979 and 1989. The first one was Taco, the German musician whose spirited version of Irving Berlin’s “Puttin’ On The Ritz” reached No. 4 in September 1983, and was a huge international hit.\n\nThe second (real) one-hit wonder of the 80s to reach No. 4 was a British Pop / Rock band whose lead singer, Carol Decker, hailed from Liverpool, and the band’s name came from a character in the original STAR TREK from the 60s – T’Pau, the name of a Vulcan elder. Before deciding on a name for the band, their working name was Talking America.\n\nT’Pau formed in 1986 as a six-member band and released their debut single, “Heart And Soul,” in late April 1987, a month in advance of their debut album, BRIDGE OF SPIES. One of the memorable things about “Heart And Soul” is that Carol Decker is in a duet with herself, courtesy of overlapping vocals.\n\nA couple of weeks after its release, “Heart And Soul” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in early May 1987 at No. 91. It landed in the Top 40 six weeks into its chart run, steadily climbing on the chart until peaking at No. 4 for a week in early August 1987, the month it was released in in their U.K. homeland. During this time, it was also featured in a Pepe Jeans ad, though I can’t really say I even remember Pepe Jeans. But, it seemed to help the song’s chart success.\n\nDespite that chart success here in America, “Heart And Soul” did not fare well in the U.K. upon its release, but eventually the U.K. warmed up to the song, and it, too, reached No. 4. Outside of the U.S. and the U.K., “Heart And Soul” reached No. 4 in Ireland, No. 5 in Canada, No. 9 in New Zealand and Switzerland, No. 10 in France and Germany, and the Top 20 in Australia, Belgium, South Africa, Sweden and the BILLBOARD Dance chart.\n\nThanks to its 27 weeks on the Hot 100, “Heart And Soul” finished 1987 here in the U.S. at No. 33 for the year, above No. 1 hits by Kim Wilde, George Michael and Aretha Franklin, Huey Lewis & The News, Madonna and two No. 1 songs by Michael Jackson.\n\nThough T’Pau never charted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 again, their biggest international success came with another single from BRIDGE OF SPIES – “China In Your Hand,” which was a massive No. 1 hit in several countries, including the U.K. and Switzerland (5 weeks at No. 1), Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands (2 weeks), plus a No. 1 rank in Norway, and Top 10 rankings in (at least) Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Poland and Sweden.\n\nT’Pau is still together today, though from the original six-member band, the only members left are “Heart And Soul” co-writers Carol Decker and rhythm guitarist / songwriter Ronnie Rogers. In early 2015, they released their fifth studio album, PLEASURE & PAIN, which became their first-charting U.K. album in nearly 25 years.\n\nFor this album, Carol Decker expressed her frustration through an interview about her new music not being played vs. the radio stations being only interested in playing their 80s classics: “It’s a little harder to get on the radio because all the ‘80s stations play the ‘80s stuff and they won’t play your new stuff. They actually say they can’t, and then the younger stations play the younger artists, the hip stations. That’s the downside, and I miss hearing radio plays for the new stuff… it is a little frustrating that I can’t get it out to the wider audience anymore.”\n\nThis is just one of many reasons why I need to (soon) start the next incarnation of my radio show, STUCK IN THE 80s, so I can highlight the new music, like I did on my longtime show with WMPG.\n\nThough I honestly never kept up with T’Pau (partially because of the one hit here), I always loved “Heart And Soul,” and continue to introduce it to folks when I can (I recently guest-hosted a show on WMPG with my former radio neighbor, DJ Shaxx, and he fell in love with it when we played it on the air).\n\nThank you, Carol and Ronnie, for putting some needed “Heart And Soul” into my music for 1987. 30 years later, it’s not forgotten…\n\n“Give a little bit of heart and soul / Give a little bit of love to grow / Give a little bit of heart and soul / And don’t you make me beg for more / Give a sign, I need to know / A little bit of heart and soul…”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwrYMWoqg5w\n\nOn June 15, 2014, Casey Kasem, host of the longtime countdown program, AMERICAN TOP 40, passed away at the age of 82. From my first blog post (and prolly some more inbetween then and now), I explained how, in 1979, I was a geeky, lanky and somewhat lost 12-year-old living in Central Maine, had a few friends and not a lot of interest in much of anything, but at some point early that year, I discovered AMERICAN TOP 40, and was glued to it every weekend.

On June 1, 2017, I featured a song that peaked at No. 40. On June 30, I’ll feature a “song of the day” that went all the way to No. 1.\n\nAs Casey used to say on AT40, “And on we go!”\n\nI have to say, as a self-proclaimed singles chart nerd, researching for each blog post in this tribute to Casey Kasem has been pretty awesome. Casey would often say, “As the numbers get smaller, the hits get bigger!” That may also true with how many songs peak at each position. For the songs that reached No. 30 between 1979 and 1989, there were over 40.\n\nWhat I found interesting (to me, anyway) is that, out of these 40+ songs that peaked at No. 30 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100, there were only two (real) one-hit wonders. Also, I’ve already highlighted five No. 30 hits – (real) one-hit wonder Frankie Smith and “Double Dutch Bus,” “The One Thing” by INXS, “The Prisoner” by Howard Jones, Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” and “Space Age Love Song” by A Flock Of Seagulls (one of my favorite blog pieces so far; from September 2016).\n\nAnother interesting quirk is that there are a lot of big-name artists who had No. 30 hits, but the hits themselves have been largely forgotten, including songs by The Bangles (“Be With You,” 1989), Tina Turner (“Two People,” 1987), Kool & The Gang (“Let’s Go Dancin’,” 1983), and two each by Daryl Hall & John Oates (“How Does It Feel To Be Back,” 1980, and “Possession Obsession,” 1985) and Toto (“Make Believe,” 1982, and “Stranger In Town,” 1984).\n\nYet another interesting fact is how there were so many memorable hits from other decades that stopped at No. 30 (like Iron Butterfly’s classic “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” Ted Nugent’s “Cat Scratch Fever,” the brilliant “Walk On By” by Isaac Hayes, “Come Monday” by Jimmy Buffet, “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers, “Our House” by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, “She Talks To Angels” by The Black Crowes, “Firestarter” by Prodigy, R.E.M.’s wonderful “Man On The Moon,” the amazing “Love Is The Drug” by Roxy Music, and one of THE BEST pieces of music for all time, “Give It To Me” by The J. Geils Band), and yet, with the songs that peaked at No. 30 in the 80s, for whatever reason, most of those songs have been forgotten.\n\nThankfully, though, there were a handful of cool ones, too. There’s the aforementioned ones I’ve already posted on the blog, but then there’s “Dance Little Sister” by Terence Trent D’Arby, “Love Will Find A Way” by Yes, The Human League’s “Mirror Man,” and “Lies,” the first big American hit by a New Wave / Synthpop trio who weren’t at all related – Sheffield, England’s Thompson Twins.\n\nThe trio of Tom Bailey, Alannah Currie and Joe Leeway made up the Thompson Twins in 1982, a time when MTV was so popular, it was affecting what was bought in stores and what was played on the radio, and a time when New Wave was becoming more prominent in mainstream music. 1982 was also the start of the Second British Invasion on the U.S. singles chart, which lasted through 1986. Thompson Twins were a big part of that.\n\nBy 1982, Tom, Alannah and Joe already had one No. 1 song to their credit here in America – “In The Name Of Love,” which spent five weeks at No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart in May and June 1982.\n\nIn October 1982, they released “Lies,” the first single from their upcoming third album, QUICK STEP AND SIDE KICK. The band was still looking for their audience in their U.K. homeland, and it stopped at No. 67 on the U.K. singles chart there.\n\n“Lies” would find an audience here in America a few months later, and it debuted at No. 80 on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in late January 1983, a couple of weeks after it spent two weeks at No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s Dance chart (with its B-side, “Beach Culture”).\n\nAs “Lies” made its climb up the Hot 100, the song’s parent album was released in February 1983, and with the Twins being signed to Arista Records, that meant, well, much like fellow Brits (The) Icicle Works in 1984, a name change for the album in the U.S. and Canada. So, the name of the album was shortened to just SIDE KICKS.\n\nA month after the album’s release, “Lies” found its way to the Top 40. By the end of March 1983, it reached No. 30, but got stuck there for three weeks, and was gone from the Top 40 after that. It stayed on the Hot 100 for a respectable total of about four months. “Lies” also reached No. 6 in New Zealand and the Top 30 in Australia and Canada.\n\nThough the “Lies” follow-up single, “Love On Your Side” would fail to reach the Top 40 here in the U.S. (it stopped at No. 45 in early June 1983), Thompson Twins would finally find their U.K. audience, and that song was their first of five Top 10 hits, reaching No. 9. QUICK STEP AND SIDE KICK was also certified Platinum there and reached No. 2 on the U.K. album chart.\n\nI loved Thompson Twins from the start. I reserved any quick-stepping and side-kicking for at-home dancing, but I was a fan as soon as I heard “Lies.” Not only was I hooked by the music, but I really enjoyed Tom Bailey’s style of singing. Don’t know if there’s a particular name for it, I just enjoyed it. All these years later, I would put his vocal style in the same high class as Howard Jones and Cy Curnin of The Fixx. They also had one of the coolest band logos.\n\nIt was pretty cool seeing them on the TV performing with Madonna at Live Aid. What I didn’t know was that it was the beginning of the end for the trio I knew and loved as Thompson Twins.\n\nAfter Joe Leeway left the Twins in 1986, Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie kept the band and the name going until 1993, when they changed it to Babble, reflecting a change in musical direction from New Wave to “dub-influenced chill-out” (mixing Electronica, World Beat, Alt-Dance and Club styles).\n\nAs Babble, Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie (who were married at the time and living in New Zealand) released a couple of albums before calling it quits in 1996. Alannah Currie retired from music, and they were divorced in 2003 (though they remain friends).\n\nTom Bailey now lives in London with his second wife, he took part in the 2014 version of the Retro Futura Tour as “Thompson Twins’ Tom Bailey” and earlier this year on “The ‘80s Cruise,” an annual event of which I hope to attend at some point. Under the moniker of “Thompson Twins’ Tom Bailey,” he released a single last year called “Come So Far,” and has another one scheduled for release this year.\n\nWhen I think of Thompson Twins, the first songs that come to mind are “Lay Your Hands On Me,” “Hold Me Now,” “If You Were Here” (from SIXTEEN CANDLES), “Sugar Daddy,” “In The Name Of Love” (both the 1982 and 1988 versions), their kick-ass cover of The Beatles’ “Revolution,” “Doctor! Doctor!” and “Love On Your Side,” but it was all “Lies” that made me fall in love with those three non-related kids back in 1982, who were, at one time, Twins…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVHwD58Ne3Y\n\n“The horses are on the track…”\n\nIn September 1983, with what was prolly the beginning of the end for The Clash, Mick Jones, the legendary band’s lead guitarist, co-lead vocalist and songwriter since their inception in 1976, was fired from the band. Punctuality (or lack thereof) was a prominent factor in his dismissal from The Clash.\n\nNot long after getting booted from “the only band that mattered,” Mick Jones did something that prolly felt natural for him – he helped start another band – General Public, which was founded with The English Beat’s Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger, from the ashes of that band, which broke up in 1983.\n\nBut, the association Mick Jones had with General Public was quite short-lived. Although his name is featured on the credits of General Public’s debut album, …ALL THE RAGE (he did play guitar on “Tenderness,” “Never You Done That” and at least three other songs), Mick left during the recording of the album. I think had Mick stayed with Dave and Roger and General Public, it would have been quite interesting and amazing. But, I can’t be mad at Mick and forgive him for leaving because…\n\n…in 1984, Mick went on to co-found the Post-Punk, Alt-Dance band, Big Audio Dynamite, with film director Don Letts, who had previously directed a number of Clash videos and later the 2000 Clash documentary, WESTWAY TO THE WORLD, which picked up a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Long Form Video.\n\nThe first album for Mick’s third band in two years, the appropriately-titled THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE, was released in October 1985, interestingly enough, the month before the release of CUT THE CRAP, the last album by The Clash, which most folks thought was, well, crap (save for tracks like “This Is England”).\n\nWhen ROLLING STONE’s David Fricke reviewed CUT THE CRAP in January 1986, THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE got mentions as well: “If CUT THE CRAP is a cheat, then Mick Jones’ new band Big Audio Dynamite is an unexpected gamble. ‘That old time groove is really nowhere,’ Jones shrugs in ‘The Bottom Line,’ brusquely dismissing [Joe] Strummer’s retropunk didacticism. Instead, he continues, ‘I’m gonna take you to part two,’ which on THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE is an intoxicating subversion of Eighties dance-floor cool with SANDINISTA!’s dub-funk turmoil… THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE hardly transcends the Clash’s finest hours, but for Jones it is a new beginning. With CUT THE CRAP, one might well wonder if Joe Strummer’s at the end of the road.” David was right – The Clash broke up in early 1986. Many folks, yours truly included, thought they had already broken up long before then.\n\nBut, with songs like “E=MC2,” “Medicine Show,” “C’Mon Every Beatbox” and “BAD” (featured in the 1986 John Hughes classic, FERRIS BUELLER’S DAY OFF), Big Audio Dynamite and THIS IS BIG AUDIO DYNAMITE were thriving. The album was certified Gold in their U.K. homeland, and reached the Top 10 in New Zealand.\n\nThe first single released from the album (and the only song on the album solely written by Mick Jones) was “The Bottom Line.” It was also the first song by B.A.D. that made me fall in love with the band, though not until 1987, when one of my (future) best friends, Michael, introduced me to them. “The Bottom Line” did not fare well in the U.K. (where it reached a surprising No. 97 chart peak), but it was a Top 40 hit in Australia, New Zealand and BILLBOARD’s Dance chart.\n\nThere were at least a couple of different remixes for “The Bottom Line,” and though I enjoy the U.S. 12” mix by Rick Rubin, I have always favored (and will always prefer) the original and glorious 8-minute, 40-second U.K. 12” Remix. Not only does it mirror the 4:35 album version, but when the album version is ready to cut out, in the U.K. Remix, Mick and Co. actually DO take you to Part Two (“I’m gonna take you to, I’m gonna take you to part two, part two…”)\n\nNearly 32 years after its release, it’s interesting how the song’s lyrics could still apply today:\n\n“A dance to the tune off economic decline / Is when you do the bottom line / Nagging questions always remain / Why did it happen and who was to blame\n\n“When you reach the bottom line / The only thing to do is climb / Pick yourself up off the floor / Don’t know what you’re waiting for\n\n“They’ve been doing it down at the zoo / And I can show ya here’s what to do / All of the States and over UK / Even the Soviets are swinging away…\n\n“So when you reach the bottom line / The only thing to do is climb / Pick yourself up off the floor / Anything you want is yours…”\n\nApart from a 2011 reunion, Big Audio Dynamite (and later, the successful Big Audio Dynamite II) stopped years ago, but Mick (who turns 62 in June 2017) is still keeping busy, performing in recent years with the live band for the popular U.K. Alt-Rock / Electronica band, Gorillaz, and on albums for Alt-Rockers, The Wallflowers, and Algerian singer, Rachid Taha (who released a brilliant Arabic cover of “Rock The Casbah” in 2004).\n\nAll these years later, my bottom line on “The Bottom Line” is that it’s still so infectious (especially the original 12” U.K. Remix) and amazing to dance to or listen to in the car, or anywhere. And, if for some Godforsaken reason you have never heard this song, click on the link to the original video below, or take the next 10 minutes, find the link to the original 12” U.K. Remix and get ready to move. It may not be that “new dance that’s going around” anymore, but “when the hits start flying,” you’re GONNA get down. And then you’re gonna “pick yourself up off the floor” and do it again…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V5Zoe84BjE\n\nAs you’ve probably heard by now, boxing legend Muhammad Ali passed away late last night (6.3.2016) at the age of 74. He was just three months older than my dad. Like many others around the world, I’ve been combing through the vast amount of amazing and memorable quotes from “The Greatest” during his lifetime, and here are three that are favorites of mine:\n\n“The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up.”\n\n“The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.”\n\n“People don’t realize what they had till it’s gone. Like President Kennedy, there was no one like him, the Beatles, and my man Elvis Presley. I was the Elvis of boxing.”\n\nI saw another quote about Muhammed Ali that inspired today’s “song of the day” – from the artist formerly known as Terence Trent D’Arby.\n\nTerence Trent D’Arby was born Terence Trent Howard in Manhattan, NYC, and just 4 months after his 25th birthday, he released his first album, INTRODUCING THE HARDLINE ACCORDING TO TERENCE TRENT D’ARBY. Like Muhammad Ali, Terence was cocky, confident and brilliant, and he even compared his confidence to Ali’s in an interview with MELODY MAKER magazine:\n\n“Tell people long enough and loud enough you’re the greatest and eventually they’ll believe you. And once they believe you’re the greatest, you become the greatest.” Two weeks after the album was released, Terence was the greatest – in the U.K., where INTRODUCING THE HARDLINE… spent its first week at No. 1 on the U.K. album chart (it would return to No. 1 there for two months between January and March 1988).\n\nIt took awhile longer for Terence to become the greatest in his U.S. homeland. The album wasn’t released here until October 1987, and his first single, “If You Let Me Stay,” at Top 10 hit in the U.K., stalled at No. 68 here. The second single, however, fared much, much better.\n\n“Wishing Well” debuted on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 in mid-January 1988, the lowest new entry at No. 79 (the highest was George Michael’s “Father Figure” at No. 49). “Wishing Well” reached the Top 40 (at No. 40) the same week “Father Figure” vaulted to No. 1. But, “Wishing Well” took its time (17 weeks), and, for one week in early May 1988, Terence Trent D’Arby and “Wishing Well” were both the greatest on the BILLBOARD Hot 100 (while “Father Figure” was spending its last week on the entire chart). It spent a week shy of a half-year on the Hot 100, and finished the year here in the U.S. at No. 11.\n\nAround the globe, Terence Trent D’Arby didn’t have to wish for success for “Wishing Well” – the song reached No. 1 in Holland, No. 2 in Canada, No. 4 in the U.K. and New Zealand, No. 5 in Switzerland, No. 9 in Australia, and No. 10 in Austria. It also reached No. 1 on BILLBOARD’s R&B chart and No. 7 on the Dance chart.\n\nTerence would return to the Hot 100 with two more songs from INTRODUCING THE HARDLINE… – the beautiful “Sign Your Name” (one of the sexiest songs of the 80s; No. 4) and “Dance Little Sister” (No. 30), and from his third album, 1993’s SYMPHONY OR DAMN, the gorgeous (and highly underrated) “Delicate,” which stopped at No. 74. “Delicate” featured vocals from London Soul singer Des’Ree, who had a huge of her own in 1994 with “You Gotta Be.”\n\nAfter four albums under the name of Terence Trent D’Arby (the last, 1995’s VIBRATOR), he legally changed his name in 2001 to Sananda Maitreya, which, according to a 2003 interview, he said related to a series of dreams he had back in 1995. In 2002, Sananda moved to Milan, Italy, and he has released albums primarily through his website, including 2015’s 2-CD, 27-track THE RISE OF THE ZUGEBRIAN TIME LORDS.\n\nI still love the music of Terence Trent D’Arby, especially his singles, and though I remember him more as Terence than Sananda, I admire him for changing his name and making the most of his life, and continuing to do what he loves to do, much like my admiration of Cassius Clay changing his name to Muhammed Ali.\n\nYou know, I’ve never been a fan of boxing (though I have enjoyed boxing movies, oddly enough). I am just old enough to remember Muhammad Ali the fighter and I loved watching him in and out of the ring. He was brilliant, cocky, confident, funny, didn’t take any shit and stood up for what he believed in.\n\nFrom one of those quotes I mentioned before, “People don’t realize what they had till it’s gone.” It’s so true. And now, “The Greatest” is gone. And there was definitely no one like him. R.I.P. Muhammed Ali, and many, many thanks…\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynIHsHYaig0"
