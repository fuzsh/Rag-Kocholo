        "text": "I've recently been enjoying their album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight, widely considered the duo's finest hour. I haven't heard any other albums by them but if that one is any indication it's a real shame they couldn't continue making albums and touring together for much longer, even on amicable terms if no longer as a married couple - there is/was a real chemistry between them, Linda's beautiful vocals really well complemented by Richard's great guitar playing and singing (my favourite duet with them is Down Where the Drunkards Roll; I love his mock bass harmonies on that song).\n\nThis probably belongs more in off topic if the reasons were purely personal, but I was just wondering what caused them to fall so badly apart? Apparently things got so acrimonious towards the end of their marriage that they could barely get on stage together without a physical fight breaking out. Was it just a mutual falling out, or was one party more to blame than the other? I hear they have toured together again recently, so are they at least friends again or just get along well enough to agree to make music together for the sake of their fans?\n\nThey haven't toured together, but as they have a son (Teddy), they have seemingly patched things over the years. He was on her \"Fashionably Late\" album.\n\nNot to be nitpicky, but I believe it's Trevor Lucas (a.k.a. Sandy Denny's husband) singing the low harmony on Down Where the Drunkards Roll.\n\nThe final tour after Shoot Out the Lights was quite the spectacle...the marriage was breaking up in the middle of it and Linda was getting drunk a lot and doing stuff like throwing things at Richard on stage. Not much hope of keeping the act together under those circumstances, and then Linda had the problem with her voice that kept her from singing for years. They do seem to be getting along tolerably enough now, but I wouldn't expect a reunion tour. (I don't know how much touring Linda does these days in any case.)\n\nRelations are much better now. Check out RT and LT playing a nice version of \"Go Leave\" from the Meltdown Festival (A Celebration of Kate McGarrigle) in 2010. Quite by chance I met Linda and her grandson, Zak Hobbs, on the Tube the folowing week. Both were very chatty. They (and I) were on their way to see Elvis Costello at the Royal Festival Hall. RT played on the encore with EC that night.\n\nThe affair that Richard had was only the tip of the iceberg as it brought out other issues between them although Linda was completely in the dark as to how Richard was feeling about their marriage.\n\nYes, he's still married to Nancy and they have been able to put their issues behind them. Richard actually played on \"Fashionably Late\" as I recall as well.\n\nThey did actually record five more albums after I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight in an eight-year run, and even Shoot Out The Lights was recorded in a positive spirit, ominous title and song subject matter aside, with the issues then as I understand them being more about original producer Gerry Rafferty than each other. (Rafferty was replaced before the album went out). Then they went on tour, and issues that had just begun to swirl took their toll in a hurry.\n\nWell, that's because as I recall while they were recording it they weren't breaking up. That came AFTER the album was completed as I recall and Richard's affair began when he did a series of solo acoustic shows.\n\nAs Slokes notes much of the material had been written and recorded (a couple of years before) prior to \"Shoot\"'s offical release on the aborted Rafferty/Hugh Murphy sessions (some of which turned up on \"Watching the Dark\" and Linda's single disc anthology on Ryko).\n\nI've never heard this being given as a contributory cause.\n\nIt's not difficult to see that the couple were under very considerable pressures at this point one way or another. I don't think that there's a single definitive factor.\n\nDid anybody find the following remark in an Uncut interview from their May issue earlier this year? It looks like he's considering a Richard & Linda Thompson reunion. I found this remark to be very surprising:\n\nI see Linda all the time. But I'm not often onstage with her. I'm over 60 now, and there's a sense of urgency. That you're not going on forever. So all those projects you've been promising yourself to do, you'd better get on with them."
