        "text": "Long before I ever heard of Richard Thompson by name, I was familiar with Fairport Convention. But I never owned any of the group’s albums until friends of mine, unloading their vinyl in favor of the shiny new technology called compact disc, gave me a few. I learned that he was the nifty guitarist.\n\nI still only have one of his CDs. Or more properly, it was the last of several albums by Richard and Linda Thompson.\n\nI’ve told the story before, back in 2011. I owned nine of the Top 10 on the “Rolling Stone – The 100 Greatest Albums Of The 80s”, as they were dubbed in the mid 1990s: London Calling. Purple Rain. The Joshua Tree. Remain In Light. Graceland. Born In The U.S.A. Thriller. Murmur. Shoot Out The Lights? Tracy Chapman.\n\nI was given #9 on the list by co-workers for some occasion, Christmas or my birthday, and understood very quickly why it was so well-regarded.\n\nI do have one other CD, which I recommend. Beat the Retreat: The Songs of Richard Thompson, is a 1994 compilation disc of covers by an eclectic roster, including Maddy Prior, June Tabor, David Byrne, X, and Los Lobos. As more than one critic suggested, fans of Thompson will disagree on which of the cuts they like/hate on the album. Here are the REM and Bob Mould cuts.\n\nThere’s one song in Richard Thompson’s oeuvre that continues to affect me greatly, the autumnal Dimming of the Day. I may have heard it first by Bonnie Raitt on her 1994 Longing in Their Hearts album. The Blind Boys of Alabama perform it on Beat the Retreat.\n\nThis old house is falling down around my ears\n\nI’m drowning in a river of my tears\n\nWhen all my will is gone you hold me sway\n\nAnd I need you at the dimming of the day\n\nYou pulled me like the moon pulls on the tide\n\nYou know just where I keep my better side\n\nRichard Thompson has a vast discography which I need to investigate.\n\nListen to:\n\nFairport Convention\n\nCrazy Man Michael\n\nSloth\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson\n\nI Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight\n\nA Heart Needs A Home\n\nDimming Of The Day – Dargai\n\nYou’re Going To Need Somebody\n\nShoot Out the Lights album\n\nDimming of the Day\n\nBonnie Raitt & Richard Thompson\n\nMary Black\n\nFive Blind Boys Of Alabama\n\nMore Richard Thompson here.\n\nListening to Telling Me Lies from the Trio album (1987) always affects me greatly. Part of it is the tight harmony among Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, and Emmylou Harris.\n\nThe song was the album’s second single, and it reached #3 on the US Billboard country singles charts. The recording was nominated for a Grammy award in 1988 for Country Song of the Year.\n\nThe message is painful:\n\nYou told me you needed my company\n\nAnd I believed in your flattering ways\n\nYou told me you needed me forever\n\nNearly gave you the rest of my days\n\nShould’ve seen you for what you are\n\nShould never have come back for more\n\nShould’ve locked up all my silver\n\nBrought the key right to your door\n\nThe song first appeared on Linda Thompson’s One Clear Moment album (1985), her first solo collection “after divorcing husband and former collaborator, Richard Thompson.” The track was written by Linda Thompson and Betsy Cook, as were most of the songs on the album, which many critics believed included many well-written songs, often marred by that era’s heavy-handed production.\n\nDon’t put your life in the hands of a man\n\nWith a face for every season\n\nDon’t waste your time in the arms of a man\n\nWho’s no stranger to treason\n\nListen to Telling Me Lies:\n\nLinda Thompson here\n\nDolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris here or here\n\nI cover my ears, I close my eyes\n\nStill hear your voice and it’s telling me lies\n\nTelling me lies\n\n***\n\nFor good measure, another 1980s female trio with tight harmonies, though a somewhat different style:\n\nYou work too hard to take this abuse\n\nBe on your guard jerks on the loose\n\nListen to Keep On Doing What You Do/ Jerks On The Loose – the Roches, written by by Terre and Suzzy Roche, from the Keep On Doing album (1982)\n\nSomeone I knew personally died last week; he’s the third one in 2012, and the year is only a third over. He was a guy named Nate. I knew him because he represented his agency, the state Department of Transportation, in the same way I represent mine within the New York State Data Center Affiliate program. Early on, he would speak in such technical terms that he might well have been speaking Klingon, so little I understood. But as I became savvier with the data and the terminology, he became more comprehensible. He became a great resource for me. About 15 months ago, he discovered he had lung cancer, which had been treated until the last few days when he went into hospice. He died at the age of 61. I missed going to his funeral and the shiva, though I did learn about the best kosher supermarket.\n\nIn the same Sunday obituary section was news of the death of the adult daughter of a friend of mine. A sad story.\n\nA couple of years ago, an old buddy of mine from the FantaCo days died at the age of 47 after a stroke. I posted his obituary, which I didn’t write, online. A few days ago, his sister wrote to me. She hadn’t seen him in 30 years, did not know he died until she saw my reposted document, and wanted to know more. I got her in touch with a former employer of his who wrote to her. She wrote back with a three-page thank you.\n\nA woman on my floor who I would see regularly had been missing for a week and a half. She mentioned that her mom just died.\n\nYet with all of that, or maybe because of all of that, the song running through my head is Wall of Death by Richard and Linda Thompson, from their last album together, Shoot Out the Lights.\n\nThe lyrics:\n\nLet me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time\n\nOh let me ride on the Wall Of Death one more time\n\nYou can waste your time on the other rides\n\nThis is the nearest to being alive\n\nHere’s a live version much in the style of the record.\n\nFrom this article: “They approach the song’s declaration, joyfully or not, as a philosophy for living. Ideal for a pub setting, their vocals are stout. The same goes for the attitude Thompson has conjured. A world of risk and intrigue is favored over one with the comforts and predictability of an orderly life.\n\n“A life of mystery and a hope of fortune occur when breaking from the ordinary. Thompson declares riding ‘The Wall of Death is the nearest to being free.’ He takes a dim view toward the rides (and a lifestyle) that offer a familiar outcome.”\n\nSo perhaps the lesson I’ve absorbed is to live your life to the fullest, for you just don’t know how much time you have."
