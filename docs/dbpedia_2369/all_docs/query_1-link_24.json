        "text": "When Richard and Linda Thompson broke up in 1982, after their sixth album together and their first United States tour, a decade-long marriage and a brilliant performing duo was torn apart. Such albums as ''I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight'' and ''Shoot Out the Lights'' had topped critics' polls and established a dedicated cult following for the Thompsons, on the strength of Richard's songs - hard-headed lyrics tied to modal melodies - and of Linda's strong, melancholy lead vocals.\n\nBy coincidence, both Thompsons have just released solo albums, ''Across a Crowded Room'' (Polydor), Richard's third since the breakup, and ''One Clear Moment'' (Warner Bros.), Linda's first. The two albums share a subject whose significance is unmistakable - the perfidy of lovers.\n\nMr. Thompson was the visionary of the pair. As a founder of Fairport Convention and its many offshoots, he helped invent a distinctively British folk-rock in the 1960's. He linked modernist pessimism to the traditionally unflinching British folk ballad; he also developed one of Britain's most individual guitar styles, picking out multileveled counterpoint on acoustic guitar and playing snaky electric-guitar leads that moaned and sang, evoking the drones and dances of Celtic folk dances.\n\nLinda Peters, who married him, showed up alongside Mr. Thompson belting Carole King's ''Loco-Motion'' for ''The Bunch,'' a tribute to American rock oldies by the Fairport crowd. On the Richard and Linda Thompson albums, beginning with 1974's ''I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight,'' she turned out to be one of the most affecting ballad singers on either side of the Atlantic.\n\nTogether despite themselves, ''One Clear Moment'' and ''Across a Crowded Room'' show a couple still at war; the marriage may be over, but the wounds are fresh. As with any artwork, it's impossible to tell where autobiography ends and craft begins, since even rock songwriters who intend to be sincere might well trade accuracy for a good rhyme. Meanwhile, songwriting provides a magnificent opportunity for revenge in public. With titles like Richard Thompson's ''She Twists the Knife Again'' and Linda Thompson's ''Telling Me Lies,'' it seems clear that both parties are still aggrieved.\n\nThe Thompsons were never much for love songs. Unlike most pop songwriters, Mr. Thompson was more likely to write about events than feelings; his songs were unsentimental narratives, sometimes wry, sometimes despairing. In his universe, things rarely turned out easy; brother fought brother, friends betrayed each other and lovers waited in vain or watched romance die, always with a telling phrase: ''I wish I was a fool for you again,'' one character sang.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
