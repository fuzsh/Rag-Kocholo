        "text": "Richard Thompson remains something of a cult rocker rather than a bona fide rock star — but there are few similarly worthy candidates for the genre's personification on earth.\n\nFirst of all, he's one of rock's undersung triple threats. \"Richard's been one of my favorite guitar players for a very long time,\" said Jeff Tweedy, who produced and played on Thompson's 2015 album Still. \"When I think about it, he's also one of my favorite songwriters and favorite singers.\"\n\nThompson's 2021 memoir, Beeswing, renders him something like rock's Forrest Gump: By the tender age of 19, he'd co-founded Fairport Convention, seen Hendrix shred and turned down a birthday invite from Paul McCartney.\n\nHe had also pretty much solidified his artistry as an emotion-forward, English-Scottish yawp who was equally virtuosic on acoustic and electric guitar. And Thompson's probing lyrics continue to twist the knife, again and again.\n\nHis guitar work has inspired scores of imitators, but nobody's played the instrument like Thompson. In retrieving the bagpipe's drone, his music didn't become old-timey or quaint; rather, it enabled him to tear the roof off.\n\nCrank up his introductory calling card \"Roll Over Vaughn Williams\"; his roiling last album, 13 Rivers; and anything in between: Thompson's electric guitar will spin your head like a top. And on the acoustic, he's muscular, searching and incisive: both his Acoustic Classics discs will ravish you.\n\nHappily, Thompson is still making some of the strongest music of his career. His new album, Ship to Shore, is a taut yet spacious new offering. After the sturm und drang of the modern-rocking 13 Rivers, mellower, rootsier tracks like \"Freeze,\" \"The Day That I Give In\" and \"Life's a Bloody Show\" seem to loop back to the artist's essence.\n\nWith a whopping 19 studio albums since the early 1970s — six with his ex-wife Linda Thompson — to boil down Thompson's discography into essential tracks is a bit daunting. From here, seek out underrated '80s albums like Hand of Kindness; middle-of-the-road yet satisfying '90s works like Mock Tudor, and of course, his inspired work in the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nBut for now, if you're a Thompson newbie, read on for 10 songs you must hear by the three-time GRAMMY nominee.\n\n\"Roll Over Vaughn Williams\" (Henry the Human Fly, 1972)\n\nWhen it comes to songwriting, the 11-time nominee said \"nothing's really ever lost. You learn something about yourself writing terrible songs. I know myself better because of the songs that you've never heard.\"\n\nTweedy offered other helpful concepts and strategies, like accumulating enough voice memo ideas — for so long — that you can treat them like the work of a stranger. \"I'll go through and listen through a bunch of stuff like that,\" Tweedy quipped, \"and go, 'Who wrote this?'\"\n\nPawelski went on to elucidate her rich legacy in the music business — including her fight to get the Band's deep cuts, like Stage Fright, included in Capitol's music budget. (She's worked on archival projects by everyone from the Beach Boys to Big Star to Willie Nelson across her decades-long career.)\n\nRead More: Jeff Tweedy's Blurred Emotions: Wilco's Leader On Cruel Country & Songwriting As Discovery\n\nTweedy also discussed the magic of collaboration. \"I've gotten really good at being alone with people. So I think that facilitates collaboration to some degree,\" he said. \"What I mean is being as forgiving of myself with other people in the room as I am with myself alone.\"\n\nWhat was one of his favorites, Roberts inquired?\n\n\"The one that probably will always be the most proud of is getting to work with Mavis Staples and contributing something to her catalog, to her body of work that seems to have resonated not just with her audience or a new audience, but with her that she likes to sing, that means something to her. I think that would've satisfied me without it winning a GRAMMY [in 2011].\"\n\nWhen the conversation drifted to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Pawelsky discussed the foreboding process of digging through the sessions' flotsam and jetsam.\n\n\"The world kind of changed during the making of this. The band certainly changed, and also, technology changed,\" she explained. \"So we had everything — we had DATs, we had ADATs, we had tape, we had cassettes, we had CD-Rs.\"\n\nAbout her process: \"I go backwards and try to reconstruct how things happen, and it's always incomplete and I don't know what I'm missing, so it's extra fun. But this particular record was done and undone in a lot of ways… some of the latter recordings sound like they're earlier recordings.\"\n\nAs Pawelski admits, the prospect of stewarding Yankee was \"kind of terrifying\" because of how meaningful the record is. \"It really was a Rubik's cube. I would get the orange side done and I'd turn it over.\"\n\nAs the talk wound down, the subject of Wilco's latest album, Cousin, came up — as well as Wilco's rare use of an outside producer, in Cate Le Bon.\n\n\"I thought that it would be really a catalyst for getting something different out of the songs that I write,\" Tweedy explained. \"I like the idea of working with a woman, which I felt like has not happened that much in rock and roll, from my perspective\n\n\"So that felt like an inspired bit of lateral thinking,\" he continued. \"that felt so right to me to get to — and that she wanted to do it, and that we were friends, and it did.\"\n\nTo go \"Up Close & Personal\" with Tweedy is unlike most interviews; his brain simply works different than most, and you walk away pleasantly scrambled and transformed.\n\nWhich is what the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sessions were like — and thank goodness for Pawelski, who shows it's not merely a masterpiece: in all its alien transmissions, vulnerable one-liners and shattered poetry, Yankee continues to engender GRAMMY glory.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Wilco's Discography, From Alt-Country To Boundary-Shattering Experiments\n\nIf you’re a music fan looking to restock your library with some new reads, you’re in luck. With the second half of the year comes a dearth of new music books recounting the life and times of some of the most celebrated artists in the history of the artform are hitting shelves.\n\nFrom Britney Spears' much talked-about memoir that tackles the tabloid tumult of her life and Barbra Streisand’s highly anticipated autobiography (which clocks in at nearly 1,000 pages), to tomes that recount the lives of Tupac Shakur and Dolly Parton, it’s time to get reading. Read on for some of the best music-related new and upcoming books to add to your collection.\n\nThe Woman In Me\n\nBy Britney Spears\n\nOne of the most highly anticipated books of the year, Spears' memoir has been a blockbuster in the weeks since its release. When it was announced that the singer was writing a book, fans and observers braced themselves for what she would reveal when it comes to her tumultuous life and career. The result is a no-holds-barred look at how an innocent girl from Louisiana became swept up in the tsunami of fame, as well as the resulting wake.\n\nThe Woman in Me details Spears' halcyon younger years as part of the \"New Mickey Mouse Club,\" her explosive career, the blossoming and collapse of her relationship with Justin Timberlake, and the punishing conservatorship concocted by her father. Spears doesn’t hold back, but also shouts out the figures who provided solace and kindness: Madonna, Elton John, Mariah Carey, and former Jive Records president Clive Calder. The Woman In Me proves to be an unflinching, eye-opening look at the swirling tornado of music, fame, love and family, for better or for worse.\n\nMy Name is Barbra\n\nBy Barbra Streisand\n\nSince her early '60s breakout to her current status as a bona fide living legend, Barbra Streisand has lived a lot of life. Streisand's 992-page tome breaks down her humble beginnings growing up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and her subsequent stratospheric life during which she received a whopping 46 GRAMMY nominations and released many timeless songs. Along the way, she also became the first female in the history of moviemaking to write, produce, direct and star in a major motion picture (Yentl).\n\nIt’s all a long time coming, considering Jackie Onassis first approached Streisand to chronicle her triumphant life in 1984 (at the time, the former first lady was editor of Doubleday and Streisand was a mere 20 years into her iconic career). \"Frankly, I thought at 42 I was too young, with much more work still to come,\" Striesand recently told Vanity Fair. It’s an understatement considering all that’s happened since.\n\nTHE LYRICS: 1956 to Present\n\nBy Paul McCartney\n\nOne of the most celebrated artists of all time, McCartney's genius songwriting is on full, glimmering display in THE LYRICS. Newly released in a one volume paperback edition, the book puts the Beatles' way with words front and center while offering popcorn-worthy backstory.\n\nOriginally published to acclaim in 2021, the updated version includes additional material and insight from Macca himself on the creation of some of the most indelible hits in music history, including the 1965 Beatles hit \"Daytripper.\"\n\n\"The riff became one of our most well-known and you still often hear it played when you walk into guitar shops,\" wrote McCartney of the track. \"It’s one of those songs that revolves around the riff. Some songs are hung onto a chord progression. Others, like this, are driven by the riff.\"\n\nBehind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones\n\nBy Dolly Parton\n\n\"It costs a lot of money to look this cheap!\" So says luminary Dolly Parton, in a self-deprecating and witty and also patently untrue famous turn of phrase. While Parton’s life story has been recounted numerous times on the page and on screen, Behind the Seams zeros in on not just her trials and tribulations, but her unmistakable style.\n\nPacked with nearly 500 photographs, the book traces Parton’s looks from the sacks she used to dress in as a child in poverty to the flamboyant visuals associated with her stardom. \"I’ve been at this so long, I’ve worn some of the most bizarre things,\" Parton recently told the Guardian. \"My hairdos have always been so out there. At the time you think you look good, then you look back on it, like, what was I thinking?\"\n\nThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\n\nBy Sly Stone\n\nThe 80-year-old reclusive frontman of Sly and the Family Stone has certainly lived a lot of life. From his early days as part of the gospel vocal group the Stewart Four, Stone and his family band later became fixtures of the charts from the late '60s into the mid-'70s; a journey traced in the new book Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), named after their 1969 song of the same name.\n\nKnown for funky, soulful and earworm signature hits including \"Dance to the Music\" and \"Everyday People,\" the band won over the hearts of America, influencing legions of fans (including Herbie Hanckock and Miles Davis) and gaining a few enemies (the Black Panther Party). The book chronicles those ups and downs (including drug abuse), tracking Stone up to the modern era, which includes receiving the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Special Merit Award in 2017.\n\nBecoming Ella Fitzgerald: The Jazz Singer Who Transformed American Song\n\nBy Judith Tick\n\nElla Fitzgerald is one of America’s most iconic voices and the full breadth of her story will be told in the first major biography since her death in 1996. Known as the First Lady of Song, the 13-time GRAMMY winner is known for her swingin’ standards, sultry ballads, scat and everything in between.\n\nOut Nov. 21, the vocalist’s historic career is recounted by musicologist Judith Tick, who reflects on her legend using new research, fresh interviews and rare recordings. The result is a portrait of an undeniable talent and the obstacles she was up against, from her early days at the Apollo Theater to her passionate zeal for recording and performing up until her later years.\n\n\"Ella was two people,\" her longtime drummer Gregg Field told GRAMMY.com in 2020. \"She was very humble, very shy and generous. But when she walked on stage she was hardcore and didn’t know how to sing unless it was coming from her heart.\"\n\nWorld Within a Song: Music That Changed My Life and Life That Changed My Music\n\nBy Jeff Tweedy\n\nAside from his extensive discography with Wilco and beyond, Jeff Tweedy is the author of three books: his memoir Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back), a meditation on creativity called How to Write One Song, and his latest, World Within a Song. The latter expertly examines a variety of songs by a disparate spate of artists, from Rosalía to Billie Eilish with Tweedy’s singular take on what makes each song stand out along with what he dubs \"Rememories,\" short blurbs that recount moments from his own life and times.\n\nMuch like his songwriting prowess, it’s a book where Tweedy’s way with words shine with shimmering eloquence. \"My experience of my own emotions is that they all interact,\" Tweedy told GRAMMY.com last year. \"They aren't individual, isolated things that you experience one at a time, and I think that's a really beautiful thing about being alive.\"\n\nTupac Shakur: The Authorized Biography\n\nBy Staci Robinson\n\nOne of the giants of hip-hop finally gets his due with an official recounting of his life and times. Here his legend is told by the authoritative Staci Robinson, an expert on the star who previously wrote Tupac Remembered: Bearing Witness to a Life and Legacy and served as executive producer of the FX documentary series \"Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur.\"\n\nHere, Robinson reflects on Tupac’s legacy from a modern perspective, and tracks the history of race in America alongside the rapper’s life and times, from the turbulent '60s to the Rodney King riots. Along the way are the stories behind the songs including \"Brenda’s Got a Baby.\"\n\n\"In between shots (of filming the movie Juice) I wrote it,\" Shakur is quoted saying in Robinson’s book. \"I was crying too. That’s how I knew everybody else would cry, ’cause I was crying.’\"\n\n10 Music Books To Dig Into This Summer: A Kate Bush Bio, A First-Hand Account Of The Grunge Scene & Feminist Punk Histories\n\nHow Can I Watch The 2024 GRAMMY Nominations?\n\nThe nominations livestream event will stream live on live.GRAMMY.com and the Recording Academy's YouTube channel.\n\nWhen Are The 2024 GRAMMY Nominations Announced?\n\nThe 2024 GRAMMYs nominations will be announced Friday, Nov 10.
