        "text": "They say a woman′s a fool for weeping\n\nA fool to break her own heart\n\nBut I can't hold the secret I′m keeping\n\nI'm breaking apart\n\nCan't seem to mind my own business\n\nWhatever I try turns out wrong\n\nI seem like my own false witness\n\nAnd I can′t go on\n\nI cover my ears, I close my eyes\n\nStill hear your voice and it′s telling me lies\n\nTelling me lies\n\nYou told me you needed my company\n\nAnd I believed in your flattering ways\n\nYou told me you needed me forever\n\nNearly gave you the rest of my days\n\nShould've seen you for what you are\n\nShould never have come back for more\n\nShould′ve locked up all my silver\n\nBrought the key right to your door\n\nYou don't know what a chance is\n\nUntil you have to seize one\n\nYou don′t know what a man is\n\nUntil you have to please one\n\nDon't put your life in the hands of a man\n\nWith a face for every season\n\nDon′t waste your time in the arms of a man\n\nWho's no stranger to treason\n\nWriter(s): Betsy Cook, Linda Thompson<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
