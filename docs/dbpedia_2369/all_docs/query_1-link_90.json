        "text": "MR. DAREDEVIL — (Via Deadline) Wow. This isn’t your Netflix’s Daredevil. Visceral, cinematic, bloody — this is a Daredevil in the way that James Bond got a reboot with Daniel Craig.\n\nThe first look at the series was revealed Friday for the crowd at D23 in Anaheim. And there’s a big homage to Heat with Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock and Vincent Donofiro’s Kingpin meeting in a diner to verbally draw their boundaries.\n\n“If you step out of line, I’m going to be there,” says Murdock.\n\nKingpin, laughing, wonders if it’s Daredevil talking or Murdock.\n\nIn another shot, a prison inmate tells Murdock, “You don’t understand, people needed you.”\n\nAlso seen here is Jon Bernthal’s Frank Castle aka The Punisher, a long-haired ruffian who comes up against Murdock in fisticuffs before the former realizes it’s his ally.\n\nThe tagline that runs in the trailer: “The Devil’s Work Is Never Done.”\n\nMarvel President Kevin Feige also confirmed a season 2 will be shooting soon.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again follows original star Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock, a blind attorney-turned-crimefighting superhero, and also features Vincent D’Onofrio reprising his role as mob boss Wilson Fisk aka Kingpin and Jon Bernthal returning as Punisher.\n\nThe cast of Daredevil: Born Again also includes Margarita Levieva, Arty Froushan, Sandrine Holt, Michael Gandolfini and Nikki M. James.\n\nWe gotta wait till March 1, 2025 for Daredevil: Born Again.\n\nI got to admit, it’s great to have the original Netflix-band back together, but somehow the trailer didn’t work for me. It looked somehow different. Take a look:\n\nSNL AT 50 — Hard to believe but Saturday Night Live enters its 50th year in September. Save for a year, Lorne Michaels has been the conductor of the train the entire time. I’ve watch it since that first show, so I’m able to comment somewhat authoritatively on the trailer for the movie Saturday Night coming in October 11.\n\nIt looks pretty good. I know Jason Reitman is onboard, so it’ll be pretty much right-on. Take a look at the trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9O_tl5Npk\n\nand what the Daily Mail said: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13727345/Saturday-Night-Live-movie-LOOK-Trailer-SNL-episode.html\n\nSHORT TAKES — Micky Dolenz was at Mark Lapidos’ The Fest For Beatles Fans this weekend and is seen here with Billy J. Kramer. He also sang “Rocky Raccoon,” “Oh Darling” and “Johnny B Goode” backed by the Liverpool Band with Lawrence Juber from Wings joining in.\n\nOur spy there said Dolenz took the SRO crowd back to the 60’s in fine fashion ….

Filmed live at Theatre Royal Drury Lane during two special one-off concert stagings in January 2022, Bonnie & Clyde: The Musical stars Tony Award-nominee Jeremy Jordan as Clyde – reprising the role he originated in the Broadway premiere in 2011 – and Olivier Award-nominee Frances Mayli McCann as Bonnie, who went on to originate the role of Bonnie in the West End premiere run.

Wildhorn, and Black were Tony-nominated for their score.\n\n“Disney’s Snow White” a live action musical reimagining of the classic 1937 film just released their trailer. The magical music adventure journeys back to the timeless story with beloved characters Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. “Disney’s Snow White” is directed by Marc Webb and produced by Marc Platt and Jared LeBoff, with Callum McDougall serving as executive producer, and features all-new original songs from Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot star.\n\nSpeaking of Pasek and Paul, Hugh Jackman‘s passion project “The Greatest Showman” is finally getting a live stage show, thanks to Disney. At D23 in Anaheim on Friday, Disney showcased a medley of upcoming musical theater shows including dates for Frozen and Hercules that will debut on the West End. After a collection of rousing performances from the Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, to name, what was heard was “Ladies and gents, this is the moment you’ve waited for.” The crowd was then surprised with a rendition of “The Greatest Show,” from “The Greatest Showman.” Ryan Vasquez, who starred in The Notebook on Broadway, was dressed as Jackman’s character P. T. Barnum and accompanied four other cast members on stage under the signage “The Greatest Showman: The New Musical.” D23 host Yvette Nicole Brown said that the project was currently in development for a stage musical adaptation. The timing and the location have not been disclosed.\n\nAlso look for\n\nWicked: Release schedule for November 22, 2024 (Part 1); November 26, 2025 (Part 2) Starring Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, Jonathan Bailey, Marissa Bode, Peter Dinklage, Jeff Goldblum, Ethan Slater and Michelle Yeoh.\n\nKiss Of The Spider Woman: Director: Bill Condon, starring Jennifer Lopez, Diego Luna and Tonatiuh.
