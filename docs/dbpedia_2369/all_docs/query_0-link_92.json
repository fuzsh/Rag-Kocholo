Until now, no quality reference series has provided comprehensive information on such a wide range of artists despite keen and ongoing public interest. To find biographical and critical coverage, an information seeker had little choice but to wade through the offerings of the popular press, scan television \"infotainment\" programs, and search for the occasional published biography or expose. Contemporary Musicians is designed to serve that information seeker, providing in one ongoing source in-depth coverage of the important figures on the modern music scene in a format that is both informative and entertaining. Students, researchers, and casual browsers alike can use Contemporary Musicians to fill their needs for personal information about the artists, find a selected discography of the musician's recordings, and read an insightful essay offering biographical and critical information. Provides Broad Coverage Existing single-volume biographical sources on musicians are limited in scope, focusing on a handful of performers from a specific musical genre or era. In contrast, Contemporary Musicians offers researchers and music devotees a comprehensive, informative, and entertaining alternative. Contemporary Musicians is published twice yearly, with each volume providing information on 80 to 100 musical artists from all the genres that form the broad spectrum of contemporary music—pop, rock, jazz, blues, country, new wave, New Age, folk, rhythm and blues, gospel, bluegrass, and reggae, to name a few, as well as selected classical artists who have achieved \"crossover\" success with the general public. Includes Popular Features In Contemporary Musicians you'll find popular features that users value: • Easy-to-locate data sections—Vital personal statistics, chronological career summaries, listings of major awards, and mailing addresses, when available, are prominently displayed in a clearly marked box on the second page of each entry. • Biographical/critical essays—Colorful and informative essays trace each personality's personal and professional life, offer representative examples of critical response to each artist's work, and provide entertaining personal sidelights. • Selected discographies—Each entry provides a comprehensive listing of the artist's major recorded works. • Photographs—Most entries include portraits of the artists. • Sources for additional information—This invaluable feature directs the user to selected books, magazines, and newspapers where more information on listees can be obtained. Helpful Indexes Make It Easy to Find the Information You Need Contemporary Musicians features a Musicians Index, listing names of individual performers and musical groups, and a Subject Index that provides the user with a breakdown by primary musical instruments played and by musical genre.\n\nix\n\nWe Welcome Your Suggestions The editors welcome your comments and suggestions for enhancing and improving Contemporary Musicians.

Consisting of three cousins born in Alabama—Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry, and Jeff Cook— and a Massachusetts-born drummer, Mark Herndon, the band won Entertainer of the Year honors from the Country Music Association three consecutive years, making history as the first multi-member group to earn the coveted award. Recognition and million-selling albums have come after years of struggle for Alabama; according to Suzan Crane in Country Music magazine, the band's music \"has the unpretentious sincerity of the truest country tune.\" Saturday Evening Post contributor Bob Allen likewise commented that because of the band's many fallow years before success came, the music \"is redolent of a sense of belonging, of a sense of home and of gratitude for the emotional ties that bind.\" Bill C. Malone elaborated on Alabama's sound in his book Country Music U.S.A.: \"Alabama discovered a winning commercial formula by judiciously mixing romantic ballads such as\n\n1\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nO\n\nriginally formed in Fort Payne, Ala., in 1969 as Wild Country; name changed to Alabama, 1977; original group members include Randy Owen (born 1949 in Fort Payne, Ala.), guitar and vocals; Teddy Gentry (born 1952 in Fort Payne, Ala.), bass and vocals; Jeff Cook (born 1949 in Fort Payne, Ala.), guitar and keyboards. Mark Herndon (born 1955 in Massachusetts) joined Alabama as its sixth drummer in 1979 (also sings). Awards: Named instrumental group of the year and vocal group of the year by Country Music Association, 1982; entertainer of the year awards from County Music Association, 1982, 1983, and 1984; entertainer of the year awards from Academy of Country Music, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985; named \"country artist of the 1980s\" by Academy of Country Music, 1989. Addresses: Management—c/o Dale Morris Management, 818 19th Ave. S., Nashville, TN 37203. Record company— RCA Records 1133 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036-6758.\n\n'Feels So Right' and 'An Old Flame Burning in Your Heart' with rousing uptempoed tunes like 'Mountain Music' and Tennessee River.' The results have been a balanced and fruitful melange which has brought Alabama an enthusiastic and broad audience of both mainstream country listeners and youthful devotees.\" Three of Alabama's four principal members were born and raised near Fort Payne, a small town in the Appalachian region of Alabama. Gentry and Owen lived on neighboring farms, where they helped to eke a bare subsistance living from the thin soil. Gentry told the Saturday Evening Post that neither family could afford such basics as indoor plumbing, television, or radio. As boyhood chums, Gentry and Owen sang together at the Lookout Mountain Pentecostal Holiness Church; both came from musical families in the rural gospel tradition. In high school the boys met a distantly related cousin, Jeff Cook, whose Fort Payne family was slightly more affluent. Cook owned a veritable \"arsenal of musical equipment,\" to quote Crane, and he teamed with his country relatives to form a band. Their first performance in a local talent show resulted in a first prize—tickets to Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. Soon they were playing at theme parks and in small lounges in the vicinity of Fort Payne. Although they wanted to be full-time musicians, they took salaried jobs as carpet layers and as an electrician in order to make ends meet. They shared a\n\n2 • Contemporary Musicians • Volume 1\n\nrented house, where they spent their off-hours practicing and composing music. Cook told Country Music that late at night, \"even with the lights off we'd lay there in the dark and sing until one by one we'd drift off to sleep.\" Finally, in 1972, the young men decided to quit their secure jobs to devote themselves entirely to the band. Calling themselves Wild Country, they hit the road in a battered Dodge van, playing gigs at Holiday Inns and honky tonk bars all across the South. One regular venue was The Bowery, in the seaside resort of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; the band members would perform and then sell albums they had produced at their own expense. No one in Alabama remembers those lean years with any fondness. \"After six months another group would've given up,\" Owen told People magazine. \"We started playing music as a business rather than just treating it like a big party.\" Cook told the Saturday Evening Post: \"We had just about every reason to quit. But we went on anyhow.\" Wild Country changed its name to Alabama in 1977. Cook gave several reasons for the switch to the Satur-\n\n\"Alabama will never put on a show you couldn't take your children to see.\"\n\nday Evening Post: \"Alabama is a good short name, and you can'l! copyright a state name. It's also a good alphabetical place to be in a music store. That's the first album that's gonna be in there.\" In 1979 drummer Rick Scott left the band and was replaced by Mark Herndon. Within six months Alabama had its first recording contract. Dallas-based MDJ Records released the single \"I Wanna Come Over,\" and the song made the top thirty on the country charts. The group's debut professionally produced album, My Home's in Alabama (1980), also hit the country charts quickly and remained there for thirteen weeks. In the wake of that success, Alabama signed with RCA and became, in four short years, the best selling group in the history of country music. Crane wrote that Alabama's lyrics \"take the listener on a journey through their past; bringing us to their home, introducing us to their lovers, and inviting us to share some of their experiences. It's a scenic ride on American roads and through human emotions. The music won't allow you to stay in one place too long, though, as\n\ntempos and sentiments change with every song.

They all still live in Fort Payne, now with their wives and children; they do an annual benefit concert that helps finance numerous local charities, and they forbid public drinking among their retinue during concerts. According to Allen, \"You can call it country or you can call it rock, but one thing is certain: Alabama will never put on a show you couldn't take your children to see.\"\n\nOwen explained the band's philosophy in the Saturday Evening Post: \"To me, all these awards we've won are something to live up to,\" he said. \"We're not a bunch of angels, by any means. But we do believe in promoting the positive things . . . the kinds of things you've got to be aware of as far as the way you live your life.\" Having earned country music's most prestigious awards for songs they have written and performed themselves, Alabama's members have achieved their greatest goals. Owens told People, however, that he and his partners still nurture ambitions for the future. He called the country music business \"a never ending process of wanting to be bigger and go further.\"\n\nSelected discography My Home's in Alabama, RCA, 1980. Feels So Right, RCA, 1981.

But by appropriating aspects of both—a well-worn tradition in avant-garde art—Anderson simply succeeds in creating an extraordinarily virtuosic in-joke.\" So wrote Sally Banes in the Village Voice in 1980, at the mid-point of Laurie Anderson's career in performance art. Thanks to a long-term recording contract with Warner Bros., Anderson has become the most popularly recognized figure in that ever-changing field of music—art and solo performance. She is a multitalented musician, once described as \"a recording artist who can do her own MTV videos and record cover graphics,\" who is one of the most controversial artists of our times. Raised outside of Chicago in a musical family, Anderson studied violin before moving to New York to take a degree in Art History from Barnard College in 1969. She earned an M.F.A. in Sculpture from Columbia University in 1972 and studied with noted minimalist artist Sol Le Witt. Anderson began to perform as an element of her own \"installation pieces,\" combined exhibitions and events in small art galleries, museums and post-modern dance spaces. They included text, films or videos, as in the narrative of her own photographs, Story Show, that she exhibited in 1972. Automotive, which she described as her first performance piece, was a setting of car horns in an open space in Rochester, Vermont, that year. From 1973 to the present, Anderson has created installations at galleries or museums that require her performance as a musician. She is associated with the electric and/or altered violin—an instrument that can be plucked or bowed as if it were a conventional accoustic fiddle. But she frequently experiments with its extraordinary sound capabilities. She has rigged her violins with prerecorded music, as in her Duets on Ice, so that she played a duet on accoustic violin with the tape of herself hidden inside her tape-bow violin. On each occasion in New York and in Genoa, the \"duet\" was performed on blocks of ice and lasted, at each performance, until the ice melted. More recently, she composed Like a Stream for her tape-bow altered violin accompanied by the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in 1978. Anderson also alters her voice for performance. In her six-hour-long United States I-IV, she used a Vocoder to split and sample her own voice into a variety of effects including a \"vocal transformation from female to male . . . [that] reminded one of Lily Tomlin's use of transvestism to make anti-sexist statements,\" as Stephen Holden described a \"works-in-progress\" appearance in 1982.

Her installations, requiring a limited present audience, have become less important to her career than recordings, which can be taped for a much wider audience. She had originally been attracted by the impermanence of art, telling Robert Palmer in the New York Times that \"That was very important to me, because it made the work so much about memory. The only way to document it, really, is to use your memory, I refused to even let people take pictures of it for a long time.\" As Tom Johnson described one installation in his Village Voice column in 1977, Anderson soon adapted the technology of permanence of music to her art. \"Anyone who wandered into the Holly Solomon Gallery last month was confronted by, of all things, a jukebox. It was a big stereo model, all lit up in the usual way. If you pushed a few buttons, it would play any one of 124 singles by Laurie Anderson. . . . The singles in Anderson's jukebox were in an artsy sort of semi-popular vein. . . . Number 121 admitted a number of extraneous sounds, such as a boat horn and a parrot. Number 100 featured a talking Jew's harp that conveyed a text almost comprehensibly. Number 103, 'Like a CB,' lamented\n\nthe intrusion of CB signals on home stereo equipment and itself had a brief CB-type intrusion.\" Selections of her works were included in two significant anthology albums in the 1970s—Airwaves (1977) and New Music for Electronic and Recorded Material (1977). Her song, \"O Superman\" (1981), became a surprise number one hit in Great Britain and brought her to the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The beat that came naturally to her, having grown up in the rock and roll era, brought her odd sounds and unusual lyrics to an enormous audience and Anderson became performance art's first rock star and Warner Bros, first conceptualist. Anderson described the process of her recording to Robert Palmer's \"The Pop Life\" column in the New York Times: \"On [Big Science], I tried to integrate the music, the singing and the talking. . . . But I try to lock those elements a little tighter [for] listening. I'm so used to depending on music, language and a third thing, the picture, that making this album was like—gulp.\" Much of the work of performance artists like Anderson or Philip Glass, who combine minimalist music with overwhelming visual spectacle, has been compared to opera. Anderson's massive multi-media work, United States I-IV, has often been so desribed. She told Michael VerMeulen in In Performance that it grew out of her social experiences abroad, \"sitting at dinner tables in Europe and having people ask me: 'How can you Americans be behaving that way? How could you have elected that guy? What's wrong with you people? What's wrong with your cities? Why are they rotting? Why don't you care about sick people? How can you live in a society run by computers? Why do you spend so much time in your cars? Why don't you care about your mothers and fathers?'\" United States I-IV was a work in progress for much of Anderson's career. Part I, \"Americans on the Move,\" about transportation as a metaphor for change, was premiered at The Kitchen, a New York performance space, in 1979. The second part, on politics, was first presented at a proscenium theater in New York. Part Three, about money, was seen in partial previews in Anderson's concerts during 1983, while Part Four, concerning love, was given its premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's prestigeous Next Wave Festival in 1984. Critics from mainstream theatre/music and the avant garde world were disappointed with the work. In a retrospective article on performance art, the New York Times reported that it \"was meant to be a portrayal of this country, composed of a mixture of visual images, music, Zen koans [chants] and theatrical gesture . . . suggesting an American society that is all technological surface and commerce, empty slogans and formu-\n\nAndcrson • 5\n\nlaic language. . . . The result—far from being an avantgarde challenge to American culture—was as formulaic as the questions [she] was inspired by. [It], in fact, displayed many of the characteristics Miss Anderson seemed to think belong to the United States—preoccupation with technological novelty, celebrations of cliches and surface.\" The Village Voice assigned two critics to the premiere—theatre editor Erika Munk and performance art specialist Sally Banes. As Munk described the event, \"Anderson's work leans heavily on charm, suggestion and light irony, but these don't explain its fleeting quality either. There's something disturbing under the charm, and it's not, I think, a disturbance she intends. Anderson gives us songs and anecdotes, imagery, a persona, an enviroment, but basically she is performing an attitude—towards the means of art, its subjects, its interplay with the audience—which embraces all these things, and taken over the hours, diminishes them.\" Banes was also disappointed. \"Must a performance about a trivial culture—or trivial aspects of a very\n\nBasically she is performing an attitude—towards the means of art, its subjects, its interplay with the audience— which embraces all these things and diminishes them.\n\ncomplex culture—be as shallow and pretentious as the life it describes? . . . The references to popular culture are eerie and empty, rather than vibrant. They dessicate, rather than vitalize, the world they describe. Yet some of the most powerful songs in United States quote from 30's culture rather than the 80's. . . . Graphic imagery from the 30's crops up throughout the four sections. Some of Anderson's appeal has to do with her technologyfuturism hype, but some of it also has to do with depression nostalgia.\" Now best known for her recordings, Anderson continues to create live art works that depend on combinations of environmental and technological determinates. Every performance requires the recreation of the human voice and all instruments through electric and computerized programming. She has recently attempted to recreate the performance mode on recordings. She includes photographs, diagrams, and instructions\n\n6 • Contemporary Musicians • Volume 1\n\nin her albums to develop a multi-layering effect of hearing on audio equipment what musicians are performing on audio equipment in order to sound like different instruments. Many of Anderson's installation pieces have been published by galleries as a permanent art form, among them Transportation/Transportation (1973; Pace University Print Shop) and Performance by Artists (1979; Art Metropole, Toronto). She has also published the illustrated text of United States (Harper & Row, 1984). Her \"high-tech, one-woman show,\" What Do You Mean We?, was shown on the Public Broadcasting Service series dedicated to experimental and performance art, \"Alive from Off Center,\" in 1986. Her film, \"Home of the Brave\" (Warner Bros., 1986) has also been seen on the Public Broadcasting Service. Recently, Anderson has returned to less stagey events. Her concert at the \"Serious Fun Festival\" at Lincoln Center in 1988 was admired by John Rockwell in the New York Times as \"heartwarming.\" \"Her singing seemed new because there was so much of it and it sounded strong compared with her mostly spoken story-songs of the past or her mousy vocalizations of a couple of years ago. The accompaniment consisted of herself alone, bereft of a quasi-rock band . . . it was fascinating and somehow ingratiating to see her alone on stage the way she used to be back at the Kitchen and other haunts, mustering up an extraordinary range of vocal and instrumental textures all be herself.\" Anderson's future in music and performance art will undoubtably lead to more controversy. She is experimenting more with videos and has discussed the possibilities of making works directly on to video discs, without any live performances. She has been able to enlarge the audience for mixed-media work by her mainstream recording contracts and appearances on MTV. Many audiences now anticipate her next moves.\n\nSelected discography Big Science, (includes \"O Superman\"), Warner Brothers, 1982. Mister Heartbreak, Warner Brothers, 1984.

His career extends more than eighty years, and in that time he has distinguished himself in a phenomenal range of music—from Baroque master J. S. Bach to Romantics such as Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt, and from the towering genius Ludwig van Beethoven to key Impressionist Claude Debussy. Throughout much of his career Arrau has also performed at a pace that might prove exhausting to less disciplined musicians: in his most hectic period, stretching from the 1920s into the 1960s, he annually gave more than one hundred performances and still managed to produce a vast catalog of recorded works. Even into the 1970s and '80s his schedule has remained relatively formidable. Arrau, however, seems undaunted by the demands of his career, and he dismisses the belief that a performer's abilities must inevitably decline. \"I think an artist in his development doesn't necessarily have an up and down,\" he told Joseph Horowitz in the New York Times. \"In most cases an artist's development only goes up.\" Arrau was born in Chile in 1903. A prodigy, Arrau prospered under the tutelage of his mother, a piano instructor. At age five he held his first public performance, playing works by Mozart and Schumann. Within two years he was known among Chilean music aff icianados as a remarkable talent, and in 1910 he was given a tenyear scholarship for studying in Germany's music center, Berlin. Arrau's greatest teacher there was Martin Krause, a former pupil of Liszt's. Krause devoted himself extensively to educating young Arrau in nearly all matters, from music—Beethoven's compositions were especially emphasized—to nutrition, aesthetics, and even etiquette. In the mid-191 Os Arrau performed his first Berlin recital and earned several awards. Soon afterwards he began performing outside Germany and with such conductors as Wilhelm Furtwangler, who became one of Arrau's favorite musical collaborators. Arrau's career seemed to be developing impressively, but he faltered when Krause died in 1918. Without his mentor, Arrau suffered a devastating loss of self-confidence, and after a mismanaged tour of the United States he found himself in despair back in Berlin. Through therapy with psychoanalyst Hubert Abrahamsohn, who had studied under Carl Jung, Arrau gradually recovered from his depression and found greater awareness of himself as an interpretive artist. By the late 1920s Arrau was once again realizing success, winning a prestigious piano competition in Switzerland and commencing another concert tour. Europe, however, was teeming with musicians, and in order to sustain public interest and draw further attention, Arrau undertook a publicity stunt in 1935 by playing J. S. Bach's\n\n8\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nB\n\norn February 6,1903, in Chilian, Chile; naturalized U.S. citizen, 1979; son of Carlos (an oculist) and Lucrecia (a piano teacher; maiden name, Leon) Arrau; married Ruth Schneider, July 8,1937; children: Carmen, Mario, Christopher.\n\nConcert pianist, 1908—.

Towards the end of the decade, after complete sets of the Beethoven compositions, he undertook similarly extensive recordings of works by Romantic masters Schumann, Chopin, and Liszt. These records earned Arrau still further accolades as an artist of astounding interpretive powers and range. Acclaim continued to be accorded Arrau as he began realizing pivotal birthdays and anniversaries. In 1978, he celebrated his seventy-fifth year by giving nearly one hundred performances in a total of fourteen countries. Among this tour's highlights was a New York City recital featuring Beethoven's \"Les Adieux\" Sonata, Liszt's B Minor Sonata, and Brahms's F Minor Sonata. Newsweek reported that Arrau \"attacked the pieces in typical Arrau fashion: with fierce aplomb and with scrupulous respect for the notes as written.\" Another career highlight occurred in 1984 when he returned again to his native Chile and performed a nationally broadcast recital.\n\nAddresses: Home—Douglaston, N.Y.

When this series earned Arrau considerable praise, he followed in 1936 with a series devoted to Mozart's entire keyboard works, and two years later he gave the first of his many series presenting Beethoven's thirty-two sonatas. The success of these artistically demanding—and physically exhausting—feats established Arrau in Europe as an artist of phenomenal range and stamina. In America, though, he was unknown, and when he fled there after World War II erupted he found himself once again forced to develop an audience. American critics, however, quickly rallied behind Arrau, who powerfully impressed them with his versatility and unusual stamina. At the end of World War II, by which time Arrau had given more than two hundred concerts and recitals, he was widely acclaimed as an artist of distinguished interpretive powers as well. More than one critic remarked that Arrau produced probing, dramatic interpretations whether playing Bach or Mozart or Schumann. During the 1950s Arrau broadened his appeal by performing extensively in Mexico and South America. Returning to his native Chile proved particularly triumphant, with audiences providing wildly enthusiastic ovations and the Chilean government granting him a gold medal for his achievements. By the 1960s Arrau\n\n\"In 1978, [Arrau] celebrated his seventy-fifth year by giving nearly one hundred performances in a total of fourteen countries.\"\n\nDespite his age, Arrau has maintained a demanding work pace into the 1980s.

Among his recording projects in the 1980s are new interpretations of the Beethoven concertos and selected Beethoven sonatas—his Beethoven recordings alone number more than eighty—as well as Mozart sonatas and some Schubert compositions. In 1978, by which time Arrau had already been performing for seventy years, he explained his work pace to Newsweek: \"I'm afraid if I stop I won't have the courage to start again.\"\n\nSelected discography Beethoven, Ludwig van, Piano Concerto No. 4 in G, Opus 58, Phillips.

From \"Walk On By\" to \"That's What Friends Are For,\" the Bacharach sound has been on the airwaves for over thirty astoundingly succesful years. Born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1929, Bacharach grew up in Queens, New York, where his father served as a fashion industry journalist. He learned to play the piano and spent his adolescence listening to a wide range of musical styles. Bacharach's formal studies in composition and form were under three experimenters in flexible rhythms and free-flowing melodies who were willing to support his developing personal style—Darius Milhaud, at the New School for Social research in New York; Boleslav Martineau at the Mannes School of Music there; and Henry Cowell at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California. He later told ASCAP Today that his early influences had also included Maurice Ravel, Dizzy Gillespie, and Charlie Parker. Bacharach's music, with its shifting rhythms, wide melodic jumps and unusual structures, owe much to all six of these teachers. Military service in Korea and Germany brought Bacharach experience with performing as a concert pianist and as an accompanist for popular vocalists. After returning to New York, he played for Vic Damone, Polly Bergen, the Ames Brothers, and many others, most memorably Marlene Dietrich, with whom he toured as conductor and arranger from 1958 to 1961. He has since consigned to oblivion his first published song, \"The Night Plane to Heaven,\" and many others from the early 1950s. But his meeting with lyricist Hal David at the Paramount Music Corporation in 1957 brought their two first succesful songs, \"Magic Moments\" and \"The Story of My Life.\" After his three years with Dietrich, he returned to a partnership with David that lasted until 1976. That long-lasting partnership included over 200 individual songs (most written for Dionne Warwick), title songs for major Hollywood films, and a musical comedy, Promises, Promises, that was a hit on Broadway and in London. Their collaborative works represent a combination of both the American popular love song tradition and the experiments of Bacharach's mentors. They have been compared to the best of Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, and Rodgers and Hart's conversational ballads because the lyrics are set as if they were spoken. Lines are seldom broken in mid-sentence, but instead flow throughout a vast melodic range. Bacharach has always denied that his music is other than normal\n\n11\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nB\n\norn May 29, 1929, in Kansas City, Mo.; son of Bert (a garment industry journalist) and Irma (a portrait painter; maiden name, Bacharach; married Paula Stewart (a singer); married Angie Dickinson (an actress), 1965 (divorced, 1981); married Carole Bayer Sager (a lyricist), March 30, 1982; children: (second marriage) Lea Nikki; (third marriage) Christopher Elton.

Its not done to be clever. You've got less than two minutes in a song and you want every second to count. Forget rules. Just listen and feel. My trouble is that these so-called abnormalities seem conventional and normal to me.\" Bacharach was able to hear his songs at all because singer Dionne Warwick had become a third member of the partnership with Hal David. He had met Warwick when one of his early songs, \"Mexican Divorce,\" was recorded by the drifters for Scepter Records in 1960. Warwick was a member of the Gospelaires, the backup group for that recording session. In 1962, she recorded 12 • Contemporary Musicians • Volume 1\n\ntheir \"Don't Make Me Over\" for Scepter—soon reaching the top ten on the pop charts. Over the next five years, Warwick made hits out of Bacharach and David's \"Anyone Who Had a Heart,\" \"Walk On By,\" \"Reach Out for Me,\" \"The Look of Love,\" \"This Guy's in Love With You,\" \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?,\" and \"What the World Needs Now.\" At first, writers questioned Bacharach's experiments with the popular love song and analyzed their hits as oddities, such as the fourteen time signatures in \"Anyone Who Had a Heart.\" But Warwick proved the \"singability\" of the tunes by selling over 12.5 million copies of Bacharach/David songs by 1970. They soon became popular with a wide variety of performers. \"What's New Pussycat,\" for example, was recorded by Warwick, Tom Jones, and The Chipmunks. Other artists who included Bacharach/David songs on their albums were rockers Joe Cocker, Stevie Wonder, and Issac Hayes; jazz stylists Bill Evans and Billy Vaughn; vocalists Barbra Streisand and Vic Damone; and Bacharach himself. The uncredited author of a 1965 Newsweek article praised Bacharach's inventiveness and stated that he was \"not afraid of melodies . . . has the soft touch and sets up his songs for surprising explosions or dramatic fadeouts . . . a witty composer who kids his own melodies with tinny pianos and punctuates tender tunes with sudden bumps and grinds.\" With Hal David, Bacharach was also becoming known for scores and title songs for Hollywood films, many of them contemporary comedies, including Send Me No Flowers and Promise Her Anything, that required an upto-date theme song as an advertising lure. \"The Look of Love\" was created for the James Bond thriller \"Casino Royale\" (1967) and their Oscar-winning \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" was written for the Paul Newman/Robert Redford cowboy film, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1970). The former song way outshone its film, but both \"Raindrops . . .\" (as performed by B.J. Thomas) and \"Butch Cassidy\" were enormously popular for years. \"Raindrops . . .\" was also recorded by Perry Como, guitarist Buddy Merrill, Andy Williams, and Dionne Warwick. Among their many other film themes that became popular as individual songs were the title songs for What's New Pussycat and Alfie, for which Bacharach won a Grammy for best instrumental arrangement. Bacharach has also provided complete scores for many films, most notably \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" For the latter film, he won a Grammy for best original soundtrack recording and an Oscar for best original score. Bacharach and David next took on the challenge of creating a full score of characterizational solos, duets,\n\nand ensembles for a plotted Broadway musical, \"Promises, Promises.\" An adaptation by Neil Simon of the Billy Wilder film \"The Apartment,\" the musical amassed a very succesful 1281 performances on Broadway before moving to London (for 560 performances) and a fourteen-month national tour. The title song and \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" both acheived top ten status as singles for Warwick. Critical response was favorable, with Brendan Gill of the New Yorker \"telling two hundred millions of my fellow citizens . . . to go and see it as quickly as possible.\" \"Promises, Promises\" was one of the first musicals on Broadway to adapt the technology of the recording studio to the live theatre, as well as adapting the totally contemporary sound of Bacharach and David's songs to the requirements of a plot. The show was scored for electric organ, guitar, and organ and Broadway's first pit chorus of four women was installed in the Shubert Theater. The original cast recording of the show was honored by NARAS as the best of 1969. With hit films, a hit show, and songs all over the play list, Bacharach returned to the concert tour in 1970—this time as the composer, conductor, and featured performer. Since, as fellow songwriter Sammy Cahn put it succinctly, \"he is the only composer who doesn't look like a dentist,\" Bacharach enjoyed the status of a celebrity sex symbol. He appeared with his father in a well-received series of print advertisements endorsing Jim Beam Bourbon. He performed his own songs on successful albums for A&M under a long-term contract and starred in television specials devoted to his work. In 1971, in fact, his first television special, \"The Burt Bacharach Special\" (CBS, 1970) beat his second, \"Another Evening with Burt Bacharach\" (NBC, 1970), for an Emmy. Bacharach's professional and personal lives changed in the late 1970s when he and David split their partnership. This led to a rift with Warwick, who had been guaranteed by contract songs for one album per year for another three years. Her suit against Bacharach and David was eventually settled out of court. Bacharach's solo projects included Women, a recording with the Houston Symphony, and songs for Carly Simon and Libby Titus. The score for the re-make of \"Lost Horizon\" was praised, but the film was not succesful. His second marriage, to actress Angie Dickenson, ended. In 1979, however, he began a new collaboration (and, eventually, marriage) with lyricist Carole Bayer Sager. Their romantic ballads, such as \"Easy to Love Again\" on the Sometimes Late at Night album, are markedly less complex than his works with David and more fitted\n\nto Sager's less-vernacular lyrics and personal singing style. Sager described it as a \"concept album, a song cycle in which each track ties into the next,\" in People magazine. Their most succesful colaborative song, \"That's What Friends are For,\" was created in 1985 as a benefit recording for a medical charity that promoted AIDS research.

For Joan Baez, through many years of performance, writing, and speaking out, the voice is a symbol of an individual's power to effect change. She was born in Staten Island, New York, January 9, 1941, the daughter of Dr. Albert Baez, a physicist. Baez's autobiography, And a Voice to Sing With, details her childhood as a faculty child in Ithaca, New York, and in Bagdad, Redlands, and Palo Alto, California, where she attended high school and began to play the guitar. Relocated to the Boston area, where her father had joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she attended Boston University and began to perform professionally at small clubs, such as Tulla's Coffee Grinder. Her two years of apprenticeship in the Boston area brought her to the attention of Bob Gibson, who invited her to participate in the 1959 Newport Folk Festival. Baez began a long association with Vanguard Records, then America's foremost folk label, in 1960 with her album Joan Baez. It brought acclaim and invitations to perform in folk clubs and concert halls throughout the college circuit and major cities. She soon became a symbol of the folk revival and was featured on the cover of Time. Her voice, described by Robert Shelton in a 1960 review of an early concert in the New York Times, was a \"a soprano voice, surprisingly never trained, that has a purity, penetrating clarity and control that not a few art singers would envy. With seeming effortlessness, Miss Baez produced a purling, spun-gold tone particularly suited to the lyric Anglo-American songs and ballads that made up most of her program.\" The phrase, \"achingly pure soprano,\" cited often by critics over the last 25 years, also dates from this first concert tour. She has denied the importance of the \"purity\" of her voice in interviews throughout her long career. In a 1963 article by Nat Hentoff, for example, she praised interpretation over mere quality: \"I think of a rural folk singer—Doc Watson's mother—whose voice might not seem beautiful to some people. But her voice has a straightness, an honesty, a purity. On the other hand, a voice may have all the tone quality and all the vibrato you could ask for, and yet it'll sound so bland that it has no beauty at all.\" Baez's voice, her songs, guitar style, and even her long flowing hair set a pattern for a generation of young folk singers and balladeers. The hair was cut in 1968, and the soprano has darkened and mellowed but the influence remains strong. Her tour of campuses was also noteworthy for Baez's refusal to perform in segregated arenas and concert halls—a decision that led her to limit the Southern part of her tours to black colleges. Raised as a Quaker, she also refused to pay that part of her Federal Income Tax which, the Society of Friends believed, was used for\n\n14\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nB\n\norn January 9,1941, in Staten Island, N.Y.; daughter of Albert (a physicist) and Joan (Bridge) Baez; married David Harris (an anti-war activist), 1968 (divorced, 1971); children: Gabriel.

Part of her income from performing and recording went to found the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence (now called the Resource Center for Nonviolence) in Carmel Valley, California. Her social activism also led to her support for the civil rights movement and its concurrent voting rights protests, as well as anti-war events around the world. She was arrested and jailed for non-violent protests of the Vietnam-era draft, as was her husband, David Harris, who spent much of their marriage in jail. Her focus throughout her life has been on nonviolent protest as a means of ending wars, war-related industries and national budgets, and discrimination. She has worked through Amnesty International since 1972 and Humanitas since its founding in 1979. Although most of her audience supported the same beliefs that she did, Baez's activities were often criticized publically by others. Her parodied but recogniz-\n\nable image was included in Al Capp's \"Li'l Abner\" comic strip as \"Joanie Phonie\" in 1967. Also that year, in a move that reminded many of the banning of famed black soprano Marian Anderson thirty years earlier, she was denied permission by the Daughters of the American Revolution to perform in Constitution Hall (capacity: 3800), and so she appeared instead before a crowd of over 30,000 at the Washington Monument. Baez's most controversial activity was her participation in a tour of (then North) Vietnam in 1972, which produced the album Where are You, My Son? The almost continuous concert tours and recordings for a decade brought Baez and her message to an ever wider audience. In a 1979 joint interview with Judy Collins, she told the New York Times that performance and the message are interrelated: \"The concert becomes a context of its own, and that's what's beautiful about being able to stand up there—that I can say what I want, put the songs where I want them and, hopefully, give people an evening of beautiful music as well.\" She has appeared on most college campuses, in Carnegie Hall and major concert halls, and in outdoor festivals. Baez was one of only four musical acts that participated in both Woodstock, the defining event of the late 1960s music scene, and in LiveAid, the 1985 international rock concert to raise money for African relief, an irony that she described in her autobiography. Both events reached a wide audience—Woodstock became a film from Warner Brothers; LiveAid was broadcast on worldwide television. Many of Baez's solo tours were also filmed as documentaries, among them, the Rolling Tunder Revue (with Bob Dylan, 1975) and Live Europe '83, which produced a French television film and an award-winning album of the same name. A 1970 documentary, \"Carry It On\" covers her life at the time of Harris's arrest, but also includes 13 songs in concerts. The folk revival of the 1960's brought widespread attention to traditional folk forms and to the young folksingers who were writing new music, most notably, Baez and Bob Dylan. They performed together often at the start of their careers, as in her 1963 Forest Hills Music Festival concert in New York at which she devoted half of the program to Dylan songs, sung by him, by her, and as duets. The New York Times review of that summer concert praised her programming decision: \"To have her so closely align herself with Mr. Dylan's charismatic poetry resulted in an unforgettable evening.\" They also toured together in the mid-1970's. Her performance of his \"Blowin\" in the Wind,\" was included on the Grammy Award presentations of 1983 as an example of \"Music has a message.\" Other Dylan songs, such as \"That's Allright\" and \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall,\" remain in her repertory.\n\nBaez • IS\n\nBaez was criticized at the onset of her career for mixing her musical messages and not limiting herself to music on a specific theme or from a specific genre, as was traditional with folk singers in the 1950's. she defended herself to Nat Hentoff in the November 1963 HiFiStereo Review: \"[The historical] aspect of folk music has always been so secondary with me. It's as if there were a mysterious string in me. If something I hear plucks that string, then I'll sing that song. It can be funny or serious, or it can be in another language. I can't analyze what qualities a song must have to do that to me.\" This generalism has become a major selling point in her later career. Baez's albums, like her concert appearances, always mix genres, including new songs (often about her son, Gabriel), American spirituals, Scottish hymns, and protest statements from different cultures. She has made recordings of folk songs paired with country-and-western numbers, as on her David's Album, which featured \"Carry It On,\" as well as her popular cut of \"Green Grass of Home.\" She stresses ballads and anthems by her and other contemporary writers, such as Leonard Cohen's \"Suzanne,\" and Lennon/McCartney's \"Imagine\" and \"Long and Winding Road\"; but also includes ballad standards from the\n\nLike Pete Seeger and the folk singers of the earlier generation, her voice is her conscience.\n\n1940s and 1950s, including Julie London's \"Cry Me a River\" on her Blowin' Away album. Her music follows its sources into their music heritages, and she was one of the first American singers to perform reggae songs, like her 1983 \"Warriors of the Sun,\" Latin American nonsalsa styles, and the now-popular new African genres. A 1977 Village Voice feature suggested that Baez's diversity had rescued her career and praised her use of rock-and-roll rhythms. In her 1987 Recently and on its tour, her repertory included, as it was described in the New York Times: \"a spare, moving rendition of Dire straits' pacifist hymn, 'Brothers in Arms', a version of the Marian Anderson staple, 'Let Us Break Bread Together,' that finds the singer buoyed by a gospel chorus, and two equally strong renditions of songs evoking the agony of South Africa: Peter Gabriel's elegaic incantation 'Biko' and John Clegg's passionate 'Asimbonanga'\" Baez's \"achingly pure soprano\" has deepened into a \"richer, more dramatic\" and fluid alto in recent years. A\n\n16 • Contemporary Musicians • Volume 1\n\nNew York Times review of a 1983 concert praised her rendition of the spiritual \"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\": \"Her rendition swept through two octaves with an authority and passion that few other singers could hope to muster.\" The dual role of Joan Baez as a performer and as, in the words of Rolling Stone's John Grissim, Jr., \"as a purveyor of an enjoined social consciousness and responsibility,\" has given her a place in American music that supports her activism. Like Pete Seeger and the folk singers of the earlier generation, her voice is her conscience. But for Baez, like Marian Anderson, the quality of her vocal production brings authority to her message.\n\nSelected discography Joan Baez, Vanguard, 1960. Joan Baez 2, Vanguard, 1961.

Promising a sundrenched paradise of fast cars and fast girls, where the surf's always up and the summer never ends, the all-American-looking musicians dominated the contemporary music scene for a good part of the 1960s. Unlike so many of their long-forgotten peers, however, the Beach Boys have remained popular year after year. In hits like \"Surfer Girl,\" \"Surfin1 U.S.A.,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" and \"Good Vibrations,\" the musicians combined catchy melodies with fantasy-filled lyrics to create a sound and a myth that continues to earn them scores of devoted fans. Indeed, pieces first regarded as faddish teen tunes have since won acclaim as original contributions to popular music, and many of the group's songs—like the Beach Boys themselves—are now considered classics. The core of the Beach Boys was formed around the Wilson brothers, Brian, Carl, and Dennis (drowned in\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nO\n\nriginally formed in Hawthorne, Calif., in 1961 as the Pendletones; name changed to the Beach Boys, 1961; original group consisted of Mike Love (full name, Michael Edward Love; born March 15,1941, in Inglewood, Calif.) lead vocals and saxophone; Brian Wilson (born June 20,1942, in Inglewood, Calif.) on keyboards and bass as well as being the group's composer and producer (has not toured with group since late 1960s); Dennis Wilson (born December 4,1944, in Inglewood, Calif.; died by drowning, December 1983) on drums; Carl Wilson (bom December 21, 1946, in Inglewood, Calif.) on guitar; and Al Jardine (born September 3,1942, in Lima, Ohio) on rhythm guitar; since late 1960s Bruce Johnston has taken Brian Wilson's place on live tours and has recorded with the band; numerous other musicians have recorded and performed with the group; debuted as the Beach Boys with the single \"Surfin',\" December, 1961; gave first professional performance, New Year's Eve, 1961; made first U.S. concert tour, 1962; made first major European tour, 1964.

The three brothers grew up in Hawthorne, California, a working-class suburb of Los Angeles several miles from the Pacific Ocean. Although the brothers received almost no formal musical training, they all demonstrated an interest in music fairly early in life. Brian, generally regarded as the genius behind the Beach Boys, is reported to have begun humming complete tunes at age eleven months and singing at age three; at sixteen, he was creating four-part harmonies with a simple tape recorder. Carl, a self-taught guitarist, also demonstrated a curiosity about music as a toddler. And by the time he was in his teens, Dennis, too, had become involved in the family pastime. The boys' talents were fostered both by their father, Murry, a machine-shop owner and unsuccessful songwriter, and by their mother, Audree, who enjoyed singing. Family get-togethers, which included the Love relatives, frequently featured sing-alongs and gave cousin Mike plenty of opportunity to prove he had perfect pitch. The music-making was pretty much restricted to family gatherings, however, until Brian,\n\nDennis, Carl, and Mike competed in their local high school's talent show one year. Billed as Carl and the Passions, a name created to persuade the hesitant Carl to participate with them, the boys viewed the venture as something of a lark. Not long afterwards, however, Brian, who had entered El Camino Junior College, began singing with fellow student and folk musician Al Jardine. The two thought it might be fun to start their own group and soon asked Mike, Carl, and Dennis to join them. Calling themselves the Pendletones, the five youths hoped to secure an audition with a recording company. When informed that they needed an angle and some original music to distinguish themselves from all the other aspiring musicians, the amateurs rose to the challenge. Dennis, a surfer, suggested capitalizing on the surfing craze that was just beginning to sweep California. As a result, Brian and Mike collaborated on a song they called \"Surfin'.\" The number interested the owners of Guild Music, the small recording and publishing operation that had published some of Murry's songs, and they arranged for the boys to record it. Although apparently put down live on a single track in just about an hour, \"Surfin\"' had a sound that appealed to the people at Cancjjx, a local label, and they agreed to release the single for the group, renamed the Beach Boys, in 1961. In short order the Beach Boys realized they had scored a success. The song appeared on the local charts and then, in mid-January, as number 118 on the Billboard charts. By the end of March \"Surfin\"' had reached number seventy-five, with sales hovering around fifty thousand copies. But more importantly, the single had attracted attention at Capitol Records, a pop label mainstay, and it wasn't long before the group signed a contract with Capitol that would carry them through the sixties. Their careers were launched. The Capitol Record years are widely regarded as the Beach Boys' most productive. Although much of their earliest material was significantly influenced by the pop sound of a 1950s vocal group called the Four Freshmen (Brian's favorite) and by rock and roller Chuck Berry (Carl's preference), the boys had managed to create a new sound for themselves and are often credited as the originators of surfing music. One of their initial singles for Capitol, the June 1962 release \"Surfin' Safari,\" was a hit, and their Surfin' Safari album, released in 1963, became their first gold record. A landmark year, 1963 saw the Beach Boys leap to national celebrity, their success far outstripping all expectations. As their popularity escalated, so did demand for live concerts, and the rising stars found\n\nBeach Boys • 19\n\nthemselves constantly on the road. After several years, Brian, the group's main composer, decided to stop touring; while he stayed home to create new material for the group, Bruce Johnston replaced him live. By the end of 1964, the Beach Boys had recorded six albums for Capitol. Their future looked promising, and in the middle sixties the group assured their star status with hits that included such favorites as \"Fun, Fun, Fun,\" \"I Get Around,\" \"Help Me, Rhonda,\" \"California Girls,\" and \"Barbara Ann.\" Impressively, the Beach Boys were one of only a handful of American acts to survive the British Invasion of 1964 that was spearheaded by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Their music not only tapped into the surfing mania and the subsequent car craze, but it had also unfolded as a creative new sound distinguished by pure, joyous harmonies. In 1966 the group released their most sophisticated and successful song until that time, \"Good Vibrations.\" By the end of the year polls were showing them to be the most popular group around, surpassing even the Beatles.\n\n\"The Wilsons' happy myth of an untrammeled life of endless summers struck a chord in American suburbia in a way no other popular musicians had done.\"\n\nNineteen sixty-six had also seen the release of their extraordinary Pet Sounds album, an unusual, innovative recording that critics acclaimed as one of the most brilliant in the annals of popular music. A departure from the Beach Boys' traditional fun in the sun themes, Pet Sounds employed extraordinary production techniques to help present an emotional exploration of the various states of mind experienced on the way to maturity. Perhaps too sophisticated for the typical Beach Boy fan of the day, Brian's brainchild album fared better with the critics than with the average audience. Before 1967 was half over, many people believed the Beach Boys were washed up. They had issued no new recordings for months and there was evidence of turmoil in the stars' personal lives as well as rumors of divisiveness within the group. In addition, their longawaited Smile album, expected to be Brian's masterpiece, was scrapped (a few recovered cuts appeared on Smiley Smile, issued in lieu of the original). In retrospect, however, it appears that the Beach Boys'\n\n20 • Contemporary Musicians • Volume 1\n\ncareers were only in remission. After their obscurity during the late 1960s, they made a successful European showing in 1970, reclaimed status in the United States the following year, and hit another peak when their 1974 album Endless Summer went double platinum. In 1975 Rolling Stone magazine named the Beach Boys band of the year. Although the Beach Boys in fact never quite regained the adulation they commanded during their heyday, the musicians have succeeded in remaining among the most popular, and most versatile, live entertainers in the business. They have survived not only extraordinary changes in popular music, but strife amongst themselves and their changing membership as well, including the 1983 death of Dennis Wilson. Woes notwithstanding, the group has continued to find itself in demand throughout the 1980s—albeit as \"oldies\" entertainment—and in recognition of their achievement, the members of the original Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Beloved by fans around the world, the Beach Boys, according to Timothy White in the New York Times, are regarded by many music lovers as \"the most successful musical group in American history.\" Trying to sum up the reasons for the group's appeal, White suggested that \"The Wilsons' happy myth of an untrammeled life of endless summers struck a chord in American suburbia in a way no other popular musicians had done. The essence of the American Dream is the belief that anyone can escape the limits and sorrows of his background by reinventing himself. . . . The Beach Boys themselves embodied and celebrated that dream.\"\n\nSelected discography Singles; For Candix \"SurfirV,\" 1961. \"Luau,\" 1961. \"Surfer Girl,\" 1962. \"Surfin' Safari,\" 1962. \"Judy,\" 1962. \"Karate,\" 1962.\n\nAlbums; For Capitol, except as noted Surf in' Safari, 1962.

Evans\n\nBeach Boys • 21\n\nChuck Berry Singer, songwriter, guitarist\n\n111 f there were a single fountainhead for rock guitar, I Chuck Berry would be it,\" wrote Gene Santoro in The Guitar. Indeed, the list of artists influenced by the \"father of rock and roll\" is nearly endless. From the Beach Boys and the Beatles to Jimi Hendrix and on to Van Halen and Stevie Ray Vaughan, every popular musician knows the impact that Chuck Berry has had on popular music. As Eric Clapton stated, there's really no other way to play rock 'n' roll. Born in 1926, Berry didn't take up the guitar until he was in junior high school thirteen years later. With the accompaniment of a friend on guitar, the two youths played a steamy version of \"Confessin\" The Blues\" which surprised, and pleased, the student audience. The reaction from the crowd prompted Berry to learn some guitar chords from his partner and he was hooked from then on. He spent his teen years developing his chops while working with his father doing carpentry. But, before he could graduate from high school, Berry was arrested and convicted of armed robbery and served three years in Algoa (Missouri). A year after his release on October 18, 1947, he was married and working on a family, swearing that he was forever cured of heading down the wrong path again. In addition to carpentry, he began working as a hairstylist around this time, saving as much money as he could make (a trait that would cause him considerable grief later in his life). Near the end of 1952 he received a call from a piano player named Johnnie Johnson asking him to play a New Year's Eve gig at the Cosmopolitan Club. Berry accepted, and for the next three years the band literally ruled the Cosmo Club (located at the corner of 17th and Bond St. in East St. Louis, Illinois). At the beginning the band (which included Ebby Hardy on drums), was called Sir John's Trio and played mostly hillbilly, country, and honky tonk tunes. Berry's influence changed not only their name (to the Chuck Berry Combo) but also their style. He originally wanted to be a big band guitarist but that style had died down in popularity by then. Berry cited sources like T-Bone Walker, Carl Hogan of Louis Jordan's Tympani Five, Charlie Christian, and saxophonist Illinois Jacquet as his inspirations, borrowing from their sounds to make one of his own. While the swing guitarists had a major impact on his playing, it was the blues, especially that of Muddy Waters, that caught Berry's attention. He and a friend went to see the master perform at a Chicago club, and with some coaxing, Berry mustered the nerve to speak with his idol. \"It was the feeling I suppose one would get from having a word with the president or the pope,\" Berry wrote in his autobiography. \"I quickly told him of my admiration for his compositions and asked him who\n\n22\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nF\n\null name, Charles Edward Anderson Berry; born October 18, 1926, in St. Louis, Mo.; son of Henry William (a carpenter) and Martha Bell (Banks) Berry; married Themetta \"Toddy\" Suggs, October 28, 1948; children: four.

Yeah, Chess Records over on Forty-seventh and Cottage.'\" Berry flatly rejects the story of him hopping on stage and showing up Waters. \"I was a stranger to Muddy and in no way was I about to ask my godfather if I could sit in and play.\" But he did take the advice and went to see the Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil. They were interested in the young artist but wanted to hear a demo tape before actually cutting any songs. So Berry hurried back home, recorded some tunes and headed back to Chicago. \"He was carrying a wire recorder,\" Leonard Chess told Peter Guralnick in Fee/ Like Going Home, \" and he played us a country music take-off called 'Ida Red.' We called it 'Maybellene.' . . . The big beat, cars, and young love. . . . It was atrend and we jumped on it.\"Phil chess elaborated, \"You could tell right away. . . . He had that something special, that—I don't know what you'd call it. But he had it.\" After the May 21, 1955,\n\nrecording session they headed back to the Cosmo Club, earning $21.00 per week and competing with local rivals like Albert King and Ike Turner. Unbeknownst to him, Berry shared writing credits for \"Maybellene\" with Russ Fralto and New York disc jockey Alan Freed as part of a deal Chess had made (also known as payola). The scam worked for the most part because by mid-September the song, which had taken 36 cuts to complete, was number 1 on the r&b charts. Berry was bilked out of two-thirds of his royalties from the song, but in later years he would reflect upon the lesson he learned: \"let me say that any many who can't take care of his own money deserves what he gets,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"In fact, a man should be able to take care of most of his business himself.\" Ever since the incident that's just what Berry has done. He insists on running his career and managing his finances the way he sees fit. The next few years, up till 1961, would see at least ten more top ten hits, including \"Thirty Days,\" \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" \"Too Much Monkey Business,\" \"Brown Eyed Handsome Man,\" \"School Days,\" \"Rock and Roll Music,\" \"Sweet Little Sixteen,\" \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Carol,\" and \"Almost Grown.\" Berry was a tremendous hit on the touring circuit, utilizing what is now known as his trademark. He explained its development in his autobiography: \"A brighter seat of my memories is based on pursuing my rubber ball. Once it happened to bounce under the kitchen table, and I was trying to retrieve it while it was still bouncing. Usually I was reprimanded for disturbing activities when there was company in the house, as there was then. But this time my manner of retrieving the ball created a big laugh from Mother's choir members. Stooping with full-bended knees, but with my back and head vertical, I fit under the tabletop while scooting forward reaching for the ball. This squatting manner was requested by members of the family many times thereafter for the entertainment of visitors and soon, from their appreciation and encouragement, I looked forward to the ritual. \"An act was in the making. After it had been abandoned for years I happened to remember the maneuver while performing in New York for the first time and some journalist branded it the 'duck walk.'\" The money from touring and record royalties were filling his pockets enough for Berry to start spending on some of the dreams he had long held. Around 1957 he opened Berry Park just outside of Wentzville, Missouri. With a guitar-shaped swimming pool, golf course, hotel suites, and nightclub, it was, next to his fleet of Cadillacs, his pride and joy. \"Now that's what I call groovy,\" Berry • 23\n\nhe told Rolling Stone. \"To own a piece of land is like getting the closest to God, I'd say.\" Things seemed to be going smoothly until 1961, when Berry was found guilty of violating the Mann Act. [Berry was charged with transporting a teenage girl across a state line for immoral purposes.] He spent from February 19, 1962 until October 18, 1963 behind bars at the Federal Medical Center in Springfield, Missouri. For years Berry denied this, claiming he was acquitted and never served time. He finally admitted the truth in his autobiography. He used his prison term constructively though, taking courses to complete his high school education and also by penning some of his most notable songs: \"Tulane,\" \"No Particular Place To Go,\" and \"Nadine.\" By the time he was released from jail the British Invasion was about to take over. Groups like the Beatles were churning out cover versions of Berry classics and turning whole new audiences on to him. While some artists might have cried rip-off (the Stones have done over ten of his tunes), Berry sees only the positive aspects. \"Did I like it? That doesn't come under my scrutiny,\" he told Guitar Player. \"It struck me that my material was becoming marketable, a recognizable product, and if these guys could do such a good job as to get a hit, well, fantastic. I'm just glad it was my song.\" Even so, remakes of Berry hits are more often than not considerably weaker than his originals. While it is a style that's remarkably simple, it's also next to impossible to duplicate with the same feel, humor and touch. \"Chuck Berry dominated much of the early rock scene by his complete mastery of all its aspects: playing, performing, songwriting, singing and a shrewd sense of how to package himself as well,\" wrote Santoro. As shrewd as Berry was, by the mid-1960s his type of rock was losing ground to improvisors like Eric Clapton, Mike Bloomfield, and Jimi Hendrix (all three of whom acknowledged Berry's influence, but were trying to break new ground). A switch from Chess to Mercury Records from 1966 to 1969 did little to help. He would continue touring throughout the 1960s without the aid of a regular backup band. Berry's method since the late 1950s has been to use pickup bands comprised of musicians from the city he's playing in. This has led to many complaints from fans and critics alike that his performances are sometimes shoddy and careless. In his book, Berry gives his own reasons, stating that \"drinks and drugs were never my bag, nor were they an excuse for affecting the quality of playing so far as I was concerned. A few ridiculous performances, several amendments to our band regulations, and the band broke up, never to be reconstructed. Whenever I've assembled other groups\n\n24 • Contemporary Musicians • Volume 1\n\nand played road dates, similar conditions have prevailed.\" (Berry reportedly accepts no less than $10,000 per gig and plays for no more than 45 minutes; no encores.) By 1972 he was back with Chess and produced his biggest seller to date, \"My Ding-a-Ling,\" from The London Chuck Berry Sessions. Selling over two million copies, it was his first gold record and a number 1 hit on both sides of the Atlantic according to The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock. He had hit paydirt, but his obsession to have a bank account with a $1 million figure led to another run-in with the law. In 1979 Berry was convicted of tax evasion and spent just over three months at Lompoc Prison Camp in California. Perhaps the one thing that has caused him more pleasure/pain than money is his fancy for women, stated simply in his book: \"The only real bother about prison, to me, is the loss of love.\" He hopes to write a book one day devoted solely to his sex life. While Berry's career has had the highest peaks and some pretty low valleys, he has survived while most of\n\n\"Chuck Berry dominated much of the early rock scene by his complete mastery of all its aspects: playing, performing, songwriting, singing, and a shrewd sense of how to package himself/'\n\nhis contemporaries have vanished. In 1986 Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richard, perhaps the ultimate student of the Chuck Berry School of Guitar, decided to put it all together with a 60th birthday-party concert to be filmed and released as a movie, \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.\" It took place at St. Louis's Fox Theater, a venue which had at one time refused a youthful Berry entrance because of his skin color. The show featured Berry's classic songs with Richard, Johnnie Johnson, Robert Cray, Etta James, Eric Clapton, Linda Ronstadt, and Julian Lennon also performing. Berry has also been honored with a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If that's not enough, \"Johnny B. Goode\" is riding around in outer space on the Voyager I just waiting to be heard by aliens. Despite the accolades, in his own book Berry shrugs off his contributions, stating that \"my view remains that I do\n\nnot deserve all the reward directed on my account for the accomplishments credited to the rock 'n' roll bank of music.\" Nevertheless, Rolling Stone's Dave Marsh's words seem to be more appropriate: \"Chuck Berry is to rock what Louis Armstrong was to jazz.\"\n\nCompositions Composer of numerous songs, including \"Almost Grown,\" \"Carol,\" \"Johnny B.

Stone\n\nBerry • 25\n\nA\n\nDavid Bowie Singer, songwriter\n\nfter playing in obscure groups in England during the 1960s—like George and the Dragons and David Jones and the Lower Third—David Jones took the name David Bowie to avoid being confused with Davey Jones, the rising star of the television-based pop group, The Monkees. His first album to be released in the United States, David Bowie: Man of Words/Man of Music, included the 1969 single \"Space Oddity,\" which brought him a great deal of favorable attention on both sides of the Atlantic. Thus began the career that Bowie would pursue in many different personas, such as those of Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, through many different types of music, from rock to danceable funk. As Jay Cocks put it in Time magazine, \"Musically, . . . Bowie always seems to know what time it is.\" In addition to being a rock trendsetter for two decades, Bowie has made successful appearances as an actor on Broadway and in films. Born in 1947 in Brixton, a deprived section of London, England, Bowie had a difficult childhood. His parents did not marry until after his birth, his brother was eventually confined to a psychiatric hospital, and Bowie's teenage fighting in his bad neighborhood led to the paralysis of his left eye, the pupil of which is permanently dilated. He has revealed in various interviews, however, that he noticed music from an early age, and that his parents provided him with the recordings of early American rock pioneers such as Fats Domino and Little Richard. Bowie also learned to play the guitar and the saxophone as a child. But having varied talents and interests, Bowie was undecided as a young man as to which of the arts he wished to specialize in. He studied commercial art at Bromley Technical High School in London, and left before earning a degree in order to work at an advertising agency, but soon quit because he disliked the work he was doing. He also studied with the Lindsay Kemp Mime Troupe for two and a half years, painted, and acted in small stage roles. At one time Bowie even considered entering a Buddhist monastery. Meanwhile, he continued playing in rock groups until meeting his future wife, Angela Barnet, who convinced a friend at Mercury Records to listen to Bowie's music. He followed his successful David Bowie: Man of WordsMan of Music with The Man Who Sold the World, which featured him wearing a dress and makeup on the cover. While this garnered the artist controversial attention and foreshadowed the glitter rock personas soon to come from him, Bowie went back to what most reviewers referred to as his 1960s pop style, reminiscent of singers Bob Dylan and Anthony Newley, for his 1971 recording for RCA, Hunky Dory. The well-received album includes the hit single \"Changes,\" and\n\n26\n\nFor the Record. . .\n\nB\n\norn David Robert Hayward Jones, January 8, 1947, in London, England; son of Hayward (a publicist) and Margaret Mary (a movie theater usher; maiden name, Burns) Jones; married Angela Barnet, 1970 (divorced, 1980); children: Joey (name originally Zowie). Worked in advertising and with the Lindsay Kemp Mime Troupe prior to musical career; performed with various bands during the 1960s, including David Jones and the Buzz, David Jones and the Lower Third, The Kon-rads, and George and the Dragons; solo performer since late 1960s. Actor in motion pictures, 1976—, including \"The Man Who Fell to Earth,\" \"Just a Gigolo,\" \"The Hunger,\" \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,\" \"Labyrinth,\" and \"Absolute Beginners\"; also appeared in theatrical production of \"The Elephant Man.\" Addresses: Home—Switzerland. Office—c/o 641 Fifth Ave., #22-Q, New York, NY 10022.\n\nBowie went from Ziggy Stardust to Aladdin Sane, made up with a lightning bolt drawn across his face and a painted-on tear drop; to the Thin White Duke, who slicked his hair back and wore white suits. In this last persona he recorded the 1975 Young Americans album, which included his hit duet with the late ex-Beatle John Lennon, \"Fame.\" As disco music was peaking in popularity, in \"Fame\" Bowie turned to a funk beat. But he told a Playboy interviewer: \"'Fame' was an incredible bluff that worked,\" because \"my rhythm and blues are thoroughly plastic.\" During the mid-1970s Bowie staggered under the weight of drug abuse problems. He confided to Loder that he sustained \"incredible losses of memory. Whole chunks of my life. I can't remember, for instance, any— any—of 1975.\" He eventually went to Berlin to recover. While he fought to overcome the excesses of his former lifestyle, he still put out albums, including Heroes, Lodger, and Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps). Bowie's music from this period is noted for its emphasis on electronic sounds. In 1980 he divorced Angela, retaining custody of his son, named Zowie in Bowie's glitter days but now\n\nwas described by John Mendelsohn in Rolling Stone as Bowie's \"most easily accessible, and thus his most enjoyable work.\" But Bowie did not really become a rock superstar until he released The Rise and Fall ofZiggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars in 1972. On the album, and in related concert appearances, Bowie took on the persona of Ziggy Stardust, an androgynous, space-alien rock star dressed in an outrageous costume, whose music was filled with great power. Ziggy was a story album, and chronicled the Stardust persona's adventures on earth, ending with his spiritual demise as portrayed in the final song, \"Rock'n'Roll Suicide.\" As Cocks explained, \"When he first hit the stage as Ziggy, decked out in makeup, dye job and psychedelic costume, the rock world was ready. Too much karma, too much good vibes, too much hippy dippy: audiences wanted decadence with a difference. Bowie was there.\" The singer found himself heralded as the king of glitter rock, a movement in the early 1970s that saw rock performers dressing in gaudy and often sexually ambiguous outfits. At about the same time, despite being married to Angela Barnet and having a son, Bowie told an interviewer that he was bisexual. As the first rock star to come out into the open on this subject, he was the object of a great deal of controversy. Later Bowie told Kurt Loder in Rolling Stone: \"The biggest mistake I ever made . . . was telling that. . . writer that I was bisexual. Christ, I was so young then. I was experimenting.\"\n\n\"Audiences wanted decadence with a difference. Bowie was there.\"\n\ncalled Joey. After signing a deal for five albums with EMI America, Bowie produced 1983's Let's Dance. The single of the same name, a danceable tune with a heavy, "
