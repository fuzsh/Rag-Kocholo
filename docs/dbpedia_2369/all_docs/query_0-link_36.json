        "text": "It’s been too long since my last blog. COVID drags on seemingly indefinitely. Everything seems stuck in quicksand. Politics is stale; Boris Johnson’s woeful government is still popular with the British electorate who seem to have forgotten the brave new world promised by Brexit. Instead, all the promises that have failed to materialise are blamed on COVID rather than exposed for the pack of lies that they were. Voters do not seem to appreciate the irony of reckless spending by the ‘socialist’ Labour party having being triumphantly beaten by careful Tories! Stop and consider how many of Jeremy Corbyn’s ‘insane’ spending pledges have been adopted by BJ’s government. Sadly, I have given up on British people. They seem to be dreaming of Trump getting back in power and re-igniting his love affair with Boris before leading the world into a devastating war. Of course, it won’t be their fault!\n\nSince I started to write this piece we have been hit by a shortage of lorry drivers which ‘threatens Christmas’. This rapidly escalated to a crisis when fuel deliveries to petrol stations erupted into panic buying and even fights breaking out in queues. The Government performed it’s now customary about turn offering more visas to foreign workers (the ones Brexit promised to rid us of) Within a couple of days, the Christmas deadline was further extended when insufficient numbers took up the offer. The press in Russia and Germany are taking great delight in poking fun at Britain.\n\nIt is a sign of the times that public support for the government remains strong and has not made the slightest difference in opinion polls. Kier Starmer has many qualities but I’m afraid he does not have the personality or presence to win a General election. Andy Burnham is popular with people and offers the best chance of Labour forming a government, unless David Milliband could be persuaded to come back!!\n\nWe should reflect that twenty years ago, the most devastating terrorist act of all time took place on 9/11. Twenty years on and trillions of dollars spent on wars, the world still feels a dangerous, divided planet. I have written before about conspiracy theories and the fact that perhaps, it is better that the official version of events is accepted. I still, however, am troubled that the BBC announced the collapse of building 7 of the World trade centre half an hour before it happened!\n\nSince all restrictions were lifted in July, Pat and I have emerged blinking from our Walney Island sanctuary and ventured forth into the wider world. There have been a couple of visits to our beloved Liverpool and a visit to Caitlin’s new drum in Ormskirk. We are still to see any bands but as more tours are announced I’m sure we will remedy that.\n\nFor the second year running COVID put paid to our planned visit to the USA. Instead, we booked a week in the Peak district. We rented a cottage in the village of Duffield, 5 miles North of Derby.\n\nWe stopped en route in Biddulph, a small town some 10 miles North of Stoke in order to walk the dog and pick up a few essentials. There was a small market in the town centre where I purchased 3 bottles of beer from the Flash brewery based in Buxton. Full marks, all three were excellent, try them if you get chance.\n\nThe cottage we rented was fantastic. Plenty of room, spotlessly clean and a short walk from the pub!\n\nThe first pub we tried was the King’s Head. First impressions were good, Timothy Taylors Landlord on tap and table service. Prices were steep and the clientele seemed pretentious. We left and walked to the Town Street Tap. This was a small place that didn’t look that promising however an old guy out for a smoke told me that is served the best beer in the village. They served three or four real ales and the same number of Craft beers plus some real ciders. C&C arrived with the dog and we enjoyed a few beers in a laid back atmosphere. We tried the White Star which was the nearest pub to our cottage. They served Landlord and had a great beer garden so a good night was had by all.\n\nIt was our first visit to this part of the country so we were looking forward to a journey of discovery. On the Saturday morning we dropped Caitlin and Callum off at Derby station as they were off to the Slam Dunk festival in Leeds. We headed for Sherwood Forest. I loved the Robin Hood story when I was a young boy and read many books and watched any tv series or film about this pioneering socialist hero. It was fantastic! The weather was glorious and I was transported back to my childhood. We gazed in awe at the Major Oak. According to local folklore, it was Robin Hood’s shelter where he and his merry men slept. It weighs an estimated 23 tons, has a girth of 33 feet (10 metres), a canopy of 92 feet (28 metres), and is about 800–1000 years old. The oak is now in need of a tree zimmer frame but I guess it’s only to be expected at that age! There were many fellow dog walkers and families enjoying the forest and many stopped to exchange pleasantries. It was an ambition fulfilled for me and it certainly didn’t disappoint. We had breakfast at the café when we arrived which was superb. As we finished our walk a game was just starting at Sherwood cricket club and it was nice to watch for a while. There is nothing more civilised or English as a village cricket match. On the way back to Duffield we stopped in Belper, a couple of miles from home. This little town sure loves steep fucking hills which I for one didn’t really appreciate. I was eager to checkout Groove records and supplement my collection. They had some great records on sale but at prices that would make a billionaire take a sharp intake of breath. Needless to say I departed empty handed.\n\nWe drove to Leeds later in the evening to pick C&C up from the festival. Even though I’m too old for Slam Dunk it was fantastic watching thousands of young people coming away looking like they’d had a great day.\n\nOn Sunday we thought we’d visit Matlock Bath in the afternoon. Big mistake !!! It was absolutely heaving. We drove up and down but couldn’t get a parking space anywhere near. I’ve never seen as many motorbikes. The town resembled Sturgis, South Dakota in August. The Derbyshire Hells Angels were more like the Black Widows from Every which way but loose than The Sons of Anarchy but please take that as a compliment because they were a friendly bunch. The place is too much like a seaside town for me, all tourist shops and cafes. What did come as a bit of a shock were the number of people queuing for fish and chips at the many cafes and takeaways. Perhaps living on the coast makes chippies something that we take for granted. We took the dog for a pleasant walk along the riverside and I made a mental note to return to try out the cable car. In the evening Pat and I went to the Viceroy, an Indian restaurant in the village. The meal and the service were superb. We stopped off in the Kings Head en route and I started to warm to it a little.\n\nMonday saw us visit Bakewell. A little town with a big reputation partly due to the pudding/tart to which it gives its name. Man it was fucking busy. It was market day and it seemed like the whole of England was visiting. The weather was glorious which probably attracted people as well. The market was OK, stallholders were friendly but it was too crowded for relaxed browsing. We walked around the town which allowed me to visit Green Man records. Like the place in Belper it had a decent selection but at laughable prices. Once again I departed empty handed now feeling sorry for Derbyshire’s record collectors who are getting ripped off when compared against other areas.\n\nI bought a Bakewell pudding for £7…………….Seven fucking quid!!!!!!!!\n\nOn Tuesday we visited Chesterfield. The town is famous for the crooked spire on the Church of St. Mary and all Saints. The aforementioned church led to Chesterfield F.C being named the Spirites.\n\nThe main reason for visiting Chesterfield was to checkout Tallbird records. Below is taken from the website;\n\nTallbird Record Shop was set up by me, Maria Harris, in 2013. Having just turned 50, I wanted a new challenge, and to get back into work after years of being a housewife and bringing up children.\n\nI’d worked in music retail for most of my adult life (with a short detour into the cinema industry in my 30s) – Richard’s Records in Canterbury, Beggars Banquet in Kingston-Upon-Thames, Alto in Carnaby Street and as a product manager for the Virgin Megastore chain.\n\nWhen we moved to Chesterfield in 2006 there were two shops selling music – HMV and Hudsons, but 6 years later both had sadly closed down leaving the town without a record shop, a lamentable state of affairs which I felt had to be put right.\n\nI took a leap of faith in the Summer of 2013 by signing the lease on 10 Soresby Street, the ideal premises for my little shop, tucked up a cobbled side street but just round the corner from the old Hudson’s shop and a stone’s throw from the Market Square. After weeks of agonizing I finally settled on a name for the business (yes, I am a tall bird!) and sketched out an idea which my clever old graphic designer Dad turned into the shop’s logo.\n\nWe returned to Matlock Bath on Wednesday to try out The Heights of Abraham. This is a tourist attraction that consists of a hilltop park on top of Masson Hill, accessed from the village by either the Heights of Abraham cable car or a steep zig-zag path (fuck that). The heights are named after a supposed resemblance to the Plains of Abraham, also known as the Heights of Abraham, in Quebec, Canada, where James Wolfe died in battle.[1][2]\n\nAmongst the attractions in the park, which has been open since Victorian times, are cavern and mine tours. There are also views of the dramatic scenery of the valley of the River Derwent. The cable car was opened in 1984 to provide easier access.\n\nPat doesn’t like heights so it required great bravery for her to get in the cable car. The dog was fine once he was in. Everything was fine until the car stops half way up (about 600 ft) for folk to take photos. Pat’s face assumed a deathly pallor and she leapt from the car when it eventually reached the summit. It was a glorious day and the views were spectacular. There is a café and restaurant but a nice walk and breathing the cool, clean air was more than enough.\n\nWhen we got back down I really appreciated how clean the air was at the top as it was now hot and muggy in the town. We stopped at a biker café for a coffee. There were 3 leather clad behemoths at the next table with their impressive hogs parked kerbside. They were all nice guys who gave us good advice about other places to try. We took a walk to the Bridge Inn, a pub with a beer garden overlooking the River Derwent. Director’s bitter was on offer and mighty fine it was too. We dined al fresco once again. Good food and beer in a fantastic setting.\n\nA visit to the Town street Tap followed. I grew really fond of this small pub. The beer and cider were really good and the staff very friendly. As with all the pubs, dogs are welcome and there was always a bowl of water and a few treats provided. There is no TV in the Tap and no music. The art of conversation thrives in this corner of the world\n\nOn our last day in Derbyshire we visited Dovedale. This is a valley cut by the River Dove that is about 3 miles long. The land is owned by the National Trust and is apparently a very popular walk. I’m glad we went early as there were many people heading out as we were on our way back. The walk is really good with great views. The big ticket there is the stepping stones across the river. You have to do it. It’s like a rural Abbey Road zebra crossing. Everyone pauses in the middle to be photographed which causes big traffic jams! We resisted the photo opportunity but did cross the river via the Stones on both the outward and inward walks.\n\nOn the way back to our cottage we stopped at Croots farm shop which several locals had recommended. A great place where I duly spent a fortune. I’m pleased to report that everything we bought tasted great.\n\nWe visited The Bridge Inn, The Town street Tap and the White Star on our last evening in Duffield. The Tap is definitely on my favourite pub lists.\n\nDuffield was a really friendly place. Locals stopped to pass the time of day with us tourists and gave us great advice about places to visit. In fact, everywhere we went over the week was full of friendly, helpful locals. I lost count of people who stopped to swap Beagle stories as we walked Remus.\n\nI would happily return to the Peak district. We didn’t visit Derby or Nottingham and didn’t make it to Buxton. I would have liked to visit Bolsover as I loved its former MP Dennis Skinner. The Beast of Bolsover as he was known was one of the last truly in it for his constituents’ politicians whose passing makes the House of Commons a drearier place.\n\nI mentioned earlier that we made a couple of trips to our beloved Liverpool. I added a few more pubs to my growing list of great places to drink. We stopped in at the Lady of Mann on Dale street. This pub is named after the eponymous Manx ferry which was built at the Vickers shipyard in Barrow in Furness. They sell Okell’s beer from the Isle of Mann and it was good to sit outside in the courtyard on a warm evening. We walked to the other end of Dale street to visit the Ship and Mitre which is a paradise for beer lovers as it serves a good range of real ales and craft beers. I fulfilled an ambition and ate at Bakchich, a Lebanese restaurant on Bold Street. I’ve been meaning to visit for years but it has always been full or we’ve had other plans. It didn’t disappoint even if it does only sell non-alcoholic drinks! We stopped in at the Pilgrim on Pilgrim street on our way to Ye Crack. We have walked past this place a few times as it doesn’t look too appealing from the outside. How wrong can one be? Caitlin had urged us to visit and it was a good tip. It’s a great pub, friendly patrons and good beer. What more can you ask?\n\nI could write about Liverpool pubs all day long (I certainly can drink all day in them!) I’ll just have to give a shout out to one more. I noticed The Dispensary on Renshaw street on my way to 81 Renshaw street, a record shop. We nipped in for a pint after a spot of vinyl foraging. It had a good selection of beers and was a relaxing place to plan the day ahead. There are some scabrous reviews of this pub on TripAdvisor. We had no bother, you can only take a place as you find it I guess.\n\nWe visited Strawberry Fields, another ambition of mine since I read about the exhibition opening. It is OK. I learned a lot about the Salvation Army, saw the piano that Lennon played on Imagine and watched a few interesting documentary clips. We walked around the gardens where Lennon played as a kid. The original house is no more which left me feeling ever so slightly cheated. The garden is OK, nothing to get too excited about. The main attraction I guess are the iconic red gates. You can park outside and see them from the outside without paying the steep admission fee. I’m glad I saw the exhibition but must admit that it was the gates I wanted to see.\n\nNext time we’re in Liverpool I am determined to see the Penny Lane street sign. A bunch of us are there in December so I hope to make it happen.\n\nWhen I was planning our trip to the Peak district I googled Derbyshire musicians. Kevin Coyne was the only result returned. I like Kevin’s music and many influential musicians have described themselves as Coyne fans, among them Sting and John Lydon. In the mid-1970s, prior to the formation of the Police, Coyne’s band included guitarist Andy Summers. Prominent BBC disc jockey and world music authority Andy Kershaw described Coyne as “a national treasure who keeps getting better” and as one of the great British blues voices. Kevin Coyne died in 2004 and had lived in Germany since the 1980’s. I wondered whether this lack of musical heritage contributed to the piss poor vinyl scene but Chesterfield’s Tallbird records restored my faith.\n\nWe are planning our holiday for 2022 now that Uncle Joe Biden has re-opened access to America. California is now off the menu and instead we plan to visit New Mexico, a state that we are yet to visit. Biden is going through a rough time at the moment with the withdrawal from Afghanistan upsetting many of the USA’s allies despite being committed to by Trump. The Don continues to flirt with running for president again in 2024. He is still holding rallies and claiming the 2020 election result fraud. Worryingly he now has higher approval ratings than Biden and the Republican Party is still in thrall to him. Boris Johnson will be rooting for the Don. As BJ beats his chest proclaiming Brexit a huge success despite a distinct lack of evidence of any benefits, he knows he will receive support from Trump who encouraged us to leave. Biden is lukewarm on Brexit to say the least, rightly concerned on negative impact to the Good Friday agreement and the Irish economy.\n\nIt’s taken an age to write this blog. I think COVID lethargy has given me writers block. I hope to get back to writing more often. We have tickets to see Richard Thompson at the end of the month so I hope to review.\n\nMonday 12th April 2021 saw the first wave of the re-opening of Great Britain. Non-essential shops have re-opened meaning a much needed haircut and the ability to visit record shops again for yours truly. Pubs can re-open providing they have an outside space in which to serve patrons. Despite not having been in a pub since Christmas Eve 2020 I couldn’t get too excited about sitting in the open air on a, still cold, spring day. A combination of cold air and heavy liquid intake plays havoc with the bladder and toilet access in said pubs was not covered in Bozza’s guidelines. May 17th sees Pubs able to welcome punters back indoors. May also has the tantalising prospect of foreign travel to countries deemed low-risk? We have a holiday to the USA booked in September and I must admit I am keeping everything that can be tightly crossed. Finally June 21st sees the end of all restrictions; life returns to normal and Covid is finally vanquished due to the Pharmaceutical industry developing vaccines in record time and our government deploying them rapidly and efficiently.\n\nSounds good doesn’t it? Is it too good to be true? Time will tell I guess, but already ahead of phase one, alarm bells are starting to faintly chime. Good old Boris said that this time he will follow the scientific data and pull back if the wrong signals are seen. Today’s newspapers have scientists pointing out that there are a few hotspots across the UK where infections are starting to rise at three times the national average. They are dismayed that politicians are choosing to ignore this data in the clamour to win popular support for their policy of rapid re-opening of the economy. The USA which has also rapidly deployed a vaccination programme is seeing infections rise at a disturbing rate in a good number of states. In addition to this, there have been a number of deaths recorded worldwide caused by blood clots in people who have received the Astra Zeneca vaccine. Initially dismissed as almost insignificant by our government, they have now said that the AZ vaccine should not be given to adults under the age of 30. Purely cautionary of course! There are similar reports of clotting caused by the Johnson and Johnson vaccine being reported across the world. There are risks with any vaccine of course but anything that causes people to refuse their jab poses a major risk as countries rush to kickstart their dormant economies.\n\nI am a libertarian at heart and long for the freedoms that I take for granted as a citizen of Walney Island but I confess that I worry about politicians that care more for votes than they do for people’s lives. Since I typed the last sentence the (devoutly right wing) Daily Mail has published a story claiming that last September Bozza angrily declared at a Downing street meeting that he would rather see bodies pile up than order another lockdown. The story has apparently been confirmed by several ‘Conservative sources’. BJ has of course denied making the statement but even his closest friends admit that Boris is a habitual liar.\n\nSo how did you get through the last year? Most of us have developed our own coping mechanisms. Sadly some have not been so lucky. There has been an upsurge in mental health issues and tragically there has been an increase in suicides.\n\nSometime in mid-April 2020 I started documenting every album I listened to. It had to be the full album to count. This was as a result of emails with Mark and Phil in Texas where we shared with each other our listening trends. I recorded my 500th album listening on 5th April 2021. I am able therefore to share with you the top 10 albums I have played the most and the top 10 artists that I have listened to over the past year.\n\nAlbums\n\nRain Dogs – Tom Waits\n\nTrouble and Love – Mary Gauthier\n\nLive at Blue Rock – Mary Gauthier\n\nThe Harrow and the harvest – Gillian Welch\n\nLive in London – Leonard Cohen\n\nBlood on the tracks – Bob Dylan\n\nDuckwalking – Chuck Berry\n\nTracy Chapman – Tracy Chapman\n\nFetch the bolt cutters – Fiona Apple\n\nRough and rowdy ways – Bob Dylan\n\nArtists\n\nBob Dylan\n\nMary Gauthier\n\nTom Waits\n\nPink Floyd\n\nLeonard cohen\n\nGillian Welch\n\nThe Beatles\n\nSteely Dan\n\nZZ Top\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nWere there any surprises in there for me? Well, I only rediscovered Rain Dogs during the pandemic and had forgotten what a magnificent album it is. I have long thought Waits as a genius and it all really comes together on this magnum opus. Fantastic lyrics, great musicianship and offbeat tunes. A favourite of critics, it is also credited by no lesser person than Keith Richards who cites Rain Dogs as one of the best albums he has played on and he’s played on a few classics n’est-ce pas ? It still irks me that Rod Stewart had a huge hit with Downtown Train yet few people have heard Waits’ original which is much better. Otherwise, I was somewhat surprised that my top ten included three double albums (Live at Blue Rock, Fetch the bolt cutters, Rough and rowdy ways and a triple album (Live in London). Lockdown meant having more time to relax so hence I found it much easier to concentrate for longer and give these extended albums the respect they deserve. Fetch the bolt cutters and Rough and rowdy ways were both released in 2020.\n\nFiona Apple is enjoying a renaissance and it is good that she feels able to exorcise some of her demons on Fetch the bolt cutters. Comrades, I urge you to check out this fantastic album.\n\nBob Dylan was 78 years old when he recorded Rough and Rowdy ways. It is incredible that it is more than 50 years since he recorded his first album. Sure his voice has not weathered too well, he sounds like an old man. The lyrics however are as sharp as they ever were and Murder most foul, about the killing of JFK, is as powerful as anything he has ever written. Rough and Rowdy ways is a rewarding listening experience and, no matter what age you are, we are all getting older by the day. The aforementioned Rod Stewart once wrote\n\n‘Youth’s a mask and it don’t last’\n\n‘live it long and live if fast’\n\nToo true brother Rod.\n\nWhen it comes to my top ten artists listened to I am not surprised to see that the majority are by artists renowned for their lyrics. Good lyrics are key to my favourite songs so the presence of the following artists is therefore no great surprise; Bob Dylan, Mary Gauthier, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, Gillian Welch, Joni Mitchell. They all write brilliant lyrics which qualify as poetry to me. All have touched my soul in some way whether they made me laugh, cry or even just think deeply.\n\nA few years ago we were on holiday on the Costa Del Sol when we got a call in the early hours of the morning to hear that my Father in law had passed away. We arranged a flight home as soon as possible and joined the rest of our family. Two weeks later we had tickets to see Leonard Cohen in Manchester. I was going to cancel but Mark emailed to say that Pat would find the show a cathartic experience and Pat said she wanted to get away for a night anyway.\n\nMark was as good as his word, Pat loved the show. I did myself, I’m not ashamed to say that I shed a tear a tear a two during the concert that lasted three hours. Cohen was 78 at the time but played one of the longest sets I have ever seen.\n\nLive in London reminds me of that show and I still shed the odd tear when I listen to it but smile and feel a warm glow all the way through. RIP brother Leonard you’ll never know the healing you brought to Pat and I.\n\nOnly two albums surprised me in making my top 10. Duckwalking by Chuck Berry only has eight tracks and is also a compilation. Every track is pure genius. Recorded in the 1950’s Chuck Berry’s music influenced a generation of white boys to pick up a guitar and try to emulate their hero. Every track on this album is a joy to listen to. So why am I surprised? I’m surprised because Chuck Berry was a despicable person by most accounts. Even Keith Richards who idolised Chuck described him as ‘difficult’. When you read accounts of Keith trying to help Chuck you’ll understand why. If you have daughters imagine how you’d feel if they brought someone like him home. Would you let your wife or daughter go to a bathroom in Chuck’s place???\n\nThe other was Tracey Chapman. It is a truly brilliant album, such powerful, emotive lyrics. The surprise was I hadn’t heard it in many years and rediscovered it in the cheap bin on a vinyl foraging expedition. If you haven’t heard it then check it out as soon as you can. Although she quickly disappeared from public consciousness, Tracey Chapman played on the Wembley stage at Live Aid. She never really recaptured the brilliance of her first album in my opinion but that doesn’t detract from the magic of her debut.\n\nHeaven at 27\n\n5th April 2021 was the 27th anniversary of the sad passing of Kurt Cobain. He was another member of the infamous ’27 club’. This club consists of musicians that died at the ‘mysterious’ age of 27. If you Google search the occult significance of any number between one and one hundred you will find some connection with any of them. I don’t believe that there is anything more significant about 27 than any other number. That said, some of the finest musicians who ever walked God’s great earth checked out at that age. Many of the 27 club died tragically. The members of the club are not exclusively musicians. Anton Yelchin and Jonathan Brandis for instance are actor members of the club. It is, and always be, however, musicians who are the most famous members. So I pay tribute to the 10 musical members of the 27 club who have made the biggest impact on my life.\n\nRobert Johnson\n\nIf you know anything at all about music then you are familiar with the story of Robert Johnson. Son House remembered Johnson as a “little boy” who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace, possibly searching for his natural father. When Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he seemed to have miraculously acquired an awesome guitar technique.\n\nSon House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson’s pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnson’s technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.\n\nJohnson allegedly met the Devil at the Crossroads of Highways 61 and 49 in Clarksdale Mississippi and sold his soul in exchange for awesome guitar skills. Johnson died in Greenwood Mississippi at the age of 27 of suspected poisoning by a jealous husband and the club was thus formed.\n\nJohnson only recorded 29 songs but his legacy lives on. I have stood at the Crossroads and stayed at the hotel in San Antonio Texas where he recorded his first songs in 1936. I’m sad to report that his guitar mojo hasn’t rubbed off on me!!\n\n(596) Robert Johnson – Me And The Devil Blues With Lyrics – YouTube\n\nBrian Jones (1942-1969)\n\nA founding member of the Rolling Stones along with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Brian Jones developed a severe substance abuse problem that by the mid-1960s had taken a toll on his health, landed him in jail and alienated him from his bandmates. He was forced out of the group in June 1969. The following month, Jones was found dead at the bottom of his swimming pool; police reported that he had drowned while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Recently, new evidence has suggested that foul play may have had a hand in his death at age 27.\n\nLike Chuck Berry, Jones was a genius who was apparently not a nice person. He allegedly treated women appallingly. He never really recovered from Anita Pallenberg leaving him for Keith Richards due to his behaviour which in turn led to him being ostracised by his bandmates.\n\nSadly many geniuses in all walks of life have flawed personalities. The Rolling Stones were Brian Jones’ band. He was elbowed aside My Mick and Keith however, without him, the greatest Rock’n’Roll band in the world would never have existed.\n\n(596) Rolling Stones Paint It Black HD – YouTube\n\nAlan “Blind Owl” Wilson (1943-1970)\n\nKnown as Blind Owl because of his poor vision, Alan Wilson headed up the American blues band Canned Heat, which performed at Woodstock in 1969. A songwriter, guitarist and harmonica player, he famously re-taught the aging blues legend Son House, who had been living in obscurity for decades, how to play his own songs. Wilson, who struggled with mental illness and had previously attempted suicide, succumbed to a drug overdose in September 1970, becoming the first of three acclaimed musicians to die at age 27 in 1970.\n\n(596) Canned Heat – On the Road Again live at Woodstock 1969 – YouTube\n\nJimi Hendrix (1942-1970)\n\nRemembered as one of the greatest electric guitarists in history, Jimi Hendrix revolutionized rock and roll as both an artist and a producer during his brief four-year career. Most guitarists agree that Hendrix was the best. All who saw him play or jammed with him agree he was untouchable as a guitarist. His performance of the Star Spangled Banner at Woodstock is truly jaw dropping. Jimi was also one of Cynthia Plaster Casters’ prize scalps. She named her cast of Jimi the ‘Penis de Milo’\n\nJimi died in London in September 1970, asphyxiating on his own vomit while sleeping. His girlfriend claimed that Hendrix, a heavy drug user who was particularly fond of LSD, had washed down a handful of sleeping pills with red wine before going to bed.\n\nAs with many Rock star deaths, conspiracy theories abound. I doubt we’ll ever know the truth so we must just celebrate his legacy through his awesome guitar playing.\n\n(596) Jimi Hendrix Experience All Along The Watchtower – YouTube\n\nJanis Joplin (1943-1970)\n\nBorn in Port Arthur Texas, Janis Joplin won over the San Francisco music scene with her bluesy vocals and powerful stage presence. First as the lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company and later as a solo artist. Despite multiple attempts to get clean, she became increasingly addicted to heroin and alcohol as her career skyrocketed. She died of a heroin overdose in October 1970, less than three weeks after the death of fellow rock icon Jimi Hendrix.\n\nJanis Joplin is the greatest ever female singer in my opinion. Her life story fascinates me; the bullying she suffered at High school is redolent of today’s social media trolling. I would love to have known Janis Joplin. I know we would have got on like a house on fire. In 2014 Pat, Caitlin and I went to Barney’s Beanery, the West Hollywood bar where Janis enjoyed her last drink before returning to the Landmark Motel and suffering a fatal overdose. RIP Janis you were the greatest.\n\n(596) Janis Joplin – Me And Bobby McGee (Audio) – YouTube\n\nJim Morrison (1943-1971)\n\nA poet and avid reader of philosophy, Jim Morrison rose to prominence as the lead singer and lyricist of The Doors, a band he founded with a friend in 1965. By 1969, his drinking had become a problem, making him late for performances and fuelling raucous onstage behaviour. In July 1971, Morrison died of a heart attack apparently caused by a heroin overdose while living in Paris. It is thought that he mistook the drug for cocaine and snorted a fatal amount. Morrison allegedly moved to Paris to get clean and rediscover the poet he longed to be.\n\nMany conspiracy theories surround the death of Jim Morrison and there do seem to be many inconsistencies in official accounts of his death. His grave in Pére Lachaise Cemetery in Paris still attracts thousands of pilgrims every year paying homage to his awesome talent. RIP Mr Mojo Risin’.\n\n(596) Riders on the Storm – The Doors HD – YouTube\n\nRon “Pigpen” McKernan (1945-1973)\n\nA founding member of the Grateful Dead, Ron McKernan, who went by the nickname Pigpen, did not share his bandmates’ predilection for LSD and other psychedelic drugs. However, his heavy drinking caused him to develop cirrhosis in 1970, and by 1972 his health had become so fragile he could no longer tour. He died of an internal haemorrhage in March 1973.\n\nPigpen lived with Janis Joplin for a while in the Grateful Dead house at 712 Ashbury street in San Francisco. Two 27’s for the price of one.\n\nI have walked past the house a few times. It is now a genteel neighbourhood and the house must be worth millions. I wonder if the vibes of late sixties Haight Ashbury still resonate inside?\n\n(596) Grateful Dead – Friend of the Devil (Studio Version) – YouTube\n\nGram Parsons (1946-1973)\n\nGram Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968 and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd Chris Hillman formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969. Emmylou Harris assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, GP, released in 1973. Although it received enthusiastic reviews, the release failed to chart. His next album, Grievous Angel, peaked at number 195 on the Billboard chart. His health deteriorated due to several years of drug abuse and he died in 1973 at the age of 27. His legendary status was confirmed when he died on September 18 (same date as Jimi Hendrix), 1973, in room eight of the Joshua Tree Inn, near Joshua Tree National Park. Earlier, he had confessed to his manager Phil Kaufman his wish to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the park in the event of him dying.\n\nParsons travelled to Joshua Tree with his high school girlfriend. Parsons spent time in the desert during the day and at local bars at night, consuming barbiturates and alcohol every day. On September 18, after being injected with morphine, Parsons overdosed. On September 19, he was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.\n\nFollowing Parsons’ death, and in order to fulfil his desires, Kaufman and Martin arrived at Los Angeles International Airport in Martin’s personal Cadillac Hearse impersonating mortuary workers. Under the impression that the pair had been hired by the Parsons family, Western Airlines released the body to them. They then took it to Joshua Tree and set it on fire. The burning casket was reported by campers to the local authorities, who investigated the incident and identified both perpetrators.\n\nParsons’ body was partially cremated. His charred remains were recovered and returned to his family.\n\nParsons hung out with the Stones when they recorded Exile on Main Street and he recorded a great version of Wild Horses.\n\nGod permitting, Pat and I will visit the Joshua Tree National Park in September. I will raise a glass to Gram and play some of his tunes in homage.\n\n(596) Love Hurts – Gram Parsons & Emmylou Harris – YouTube\n\nKurt Cobain (1967-1994)\n\nAn icon of the Seattle grunge scene, Kurt Cobain formed Nirvana with a friend in 1985; the band achieved mainstream success in the early 1990s. Under a glaring public spotlight, Cobain struggled with mental illness, chronic health problems and heroin addiction. He committed suicide in April 1994, leaving behind his wife, the musician Courtney Love, and their baby daughter Frances Bean.\n\nAnother death surrounded by a fog of conspiracy theories. There are many books on the subject of Kurt’s death. I don’t think that we’ll ever know what really happened so I prefer to remember him for his genius. I love the fact that the title of Nirvana’s best known track was sprayed on the wall of Kurt Cobain’s hotel room by Kathleen Hanna of the band Bikini Kill. She wrote “Kurt smells like Teen Spirit” in reference to a deodorant brand that Cobain’s girlfriend at the time wore.\n\nThe video below was filmed less than a year before Kurt died. Does he look tortured? Difficult to say.\n\n(596) Nirvana – Where Did You Sleep Last Night (Live On MTV Unplugged Unedited) – YouTube\n\nAmy Winehouse (1983-2011)\n\nAn English singer-songwriter whose powerful voice and unique style won her numerous awards and honours, Amy Winehouse battled drug and alcohol addiction for years. Her substance abuse problems were frequent tabloid fodder and inspired some of her songs, most notably the hit “Rehab.” On July 23, 2011, Winehouse was found dead in her London apartment, becoming the latest musician to have their career cut tragically short at age 27.\n\nAmy Winehouse always seemed a victim to me. Prodigiously talented, there were always people who leeched off her.\n\nI love having a beer in her former local, The Hawley Arms in Camden. She is fondly remembered by regulars; apparently if it was busy she would get behind the bar and help the staff out. A latter day Janis Joplin in my eyes.\n\n(596) Amy Winehouse with Jools Holland – Monkey Man – YouTube\n\nSpookily, while I have typed the above I have been listening to Who’s Next !!!\n\nThe last 12 months has also seen me pay much more attention to my love of reading. I have had both the space and desire to concentrate on reading weightier tomes on subjects that improve my understanding both of me and the world I live in. I often say and think that I despise politics and politicians both in society and work. Over the past 12 months I have developed a fascination with both national and American politics. I started lockdown by reading In My Life, the music memoir of former Labour Home Secretary and all round good bloke Alan Johnson. This book resonated with me so much that I felt I was reading my own memoirs.\n\nThus inspired, I read the three volumes of Johnson’s autobiography; This Boy, Please Mr Postman and The Long and winding road. Musical Savants will note that all four books are named after Beatles songs. Johnson’s life story is genuinely fascinating. At times harrowing it is also a beacon of hope to those who aspire to rise from truly humble beginnings and make a difference to the lives of their fellow humans.\n\nOn the same political theme, the past five years have been truly dominated by Donald J Trump. The man truly repels me and most decent humans. I read four books over the past 12 months that are fascinating, jaw dropping and genuinely frightening;\n\nA Very Stable Genius: Donald J Trump’s Testing of America – Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig\n\nCollateral Damage – Kim Darroch\n\nA Year At The Circus: Inside Trump’s White House – John Sopel\n\nUnPresidented: Politics, pandemics and the race that Trumped all others – John Sopel\n\nAll four of the above books left my chin badly bruised as there are so many truly jaw-dropping events described.\n\nOne final political book was, somewhat surprisingly, my favourite\n\nDiary of an MP’s Wife: Inside and Outside Power: – Sasha Swires\n\nThis book is the riotously candid account of Swires’ time as the wife of one of David Cameron’s ministers and a member of his privileged social set. I’m sure it has made her few friends but she is an acute observer of how the levers of government work and of how the true power in this country influences our lives.\n\nI have also read a good few books that have helped me along my own spiritual journey;\n\nSurrounded by Idiots – Thomas Erikson\n\nSurrounded by Psychopaths – Thomas Erikson\n\nThe Four Tendencies – Gretchen Rubin\n\nI recommend all three of the above if you want to understand more about yourself and also those around you!\n\nThere are too many novels that I have read over the past twelve months to document or to even call out highlights. I will leave them to a future blog as there are more than enough books above to immerse yourself in.\n\nPa’lante\n\nWriting this blog has allowed me to reflect on how twelve months of lockdown has affected me and my family. As we all emerge blinking into what is hopefully a new dawn I have felt that there is something missing from my life. Sadly, on reflection, I’m missing the Don. Politics is dull in a Trump free world. I used to open the media websites at 6.0 AM as I sat down for breakfast eagerly looking forward to reading the latest batshit crazy missives from the White House. I now see why Don calls Biden Sleepy Joe. President Biden takes the responsibility of leading the free world seriously and bears the responsibility of rebuilding the American economy and promoting racial harmony with great honour. Laudable but dull compared to the Don……………..Thankfully!!!\n\nBoris Johnson is trying his hardest but he is no better than Trump lite. Boris’ weapon of choice is Sleaze. Whether it be through lies, cronyism or good old corruption, Boris is determined to maintain his grasp of power. Sadly, in some ways COVID-19 has been a blessing for Boris. The tragedy of Brexit has largely been kept out of the headlines. The many businesses that have gone bust or have been forced to re-locate to Europe have been kept from the front pages by the pandemic.\n\nThe successful deployment of COVID vaccines has been claimed by Boris’ government. Let’s not forget that this has been down to the dedication and efficiency of the NHS and its heroic staff. The Government has recognised their efforts by awarding them a 1% pay rise which keeps them just above minimum wage!!!\n\nWe are facing Scottish devolution, the return of the troubles in Northern Ireland which will surely lead to a push for a united Ireland, both fuelled by the devastating fall-out of Brexit.\n\nThe Labour party similarly should hang its head in shame. While its traditional Northern heartland faced economic devastation, Jeremy Corbyn surrounded himself with London sycophants and buried his head in the sand rather than try to help his party’s core base. Kier Starmer is an improvement but it is the likes of Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy who appeal to core Labour voters and I don’t believe they are afforded sufficient respect by the party leadership.\n\nWhat is really boiling my piss is the astronomical cost of refurbishing Boris’ flat. He is clearly lying about the funding. His former ally Dominic Cummings has turned on his former friend and is laying bare the duplicity of our Prime Minister. What upsets me most is of Boris Johnson wanting rid of his predecessors ‘John Lewis nightmare décor’.\n\nI would love to be able to afford to buy John Lewis furniture so am deeply insulted by this despicable snobbery.\n\nTo those Labour voters, who now vote Tory, hang your heads in shame. They’ll never like you. You are just cheap fools who are easily conned. Please see through this corrupt and decadent idiot and think about restoring pride to the working people of Great Britain who are the true back bone of our nation\n\nAmen Comrades.\n\nHappy New Year comrades. I hope you have enjoyed the Christmas break and are looking forward to a better year. I expect I am not alone in being glad to see the back of 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic cast a dark shadow over pretty much the whole year. 2021 sees us back in lockdown but with various vaccines offering a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nWe Brits also begin life outside the European Union. Even as a fervent Europhile, I’m glad that it has finally been resolved so that we can start to get used to a new reality. My big worry is that our divorce from Europe results in a rabid growth in political populism. Populists depend on having enemies, be they real or imagined, to deflect from their own shortcomings. If Brexit fails to deliver the huge economic benefits its proponents promised who will be to blame? For a short time problems will be blamed on ‘Johnny Foreigner’. That can’t last long, after all we’ve got we wanted…………..haven’t we? My biggest fear is Boris Johnson replacing Donald Trump as the face of populism. The parallels are disturbing. BJ has become known for spectacular U turns, just ask Marcus Rashford. Who can forget him lambasting Opposition leader Kier Starmer for daring to propose that he follow scientific advice and impose a two-week national “circuit breaker” lockdown for England in September. In October he announced a month-long national lockdown, saying “no responsible prime minister” could ignore how bad the situation had become……………….no shit Sherlock!!!!!\n\nBozza has already out trumped Trump when it comes to cronyism. Remember Dominic Cummings flagrantly flouting lockdown rules early in the pandemic? He justified a trip to Barnard Castle by saying that he was worried about his vision and therefore his ability to drive back to London. In order to try it out he drove his 4 year old son on a 40 mile round trip!!!!!. Boris believed in him and he kept his job. Home Secretary Priti Patel was accused of bullying. A cabinet office enquiry, the results of which were ‘sat on’ for months concluded that she had broken the ministerial code of conduct, however, Boris Johnson ignored the findings and ruled that she did not break the code. As a result, she kept her position. Last but not least, good old Boris announced he had given a peerage to the Tory donor Peter Cruddas, in defiance of advice from the House of Lords. Earlier in the year he awarded a peerage to his own brother. Boris makes Don look like a saint!!!\n\nI’m sure that Bozza will be yelling ‘fake news’ at critics and will refuse to talk to ‘those lefties at the BBC’. I dread Britain’s youth arriving back in European beach resorts this summer, drunkenly singing Rule Britannia and threatening bemused locals. I equally dread the SNP forcing and winning a second independence ballot thus effectively breaking up Great Britain………………Still, Boris will get to wear a red MEGA baseball cap , MEGA being ‘Make England great again’!!!\n\nThere is plenty to cheer about. Biden will hopefully re-embrace the Kyoto treaty giving a vital boost to tackling climate change. Hopefully Joe will reverse the insular politics of Trump and once more America will become the leaders of the free world. While Trump turned inwards, Russia and China started to spread outwards. Biden may not be the greatest president but hopefully one that re-unites his country and the western world.\n\nIf the vaccines deliver, hopefully we can start travelling again. 2020 saw slim pickings for us. Overnights in Liverpool and Sheffield plus a week in Halifax were all very enjoyable but how we yearned for more. The only gig we saw last year was Elvis Costello.\n\nWe have tickets to see Chuck Prophet at the Met in Bury in June (a gig twice postponed due to ‘Rona) and the Slambovian Circus of dreams in August at Greystones, Sheffield. I’m sure there will be many more gigs as venues reopen and bands resume touring. As I type, I’m listening to Margo Price who I dearly hope makes it over to the UK this year.\n\nIn a spirit of optimism we have re-booked our USA trip which was cancelled in June 20 (another Rona victim). We are off to Texas and California in September and look forward to seeing friends and family on their home turf. I can’t wait to spend an afternoon ‘In the Chilli parlour bar, drinking Mad dog Margaritas’ with the ghosts of Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark. I look forward to drinking Jack and Cokes with the ghost of Lemmy in the Rainbow bar and grill in LA and raising a glass to Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison in Barneys Beanery.\n\nI can’t wait to get back to Liverpool and maybe even squeeze in a trip to London. A gig at the Trades club in Hebden Bridge is a burning ambition for 2021.\n\nCloser to home, I can’t wait to attend another meeting of the CRAFT club. We have taken to convening in the Old Friends in Ulverston and staying there until the rules of membership have been met.\n\nOn the music front, 2020 delivered some great albums. I have collated my personal top 10 for your delectation. I would love to think that some of you will put aside any preconceptions you may harbour and check some of them out.\n\nRough and rowdy ways – Bob Dylan\n\nIt’s extraordinary to think that Bob’s career is into its sixth decade! If there’s one thing Rough and Rowdy Ways will be remembered for, it’s for its first single, and Dylan’s longest studio track to date, “Murder Most Foul”. Provided its own side to itself, and allegedly recorded “a few years ago”, the idea of a 17-minute Bob Dylan song about the assassination of John F. Kennedy sounds unlikely to say the least. Thankfully, Bob is at the top of its game for this experiment. Taking his point of view from himself, to the assassins, to the car itself playing topical music through its radio; Dylan is able to build an entire world around this singular American tragedy.\n\nThere are too many highlights to draw attention to any more songs. Bob Dylan’s lyrics at times seem too eerily prescient, musing on the mortality of man and the loss of innocence. Given the state of the world in 2020 and that Rough and Rowdy Ways was recorded before the height of COVID-19 and the death of George Floyd, it feels like Bob could see the way the world was turning.\n\n(324) Bob Dylan – Murder Most Foul (Official Audio) – YouTube\n\nFetch the bolt cutters – Fiona Apple\n\nFiona Apple’s fifth album reminded me of Swordfish Trombones by Tom Waits in the way that it marked a radical departure from her previous output. Fetch the Bolt cutters is a stark and raw album, instrumentation is mostly Apple’s piano backed by offbeat percussion. It’s the lyrics that make this album. The abuse of women is one of her themes. Here, For Her contains one of Apple’s most eyebrow-raising lyrics. “Good morning, good morning/ You raped me in the same bed your daughter was born in,” she snarls. The track was written in the aftermath of the accounts of sexual assault given to the US senate judiciary committee, which failed to block the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court.\n\nRelay, meanwhile, swaps between a cheerleading chant and R&B. It’s a spectacularly acerbic song about refusing to indulge in the game of acrimony. “And I see that you keep tryna bait me,” pouts Apple, “and I’d love to get up in your face/ But I know if I hate you for hating me/ I will have entered the endless race.”\n\nThe title track rues the mistakes Apple made as a younger woman, and bridles at those who controlled her. She invokes Kate Bush, another artist who became famous very young and quickly outgrew the confines of pop.\n\n“I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill,” Apple sings, “Shoes that were not made for running up that hill/ And I need to run up that hill/ I will, I will, I will.” If this engrossing album opens with one kind of breathless climax, Fetch the Bolt Cutters ends with Apple panting, having finally crested the summit.\n\nThank you to the Guardian review which drew my attention to this great album and encouraged me to buy it ‘unheard’.\n\n(324) Fiona Apple – For Her (Official Audio) – YouTube\n\nThe Unravelling – Drive by truckers\n\nThis album saw the DBT give a state of the nation address to America in 2020. Lyrically, the album is filled with rage: about school shootings (Thoughts and Prayers), immigrant children (Babies in Cages), the opioid epidemic (Heroin Again), the manufacturing of anger for political ends (Grievance Merchants), and “working hard for not enough” (21st Century USA). In an interview to promote the album, band leader Patterson Hood described a situation where “My daughter was in a lockdown drill at her school last week, she was locked in a closet with 27 other kids for over 20 minutes, not knowing if it was a drill or not. It’s to prepare for if someone comes and starts shooting up their school.” Bandmate Mike Cooley says “We’re starting to ask questions now, ‘Are we inflicting trauma on these kids, on the off chance this could happen?”\n\nIt’s a dark album that may alienate some of their fan base in the USA but in my opinion addresses issues that ‘normal folks’ are faced with. The (apparently equally dark) follow up The New OK is released in the UK in early January and I can’t wait to hear it. I also look forward to an album of unbridled optimism influenced by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris!!\n\n(324) Drive-By Truckers – “Thoughts and Prayers” (Official Lyric Video) – YouTube\n\nThat’s how rumours get started – Margo Price\n\nThat’s How Rumours Get Started is the third studio album by Margo Price. The album was planned for release on May 8, 2020, but was postponed following the outbreak of the coronavirus. … The album was released on July 10, 2020. Coincidentally my birthday!\n\nAt 37 Margo Price has already lived enough to fill a book. Her parents lost their farm when she was a toddler in the mid-80s downturn that provoked the Farm Aid benefit gigs. Her musical career was jump-started by a psilocybin-fuelled psychedelic epiphany. Her early years on the Nashville side-lines saw her reduced to petty theft in order to survive, involved a period sleeping in a tent, the death of her infant son, the latter precipitating a descent into whiskey-fuelled chaos that culminated in a car crash and a brief stay in prison. Self-funded, the recording of first album Midwest Farmer’s Daughter was a last roll of the dice that Price pawned her wedding ring for.\n\nThankfully Jack White pricked up his ears and listened and set Margo on the road to success.\n\nThis is her third album and I’m glad to report that success has not dampened the acerbic lyrics. I can’t wait to see Margo tour this album in the UK.\n\n(324) Margo Price ‘That’s How Rumours Get Started’ – The Blues Kitchen Presents… – YouTube\n\nHeart’s ease – Shirley Collins\n\nShirley Collins was one of England’s foremost Folk singers of the sixties and seventies. Following a painful divorce in 1978 Collins lost her singing voice and retired. In 2016 Collins returned out of the blue with the critically lauded album Lodestar. Heart’s ease is a more confident album and is an absolute joy to listen to. At 85, Shirley Collins managed to deliver an extraordinary album.\n\n(324) Whitsun Dance – YouTube\n\nBonny Light Horseman – Bonny Light Horseman\n\nBonny Light Horseman are a collaboration between singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell, Eric D. Johnson from the Fruit Bats, and multi-instrumentalist Josh Kaufman, based around traditional pastures.\n\nOn their self-titled debut, the trio reimagines centuries of standards for our fractious political climate, making old chestnuts feel new.\n\nThe land that time forgot – Chuck Prophet\n\nI was really looking forward to seeing Chuck Prophet but the show we had tickets for was cancelled twice due to ‘Rona. It is now scheduled for June 2021……….fingers crossed!\n\nIn the meantime I made do with chuck’s new album. Recorded in the Catskills as it has become too expensive to make an album in his San Francisco hometown\n\nA great set of songs about his country that fans declared a triumph. Even though there is liberal use of drum machines I loved Chuck’s latest.\n\nOff off on – This is the kit\n\nThis is the Kit were formed by Kate Stables when she moved to Bristol. Now domiciled in Paris, she delivered her fifth album in 2020. Produced by Josh Kaufman of Bonnie light horseman, Off Off On was a worthy addition to an already impressive body of work.\n\nWorking Men’s Club – Working Men’s Club\n\nWorking Men’s Club are a young band whose leader hails from Todmorden in West Yorkshire. A line-up change saw the band evolve from a guitar band into a New Order-type rock-electronic hybrid. There are shades of fellow Yorkshire luminaries Human League and Pulp on this assured debut with the closing track Angel evoking Hawkwind. I look forward to watching this group develop. Mega stardom beckons methinks.\n\n(326) Working Men’s Club – John Cooper Clarke (Official Video) – YouTube\n\nOld Wow – Sam Lee\n\nSam Lee’s third album was one of the Folk music albums of the year. Produced by Suede’s Bernard Butler it also features a spine-tingling duet with the Cocteau Twins’ Elizabeth Fraser on Wild Mountain Thyme. Another performer who I look forward to watching their career develop.\n\nAs I completed this blog Boris Johnson declared in an interview on the Andrew Marr show that Tier restrictions ‘probably about to get tougher’. FFS Boris just get on with it!!! Stop dithering man, every day’s delay will cost another 1000 lives. We did lockdown last year and all experts concurred that if we had done it earlier many thousands of lives would have been spared.\n\nDon’t despair Brothers and Sisters. We can get through this. Focus on the positive and look for the light at the end of the tunnel. There is a Puerto Rican word – Pa’lente that means Go Forward.\n\n(326) Hurray For The Riff Raff: ‘Pa’lante’ SXSW 2017 – YouTube\n\nWell comrades, it looks like another lockdown is inevitable. A blind man on a galloping horse could have seen the current crisis coming. The need for economic recovery sent politicians across Europe into a frenzy of returning life to ‘normal’ with indecent haste. Travel was positively encouraged, bars and restaurants allowed to return to near normal providing social distancing was encouraged and live music was off the menu. In the U.K schools were given little choice but to re-open. Understandable, but surely the risk of a steep rise in infections was understood. At the same time, workers were pressed to give up working from home and get back to the office. Why? To rescue cafes and restaurants of course! Within two weeks workers were beseeched to go back to working from home again as infections soared. Our ‘world beating’ track and trace system was re-launched yet still seems to be a shining example of a shite app!! Boris ‘son of Trump’ Johnson staggers from one crisis to another looking increasingly clueless. I keep expecting Boris to shout ‘fake news’ at Kier Starmer as he takes yet another humiliating beating at P.M’s question time. Apparently Boris makes no decisions himself but relies on Dominic Cummings to give him the answers. Dominic Cummings is the man who, in order to check if his eyesight had been affected by Covid-19, took his 4 year old son on a forty mile drive!!! Dom apparently relies on ‘focus groups’ to provide Boris with the answers he is incapable of thinking of himself. More like ‘fuck us’ groups methinks! And then of course there is Brexit…………………….\n\nEnough of politics, this blog is intended to be uplifting. A celebration, both of England, and of being English. Pat and I needed the break. Our trip to the States was cancelled in June and we now face our daughter heading off to University. With this in mind I booked a week in a cottage in Halifax, West Yorkshire for a week. The cottage was dog friendly and had four bedrooms and a garden. Caitlin and Callum came with us as did our dog Remus. For once, I had not exhaustively planned our trip. I had done a lot of research, printed a list of things to do, places to visit and of record shops in nearby towns but had not done the usual research into restaurants and pubs as we were ‘dogged up’.\n\nFriday 18th September\n\nToday is the 50th anniversary of Jimi Hendrix’s death. BBC radio 6 were reassuringly aware of this auspicious occasion and played some great Jimi tunes as we drove to Halifax. Check-in time was 3.0 pm and we arrived promptly as is our want. We were not disappointed with our cottage. It was well decorated, spacious and located in a good neighbourhood. The cottage was once owned by Judge James Pickle.\n\nJames Pickles was an English barrister and circuit judge and who later became a tabloid newspaper columnist. He became known for his controversial sentencing decisions and press statements. His obituaries variously described him as forthright, colourful, and outspoken. Wikipedia\n\nOur cottage apparently featured on an episode of ‘Through the keyhole’ when owned by the good judge\n\nAfter unpacking etc I read the local information provided by the owners. They advised a couple of pubs nearby of which we chose the Three Pigeons which was advised to be dog friendly.\n\nThe Ossett brewery website describes the Three Pigeons thus;\n\nA carefully restored Grade II listed 1930s pub. From an aesthetic perspective the Three Pigeons offers pub-goers a rather unique environment in which to enjoy their beer in from Ossett Brewery or other guest breweries.\n\nThis award winning hostelry with its art deco styling and corridor bar is in a class of its own. The five rooms off the main passageway have distinct individuality and hark back to an era of more functional simplicity.\n\nI loved this pub from the get go. Five different rooms to choose from, great beer and friendly regulars. I tried a couple of excellent beers of which White Rat was my favourite. The landlord brought a bowl of water for Remus and a handful of dog treats which was a nice touch. Locals told us of a nearby pub, The Shears Inn, that was also dog friendly. A perfect end to a great day.\n\nSaturday 19th September\n\nI doubt any of you have pondered the reason for the title of this blog. It was inspired by my ambition and burning desire to visit Hebden Bridge.\n\nGoogle search Hebden Bridge and you will find numerous articles that rhapsodise about this small village. It has been named as ‘Best town in Europe’ and was named by British Airway’s High Life magazine as ‘one of the world’s funkiest towns’. It was reading an article about the Trades Club that made me want to visit the Bridge. Regularly voted one of the best small venues in the UK, the Trades club attracts world class artists such as Patti Smith, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry, Mark Lanegan, Laura Marling and Ali Farka Touré. I have tried to get tickets many times but shows sell out very quickly.\n\nHebden Bridge has attracted artists, and has developed a small New Age community. It became attractive in the 1980s and 1990s to lesbians as a place of mutual support to bring up children. As of 2004 Hebden Bridge had the highest number of lesbians per head in the UK.\n\nI wasn’t disappointed. Hebden Bridge is a truly magical place. We visited the small market held in a small square in the middle of town. As in most affluent towns with markets, this one was excellent with high quality stalls and little if any tat. I bought Pat a ring which had been crafted from an old Silver spoon. All the jewellery on the stall had been made from reclaimed Silver spoons. Definitely quirky, but very tasteful.\n\nMy research had revealed that there were two record shops in the town. I visited Heavy Crates first. The shop sold both new and used vinyl and had an excellent selection at reasonable prices. To focus my vinyl foraging on our trip I made acquiring a copy of Tres Hombres by ZZ Top my top priority. This was due to watching an excellent documentary on the band earlier in the week. I had no look finding Tres Hombres but left with Jailbreak by Thin Lizzy and Damn the Torpedoes by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. After a stop at an artisan bakery we headed for the second record shop, Muse Music and love. This place was a café and record shop. As with Heavy Crates, there was a mixture of new and used vinyl. I listened to the owners talking to a couple of customers in the café who were rhapsodising about Hebden Bridge. They asked the owners what it was like to live in the town. They said that they lived in nearby Todmorden which they described as less touristy but very friendly and endowed with a some excellent pubs many of which had live music (in Covid free times of course!). I chatted with owner as I paid for my choices, a really nice guy. I left with Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd and Suzanne Vega’s debut album.\n\nWe met up with Caitlin and Callum and adjourned to the White Swan for a pint of Black Sheep. The pub had a nice beer garden where we could take the dog and enjoy the excellent weather.\n\nPat and I decided to visit Todmorden which is only five miles from Hebden Bridge. Although not as picturesque as Hebden Bridge, it seemed a pleasant enough little town. There were indeed a good number of pubs with the Polished Knob amusing us both.\n\nWe returned to Halifax and visited the Piece Hall. From its own website;\n\nThe Grade I listed Piece Hall, Halifax is a rare and precious thing, an architectural and cultural phenomenon which is absolutely unique. It is the sole survivor of the great eighteenth century northern cloth halls, a class of buildings which embodied the vital and dominant importance of the trade in hand woven textiles to the pre-industrial economy of the West Riding of Yorkshire, from the Middle Ages through to the early nineteenth century.\n\nDating from 1779, when it was built as a Cloth Hall for the trading of ‘pieces’ of cloth (a 30 yard length of woven woollen fabric produced on a handloom), The Piece Hall was the most ambitious and prestigious of its type and now stands in splendid isolation as the only remaining example. It is one of Britain’s most outstanding Georgian buildings.\n\nIt is impossible to overstate the scale and importance of this trade, not just to the history of Halifax and the West Riding, but to the nation as a whole over some 800 years between the twelfth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nWhen it was built, The Piece Hall was a highly visible statement of the great wealth, pride and ambition of the cloth manufacturers. Although built for trade, it also embodied the most cultured sensitivities of the Enlightenment; these bluff northern manufacturers deliberately chose a design for their building which adapted the neo-classical orders of architecture derived originally from the Romans.\n\nPiece Hall re-opened in 2017 transformed into a 21st Century town square, The Piece Hall is a place for everyone to enjoy. The immense, open air square is enclosed by a mix of independent bars, restaurants, shops and cafes. The stories of Georgian Halifax are told in specially created heritage spaces and there is an art gallery hosting visual art exhibitions.\n\nTruly a wonderful place to visit. It shows what can be achieved when imagination and pride are allowed to triumph over rampant capitalism and the need for a quick buck. There are a number of cool, if a little pricey, shops. Pat bought me a framed photo of The Ramones from Al’s Emporium. It has replaced the Kylie calendar in my man cave…………praise indeed!\n\nThe photo below shows what a beautiful day it was\n\nThat evening the four of us and the dog walked to the Shears Inn. The pub was difficult to get to as it is located at the bottom of an extremely steep road. It was worth the nuisance though as it proved to be another friendly hostelry. I started with a pint of Timothy Taylor’s Landlord bitter, one of my favourites. I then tried a pint of D Day Dodger from the Martland Mill brewery. I really enjoyed this excellent beer and drank several more to check that the first pint was no fluke! Callum and Caitlin both had fish and chips in the pub which they both raved about.\n\nA grand day out as they say in Yorkshire\n\nSunday 20th September\n\nWe took the train to Hebden Bridge on Sunday. This was my first trip on public transport since the pandemic began. The journey only takes 15 minutes which made it an easy commute. We had a stroll around the Sunday market before taking a walk along the canal. This was a very pleasant stroll as the sun was out making it a warm day. We walked for half an hour or so until we arrived at The Stubbing Wharf pub. It was very pleasant sat watching the canal boats go by whilst enjoying a pint or two of Black Sheep. As we got back into town we stumbled across the Trades Club. I know I will love seeing a gig at the venue so will re-double my efforts to get tickets for a show once ‘Rona recedes.\n\nWe returned to the beer garden in the White Swan for more of the excellent Black Sheep bitter. Pat and Caitlin bought the dog a tub of doggie ice cream (I kid you not!) from a charity shop. Remus was unimpressed, he much prefers the Vanilla from Cumbrian Cow apparently……………..hmm.\n\nWe took the train back to Halifax and headed for the Shears Inn for a late lunch. I had a giant Yorkshire Pudding which lived up to its name and completely outfaced me. I washed it down with more pints of the excellent D Day Dodger.\n\nOutside the Stubbing Wharf\n\nMonday 21st September\n\nAnother beautiful morning so we drove to Ogden Water Country Park on the outskirts of Halifax. This nature reserve consists of a series of woodland trails that circumnavigate the Reservoir. There were lots of people about and everyone was cheerful and friendly. The views over the reservoir were stunning and you couldn’t help but to feel relaxed. After our walk we headed back into the town centre so Caitlin and Callum could check out the Piece Hall. Pat and I checked out Halifax market Hall which was OK. I then headed for Revo records. This was another good record shop with a decent selection of new and used vinyl. Once more, the search for a copy of Tres Hombres proved fruitless however I did manage to pick up a copy of Official Live Bootleg by the Blues Band, an album I’ve been trying to find for a while.\n\nWe all headed for Lunch at the Crossroads pub on the outskirts of town. Good food, good beer (Thwaites IPA) and Dog friendly.\n\nIn the evening Caitlin and Callum headed to the cinema (the new Bill & Ted film) while Pat, me and the dog headed to the Three Pigeons for a few pints of the excellent White Rat bitter. Pat took the dog for a quick toilet break outside the pub a little later in the evening. When she came back into the pub she said she had been watching fireworks light up the sky and asked the regulars if there was some sort of local celebration that evening. Her question was met with knowing smiles as apparently local drug dealers announce delivery of new supplies by letting off fireworks!! I could only shake my head in admiration at the ingenuity of the local entrepreneurs!!\n\nTuesday 22nd September\n\nPat and I headed for Huddersfield this morning. I read that there was a flea market on a Tuesday and I hoped to find some vintage black and white photographs of Yorkshire towns. Such photos tend to be vastly overpriced in galleries so I hoped a visit to a second hand market would help me find some for a reasonable sum. No look I’m afraid but I did find a stall selling vinyl records! I got rather carried away I’m afraid picking up;\n\nThe Faces – A Nod’s as good as a wink\n\nSonny Terry and Brownie McGhee – Livin’ with the Blues\n\nLeonard Cohen – Greatest Hits\n\nCat Stevens – Greatest Hits\n\nThe Mamas and the Papas – 20 Greatest Hits –\n\nHappy Mondays – Step on 12” single\n\nI paid £25 for the lot which I thought was a bargain.\n\nBefore leaving Huddersfield I felt duty bound to visit Vinyl Tap, the town’s only record shop. Although it was a large, well-stocked shop there was no copy of Tres Hombres in the racks so I left without buying anything.\n\nWe headed to Bronte country and the small town of Haworth. Most people know that God created Heaven and Earth in six days and on the seventh day he did rest. At this point Satan sneaked in and created Haworth!! We parked up and set off to find main st. The signposts advised we needed to walk up the amusingly named Butt Lane. It was like ascending the north face of the Eiger!!! Just as I thought we had reached the summit I realised it was a brief respite as after crossing a road there was a further punishing ascent before reaching Main street. After greedily sucking from the thoughtfully provided Oxygen tanks I almost fainted when I realised that Main street was an even steeper ascent!! Wuthering Heights indeed. I sat on a bench to get my heart rate down below 200 and smiled to myself as I heard a young woman moan at her boyfriend that they had driven 3 hours to find that all the shops were closed!! Right on sister, I wish I hadn’t bothered as well 🙂\n\nThat evening Pat and I dined at Pajoree’s Thai restaurant in Halifax town centre. We were the only customers but the food was outstanding. We chatted with Pajoree the owner. She told us her life story, how she arrived in England with a small suitcase of clothes and worked in a number of low paid jobs until she saved enough to open a restaurant. She now also runs a Thai cookery class. A lovely person and a great cook. We adjourned to the nearby Victorian Craft beer café. This was a fantastic pub which served a fine range of real ales including an Imperial Stout at £15 a pint!!! I stuck to slightly less regal offerings enjoying pints of Titanic Anchor, Squawk Pavo, Elland Porter and Manchester cuts like a Buffalo! Pat drank still Mango Cider, a Wheat beer and a Cherry beer.\n\nWednesday 23rd September\n\nOur niece Jade came to visit today. We all headed out to Withens Clough reservoir, Cragg Vale. This place was a few miles outside Halifax on the moors. It was a damp, dull, day. Exactly the weather you feel appropriate as it helps to emphasise the bleak, forbidding atmosphere of the Yorkshire Moors. The views were beautiful and the walk around the perimeter of the reservoir was really enjoyable.\n\nAfter our walk we took Jade to Hebdens Bridge. She loved the place as I thought she would. We walked around the small town centre and I showed her the Trades Club. Jade is determined to see a gig there as well. We looked in an Estate agent’s window and were taken with a Houseboat on the canal for sale for£99,000. Believe me, if I had that kind of money I would have bought it on the spot!\n\nWe headed back to Halifax via Sowerby Bridge where we dropped Caitlin and Callum off as they were embarking on a train pub crawl betweem Todmorden and Halifax!\n\nWe took Jade to see the Piece Hall and we chatted to a young guy working there. He proudly told us about gigs held there and of how magical the place looks when lit up at night. His enthusiasm was infectious and I would love to comeback one day in ‘Rona free times.\n\nThursday 24th September\n\nThe last day of our holiday. Pat and I had always intended to go to Leeds or York but decided instead to stick with small market towns and so headed for Wetherby. Located North East of Leeds, Wetherby is best known for it’s racecourse. We visited the market which was very small but none the worse for it. We wandered around this small town which had a good number of independent shops and a number of interseting looking pubs. We shopped in a couple of Butchers shop and bought stuff to take home. The shop keepers were frienly and helpful, a coomon theme in Yorkshire. I would like to comeback and spend a night in Wetherby, it really did seem a friendly pace. The main car park in the town was free, how often do you see that?\n\nI asked Pat if it was OK to make a final visit to Todmorden. There was one record shop on my list that I hadn’t visited. Frustratingly, it was no longer a record shop!! The new shop did sell some excellent art but it was not what I was looking for. I strolled around Todmorden flea market hoping to salvage the visit by finding some old prints of Yorkshire towns. Sadly there were no prints on offer but I did chance upon a nice chap selling vinyl records. I could have spent a fortune with him but restrained myself admirably. There was to be no gold at the end of the rainbow, Tres Hombres wasn’t to be found. I did leave with The Tain by Horslips and Son of Morris on which had Pat recoilling in horror when I told her I had bought an album of Morris dancing tunes……………Hey, each to their own comrades. Live and let live.\n\nAs we walked back to the car park we came across surely the best named pub in the world\n\nThe four of us and the dog went out for dinner to the Causeway foot inn near Ogden Water. The meal was superb as were the pints of Landlord it was washed down with. We stopped off at the Three Pigeons for a farewell visit and I drank a pint of Rudgate Ruby Mild, one of the best beers I sampled over the whole week.\n\nHalifax doesn’t sound like a go to place to visit however we really enjoyed it. There are some excellent parks, good pubs and the Piece Hall really is magnificent. We never had to drive more than forty five minutes with most journeys considerably shorter. There are a multitude of small market towns and villages close by and some great local walks. Hebden Bridge was truly the Jewel in the crown and I know we will return, hopefully to stay in the town for a couple of nights and see a gig at the Trades Club. Who knows, maybe we I will buy a canal boat and Pat and I will retire to a Bohemian lifestyle in the Bridge!!!\n\nThank you for your kind indulgence if you made it to the end of this blog. I genuinely hope some of you are inspired to visit this part of Yorkshire as I feel sure you won’t be disappointed.\n\nI managed to get some reading done while away. I started with The only girl – the autobiography of former Rolling Stone writer Robin Green. It wasn’t bad but I was expecting more about the music scene of the early seventies and of life in San Francisco in those heady times. Next up was Low action, the fifth book in the Vinyl Detective series by Andrew Cartmel. I love the Vinyl detective books and the latest volume didn’t disappoint. I finished the week re-reading High Fidelity by Nich Hornby. If you have never read this book, do so, you won’t be disappointed. If you have seen the film but not read the book then hang your head in shame. I know it’s a great film but the book is set in London and is all the better for it!\n\nBack to music for the latest blog. ‘Rona has restricted travelling and any form of social life. Pat and I went for a few beers in the Crown last Saturday for the first time since February, the first time we’ve been anywhere locally since ‘Rona breezed into town. It was great to get back in there and it felt safe and well organised. I had a few beers in Ulverston a couple of weeks ago which was really good but otherwise life outside of work has been spent listening to music and drinking at home. Sounds sad but it’s been great to indulge myself in my lifelong love affair with music (and alcohol!)\n\nI have been watching political developments in the USA with great interest. Biden has a comfortable lead over the Don in polls and seems to me to have picked a great running mate in Kamala Harris. Don will fight dirty though. Biden’s age will be relentlessly riffed upon coupled with his ‘socialist’ agenda. More worryingly, if the rate of Covid infections and related deaths start to plateau and reduce then Don will claim credit. He will argue that doing fuck all was the right strategy all along. The US economy will start to recover and the high levels of unemployment will fall.\n\nThe American people will choose who they want as President. Quite rightly, they will ignore the opinions of non-Americans. For the sake of world peace and stability I hope they choose wisely………………….Go Joe!!!\n\nBack to music. This blog celebrates Cover versions. Dictionary.com defines Cover version as: noun. a recording or performance of a song by a singer, instrumentalist, or group other than the original performer or composer.\n\nI have picked some of my favourite cover versions. I have chosen covers that are more than plain copies, rather I think they all add something fresh to the originals. Please check them out, you won’t regret it, believe me.\n\nMan who sold the world – Nirvana. Original by David Bowie\n\nNirvana covered this David Bowie song on their MTV Unplugged set. History shows that the emotional fragility in Kurt Cobain’s voice was uncomfortably real. Six months after recording this show Kurt Cobain took his own life. Another member of music’s ’27 club’.\n\nLulu (yes, Lulu) did a great version of this song but the acoustic treatment by Nirvana really works.\n\nMack the knife – Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin – original by Kurt Weil\n\nMack the knife is a song composed by Kurt Weill with lyrics by Bertolt Brecht for their 1928 music drama The Threepenny Opera (German: Die Dreigroschenoper). The song has become a popular standard recorded by many artists, including a US and UK number one hit for Bobby Darin in 1959. Robbie Williams covered this great song on his Swing when you’re winning album in 2001. I know someone who thinks Mr Williams’ is the definitive version. Oh how wrong that is. Frank Sinatra absolutely nails it!!! Even though this is a duet with the great Dean Martin it’s all about Frank. You appreciate what a fantastic singer Frank was. The big band swings like a mother and I can’t help but sing along (badly). My Grandma loved Sinatra singing My Way; My Mam loved Frank singing Winchester Cathedral. I share their love of Frank Sinatra but it’s his version of Mack the knife that does it for me.\n\nAre you experienced – Patti Smith – Original by Jimi Hendrix\n\nI’m sure you’ll agree that few people can carry off a Jimi Hendrix cover that comes anywhere near to the original. After all, Hendrix is universally regarded as the best Rock guitarist who ever lived so it is almost impossible to beat the original. Patti Smith succeeds because her cover is about the song NOT the guitar playing. This is a refreshing approach which she pulls off with considerable aplomb. Patti Smith started her artistic life as a poet and her version of Are you experienced celebrates one of Jimi Hendrix’s best lyrics. This track comes from Twelve, an album of covers by Patti Smith. The album was universally panned by critics but this track should convince you to give it a go. Every song does something different to the original and a good few of them succeed.\n\nGin ’n’ juice – The Gourds – Original by Snoop Doggy Dogg\n\nNow we really get going. The Gourds are an American alternative country band that formed in Austin, Texas. The thought of a Country music band covering a Hip Hop classic is totally ridiculous yet by god this works! Hayseed Dixie have made a career out of wacky, offbeat covers but, good as they are, nothing they have recorded comes close to this masterpiece. The Gourds are not even known for cover versions; their own material is great in its own right.\n\nI love Snoop Doggy Dogg, his laid back, laconic drawl hits the spot for me. I can’t condone the decidedly un-PC lyrics but I’m sure Snoop would agree the Gourds nailed it with their version.\n\nKilling me softly – The Fugees – Original by Roberta Flack\n\nTime to go in the opposite direction with a Hip Hop version of a classic song. This was the Fugees breakthrough hit and it showcased the vocal talents of Lauryn Hill. Lauryn Hill seems to be a somewhat troubled hombre. After the Fugees split she recorded the magnificent Miseducation of Lauryn Hill album but since then there has been little output. Renowned for tardiness that shames Axl Rose, La Hill has developed a reputation as a diva to rival Mariah Carey. I prefer to focus on this brilliant version of a beautiful song, completely different to but totally complimentary to Roberta Flack’s original.\n\nTempted – Richard Thompson – Original by Squeeze\n\nChris Difford and Glen Tilbrook of Squeeze are one of England’s finest song writing duos. Lennon and McCartney and Jagger/Richards roll off the tongue, both duos’s rightfully revered worldwide. Difford and Tilbrook are not far behind in all but renown. Tempted is one of their finest songs. A bittersweet tale of an extra-marital affair that recalls the brilliance of Ray Davies at his best. Richard Thompson recorded his version on his 1000 years of popular music album. The album was originally conceived after Richard Thompson, along with many other artists, was asked by Playboy magazine to nominate his choice of the best songs of the last 1000 years. He took them exactly at their word and served up a list that included the oldest-known English-language songs, a medieval Italian dance tune and various other folk songs alongside slightly more contemporary fare. Tempted was a great choice and Thompson’s version is different but perfectly complimentary. He manages to beautifully capture the aching emotion of the song suggesting he has been there himself??\n\nLife is Life – Laibach – Original by Opus\n\nBack to the quirky! From Wikipedia:\n\nLaibach (German pronunciation: [ˈlaɪbax]) is a Slovenian avant-garde music group associated with the industrial, martial and neo-classical genres. Formed in the mining town of Trbovlje (at the time in Yugoslavia) in 1980, Laibach represents the musical wing of the Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK) collective, a group which Laibach helped found in 1984. “Laibach” is the German historical name for the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, itself an oblique reference to the Nazi occupation of Slovenia in World War II.\n\nFrom the early days, the band was subject to controversies and bans due to their elaborate use of iconography with ambiguously repugnant parodies and pastiches of elements from totalitarianism, nationalism and militarism, a concept they have preserved throughout their career.\n\nHopefully you got through that! This track is awesome. After the military style trumpet intro the song starts, conjuring dystopian visions of oppressive marching, jackbooted soldiers. The deep, growled vocals are in complete contrast to the original.\n\nSome of you won’t like this at all, some will find it disturbing, even scary. Keep an open mind, it’s only music after all. After Slovenia became independent in 1991, Laibach’s status in the country has turned from rejection to promotion into a national cultural icon, which included performances with the Slovenian symphony orchestra.\n\nI can pay no finer compliment than vowing that this is much, much better than the original.\n\nWorking in a coal mine – Devo – Original by Lee Dorsey\n\nAnother quirky cover version. Devo hail from Akron, Ohio, a city that spawned a number of excellent bands in the seventies (Chrissie Hynde hails from Akron). The name Devo comes from the concept of “de-evolution” and the band’s related idea that instead of continuing to evolve, mankind has actually begun to regress, as evidenced by the dysfunction and herd mentality of American society.\n\nDevo are probably better known for their offbeat cover of the Stones’ Satisfaction however I prefer their version of this Lee Dorsey classic.\n\nDead Flowers – Townes Van Zandt – Original by the Rolling Stones\n\nSpeaking of Stones’ covers this is the daddy!\n\nI love Townes Van Zandt. A troubled genius who never received the mainstream success he so richly deserved. Townes was revered by critics and fellow musicians alike but this recognition never translated into sales. This cover of a Rolling Stones song first appeared on the soundtrack of the Coen brothers magnificent film ‘The Big Lebowski’. Enough praise has been deservedly lavished on the film but I want to celebrate the brilliance of Townes’ version of this song from the Stones Sticky Fingers album. The Stones original is a country music styled rockabilly song. Townes’ acoustic version showcases the depraved, junkie chic lyrics. It’s easy to think that Townes Van Zandt wrote this song himself, surely the marque of a good cover version.\n\nMarie – Willie Nelson – Original by Townes Van Zandt\n\nTownes wrote many sad songs but none more tragic or relevant than this truly heart-breaking story of a doomed love affair between two homeless people. You only need to watch or read the news to appreciate that the devastation wreaked by Covid-19 extends beyond health. World economies are ill-prepared for the impact of widely predicted pandemics. High levels of unemployment will cause a huge increase in homelessness. If you look at England and America, Right wing survival of the fittest thinking is sadly prevalent. How I hate people turning their noses up at and looking the other way from homeless people. How I hate hearing people say that they are actually just scammers who are actually well off and begging to supplement their already comfortable lifestyle. HORSESHIT!!! If you think this is true then shame on you. How many people did you go to school with whose ambition was to be homeless?\n\nSermon over (for now). Willie Nelson’s version is not as good as Townes’s own but you can tell he shares the sentiment. They actually do a great duet of this song. Please listen to these truly tragic lyrics and appreciate that this is the new normal.\n\nThis flight tonight – Nazareth – Original by Joni Mitchell\n\nThis is a cover version that shouldn’t work. A Glaswegian hard rock band fronted by a gravel voiced singer covering a song from Joni Mitchell’s classic album Blue. Blue is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. Exploring the various facets of relationships from infatuation on “A Case of You” to insecurity on “This Flight Tonight“, the songs feature simple accompaniments on piano, guitar and Appalachian dulcimer. Blue is generally regarded by music critics as one of the greatest albums of all time; the way Mitchell’s songwriting, compositions and voice all work together are frequent areas of praise.\n\nAmazingly Nazareth’s version really works. The chugging riff from Manny Charlton allows Dan McAfferty to give one of his finest vocal performances. Nazareth also do a great cover of Leon Russell’s Alcatraz.\n\nJoan of Arc – Jennifer Warnes – Original by Leonard Cohen\n\nJennifer Warnes was a backing singer, vocal arranger and guest vocalist on Leonard Cohen albums and tours from the early seventies through the nineties and up to his Old Ways album in 2012. In 1987 she recorded an album of Leonard Cohen covers, Famous Blue Raincoat. This version of Joan of Arc comes from that album and is a duet with Cohen himself. Jennifer Warnes is best known for her duet with Joe Cocker on Up where we belong from the soundtrack of Officer and a Gentleman but, for me, this duet is much better. A sad song that somehow manages to uplift the soul.\n\nAll along the watchtower – Jimi Hendrix – Original by Bob Dylan\n\nThis is the most faithful to the original cover version I have chosen. Hendrix and Dylan both possess voices that can be described as acquired tastes. What sets this version apart is unsurprisingly Hendrix’s guitar playing. There is no point in me trying to describe Jimi’s brilliance; it speaks for itself n’est-ce pas?\n\nSlave driver – Songs of our native daughters – Original by Bob Marley and the Wailers\n\nBob Marley is surely one of the most difficult artists to cover. His distinctive voice and the Wailers sympathetic backing are surely one of the world’s most distinctive combinations. Songs of our native daughters are kindred banjo players Rhiannon Giddens, Amythyst Kiah, Leyla McCalla, and Allison Russell. Together they confront sanitized views about America’s history of slavery, racism, and misogyny from a powerful, black female perspective. The Banjo’s they play are of the traditional African American design which sound much less trebly than the type heard on the Deliverance soundtrack\n\nThis cover injects Marley’s original with equal emotion from a different perspective. Very powerful.\n\nPocahontas – Gillian Welch – Original by Neil Young\n\nAnother song that paints American history in an unfavourable light. This could apply equally to many so called developed nations including Great Britain. The story of Pocahontas has been somewhat sanitised by the Disney cartoon of the same name. The truth is inevitably darker as is described on this great song by Neil Young. Gillian Welch does a fantastic version of this classic song. Please preserve with this video clip as Gillian and her partner David Rawlins arse about for two minutes before getting started. Believe me it’s worth the wait. Gillian’s version is better than the original.\n\nAfter the gold rush – Prelude –Original by Neil Young\n\nAnother Neil Young cover, this version by Prelude was the first version I heard of this brilliant song. The song appears to have a strong environmentalist theme on first listen but the song takes listeners from mediaeval times through to a vision of the future in three verses.Many artists have covered this great song including Thom Yorke, Allison Krauss, Patti Smith and Dolly Parton. The USP of the Prelude version is that it is sung acapella. The video clip below shows the band performing After the Gold rush in 2017. They first released their cover in 1973.\n\nThe Singer – Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Original by Johnny Cash\n\nThis track is taken from Nick Cave’s covers album Kicking against the pricks. One measure of a good cover version is when the performer truly makes the song their own. Nick Cave manages this with aplomb on the Singer. This song is perfectly suited to Caves’s deep sonorous voice. It was only fairly recently that I heard Johnny Cash’ original version and great though it is I think Nick Cave nailed it with his.\n\nI started with a cover of a David Bowie song and finish with one by his old friend Lou Reed. Sweet Jane first appeared on the Velvet Underground’s Loaded album. It has since featured on several Velvet Underground live albums and also on Reed’s own Rock’n’Roll Animal album. Mott the Hoople recorded a great cover version on their All the young dudes album (another Bowie connection). The song remained a staple of Lou Reed live sets throughout his career.\n\nMy chosen cover version is by Canadian band Cowboy Junkies (great name n’est-ce pas?). This version hails from The Trinity Session by Cowboy Junkies, released in 1988. The music was recorded inside Toronto’s Church of the Holy Trinity on November 27, 1987, with the band circled around a single microphone. This a truly great album that is well worth checking out. Margo Timmins vocals on this chilled out version are spine tingling. A great way to finish.\n\nI hope my choices inspire you to give them a listen and to compile a list of your own favourite cover versions. As I finish typing I’m conscious that there are no Beatles or Chuck Berry covers and there are many brilliant ones to choose from. I’m already slightly regretting not including Johnny Winters incendiary version of Mick and Keef’s Jumping Jack Flash. I’m sure as I hit the publish button I’ll be horrified by the classics I have forgotten to include. I really enjoyed writing this blog although I’m conscious that I am avoiding writing about my favourite albums of all time. The mere thought of compiling a list fills me with dread and I know that it will only be valid for the time it takes to type it. Since about a month after ‘Rona kicked in I have logged every album I have listened to. I hit the 200 mark last night (Ice cream for Crow by Captain Beefheart). Not all of them can make my top 20 so boiling it down will be torture!\n\nSeptember sees another visit to my beloved Liverpool and a week in West Yorkshire when I plan to visit Hebden Bridge at long last. Hopefully I will amass enough stories and experiences for another travel blog thus putting off writing that ‘my favourite albums’ blog a little longer.\n\nI wrote this blog drinking Jubilee Stout from Kirkby Lonsdale brewery. Great beer at a commendable 5.5%abv.\n\nIn a recent blog I wrote about my favourite song lyrics. In the same piece I railed against people describing the singer as ‘having a good voice’. I find this to be the most fatuous of comments. Much better would be ‘I think he/she is a good singer’. Even ‘I like his/her voice’, though not perfect, would be better. Describing someone as ‘having a good voice’ is actually an attempt at retaining credibility when trying to shield the fact that you like a potentially embarrassing song.\n\nHey, don’t worry about it. I think I have great musical taste but I am still proud to admit that I love Edelweiss and The lonely goat herd from the Sound of music, I love Pass the Dutchie by Musical Youth and Ride on time by Black Box.\n\nI feel that the lyric blog leaves unfinished business so therefore I feel the need to share my favourite singers. I’ve been thinking about this for a few weeks now so it’s time I got off the pot and shared my taste in vocalists. I will try my best not to bow to political correctness and pick equal numbers of male/female or black/white vocalists. I’ll just write about my favourites. The artists below are listed in no particular order;\n\nTom Waits\n\nAs you will no doubt notice as you read this blog, many of my favourite singers possess voices that are politely described as ‘an acquired taste’. Tom Waits growls rather than sings at times. I’ve loved Tom’s voice since I first heard him. What does it for me is the pathos that he manages to endow his lyrics with when he sings. Checkout ‘Eggs and Sausage’ from the Nighthawks at the Diner album. Close your eyes and you’re sat on a barstool close to Tom finishing the night with a coffee and something greasy in the vain hope of heading off a hangover at the pass. Try ‘Tango ‘til they’re sore from Rain Dogs. Tom transports me to the late night bar where I sit watching the action with him and the other barflies. ‘Jersey girls’ is probably better known from the version by Bruce Springsteen. Good as Bruce’s version is, it pales into insignificance next to Tom’s original. The emotion oozes from the grooves when you play Tom Wait’s version of this great song. The video below is of ‘Downtown Train’ from the Rain Dogs album. The pathos and emotion that Tom wrings from the line ‘all my tears they fall like rain’ is truly breath-taking. Judge for yourself.\n\nMick Jagger\n\nMy late Father-n law Jack hated Mick Jagger with a passion. When pressed on why, he said that Mick was the first of the ‘shouters’. In Jack’s opinion, Mick Jagger signalled the end of the era of great singers and ushered in a generation of talentless oafs who could only shout (Jack’s heroes were Matt Munro and Mario Lanza). I beg to differ. Mick has one of the more distinctive voices in music. I love the fact that he can sing in a variety of different accents but still sound like Mick Jagger. He is equally comfortable as a London boy or a New York scenester. I imagine he effortlessly adopts an Australian twang when singing over there. Mick is also a great frontman. When you see the Stones it’s hard to take your eyes away from Mick, he lives every song. To appreciate what I mean you have to consider the fact that he shares a stage with one of the most iconic rock stars of all time in Keith Richards. Mick and the Stones are approaching their 60th anniversary and he still sounds fantastic.\n\nJanis Joplin\n\nJanis Joplin is a member of Rock music’s 27 club. A tragically short life, one marred by the difficult time that she suffered at school in Port Arthur, Texas. Janis said that she was ostracized and bullied in high school. As a teen, she became overweight and suffered from acne, leaving her with deep scars that required dermabrasion. Other kids at high school would routinely taunt her and call her names like “pig,” “freak,” or “creep.” She stated, “I was a misfit. I read, I painted, I thought. I didn’t hate Black people. When asked on the Dick Cavett show in 1970 if she had been popular in school, she admitted that when in high school, her schoolmates “laughed me out of class, out of town and out of the state” (during the year she had spent at the University of Texas at Austin, Joplin had been voted “Ugliest Man on Campus” by frat boys).\n\nJanis left Texas in 1963 and headed for San Francisco. Over the next two years she tried to build a career as a singer but developed a drug habit and friends clubbed together to buy her a bus ticket back to Port Arthur. After a couple of years back home in Texas where sh"
