        "text": "Across six albums in less than a decade, Richard and Linda Thompson may not have entirely rewritten the folk handbook but they left some intriguing scrawls in the margins. There’s even more to study in this long-in-the-making, elegantly packaged set, with the inclusion of 31 tracks never before offered up for public consumption.\n\nIt is, however, a slight compromise, due not only to the players’ own power of veto; the end of Universal’s hitherto long-standing licensing agreement with the BBC means none of the duo’s radio or TV sessions can be included. Granted, they feature on the Richard-led 2011 box set Live At The BBC, but their absence here makes for a nigglingly incomplete picture.\n\nYet it’s hard to gripe about what has made the cut; each of the original half-dozen albums (more on which later) are laden with extras, and two additional discs of material plug as many gaps as circumstances allow. Disc One takes care of business before the arrival of their debut long-player on Island, worth the admission price just for Linda in sassy popster mode on Little Eva’s The Locomotion and her exquisite duet with Sandy Denny on The Everly Brothers’ When Will I Be Loved.\n\nThe richest “new” treasures, though, are on Disc Five, comprising live recordings from London shows in 1975 and ’77. The former’s highlights include a tender reading of the country/soul classic Dark End Of The Street and a powerful version of the Richard-penned The Sun Doesn’t Shine On The Poor. The later cuts feature what came to be known as the “muslim band”, referencing the pair’s decision to live in a sufi community, and are perhaps a little too hesitant, too guarded. Despite that, Linda rarely sounded better, the clipped English vowels of her voice burrowing into the human frailty of the material.\n\nAs for the albums proper, the 1974 Island debut I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight remains the high watermark. The chirpy optimism of the title track is counter-balanced by the sombreness of Withered And Died or The End Of The Rainbow, the latter of which rears its heartbreaking head again as a bonus track, with Linda taking the lead vocal.\n\nThe same year’s Hokey Pokey isn’t quite as strong, but soars to great heights on the naked confessional A Heart Needs A Home and the semi-frivolous I’ll Regret It All In The Morning.\n\nA higher concentration of meatier material can be found on Pour Down Like Silver (1975), especially For Shame Of Doing Wrong and Dimming Of The Day, both prime examples of the yearningly honest torch folk that was fast becoming the Thompsons’ default setting.\n\nThe brace of albums after the pair left Island have been out of print since the 90s, which may have contributed to the relatively unfair suggestion that they were inferior to what went before. However, 1978’s First Light holds up admirably, thanks in particular to Don’t Let A Thief Steal Into Your Heart (in time, given a soulful makeover by The Pointer Sisters) and the gospel-tinged grandeur of House Of Cards.\n\nSunnyvista (1979) doesn’t fare so well, though the mash-up of folk and power pop on You’re Going To Need Somebody is almost impossible to dislike. Extras here include examples of the Thompsons’ collaboration with producer Gerry Rafferty, a hook-up which, at the time, came to nought due to friction between Richard’s often traditional folk attitudes and Rafferty’s slick FM radio mindset, which would serve him well on his own records.\n\nFrustratingly, only five of the tracks recorded with Rafferty are included here, but they’re enough to make the listener wonder just how different the final album, 1982’s Shoot Out The Lights, might have been, had the troubled waters been calmed. The Thompsons’ old friend Joe Boyd was ultimately at the helm for a collection that proved to be the duo’s swansong, and it could be argued that the cold detachment of his production is in keeping with the chilliness of the songs (see Walking\n\nOn A Wire and the title track).\n\nNevertheless, it proves to be a prescient curtain-closer on a partnership rich in both unbridled joy and fractious uncertainty. Folk had rarely been so introspective, so emotionally candid as when Richard and Linda opened both their hearts and their dirty laundry baskets.\n\nQ+A:\n\nLinda Thompson on painful listening, her folk family at Island and future plans\n\nHow did you and Richard decide which unheard recordings to include?\n\nWe listened to a lot of things, said yes to some and no to others, but I can’t remember us disagreeing hugely about anything. I think some of the live stuff is a bit crazy, but most of the time we had our arms gently twisted by the record company!\n\nDid you enjoy poring over your back pages?\n\nI always find it so painful. I don’t think many actors like seeing themselves on screen, and it’s the same for singers – except for lousy actors and singers who think they’re fabulous. But I managed to struggle through it, and I think the end product hangs together quite well.\n\nWas your time with Island Records like being part of a folk family?\n\nIt was a very nurturing environment at Island, they let you do album after album and didn’t care too much about sales. They cared about the music and the people, be it us or John [Martyn] or Nick [Drake] or Sandy [Denny],\n\nand they understood that folk singers tend not to sell huge amounts of records. There’s a temptation to think of us all as outsiders, but I never felt that, and neither did I wish we were in the charts. We had our audience, and it was a very loyal audience –\n\nstill is. Nick is as much a figure of worship today.\n\nIt must have been a wrench to leave Island.I remember being quite sad about it, but we’d had a good run with them; that doesn’t happen these days, people seem to get dropped after 15 minutes. Changes were being made, and [label boss] Chris Blackwell said to me, “I love you, but I’ve got to let you go.” We got a good deal when we signed to Chrysalis, and they also let us get on with it without much interference, but left to my own devices I would have stayed at Island forever more.\n\nSo there was no change to your working methods at Chrysalis?\n\nNo, we just carried on as before. I think they would have liked us to be more commercial, but we didn’t really know how to do that.\n\nWas enlisting Gerry Rafferty as producer\n\nan attempt by them to make you more commercial? Pop sensibilities in a folk idiom?\n\nThey weren’t the ones who suggested we work with Gerry – that was Gerry’s idea! He approached Chrysalis and asked to produce us, but it didn’t go well. Richard thought it was a bit of a disaster, but I was always very fond of him.\n\nRichard and Gerry were both very strong individuals, and they just clashed. Gerry was always very American-leaning with regards to what he wanted, while Richard, even to this day having lived in America for so long, has very English sensibilities.\n\nSome of the material started with Gerry\n\nfinally surfaced on Shoot Out The Lights, which is often described as your “divorce” album, but does the timeline really support that?\n\nWell, first let me just say I think a lot of the Gerry versions are better than those on the record that eventually came out, but I don’t consider it to be a break-up album; we were still together after it was released. The songs were leading up to us splitting, but they weren’t necessarily about us. Richard has always written in character, though it’s fair to say he’s better at expressing his personal feelings in song than he is in everyday conversation.\n\nYou seem to have a good relationship these days.\n\nOh, we’re very good friends now! We see a lot of each other.\n\nRichard seems to release material every\n\n18 months or so, but what’s happening with your own career?\n\nEvery 18 months? It’s more like every 18 minutes! He’s as prolific as he ever was, and I can’t compete with that. Who can?\n\nI’ve got a lot of my own new record done, but I’m not singing. I’ve written the songs, but because I have this condition, dysphonia, it’s a struggle to talk for too long in a period of time, let alone sing. I just can’t do it; I can’t breathe properly. But I’ve got a lot of good people on board to do it for me: Rufus and Martha [Wainwright], John Grant, The Proclaimers.\n\nIt’s shaping up quite nicely."
