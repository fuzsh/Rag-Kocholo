        "text": "I like the songs Orion, 2:10 Train and Wild Bout My Lovin. The debut is good even in style quality which is good. The recordings show more of the limitations. On the Fred Neil song, I wonder if the recording technique affected the quality of the sound because in some copies it really seems very slightly slowed down. It could be all Linda but seeing some live Stone Poney stuff I think it in the limitations of the recording source. What does everybody think? eddiejinnj\n\nFOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS\n\nReleased: October 1986\n\nLabel: Asylum\n\nRecorded: 1985-86\n\nProduced by: Peter Asher\n\nCurrently available: No\n\nSide 1:\n\n1.When You Wish Upon a Star (Leigh Harline/Ned Washington) (3:46)\n\n2.Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered (Lorenz Hart/Richard Rodgers) (4:24)\n\n3.You Go to My Head (J.

'Round Midnight is a nice close for the series as well. Again, beautifully performed, some truly great vocals here - you can tell she really enjoyed singing these songs and her vocalizations seem more relaxed & natural to me than they did on What's New.\n\nThis is a really nice sounding LP too - my vinyl copy from the 'Round Midnight box set sounds particularly good to me.\n\nOverall, a nice way to end the Nelson Riddle series - and it was time to move on to different music.\n\nYes, by the third round of standards, you might expect things to be running on fumes but the song choices are stellar, probably the best of the three and Ronstadt's interpretations show how completely in tune she was with the material. These are some of the best versions of these songs I've ever heard, particularly When You Wish Upon A Star and Bewitched, Bothered & Bewildered. I still missed her Country/Pop material but there's no denying the power and beauty of these classics and once again, Mr. Riddle gets the MVP award.\n\nIf Nelson hadn't passed away, Nelson and Linda were talking about a double album. I have to look up again what material they looked to cover . I think it was material like in Frenesi but I am guessing it would have been in English. \"FSR\"\n\nI agree with you re: your assessment of your two examples. Add in \"My Funny Valentine\" eddiejinnj\n\nThis is a really good album - the harmonies are wonderful, of course, and it is pretty obvious these women love to sing together. The performances they did on TV to promote this showed they really are good friends too which is sweet.\n\nThe songs are a little too country flavored for my tastes so I don't love this LP like so many others do. As I've gotten older I've been trying to be more open to this genre, and do appreciate it now more than I used to. I'm trying to put my biases against country music aside and re-listen to these recordings. I really did enjoy the compilation they released a few years back.\n\nI love the blend of Linda and Emmylou's voices - very different, unique sounding vocals. I love Western Wall, the disc they did together. I really have never liked Dolly's voice that much - it's not bad or anything, just doesn't resonate with me. I love Dolly the person and the songwriter, but vocally it just doesn't sound great to me.\n\nOverall, a really strong album, but much like the Nelson Riddle sessions, not one I listen to a lot. Huge credit though to Linda for taking yet another genre on.\n\nI regret not seeing this tour but at the time I was just out of college and working my new career. The tickets for the show were more than normal at the time because of the venue etc. and it was like a Broadway show. So I said to myself I can skip this one as it is all in Spanish and I don't know Spanish.\n\nSince then seeing her incredible vocals and the excellent dancers and players in this show, I see she was soooooo passionate about the songs and it really displayed her INCREDIBLE range. I, of course, bought the record. eddiejinnj\n\nCRY LIKE A RAINSTORM, HOWL LIKE THE WIND\n\nReleased: October 1989\n\nLabel: Elektra/WEA\n\nRecorded: March-August 1989\n\nProduced by: Peter Asher\n\nCurrently available: No\n\n1.Still Within The Sound Of My Voice (Jimmy Webb) (4:32)\n\n2.Cry Like A Rainstorm (Eric Kaz) (3:36)\n\n3.All My Life (Karla Bonoff) (3:36)\n\n4.I Need You (Paul Carrack/Nick Lowe/Martin Belmont) (2:52)\n\n5.Don't Know Much (Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil/Tom Snow) (3:35)\n\n6.Adios (Jimmy Webb) (3:36)\n\n7.Trouble Again (Karla Bonoff/Kenny Edwards) (3:19)\n\n8.I Keep It Hid (Jimmy Webb) (3:58)\n\n9.So Right, So Wrong (Paul Carrack/Nick Lowe/Martin Belmont/J.E.

From song selection to production to Linda's vocals, I love everything about it. Sheer perfection. When I look at my iTunes playcounts, I see that the song \"Adios\" is my most-played song by Linda Ronstadt.\n\nWhen it came out, I was working at a place that had a big ballroom-type space with a fairly decent sound system. I would go in there late at night after everyone else had left and blast this album as loud as I could stand it. Just me, in the dark, in a huge empty space.\n\nThis era was also the only time I've seen Linda Ronstadt in concert. She came to Austin for Aquafest (a huge outdoor festival that used to take place each August) and performed with Aaron Neville. There were something like 100,000 people in attendance that night, which was the biggest crowd ever for an Aquafest concert. She was phenomenal.\n\nHard to believe this album came out 30 years ago!\n\nThe old Linda was back! She was already moving in a Pop direction first with Somewhere Out There a few years back, then the equally popular Don't Know Much so I wasn't surprised by this return to form. What was notable this time was the amount of space given to Jimmy Webb tunes and not even the more familiar ones at that. It was also great seeing her delve back into Karla Bonoff's catalogue with three of her better efforts. In a perfect world, Trouble Again would have been a big hit. And I have to admit when I first saw the the title Shattered, I really wanted it to be the Stones tune.\n\nA great album, one of her best sounding records. Well recorded and reproduced. I got to see her perform this at the Shoreline Amphitheater outside San Francisco with the Neville Brothers as the opening act. Aaron of course came out and sang with her for the duets, and the entire Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir came out in full robes to sing backup on a couple of songs - Cry Like A Rainstorm was one. That was very cool, and you could tell Linda was really digging it. Awesome show.\n\nI agree that Trouble Again should have been a hit - so catchy, and the way she holds that note \"...I was bliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind...\" Power. Damn what a voice!\n\nAn album that is screaming for an audiophile edition - the original LP sounds really good, but would love to see AF or MFSL take a crack at this one."
