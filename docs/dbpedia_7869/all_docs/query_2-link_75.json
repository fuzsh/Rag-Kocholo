        "text": "The album’s cover is black, hence the title it is best known by. If you look closely, it depicts the band’s logo angled against the upper left corner and a coiled snake derived from the ‘Gadsden’ flag in the bottom right corner. These images were emphasised in grey in later releases, because they were obviously found to be unintelligible by many. The reference to the ‘Gadsen’ flag is key to the ethos of some of the band members, the lyrical content and the feel of the music, certainly the angrier pieces!\n\n“The Gadsden flag is a historical American flag with a yellow field depicting a timber rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike. Beneath the rattlesnake are the words: ‘Dont Tread on Me’. Some modern versions of the flag include an apostrophe.\n\nThe flag is named after politician Christopher Gadsden (1724–1805), who designed it in 1775 during the American Revolution. It was used by the Continental Marines as an early motto flag, along with the Moultrie flag. It is often used in the United States as a symbol for gun rights and limited government. There are Americans today that still display the Gadsden flag in support of freedom, independence, and for the United States military.” [3.]\n\nA verse from the 1970 song “Uncle John’s Band” by the Grateful Dead contains the words ‘Don’t tread on me’. The Dead’s manager at the time was named John, and his nickname was ‘Uncle John’, so Uncle John’s Band probably means the Dead themselves. The cannonballs are a war reference and ‘Don’t Tread On Me’ refers back to the Gadsen Flag and the USA. The children he comes to take home are likely to be soldiers returning from Vietnam:\n\n“Goddamn, well I declare, have you seen the like?\n\nTheir wall are built of cannonballs, their motto is “Don’t tread on me”.\n\nCome hear Uncle John’s Band playing to the tide,\n\nCome with me, or go alone, he’s come to take his children home.”\n\nThe rattlesnake also represents a separate identity from ‘The Old World’, as depicted in Benjamin Franklin ‘Join Or Die’ illustration:\n\n“On May 9, 1754, Benjamin Franklin printed the first political cartoon in American history, a woodcut of a severed snake entitled “Join, or Die,” in his newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette. Franklin’s cartoon depicted the British North American colonies as a snake cut into eight segments, with each segment designated with an initial of a separate colony or a region asin the case of New England. An editorial discussing the “disunited state” of the colonies accompanied the cartoon, clearly suggesting that in light of the clear and present danger posed by the French and Native Americans to their security, the colonies faced a critical decision—to unite as a collective unit to repulse the enemy or remain disunited and suffer an inevitable death.” [6.]\n\n“Urging the colonists to overcome their parochial interests and form a strong union, Franklin’s popular woodcut—“Join, or Die”—achieved its greatest influence on those of the Revolutionary generation. Not until the American Revolution, however, did unity, in the vision of Franklin, outweigh long-standing suspicions of one another.” [6.]\n\nWithin four years of its release, ‘Metallica’ aka ‘The Black Album’ became the biggest selling Heavy Metal album of all time but the words in the song titles say a lot – Sad, unforgiven, don’t tread on me, never, nothing, failed, misery, struggle…It appears that this is not a happy album! There is an old adage ‘Happy songs sell records, sad songs sell beer’, but this has been a hugely successful record, selling over sixteen million copies in the USA alone, and over thirty million worldwide.\n\nMetallica went through some personnel changes in their early days, before settling on a line-up that would deliver their first three albums. Dave Mustaine, leader and frontman of rival thrash metal band Megadeth, was in the original pre-fame Metallica band, according to the man himself performing a prominent role as the lead guitarist and one of the primary songwriters. Mustaine wrote four of the seven songs on the first Metallica demo ‘No Life Till Leather’ – ‘Mechanix’, ‘Phantom Lord’, ‘Jump In The Fire’ and ‘Metal Militia’. When Metallica release their first album ‘Kill ‘Em All’, those four songs were all included, ‘Mechanix’ reworked and renamed as ‘The Four Horsemen’. Mustaine travelled with Metallica from San Francisco to New York and played two shows with them in ‘The Big Apple’ in 1983 when he was famously thrown out of the band, an incident which would leave him embittered for many years to come.\n\nThe ‘classic’ Metallica line-up on the seminal speed/thrash-metal trilogy ‘Kill ‘Em All’ (1983), ‘Ride The Lightning’ (1984) and ‘Master Of Puppets’ (1986) was:\n\nJames Hetfield – vocals, rhythm guitar\n\nKirk Hammett – lead guitar\n\nCliff Burton – bass, backing vocals\n\nLars Ulrich – drums\n\nIn terms of defining a genre, songwriting, playing and technical proficiency, these recordings are exemplary and are still up there as models of metal integrity.\n\nUnfortunately, on 27th September 1986, Metallica’s world was shaken to the core in Sweden, during their ‘Damage Inc.’ tour to support the ‘Master Of Puppets’ album…\n\nIt was a cold dark morning and the band, their tour manager and three of their crew were sleeping in the tour bus, a British right-hand drive model, as it travelled on the E4 road, twelve miles north of Lunjby. Metallica had played in the Solnahallen, Stockholm, the Swedish capital, on 26th September and were on their way to Copenhagen, Denmark, for their next show, where they were due to play at the Saga venue on the night of 27th September. The bus skidded off the road on to the hard gravel at the side of the motorway. The driver tried to bring the bus back on to the road but to no avail, the vehicle lurching backwards, thumping into the kerb on the opposite side of the road then overturning and crashing to the ground on its side. Of the nine passengers, five sustained minor injuries and one lay dead underneath the bus, the unfortunate Cliff Burton. The driver was lucky to escape with minor cuts and bruises. An investigation followed and there has been much speculation in the subsequent years regarding what was to blame for the accident, from ice on the road, to drink-driving and the driver falling asleep, none of these proven. Allegedly Cliff Burton and Kirk Hammett played cards the night before to decide who was to have first choice of bunks, Burton winning with an ace of spades and selecting the location which would result in his death…\n\nCliff Burton’s memorial stone bears the inscription\n\n‘In Loving Memory Of\n\nClifford Lee Burton\n\nCannot the kingdom of salvation take me home\n\nFebruary 10 1962\n\nSeptember 27 1986’\n\nThe future was dark, the future was, well…black! The ‘Black Album’ was the second to feature Jason Newstead on bass. It may be a requiem for Cliff Burton, a memorial for the deceased bassist in the same way that AC/DC recorded ‘Back In Black’ to pay tribute to their former singer Bon Scott. The preceding record ‘…And Justice For All’ was certainly a progression from ‘Master Of Puppets’, although definitely not a sea change in approach, and could have left the band, as Mick Wall put it, to rot in a heavy metal ghetto! It does however includes the epic, grammy-award winning track ‘One’ and is a solid album, a hit, exhibiting extreme technical proficiency and great quality production by the band and Flemming Rasmussen. The songwriting is built around the now-familiar trademarks of Metallica, and the wider thrash-metal genre – darkness, trouble and despair! The song titles give out that vibe: ‘Blackened’, ‘The Shortest Straw’, ‘Harvester Of Sorrow’, ‘The Frayed Ends Of Sanity’…\n\nKirk Hammett, in an interview with Mick Wall in 2005, explained Metallica’s plan for world domination and what became ‘The Black Album’:\n\n“We said, okay, we’re gonna make an album, we’re gonna put a lot of shorter songs on it, we’re gonna get these f***ing songs on the radio and we’re just gonna indoctrinate the entire universe with Metallica. That was our goal and that’s what we did! And it took everyone as a big surprise…”\n\n[2.]\n\nThe band engaged Canadian producer Bob Rock after some consideration of other ‘big name’ options (like Robert John ‘Mutt’ Lange who had masterminded the mega-selling ‘Hysteria’ album for Def Leppard). Apparently Lars Ulrich was particularly taken with the ‘volcanic’ drum sound that Rock had achieved on The Cult’s ‘Sonic Temple’ and Motley Crue’s ‘Doctor Feelgood’. None of those bands are remotely connected to the brooding Metallica of ‘…And Justice For All’, the predecessor to ‘The Black Album’. The idea of a ‘hit’ record is also a very long way from the band’s trio of genre-defining ‘classic’ thrash/speed metal albums, debut ‘Kill ‘Em All’, ‘Ride The Lightning’ and fan-favourite ‘Master Of Puppets’. Ironically, Bob Rock, who had worked with Bruce Fairbairn on Bon Jovi’s huge ‘Slippery When Wet’ album, was to work with Hetfield, a man who had once written ‘Kill Bon Jovi’ on his guitar! Changed days, but ‘The Black Album’ would retain a strong sense of metal and outsider credibility, whilst taking Metallica, as Ulrich said, ‘to the next level’…\n\nUlrich recalls in ‘Enter Night’ that Rock had seen the band live in Vancouver and wanted to produce them but that they had said “We’re Metallica, no one tells us what to do! But slowly, over the next few days, we thought maybe we should let our guard down and at least talk to the guy. Like, if the guy’s name really is Rock, how bad can it be?” [2.]\n\nRecording began in the first week of October 1990 and was to take around fourteen months to complete. At the start of 1991, Lars Ulrich told Mick Wall “Looking back on our last four albums, they were great records. I’m not going to say anything bad about them. But we never thought that we’d done one where you think, there it is. That one album is it. You’re never gonna be able to make a record like that but as close as you can get to that one album, this is f***ing it…” [2.]\n\nOn black vinyl, the record is a double album, three tracks occupying each of the four sides. Side One is a larger-than-life tour de force, the unsettling, catchy guitar figure of ‘Enter Sandman’ lulling the listener into a dark dream-like reverie soaked in wah-wah guitar before the now-familiar pounding drums of Lars Ulrich lead into the wake-up call of the main crunchy riffing…The whole track is faultless and features economical but very effective lead parts from Kirk Hammett, who described his approach to the playing on this album in ‘Enter Night:\n\n“On this album, I thought out my solos a lot more than I have in the past. I’d listen to the song and instead of sitting down with the guitar I’d sing out ideas into my tape recorder. I thought a lot about what direction I wanted to take with the solos.” Kirk Hammett [4.]\n\nSecond track ‘Sad But True’ takes the pace down but is brutal in its heavy de-tuned riffing. The song “invokes a feeling of dark resignation with its epic guitar textures and slight eastern influences.” [4.]\n\n“I think that song (‘Sad But True’) is gonna be in our set for a long, long time. The mood it creates is different from any other song on the record. ‘Sad But True’ has the heaviest silence of any song we’ve ever recorded”. Jason Newstead [4.]\n\nWhoever ‘Holier Than Thou’ is directed at, it is not someone (or a group) that Hetfield and Ulrich have any time for! The pure hatred is not disguised.\n\n‘Side Two’ begins with the sublime, wistful intro to ‘The Unforgiven’, perhaps reminiscent of spaghetti western soundtracks, evocative of some wilderness landscape in a northern territory. Over a powerful musical backdrop, it tells the tale of a young boy who is bruised and battered by the storms of life, ending up embittered. ‘Wherever I May Roam’ espouses a life on the road and has the common thread of the outcast, ‘me against the world’, that runs through the album. The lyrics are spartan, poetic and forceful, delivered with venom by Hetfield over a full-on rock out.‘Don’t Tread On Me’ starts with a metal guitar version of ‘America’ by Leonard Bernstein from ‘West Side Story’ – Metallica into showtunes? Well, maybe not, but the tune does swing and swagger…Possibly a nod to patriotism and flying the Gadsen Flag, the narrator that rattlesnake, coiled and ready to strike.\n\nOn Side Three, beautiful ballad ‘Nothing Else Matters’ is bookended by the frantic ‘Through The Never’ and primal ‘Of Wolf And Man’. Twenty years after recording ‘Nothing Else Matters’, now one of Metallica’s best known songs, James Hetfield admitted that he didn’t want to play his idea to the rest of the band: “It was so heartfelt, so personal to me. I thought that Metallica could only be these songs about destroying things, headbanging, bleeding for the crowd…I certainly did not think it was a Metallica song. When the guys heard it they were amazed at how much they, I guess, related to it.” [2.]\n\nHetfield delivers in all the guitar parts, taking such personal responsibility for the song that he plays all the solos and the recording apparently doesn’t feature Kirk Hammett at all.\n\n‘Of Wolf And Man’ is a poetic description of wolves in their natural habitat, strong in their sense of purpose and place in the world, contrasting with man’s ‘evolution’ into a modern being, far from early life in the wilderness, seeking the wolf within to get ‘back to the meaning of life’. It also reflects Hetfield’s personal outdoorsman life – ‘I hunt therefore I am’.\n\nSide Four welcomes in the real darkness, as Douglas Adams might have described it, the long dark tea-time of the soul…These three songs seem on the face of it to offer very little hope of salvation, but maybe some deeper delving will bring some light…’The God That Failed’may be about James Hetfield’s mother who died from cancer. She was a Christian Scientist who believed that God would heal her: “…the lyric about ‘Trust you gave; a child to save; left you cold and him in grave’ COULD mean James, that because of his mother’s trust in god to heal her and she left him alone when she died and a part of the child that believed in god died in him too…’I hear faith in your cries’ explains whilst she cried in pain, she had faith that didn’t save her…” [8.]\n\n‘My Friend Of Misery’ seems to be a castigation of those who are troubled, perhaps experiencing depression:\n\n“Misery\n\nYou insist that the weight of the world\n\nShould be on your shoulders\n\nMisery\n\nThere’s much more to life than what you see\n\nMy friend of misery”\n\nI would say that Metallica asking people to lighten up would be a tad hypocritical given the content of their music! So, if you read it that way, this song is somewhat uncomfortable listening, not that it’s a bad tune, just that the lyrics are would seem accusatory. It may have been written about a particular person, but that wouldn’t make it any better. However, turning that on its head, the song may be autobiographical or indeed reflective of some kind of schizophrenia, which would place it in a different context. Allegedly it was conceived as an instrumental, a development of which would certainly be worth hearing.‘The Struggle Within’is like a reprise of ‘Misery’ and closes the album with a real downer!\n\n“Home is not a home, it becomes a hell\n\nTurning it into your prison cell\n\nAdvantages are taken, not handed out\n\nWhile you struggle inside your hell”\n\nIt’s more description of real torment, which is very comment in Metallica’s themes and may capture the real conflict within the band members and in the recording process of ‘The Black Album’…\n\nThe essence of Metallica is in the first three albums, with a strong progression to ‘…And Justice For All’ and ‘Metallica’, so the core essential listening. The next studio album ‘Load’ featured shorter hair, shorter songs and gangster cool. Thereafter, the outlaw path began to weave through some more uncertain territory and the future would involve the canonisation of anger accompanied by a documentary, another change in bass guitarist and an unlikely collaboration with Lou Reed.\n\n“I want to paint it black…no colours any more I want them to turn black….black as night, black as coal…I want to see the sun blotted out from the sky” [9.] If you’re feeling like that, put this album on the stereo and feel the sheer power of the music. It may not lift your mood, but it will suit it, and might strengthen your resolve and lust for life!\n\n‘The Black Album’ tracklisting:\n\nEnter Sandman (Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett)\n\nSad But True (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\nHolier Than Thou (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\nThe Unforgiven (Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett)\n\nWherever I May Roam (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\nDon’t Tread On Me (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\nThrough The Never (Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett)\n\nNothing Else Matters (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\nOf Wolf And Man (Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett)\n\nThe God That Failed (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\nMy Friend Of Misery (Hetfield/Ulrich/Hammett)\n\nThe Struggle Within (Hetfield/Ulrich)\n\n‘The Black Album’\n\nOriginally released: 12th August 1991\n\nLabel: Vertigo\n\nRecorded at: One on One Recording, Los Angeles, USA October 1990 – January 1991\n\nProduced by: Bob Rock with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich\n\nRecorded by: Randy Staub, assisted by Mike Tacci\n\nPersonnel\n\nJames Hetfield – guitars, vocals\n\nLars Ulrich – drums\n\nKirk Hammett – lead guitar\n\nJason Newstead – bass\n\nReferences, quotes and photographs:\n\n1.

It is music taken to its most hyper extreme…’ [3.] Long hair, tight jeans, t-shirts and high-top ‘sneakers’ (in the USA – ‘trainers’ in the UK) were the fashion choices of the thrash/speed metal bands, at least in the early days of the genre…often accompanied by a snarl.\n\nMegadeth are one of the so-called ‘Big Four’ thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Slayer and Anthrax. Their leader, Dave Mustaine, was in the original pre-fame Metallica line-ups, according to the man himself performing a prominent role in the band as the lead guitarist and one of the primary songwriters. Mustaine wrote four of the seven songs on the first Metallica demo ‘No Life Till Leather’ – ‘Mechanix’, ‘Phantom Lord’, ‘Jump In The Fire’ and ‘Metal Militia’. When Metallica release their first album ‘Kill ‘Em All’, thosen four songs were all included, ‘Mechanix’ reworked and renamed as ‘The Four Horsemen’.\n\nThe band’s lifestyle at the time was, as Mustaine describes in his autobiography, ‘completely out of control’:\n\n“I will never deny that I was a handful in those days. I was aggressive, driven, and unpredictable, and I drank way too much. But so did everyone else in the band. We practically lived in our cars, driving up and down the coast, drinking before and after rehearsals and gigs. It wasn’t unusual for one or more members of the band to pass out during those trips and wake up to discover that his face or body had been painted. We shared homes, money, equipment, drugs, alcohol, girls. It was a life of utter decadence (and at times one hell of a lot of fun). For all of us.” [2.]\n\nRehab, rehab and more rehab…Mustaine sums up his life on the cover of his autobiography.\n\nMustaine travelled with Metallica from San Francisco to New York and played two shows with them in ‘The Big Apple’ in 1983 when he was famously thrown out of the band, an incident which would leave him embittered for many years to come. Allegedly James Hetfield drove Mustaine to the bus station with the bus ticket to California that the band had purchased for him, but no subsistence money whatsoever, meaning poor Dave had to beg food and drink from his fellow passengers for the duration of the trip.\n\nThe cliche ‘every cloud has a silver lining’ could apply to what happened next, Mustaine finding the key to his future in some junkmail at the back of the bus…Serendipity?\n\n“At one point I was sitting at the back of the bus, my stomach rumbling, my head throbbing. On the floor I spotted a pamphlet. I picked it up and began reading, just to pass the time, really. It turned out to be a handbill authored by California senator Alan Cranston. The discussion focused primarily on the dangers of nuclear proliferation. For some reason, one line in particular stood out:\n\n‘The arsenal of megadeath can’t be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to.’\n\nI let that swim around in my aching head for a few minutes – ‘the arsenal of megadeath…the arsenal of megadeath’ – and then, for some reason I can’t quite explain, I began to write. Using a borrowed pencil and a cupcake wrapper, I wrote the first lyrics of my post-Metallica life. The song was called ‘Megadeth’ (I dropped the second ‘a’), and though it would never find its way onto an album, it did serve as the basis for the song ‘Set The World Afire.’\n\nIt hadn’t occurred to me then that Megadeth – as used by Senator Cranston, ‘megadeath’ referred to the loss of one million lives as a result of nuclear holocaust – might be a perfectly awesome name for a thrash metal band.” [2.]\n\nApparently, ‘Rust In Peace’ was named when Mustaine was ‘speeding’ on his way home from a skydiving trip:\n\n“The concept of ‘Rust In Peace’…sprang from a bumper sticker I saw one day while driving on the freeway. I forget the precise wording but it was something like ‘May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace’, and immediately I had this image in my head of a pile of warheads sitting in a field somewhere, covered with graffiti.” [2.]\n\nWarning,,,radiation! The warheads will all rust in peace…\n\nMustaine has described himself as a ‘politically active artist’ and as someone who is not easy to pin down or classify.\n\nBy 1990, Megadeth had released three studio albums – debut ‘Killing Is My Business…and Business Is Good’ (1985), the superb ‘Peace Sells…but Who’s Buying?’ (1986) and ‘So Far, So Good…So What?’ (1988). The ‘Rust In Peace’ record was the first not to feature three dots (…) in the title and was band’s biggest success at the time, selling in excess of a million copies as well as being nominated for a Grammy award.\n\nIn ‘A Life In Metal’, Dave Mustaine tells the tale of the studio, the bizarre nature of its ownership, the sacking of the first producer because of his anti-social habits and the eventual ridding of producer Mike Clink due to the antics of his dog!:\n\n“Funny thing was, it didn’t start out that well. We recorded at a place called Rumbo Recorders, which was owned by the Captain and Tennille, of all. Imagine that! Megadeth tracking in the same place where ‘Muskrat Love’ was recorded. I was sceptical about Rumbo offering the right atmosphere, a feeling that was exacerbated one day when I walked in and saw our producer, Dave Jurdin, eating a chilli dog and smoking a cigarette at the controls. The place just reeked. Jurdin was gone within days, replaced by Mike Clink, whose credentials were strong, if not impeccable. Clink and I got off on the wrong foot as well when, early in the process, he said, ‘Listen bro, if Axl calls, I may have to take off for a little while.’ ‘What?’ ‘Yeah, I’m doing the Guns’N’ Roses album, too, so if Axl needs me, you understand?’ ‘Yeah, I understand. You better hope he doesn’t call.’ He didn’t. Clink made it almost to the very end, until he started bringing his new puppy to work with him, and the damn dog ate a hole in the wall and then knocked over my guitar, and we just had to let him go…” [2.]\n\nMustaine however explains that Mike Clink has always been given credit for all the production on ‘Rust In Peace’ and decribes it as ‘a terrific record, start to finish.’\n\nIn the CD booklet, Dave Mustaine describes the ‘sliding doors’ moment when he realised that Marty Friedman was the next guitarist for the band, beginning the band’s iconic era, defined by a unique sonic chemistry:\n\n“I was miserable and had tried everything; everything except that one ‘Varney’ dude with half-orange/half-black hair and a CD named ‘Dragon Kiss’ attached to it. After hoping against hope, he was one of the last guys I had to listen to, or more likely wanted to listen to; in fact, I only put in the CD to see what kind of music a guy with that hair color would sound like. Megadeth changed forever that day. Marty had a unique and beautiful style that was a breath of fresh air.” [1.]\n\nMarty Friedman recounted in an interview with The Sick Room radio, New Zealand, that he knew nothing about Megadeth before joining and had an audition for Madonna’s band the same week that he tried out for the thrash metal gods! Friedman talks fondly of the band chemistry:\n\n“It just felt right, right off the bat…I thought ‘these guys are awesome’…needless to say, I didn’t even bother doing the Madonna audition…At that time, I was homeless and living in Hollywood…I really loved the music…It was just a good solid album…There weren’t a whole lot of bands doing stuff that was that aggressive outside of punk, and we had the punk attitude…at that time, it was really unique…I thought it was too extreme for the mainstream…too hardcore…I came in and rehearsed everything with everybody and basically was given the freedom to do whatever I wanted – ‘play it like you wanna play it’…I thought it was a magical creative connection…”\n\n[7.]\n\n“Who’s a pretty boy then?” Mustaine, Menza, Ellefson, Friedman – the classic Megadeth line-up\n\nTutored by amazing musicians who were part of his jazz-musician father’s circle when he grew up in Munich, Germany, Nick Menza brought that flavour to the band when he joined, albeit some may find that influence hard to find in a thrash-metal album! Bassist Dave Ellefson was a co-founder of the band with Mustaine and a partner in crime for years to come, on and off. Marty Friedman completed the ‘classic’ line-up…Mustaine, Friedman, Ellefson and Menza created an amazing trilogy of Megadeth albums – war-torn post-nuclear holocaust ‘Rust In Peace’, the environmental commentary of ‘Countdown To Extinction’ and 1994’s ‘Youthanasia’, about the United States effectively killing its youth (as electronic meisters Suicide had prophesised in ‘Ghost Rider’). Happy days? Well, yes, if you like your music edgy and political with a punishing force! Anthems like ‘Symphony Of Destruction’, ‘Sweating Bullets’ and the poignant farwell ‘A Tout Le Monde’ were born of this era and stand the test of the three decades that have elapsed since…\n\nHoly Wars…The Punishment Due\n\n“Brother will kill brother\n\nSpilling blood across the land\n\nKilling for religion\n\nSomething I don’t understand…”\n\n[1.]\n\nApparently ‘Holy Wars’ was inspired by a trip that Dave Mustaine made to Northern Ireland. The first part of the song is certainly about religious wars, past, present and maybe gazing into a prophecy of a future new world order…Israel is also name-checked and the lyrics could relate to many conflicts where ‘brother will kill brother’ – Sufis, versus Shiites or Sunnis in the Middle East? Hindus versus Muslims in the Indian subcontinent? The second part of the song is about fictional anti-hero The Punisher, from the comic books published by Marvel. The main character, Francis ‘Frank’ Castle (anglified from ‘Castiglione’) is an Italian-American who first appeared in ‘The Amazing Spiderman’ in 1974, a dangerous war veteran ex-Marine-turned-vigilante who loves killing and all things violent, employing every manner of physical brutality in his one-man crusade against crime.\n\nHangar 18\n\n“Military intelligence\n\nTwo word combined that don’t make sense”\n\n[1.]\n\nMustaine highlights the oxy-moronic language used in politics and defence-speak, just as outspoken poets and musicians like Gil Scott-Heron have done.\n\nMustaine takes sole credit for the lyrics and music on the release but some say that Nick Menza had a hand in the words…In any case, the song is a Megadeth classic and has since been a live staple. It features a conspiracy theory, possibly about aliens who have landed with equipment capable of achieving their goal of controlling the human race…\n\nTake No Prisoners\n\nCall and response! Yes, the classic songwriting, lyric-writing, singing tradition gets a re-write, Dave Mustaine style!\n\n“Got one chance, (infiltrate them)\n\nGet it right, (terminate them)\n\nThe Panzers will (permeate them)\n\nBreak their pride (denigrate them)\n\nAnd their people (retrograde them)\n\nTyphus, (deteriorate them)\n\nEpidemic (devastate them)\n\nTake no prisoners, (cremate them)\n\nBurn!” [1.]\n\nThe song is an anti-war anthem and delves into Second World War territory, something Mustaine acknowledges may not have been the most diplomatic, given that Marty Friedman was Jewish and asked to sing backing vocals on lines about the Panzer divisions…\n\nFive Magics\n\nNo less than seven guitar solos feature in this Mustaine-penned masterpiece about the occult, dwelling lyrically as it does on themes of wizardry, alchemy, sorcery and, of course, magic…A princely five minutes and forty-two seconds long, the tune involves a number of musical and tempo changes, illustrating the complexity of the band’s music and giving the musicians a chance to stretch out.\n\nPoison Was The Cure\n\nWas poison the cure? Dave Mustaine has said that he wrote the song about heroin addiction, his chemical abuse and how, at the time, he thought that said poison was the cure to his problems. Dave Ellefson talked to Meltdown on the thirtieth anniversary of ‘Rust In Peace’ and one of the top topics was substance abuse. Ellefson also refers to his relationship with the difficult Mr. Mustaine: “Can you hang out?…It’s like a marriage you know…Dave brings the ‘rock god’ part to it, and I bring the humanity…” [5.]\n\nLucretia\n\nIs this song about a dream state, ghosts, family past and gone? It’s gothic in it’s lyrical content anyway as Dave Mustaine paints a very ethereal picture, very different to a lot of the subject matter on the album. Could it be inspired by Lucretia, the tragic heroine of Ancient Rome, the beautiful wife of a nobeman who was raped and subsequently stabbed herself to death?\n\nTornado Of Souls\n\nAnother tale of tragedy? A violent rotation between earth and the skies above? Certainly nihilistic lyrics about a break-up or many, with a very catchy chorus:\n\n“But now I’m safe in the eye of the tornado\n\nI can’t replace the lies that let a thousand days go\n\nNo more living, trapped inside\n\nIn her way, I’ll surely die\n\nIn the eye of the tornado, blow me away”\n\n[1.]\n\nShakespearean in its play out, the protagonist poisons the subject of the song in the end, after much planning…\n\nDawn Patrol\n\n“Thermal count is rising\n\nIn perpetual writhing\n\nThe primordial ooze\n\nAnd the sanity they lose\n\nAwakened in the morning\n\nTo more air pollution warnings\n\nStill we sleepwalk off to work\n\nWhile our nervous systems jerk\n\nPretending not to notice\n\nHow history had forebode us\n\nWith the green house in effect\n\nOur environment was wrecked\n\nNow I can only laugh\n\nAs I read our epitaph\n\nWe end our lives as moles\n\nIn the dark of dawn patrol” [1.]\n\nWill the air be so polluted in future that we will all have to live underground? Mustaine narrates a post-apocalyptic dystopian landscape picture over a slow bass figure, a break from the thrash and speed metal mayhem, but disturbing none the less.\n\nRust In Peace…Polaris\n\n“In December 1962, President John F Kennedy told the British Prime-Minister Harold Macmillan that the US would sell its most advanced nuclear missile technology to the UK – so long as it remained nominally a NATO deterrent capability.\n\nBritain was given the then-revolutionary UGM-27 Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) under the 1962 Nassau Agreement. The US agreed to sell the missile, launch compartment and guidance technology to Britain, which in turn would manufacture her own nuclear warheads and the submarines to carry the system.” [4.]\n\nSo that’s the brief history of Polaris, but what of the song? It starts with Nick Menza’s drum fills, before the crunching rhythm guitars and bass kick in, followed by screaming lead, then Dave Mustaine’s distinctive snarling vocals:\n\n“Tremble, you weaklings, cower in fear\n\nI am your ruler – land, sea, and air\n\nImmense in my girth, erect I stand tall\n\nI am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris” [1.]\n\nWritten in the first person, as if the nuclear missile system is narrating the song, the lyrics are excellent, biting, toxic and delivered with the necessary venom:\n\n“Winds blow from the bowels of Hell\n\nWill we give warning? Only time will tell\n\nSatan rears his ugly head\n\nTo spit into the wind” [1.]\n\nThe chorus is even more powerful:\n\n“I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload\n\nA mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils\n\nI spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload\n\nA mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils\n\nLaunch the Polaris\n\nThe end doesn’t scare us\n\nWhen will this cease\n\nThe warheads will all rest in peace” [1.]\n\nThe tempo increases for the second part of the piece, Mustaine and Friedman rocking out on some gnarly riffs while Ellefson and Menza provide the somewhat jazzy groove beneath. There’s a brief pause to let the warheads rest in peace and then there’s infectious riffing to the outro…At just over five and a half minutes, there’s enough time for plenty of musical interest in this symphony of destruction – a fine closure to a superb album and a Megadeth classic.\n\nIn what was allegedly his last interview before he died in 2016, Nick Menza said that the ‘Rust In Peace’ album possessed a ‘raw energy’ because the band recorded it in the studio live:\n\n“We rehearsed Rust In Peace for a year, then we went into the studio and we cut it live. There’s no click track on that record – it’s really raw and has a lot of energy…”Rust In Peace is the milestone album, because it’s not using the click, it’s about being tight. You’ve got to go into the studio and be prepared.” [6.]\n\nAfter forty minutes and forty-four seconds of the original album, if you’ve managed to survive the onslaught, you’ll surely be drained, emotionally and physically, as if you’ve been dragged, and sometimes catapulted, through a post apocalyptic dystopia, and if you happened to die out there and lie like a piece of metal ripped apart by an unforgiving world, rust in peace…\n\n‘Heads down no nonsense mindless boogie…’\n\n‘Rust In Peace’ tracklisting:\n\nHoly Wars…The Punishment Due (Mustaine)\n\nHangar 18 (Mustaine)\n\nTake No Prisoners (Mustaine)\n\nFive Magics (Mustaine)\n\nPoison Was The Cure (Mustaine)\n\nLucretia (Music: Mustaine/Ellefson, lyrics: Mustaine)\n\nTornado Of Souls (Music: Mustaine, lyrics: Mustaine/Ellefson)\n\nDawn Patrol (music: Ellefson, lyrics: Mustaine)\n\nRust In Peace…Polaris (Mustaine)\n\n‘Rust In Peace’\n\nOriginally released: 24th September 1990\n\nLabel: Capitol\n\nRecorded at: Rumbo Recorders, Los Angeles, USA\n\nProduced by: Mike Clink and Dave Mustaine\n\nEngineered by: Mike Clink and Micajah Ryan assisted by Andy Udoff\n\nMixed by: Max Norman at One On One Recorders\n\nAlbum cover illustration: Edward J.

Marty Friedman talks Megadeth’s ‘Rust In Peace’ album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wky7X3187oA\n\nFor me, there’s a trilogy of Manfred Mann’s Earth Band albums which are their classic and best recordings – 1973’s ‘Solar Fire’, 1975’s ‘Nightingales And Bombers’ and 1976’s ‘The Roaring Silence’.\n\nAll three open with monumental cover versions, taking songs by Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen and reinterpreting/rearranging them to great effect:\n\n‘Solar Fire’ starts with ‘Father Of Day, Father Of Night’, a song Dylan included as ‘Father Of Night’ at the end of his 1970 album ‘New Morning’, interpreting the Jewish prayer ‘Amidah’ in just over a minute and a half. The ‘Amidah’ is also known as ‘The Standing Prayer’ or ‘The Silent Prayer’ and is central to the Jewish tradition, so provides a weighty historical background for the interpretative recordings. The central tenet is that this is a conversation that person is having with God – It is a reflection on the ancestors and a giving of thanks to the creator. Clocking in at nearly ten minutes, the Earth Band version is epic, beginning with a capella harmony vocals, creating a spiritual, hymn-like ambience before the rock music kicks in.\n\nBruce Springsteen’s ‘Spirits In The Night’ opens ‘Nightingales And Bombers’. The singer-songwriter, later to be nicknamed ‘The Boss’, was relatively unknown at this time. The third track on side two of debut album ‘Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.’, the song was originally titled ‘Spirit In The Night’. The Springsteen version has a loose, easy-going, almost bouncy feel, sax fills and call/response backing vocals adding to the upbeat nature of the groove. The Earth Band interpretation feels much darker and, at 6:28, extends nearly a minute and a half beyond the original, although a single edit was produced, cutting the song down to a radio-friendly three minutes and seventeen seconds. Mann’s keyboard riff starts the song, setting the scene for Mick Rogers vocals. The chorus has response backing vocals from Ruby James, Doreen Chanter & Martha Smith, enhanced by muted power chords. The atmosphere of the track is edgy and atmospheric, evoking that trip out to Greasy Lake with a bottle of rosé, the moonlight and stars shining down…\n\nSpringsteen’s debut also provided first track ‘Blinded By The Light’ for ‘The Roaring Silence’. The vibe of the original recording is similar to ‘Spirit In The Night’, with very much a live feel to it and each band member jamming along with The Boss, who’s vocals are soulful, skilfully delivering the reams of poetry in there. The seven-minute MMEB cover is longer than the original by a couple of minutes but, as with ‘Spirits’ a single edit was created, lasting 3:49. It is the arrangement of the MMEB version that works so well, with the stops in the full band after each ‘Blinded By The Light’ is sung, exposing the powerful, distinctive keyboard riff. This album showcased a change from the original line-up, frontman Mick Rogers having left, to be replaced by Chris Hamlet Thompson on lead vocals/rhythm guitar and Dave Flett on lead guitar. Despite this major shift in personnel, ‘The Roaring Silence’ retains that Earth Band classic rock sound.\n\nThe title of this album ‘Nightingales And Bombers was inspired by a recording made on 19th May 1942, during the Second World War, in Surrey, England, by a BBC sound engineer. Intending to capture the nightingale’s song he also, by accident, recorded the sound of RAF bombers on their way to attack Mannheim, Germany. In that raid 197 planes were dispatched and 12 were lost. The recording has been incorporated at the end of ‘As Above, So Below’, which closes Side Two of the record.Manfred Mann says that ‘Nightingales and Bombers proved a difficult album to put together…We were really reaching the end of where we knew when we were going. Towards the end of the album, we were thrashing around in the dark. I thought some of it was good and some of it was a bit schizophrenic.” [1.] The album certainly doesn’t come across like that, not only standing the test of time and showcasing the Earth Band’s considerable musical talents but standing out as one of the best in their canon.\n\nOn Side One of the original LP, ‘Spirits In The Night’ is followed by ‘Countdown’, along with ‘Crossfade’ one of two instrumentals book-ending the Mann/Slade/Rogers composition ‘Time Is Right’. Both instrumentals feature the band’s improvisational talents, Mann’s moog synthesiser sounds trading passages with Roger’s searing lead guitar. ‘Countdown’ is up tempo, based around a recurring rock riff, whereas ‘Crossfade’ has more of a funk feel, building to a rockier beat which plays to fade. Greg Russo points out in ‘Mannerisms [4.] that ‘Time Is Right’ is a descendant of ‘Driva Man’, a tune written by Oscar Brown Jr. and Max Roach, from the Manfreds 1966 ‘As Was’ EP and one listen to the sixties recording reveals the similarity instantly, both melodically and lyrically. The feel is of course wildly different, the ‘As Was’ song sounding very psychedelic. If you go back to discover the original Oscar Brown Jr. and Max Roach recording from the 1960 album ‘We Insist’, the ‘Freedom Now’ suite, it’s another world entirely, steeped in jazz and film-noir, words fusing slavery and American protest politics delivered by vocalist Abbey Lincoln with tenor sax licks by the now well-known musician Coleman Hawkins. Side Two opens with ‘Visionary Mountains’ another cover, this time of a song written by Joan Armatrading and released on her debut album ‘Whatever’s For Us’, a collaboration with singer-songwriter Pam Nestor, who also co-wrote this beautiful piece with it’s lovely melody and thought-provoking lyrics. The original recording is only one minute and forty-nine seconds long. It’s a stripped back arrangement with Joan Armatrading on vocals and piano, accompanied by Davey Johnstone on sitar. As you’d expect, the Earth Band expand the tune musically, giving it the full rock/progressive rock treatment and stretching it out to nearly six minutes. The beauty of the original melody is, however, retained and enhanced.\n\nThe U.S. version also included a cover of Bob Dylan’s ‘Quit Your Lowdown Ways’ as the second track on Side Two. This was included as one of the bonus digital downloads with the CD reissue, along with the single version of ‘Spirits In The Night’. Dylan wrote the song for his second album ‘The Freewheelin’ Bob Bylan’ but it didn’t make the record and Peter, Paul & Mary were the first to release it in 1963. It later surfaced on Dylan’s ‘Bootleg Series 1-3’ in 1991. The MMEB version is much slower than the frantic folk of the Peter, Paul & Mary version, closer to the tempo of the Dylan recording, based around a funky riff and featuring a blistering double-tracked guitar solo by Mick Rogers.\n\nTitle track ‘Nightingales And Bombers’ is a fittingly haunting instrumental composition by Mick Rogers, with an ascending and descending figure which repeatsover the course of the beginning and end of the tune. Signalling the musical direction that Rogers would go in after this album, the wild improvisational mid-section wouldn’t sound out of place on a Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra or Return To Forever album – Rogers went on to form a band called Eclipse in Australia in his relatively brief hiatus from the Earth Band.‘Fat Nelly’, written by Manfred Mann and Peter Thomas contains some macabre lyrics: “Fat Nelly was killed by a butcher’s knife and her blood ran red all over my life.” The ‘nobody laughed, nobody cried’ part and description of ‘a street screamed rape by a garden gate’ add to the disturbing feeling of the song. Greg Russo points out that the recurring riff in ‘Fat Nelly’ comes from the beginning of Leoš Janáček’s dramatic 1923 composition ‘String Quartet No. 1’ [4.]. Janáček was allegedly inspired to write this piece by Leo Tolstoy’s novella ‘The Kreutzer Sonata’, which was in turn inspired by Beethoven’s Violin Sonata No. 9, known by that name. So, a lot of history in what at first seems like quite a whimsical song! The spacey instrumental that closes the album, ‘As Above, So Below’, is credited to Mann/Rogers/Slade/Pattenden and was allegedly edited from an improvisation in the mid section of ‘The Mighty Quinn’, recorded live on 18th December 1973 at The Marquee Club in London, England. Mann excels in the creative layered synthesiser and organ solos, over a rhythm shuffle which builds to a climax, accompanied by guitar licks and backing vocals, then fades. The track was also the b-side of the ‘Spirits In The Night’ single. As noted above, it finishes with the all-important ‘nightingales and bombers’ recording from 1942 which inspired the album title.\n\nThe Earth Band was formed as a new direction by Manfred Mann in 1971, when the virtuoso leader felt like he had been trapped in his jazz venture ‘Chapter Three’, similar to the claustrophobia he’d felt in the latter part of the sixties pop/r’n’b era. The ‘earth’ part of the name was apparently suggested by Chris Slade in acknowledgement of the growing ecological movement, also differentiating the new group from the previous bands. The core members for their recordings from their debut in 1972 to ‘The Good Earth’ in 1974 were Mick Rogers – guitar, vocals, Manfred Mann – organ, synthesisers, Colin Pattenden – bass, Chris Slade – drums, percussion. A version of the band, featuring founding members Manfred Mann and Mick Rogers was still active and touring in 2020.\n\nIf you want to find out more about Manfred Mann and his music, ‘Mannerisms – The Five Phases Of Manfred Mann’, Greg Russo’s biography of his career is a thoughtful, extremely thorough, well-researched, celebration of a lifetime of amazing music [4. link below]: The phases detailed are the sixties rhythm and blues/pop bands, the jazz of Manfred Mann Chapter Three, the progressive rock of Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, subsequent side projects and the reformations of the Earth Band and Manfred Mann.

The plane ran out of fuel and the pilot tried to redirect to a local airport, but didn’t make it. There has been much investigation and speculation since the crash about factors which caused it and what happened on board. Gene Odom, who grew up with the band and later served as their security manager, was on the flight and, with Frank Dorman, wrote a biography which provides a lot of detail on the fateful day. Odom described his survival thus: “I was thrown from the plane through a hole in the fuselage. My neck was broken, and my face and head were cut deeply. I was the only person burned in the accident. The doctors thought it must have been caused by oil, battery acid or hydraulic fluid, but I was told later that the plane had carried de-icing flares, and that phosphorus from a flare had melted the side of my head and liquefied my left eye…” [2.]\n\nA tree-filled swamp about a quarter of a mile from the nearest road, the location of the crash was later named ‘Slaughterhouse Road’ by some of the locals. Farmers Johnny and Brenda Mote were the first to encounter three of the survivors who managed to walk from the wreck towards their property – drummer Artimus Pyle, Marc Frank and Kenneth Peden Jr.. Johnny originally suspected they could be escaped prisoners so fired a warning gunshot over their heads as they approached, but they did help them when they realised what had happened, Peden yelling “Our plane just crashed; it’s bad; they need help”. [2.]\n\nThose who perished in the accident were Ronnie Van Zant (the band’s lead singer), Steve Gaines (guitarist from Miami, Oklahoma, who had joined in 1976 to replace Ed King), Cassie Gaines (backing singer and sister of guitarist Steve), assistant road manager Dean Kilpatrick, pilot Walter McCreary and co-pilot William Gray. Twenty other passengers survived, a number suffering multiple injuries which would have longlasting effect on their lives.\n\n“Our fall through the air felt nearly the same as it would for the routine landing. But all hope vanished when we struck the first tree ninety-eight feet above the swamp.” (Farley) [2.]\n\nThe lyrics of the song ‘You Got That Right’ written by Steve Gaines and Ronnie Van Zant for the ‘Street Survivors’ album, “You won’t find me in an old folks home” turned out to be darkly prophetic, particularly as this trackwas played live on that final tour. It also brought home the fact that considerable songwriting talents were lost as well as musicians. Ronnie co-wrote most of the band’s best known songs and Steve brought his song-crafting talents with him, offering much promise for their future direction…\n\nCountry musician Charlie Daniels wrote this memorial poem for his close friend Ronnie Van Zant:\n\n“A brief candle, both ends burning\n\nan endless smile, a bus wheel turning\n\na friend to share a lonesome time\n\na handshake and a sip of wine\n\nsay it loud and let it ring\n\nthat we’re all part of everything\n\nthe future, present and the past.\n\nfly on proud bird, you’re free at last” [2.]\n\n“He hated snakes and he always hated to fly…” said Bill Ferris, another friend of Van Zant, whom Ronnie had invited to help manage what turned out to be the final tour for him – Ferris declined and therefore avoided disaster…[2.]\n\nRewind three and a half years or so and the band were in the studio creating the song for their debut album for MCA, ‘Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd’…They had found a friend and mentor in musician and producer Al Kooper, whom they had encountered in Funochio’s rock and roll nightclub in Atlanta, Georgia. Kooper was veteran of rock music, having recorded with Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones, as well as being part of Blues Project and founding Blood, Sweat and Tears. Skynyrd were playing there for a week and, according to Gene Odom, “for Kooper it was love at first sound. He liked their songs and he loved their down-to-earth style, something he felt had been missing from contemporary rock and roll.” [2]\n\nKooper described the vibe in an interview with BAM magazine in 1979: “These guys had Japanese guitars, no socks and shoes, and lousy amps. I got to see them five nights in a row, because we were hanging out there…The first night I dug ‘I Ain’t The One’. The second night I dug ‘Gimme Three Steps’, and by the fourth night I was up onstage, jamming with them. The fifth night I offered them a record deal.” [1.]\n\nAt the time of this recording, the band were a six-piece: Ronnie Van Zant – lead vocals, Gary Rossington – lead and rhythm guitars, Allen Collins – lead and rhythm guitars, Ed King – bass, Billy Powell – keyboards and Robert Burns – drums. Leon Wilkenson left the band before the album was recorded, having written most of the bass parts for the songs, and he was to rejoin shortly after, Ed King switching to guitar. Although ‘Pronounced’ was their debut album, the band had worked relentlessly on their sound and had earned their musical ‘chops’. Known as a ‘southern rock’ band, Van Zant referred to them as ‘a rock band from the south’. The core founder members were from Jacksonville, Florida and Burns was from Gainesville, Florida, but other players on their debut were from across the USA – Ed King being from Los Angeles, Billy Powell from Corpus Christi, Texas. Rossington and Collins were well-versed at playing together and this comes across in the interplay and fluidity of the guitar work on this and future recordings. A lot of the power and popularity of Skynyrd’s music lies in their ‘blue collar’ appeal, with an honest approach to lyrics, often reflecting true life experiences and sung from the heart. The songwriting appeals to ‘ordinary people’ and the music incorporates a lot of the ‘feel’ which is at the core of the band’s blues, soul, country and rock’n’roll roots.\n\nRaw versions of ‘I Ain’t The One’, ‘Gimme Three Steps’, ‘Free Bird’, ‘Things Goin’ On’ and ‘Simple Man’ were recorded by Skynyrd in 1971 and 1972 at Muscle Shoals studios in Alabama. Nine tracks from the session were released as the ‘Skynyrd’s First And…Last’ LP in 1978, with the complete seventeen-track album later issued on CD. Al Kooper thought these tracks were the stand-outs from the Muscle Shoals recordings and wanted them to feature on ‘Pronounced’.\n\nSide One starts with ‘I Ain’t The One’ by Gary Rossington and Ronnie Van Zant, a great rockin’ opener which sets out Kooper’s stall as producer – The version of this song, as with the others from the ’71 and ’72 sessions is superlative, the master musician not only coaxing great performances from the band but achieving near-perfection in the recording and mix – meaty, punchy, authentic and memorable.\n\n‘Tuesday’s Gone’ follows, a beautiful lilting ballad written by Allen Collins and Ronnie Van Zant, features a sweeping mellotron played by producer Al Kooper. This remains one of Skynyrd’s most heartbreaking songs and one of my favourites.\n\n‘Gimme Three Steps’ by Allen Collins and Ronnie Van Zant is a story of some aggro in a saloon, ‘The Jug’, adding some wild west feel to the tune. “The Pronounced version…was much more forceful than the original, with Gary’s lead and Allen’s rhythm substantially strengthened by Kooper’s wise decision to double-record them. The added density of the twin guitars enlivened this bouncing barroom romp, and the beat of a bongo, played by percussionist Bobbi Hall…, was a suitable supplement to Bob Burns’ drums.” [2.]\n\n‘Simple Man’ is a very moving piece, with a musical backing formed from only three chords, albeit embellished by the virtuoso guitar players and with dynamics effectively differentiating between verse and chorus. These words of wisdom from a mother to her son were penned by Gary Rossington and Ronnie Van Zant. Van Zant has introduced it in concert as reflecting what his grandmother used to say to him. The lore tells us that Kooper resisted inclusion of the song on the album and that he fought with Van Zant over the issue. This version is undoubtedly the definitive one so worth fighting for!\n\nSide Two opens with the honky-tonk stomp of ‘Things Goin’ On’ by Gary Rossington and Ronnie Van Zant, a strong contrast to ‘Simple Man’, but a poignant song in other ways, covering as it does social and environmental issues. It is somewhat of a protest song, but perhaps not in an obvious way. In any case, it all seems so natural in the performing, and impossible not to tap your foot along to.\n\n‘Mississippi Kid’ by Al Kooper, Robert Burns and Ronnie Van Zant features some mean mandolin picking and has a great acoustic roots feel to it, a tune for a hot, humid night out on the porch.\n\nAt only three minutes and eleven seconds long, ‘Poison Whiskey’ is the shortest track on the record, but that is not to its detriment. It’s a very catchy rock tune by Ed King and Ronnie Van Zant about a southern man who succumbed to the old demon alcohol, with a funky, upbeat feel to it, despite being about a dad who died from drinking…\n\n‘Free Bird’, written by Allen Collins and Ronnie Van Zant, rightly closes the record. The song remains the best known in the Skynyrd canon and is undoubtedly an all-time rock classic. Clocking in at nine minutes and eight seconds, the familiar recording might not have survived had the record company had their way. MCA pressurised the band into shortening the song for radio play, the industry standard for singles being three minutes, but Skynyrd refused to give in, knowing how well the song went over live. They were of course right in sticking to their guns, vindicated by many years of radio play and inclusion in rock show/magazine playlists. The clever chord progression is the strong backbone of the tune, the now-familiar climbdown from G major down to E minor, followed by the half step up to F then to C and D – It’s one of those tunes which can be stripped back to just an acoustic guitar strum and still be recognisable – one of the tests of great songwriting. In many ways, the lyrics and music define the band and their approach to life.\n\nFirst called My Backyard, the band owe their more famous adopted name to one of their former school teachers. In a 1974 radio interview, Ed King was asked “Allen ,Ed, Billy, Gary Ronnie and Leon – Who the heck is Leonard?” His reply was: “Leonard Skinner, spelt the conventional way, was a gym coach down in Jacksonville, Florida, when the nucleus of the band was together going to high school. They got thrown out of school one time or another for having their hair too long, because this was back in the late sixties in the south, it was absolutely forbidden, you know – you couldn’t do it. So finally, the last time, Leonard Skinner kicked them out…They just stayed out of school, decided to name the band after him.” The interviewer then asked the question many have asked (and referred to in the title of this debut album) “Why d’ya change the spelling?” Mr. Skinner himself wrote to the band, expressing his displeasure at their appropriation of his name. Ironically, the band had cause in 1978 to write to him through their lawyers protesting about his use of his own name in his ventures into the entertainment industry, which the band saw as possibly misleading for the public, particularly when used in connection with the likes of concert promotion.\n\nThe original Lynyrd Skynyrd left behind a quality legacy of recordings which stand the test of time and deserve repeated listening: studio albums ‘Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd’ (1973), ‘Second Helping’ (1974), ‘Nuthin’ Fancy’ (1975), ‘Gimme Back My Bullets (1976) and ‘Street Survivors’ (1977) are some of the finest, honest, soulful, authentic rock recordings that you will hear, and along with kindred spirits like The Allman Brothers, Blackfoot and The Outlaws, they are certainly leading lights in the genre labelled ‘Southern Rock’. Later released as ‘Skynyrd’s First And Last’, the collection of the ‘demo’ recordings completed at the famous Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Sheffield, Alabama, are a must-have for Skynyrd fans, featuring great versions of many tracks later re-recorded and the beautiful falsetto vocals of Ricky Medlocke, singer/guitarist with Florida band Blackfoot, on ‘White Dove’. The double live album ‘One More From The Road’ captures the energy and chemistry of Skynyrd’s show perfectly and sits well alongside other double live rock albums of that era. Many songs from those albums – The likes of ‘Sweet Home Alabama’, ‘Free Bird’, ‘Tuesday’s Gone’, ‘Simple Man’ – continue to be rock radio staples and are likely to remain in the classic rock juke box for some time to come…\n\n‘Pronounced’ tracklisting:\n\nSide One\n\nI Ain’t The One (Rossington/Van Zant)\n\nTuesday’s Gone (Collins/Van Zant)\n\nGimme Three Steps (Collins/Van Zant)\n\nSimple Man (Rossington/Van Zant)\n\nSide Two\n\nThings Goin’ On (Rossington/Van Zant)\n\nMississippi Kid (Al Kooper/Burns/Van Zant)\n\nPoison Whiskey (King/Van Zant)\n\nFree Bird (Collins/Van Zant)\n\n‘Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd’\n\nOriginally released: 13th August 1973\n\nLabel: MCA\n\nRecorded at: Studio One, Doraville, Georgia\n\nProduced by: Al Kooper\n\nPersonnel – Lynyrd Skynyrd:\n\nRonnie Van Zant – lead vocals\n\nGary Rossington – lead and rhythm guitars\n\nAllen Collins – lead and rhythm guitars\n\nEd King – lead guitar on ‘Mississippi Kid’; bass on all tracks except ‘Mississippi Kid’ and ‘Tuesday’s Gone’\n\nBilly Powell – keyboards\n\nRobert Burns – drums\n\nLeon Wilkenson – played bass for the band up until the album was cut and rejoined not long after; wrote many of the bass parts on the album\n\nPersonnel – guests:\n\nRoosevelt Gook – bass, mellotron and backup harmony vocals on ‘Tuesday’s Gone’; organ on ‘Simple Man’; mandolin and bass drum on ‘Mississippi Kid’; organ on ‘Poison Whiskey’ and ‘Free Bird’\n\nRobert Nix – drums on ‘Tuesday’s Gone’\n\nBobbi Hall – percussion on ‘Gimme Three Steps’ and ‘Things Goin’ On’\n\nSteve Katz – harmonica on ‘Mississippi Kid’\n\nReferences, quotes and photographs:\n\n1.

London: Pan Macmillan.\n\nSince I first picked up a second-hand vinyl copy when I was in my teens, this has been my ‘go to’ Led Zeppelin album. Every time I moved into a new place, I’d set up my hi-fi before unpacking all the boxes, put this on the turntable and drop the needle on to the start of side one – crackle, crackle, then that familiar snippet of Robert Plant’s laugh before that Jimmy Page riff begins the groove – na na na na na…”You’ve been cooling, honey I ain’t fooling…” When the drums and bass kick in, the neighbours soon know you’ve arrived and it feels like home…\n\n“The release of ‘Zeppelin Two’ brought in advance orders of 350,000 from the States alone. The album had been written in a variety of hotel rooms, breaks and rehearsals, and sometimes during these rehearsals whole numbers took shape virtually on the spot. To fit in with all the touring, the tracks were recorded in London, Vancouver and New York as and when time allowed.”\n\n[2.]\n\nAs Stephen Davis states in ‘Hammer Of The Gods’, the first Led Zeppelin album, released was ‘The band’s early show, recorded in a London studio with a minimum of overdubs, 1968.’ whilst the follow-up Led Zeppelin II aka ‘The Brown Bomber’ was ‘written and recorded on the road in America, 1969. Its release marks the beginning of the Heavy Metal era.’ [4.]\n\nContinues Davis “Led Zeppelin II was the product of an English band’s insane life on the road, written in snatches in motel rooms, dressing rooms and studios all over North America. Since English musicians were allowed only six months a year in America, they were under constant pressure to make every day pay day.” [4.]\n\nRobert Plant hailed from Worcestershire in England, near the Welsh border and cut his musical teeth in the Birmingham area with blues bands like the Crawling King Snakes and the Band Of Joy, a latter incarnation of which featured drummer John Bonham. Plant and Bonham developed a close personal friendship, as well as bonding over music, Plant becoming influenced by the US West Coast scene as well as the blues and soul that already permeated. Bonham eventually sought pastures new as Band Of Joy failed to attract decent money for their gigs.\n\nRecalling the sessions that yielded his song ‘The Hurdy Gurdy Man’, Donovan suggests that three-quarters of Led Zeppelin may have first bonded making his music:\n\n“Upon my return from India, I sat in my cottage and sang the songs I had composed out there. There was one powerful tune: ‘The Hurdy Gurdy Man’…I could the acoustic chording down the song, but I could also hear absolutely wild electric guitars – lots of them.” [11.] Donovan initially wanted to give the song to Jimi Hendrix to record, then thought of inviting him to play on it, but Hendrix wasn’t available at the time so he looked for other ‘guitar wizards’: “The guitar wizards were my old friends Jimmy Page and Allen Hollsworth, a session guitarist that had played with Blue Mink, among others. John Paul Jones and I had worked together before and he arranged and played on the ‘Hurdy Gurdy Man’ sessions. We were joined by drummers Clem Catini and John Bonham. A warm acoustic opening led into a blazing rock fuzz-guitar sound with manic drums, my vibrato vocal vibing with the tempo…Layers of guitar were added by Page and Hollsworth and a new kind of metal-folk was created. The term ‘metal’ had not been coined for music yet, but perhaps Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham were inspired by the session to form Led Zeppelin.” [11.] Donovan also says that “Led Zeppelin often later played his song ‘Season Of The Witch’.\n\nSays Donovan of pre-Zeppelin Page:\n\n“Jimmy was a session man then. He was in demand for his skill in so many styles, and my fusion of jazz, folk and Latin rock gave him an interesting lick to play. Quiet and withdrawn, he was one of the three major British guitarists of the time, alongside Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. Elfin features, slim body and the dark clothes of a bohemian drifter showed me he was from the same scene as me. Later, Jimmy would develop an image which came out of his interest in the occult, the Western path of magic. This was later misunderstood as dark and evil, just as his hero Aleister Crowley’s image had been misunderstood in the 1920s.” [11.]\n\nSo, apparently Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were veteran session men and had also encountered John Bonham on their musical travels. But how did they find a vocalist? Stephen Davis completes the story in his infamous account of the band ‘Hammer Of The Gods’: Allegedly Peter Grant, future Zeppelin Manager and Jimmy Page were looking for a singer ‘with the romantic persona of a Rod Stewart, someone with the nerve to get up on stage and emote vocally with an electric guitar.’ Disappointed that the best singers they knew were ‘taken’, they bumped into one of their choices Terry Reid who ‘told them about an unknown singer with a band called Hobstweedle up in Birmingham, a great tall blond geezer who looked like a fairy prince with this caterwauling voice, who was heavy into blues and the West Coast bands. They called him ‘The Wild Man of Blues from the Black Country’. His name was Robert Plant…They made plans…to see Robert at a Hobstweedle gig that weekend. When Robert asked about a drummer, Jimmy said he was still looking. Robert said he knew someone Jimmy should hear…” [4.]\n\nLed Zeppelin were originally called The New Yardbirds because the other members were recruited to fulfill tour dates in Europe following demise of the British blues band which had featured a string of virtuoso guitarists, including Jimmy Page.\n\nThere are various stories about how the band came to be re-named but, according to Jimmy Page:\n\n“We were sitting there kicking around group names and I suddenly remembered a name which Keith Moon had come up with several months earlier. This goes right back to the days when Simon Napier-Bell, who was managing the Yardies, was trying to get solo discs from each member…So there was Keith Moon, John Paul Jones, Nicky Hopkins on piano, myself on twelve-string guitar and Jeff (Beck). We were doing ‘Beck’s Bolero’. After that session, Keith Moon was really fired up…and he said ‘We must get a band together – how about it?’ It didn’t happen because we couldn’t find the right vocalist. But Keith’s name for the band, Led Zeppelin, stuck in my mind.” [3.]\n\nJohn Entwhistle of The Who recalls that many bands would ask others how they’d gone down at gigs, to be told ‘like a lead zeppelin’. Other tales say that Keith Moon said the band would go down ‘like a lead balloon’ and that it was Page and company who changed that to Zeppelin, along with dropping the ‘a’ in ‘Lead’. I guess we will never find the truth, but the gist is there…\n\nThe debut album was steeped in the blues and a number of the tracks were saturated with John Paul-Jones organ playing, inviting comparisons with recordings by other blues-rock and hard-rock bands of the time, like Uriah Heep and Deep Purple. Led Zeppelin II has a much sparser feel to it, Jones focusing mainly on bass parts and the band being much more selective about the use of keyboard, for example to provide the atmospherics for the wistful ‘Thank You’ at the end of side one. As with the first album, the individual members play out of their skins on this record, the musicianship and band chemistry capturing the group at the peak of their powers.\n\nZep cover the spectrum of pitch with virtuosity in their recordings. John Paul Jones and John Bonham take care of the lower register, Jimmy Page fills the centre, augmented by Jones intermittent keyboard parts, and Robert Plant’s high-pitched banshee wail cuts clear over the top, creating their unmistakeable sound.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Absolute Radio, Jimmy Page sheds some light on the planning of Led Zeppelin II:\n\n“I can tell you it’s a guitar-led band. It was guitar-fuelled…We go in to record at Olympic in Barnes, first album’s done at Olympic, so we go in there, there’s a different engineer, we haven’t got Glyn Johns there, got a chap called George Chkiantz, and, however, the things we were going to record there – ‘Whole Lotta Love’, ‘What Is And What Should Never Be’ – we’ve actually rehearsed those tracks at my house. All the first album was rehearsed at my house, and the set that we were going to take out there to do some gigs before going into the studio for the first album, eh, there was a serious plan ahead of all this stuff…That’s what there was for the second album, to record it on those days. I had other things – I had ‘Ramble On’ – but we weren’t to record those until we were in America…” [7.]\n\nEddie Kramer explained in 2017 how he came to be involved in the album as engineer for the other tracks and what he initially thought of the band’s name!:\n\n“Let’s go back a little bit, because the history of how I met Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones sort of…by virtue of the fact that I was in the studio all the time and they were session guys – Jimmy Page was the rock session guy, you know, if you need a heavy-duty solo call Jimmy Page and if you wanted a kind of a pop arrangement with a bass player, you’d hire John Paul Jones – That’s what he did, he did arrangements, he played bass…I knew John Paul Jones a couple of years before I met Page. Page I believe was on a session with The Kinks that I was on in the early sixties but it hasn’t been confirmed as yet (laughs)…John Paul Jones was a good friend and he called me up one day and said ‘Hey, come over, I want to play you something’ and put on this record, which was the first Zeppelin record. I was just about to emigrate to America from England and he put this record on and I went ‘Holy crap! What is this?’ I mean it was so heavy, I’d never heard anything like it. He said ‘Yeah, it’s our new album’. I said ‘What’s the name of the band?’ He said ‘Led Zeppelin’. I said ‘That’s the stupidest bloody name I’ve ever heard!’ I was so wrong of course – You admit your mistakes obviously…Actually, I had recorded Jimmy Page a couple of times at Olympic – There was a song called ‘Hurdy Gurdy Man’ by Donovan – It was Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, it was not Bonham on drums by the way – so we knew each other, and then I came to America in ’68, they came to America in ’69 for their first tour and they brought with them Zeppelin II because this is what they were carrying around with them, this is what I was leading up to…and they had these huge steamer trunks full of tapes, ‘cause they had recorded some in England, they had recorded some in Vancouver, whatever city they landed in they would record something…and they said ‘Do you wanna mix it?’ and I said ‘Absolutely’ and we settled in New York at A and R studios, we went around quite a few studios and we recorded about five more tracks and I overdubbed a whole bunch of stuff and then we decided, ‘Okay, let’s mix it at A and R’, and we mixed it over a weekend there – It took two days, that was it. Imagine today trying to mix a whole record (in two days)…” [8.]\n\n‘Hammer Of The Gods’ recounts the background pressure on the album and tour at the time:\n\n“As the summer tour ground on, Led Zeppelin II had to be mixed down and completed as well, and Jimmy’s schedule got to be insane. For one mixing session in New York, Peter Grant and a journalist drove out to the airport to pick up Jimmy, who was flying in from a Zeppelin date in Salt Lake City to mix at A&R studio. After the session, Jimmy would fly immediately back to L.A. so he could rejoin the tour in Phoenix the day after that.” [4.]\n\nZeppelin were steeped in blues and folk traditions and drew from the deep well of source material that the historical archive of these genres provided, sometimes in a way that was too close to plagiarism for the comfort of the original artists. In 1985, bluesman Willie Dixon sued Led Zeppelin ‘claiming that ‘Whole Lotta Love’ had been lifted from his blues ‘You Need Love’ ‘. [4.]\n\nThe Muddy Waters single contains most of the lyrics used in Zep’s ‘Whole Lotta Love’ and the riffing is surely what Page developed into what you hear in the Zep tune. Apparently Waters had a hand in the writing of the words, but it was Willie Dixon that wrote the original song. Dixon was successful in his lawsuit, resulting in a payout from Zeppelin and future royalty credits.\n\nThe Small Faces ‘You Need Loving’ takes the song one step closer to Zep’s ‘version’ and Steve Marriott deserves a lot of credit from Robert Plant for his approach to the vocal, including his phrasing. So, great as the playing and arrangement on the final recording on Led Zeppelin II, Zeppelin owe a lot to Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and The Small Faces. Musically, that takes nothing away from ‘Whole Lotta Love’, which is amazing from start to finish, with a rock swagger, power and invention that takes it a long way down the road from its ‘inspirations’.\n\nRecording Engineer Eddie Kramer describes the recording of ‘Whole Lotta Love’ and ‘happy accidents:\n\n“That ‘Whole Lotta Love’ as a result of us being together…Jimmy’s the Director, he had all the ideas, the stuff about how he thought it could sound, but then once the two of us got into the studio, it was a very creative conglomeration of two guys working together at the console and very exciting to work with him. And we get to the song and the mixing process, and it gets to this point in the song where you hear Robert go ‘Woman’ and I put a little bit of reverb on and I’m hearing another voice and we look at each other and say ‘What the hell?’ and say ‘Oh’ – There’s only eight tracks by the way – Track eight was the main voice and track seven was another take – I couldn’t get rid of it, it was one of those old tube boards with rotary parts, rotary volume controls for those of you who don’t know and, erm, couldn’t get rid of it. Literally as I was going to reach for the ‘echo send’, Jimmy was reaching for it at the same time – we were both laughing because we were both going to exactly the same thing and we just soaked it in reverb, and that’s why you hear this ‘woman’ and then you hear another one, because I couldn’t get rid of it…and what’s the message? The message is ‘leave the damn mistakes in’! We’re in the Pro-Tools world where you take every sneeze and every breath away from all the good stuff…Leave the bloody hair on! That’s my message to all of yous out there…It’s real music, mistakes are made and sometimes you turn a mistake into something really positive. That’s what life is all about, isn’t it?” [8.]\n\nThe main theme to the song would later become the theme for British TV programme ‘Top Of The Pops’, when the 1970 instrumental recording by CCS (Collective Consciousness Society) was selected. CCS were a group of session musicians assembled by UK blues guru Alexis Korner and are best known for that recording, which was used by the show for most of the seventies. [6.] Against the wishes of the band and Manager Peter Grant, an edited version of ‘Whole Lotta Love’ was released as a single, partly in response to radio stations creating their own edits because they felt the original recording was too long for airplay.\n\nIn Richie Yorke’s biography, Robert Plant says “Wherever it came from, it was all about that riff. Any tribute which flows in must go to Jimmy and his riffs. They were mostly in the key of E and you could really play around with them. Since I’ve been playing guitar myself, I’ve realised more than ever that the whole thing, the whole band really, came straight from the blues. Everything.” [3.]\n\nZep had covered two of Willie Dixon’s songs on their first album, ‘I Can’t Quit You Baby’ (first recorded by Otis Rush in 1956) and ‘You Shook Me’. Dixon’s 1970 album ‘I Am The Blues’ includes both of these, along with versions of Howlin’ Wolf’s ‘Back Door Man’, which The Doors covered on their first album and ‘Spoonful’ a live staple of ‘supergroup’ Cream, the power trio of Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton.\n\nPage saw second track ‘What Is And What Should Never Be’ as “a change for the band. We wanted to try some new ideas on the second album and this is one of the first things we came up with. We put a lot of thought into it and I like it a lot. In the chorus you can hear in Robert’s lyrics a serious writer starting to emerge.” [3.]\n\nJohn Paul Jones was obviously inspired by the song to adapt his playing: “The role of a bassist is hard to define…you have a harmonic role, picking and timing notes. You’ll suggest a melodic or a harmonic pattern, but I seem to be changing anyway towards more of a lead style. The Alembic bass guitar is doing it: I play differently on it.” [3.]\n\nThere is a lot packed into the four minutes and forty-four seconds of this piece – From a nostalgic, soft beginning to the rock eruption of the chorus and the later call and response between the vocals and riffing at the end, it’s definitely up there as one of the best recordings by the band.\n\nHowlin’ Wolf’s ‘Killing Floor’ is the basis of ‘The Lemon Song’, lyrically and musically. Plant has called it “the most basic blues thing on the album…We cut it live in the studio with just a guitar overdub on the bridge – I think it was a Fender or Rickenbacker electric twelve-string.” [3.]\n\nFull of suggestion and double-entendre, Plant croons “the way you squeeze my lemon, I’m gonna fall right out of bed”, not leaving much to the imagination and giving the song it’s new title.\n\nPage describes how ‘Thank You’ was key to Plant leading the way as band wordsmith:\n\n“I never felt at all confident with my own lyrics,” Page admitted, “and I was hoping that Robert could do all that side, which I think developed from this track. We did very little overdubbing on this number.” [3.]\n\nThis poignant love song closes Side One beautifully, John Paul Jones keyboard providing the perfect backdrop.\n\nIn heavy contrast, Jimmy Page blasts off Side Two with the forceful guitar riff opening ‘Heartbreaker’. Cut off with Plant’s ‘heart’ vocal stab, there is only a brief pause before the a cappella ‘with a purple umb-e-rella and a fifty cent hat’ starts off ‘Livin’ Lovin’ Maid’, a song in the key of A and powered by a riff which has the same first two notes as that of ‘Heartbreaker’. “It’s all about a degenerate old woman desperately trying to be young again” says Page. [3.]\n\n‘Ramble On’ is an original written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, recorded at Juggy Sound Studio, New York City, duing Led Zeppelin’s second tour of the USA. The verses have a folky, acoustic feel, with Bonham’s percussion adding a world-music dimension, and the lyrics are inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic fantasy novel ‘Lord Of The Rings’, bringing an other-worldly aspect to the song. Page describes it as “a very nice track but it’s very hard to do on stage – the acoustic guitar over the electric guitar. I know it’s Robert’s favourite on the entire album.” [3.] “Yeah” agrees Plant, “That song was my baby and I hoped everybody would suss it out and realise this is where I want to go.” [3.]\n\nPlant has confirmed that penultimate track ‘Moby Dick’ was written especially to feature John Bonham’s drumming, the track growing on stage to include a long drum solo by the big man, as evidenced in the recording for the film ‘The Song Remains The Same’, which takes up half a side of the soundtrack LP. Again it’s a Page riff which drives the instrumental, following a twelve-bar blues pattern.\n\n‘Bring It On Home’ draws heavily on the Sonny Boy Williamson original, which features an extremely soulful vocal and tasteful, effective harmonica playing by the bluesman. Zeppelin bring it both down and up in the two sections of their version.\n\nGraphic illustrator David Juniper’s iconic Led Zeppelin II album cover design ‘was based on an old photograph of the Jasta Division of the German air force during World War.The German air force used Zeppelins as airships for bombing military and civilian targets during the war. After the picture was tinted, the faces of the four members of the band were airbrushed on from a 1969 publicity photograph, as well as the faces of band manager Peter Grant and tour manager Richard Cole. The woman in the picture is Glynis Johns, the mother from Mary Poppins. Her presence in the photo is an obvious play on the name of recording engineer Glyn Johns. The other face added was that of bluesman Blind Willie Johnson. The cover also pictured the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background, which gave the album its nickname “Brown Bomber”. [10.]\n\nLed Zeppelin II soared up the US chart, despite being up against some stiff competition. It entered the chart at number 199 on release, then shot up 184 places to 15 the following week. After subsequently stalling for a week at number 2, it finally knocked The Beatles ‘Abbey Road’ off the number 1 spot, entering the new decade on top.\n\nIn a TV interview from 1970, Led Zeppelin were portrayed as the successors to The Beatles, having just been voted top band above the Fab Four in a music magazine poll. Robert Plant and John Bonham appeared, long-haired , bearded, looking relaxed and smoking fags, the latter of which dates the footage!\n\nInterviewer: “The Beatles were around for eight years…Do you think you’ll be able to last as long as eight years, do you think you’ll be inventive enough? You know the old thing about being able to whistle the tune, being able to hum the tune as you go away. I don’t think I could hum any of your stuff!”\n\nIt’s quite a provocative lead from the interviewer but John Bonham is cool and doesn’t rise to the bait…\n\nBonham: “No but I think it’s changing, that’s the main thing you see. I think that’s why the awards have changed because the kids are changing for a start, and so is the music changing and I think, well, there’s already a single out of ‘Whole Lotta Love’, an orchestra playing it, which is quite interesting really – a flute plays what the lead vocal would do.”\n\nInterviewer: “So you’re saying that your fans don’t necessarily want to whistle the tunes, to hum the tune, that it’s much more sophisticated than my generation?”\n\nBonham: “Well, no, not in that sense. I think that these days, that, let’s say the public, not just say ‘the kids’ because we’ve had all sorts of people at concerts, you know, I think they’re coming to listen to what you’re playing and not just too look at you and see what you are. I remember, and this is going back a few years, I remember when I first went to see The Beatles, because we’ve mentioned them a few times, it was to look at them, you know, it wasn’t…you didn’t really bother what you were listening to, and today, it’s not what you are it’s what you’re playing.”\n\nInterviewer: “This is interesting. We’ve heard that the personality cult is dead but I’m still going to put one of those kinds of questions. I wouldn’t know whether you’re a millionaire or not but you must be quite rich now. What’s it like having money?”\n\nPlant: “Well, John’s laughing, because I think I must spend a good five pounds a week on getting goat and chicken food…”\n\nInterviewer: “This is keeping your goats in Kidderminster?”\n\nPlant: “Erm, yeah…”\n\nInterviewer: “Having paid for the goat bill, you’ve got a little bit left over, have you?”\n\nPlant: “A few shillings and groats…I think it all boils down to…in our position, we’ve all spent years on the road sort of playing in little church halls and being beaten up and bricks thrown through the van windows and everything, and to have money at last is just another figure in my mind of mass acceptance which is what we all work for. I mean, everybody, however much they want to deny the fact, really wants in the end to be accepted by the majority of people for being either a talent or a commodity, you know. I think that we’ve reached that stage now and it’s left to us to keep coming up with something good so we’ll be at the Melody Maker poll winners awards blah blah…”\n\nInterviewer: “For a few years…”\n\nPlant: “Yeah from now on…”\n\nInterviewer: “Robert Plant and John Bonham, thank you very much and good luck with your forty thousand audience in Madison Square Garden in New York!”\n\nPlant/Bonham: “Thank you” (takes draw of cigarette) [9.]\n\nAnd keep coming up with ‘something good’ they did for more than eight years hence, recording ‘Led Zeppelin III’, ‘Led Zeppelin IV’ (otherwise known as ‘No Title – Four Symbols’, ‘Houses Of The Holy’, live concert/biographical/fantasy film ‘The Song Remains The Same’, double album ‘Physical Graffiti’ and ‘Presence’ between 1970 and 1976 – all Led Zeppelin masterpieces. The band incorporated many influences into their recordings over these years, including folk, fifties rock’n’roll, funk, reggae and ‘world music’, as well as the original blues roots and, of course, development of their own hallmark rock sound. 1979 brought ‘In Through The Out Door’, as it turned out, the final album recorded by the original band – in my opinion, a very mixed affair, and allegedly due to the intermittent involvement of Jimmy Page at the time, who was having problems with heroin addiction. On 25th September 1980, John Bonham died suddenly after a day of heavy drinking near his home in Worcestershire, England. After the session, Bonham went with the rest of the band to the home of Jimmy Page near Windsor – He was found dead in bed by Zeppelin’s Production Manager Ben Lefevre. Led Zeppelin disbanded less than three months later, unable to continue without their friend and powerhouse drummer.\n\nVarious Zeppelin recordings were to be released in the coming years, under the watchful eye of Jimmy Page, including ‘Coda’, an album of studio outtakes, ‘BBC Sessions’, live performances from the BBC archive and ‘How The West Was One’, archive live performances from the USA. The full studio catalogue was remastered by Page, featuring on ‘Box Set’ and ‘Box Set 2’. Archive film of live material was collected and released as ‘DVD’.\n\nRobert Plant has gone on to forge a successful solo career, as a rock artist and latterly in roots music, collaborating with the likes of Alison Krauss. John Paul Jones continued his work as session player and arranger. Jimmy Page wrote and recorded solo material, notably for film soundtracks, as well as collaborating with other well-known rock singers like David Coverdale.\n\nIn 1994, Page and Plant came together to record the album ‘No Quarter’, featuring members of Plant’s solo band and a number of African musicians, which contributed to the ‘world music’ feel of the project. The pair toured to promote the release and followed it up with another studio album ‘Walking Into Clarksdale’, which was more rock and blues oriented.\n\nIn 2007, the band teamed up with Jason Bonham, John’s son, to play a ‘reunion’ concert at the O2 Arena in London, recorded and released as ‘Celebration Day’.\n\n‘Led Zeppelin II’ tracklisting:\n\nWhole Lotta Love\n\nWhat Is And What Should Never Be\n\nThe Lemon Song\n\nThank You\n\nHeartbreaker\n\nLivin’ Lovin’ Maid\n\nRamble On\n\nMoby Dick\n\nBring It On Home\n\n‘Led Zeppelin II’\n\nOriginally released: 1969\n\nLabel: Atlantic\n\nRecorded at: Olympic Studios, London, England; Mirror Sound, Los Angeles, USA; Morgan Studios, London, England; A&R Studios, New York, USA; Juggy Sound Studio, New York, USA; Atlantic Studios, New York, USA\n\nProduced by: Jimmy Page\n\nEngineers: Eddie Kramer, George Chkiantz, Andrew Johns, Chris Huston\n\nArtwork: David Juniper\n\nPersonnel:\n\nRobert Plant – vocals\n\nJimmy Page – guitars\n\nJohn Paul Jones – bass\n\nJohn Bonham – drums\n\nReferences, quotes and photographs:\n\n1.

Leitch, D.(2005) ‘The Hurdy Gurdy Man’. London: Random House.\n\nMy longtime friend Chris D was my gig-going buddy. We went to a lot of concerts together, mostly rock and metal as those genres were where our tastes overlapped the most. Back in the ‘90s, after meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, we saw space rockers Hawkwind (one of Chris’ favourites) several times, as well as Ozzy Osbourne, AC/DC, Big Star main man Alex Chilton and went on a trip to Birmingham to see the mighty Black Sabbath’s homecoming reunion gig. All through the millennium years, we met up regularly to take in the delights of the live music circuit, catching indie luminaries The Strokes, Gomez, Primal Scream and The Dandy Warhols, along with rockers such as stoners Monster Magnet, Mark Lanegan and Queens Of The Stone Age, and metalheads Rammstein, Mastodon Megadeth and Motorhead (Chris’ number one). All in all, over thirty live gigs and lots of good times. By this point, you’re probably wondering what all this has to do with Lamb Of God…I don’t recall exactly when I first heard the biblically-monikered metal band from Virginia, but it was probably late 2006, after the release of their stunning album ‘Sacrament’ – the title of this another religious reference with a cover which displays a chalice and what appear to be communion wafers. Lamb Of God have been labelled as ‘groove metal’, which may lull you into a false sense of security, as their music hits you hard and fast! In any case, I was impressed by their powerful recordings and virtuoso musicianship, frontman Randy Blythe’s screaming vocal topping it all to great effect. Randy invites the listener to ‘take hold of my hand, for you are no longer alone…walk with me in hell’ on the opening track on ‘Sacrament’, and I was quite prepared to join him…The opportunity presented itself when the band announced that they would be playing below-ground Old Town venue the Liquid Room in Edinburgh on Wednesday 6th June 2007. I texted Chris to ask him if he fancied going but his reply, sent the day before, was:\n\n2007-06-05\n\n13:58:44\n\nSender: Chris 7964169139\n\nMessage:\n\n“Wood o done but mum just been admitted 2 hospital”\n\nTwo days later, on Friday 8th June 2007, Chris was found dead, hanged in his home in East Craigs, north-west Edinburgh, a tragedy that I will never fully recover from…\n\nI went to the Lamb Of God gig on my own, blissfully unaware of what was to come to pass that week, and was blown away. To see a band on their way up in a ‘small-ass club’, as Randy described it on the night, was indeed a privilege, and to watch them showcase ‘Sacrament’, powering through seven of the eleven songs on that album, even more so. Veterans of a headline tour across the USA in the first part of that year with west coast metallers Machine Head, Lamb Of God hit the UK, playing the Download Festival at Castle Donington in Derbyshire the Sunday after the Edinburgh performance, a huge contrast to this small, ‘black box’ venue in the bowels of the historic Victoria Street in the centre of Scotland’s capital city.\n\nI am not alone in my love of ‘Sacrament’ – It was the top-selling heavy metal album of 2006. The two-disc package contains the album CD along with a 90-minute DVD called ‘Making Of Sacrament’ which “documents the past year in the life of Lamb Of God. Encompasses the writing and recording process. From guitar riff to completed song in the studio, to making the ‘Redneck’ video and downtime with each band member.” [2.]\n\nOriginally ‘Burn The Priest’, the band’s self-titled debut album is absolutely brutal and uncompromising. Heralding the new millennium, ‘New American Gospel’, the first album to be released under the ‘Lamb Of God’ name, has all the elements of the band’s evolving sound but the vocals are screams and barks, with no apparent lyrics or hooks, which to me makes it very difficult to get into, and I just never did. Biblical study reveals the origin of the second name adopted: ‘This is a title specially bestowed upon our Lord by John the Baptist (John 1:29-36), “Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!” [3.] Was it the intention of the band to take away the sins of the world? Unlikely, but there is an element of ‘cleansing’ and ‘purging’ in the lyrics…These first recordings lean more to different metal subgenres (maybe ‘black metal’?) than later material. By contrast ‘As The Palaces Burn’ and ‘Ashes Of The Wake’ to me define what ‘Lamb Of God’ are all about. Released in 2003 and 2004, these albums are well-respected by fans – They sound raw, fresh and exciting (and sometimes catchy!) whilst retaining the darkness, as well as expressing the angst and torment that are common threads. The song titles are excellent too: ‘Ruin’, ‘As The Palaces Burn’, ‘A Devil In God’s Country’, ‘Now You’ve Got Something To Die For’, ‘Omerta’…So, a great legacy was already established by the band before ‘Sacrament’, a musical progression and definition of a sound that is unmistakeably ‘Lamb Of God’. ‘Sacrament’ takes this to the next level, in terms of writing, playing, production and graphics – The chemistry of the whole package comes together and the result is a dark metal classic!\n\nThe DVD ‘The Making Of Sacrament’ which accompanies the CD is an eye-opener and is fascinating watching, documenting the writing process and how the other-wordly recordings came together in such seemingly ‘down-to-earth’ circumstances – Chris Adler cycling back and forth from the studio daily on a black mountain bike, the commute exhausting but uphill parts keeping his muscles toned for those double-kick drum parts. Mark Morton and Willie Adler traded ideas for riffs and songs, feeding off each other in a kind of metal version of the Vulcan mind meld, “figuring out overdubs’ and such in advance so that ‘when we get in the studio, we’d just be knockin’ it out”, as Adler says…”Everyone has an input, it’s very democratic in a lot of ways” says Mark Morton. John Campbell explains one of the differences between the two guitarists: “Willie’s more of a good-time guitar player, where he’d find something that just sounds awesome, leads to a good time, so he’ll just nail it…Mark’s riffs are a lot more blues-oriented…” Chris Adler describes Adler’s contribution as “really unconventional…I would say the same for Mark…It’s certainly a new take on what’s been done before”…“I would say that Mark, he’s the soul, he’s the swing, he’s the dirt, the grit” opines Randy Blythe…Mark says he tries to achieve the point where “after you’ve heard the song four or five times, you can hum it back to me.” About the singer, Chris Adler reports that “Randy’s always been late to the process, and I think purposefully to some extent…I think his forte is being a live rock’n’roll singer…” Talking about the practice base, Blythe says “It’s pretty useless for me to be there! I don’t have so much to do with the musicality part of it – I’m not a musician, I’m a screamer (smiles). When those guys write music, they bounce stuff off each other, constantly.” Chris Adler misses the singer’s input: “I really wish Randy was here, now, from day one…” Blythe admits “I sit at home with my earphones, in Randyworld…” Chris Adler says that once a song is developed, “It is what it is, then what kind of message do we put behind it? And that’s the way we’ve always worked, so we’ll just keep goin’ but I’d prefer if he’d come around a little more often, just to hear what his band’s up to.” Although, watching Randy overdub vocals is exhilarating, encouraged by the producer at one point to deliver ‘halfway between your pig squeal and a note’!! [6.]\n\nThe opening of ‘Sacrament’ is majestic – a slow groove, precise riff patterns painted over uplifting changes and an ethereal vocal, before kicking into the main assault, as Randy delivers the gospel:\n\n“Pray for blood\n\nPray for the cleansing\n\nPray for the flood\n\nPray for this wide awake nightmare” [2.]\n\n‘Welcome the darkness’ indeed! And then it gets even more intense as Randy invites you to:\n\n“Take hold of my hand\n\nFor you are no longer alone\n\nWalk with me i"
