The band's line-up includes founder and bandleader Josh Homme (lead vocals, guitar, piano), alongside longtime members Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and recent addition Jon Theodore (drums, percussion).\n\nFormed after the dissolution of Homme's previous band Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy rock music. Their sound has since evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences, including working with a wide range of collaborators over the years such as Chris Goss (Masters of Reality), Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Across The River), Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees), Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters), Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), Elton John and Trent Reznor among other musicians spanning a wide range of genres.\n\nSince their inception the band has released seven studio albums to date with at least one being certified Gold by the RIAA and has attained a great deal of mainstream success among bands in the stoner/desert rock scenes, performing all over the world.\n\nThe name \"Queens of the Stone Age\" came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer Chris Goss. Homme said of the name: \"Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age's girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone's happy and it's more of a party. Kings of the Stone Age is too lopsided.\"[1]\n\nHistory[]\n\nFormation and Self-Titled Debut (1996 – 1999)[]\n\nAfter the breakup of his previous band Kyuss in 1995, Josh Homme briefly joined Screaming Trees as a touring guitarist,[2] before deciding to form a new band known as Gamma Ray. In 1996 they released the eponymous Gamma Ray EP, featuring \"Born to Hula\" and \"If Only Everything\" (which would later appear on their self-titled debut as 'If Only'). The EP featured Matt Cameron of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, Van Conner from Screaming Trees, and percussionist Victor Indrizzo.[3]\n\nGamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German power metal band Gamma Ray threatened to sue. The band would change their name to Queens of the Stone Age. The first release under this new moniker was the song \"18 A.D.,\" released on the compilation album Burn One Up! Music for Stoners which featured members of the Dutch stoner rock band Beaver. The band's first live appearance was on 20 November 1997 at OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington, with Cameron on drums, Mike Johnson (Dinosaur Jr.) on bass and John McBain (Monster Magnet) on guitar.[4] In December that year, the band released a split EP, Kyuss/Queens of The Stone Age, which featured three tracks from the Gamma Ray sessions as well as the last three recorded Kyuss tracks circa 1995 prior to their breakup.[5] Alfredo Hernández would join the band in early 1998, his first show with the band on 28 February 1998 at The OK Hotel.\n\nMcBain would leave the band soon after,[6] just before recording sessions would begin on a debut album that April. Nick Oliveri would join on bass and Dave Catching would join as a second guitarist, comprising the band lineup entirely of former Kyuss members and crew. The first show with this lineup would be on 24 June 1998.[7] Short tours of North America and Europe would follow, performing with the likes of Fatso Jetson, Goatsnake, Acid King and Fu Manchu among others.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age released their self-titled debut on 22 September 1998 on Loosegroove Records, and on vinyl by Man's Ruin Records. Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme's alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), Alfredo Hernández on the drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.[8]\n\nQueens would tour more extensively throughout 1999, with Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Across The River) filling in as a second guitarist for several dates. From this point forward, the band's line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernández had left the group to play in other bands.[9]\n\nRated R (2000 – 2001)[]\n\nOn 6 June 2000, Rated R would see release, featuring a myriad of musicians familiar with Homme and Oliveri's work and \"crew\" of sorts: among others, drummers Nick Lucero and Gene Trautmann, guitarists Dave Catching, Brendon McNichol, and Chris Goss contributed, and even Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford, recording next door, stepped in for a guest spot on Feel Good Hit of the Summer.\"[10] The album garnered positive reviews and received a lot more attention than their debut, despite the fact that the lyrics to \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" were deemed by mega-retailer Wal-Mart to promote drug use, almost causing the record to get pulled from store shelves.[11] The success of the record also earned the band notable opening slots with The Smashing Pumpkins, Ween, Foo Fighters, Hole, and a place at Ozzfest 2000.It was during this time that Homme stated:\n\n“ \"There's a robotic element to our albums, like the repetition of riffs. We also wanted to do a record that had a lot of dynamic range. We wanted to set it up in this band so we could play anything. We don't want to get roped in by our own music. If anyone has a good song (regardless of style) we should be able to play it.\" ”\n\n— Homme, interview with thefade.net\n\nDuring the 2001 Rock in Rio show, bassist Nick Oliveri was arrested after performing on stage naked, with only his bass guitar covering his genitals. Oliveri apologized to officials, saying that he did not know it was a crime in Brazil.[12] Following his work on Rated R, former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan joined the band as a full-time member, a position he held until early 2005.[13]\n\nTowards the end of the Rated R tour, the band's performance at the 2001 Rock am Ring festival in Germany was, according to Homme, \"the worst show we've ever played and it was in front of 40,000 people.\"[14] The band decided to tattoo themselves with the starting time of the performance, \"Freitag 4:15.\" As Oliveri explained:\n\n“ \"Me, Mark [Lanegan], Josh [Homme] and Hutch, our soundman, have the same tattoo, it's from Rock am Ring festival. The time we had to play was 4.15 in the afternoon and it was just a terrible show. It sucked, it was horrible. That's why I tattooed it on my ribs, where it would hurt, so I'd never forget.\" ”\n\n— Nick Oliveri, interview with Daredevil Magazine (2005)\n\nSongs for the Deaf, mainstream exposure and Oliveri's departure (2001 – 2004)[]\n\nDave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana, Them Crooked Vultures) joined in late 2001 to record drums for their third album. Songs for the Deaf was released circa 27 August 2002, again featuring Lanegan, along with former A Perfect Circle guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen to the touring line-up following the album's release. Also featured on Songs for the Deaf for the final track \"Mosquito Song\" were former A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin on viola and piano, and Dean Ween on guitar.[15] The band would also be nominated for \"Best Metal Act\" at the 2001 NME Awards.[16]\n\n“ This record was supposed to sound bizarre—like lightning in a bottle. We also were extremely fucked up. It even sounds that way to me, like a crazy person. The radio interludes are supposed to be like the drive from L.A. to Joshua Tree, a drive that makes you feel like you’re letting go—more David Lynch with every mile. ”\n\n— Homme, interview with jr.com\n\nSongs for the Deaf was a critical hit and was certified Gold in 2003, with sales of over 900,000.[17] The singles \"No One Knows\" and \"Go with the Flow\" became hits on radio and MTV, with the former just outside the Billboard Top 100. \"No One Knows\" and \"Go with the Flow\" were also featured on the first iterations of the popular video games Guitar Hero and Rock Band, along with garnering Grammy nominations. Extensive touring throughout the world would follow including participation in the 2003 edition of Big Day Out.[18]\n\nThe Songs for the Deaf tour culminated in a string of headline dates in Australia in January 2004. Grohl returned to his other projects and was replaced on the European leg of the tour by drummer Joey Castillo (Danzig, Goatsnake, Nine Inch Nails), who joined the band full-time. After the tour, Homme fired Oliveri, as he was convinced that Oliveri had been physically abusive to his girlfriend: \"A couple years ago, I spoke to Nick about a rumor I heard. I said, 'If I ever find out that this is true, I can't know you, man.'\"[19] Homme considered breaking up the band after firing Oliveri, but found a new determination to continue.[20] Oliveri countered in the press that the band had been \"poisoned by hunger for power\" and that without him, they were \"Queens Lite.\" He later softened his opinion and said: \"My relationship with Josh is good. The new Queens record kicks ass.\"[21] The two reportedly are still friends and for a time Oliveri was interested in rejoining the band.[22] Oliveri would later guest contribute to a Queens of the Stone Age for the first time in nine years, contributing backing vocals to the band's sixth album and performing as a guest for the band on Halloween 2014.[23]\n\nLullabies to Paralyze (2004 – 2006)[]\n\nIn late 2004, Homme, along with Eleven multi-instrumentalist Alain Johannes and remaining band members Van Leeuwen and Castillo recorded the Queens' fourth studio album, Lullabies to Paralyze, a title taken from a lyric in \"Mosquito Song\" from their previous album. The album featured guests including ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons. Despite Lanegan reportedly turning down an invitation to remain with the band, he recorded vocals on new tracks (notably the solo vocalist on the opening track \"This Lullaby\") and appeared on the supporting tour as scheduling as his health permitted.\n\nLullabies to Paralyze was leaked onto the internet in February 2005 and was aired by Triple J radio in Australia on 3 March 2005 as an unsubstantiated \"World Premiere\". It was then officially released on 22 March 2005 in the US, debuting in the number 5 slot on the Billboard Music Chart, the greatest debut of any Queens record until 2013.[24]\n\nOn 14 May 2005 the group were musical guests on Saturday Night Live, hosted by Will Ferrell. One of Ferrell's popular Saturday Night Live characters, fictional Blue Öyster Cult cowbellist Gene Frenkle, made a re-appearance on the show, playing with the Queens on their first song of the night, \"Little Sister\". Frenkle played the song's wood block part using a cowbell along with the band.\n\nOn 22 November 2005, Queens of the Stone Age released a live album/DVD set, Over the Years and Through the Woods, featuring a live concert filmed in London, England, and bonus features which included rare videos of songs from 1998 to 2005. In 2005, the group supported Nine Inch Nails on their North American tour of With Teeth along with Autolux (for the first half of the tour) and Death from Above 1979 (for the second). NIN's guitarist Aaron North appeared as an onstage guest with the Queens for the songs \"Born to Hula,\" \"Regular John,\" \"Avon,\" \"Monsters in the Parasol\" and \"Long, Slow Goodbye\" at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles on 19 and 20 December 2005.\n\nAnother onstage guest for the December 20 performance was Homme's former Kyuss bandmate John Garcia, the first time that Homme and Garcia had played together since 1995. As a special encore they performed three Kyuss songs: \"Thumb,\" \"Hurricane\" and \"Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop.[25]\n\nEra Vulgaris and death of Natasha Shneider (2007 – 2008)[]\n\nOn Valentine's Day 2007, the band's official website announced the new album would be titled Era Vulgaris, and would be released on 12 June 2007.[26] Later in February, teaser videos surfaced showing Homme, Castillo, Van Leeuwen and Johannes in studio.[27][28] Several sites reported that the album would include many guest vocalists, including Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails, Julian Casablancas from The Strokes, Mark Lanegan, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top,[29] and deceased humorist Erma Bombeck.[30] Death from Above 1979 bassist Jesse F. Keeler had been expected to play bass on the studio recording of the album, but not to tour;[31] however, due to schedule conflicts, he stated he would not be appearing on the album.\n\nEra Vulgaris was completed in early April 2007[32] and released 12 June, 2007 in the US.[33] The tracks \"Sick, Sick, Sick\" and \"3's & 7's\" were released as singles in early June.[34] Homme has described the record as \"dark, hard, and electrical, sort of like a construction worker.\"[35] When asked about the vocals on the record, specifically the different style of singing that Homme used, he replied:\n\n“ I wanted to try some shit that was downright embarrassing at first. This record is a grower, not about what isn’t there, but what is. ”\n\n— Josh Homme, interview with jr.com, 2007\n\nBassist Michael Shuman (Wires On Fire, Jubilee, Mini Mansions) and keyboardist Dean Fertita (Hello=Fire, The Waxwings, The Dead Weather) took over touring duties from Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider, respectively.[36][37] In July 2007, Van Leeuwen stated the band had written new material, \"still in its infancy\"[38] which Homme later suggested might be released as an EP.[39] Following a subsequent interview with Homme, The Globe and Mail reported that the EP \"could contain as many as 10 B-sides recorded during the Era Vulgaris sessions.\"[40] It was later reported that the EP would not be released due to the record label's unwillingness to put out another QOTSA release at that time.[41]\n\nThe band began a North American Tour in 2007 which they named the Duluth Tour because they were going to many small towns and cities they had never played before, such as Duluth, Minnesota.[42] The tour was extended to other areas, such as the United Kingdom, where the band played more shows than on any of their previous UK tours. The band toured in Australia in late March to early April 2008, on the V festival tour, including a string of side shows. Throughout the beginning of May 2008, the band completed the Canadian leg of its touring.[43] In November 2007, Queens of the Stone Age performed a semi-acoustic set in an underground salt mine in Germany, performing a selection of hits, rarities, covers and an unreleased song named \"Cathedral City.\"[44]\n\nOn 2 July 2008 Queens of the Stone Age's former keyboardist Natasha Shneider died of lung cancer at the age of 52. The news broke with a message posted on the MySpace page of the band Sweethead, of which Natasha's close friend and former bandmate Troy Van Leeuwen is a member. The official website was updated with a memorial message by Homme replacing the normal front page. The band performed a concert in celebration of Natasha Shneider's life at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles on 16 August 2008. They were joined on stage by Shneider's husband Alain Johannes, Jack Black and Kyle Gass, Matt Cameron, Brody Dalle, Jesse Hughes, Chris Goss and PJ Harvey, playing a variety of QOTSA and non-QOTSA songs, including covers of songs from bands such as Cream and The Doors. Tenacious D and PJ Harvey also performed acoustic sets at the show. Proceeds from the concert went to defray the costs associated with Natasha’s illness.\n\nOn 22 and 23 August 2008 Queens of the Stone Age performed the last shows of their Era Vulgaris tour at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK, and Josh Homme announced in an interview with the BBC and during the show that he would be returning to the studio to work on the next album.[45]\n\nHomme's health issues, debut re-release and promotional tour (2009 – 2011)[]\n\nDuring 2009 and 2010, band members worked on side projects during the down time. Troy Van Leeuwen started up a new band, Sweethead. Joey Castillo played for Eagles of Death Metal on their Heart On tour. Bassist Michael Shuman continued his work as drummer and vocalist with Mini Mansions, while Dean Fertita became the guitarist/keyboardist for Jack White's newest group, The Dead Weather. Josh Homme formed the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones.[46] After Them Crooked Vultures finished touring in June, the band toured and released a two-CD deluxe edition of Rated R on 3 August 2010. This edition featured the original CD along with six B-sides and live recordings from the band's Reading performance in 2000.\n\nIn 2010 Homme suffered from complications during a botched knee surgery, during which his heart stopped for a short time due to asphyxiation to which doctors had to use a defibrillato] to revive him. Following this, he was bedridden for four months and plunged into a deep depression, during which he considered giving up his music career altogether.[47] He elaborated on this experience further in an interview on Marc Maron's WTF with Marc Maron, explaining that he had contracted a MRSA infection which his immune system could not fight due to stress. Homme has since said that the experience contributed greatly to the writing and recording of ...Like Clockwork.[48]\n\nAfter Homme recovered, Queens of the Stone Age released a remastered version of their self-titled debut album in early 2011, and performed the album in its entirety in a promotional tour. The band performed on Conan on 14 April,[49] and later played at the Australian music festival Soundwave. Throughout the summer of 2011, the band appeared at various European festivals, including the Glastonbury Festival, in Somerset, UK. They also played at Pearl Jam's 20th Anniversary Festival at Alpine Valley in East Troy, WI on 3 and 4 September, 2011, which would be their last with drummer Joey Castillo.\n\n...Like Clockwork (2011 – 2014)[]\n\nPlans to record a follow-up to Era Vulgaris had been mentioned since 2008,[50] but recording would not begin until August 2012.[51] In March 2011, Homme stated, \"Doing the rehearsals for the first record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are coming home!\"[52] According to Homme, the album would be finished by the end of 2012. He explained to BBC Radio 1, \"We're going to take our one last break that we would get for a month, come back and do Glastonbury, then immediately jump in the studio. Our record will be done by the end of the year. We have enough songs.\"[53]\n\nIn November 2011, frequent collaborator Alain Johannes stated in regard to his studio work with the band: \"We had a late night with Queens of the Stone Age again. [...] Just putting in days, super top secret, but it’s going to be amazing. I’m really excited about it. [...] Once we start the process, it goes to completion. So I can’t say exactly when, but it’s a really good start.\"[54] On 20 August 2012, the band stated via a Facebook status update that they were \"recording\" their new album.[55]\n\nIn September 2012, it was revealed that Homme and producer Dave Sardy co-wrote and recorded a song entitled \"Nobody To Love,\" which is featured during the end credits of the film End of Watch.[56][57]\n\nIn November 2012 Homme informed BBC's Zane Lowe that Joey Castillo had left the band and that drums on the new album would be performed by Dave Grohl, who also performed on Songs for the Deaf.[58] Homme also confirmed with Lowe that the album would be released prior to their performance at the Download Festival in June 2013. In addition to Grohl, other former members contributing to the album include former bassists Nick Oliveri[59] and Johannes[[60] and vocalist Mark Lanegan.[61]\n\nA number of collaborations from different musicians were announced for ...Like Clockwork, including Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor,[62] Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears,[63] Brody Dalle and Elton John.[64]\n\nIn early 2013, Homme and fellow Queens contributors including Alain Johannes and Chris Goss recorded to the soundtrack of Dave Grohl's Sound City: Real to Reel. Goss, Johannes and Homme were on three tracks each. Josh's notably included a collaboration with Grohl and Trent Reznor called Mantra, and he was also featured in the film in an interview segment. Goss and Johannes were both featured members in the Sound City Players, playing Masters of Reality, Eleven, and The Desert Sessions songs, as well as their penned tunes from the soundtrack. Former Kyuss bassist Scott Reeder also contributed to the soundtrack.[65]\n\nIn March 2013, Queens of the Stone Age announced that the new album, entitled ...Like Clockwork, would be released that June on Matador Records.[66][67] A press release, issued by Matador at 9:00am EST on 26 March 2013, revealed further details of the album, including further guest appearances: Alex Turner of Arctic Monkeys and UNKLE's James Lavelle. In addition to Grohl's contribution, the record also features performances by former drummer Castillo, as well as tracks by new drummer Jon Theodore (The Mars Volta, One Day as a Lion).[68][69] Queens Of The Stone Age premiered a new song \"My God Is The Sun\" at Lollapalooza Brasil on 30 March 2013,[70] a performance in which Theodore made his live debut. The studio version of the song premiered on Lowe's BBC Radio 1 program on 8 April 2013.[71]\n\n...Like Clockwork was released on 3 June 2013 on Matador Records in the UK and on 4 June in the United States. Self-produced by the band, it is the first Queens of the Stone Age album to feature full contributions from bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist and guitarist Dean Fertita. The album debuted in the number one position in the US and is the first QOTSA album to achieve this ranking.[72] Following a performance by QOTSA at the Jay Z-owned Made In America Festival]in the summer of 2013, Homme made comments about the rap star during a radio interview with CBC Radio 2's Strombo Show. Homme explained that his band was frisked by the event's security team prior to the performance and referred to Jay Z's personal interaction with the band as a marketing stunt.[73]\n\nThe ...Like Clockwork tour culminated with a Halloween party at The Forum in Los Angeles, featuring guests such as The Kills, JD McPherson and Nick Oliveri's Uncontrollable.[74] The band's performance featured an appearance from Oliveri who played songs with them during the encore set, including songs such as \"Auto Pilot\" and \"Quick and to the Pointless\" which had not been performed in a decade.[75]\n\nVillains (2014 – 2018)[]\n\nIn January 2014, Homme told Rolling Stone magazine the band would start recording a new album when they finished their tour for ...Like Clockwork.[76] In June 2014, Homme performed a solo acoustic show at James Lavelle's Meltdown festival, featuring guest performances from Troy Van Leeuwen and Mark Lanegan. During this gig, Homme played a new song called \"Villains of Circumstance\" which was performed again at another acoustic set in 2016.[77] The band indicated in February 2015, when it was announced they are to play Rock in Rio 2015 in Rio de Janeiro in September, that they were about to record a new album.[78] Despite this, in March 2016, Michael Shuman revealed that the band were on a break.[79]\n\nDuring this period the members of the band worked on various other projects. Josh Homme and Dean Fertita contributed to Iggy Pop's 2016 album Post Pop Depression and subsequent tour, while Troy van Leeuwen joined the rock supergroup Gone Is Gone with plans to release an EP and a studio album.[80] In May 2016 Van Leeuwen announced plans to record Queens of the Stone Age's seventh studio album \"sometime this year.\"[81] In January 2017, Troy Sanders from Mastodon and Gone Is Gone said Queens of the Stone Age will release a new album later in the year.[82][83]\n\nQueens would also announce that they would be performing at the Fuji Rock Festival in July, their first performance in Japan since 2003. The band updated their social media accounts with a new logo and the words \"Coming Twentyfive\" on 6 April 2017, and announced a tour of Australia and New Zealand to begin in July.\n\nOn 14 June, Queens of the Stone Age announced their new album Villains which was released on 25 August 2017. The teaser trailer took the form of a comedy skit featuring the band performing a polygraph test with Liam Lynch and featured a snippet of the song \"Feet Don't Fail Me.\" The first single, \"The Way You Used to Do,\" was released the following day along with the announcement of a Villains World Tour.[84][85] The second advance single from the album, “The Evil Has Landed,” was released 10 August 2017.[86] The band was also announced as one of the headliners for Riot Fest that year as well.\n\nOn 24 October as part of the Villains tour, the band headlined Madison Square Garden for the first time, after opening for Nine Inch Nails there in 2005, and for Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2003. Homme said he was \"stoked\".[87] Three sets of free tickets to this show were hidden at three stations along the Q line of the New York City Subway.[88]\n\nOn 9 December 2017 during a performance at the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas show, Homme proceeded to kick a photographer's camera out of her hands, seemingly unprovoked. He also bladed himself, referred to the fans as \"retards\" and proceeded to encourage them to boo him as he gave middle fingers, and stated \"Fuck Muse!\" at the event's headliner.[89] The band would continue touring through 2018, finishing off the touring cycle for Villains with an Australian leg circa September 2018.[90]\n\nEighth Studio Album (2019 - Present)[]\n\nIn an interview with eonmusic in June 2019, Billy Gibbons announced that he has contributed to a new Queens of the Stone Age album that is set to be further announced by Homme later in the year. Gibbons also confirmed that Dave Grohl is involved in the recording sessions.[91] Gibbons was later confirmed to be a contributor to Volumes 11 & 12 by The Desert Sessions, their first release since 2004. Grohl denied the rumors, saying that he and Homme had only spent time together \"riding motorcycles and eating waffles.\"[92]\n\nIn October 2019, the band announced vinyl reissues of Rated R, Songs for the Deaf, Lullabies to Paralyze, and Era Vulgaris.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age would perform at The Imperial Ball on 18 January 2020 in Anaheim, California. Notably actor Johnny Depp would join the band for three songs of the band's nine song set, performing \"Make It With Chu\" and covers of \"Dancing With Myself\" by Generation X and \"Takin' Care of Business\" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive.[93]\n\nRecurring contributor Mark Lanegan would pass away on 22 February 2022 in his home in Killarney, Ireland, aged 57.[94][95]\n\nQueens of the Stone Age would be announced for several festival appearances in 2023. Rumors also began to surface of the album when a product listing appeared on the band's website titled In Times New Roman, including an album cover and tracklist. The listing has since been removed.[96]\n\nOn May 11, the album's first single \"Emotion Sickness\" was released, along with an official announcement of the album.[97] On May 31, the album's second single \"Carnavoyeur\" was released.[98] Along with prior announced festival dates, Queens of the Stone Age would announce their first tour in five years.[99] Also of note is along with the legal battle Homme went through in the years between releases, he would reveal he went through a cancer battle in 2022 but has since recovered.[100]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nStudio Albums[]\n\nQueens of the Stone Age (1998, Loosegroove / Roadrunner)\n\nRated R (2000, Interscope)\n\nSongs For The Deaf (2002, Interscope)\n\nLullabies to Paralyze (2005, Interscope / Rekords Rekords)\n\nEra Vulgaris (2007, Interscope / Rekords Rekords)\n\n...Like Clockwork (2013, Matador)\n\nVillains (2017, Matador)\n\nIn Times New Roman...
