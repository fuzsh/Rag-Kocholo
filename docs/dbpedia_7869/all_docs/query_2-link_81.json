        "text": "THE 2014 BJ AWARDS\n\n….no wait that doesn’t sound right…\n\nOf all the years in music 2014 was certainly one of them.\n\nHere’s my take on what went down.\n\nTHE HOW DOES A FAX MACHINE WORK AWARD?\n\n(the WTF award)\n\nThe Nominees Are:\n\nANDRE JOHNSON –\n\nThis dude is the ex-WU TANG CLAN affiliate who cut off his junk and then jumped from a second floor balcony whilst tweeking out of his mind on PCP. Good times. He has since – had his bits reattached via surgery,called the event “a blessing” and reportedly taken up a career in porn. Because of course he has.\n\nPHIL RUDD –\n\nThe AC/DC drummer was arrested in New Zealand in November and has reportedly been charged with several dirty deeds including – making threats to kill, assault and possession of marijuana & amphetamine. In response to the allegations he was reported to have said “this is completely incorrect and frankly insulting – I have never touched weed in my life!” At least someone in AC/DC was responsible for a hit lately.\n\n50 CENT –\n\nThe rapper threw one of the most embarrassingly inept opening pitches at a Major League game since the tradition of having the ceremonial first toss thrown by a celebrity began (and without doing any research into the matter whatsoever I am going to say that’s a long time) The pitch itself was pretty shameful (see link below) but the fact Fiddy openly blamed the poorness of his throw on a wrist issue caused by “excessive masturbation” is what takes this tale to the next level.\n\nBecause apparently being a compulsive wanker is less embarrassing than being shit at baseball.\n\nHere’s said pitch –\n\nTHE WINNER IS:\n\nIn an amazing act of both arrogance and laziness I am just going to cut and paste the text from an article I wrote about the 2014 winner at the time of it becoming “news” :\n\nTHE CURIOUS CASE OF KID ROCK AND THE GLASS DILDO.\n\nEver wondered what would happen if Kid Rock was subpoenaed to hand over a glass dildo by the lawyers in a case involving Insane Clown Posse?\n\nIf yes – then firstly, you are a very strange individual (however I feel like we could be good friends.) Secondly – you need wonder no more because Mr Rock is embroiled in that very scenario as we speak. And he is clearly very upset about his name being part of a lawsuit revolving around a former employee of Insane Clown Posse who worked for the “band” at their tastefully named ‘Psychopathic Records’ who is currently suing for sexual harassment.\n\nLong story short – amongst all the completely feasible accusations of misogyny & alleged disgraceful mistreatment of female employees a party in the suit is claiming the glass sexual device was eventually handed down to Kid Rock after being refused as a gift by the female claimant. As such the court has asked it be entered into evidence and has subpoenaed Kid to produce the offending, offensive phallus.\n\nAfter making his claims of innocence clear and becoming totally pissed off at having his name sullied in the murky courtroom proceedings Kid Rock wrote two rather brilliant and scathing letters. He sent them to the lawyers he is accusing of using these scandalous claims to further their fame and infamy, he then published them on his website so we can see the metaphorical backhander he served his stuffy suited targets.\n\nPersonally I think the letters linked below are the best thing Kid Rock has ever released.\n\nhttp://www.kidrock.com/?frontpage=true\n\nTHE MOST UNFORTUNATE COINCIDENCE INVOLVING A BAND NAME AND A GROUP OF EXTREMISTS AWARD.\n\n(it wasn’t offensive yesterday?)\n\nThe sole nominee and runaway winner is:\n\nISIS\n\nPost-metal maestros ISIS have been inactive for a couple of years now but their career lasted over 15 years and influenced countless acts along the way. Unfortunately for them the name they had used on innumerable pieces of art – albums, t-shirts, stickers etc became kind of taboo in a hurry. Despite being named after an Egyptian Goddess the band will most commonly be linked to the beheading-happy extremists who they incidentally crossed. And now I can’t wear my ISIS merch, thanks a lot terrorism.\n\nTHE WELL THAT WAS ‘MEH’ AWARD –\n\n(a bit of a letdown really)\n\nTHE WINNER IS :\n\nKILLER BE KILLED –\n\nThe pressure on so called “supergroups” can be a bit unfair sometimes, particularly when the affected act is clearly a side-project. But yet the self titled debut by this bunch (including members of Dillinger Escape Plan, Mastodon, Mars Volta and Max Bloody Cavalera) like so, so many before them, ended up slightly underwhelming. Personally I think this is mostly due to an apparent inability to play to their individual member’s strengths instead of their egos.\n\nHonourable Mention –\n\nCHEVELLE – La Gargola.\n\nThese guys just basically proved once and for all that they fall into a musical sub-category I call “Not Bad But You Really Only Need One, Or At Most Two, Albums By Them” (remind me to come up with a snappier name for that little sub-genre will you?)\n\nTHE WHY ARE YOU STILL A THING AWARD?\n\n(enough already)\n\nTHE WINNER IS –\n\nANY “TALENT” SHOW ON TELLY\n\nDoes a completely rigged “competition” where the winner is the one with the marketable sob-story or sex appeal (preferably with the all important “tween” demographic) who for their efforts “wins” a highly restrictive recording contract and life of regret – of which the highpoint will be the time they performed “Little Drummer Boy” with Marina Proir at Carols By Candlelight – really still get the masses attention? Apparently yes, sad on so many levels really\n\nWhilst I am at it –\n\nLILLY ALLEN –\n\nDidn’t you retire to marry your brother or something? Either way please piss off.\n\nWOLFMOTHER –\n\nI cannot possibly say it any better than Sensitive Stew’s review on Audiocracy:\n\nhttp://audiocracy.co/2014/03/29/wolfmother-new-crown/\n\nTHE BJ AWARD\n\n(best release of 2014)\n\nSo 2014 wasn’t the biggest year in music for me. Not as many bands I love put out albums and I kind of took my finger off the pulse a bit – my bad. In a year without a standout I was faced with a tough call to name the best – kind of like trying to pick your favourite of your 6 kids when they all are just a little disappointing and you really actually just like them more than really truly love them.\n\nThat said, there were some excellent new sounds in 2014 and here’s my faves:\n\nEVERY TIME I DIE – ‘From Parts Unknown’\n\n“Party-core” purveyors ETID have a well-earned rep as fine exponents of infectious, intense, complex, cerebral and downright fun music. But they took all those elements to another level for this effort. Produced by knob-twiddler de’jour (and alleged alien lifeform) Kurt Ballou – of Converge fame – the boys refined their sound and made their finest work yet. Plus they have one of the best dopelgangers in music with singer Keith Buckley looking freakishly like ‘Taco’ from ‘The League’\n\nROSETTA – ‘Flies To The Flame’\n\nOnly an EP but that is all it needed to be. Dense, crushing, brilliant. A bit of a return to their earlier harmonic laden sounds which lend it the uplifting swell it uses to great effect to add a weightlessness among the heaviness. The texture is all incompassing but stops you from suffocating just enough to allow to breath in the atmosphere it creates.\n\nLA DISPUTE – ‘Rooms Of The House’\n\nThe makers of the most incredibly verbose hardcore keep their poetic theme rolling on their latest epic work. Snappy yet layered musical textures that perfectly carry the words of one the most brilliant lyrists of the modern day. Not as immediate as their early stuff but still super smart and inspiring music.\n\nOther albums that grabbed my (admittedly limited) attention this year –\n\nFUGAZI – Demos, N.TELSA – Lux Manifesto, DIRGE – Hyperion, ABRAHAM/COILGUNS – Split EP\n\nBEST LIVE SHOW AWARD –\n\n(why is that guy screaming at all these people?)\n\nI have been spoiled in the last few years with some of the most amazing live music experiences of my life and as such 2014 was always going to struggle to replicate those moments, and frankly it did. I saw some excellent shows in 2014 but unfortunately cannot recall anything transcendent. Maybe this is age beginning to make me more even more grumpy and jaded, maybe I didn’t get out as much, or maybe it was just a very slightly down year. But enough first world whinging – here are the highlights of the year for me in live music:\n\nBRUCE SPRINGSTEEN –\n\nGot see The Boss with my mum, and he totally killed it. That was pretty bloody special. Rather than bore you with the details here you can follow this link to my review instead –\n\nhttp://audiocracy.co/2014/02/13/bruce-springsteen-perth-arena-8214/\n\nQUEENS OF THE STONE AGE / NINE INCH NAILS / BRODY DALLE –\n\nMan do I ever have a thing for Brody Dalle … like a legit “thing…anyway… this double headliner show was cool in concept and creation.\n\nHave a geez at my review if you wanna:\n\nhttp://audiocracy.co/2014/03/23/nine-inch-nailsqueens-of-the-stone-agebrody-dalle-perth-arena-113-2014/\n\nSOUNDWAVE FESTIVAL –\n\nSadly the last Perth will see whilst AJ Maddah has any say. I went to them all and loved them all. 2014 was sure no exception with Alice In Chains, Filter, Clutch, Down & the mighty Dillinger Escape Plan all putting on killer sets. The only downer being Rob Zombie’s set being cruelled by a of lack bass in the mix leaving it sounding tinny and tepid.\n\nBIG DAY OUT –\n\nAnother annual pilgrimage torn from underneath us in the west. I have been going since 1993 and am incredibly sad 2014 will be the last (again – as long as AJ is involved anyway) But it brought stand out sets from Primus, Vista Chino, Mudhoney topped by Deftones and mildly let down by a ‘meh’ performance by Pearl Jam.\n\nRIP BDO.\n\nTHE MARK OF CAIN –\n\nJust straight up awesome. No bullshit, no regard for the long term hearing of the crowd. Remain among the best live bands I have ever seen.\n\nLA DISPUTE –\n\nAgain brought a positive vibe to a thought provoking. yet toe tapping live experience.\n\nOther great shows were put on in 2014 by – Monster Magnet, sleepmakewaves, The Beautiful Girls & Caspian.\n\nIn a suspense building tactic (or something) – for my standout set of 2014 you will have to wait until my ‘Scene Stealer Award’\n\nTHE BEST DUDE GIG – THE JOSH HOMME AWARD\n\n(Man Of The Year – ie: it’s just a little man crush)\n\nIn a shocking twist the winner is…\n\nJOSH HOMME!\n\nI know – predictable, but he is Josh Homme.\n\nCase closed.\n\nBut then..\n\nJONAS NIDO\n\nBeing a little self indulgent here – but if you have read this far then you are used to that – but my (non-Josh Homme) man of the year goes to a dude who lives in Switzerland, plays in an awesome band called Coilguns, runs his own record label with an ethos and execution I greatly respect – and he gives great interview. He turned out to be my final interview contribution to the Audiocracy entity and he restored some of my faith in humanity a little just by being a charismatic combination of humility and hard work.\n\nIt went down just like in this clip:\n\nFor clarification check out my interview with him here:\n\nhttp://audiocracy.co/2014/08/30/interview-coilguns/\n\nCheck out his excellent artistic output here:\n\nhttp://coilguns.bandcamp.com/\n\nSCENE STEALER AWARD:\n\n(unexpected excellence)\n\nTHE WINNER IS –\n\nMENISCUS\n\nA group of us gig-going buddies travelled deep into the south (Mojo’s in Fremantle) to see post-rock legends Caspian in the flesh. They easily lived up to expectations and yet were also not even close to the best band of the night. That honour went to Sydney siders Meniscus who were straight up jawdropping. They put on a polished performance of dense and exciting instrumental soundscapes that gave me a mental erection, the musicianship was perfect – led by visually arresting guitarist Daniel Oreskovic who convulsed and writhed whilst playing intense, accessible and interesting layers of aural awesome and backed by a bedrock building rhythm section. They grabbed me immediately and didn’t let go until we were all spent. Best surprise of the year and a band who should be more renown than they currently are.\n\nHave a look/listen to what I am banging on about here. Go on, have a listen – it is really good.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqM9vFcQE0M\n\nSee – even Channel Seven cottoned on to the band and used the above track in an intro for Friday Night Footy:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V6MikuYUn0\n\nFORTHCOMING GOODNESS\n\n(Not an award – just a list of albums I am jacked for in 2015)\n\nFAITH NO MORE –\n\nThe legend returns. The first album in 18 years is due this February, to which I simply say – HOLY SHIT YES PLEASE!\n\nThe band made a statement of intent (hint – it doesn’t seem to include commercial airplay) with their first single from the new work – with the endearingly anti-commercial title of ‘Motherfucker’ . Great to have the boys back.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJR2Ab-DIkA\n\nTOOL –\n\nI have become so jaded about the mythical forthcoming album by Tool that I can’t even bring myself to start getting excited about the prospect.\n\nStop dicking around with my emotions and do it already Tool!\n\nRAISED FIST –\n\n‘From The North’ – the screaming Swedes are bursting back this January. And I cannot wait – I love their heavy, catchy hardcore styling’s.\n\nThe first single from the album is called ‘ Flow’ and is pretty indicative of the band’s signature sound.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKomW-7TAas\n\nGALLOWS –\n\n‘Desolation Sounds’ – The early taste of this newbie from the punk rock renegades that remain as Gallows is a big departure sound wise from previous work.\n\nAnd that is a big part of the reason I love this band. Bring on the new shit.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=174rhsTD4es\n\nSome other pending releases that have me pretty interested –\n\nTHE PRODIGY –\n\n‘The Day Is My Enemy’\n\nWhatever REFUSED come up with.\n\nBut I am nervous and not sure how I feel about this.\n\nTHE BEST CHICK GIG AWARD\n\n(Woman Of The Year)\n\nBRODY DALLE\n\nThese may be the inaugural Critical Mass Awards but were they not then I would say that Brody Dalle would be a three or four time winner of this award by now. Because she is Brody fucking Dalle.\n\nPlus this year I got to see her live and she was everything I hope she would be.\n\nVILLAIN OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n(Thanks for nothing asshole)\n\nAJ MADDAH\n\nThis is easy. Maddah used his biazarre Twitter diplomacy and unhinged business practices to become one of the most powerful people in Australian music.\n\nThen he promptly wiped the west coast of the country from his touring schedule, single-handedly removing long-standing musical right’s of passage from the kids west of Adelaide. He made a token attempt to placate western music fans with a shitty “travel package’ for which he bore no financial impost. And he also just seems like a really un-likable dude.\n\nThanks for nothing asshole.\n\nDishonorable mention –\n\nU2 –\n\nHow up yourselves can you out of touch narcissists get?\n\nFACEBOOK –\n\nthey seem intent on clamping down on the free exposure (for pages like ours) that has made them such a fantastic avenue to promote bands, films and thoughts.\n\nI may buy me some MySpace shares because you just never know….\n\nMOST UNDERRATED AWARD\n\n(Justin Beiber made a gazillion and yet nobody bought…)\n\nTHE WINNER IS –\n\nN.TELSA\n\nRussian post-metal. Their bio reads thus:\n\n“Exclamation mark! Suspension points…In 2008, the first (but not the final) line-up of this space circus had emerged in the town of Rostok, Germany. The project remained idle for a couple of years. Finally, in 2011 the fans of condensed milk-like oozing music met each other in the town of Oryol, Russia to share it from heart to heart and fill the collective consciousness”.\n\nHow can you not want to hear this band after reading that?\n\nThe guys contacted me via FB and asked for a review – and I am very glad they did!\n\nMy review is here to fill in the gaps for the curious:\n\nhttp://audiocracy.co/n-tesla-lux-manifesto/\n\nSo there’s my skew-if view of what went down and got out in 2014.\n\nThanks for reading – feel free to contribute your personal bests & worsts of the year in the comments here or in sky-writing by a small aircraft over my house.\n\nWelcome to my first ever movie awards, these awards are different with categories people may actually care about. It’s pretty prestigious makes the golden globes look like a contest of who gets the half chicken with dirty Mike and the gang. I hope you all enjoy…\n\nBLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT AWARD\n\n(the WTF award)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\n‘Interstellar’\n\n‘Tusk’\n\n‘Snowpiercer’\n\n‘The Sign\n\n‘Open Grave’\n\nThe Winner is : ‘Interstellar’\n\nReason – this movie wins due to the simple fact. I’m not a scientist and after leaving the cinema I had no idea if time slowed or speed up or if time existed at all, I was confused and intrigued at the same time. The movie was like a fun sized chocolate bar I liked it but I didn’t really understand it.\n\nWHY DON’T I OWN THIS AWARD?\n\n(Most Underrated)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\n‘Divergent’\n\n‘Sabotage’\n\n‘300 Rise Of An Empire’\n\n‘3 Days To Kill\n\n‘Robocop’ ‘\n\nThe Winner is – ‘3 Days To Kill’\n\nReason – If you haven’t seen this movie do yourself a favour go to your local video shop (they still exist don’t they). Yes it’s a poor man’s Taken but its generally good Kevin Costner is a beast and thou it got a small run in American cinemas unfortunately it didn’t get an Australian release the movie deserves to be watched and I recommend it, then again I recommended Zombie Beavers.\n\nWELL THAT WAS MEH AWARD\n\n(The I had high hopes about these award)\n\nThe nominees are\n\n‘Monuments Men’\n\n‘Anchor-Man 2’\n\n‘Need For Speed’\n\n‘Hunger Games’\n\n‘Bad Words’\n\nThe Winner is: ‘Monuments Men’\n\nReason – This was a tough one because Hunger Games was a real let down but Monuments Men took the award because I had high hopes with a stellar cast and a good plot It should have been good and with John Goodman in the movie, the movie I thought it was going to be brilliant but alas it was not great, not great at all.\n\nPUT THE DAMN LIGHTS ON AWARD\n\n(Best Horror)\n\nThe nominees a\n\n‘Deliver Us From Evil’\n\n‘As Above, So Below’\n\n‘Purge Anarchy’\n\n‘Annabelle’\n\n‘Paranormal Activity, The Marked Ones’\n\nThe Winner is : ‘Deliver Us From Evil’\n\nReason – This year’s horrors haven’t been the greatest pretty sub-par indeed it was a real struggle just to get decent nominees for this award. But in saying that I liked Chopper so I like Eric Bana so Deliver us from evil wins because I like Eric Bana, some would call me a Banaholic, I am currently in a 12 step process but I doubt it’s going to do anything so that’s why Eric Ba……. I mean deliver us from evil wins this prestigious award\n\nHahahahahahahaha AWARD\n\n(Best Comedy)\n\nThe nominees are\n\n‘The Interview’\n\n‘Lets Be Cops’\n\n‘Horrible Bosses 2”Bad Neighbours’\n\n’22 Jump Street’\n\n‘Bad Neighbours’\n\nThe Winner is : ‘Horrible Bosses 2′\n\nReason – Wowee the comedy’s this year have been a real treat if I was a decent man three movies would of won this award but I’m far from descent. Horrible Bosses took the award because of the sheer chemistry between the three main actors in this movie and add in a brilliant support cast and you have yourself a hilarious movie, the slow mo scene is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen some shit.\n\nBAD, JUST REALLY NOT GREAT AWARD\n\n(worst movie)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\n‘Knights of Badassdom’\n\n‘Under The Skin’\n\n‘Tusk’\n\n‘Noah’\n\n‘Vampire Academy’\n\nThe Winner is : ‘Knights Of Badassdom’\n\nReason – This movie was actually supposed to be out in 2013 but was delayed because put quite simply this movie is just the pits, I don’t normally like ragging on movies but this large turd kind of deserves it, But I don’t want to come across as an even bigger pompous jerk. It should have been descent there are comedy actors a plenty even that little fella from Game Of Thrones couldn’t save this movie the only man that coulda saved this movie is mother truckin Eric Roberts.\n\nWHY? WHY? I JUST DON’T GET IT AWARD\n\n(Pointless actors, Ruined Characters)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\nLucas (T.J. Miller) ‘Transformers 4’\n\nDreyfus (Gary Oldman) ‘Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’\n\nGuy Lapointe (Johnny Depp) ‘Tusk’\n\nShredder (Tohoro Masamune) ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’\n\nBruce Cuban (Nick Frost) ‘Fury’\n\nThe winner is : Lucas (TJ Miller) ‘Transformers 4’\n\nReason – Transformers Age Of Extinction is a terrible movie and I love transformers even the second one, but the forth one was dead in the water 30 minutes in because the funniest and most charming character Lucas gets disintegraded in an explosion. With witty one liners and a comedy chemistry between Marky Mark, Lucas was a good fun character in a rather dull film. An to kill this character off in the first 30 minutes made me a rather sad panda. Instead of 10,789 explosions they could have had Lucas doing sweet jokes.\n\nBEST BAD ASS VILLAIN AWARD\n\n(Bad Guy)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\nMagneto (Michael Fassbender) ‘X-Men’\n\nLouis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) ‘Nightcrawler’\n\nMann (Matt Damon) ‘Interstellar’\n\nWade (Gary Poulter) ‘Joe’\n\nHoward Howe (Michael Parks) ‘Tusk’\n\nThe Winner is : Wade (Gary Poulter) ‘Joe’\n\nReason – Okay this bad guy isn’t your everyday bad ass mother trucker this man put simply is just a real piece of shit, the perfect villain in my opinion should occur when viewing the film is to want nothing more than to jump into the movie and flat out fight a man. Wade is that character a drunken scum bag in the 1st degree. Gary Poulter has only ever done one movie, this movie shortly after filming Gary unfortunately left this world. If you haven’t seen Joe watch it immediately it’s a power house movie.\n\nI’M CALLING IT AWARD\n\n(Upcoming actors that may be stars)\n\nNot an award more of a prediction these future stars with the movies they stood out in this year.\n\nDane Dehaan (Harry Osbourne) ‘The Amazing Spiderman 2’\n\nBrenton Thwaites (Nik) ‘The Signal’\n\nEvan Peters (Quicksilver) ‘X-Men’\n\nMiles Teller (Daniel) ‘That Awkward Moment’\n\nDylan O’Brien (Thomas) ‘The Maze Runner’\n\nThe winner is : they’re all winners\n\nSCENE STEALER AWARD\n\n(Male and Female actors stealing scenes)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\nDave Franco (Pete) ‘Bad Neighbours’\n\nDave Batista (Drax) ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’\n\nJillian Bell (Mercedes) ’22 Jump Street’\n\nJon Bernthal (Grady Travis) ‘Fury’\n\nMatt Damon (Mann) ‘Interstellar’\n\nThe Winner is : Jon Bernthal (Grady Travis) ‘Fury’\n\nReason – Shane from The Walking Dead is being typecast here as a bit of an asshole with great results. In tank drama/action Fury, Grady Travis is just a simple man with no education to speak of, just a good ole southern boy. With an amazing cast with a lot more experience Jon does an amazing job not to be outshined and in some circumstances actually steal scenes from the other actors in a real jerk kind of way.\n\nBEST CHICK GIG AWARD\n\n(Best Actress)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\nScarlett Johansson (Lucy) ‘Lucy’\n\nKristen Wiig (Maggie Dean) ‘The Skeleton Twins’\n\nEmily Blunt (Rita) ‘Edge of Tomorrow’\n\nRosamund Pike (Amy Dunne) ‘Gone Girl’\n\nNoomi Rapace (Nadia) ‘The Drop’\n\nThe Winner is : Rosamond Pike (Amy Dunne) ‘Gone Girl’\n\nReason – After my years of experience doing my impersonations of Buffalo Bill in my mirror when I’m by myself at home I like to consider myself as a fellow actor. Rosamund Pike does an amazing job as Amy Dunne in great movie Gone Girl. From her innocence to her complete vindictiveness she nails the part, which is lucky because this movie is based on a bestselling book and if she did a bad job, imagine all the pompous nerds saying ‘awwwww the book is better, they ruined the Amy character, you should read the book’. That’s why I did Buffalo Bill by myself.\n\nBEST DUDE GIG AWARD\n\n(Best Actor)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\nJon Favreau (Carl Casper) ‘Chef’\n\nMichael C Hall (Richard Dane) ‘Cold in July’\n\nAndy Serkis (Caesar) ‘Dawn Of the Planet of the Apes’\n\nShia LeBeouf (Boyd Swan) ‘Fury’\n\nGuy Pearce (Eric) ‘The Rover’\n\nThe Winner is : Michael C Hall (Richard Dane) ‘Cold in July’\n\nReason – More than anything I really was tempted to have Shia LeBeouf win this prestigious award but I just couldn’t go past Dexter’s Michael C Hall. His portrayal of a dull (exceptionally dull) man who finds himself in an extreme situation is quite extraordinary. The whole movie Richard Dane walks around with the saddest face I’ve ever seen on a man and amazingly you quickly forget that this is TVs Dexter. A man without morals is no man at all (Wow shit just got deep). The movie and Michael mix perfectly with that theme, with Michael holding in so much rage and acting the pants off Don Johnson he deserves this.\n\nUPCOMING FILMS\n\n(movies for 2015)\n\nGet excited\n\n‘Seventh Son’ –Hope it’s great but it might be crud’\n\n‘Chappie’ — District 9 feel, excellent\n\n‘Jurassic World’ — My childhood favourite, what a treat\n\n‘In The Heart Of The Sea’ — Thor versus Moby Dick. Awesome\n\n‘Terminator Genesis’ — Mother of God I’m excited\n\nI hope they’re all winners\n\nLIAM NEESON AWARD\n\n(Formidable Fellas)\n\nThe Nominees are\n\nNicolas Cage (Joe) ‘Joe’\n\nBrad Pitt (Don Collier) ‘Fury’\n\nDenzel Washington (Robert McCall) ‘The Equalizer’\n\nKeanu Reeves (John Wick) ‘John Wick’\n\nTom Cruise (Cage) ‘Edge of Tomorrow’\n\nChris Evans (Curtis) ‘Snowpiercer’\n\nScarlett Johansson (Lucy) ‘Lucy’\n\nLiam Neeson (Matt Scudder) ‘A Walk Among The Tombstones’\n\nThe Winner is : Denzel Washington (Robert McCall) ‘The Equalizer’\n\nReason – Hard competition with a lot of hard ladies and gentlemen. If you haven’t seen any of the above movies I urge you to have a watch while doing weights and drinking straight scotch. I watched the Equalizer at the cinemas and I was so inspired I walked out of the theatre and killed a man with a frozen coke straw. If I ever get in a fight my new approach will be what would Denzel do. He is just a straight up bad ass I respect a man that counts out loud to see how long it takes to kill a couple of thugs. Denzel also demonstrated to me that when the zombie apocalypse happens I’m heading straight to a hardware store and using the strangest weapons known to man. Denzel ‘Mother fucking” Washington. Sir I salute you!\n\nNow for my last award on this big ass exceptionally opinionated list the movie of the year. An because I wrote this list and because I’m a little self-righteous a named it after myself.\n\nTHE DUFF AWARD\n\n(best of 2014 in order)\n\nThe Winners are\n\n5th ‘Joe’\n\n4th ‘Snowpiecer’\n\n3rd ‘Fury’\n\n2nd ‘Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes’\n\nAnd the number one movie bababa Dom (that was a drum roll people)\n\n1st ‘Edge Of Tomorrow’\n\nFor a movie everyone including me thought was going to be garbage turned out to be excellent, I have a sneaky suspicion if Tom Cruise wasn’t such a lil douche bag the movie would have been immensely popular and wouldn’t have failed on its cinema release. Watch it I highly recommend it!\n\nWell that’s all readers I hope it gave you a cracking 5 minutes of easy reading.\n\nOnce again thank you for letting me put my awards in your eye holes\n\nDuff.\n\nThose who lost their mojo.\n\nThe examples are numerous – bands that dwindled away the goodwill of their fans with diminishing quality of artistic output – good bands that lost their touch.\n\nThe reasons for such disappointing loss of form tend to fall into one of the following categories –\n\nThere are those who set the bar impossibly high for themselves early and spent their career failing to reach such levels of genius again, a self-imposed burden that means they both staked their place in musical history and tarnished it somewhat with lesser follow-ups. Have The Strokes ever lived up to the hype and excitement of their first album? Did Pearl Jam peak in the early years? Will Deftones ever do another ‘White Pony’? My answers would be – no, yes and unlikely but I live in hope.\n\nFor some it seems wildly out of control ego (plus being surrounded by yes-men) led down the dark path toward mediocrity – Van Halen tore each other apart when they jumped on a keyboard, Metallica drove in the thin edge of wedge when they got all soppy and discovered the power of “hugging it out” Soon they were being played on commercial radio and suing their own fans. But they really drove in the final nail when they collaborated with Lou Reed on the crime against music that was ‘Lulu’. Enough already guys. U2 disappeared ever further into the abyss of their own arseholes and at the same time the anti-poverty campaigner’s assets disappeared from the reaches of their homeland’s taxable clutches. At least Bono cured his own poverty I guess.\n\nDrugs have also been the catalyst for many a decline in quality. Great music is almost always based on great chemistry but shit music is often based on great intake of chemicals. Guns N Roses had the ego in spades, and not just Axl who (deservedly to a point) gets the blame for the band disintegrating into a punchline, other members were also culpable in their painfully predictable de-evolution. Not long after releasing one of the best debut albums in rock history the band became increasingly dysfunctional as they were delving deeper and deeper into substance abuse. What would The Doors’ legacy be if Jim Morrison had a moment of clarity and realised he was drifting from prophetic poet into the kind of boring wanker you would set off the fire alarm at a party to get away from. He may even have realised they didn’t have a bass player –which is in itself a crime in my eyes.\n\nPersonnel change is another obvious cause of decreased quality. More often than not the band unit is disrupted to the point where the creative juices are stifled or the mix just doesn’t work. Bands that haven’t taken the hint to pull the pin when they should have are numerous – INXS milked it for all they could and it was sad to watch their cable televised nadir. Sepultura is completely unrecognisable to the band of Brazilian brothers who flipped the script with successive opuses – ‘Chaos AD’ & ‘Roots’ Bands like Anthrax, Pennywise and Megadeth have worked out the hard way that the sum of their parts was greater than their whole and attempted to backflip on the change.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers are one band who manage to cover all the above basses – ego, personnel changes and drugs have got them to where they are today – an embarrassing parody of what they once were. The main difference for them is that they were actually better when they were on drugs.\n\nThe final and most heinous reason for changing direction and failing to hit the target is commercialism. Rare is the band that moves its sound toward the mainstream and doesn’t have the lack of genuine artistic motivation come through in their sound. The temptation to cash in must be strong at times but the payoff is a loss of integrity and a dilution of the very essence that created the greatness in the first place.\n\nIn my eyes -and ears – these are some of the bands that I once loved and/or respected who have fallen into a vortex of diminishing returns. It is not to say I have lost all respect for these artists, but I can’t help but be disappointed by their chosen directions.\n\nMUSE\n\nThese guys went from a unique troupe of up-and-comers to a dynamic festival headlining live weapon in the space of four albums. They are a band that I only really “got” after seeing them live – front man Matt Bellamy singing in a toe curling falsetto whilst smashing out ripping riffs and occasionally giving the keys a work out, the little fella behind the drums – Dom – laying down a bedrock of pulsating rhythm and bassist Chris Wolstenholme providing some truly kick ass bass lines to the mix. They were equally capable of crunchy rock numbers and hypnotic balladeering and they seemingly were not bound by any artistic constraints.\n\nThen ‘The Resistance’ happened.\n\nThere are times that the kiss of death for a group can be summed up in two simple words – “self-produced”. Some people need the tap on the shoulder to tell them that the meandering and sickeningly self-indulgent 15 minute piano epic that the band think is “their Bohemian Rhapsody” is actually unlistenable tripe. Artistic evolution is admirable and attractive – I don’t particularly respect a band that churns out the same album every few years (*cough* AC/DC *cough*) but evolution isn’t always improvement.\n\nIn the case of Muse the chaps were obviously chuffed with their direction and the commercial success it brought and followed up the limp sounds of ‘The Resistance” with an album overflowing with similarly neutered radio fodder and extravagant superfluousness ‘The 2nd Law’. I began to suspect we were heading in different directions when the guitar-to-keytar ratio began tipping the way of the synth but I knew it was over for Muse and I when I heard their song introduced on FM radio as “that band you would know from the Twilight soundtrack”. Yuck.\n\nHere’s hoping little Matt and his mates can find the riffs on the album they are currently working on and stay away from self-producing in secluded countryside French Chateaus’ recording studios, and keep off the cocaine.\n\nThe good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dm_5qWWDV8\n\nThe bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OOWcsFj0U\n\nSYSTEM OF A DOWN\n\nNobody sounded like System when they broke big, their mix of groovy heaviness, seething social awareness and outright weirdness made them an interesting and stimulating addition to the landscape. The angry Armenians had much to say and obtuse ways to say it and they made an impact with their second album “Toxicity” selling shitloads.\n\nBut ego and infighting meant the band’s last recorded efforts – ‘Hypnotize’ and ‘Mesmerize’ lacked the x-factor that previously made them special. And don’t even get me started on the releasing of two filler packed discs each for full price in short succession – I hated the idea when Gunners did it with ‘Use Your Illusion’ and it irked me again when SOAD down had a crack.\n\nWord is that by this stage the band’s guitarist and self-appointed creative force Daron Malakian was running the band with an iron fist and tensions were high. Whilst Rick Rubin is credited along with Malakian as co-producer on the albums I can’t help but speculate (without any evidence whatsoever) that Rubin didn’t hold any veto power or much sway regarding the final product. Beyond a few more overwrought slower numbers the albums trod little new ground sonically, with the thing that really did my head in being the lyrics – they mostly sound like bad angsty teenage poetry with generic rhymes and self-indulgent themes replacing the surreptitious borderline cryptic political preaching of previous efforts.\n\nBoth albums had some good spots – it’s just that where a more measured band would probably release one very good album with minimal filler it seems SOAD struggled with their rampant ego believing their talents impervious and by this point likely thought their bodily waste smelled like lavender – a mindset which led to them putting out a couple of albums full of mostly forgettable material.\n\nTension reached its apex and the band went on hiatus in 2006 with the break up allowing the clashing alpha males among them to sow their creative oats solo or in other acts which they apparently could preside over comparatively unchallenged.\n\nThey have since reformed and have toured the world putting on soulless shows of previous material with no sign of new noise on the horizon and in-fighting and ego still rearing its head on occasion.\n\nThe good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSvFpBOe8eY\n\nThe bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pBG-laBKsI\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\nThe Music were the up-and-coming wonder boys of British danceable indie rock in the early naughties. Their first two albums – 2002’s self-titled effort and 2004’s ‘Welcome To The North’ display the knack for a catchy ditty and show admirable musical progression – plus the band backed it up with fantastic live shows.\n\nTheir sound could be pegged as an amalgam of several influences whilst maintaining enough uniqueness and resolve to stand out from the pack. I used to call them ‘kind of an English Jane’s Addiction” as a lazy and frankly questionable reference point. Their accessible sound coupled with the fact they seemed like pretty down to earth lads who loved to party meant they were relatable and rising. Unfortunately their penchant for partying – specifically singer Robert Harvey’s addictive personality led a gradual slide toward mediocrity.\n\n2008 saw The Music drop rather ‘meh’ third and final album ‘Strength In Numbers’ with its more overt electronic elements leaving it mostly feeling like a watered down version of sounds others were doing better by that stage.\n\nPity really.\n\nThe good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ7S1NqzIvA\n\nThe bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doxRnv_6Ips\n\nFEAR FACTORY\n\nThis is the list’s first real example of a band releasing an album so exceptional and dynamic it changed the face of their corner of the music world forever, whilst setting a level that the band never was really able to reproduce.\n\nAfter building some buzz with their first real release – the industrial metal/death metal/techno hybrid ‘Soul Of The New Machine’ the band dropped their finest work in 1995 when ‘Demanfacture’ blew minds worldwide. I remember hearing the album for the first time – the clinical precision of the instruments, the ability of singer Burton C Bell to hit amazing clean highs and belly rumbling low growls, it was an awesome album and it got a hell of a work out in my stereo for years to come.\n\nAt this point the band were also a next level live act, when I saw them the first time they slotted straight into the top of my list of best live bands ever. They spawned a series of intimidators and led the charge toward breaking down barriers between heavy and electronic music.\n\nBut they apparently left themselves little place to go from there. Their next couple of albums ‘Obsolete’ and (to a lesser extent) ‘Digimortal’ had some brilliant moments but as a whole could never stand alongside the paradigm shifting masterpiece that was ‘Demanfacture’.\n\nSince the salad days the band have been a revolving door of ring-ins and returnees and have pumped out several mediocre albums which have largely mined the same vein in terms of tone and theme.\n\nLast year I saw them for the first time in over a decade as they performed ‘Demanufacture’ from go to woe. (I’ll just leave my review of the show here: http://audiocracy.co/live-reviews-3/international-acts/fear-factory-twelve-foot-ninja-metro-city-perth-110713/ )\n\nIt must be a confusing and infuriating mixture of feelings for the band – pride to have released such a revered work and frustration that you may never live up to that standard again.\n\nThe good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKmK32uGAJo\n\nThe bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E510Ixbv-BA\n\nPUBLIC ENEMY\n\nPE are another group who may have simply set the bar too high for themselves. Their early albums, in particular ‘It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back’ & ‘Fear Of A Black Planet’ count among hip hop’s most venerated and influential albums. The whole Public Enemy package was unique, exciting, intriguing and a more than a little confronting.\n\nLed by the most articulate and charismatic of MC’s in Chuck D, supported by unhinged hype man Flavor Flav and DJ extraordinaire Terminator X. All backed by a synchronised dancing yet arse-kicking platoon of camouflage clad mercenaries in S1W. Led by controversial figurehead Professor Griff they served as an intimidating backdrop to the bands confronting aural attack. And the whole sound was underpinned sonically by the brilliant and ground-breaking production of Bomb Squad – PE ruled the hip hop world in the late 80’s and early 90’s.\n\nThey were passionate politically, aggressive musically, and ground-breaking artistically, the fact they somehow resonated with a small town kid from the other side of the world (yes me) is remarkable on its own and testament to their ability to spread their messages and music to demographics that would seem both culturally and geographically removed from their initial core audiences.\n\nTheir determination to stand for their beliefs and put a spotlight on many race related issues that were rampant in their native USA coupled with their forthright yet accessible methods of expressing them are all factors in their indelible legacy. Their early releases are packed with classic hip hop moments and there can be no argument about the band’s standing in the musical lexicon.\n\nHowever things started going bad within and around the band when they were at the peak of their powers. Terminator X had a traffic accident which led to his retirement from music to breed ostriches (seriously), Professor Griff brought a shitstorm of negativity upon the band with some controversial anti-Semitic comments that ultimately led to his bitter removal from the PE posse. They also faced vocal opposition from extreme conservatives within the US government who seemed determined to make an example of the band due to their outspoken and often confrontational content and presentation. To top it off Flavor Flav was increasingly erratic as a result of partying way too hard to be a reliable contributor.\n\nAmid the turmoil the band released ‘Apocalypse 91’ in 1991 (duh!) but it wasn’t up to their previous standard (beyond their genre bending version of ‘Bring The Noise’ with Anthrax which is a classic) Growing tensions and turbulence led to a downward trend and diminished quality on the several albums between then and now. Things have apparently settled down with time and the band still tour and continue to record. But they just never managed to capture the excitement that was the essence of their earlier albums. Time, place, circumstance, plus the talent and fire made them the legends, but the lightening simply cannot strike twice.\n\nDespite this they rightly hold a position of reverence in the hip hop world, as well as the respect of the broader musical community and have left an indelible mark on popular culture.\n\nThe good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHxkPNx23Og\n\nThe bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCx5Std7mCo\n\nTHE CLASH\n\nThis one really hurts. The Clash are among my favourite ever bands and they rightfully hold a position among the most important musical acts of all time.\n\nThey burst onto the scene in the midst of the UK punk explosion but quickly proceeded to separate themselves musically and stylistically from the punk pack. The band were driven to experiment and showed an ability to expand and evolve their sound beyond the limitations of so many of their peers.\n\nTheir story is a tale of working class triumph followed by a slow decent into oblivion. If you work through their albums in chronological order you can clearly see their growth was based on a refusal to adhere to any outwardly imposed boundaries. They took punk to places others were afraid to explore, it meant turning off some traditionalists but also achieving surprising and inspiring success outside the boundaries imposed by “the scene”.\n\nTheir albums ranged from the urgent and endearing raw debut through a progression in sound -most obviously textured by a strong reggae influence – all the way through to their final couple albums ‘Combat Rock’ and ‘Cut The Crap’ which essentially were releases of a quasi-Clash and as a result these albums sit slightly awkwardly among the rest of their output.\n\nAfter releasing epic (if slightly overstuffed) albums such as ‘London Calling’ and ‘Sandinista!’ infighting and substance abuse had fractured the band and caused sadly irreversible damage. Whilst ‘Combat Rock’ may contain a couple of The Clash’s more well-known cuts – ‘Should I Stay Or Should I Go’ and ‘Rock The Casbah’ – as well as classic tune ‘Straight To Hell’ for the most part it reeked of a band in disarray. The disjointed feel of the album coupled with the fact some of more experimental elements don’t seem to hit the mark mean ‘Combat Rock’ falls well short in comparison to their previous work.\n\nHowever despite the writing seemingly being on the wall – in 20 foot high letters – the band did go on to release one more album – well sort of. The Clash that recorded and toured ‘Cut The Crap’ bore little resemblance to the band of brothers that had made such landmark albums in the previous decade. Infighting – specifically the butting of heads between Joe Strummer and Mick Jones – meant there was little-to-no true collaboration on the writing and eventually artistic differences and perceived affronts led to the creative heart at the band’s core slowly dying.\n\nBy the time the album was released Strummer was the sole surviving original member with Jones and Simonon each departing acrimoniously. The two were replaced for the album’s tour – including Perth’s own Nick Sheppard getting the guitar slot – and Joe took the album on the road to minimal interest and acclaim.\n\nThe pity of the situation is that it seems stubbornness led to a band that had changed the musical world for the better flogging a horse they knew was dead but didn’t want to bury. They still stand as one the best bands ever to grace the earth but the ending did seem to tarnish their legacy ever so slightly.\n\nThe good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTnijX0TH-w\n\nThe bad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms_ZRZmvk10\n\nHonourable mention:\n\nBeastie Boys – I love the Beasties and they dropped some brilliant albums back in the day – ‘Check Your Head’ & ‘Ill Communication’ being my personal faves. Their energy and willingness to experiment meant their early albums oozed originality and were chock full of genre bending classics. But their last couple of efforts got nowhere close to the marker set by those ground breaking works. The effects of pushing the envelope so far it simply will not move any further coupled with a member’s alleged hard drug addiction meant they lost much of their spark.\n\nWeezer – just how good they ever actually were is open to debate, I don’t rate them as highly as many, but there is little doubt their old stuff is better than their new stuff.\n\nWhich segues nicely into…\n\nRegurgitator – I just really didn’t get into the whole Casio saccharine pop sound they went with on ‘Unit’ and ‘…art.’ I much preferred when they were pumping out songs about being “a sucker like me” or making jingly pop ditties about how much cock they sucked to get where they were. They slowly became a bit of a whacky novelty band (remember the band in the bubble thing?) which is sad because they really had something there.\n\nThe Verve – looked like they were due for world domination after their album ‘Urban Hymns’ sold a squillion copies. But a lawsuit or two, a lot of partying and a lack of fresh ideas put the kibosh on that.\n\nBlack Flag – survived all the turn over and turmoil of their heyday in the height of the American hardcore boom only to piss all over the legacy they created decades later. Currently there are not one but two reformed incarnations of the oft name-checked legends. The opposing bands did the least punk thing they could and sued each other over rights and royalties with Greg Ginn winning the right to tear down the empire and put out a shithouse record under the Black Flag moniker.\n\nSo there’s my completely irrational list, if you think I missed any bands or missed the mark anywhere then feel free to leave your suggestions in the suggestion box.\n\nFormidable, epic fellas, the man’s man. They own the screen with their utter manliness and absolute willingness for revenge and ass kicking. Often accompanied with the casual slow walk away from explosions, quirky shit yourself man threats and, I can only imagine, huge balls reeking of testicular fortitude.\n\nThese manly men deserve a list to go through the best of the best and luckily I’ve just had a Red Bull so it’s either start typing or start knitting my dog a onesie and I’ve knitted my dog hundreds of onesies so you lucky readers get an awesome list. Before I start, there are two movies I can’t put in any of these mediocre lists, Predator and The Grey. Because quite frankly I’m super biased and they would be one and two on every single list, especially top ten romantic comedies.\n\nSo I hope you enjoy and once again feel free to dispute my list in the comments section so I can swiftly say “Nah, mine’s better!”.\n\n10. Maximus (Russell Crowe)\n\nGladiator\n\nBefore Russell Crowe started eating heavily, growing out his ridiculous hair and throwing phones at hotel staff (they probably deserved it), there was Russell Crowe the gladiator, a real bloody man’s man. I imagine the job of a gladiator would be a hard one and I’m not talking about the spandex wearing douche bags pushing skinny nerds down a foam pyramid but the proper gladiators, fighting till the death in front of thousands of ravenous Romans. Russel Crowe portrays the formidable fella Maximus Decimus Meridius, an ex-Roman General turned Gladiator slave all because of a whiny jealous nancy boy.\n\nIn essence the film is a revenge movie and as ol’ Maximus would say “I will have my vengeance“. I for one believed just that, with his barrel chest, gym junkie arms and the best helmet I’ve seen in a movie since BMX Bandits. Russell is one bad ass dude. From defeating armies, tussling with chariots and even a couple of angry lions. Maximus earns this number 10 spot because he defied an Empire with sandals and a skirt not many people can pull that off, the role not the skirt.\n\nBest line: At my signal, Unleash hell\n\nMan Moment: Any Gladiator fight, they’re all pretty awesome\n\n9. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane)\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe only comic book character to make this prestigious list is the Punisher and here’s why. Frank Castle doesn’t have a large bank account to buy expensive little toys because he has daddy issues, he isn’t smart enough to make a robot suit, he isn’t the God of lightning who names their hammer (Who does that? I use a hammer, wanna know what I call it I call it …….. a tool) and when he’s mad he doesn’t turn into a large green Shrek. He does have one thing going for him and that ladies and gentlemen is vengeance.\n\nRetired FBI agent Frank Castle has pissed off the wrong gangster. A slimy John Travolta proceeds to swiftly assassinate his whole family, literally his whole family, in-laws, grandma and grandpa and probably the family dog. I really don’t know I wasn’t there. Frank is reborn as the formidable Punisher and he is rather upset about his family being dispatched in such a grisly fashion. Thomas Jane wouldn’t have been my first choice to play the punisher, but now I can’t think of anyone else portraying him.\n\nArmed with an assortment of guns, a god damned crossbow, a sweet car and an exceptional shirt and leather jacket combo… Seriously where does one get that shirt? Do I have to be a vigilante out for revenge or should I just try EBay? Anyway, the number 9 spot is owned by Frank Castle, a real man’s man.\n\nBest Line: You smell that Mick? I’m burning off some of your fat\n\nMan Moment: The fight with The Russian is an awesome fight scene. I love a good fight that goes through walls\n\n8. Conner & Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery & Norman Reedus)\n\nThe Boondock Saints\n\nFor people who haven’t seen this movie, I demand that you treat your eye holes to this hidden gem. Connor and Murphy are two Irish fraternal twins working in a meat packing factory in the mean streets of Boston when they get stiff armed by a couple of gangsters. The brothers then receive a message from God while they sleep then all hell breaks loose. They go from every day Joes to desert eagle totting, head shooting, gospel speaking, scotch drinking, cigarette smoking assassins.\n\nThese two have one advantage against the Mob, they have the all mighty Christ on their side and even though they mess up nearly all their assassinations they still get the job done. The rope conversation the brothers have is golden, they could literally say what they want their Irish accents are spot on especially when they are threatening people.\n\nAs soon as God contacts them in a way fairly similar to how Freddy Kruger contacts people, and they get their hands on silenced desert eagles, these twins become formidable fellas indeed. Both Sean and Norm (Walking Dead’s Darryl) play the twins to perfection. And these messengers-from-God brothers secure the number 8 spot. AMEN!\n\nBest Line: With every breath, we will hunt them down. Each day we will spill there blood til it rains down from the skies.\n\nMan Moment: The gun battle with II Duce is a moment that you will never forget especially the little twist at the end\n\n7. John McClane (Bruce Willis)\n\nDie Hard\n\nEveryone has seen Die Hard and if you have only watched it once you may wanna check your pulse as you may be dead. John McClane has revolutionised the everyman takes on a terrorist, there has been a lot of fairly decent similar movies but there is only one Bruce Willis. When terrorist take on a building they didn’t expect NYPD man’s man John to be running around foiling their dastardly plans.\n\nThe whole movie is about Bruce. It’s a reminder that the bald-headed guy in the latest Die Hard was actually pretty formidable in the first three movies (those movies are 1, 3 & 4, as far as I’m concerned Die Hard 2 doesn’t exist). The wise cracking John is actually hilarious and a legendary cinema character that may stand the test of time like dinosaurs… they’re still around right, Jurassic park was a true story yeah?\n\nHow does one man take out a team of terrorists? I’ll tell ya how. John is a bad ass mother trucker! It’s literally that simple. The only weakness he has is bare feet. The movie would have been 30 minutes if he was wearing shoes. John is an everlasting, time tested, formidable fella and for that reason he claims the number 7 spot.\n\nBest Line: Glass? Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this?\n\nMan Moment: Jumping off a building with a tyre hose around your waist then proceeding to bust through some glass with bloody feet. Pretty damn manly\n\n6. Driver (Dwayne Johnson)\n\nFaster\n\nThe Rock was always one of my favourite wrestlers, and now he’s one of my favourite actors bringing all his charisma from the squared ring to the silver screen in astonishing fashion. I even liked The Tooth Fairy and I’ll fight any man that disagrees, that’s about 11 billion men. I couldn’t do it because I’m a big sissy boy whose idea of karate is to jump on my bed yelling “push kick”. Dwayne Johnson on the other hand would probably give it a good crack.\n\nIn Faster he is at his most menacing. Something about The Rock on a murderous revenge fuelled rampage scares the shit outta me and rightfully so. When a character gets released from prison, casually gets in a huge muscle car, casually gets a hold of a gun and casually walks into a call centre and shoots a guy in the head. That’s pretty special.\n\nThe Rock is a goddamn specimen, his arms are literally as big as my belly, and I’m sure I’m carrying twins. The amazing thing about this formidable character is that you never know his name throughout the movie his only known as Driver. Which only adds to the menacing Rock. He’s huge, he’s angry and he’s out for revenge and casually takes the number 6 spot on this list.\n\nBest Line: God can’t save you from me\n\nMan Moment: The conversation he has with a dead man’s son, after he has an awesome knife fight in a toilet\n\n5. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy)\n\nWarrior\n\nWe have all had a family quarrels, a fight that normally happens around the drinking season, they are normally anger-fuelled with the end result being nothing more than a girly man tiff. In Warrior the family quarrel ends in an octagon, now that’s a manly way to end a tiff with bare knuckles and an emotional choke hold. Most of my choke holds end in tears and a sore wrist (wink, wink).\n\nTommy Conlon is a man. A hard working, octagon fighting man. A man who has a massive chip on his shoulder, when his former alcoholic father starts training him for a mixed martial arts tournament. He is on a collision course to have an epic fight with his older brother in a truly epic fight.\n\nTom Hardy is, I think I’ve said this before, a damn man. Unlike his brother that likes to submit people while taking an abundance of damage. Tommy takes a different and a far more frightening strategy. His fights go like this: he man walks to the ring, he man stalks his opponent then proceeds to swiftly knock him out then immediately man walks back to the locker room no fuss, no off beat shenanigans just a fight and a goddamn result. With Tommy seething with every inch of his frame and dominating the screen every time he appears, Tommy Conlon earns the 5 spot with a fist and a sneer.\n\nBest Line: Yeah. Must be tough to find a girl who could take a punch these days (with the death look in his eyes)\n\nMan Moment: all his fight scenes and his conversations with his father. Riveting stuff\n\n4. Riddick (Vin Diesel)\n\nPitch Black\n\nThere aren’t many movies that surprise me.. Pitch Black did, I frigging love it. That is mainly because of Riddick, a muscle bound mysterious prisoner with awesome water goggles even though they’re on an extremely dry planet (fun fact Riddick’s first name is Richard. Would have been number 1 if his name wasn’t Richard).\n\nRiddick is the type of man nightmares a made of, but it’s incredibly hard to hate the murderous son-of-a-gun. He’s that lethal it wouldn’t surprise me if his mum is a gun. As the prisoner ship crash lands on a mysterious planet, Riddick immediately figures out that he isn’t the most dangerous thing on the planet. Insert killer aliens here, this is where the true Riddick shows himself. And what an exceptional journey we are taken on.\n\nRiddick is the nicest sociopath on the silver screen. Sure he’s using his fellow crash landing friends to use there ship as a means of escape, but he is that bad ass that he could have made it to the ship by himself. What a bloody nice guy. On the dark planet fighting to survive against hammer headed aliens, Riddick is in his element. With his presence and leering gravelly voice, Vin Diesel portrays Riddick to perfection. So much so that two more awesome movies were made making Riddick a smashing number 4.\n\nBest Line: Gotta kill a few people\n\nMan Moment: The fight with the aliens, figuring out their blind spots and dispatching them\n\n3. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon)\n\nBourne Identity\n\nIf you don’t know who Jason Bourne is then that’s kind of ironic because Jason Bourne doesn’t know who Jason Bourne is. What a bloody mad twist. Bourne is a sweet formidable character with substance and deathly karate skills that makes The Karate Kid look like well a karate kid.\n\nJason Bourne did something truly remarkable it made people realise that Matt Damon isn’t a douche he’s actually awesome. What a job he did. Bourne is hell bent trying to discover who he really is, so he goes one on one with the government to devastating effect. Fighting cops other assassins and having one of the best car chase scenes in recent memory. I tell ya who Bourne is he is a goddamn man.\n\nThe action of the movie is relentless and no one has ever seen fight scenes like this, they’re fast, real fast, and realistic. Bourne is a relentless killing machine with revenge on his minds against the damn suits in Washington. With swift kicks and well placed punches Bourne kicks his way into the number 3 spot on this rather prestigious list.\n\nBest Line: You move, you die\n\nBest Moment: The car chase and the fight scenes, truly awesome\n\n2. John Casey (Denzel Washington)\n\nMan on Fire\n\nMy favourite movies are creature flicks and movies about former special ops agents finding their hearts then going on a revenge romp to set things right and that’s pretty much Man on Fire in a nutshell. I’m not saying they should add a half-man, half-piranha creature in the movie, but if they did wowee what a flick that would have been.\n\nJohn Casey is a big cuddly teddy bear in the first half of the movie forming a real tight relationship with the girl he is supposed to protect, the delightful Pita. Pita opens Casey’s man ribs and reveals a rather large heart. When Pita is kidnapped and becomes a victim of crime John Casey reverts back to his special agent personae, which is a scary, frightening and formidable man indeed. He starts at the bottom and tortures his way to the top of the criminal food chain.\n\nThe second half of the movie is owned by Denzel Washington, with the perfect amount of cool and deadly revenge firmly set in his mind, and any Mexicans that get in his way will be met with a rather slow torturous death. With a swag and a frown John Casey is a one man war machine. Don Cheadle ain’t got shit on Denzel. When John makes the ultimate sacrifice to get Pita back you realise you are a weak man because John Casey doesn’t cry and here you are crying your eyes out. Because I’m typing through tears John Casey gets the number 2 spot.\n\nBest Line: Forgiveness is between them and God. It’s my job to arrange the meeting\n\nMan Moment: Any of the death scenes and the deadly gait that only Denzel can pull off\n\n1. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson)\n\nTaken\n\nNeeson’s action man birth in the film business shocked everyone, no one realised you could threaten a man to death until Liam hit the screen. Bryan Mills is another ex-special forces agent on a murderous rampage. When I was younger I was thinking about getting into the kidnapping business, but then I saw Taken. THANK YOU Liam Neeson for setting me straight. What a saint.\n\nTaken is the ultimate man’s man revenge story. If you haven’t seen it slowly get up off your seat, calmly walk to a large mirror, shed one single tear and say “I’m sorry Liam Neeson” five times. When Bryan Mills daughter is kidnapped to be put to work in the sex trade profession, Bryan transforms into the scariest man on earth. A truly remarkable character that will stop at nothing, and I mean nothing, to get his daughter back. For example, shooting a fellow ops wife in the leg just to get an answer out of the corrupt spook. Also finding the kidnapping ring through a phone call and hunting everyone, his manliness at its best.\n\nLiam Neeson is a beast. His portrayal of Bryan is a real treat, he remarkably seems 10 foot compared to his Russian counterparts. The fights scenes are incredible. But what separates Bryan from everyone else on this list is the words that are spoken, every time he talks it’s a threatening man voice, I imagine if God had a voice he would sound like Liam Neeson. Bryan Mills is the reason this list exists and I’m sure you’re all very appreciative for that. For being the ultimate man’s man and for being the most formidable fella to brace the screen with his presence there was really no other choice for the number 1 spot. Mr Neeson I salute you sir.\n\nBest Line: I don’t know who you are. I don’t know what you want. If you are looking for a ransom, I can tell you I don’t have any money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that will be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don’t I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.\n\nMan Moment: The above scene send shivers down my spine the scene when he meets this man is breathe taking\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nJake Mazursky, Ben Foster (Alpha Dog)\n\nJules Winnfield, Samuel L Jackson (Pulp Fiction)\n\nLt Aldo, Brad Pitt (Inglorious Basterds)\n\nWallace, Mel Gibson (Braveheart)\n\nDoc Holiday, Val Kilmer (Tombstone)\n\nCameron Poe, Nicolas Cage (Con Air)\n\nKevin Bacon (Everything)\n\nI hope you all enjoyed, feel free to give me some feedback but be warned I don’t handle constructive criticism very well. Like and share people, let’s get Critical Mass critical.\n\nYours truly ,your friendly neighbourhood\n\nDuff.\n\nKnowing your limitations is something that can be very important. Unfortunately it sometimes can seem that musicians are among the worst judges of where their talents end and their hubris begins.\n\nThere are plenty of movies that feature glimpses of talented (or otherwise) musos having a tiny stab at the acting caper, and as expected the results vary wildly.\n\nSo who do I rate among the best and the worst?\n\nWell despite a distinct lack of public demand I decided to whack a list together.\n\nBEST\n\nLars Urlich – Get Him To The Greek\n\nThe best cameos by people playing themselves are when they are chock full of self-effacing humour. In the clip attached below Lars cops a pretty stinging one-liner rebuke from hedonistic egoist and the movie’s main protagonist Aldous Snow – played by Russell Brand.\n\nKudos to the litigious Metallica skinsman for this cheeky appearance and having enough of a sense of humour to allow the burn at his expense. Personally I would rate this as the best work Lars has been involved in for over 20 years.\n\nFun fact: whilst the scenes with Lars made the final cut a cameo from Katy Perry (Brand’s wife at the time) did not.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvYYqRefhuM\n\nSigur Ros – Game Of Thrones\n\nThe Icelandic post-rock legends appeared quite briefly at the wedding of Joffrey & Margaery where -spoiler alert for anyone who is that far behind – (did you just flee an Amish commune or something? Get watching!) they manage to not die a bloody death despite Joffrey seemingly being fond of their musical stylings.\n\nIt was the band’s debut appearance in person, although they had previously lent their musical talents to the show’s soundtrack – they performed a song written by George RR Martin that played during the infamous ‘Red Wedding’ episode, apparently.\n\nFun fact: Other artists to have been among the cast of billions that makes up any given episode of Game Of Thrones have been members of Coldplay and Snow Patrol.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvYYqRefhuM\n\nPrimus – Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey\n\nSome geniuses managed to drag out the flimsiest of premises (and acting talents) to actually make this sequel to the depressingly popular hit flick ‘Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure’ – bravo Hollywood.\n\nBeyond a small but awesome cameo the movie is horseshit. The main characters are annoying as fuck and the whole thing has held up about as well as Kenny Rogers’ face.\n\nPrimus make an appearance in a scene where they tackle stoner heroes Bill & Ted’s band Wyld Stallyns in a talent quest – no prizes for guessing whether or not the mad funk talents of Primus beat out the mentally impaired hero’s own band.\n\nFun fact – Primus frontman Les Claypool is, in real life, an alien. He is from a race of extra-terrestrials who can do impossible things with musical instruments.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flKK4BlhgVk\n\nSnoop Dogg – Half Baked\n\nSnoop plays a stoner – and nails it. Mr Dogg may not show a lot of range in his role as ‘Scavenger Smoker’ but this absolute gem of a flick from Dave Chappelle is on my list of ‘underrated modern day classics in the weed film genre’ and deserves a spot on the positive side of the ledger.\n\nSnoop may only be in the film for one minute – but he is on point and I really like this movie.\n\nFun fact: I have the sudden overwhelming urge to watch Half Baked again.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMp2WfOw2-4\n\nLemmy – Airheads\n\nYou know you nailed your cameo when everyone who knows the movie can recite your solitary line.\n\nDuring a mass confession of nerdy past deeds Motorhead hardass Lemmy bobs up and contributes his line “I was editor of the school magazine” – which apparently is a true statement.\n\nAs the movie itself says “Lemmy is God”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2uxQ6gl7vI\n\nFun fact: there is some sort of tenuous connection between Lemmy’s family and my recent ancestors back in England. I can’t remember the details so will ask my dad and get back to you.\n\nHonourable mention\n\nAlice Cooper in Wayne’s World, he very nearly altered the pronunciation of Milwaukee forever.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FT3IGXtAk\n\nRZA in Ghost Dog. Great movie and RZA does a wonderful job with the soundtrack. His on screen appearance is only a matter of seconds long but it is pretty damn cool.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=resUyjKmOj0\n\nTom Waits in Domino. Super cool.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZguSDDJ7LI\n\nWORST\n\nMaynard James Keenan – Crank 2: High Voltage\n\nThe fact the producers thought to drag this flimsy concept out for a sequel is nearly as unbelievable as the fact prog-metal oenologist Maynard James Keenan decided to take the cameo role as a doggie-tasering gay dude in such a horrible piece of shit movie.\n\nThe fact this scene is borderline unwatchable is actually not the fault of the multi-talented Keenan. In fact the diminutive man who has his huge voice (and subversive sense of humour) all over some of the best music released in the last 25 years is the best thing in this god-awful movie.\n\nThe script on display here is woeful – the lowest forms of humour are on parade from the get-go – nut-shots, fart jokes, badly executed slapstick and repeated ‘c-bombs’ all packed into a couple of painfully long minutes.\n\nSimply put – Maynard is better than that.\n\nFun fact: Maynard is an expert in Brazilian Jujitsu and loves wrestling. Below is a pretty famous clip of him choking out some knob who gets in his grill onstage (to skip to the incident go to 2.40mins – but know that not listening to Tool can be bad for your health)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKrUaY6hgpM\n\nAnd here’s the scene from Crank if you really want to put yourself through it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcp_AZlURyE\n\nKeith Richards – Pirates Of The Caribbean\n\nAs if my brain wasn’t hurting enough from enduring the “acting” of Orlando Bloom, the pompous poutiness of Kira Knightly and the general flim-flam that made up this awful film series, my bonce nearly burst when Rolling Stones axeman Keith Richards appeared on screen.\n\nAfter watching hours of Jonny Depp do his worst Keith impression having the animated fossil himself on screen was too much to take. It was like witnessing some rip in the space time continuum, I think something in my head popped. It was like trying to comprehend the size of space or the fame of Olivia Newton John – it nearly gave me an aneurism.\n\nOn top of the brain melting aspects the all too apparent fact is that Keith Richards is not a very good actor.\n\nFun fact: Keith Richards once nearly burned down the Playboy Mansion whilst doing drugs in the bathroom. I would imagine that would not have been a popular move.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EnOjGuQkNs\n\nFergie – Poseidon\n\nAll you need to know is that it is fucking Fergie from the fucking Black Eyed fucking Peas.\n\nFun fact: I really, really hate the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1aLJNJhhU\n\nAlanis Morisette – Dogma\n\nThis was the sad confirmation that Kevin Smith had run out of ideas. I was looking forward to this movie – then I saw it. As if re-badging his well-worn shtick wasn’t bad enough Smith thought it would edgy and funny to cast Morisette as God. It was neither, nor was it ironic. Ironically.\n\nHowever the reaction she gets from Ben Affleck when she opens her weirdly oversized mouth is similar to the one I have when hearing her over-wrought warbling on the radio. Plus she somehow manages to overplay the role despite not having lines.\n\nFun fact: neither science nor religion can explain the popularity of Alanis Morrisette’s debut album ‘Jagged Little Pill’ which has sold around 25 million copies. 25 million – think on that.\n\nKayne West – The Love Guru\n\nI hate Mike Myer’s movies. I do not find him funny and I reached a point where if heard one more shitty Austin Powers imitation I was going to cut people.\n\nI can’t say I’m a massive Kayne West fan either. Kind of seems like a dickhead to me.\n\nSo when they team up in this atrocious “comedy” it is fair to say I am not the target demographic – plus Justin Timberlake totally outshines West with his beautiful boyish charm comparatively lighting up the screen.\n\nFun Fact: Kayne was once a telemarketer. No shit, for reals – I didn’t even make that one up.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzKxSIcHdT4\n\nDishonourable mention\n\nI really wanted to put Kylie Minogue on this list somewhere. Whoever told her she could sing has a lot to answer for, and whoever decided she should try movies needs to completely reassess their life. The scene in Biodome where Kylie pretends to fellate a banana is one of the most repulsive and embarrassing moments of one of the worst movies ever made. But her appearance is torturously long and doesn’t qualify as a cameo. Bummer.\n\nThe best of the baddies…\n\n10.Scar (Jeremy Irons)\n\nLion King\n\nEveryone has seen The Lion King. And everyone remembers the death of Mufasa and if you didn’t get a lil bit weepy, well I hate to say it but you have no soul. Yes Scar is a cartoon villain and in my opinion one of the worst and best of all time. That evil ass lion ruined my 10 year old self. Jeremy Irons was the perfect voice to portray Scar, from his leeringly delightful song ‘Be Prepared’ to his perfect manipulation of Simba, convincing the young prince that in a round about way you killed your Daddy. Scar has stood the test of time he is still the best villain in a children’s cartoon and for that he gets the number 10 spot.\n\nBest Line: “I killed Mufasa!”\n\n9.Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden)\n\nThe Mist\n\nI’ve never despised someone so much in a movie as I did Mrs Carmody. Towards the end of The Mist I wanted to jump into the movie and fly kick that bitch right in her condescending mouth. Seriously, watch the movie and tell me I’m wrong. That said, that’s what a good villain is supposed to do. Frank Darabont and Stephen King have given us a truly remarkable villain and Marcia Gay Harden has delivered it to perfection. Picture the biggest bitch ever, then make her a religious psycho and ladies and gentlemen I give you number 9 on this list, Mrs Carmody.\n\nBest Line: “I tell you what. The day I need a friend like you, I’ll just have myself a little squat and shit one out.”\n\n8. Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman)\n\nDie Hard\n\nWe have all seen Die Hard, so we all know how good Hans Gruber is. Hans seems like a nice kinda guy at the start of the movie from talking about his kids and commenting on Mr Takagi’s suits. Then he swiftly puts a bullet into poor Mr Takagi’s head. From his creepy Russian accent to his almost hilarious American accent, Hans nearly steals the show from Bruce. Alan Rickman does a stellar job, and I can’t picture anyone else in this role and that is why he clinches the number 8 spot.\n\nBest Line: “Now I have a machine gun. Ho Ho Ho”\n\n7.Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan)\n\nBraveheart\n\nTwo things you need to know about Longshanks: he hates the Scots and he really, really hates the protagonist of this movie, William Wallace (Mel Gibson). The movie is based on half-truths about the struggles of the Scottish people fighting for freedom against the English. So the audience needs a figure to represent the English, enter Longshanks, the tyrant and King of England. From throwing his sons gay lover out of a window to pretty much wanting all Scottish people to, put simply……….Die. He’s an A-grade arsehole and slots into the number 7 spot (Jerk, and yes I was born in Scotland).\n\nBest Line: “The trouble with Scotland is that is full of Scots.”\n\n6.Darth Vader (Some Dude). (James Earl Jones)\n\nStar Wars\n\nI put this on the list cos I didn’t want gangs of Star Wars nerds tracking me down and swiftly killing me in my sleep. In saying that, George Lucas really has created a timeless, iconic Villain that even after all these years he is still the epitome of evil (the ‘dark side’ if you will). Darth Vader resonates evil from the moment we first see him all dressed in black wearing a pretty intense mask and cape. Mr Vader drops to number 6 on this due to his raspy asthma voice and the fact that he kinda ends up being (spoiler alert) the good guy at the end.\n\nBest Line: “Luke, I am your Father.”\n\n5. The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger)\n\nThe Terminator\n\nForget the other Terminators, Arnie’s original Terminator is a bad ass, humanoid cyborg sent from the future to destroy Sarah Connor. And anyone who gets in his way gets dead real quick. Arnie plays the role to perfection, playing a robot is actually very difficult to achieve. Just ask Daniel Day Lewis, who played the toaster in ‘ Sex in the City 2’. The Terminator is a character with no remorse or conscience, which helps him kill copious amounts of people and destroy a whole police station filled with gun bearing cops. This number 5 spot is well earned.\n\nBest Line: “Your clothes, give them to me …..Now!”\n\n4.Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins)\n\nSilence of the Lambs\n\nIt is literally impossible to have a list like this and not have Dr Lector on it. Anthony Hopkins brought a whole new type of creepy to the table, a clever deadset psycho who, to put it bluntly, eats people. From the evil, whiny voice to the epic scene that makes him remarkably look like a snake, Dr Lector is truly terrifying. While helping the FBI hunt down a serial killer and mind fucking the agent in charge at the same time, Lector manages to escape using someone else’s face as a mask. Enough said. He slots in this list at number 4, would have been higher but remarkably he’s only on screen for nineteen minutes. Crazy right?\n\nBest Line: “I do wish we could chat longer, but….. I’m having an old friend for dinner.”\n\n3. Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes)\n\nDemolition Man\n\nWhat can I say, I’m a sucker for Wesley. This isn’t the tax evading, off the rails, jailbird Wesley, this is the old school bad ass straight-up New Jack Wesley, Snipes. And in Demolition Man he is in full swing. Wesley Snipes plays Simon Phoenix, a criminal from the past that gets released into the future in all his white haired glory. From blowing up a bus full of tourists to using a man to break a glass panel, Wesley is the energiser bunny of the whole movie. It is very rare for the bad guy to be more likeable than the good guy. In this case Sylvester Stallone doesn’t do a bad job, it’s just that Wesley is in fine form and steals the movie. It’s a unique thing to cheer on the villain and in Demolition Man, that is exactly what you do. For that, Wesley Snipes secures his number 3 spot on this list.\n\nBest Line: “Damn. I’m possessed! Wonder if I can play the accordion too…”\n\n2.Joker (Heath Ledger)\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nThe Joker character is a well known one and Jack Nicholson made it his own in the original Batman. When Heath Ledger was cast as the new Joker, I for one was sceptical, since I loved the original Joker. But after the bank scene in the opening 5 minutes of The Dark Knight, I was really digging this new, edgier version of the Joker and after the disappearing pencil trick I literally fell in love with the character. the Joker would have been sub-par if it wasn’t for the amazing portrayal by Heath Ledger. It was an Oscar winning role that made the audience more excited to see him rather than the protagonist of the movie, Batman. When you think of the Joker now you don’t think of the Jack Nicholson version, you think of the Heath Ledger version and that in itself is an achievement. The untimely death of Heath before the movie was released adds more to the edginess of this character and that’s why the Joker lands the number two spot. What a treat!\n\nBest Line: “Why so serious?”\n\n1.Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich)\n\nCon Air\n\nIn my opinion, Nicholas Cage portrays one of the most bad ass people in cinematic history. So they really needed to cast an even badder Villain, enter Cyrus (the Virus) Grissom played beautifully by John Malkovich. When you first meet Cyrus he makes an immediate impression. Apparently he has killed more men than cancer, and I for one believe it. Throughout the movie he grows in stature. There’s nothing worse than a sociopath genius who really enjoys chaos. It’s not often you get to see John Malkovich having this much fun with a movie role. Not many people would have picked this Villain as number 1, but watch Con Air and tell me if you can picture someone else that could have played this role any better. In a group of blood thirsty convicts, Cyrus is the stand out bad guy. Rarely do you encounter a Villain that is likable, fun and dangerous, with the perfect voice to go with the perfect look. Cyrus is a combination of 1 to 9 on this list and for that reason Cyrus takes out the number 1 spot.\n\nBest Line: “Make a move and the Bunny gets it!”\n\nHonourable Mentions:\n\nStephen King’s It (Tim Curry)\n\nGangs of New York, Bill The Butcher Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis)\n\nThe Departed, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson)\n\nGoodfellas, Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci)\n\nBack To The Future, Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson)\n\nSilence of the Lambs, Buffalo Bill (Ted LeVine)\n\nI hope you have enjoyed people, give a reply of what your top ten bad guys are. So I can swiftly say ‘Nah you’re wrong, mine is much better’.\n\nThank you for letting me put my words in you.\n\nDuff\n\nAnyone with a passing interest in recent music history is most likely well aware of what I have somewhat unoriginally dubbed ‘The Nevermind Phenomenon’\n\nNirvana’s Nevermind shifted the paradigm rapidly and irrevocably, it is definitely not a historically unique event in the grand scheme of music, but it is the one that I felt personally aware of and effected by as it happened. I was the target demographic of grunge and all that came with it.\n\nThe story of Nirvana is well documented – they resonated enough with the youth of the day to earn cultural reverence – and millions and millions of dollars. Then Kurt made the tragic decision to take himself out before he either faded or was sucked dry. In the wake of their impact Dave Grohl became the smiliest man in rock with his inoffensive adult rock selling shitloads of units. Krist Novalselic moved back to his little hometown and pursued his love of cake decorating and amateur taxidermy (I cannot actually confirm those are his interests)\n\nOne of the side effects of such a cultural counterpoint and the spotlight it brings are the bands that come to prominence as a result of the increased attention on previously little noticed areas of music. The appetite for an “alternative” was at an all time high – lines were blurred, cheques were written and some very good bands got a real shot as a result – and some others profited beyond their station. Or so says me.\n\nTOP FIVE MOST UNDERRATED TNP ERA BANDS.\n\nSKIN YARD\n\nEvery typhoon of trend would have those who gave the impetus and inspiration but missed out on the fiscal rewards the next generation stumbled into.\n\nWhilst not mentioned in the pantheon of grunge royalty enjoyed by the more visible early efforts of other band’s previous outfits several of the cast that passed through the ranks of the group went on to both impact and be impacted by TNP.\n\nSkin Yard founder Jack Endino has gone on to become a revered pillar of the Seattle music community since the band’s demise in 1992. Endino has carved an impressive career as a producer and has been behind the desk for many, many important albums (listed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Endino_discography) The man’s fingerprints are all over the sound of a scene that altered the boundaries of musical reference.\n\nAfter the breakup Ben McMillan & Scott McCullum concentrated on their side-project Gruntruck with mild success. McMilan has since passed away from diabetes – which whilst not as sexy and profitable for your estate as heroin soaked suicide it was, in this case, sadly just as fatal.\n\nMusically Skin Yard was a breeding ground for drummers who would go on greater fame in other acts – Matt Cameron (Soundgarden, Pearl Jam) Barrett Martin (Screaming Trees, Mad Season) and Jason Finn (who went on to eat millions of peaches in Presidents Of The United States of America)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLWmTw_HTA8\n\nTAD\n\nChunky dudes with chunky riffs, a raw sound and a poor diet – Tad never blew up like so many of their peers. Despite being Seattle locals lumped(comparatively comfortably) into the grunge stable they made music with a slightly metal edge and punk sensibility – the bass heavy thump, screeching guitars and gruff vocal delivery differentiating the huge and hirsute flannel clad men from so many of their more accessible brethren.\n\nWhilst their commercial success and critical recognition was limited the band’s imprint and resume is impressive. The band have recorded with the likes of Jack Endino, Steve Albini & Butch Vig, toured with Nirvana & Soundgarden, released a poor selling but solid major label debut, been sued by Pepsi and banned by MTV. Their lack of pop sense or commercial nous may have put a ceiling on their success and fame but their independent approach, sense of humour and dark sounds mean their place as one of the pre-cursors to a revolution they could never fully capitalise on remains.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0l-Oqabipk\n\nSCREAMING TREES\n\nSitting on the outer edges of “the Seattle sound” due to their unashamed musicality Screaming Trees were the band of choice for more discerning and jaded grunge fans. They are among the cache of bands whose connection to grunge is much more geographical than sonic but who were lazily lumped into the grunge bunch regardless. Soundgarden, Alice In Chains & Pearl Jam are the standard bearers of that tag – all way too polished to be really recognisable as peers to the more loose and lo-fi output of the genre’s darlings.\n\nTheir most prominent moment came from inclusion on the soundtrack to the shallow cash-in that was the movie ‘Single’ However their moment of notoriety came and went without the respect and rewards ever matching their influence.\n\nIn hindsight it is possible to argue that their hard-edge and tinge of psychedelica stands as a bridge of sorts between grunge and stoner rock. The fact that the gravel coated velvet voice of Mark Lanegan has been prominent in both genres adds a little gravitas to this theory.\n\nLanegan’s distinct voice and vocal chops put together with the fact the band could really play meant they were at a disadvantage when sought out by those looking for the loose and raw vibe of grunge but personally I reckon it is also a large reason why the band’s work doesn’t sound too dated now.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjZ_Zz13wC0\n\nMAD SEASON\n\nThis supergroup reportedly formed in rehab and was conceived as a means to try to keep Layne Staley clean – a musical support group of sorts. The band only released the one album and tragically their musical efforts proved vastly more successful than their effectiveness as a sponsor.\n\nThe resulting album has too much filler to be considered a classic but has an interesting range of tracks that are an intriguing snapshot of a moment in the lives of some prominent and tragic players in the music scene.\n\n‘Above’ was put together in just seven days – a fact that is apparent because some tracks can occasionally feel like they are good ideas that haven’t been fully realised. The lyrical work is also among some of Staley’s more generic – a likely result of both the limited timeframe and the man’s mind-frame, he was surely still adjusting to be cognisant and completely conscience\n\nIt is however elevated above the Mendoza line of mediocrity by the apparent lack of agenda and refusal to adhere to genre imposed restrictions that both promoted and plagued the member’s original acts. There is also an experimental feel that is likely a result of the circumstances of its recording. In my opinion the album is also immeasurably aided by the presence of the dulcet tones of Mark Lanegan – a man whose voice is always a welcome point of difference to the screamers and “yarlers” that saturated the scene by that point.\n\nSadly, if somewhat predictably, it was drug abuse that ended any chance for Mad Season to develop upon their debut. The twist being it was bassist John Baker Saunders who overdosed on heroin first – beating Layne to it by around 3 years.\n\nThere was an ill-conceived and ill-fated reunion in 2010 which was likely unnecessary and largely ignored. The band’s single studio record has been dragged out and gussied up a few times over the years to top up the accounts of the members or the label.\n\nDespite these factors holding it back from greatness the group’s boundless approach and the sheer talent among their ranks mean it is an interesting time capsule for the musical moment and a snapshot into a couple of tragically short lives.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJKvE3tMIPs\n\nCARTER THE UNSTOPPABLE SEX MACHINE.\n\nBefore bands with only two members were commonplace and whilst it was still a strange and slightly scary sight to see a group mix rock and electronica Carter USM made urgent and oblique alternative sounds that are still hard to pigeonhole.\n\nManchester was still bubbling away with its rock/dance hybrid sounds and brit-pop was burgeoning but Carter USM stood somewhere between the two unlike either yet straddling the sounds of both. Socially aware and musically original they had a brief period in the sun before fading into the ether.\n\nThe band’s most played track where I lived was ‘Bloodsport For All’ which mixed venom and catchiness with a punk sensibility and disturbing imagery regarding the culture of bullying within the British armed forces. Front man Jim ‘Jim Bob’ Morrison sported the greatest fringe in modern music which he tossed about with abandon as he spat poetic vitriol over programmed beats, samples and synths which were handled by comrade Les ‘Fruitbat’ Carter.\n\nI remember seeing the band live in their heyday and they insisted on their signature white light show blinking meekly at back of stage and an occasional puff from an overworked and underwhelming smoke machine – this is despite playing a mid-arvo festival set. It was this kind of defiant irony that appealed to me whilst confusing the masses and likely played some part in their demise. The band re-invented itself several times during the 90’s but never quite managed to re-bottle the lightening they caught with the creative high-point of their ’30 Something’ album.\n\nWhether the band benefited from the mainstream attention brought about TNP is debatable, but for someone like me whose exposure to this kind of sound would have previously been limited prior to TNP they became a fresh new sound and another band whose t-shirt I could wear to upset and confuse the yokels. They may have suffered from being too hard to categorise, too English and not singing about personally relatable teenage maladies enough but they are undoubtedly namechecked by a generation of genre-benders to follow in their wake\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBQykwk5BUM\n\nTOP FIVE MOST OVERRATED TNP BANDS\n\nGREEN RIVER\n\nSometimes you can never live up to your own myth.\n\nWhen your core members go on to be major components of successful and influential acts like Mudhoney and Pearl Jam you are bound to attract the interest of the industry and the public. But the success found by members beyond this act meant the legend of Green River blew out of proportion when measured against their actual output.\n\nGreen River aren’t terrible but in the cold hard context of history they were more a stepping stone toward future greatness than the unrealised gem they were posthumously sold as. Yes their members played big parts in big bands in years to come but Green River simply were not the defunct underground super-group and could-have-been-champions they were passed off as.\n\nI would maintain that 90% of the albums bought since were by Pearl Jam fans who gave it one disappointed spin and put it away in their CD collection to gather dust. Another 5% were bought by confused stoners who still occasionally break it out and skip through it looking for “that 3 Little Pigs song” and the remaining 5% was purchased by people who went on to actually enjoy the work.\n\nSometimes the sum is greater than its parts.\n\nBut then sometimes it is not.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_XVHkpBaxk\n\nRED HOT CHILI PEPPERS\n\nThese guys started being shit around the time they put on their big boy pants and refused to rock out with their cocks out. Prior to their explosion in popularity they made dangerous funk-rock, wore pants made from stuffed toys and had bulk tattoos (back when ink was still badass.) There is a direct correlation between their rise in popularity and their decline in originality. They discovered the formula for shifting units, diluted their sound with radio-friendliness and eventually disappeared up their own arses. Funk soldiers no more.\n\nWhen the combined musical talents of Flea, John Frusciante and that Will Ferrell lookalike who drums aren’t enough to save you from the lack of talent and excess of ego of Anthony Kiedis you are always going to be behind the 8-ball – an 8-ball that Kiedis would have shot up under a bridge and told us about in a shitty, self-aggrandising book – we get it Anthony – you did drugs and fucked models, you’re a rock star –that is what you are meant to do.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8\n\nL7\n\nL7’s whole shtick was that they were chicks with enough sass to say ‘shit’ in the chorus of their songs and dye their hair. Edgy.\n\nDespite achieving impressive notoriety I highly doubt many people nowadays could name three L7 songs. They apparently were still a thing into the early naughties despite the record buying public having long since moved on.\n\nBut before they disappeared into obscurity the girls managed to ride a small amount of talent and a hefty dose of serendipity as long and hard as they could.\n\nThe notable aspects of their legacy are the fact they sold their most recognisable song (yeah that one with ‘shit’ in it) to anyone who asked nicely and signed a cheque, the time their singer threw a tampon at the crowd at Reading Festival as they stormed off stage due to technical difficulties cruelling their set and the fact they let the world know that bricks are heavy.\n\nKudos to them for milking their opportunity, but be honest – you had forgotten they existed hadn’t you?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCiAYmhJJ70\n\nSILVERCHAIR\n\nInitially a straight out Nirvana cover band (remember the ‘Nirvana in pyjamas jibes’?) who got away it with it due to being innocent mid-pubescent’s who were all adorably angsty & clueless.\n\nBut eventually Daniel Johns discovered eyeliner, ecstasy, synths and the marketability of self-pity. The critics and kids heaped adulation upon them at a rate that had me completely befuddled. The nation and the world guzzled The ‘Chair’s Kool-Aid, praising them up, down and sideways for their breathy and overwrought, overproduced tunes packed with teen-level pun-ridden poetry.\n\nThey achieved success and admiration that was bizarrely out of proportion to their abilities, they gave Triple J Radio enough irrational confidence in their unearthing abilities to continue dredging the depths of a dry well for decades to come and gave hope to all mildly misunderstood teenagers that dropping out of school to pursue their rock star fantasy can lead to getting to dick Natalie Imbruglia and smoke spliffs with Peter Garrett.\n\nAfter a few albums of faux-intellectual catharsis and overly orchestral rock tunes that saw them showered in awards and adulation the thing that finally slowed them down was Daniel Johns’ rampant ego. Johns seemed to believe he had the Midas touch and teamed up with grinning enabler Paul Mac to foist on the people the steamer that was Dissociatives – an act that must have required ridiculous amounts of MDMA to make it listenable.\n\nBut the coke and the lustre wore off and the band are currently in “indefinite hibernation” which is code for either being in rehab or being out of ideas.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZD982yrmx4\n\nSMASHING PUMPKINS\n\nBloated self-indulgent tripe sung in nauseating nasal twang that is aggravating on record and unlistenable live. Punctuated with Billy Corgan’s pseudo-pop phycology, peppered with juvenile metaphors, overflowing with nonsensical ramblings and backed by hyper-production to disguise their lack of actual song writing chops Smashing Pumpkins fooled many into thinking there was some depth to their pompous shite.\n\nThe fact they called their supposedly definitive work ‘Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness’ sums up the kind of confused word salad passed off as poetic resonance that feed my hatred of the band. The high point of Corgan’s supposed lyric genius being rhyming “rage” with “rat in a cage” – what a fucking con.\n\nSoon the market matured and his demographic became more jaded toward to the industry and the shallow transparency of Corgan’s shtick wore thin on his bandmates and apologists. Billy hasn’t really taken the hint and crops every now and again like a cold sore.\n\n. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOG3eus4ZSo\n\nThe Descent\n\nScream your last breath\n\nHey there guys, Duff here with another (in my opinion amazing) movie review. That said movie is The Descent, one of my favourite movies. So I hope you enjoy the review as much as I enjoyed writing it (not very much, this shit takes time).\n\nThe first thing you need to know about this movie is that it was Written and Directed by the legendary Neil Marshall,the guy who brought us cinematic gems such as Doomsday, Dog Soldiers and Centurion. The Descent was his second movie and also his best to date. I recommend watching this movie during the day, or with every light in the house turned on. It’s a scary fucking film.\n\nThe movie begins with some ladies water rafting down a river, I immediately thought I was watching The River Wild but alas there was no Kevin Bacon and it made my heart shrink just a little. Infact, there is only one man in the whole movie, and he leaves the movie in the most unexpected way at the one minute and ten second mark. Girl Power, I’m writing this review with the Spice Girls playing in the backround on full volume, and here’s why.\n\nThe movie centres around Sarah, who a year ealier had a very unwelcome incident (a sweet, sweet car crash), and Juno who gathers Sarah’s friends for an adventure they will never forget. But unknown to Sarah, Juno has a secret which involes her vagina and Sarah’s husband. So out of guilt Juno takes the six girl friends to an adventure weekend retreat, if you call a retreat entering the Earth and exploring an unexplored cave system in hopes of naming the cave after Sarah. That sounds like a good plan, an unexplored cave. What could go wrong?\n\nAs soon as the ladies enter the cave it feels like the bonding experience of a life time. Seriously, why didn’t these ladies have a few vodkas and go bowling. Neil Marshall then uses his craft to the fullest, it feels like your with the six adventurous girls inside what I feel is the worst place on Earth. The movie takes a dramatic turn for the worst when Sarah gets stuck in a tiny, tiny tunnel, and the inevitable cave-in occurs sealing the ladies in the cave.\n\nAs the ladies delve deeper into the cave looking for a way out, the movie gets more and more scary. I started to feel claustraphobic as the movie has little light throughout the cave scenes and suprisingly it works very well. It doesn’t take long for the ladies to realise that they are not alone, at this time I recommend calmly going to your kitchen and gathering a plastic bag to sit on for the remainder of the movie (you will shit yourself). I got a good cardio session in with all the jumping I was doing and my heart was hammering at a concerning rate, so bad was my heart that I died and saw the light. God kinda looks like Gary Busey.\n\nThe creatures the girls are stuck with are scary, both visually and aurally. Neil Marshall has given the viewers an original creature that both seems unlikely and believable and when they strike they become utterly terrifying, humanoid in shape with the hunting techniques of a bat (they use sound to hunt their prey). Seriously, they’re like crackheads with amazing hunting skills and wicked teeth and claws.\n\nThe one thing that is evident throughout the movie is one simple fact. Caves are "
