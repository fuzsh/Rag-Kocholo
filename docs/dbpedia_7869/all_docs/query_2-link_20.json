        "text": "parodies by nacrowe\n\nback in 7th grade when i was living and going to school in NIGERIA, a classmate's mother of all things had a side hustle where she imported compact discs from EUROPE and sold them out of kiosk at a shopping center. i am almost positive that such was where i took a chance on the DELIVERANCE (COLUMBIA, 1994) album by this band id never heard of called CORROSION OF CONFORMITY. in essence, those WIDE-OPEN, DETUNED POWER CHORDS played over that TEMPO pulled way back was my introduction to SLUDGE METAL and STONER ROCK, given that PEPPER KEENAN is arguably at the origins of both SOUNDALIKE genres.\n\nto my understanding, SLUDGE METAL is a NEW ORLEANS concoction inspired by the likes of the MELVINS and all things DOOM METAL to create a SLOW-COOKED gumbo of DOWN-TEMPO GROOVE by the likes of CROWBAR and EYEHATEGOD. STONER ROCK on the other hand is a FUZZED-OUT PUNK ROCK variant that likewise utilized SLOWER TEMPOS and DETUNED GUITARS to assist in aurally describing the huge expanse of SPACE that was the MOJAVE DESERT at nighttime where bands like KYUSS played generator parties. the difference between SLUDGE METAL and STONER ROCK is nuanced but it is there, yet the sounds have both influenced COUNTLESS modern METAL bands that take that WEIGHTY SONIC TEMPLATE and utilize it to provide HEFT and MASS to their SOUND. this is in direct contrast to what MASTERS OF REALITY main-man CHRIS GOSS (and one of the PALM DESERT SCENE architects of the STONER ROCK sound) derided as \"TYPEWRITER METAL\" in which METAL bands like MEGADETH and SLAYER played LIGHTNING-FAST SINGLE-NOTE ARPEGGIATED RHYTHMS that galloped their way through a song with little FEEL or GROOVE. in that sense, having the patience in letting the song actually breathe and articulate its feel in good time is the sonic contribution of these two LIKE-MINDED genres.\n\ni hear the influence in METALCORE bands like CANCER BATS, ARCHITECTS, CAVE IN, LAMB OF GOD, CODE ORANGE and AVENGED SEVENFOLD as well as POST HARDCORE acts like GLASSJAW, AT THE DRIVE-IN, REFUSED and THRICE, all of whom vary TEMPO, FEEL and GROOVE to SPECTACULAR effect.\n\nembedded below is a recent DEER GOD RADIO episode on nonprofit internet radio station MAKERPARKRADIO.NYC that includes a playlist celebrating my FAVORITE SLUDGE METAL and STONER ROCK bands. enjoy!\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\ni am not a RECORDING ENGINEER, but i do love watching people talk about their craft. in the case of the WHAT'S THAT SOUND? series on YOUTUBE produced by online instrument retailer REVERB, the focus is on dissecting and understanding the recording of DRUMS based on REAL-WORLD recorded examples by notable artists ranging from NIRVANA, AMY WINEHOUSE, THE POLICE, JAMES BROWN, SLY & THE FAMILY STONE, IGGY POP, ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA, SOUNDGARDEN, PINK FLOYD, THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE, FIONA APPLE, QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE and THE STROKES among many others. we're talking TECHNIQUES such as MICROPHONE SELECTION, MICROPHONE PLACEMENT, MICROPHONE ANGLES, COMPRESSION, GATING, PHASING, and so on. in way this series is very similar to the fellow REVERB-produced SYNTHS SOUNDS OF [review linked HERE] series that focused on analog and digital synthesizers and their application on MEMORABLE songs mostly from the 1970s and 80s (which is also worth watching).\n\nim aware REVERB here is trying to increase interest for its ANALOG wares, but these videos serve a dual purpose in generating demand while educating its potential future clientele. what comes across again and again is how INGENIOUS these RECORDING ENGINEERS were in PROBLEM-SOLVING for obtaining a DESIRED effect and outcome for their clients, which resulted in INDELIBLE parts that are a fusion of TECHNICAL execution by the musician and EFFECTIVE manipulation of equipment by the producer, often utilizing such in a way that was beyond the limitations of what it was designed to sonically provide.\n\nif anything, watching these ANALOG TECHNIQUES being practiced is way cooler than a plugin. WHAT'S THAT SOUND? is definitely worth checking out.\n\nparodies by nacrowe\n\ni get it.\n\nsome people are sick of the sight of DAVE GROHL. in recent years he has been omnipresent in documentaries related to anything and everything ROCK N ROLL. lazy journalists refer to him as \"the nicest guy in the music industry\" (which makes my lizard brain immediately counter with, yeah, to journalists) and he has become something of the TORCH BEARER for the HUMAN ELEMENT in music writ large during an era of PITCH CORRECTION and DIGITAL MANIPULATION in the production of music. so i get the eye rolls and shirking at yet another testimonial to his supposed GREATNESS.\n\nwhat gets me about GROHL is his capacity to be INCLUSIVE to musicians. he's collaborated on COUNTLESS projects for other artists (MELVINS, EARTHLINGS?, TENACIOUS D, KILLING JOKE, THE PRODIGY, DAVID BOWIE, NINE INCH NAILS), been in numerous bands (NIRVANA, QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, FOO FIGHTERS, SCREAM, THEM CROOKED VULTURES) and initiated projects designed to showcase the talents of others like PROBOT (LEMMY KILMISTER, MAX CAVALERA, KING DIAMOND, WINO, CRONOS), TEENAGE TIME KILLERS (JELLO BIAFRA, NEIL FALLON, MATT SKIBA, RANDY BLYTHE) and the SOUND CITY soundtrack (LEE VING, PAUL MCCARTNEY, RICK SPRINGFIELD, CHRIS GOSS, STEVIE NICKS). oh yeah and he made the FOO FIGHTERS record an album of straight-up FUNKY BEE-GEE covers. you should be dancing, indeed.\n\nits one thing to be an advocate for a community, another entirely to put ENERGY into being a CREATIVE RESOURCE for them to access. GROHL, given his unique cultural cache and commercial success with NIRVANA and FOO FIGHTERS, has time and again leveraged such a platform to spotlight those around him and causes he believes in. i just dont see it as SELFISH. the man has gone through more than his share of suffering from the very public premature passing of his friends and former bandmates that would crush less a person. hes carried on the spirit and legacy of his friend KURT COBAIN for decades and i imagine the same will be the case with TAYLOR HAWKINS. all i can say is godspeed.\n\nembedded below is a DEER GOD RADIO episode on nonprofit internet radio station MAKERPARKRADIO.NYC that originally aired at the end of 2021. the playlist includes music from throughout theDAVE GROHL's infamous catalogue. enjoy!\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\nthe severe TRAUMA and PAIN involved with sustaining a major LOSS, along with the GRIEVING PROCESS thereafter, can be a seemingly ALL-ENCOMPASSING and an immeasurably TORTUROUS experience. i cant even begin to imagine or empathize with the sheer depths of SORROW that musician ALAIN JOHANNES went through when he lost his wife and CREATIVE collaborator NATASHA SHNEIDER to CANCER in 2008.\n\nif you are unfamiliar with the name JOHANNES, you may be more familiar with his work writing and supporting ALTERNATIVE ROCK juggernaut QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE as well as THEM CROOKED VULTURES, MARK LANEGAN, PJ HARVEY, ARCTIC MONKEYS and CHRIS CORNELL's early solo career among other NOTABLE projects. interestingly, while still in high school in LOS ANGELES he led an INFLUENTIAL group called WHAT IS THIS? that had fellow classmates and future RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS musicians HILLEL SLOVAK, JACK IRONS and FLEA as members. after meeting SHNEIDER, he started a new duo called WALK THE MOON and then later, after the PASSING of SLOVAK from a HEROIN OVERDOSE a few years later, IRONS left the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS and joined JOHANNES and SHNEIDER in a new group called ELEVEN. more so than his high profile gigs, ELEVEN is the DEFINITIVE project of his career as a musician given the deep TELEPATHIC and almost ALCHEMICAL INTIMACY that he shared with his wife on a PERSONAL, EMOTIONAL and MUSICAL LEVEL. that INTENSE RAPPORT is understandably why he felt so severely BEREAVED and spiritually ISOLATED from the world and his formerly whole self.\n\nhaving lived an extremely PERIPATETIC existence myself as a child moving from hemisphere to hemisphere, there is something about being a THIRD CULTURE KID that makes you extremely ADAPTABLE with the uncanny ability to make HOME anywhere. yet at the same there is a ROOTLESSNESS that takes hold, the idea that you may be a citizen of everywhere but in reality NOWHERE. i implicitly understand that perspective and how finding such a POWERFUL partner intrinsically grounds you on so many levels, many unspoken and unconscious. JOHANNES being a polyglot and having lived in eight countries growing up while not knowing his birth father feels even to me like a heavy BURDEN to bear. it makes sense that he grew to be such an EMPATHETIC songwriter and sought after musical collaborator. its all very in keeping with truly being a THIRD CULTURE KID.\n\nthe documentary UNFINISHED PLAN: THE PATH OF ALAIN JOHANNES (GRAVITAS VENTURES, 2016) is very much centered around that AGONY and his road to finding SOLACE and MEANING anew in the world, even after the DEATHS of his partner, his mother and his birth father. participants in this film include close friends and collaborators including every member of SOUNDGARDEN (i.e. CHRIS CORNELL, KIM THAYIL, BEN SHEPHERD and MATT CAMERON) as well as JOSH HOMME (KYUSS, QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, THEM CROOKED VULTURES), MARK LANEGAN (SCREAMING TREES), DAVE CATCHING (EARTHLINGS?, RANCHO DE LA LUNA recording studio) and ALEX TURNER (ARCTIC MONKEYS). what i found interesting was that JOHANNES discovering CHILEAN roots and being immediately embraced by their artistic and musical communities was both grounding and a REJUVENATING wellspring of HOPE, OPTIMISM and INSPIRATION in his life during what was undoubtedly a BLEAK PERIOD. that warm embrace of a country he had no connection to outside of being born there and speaking the language provided a sense of CONNECTION when i can only imagine his instinct was to RETREAT and ISOLATE himself. its all very moving and in keeping with what i have experienced about the people having lived in SOUTH AMERICA.\n\nultimately music is about CREATION and CONNECTION. its such a uniquely human enterprise in that regard. the greater community that supports such endeavors (musicians, recording engineers, concert promoters, independent radio, fans) at least provide a framework for REINTEGRATING oneself not only with a global audience, but with themselves and their own emotions. this film in my opinion is more about that search for CONNECTION and MEANING in spite of tremendous GRIEF and PAIN, rather than the TRAUMA itself.\n\nmusic can do that. or at least start the conversation.\n\nRIP NATASHA SCHNEIDER, HILLEL SLOVAL, MARK LANEGAN & CHRIS CORNELL\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\nas some of you know, my cousin BRIAN is a recording engineer with production credits ranging from MACMILLER, A$AP FERG, and CLAMS CASINO to YEASAYER, DIRTY PROJECTORS, NEIL FINN and RAIN MACHINE among many others. when DEER GOD was still a viable entity as a recording studio a few years back, i had a front row seat to witness both IN-THE-BOX PRODUCTION via PRO TOOLS as well as the interplay of mixing such with our modified MTA 980 console.\n\nin the years since, watching the CELEBRATED veteran recording engineer ERIC VALENTINE (QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, DEATH FROM ABOVE 1979, GOOD CHARLOTTE, THE DWARVES, TAKING BACK SUNDAY, SMASHMOUTH, THIRD EYE BLIND, THE ALL-AMERICAN REJECTS) deconstruct his WORKFLOW and RECORDING TECHNIQUES at length and in EXHAUSTIVE detail on his MAKING RECORDS WITH ERIC VALENTINE YOUTUBE channel has been an equally EDUCATIONAL experience for an interested layman like me. its also pretty COOL to see the amount of overlap with what my cousin used to do regarding computer PLUG-INS, MICROPHONE PLACEMENT and other general RECORDING STRATEGIES.\n\nVALENTINE has recently begun publishing new content on his YOUTUBE channel after an extended break that saw him sell off his longtime BAREFOOT RECORDING STUDIO in LOS ANGELES and moved with his wife to VERMONT where he converted a large barn on their property into an EXTENSIVE recording facility. in honor of such reengagement, i wanted to post some past video \"production deconstructions\" of NOTABLE songs he's either engineered, produced and/or mixed. i find this stuff FASCINATING, especially when it comes to the THOUGHT and EXPERIMENTATION that goes into capturing MEMORABLE sounds that fit the intent and vibe of his client's songs. you really get a PALPABLE sense of the ARTISTRY involved with bringing your favorite recordings to life beyond just the physical performance of such. there is so much more involved in he PRODUCTION of such. i also included two INSTRUCTIONAL videos he did for the SOUND ON SOUND magazine's YOUTUBE channel a half decade ago that saw him both explain how he utilized reverb chambers and a myriad of amps to create lush aural textures, such as \"GOD OF WINE\" on THIRD EYE BLIND's debut THIRD EYE BLIND (ELEKTRA, 1996) album as well as EQ'ing those ICONIC fuzzed-out tones on QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE's iconic SONGS FOR THE DEAF (INTERSCOPE, 2002) album. fun stuff.\n\nwhats so cool about VALENTINE is his VERSATILITY, creating both irredeemably CAUSTIC and DOWN-AND-DIRTY PUNK ROCK a la THE DWARVES as well as the immaculately orchestrated SURF ROCK palettes of more pop fair by the likes of SMASH MOUTH at their peak. it is beyond INCREDIBLE that the same dude is responsible for producing such DISPARATE sounds from seemingly opposite ends of the ROCK N ROLL spectrum.\n\nat the very least, his YOUTUBE channel is worth checking out. if not also his extensive production catalogue as well. enjoy!\n\nphoto manipulation & text by nacrowe\n\ni discovered the JUSTIN HAWKINS RIDES AGAIN channel a few months ago on YOUTUBE and was really taken aback by how INFORMATIVE it all was. if you are unfamiliar with JUSTIN HAWKINS, he is the frontman and main songwriter for BRITISH ALTERNATIVE glam metal band THE DARKNESS who first came to fame in the 2000s along with the wave of other INDIE ROCK REVIVAL groups. whereas other ENGLISH and SCOTTISH groups from the period (including BLOC PARTY, FRANZ FERDINAND, THE LIBERTINES, THE FUTUREHEADS and THE CRIBS) seemed heavily influenced by both the POST PUNK and INDIE ROCK movements, THE DARKNESS felt like a breath of fresh air with their stadium-sized AMBITION to be more in the vein AC/DC, MOTLEY CRUE, AEROSMITH, THE CULT or especially QUEEN. they definitely stood apart and where not afraid to look absolutely RIDICULOUS (which i appreciate)! personally i still rock DARKNESS singles like \"GROWING ON ME,\" \"OPEN FIRE,\" \"NOTHIN'S GONNA STOP US,\" \"BARBARIANS,\" \"ROCK AND ROLL DESERVES TO DIE\" and \"LAST OF OUR KIND\" on regular rotation while driving to work, i just have to watch my speed in the process.\n\nthe JUSTIN HAWKINS RIDES AGAIN channel is reminiscent of RICK BEATO's channel in that HAWKINS also dives into and EXPLAINS music theory and recording / production techniques on popular songs. what differentiates it though is his sense of self-effacing HUMOR that knowingly showcases the ABSURDITY of his life's work as well as his unbridled capacity to call out musicians and industry participants. and he does such from a place of EMPATHY. in other words, he has actual first-hard EXPERIENCE being a ROCK N ROLL star and its that kind of insider KNOWLEDGE that makes his YOUTUBE channel FASCINATING. HAWKINS' channel appears to be a way of BYPASSING a BRITISH press that has long abandoned and even mocked his musical efforts. its rather BEAUTIFUL that an artist in today's DIGITAL ecosystem has the ability to CULTIVATE and COMMUNICATE directly with an audience sans middlemen and gatekeepers.\n\ni feel its also great that he has used this new platform to promote artists he's discovered (sometimes even through his audience). it was through him that i became aware of two INCREDIBLE modern AUSTRALIAN PUNK bands, THE CHATS and AMYL & THE SNIFFERS. if anything, i tend to rely on HAWKINS through his channel as a vehicle for DISCOVERING new bands, which is always a fun thing. my hope is that HAWKINS continues to be PROLIFIC with his channel and further PROMOTE an INCLUSIVE community that follows his lead as a highly IDIOSYNCRATIC, but musically KNOWLEDGEABLE and stylistically OPEN-MINDED guide to new cultural ideas and sonic terrains.\n\ni look forward to seeing where HAWKINS takes this.\n\nphoto manipulation & text by nacrowe\n\nlike a lot of people, i was pretty bummed when the INDEPENDENT NEW JERSEY record store VINTAGE VINYL closed abruptly seemingly without warning in the middle of the summer of 2021. i had been going there for years since the early 2000s when i effectively relocated to the area for college after randomly spending my senior year of high school in SACRAMENTO. in fact part of my yearly ritual during my years teaching abroad was a trip to VINTAGE VINYL during my brief stateside vacation. id even argue the experience made me feel connected to a sense of \"home.\"\n\ni remember learning about the FORDS, NEW JERSEY store through a plugged-in classmate and friend of my brother, who were both still in high school at the time. in the early 2000s there was an UNDERGROUND ROCK N ROLL scene that centered around RUTGERS UNIVERSITY in NEW BRUNSWICK that included bands of varying genres (POST-HARDCORE, POP PUNK, HARDCORE and METALCORE) from various relatively nearby northeast cities such as THE DILLINGER ESCAPE PLAN (MORRIS PLAINS), THURSDAY (NEW BRUNSWICK), MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE (NEWARK), MIDTOWN (NEW BRUNSWICK), STREETLIGHT MANIFESTO (NEW BRUNSWICK) as well as more established acts like THE BOUNCING SOULS (BASKING RIDGE) and LIFETIME (NEW BRUNSWICK) among others. interestingly bands like THE GASLIGHT ANTHEM (NEW BRUNSWICK) and THE SCREAMING FEMALES (NEW BRUNSWICK) also came from the embers of this scene years later.\n\nVINTAGE VINYL was only a ten minute drive from the heavily congested streets of the NEW BRUNSWICK campus and proved to be quite the quiet respite during my years as an undergraduate there. i can only imagine what that store meant to musicians from the surrounding area. did i mention the place also put on in-store promotional shows for UNDERGROUND and established bands? i recently came across their YOUTUBE channel which has in-store live performances by the likes of everyone from BAD RELIGION, CAVE-IN, THE USED, MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE, JIMMY EAT WORLD, CIRCA SURVIVE, MXPX, THE GET UP KIDS, THURSDAY, NEW FOUND GLORY and QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE (all embedded below) among many others. if you dig through their channel you will find in-store signings by the likes of OZZY OSBOURNE, DESCENDENTS, KERRY KING (of SLAYER), DARRYL \"DMC\" MCDANIELS (of RUN-DMC) and ROB ZOMBIE. its all unedited single shot tripod footage with unmixed in-camera audio. in essence its mostly uncompelling, shitty footage, except for the fact that as a cultural artifact these videos are invaluable as markers of a local and national musical culture at a certain place and time.\n\nwhats sad is that the hurried manner in which the store closed, at the behest of the owner who wished to move on after 40+ years and had no interest in having it continue under new management, effectively meant that a community had no opportunity to celebrate it. there was no send-off or concert by the local musical community that no doubt had embraced this obscure INDEPENDENT establishment for many years. for me that is the unfortunate legacy of VINTAGE VINYL. it was a private, locally-owned business that was embraced by a culture and in the end the owner did not embrace them back.\n\nin the wake of VINTAGE VINYL there are several local and independently owned and operated record stores (some new, some long established) in NEW JERSEY that i frequent which have largely replaced it, including STATION 1 BOOKS & VINYL (POMPTON LAKES), REVILLA GROOVES & GEAR (MILLTOWN), LOFIDELIC RECORDS (BELMAR), VINYL ADDICTION RECORDS (NORTH ARLINGTON), FACTORY RECORDS SHOP (DOVER), SOUND EXCHANGE (WAYNE), GROOVY GRAVEYARD (ASBURY PARK), JACK'S MUSIC SHOPPE (RED BANK), THE RECORD COLLECTOR (BORDENTOWN) and yes, even the dreaded PRINCETON RECORD EXCHANGE (PRINCETON). id also include the NEW YORK record stores GENERATION RECORDS (GREENWICH VILLAGE), ACADEMY RECORD ANNEX (GREENPOINT) and LOONEY TUNES (WEST BABYLON) as well as the PHILADELPHIA store REPO RECORDS (SOUTH STREET) in the mix as well. unfortunately none of these stores have live in-store performances at the same level of impact as VINTAGE VINYL.\n\na little over a year later it still feels like a loss.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\nat this point there is a whole cottage industry of DAVE GROHL-directed media products, from documentaries (SOUND CITY, WHAT DRIVES US) to tv shows (SONIC HIGHWAYS, FROM CRADLE TO STAGE) to his recent memoir THE STORYTELLER: TALES OF LIFE AND MUSIC (DEY STREET, 2021). oh yeah, and he makes music.\n\nGROHL obviously has one of the most storied careers of any modern musician, having cut his teeth as a teen with the 1980s DC HARDCORE stalwarts SCREAM before serendipitously joining the legendary 1990s ALTERNATIVE ROCK group NIRVANA and then forming his own band, FOO FIGHTERS, after their demise. he's collaborated with everyone from LEMMY KILMISTER and TRENT REZNOR to CAT POWER and JOHN PAUL JONES. his side projects include PROBOT, THEM CROOKED VULTURES and a brief stint in QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE. but most music fans are familiar with his biography.\n\nand i believe he knows that, which is why his memoir is not a straight chronological telling of his personal narrative, but rather notable moments or vignettes told in sequential order. structurally it was very reminiscent of A HOUSE ON MANGO STREET. and i think such was a smart idea because it freed him to really dive into the meaning of certain rights of passage of his youth and that of his family without having to worry about how they fit into a broader context. again, most of these stories are familiar to anyone who has watched or read his interviews over the years or even read former KERRANG! editor PAUL BRANNIGAN's laboriously compiled biography THIS IS A CALL: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DAVE GROHL (review linked HERE). what THE STORYTELLER provides is a perspective of a ROCK AND ROLL life rooted in family. GROHL goes to great lengths to show that his love of music was almost a manifestation of his unconditional love for his mother, who supported and sacrificed tirelessly on his behalf (a contrast to that of his father). but beyond his mother, his love of music connected him to an ever widening mandala of similarly minded friends that includes both the famous and the obscure; and they are both written about with equal wit and empathy. his childhood friend JIMMY SWANSON is as much a part of his personal narrative (perhaps more so) as that of KURT COBAIN, which is very endearing. given his public profile and immense cultural influence, it was likewise heartwarming to see GROHL give respect to his predecessors and influences: from NEIL PEART, PAUL MCCARTNEY and JOHN BONHAM, to LITTLE RICHARD, JOHN FOGERTY, AC/DC and JOAN JETT. even numerous obscure HARDCORE bands from his youth. THE STORYTELLER is in essence a vehicle for shining a light on the connective, reinvigorating force that is music, which is a common returning theme in all of his film and tv projects. by extension music makes everyone kin. everyone is connected on the same wavelength.\n\naside from its focus on musicians, the core of what i found engaging about THE STORYTELLER is how music connects him with his children. how he takes inspiration from their courage to perform publicly in front of their school peers during their elementary years or how they relate to it on the same emotional wavelength that he does. this made me think about how i have that same musical relationship with my dad and how for GROHL and his children THE BEATLES are that connection point, THE STRANGLERS and THE SMITHS are the same with my father. i havent read about that intergenerational connection in any previous rock memoir, maybe with the exception of KEITH RICHARDS and his mother in LIFE (review linked HERE). i should point out that i found it odd that GROHL mentions his wife in passing (unlike his mother and daughters). it was an interesting omission.\n\ni thoroughly enjoyed this book and its focus on family and the nature of human connection through music or more elementally, love. i know most readers just want to hear COBAIN stories, but i thought he walked that line of audience expectation adroitly and with much care and empathy. THE STORYTELLER is well worth reading and i look forward to future non-musical efforts by GROHL and his ever expanding army of collaborators.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\ngiven DAVE GROHL's reputation for being an affable, righteous dude i had some initial misgivings about reading the biography THIS IS A CALL: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DAVE GROHL (DA CAPO, 2011) by former KERRANG! editor PAUL BRANNIGAN. i was worried it would veer towards hagiography, especially given author's decades-long relationship interviewing and covering the towering ALTERNATIVE ROCK musician. but i am glad to report that THIS IS A CALL is a pretty even-handed accounting of GROHL's sprawling career up to the point of the FOO FIGHTERS' WASTING LIGHT (ROSWELL RECORDS, 2011) record a decade ago. this book is unauthorized but includes interviews with past band members and the man himself, many culled from past publications and documentaries, but also from BRANNIGAN himself.\n\ni should state that i have read numerous NIRVANA books at this point, but what makes this book interesting is obviously seeing it from GROHL's perspective. at this point in 2021 GROHL is effectively the flag-waving elder-statesman of ROCK AND ROLL writ large. this has only been further cemented given his actions over the past decade (since this book's publication) in connecting more and more musicians and their stories to a wider audience with his personal television (SONIC HIGHWAYS) and documentary projects (SOUND CITY, WHAT DRIVES US).\n\nso it is interesting being taken along for the ride with GROHL, as his story in popular culture is so unavoidably intertwined with his time in NIRVANA and its doomed frontman KURT COBAIN. and that is unfortunate, because the sense you get from THIS IS A CALL is that for GROHL the defining relationship of his life is with music itself. time and time again you sense that for him music was a means of community, escape, passion and above all else, fun. like COBAIN, GROHL lived a childhood marked by divorce. unlike COBAIN, GROHL grew up in a nurturing, supportive environment. my sense is that PUNK ROCK to GROHL represented an extended family/community of like-minded individuals with a similar pragmatic DIY ethos towards life and art. i am not sure that was the case for COBAIN, who seemed to have boundless ambition maybe in hopes of proving his value. im playing armchair psychiatrist here, and i probably shouldnt, but it seems obvious from the get-go that GROHL never had the same hangups or guilt in following his musical ambitions, especially post-NIRVANA.\n\nagain, from the beginning GROHL's enthusiasm was all about chasing the fun of playing music. as a child he became aware of the neighboring DC HARDCORE scene and started teenage bands in his native VIRGINIA. from his first serious project in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE to his stints in other outfits like DAIN BRAMAGE and local PUNK legends SCREAM, you get the sense these experiences provided him a vocabulary about how to interact with others. and obviously the musical shorthand faired him well in his later career with outside projects (THEM CROOKED VULTURES, PROBOT, LATE!, QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE), session work (GARBAGE, NINE INCH NAILS, SLASH, DAVID BOWIE, KILLING JOKE and TENACIOUS D) and soundtrack work (TOUCH, RISING SUN: THE LEGEND OF SKATEBOARDER CHRISTIAN HOSOI).\n\nbut a lot of this i already knew, what made this book interesting for me where the details about how if personal life affected his lyrical content in the first few records. there are several songs i didnt read as autobiographical that now i can plainly see were. i also appreciate the fact that BRANNIGAN didnt shy away from presenting GROHL at times as being highly opportunistic and unempathetic to the feelings of his \"friends\" like former FOO FIGHTERS WILLIAM GOLDSMITH and FRANZ STAHL, both unceremoniously booted with little patience or grace, just echos and silence.\n\nif anything, this biography is a great primer for GROHL's upcoming memoir which will highlight stories from his career. make sense, the dude is about connecting people. it is what makes him, well, him.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\nSING BACKWARDS AND WEEP (HATCHETTE, 2020) is probably one of the more harrowing memoirs i have ever come across. its author MARK LANEGAN, gifted singer/songwriter and former frontman of SEATTLE ALTERNATIVE ROCK icons SCREAMING TREES, recounts an drug-addled existence that ranged from the 1980s through his final successful rehab stint in the early 2000s. and that addiction literally cost him everything he valued: relationships, collaborations, touring opportunities, friends, love, money. the list goes on and it is brutal.\n\nthere is no doubt that many who investigate this book are interested in the PACIFIC NORTHWEST INDIE/PUNK music scene that exploded in the early 1990s, of which LANEGAN was a central figure within. there is some ink here dedicated to his relationships with other participants such as KURT COBAIN (NIRVANA) and LAYNE STALEY (ALICE IN CHAINS), but the real dominant actor here is DRUGS. and by that i mean literally every make and stripe. COBAIN, STALEY as well as numerous other victims such as KRISTEN PFAFF (HOLE) and JEFFREY LEE PIERCE (THE GUN CLUB) are integral to his narrative in that they exemplify the cost of participation in this downward spiral of needless suffering.\n\nLANEGAN is unflinching in his account and i have no doubt that writing this must have been cathartic. it also no doubt took courage to look at himself and unshrinkingly scrutinize his life's decisions and make them public without being patronizing or worse glorifying said behavior. he seems to be a reliable narrator as he relates how the ever-present threat of dope-sickness and withdrawal effectively corrupted his moral compass and led to a never ending search for a fix to maintain his equilibrium and all its attendant decisions that resulted in the suffering of others.\n\nin HUBERT SELBY JR novels there is often an inverse character arc at play whereby as the individual descends into MADNESS, it is their affliction (FAME, POWER, DRUGS, etc.) that prevails in equivalent fashion. for me that is the feeling i get when considering the SEATTLE drug scene and its effect on several key participants in this book, COBAIN and STALEY being the prime examples.\n\nthere is a light and that is the MUSICIANS' ASSISTANCE PROGRAM that effectively saved LANEGAN's life. that and his ability to forgive himself and the capacity for other addicts to enable each other in recovery, here COURTNEY LOVE (HOLE) and DUFF MCKAGAN (GUNS N' ROSES) being such examples. you get the sense that despite the absolute depths of DEPRAVITY that drug addicts wade through, that there is an opportunity for RESTORATION. that we can always be REHABILITATED, RECONSTRUCTED and REINVIGORATED by our choices and actions moving forward.\n\ncontrary to what others may read into this memoir, i found it inspiring, compassionate and intensely optimistic. maybe this book is his way of paying it forward."
