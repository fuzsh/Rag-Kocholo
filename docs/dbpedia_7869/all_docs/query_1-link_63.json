        "text": "HAVING led the Screaming Trees in the late 80s and hitting some highs with the band in the grunge heyday of 90’s Seattle, Mark Lanegan has been at this for a while.\n\nAlthough rated as one of the best bands of the Seattle scene, they never courted the same commercial success as many of their contemporaries.\n\nLanegan appears to care not a jot about commercial success. He clearly isn’t in this for fortune or fame and prefers to do what is important to him and that is making music.\n\nHis solo repertoire that we are treated to with almost all of the songs coming off of his 5 solo albums.\n\nHaving spent a few years with Queens of the Stone Age at the turn of the century and contributing lead vocals when the band was producing some of their best work, Lanegan’s voice is arguable his greatest asset and stands out on many of the songs tonight.\n\nCollaboration is the norm for Lanegan who has worked extensively with Greg Dulli of Afghan Whigs fame, including as The Twilight Singers and tonight Deepest Shade is performed from that partnership.\n\nIf you were coming to Lanegan’s current solo stuff fresh from his grunge days, you might be surprised to hear keyboards featuring heavily on some of his best songs.\n\nA regular contributor to Electronica duo Soulsavers, it would seem that Lanegan has developed a penchant for the sound.\n\nPerhaps this should be unsurprising given he has worked with Moby, Massive Attack, PJ Harvey, Warpaint and countless others.\n\nTonight a sold out Garage on Glasgow’s Sauchiehall Street certainly made their appreciation for his work clear.\n\nLanegan also has a musical connection to Glasgow having collaborated on three very good albums with Isobel Campbell, once of Belle and Sebastian, including the excellent Ballad of the Broken Seas which is an incredible vehicle was his amazing voice.\n\n2014’s critically acclaimed Phantom Radio is an outstanding album and hearing much of it live tonight it’s easy to see why it garnered rave reviews and 5 stars ratings.\n\nDeath Trip to Tulsa really stands out tonight as does The Killing Season which features in tonight’s encore.\n\nSo how do you follow it up? More of the same!\n\nGargoyle, released earlier this year, is every bit a match for its predecessor.\n\nThe music mags have validated it and the Lanegan fans in attendance tonight have no doubts about its quality.\n\nGoodbye to Beauty, a heartbreaking love song, a grooving Death Head Tattoo and a rocking Beehive highlight the varied nature of this excellent album.\n\nThe new album features 10 tracks and includes appearances from long time collaborators Josh Homme, Greg Dulli and Duke Garwood but it is Lanegan’s distinctive baritone voice that both booms and caresses, making the album quintessentially Mark Lanegan.\n\nThe tin lid on a fantastic night at the garage saw The Mark Lanegan Band finish with a phenomenal rendition of Joy Division’s Love Will Tear Us Apart.\n\nWith further European dates to come and an appearance at Glastonbury looming before heading back to the US for a full tour, there are plenty of opportunities to get out and see The Mark Lanegan Band and I strongly suggest to take one up!"
