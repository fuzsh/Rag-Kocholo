        "text": "Back in February 2022, music as a whole took a major hit with the passing of musician, author, singer and songwriter Mark Lanegan. Known predominantly for his work with Screaming Trees and his multiple cameos on Queens of the Stone Age records over the years, it was a sad day to learn that he died so young at 57 years old.\n\nNow, more than two years later, the world is getting some new material from the late artist. According to an announcement made by Lanegan’s estate, a dozen previously unreleased songs will be included in an upcoming Bubblegum boxset to celebrate the album’s 20th anniversary.\n\nIncluded in the set will be the aforementioned 12 unreleased tracks, as well as a remastered version of Bubblegum, and a 64-page hardcover book featuring essays from Lanegan’s surviving bandmates and past collaborators. Some of the individuals involved in the project include QotSA frontman Josh Homme, Guns N’ Roses’ Duff McKagan, and The Afghan Whigs’ Greg Dulli.\n\nSpeaking of the unreleased songs, Queens of the Stone Age guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Troy Van Leeuwen said the tracks were at one point “basically forgotten,” but that he was able to find them in his archives after learning of Lanegan’s passing.\n\n“So these hotel demo sessions were basically forgotten…\n\n“When I heard the news of Mark’s passing, these memories started rushing back to me. I searched through my archive of drives and somehow magically was able to open up these sessions. The original rough mixes are a real time capsule that stands up to the 20 years that have passed. It’s a true gift from Mark to those of us who love him and his unvarnished expression of beauty. With every listen, I am humbled and honored to share his gift with you.”\n\nRumors had been swirling for a bit in recent days that something like this could be underway, thanks to a social media post on Lanegan’s accounts. In one post in particular, there’s a shot of the legendary Abbey Road Studios where the album’s remastering was done.\n\nAt this moment, we don’t know when the boxset will be released, only that it will have those things in them when it’s finally available for sale."
