        "text": "Abrams: Blue City (2024)\n\nThrough little fault of their own, Denver, Colorado's Abrams got off on the wrong foot with me because their moniker challenges AC/DC's fixed and non-negotiable position at the very front of my alphabetically- and chronologically-organized record collection.\n\nI mean, what would possess any band to choose a name starting with the letters 'A' and 'B'?\n\nAll kidding aside (note: I'm really NOT kidding), 2024's Blue City is Abrams' fifth long-player since their debut in 2015, and that's evident in the confident wall of sound unleashed by Zachary Amster (vocals, guitar), Taylor Iversen (bass, vocals), Ryan DeWitt (drums), and recent addition Graham Zander (guitar, vocals).\n\nBut there's a catch: despite their association with iconic stoner rock labels like Small Stone and, in this case, Blues Funeral, the quartet's, precise, densely layered, interwoven guitars owe just as much to '90s alternative rock, in my opinion.\n\nExpertly recorded and produced by Kurt Ballou (Converge, High On Fire, etc., etc.), typical six-string symphonies like \"Fire Waltz,\" \"Wasting Time,\" and the tectonic title track actually remind me of the Smashing Pumpkins and Hum, as well as Floridian thunder-pop purveyors Torche (who also happen to be Ballou clients).\n\nFor their part, the dissonant guitars of \"Turn it Off\" and \"Etherol\" mimic Nirvana and Soundgarden, respectively, while \"Death Om\" and \"Narc\" integrate space rock textures, but that's frankly about as close as Abrams get to bona fide stoners like Kyuss or Monster Magnet.\n\nAll this being said, far more important than these sonic comparisons is the impressively high standards of Abrams' songwriting, which may not innovate much but recycles influences into consistently engaging material that rarely falters from start to finish.\n\nHeck, if I were younger, still consuming a lot of brand-new music (almost impossible to process in today's all-you-can-eat streaming era), and could be bothered to make lists and bold pronouncements, this would probably be an 'Album of the Year' candidate for me!\n\nNot bad for a band whose name I objected to from the outset, but don't worry, I'm not an amoral Alphabet Tyrant ...\n\nHaving sampled and confirmed the quality of its alternative/stoner rock, Blue City will simply have to join fellow alphabetical \"offenders\" like Aardvark, Abattoir, Absent in Body, and Absu in my vinyl shelf no-man's-land between AC/DC and Accept.\n\nSurely, there are worse fates than that!\n\nMore Latter-Day Stoner Rock & Alternative Rock: Bask’s American Hollow, Elbrus’ Elbrus, Elephant Tree’s Elephant Tree, Foo Fighters’ Wasting Light, Gozu’s The Fury of a Patient Man, House of Broken Promises’ Using the Useless, My Sleeping Karma’s My Sleeping Karma, Queens of the Stone Age’s Lullabies to Paralyze, Royal Thunder’s CVI, Sigiriya’s Return to Earth, Snail’s Feral, Totimoshi’s Milagrosa, Wo Fat’s The Black Code, Zen Guerrilla’s Shadows On the Sun.\n\nGoatsnake: Goatsnake Vol. 1 (1999)\n\nI was ALL IN on '90s stoner rock -- Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Fu Manchu, you name it! -- and, before that, classic doom -- Trouble, Candlemass, Black Fucking Sabbath, etc. -- but Goatsnake barely registered on my radar because, well, how can I put this?\n\nI just didn't think they were very good.\n\nGoatsnake formed in 1996, when the recently disbanded The Obsessed rhythm section of bassist Guy Pinhas and drummer Greg Rogers began jamming with guitarist Greg Anderson, previously of Thorr's Hammer, Burning Witch, and countless other bands.\n\nFor their frontman, the trio chose a rather unconventional, certainly unexpected, approach in former Scream and Wool frontman Pete Stahl, then got to work on a couple of 7-inches, the Sabbath-referencing IV and Man of Light -- both issued in 1998.\n\nNow, don't forget that, at the time, Anderson and his frequent partner Stephen O'Malley were only just launching their own influential label, Southern Lord, and their iconic drone project Sunn O))), so Goatsnake was very much Anderson's priority.\n\nBut, as I said at the top of this blog, '99's Goatsnake Vol. 1 didn't impress me all that much, and I had no plans to revisit, nor to possibly revise my original opinion, until I found this vinyl reissue at a bargain price.\n\nAnd, yes, it helped that the album's embarrassing original artwork, featuring a Viking ship sailing under a Confederate Flag (already in bad taste years before these were justifiably canceled), had been replaced by the classy, silver-on-black design seen here.\n\nNote how that the font treatment echoes Sunn O)))'s sound waves ...\n\nAnyway, sorry to keep you in suspense, but I'm afraid that a quarter-century has done little to ameliorate my original assessment of mediocre doom grinds like \"IV,\" \"Lord of Los Feliz,\" \"Trower\" (the string section was a nice touch, I suppose), and the frankly ridiculous \"Dog Catcher.\"\n\nAlong with comparative \"highlights\" like the moderately galloping \"Slippin' the Stealth,\" the harmonica-enhanced \"Innocent,\" and the all-around very solid \"Mower,\" these tracks ultimately offer nothing beyond serviceable, formulaic, derivative stoner metal.\n\nOK, fine, I'll add a few points to \"What Love Remains\" because Anderson's sluggish, leviathan riffs point to his way forward with Sunn O))), but I simply don't rate Stahl's brassy, inexpressive vocals very highly -- sorry!\n\nSo I better shut the hell up before I piss off some of my stoner rock/doom brethren with this most likely unpopular evaluation; but I'll stand by it and will always recommend dozens of other bands and albums over Goatsnake and their largely disappointing discography.\n\nAlice in Chains: Jar of Flies EP (1994)\n\n\"Say goodbye, don't follow ...\"\n\nAlice in Chains just celebrated the 30th anniversary of Jar of Flies with this very necessary vinyl reissue (*) but I think it's just a happy (more like tragic) coincidence that its songs have recently taken over my TikTok feed via organic tribute clips marking Layne Staley's death, on April 5, 2002.\n\nIn any case, both the tributes and reissue are well-deserved for a band that achieved quite a few milestones with this release, some of which I noted in an old piece for Ultimate Classic Rock that I'll revisit today.\n\nBy the time they issued the Jar of Flies EP, in January of 1994, Alice in Chains weren't just grunge royalty, but one of the world's most popular rock bands of any kind; so popular that what started as an informal attempt to blow off creative steam became the first EP in music history to enter the Billboard chart at No. 1.\n\nOf course, A.I.C. had already shown a softer side to their alternative metal with '92's similarly low-key Sap EP, but based on their success with electrified full-lengths, Facelift and Dirt, few expected the band to take another detour into these softer, contemplative, mostly acoustic creations.\n\nNot least the band itself, which, according to Staley, wanted nothing more than to find a quiet place in which to hole up for a while (choosing Seattle’s London Bridge Studio) following the punishing Dirt world tour and the loss of their Seattle rehearsal room.\n\nAll of which makes sense to me, because I'd witnessed A.I.C. live in early '93, and, though they put on a great show, they also looked a little fried -- especially soon-to-be-ousted original bassist Mike Starr.\n\nFast-forward to late '93, it allegedly took just one week for the founding threesome of Staley, guitarist Jerry Cantrell, drummer Sean Kinney, and new bassist Mike Inez, to emerge with all of seven new tracks, written and recorded in a torrent of inspiration.\n\nSome of these, including lead-off single, \"No Excuses,\" its follow-up, \"I Stay Away,\" and the EP-opening \"Rotten Apple,\" showcased hybrid acoustic/electric arrangements where A.I.C.'s customary intensity was reeled back significantly, not unlike Dirt's \"Rooster.\"\n\nEven Kinney and Inez got in on the songwriting action, albeit with modest results, via the freaky boogie-woogie of \"Swing on This.\"\n\nBut my favorite Jar of Flies moments were its most stripped-down, namely absolutely gorgeous, mournful musings like \"Nutshell,\" \"Don't Follow,\" and the instrumental \"Whale & Wasp\" -- all of which laid bare the band's vulnerabilities like never before.\n\nSurely, it was precisely this unexpected invitation to look behind the band’s signature wall of metallic guitars that appealed to both dedicated, long-time A.I.C. supporters, and seduced an entire faction of new fans, along the way.\n\nSure enough, Jar of Flies' commercial appeal was immediately confirmed by its astonishing, chart-topping success -- then perpetuated in the three decades as it retained its high standing in the Alice in Chains catalog.\n\nAnd, as the relatively young format of vertical short-form video suggests, its songs have attained a deeper poignance in the wake of Staley -- and Starr's -- untimely passings; now serving, for better or worse, as true musical requiems.\n\n* Can we finally have a wax reissue of that desperately-needed, eternally-underrated self-titled third album next year, please?\n\nOs Mutantes: Mutantes (1969)\n\nRita Lee, who was known throughout my lifetime as Brazil's 'Queen of Rock 'n' Roll,' passed away in May of 2023 at the age of 75, and while she enjoyed a long a successful solo career in our shared homeland, overseas she will always be best known as the singer of Os Mutantes.\n\nTogether with brothers Arnaldo Baptista (bass, keyboards, vocals) and Sérgio Dias (guitar, vocals), Lee (born Rita Lee Jones, allegedly from a line of American Confederate émigrés) was, by her own admission, swept up by the Tropicália tornado.\n\nOs Mutantes' eponymous debut from 1968 relied heavily on covering the works of leading Tropicalistas like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, and its domestic success owed as much to the precocious trio's alluring naïveté and youthful chutzpah as any real talent.\n\nBut more was expected of their sophomore LP -- the following year's simply named Mutantes -- and while the three principals definitely raised their game as songwriters, one can't overstate the importance of producer Manoel Bareinbein and arranger Rogério Duprat.\n\nLike a Tupiniquim (*) George Martin and Arif Mardin, respectively, both men had overseen the seminal, movement-launching Tropicália ou Panis et Circenses album in '68, and here again, they aspired to mimic psychedelia's ultimate expression, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\n\nThat they came anywhere near to achieving this goal, given the comparatively risible budgets and recording technology available in a Third World country, would have been remarkable in and of itself, but Mutantes actually challenged some of the era's most audacious psych-rock.\n\nListen as Bareinbein and Duprat transformed their three young charges' playful, whimsical, or just plain comical concepts into full-blown cinematic concoctions, rife with classical orchestrations (on the tongue-twisting \"Dom Quixote\"), lysergic phasing effects (\"Não Vá se Perder por Aí\"), and other cut-and-paste studio techniques (the narcoleptic \"Dia 36\").\n\nAnd those are just the first three songs!\n\nTom Zé's \"2001\" mutates from forró into Mothers of Invention freak-out halfway through, the lullaby \"Fuga No. II\" gets high on violins and falsettos, and \"Banho de Lua\" (from the Italian '50s rock standard \"Tintarella di Luna\") is slathered in stinging fuzz guitar.\n\nBaptista takes over lead vocals for \"Ritta Lee\" [SIC], which packs fanciful piano, rococo horns, and chipmunk choirs, and \"Qualquer Bobagem,\" where he stutters just like Roger Daltrey on \"My Generation,\" but still manages to spit out the album's bet chorus.\n\nAnd the closing \"Caminhante Noturno\" simply pulls out all the stops, casting everything AND the kitchen sink (is that a flamenco brass section?) into a mind-bending, ever-shifting sonic collage, behind the tale of a mysterious \"Nighttime Rambler.\"\n\nWhen all was said and done, Mutantes turned out as ambitious as any '60s psych-rock LP you're likely to hear, and I, for one, feel the album easily exceeded its more celebrated predecessor, but it seemingly proved too strange for Brazilian radio.\n\nOs Mutantes carried on with their oft-misunderstood, risk-taking career for another three, increasingly fraught and decreasingly inspired LPs, that would eventually be proven ahead of their time, even as they are undeniably OF their time.\n\nOr something ... as this vintage TV performance footage and this impressive 55-year-old long-player make obvious.\n\n* The term \"Tupiniquim\" has its roots in the indigenous people of the Tupi tribes, but was at some point adopted by modern-day citizens to colloquially mean \"Brazilian\" or \"made in Brazil,\" if you like.\n\nMore Mutantes: Os Mutantes.\n\nTruly: \"Leslie's Coughing Up Blood\" / \"Virtually\" (1993)\n\nI've covered Truly in these blogs before, so some of the below may sound redundant, but this is one of those bands whose modest achievements and growing obscurity pique my interest and turn them into pet projects.\n\nA grunge supergroup, Truly featured bassist Hiro Yamamoto (ex-Soundgarden), drummer Mark Pickerel (ex-Soundgarden and Screaming Trees), vocalist/guitarist Robert Roth (ex-Storybook Krooks), and were a testament to the close-knit nature of the early '90s Seattle music scene.\n\nBut \"close-knit\" and \"expedient\" didn't always go hand-in-hand, because even though all three men were \"free agents\" by '91 (fun fact: Roth had auditioned for Nirvana the previous year), their first full-length, Fast Stories ... From Kid Coma, didn't emerge until '95.\n\nLet's not get ahead of ourselves, though ...\n\nInitially backed by Sub Pop, whose Jonathan Poneman helped choose their name (based on an early song title), Truly recorded their first EP, Heart and Lungs, as a quartet with second guitarist Chris Quinn, but they were reduced to a power trio by the time they played Lollapalooza's side stage the following year.\n\nAnd while that limited but obviously crucial public exposure hardly set the world alight, grunge's major label gold rush was in full swing by then, so Truly were duly snapped up by Capitol Records, which was probably quickly wondering what they got themselves into.\n\nBecause Truly's parting release for Sub Pop was a violent slab of fuzz-laden, neo-psych guitar corrosion, wild drum-bashing, and desperate howls called \"Leslie's Coughing Up Blood,\" and I'll quote some of its lyrics:\n\n\"Leslie's coughing up blood; Leslie's coughing up blood now ... Gonna come alive, post-suicide; Gonna come alive, when the humans die ... When you can't breathe the wind; You can't drink the flood ... Leslie's coughing up blood now! She can't love ... She can't love ... She can't love!\"\n\nAlmost 30 years later, this remains one of my favorite grunge songs of all time.\n\nI can't say the same for its lysergic B-side, \"Virtually,\" which clashed strong riffs and delicate arpeggios against dense synthesizer waves, some of them more shoegaze than grunge, and saw Roth in mumble-mode over the top.\n\nNevertheless, both tracks would later end up among Kid Coma's bloated thirteen songs and 72 minutes -- a prime example of CD-era excess, and maybe a sign that Capitol were already looking to wash their hands of Truly, whom they dropped the following year.\n\nBut not before securing a small but loyal fan base with contrarians like me, who will echo Yamamoto's assertion in a subsequent interview: \"Some of [Truly's] songs and lyrics still put a chill down my spine when I hear them.\"\n\nNo shit!\n\nQuicksand: Slip (1993)\n\nRecent reissues of Quicksand's first LP, Slip, were retailing for outrageous sums earlier this year, so I gritted my teeth and bided my time until the hysteria died down, hoping that the number of copies pressed would exceed popular demand.\n\nThose of you out there who also play the vinyl game know this crapshoot all too well, and my bet paid off on this occasion, when I eventually found this discounted, 30th anniversary green wax version for a fair price -- score!\n\nFor those of you too young to recall, Quicksand emerged out of New York's '80s hardcore scene, when vocalist/guitarist Walter Schreifels (ex-Gorilla Biscuits and Youth of Today) connected with guitarist Tom Capone, bassist Sergio Vega, and drummer Alan Cage.\n\nStarting in 1990, the quartet joined bands like Helmet and Fugazi in fusing those hardcore ingredients with noise rock and accidentally benefited from the rise of grunge, when their self-titled four-track EP on independent Revelation Records sold unexpectedly well.\n\nAs a result, Quicksand became arguably the first band within their peer group to sign to a major label, namely Polydor, which released Slip in February of '93, and selected \"Dine Alone\" as the first single and music video.\n\nBut it was second single, \"Fazer,\" that really connected with listeners through College radio and MTV airplay, especially thanks to the era's influential alt-rock showcase 120 Minutes, and notably several months before Helmet's \"In the Meantime\" broke big.\n\nNot that anyone remembers Slip for its singles; this was an album in the classic definition, where further highlights like \"Freezing Process,\" \"Lie and Wait,\" and \"Too Official\" achieved an optimal balance between melody and dissonance -- like licking honey off barbed wire.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not suggesting you try that; I'm just saying that's what it sounds like, people!\n\nBut, as many post-hardcore groups not named Nirvana would soon learn, there was a big, BIG difference in audience reach between College and Mainstream radio, and for all that major label backing, Slip never even charted in the U.S.\n\nMoreover, though they landed high-profile tours in support of The Offspring, Rage Against the Machine, Anthrax, and White Zombie, Quicksand's album sales still lagged behind other bands' (including Helmet's, for no good reason), so when their sophomore LP, Manic Compression, also underperformed, the group fell apart.\n\nIronically, all of these years later, Slip is widely revered as a post-hardcore classic, as evidenced by Quicksand's successful reunion -- and those hyper-inflated prices modern-day consumers are willing to spend on these vinyl reissues.\n\nBetter late than never, I suppose ...\n\nMore Quicksand: Manic Compression.\n\nSmashing Pumpkins: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995)\n\nLook what I found under the Christmas tree!\n\nNot really, but as with Tool's Fear Inoculum box in '22, this impressive Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness box set (boasting four LPs, 36-page art book, 28-page illustrated lyric book, etc.) was my single biggest vinyl indulgence of 2023.\n\nIt finally replaces the double CD I purchased in 1995 at a massive, long-gone record store in Chicago's South Loop, along with a Cheap Trick album as some kind of tribute to that fair city I called home (barring a one-year hop to Minneapolis) between '94 and '99.\n\nTo say I've listened to it consistently in all the years since would be an overstatement, but I'm still awed by Billy Corgan's achievements, so allow me to recycle and update some earnest praise I wrote for Ultimate Classic Rock almost a decade ago ...\n\nWith Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the Smashing Pumpkins delivered, not just their magnum opus, but arguably the definitive epic of the '90s alt-rock -- such was the cinematic sweep and sheer breath of its twenty-eight songs, two hours-plus, and semi-conceptual flow.\n\nEven more remarkable, all but one-and-quarter songs emerged from the fertile mind of Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan, who reputedly amassed as many as 56 numbers for his band’s third album … and fourth, and fifth, if one wishes to look at it that way.\n\nWhatever, the fact that Mellon Collie debuted at No. 1 and sold over five million copies in the U.S. alone — in spite of its higher price tag — is further testament to both the Smashing Pumpkins' popularity, at the time, and the high-caliber material at hand.\n\nThis ran the gamut of emotions and sonic dynamics, from the dreamy placidity of the title cut, \"Cupid de Locke,\" \"In the Arms of Sleep,\" and \"Stumbleine,\" to irresistible, often whimsical singles like \"Tonight, Tonight\" (what a great video!), \"Thirty-Three,\" and \"1979\" ...\n\n[pause for breath]\n\nFrom the hooky modern rock of \"Here is no Why,\" \"Muzzle,\" and \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" (a serious test to Corgan's infamously limited vocal range), to the epic ambitions of \"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans,\" and \"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\" ...\n\n[and another breath]\n\nTake a wild guess which category was my favorite ... and I don't care what anyone says, the latter (\"Love is suicide ... Love is suicide\") is abso-fucking-lutely about Kurt and Courtney.\n\nSo much sonic variety, needles to say, only finds a receptive mainstream audience if conditions -- time, place, environment -- are absolutely perfect (and if the songs don't suck), and that's precisely what Mellon Collie enjoyed in the alt-rock-crazed mid '90s.\n\nUnfortunately, Corgan seemingly also exhausted all of his ideas and/or interest in the Pumpkins' signature sound, because the group's next full-length, Adore, took a radical and ultimately ill-fated left turn into rather subdued synthetic goth/electro-rock as performed by leather cenobites.\n\nBy the time I next saw the band live, incongruously dressed like leather cenobites for a Kansas City radio show, in late '98, their new direction went down like Spinal Tap performing \"Jazz Odyssey\" to a festival audience.\n\nBut some argue that the failed Adore experiment was also influenced, in part, by the heroin-related death of touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin in '96, and the ensuing ejection of Corgan's closest collaborator and rhythmic engine, drummer Jimmy Chamberlain.\n\nIn any case, the result of all this was that Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness signaled both the peak and the end of an era for the Smashing Pumpkins, and Corgan is bound to spend the rest of his days attempting to either relive or revive these glory days.\n\nCome to think of it, I believe Corgan, Iha, Chamberlin, and bassist Sierra Swan recently made a pre-recorded appearance for Disney's Magical Holiday Celebration, so grit your teeth my fellow Gen X'ers or join me with more Spinal-Tap-plays-amusement-park jokes.\n\nMore Smashing Pumpkins: Gish.\n\nMudhoney: \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" / \"Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More\" (1988)\n\nCall it coincidence or a self-fulfilling curse, but I was forced to purchase a new toilet bowl for my house on the same day I started drafting this blog about Mudhoney's first single, \"Touch Me I'm Sick.\"\n\nIt really doesn't get any more \"punk rock\" than introducing yourself to the world with a photo of a commode, and it also says a lot about why Mudhoney held on to their punk rock ethos, long after most Seattle grunge bands had forgotten them.\n\nMuch more than a tasteless joke, though, this toilet was a statement of intent; taking a stand (or a seat, as it were) against commerce over art; and a comment on the divergent career goals that drove vocalist/guitarist Mark Arm and guitarist Steve Turner to split with former Green River bandmates Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament, later of Mother Love Bone and Pearl Jam.\n\nDon't you love it when things work out for everyone in the end?\n\nNot that anyone was hanging around, reverentially whispering, \"you know you're laying the groundwork for grunge here\" while Mudhoney were capturing these songs with Jack Endino at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording, backed by Sub-Pop Records boss Bruce Pavitt.\n\nReleased August 1st, 1988 (so yes, 35 years ago today), just weeks after Green River's posthumous swan song, Rehab Doll, the 7-inch's first pressing of 800 units was quickly endorsed by college radio DJs nationwide, catching everyone by surprise.\n\nAs a result, \"Touch Me I'm Sick\" effectively introduced America's taste-making music underground to Mudhoney's raw, dirty, Stooges-beholden post-punk sound, with its shockwaves of distortion, purposefully loose rhythm section (comprised of bassist Matt Lukin and drummer Dan Peters), plus Arm's wild-eyed howling and screeching.\n\nAnd then there were the song's lyrics, which, as my All-Music Guide colleague Steve Huey aptly surmised, contradicted both the 1980s \"cool-at-any-cost\" mentality and decades of pop music convention by celebrating \"disease, self-loathing, angst, and dirty sex.\"\n\nEssentially, Mudhoney were all but daring anyone to like them ... and, against all odds, they did!\n\nIndeed, those who flipped the single over faced an even more unnerving challenge in the domestic verbal abuse and slovenly drunk sonics of \"Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More,\" which allegedly almost landed on the A-side before sanity, or at least a different kind of INsanity, prevailed.\n\nSpeaking of insanity, initial pressings of the single arrived in a plain white paper sleeve with the cryptic message, \"What does the word 'crack' mean to you?,\" inscribed on the A-side, and the now-famous toilet bowl picture applied to the B-side as a sticker.\n\nAnd once it became obvious to Sub-Pop that Mudhoney were onto something, they quickly moved to capitalize by releasing the group's first EP, Superfuzz Bigmuff, that October -- and off they went.\n\np.s. -- I didn't know the band took its name from a 1965 Russ Meier film, but that makes all the sense in the world.\n\nPearl Jam: Riot Act (2002)\n\nAlready celebrating its 20th anniversary (I’m so old, anniversaries have anniversaries!), 2002’s Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album to really pique my interest since the gory, glory days of Seattle and grunge, in the early-to-mid ‘90s..\n\nRight or wrong, I’d pretty much lost interest in the group after the inconsistent chaos of ‘96’s No Code (an album I suspect I’ll really enjoy if I ever spin it again), and the comparative mundanity of ‘98’s Yield and ‘00’s Binaural -- I can’t name a single song off either one!\n\nBut Riot Act was another matter, as the band found new inspiration in a much-needed year-long break, the aftershock of 9/11 (and all the political shenanigans that followed), and the fresh input of new producer Adam Kasper during a mutually agreed, anti-Pro Tools, analog recording approach.\n\nAND they had Matt Cameron, the longtime Soundgarden drummer and founder, who dove into the songwriting pool, with the arpeggiated “Cropduster,” the riffy punk rocker “Get Right,” and the artsy, effects-laden mood piece “You Are” -- in my opinion, the best song Pearl Jam has put its name to this century, and it ain’t even close!\n\n(Because it sounds almost as good as a Soundgarden song -- duh!)\n\nTo be fair, Eddie Vedder, too, brought several quality efforts in the amusingly named “Love Boat Captain,” the catchy “I am Mine,” and the understated “Thumbing My Way” -- as did Stone Gossard with the overtly political “Bu$hleaguer” and a majestic closer in “All or None.”\n\nNot to be left out of the fun, Jeff Ament made a late contribution with the vaguely psychedelic “½ Full” (which is an apt title), and Mike McCready (still rebounding from his latest trip to rehab, a few years earlier) joined in a band-credited rock-out called “Save You.\"\n\nSave me? Glad you saved yourselves, guys!\n\nAlthough, of course, Riot Act’s performance in the marketplace contradicted my personal opinion -- at least in America, where it peaked at No. 5 and sold ¾ as many copies as its predecessor, Binaural (which had gone to No. 2) -- even as it topped the charts in Australia and other foreign lands.\n\nAnd when Pearl Jam returned (after another lengthy tour) with their self-titled eighth LP (a.k.a. the avocado album), four years later, its retreat into more familiar, uniform alt-rock resulted in better sales than Riot Act, so I guess that about seals my contrarian credentials.\n\nMore Pearl Jam: Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, Backspacer; plus Temple of the Dog’s Temple of the Dog; Mother Love Bone’s Apple; Green River’s Come On DownEP.\n\nStone Temple Pilots: Core (1992)\n\nIf there were any remaining delusions that grunge had transcended its anti-establishment, “Smells Like Teen Spirit”-ignited revolution (if it ever deserved such billing -- not really) to become the de facto new mainstream, Stone Temple Pilots’ 1992 debut album, Core, laid them to rest.\n\nReleased 30 years ago this month, Core was one of the first and most obvious examples of custom-made grunge, scientifically developed in a lab (well, studio) to help this quartet from San Diego replicate all of the ‘chemical properties’ of Seattle ... hey, Eddie Vedder made the same northward trek.\n\nFormed in 1989 as Swing by singer Scott Weiland and bassist Robert DeLeo, then renamed Mighty Joe Young following the arrival of brother Dean DeLeo on guitar and drummer Eric Kretz, the future S.T.P. could well have sounded like Jane’s Addiction, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or Guns n’ Roses, had musical trends stayed the same ... but then, so might have Alice n’ Chains.\n\nMy point being: nothing is sacred, no one is fully innocent or guilty, and little is ever as it seems in art and commerce (emphasis on ‘commerce’), but none of these maxims should dissuade us from listening with our ears ... did I mention that I love this record?\n\nBecause it sure sounded genuinely ‘alternative’ at the time: from the Soundgardian alt-doom morbidity of “Dead & Bloated” (“I am smellin’ like the rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed”), to the A.I.C.-riffed alt-metal of “Wicked Garden” (“Burn, burn, burn ... Burn your wicked garden to the ground”), to the Pearl Jammed alt-poetry of “Plush” (“Got time, time to wait for tomorrow”).\n\nFurther highlights like the sinister “Sin” (more A.I.C. and Soundgarden), the despairing, acoustic “Creep,” and the full metal assault of “Crackerman” likewise overcome their varied but usually obvious root influences with sheer chutzpah, and then there’s that other song ...\n\nYes, breakthrough single (and ever-guiltier pleasure) “Sex Type Thing,” whose done-to-death descending metal riff and neanderthal misogyny (“I said I’m gonna get close to you; You wouldn’t want me have to hurt you too”) had a lot more in common with the prior generation of hair metal bands than its supposedly gender-sensitive grunge replacement.\n\nIn any event, S.T.P.’s ‘fake it ‘til you make it’ ethos led to eclectic asides like the beguiling instrumental “No Memory,” the twisted vignette “Wet My Bed,” a funk metal exercise (because why not?) in “Naked Sunday,” and a couple more alt-rockers in “Piece of Pie” and the overlong “Where the River Goes.”\n\nTen million copies sold globally later (eight million in America alone!), it was obvious that S.T.P.’s (and Atlantic Records’) gamble had paid off, but the whole thing would have never ‘stuck’ if the group hadn’t been capable of backing it up.\n\nSure, the very competent Kretz was a little invisible and Robert was basically a fashion plate with a bass strapped on, but Dean’s cavernous guitar tone gave Core an undeniable life-force, and Weiland quickly proved to have both talent and star-quality in abundance -- alas, unto his own self-destruction.\n\nThe fact that Stone Temple Pilots remained such a massive brand for the rest of the 1990s, in spite of Scott’s countless personal demons, and that they used the same sonic versatility and survival instincts to prosper well beyond grunge’s sell-by-date is a testament to all that.\n\nMore Stone Temple Pilots: Purple, No. 4.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age: Songs for the Deaf (2002)\n\nWhen Dave Grohl asks if he can join your band, “pretty please,” you know that band must rank among the coolest, most exciting on the planet, and that’s precisely the cache Queens of the Stone Age were enjoying around the time of their third studio album, Songs for the Deaf.\n\nReleased 20 years ago this month, this was a worthy successor to the group’s year 2000 sophomore breakthrough, Rated R, mirroring its eclectic, idiosyncratic creativity, while mimicking a radio-soundtracked nighttime drive across the California desert, complete with numerous fictional DJs.\n\nOf course, terrestrial radio rarely, if ever, sounded this good, this twisted, this unpredictable, so all you kids under 25 out there, don’t be fooled into false airwave nostalgia, and all of you under 15s living in all-you-can-eat streaming utopia, don’t waste time trying to comprehend this archaic technology.\n\nBut I digress ...\n\nThough I still can’t pick my favorite amongst Rated R, Songs for the Deaf, or the band’s underrated self-titled debut, I think we can all agree this was the ultimate Q.O.T.S.A. line-up, pairing Grohl with vocalist/guitarist Josh Homme, bassist/vocalist Nick Oliveri, and occasional frontman Mark Lanegan. (*)\n\nCertainly, it took a lot of musical chemistry to weld together so many strange sounds with such seamless efficiency and power.\n\nMind you, some of these songs (“You Think I Ain’t Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire,” “Hangin’ Tree”) had already been recorded for the Homme-led Desert Sessions, but they fit right in with the bold new works composed especially for this not-quite-magnum opus.\n\nHighlights ranged from swinging single “No One Knows,” to the piano-tinkled “Go with the Flow,” and the relentless “First It Giveth,” to the post-stoner rocker “Do it Again ” and lysergic grooves of “God is in the Radio,” to the ominous, absolutely terrifying title track. (**)\n\nToss in outliers like the Oliveri-penned surf rocker “Another Love Song,” the grunge raga “The Sky is Fallin’,” and the subdued, almost classical “Mosquito Song” (whose lyrics preemptively name the Queens’ next album, Lullabies to Paralyze), and Songs for the Deaf is indeed a ”trip into the heart of darkness.”\n\nBut I felt nothing but euphoria when I caught this short-lived supergroup formation of Q.O.T.S.A. at New York City’s Bowery Ballroom, back in 2002, and here’s the best part: the show is now available on YouTube, so get ready to miss this incredible group (plus the recently deceased Lanegan) all over again.\n\n* Backed by several crucial session players, including the multi-talented couple of Alain Johannes (lap steel, e-bow, organ, piano, flamenco guitar, theremin) and Natasha Shneider (e-bow, organ, piano, theremin), formerly of alt-rockers Eleven.\n\n** As I wrote in a Loudwire article entitled -- get this! -- ‘50 Disturbing Songs that People Love,’ its “sinister melodies, Homme’s ghostly falsetto and vague rhymes skirted the obvious and suggested, there’s a big difference between not being able to hear and simply not listening.”\n\nSpiritu: Spiritu (2002)\n\nLong before Albuquerque, New Mexico, became synonymous with illicit drugs via the award-wining series, Breaking Bad, it was coincidentally (?) home to one of the preeminent stoner rock labels, MeteorCity, whose artists included Nebula, Unida, Spirit Caravan, and the lesser-known Spiritu.\n\n(Breaking Bad and ‘90s stoner rock also had the desert in common, so the coincidences keep piling up!)\n\nFormed by MeteorCity founder and, on this occasion, vocalist Jadd Schickler, guitarist Mike ‘Chav’ Chavez, bassist John Bess, and drummer James (yes, ... just James), Spiritu headed to Seattle in late 2001 to work with renowned indie rock producer Jack Endino (Nirvana, Mudhoney, etc.).\n\nAs the story goes, it took only three days to record this self-titled first (and last) album, which I was only too happy to review for the All-Music Guide when Jadd shipped me a promo copy, before Spiritu headed out for a European tour in support of Clutch and Spiritual Beggars.\n\nAnd while I’ll admit that I indulged in the odd spot of hyperbole on behalf of my friend, I can honestly say, listening back 20 years later, that Spiritu had a lot going for them -- both in terms of covering the stoner rock ground rules and exploring some neighboring music genres.\n\nTo wit: nine-minute opener “Z (Noonday Demon)” harbored alien textures reminiscent of Australian space/prog weirdos Alchemist, the similarly epic “Glorywhore” dangled its long alt/psych tendrils into Alice in Chains’ pool, and the percussively slammed “Slump” was the album’s third and final nine-minute offering.\n\nPerhaps there was some numerology at play here?\n\nThere was certainly something bizarre, exotic, or at the very least tongue-in-cheek afoot, because after showcasing Bees’ expert bass playing on the unusually concise “Clean Livin’” (which could have slotted comfortably into a Slo Burn or Lowrider LP), the otherwise textbook stoned rocker “Fat Man in Thailand” amusingly quoted lyrics from Murray Head’s 1980s curiosity, “One Night in Bangkok.”\n\nNo, seriously!\n\nFinally, I’m relatively sure Spiritu’s cover of the old Sir Lord Baltimore nugget “Woman Tamer” was my very first exposure to this underground proto-metal classic, at a time when S.L.B.’s cult discography was still quite elusive, pre-Internet-facilitated rediscovery.\n\nIn sum: while they obviously didn’t enjoy the same popularity as Breaking Bad -- either in their day or in re-runs -- Spiritu left a pretty good-looking corpse in this LP.\n\nExcept for an additional four tracks issued in ‘06 as the Human Failures split release with fellow MeteorCity signings Village of Dead Roads, Spiritu were heard from no more, and the label, too, bid a three-CD farewell via ‘07’s ... And Back to Earth Again box set.\n\nDead Moon: Unknown Passage (1989)\n\nThis one’s for Generation X ... AND Baby Boomers who don’t suck.\n\nIf you, like me, count Doug Pray’s 1997 grunge expose Hype! among your favorite rockumentaries, then you may recall a brief mention and some exciting footage of the little known Dead Moon performing their raging, sweaty non-hit “54/40 or Fight.”\n\nThe song became a personal favorite from the accompanying soundtrack, but it wasn’t until recently that I thought to investigate further into the band’s history, and what I found out made this reissue of the group’s sophomore LP, Unknown Passage, irresistible, and here’s why ...\n\nRemarkably, vocalist/guitarist Fred Cole launched his musical career in 1964 with Las Vegas’ The Lords, but he’d find garage rock cult notoriety via The Weeds’ ’66 single “It’s Your Time” and, after a name change, The Lollipop Shoppe’s psych-tinted ’68 7-inch “You Must Be a Witch,” also found on the same year’s anglicized Just Colour LP and, later, the Nuggets box set.\n\nThe Lollipop Shoppe was no more by the time 1970 rolled around, but Cole had met his wife and future Dead Moon bassist Kathleen ‘Toody’ Conner, settled down in Portland, OR, and proceeded to form a succession of oft-forgotten bands (Whizeagle and Zipper, King Bee, The Rats, Western Front, The Range Rats) until Dead Moon’s formation in 1987 with drummer Andrew Loomis.\n\nCommitted to a lo-fi philosophy about all things, Dead Moon’s ensuing albums were released on the couple’s own Tombstone label and engineered by Cole himself on the same mono recording lathe used for The Kingsmen’s iconic recording of “Louie Louie”!\n\nAnd I see no reason to dispute this based on the ragged performances and anti-production of 1989’s Unknown Passage, which included a rusty studio version of the aforementioned “54/40 or Fight” (*) alongside similarly uncompromising mutations from a twilight zone between garage rock and grunge such as “Dead Moon Night,” “My Escape,” and “I Tried.”\n\nThere’s also a cover of The Chambers Brothers’ 1967 hit “Time Has Come Today” for good measure, and there are times when Cole’s strangled screech makes these tracks sound like The Cramps jamming with Bon Scott (see “I’m Wise”), but in a good way!\n\nAnd, at their best, standouts like “Evil Eye,” “Demona,” and “On My Own” uphold the rebellious tradition of The Sonics, The Kingsmen, and other rocking godfathers of the Pacific Northwest, building that long, if tenuous bridge that connected them to Seattle’s alt-rock explosion of the 1990s, even if Dead Moon never did profit from all that Hype!\n\nNor would they have wanted to, and, after self-releasing a documentary and wrapping up a final tour of their European strongholds, Dead Moon was finally laid to rest in 2006, while Cole and Toody set their sights on a new band called Pierced Arrows with drummer Kelly Halliburton.\n\nThen, in 2016, it was reported that Dead Moon drummer Loomis had passed away at the age of 54, and in ‘17 Toody announced that the 69-year-old Cole had lost a long battle with cancer, ending one of the longest, strangest, and most intriguing careers in rock.\n\n* Incidentally, the title refers to the Oregon border dispute of 1844, during which several nations with territorial and commercial ambitions in what we now call the Pacific Northwest -- and parallel 54”40’ north, to be precise -- gave rise to political tensions and the bellicose slogan “Fifty-four Forty or Fight!”\n\nMore Pre-Grunge LPs: Alice in Chains’ Facelift, Green River’s Come On Down, EP, Mother Love Bone’s Apple, Mudhoney’sSuperfuzz Migmuff, Nirvana’s Bleach, Screaming Trees’ Buzz Factory, Soundgarden’sScreaming LifeEP, Tad’s God’s Balls, Temple of the Dog’s Temple of the Dog.\n\nAlice in Chains: Sap EP (1992)\n\nI boarded the Alice in Chains train on the first or second stop: way before grunge was even a “thing,” when Facelift introduced me to what was then seen as a promising young METAL band, ready to spar with Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax on the Clash of the Titans tour.\n\nMind you, I missed that tour because I was still living in Brazilian “exile,” and I didn’t even look for an import copy of the all-acoustic Sap EP when it arrived, 30 years ago today; just waited patiently for Dirt, later on in ‘92, then rolled into ‘93’s more robust acoustic/electric outing, Jar of Flies.\n\nAs well as revealing an entirely different, surprisingly compelling side of AiC, the latter seven-tracker proved that Sap wasn’t some random curiosity, but a crucial facet of the band’s personality and something I should consider adding to my collection ... so I did.\n\nBut I’ll admit that I’d rarely revisited it over the decades that preceded last year’s long-overdue vinyl reissue, which came complete with the nifty band logo etched into side two as you can see in the image above.\n\nObviously, Sap tapped (sapped?) into the “unplugged” craze of the early ‘90s, but emotionally vulnerable standouts like “Brother,” the spine-chilling “Am I Inside,” and the plugged-in “Got Me Wrong” really spotlighted Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell’s glorious vocal harmonies.\n\nBoth Chris Cornell and Mark Arm lend their wildly different voices to “Right Turn” (*) and though I love Ann Wilson’s stunning contributions to “Brother” and “Am I Inside” -- how could one not? -- the Heart camp’s rush to latch onto Seattle’s next and biggest-ever musical movement (also see the Singles soundtrack) always rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nOh, and the alternately unlisted, untitled, or comically named “Love Song” made sure fans wouldn’t take Sap too seriously, with its goofy falsettos, Tom Waits piano parody, speed metal drumming, and overall Dadaist lyrical absurdity, culminating in repeated exhortations to “Kiss the midget!”\n\nThree decades later, it still helps keep Sap’s modest origins and ambitions in perspective, and then one can enjoy this cool little EP for what it is: nothing more, nothing less.\n\nManic Street Preachers: Gold Against the Soul (1993)\n\nFor it was they who boldly proclaimed that their ‘92 debut Generation Terrorists -- a truly jaw-dropping outpouring of creativity, 18-songs deep -- would go down as the “greatest rock album ever,” even promising they’d break up once it had sold “16 million copies around the world.”\n\nAlas, when critical acclaim fell somewhat short of prediction one and consumer demand fell WAY short of prediction two, band members James Dean Bradfield (vocals/lead guitar), Richey Edwards (rhythm guitar), Nicky Wire (bass) and Sean Moore (drums) had no choice but to carry on.\n\nEven if that meant enduring the disappointing, self-fulfilling prophecy of Gold Against the Soul, which not only boasted half as many songs as Generation Terrorists, but only half, again, that were all that good!\n\nNever mind their titles, which resemble Nirvana rejects, because tracks like “Drug Drug Druggy,” “Nostalgic Pushead” and “Symphony of Tourette” also lacked dimension and distinction, serving only to remind us how the still young Manics were basically one big sponge for outside influences.\n\nOther cuts, such as the more promising “Yourself” and “Roses in the Hospital” inhabited an alt-rock nowhere-land, halfway between Grunge and Brit-Pop, and -- good Lord! -- is that a funk metal riff anchoring the title track?\n\nSay it ain’t so!\n\nBetter to turn our eyes to the good half of Gold Against the Soul, then, where we’ll find the hard-driving “Sleepflower” and the ambitious, infectious “La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh),” which probably doesn’t sound the least bit awkward to those of you who don’t speak Italian.\n\nAnd, when the Manics finally do hit the mark they absolutely crush it, as evidenced by the emotional, haunting, semi-acoustic “Life Becoming a Landslide” and the near-perfect first single “From Despair to Where,” which ascends heavenward on Bradfield’s immaculate guitar licks.\n\nTo be entirely honest, it was pretty much that song right there that guaranteed Gold Against the Soul a permanent slot in my record collection, no matter how underwhelming its surroundings.\n\nAnd, to the Manic Street Preachers’ immense credit, they would improbably rebound (especially in light of Richey Edwards’ imminent disappearance off the face of the Earth) the very next year with an arguable career magnum opus in the magnificent The Holy Bible.\n\nMore Manic Street Preachers: Generation Terrorists, The Holy Bible.\n\nNirvana: “Sliver” / “Dive” (1990)\n\nNirvana were still virtual nobodies when they issued this 7-inch single in September of 1990 (January of ‘91 in the U.K.): Nevermind was still one year away, the band was still signed to Sub Pop, and Kurt Cobain was still eager to escape anonymity, instead of asking himself:\n\n“Dear lord, what have I done?”\n\nLike most people, I only heard “Sliver” and its B-side “Dive” “after the storm,” on the 1992 collection Incesticide, which was hastily assembled by DGC to capitalize on rock music’s biggest global phenomenon since Guns n’ Roses’ Appetite for Destruction, back in ‘87.\n\nOf course, the fallout of Nirvana’s incredible and unexpected rise, tragically culminating in Cobain’s tragic 1994 suicide, would make the petty dramas that tore up Gn’R look like a pathetic soap opera, but let’s not get into that ...\n\nBack in the summer of 1990, Nirvana were just another indie band from Seattle, wrapping up the modest promotional push behind their ‘89 debut album, Bleach, when they decided to sneak into Reciprocal Recording with producer Jack Endino -- allegedly while the members of Tad were taking their lunch break.\n\nNotably, it was Mudhoney drummer Dan Peters who accompanied Kurt and bassist Krist Novoselic that day, briefly supplanting Nirvana’s already departed original drummer Chad Channing, before Dave Grohl entered the picture (Grohl would later appear in the “Sliver” music video).\n\nAs for the song’s relentless melodicism (and excessive repetition), it was a clear sign-post pointing to Nevermind’s amped-up accessibility, and there was also a refreshingly directness to its, dare-I-say, “cute” lyrics about a boy left with his grandparents who throws a tantrum and begs: “Grandma take me home!”\n\nBut Cobain intentionally chose a random, confusing title for the song because, as quoted by biographer Michael Azerrad, “I had a feeling if I called it ‘Sliver,’ most people would call it ‘Silver’” -- further evidence that Kurt was, not only a musical genius, but an insufferable little shit.\n\n“Dive,” meanwhile, was a grinding sludge-fest reminiscent of the already fading Bleach period, so this 7-inch, in retrospect, was an evident stepping stone towards Nirvana’s unlikely jump, from underground hopefuls to grunge superstars.\n\nWhat’s that old saying about big things sometimes arriving in small packages?\n\nScreaming Trees: Buzz Factory (1989)\n\nThe Screaming Trees’ career is all-too-often simplified and compartmentalized into two, distinct phases: the first as an indie rock band signed to hardcore haven SST and the second as junior grunge messiahs signed to major label Epic.\n\nBut the fact is they were always a neo-psychedelic proposition -- one that evolved over time, to be sure, but whose fourth and final SST LP, 1989’s Buzz Factory, still sounds pretty consistent with their seventh and last official album, Dust, from 1996.\n\nI mean that as a compliment ... highest praise, actually.\n\nAnd in spite of its title and production courtesy of Seattle scene lynchpin Jack Endino, one simply cannot call Buzz Factory a direct precursor to the ‘90s grunge phenomenon in the same way as one can the late ‘80s works of Mudhoney or Soundgarden.\n\nIf anything, and ironically, Endino actually dialed back some of the buzz, fuzz and, yes, grunginess found on the Trees’ prior SST LPs while contributing to perfecting the magical dynamic between Gary Lee Conner’s ringing, wah wah-streaked power chords and Mark Lanegan’s wounded, weary moans.\n\nThis is evident on album standouts like “Too Far Away,” “Subtle Poison” and “Flower Web,” and both the opening “Where the Twain Shall Meet\" (a classic Screaming Trees song by any definition) and the acoustic minor keys of “Yard Trip #7” saw Lanegan coming into his own as a lyricist -- here’s a taste of the former:\n\n“Statue people move like dripping water; It's a nail into the cracking ice; You sleep with thoughts of a coming day; I drag behind on a frozen chain.”\n\nAnd here’s a sample of the latter:\n\n“Quarter to eleven; On the day of my birth In the desert wind I would have a grin; That might shatter the Earth.”\n\nNow, I’m not particularly enamored with “Black Sun Morning” (but like everyone else I wonder if its title inspired “Black Hole Sun”), nor urgent punk rockers like “Windows” and “Revelation Revolution,” but I dig the disjointed “End of the Universe” because it makes no apologies for being a dumping ground for remnant and disparate song ideas, stitched together.\n\nThat’s why hindsight shows that Buzz Factory wasn’t the final chapter in the Screaming Trees’ formative, accidental stumble towards a signature sound and mature, top-tier songwriting, but the first realization of Mark, Gary, bassist Van Conner, and drummer Mark Pickerel’s talents and vision.\n\nThe album may not have won as many critical plaudits, nor scored anything resembling a hit, seeing as both it and the band were still flying well under the mainstream radar, but, to me this long-player has the goods to compete in the same league as Uncle Anesthesia, Sweet Oblivion and Dust.\n\np.s. -- There’s a random interview snippet in between “Yard Trip #7″ and “Flower Web,” where the band is asked that eternal question, “If you were trees, what kind of trees would you be,” to which they are prompted to respond, “Screaming Trees!”"
