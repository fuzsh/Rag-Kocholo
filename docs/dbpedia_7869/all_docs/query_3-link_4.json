        "text": "aaamusic | On 14, Mar 2022\n\nQueens of the Stone Age (QOTSA) is a Californian alternative rock band that formed in 1996. The creative force behind much of the band’s music is the founding member, vocalist, and guitarist, Josh Homme.\n\nOver the years, the band has sold over 3.2 million records worldwide and achieved notable commercial success following the release of their best-selling 2002 album, Songs for the Deaf.\n\nSo, what do you need to know about their melodic and often psychedelic alternative rock sound?\n\nLet’s take a look at the most significant QOTSA albums, members, and their association with the late-great grunge pioneer, Mark Lanegan.\n\nHow Did QOTSA Form?\n\nDuring the early part of the 1990s, Josh Homme had notable success as the guitarist for the band Kyuss. When Kyuss broke up, he briefly joined Screaming Trees as a touring member before forming Gamma Ray with Matt Cameron from Soundgarden and Pearl Jam and Val Conner from Screaming Trees.\n\nIn 1996, Gamma Ray released a self-titled EP. Soon after this, the band was forced to change its name to Queens of the Stone Age following a threat of legal action from a German metal band also called Gamma Ray.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age Members\n\nQueens of the Stone Age has had a revolving lineup since its formation. The only member that’s been with the band throughout has been Homme, however, other notable members have included Mark Lanegan, the lead singer of grunge band, Screaming Trees, and Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and Nirvana fame.\n\nToday, the lineup includes:\n\nJosh Homme – Vocals and guitar\n\nTroy Van Leeuwen – Guitar and keyboard\n\nDean Fertita – Keyboards and guitar\n\nMichael Shuman – Bass\n\nJon Theodore – Drums\n\nOther past members have included Homme’s ex-Kyuss bandmates; Nick Oliveri and Alfredo Hernández, along with Alain Johannes, Joey Castillo, and Natasha Shneider.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age Albums\n\nSince forming, there have been seven QOTSA albums. These are:\n\nQueens of the Stone Age (1998)\n\nRated R (2000)\n\nSongs for the Deaf (2002)\n\nLullabies to Paralyze (2005)\n\nEra Vulgaris (2007)\n\n…Like Clockwork (2013)\n\nVillains (2017)\n\nThis fansite for Queens of the Stone Ageis packed with band trivia and information about QOTSA tours.\n\nMark Lanegan’s Involvement With QOTSA\n\nFrom 1984 to 2000, Lanegan was the lead singer for the pioneering grunge band Screaming Trees. While they helped pioneer the Seatle sound, their biggest success came in the early 90s following the explosion of the grunge scene in the wake of Nirvana’s meteoric rise to fame.\n\nLanegan first appeared on QOTSA’s second album, Rated R, contributing vocals to several tracks. He would go on to become a permanent bandmember for the third and fourth albums, Songs for the Deaf and Lullabies to Paralyze.\n\nAlthough Lanegan left the band soon after, he would feature on their subsequent two albums and frequently perform live with them.\n\nLanegan recently passed away at his home in Ireland. The cause of death has not been reported.\n\nThe Future of QOTSA\n\nQOTSA show no sign of slowing down. Although it’s been a few years since their last album, the band is said to be working on new material.\n\nCheck out the rest of the site for a wide range of music-related articles."
