Josh Homme brought together Dave Grohl, Nick Oliveri, and Mark Lanegan (whose brutally honest autobiography, Sing Backwards and Weep, was recently published and is highly recommended) as well as a host of other talented musicians to guest, and produced a granite slab of hard riffs and killer lyrics.\n\nIt’s one of my favourite albums and holds tremendous sentimental value for me. What’s your favourite track and why is it “A Song for the Dead”?\n\nHave a wonderful day and take care of yourselves, everyone!"
