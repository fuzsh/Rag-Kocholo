        "text": "So I made an conscious effort to get back to running in 2021 following a few years out. Injuries kept me away from proper exercise for a while, though I knew I needed to get healthier, lose weight and I really wanted to get back to sport. Whilst music is incredibly important to me generally, I had already sort of realised how important music was to exercise as well, however I learnt more about this during my time at university. It turns out there’s quite a bit of science behind the psychological effects of music on exercise, including the nature of the lyrical content as well as tempo and rhythm. Without going into it in too much detail, music helps to improve your mood whilst exercising, helps with arousal control and reduces your rate of perceived exertion; which allows individuals enjoy exercise more and thus to perform better for longer. So in short form, music helps me to run further and faster.\n\nThe ten songs listed below are tracks that I’ve found really good to run too. There’s quite a wide variety in here but they all have their reasons for being here, which I’ll try and do my best to explain. I’ve been trying out hundreds of tracks, with many more still to go, to try and find the stuff that really helps me improve. So there’s a high chance of me doing another one of these if I find myself with nothing to write about again one week. Hopefully you can use these suggestions in your own exercise, and I hope they help you as much as they’ve helped me. I’ve found that everyone has their own selections which help them exercise better, and I’d be keen to know what gets you going so please let me know so I can try them out myself. Regardless, here are ten songs that I find great to run to.\n\nPendulum – Showdown\n\nPendulum have always been my go to for running, and exercise in general for as long as I can remember. There’s something about the pace of drum and bass, which really tailors it to running. Tempo is really important to me with running music, as I try to match my stride frequency to the BPM of the music. It’s much easier to keep up a good running pace when you’re running to a steady beat, and I’ve always found that drum and bass is really good for regulating my pace. I could run to purely Pendulum, and there’s a lot of their stuff on my running playlists but ‘Showdown’ is usually a good place to start. It doesn’t take to long to get into it, and that ascending introduction into the main melody is phenomenal and a great way to launch yourself off at the start of a run. The song has a great force and power behind it which makes it so tailored to running, and the steadily growing, emphatic conclusion caps off the five and half minute track wonderfully.\n\nBasement Jaxx – Do Your Thing\n\nI think I’m on record as saying that this is one of my favourite songs ever written, and sometimes you just need a good song to get you going. There aren’t too many songs that sound as upbeat and positive as ‘Do Your Thing’, with its playful piano melody, brass interjections and reassuring lyrics. The bounce the percussion creates really helps with finding that extra energy to keep you going deep into a run and I always perk up when this song comes around on my playlist. Dance music seems to be pretty good for running, with the rhythms working both for dance and exercise, though realistically it’s all about the energy and this song has that in abundance. Sometimes you just need a feel-good classic to keep you going, and I will likely always head to this one.\n\nWoodkit – Run Boy Run\n\nChoosing tracks that constantly tell you to “run” usually helps me weirdly enough; though this song has so much more to it then that. I find that just the unique feel of a song can really help to improve your performance and this is one those. This song has been used across multiple media platforms ever since its release eight years ago and I can’t help but think how badass this song would sound behind someone running in a film. Not only does the title get repeated over and over, pushing you to “Run Boy Run”, but the euphoric blend of violins, brass and such impressive percussion that creates such a phenomenal rhythm and pace, just makes the song sound so epic. Whilst the music is so helpful to run to on a technical level, it creates such an atmosphere that engineers an almost make-believe feeling; almost as if you’re in a story or a made-up world and this is your soundtrack. And I find that it can really help you run better. You can really picture yourself speeding away from oncoming danger or more aptly, running triumphantly into glory. Some songs just have that distinct feel, where it makes you feel like you could do anything; this is one of those.\n\nEagles Of Death Metal – Miss Alissa\n\nThis is another track which I found through its use in other media, way before I became a fan of Josh Homme’s work. Having now become a huge fan of Queens of the Stone Age, as well as many of Homme’s other projects, including Eagles of Death Metal, his work is so transcendent to running, with its high tempos and driving rhythms. This track however was brought to my attention by a Nike advert called “Winner Stays On”, which was really damn cool, involving the gradual transformation of a football match in the park between normal blokes to a packed stadium with the worlds best players. Again, it just feels like a cool song to run to, whether that’s because of the technical aspects, where I know it from (which certainly helps) or also the feel it creates. It’s a fun song with a fast pace, full of sweet guitar licks with a lot of flamboyancy in places. This also has an accelerating start so is another great place to start a run with, as the song gently but swiftly goes from 0-100 in the blink of an eye. Hard to explain, but with its technical aspects, and the feel I get based on that and where I know it from, this track just works for me.\n\nIron Maiden – Run to the Hills\n\nHere’s another track which actually keeps shouting the word ‘run’ at you, and weirdly enough I’ve found that running to metal music actually really works. I enjoy some metal music, but I wouldn’t say its on my usual rotation, however there’s something quite empowering about running to it. Whilst the song discusses colonialism, and the “run to the hills” line in the song actually referring to escaping invaders; the constant harmonic reiteration of “run to the hills” is really quite motivating. The track keeps up a great pace following the opening the verse, and again the tempo really helps to regulate stride frequency. It’s these ‘hold nothing back’ type tracks that really work for me, with the pace and power really helping to drive me forward. The regimented musical assault is really good for constant and continued motion and I’m gradually finding a lot more metal tracks popping up on my running playlists.\n\nIDLES – Mr. Motivator\n\nThis track is called ‘Mr. Motivator’ so that should tell you all you need to know. Hell the music video, released near the start of the lockdown last year, featured the band and their fans performing home workouts. The song is a great effort to run to with positive lyrics and an incredible beat set-up by the rhythm section (just check that opening with the ascending guitar, but wait for the drums and bass guitar to really crank it up). The drums are really special, and Jon Beavis has always been at generating pace, but really cranks it up to eleven on this one, just check that acceleration into the bridge and final chorus. This is a really good song to help with pace, and I find that I can’t help myself speeding up to match my strides with the beat. The lyrics are really great for it too, with the rallying cries of seizing the day and reiterating that you can do it. Plus, I also find that some guy screaming at me is usually good to keep me going. Simply put, ‘Mr. Motivator’ is great for motivation.\n\nFleetwood Mac – The Chain\n\nI never really got properly into Fleetwood Mac, and even only liked just a few songs as I heard them for the first time over the past few years. I just don’t think I ever realised I was listening to them when they came on the radio, or just was unfortunate enough to scarcely come across them. However, I’m finding myself appreciating them more and more as time passes and this song has been the one I’m obsessed with right now. The change in pace from the first half of the song to the second half is so great, and really makes it for me. The first half is slower and allows for a nice regulated pace, and it flows into the second half so wonderfully, where it speeds up and you can really go flat out until its conclusion. Alongside the excellent tempo changes, the track also sounds damn cool, and has again been used elsewhere. The tension and climactic atmosphere enables this track to be like many others on this list, and you can imagine you’re running in a completely different world; which really truly helps across me exercise the board.\n\nNirvana – Territorial Pissings\n\nSo you know when I said earlier I seem to run better with someone shouting at me; well this probably the pinnacle of that. This is the shortest song on the list and could probably be the shortest paragraph because it’s quite a simple explanation. This song is just so fast and frantic, with Cobain’s screamed chorus practically descending into nonsense towards the songs conclusion. The songs BPM is faster than most drum and bass tracks, which I’ve already praised for their high BPM and help getting my feet moving quicker to match their beat. It’s all about the pace and power again, starting with those relentless guitar chords that open the track, and it doesn’t let up with Krist and Dave smashing the living hell out of their instruments. It’s quite natural to think that faster songs would make you run faster, and this high tempo assault definitely proves that for me. Whilst the lyrics refer to other subjects, the repeated line “gotta find a way” is quite motivating mid-exercise. I don’t really know why but loud, angry music seems to help me a lot when I’m running.\n\nIggy Pop – Lust For Life (The Prodigy Remix)\n\nThis is another song which I probably decided to use based on where I know it from, but ended up running with it for so much more. The original version of this song was used during the opening of Trainspotting, in which Renton and Spud are running away from their pursuers. So whilst I already associate the original with running based on that, The Prodigy remixed it for the Trainspotting sequel and added so much energy to it, that it is now even more perfect for exercise. Whilst the original wasn’t exactly dull, The Prodigy produce so much power and raw electricity that really elevates this track above and beyond. I’ve got quite a few of their songs on my running playlists and they really seem to perk me up with an instant burst of energy, they’re just one of those bands. It also helps that as soon as I hear it, I can picture the opening scene of Trainspotting, and see myself sprinting down the streets of Scotland away from a pair of suits. You’ll definitely see what I mean if you give this one a try, and even more so if you’ve seen Trainspotting and like The Prodigy.\n\nThe Lightning Seeds – The Life of Riley\n\nI feel like this a bit of a weird choice for a running song, but whilst experimenting with some different music whilst on a run, I found that this track really helped. I was listening to this song quite a bit when I started running again, though I didn’t expect it to come on while I was running, but I certainly haven’t regretted it. The song is such a pleasant listen and really helps to relax me and refocus myself when running. The opening signals an instant pick me up, and then I can really settle in and almost use this song to recover a little. The song is quite a contrast to most of the others that I’ve selected as its a little more upbeat and softer, and I’ve quite often found myself skipping ahead to get to this one. Whilst the power in the other tracks really helps me to push on, this track is basically my second wind and I don’t really know how else to better explain it. There is just something euphoric about reaching the top of a hill whilst this chorus of this track plays, and that’s what its all about. If you can make exercise enjoyable, then it just becomes all that much easier.\n\nI was a little unsure what to title this post as, so I’ll do my best to explain what I’m going to be talking about. About a month ago I went through ten moments in film that I enjoy where the music really helps to elevate it. In that post I discussed actual already written songs that were selected for use in the film. This post is going to be very similar to that one, although this will be talking about music that was written specifically for the film in question. I have selected these ten moments based on how great the music is, how great the scene is, and how well they work together. So you’ll get some where the music is just an addition to an iconic scene, or a sonic movement that spearheads a scene and makes it memorable to myself and other fans alike. I may talk more about the film with some, and more about the music with others, but I will try and get to how they’re both really strong with each. As always, let me know if I’ve forgotten something, as I think my love for film and music will allow me to find another ten to talk about further down the line.\n\nI’m going to break one of my own rules, and I will potentially be selecting multiple moments from one film. You’ll see as we work our way through them but some films have such stellar music that really heightens the overall experience, I couldn’t limit those films to just one moment. I realise that I say a lot about some of these scores/films, but see this more as a discussion about both the music and the film. I’m never going to be able to get across everything I want to say, and I hope I do these justice, but I’d recommend everything I’m about to talk about and you can see for yourself why I rate them so highly. Unless you want a thirty hour podcast where I breakdown every scene Christopher Nolan has ever directed or every bar Hans Zimmer has ever scored, the best way to understand what I’m saying is to experience it yourself. Maybe I won’t do a thirty hour podcast, but alongside going into depth on some of these movies/scores, I might branch out into film reviews/breakdowns where I can really go through what makes my favourite films my favourite. Also, a slight spoiler warning for any of the films I’m going to talk about, there’s nothing massive but its another reason to tell you to go and watch them.\n\nTenet: Ludwig Göransson – POSTERITY\n\nTenet is the most recent of all the films on this list, and actually the main inspiration for wanting to do this list. I feel that Tenet will be remembered as a cult classic, largely due to its high anticipation, high expectations and worse than expected reception, though I personally see it as so much more. The film does have a challenging narrative, which isn’t uncommon for a Christopher Nolan film, though Tenet really pushes it at times; I had to pause the film at times on first viewing just to wrap my head around things. However, once I’d done that, I was obsessed. I’ve always been huge on interesting and innovative concepts and Nolan’s experimentation of times within this film is mesmerising to me. There is so much I love about it, I may be tempted to venture into film reviews, or maybe even discuss Nolan’s catalogue in a little more detail. No matter how confusing this film can be to the uninitiated, you can’t deny how beautiful it is, with its mind-bending action scenes, gorgeous scenery (check out the wide shots of the Amalfi Coast and Vietnam, especially the one which signals the start of ‘Posterity’) and an exquisite soundtrack, composed by a personal favourite of mine, Ludwig Göransson. Having developed a strong catalogue including but not limited to all his work with my favourite rapper, singer, actor, writer, comedian, director, producer and man Childish Gambino, as well as highly revered soundtracks such as Black Panther and a personal favourite of mine, Creed, it was no surprise to me that Tenet’s soundtrack is as strong as it is. I love it when a soundtrack mirrors the concepts of the film and tries to personify them, so the soundtracks electronic and futuristic notions bounce off the action beautifully. The film also revolves around the idea of palindromes, which is something that is the same backward as it is forwards (the word Tenet itself is a palindrome) and Göransson crafted this into the soundtrack by including backmasking, sampling backwards playing audio into the score which not only satisfies my love for weird conceptual stuff, but also makes for some really eerie breaks from the breakneck pace this film can often seem to set. The track I’ve named is one of multiple excellent moments across the score, but is a twelve minute climax that accompanies the final mind-bending battle; It’s a real journey. I could talk about this film for hours, and maybe I will one day, but I’ll have to try to keep these sections shorter; I don’t want to bore the few people actually reading this. Have I put this in here just to talk about this film – maybe, but I think I’ve got great reason as I don’t have enough superlatives for this film. Go watch Tenet and to quote the film itself, “don’t try to understand it, feel it”.\n\nStar Wars (The Empire Strikes Back): John Williams – Yoda and the Force\n\nThis is the first of a few Star Wars entries within this post, though I hope you can see why they’ve all been included. We’ll start with what’s widely considered the best film in the saga and with one of the sequences that makes it so. The whole time Luke spends on Dagobah, the mystery surrounding who Yoda is and everything that comes out of Yoda’s mouth is pure gold. This scene features numerous lines that have become infamous nowadays, with Yoda’s wisdom shining on through. Frank Oz did a truly wonderful performance as Yoda, bringing true life to timeless lines such as “do or do not, there is no try”, “luminous beings are we, not this crude matter” and possibly one of the most profound explanations of what the force is. There aren’t many more recognisable scenes in all of Star Wars, and certainly not many as poignant. Yoda’s training of Luke and explanation of what the force is, is scored with this delicate and moving instrumental, mixing somber notes of Luke’s theme with the intrigue and mystery of Dagobah and Yoda’s theme. It all culminates in Yoda doing the “impossible” and raising the Luke’s X-wing out of the swamp. Backed by a slowly growing score, Yoda moves the X-wing through the air, much to Luke’s astonishment. As it flies over his head, horns sound triumphantly as Luke staggers to believe what he is seeing. There aren’t many musical cues in film that I find as satisfying, grandiose, magnificent (I run out of superlatives for it) than the fanfare accompanying the climax of this scene. Mixing wise words, teachings and feelings of disbelief and failure with a score simmering just below the surface enshrouded by mystique and intrigued, yearning for a moment of triumph, makes the payoff so much better. It is the build-up and payoff, both narratively and sonically which makes this scene, and score, so incredible.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean (The Curse of the Black Pearl): Klaus Badelt – The Medallion Calls\n\nPirates of the Caribbean started off a franchise in the right way with The Curse of the Black Pearl. Whilst the quality might have dropped in some of the later films, the quality of the soundtrack across every film has always been stellar. I could have picked so many tracks from the soundtrack of the opener, including the infamous ‘He’s a Pirate’ that outros the film, and the swashbuckling ‘The Black Pearl’, but there are too many brilliant tracks to name. I could genuinely have done a top ten tracks from this soundtrack alone based on how iconic they are. The soundtrack seems to encapsulate the feel of pirates, sailing and sea shanties so well, that I think we have been conditioned as society to subconsciously think of this soundtrack whenever we think of pirates. The Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack has a true monopoly on the musical spirit of the 21st century view of pirates. It has a great blend of jolly, upbeat swashbucklers; dark, ominous and foreboding choral led sections and badass crescendos full of pride and swagger. All are on full display in this track, which heralds the arrival of Captain Jack Sparrow, with Johnny Depp putting in one of the greatest character performances put to screen. With the grandiose opening signaling the great Captain Jack arriving on his legendary vessel, before the old bait-and-switch cut to a tiny little boat struggling to stay afloat. The score moves masterfully as Jack tries to bail water out, pays his respect to fallen pirates and then iconically stepping ashore just as his ship falls beneath the surf, before sauntering off go about his business. This track, scene and film in general is a great example of music and film intertwining and creating such synergy that makes it hard to think of one without the other. Again I say that I’m convinced that whenever many people consider pirates, sailing or the sea, this theme plays in their heads. I’ve had the honour of playing a medley of tracks from this soundtrack with the Royal Marines Band Service and I can assure you that it was one of the most enthralling experiences I have ever had the pleasure of taking part in.\n\nThe Dark Knight: Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard – Why so Serious?\n\nThe Dark Knight has arguably one of the greatest opening sequences in all of film, and that’s coming from someone who’s not usually big on superhero films. The scene is a perfect introduction to the Joker, and I’ll say right off the top regardless of how cliched it might be; Heath Ledger’s performance in this film is one of the greatest ever put to screen. The Joker sets up a masked bank heist, retaining his anonymity as the architect whilst still taking part in it, stealing from a mob bank, where each crew member is tasked with taking out another so as to tie up loose ends and enable the Joker to get away with all the money. It’s incredibly clever and sets up the Joker as someone to be feared in a world ripe with bad people, as he completely fobs off the idea of honour among thieves. His mannerisms which you come to associate with him are demonstrated from the off, with his unique intonation, head movements and wordplay. His ability as a master-planner as well as a maverick is also evidenced by how he manages to pull off this heist; giving live grenades to hostages to ensure they don’t do anything and removing crew members in order to walk off with all of the money. It’s just such a clever introduction to a film, and to the character and it is easily one of the best opening sequences in film. The musical really adds to this, and it starts right from the off with that incredibly tense rising single note that opens the film. The film conditions you to associate this sound with the Joker, and you can hear it come back into the score throughout whenever the Joker is around. This incredible drawn-out tension builder as well as the clicking-sort of noise, which sounds like pencils against the side of a drum. The violins that play after this note ends remind me a lot of the start of the games in the first Hunger Games films (the score was also composed by James Newton Howard), which in both situations help to create lots of terror and confusion. ‘Why so Serious?’, named after the Joker’s catchphrase, is full of these tension-building cues and they all help to ratchet up the suspension, terror and intrigue throughout. Whilst the film uses the musical cues well from ‘Why so Serious?’, listening to the track in its entirety is well worth your time, from that simple minute long spine-tingling intro to the tense and dramatic string sections; it’s a true masterclass in suspense from a Nolan film yet again. You’ll see what I mean with that opening, and all the different sections that fill you with dread as Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard take full control of your emotions with this one. I can’t get over how effective the slowly rising sections are, whilst differing in sound and layers, but maintaining their menace, something that truly represents the Joker in this interpretation.\n\nStar Wars (The Phantom Menace): John Williams – Duel of the Fates\n\nWhilst the general consensus is that the Star Wars prequels suck, which is actually in fact wrong (feel free to argue angrily with me at your own discretion), no one can deny how great this track is. This might be the shortest entry on this list, mainly because I don’t have to and will likely struggle to explain why this is so good. It just is so good, with the duel and the music being some of the best Star Wars ever, and I struggle to explain why, it just is. The entrance of Darth Maul to the opening of this track is arguably one of my favourite moments in all of Star Wars, with the doors opening to the fanfare opening of ‘Duel of the Fates’, revealing the cloaked figure. Darth Maul is the epitome of cool, lets be honest; he’s got these horns and crazy facial tattoos, an acrobatic fighting style, a menacing personality (it’s criminal we never got to see that on the big screen) and a double bladed light-saber. I can’t quite put my tongue on it, but the beginning of this scene with the introduction of Maul and the initial fanfare of ‘Duel of the Fates’; it’s just incredible and I don’t know how else to explain it. ‘Duel of the Fates’ is an incredible piece of music as well, with those operatic vocals, sharp violins and bold brass; it’s so obvious why this still sits at the top of John William’s vast catalogue. Most Star Wars fans point to this scene as the best moment of this film, which is true alongside the pod racing and anything that Liam Neeson does. This was the first example of prequel-edition lightsaber combat, which was unlike anything we had ever seen before with incredible acrobatics and phenomenal choreography. I see some didn’t enjoy it as it was seen to be too rehearsed, but I saw it as a representation of the power the Jedi and Sith wielded, as it would look a little like a dance with each combatant predicting and reacting to each others moves at incomprehensible speeds. Regardless, this is arguably the best duel in the saga and that is helped hugely by the majesty of ‘Duel of the Fates’. The duel itself is entertaining, starts iconically as I have already tried to explain, and moves phenomenally towards its climax, guided by the dynamic score. I sound like I’m repeating myself a lot, but this is definitely one of those that I am likely explaining pretty badly and you’ll probably get a better idea of why it’s so great by just watching it.\n\n28 Days Later: John Murphy – In the House, In a Heartbeat\n\nI feel that a lot of people know this song without actually knowing where it originally comes from. Having been used across multiple films, TV shows and trailers since being written for 28 Days Later, the track has become synonymous with moments of dread, terror and maybe looking a little badass while you’re doing it (we’re looking at you Kick-Ass). 28 Days Later is a great film by Danny Boyle and was an interesting reinvention of the zombie genre, and has been said to have set the stage for character driven drama based within apocalypse scenarios. The Walking Dead, one of the biggest shows on television over the past ten years practically hijacked the idea of someone waking up in hospital midway through a zombie apocalypse, with the character of Rick Grime’s mirroring 28 Days Later’s Jim, and their disorientation and bewilderment at what has happened since they were unconscious. The scenes of Cillian Murphy walking around a deserted London are truly iconic, as is a lot of this film. 28 Days Later is a true rollercoaster throughout, with the characters uncertain prospects constantly hanging in the balance, and it culminates in a horrifying climax. After believing to have found safety with the soldiers just outside of Manchester, things get turned on their head when our protagonists find out that the soldiers leader has promised his men women, to repopulate the world. Jim is to be killed when, he, Hannah and Selena reject this idea and it sets the stage for this final showdown. Set to the metal opera, ‘In the House, In a Heartbeat’, Jim breaks free from his captors, breaks back into the manor house and goes about rescuing Hannah and Selena. In some truly brutal scenes, Jim fights off the soldiers, and lets loose zombies to attack the soldiers for him. The song builds slowly, continually ratcheting up the tension as events within the house unfold in darkness. At its climax, Jim brutally murders some soldiers, all whilst backed by this instrumental metal track. I love the tone of the instruments throughout, with the light piano and bass that opens the track, growing steadily into a full blown metal onslaught. This scene truly shows what horrors one would commit just to survive, with the dread-filled music really highlighting the terror and horror depicted on screen.\n\nCasino Royale: Chris Cornell – You Know My Name\n\nIt felt appropriate in a post about music made for film, to talk about Bond themes. Having grown up in the Craig-era of 007, I am most familiar with the modern Bond themes. Whilst you can’t deny the iconic status of some of the older bond themes and the popularity of some of the newer ones, it is this rather underrated effort made for Casino Royale which is my favourite. Casino Royale is my favourite Bond film, and it’s by Chris Cornell so I don’t really need to do much more explaining, but regardless I’ll happily get into it a little more. Bond films, always start with their iconically stylised opening credits, which this song plays behind. I’ve always loved these credits, which is a weird thing to say, but poker, gambling and cards are actually some great visuals for this style. The credits have some interesting little notes to them as well, the pick being images of Vesper foreshadowing the final twist of the film. The song is great on its own merit, I mean Chris Cornell could have sang anything and I would have loved it, and his performance on the track is stellar, just listen to those notes at the end of the track. It’s full of Bond-sounding cues that enable listeners to instantly recognise it as bond, with its horns, violins and jagged guitars; but retains uniqueness and excitement throughout. Furthermore, I love the pace and dynamism of this soundtrack, and I feel that some of the more recent Bond themes (see Adele and Sam Smith) end up seeming a little dreary despite their obvious quality. I just love hearing an action-packed song play just before what is supposed to be an action-packed film, and ‘You Know My Name’ is just that. I’m really just using this as an opportunity to say, give Muse their bond theme (see their 2012 track ‘Supremacy’) and canonically I play the opening of 2015’s Spectre with Radiohead’s effort in the background, which is also worth a listen as it is truly beautiful. The song, mixed with the opening scenes and credits are a great introduction to what would have been a new James Bond at the time. ‘You Know My Name’ seems an appropriate title and hook – it’s truly magnificent. RIP Chris Cornell.\n\nStar Wars (The Empire Strikes Back): John Williams – The Asteroid Field\n\nThis is the last of the Star Wars entries, but I could easily do a post with ten Star Wars soundtrack moments in it, and maybe I will, but ‘The Asteroid Field’ would likely top a list of my favourites. Talk about a great scene, you’ve got the escape from Hoth leading into an enthralling chase through a field of asteroids, iconic lines all over the shop, excellent performances and such an electrifying score. Like with the earlier Empire Strikes Back entry, this scene is full of iconic lines and performances; the crew trying to fix the ship whilst Han tries to get away from their pursuers as well as showing off to Leia following their argument on the planet below. The music reflects the uncertainty by frequently changing direction, with such dynamism throughout the beginning of this scene. C-3PO ends up getting in everyone’s way, but sets up Harrison Ford for one of the greatest lines in Star Wars. “Never tell me the odds”, is such a iconic line, and is just so perfect for Han’s character – whilst it also leads straight into one of the best musical cues in Star Wars. The climax of this track is truly euphoric, with the triumphant horns signaling an end to the jittery and indecisive score (in a good way obviously). I can’t stress enough how much I adore the triumphant high-point of this track, because that’s what is is, truly triumphant as Han leads the crew away from the empire and past the asteroids. I again can’t find enough superlatives to describe how this scene makes me feel, and how great it really is. I find that when I talk about why I love these moments, I struggle to put it into words, and whilst this might only work if you’re a fan of the films, seeing these for yourself truly is the best way to see why they’re so good. John Williams is such a master of his craft and proves how much you can do without words, with these incredibly engrossing Star Wars scores. This is the third of three Star Wars moments, and it’s making me want to talk about it more. If I do branch out into other things, then I’ll be sure to do some posts about my favourites in Star Wars; whether that be moments, scores, or literally anything – I’d enjoy doing it, as a huge Star Wars fan myself. Could you tell?\n\nSunshine: John Murphy – Kanada’s Death Pt.2 (Adagio in D Minor)\n\nSunshine is probably the least well-known film on this list, and even I was unaware of it for a while. Having watched it and truly fallen in love with just about everything within it, I am saddened that I hadn’t seen it sooner. I’ve come to realise my admiration for the films of Danny Boyle, and this is easily his most underrated effort. A manned mission into space to restart a dying sun; conceptually a strong idea but the true excellence lies in the detail. I do understand that the slasher-like aspect towards the end of the film throws some people off, though I like to think its worth noting how the immense power of the sun, which is something the film centers itself on, could do anything to humans. Regardless of that this films is enthralling, with realistic characters that behave like real people do, some truly stunning cinematography (and I can’t state this enough), interesting concepts such as pitting religion against science, the true power and nature of the sun, the desolation of space and workings of the human psyche, as well as this phenomenal score. The score was constructed by Underworld (who I’ve definitely made my opinion of clear before – they’re the best) alongside John Murphy, and it results in this ethereal, synth-led arrangement that seems purpose built for space and sci-fi. So the score overall gets praise from me but the track I’ve actually selected is by John Murphy again. Like with the other John Murphy track I mentioned earlier, this track has also been adapted numerous times for other purposes but it originated here in this beautiful film. And it scores a beautiful moment, where the captain, played by Hiroyuki Sanada and Cillian Murphy’s character head out on a space walk to fix the spacecraft’s shields before the ship is irreparably damaged by the sun. When the Kaneda realises that the only way to fix the shields will be to sacrifice his own life, this beautiful track starts playing, and building towards the climax of his death. The strings, percussion and guitar all work so well in harmony with one another, growing steadily towards a fitting end for the captain. It is such a sad but epic scene, filled with such sounds and sights, with the beautiful moment where Kaneda realises his fate and and turns to face the sun proving a true climax. This scene highlights it incredibly well but Sunshine is such a beautiful film in its entirety, conceptually, visually and sonically – and I adore it.\n\nInception: Hans Zimmer – Time\n\nAnd now we come to what might be the greatest song ever written for film, and I doubt many will dispute this claim. Like many of Nolan’s other films, Inception can be hard to follow for beginners, though the cinematic experience, the sights and sounds keep you entertained on your first viewing. On repeat viewings you start to understand what a conceptual masterpiece this film is, and why it is widely renowned as one of the greatest films ever. The Inception score is one part of many that makes this film as good as it is, and is full of incredible tracks and cues, which is to be expected from a man with the talents of Hans Zimmer. The score can do dynamism with tracks such as the electrifying ‘Mombasa’, tension and a whole host more with the rollercoaster ‘Dream Is Collapsing’ and there is a sense of scale and grandiose throughout the sound design and score, which is never more evident than in the track I’ve selected. ‘Time’ is a beautiful track in its own right, but scores the conclusion of this film masterfully. From the conclusion of the heist, and when Cobb ‘wakes up’, this track builds towards the point of him making it home and seeing his children again. The track opens so gently with simple piano notes and some ambience in the background. The sounds layer ever so subtly throughout its runtime, constantly growing in size and scale, and becoming this grandiose fanfare towards its climax. It is hard to believe that this track only lasts about four and a half minutes, because it feels like it could last a lifetime. The delicate start, gentle build with growing percussion, light guitar, the euphoric crescendo of strings and brass, make this one of the most incredible musical journey’s I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. It allows you to feel somber, whilst still hopeful, epic whilst still reserved; it’s truly hard to describe in all the detail that I want to. And the track leaves as gently as it starts, with the picture focusing on the spinning top, wavering but still spinning as the film cuts to black. Beautiful. I’m going to leave this one purposefully short in regards to why this film is so great, as I will likely talk about it again, although I also want to leave it for you to discover yourself. This is one of, if not my favourite film ever, and I hope that if you haven’t had the chance to experience it for yourself, then you get to discover it on your own one day. This goes for all the films that I’ve spoken about; I love them all and would recommend them, but I don’t want to ruin them for you. I hope you get the same enjoyment out of them that I have, and can see all the little brilliances that I find hard to describe but make them what they are to me.\n\nSo I’m writing this on Tuesday, and I’m still a little gutted about hearing the news that came out yesterday. Daft Punk, consisting of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter, have called it quits after twenty-eight years. Daft Punk have been well-regarded as one of the greatest electronic artists since their inception and the masked duo’s influence on music is immense. Throughout their stellar career, the six-time Grammy award winning duo have put out four studio albums starting with 1997’s ‘Homework’ and ending with 2013’s ‘Random Access Memories’, developing a vast catalogue of groovy and funky hits. Daft Punk’s sound has evolved through time and is hard to pin down to simple genres, enabling them to be incredibly accessible to anyone and everyone. Their popularity and influence within electronic music, and just music in general really is astronomical and it is a shame to see them hang up the helmets after so long. Regardless, it gives me a chance to talk about them, and really thank them for what they have done for music.\n\nIn this post I’m going to talk about ten tracks that Daft Punk have given to the world. There’ll be a selection of their original work, some collaborations, as well as other songs that they’ve helped write or produce. I’ll talk a little about the tracks, whilst using these moments to discuss aspects of Daft Punk’s career generally as well. Regardless of this, I need to stress that this one post of just ten songs could not succinctly detail the effect Daft Punk have had on electronic music and the legacy they’ll leave for generations to come. The influence Daft Punk have had within contemporary music is huge and I could never do this duo justice without writing a dissertation-length piece about everything they’ve done and what they mean to people. I don’t quite have the time for that funnily enough, but I do have time to show my appreciation for what these robotic French fellows have given to the world. All you need to know is that these two mean a lot to me, and have produced some of the strongest music going in their illustrious career. So lets get into it.\n\nDaft Punk – Around The World\n\nWe’ll start at the beginning with one of the best dance tracks that has ever existed. Whilst not their first single, ‘Around The World’ featured on their first record ‘Homework’ in 1997 and attributed to their already-growing popularity. The track became an instant hit in Europe, reaching number five in both France and the UK, number one in Iceland and Italy, whilst also reaching number one on the US Dance Chart and sixty one on the Billboard Hot 100. The track features one of the best basslines around, with the infectious groove mutating throughout as a robotic voice repeats the title over and over again. However, the repetition isn’t even frustrating like you would expect it to be, and the simplicity which surrounds the entire track works really well. The song features just five instruments and few simple patterns, though the track still sounds as phenomenal today as it did when I first heard it. In addition, I like to use this song as a great quiz question, asking how many times ‘Around The World’ is said throughout the full version of the song. The answer is 144.\n\nDaft Punk – Robot Rock\n\nSampling is such a huge part of some musical genres and Daft Punk have been masters of it from the very beginning. With 2005’s ‘Robot Rock’, Daft Punk essentially used Breakwater’s 1980 track ‘Release the Beast’ and made some slight alterations and replacing the lyrics with their typical robotic vocals. ‘Robot Rock’ is unsurprisingly a little more rock-orientated and showcased the duos ever-evolving musical style. The original is actually a great sounding tune, and feels a little ahead of its time in a really great way, and I’d definitely recommend giving that track a listen as well. Either way, it was perfect for Daft Punk and they modified it to make a more electronical sounding version, but still less electronical than most of their earlier work. Whilst some people may view sampling as unoriginal, and this isn’t anyway near Daft Punk’s best use of it, it shows their ability to discover really great older music and repurpose it into something else. There is some really strong uses of sampling coming up later, and whilst I can see the argument for it being somewhat unoriginal by simply reusing older music, sampling is such a key instrument in a producers arsenal and the ability to sample well can create some truly masterful tracks. It’s not just about copying and pasting, its about finding, altering and utilising older music in a different way that it was originally intended.\n\nThe Weeknd feat. Daft Punk – I Feel It Coming\n\nDaft Punk bookended The Weeknd’s 2016 record ‘Starboy’, featuring on the title track opener, and the aforementioned track closing the album. Both tracks are really stellar and you can see the duos influence through each one. ‘Starboy’ is a harsher and more hostile-sounding track with its heavier drumline, though The Weeknd’s vocals and the soft piano notes help to even this out. The bass tone is great though and it continues into the more Daft Punk-influenced ‘I Feel It Coming’. You can really feel the input of the duo within this track, with their signature a little more overt on this track, though still remains subtle and thoroughly enjoyable. ‘I Feel It Coming’ is incredibly soothing, with The Weeknd’s sultry vocals aiding in this primarily. The bass is very Daft Punk, and the robotic voices rear their familiar head through the bridge and final chorus to great effect. The little touches here and there really help to elevate these tracks and are a large reason why they became so popular. The two songs are really strong and show that Daft Punk can work their magic into something a little different compared to what they are known for. I love these collaborations and I must not be the only ones as both singles reached the top ten in both the UK and the US.\n\nDaft Punk – One More Time\n\n‘One More Time’ is widely regarded as one of the best Daft Punk songs around, being their second highest charting song in both the UK and the US. This is an great example of the duo’s sampling ability, by taking the melody of an older track, cutting parts out, reordering it and adding some productional effects, to produce one of the greatest melodies ever in dance music. There is a great video out there showing the breakdown to how the main part of ‘One More Time’ was sampled and I’d recommend it to anyone who doesn’t understand or like sampling. It’ll show you why it is such a great part of music. ‘One More Time’ was Daft Punk’s third track to be nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording and is another track I don’t really need to say much about. It is a euphoric rush and should be getting people on dancefloors for the rest of time, with its pulsating beat, robotic voices and general feel-good vibes. I mean, just listen to the lyrics; they might be simple but they tell you what to do. Celebrate, don’t stop the dancing and do it one more time.\n\nParcels – Overnight\n\nThis is probably one of Daft Punk’s lesser known musical ventures, so much so that I loved this track without even knowing that Daft Punk were involved for the longest time. I adored ‘Overnight’, which is full of bass grooves, chilled synths and an understated disco-soul feeling, for a rather extended period of time before I discovered Daft Punk’s input. Parcels, who hail from Australia, were signed to French/Japanese record label Kitsuné, which in turn led to contact with Daft Punk at a show in France and eventually collaboration between the two on this track. It is astounding to me that I didn’t pick up on it sooner, with the track sounding just like something that could have come off of ‘Random Access Memories’, but alas I was left blinded for quite a while. Either way, the track is a huge tune and showcases what Daft Punk can do, with their input really enhancing the already strong sound from this five-piece. Parcels are worth a listen to as well if you’ve got the time, hard to pin down to a genre but really quite good.\n\nDaft Punk – Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\n\n‘Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger’ is another all-time classic from the duo, featuring all the usual suspects. An excellently worked sample, with robotic vocals, and a funky ever-evolving beat. It sounds very unconventional at its heart but it just works. The robotic voices became a staple of Daft Punk tracks and relate well to the duos public persona and look with their signature helmets. I still don’t know if I’ve seen them without the helmets. The robotic voices are produced using a vocoder and Daft Punk is probably one of the best examples of well-utilised voice effects. Again, it is a rather simple but entertaining track, which continues to mutate throughout; and it has been a stalwart of electronic music circuits ever since its release. Most of Daft Punk’s music speaks for itself, I don’t need to tell you how good it is. In addition, the track was sampled again masterfully by Kanye West in his 2007 track ‘Stronger’, with the vocals from the Daft Punk original working incredibly well in this hip-hop beat.\n\nKanye West – Black Skinhead\n\nNot only did Daft Punk provide the sample for ‘Stronger’, but they were involved in the writing and production of a number of tracks on West’s critically acclaimed sixth record ‘Yeezus’ in 2013. Kanye West has proven time and again to be an expert in his craft, and one of the few around that I’m aware of who can use samples like Daft Punk. It is hard to gauge the input of the contributors within certain projects but it is rumoured that Daft Punk were consulted very early on in the production of the acclaimed album. ‘Black Skinhead’ is one of my favourite tracks on the album and it turns out that Daft Punk are actually responsible for that in a large way. The drums, which really spearhead and drive the track, actually comes from leftover material from Daft Punk’s ‘Random Access Memories’, and I don’t think this track is as good as it is without them. Obviously Kanye is a genius when it comes to hip-hop and production, and ‘Black Skinhead’ is a great track, but it just goes to show the abilities of Daft Punk in other genres outside of their comfort zone. In fact, that’s probably a little silly, I doubt they have a comfort zone so hip-hop would have been no problem for them. Their inputs into ‘Yeezus’ clearly worked, as with West and the rest of the collaborators, their efforts saw the album reach number one in the UK and US album charts.\n\nDaft Punk – Around The World/Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger (Alive 2007)\n\nIt would be wrong not to mention Daft Punk’s ‘Alive 2007’, a truly spectacular live record from their 2006/2007 world tour. In what would turn out to be their last tour as a duo, Daft Punk made a recording of their Paris show in 2007 and released it to the masses. I am so glad they did because I would have hated to had missed out on what an unreal display this show was. Instead of simply playing their already released tracks, Daft Punk reworked their material into something new throughout the show. So the song I’ve chosen is a mashup of their acclaimed tracks (which I’ve already mentioned) ‘Around The World’ and ‘Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger’, which works so unbelievably good. Both songs are incredible on their own, so to put them together and and adding a whole host of new sounds resulted in something really special. There is tension, euphoria, and a hell of a lot more that I struggle to put into words. It is just so unreal. The whole album consists of these mashups, and such reworked material really elevates it above and beyond the field in a number of ways. What’s better than one Daft Punk song? Two Daft Punk songs in one. The album won Best Electronic/Dance Album and the song I’ve chosen Best Dance Recording at the 2009 Grammy Awards and rightly so. The whole album is an adventure from start to finish and would be well worth an hour and a half of your time. I can’t really do it justice.\n\nDaft Punk – Digital Love\n\n‘Digital Love’ is a personal favourite of mine, and whilst it is still highly revered, it is rarely talked about as one of Daft Punk’s top songs. Like so much of their music, there is such a joyous vibe within ‘Digital Love’, with the soft robotic voice discussing unspoken love. The track is very Daft Punk, with all the familiar aspects, but the track remains fresh and unique regardless. The sample used for the melody is incredibly worked, the bass is strong and drums give a great beat. There is also a great digital synth solo which closes the track, bringing it to a great climax. I can’t really describe why this song makes me feel so happy but I can just tell you that it does. I don’t have a whole lot else to say, and that’s not because I don’t want to; I just can’t. As I’ve reiterated numerous times, I can’t do justice to these tracks. I’d rather you just felt the vibe by listening to the tracks yourself as opposed to reading my bad descriptions. It is just such a sweet and positive song, that makes me feel optimistic and positive about the future; and I just love it. I’m sure you will too if you’ve yet to experience it.\n\nDaft Punk feat. Pharrell Williams & Nile Rodgers – Get Lucky\n\nAnd we’ll end with what’s probably the duo’s most well-known track, and who can deny the ‘sound of the summer’. I think ‘Get Lucky’ could be one of the greatest tracks ever written, and it’s hard to dispute even if it maybe did get played too much. I look back on this track incredibly fondly, with Pharrell’s falsetto and Nile Rodgers distinctive guitar lines working incredibly well with the softer disco-funk sound Daft Punk laid down with this track. That bass tone does things to me that I cannot explain, and the drums that pick up around three and a half minutes in really help to drive the song through its bridge section, which feature the typical robot vocals Daft Punk have become infamous for. This song has everything you could want from a Daft Punk song, and is a rightly deserved two-time Grammy award winning track, with the album ‘Random Access Memories’ also picking up two Grammy’s as well. I don’t really need to explain why this song is so great, because some songs just speak for themselves and I certainly don’t need to recommend this song because you’ve definitely already heard it. But I do implore you to give it another listen and appreciate it again; a dig through their discography is always a good time. It is a shame to see Daft Punk go, but I’m so thankful for the lasting legacy they’ve left and I know their influence and imprint on music will never be forgotten.\n\nSo this week I’m going to be combining my love for film and music by looking at ten of my favourite musical moments in film. Music has always been important to the big screen and some of my favourite films are up there because of the quality of the music. Whether its just a great song to score a pivotal moment in a film, a song the characters are actually listening to or interacting with, or a song that provides some blurred tones or comedic effect, music can elevate films in so many ways. I’m going to continue in this format, where I just talk about ten things instead of ranking them because it makes me feel better about missing things out. There was a lot of moments that I left on the cutting room floor so I’ll likely be doing a part two to this at some point down the line.\n\nAs always a few rules. I’m not going to be looking at music that was written for the film specifically, as I will likely do another post about film soundtracks. So I’ll be missing out on some of my favourites, there’ll be no Inception, no Star Wars, no Pirates of the Caribbean and a whole host more. I’ll look to do musical moments in films where the music was written for the film in another post one day, but for this one, it’ll just be songs that already existed and were used well in films thereafter. Furthermore, I will not be including any TV moments in this post, and again I will likely do another post on that if my memory is good enough so that I can remember all the best ones. As always, let me know what I’ve missed and without further ado, onto the ten.\n\nEnd of Watch: Public Enemy – Harder Than You Think\n\nEnd of Watch is a great film and I think it needs more attention that it gets. I’m a big Jake Gyllenhaal fan and this is a great performance from him, but Michael Peña and the rest of the cast is incredible as well. I also love me some Public Enemy so I was bound to love the inclusion of ‘Harder Than You Think’ in this film. End of Watch tells the story of two Los Angeles Police Department officers and has been praised for its realism and gritty portrayal. The scene comes early in the film overlaying a montage of the two officers rolling around in their car patrolling their neighbourhood. ‘Harder Than You Think’ is a great song in its own right, with important lyrics, as Public Enemy always do, and just having one of the best beats in a hip-hop song. This track has been used across media numerous times and I can see why; its just a badass track and makes me feel like I can do anything. Some songs make you feel some kind of way and you just can’t describe it, and this is one of these songs. There is something to be said about including the track in a film about policing, with what Public Enemy stand for; I mean the track literally includes the lyrics “f**k the police”. However, it helps to open the film and its discussion well and I couldn’t think of a better sounding song to roll down the streets to.\n\nReservoir Dogs: Stealers Wheel – Stuck In The Middle With You\n\nSteer clear of this one if you’re not a fan of violence or bad language. Quentin Tarantino is a director who uses music masterfully and you only need to dip into his catalogue to see evidence of that. However I think the best example of that is in his feature length debut masterpiece Reservoir Dogs. ‘Stuck In The Middle With You’ is quite an upbeat track so to use it to score a torture scene is a bold move but it works so well. Watching Mr. Blonde waltz around the warehouse, taunting the doomed police officer, to this track is mesmerising and instantly became iconic. Tarantino’s films are incredibly influential, with modern action taking a lot of cues from his work, with this scene alone being parodied numerous times across contemporary media. The camera work is stellar and the performances from both actors are incredibly strong. Blurring the tones by scoring such a horrific scene with such a song works so well, and it exacerbates the realism when the song pauses as Mr. Blonde walks outside to head to the car, with just traffic, people talking and children playing in the background. There are some wonderful long takes within the scene and its just one of the most iconic musical moments in cinema history. It just works.\n\nAmerican Psycho: Huey Lewis & The News – Hip To Be Square\n\nThis a really iconic scene that is really well acted, with the music again telling a different story than the images on screen. Well maybe not but, it’s still great. Bale plays banker Patrick Bateman, who lives a double live as a serial killer, and this track is playing in the background when he brutally murders Jared Leto’s character, Paul Allen. Bateman literally murders Allen because he has a better business card than him, and because he was jealous of Allen getting a reservation at a nice restaurant. After getting Allen drunk, he prepares for his kill by discussing Huey Lewis & The News, putting ‘Hip To Be Square’ on in the background. He talks about the hidden meanings of the song which relates a lot to Batemans character, whilst waltzing around his apartment with Allen completely unaware. He then hacks at Allen with an axe whilst screaming the whole time, with the upbeat song playing in the background. There’s some meta stuff going on here with the dark scene and the upbeat song, with the songs hidden lyrics mirroring Batemans hidden personality, and its just a well-acted scene which the song has become iconic for. Probably best to steer away from this one as well if you don’t like violence.\n\nTrainspotting: Iggy Pop – Lust For Life\n\nTrainspotting is one of my favourite films and the soundtrack has a lot to do with that. It seems I’m not the only one who thinks that as many regard it as one of the best film soundtracks out there. With Underworld exellent contribution, ‘Born Slippy .NUXX’ scoring the excellent final scene, their ‘Dark & Long’ playing being Renton’s withdrawal and ‘Slow Slippy’ scoring one of the most emotional moments of the sequel, as well as The Prodigy’s remix of the song I’ve chosen masterfully closing out the sequel, it is ‘Lust For Life’ that I’ve chosen. The song opens up the film and plays under Ewan McGregor’s infamous ‘Choose Life’ monologue. The film shows a montage of events whilst introducing the films main characters, and it is just perfect. Hard to describe but that scene is just iconic. I find the monologue quite inspiration despite all the irony that surrounds it, and ‘Lust For Life’ is the perfect songs, both musically and lyrically to describe that. Being stuck in a rut and wanting to get yourself out of it, to choose life, but always finding yourself back where you started. It really opens the film spectacularly and you’ll probably understand it better by giving it a watch, I doubt I’ve done it a lot of justice here because its quite hard to explain.\n\nShaun of the Dead: Queen – Don’t Stop Me Now\n\nEdgar Wright does with his films what I would have wanted to have done to mine, had I been a director. Whenever I was making videos school or at home, I had an obsession with keeping the music important and spent endless amounts of time trying to get the shots I’d taken to match up with cues in the music. Edgar Wright has done that incredibly well and in some of my favourite films. There are great musical moments across the entire Cornetto Trilogy, and he took it to another level in Baby Driver; so much so I could easily reel off ten Edgar Wright musical moments that I love, but I’ll save that for another day and leave you with this one. Not only does the inclusion of Queens’s ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’ soundtrack Shaun, Ed and Liz’s assault on the zombified barman, with every blow in time to the music, but also provides some incredible lines – see “David, kill the Queen” as the music is diegetic within the film itself, playing from a jukebox. This is just one example of Edgar Wrights incredible integration of music into his films, and I am such a fan because it has always been something I’ve tried to do. There are plenty more across his catalogue though so I’m sure I’ll go through some more one day.\n\nThe Interview: Katy Perry – Firework\n\nKaty Perry’s ‘Firework’ is used throughout controversial film ‘The Interview’ and whilst it is good in places, the bit that had me on the floor was just a short three second clip. Upon learning that the fictional portrayal of the North Korean leader’s favourite song is the Katy Perry classic, it is brought up again a few times for great comedic effect. Throughout the actual in film interview, Dave Franco’s character uses the songs lyrics to break down Kim Jong-un once he realises that he’s not the good person he was fooled into believing. Seeing him break down into tears at just the mere notion of the popular song is great, but the best moment using the song came a little later. As the characters try to escape North Korea, they enlist one of Kim Jong-un’s personal tanks and start wreaking havoc among his security forces. Amongst all the death and destruction happening, they cut very quickly to a stark contrast inside the tank, where the three characters are just sat quietly listening to a really faint version of ‘Firework’, and that was enough to have me crying. It’s some great payoff to what was built up throughout the film, and the contrast between what’s happening outside and what’s happening inside in that short shot was really incredibly executed.\n\nFour Lions: Toploader – Dancing in the Moonlight\n\nThis is another short one and again all about the shock value. I was again in tears when I first watched this scene just because the music caught me so off guard. Four Lions is really great film, and touches on some really dark subject material, blending comedy and realism scarily quite well. Telling the story of an incompetent homegrown terrorist cell, Four Lions shows off the outrageous mishaps of the group whilst making some really important observations about its subject material and it makes it such a stellar film. The moment in question which gets it on this list is quite short. The group has loaded up their van with their bombs and is driving to London to attack the marathon. The first shot is of the group at night, all quiet and calm listening to music I believe to be of middle-eastern origin as they seem to be preparing themselves for what they are about to do. This is closely followed by a daytime shot of the entire group singing along to Toploader’s cover of ‘Dancing in the Moonlight’, which had me in hysterics. The facial expressions and the mannerisms of the characters are priceless. You’ll have to watch it to see, but its again just the stark contrast between the tones which makes it so good. The scene also comes straight after one in which the main character cryptically says goodbye to his wife, and there’s a lot of blurred tones. Nevertheless, this dark satirical comedy is one of the best, and moments like this where they turn something incredibly dark into something rather funny are what makes it so strong.\n\nKingsman (The Secret Service): Lynyrd Skynyrd – Free Bird\n\nAnother one to avert watching if you don’t like extreme uses of bad language or violence, but it’d be well worth your time. ‘Free Bird’ is unquestionably one of the best rock songs ever performed by Lynyrd Skynyrd, combining a soft ballad with a rip-roaring solo over its nine minute runtime, and that solo was put to use excellently in the first installment of the Kingsman franchise. Kingsman is known for its inventive way of shooting action scenes and great sense of humour with both on full display in this scene. Colin Firth’s character, Harry Hart, is in attendance of a Westborough Baptist type sermon at a church in Kentucky, and before trying to leave, unleashes one of the greatest lines in the film. He then falls victim to the the villains test experiment, and then the entire church then falls victim to Harry Hart as he tears his way through the congregation under the control of the villain. The ‘Free Bird’ Solo is iconic and it soundtracks one of the best action scenes in cinema, with some cleverly disguised cuts making this four-minute onslaught seem like a long take. The pace and grandiose suits the scene perfectly and its well worth a watch if you can handle a little gore and violence. The Kingsman series has a knack for using music well across the board (see Dizzee Rascals and Prince being used for car chases, John Denver’s ‘Take Me Home, Country Roads’ for one of the best scenes in the second film, as well as Elton Johns ‘Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting’, Cameo’s ‘Word Up’ and especially KC & The Sunshine Band’s ‘Give It Up’ being used for some excellently blurred tones in fight scenes) but this is easily the best example and it is a truly wonderful demonstration of why this film series is so unique. While I should maybe save it for another post, Lynyrd Skynyrd was also used excellently in Con-Air, with ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ scoring one of the greatest scenes in the film, and providing Steve Buscemi with one of my favourite lines in the film. “Define irony; bunch of idiots dancing on a plane, to a song made famous by a band that died in a plane crash”.\n\nAny Given Sunday: Paul Kelly – Peace\n\nThis track is probably the least focal out of all ten moments I’ve selected for this post, as it mostly plays subtly in the background. I’m also not totally sure whether this track was written for the film or not, but it is a worthwhile inclusion regardless. However this moment in Any Given Sunday gives me chills every time I watch it and the music helps to elevate it in every way. Al Pacino’s speech in this film is legendary and can be applied to more than just American football, discussing life and all its battles. Paul Kelly’s ‘Peace’ is a wonderful tune, with just simple guitar lines weaving within one another and poignantly soundtracking this brilliant moment. It is a beautiful albeit simple track regardless and Pacino’s inspiring words work incredibly well with it, culminating in a phenomenal climax where he asks the team “So, what are you going to do?”, with the music building to a climax where the team looks rejuvenated and ready for anything they might face. This ones really good if you need some motivation.\n\nFight Club: Pixies – Where Is My Mind?\n\nSome scenes just become iconic and there isn’t a whole lot to it. I’ve been growing increasingly obsessed with Pixies over the last year or so but ‘Where Is My Mind?’ was the only song I knew of them for the longest time. However I am so thankful for this film for bringing them to my attention all those years ago. Fight Club is one of my favourite ever films an I can’t think of an artist better suited to closing this film than Pixies. I won’t spoil it for those who haven’t seen it, but that is a hint to go and watch it, but the abstract nature of Pixies music goes really well with the perception-altering and dissociative narrative Fight Club has. The ending of the film is truly stellar, as The Narrator and Marla watch the destruction unfold in front of them, with ‘Where Is Mind Mind?’ slowly growing in the background. I don’t think there has ever been a more perfect closing sentence either, with The Narrator seemingly finding some resolution at last, confidently stating “You met me at a very strange time in my life.” Its a truly magnificent ending to such a strong film.\n\nI wasn’t sure what to do for this week, until I remembered this idea I had a long while back. Having listened to The Mysterines ‘Take Control’ and KennyHoopla’s ‘how will i rest in peace if i’m buried by a highway’ a lot in recent weeks, I realised how much I enjoyed the vocal performances of both, with Lia Metcalfe’s smooth and sultry croons and Kenneth La’ron’s dynamism really calling to me. It reminded me to talk about some artists out there who’s vocals are what makes them stand out to me, so here are ten vocalists that I love. I’ve got a few rules with this one, and the main one is that I’m not going be including artists who’s vocal delivery is predominantly rapped, to make it a little easier for me; because that’ll be another post. I’m also going to try and steer away from the classics, and go for artists that are lesser known to the masses, and possibly a bit more known to me.\n\nI was also going to write an honourable mentions section like I usually do with these top ten lists, but as I started writing it, I found it to be a little pointless. There are so many vocalists that I love and I was having immense trouble narrowing this down to just ten. It was almost like trying to name my ten favourite artists, which I cannot and will not ever do. I’m never going to get down every single vocalist that I like so just treat this as ten vocalists that I enjoy and want to talk about. I feel like it’d be better to move away from ranking the things on my blog, and just talk about them. That way I don’t have to feel bad about leaving some out. If I was to talk about vocalist for every band that I liked I’d be here all day, and I ain’t got time for that; maybe I’ll do another ten in the future, and then ten more after that, and so on and so forth. I’d still maintain the best way for you to understand why these artists have great vocals, would just be to give them a listen, and I’d recommend everyone on this list. Anyway, onto the list.\n\nJulian Casablancas\n\nYou don’t get a lot of the great 2000’s indie/garage/post-punk without The Strokes and you don’t get The Strokes without Julian Casablancas. Having influenced bands such as Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand, The Strokes are easily one of the best bands of their time. Casablancas’ vocals are perfectly complimentary to the bands sound and his seemingly effortless and laid-back manner really helps to engineer a thoroughly enjoyable vibe. The processing on Casablancas’ vocals takes nothing away from his talent and really adds to his edge. The dirty distorted effects create this very rough around the edges feel and really enhances the bands signature tracks. Whilst it is obviously be design, sometimes it just feels like I’m listening to a drunk dad doing some karaoke at a wedding but I, as do many others, adore it. Contrary to popular belief, Casablancas is a great vocalist, so go give ‘Is This It’ another listen; its a special record.\n\nSerj Tankian\n\nWhile metal isn’t my favourite genre of music, I do enjoy it and it is full of phenomenal vocalists that go largely under the radar to the masses. Earlier metal has had such an influence on the modern rock that I enjoy today and I have immense respect and admiration for the early pioneers of the genre. There have been many great vocalists in metal from its origins to today, but I think my favourite is Serj Tankian of System of a Down. His ability to switch between shouts/screams and beautifully laid out sustained notes to match the dynamism of System of a Down really makes the band tick, and I adore it. Serj’s ancestry (some Armeninan and Turkish, while also being born in Lebanon and raised from the age of seven in America) is evident in System of a Downs work, with eastern European and middle eastern influences contorting the instrumentals into these beautiful metal tracks. Serj’s vocals might be a little too metal for most, and rather weird as well, but his lyrics are important (search up some of the lyrical content). Just listen to the end of ‘Chop Suey’ and you’ll see how excellent his voice is, the isolated vocals are chilling, in all the best ways.\n\nDanny Miller\n\nI will not stop talking about Lewis Del Mar, its my blog, you can’t stop me. I’ll try to talk less about everything else that makes this duo so good and focus on the vocals, though I’m making no promises. Danny Miller’s voice is irresistible, and I adored it from the first listen; there’s some real soul in there and it sounds so natural. The band is experimental so his voice works when it is sampled throughout tracks as well as when it is processed so much it is designed to not sound like a voice anymore. I can’t really explain it much further, Miller’s voice just sounds so smooth and it just vibes with me. The vocals really suit the chilled out vibe the band has, and while the production works when its used, Miller’s lines just seem so effortless when they just use his natural voice and some layered harmonies. When he needs to get aggressive on a track such as ‘Loud(y)’ he can, and helps to build the tension on other tracks in accordance with that stellar instrumental that every track they release has. Oh well, I tried; just go give them a listen and tell me otherwise. I have never seen a band that is so simple, yet complicated, so smooth and chilled, yet full to the brim with tension and atmosphere. Doubt this will be the last you’ll hear about them from me.\n\nDonald Glover\n\nSort of cheating, sort of don’t care. Wasn’t able to get the likes of Kendrick Lamar or Rage Against The Machines Zach de la Rocha on here (favourite rappers list coming soon) but I can get some Childish Gambino on here. Whilst Glover started his Childish Gambino project with mostly hip-hop stuff, it really evolved and blossomed into something really special. Glover has always had some sung parts on his tracks but he really started excelling on ‘because the internet’ with ‘I. Flight Of The Navigator’, which was a truly beautiful track and performance. He followed that up with some stellar high notes on ‘Sober’ (which has a music video I adore) and then brought us ‘Awaken My Love!’. I don’t think the Prince comparisons are too wild, because you can see where people are coming from, and Ludwig Göransson’s contributions are evident anywhere. Check out ‘Riot’, ‘Me and Your Mama’, ‘Terrified’ and the infamous ‘Redbone’, you’ll see what I mean. He continued that with last years release, with ‘19.10’ and ‘53.49’ featuring on my playlists all year. Glover can rap well, but he has really surprised everyone with his singing voice, with his falsetto dripping in flair and theatrics. Glover is such a multitalented human, and all his work is worth checking out, whether that be his comedy, his film and TV, his film work or his musical genius; its all there.\n\nRob Swire\n\nThere’s a lot of great talent past and present, but I think Rob Swire is probably my favourite vocalist in electronic music. Swire is one of the masterminds behind Pendulum and Knife Party, and his vocals feature on a large number of their tracks. His voice just sounds great for electronic music, with some really powerful vocal lines dotted throughout Pendulum’s discography, mirroring the power of the instrumental. Whilst he uses further production to enhance his vocals, it doesn’t seem artificial or cheap in comparison to the autotune you’d find in a lot of modern R&B; and it really works. Layering harmonies allows for some really sweet vocal lines as well as more controlled screams, which add to the euphoria of Pendulum tracks and it works well with the electronic sound of the instrumentals. Obviously it goes without saying how great Pendulum are, and their ability to blend rock and electronic genres, and Rob just amplifies that. His vocal work is really strong on his collaboration with deadmau5 in ‘Ghosts ‘n’ Stuff’ as well as countless Pendulum tracks, but he also showcases his ability on a more rock-oriented track, with his parts in the collaboration with In Flames ‘Self vs Self’ being really strong. I genuinely got chills when I heard new Rob Swire vocals when he teased ‘Nothing For Free’ on his Instagram in early 2020, and I just hope it isn’t as long of a wait for that new Pendulum album.\n\nYannis Philippakis\n\nI think Foals could be one of the most underrated bands around, and I was definitely guilty of that myself for the longest time. Yannis is a big part of that and his vocals really suit the style of the band. He’s got a really distinct voice so regardless of the style of the track, you can tell that its Foals, and that it is usually great. I used to pass off Foals as being a bit bland, but delving deeper into their discography, you can see some really dynamism throughout. Yannis’ dreamy vocals really help to engineer a strong vibe on stellar tracks like ‘Spanish Sahara’ and ‘Sunday’, whilst he retains the ability to smash harder tracks such as ‘Black Bull’ and ‘White Onions’. His vocals provide an almost anthemic feeling, on songs such as ‘Mountain at My Gates’ and ‘The Runner’ and entices you to chant along in parts. Yannis’ versatility is also really strong, proving that his vocals can work well on dancier tracks such as ‘My Number’, ‘In Degrees’, a stellar remix of ‘Sunday’ by Alex Metric (that sounds like something by Underworld, special mention to Karl Hyde) and most recently a collaboration with CamelPhat in ‘Hypercolour’.\n\nHayley Williams\n\nHayley Williams started her career in a rock band and has broadened her repertoire over the course of career, to really great effect. Whilst growing up I was never a huge Paramore fan, but the thing that always drew me in was Williams’ voice, and eventually I was hooked. Rock needs more female fronted outfits and its great to see how successful Paramore have been despite their change in genre, in no small part to Hayley Williams. Her vocals work with hard rockers as well as upbeat pop songs and that is a feat in itself. Hayley has great vocal control to smash high notes, some great creativity, as well as the energy to bound around stage. There is a standout vocal moment in most songs Williams features on, but for a few picks, check out the final chorus of ‘All I Wanted’ for an isolated listen at those phenomenal vocals, the bridge of ‘Still into You’ and Paramore’s cover of Drake’s ‘Passionfruit’. You could pick most tracks and you’d see why I’m talking about Hayley Williams, and its great to see how her voice has matured as Paramore has evolved and she’s producing some solid solo work.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nProbably the most well-known vocalist on this list, I make no attempt to hide my admiration for Ariana Grande’s work. No one in pop music today has a voice that gets anywhere near Ariana Grande’s and I can’t help myself enjoying most of her songs when they come on the radio. Her vocals are usually rather delicate, though she does demonstrate some real power in places. Having done a little research, her vocal technique is apparently rather unconventional though that actually helps to round out her tone and produce those smooth vocals we’re all used to. I don’t really need to explain it much or give any examples because we’ve all know what I’m talking about. I just really enjoy her voice and it is such a pleasure to listen to. I guess I’ve put Ariana on here just to say I’m not ashamed of liking some of her music; just please stop the rapping because I could listen to those high notes forever.\n\nJohnny Stevens\n\nSo I’m going to be ignoring basically all the hip-hop stuff Highly Suspect tried to do on their last album and just talk about Stevens’ singing voice. Whilst I respect Stevens for trying something new, the vocals on Highly Suspect’s first two records are just too great to be put on the back-burner. The raspy and bluesy tones really work well with the hard rock that Highly Suspect produce and his voice often ascends beyond some really strong instrumentals. Stevens really brings an edge to proceedings, especially on tracks such as ‘Lydia’ and ‘Mom’, bringing both a snarl and raw power to his performances, and you can see the bluesy vibes throughout ‘Lost’ and ‘Bath Salts’. Everything about the track ‘Serotonia’ is truly masterful but Stevens puts in one hell of an effort vocally, excellently bookending an awe-inspiring guitar-driven instrumental. His voice sounds so great, and it also seems so natural and effortless, which really adds to the nature of the music his band puts out. If they want to do some hip-hop then that’s cool, but when I get to finally see Highly Suspect live, I wanna hear this voice properly.\n\nConor Mason\n\nNothing But Thieves are one of the most exciting rock bands around at the moment, as well as a firm favourite of mine, and the vocals of Conor Mason go a long way to getting them where they are today. You can see the comparisons to Muse’s Matt Bellamy, with Mason’s vocal range amplifying everything that the instrumental offers. His falsetto is near impeccable, and fits every scenario, comforting through softer love songs, and a crisp descant to support some of the heavier moments. Mason has also shown an ability to merge in some more spoken word work into some of the bands more politically charged tracks, and it comes off rather well. For some highlights, check out the whole of ‘Particles’, be it the studio or piano version, the anthemic bridge into the final chorus of ‘Amsterdam’, or his absolutely stunning performance on ‘If I Get High’. I could sit here all day recommending his work, as I don’t think he’s ever missed with a track. If you want some real evidence of his talent, see Nothing But Thieves’ cover of Radiohead’s ‘Just’; in reality this could easily be the shortest entry on this list, it would be quicker just to tell you to give his stuff a listen.\n\nIn a combination of wanting to have the entire year to pick from and also working a whole load in December, I’m bringing my top songs of the year a little later than I did last time. I’ve decided to make a longer list than I did last time, which should reduce the large paragraph underneath this one where I rattle off every song that I’ve enjoyed this year, and plus I get to talk about my favourites a little more as well. As like last year, only songs released on or after January 1st 2020 up until December 31st 2020 can be considered and I will be keeping it to one song per artist. I’m not doing a top albums of the year, however songs from all of my favourites will likely be found on this list and so when I get to that song, I’ll likely make note of a few of the top picks from that album as well. I’ve tried ranking them as best I can, but the order is shaky at best. Its more of a top twenty five (in no particular order) best songs on some of my favourite albums of the year. And I’ll reiterate, this is my top twenty five, I’ve tried to include a mix of my personal favourites and some of the best popular stuff. We’ll see how it goes.\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nThere should be a lot less of these as I’m doing twenty five as opposed to ten, though I feel like I’m definitely going to forget some, just as I did last year. I have discovered many other songs such as Boys In The Better Land (Fontaines D.C.), Take Control (The Mysterines), Toro (Liily), Autoportrait (Demob Happy), I’ll Have What She’s Having (WOOZE), everything i wanted (Billie Eilish), God Save The Rave (Scooter), Tokyo Drifting (Glass Animals feat. Denzel Curry) that were released in 2019, that I happened miss off my list and I fully expect it to happen again. Some honourable mentions from 2020 include and are not exclusive to, Bends (The Chain Gang of 1974), 5 Seconds Before Sunrise (VER:WEST & Tiësto), Be Your Drug (Circa Waves), Don’t Start Now – Purple Disco Machine Remix (Dua Lipa), Midnight (HOSH & 1979 feat. Jalja), Battlefield (Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes), Tarantia (Yotto), ROCKSTAR (DaBaby feat. Roddy Ricch), I Wish You Loved You As Much As You Love Him (The Streets feat. Donae’o & Greentea Peng), My House (Elderbrook), Water In The Well (shame), How To Get What You Want (Elise Trouw), Don’t Need Love (220 KID feat. GRACEY), Girl (KC Lights), By Your Side (Friction, Flowidus & Raphaella), Heaven On My Mind (Becky Hill & Sigala) and i miss u (Jax Jones feat. Au/Ra). A lot of these that I’ve left out of my top twenty five are some more electronic stuff which I’ll try and feature in my best of 2020 mix that I’m looking to release next week. As always, let me know any songs or artists that I have missed off that you think have put out a classic this year. On to the best of the best.\n\n26. Gengahr – Heavenly Maybe\n\nSo I had to cheat with this one, like I wanted to with Glass Animals ‘Tokyo Drifting’, because I’ve had them on all year. I had written out this section already when I realised that the single was released in late 2019, and it was the album it features on was released in January of 2020. I’m only realising this as of writing and this song is too good not to mention so I thought I’d chuck it in as a bonus. ‘Heavenly Maybe’ features on Gengahr’s third album ‘Sanctuary’ and is so soothing and dreamy. The bassline is something else on this track and blends really nicely with stuttered guitars and the vocal line, with a falsetto that drops in and out. The gentle building climax ends the song nicely, with extra instrumentation continually layered over and over. Just get that bass groove on repeat though, it really is something else, and elevates this indie rock tune, to some sort of dream-pop majesty. Treat this as my eleventh favourite song from 2019, although it’s probably higher on that list as well.\n\n25. The Weeknd – Blinding Lights\n\n‘Blinding Lights’ is a phenomenal track, blending dark ambient bass, with huge 80’s style synths and The Weeknd’s sultry vocals. I don’t really need to say much more, its a massive track and it deserves all its praise. I think you’ll find this song at the top of a lot of peoples lists and I hear your complaints that this should definitely be higher on mine. And it probably should. However I owe it to myself to leave this at last spot on my list, because of how much I have heard it. Working in a place with a radio that you have no control over has ruined this song a little for me, and while it is great and is likely the biggest song of the year, I have to put it an honourable last out of almost a sense of duty. There were a few songs that I had to hear four times a night, at regular intervals (see also anything released by Dua Lipa this year) and for that sole reason alone, The Weeknd’s biggest single to date can only land at my 25.\n\n24. Roosevelt – Sign\n\nRoosevelt was a bit of a summer love affair for me, having gotten into his chilled electronic sound in the summer of last year, with ‘Sign’ released at the beginning of that season. I was enamoured with his synth-led sound, and particularly infatuated with the 2018 song ‘Under The Sun’, check that one out for sure. However I played ‘Sign’ a lot, coming out just as I got into Roosevelt. The bounce on that synth bassline is huge, and compliments the soft synth chords that open the song. Roosevelts voice is so silky smooth and works really well with his sound. ‘Sign’ is full of dreamy synths and distorted vocals and makes for a relaxed yet still tight-knit and enjoyable track. The song encapsulates Roosevelts easy-going sound and is just perfect for a chilled summers evening.\n\n23. The Strokes – Brooklyn Bridge To Chorus\n\nThe Strokes were one of a few bands that made a return in 2020 but I doubt many had been away for as long. Seven years after their last record, The Strokes released ‘The New Abnormal’ in April of 2020 to a fair amount of praise. Whilst maybe not hitting the heights of some of their previous work, ‘The New Abnormal’ featured a good selection of Strokes-like tunes, my pick being ‘Brooklyn Bridge To Chorus’. This song, like ‘Bad Decisions’ is probably more like their older stuff than most other things on the album, and really reminds me of those classic Strokes songs. While the lyrics refer to moving on from the past, the synths introduced on this album blend well with the guitar-led orchestration, probably the best they do on the whole album. I’m just glad to have The Strokes music back and Julian Casablancas back in my ears.\n\n22. The Streets – I Wish You Loved You As Much As You Love Him\n\nOk I lied about The Strokes being away the longest. Nine years after releasing his fifth record, Mike Skinner dropped a Streets album in 2020. Featuring collaborations with a couple artists you may see further down the list, Skinner’s latest album showed a evolution to stay with modern times and a certain maturity as he grows older. The first three songs on this record are really strong but the third track ‘I Wish You Loved You As Much As You Love Him’ is probably my favourite; flipping between a harder bouncier bass-led section, and a really chilled keys section. Both featured artists, Donae’o and Greentea Peng, really elevate this track, with the formers verse really standing up to Skinners usual brilliance, and the latters voice really elevates the chilled out sections of the track. And they are really the best parts of the track, as the lyrics flip between talking about loving yourself, trying to get away from a bad relationship, and stooping to the levels of others; the key-led sections are so soothing.\n\n21. Daði Freyr – Think About Things\n\nNow most people will tell you that I’m not really a fan of Eurovision, so I wasn’t really moved that 2020’s edition was cancelled. However, it is a criminal offence that this incredibly quirky effort from Iceland wasn’t given the glory is deserved. This song has it all, full of great harmonies, an incredibly infectious dual bassline played with guitar and synths and a surprisingly great brass-led chorus. From the tension filled synth opening straight through to the funkier switch-up, this song has grown on me so much over the year. ‘Think About Things’ is more than just a catchy song though, and the overall performance is really what sends it over the top. The performance is just so intoxicating and mesmerising to watch, and in just the weirdest way; you sort of need to see it to understand. Daði Freyr created something really special with this track; give the music video and live performances a watch if you can, even just for those dances alone.\n\n20. Caribou – Never Come Back\n\nDan Snaith released his fifth album ‘Suddenly’ under Caribou in 2020, and I’ve enjoyed his versatile electronic production over the years. I rediscovered some classics this year including ‘Can’t Do Without You’ and ‘Odessa’ and really enjoyed this cut from his latest album earlier this year. ‘Never Come Back’ is a simple track, as Snaith has said himself, but it works really well. The production on the vocals, both main and backing, works surprisingly well, with the guitars through the end elevating the track well. The gentle build from the beginning is subtle and enjoyable, the keys are bouncy and entertaining and Snaith does really well to engineer a nice chilled vibe with this track, as he has done with so many others over the years.\n\n19. Sam Smith – Diamonds\n\nI never thought I’d be calling a Sam Smith song one of my favourite songs but here we are. I think the praise is well deserved too, as this track is really strong. Smiths voice is really strong on this track as he sings about the perils of material love, and the vibe of the instrumental really suits his vocals. Their is a depth and darkness mixed with a simple but killer bassline and elevates this above a lot of of discography. The electronic production is also managed well and supports the track as opposed to overpowering it. The disco influences are evidence but the minor key and murkiness of the track keeps it fresh and exciting. This was another song that got played so much towards the end of the year, but it really didn’t annoy me as much; in fact I think I enjoyed it more.\n\n18. I DONT’T KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME – Leave Me Alone\n\nIts sort of hard to see the name of this band and not be intrigued, and I was thoroughly satisfied when I had a listen. I DON’T KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME is made up of Panic! at the Disco bassist, Dallon Weeks and Falling in Reverse drummer, Ryan Seaman. Whilst I don’t dislike their original bands, I never really got into them, however this project is really exciting. Whilst the band have called themselves “hipster nonsense”, I think there’s a little more to them then that. The influences are numerous from new-wave to glam-rock, ‘Leave Me Alone’ has so much to it, from electronic interjections, to funky guitar parts. The industrial sounding bassline sounds great through through the verses before switching it up completely in the choruses. Interesting message too, and whilst written about from the point of stardom, can be related to by everybody in regards to culture and conformity.\n\n17. Tame Impala – Is It True\n\nI don’t think Kevin Parker could put out a bad song if he tried. ‘The Slow Rush’ was Parker’s most recent release as Tame Impala since 2015’s phenomenal ‘Currents’ and it is again of full of psychadelic-infused classics. The whole album is worth a listen but I’ve picked the final single ‘Is It True’ for my list. Underpinned by a funky bassline which continues throughout, ‘Is It True’ is a bouncy and faster-paced track compared to the rest of the album and contrasts well with it. There isn’t a whole lot else to say about the instrumental, except that it is just the definition of great vibes. With lyrics that refer to being fearful of the future whilst in love, the track Parker claimed to have created this song in just eight hours, and if that doesn’t convince you of his genius, then I don’t know what will.\n\n16. cleopatrick – GOOD GRIEF\n\nCleopatrick were a band that I’d been aware for a while but had never really took a deep dive into until the latter part of 2020. Having supported Frank Carter & The Rattlesnakes when I went to see them last February and with comparisons to some of my favourite bands around such as Royal Blood and Highly Suspect, I should have known better. Within a week I was obsessed with the Canadian duo, and you know I love me a rock duo. Weirdly enough they hadn’t released anything since early 2019, and then within a week of me getting into them, they dropped ‘GOOD GRIEF’. If you’re a fan of gritty hard rock, you’ll love this one, with great raspy vocals set to a powerhouse of an instrumental. It starts relatively tame before launching into an pounding chorus. The music video is also great, featuring the band holding band tryouts whilst donning ski masks in a disused swimming pool. Lots of noise for just two blokes and I love it, excited to see where these two go from here.\n\n15. Everything Everything – Violent Sun\n\nEverything Everything released a solid album this year, with the opening and closing tracks proving real strong. ‘Lost Powers’ and ‘Big Climb’ open the album really well with ‘The Actor’ and ‘Violent Sun’ closing it off satisfyingly. It is the latter that really captured my attention this year, and while all these songs could fit into a top Everything Everything songs, ‘Violent Sun’ could be possibly one of the best songs the band have ever written. I wrote in my review, the opening sounds like it could have come straight out of an 80’s teen movie, which while it isn’t necessarily a bad thing, the song is so much more than that. The sense of scale with this song is wonderful, with lyrics that detail the beautiful moments you want to hold onto with something terrible on the horizon. The pace helps this track a lot, but the soft instrumental which crescendos into a euphoric chorus really helps to get these emotions across. Everything Everything have said that “this is the last song of the night, the last song of your life” and implore you not be afraid about starting your life or to do the things you want to do, a poignant message I think.\n\n14. Fontaines D.C. – You Said\n\nFontaines D.C. was a band I really got into this year, having discovered their 2019 debut ‘Dogrel’ early in 2020. I was impressed by tunes like ‘Boys In The Better Land’, ‘Liberty Bell’ ‘Sha Sha Sha’ and ‘Too Real’ but they really broadened their sound with a more thought-provoking and deeper record in the summer of 2020. ‘A Hero’s Death’ saw the Irish post-punk outfit experiment with more psychedelic sounds and produced a selection of great tracks that I enjoyed through 2020. The title track is a rampant rocker, with a cynical look at the advertisements and guidance surround people today, with ‘A Televised Mind’ almost sounding more like a softer Prodigy track with its bristling bassline and punchy percussion (credit to Sam Cozens for that comparison, throw out some named credit this time). However my pick is ‘You Said’, which probably doesn’t sound too amazing initially, but those guitar melodies harmonise in a way which just gets me, I can’t really explain it. The whole song has this dreamy, psychedelic, almost lullaby vibe and it just hits all the right spots for me.\n\n14. Pendulum – Nothing For Free\n\nPendulum came back from a much longer hiatus than was really necessary. Sorry guys I don’t make the rules. With a new album potentially on the horizon, Rob teased us with two new tracks, proper old-school D&B track ‘Driver’ and the heavily anticipated ‘Nothing For Free’. After hearing a teaser on Rob Swire’s Instagram back in 2019, I had been waiting for this track for a while, and I was not disappointed. Just hearing Rob’s vocals again would have been enough but this track sounds like it could have been something straight off of 2011’s ‘Immersion’. The build up to the climax is phenomenal, with great synths, horns and pounding percussion, and the whole song just proves that you’ll never lose it. Both tracks released on 2020 are just further stellar examples of Pendulums iconic and original electronic sound, and there isn’t much more I need to say about it; its just great to have these boys back doing what they do best.\n\n12. Lewis Del Mar – Shutter\n\nI was really excited for Lewis Del Mar’s second album this year and ‘AUGUST’ certainly didn’t disappoint. The album maybe didn’t have the highs of the debut, but still had everything that was great about that album. With the deep electronically-infused bass, acoustic guitar, snappy percussion and soulful vocals, the American duo kept their place on my playlists with new additions to their versatile catalogue. I think they did this best with ‘Shutter’ and merged their ability to create both tension-filled rockers, and more chilled-out thought-provokers. The songs percussion helps with this as it is fast and frequent, maintaining a strong pace throughout. Every a"
