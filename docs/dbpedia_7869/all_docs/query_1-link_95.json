        "text": "FRIDAY\n\n'90s female rock: The 1990s was a golden age of female rock vocalists with artists like Natalie Merchant, PJ Harvey, Bjork, Gwen Stefani, Liz Phair, Dolores O’Reardon of the Cranberries, and the late great Chrissy Amphlett of the Divinyls.\n\nThis weekend, Fantasy Springs is presenting two of the best female rock singers of that decade with Alanis Morissette on Saturday and Garbage, featuring Scottish rocker Shirley Manson, on Friday.\n\nALANIS MORISSETTE OPENS UP: On young fame and postpartum depression\n\nGarbage, a post-industrial pop-rock band formed in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1993, is driven by Manson’s evocative vocals. The L.A. Times called them “a force of nature.” “Only Happy When It Rains” is a classic and “Stupid Girl” and “#1 Crush” make for the nucleus of a good concert. I also like their 2015 release with Brian Aubert of Silversun Pickups, “The Chemicals,” and 2014's “Girls Talk” with Mrs. Josh Homme, Brody Dalle.\n\nVIDEO: Hear Garbage and Dalle on \"Girls Talk\"\n\nThis is another great themed weekend at Fantasy Springs.\n\nGarbage, 8 p.m., Fantasy Springs Resort Casino, 84-245 Indio Springs Parkway, Indio. $49-$89. (760) 342-5000\n\nFRIDAY\n\nPower pop rockers: While Fantasy Springs is remembering the ‘90s, the casino to the north, Agua Caliente, is going back to the 1970s and ‘80s for one of its most popular returning bands, Styx.\n\nThis Chicago-based band is known for its power ballads, like “Lady” and “Come Sail Away,” but it can get quirky and, dare I say it, interesting on songs like “Mr. Roboto.” As a live act, they have such a large repertoire of hits, including \"Babe,\" “Fooling Yourself (Angry Young Man)” and “Too Much Time On My Hands,” they can satisfy fans even without original co-lead vocalist Dennis DeYoung, who left the band in 1999.\n\nStyx, 9 p.m., The Show at Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa, 32-250 Bob Hope Drive, Rancho Mirage. $55-$85. (888) 999-1995\n\nSATURDAY\n\nAll-star benefit: Brian O’Connor is one of the best-loved members of the Rancho de la Luna recording family. Nicknamed “Big Hands,” or simply BOC, he’s best known as the tall bassist for Eagles of Death Metal, but he’s also recorded with Josh Homme on “The Desert Sessions – Volumes 9 & 10,” Chris Goss’s Masters of Reality LP, “Pine Cross Dover,” and two Unkle albums: “Nights Temper” and “War Stories.” Earlier this year, he recorded with Dave Catching’s Earthlings¿ at Catching’s Rancho de la Luna.\n\nRANCHO FAMILY GATHERING: What a past party was like\n\nO'Connor was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and Homme gathered his Them Crooked Vultures bandmates Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones to do a benefit concert at the Brixton Academy in London to help pay his medical expenses.\n\nNow doctors say he needs more aggressive chemo and radiation, so his musical friends are getting together again at Pappy + Harriet’s for what they’re calling “A Fantastic Fundraiser for BOC to Kick the (expletive) Out of Cancer.” The lineup includes Catching’s new band the Mojave Lords, Goss, Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, Bone Acres from Los Angeles and what Pappy + Harriet’s are calling “very, very special guests.”\n\nComic Steve Agee, who starred in a mockumentary about the Queens of the Stone Age 2013 album, “&mldr;Like Clockwork,” will host the event. QOTSA is headlining Riot Fest in Chicago that night, but Eagles of Death Metal are off, and you can bet that Homme’s Sweet Stuff Foundation will do what it can to make sure Big Hands gets the medical attention he needs.\n\nFundraiser for B.O.C., presented by Rancho de la Luna, 5 p.m., Pappy + Harriet’s Pioneertown Palace, 53688 Pioneertown Road, Pioneertown.\n\nSATURDAY\n\nTrue confessions: I have been to the Accordion Festival in Cotati, and I have enjoyed it. I've also liked many performances by Dick Contino, the Las Vegas-based \"Elvis of the accordion.”\n\nBut, in the world of Norteño and conjunto music, Ramon Ayala, 71 of Monterrey, Mexico, is called \"the king of the accordion.” He’s recorded more than 110 albums and received four Grammy Awards. He’s listed in “The Handbook of Texas Music” by the Texas State Historical Association.\n\nYou know you’re big when you’ve made “The Handbook of Texas Music.”\n\nRamon Ayala, 8 p.m., Spotlight 29 Casino, 46-200 Harrison Place, Coachella. $35-$55. (760) 775-5566\n\n***\n\nTough choice: It seems unfair that fans of accordion-led Latino music have to choose between Ramon Ayala and the Tejano Music Fest Saturday night.\n\nThe Tejano fest, presented by Volkswagen of Palm Springs in downtown Cathedral City, is being emceed by the Tejano Radio Network’s DJ Jammin J (Jesse Spindola). Headliners include Mike G y Los Realez from Lubbock, Texas, La Justicia, Katie Lee Ledezma y Su Conjunto, Ambixion, Ruben Loredo y Su Conjunto, and Santiago Garza y La Naturaleza.\n\nConjunto Crazy Promotions said the demand for this festival has actually exceeded expectations. “After our first 32 reserved tables sold out in just two weeks with little advertising, we decided to add 18 more reserved tables,” said Lupe Salcedo Hernandez. “Those tables are almost sold out with less than a handful available.”\n\nMaybe you can sample a little of the Tejano fest and then drive to Coachella to see the king of the accordion.\n\nTejano Music Fest, featuring the music, food, art and culture of Mexican-Americans from south, central, and west Texas, 4-11 p.m., Civic Center Plaza, 68-700 Avenida Lalo Guerrero, Cathedral City. Free admission. (760) 770-0396\n\nSUNDAY\n\nDezart benefit: Michael Holmes has had some top acts at his Purple Room, including Tommy Tune and, most recently, Diane Schuur. But his own shows, parodying Judy Garland every Sunday and singing jazz with his trio every Wednesday, and doing a hilarious parody of Carol Channing in the monthly “Palm Springs Jump” revue, are the bedrock of his programming.\n\nThis Sunday, Holmes is donating all ticket sales from his “Judy Show” to the local theatre company, Dezart Performs. He’s also arranged 100 percent matching funds for food and beverage purchases. It's a testament to how good Holmes thinks Dezart Performs really is.\n\nDezart Performs begins its 10th anniversary season Nov. 3 with Matthew Lopez’s new comedy, “The Legend of Georgia McBride,” about an Elvis impersonator who is fired from a Florida dive bar and replaced with a B-level drag show. It runs weekends through Nov. 12 at the Pearl McManus Theater in the Palm Springs Woman's Club, 314 S. Cahuilla Road. Tickets: (760) 322-0179"
