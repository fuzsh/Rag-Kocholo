        "text": "This playlist came together pretty well. It’s always a little difficult fitting together my top 10 into a playlist that flows nicely because the albums are often quite a wide variety of styles. This year I think Dead Pioneers and KAMAUU were those difficult ones to transition in and out of, but in the end it worked pretty well.\n\nApple: https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/23-12-17-fortnightly-favorites-10-1/pl.u-d2b0lNjIMW96vGJ\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7j7pW6qhJQSldZNwQnRqYd?si=95823db0b86b4873\n\n10. The Veils – …And Out of the Void Came Love\n\nIt had been 7 years since The Veils last full-length album, Total Depravity. There was Finn Andrew’s solo record in 2019, but some big events lie between now and last getting music from them. Big events that shaped the writing and making of this album. The COVID pandemic, but also the birth of Andrew’s first child. Also, there was a recovery period after Andrew’s broke his wrist on-stage. This record was an excellent reward for waiting through the silent stretch since 2016. There are a lot of influences melded into the Veils sound, but this is perhaps the most clearly they’ve channeled Nick Cave. I got to see them live back in 2016, and they put on a great show. If you get the chance, then go see them!\n\n9. KAMAUU – LACUNA in the House of Mirrors\n\nEnergetic, bombastic, trippy, clever, difficult to categorize Hip-hop, KAMAUU gave us a great one this year. This was the kind of genre-blending, boudary-pushing Hip-hop that I love. The way this one flows start to finish is beautifully constructed, and you can tell it’s been thought out in every way. It’s rare to come across something that truly feels different from anything you’ve heard before, and this one hit me that way. The second half of the album maybe doesn’t quite live up to the first half just because the pacing drops so much, but still has some key high points.\n\n8. Dead Pioneers – Dead Pioneers\n\nBlasting punk interspersed with dryly-delivered, darkly-humorous spoken-word. Certainly the most bluntly socio-political album on this list, and that’s really what you need from a punk album. From the first line – “America is a pyramid-scheme, and you ain’t at the top” – delivered over guitar feedback, Dead Pioneers tell you exactly what to expect. Then they proceed to deliver with track after blistering track of righteous anger calling out the hypocrisy of a nation “born in the bosom of colonialism”.\n\n7. Cleo Sol – Heaven\n\nBetween her solo records and the collective, Sault, Cleo recorded 14 albums in 4 years. In regard to Sault, there was initially some mystery as to who exactly was involved, but it gradually became know that it is primarily the work of Cleo and her husband… the English producer known as Inflo. They’ve released a massive body of work recently, and all at such a high level of quality. As far as her solo work goes, Mother appeared in my year-end favorites of 2021 at #11. If anything, I’d put it higher if I made that list again. Heaven was the first of 2 albums Cleo released this September with Gold following 2 weeks later.\n\n6. This is the Kit – Careful of Your Keepers\n\nKate Stables latest collection feels a well-practiced meander. There’s an exploratory aspect, but very purposeful and disciplined. While it has a lo-fi feel at times, there are also brass and woodwind compositions interspersed creating a much bigger, more lush sound. Certainly, there is influence here of familiar Indie names like Sufjan Stevens and Iron&Wine, but also unafraid to delve into older influences as well (track 3 of this record, “Take You to Sleep”, dives headlong into jazz exploration). Paste Magazine’s review noted that the more experimental aspects of of Stables’ sound are balanced well by the use of repetition in the lyrics to keep it all grounded. This album, to me, was reminiscent of Sufjan Steven’s Greetings From Michigan album. That one’s a personal favorite of mine from… 20 yrs ago?! Well, I wonder if that was subconsciously why I enjoyed Careful of Your Keepers so much…\n\n5. Flyying Colours – You Never Know\n\nI came across this lush, shoegazey, dreampop delight back in March at just the right moment. Sometimes that’s all it really takes to connect with an album. It’s just the right time and place, and it grabs you and sticks with you. It’s the Australian quartet’s 4th full-length, and I’m a little stunned how they manage to write and record the perfect album for driving on a rainy spring day in the PNW. It just fits so well, and really hits the sweet spot. They’ve struck such a good balance between that wall of shoegaze sound, and memorable vocal melodies.\n\n4. Cleo Sol – Gold\n\nYep, they’re both here. These Cleo Sol albums came along in September, and were just what I needed. This album, think showcases her raw vocal ability more than I’ve ever heard before. Her voice sounds so impressive in the bigger moments, but she also has such a keen awareness of when to choose those moments. Reflections on God have always played a role in her songs both solo and with Sault, but some of her best are here. It’s an intimate album.\n\n3. Pink Birds – All is Free and Better\n\nThis one was my top record for much of the year with it’s charming psych-tinged country. They carry this style through the whole album until a final left turn into an unexpected cover of Bjork’s “Army of Me” to close things out. I found out later on in the year that they formerly made an album under the name Ladies Gun Club. A quick google search may show why they changed it, as the only thing you can find are some find are some rather political facebook groups. This was one of those albums that was a little maddening because I loved it so much, but it seemed like I couldn’t find anyone else who had ever heard of it. I first was directed to it by a post by Brian Wright, who produced the album. I definitely hear some similarities in the sound to his past work. Altcountry that blows past some of the barriers that many country artists stay within.\n\n2. Angie McMahon – Light, Dark, Light Again\n\nThis is a beautiful album expressing relatable emotions in a hook-laden altpop sound that is at times anthemic and at times close, quiet, and intimate. Angie has beautiful vocal ability, this record, additionally, weaves a rich tapestry of guitar and piano-driven tunes that sink deep into you. They have an earworm quality in the best possible way. The sort of thing that makes you want to memorize every word, and then get to work listening over and over. Themes over the album of learning to love oneself through the heartbreak, anxiety and letdowns of life make this one the kind of album that you the need in your life.\n\n1. Jeffrey Martin – Thank God We Left the Garden\n\nIt’s the stark simplicity of this one that accentuates how special it is. Thank God We Left the Garden centers itself firmly on all the complications of humanity, as may be suggested by the title bringing to mind original sin. To Martin, while this comes with all manner of struggles, it’s also what makes life beautiful and rewarding. His voice has a significant rasp, but he uses this to his advantage by balancing it with a controlled gentleness that gives weight to the already weighty lyrics. Regret, family tragedy, scraping by through life, and discovering ways to find peace through it all. The sparse sound gives space for these simple, beautiful, human words to be the focus, but even so when you listen to the guitar lines they in no way dull. There’s a warmth to the sound of his voice and guitar, and the themes of brokenness don’t fall into despair. Rather than that, Martin focuses on finding comfort, peace, and even hope in that humanity.\n\nTracklist:\n\nCleo Sol – Self\n\nKAMAUU – the vibe\n\nFlyying Colours – I Live in a Small Town\n\nAngie McMahon – Divine Fault Line\n\nThis is the Kit – This is When the Sky Gets Big\n\nThe Veils – No Limit of Stars\n\nCleo Sol – Please Don’t End It All\n\nJeffrey Martin – Garden\n\nPink Birds – Trophies\n\nDead Pioneers – Bad Indian\n\nThe Veils – Bullfighter (Hand of God)\n\nJeffrey Martin – Red Station Wagon\n\nThis is the Kit – Inside Outside\n\nDead Pioneers – We Were Punk First\n\nKAMAUU – advantages\n\nCleo Sol – Love Will Lead You There\n\nAngie McMahon – Fish\n\nFlyying Colours – Modern Dreams\n\nCleo Sol – There Will Be No Crying\n\nPink Birds – Howling Wind\n\nDead Pioneers – Political Song\n\nCleo Sol – Old Friends\n\nCleo Sol – In Your Own Home\n\nFlyying Colours – Do You Feel the Same?\n\nKAMAUU – situations\n\nThe Veils – Made from Love With Far to Go\n\nThis is the Kit – Careful of Your Keepers\n\nJeffrey Martin – I Didn’t Know\n\nAngie McMahon – Making it Through\n\nPink Birds – Army of Me\n\nBeen doing this 7 yrs now.

Well, here’s the playlist:\n\nApple: https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/23-12-10-fortnightly-favorites-2023-25-11/pl.u-11zBVj1u8GyVYKP\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2FNjkQKmwV4QEWxNzCmYWO?si=a114824eb7c6429d\n\n25. 3rd Secret – 2nd 3rd Secret\n\n3rd Secret returns with their 2nd record. The rock supergroup consists of Kim Thayil (Soundgarden), Krist Novoselic (Nirvana, Giants in the Trees), Matt Cameron (Soundgarden, Pearl Jam), Bubba Dupree (Void), Jillian Raye and Jennifer Johnson (both of Giants in the Trees). The grunge elements come through in fine form on “State of Mind”, and the vocalists take things to the most interesting and engaging places on songs like “Climb Aboard” and “So Close”.\n\n24. Bully – Lucky For You\n\nI still think of Bully as a new, young band sometimes, but their sound has developed a lot. Time flies, and those lost pandemic years are tricky. I realize now it’s been 5 years since I saw them play for Sub Pop’s 30th anniversary party. They still matured a lot in their writing, and in the complexity of their sound, but they maintain that driving energy and Alicia Bognanno’s voice commands attention better than ever.\n\n23. Smokey Brights – Levitator\n\nIf you have the chance to see Smokey’s live then I recommend it. Levitator captured their energy perhaps better than past records. They have this anthemic sing-along-able quality to their best material. I often think they should be more popular than they are because of that quality. This is a great record for singing along while you drive. I recommend giving that a try at some point.\n\n22. Sufjan Stevens – Javelin\n\nSufjan has, perhaps more than any artist I listen to regularly, an ability to pair intracacy with intimacy. There are so many layers and little pieces to reward the repeated listen, but also displaying fragility and emotional depths. Javelin displays his strengths well.\n\n21. PJ Harvey – I Inside The Old Year Dying\n\nThis is certainly on the more challenging and inaccessible end of the spectrum, and if you’re not already familiar with Polly Jean this probably isn’t the place to start. Based, in part, on her novel-in-verse from 2022, Orlam, this record covers a bold array of sonic territory. It’s quite a distant cousin to her last album, Hope Six Demolition Project, or to her most well-known, Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, but I found it a fascinating album.\n\n20. Temps – PARTY GATOR PURGATORY\n\nIt was over 2 years ago that James Acaster appeared on the Jonathan Ross Show dressed as a “Party Gator” with no explanation. The comedian actually had the suit made as part of this project, but it was not ready to announce… so the appearance in the suit seemed a bit of isolated weirdness. Quelle Chris, Xenia Rubinos, and Open Mike Eagle are among the appearances on this wild, genre-chameleon record. Acaster has always been vocal about his love for music of all genres, and this project puts that on full display. It’s an album made by music nerds for music nerds. No wonder I liked it.\n\n19. Brandee Younger – Brand New Life\n\nJazz harpist, Brandee Younger, was among my favorites back in the Spring of this year, and the album stuck with me. Her own unique musicianship is blended in with an excellent group of contrasting guests. The beats of Pete Rock and 9th Wonder, and the gorgeous vocals of Mumu Fresh being highlights for me.\n\n18. The Hold Steady – The Price of Progress\n\nThe Hold Steady have built a tradition now of excellent storytelling rock. Of course, Craig Finn’s lyricism is the cornerstone of this, but the band continues to crank out great material all around. Never formulaic, but always recognizable. They can pull a trick similar to what they’ve done before, but it never feels rehashed or stale. The characters of the stories in Finn’s lyrics are so often down-and-out… but the stories nearly always seem laced with hope. A Hold Steady album will have some sadness, but it won’t be depressing.\n\n17. boygenius – the record\n\nThe first boygenius EP back in the lifetimes ago world of 2018 seemed like it might be a one-off. I’m so glad it wasn’t, and Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker came together again for this album. Each artist has now established themselves more firmly with massive solo albums since last they gave a collective effort. Their growth here as songwriters and their ability to blend and collaborate well is so great to see.\n\n16. Wild Nothing – Hold\n\nIs Exploratory Indie Synth Pop too contradictory of a description? This album was apparently written early on in the COVID pandemic, and coincided with the birth of Jack Tatum’s son. This prompted a lot of change in how the material came out. The result is my favorite Wild Nothing album to-date by far. An album ready to jump into and out of different genres while maintaining a cohesive album.\n\n15. Dessa – Bury The Lede\n\nWith most of the Doomtree collective falling silent in the last couple years, with the future of the group uncertain, Dessa continues to carry that standard. It is good to see that Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger are still involved in the production of her material, so that nucleus is still there. Dessa herself, continues to keep growing and trying new things. Bury the Lede seems more adventurous than some past releases, but maybe less cohesive than Chime or Parts of Speech.\n\n14. GENN – Unum\n\nLondon-based, Maltese psych-rockers, Genn, really caught my attention this year. There are hooks on hooks on hooks in this highly layered, complex storm of sound. It’s the sort of thing that makes you listen again, and be happy for it.\n\n13. Kimmortal – Shoebox\n\nThis is only Kimmortal’s second album, and that blows my mind. This album is a mindblowing, genre-melding, ingenious creation. Opening with the aggressive industrial beat and chant of “Ancient” and journeying through ukulele-accompanied crooning at some points, and closing with the singalong, pop-memior of “Love”. This one could easily have landed top 10, I think.\n\n12. Marta & Tricky – When It’s Going Wrong\n\nRuntime on this release is only 19 minutes, so really it’s an EP rather than a full album, but that is testament to how much I enjoyed this collab from Tricky and Marta. The way it flows start to finish almost makes it feel like one 19-minute song. Marta’s vocals gentle, yet intense. They just seem to float on top of these excellently layered beats from Tricky.\n\n11. El Michel’s Affair & Black Thought – Glorious Game\n\nI expect to see this one on a lot of lists here at the end of the year. Black Thought gets his name mentioned floated in discussions of best rappers of all time, and in recent years I’ve noted his solo material highlighting his skills more than ever. This particular partnership with American cinematic soul group, El Michel’s Affair is a great one. Of course, Black Thought has a history with rhyming with a live band given his history with The Roots. On the other side of things, El Michel’s Affair has recorded and performed live with numerous rappers, so it makes sense this would work well.\n\nTracklist:\n\nBoygenius – Anti-Curse\n\nBully – Days Move Slow\n\nThe Hold Steady – Sideways Skull\n\nWild Nothing – Prima\n\nSmokey Brights – No Getting Out\n\nKimmortal – Get Better\n\nBrandee Younger, Pete Rock – Livin’ and Lovin’ in My Own Way\n\nEl Michels Affair, Black Thought, Son Little – Protocol\n\nTricky, Marta – TodayGenn – The Sister Of\n\nSufjan Stevens – Everything That Rises\n\nDessa – Rothko\n\nPJ Harvey – Autumn Term\n\nTemps – bleedthemtoxins\n\n3rd Secret – Climb Aboard\n\nGenn – Days and Nights\n\nMarta, Tricky – Moving Through Water\n\n3rd Secret – State of Mind\n\nKimmortal – Ancient\n\nTemps – lookaliveplaydead\n\nEl Michels Affair, Black Thought – Grateful\n\nThe Hold Steady – Carlos is Crying\n\nBrandee Younger, Meshell Ndegeocello – Dust\n\nWild Nothing, Hatchie – Headlights On\n\nDessa – Tell Me Again\n\nBoygenius – Cool About It\n\nSufjan Stevens – Goodbye Evergreen\n\nPJ Harvey – A Child’s Question, August\n\nBully, Soccer Mommy – Lose You\n\nSmokey Brights – Long Goodbye\n\nI’ve definitely been less consistent with posting here this past year, but I suppose that is expected in the first year of parenthood. I love sharing music with people, but the writing part has certainly dropped in my priorities. I hope you have enjoyed discovering music with me again this year.\n\nApple link: https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/22-12-11-the-fortnightly-playlist-2022-favorites-1-10/pl.u-76oN9o3FWmyr0qe\n\nSpotify link: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4RRdtCgPP1yELQ1zXNbgeL?si=33488454eed04691\n\n10. The Beths – Expert in a Dying Field\n\nThe Beths came out with this excellent album this year filled with infectious vocal and guitar hooks and a balance of clever and charming lyrics. I loved this straightforward, indie rock album. It’s earnest while maintaining a lighthearted feel. Elizabeth Stokes’ vocals are perfect, and the band strikes just the right balance of when to keep things light and when to get loud.\n\n9. Danger Mouse & Black Thought – Cheat Codes\n\nA pair of Hip-Hop masters working together for their first full-length album together. Yes, I say “Hip-Hop masters” even though Danger Mouse hasn’t made what you’d strictly call a Hip-Hop album in quite awhile before this. In spite of that fact, few would disagree with me, I think. In interviews the pair have said they’d wanted to work together for years, and it just didn’t come together until now. Personally, I could hardly be happier with the results. This album is amazing with both Danger Mouse and Black Thought at the top of their game, and top notch guest appearances from Michael Kiwanuka, Run The Jewels, Raekwon, Dylan Cartlidge and more.\n\n8. Stromae – Multitude\n\nThis album addresses all kinds of issues. Depression and suicidal thoughts, social inequalities, love, joy all touched on, and that’s just getting started. Musically, there’s a broad range of styles and instrumentation used by the Rwandan-Belgian artist and his band. There is an interesting mix of acoustic instruments along with the keyboards, electronic beats and loops, and the vocal work is striking.\n\n7. Sault – 11\n\nThis album is very much the style I’ve come to expect from Sault amid the whirlwind of music they’ve released in the past 3 years. Of course, last month’s 5 albums was quite a step up in prodution from already an prolific rate of releases. While some of it I feel I’ve barely engaged with, this album stood out to me the most. Sault uses sparse instrumentation built mainly on solid bass grooves and great percussion, and nearly always allowing the vocals to take the focus. There’s not a weak track to be found here.\n\n6. ODESZA – The Last Goodbye\n\nI’ve got a long history with this group, having first heard them on late night college radio. These two started making music while attending Western Washigton University in Bellingham, WA. Seeing them go from that point in their career to where they are now is so cool. They just keep honing their craft, and each new release becomes their best.\n\n5. Cheekface – Too Much to Ask\n\nThe tongue-in-cheekiest of releases that I’ve ever featured on the Fortnightly Playlist, I think. This album is ridiculously fun, and yet still at times poignant. I first heard “Pledge Drive” on the radio, and was immediately hooked. I had to hear that song again. Then the album kept giving with “We Need a Bigger Dumpster”, “I Feel So Weird!”, “Featured Singer”, “Noodles” and “You Always Want to Bomb the Middle East”.\n\n4. Making Movies – XOPA\n\nBack again, Making Movies have their thir straight album find it’s way into my top 10. 2017’s I Am Another You and 2019’s Ameri’kana landed at #8 and # 6, respectively. There’s something about the percussion mixed with their psych rock guitar and passionate vocals. It is an intense album, but not without soft moments. I love what Making Movies do.\n\n3. Shearwater – The Great Awakening\n\nThis was probably my most anticipated album of the year. It was so different from Shearwater’s previous album, Jetplane & Oxbow, which I maintain is a modern masterpiece. The Great Awakening is a much more atmospheric album, and does not have the driving mid-tempo pace that marked Jetplane… Even so there is a mystery and intensity that builds in this record, and finally breaks wide open at track 6, “Empty Orchestra”. After that release it dives back down again, and doesn’t really open up again until a brief part of the final track, “Wind is Love”. As different as it was from their previous, I developed a love for this record as well.\n\n2. Marlowe – Marlowe 3\n\nThe project of L’Orange and Solemn Brigham is another consistent top 10 artist here at The Fortnightly. L’Orange’s production is unmatched in my opinion, and these tracks are of all the signatures I’ve come to love. The muted guitar tones, the horns, and, of course, the weaving in of samples from radio theatre. Solemn’s flow and delivery still feels urgent and near breathless. It’s very raw Hip-Hop laced with clever wordplay, and never leans too hard on chorus hooks.\n\n1. Sampa The Great – As Above, So Below\n\nHaving been based in Melbourne for several years, Sampa Tembo found herself unable to return to Australia from her native country, Zambia, due to COVID restrictions. She has said in interviews that she’d always intended to return and invest her time in helping build the music scene in Zambia, but that in the making of this album it happened by necessity. Family and home is very much a part of this album. Her uncle is a former member of the Zam-rock band, Witch, who appear on “Can I Live?” and Sampa’s sister and cousin feature as well and toured with her band. This album seemlessly weaves together psychedelic rock, Hip-Hop, and traditional african vocal stylings. I’ve never heard another album like this one.\n\nTracklist:\n\nThe Beths – Expert In a Dying Field\n\nCheekface – We Need a Bigger Dumpster\n\nMaking Movies – Calor\n\nStromae – L’Enfer\n\nDanger Mouse, Black Thought – No Gold Teeth\n\nMarlowe – Past Life\n\nOdesza – Behind the Sun\n\nShearwater – There Goes the Sun\n\nSampa The Great, Witch – Can I Live?\n\nSault – Glory\n\nStromae – Sante\n\nCheekface – I Feel So Weird!\n\nThe Beths – Knees Deep\n\nMarlowe – My People\n\nMaking Movies – Sala De Los Pecadores\n\nSault – Fear No One\n\nShearwater – Empty Orchestra\n\nOdesza, Olafur Arnalds – Light of Day\n\nDanger Mouse, Black Thought, Michael Kiwanuka – Aquamarine\n\nSampa The Great – Bona\n\nMarlowe – Light Trip\n\nDanger Mouse, Black Thought, A$AP Rocky, Run The Jewels – Strangers\n\nMaking Movies – XOPA\n\nSault – Higher\n\nStromae – Bonne Journee\n\nOdesza, Bettye LaVette – The Last Goodbye\n\nCheekface – Pledge Drive\n\nThe Beths – Head in the Clouds\n\nShearwater – Wind is Love\n\nSampa The Great, Chef 187, Tio Nason, Mwanje – Never Forget\n\nAnnual reminder: I’m not objective. These are my personal favorites, and I make no claims that these are “The best” albums of the year.\n\nApple link: https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/22-12-4-the-fornightly-playlist-2022-favorites-25-11/pl.u-JPAZB0ZuDv9egl2\n\nSpotify link: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5P2tSg7Qf4pmQC5ogONDAb?si=196d14b6d9b44183\n\n25. Sudan Archives – Natural Black Prom Queen\n\nI”ve been a fan of Sudan archives since before she had a full-length album out. Her early EPs and her first album, Athena, in 2019 were marked with prominent violin riffs either plucked or bowed. For me, this was what set her apart and made her music so interesting. The violin work is more subtle on this album, and at times drowned in swirling electronics. It’s still a very good album, but the parts I enjoyed most were when that violin came through more. “Ciara” and “#513” were a couple of my favorite tracks.\n\n24. Courtney Marie Andrews – Loose Future\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews has one of the most beautiful voices in the alt-country/American world right now. This album has a little more upbeat, lighter sound than her last couple records. There are points where the blues/gospel sound that marked 2018’s May Your Kindness Remain and the sparse, melancholy of 2020’s Old Flowers come through in this record as well.\n\n23. Open Mike Eagle – Component System With The Auto Reverse\n\nThere aren’t other rappers who sound like Mike Eagle. The way he weaves in melodies to his raps, his wordplay, his often laid-back delivery just take very unique angles. There is something about the way he can lean into the label of “art-rap”, but can also keep his material markedly accessible.\n\n22. Taj Mahal & Ry Cooder – Get On Board!\n\nA pair of legends here, and no one will convince me otherwise. Ry is my alltime favorite guitar player. Some are surprised by this statement, but he has an inarguable sense of how to fit into a song. It just feels right. Taj and Ry played in a group called The Rising Sons when they were teenagers. Their debut was unreleased, and eventually they both found their ways into their solo careers. That debut album eventually saw the light of day in 1990, and this is the first time since that 1966 album that they’ve made an album together. It is an album recalling two bluesmen that Ry and Taj saw as legends when they were young, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee. It’s a work of reinvention, but with love. They have a love and respect for the material that you can really hear throughout.\n\n21. Sault – Today & Tomorrow\n\nSault overwhelmed fans in November by dropping 5 new albums with no prior announcements. I haven’t really fully engaged with all of them to be honest, but (spoiler) you’ll be seeing more of them in my list this year. This album is very different than what Sault have released in the past, and sounds like a whole different project overall. It has a lo-fi indie blues-rock sound so starkly different from the gospel R&B-tinged indie that they’ve established for themselves. The unexpected change for this particular album of their 5 releases landed well with me.\n\n20. Santigold – Spirituals\n\nSantigold cannot be pigeon-holed, and Spirituals is just the latest in the mountain of evidence to this point. Reggae, Dancehall, Punk, Soul, R&B, Electronica… she can take it all and make it her own. Similar statements could be said of subject matter, as she is willing to approach a wide-array of topics and issues in her writing.\n\n19. Ibibio Sound Machine – Electricity\n\nThis new album did not quite strike the balance of energy that made me love 2019’s Doko Mein, but it is still a very good album with some songs that I really enjoyed. While Doko Mein relied on funk grooves and joyful energy, Electricity finds it’s home in synth-laden electronica and emphasizes Eno Williams vocals.\n\n18. Built to Spill – When the Wind Forgets Your Name\n\n29 years since they’re debut album, Built to Spill are still making engaging and relevant rock music. Doug Martsch and company re-emerging 7 years after the last record, Untethered Moon. And I’m really glad that Built to Spill are back and had at least this one left in the tank, as I think it’s a great indie rock album.\n\n17. Ibeyi – Spell 31\n\nI was immediately struck by the music of twin-sister duo, Ibeyi. Their debut album, Ash, was my #2 album in 2017. I was excited to learn they were finally giving us their follow up, and I have enjoyed this album. This one is really strong straight through the whole record, but some high points for me are “Made of Gold” and “Rise Above”.\n\n16. The Smile – A Light For Attracting Attention\n\nI don’t know how this project came about, but I like it. Sons of Kemet drummer, Tom Skinner, joins Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead for this unexpected record. I really enjoyed Greenwood’s guitar work on this, and how well it meshes with Skinner’s jazz rhythms. Then the swirling synths surrounding it all and Yorke’s instantly recogizable vocal cutting through clear.\n\n15. Los Bitchos – Let the Festivities Begin!\n\nMembers hailing from Uruguay, Sweden, UK and Australia, Los Bitchos seems immediately like an implausible project. Now take in addition that they meld surf rock, samba, turkish pop, and a couple dozen other genres together to create this fascinating instrumental record, and it’s enough to blow my mind. Please tell me I’m not the only one hearing that Oingo Boingo riff on “Tropico”… was that intentional theft or sub-conscious, I wonder?\n\n14. Sault – Earth\n\nThis is the most spiritual-themed Sault record to date, leaning hard into certain gospel elements in their sound and delving into more religious language than I expected. It comes through as genuine and earnest without being preachy or over-zealous. It’s a very reflective record.\n\n13. Poppy Ajudha – THE POWER IN US\n\nI first heard Poppy Ajudha a few months back on the radio, and the song was “No!” Upon listening to the album, I found this melodic punk tune had been the tip of the iceberg in terms of her sound. She expertly tied together genres in this album and covered so much ground while still maintaining a cohesive album.\n\n12. Cave Clove – The Muscle and The Meaning\n\nCave Clove was a good discovery I saw as an opening act a few years back. I have followed them closely ever since, and I’m always eager to hear what they’ve got next. A little bit Soulful modern rock tinged with psych-rock riffs, I really think this is their most complete and cohesive record yet.\n\n11. Florence + the Machine – Dance Fever\n\nThe one and only Florence Welch back again. That soaring, powerful voice, and those big orchestrations swirling around. It’s exactly what you might expect from Florence + the Machine by now, but still no less welcome. Always look forward to a new Florence record.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSault – Run\n\nPoppy Ajudha – No!\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – All That You Want\n\nSantigold – Witness\n\nSudan Archives – Ciara\n\nIbeyi, Pa Salieu – Made of Gold\n\nFlorence + the Machine – Heaven is Here\n\nThe Smile – The Smoke\n\nLos Bitchos – Las Panteras\n\nBuilt to Spill – Gonna Lose\n\nCave Clove – New Secret\n\nOpen Mike Eagle – 79th and Stony Island\n\nSault – Valley of the Ocean\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews – You Do What You Want\n\nTaj Mahal & Ry Cooder – What a Beautiful City\n\nSudan Archives – #513\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – 17 18 19\n\nIbeyi, BERWYN – Rise Above\n\nPoppy Ajudha – PLAYGOD\n\nSantigold – Fall First\n\nLos Bitchos – Tropico\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews – Let Her Go\n\nFlorence + the Machine – King\n\nCave Clove – On Witches Brew\n\nBuilt to Spill – Never Alright\n\nSault – Stronger\n\nOpen Mike Eagle – I’ll Fight You\n\nThe Smile – You Will Never Work In Television Again\n\nSault – The Jungle\n\nTaj Mahal & Ry Cooder – I Shall Not Be Moved\n\nLook, this is just an excuse for me to make another 2 hr playlist of music I love in the hopes that other people will give it a listen and find something they also love. So here we go…\n\n10. Sitka Sun – All The Way West (January 12)\n\nMy music listening has grown a lot in the last few years into new territory. I don’t think that when I started doing these playlists, I wouldn’t have gravitated to an instrumental jazz record like I did this year with All The Way West, and I have to give some of the credit to KEXP’s Afternoon Show DJ, Larry Mizell Jr. In the past I’d say that I always wanted to get jazz, and Larry has woven it into his show in a way that has drawn me in more than ever before. Sitka Sun’s album, in particular, was a revelation for me. I also feel like the album art is worth mentioning. That glowing, sun-drenched photo seems to fit the music so well that hearing the music brings it to mind. This was, for me, an accessible jazz record that helped me into that whole realm I’ve wanted into for a long time.\n\n9. Big Red Machine – How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last? (August 27)\n\nThis was one of those records where the pop and indie spheres melded together to give us a window into a pop record constructed with genuine artistry, not the mighty dollar, as the priority. Beautiful songwriting, excellent guest appearances, flowing smoothly from one track to another, and, again, I’ll say it feels distinctly like a pop record.\n\n8. Adia Victoria – A Southern Gothic (September 17)\n\nThis album really came out of nowhere for me, and there was a stretch where it was all I could listen to. I have a deep love for the blues, and Adia Victoria gave us a masterclass blues album this year. Beyond that though, she was unafraid to step outside of traditional blues structure at points here. “Please Come Down” is certainly not what most would consider a blues song. This is Victoria’s 3rd album, and it made me go back and make myself more familiar with her previous work. I just couldn’t get enough of it. As with any good blues album, you really feel it deep down in your soul. You can’t ask for better with the blues.\n\n7. Little Simz – Sometimes I Might Be Introvert (September 3)\n\nSonically huge. Overwhelming, sweeping orchestral movements, and punching vocals. Little Simz has, at this point, mastered the art of blending beats and samples with her live band. The production value on this is better than any album released this year, but she is far from losing the personal touch in her music. This actually feels like her most personal record yet, lyrically. Songs like “I Love You, I Hate You”, “Introvert”, and “Woman” feel as vulnerable as anything she’s ever done. This personal nature of the record goes right down to the details such as the album title being an acronym for her first name, Simbi.\n\n6. FACESOUL – YSRA (July 22)\n\nDo you ever have a go-to album for when you need something meditative? That was YSRA for me this year. At this point, it seems necessary to once again shout out a KEXP DJ. This time it is Early Show host Gabriel Teodros. I never would have heard this album if not for Gabriel, and so I was introduced to it while on my way to work first thing in the morning. Nothing gets your day off to a good start like the right music, and this album in particular had some real gems to get you feeling centered and ready for a day at work. I also found it was good music to end your day.\n\n5. Valerie June – The Moon and Stars: Prescriptions for Dreamers (March 12)\n\nValerie June’s was my first favorite early this year from the point that the first singles were released months before the album. My relationship with this record has been building all year long, and I’ve cycled through different favorite songs at different points. I was happy to see this one stay high on my list as the year progressed. Valerie June has mastered different vocal styles, and she blends them together so well. With this record, she built a much bigger sound around those vocals than she has in the past. Often she has tended towards more sparse, bluegrass styles, and the bigger, soul pop sound really complimented this material. It all came together so well on this record. I was certain earlier this year that this would just stay top of the list all year long, and I sort of think that, depending on the day, any of these top 5 could be my number 1.\n\n4. Tony Allen – There is No End (April 30)\n\nPosthumously released after Tony’s passing in April 2020, There Is No End felt like such a fitting tribute to what he contributed to music. The influential Nigerian drummer was the musical director of Fela Kuti’s band from 1968 to 1979, and Kuti himself said that without Allen there would be no Afrobeat. His influence on afrobeat has had a spiraling outward effect on funk, soul and hip-hop, and this record is full of artists whose art would not be the same without him. The title, There Is No End, is such a fitting reminder of the connectedness of all of us. The story doesn’t begin or end with the beginning or ending of one life. Each is influenced by someone before, and each lives on in the influence they had on others. This is the real crux of this record, and it all came together so beautifully with this amazing collection of songs.\n\n3. David Huckfelt – Room Enough, Time Enough (March 19)\n\nThe second full-length album from Huckfelt outside of his work with The Pines had a focus on re-centering attention onto marginalized and forgotten people. The album features several Native American artists from different parts of the American Southwest, as well as a host of other collaborators. There is an activist narrative just beneath the surface on these songs. It tells a story throughout it, and this is perhaps even more impressive to achieve this level of cohesion with the number of collaborators involved. The voices of Keith Secola, Billy Sedlmayr, Jackie Bird and others are given the attention they deserve, and there’s an overarching theme of perseverance and preservation. It’s a record that cuts right through you. The deep roots of protest folk music show their strength here.\n\n2. Ya Tseen – Indian Yard (April 30)\n\nI was so taken up by this album. I’d never heard anything like this before. Nicholas Galanin and his collaborators built this incredible sonic landscape of psych-pop and electronica. In addition to his music, Galanin is a prolific visual artist whose pointed political art has made headlines around the world. It’s the first record released as Ya Tseen, a name based on his own Tlingit name, but the Sitka, Alaska-based musician has recorded under Silver Jackson and Indian Agent as well. At the core of the record is the human need for connection, and, amid our ongoing struggles with COVID-19 and swirling political madness, what could be more timely?\n\n1. Torres – Thirstier (July 30)\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack in this album, which swings around through genres dabbling in electronica, punk rock, big rock ballads, and straightforward synth pop-rock and closing in a crashing, dissonant rock song that nearly veers off a cliff-edge. MacKenzie Scott explores a lot of relational concepts in this record. I could have mentioned the pandemic in writing about each of my favorite albums this year. It’s become so pervasive, and feels, in most cases, like it doesn’t need to be said. All of these albums have been written in this environment, and we connect with them in this context. As I’ve reached number one, I’ll bring in what Scott said in an NPR interview.\n\n“I felt exactly the way that everybody else did, which was confused and worried and anxious about the future,” she recounts. “And so I started writing this album as a kind of way to dig myself out of the tunnel vision that can be created by doom scrolling.” She fixated on matters more immediate and life-giving, and wanted to aim her creative energies, as [album producer, Rob] Ellis puts it, “up and out, rather than inward and down.” “I did that for myself first,” she says, “and then I guess I decided that if I could do that for myself, then maybe I could try and help other people to feel that way, too.”\n\nIf you have an album or artist that felt significant to you this year, then please do not let it stop at Spotify or YouTube. Support them if you can. Buy their album, go to a show, share with a friend. Thanks.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSitka Sun – Presence\n\nFACESOUL – Medicine\n\nValerie June – Stay\n\nYa Tseen, Portugal The Man – Knives\n\nTony Allen, Sampa The Great – Stumbling Down\n\nLittle Simz – I Love You, I Hate You\n\nAdia Victoria – Magnolia Blues\n\nDavid Huckfelt, David Simonett – Bury Me Not (The Dying Cowboy)\n\nBig Red Machine, Taylor Swift – Renegade\n\nTORRES – Don’t Go Puttin Wishes In My Head\n\nYa Tseen – Close The Distance\n\nBig Red Machine, Fleet Foxes, Anais Mitchell – Phoenix\n\nValerie June – Why The Bright Stars Glow\n\nTORRES – Thirstier\n\nLittle Simz – Introvert\n\nTony Allen, Marlowe – My Own\n\nAdia Victoria, Kyshona Armstrong, Margo Price, Jason Isbell – You Was Born to Die\n\nDavid Huckfelt, Greg Brown – Satisfied Mind\n\nSitka Sun – Dauntless\n\nFACESOUL – Grow–A COLORS ENCORE\n\nValerie June – You and I\n\nSitka Sun – Long Shadow\n\nBig Red Machine, Sharon Van Etten, Lisa Hannigan, Shara Nova – Hutch\n\nYa Tseen, Tunia – Born Into Rain\n\nLittle Simz – Rollin Stone\n\nTony Allen, Ben Okri, Skepta – Cosmosis\n\nFACESOUL – All I Need\n\nDavid Huckfelt – Land of Room Enough Time Enough\n\nAdia Victoria – Troubled Mind\n\nTORRES – Are You Sleepwalking?\n\nTony Allen – There’s No End\n\nI’ll start with my usual disclaimer that this is not a list of the best albums of the year. I make absolutely no claim to objectivity here. These are my personal favorites. It’s the music released this year that I connected with, and were significant for me. I had a list of about 60 albums I’d enjoyed over the course of the year, and it was hard to whittle it down to these. Hopefully, others have connected with them as well. Enjoy!\n\n25. Low – HEY WHAT (September 10)\n\nIt takes a lot for a band 13 records and 17 years in to maintain a sonically adventurous approach, but Low manage to do that. “White Horses” start the album off with bold hooks, and moves directly into “I Can’t Wait” which is a bit more direct of a song than I’m accustomed to from them. The album flows beautifully from there, and I’m truly impressed by what they’ve created here with their close, intimate sound swelling to huge, distorted electro-orchestral instrumentals.\n\n24. Jose Gonzalez – Local Valley (September 17)\n\nJose Gonzalez’ latest album is a perfect blend of surprises and what fans have come to expect. His signature gentle sound is full of beautiful vocal melodies and engaging guitar hooks. The album is linguistically interesting as well. Gonzalez is Swedish with Argentinian parents, and this is the first record in his catalog to have songs in English, Swedish AND Spanish. Much of the record is also tied together with birdsong weaving between the tracks.\n\n23. The Hold Steady – Open Door Policy (February 17)\n\nI’ll always look forward to new material from The Hold Steady. Craig Finn is an excellent storyteller in his lyrics, and they’ve developed a signature driving rock sound that I love. Open Door Policy, while still delivering this signature sound, also carved subtly into new creative grounds. Lyrically, Finn builds evermore on his collection of broken – and very human – characters.\n\n22. Solemn Brigham – South Sinner Street (September 24)\n\nThis album didn’t get the attention it deserved, and it wasn’t even reviewed by many music sites. I’ve loved Solemn’s work together with L’Orange as Marlowe. This project gave a much more personal look at Solemn Brigham. It was very different, and I really enjoyed it. It seems that not every Marlowe fan felt the same way, and missed L’Orange-level production. I felt it all worked really well, and suited the material.\n\n21. Hiatus Kaiyote – Mood Valiant (June 25)\n\nThis album is a little out there for some people, but I love it. Very bold musically, and has me convinced. If you’re willing to follow, then it’s rewarding. If not, then maybe it gets written off as too weird. It takes some very sharp musicians to pull off a project like this one. Irregular time signatures, complex arrangements, a little birdsong here and there… It’s a lot to take in, and it keeps giving with the repeated listen.\n\n20. The War On Drugs – I Don’t Live Here Anymore (October 29)\n\nThe War On Drugs just makes consistently beautiful music. Their warm, hook-laden, long-form jams have become a signature sound with influences rooted in The Grateful Dead and Dire Straits. Adam Granduciel’s vocal stylings I certainly find to be strongly influenced by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. In this record, the War On Drugs lean hard into an ‘80s pop sound, and they absolutely strike a good balance with it.\n\n19. DARKSIDE – Spiral (July 23)\n\nThis album really takes you on a journey. Start-to-finish it’s an engaging, mysterious record, and you never really know for sure which direction it will turn with each song. Incorporating numerous styles and varied instrumentation, I feel like I find something new with every listen. Albums like this one made me feel guilty for placing them only in 19th spot, but that’s me painstakingly planning out this list too.\n\n18. Cimafunk – El Alimento (October 8)\n\nOh hello… hot funk for dark times! This one was endless fun to listen to. The blend of Afro-Cuban styles with classic American Funk, and even featuring the man himself, George Clinton, in the opening track. You don’t get better funk credentials than George Clinton. It’s a solid, high energy dance record that just makes you feel happy, and makes you want to move. As far as guests, I particularly enjoyed CeeLo Green’s appearance as well.\n\n17. Prince – Welcome 2 America (July 30)\n\nWe are blessed with this incredible Prince record this year. The album was recorded in 2010, but was shelved for who knows why. I assume because he felt it wasn’t the record for that time and place. Thank goodness the people in charge of sifting through his vault found it and knew it was a record for this time and place. Numerous tracks on this record felt like they were written during the summer of 2020, and released into our still simmering culture a year later. “Welcome 2 America” and “Running Game (Son of a Slave Master)”, in particular, felt like they were directed at all of the issues we’ve been facing in the last couple years in the US. If you could release something to somehow add to Prince’s mystique in 2021, then this was the record to do it.\n\n16. L’Orange, Namir Blade – Imaginary Everything (July 2)\n\nI’ve been a huge fan of L’Orange’s production over the past few years, and he’s featured in my favorite albums for 4 years running. This time partnering with Namir Blade, there’s a distinct homage to old school hip-hop woven into this record. There are some excellent, funky grooves through this and coming out especially in standout tracks like “Corner Store Scandal”, “Point to Point” and “Shotgun”. I also really love Namir’s flow on this record, and I was unfamiliar with his work before this.\n\n15. Hiss Golden Messenger – Quietly Blowing It (June 25)\n\nI first became aware of Hiss Golden Messenger with 2016’s Heart Like A Levee album, and I am so thankful for each record since. MC Taylor and company have a beautiful, warm, gospel-tinged blend of folk, rock and blues. They cover a lot of ground stylistically. At times delving into bluegrass picking, and at times hitting on a classic soul groove. The songs can be gentle and soft, and they can be full of hooks and grooves. It’s all tied together with cut-to-the-heart, honest songwriting. As an extra this year, we were given really great holiday record from them as well, O Come All Ye Faithful.\n\n14. Arlo Parks – Collapsed Into Sunbeams (January 25)\n\nArlo Parks offered us a very intimate and poetic album this year, and I actually had to go back and double check that this came out this year. It was early enough that some of the singles had been out in 2020. She’s a wonderful storyteller throughout this album, and with wonderful throwback R&B stylings hitting hard. “Hope” and “Hurt are both standout songs here, but there’s really not a weak track on the album at all.\n\n13. Tune-Yards – sketchy. (March 26)\n\nSonically adventurous with wild style shifts somehow melded into a cohesive and hard-hitting indie pop record. “Hold Yourself” was a big song for me early in the year, and I connected with song after song on this record each time thinking a new one was the high point. It’s hard to argue with anything over the massive closer “Be Not Afraid”. This is my favorite record yet from Tune-Yards, and I really think this is an album and a band people will look back on as being among the defining sounds of our current musical era.\n\n12. Brandi Carlile – In These Silent Days (October 1)\n\nBrandi is finally getting some much-deserved media attention with her current record building on what I still maintain was the best record of 2018, By The Way, I Forgive You. For me personally, I don’t know if there’s any topping that 2018 album as it is among my favorites of all-time. In These Silent Days is excellent though. Brandi continues to build her excellent, break-your-heart-and-also-inspire-you, songwriting here, and it is so good to see her becoming a prominent figure in country and pop music. She’s an artist that I hold very dear.\n\n11. Cleo Sol – Mother (August 19)\n\nIf you had Cleo Sol as your favorite record this year, then I would not fault you in any way. What an incredible album this is! It’s intimate and tender in ways that I’ve never known another album to be. Mother was recorded in large part with her new child in her arms. That alone seems incredibly difficult, but to come out with an end-product like this seems super-human. It’s an album that you can simply hear the love in every phrase both musical and lyrical. It’s a masterpiece, and I feel downright guilty that it’s not in my top 10 (as if my numbered list really made a difference). I suppose I could have made this post 25-12, and next week done a top 11.\n\nTracklist:\n\nCleo Sol – Know That You Are Loved\n\nTune-Yards – hold yourself.\n\nPrince – Check The Record\n\nCimafunk – Esto Es Cuba\n\nSolemn Brigham, Marlowe – The Lore\n\nL’Orange, Namir Blade, Marlowe, Solemn Brigham – Pipe Dreams\n\nHiatus Kaiyote – And We Go Gentle\n\nArlo Parks – Hope\n\nJose Gonzalez – El Invento\n\nHiss Golden Messenger – The Great Mystifier\n\nBrandi Carlile, Lucius – You and Me On The Rock\n\nThe War On Drugs – Change\n\nThe Hold Steady – Family Farm\n\nDARKSIDE – I’m The Echo\n\nLow – Days Like These\n\nSolemn Brigham – Keep The Hope\n\nPrince – Running Game (Son of a Slave Master)\n\nThe Hold Steady – Me & Magdalena\n\nBrandi Carlile – Sinners, Saints and Fools\n\nThe War On Drugs, Lucius – I Don’t Live Here Anymore\n\nArlo Parks – Hurt\n\nCleo Sol – Don’t Let Me Fall\n\nHiatus Kaiyote, Arthur Verocai – Get Sun\n\nCimafunk, George Clinton – Funk Aspirin\n\nL’Orange, Namir Blade – Corner Store Scandal\n\nDARKSIDE – The Limit\n\nJose Gonzalez – Head On\n\nHiss Golden Messenger – Sanctuary\n\nLow – Disappearing\n\nTune-Yards – be not afraid.\n\nSo here’s this playlist of my featuring my favorite albums of the year. You could stream it 24/7 for a month, and each of the artists might get a cheeseburger out of it. Seriously though, if you find an artist that you love, then support them! Buy the record! Go to a show when those become a thing again! I hope you enjoy this music, and thanks for reading things I wrote and listening to music I compiled this year. I hope you found artists and albums that you connected with here. One of the things I love doing is fitting in a lot of different styles, and still making the playlist flow from song to song. It’s a challenge for me, and I think it keeps it interesting and enjoyable to listen. In terms of challenge, these 10 records were definitely that. I did my best to make them fit together, and I think that it represents the Fortnightly Playlist pretty well. You’ll notice I don’t really have much negative to say here. These 10 albums may not be for everyone, but for their styles and what I found in them… I think they’re near perfect records.\n\n10. Courtney Marie Andrews – Old Flowers\n\nBeautiful country/folk ballads with a voice that reaches straight to your heart. Old Flowers is an album that came from a long relationship ending, and the heartache, confusion, persistent love, and hindsight perspective all come through loud and clear. Andrew’s voice is gorgeous, but made more powerful by the material that she’s felt deeply. When she sings, you feel it. The warm instrumentation is a masterclass, and the arrangements are flawless.\n\n9. Marlowe – Marlowe 2\n\nIt’s 3 years in a row now that a L’Orange project has found itself in my top 10. 2018’s Marlowe landed at #3, last year’s Complicate Yourself With Violence was #4, and this year there was considerable excitement to see he was going to be rejoined by Solemn Brigham to make a 2nd Marlowe record. L’Orange uses far different source material from many other DJs. Older, dustier jazz and blues are employed, and there is a narrative of sorts created by samples from old radio theatre. Solemn Brigham is a raw, unpolished rapper, and I love how this fits together with L’Orange’s production. There’s a genuine feeling to it. It’s as if he’s hearing the beat being created, he’s writing his rhymes and then rapping himself breathless… there’s this urgency you get from Solemn. Some reviews I’ve seen note this lack of polish as a negative, but I find it to be irresistibly genuine.\n\n8. Loma – Don’t Shy Away\n\nJonathan Meiburg has been a feature of this blog since it began. Back in 2016, I was very much taken by Shearwater’s album, Jetplane & Oxbow, and it’s been a record that has stuck with me since. When Loma began as a collaboration of Jonathan Meiburg, Emily Cross and Dan Duszynski, I was immediately drawn in by particular tracks on their self-titled first album in 2018. This year, when I heard “Half Silences” on the radio while driving, I knew it had to be them. This album has built well on their foundation, and I found myself listening to favorite song after favorite song… the entire album is just that good. They have a gift for making things simple and intimate, while also feeling grand and atmospheric. The vocal melodies are full of hooks that keep you engaged. Start-to-finish, a beautiful album.\n\n7. Songhoy Blues – Optimisme\n\nThe story of Songhoy Blues is something I find incredible. When displaced from their homes in Northern Mali by a jihadist group, and driven south to Mali’s capital, Bamako, this group of refugees formed the group to create music they felt captured the spirit of their homeland. Optimisme is now the 3rd album from the group, and it finds them broadening their sound into hard rock territory while retaining the Malian rhythms and the vocal stylings that hold their music firmly in their desert blues roots. If you haven’t yet seen this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMPEK1YHM4w) of them performing on the banks of the river in Bamako this year for a radio broadcast for KEXP in Seattle, then stop right now and watch it. They perform even for no live audience with an incredible passion and intensity. This group is on my must-see list when live music returns. As a guitarist, their riffs are irresistable. At this point, I’d also like to mention how much I like the cover art on all 10 of these albums.\n\n6. Joshua Burnside – Into the Depths of Hell\n\nThis record is something of a stylistic chameleon. Close, intimate chamber-folk at much of its core, but building to big, orchestral blasts of electronic crescendos and woven throughout with atmospheric, found-sound sampling. The Northern Irish singer-songwriter, touches on numerous lyrical themes in the record, and a number of them are dark musings. Apocalyptic visions, suicide, dysfunction and tragedy all rear their head through the record, but all appearing amid beautiful composition. This is a record that you can listen to start-to-finish on repeat and keep getting more and more from it. The variance in orchestration is a journey in itself. Guitar, banjo, piano, horns, cello weaving together creating entirely different feelings from song to song and moment to moment.\n\n5. Joensuu 1685 – ÖB\n\nShimmering, sparkling synth landscapes, ringing guitars, crashing cymbals, and reverb-drenched vocals create a grand sound in this album. The record is actually built from the bones of an album the band had been making back in the late ’00s. A hiatus found frontman, Mikko Joensuu, releasing an incredible solo trilogy (Amen I, II, and III), and while Markus (Mikko’s brother) and Risto (also named Joensuu, but unrelated) played in the post-rock band, Sinai. So these songs cover a long time period. Some date back to ’09, and some as recent as ’19. That said, it impressively still comes together as a cohesive whole in spite of all ground covered in the bandmembers personal lives and in their relationships with one another.\n\n4. Gabriel Teodros – What You Leave Behind\n\nIt’s been quite a year for Gabriel Teodros. He took on a weekday DJ show (www.kexp.org, 5-7 AM PST) and has been a big part of my continuing musical journey this year, his home burnt down this year as he and his partner lost nearly all their possessions, and then there is this incredible album. Each morning since this summer I have begun my day with Gabriel’s words and playlist (usually coming in somewhere in the middle of his radio show), and it seems now that it would be inevitable that I’d begin to connect with the perspectives that he shares on this record. “Every Scar” was a standout for me as I listened to it more. It wasnt’ the first song that I found myself obsessed with, but it was one of many that stuck with me once it hit me. “I fell out of love before I knew what it meant, and I lived on the bus when I couldn’t pay rent” are striking opening lines, and it’s just one example of numerous moments on this record that I found myself thinking on at length. Sonically, Gabriel has a dusty, lo-fi approach rooted in classic soul & gospel music, and leans on laid back beats. He has a calm yet gripping voice. Soulful guest vocals feature on several tracks, and most notably for me is Jennifer Johns performance on “Hold Ya Head”.\n\n3. IDLES – Ultra Mono\n\nA pure, punk rage with a message of unity and love. IDLES 3rd record continues in their now established tradition, but with more focus than ever on making the record sound perfect. I saw an interview of guitarist, Mark Bowen, noting that there were particular sonic markers that they were not hitting on 2018’s Joy is an Act of Resistance that they were determined to hit on this record. In particular, it was in the drum sound. If you haven’t heard this record, then you may not know that the drums… sound… massive. Apparently, the kit was set up in a brick-walled room that for the recording, and I don’t know if I’ve ever heard drum sounds that hit so hard as they do on this album. They are absolutely killer. Add to it that the songs in this body of work had a steady, brutal punchiness to leave you feeling battered. You won’t find a better punk rock album than this in 2020, or if you do then I want to hear it.\n\n2. Deep Sea Diver – Impossible Weight\n\n“But that was then and this is now, I tried so hard not to let you all down, It’s an impossible weight.” The chorus of the title track, appropriately, acts as a centerpiece for the record. Feeling the pressure of expectations, not so muchon the superficial level of needing to please fans with an album (although, maybe that is there a bit), but much more on the interpersonal level of meeting what your closest relationships expect of a person. How one should be. This song and this album resonated loud and long in our current political climate at a point when many of us feel our lives feel imbued with division a turmoil. Jessica Dobson wrote many of the song from dark a dark place personally, and after/during a stretch when she found it difficult to find any joy in making music. There are a variety of sources for her subject matter, and to build a cohesive album from this is truly impressive.\n\n1. Moses Sumney – Grae\n\nInitially, the album was released in two parts, and with the second the physical double album was made available. By a twist, this album focused on struggles with feelings of isolation suddenly became an album very well suited for this year in particular. The first part being released in February and the second in May, many of us were realizing how “islanded” we were, and perhaps how we had been more islanded before than we had known. I primarily listened to this record in vinyl form, and it shaped how I listened to it. I began to think of the double-album in terms of four movements with each side of each disc. When I listened to it, I found I often listened to the final side two or three times. This is why I’ve chosen to close my playlist with all three tracks from this fourth side. It is essentially a longform version of “Bless Me” with the preceding track a conversational spoken word piece hitting home the album’s theme, and the final track, “before you go” acting as a coda to “Bless Me”.\n\ntracklist:\n\nJoensuu 1685 – Hey My Friend (We’re Here Again)\n\nMoses Sumney – Virile\n\nLoma – Breaking Waves Like a Stone\n\nDeep Sea Diver – Impossible Weight\n\nIDLES – Grounds\n\nSonghoy Blues – Badala\n\nMarlowe – Future Power Sources\n\nGabriel Teodros – What You Leave Behind\n\nJoshua Burnside – And You Evade Him/Born in the Blood\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews – If I Told\n\nDeep Sea Diver – Shattering the Hourglass\n\nLoma – Given a Sign\n\nGabriel Teodros – If They Come For Me In The Morning…\n\nMoses Sumney – Colouour\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews – Ships in the Night\n\nJoensuu 1685 – Light in the Heart of Our Town\n\nSonghoy Blues – Barre\n\nMarlowe – Small Business\n\nIDLES – Kill Them with Kindness\n\nJoshua Burnside – Noa Mercier\n\nJoensuu 1685 – I’m In Paradise\n\nLoma – Half Silences\n\nJoshua Burnside – Driving Alone in the City at Night\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews – Together or Alone\n\nGabriel Teodros – Every Scar\n\nMarlowe – Preach Honest\n\nSonghoy Blues – Dournia\n\nDeep Sea Diver – Eyes Are Red (Don’t Be Afraid)\n\nIDLES – A Hymn\n\nMoses Sumney – and so I come to isolation\n\nMoses Sumney – Bless Me\n\nMoses Sumney – before you go\n\nAs I do each year, I’ll begin with a disclaimer about my year-end list. I don’t think it is possible to engage with music (or any art) in a purely objective way. This isn’t a “best albums of the year” list. It is my favorites. It’s what I engaged with most, and became works that meant something to me. We approach art with all of our own baggage, who we are, what we are going through. Your list, undoubtedly, is different from mine, but maybe something here also resonated with you. I’d love to know what your favorites were this year whether similar to mine or different. Next week I’ll be adding part 2 which will be my top 10. Enjoy!\n\nTrying out Deezer! Here is a link to the playlist there! https://deezer.page.link/xNfPJnNhRHkLRdDWA\n\n25. Busta Rhymes – Extinction Level Event 2\n\nDamn if we didn’t need an album like this in 2020! Busta is a Hip-Hop legend at this point, and 2020 felt like it needed is fast-paced, aggressive, powerful voice (not to mention it felt like we were in an extinction level event). It’s hard to talk about this album without putting the focus on “Look Over Your Shoulder”. As Busta put it in an interview on The Daily Show, “it became clear we were sittin’ on a different type of gem”. Both Busta and Kendrick put in a monster verse, and the samples of young Michael Jackson chopped up and tying the whole thing together is a stroke of genius.\n\n24. Blimes and Gab – Talk About It\n\nWhere I live this album was a big deal. Being from the Seattle area, and Gifted Gab being a local artist had something to do with it perhaps. Gab has collaborated with San Fransisco’s Blimes Brixton on a couple singles over the past few years, but this is the first full-length project from the pair. For me personally, “Sacred” and the title track are the standouts here.\n\n23. Smokey Brights – I Love You But Damn\n\nAnother local release here! I’ve had the pleasure of seeing Smokey Brights perform a couple times in the last few years, and they are a joy. This was one of the more lighthearted releases I engaged with this year, but still with the Smokey’s genuine touch.\n\n22. Run The Jewels – RTJ4\n\nAs with the Busta Rhymes album, there are certain artists and albums that land in the right time and place. This was a year for Run the Jewels, and you could tell they knew it. El-P and Killer Mike came striding into 2020 knowing full well they’re album was going to be a touchstone. This one will be on a lot of top album lists this year, no doubt.\n\n21. SAULT – Untitled (Black is…)\n\nSAULT had 2 albums last year, and 2 again this year. They came out of seemingly nowhere, and there is still a lot of uncertainty about who is behind the project. What is known is that each album has been timely and profound. Black is… was their first release for the year, and as an additional treat there is a nice appearance from Michael Kiwanuka as well.\n\n20. Andy Shauf – Neon Skyline\n\nAndy Shauf is an artist that I’ve known since way back. I think the first time I saw Andy live must have been in 2008 or 2009. He played several times at the small bible college both I and his brother attended. I am sort of blown away seeing the artist Andy has become now, and the music he is making. It is oddly rewarding to see an artist whose homemade album you bought back in the day now playing on Jimmy Kimmel and making an album like this.\n\n19. Fantastic Negrito – Have You Lost Your Mind Yet?\n\nXaviar Amin Dphrepaulezz is an artist who has had an incredible journey to this point. His first record deal was signed back in 1993, but a near fatal car crash led to the record company terminating the contract. It was a long recovery, and he quit making music entirely. He returned in 2014, and his 2nd and 3rd record after his return each bagged him Grammy’s for Best Contemporary Blues Album. Major standout songs on this record are “Chocolate Samurai” and “How Long?”\n\n18. Childish Gambino – 3.15.20\n\nDonald Glover does what he wants. Rumors had been that the Childish Gambino name would be retired, and since have THE song of 2018 there appeared to be no news of anything different from that. Then as lockdowns began hitting in the US and many other parts of the world, 3.15.20 appeared. The title was simply the date it first appeared on his own website, and most of the track titles were just the run-time they of the album in which they appear. For all the unknowns there was a lot contained in the record, some lush pop music blended in with artsy stylings. Less funk and psychedelic than had previously been included on Childish Gambino works, but still very clearly something uniquely Childish Gambino.\n\n17. Throwing Muses – Sun Racket\n\nSomehow both atmospheric and intense, the latest offering from Throwing Muses felt like the brooding, dark, alt-rock album that I needed as we entered an Autumn that was about to last 10 years. The opening track, “Dark Blue”, was certainly a highlight, and one of my favorite songs of the year. This is their most concise work in a while, and it may be among their best.\n\n16. Sufjan Stevens – The Ascension\n\nAt this point, any announcement of new music from Sufjan would cause significant buzz, but with a massive lead single over 12 minutes called “America” it seemed to garner some attention. In terms of the sound, the album has a fair amount of similarity to Age of Adz, but with intimate moments throughout.This is something Sufjan has mastered. He can have this huge, complex and dense sound, but with these moments where it doesn’t feel so intimidating.\n\n15. Pearl Jam – Gigaton\n\nForever and always my favorite band. As many will say of their favorite band, a new record is difficult to form an opinion of immediately. This record has some highlight tracks that fit so well in the Pearl Jam catalogue. Soaring, anthemic choruses that are tailor-made to have a stadium singing along, and a message laced with a dose of righteous punk rage.\n\n14. SAULT – Untitled (Rise…)\n\nYep, the second SAULT record ranked a bit higher for me. Rise turned a little more hopeful, and built more on their broad sound incorporating rock, soul and roots. I connected more with this collection of songs than any of their material to-date.\n\n13. Drive-By Truckers – The Unravelling\n\nI always look forward to a new Drive-By Truckers album, and this was no exception. Cooley and Hood trading vocals, and the band sounding tight. It seems each record is a highwater mark all it’s own. While American Band was, for me, their best work, but this is a fitting follow up. They quickly got another release out this year with The New OK, which featured some new songs as well as additional songs from the sessions for this album.\n\n12. This is the Kit – Off Off On\n\nThis album was so close to being in my top 10, and it really is a beautiful album. Kate Stables’ writing is better than even on this one, and sonically I found it reminded me of Sufjan Steven’s state albums. The varied instrumentation with horns, sax and banjo may play a role in that.\n\n11. Mark Lanegan – Straight Songs of Sorrow\n\nLanegan has a gift for making dark songs sound so good. I read his memoir this summer, and I found out why. What a dark and difficult book that was. It certainly gave insight into the entrapment of addiction, and you can see why the phrase “survivor’s guilt” comes up in his interviews sometimes. Straight Songs of Sorrow continues his lengthening run of releasing a new album every year, and what’s more significant is that he continue to push boundaries with his music.\n\ntracklist:\n\nPearl Jam – Who Ever Said\n\nDrive-By Truckers – Grievance Merchants\n\nFantastic Negrito – Chocolate Samurai\n\nSAULT, Michael Kiwanuka – Bow\n\nChildish Gambino – 35.31\n\nBlimes and Gab – Talk About It\n\nSmokey Brights – I Won’t Lie 4 You\n\nSAULT – Fearless\n\nBusta Rhymes, Kendrick Lamar – Look Over Your Shoulder\n\nSufjan Stevens – Run Away With Me\n\nThis is the Kit – Was Magician\n\nAndy Shauf – Thirteen Hours\n\nMark Lanegan – Daylight in the Nocturnal House\n\nThrowing Muses – St Charles\n\nRun the Jewels, Josh Homme, Mavis Staples – pulling the pin\n\nBusta Rhymes – Don’t Go\n\nFantastic Negrito – How Long?\n\nBlimes and Gab – Sacred\n\nSAULT – Wildfires\n\nSAULT – Free\n\nThis is the Kit – Slider\n\nDrive-By Truckers – Rosemary with a Bible and a Gun\n\nMark Lanegan – I Wouldn’t Want to Say\n\nPearl Jam – Seven O’Clock\n\nThrowing Muses – Dark Blue\n\nChildish Gambino, Ariana Grande – Time\n\nRun The Jewels, Zack de la Rocha, Pharrell Williams – JU$T\n\nSufjan Stevens – America\n\nAndy Shauf – Changer\n\nSmokey Brights – Shelter Me\n\nMy 2019 top 10. Let’s dive in! Here’s yer playlist:\n\n10. The New Pornographers – In the Morse Code of the Brake Lights\n\nCarl Newman said that when this album started coming together he questioned himself saying, “Are there too many songs using car metaphors?”, and then decided “Maybe people will think it’s a concept album.” Well, concept album or not, this album grabbed and held my attention more than the last few records from the group. Something you’ll note in this top 10 (and really in the top few from last week’s list as well) is that I really feel there are no weak tracks on this record. This album grabbed my attention with the first couple singles, but held it because of the strength throughout. One thing that The New Pornographers have always been sneaky good at is knowing how to open and close an album. The first track and the last track are always the perfect way to open and close the album, respectively. Things like that go a long way to making a great record. It also helps that they really hit the sweet spot, and gave us a murderer’s row of great songs on this one.\n\n9. The Highwomen – The Highwomen\n\nIn terms of supergroups, this is about as good as it gets. Each artist is a rising star in her own rite, and the entire album is just bursting with the talent of Brandi Carlile, Natalie Hemby, Amanda Shires and Maren Morris. The first thing that hits you with this record is the vocals. The interplay and the harmonies of four stellar vocalists is absolutely beautiful, and it’s something special and rare in modern music. Beyond the vocals though, is a richly layered sound of guitars, piano, organ, violin. It’s a warm and soulful sound sound, and the songs are filled with positive messaging. Initially, I was most struck by “Highwomen” and “Crowded Table”, but the entire record is so good and more recently I’ve really been loving “Old Soul” and “Wheels of Laredo”. Also this year, the group contributed to the soundtrack for the movie “The Kitchen” with an incredible cover of Flletwood Mac’s “The Chain”.\n\n8. Mark Lanegan – Somebody’s Knocking\n\nMark Lanegan gave us a modern rock masterpiece this year. It’s dark and brooding, but it is not without hope and beauty. Lanegan has never been one to stick with a formula though. While there is plenty of his low rasp over fuzzed-out guitars, there is also much more electronic elements in this record. There are some bold connecting lines to New Order and Joy Division on this record. “Penthouse High” could easily be considered Lanegan’s love-letter to New Order. If you were to hear that song without his recognizable vocal, then you could mistake it for a New Order b-side you hadn’t heard. This could come off as cheap mimicry if not for the context of the album. Somebody’s Knocking easily shifts gears from 80’s to 90’s to 00’s to 10’s, and all in this context of Mark Lanegan’s unique touch and perspective.\n\n7. Shredders – Great Hits\n\nIs this an album or an EP? I’ve heard EPs longer than this, but this is so sharp that it had to make the list. Doomtree these days is mainly operating in 2 main entities in my mind. There are still other side projects from Sims, Paper Tiger and Lazerbeak, but the two main operators right now are Shredders and Dessa. Where the full crew Doomtree albums are huge, Shredders is a leaner project. P.O.S. and Sims have been the two most prolific rappers in Doomtree, and so 2017’s debut, Dangerous Jumps, saw them trading bars in over some of Lazerbeak and Paper Tiger’s sharpest, fastest beats. I loved that record, and it narrowly missed my top 10 that year. What Great Hits does that Dangerous Jumps didn’t is that it sharpens the focus of the subject matter. There’s a cohesive message that comes through, especially on “Suburban Base”, “Vanilla ISIS” and “Ayeyayaya”. P.O.S is one of my favorite rappers, but I think this record is Sims at his finest. Their contrasting styles both hit top of their game. Sims is sharp and fast, P.O.S is aggressive and hard-hitting. If you get a chance to see these guys live, then take it. They are fast-paced and engaged like few others are, and they are super chill to hang out with after. If this was longer than 7-songs and a 20 minute run-time, then it could have landed above 7.\n\n6. Making Movies – Ameri’kana\n\nThis album made a late run for me, and certainly earned a spot in my top 10 favorites. Making Movies offers a spirited blend of Rock, Cumbia, Psychedelia, Son Cubano, and Americana that also makes sure its message is heard. The Kansas City quartet earned some Latin Grammy nods this year, and I would expect that it’s not for the last time. The guest appearances on this album from Flor de Toloache, Ruben Blades, Frankie Negron, and others are fantastic. What Making Movies offers is a confluence of many different styles from across Latin America as well as styles pioneered in the US, and they do it beautifully. This album is a must-listen.\n\n5. L’Orange, Jeremiah Jae – Complicate Your Life With Violence\n\nL’Orange’s collaboration with Solemn Brigham, Marlowe, was my #3 last year, and now here is L’Orange again. The North Carolina-born producer constructs his album in a cinematic fashion using samples of old radio dramas, jazz and blues records and black-and-white films to piece together a plot and dialogue, and this time he’s paired up with Chicago rapper, Jeremiah Jae. The pair have worked together before on 2015’s The Night Took Us In Like Family, and it’s a pairing that work well. It’s clear that L’Orange thinks of each record in terms of fiml-genre. He’s basically said as much on his twitter as he discusses his albums as “my crime-drama record”, “my Western record” etc. This is a boot-camp war film riddled with scandal and maybe some madness thrown in. Personally, my highlight here is the artfully-done Elmore James samples on “Cool Hand”.\n\n4. Black Pumas – Black Pumas\n\nWow, did this group just come out of thin air this year? Apparently Eric Burton’s soulful vocals came from a combination of church, musical theater and a lot of busking. I think from the first time I heard “Colors” on the radio it was always going to be among my favorite songs of the year, but then listening to this in full I found there wasn’t a single weak link. The entire record, every song, is flat out amazing. It’s a warm, soulful overall sound that immediately gets you moving and singing along. How often do you here a song for the first time and feel like you need to sing along by the end? “Colors” remains among my very favorite songs of this year, but it’s also a good representation of this beautiful album. I love every aspect of this album. The soulful vocals, the bright guitars, the warm organ and rhodes piano, and the tight rhythm section. Can you ask for a better debut?\n\n3. Malibu Ken – Malibu Ken\n\nDon’t rest your eye on that cover too long. Yikes. This is certainly one of the weirder releases of the year, and I’d expect no less from this pair. Aesop Rock’s notoriously nasal wordsmith work combined with Tobacco’s effects-drenched production is a match made in… well, maybe not heaven exactly. There’s a blance they’ve had to strike here. If it were up to Tobacco’s tendancies, then Aes’s voice would become unrecognizably distorted by the layers of effects. Thankfully, the raps aren’t lost in the mix, and Aesop Rock’s lyrics have been running through my head a lot this year. The weird factor will undoubtedly turn some away from this project, but there’s so much to value in Aesop’s acrobatic wordplay and broad vocabulary being paired with Tobacco’s unconventional and distortion-soaked mixes. There’s great hooks in this record too, and thoughts that stick with the listener. There’s been some serious hours spent listening to this one in 2019.\n\n2. Ibibio Sound Machine – Doko Mein\n\nIf you know of an album this year that had more in terms of sheer energy, then I’m open to it. London-based Ibibio Sound Machine took my listening by storm this year. This slab of West-African Funk and Psychedelia mixed with modern alt-rock electro was amazing. Eno Williams powerful vocals and captivating stage presence were among my highlights this year, and seeing this band live in a packed-out High Dive in Seattle was one of my top moments of the year. The band is tight together, but still loose enough to improvise through their set. It’s hard to pinpoint particular pieces of this group to highlight without just listing all the members, and saying what they bring to the group. I’ll try though. Eno Williams energy up front is incredible. She runs the show. The rhythms of Jose (drums), John (bass), and Anselmo (percussion) keeps the groove driving. Those two things are the biggest factors to the group for me. Add that Alfred Bannerman is a phenomenal guitar player, and that the horns-section is absolutely blazing (and they layer in excellent contributions on keys as well), and now I listed everyone anyway. Love this album, and it could have been my favorite of the year if not for an absolute legend giving us a new classic.\n\n1. Mavis Staples – We Get By\n\nIs there a musician I admire more as a person? I don’t think so. Mavis’ career has been a long and winding road that has made her integral in the development of all music today no matter the genre. Having read Greg Kot’s excellent biography of her this year, I could go on for awhile here about different aspects of her career and how she connects to Mahalia Jackson, Bob Dylan, Prince, Arcade Fire, Ry Cooder, Wilco, The Talking Heads, Sam Cooke, and on and on and on… I’ll try and center this about this record in particular. There is a little background necessary to set the stage for this amazing album. When the Staples Singers began, Pops stuck hard to Gospel. It wasn’t until encountering Martin Luther King Jr that things changed to a broader message. They built their most successful run on so-called “message songs”, that were rooted in their Gospel values, but went beyond the walls of the church and connected with people in universal ways (perhaps the way the Gospel was intended anyway, but that’s a different discussion).\n\nAll this needs to be said, as it is fundamental to Mavis’ resurgence in the last decade and a half. Mavis makes music with a message for the world as it is, and this year she connected beautifully. The album is produced and co-written by Ben Harper, who, you could say, is rooted in this Staples Singers school of thought. 2016’s Livin’ On a High Note saw Mavis singing songs written for her by various other artists, and Harper wrote my personal favorite track on that album in “Love and Trust”. The messaging of We Get By lands beautifully in part because Harper is such a keen student of this style. It’s the perfect record for this time and place because Mavis, more than many of her colleagues of Soul music, she remains very present. There’s a humility to Mavis that keeps her firmly with regular people rather than taking on soul-diva/rockstar persona. Songs of love, unity, equality and a bold embrace of change, songs that last, message songs necessary for the world we live in. Mavis Staples.\n\nHere’s yer tracklist:\n\nMaking Movies, Ruben Blades – Delilah\n\nMark Lanegan – Gazing from the Shore\n\nThe New Pornographers – You’ll Need a New Back Seat Driver\n\nMalibu Ken – Tuesday\n\nShredders – Vanilla ISIS\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – Wanna Come Down\n\nL’Orange, Jeremiah Jae – Behavior Report\n\nBlack Pumas – Fire\n\nThe Highwomen – Old Soul\n\nMavis Staples – Heavy On My Mind\n\nThe New Pornographers – You Won’t Need Those Where You’re Going\n\nL’Orange, Jeremiah Jae – My Everything is Bulletproof\n\nShredders – Young Bros\n\nMalibu Ken – Sword Box\n\nMark Lanegan – Penthouse High\n\nThe Highwomen – The Highwomen\n\nBlack Pumas – Stay Gold\n\nMavis Staples, Ben Harper – We Get By\n\nMaking Movies, Ruben Blades – No Te Calles\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – She Work Very Hard\n\nMalibu Ken – Purple Moss\n\nThe New Pornographers – Leather On The Seat\n\nThe Highwomen – Crowded Table\n\nMaking Movies – The Wake of the Fall (Nibiru)\n\nMark Lanegan – Paper Hat\n\nL’Orange, Jeremiah Jae – Cool Hand\n\nShredders – Ayeyayaya\n\nIbibio Sound Machine – Tell Me (Doko Mein)\n\nBlack Pumas – Colors\n\nMavis Staples – One More Change\n\nI said something along these lines last year as well, but I’ll say it again. I’m not objective. Writing a “Best of…” just isn’t possible for me. It’s why every year people get annoyed with the Grammy’s for getting things wrong. Art effects us all on a personal level, and I just find it not in my ability to step outside my own perspective enough to say objectively what is or is not the “Best” albums of the year. These are my favorites. They are the albums that I connected with, and that meant something to me. I hope you enjoy it, and maybe you connected with some of them too.\n\nHere’s yer playlist…\n\n25. Sampa The Great – The Return\n\nSampa the Great offered up this amazing record this year filled with soul grooves and sharp, incisive rhymes. The rich layering of vocals on tracks like “Freedom”, the bold and declaritive rapping on “Dare to Fly” and “Final Form”, and a amazing selection of guests have made this album really stand out. Sampa, born in Zambia, raised in Botswana, and now settled in Australia, brings a unique personal perspective and experience to her music.\n\n24. Calexico, Iron & Wine – Years to Burn\n\nThis collaboration was thought to be done after 2005’s In The Reins, but lo and behold they’ve joined forces once more! It’s such a rich, warm, and soft sound, and Sam Beam’s lead vocals are top notch here. I really enjoy both Calexico and Iron & Wine, and it’s something special to see them work together as this sort of mutual admiration society.\n\n23. Lemolo – Swansea\n\nLemolo really captured my attention back in 2015 with her 2nd release, Red Right Return. It was music like this that made me want to start sharing and eventually writing about music. I got to see her open for M.Ward in 2016, and she is an amazing performer as well. Swansea really builds on the sound she’s established, and it’s hard to find a weak track on it. This is a truly beautiful album.\n\n22. Dessa, Minnesota Orchestra – Sound the Bells\n\nLive albums, compilations and such aren’t usually included in my year-end lists, but this one checked all the boxes that required inclusion. This is such a good performance. There are a few outside choices if she wanted a best-of collection, but it is the song choices and the compositions that make this so worth it. Dessa can do so much. She is certainly the most bold of the Doomtree collective in terms of stepping new territory. This is a clear example of that. Also, this may be the best version of “Warsaw” out there.\n\n21. Andrew Bird – My Finest Work Yet\n\nThis one made impression on me immediately with the first single that was released before the album. “Bloodless” is a six-and-a-half minute wonder in a smooth jazz groove. It sounds both classic and modern, which is something I would argue that Bird is gifted at. Somehow he manages to layer things together just right to get this vintage feel while staying rooted here and now. Andrew Bird has an arsenal of talents, and blends them all together so well. It might be easy for someone to say “oh, that’s the guy that whistles a lot”, but his skills as a multi-instrumentalist, composer and songwriter are all very visible with this release.\n\n20. Bon Iver – i,i\n\nBon Iver has steadily widened the sound palette you’d expect of the project. What started as Justin Vernon’s largely acoustic and “woodsy” project has grown steadily with each release into the huge sound that you can hear on this record. To be honest, I think 22, a Million went farther out there in the sound, and this drew things back a little (in a good way). I went through cycles with this one. I really loved certain tracks at first, but then developed new favorites. It’s an amazing record.\n\n19. Strand of Oaks – Eraserland\n\nThis is a release that I wrote about back when it first came out, and I’m happy to see a number of those have really stuck with me this year. Tim Showalter was so open and vulnerable about where this album came from, and I have tremendous respect for his courage. He was at a low point, and said he didn’t think he’d ever make music again after the tour ended for his previous album, Hard Love. The members of My Morning Jacket contacted him while on a gap in their own tour schedule, and basically told him they wanted to be his backing band for the next record. They got him in the studio, and he wrote most of this record in a short period of time.\n\n18. Sudan Archives – Athena\n\nThis was among my most anticipated albums of the year. I’ve been waiting for a Sudan Archives full-length release for awhile now. There are some massive standout tracks on this album, and she proved my anticipation was not misplaced. There are some massive standout tracks on this record with “Glorious”, “Limitless” and “Confessions”. It really ended up missing my top 10 because there were some tracks that came off as weaker for me, but I was super happy to spend some serious hours with this album.\n\n17. Cave Clove – Dollars to Tokens EP\n\nLook, you see the great albums I didn’t include, and you see the great albums I already listed. I rarely put EPs in my top albums, but this is a testament to how much I enjoyed this and how highly I think of this group. I discovered them last year when I saw them play a show at Scuttlebutt Brewery along with I Will Keep Your Ghost, The Tellers, and Smokey Brights. They put on a fantastic show, and I hope to see a lot more music from them in the future. I got to hang out and chat with them a little at that show, and they are also really cool people.\n\n16. Kishi Bashi – Omoiyari\n\nOkay, so how many violinists can I put in this list? Andrew Bird, Sudan Archives, and no Kishi Bashi… but each one is so totally different. Kishi Bashi really made a record that I connected with this year. “Marigolds” is an absolutely beautiful song, “F Delano” explores a personal reflection on history and the lenses we view it with, and the record closes with a folksy romp in “Annie, Heart Thief of the Sea”. I feel like it is worth mentioning that has to be one of my favorite album covers as well.\n\n15. Little Simz – GREY Area\n\nThis album just struts to center stage. It rips the mic away from whoever is holding it, and doesn’t give it up until it’s done. This is most evident in the swagger of “Boss”. That mean bass riff, and Little Simz slamming every line in your face. Perhaps even better is the stripped down arrangement on “Pressure” where her writing and rhymes really reach a summit. Guest appearances by Michael Kiwanuka, Little Dragon, Cleo Sol, and Chronixx are perfect for what the record needs. Little Simz shows her varied talents with different stylings on tracks like “101 FM” and “Flowers”.\n\n14. Rodrigo y Gabriela – Mettavolution\n\nI’m a guitar player, and this record just speaks to me on that level. The Mexican duo have put out one of the finest guitar records you can find this year. I think this one was made by guitarists and for guitarists. I absolutely love it, and that’s basically all there is to say. Oh wait, one more thing… that massive, 19-minute cover of Pink Floyd’s “Echoes” to close the album is straight up jaw-dropping.\n\n13. Sinkane – Depayse\n\nTake a moment to admire this album cover. If you’ve not heard this album, then know that this cover fits it perfectly. Sinkane’s music throws you into a vibrant world, and it’s bright, exciting and inviting. More than ever, Ahmed Gallab’s lyrics center around his Sudanese-American identity. His focus, more than many artists, is on the positive. There are struggles, but there is joy and celebration too.\n\n12. Fontaines D.C. – Dogrel\n\nThe Irish rockers initially formed after bonding with each other in the pub over James Joyce poetry. First off, it doesn’t get any more Irish than that, does it? There’s elements of that sort of romantic and quaint origin story that shine through in their punk-infused, high-energy, rough-edged sound. From the declarative opening track, “Big”, all the way through to the poetic ballad “Dublin City Sky”, there isn’t a weak track here. Lead singer, Grian Chatten’s, talk-speak delivery highlights his Irish accent and emphsizes their roots. The emphasis fits thematically with the community-rooted focus evident throughout the record. On another day this could easily have been in my top 10. Give it a listen. I fell in love with this record somewhere in between “Dublin in the rain is mine, a pregnant city with a Catholic mind” and “It was underneath the waking of the Dublin city sky.”\n\n11. Craig Finn – I Need a New War\n\nThere was a fair chunk of this year that I thought this would make the top 10, and there was a bit where it slipped down the list forgotten. Craig Finn is just too good of a storyteller to ignore. He’s always had that storytelling aspect to his writing with The Hold Steady, but I think it comes out more consistently with his solo work. His songs are full of down-and-outers, but he humanizes rather than romanticizes. Sometimes sad, but often beautiful. Stylistically, Finn moves across a lot of different sounds here, but is rooted in folk-rock tradition.\n\nNext week, I’ll continue with my top 10. What were some of your favorite records this year?\n\nHere’s yer tracklist…\n\nLemolo – South of Sound\n\nCraig Finn – Blankets\n\nStrand of Oaks – Eraserland\n\nFontaines D.C. – Chequeless Reckless\n\nCave Clove – Edge of Emergency\n\nSampa The Great – Dare to Fly\n\nSudan Archives – Confessions\n\nDessa, Minnesota Orchestra – The Beekeeper (Live)\n\nBon Iver – We\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela – Terracentric\n\nCalexico, Iron & Wine – Years to Burn\n\nKishi Bashi – F Delano\n\nAndrew Bird – Bloodless\n\nLittle Simz – Pressure\n\nSinkane – Depayse\n\nDessa, Minnesota Orchestra – Warsaw (Live)\n\nSudan Archives – Pelicans in the Summer\n\nBon Iver – Faith\n\nLemolo – Swansea\n\nStrand of Oaks – Weird Ways\n\nCraig Finn – Carmen isn’t Coming in Today\n\nCalexico, Iron & Wine – The Bitter Suite (Pajaro/Evil Eye/Tennessee Train)\n\nAndrew Bird – Bellevue Bridge Club\n\nKishi Bashi – Annie, Heart Thief of the Sea\n\nCave Clove – I’m Still Tryin’\n\nSinkane – Ya Sudan\n\nSampa The Great – Final Form\n\nLittle Simz – Boss\n\nFontaines D.C. – Boys in the Better Land\n\nRodrigo y Gabriela – Echoes"
