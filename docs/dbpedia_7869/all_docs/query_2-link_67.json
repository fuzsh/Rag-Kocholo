        "text": "Friday | 09.01\n\nWhat: Seraphim Shock w/Faces Under the Mirror and The Siren Project hosted by Sid Pink with DJ Slave 1\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Iconic Goth-industrial band Seraphim Shock returns to the Oriental Theater for a set of its theatrical performance are rock. After many years of being not as overtly creatively active, Charles Edward has been releasing the new set of Seraphim Shock EPs as the Fairmount Chronicles. Chapter One dropped in 2020 and now Chapters Two and Three are set to release in 2023/early 2024. Opening the show are long-running EBM project Faces Under the Mirror which has been going since around the time Seraphim Shock became an active band in the early-to-mid-90s and downtempo, dream pop band The Siren Project who themselves are aiming to release a follow up to its 2016 debut Denouement. The Siren Project will include Andrew Novick of Warlock Pinchers on guest vocals for this set too. Give a listen to our interview with The Siren Project here.\n\nSaturday | 09.02\n\nWhat: Human Fluid Rot (FL), Many Blessings, Castration Pact, Whitephosphorous (TX), Sounding and John Gross\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: D3 Arts\n\nWhy: A night of noise running the gamut of harsh noise, power electronics, industrial soundscapes and dark ambient. Check out our interview with John Gross here and with Many Blessings here.\n\nSaturday | 09.02\n\nWhat: Synthbangers Ball Festival Droid Bishop, Elayarson, Star Farer, Patternshift, Jacket, Bob Sync and DJs Tower, Jay, Eric and Niq V\n\nWhen: 4\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: This is the inaugural edition of DJ Tower’s synthwave festival Synthbanger’s Ball featuring prominent genre artist Droid Bishop based out of Los Angeles as headliner as well as local practitioners of the artform. Listen to our interview with DJ Tower here.\n\nSaturday | 09.02\n\nWhat: Billy Idol at Budweiser Events Center\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Budweiser Events Center\n\nWhy: Billy Idol is the charismatic singer and songwriter whose career spanned early English punk through the New Wave and hard rock. With his shock of bleach blonde hair and Elvis-esque snarl paired with commanding vocals Idol first caught attention as the frontman of punk group Generation X but garnered widespread mainstream fame releasing music under his own name. Scoring a string of hits throughout the 80s holstered by iconic music videos from the early days of MTV onward Idol’s songs have somehow become closely associated with the decade with an appeal that transcends pure, generational nostalgia. Songs like “White Wedding (Part 1),” “Dancing With Myself,” “Rebel Yell,” “Eyes Without a Face,” and “Flesh For Fantasy” are staples of any 80s and New Wave playlist but whose sound has aged well because of the strength of the songwriting. Idol has continued to release music since his heyday including the 2022 EP The Cage and his live performances remain vital. He performs a headlining show this night in Loveland and the next evening for Jazz Aspen sharing the stage with Foo Fighters and Jade Jackson (linked below).\n\nSunday | 09.03\n\nWhat: Foo Fighters w/Billy Idol and Jade Jackson\n\nWhen: 3\n\nWhere: Jazz Aspen\n\nMonday | 09.04\n\nWhat: Blushing w/Wave Decay and Calamity\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Austin-based shoegaze/dream pop band Blushing returns to Denver touring behind the 2023 reissue of its first two EPs Tether/Weak out now in vinyl. Whereas the 2022 album Possessions was a collection of exuberant and spirited rock songs, the earlier material is more introspective and delicate in sound but live the band has a forcefulness that its recorded output might not lead you to expect and you can hear that behind much of the newer arc of songwriting as well. Opening are Denver dream pop band Calamity lead by Kate Hannington (who also plays guitar in psychedelic garage rock group Easy Ease) and Wave Decay, the Krautrock infused shoegaze band also from the Mile High City.\n\nMonday | 09.04\n\nWhat: Bruno Major w/Lindsey Lomis\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Bruno Major is from England and has a degree in jazz and started his formal music career in the 2010s though a session guitarist in his mid-teens. But listen to any of his records especially 2023’s Columbo and he sounds like he came out of somehow both the same worlds that produced the great soft rock of Laurel Canyon in the 70s and Nick Drake and Fairport Convention in the UK from the same time period. Not that you’d want to make a direct correlation but there is a sophistication and depth to his songwriting and a gentleness of spirit to his particular vocal style that is as soulful as it is insightful. Many modern artists have mined that territory in the past decade and more but Major seems to have truly tapped into the creative zeitgeist of an earlier era and translated it into the sensibilities and sentiments of our current place in history with an awareness of the personal challenges people face in reaction to the collective challenges crashing into all of our lives. You get the feeling Major understands and offers some moments of solace and solidarity in his music.\n\nWednesday | 09.06\n\nWhat: Glassing w/Deep Cross, Psychic Killers and Palehorse/Palerider\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Glassing is a black metal band from Austin, Texas whose 2021 album Twin Dream spanned the splintered emotional catharsis of the genre and its more distorted ghostly melodicism. Fans of later Daughters and maybe a touch of The Locust will appreciate Glassing’s seething, brooding soundscapes. Deep Cross also from Austin is musically somewhere betwixt ambient drone and industrial noise whose 2023 album Royal Water is as meditative as it is noisy and feral. Psychic Killers have been around awhile in the deep underground with its urgent lo-fi industrial noise. Palehorse/Palerider is Denver’s desert doom and ambient psychedelic post-rock whose own aesthetic dips into what you might expect but also an organic tribal sound.\n\nThursday | 09.07\n\nWhat: Grandbrothers\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox\n\nWhy: Grandbrothers are a duo from from Düsseldorf, Germany comprised of pianist Erol Sarp and engineer/software designer Lukas Vogel who are making their debut North American live date at Ophelia’s Electric Soapbox in Denver, Colorado. The project recorded its most recent album Late Reflections inside the Cologne Cathedral marking its own first time place as a site for recording an album. Sarp and Vogel wrote the music for the venue and in crafting the music doing so as though recording in the cathedral and with the actual building and setting as the studio. The electronic rhythms and elegantly arranged melodies alongside the elabroate, staccato piano work weave in and out of each song and mutually enhance a mood of something suggestive of the title and taking late night moments of clarity to express what needs to be expressed with creative intention. There are only five dates on the tour and Denver is fortunate to get one of the dates of what promises to be a special musical experience of an evening of avant-garde electronic music, prepared piano and modern classical fusion.\n\nSaturday | 09.09\n\nWhat: Unwed Sailor w/TREMOURS and Los Toms\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Unwed Sailor is a post-rock band based out of Seattle that started in 1998 whose body of work is largely without vocals but whose instrumental rock has a style of composition that is accessible in the way of a pop or rock song but communicating with pure mood and rhythm. The band’s leader and bassist Johnathan Ford was originally a member of Roadside Monument and Pedro the Lion before embarking on a path of songwriting that has meant experiments in not just instrumentation and form and lineup but also presentation from what you might expect from a post-rock band to live film scoring and a companion piece to an illustrated children’s book called The Marionette and the Music Box (2003). The latest Unwed Sailor album Mute the Charm (2023) seems to be a series of musical vignettes expressing the essence of a time and place with its ambient mood and textures and pace captured with a poetic elegance of composition.\n\nSaturday | 09.09\n\nWhat: Animal Bite w/Gutter Hair, Indecisive and Propane\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Animal Bite is a noise rock band from Casper, Wyoming whose sound is somewhere betwixt an Amphetamine Reptile artist, an industrial rock band and a psychedelic hardcore band. But really with its own aesthetic and a ferocious live show. Gutter Hair is the kind of noise and noise rock-adjacent band that should have been on Siltbreeze. May be from Casper as well but also possibly Laramie. Either way its 2020 sprawling collection of pieces called Dead Horse Sled is the kind of abrasive, self-indulgent, lo-fi affair that fans of the aforementioned label or of acts on Holy Mountain might appreciate. Indecisive is the kind of punk band that seems to have drawn some inspiration from straightedge hardcore but also touch of Dinosaur Jr and Black Sabbath.\n\nSaturday | 09.09\n\nWhat: Golden Donna w/CXCXCX, Terravault and FOANS\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Joel Shanahan has released music under various monikers over the years but as Golden Donna (his 2020 album Hush is a modern underground techno classic) his experimental electronic dance music could be described as the kind of rave soundtrack to the American DIY underground with vibes adjacent to IDM and early 90s techno and minimal synth. FOANS is in a similar realm of music with his own underground dance music roots as one of the artists that was a regular on the Deep Club circuit of nearly a decade ago. CXCXCX is generally a noise artist but aspects of his own sound are beat driven and he’ll probably cater his set more in that direction for this show. Terravault utilizes analog synths and fuses it with sequenced beats and punk rock spirit. Dark, spooky techno for the whole night.\n\nSaturday | 09.09\n\nWhat: Sweeping Promises w/The Tammy Shine and Cheap Perfume\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: A time not so long ago Lawrence, Kansas was known for great, underground indie rock if you were plugged into the DIY circuit. But like all college towns phases of who is around and active changes as the demographics change. So to hear about Sweeping Promises releasing their sophomore album Good Living Is Coming For You on Feelt It and SubPop came as a bit of a surprise. The duo of Lira Mondal and Caufield Schnug got their start in bands together n the late 2000s while at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas and then being involved in the Boston underground scene forming, according to Grant Sharples in a July 2023 profile on the band in Pitchfork, Sweeping Promises in 2019 after trying out different styles of music as Silkies, Dee-Parts and Mini-Dresses. In 2021 the group found a place in Lawrence near University of Kansas where Schnug has set up a studio and already recorded numerous bands. The new record is reminiscent of the kind of thing you might have heard on Kill Rock Stars or K Records in the 90s or out of Athens, GA in the 80s and 90s with punk rock spirit, pop accessibility and lo-fi charm. That Tammy Shine of Dressy Bessy fame is opening the show with her own effusive performance and Cheap Perfume with its righteous, feminist punk energy makes this a perfect lineup for a Saturday night.\n\nSunday | 09.10\n\nWhat: Sarah Shook & The Disamers w/Porlolo and Lines of Drift\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Outlaw country, country-punk, whatever designation fits Sarah Shook and the Disarmers, Sarah Shook is one of the most distinctive voices in modern country music on the still fairly underground level where a great deal of the best of that and other musical styles are found. Shook’s voice has enough of a rough edge to be interesting but their melodic resonance serves well stories of every day life written in a way that seems so specific yet relatable in spirit and substance. Speaking of, Pololo is more an indie rock band but Erin Roberts has a gift for turning a sense of humor into music with a sharply observational and existential bent. This is a bit of a make-up show for an event that had to be canceled in May 2023.\n\nSunday | 09.10\n\nWhat: Joy Oladokun w/Becca Mancari\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Acclaimed songwriter Joy Oladokun released her latest album Proof of Life this past April. The record solidified her reputation as an artist who is capable of unvarnished honesty and vulnerability with expression of her struggles and using that as a vehicle for emotional insight in crafting songs that are hopeful and fortifying without waxing into the performative. It is a pure fusion of folk and R&B in a fashion that hits with an immediacy and sophistication that lends its spirit of uplift an authenticity rare in mainstream pop music. Opening the show is Becca Mancari whose own 2023 album Left Hand propels their folk-rooted songwriting into new territory. Lead single “Over and Over” is a queer joy anthem featuring Julien Baker and at the heart of the song is an expansive quality that makes each song on the record feel like being able to stretch out and feel free after prolonged periods of being cramped by circumstance, by culture, by one’s surroundings. Because of that the album’s music feels like something that settles in your brain with a gentle touch that soothes out ambient anxieties.\n\nMonday | 09.11\n\nWhat: Generationals w/Ramesh\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Generationals formed in New Orleans in 2008 in the wake of the dissolution of their critically-acclaimed band The Eames Era. Ted Joyner and Grant Widmer still wanted to pursue music while the other three members of the earlier band didn’t. It was a pivotal year for America in terms of the collapse of the real estate market and the election of the nation’s first black president with all its attendant hope for change in the national culture. But in terms of underground music Generationals were part of a wave of the new indie pop when it still had a creative leg in the older incarnation of the 90s. But Generationals incorporated elements of soul and R&B as well as vintage, pre-1970s pop music. It was an aesthetic the group has been able to spin into a consistently fruitful body of work. But in 2021 the duo more or less scrapped what would have been its seventh album after some studio sessions mainly because they didn’t want to release something that they didn’t feel was up to snuff. So they went back to file sharing as well as recording and experimenting in person and taking advantage of various would-be unfortunate situations that you can read about in the bio for the album on the Bandcamp page for the same. What came about in the end is Heatherhead, arguably the group’s most fully-realized album to date with the usual sharply observed pop songs with an experimental edge and more than its fair share of amalgamating its early influences with a modern take on dance funk and electronic dance music highlights.\n\nTuesday | 09.12\n\nWhat: Dead Boys w/Fast Eddy and Flight Kamikaze https://theorientaltheater.com/event/415754/Dead-Boys\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Dead Boys are the influential and notorious punk band from Cleveland whose legacy of rowdy shows and brilliantly nihilistic and lurid songs proved incredibly influential on American and UK punk beyond its initial 1975-1980 run. Its 1977 debut album Young, Loud and Snotty is a classic of punk with its song “Sonic Reducer” as one of the essential tracks of the genre. These days only lead guitarist Cheetah Chrome from the original lineup is in the band anymore but it is his guitar work that has endured as well as the late Stiv Bators’ sneering, acidic vocals.\n\nFriday | 09.15\n\nWhat: Plack Blague w/Public Memory, Voight and Kill You Club DJs\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Plack Blague is the now legendary industrial dance performance artist from Lincoln, Nebraska who has established itself as one of the most dynamic and visually striking artists in that realm of music now. Sure, Plack has recorded releases but the live show with Raws Schlesinger dancing and gyrating in his spiky, leather daddy outfit to heavy, relentless beats is where the real joy in a Plack Blague experience is to be found. Denver is fortunate to have had Plack Blague come through several times. But not so much with Public Memory. The latter is the project of Robert Toher who was once a member of experimental electronic pop group Eraas who once opened for TR/ST in 2013 at Larimer Lounge but when that project fizzled out he retooled his gift for soundscaping and songcraft and emerged as Public Memory the debut album for which is a modern classic of darkwave and ambient industrial pop in 2016’s Wuthering Drum. The most recent Public Memory record Elegiac Beat dropped on September 1, 2023 with a more downtempo sound but with the gritty lo-fi lost VHS science fiction cinema aesthetic still in place. Opening the show is Voight from Denver whose seamless fusion of shoegazing post-punk and industrial techno is imbued with an emotional intensity that releases in cathartic bursts throughout the set. That the lyrics often scorch the horrible bastards of society is a bonus.\n\nFriday | 09.15\n\nWhat: The Milk Blossoms, Isadora Eden and Bell Mine\n\nWhen: 7 doors, 8 show\n\nWhere: The Black Buzzard\n\nWhy: The Milk Blossoms is the kind of indie pop band whose sound really isn’t in line with the more conventionally commercial form of that peddled to people through the “indie” branding in radio stations, playlists and festivals. There is something idiosyncratic and homespun and thus more original and endearing than most of the music that has been marketed to us. Fronted by Harmony Rose the delicate melodies and vulnerable and emotionally-charged music has an uncommon power because it feels raw and uncompromised. Isadora Eden’s brooding yet luminous new album forget what makes it glow swims in the same stylistic waters as Fiona Apple’s sultry pop, a noisy shoegaze band and PJ Harvey’s art rock. It’s a cathartic listen and the live band has amble amounts of that mysterious, dark energy as well. Bell Mine is a solo project whose gossamer atmospherics and textural sonic details lend it a mythological flavor that wouldn’t be out of place on a Panos Cosmatos soundtrack or touring with Laurel Halo.\n\nFriday | 09.15\n\nWhat: King Krule w/LUCY (Cooper B. Handy)\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Archy Marshall as King Krule is one of the few artists of recent years to have truly fused disparate styles and genres together and made something genuinely compelling, cool, inventive and creatively satisfying. You hear elements of hip-hop, post-punk, shoegaze, psychelic rock, indie pop and jazz. Listen to any of his records, his latest Space Heavy for instance, and you hear a disregard for conventional structure unless it serves the mood and message of the song. And every song feels like it was written for that specific emotional resonance with the instrumentation and production geared to enhance the effect. It’s tempting to compare King Krule to Unknown Mortal Orchestra in this way and like the latter, King Krule is a powerful live band that has this trippy and hypnotic music but delivered with a punk attitude.\n\nSaturday | 09.16\n\nWhat: Rob Zombie w/Alice Cooper, Ministry and Filter\n\nWhen: 4:30\n\nWhere: Fiddler’s Green\n\nWhy: Halloween is on the horizon and with the advent of fall this is the perfect concert to usher in spooky season. Rob Zombie is of course the songwriter and musician who was the frontman of gonzo, psychedelic heavy metal band White Zombie from 1985-1998 after which time he embarked on a music career under his own name with a similar aesthetic of grindhouse meets schlocky horror and bombastic live shows. But chances are Zombie took more than a few cues from Alice Cooper, a band most closely associated with the lead singer/songwriter of the same name. Cooper combined vaudeville showmanship with campy horror cinema, hard rock and exploration of themes of struggle with personal demons and the inner contours of identity and its outer expression in conflict with restrictive social norms. Multiple songs are staples of classic rock and metal including “I’m Eighteen,” “School’s Out,” “No More Mr. Nice Guy,” “Welcome to My Nightmare” and “Under My Wheels.” Cooper indisputably established himself as the “Godfather of Shock Rock” for his 1970s concerts and their over the top stage shows with costumes, simulated death and elaborate props. These days Cooper is still a commanding presence who delivers a dramatic and theatrical performance and worth catching for that alone. Ministry too is likely an obvious touchstone for Zombie when that band transitioned from haunting and intense, pioneering EBM band to dark and highly political industrial rock from the 80s through the 90s. Apparently the group has been performing some of its older material, something largely unknown after the late 80s so you may catch a mix of its broad spectrum of musical styles. Filter is an industrial rock band that formed after Richard Patrick left Nine Inch Nails as a touring guitarist in 1993. In 1995 the group had its breakthrough single with “Hey Man Nice Shot” from its debut album Short Bus. Founding member Brian Liesegang left after the release of that record but has now reunited with Patrick for the writing and recording of the 2023 Filter album The Algorithm bringing his imaginative production and performances back into the mix.\n\nSunday | 09.17\n\nWhat: French Police w/Closed Tear and Lesser Care\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Chicago’s French Police are prominent practitioners of that more lo-fi end of the modern post-punk spectrum that embraced that thin guitar sound and minimal electronic percussion. But its thoughtful, introspective lyrics and solid, melodic bass lines and fine use of space make up for what can come across as cookie cutter, Euro-post-punk style. It’s most recent album is 2023’s appropriately titled BLEU. Closed Tear is like the Los Angeles equivalent of the French Police but with its guitar style more in the realm of shoegaze and its bass lines generally more robust. Lesser Care, though, from El Paso, Texas is consistently a powerful live band with real sonic and emotional heft and intensity behind its performances. Like a band that was inspired by picking up some Chameleons records, early 90s shoegaze and maybe came up in the local punk and/or metal scene before deciding on charting a different musical path and one that has made it one of the most interesting rock bands out of the underground now.\n\nSunday | 09.17\n\nWhat: Atmosphere w/Danny Brown, Souls of Mischief, The Grouch & Eligh, DJ Fresh, DJ Mr. Dibbs and Breakbeat Lou\n\nWhen: 5\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Atmosphere returns to Colorado to headline Red Rocks as one of the stars of hip-hop that emerged out of the 90s underground to attain mainstream success. Comprised of Slug and Ant, Atmosphere’s songs employ a cinematic musicality in which it embeds raw and vulnerable lyrics about life and the challenges and joys it can throw our way. Its prolific body of work and commanding live shows seem like creative demonstrations of exploring the human condition and embracing the flaws and virtues of existence with a solidarity of spirit and basic compassion that can be disarming and hit with an unexpected poignancy. This stacked lineup of modern hip-hop luminaries includes Souls of Mischief are legends of West Coast alternative hip-hop and inside and outside its membership in Hieroglyphics have demonstrated a deftness of lyricism embedded into jazz beats and deeply atmospheric production across its long career. Danny Brown might be too weird to fully fit into a mainstream hip-hop context but this isn’t his first time at Red Rocks either. His music is very much in the tradition of hip-hop but his unique and eccentric rapping style can sound both abrasive and playful as he modifies his delivery to suit the mood of the song and its subject matter. And his beats freely dip into jazz samples, punk, psychedelic rock and electronic music and the avant-garde to craft his own fascinating set of stories to the point that his albums seem like commentary not just on life and media but casting it as science fiction stories from a parallel society in either Utopian and/or dystopian fashion. His forthcoming album Quaranta has been in limbo for reasons you can read about on the internet but hopefully you get to see some of that live at this show but even if not, Danny Brown is one of the most entertaining rappers of his generation.\n\nMonday | 09.18\n\nWhat: Arctic Monkeys w/Fontaines D.C.\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Legendary poet John Cooper Clarke said in a 2014 interview for Esquire that Arctic Monkeys were the closest we had to the Beatles at that time. He was referring to how big a splash the post-punk band from Sheffield had made even before its epochal 2013 album AM was released and broke the group to the USA with the single “Do I Wanna Know?” fairly ubiquitous on modern rock and indie rock-adjacent playlists and radio stations. The Monkeys had borrowed Clarke’s words for the song “I Wanna Be Yours” from his poem of the same name and drawing on that resonance with UK popular music and culture going back decades. The band’s body of work has shown that it has been willing to evolve its sound in interesting new directions during the course of its career including the futuristic sounds of its follow-up album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino and the darker, moodier 2022 album The Car behind which its touring now. Fortunately someone somewhere in the Arctic Monkeys camp brought on board for this tour the Irish post-punk band Fontaines D.C. whose own sound brings together the brooding, post-punk grittiness with a scrappy political folk spirit that should appeal to fans of the band’s peers like IDLEs and Shame.\n\nTuesday | 09.19\n\nWhat: Strange Ranger w/Roseville and Fragrant Blossom\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: With its 2023 album Pure Music, Strange Ranger has shifted significantly from its already respectable, earlier indie rock phase. Replacing the guitar pop is a more electronic sound palate that’s moodier and more steeped in a creative use of space that has more in common with 90s electronic pop and downtempo than 2010s rock. It sounds a bit like something Matthew Vaughn would put in his next action noir film. Fragrant Blossom is something like a psychedelic, non-Western folk and jazz band from Denver.\n\nWednesday | 09.20\n\nWhat: Nuovo Testamento w/Church Fire and Desasociado and Niq V https://theorientaltheater.com/event/421388/Nuovo-Testamento\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Nuovo Testamento is a synth pop band from Los Angeles whose vintage electronic dance sound hearkens back to an 80s aesthetic like a fusion of italo disco, Madonna, Bananarama and New Order with a commanding live show that feels like a club music performance from that era as well. The group released its new album Love Lines in March 2023. Church Fire from Denver has a similarly energetic live show but its musical roots are more in an industrial and synth pop vein of a more modern era and its politically charged lyrics very of the moment. Desasociado is a more minimal synth and coldwave style band from Denver and DJ-ing the night is Niq V who is perhaps best known for his manning the turntables and other music playing devices for Outrun and Dark Tuesdays.\n\nThursday | 09.21\n\nWhat: The Walkmen w/Yeah Baby\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: The Walkmen were one of the big names of the New York City post-punk revival at the turn of the century forming out of the ashes of influential NYC cult band Jonathan Fire*Eater and The Recoys from Boston. The group’s 2004 album Bows + Arrows propelled The Walkmen into indie stardom and critical acclaim with singles like “The Rat” (recently performed on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEg_8mpp_Kk) and “Little House of Savages.” The band’s scrappy spirit and nimbus of psychedelic melody around driving, noisy garage rock stuck a chord with audiences widely. But in 2013 The Walkmen went on indefinite hiatus until 2022 when it announced a string of shows in April 2023 and later in spring of this year a more full reunion tour.\n\nFriday | 09.22\n\nWhat: Chromeo: Funk Yourself Tour w/Coco and Breezy\n\nWhen: 6pm doors/8pm show\n\nWhere: Mishawaka Amphitheatre\n\nWhy: Chromeo were early purveyors of electro-funk in the indie world in the 2000s after Dave 1 and P-Thugg took the skills they learned producing hip-hop tracks to make an adjacent kind of electronic dance music in the vein of funky synth pop but more rooted in the sounds of late 70s and early 80s disco and the compositional sensibilities of Bernie Worrell. But always in the way Chromeo presented itself and in its style of music embracing the irony of the bombast and making it both a celebration of the hedonistic aesthetic and a healthy sense of self-awareness that meant that they didn’t take themselves so seriously even as they made genuinely well-crafted dance party music. The group used to tour annually and bring some of the best more underground electronic rock and pop acts of the day regularly at large venues shining a light on those lesser known but the pandemic put the kabosh on that for a bit and now Chromeo is headling for the first time in four years and bringing the funk to the Mishawaka where it is very much needed and likely most welcome.\n\nSaturday | 09.23\n\nWhat: Danceportation: Monstercat Takeover featuring Infected Mushroom, Koven, Godlands, ShockOne, Whales and more\n\nWhen: 9:30\n\nWhere: Meow Wolf Convergence Station\n\nWhy: Canadian electronic music label Monstercat lands at Denver’s Meow Wolf for a night of psychedelic visuals and psy trance, bass music, glitchy EDM, progressive dubstep and dark, ambient IDM. Monstercat was started by two university students in 2011 with a passion for the then ascendant broad world of EDM and its adjacent styles more in the underground. The label focused on helping artists reach their audience with having a brand known as a portal of discovery and because of that unconventional approach to doing a label Monstercat quickly became a commercially successful concern that has partnered with various festivals and sought various avenues or promotion including the now defunct Pluto TV channel. The artists for this event which begins at 10:30 pm and runs through 2 am have all had releases on Monstercat demonstrating a sampling of its range and musical identity.\n\nSaturday | 09.23\n\nWhat: David Kushner w/Chance Peña\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: David Kushner is a young singer-songwriter whose career got a massive boost from TikTok when his single “Miserable Man” went viral in 2022 and his music started charting outside of his home country of the United States. His introspective folk style and a voice capable of conveying emotional gravitas beyond his 23 years of existence has resonated with fans and even a casual listen to his music hits you with the sophistication of its songcraft and command of atmospheric mood. For the April 2023 release of his single “Daylight” and its enigmatic/borderline science fiction-themed video Kushner created the TikTok trend “You look happier, what happened.” Also on this tour is another rising folk pop artist Chance Peña who at 22 is a bit of a music industry veteran having worked in making music for film and TV as well as contributing to the work of other artists as with John Legend’s “Conversations in the Dark” from his 2020 album Bigger Love. Peña’s latest EP Lovers to Strangers (2023) with lead single “In My Room” dropped in the summer but has major fall energy with its melancholic yet emotionally effusive and vulnerable melodies and tales of life as a thoughtful young person in this very challenging and conflicted period in our culture.\n\nTuesday | 09.26\n\nWhat: Wilderado w/Husbands\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater\n\nWhy: Indie folk rock group Wilderado originally from Tulsa, Oklahoma is touring ahead of a forthcoming sophomore album teased with the August release of its pastoral pop single “In Between.” Opening the show is Oklahoma City’s Husbands whose own new and appropriately titled fourth album Cuatro is due out October 13, 2023 through Thirty Tigers. The early singles including “Can’t Do Anything” have a touch of early 2010s chillwave atmospherics and post-Animal Collective, psychedelic indie pop but a fresh take on any possible influences. The new album has an undeniable post-summer reflective quality even when its melodies hit upsweeping, exuberant passages.\n\nTuesday | 09.26\n\nWhat: Tassel w/Street Fever, Teller, Desasociado and Kill You Club DJs & DJ Precious Blood\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Depending on where you check in with Tassel from Phoenix you’ll hear a different side of the songwriting and hear beautifully stark and noisy post-punk, industrial EBM, minimal dark techno and deathrock. Also on the bill is the enigmatic and epic transformation of what electronic dance music and darkwave and minimal techno and electronic dance music are supposed to sound like with a performance that is both confrontational and mysterious. Desasociado sits in the realm of post-punk and electronic coldwave with some nods to the Russian variety of both.\n\nTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday | 09.26, 09.27 and 09.28\n\nWhat: The Postal Service & Death Cab for Cutie w/Warpaint\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Mission Ballroom\n\nWhy: The Postal Service was something of a supergroup that formed after Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie did guest vocals on the 2001 debut Dntel album Life Is Full of Possibilities. That record went on to be a classic of electronica and glitch and at the time Death Cab was still very much an indie band. But the song, “(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan,” performed well and embraced by other artists for remixes and Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello (Dntel) decided to continue with their collaborative efforts. In the process of writing and recording songs Jenny Lewis, then of Rilo Kiley, came on board to contribute vocals before becoming a full time member. The trio’s debut Give Up (2003) is a modern classic of indie rock that helped to define that sound with the “Such Great Heights” single as one of the defining songs of that period in American popular music. Then in 2005 the group went on hiatus with a 2013 reunion tour celebrating the tenth anniversary of its debut and still sole album. Fast forward another ten years and The Postal Service is on tour perhaps celebrating 20 years of its only album but this time touring with Gibbard’s also rightfully respected band Death Cab For Cutie who have somehow managed to have a long career of emotionally rich and inventive pop music that has evolved from its more tender early releases that didn’t make it as obvious how much of a sonic powerhouse the group was even then to its more experimental later albums with fully integrated electronic elements that have broadened the group’s palette of sounds and widened its range of emotional expression. For these shows you also get to see one of the more pioneering modern shoegaze/psychedelic rock bands in Warpaint who are no stranges to bursting expectations with inventive use of electronics and left field production both live and on recordings.\n\nWednesday | 09.27\n\nWhat: Hannah Jadagu w/Miloe and Isadora Eden\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Hannah Jadagu’s 2021 debut EP for Sub Pop What Is Going On? was one of the most promising releases by a new artist in recent years with her fusion of bedroom pop and robust and sonically inventive guitar rock. But Aperture, her 2023 debut full length album also on Sub Pop, made good on that promise of lush sounds, sophisticated arrangements and lyrics that get to the core of what’s going on in the world but casts them in a way that has immediacy and intimacy that’s accessible. Live, Jadagu is a commanding yet inviting and soulful performer whose command of an orchestral array of sounds is impressive.\n\nThursday | 09.28\n\nWhat: Everclear w/The Ataris and The Pink Spiders\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: In the alternative rock era probably no one was assuming their careers would span three decades but in 2022 Everclear celebrated its 30 years of existence with a national tour and a reissue of its 1993 debut album World of Noise. On September 8, 2023 the group released the 17-track Live at The Whiskey A Go Go comprised of songs recorded on the 2022 tour as well as two bonus studio recordings “Year of the Tiger” and “Sing Away.” Everclear burst out of the aftermath of the implosion of grunge and the first wave of alternative rock with heartfelt and vulnerable songs with grit and a clear sense of joy for life even when the songs tackled challenging subject matter. Fortunately for lead singer and primary songwriter Art Alexakis and his bandmates the music has aged well because it never fully fit in with alternative rock trends being too punk for grunge, too hard rock for punk and not short on memorable hooks and a live show that even now comes off raw and authentic.\n\nFriday | 09.29\n\nWhat: Macula Dog w/Beau Mahadev, Docile Rottweiler, Pete Swanson (DJ) and Luke Petet\n\nWhen: 9\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Macula Dog is a New York City duo that maybe set out to write rock songs of a more left field variety but even its most accessible releases are filled with glitchy electronic mutant pop from a near future of failed states strewn with technological debris from which a diasporic human species will hobble together an existence before the next bubbling up of a coherent civilization. Or maybe it sounds like a glitchcore version of Anthony Braxton’s late 60s avant-garde albums. But Macula Dog also presents the music with self-made puppets and outfits to enhance the sense of something from a parallel universe visiting our own. Pete Swanson of Yellow Swans fame will be doing a DJ set.\n\nFriday | 09.29\n\nWhat: 28 Years of Son Volt: Songs of Trace and Doug Sahm w/Peter Bruntnell\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Son Volt emerged out of the ashes of foundational alt-country band Uncle Tupelo in 1994 when Jay Farrar left to forge a different path while his former bandmates morphed the remains of their previous band into Wilco. Son Volt kept more closely to the roots rock and alt-country aesthetic over the course of a career of emotionally vibrant songwriting that has helped launch a musical movement beyond its modest 1980s beginnings. For this tour the group is celebrating its 1995 debut album Trace and the songwriting of Tejano luminary Doug Sahm.\n\nFriday | 09.29\n\nWhat: Granular Breath (IA), Dead Hawk (Springs), A Light Among Many and John Gross\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Granular Breath is a drone artist from Iowa whose body of work is unsettling, deeply textural ambient music crafted from processed guitar and electronics hearkening back to a time in the 2000s when you would see a noise project perform that seemed rooted in metal but making something much more abstract yet no less intense and sonically engulfing. Also on the bill is Denver noise godfather John Gross as well as the like-minded A Light Among Many from Denver but whose soundscapes are closer to black metal and incorporate drums, vocals and Theremin and whose music has a darkly menacing quality.\n\nSaturday | 09.30\n\nWhat: The Mission UK, The Chameleons and Theatre of Hate\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Three legends of UK post-punk on one bill. The Mission UK formed after Wayne Hussey and Craig Adams left Sisters of Mercy in 1985 and recruited members of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry and Artery, two of the great post-punk bands of the day, to join the band within a year and by late 1986 the new group had released its debut full-length God’s Own Medicine, one of the landmarks of 1980s Gothic rock followed two years later with another in 1988’s Children. The group would go on to evolve with a more dream pop sound that has persisted after the group has experienced two hiatuses and now the core and early trio of Hussey, Adams and guitarist/keyboardist Simon Hinkler have been actove since 2011 with new drummer Alex Baum since 2022. The Chameleons were one of the great post-punk bands that came out of Manchester, UK in the early 80s but its sound quickly progressed to weave earnest and impassioned vocals courtesy bassist and singer Mark Burgess with orchestral atmospherics from original guitarists Reg Smithies and Dave Fielding. The group’s songs tackled working class struggles and politics with a poetic sensibility and uncommon emotional power that helped its ethereal melodies transcend into something more elegant. Its sound seems a clear influence on the shoegaze bands of the late 80s and early 90s and long term a massive influence on modern post-punk bands whether they know it or not. For a number of years Burgess performed the band’s music as Chameleons Vox but with Reg Smithies back on board since 2021 you’ll get to see as close to the genuine article as we’re likely to witness minus Dave Fielding rejoining since founding drummer John Lever tragically passed away in 2017. Theatre of Hate bridged the gap between New Wave, post-punk and death rock in 1980 and its membership has included Billy Duffy of The Cult and Mark Thwaite who was in The Mission not to mention Craig Adams also currently in the mission. The band came out of the London street punk scene and from early on it brought in saxophone to give its dark melodicism an otherworldly yet playful element but the driving bass, gorgeously gloomy guitar work and Kirk Brandon’s unorthodox vocals has set the band apart from many of its peers.\n\nSaturday | 09.30\n\nWhat: A Lifetime of Ephemera release party w/Cyclo Sonic and Elegant Everyone and spoken word by Brian Polk and Charly Fasano\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Author and musician Brian Polk is releasing A Lifetime of Ephemera, his memoir of attending shows with ticket stubs and other memorabilia, for this show. Polk has been a fixture of Denver’s punk and literary scene for over two decades as a member of various projects including post-punk band Joy Subtraction and one of his other bands Elegant Everyone will perform this night alongside Cyclo Sonic, one of the best local punk and garage rock bands with former members of The Fluid, Frantix, Choosey Mothers and Rok Tots. Poet Charly Fasano will be on hand as well to do readings from his own body of extraordinary poetry.\n\nSaturday | 09.30\n\nWhat: BABYMETAL and Dethklok w/Jason Richardson\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: The Fillmore Auditorium\n\nWhy: Dethklok emerged out of the immortal ether in 2006 with an animated television program in 2006 called Metalocalypse on the Adult Swim block of Cartoon Network. The group was said to enjoy an immense popularity and whose wealth and organization was ranked as the seventh-largest economy on the planet by the conclusion of season 2. Of course it was a fictional band but it released a debut album The Dethalbum in 2007 and in 2009 following the release of Dethalbum II the group toured with Mastodon, High on Fire and Converge. But in order to do so an actual live performance a real group was in order and series co-creator Brendon Small did vocals and played guitar (and other instruments for the studio albums) while heavy metal legend Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel, Death, Strapping Young Lad, Testament, Fear Factory etc.) played drums. And although Dethklok the band from the animated series was a ridiculous caricature of some melodic death metal band from Sweden with absurd lyrics and alleged lifestyles the live, actual human version of the band has proven to be surprisingly viable beyond the gimmick of being the live band version of an cartoon. Currently the group is touring in support of its 2023 album Deathalbum IV and it recently released a direct-to-video film on Blu ray and digital based on the series called Metalocalypse: Army of the Doomstar. Co-headlining this show is Japanese kawaii metal band BABYMETAL. It’s a gimmick but the show is dramatic and big production with screaming and dancing from the trio of frontwomen if that’s your thing.\n\nSaturday | 09.30\n\nWhat: Cut Worms w/Ryder the Eagle\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: For the last several years Max Clarke has made a name for himself under the moniker Cut Worms. His variety of countrified garage rock had built into it a clear separation from the trendy garage rock of the 2010s and his unaffected pop songcraft has always come across as earnest and direct. His earlier music drew on obvious influences out of 1960s pop rock. The 2023 self-titled album which dropped on July 21 found Clarke in a different end of that sensibility by tapping into the mood of summer nights and a time in life when summer meant fewer real life responsibilities and the potential for the kinds of adventures that seem attainable and sustainable and which endure even if they’re not so dramatic. On the record Clark further refines his ability to say just enough with economical songwriting and bring to spare sounds a touch of atmospherics to give his songs the air of the urban mythical Americana.\n\nTo Be Continued…\n\nThursday | 08.03\n\nWhat: Weapönizer w/Abhoria and Belhor\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Weapönizer is a band from Denver that has been obliterating the line between classic thrash and black metal with songs that seem to be tales of a near future dystopia. Think something like Venom soundtracking a film that’s a collision of Mad Max and a grimy cyberpunk universe. Abhoria from Los Angeles is of a similar vintage but with more atmosphere and groove to its blunt abrasion. The group recently added local Denver metal and grind scene veteran Ben Pitts to the lineup. Belhor is a long-running, blackened death metal band that doesn’t play live as much these days but its corrosive sound and haunting songs have an undeniable visceral impact.\n\nFriday | 08.04\n\nWhat: The Front Bottoms w/Say Anything and Kevin Devine & the Goddamn Band\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Depending on where you check in with New Jersey’s The Front Bottoms their brand of raw and emotional songwriting might be described as folk punk early on and an electro-acoustic form of emo later on as Brian Sella and Matthew Uychich have fully adopted a variety of sounds and styles as suited their evolving songwriting. Early material sounds like the duo listened to a lot of The Moldy Peaches, Andrew Jackson Jihad and Pat the Bunny. And yet established their own sound that brought a tender sensibility and personal insight to impassioned punk songs. For this show the group is doing something fairly unorthodox by having the album release show for You Are Who You Hang Out With, which releases this day, at Red Rocks with some like-minded friends. The latter includes Los Angeles-based emo legends Say Anything whose heartfelt anthems are a distillation and evolution of its 90s post-hardcore and pop punk influences. And yet Say Anything has never been limited to that realm of music and its songwriting reflects a focus on songwriting over style and Max Bemis’ lyics and intense live delivery comes across as the kind of honed poetry that comes from pulling directly from the essence of the emotional resonance of what inspired the outpouring of words. Its new single “Psyche” contains all of that as well as a confessional, unvarnished spoken word section like pages from an unedited diary entry and that’s what you get from the band—a direct line to some personal truth.\n\nSaturday | 08.05\n\nWhat: Boygenius w/illuminati hotties https://www.redrocksonline.com/events/boygenius-475298/\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Boygenius is the indie rock supergroup comprised of three of today’s most gifted songwriters formed by and comprised of Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus. Their 2018 self-titled debut EP made a splash for its evocative amalgamation of the members’ unique gifts as artists and lyricists. In 2023 the group released its debut full-length, the somewhat cheekily titled The Record. Its fusion of delicate melodies and wide emotional range from the tender and introspective to the expansively cathartic, its tightly crafted, experimental atmospheric elements and rhythmic melodies proves not just that the debut Boygenius release wasn’t a fluke but that a collaborative record by three songwriters whose individual efforts are remarkable can be just as impressive. Opening the night is illuminati hotties fronted by music producer, mixer and studio engineer Sarah Tudzin. The band started out as a showcase of Tudzin’s technical skills outside of songwriting but the project’s 2018 album Kiss Yr Frenemies made it clear that her obvious talents behind a studio desk were equaled by her knack for crafting an ear worm indie rock/soft punk hook with slyly observational lyrics reminiscent of Liz Phair.\n\nSaturday | 08.05\n\nWhat: Listening Lawn III: David Castillo & Silt, Snowflyer, Kelly Garlick, Entrancer, H-Lite, Combart Sport and DJ Ursa\n\nWhen: 5-8 pm\n\nWhere: Carpio Sanguinette Park, Denver\n\nWhy: Denver-based experimental electronic music label Multidim is hosting its now so far annual event showcasing some of the most forward thinking, left field artists in the Denver area including new ambient star Kelly Garlick, modular synth genius Entrancer, dance glitch IDM experimentalist H-Lite, free jazz and dub mutant David Castillo and crafter of luminous, rhythmic ambient Snowflyer.\n\nMonday | 08.07\n\nWhat: Temple of Angels, Polly Urethane, Cherished and H Lite\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Temple of Angels formed in Austin in 2017 among hardcore and punk musicians Avery Burton, Patrick Todd and Cole Tucker who recruited Bre Morell as lead singer to explore more atmospheric sounds and more expansive sonics. After two EPs and a single the band released the Cocteau Twins-esque debut full-length Endless Pursuit on July 8, 2023. Joining the group or this show is modern classical/electronic pop/experimental industrial ambient-sample manipulation performance artist Polly Urethane whose shows always seem to be significantly different than the one before. As well as local shoegaze pop group Cherished who recently recorded their new record out of town and H Lite whose minimal techno glitch compositions are a playful progression beyond the usual blend of live hardware DJ sets and beatcrafting.\n\nMonday | 08.07\n\nWhat: Gov’t Mule’s Dark Side of the Mule w/Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Evening\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Gov’t Mule began life as a The Allman Brothers Band side project with current leader and gifted guitarist Warren Haynes and then bassist, the late Allen Woody. But even early on though the music is rooted in the kind of improvisational blues rock that the Allman Brothers made famous Mule has established itself as the kind of jam-oriented band that has taken the format and style in fascinating directions. Even if you were never into jam band music or modern blues or Southern rock in general Gov’t Mule is one of the few bands out of that milieu that has injected imaginative arrangements into the masterful musicianship to craft songs that have a widely emotional resonance and its detailed compositions aren’t merely a showcase for technical prowess, which is of course there, but making insightful commentary on life and the ways in which we make and find meaning. On the group’s new album Peace…Like A River finds Haynes and company weaving in introspective melodies and touches of a funky fluidity that truly expands the group’s already impressive songwriting range and includes guest performances from Billy Gibbons and Ivan Neville. As the name of this particular concert suggests, this is a performance of Gov’t Mule’s excellent interpretation of Pink Floyd’s 1973 masterpiece The Dark Side of the Moon. As well as choice cuts from across the band’s career. Jason Bonham, son of John Bonham of Led Zeppelin fame, will open the show with a selection of the songs of his father’s band.\n\nThursday | 08.10\n\nWhat: Dear Nora w/Elaine\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Dear Nora is the long-running musical project of Katy Davidson. Formed in 1999 in Portland, Oregon, Dear Nora was one of the definitive bands of the turn of the century indiepop underground. With songs that offer a tender and perceptive observations of the quiet moments in life when you have time to consider what your feelings are really about beyond the immediate demands of a work world and the like, exposing a world where you have the time and emotional space to really live unburdened by the expectations of a commodified existence. In 2008 the project was sunsetted but re-emerged in 2017 for a tour and in 2018 Dear Nora started releasing new records once again the latest being 2022’s human futures. This will be a solo appearance by Davidson with local opener Elaine.\n\nFriday | 08.11\n\nWhat: Lower Tar (LA), K129, Precious Blood, Modern Devotion and CXCXCX\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: This will be an all techno and noise show headlined by Los Angeles based industrial techno artist Lower Tar with sets from Denver-based, beat inflected harsh noise artist CXCXCX as well as Voight’s Adam Rojo putting in a rare performance with his techno solo side project Modern Devotion.\n\nFriday | 08.11\n\nWhat: Ghost Canyon Fest Night 1: Ghost Canyon Fest: GPR, Heet Deth, Quits, Moon Pussy, Shiny Around the Edges\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: The inaugural Ghost Canyon Fest kicks off with a slate of prominent bands in the noise rock and experimental rock world with the demented psychedelic noise of GPR, garage industrial psych group Heet Deth from Chicago, Denver noise rock legends Quits, Moon Pussy, the band that somehow combines sharp, absurd humor with harrowing and thrilling blasts of noisy not-punk and noisy shoegaze group Shiny Around the Edges from Loveland, Colorado.\n\nFriday and Saturday | 08.11–08.12\n\nWhat: The National w/The Beths\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Mission Ballroom\n\nWhy: The National is one of the most prominent bands out of the modern indie rock era that has somehow managed not to slide into a creatively rote niche. Its latest album First Two Pages of Frankenstein has a title that should appeal to literature nerds but it’s not merely clever rhetoric. It is an album that came together during a time of great uncertainty and personal turmoil for the band once its tour for I Am Easy to Find (2019) was canceled when the whole live music world shut down for an extended time and the aftermath of that time of imposed performance exile. Frontman and lyricist Matt Berninger, according to a January 2023 article in Clash, struggled to come up with lyrics and melodies for a ninth album and things seemed up in the air but when taking some different songwriting approaches and writing from what feels like a raw and vulnerable place the resultant record seems much more introspective and reflective than usual even for a band not short on those qualities. Like a big reassessment of life and what has helped define it for you and the foundations of your identity. The single “Eucalyptus” contains references to The Cowboy Junkies and The Afghan Whigs and searching through the things in your life that you don’t notice until you’re forced to look at them and these disparate details embodied in the things in your possession and what they represent or represented and the memories they stir and the conflicted swirl of emotions that can sink you except the song, like the rest of the album, feels like a gentle, personal reckoning and returning to find what makes life meaningful all over again on a new basis, a process which can be rough and make you feel like you’ve not found your footing but The National has give us music to perhaps ease this process with a spirit of solidarity that has in many ways always been a hallmark of its songwriting. Also, don’t miss The Beths from Auckland, New Zealand whose eclectic indie rock is in the grand tradition of Kiwi Rock in which all the bands sound different from each other and all manage to write incredibly catchy and clever music that could have come from nowhere else with an idiosyncratic style that can be easy to miss because the groups are so energetic and charming. The Beths’ fusion of fuzzy psych pop and shoegaze soundscaping at times in equal measure will take you by surprise even if you’ve seen them before.\n\nSaturday | 08.12\n\nWhat: Ghost Canyon Fest Matinee Show: Mat Ball (BIG|BRAVE), Many Blessings, New Standards Men/Sex Funeral and ABANDONS\n\nWhen: 1\n\nWhere: Mutiny Information Café\n\nWhy: This afternoon matinee edition of Ghost Canyon Fest includes a solo performance from Mat Ball of BIG|BRAVE, the industrial noise stylings of Ethan McCarthy for his Many Blessings project, a collaborative set from post-rock/avant-garde rock band New Standards Men and free jazz weirdos Sex Funeral and heavy post-rock group ABANDONS from Denver.\n\nSaturday | 08.12\n\nWhat: Ghost Canyon Fest Night 2: Pleasure Venom, Rick McGuire (Pile), Big’N, Endless, Nameless, Hoaries and Almanac Man\n\nWhen: 7/7:30\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: The second night of Ghost Canyon fest will feature sets from avant-garage post-punk group Pleasure Venom, a solo set from Rick McGuire of noisy guitar post-punkers Pile, Chicago noise rock legends Big’N performing a rare live set after recently reforming, post-hardcore/post-shoegaze/post-rock heroes Endless, Nameless, fuzzy, angular post-punk group Hoaries from Texas and Almanac Man’s amplified noisy attitude and heavy riffs.\n\nSaturday | 08.12\n\nWhat: Mary Gauthier w/Jaimee Harris\n\nWhen: 8-10\n\nWhere: Swallow Hill – Daniels Hall\n\nWhy: Mary Gauthier lived a whole life before launching her professional music career at age 35 in the late 90s. As an orphan Gauthier started life in challenging circumstances and struggled with alcoholism, drug addition and emotional and physical abuse, particularly as a gay woman in the 60s and 70s. But she weathered these storms and tried college as a philosophy major before going to culinary school and opened a Cajun restaurant in Boston called Dixie Kitchen after which she named her 1997 debut album. Her latest record is 2022’s Dark Enough to See the Stars and she is currently touring a series of career retrospective shows that feature her songs, steeped in folk and country styles, that seem to fuse a hardened resolve with a raw vulnerability to produce a particular resonant body of work. If Tom Waits and Bob Dylan are fans of your music you’re probably doing something right. Gauthier is also a published author whose fiction has appeared in numerous books and magazines and her memoir and statement on art and a peek into her craft of songwriting Saved by a Song: The Art and Healing Power of Songwriting appeared in 2021 to great acclaim.\n\nSunday | 08.13\n\nWhat: Ghost Canyon Fest Night 3: BIG|BRAVE, Masma Dream World, Church Fire, Dug, Flooding, Only Echoes, Abandoncy\n\nWhen: 6:30/7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: This final night of the Ghost Canyon Fest will be an opportunity to witness the thorny and elemental grandeur of BIG|BRAVE’s soundscapes, Masma Dream World’s unique sonic vision part spiritual performance art and part ambient composition, Church Fire bringing the heavy dance beats and catharsis of political commentary, Dug’s grindy noise rock, Flooding’s dark dream pop and post-punk, the post-metal and soaring melodies of Only Echos and Abandoncy’s riotous collision of guitar splinter and broken rhythms.\n\nMonday | 08.14\n\nWhat: Bully w/Bev Rage & The Drinks\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Alicia Bognanno helped to usher in the modern period of the fusion of grunge and modern indie rock with her band Bully in 2013. The singer and songwriter had earned a degree in audio recording and interned with Steve Albini’s Electrical Audio studios where she recorded demos before moving to Nashville to work at Battle Tapes Recording as an engineer and at the music venue The Stone Fox. The early Bully records sure sounded like what might be dismissed as “neo-grunge” but Bognanno’s songwriting shined through the superficial comparisons and live Bognanno has an authenticity and command of the stage that’s mesmerizing and from there the music seems fresh and powerful and not like a throwback. The new Bully album Lucky For You is peak songwriting for Bognanno with her signature use of sonic bombast to contrast with an unvarnished introspection and emotional honesty. Some critics have described it as darker and perhaps moodier but the record’s candid observations and confessional quality is without doubt a great degree of its appeal.\n\nTuesday | 08.15\n\nWhat: Everything is Terrible Kidz Klub! 2023 Summer Tour\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Convergence Station\n\nWhy: Since 2007 Everything Is Terrible! has mined the detritus of media cultural artifacts from thrift stores, garage sales and the like in the form of VHS tapes and in more recent years some streaming video for content to recontextualize clips of the most absurd and awful videos into informative and hilariously disturbing new forms. EIT helped to propel trash media culture into the mainstream of meme-making with its now nine found footage documentaries that shine a light on what our culture has produced and often decided to forget the way it does the rest of disposable media that reveals often uncomfortable truths about the submerged aspirations and dreams of our collective, modern civilization. Since 2009 the artist collective has toured with screenings of its films and have incorporated a puppet variety show and music to add just that special little layer of the surreal and weird to enhance the viewing experience of the people that show up. Perhaps the collective’s most infamous project is its goal of collecting thousands of VHS copies of the 1996 film Jerry Maguire with the goal of building a pyramid from the tapes in the desert. As of May 2023, the collection has reached 40,000+ copies and counting. In 2022 EIT released perhaps its greatest and most coherent creation to date, Kidz Klub! The film draws on the sheer dreck of the most misguided and misconceived television and home video programming made for children designed to educate and in many cases indoctrinate the nation’s youth. Even a casual viewing of the movie reveals recurring themes that edited together seem to be a continuous narrative with a touch of hypnotic reputation. For this iteration of the collective’s creative output the soundtrack pulled both from the original source material and original composition establishes the perfect air of the hyper real and otherworldly at once. In the live setting the movie is split up into roughly 5-10 minute sections interspersed with the puppet show and dance and song routines giving it the air of a psychedelic variety show in real time. It’s the kind of thing no one was asking for but which we all needed as a dose of sanity in a world in which we are increasingly bombarded with random content disconnected from the endless stream that is life itself. Listen to our interview with Commodore Gilgamesh of Everything Is Terrible! on the Queen City Sounds Podcast here.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday | 08.15 and 08.16\n\nWhat: Beck, Phoenix, Japanese Breakfast and Sir Chloe\n\nWhen: 5/5:45\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: This duo of concerts features three generations of the best alternative/indie rock bands of the past 30 years. Beck made great waves in the mid-90s as alternative rock was flaming out as a movement by not being limited to narrow genres of rock. He went beyond the more creative singer-songwriter and folk rock sound of his early music into more and more sonically adventurous records throughout the 90s and beyond establishing an idiosyncratic vision that connected with an audience that wasn’t ready to embrace a mediocre creative conformity. Phoenix from Versaille, France, launched in 1995 the same time as labelmates Air. Whereas the latter perfected atmospheric, experimental lounge pop, Phoenix went on to a career of different kind of sophisticated synth pop. Most American audiences probably first heard the group, at least those with a taste for arthouse cinema, in the soundtracks of Lost in Translation and Shallow Hal. But the group broke out of cult band status following the release of 2009’s Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and undeniably appealing singles like “Lisztomania” and “1901.” 2022’s Alpha Zulu proved that Phoenix wasn’t out of ideas and had absorbed recent production ideas and utilized that in the songwriting itself. Japanese Breakfast started as a side project for Michelle Zauner then also of indie rock band Little Big League. But with the new band Zauner had the full freedom to use it as a vehicle for not only writing songs about the tragedies in her personal life but also to transform her creative expression completely and after the first album Zauner proved herself entirely capable of writing ambitious art rock as well as heartfelt synth pop as well as evocative soundtrack work. Sir Chloe is at the beginning of a similar arc of development with the 2023 release of its debut album I Am the Dog with its knowing songs exploring identity and the roots of one’s yearnings and how that can shape the course of lives in ways both unexpected and seemingly inevitable. The songs are a mixture of the ethereal and introspective and more thorny and gritty that might be favorably compared to the early albums of St. Vincent.\n\nWednesday | 08.16\n\nWhat: Shamarr Allen\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Dazzle\n\nWhy: Shamarr Allen has been a professional musician in his hometown of New Orleans since he was a teenage member of Rebirth Brass Band. Allen grew up playing trumpet in a musical family and steeped in the rich and diverse musical traditions and legacies of the city as reflected across his varied and active career. Allen has cited Willie Nelson as his favorite songwriter and Prince, Pharrell Williams, Stevie Wonder and Quincy Jones as influences. Allen calls his style “bridge music” because it brings together a variety of sounds and musical leanings. He has collaborated with Harry Connick, Patti LaBelle, Lenny Kravitz, Willie Nelson and local legends Galactic. In 2009 he released his debut solo album and performed the National Anthem for President Barack Obama in New Orleans which lead to an invitation to play at the Governor’s Ball at the White House and serving as a musical/cultural ambassador for the United States to Brazil, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Congo. In 2020 Allen established Trumpet Is My Weapon, a gun exchange program following the death of a nine-year-old and the wonding of two other children in a shooting in New Orleans. In 2023 Allen released his latest album True Orleans 2 (due August 18, 2023), a sonically inventive set of songs that is at times reminiscent of a great southern hip-hop album but one informed by pop songcraft, R&B, soul and jazz and long on wit and sharp social observation.\n\nFriday | 08.18\n\nWhat: Dead On A Sunday w/Haunt Me and Hex Cassette https://www.bluebirdtheater.net/events/detail/476291\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Denver-based post-punk band Dead On A Sunday is headlining this hometown show ahead of its extensive tour in September and October. As for the variety of post-punk think somewhere between darkwave and alternative hard rock depending on the song and release. But however the style might be described these people have a sense of rock theater in a way that seems taboo among local bands in general more like an L.A. band with a glam rock/art rock attitude. Haunt Me is a darkwave duo whose fog enshrouded live show does nothing to hide the joyful energy of its songwriting that seems to contrast with the melancholic subject matter of its lyrics. Hex Cassette is the one man EBM blood cult whose wickedly humorous stage presence, often cajoling and goading the audience, is all part of a delivery system for well crafted industrial dance music that he often says is about death but which is more often than not stories with actual poignancy or at least melodramatic fictionalizing of real life events to highly entertaining effect.\n\nSaturday | 08.19\n\nWhat: Reggae on the Rocks: Rebelution, Iration, The Abyssinians, The Expendables, The Skatalites, Passafire, Judge Roughneck and DJ Mackie\n\nWhen: 1\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: The nearly annual showcase for some of today’s most noteworthy acts in modern reggae. Rumor has it this might be the final edition of the event so if this is up your alley consider making it.\n\nSunday | 08.20\n\nWhat: Jess Williamson w/Snakes and Patrick Dethlefs\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Acclaimed songwriter is making an appearance in Denver in support of the July release of her new album Time Ain’t Accidental. The latter allows for subtle musical interplay to frame and accent Williamson’s expressive voice and allowing it to guide the rhythm and pace in an almost intuitive fashion as she sings vulnerable and open songs about heartbreak and personal rediscovery and self-reconciliation coming to terms with missteps and coming out of a prolonged period of isolation and stasis. While Williamson’s frustrations are on display on the album it always seems, even when painfully honest, to be rendered in terms that undisguised but gentle and never simplistic. Williamson has never been one to mince words as a songwriter but on this new record her approach seems to be one anchored even more in rich personal detail that seem immediately relatable and which resonate widely.\n\nTuesday | 08.22\n\nWhat: Vision Video w/Urban Heat and Redwing Blackbird\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Vision Video is the unabashedly Goth and New Wave-inflected post-punk band from Athens, Georgia. They look the part. They act the part. Singer/guitarist Dusty Gannon even has a hilarious yet endearing and engaging “Goth Dad” persona in his social media presence with videos of advice and information about the subculture for younger Goths everywhere. But the songs are incredibly thoughtful, well crafted and not a cliché and the live show is impassioned and commanding. Urban Heat from Austin, Texas is also a post-punk band whose focus appears to be the more electronic end of that with soul style vocals but with a sensibility akin to that of Sisters of Mercy but more synth pop. Redwing Blackbird from Denver has similarly-minded aesthetics but with a robustly, shoegaze-inflected guitar style to bolster the electronic side of the songwriting.\n\nWednesday | 08.23\n\nWhat: W.I.T.C.H. w/Metius (Jacco Gardner)\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: W.I.T.C.H. is the legendary Zamrock band making its second appearance in as many years in Denver bringing its fun-loving psychedelic rock that threads seamlessly together blues and garage rock and more traditional African popular musical forms.\n\nThursday | 08.24\n\nWhat: The Body w/Troller and Dead Times\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: The Body is the experimental metal duo originally from Providence, Rhode Island but now based out of the opposite end of the country in Portland, Oregon. Since 1999, Chip King and Lee Buford have pushed the boundaries of extreme music by switching up the content of the music and tweaking the subtleties of tone and rhythm all while often still sounding like one of the most monolithic and elegantly punishing bands around. The Body has also worked in collaboration with numerous bands over the last two and a half decades and one of the most fascinating of these partnerships yielded the 2021 album with BIG|BRAVE called Leaving None but Small Birds, a haunted folk album. But whatever the configuration, The Body brings the intensity and catharsis at every show. Troller from Austin, Texas lets the weightiness of its lyrics and the deep mood of its compositions provide the heaviness of the music. Before it became a trendy underground style Troller was crafting evocative darkwave songs led by melodic bass lines provided by vocalist Amber Star-Goers and enshrouded in transporting electronics from synthesist and rhythm programmer Adam Jones (also of S U R V I V E, the band that wrote the theme music for Stranger Things) and guitarist/engineer Justin Star-Goers. The sound design approach to the songwriting lends it a cinematic quality that has always set the band apart from other groups that might be put under that darkwave umbrella. In 2023 Troller released its latest opus Drain via Relapse. There are a few bands calling themselves Dead Times but this one is the melodic hardcore/noise punk band from Austin.\n\nThursday | 08.24\n\nWhat: My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult w/ADULT. and Kanga\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult is currently touring celebrating its 36 years as a band with a set list that focuses on the group’s first decade. The band’s campy, industrial disco sleaze has always demonstrated a more fun and lighthearted side of industrial culture while offering a distinctive visual and musical style in its bombastic live shows. By the time Thrill Kill Kult appeared in The Crow (1994), the band had already been staples of the more underground end of alternative rock write large but its performance in the film was the perfect embodiment of the aesthetics of the movie. ADULT. is the great industrial post-punk duo from Detroit whose music of the past few years has really been the musical reflection of the conflicted and dystopian times we’ve been going through with a world on the brink of domination by authoritarian regimes and the already unfolding disastrous consequences of climate change with little to no vision and action by world leaders. ADULT.’s music is an act of human solidarity and a catharsis of ambient despair. KANGA is a Los Angeles-based producer whose dusky pop music is darkwave adjacent but also adjacent to a more dance beat infused chillwave and vaporwave with sultry vocals. It might be more apt to compare KANGA to the likes of Charli XCX and Jessie Ware than an artist out of the Goth world.\n\nFriday | 08.25\n\nWhat: Corey Taylor w/WARGASM and Oxymorrons\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Fillmore Auditorium\n\nWhy: Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor is headlining this show and touring in support of his 2023 album CMF2. The solo stuff is more melodic hard rock and serviceable enough for what it is proving the singer/musician is capable of more than the screamy and more extreme vocals for which he’s known in his other bands. UK-based post-hardcore/electronic duo WARGASM is one of the opening acts and its sound is like an update on 90s industrial rock but with much more interesting production akin to hyperpop club music. The other opener is Oxymorrons from NYC. Rap rock deservedly got a bad name in the 90s and 2000s and Oxymorrons’ mix of rock and roll attitude and musicianship and cloud rap style vocal production shouldn’t work but it somehow does because the performance fuses the swagger of both styles of music seamlessly and because it songs combine earworm melodies with a brashness of spirit. The band’s debut album Melanin Punk drops October 20 via Mascot Records.\n\nFriday – Sunday | 08.25-08.27\n\nWhat: Vortex\n\nWhen: Friday doors 4:30, Saturday and Sunday doors 1:30\n\nWhere: The Junkyard\n\nWhy: This second annual Vortex festival at Meow Wolf will feature over this weekend performances and sets from international stars of techno, house, and various other branches of electronic music as well as indie rock and pop that may not yet be household names but are certainly rising talents. Headlining Friday night is renowned indie rock/bedroom pop phenom Remi Wolf who quickly went from high school contestant on American Idol to signee to Island Records and Virgin EMI a handful of years later and in 2023 Wolf performed at Coachella. Her funk and soul-flavored songs are a new interpretation and fusion of modern pop songcraft and classic R&B style vocals with conviction and idiosyncratic vision. That same night Denver experimental indie rock stars Kiltro will perform its own brand of Latin flavored IDM indie folk psychedelia.\n\nHeadlining Saturday and Sunday night is internationally beloved producer and musician GRiZ who incorporates live saxophone performance with electronic production fusing dubstep, his self-styled future funk and glitch. Sunday is a special showcase of his mixtape series called Chasing the Golden Era. Rumor has it these may be GRiZ’s last live sets. That same night is also a chance to catch TOKiMONSTA and her widely eclectic set of electronic dance music that runs that gamut of hip-hop, IDM, house, R&B, pop and beyond.\n\nSaturday | 08.26\n\nWhat: Portrayal of Guilt, Fearing, Spine, Gag, Edith Pike, Cloakroom, Royal Drug, Raw Breed and Candy Apple\n\nWhen: 5\n\nWhere: D3\n\nWhy: This mini-festival will include sets from some of the best bands out of modern hardcore and experimental music. Portrayal of Guilt has long mingled noise rock, black metal, grind and post-hardcore with live shows that are caustic and forceful. Its latest album is Devil Music which released on Run For Cover in April 2023. The darkly cast tones and harrowing lyrics have been part of Portrayal of Guilt’s aesthetic from early on but this time the music seems a tad spookier and reaching to genuinely more pained places in the psyche. Edith Pike and Raw Breed are noteworthy hardcore bands from Denver but whose music isn’t cookie cutter and more with flavors of noise rock in the mix. Same with Candy Apple whose music is like a highly energetic cross between Hüsker Dü and one of those early straight edge bands. It shouldn’t work but it does. The bands that will be very different from the rest are deathrock band Fearing and heavy shoegaze band Cloakroom but they’ll also help to give this show a nice break from all groups with a decided root in hardcore.\n\nSaturday | 08.26\n\nWhat: The Dendrites 20th Anniversary Show w/The Repercussions, Potato Pirates and Denver Vintae Reggae Society\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: The Dendrites have been arguably Denver’s most prominent ska band for decades at this point and its seven members deliver a high energy show that redeems a modern form of a style of music that nearly got ruined by some of its 90s cognates. Same with The Repercussions whose own history with the music goes back to the 90s. Potato Pirates are one of the great ska punk bands of today who went from emerging from early street punk origins into a tight and popular band. And of course a night like this wouldn’t be complete without Denver Vintage Reggae Society.\n\nSaturday | 08.26\n\nWhat: Fear w/CH3, Frontside Five and Sack\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Fear is one of the first wave of Los Angeles punk bands that was captured so dramatically by Penelope Spheeris’ 1981 punk documentary classic The Decline of Western Civilization. Notorious for misanthropic lyrics but really irreverent and dark yet sharply observed humor, Fear has nevertheless written some of punk’s most recognizable anthems in “Let’s Have a War,” “Beef Bologna,” “I Don’t Care About You” and “I Love Livin’ in the City” from its 1982 landmark The Record. Channel 3 were an early hardcore band also from Southern California that helped establish the sound and ethos of that early hardcore era and joined for this show by Denver street punk greats Frontside Five.\n\nTuesday | 08.29\n\nWhat: City and Colour w/Jaye Jayle\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Dallas Green performing as City and Colour is one of the most acclaimed singer-songwriters of the last couple of decades. But before his current arc of songwriting, Green sang and played rhythm guitar for melodic post-hardcore group Alexisonfire (which he rejoined in 2015 when that group reconvened). But it was that level of detailed songcraft and passionate vocals that he has brought to City and Colour. The songs for the project Green had been writing and honing since his mid-teens and when Sometimes released in November 2005 its vulnerable and personally insightful songs cast in a folk-adjacent style struck a chord with fans. For the next some eighteen years Green has developed his sound and used City and Colour as a vehicle for his more introspective and atmospheric musical expressions and in March 2023 he released his latest album The Love Still Held Me Near. It’s a Green’s most sonically rich and widely expressive record to date and delves into the depths of loss and how to move through low points in the heart while honoring the connections you had with people you won’t be seeing around anymore. The subject matter is weighty but the album in its delicacy of sentiments and soaring melodies embodies a perspective that embraces human imperfection and limitations without being sunk by them. Opening the show is Jaye Jayle aka Evan Patterson who releases his own more acoustic and experimental singer-songwriter-oriented material. Patterson too has had his own past in acclaimed post-hardcore music as a former member of the influential mathcore band Breather Resist and later as the more heavy noise rock group Young Widows. His recently released Don’t Let Your Love Life Get You Down is cosmically pastoral and tinged with spectral fuzz and electronic sounds like a brooding, post-punk, psychedelic country record.\n\nTuesday | 08.29\n\nWhat: Poppy and Pvris w/Tommy Genesis\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Poppy and Pvris bring their Godless/Goddess co-headlining tour to Denver. Both artists have made a career of genre-bending and breaking music that incorporates a strong visual element in both performance and in creative and innovative music videos. Poppy with a background in dance brings a real sense of choreographed movement to the stage show with music that is simultaneously a sort of hyperpop and heavy metal. Her song “Bloodmoney” garnered her a 2021 Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance, a first for a solo female artist. For this show you’ll probably get a preview of the forthcoming album Zig, due to drop on October 27, 2023. Pvris dropped its own new album Evergreen on July 14, 2023 and its lead single “Goddess” with its refreshingly racy music video is a little like a Charli XCX song gone industrial rock.\n\nWednesday | 08.30\n\nWhat: Guerilla Toss w/DJ Bhodi\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Guerilla Toss is flying into Denver for this one-off “Day Zero Party” to perform two sets of its brilliantly entrancing fusion of Krautrock, psychedelia, improvisational pop and art rock. Its latest album Famously Alive (2022, Sub Pop) bubbled up out of the stasis of the early pandemic as a statement of vitality and an expression in defiance of the political and cultural impulse toward austerity. From its early days Guerilla Toss has brought a rich tapestry of colorful sonics to the music and live show and with two sets of music, who can say exactly what that will look like, for this event you’ll probably get to see a vibrant representation of what the band has done before and where it’s going next.\n\nMonday | 07.03\n\nWhat: Glare, Alien Boy, Roseville, Face Ghost, Broken Record\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: Glare is a heavy shoegaze band from Austin, Texas whose sound swings elegantly between dream pop, the moody delicacy of late 90s, atmospheric emo and slow burn distortion. Alien Boy from Portland, Oregon has long been evolving out of its early more pop-punk origins into a Cure-esque post-punk and emo powerhouse with emotionally rich vocals and heartfelt lyrics. Broken Record is a band from Denver whose own sound might have a touch of shoegaze tonal incandescence but its melodic songcraft hints and the influence of late 90s Midwestern emo and noise pop bands.\n\nMonday | 07.03\n\nWhat: Blink-182 w/Turnstile and Destroy Boys\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Ball Arena\n\nWhy: Blink-182 is a popular band that helped push pop punk into the mainstream with a string of 90s and 2000s hits and it’s either your thing or not. But the openers for this one point to the fact that someone in the Blink camp isn’t divorced from what’s vital and cool in the realm of music that isn’t already stadium big from the neo-nü metal phenoms Turnstile and Destroy Boys. The latter has been evolving its thrillingly arch socially critical punk rock since forming in 2015. Its ferocious mix of hardcore and garage rock has given us songs like “Locker Room Bully” and its music video that pretty much spells out and dismantles a genre of misogyny in connecting historical parallels between the witch hunts of the middle ages to the early modern era (and depending on what part of the world you live in, even now) and the various linguistic tricks used to dismiss women in the current era. But Destroy Boys has really delivered on exciting songs with heady content all along. The group’s video for its new song “Beg For Torture” looks like a cross between a really wrong ARG mixed with recovered police footage from an abuser’s dungeon and paired with the lyrics that point to casting off the effects of gaslighting and reclaiming one’s power upon coming into full awareness of the situation infuses the song with welcome originality of concept.\n\nWednesday | 07.05\n\nWhat: Josephine Foster w/Advance Base\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Josephine Foster is a singer-songwriter from Colorado whose musical path has been as varied as it has been inventive and imaginative. Her vocals recall those of folk singers from the first half of the Twentieth Century but with some background in opera there is always something different and otherworldly to her delivery. Her music is pretty much impossible to easily classify with elements of freak folk, Americana and ambient throughout her idiosyncratic career as an artist. Her latest album Domestic Sphere is like a musical chapterbook of haunted places and people, an homage and gentle celebration of the neglected and forgotten cast in pastoral moods and tones of fragile elegance. Sharing the bill is Owen Ashworth who for over a decade (1997-2010) wrote some of the most tenderly heartbreaking outsider pop recorded in recent years with his project Casiotone For the Painfully Alone. Since retiring that moniker and a bit of the ideas and aesthetics of that music, Ashworth has been building another respectable and affecting body of work under the name of Advance Base with its slowcore folk pop sound and emotionally resonant atmospherics.\n\nThursday | 07.06\n\nWhat: Telekinetic Yeti w/Stinking Lizaveta, Somnuri and Hashtronaut\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Telekinetic Yeti is a psychedelic doom band from Dubuque, Iowa in that post-Sleep/Baroness mold but at least its 2022 album Primordial lives up to the title with a set of songs that humorously reference cannabis, supernatural entities, esoteric knowledge and a more liberated future. Stinking Lizaveta is a trio from Philadelphia that formed in 1994 creating instrumental rock with roots in prog, jazz and cinematic music. The style the group has developed from the beginning has been summed up with the descriptor “doom jazz” because its sound has often combined heaviness with a musical complexity and elegance. Stinking Lizaveta establishes a mood early in its songs and its compositions vividly express ideas and emotional nuance that engages the listener’s imagination. Read our interview with the group here.\n\nFriday | 07.07\n\nWhat: REZN w/Oryx https://hi-dive.com/event/rezn-grivo-oryx\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Oryx is the respected doom band from Denver whose majestic yet scrappy songs break out of the tropes of the genre by helping to redefine it with more inventive rhythms and creative crafting of colossal, atmospheric guitar riffs. REZN is a heavy psych band from Chicago whose forays into evocative and haunting music incorporate the aesthetics of doom, shoegaze and cinematic ambient to create dynamic soundscapes that capture a sense of the cosmic and of the deep mystery of nature. The group recently released its new album Solace. The record’s cover looks like something one might have expected on an old Rainbow or Hawkwind record of windswept mountains and the sunlight breaking through a raging storm. The music within is not unlike that expectation set of epic journeys and existential catharsis through finely sculpted and orchestrated volume and majestically accented rhythms. If Lovecraft and Michael Moorcock had somehow collaborated on a dark science fantasy trilogy in the modern era this is the music for that story—menace, spiritual contemplation and transcendence. Listen to our interview with bassist Phil Cangelosi below.\n\nFriday | 07.07\n\nWhat: FOANS album release w/Taylor Bratches, ALX-106 and Scarien\n\nWhen: 9\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Andrew Dahabrah meant to dump a hard drive of nearly six hours and 100 tracks of his diverse body of techno, house and ambient music in 2018 when he posted it to Bandcamp and then retire his long running project FOANS. Times change and now a carefully curated 11-track selection of those recordings is coming out as Selected Classics on digital and vinyl with a release show this night. Respected Denver and now international DJ and electronic music artist Taylor Bratches will perform as will downtempo techno artist ALX-106 and his nature inspired compositions and minimal techno/house artist Scarien.\n\nSaturday | 07.08\n\nWhat: Juan Wauters w/Los Narwhals, Flora De La Luna, Movete Chiquita Vinyl Club\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Juan Wauters was born in Montevideo, Uruguay but moved to New York City in 2002 and within the decade formed one of the better of the then nascent modern garage rock revival bands The Beets. The group toured regularly throughout America often at DIY spaces and dive bars and made an impact with its lively performances and its three records and a handful of singles and EPs. But the singer-songwriter set forth with a project under his own name and a sound that wasn’t so terribly separated from what he’d done in his previous band but often with more of a folk sensibility. This is particularly true of his deeply introspective 2023 album Wandering Rebel which was written like many recent albums partly or wholly during the extended period of the early pandemic when no one was performing many shows and a lot of people had to take stock and stew in their own frustrations and anxieties and reassess life at least a little. Too bad America as a nation didn’t seem to learn much from the experience and got right back to the business and business and crushing the working class under the weight of spiraling income inequality and unaffordable cities with little relief in sight while the harbinger of fascism looms across the world including the USA where the call has been coming from inside the house for years. But Wauters definitely took the experience to heart and dove deeper into the potential lessons of those aforementioned times and gleaned some personal and social insights that he casts forth in arguably the best set of songs of his solo career thus far.\n\nSunday | 07.09\n\nWhat: Sparks\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Boulder Theater\n\nWhy: With the 2021 biographical documentary The Sparks Brothers following the 2015 collaborative supergroup FFS with Franz Ferdinand, Sparks has become more than a relatively obscure cult band once again and deservedly so. Forming as Urban Renewal Porject in 1966 in the greater Los Angeles area the core duo of brothers Ron and Russell Mael renamed themselves Sparks in 1972 and finding little support or interest in America relocated to the UK in 1973 for a few years. During that time Sparks hit its first creative peak as evidenced by its classic, weirdo art pop masterpiece Kimono My House (1974) and its highly underrated follow-up Propaganda (1974). Though the brothers eventually returned to America that time left an impression in the UK with Sparks exerting a bit of influence on the nascent punk scene with its irreverent attitudes and disdain for dull nonsense. Over the years the group’s unique creative vision has occasionally made waves in the mainstream but mostly among connoisseurs of visionary, idiosyncratic pop music. Its music influenced artists as diverse as Joy Division, Siouxsie and the Banshees (who covered “This Town Ain’t Big Enough for the Both of Us” on its 1987 covers album Through the Looking Glass), Sonic Youth and Björk. Sparks worked with Giorgio Moroder on its 1978 album Nº 1 in Heaven and secured its place as a direct influence on the direction of synth pop and its 1982 song “I Predict” cracked the Billboard Hot 100 as a “New Wave” hit. Whether you know it or not you’ve heard music by Sparks in multiple movies and television shows and its infectious melodies have become an underappreciated part of music culture. And now you can see the legends touring in support of their new album The Girl Is Crying in Her Latte, another respectable entry with forward thinking, innovative, creative music throughout. The live show is theatrical, informed by genuinely clever humor, self-aware cultural references and commentary and surprising moments from the brothers Mael who don’t skimp on bringing a sense of the spontaneous and often unpredictable to the proceedings.\n\nSunday | 07.09\n\nWhat: Fall Out Boy w/Bring Me the Horizon and Royal & the Serpent\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Fiddler’s Green\n\nWhy: Fall Out Boy has been for years the go to band for teen angst in the form of pop punk emo and if you’re of a certain age it’s definitely part of your cultural zeitgeist with its long string of hits going back to the early 2000s. Royal & the Serpent is the project of Ryan Santiago whose music is an unlikely but effective fusion of electronic pop and pop-punk with songs that are real, raw and vulnerable and delivered with an immediate accessibility. Maybe it’s because the band is from Sheffield, England where most of the bands have a leg in the experimental but Bring Me The Horizon though known for its explosive, emotionally vibrant and expansive metalcore sound also seems to be able to freely associate other styles of music into the mix as well as a wide array of artists brought in for collaborations that mutate its sound even more. The results may not be for everyone particularly if you’re not on board for the band’s current core aesthetic of scream-y post-hardcore and electronic/industrial rock fusion. But at least Bring Me the Horizon is trying not to get stuck in outdated notions of the good old days and other impulses that undercut creative growth.\n\nMonday | 07.10\n\nWhat: Creux Lies w/Plague Garden and Redwing Blackbird\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: HQ\n\nWhy: Creux Lies is a post-punk band from Sacramento whose sound is completely fused with a more dream pop and shoegaze sound rather than the spindly post-punk noodling that has been popular in those circles in recent years. Plague Garden is a post-punk band from Denver whose pure fusion of electronic and rock blurs the line between deathrock, dream pop and neo-New Wave. Redwing Blackbird is a post-punk duo whose sounds are steeped not just in the gloom pop of The Cure but of psychedelic rock in the vein of The Legendary Pink Dots and Pink Floyd.\n\nTuesday-Friday | 07.11-07.14\n\nWhat: Bonnie “Prince Billy” w/Faun Fables\n\nWhen: 7 (07.11 and 07.12), 6 (07.13), 7 (07.14)\n\nWhere: Soiled Dove (07.11 and 07.12), The Armory (07.13) and Lulu’s Downstairs (07.14)\n\nWhy: Ahead of the August 11, 2023 release of his new album Keeping Secrets Will Destroy You on Drag City, Bonnie “Prince” Billy aka Will Oldham is touring with a string of shows in Colorado in Denver, Colorado Springs and Fort Collins. Maybe you’ll get to hear more of the new material than has already been revealed online but either way, Oldham’s singular voice and creative vision as a songwriter and artist who pushes the boundaries of the kind of freak folk, country and and lo-fi rock that has been the hallmark in his career from the various Palace projects, the prolific releases under the Bonnie “Prince” Billy moniker to Superwolves and other collaborations. He has a knack for making the cosmic intimate and the profane profound both on the recorded format and as a live performer.\n\nWednesday | 07.12\n\nWhat: Final Gasp w/Weathered Statues, Victim of Fire, Merry and Maintainer\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: The members of Final Gasp came out of hardcore (Antagonize, Wound Man) but with its 2019 debut Baptism of Desire and its follow-up Haunting Whisper from 2021, that kind of energy and intensity is channeled into a moodier deathrock sound that incorporates that hardcore sensibility with metal and post-punk. The group is currently touring ahead of the September 22, 2023 release of its new record Mourning Moon. Joining them for this show are local bands across the spectrum of hardcore (Victim of Fire) and post-punk (Weathered Statues) and sounds outside of that direct spectrum of rock.\n\nFriday | 07.14\n\nWhat: Wallice w/Nitefire and Card Catalog\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Wallice was born and raised in and is now based out of the Los Angeles area. Since 2017 she has released a series of songs and EPs noteworthy for their self-aware wit and sharply articulated sociological observations and commentary on modern life and relationships. Though her output might be loosely described as bedroom pop there is a level of production and songcraft that elevates her songs into the realm of indie pop more often associated with the likes of Snail Mail and Soccer Mommy. Directly off a Australian dates with The 1975, Wallice is touring in support of her new EP Mr. Big Shot, her most fully realized and set of compositions to date.\n\nSaturday | 07.15\n\nWhat: Isadora Eden album release w/Pink Lady Monster and Deth Rali\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Isadora Eden started as a solo project in a more indie singer-songwriter vein but even the early releases were imbued with an imaginative flair and an ear for deeper emotional coloring. As Eden brought on board collaborators to help flesh out the sound in the newer songs she was writing the music evolved into a darker, more sonically rich sound that was a bit more like something one might expect to hear from a songwriter like PJ Harvey or Mary Timony but more darkwave, more flourishes of atmospheric sounds both guitar-rooted and electronic akin to the stranger end of shoegaze. This creative period has resulted in one of the more fascinating records of 2023 in forget what makes it glow, the debut full-length for the project. Eden’s deeply evocative voice guides you through an introspective set of songs that are melancholic, reflective and in the end cathartic. Like the kind of dream pop record with some grit and edge, willing to wax noisy in moments as if to embody the way life and our subsconscious experiences are analog and meaningful, intimate, in a way pristine digital and curated experiences rarely are. The album will be available on vinyl and digital and for more information on finding group’s releases, social media and upcoming shows please visit the band’s website.Pink Lady Monster is one of the most interesting bands out of Denver or anywhere now because it incorporates elements of experimental dream pop, experimental jazz and noise rock for a sound that is entrancing and challenging at once.\n\nSaturday | 07.15\n\nWhat: The Goddamn Gallows w/IV and The Strange Band and Volk\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: The Goddamn Gallows are a band that has picked up musical ideas and styles in its meandering journey as a band since beginning in the early part of the 2000s. These days the group is a raucous and charming mish mash of punk Americana and metal with an wisacre sense of humor long on irony. Volk is a rambunctious, psychedelic honky tonk duo from Nashville that recently released its latest EP, Stand the Test which reveals its knack for pop songcraft as remixed and reinterpreted by friends into new territory for the band.
