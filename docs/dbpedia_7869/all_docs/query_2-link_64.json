        "meta_description": "If you’re here then we’d like to assume you are a music fan with impeccable taste, and appreciate the job we’re trying to do in promoting the very best in alternative music.\n\nBoth Stephen and Remfry (that’s us) have written and spoken millions of words about our favourite bands in everything from The Independent and The Guardian to Metal Hammer and Team Rock Radio, and beyond. We have dedicated large chunks of our lives to passionately promoting our favourite music, but never has there been an outlet that offers us the opportunity to rep for all the many genres of alternative music that we adore. Until now. Whether you are a fan of brutal death metal or wistful singer songwriters, three chord punk rock or sprawling prog epics, we believe that music in all of its forms deserves to be celebrated. So we started Riot Act to do exactly that.<br/><br/>This podcast",

        "text": "Horns up...? Yeah, why not. It's another episode of Riot Act, where Steve and Sam have spent the week diving into all manner of heavy metal goodness... and some not so goodness. We catch up on some of the some prominent releases in metal from Behemoth, Clutch, Ozzy Osbourne, The Devil Wears Prada, The Hu, Stake, Megadeth, END & Cult Leader, Blackbraid and Sabotor.\n\nSam also saw Machine Head and Amon Amarth in Nottingham, and we talk about the news that Mark Chapman has been denied parole once again and think back to some significant support slot refusals after hearing the news that The 1975 decided not to open for Ed Sheeran.\n\nThis podcast uses the following third-party services for analysis:\n\nChartable - https://chartable.com/privacy"
