        "text": "It's fair to assume the past few years have been the worst of Josh Homme's life.\n\nAs we speak, the 50-year-old frontman of Queens Of The Stone Age – one of modern rock's most acclaimed and popular bands – is embroiled in a messy and public custody battle with ex-wife Brody Dalle.\n\nHe's had many close friends die in recent years, among them former QOTSA bandmate Mark Lanegan, friend and Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, and food and travel icon Anthony Bourdain.\n\nLast year, he was diagnosed with cancer. Speaking with Double J, Homme's only comment on his recent illness was that it impacted on the already prolonged gap between Queens Of The Stone Age records.\n\n\"It was my fault. I was a little bit ill for a second,\" he says, admitting that the band's eighth album should have been released earlier this year.\n\n\"I mean, now I'm fine. But we were ready to go. We've been ready to go.\"\n\nCombine these personal horrors with the global health crisis that all but shut down his industry in early 2020, and there was plenty to be upset about.\n\n\"It's been an interesting four years for everyone,\" Homme acknowledges over Zoom from his Californian home. \"Everyone's been dealing with a lot of stuff. I too have been dealing with a lot of stuff. I needed a minute to untangle all my knots before I could write about something.\"\n\nIt was a long minute. Queens Of The Stone Age have just released In Times New Roman, their first record in six years.\n\nSure, the band embarked on their requisite year or so of touring on the back on previous album Villains, and they had to find time to actually write the songs. But even so, this was a gargantuan break, especially for Homme.\n\n\"I was in no hurry to make something,\" he says. \"We recorded this in one two-month or six-week burst, all the music. And then nothing happened for two years. I didn't sing anything 'til November of last year.\"\n\nThat meant two years of living with these ten fully formed songs, chasing down the inspiration to put the right words to the band's taut and brutal sonic attack.\n\n\"I was humming melodies, I just didn't have the words,\" he says. \"Or I wasn't ready to go after them.\"\n\nThose words had to be true to who Homme was at this time and what he was going through. He had to get it right, especially now.\n\n\"For me to sing something, I have to really believe it,\" he says.\n\n\"It's about being vulnerable enough with yourself that, if you're gonna sing from a place where you're saying, 'I'm angry', that it's legit. And if you're gonna sing from place saying, 'I'm afraid' that it's legit. And if you're going to say, 'I love you', it can't just be something you're frisbeeing off. I need it to be 100 percent real.\n\n\"I just want everything to be as real and as vulnerable and as honest as I can make it. That's what I'm wrestling with. Sometimes it just takes a minute. I'm not used to taking six years between records, but that's what happened this time.\"\n\nProcessing the pain\n\nJosh Homme does not hold back in his lyrics on In Times New Roman. All the challenging emotions that have coloured his personal life over the past few years have found their way into these songs.\n\nIn lyrics like 'I don't know what's true, particularly if it's from you / Oh, betrayal it tears me up inside...' from 'Negative Space' he leaves little room for interpretation.\n\nWhile he has a bit to be angry about, Homme says the record is more about learning to acknowledge and get through fear than anything.\n\n\"There isn't tons of anger,\" he says. \"When you sing about betrayal, it doesn't necessarily mean you're angry. That's really just more about being terrified, honestly.\n\n\"I want to sing about what I'm terrified about, and I want to sing about what makes me feel uncomfortable, more and more and more and more. It's just about being as honest as it can be. And sometimes that's hard.\"\n\nArtists have been using music as catharsis and a tool to process complex emotions forever. While it may seem hackneyed to attribute the rawness of this latest Queens Of The Stone Age album to the rawness of Homme's emotional state, fact is: it's true.\n\n\"It's everything,\" Homme says of his relationship with music. \"It's my religion, it's the way I pursue my ideals in a romantic way. It's the way I romanticise my own attempts to get rid of baggage.\n\n\"I think if you give yourself totally over to making music, you can become a better person. You can lift the heaviness off of you.\n\n\"There are some people that want to make pop music, some want to make country, some want to be famous, and some want money. All those things are okay, that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to write an accurate description of the soundtrack to me and my guys' lives. And I need it to be real.\n\n\"It's totally worth it because it works. I don't have a therapist: this is my religion, this is my therapy, this is my way out.\"\n\nThe first two singles from the album hinted at the sonic breadth on display on In Times New Roman. First taste 'Emotion Sickness' was a relatively sleek and taut rocker, while its follow-up 'Carnavoyeur' is dense, dark, and at times abrasive.\n\nHomme didn't have any overarching musical ambition for the album's sonic direction, hoping that a sharp focus on each individual song would culminate in a cohesive collection.\n\n\"Every song deserves the chance to be given that attention properly,\" he says. \"That way, the sum of the parts is only as good as the parts.\n\n\"The last song is called 'Straight Jacket Fitting', it's nine minutes, and it doesn't have choruses and verses, because that's what it needed to be, that's what it felt like it was supposed to be.\n\n\"'Paper Machete' is chorus, verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus: a very pop structure.\"\n\n'Straight Jacket Fitting' closes the album in intense fashion, as Homme comes face-to-face with that fear and sings about the self-imposed exile he faced in recent years.\n\n'I don't wanna go out / Told myself 'you can do this', but I’m having doubts' he sings at one stage.\n\n'I'm so goddamn sick of this place / Bring on the healing' he insists towards the song's end.\n\n\"That's almost more like a little mini film than a regular song,\" Homme acknowledges.\n\n\"I think there's a little bit of disdain for the marketing of fear on one part of it. The inability to de-isolate yourself from exile in another part. The frustration of 'Goddamnit, that's enough'. And then, somehow, there's this sermon in the centre of it that's like, 'You have nothing to fear'. Or the notion that we won't destroy the world, but it will destroy [us]. And there's a big difference there.\"\n\nWe can only control out own destiny to a certain point. Unexpected events change the course of our lives, whether we like it or not. In this closing song, Homme comes to terms with giving in to the unexpected.\n\n\"I learned an awful lot in the last four or five years,\" Homme says. \"I don't think I've ever learned so much in such a short period of time.\n\n\"I always thought the word surrender meant to give up, and I always hated that. In the last five years, I've realised when surrender means giving in to something. I think 'Straightjacket…' is a good example of giving in as a definition for surrender.\"\n\nIf fear is a prevailing emotion in much of In Times New Roman, does this mean Homme was scared that the inspiration to complete the vocals would never come?\n\n\"Yeah, I was petrified at times, honestly,\" he says.\n\n\"When fear is the reason you don't do something, that feels like giving up. And when fear is the reason you do, that feels like giving in. I can accept that.\n\n\"I want to be someone that fights for someone, and fights for something, not with them. I don't want to fight. I don't want to wrestle with something and just be stuck in that loop.\"\n\nTo get his point across Homme needed to strike a perfect balance between giving his songs the time and attention they deserve and ensuring he's not overcooking them.\n\n\"That's why I think Queens records have gotten more difficult to make but are somehow more rewarding than ever,\" he posits.\n\n\"Because I'm not just moving at the speed of inspiration, there's a lot of consideration and, at the same time, there's this equal matching force to not overthink it, to somehow find a way to say what you really need and then let it go.\"\n\nIt might be getting harder, but It's worth it. A great record can have a significant impact on innumerable lives, and greatness isn't supposed to be easy.\n\n\"It's a wonderful cliché to say that records help save the people that make it,\" Homme says. \"When you give everything you've got, they actually can save the people listening to it too. If I really love something, then someone else has got a chance of really loving something.\n\n\"I have no interest in being the biggest band in the world, I'd just like to be in the best band I can possibly be in. The only way to do that is to is to be very honest about the making of it.\"\n\nYou Can't Quit Me Baby: the continued relevance of Queens Of The Stone Age\n\nSeptember will mark the 25th anniversary of Queens Of The Stone Age's self-titled debut album.\n\nHe's been in this game far longer than that, releasing a string of acclaimed and hugely influential records with his band Kyuss before even forming QOTSA.\n\nTo stay relevant and energised after decades in the game, it's important Homme can still see the value in his work.\n\n\"I would really like to stay as vital as I can,\" he says. \"I'm 50 now. I hope I'm getting better at this.\n\n\"I still romanticise the chasing of my own ideals and trying to get there. I never expect to get there, but if I don't romanticise it then… I've had moments where I thought 'This is just some silly, stupid thing. What am I doing travelling around fucking door to door? What the fuck am I doing?'\n\n\"But I don't like it when I feel that way. I like it when I believe that it's saving me, and that it could be someone's favourite thing.\n\n\"In this rough world, that's a wonderful possibility that I would like to participate in.\"\n\nOne of the most alluring and mysterious aspects of a creative endeavour like music is, no matter how many great records you've made, the next one isn't necessarily going to be any easier. You have to work just as hard, if not harder, if you want your latest work to retain relevance in an often-fickle game.\n\n\"I think this is our eighth record, and I really would love the last record that I'm ever involved in to be among the best records I've ever made,\" Homme says. \"The only way to do that is to put everything you have into each record.\n\n\"You could ask yourself, 'Why does someone need to even hear your eighth record? What's the point?' And I think you're obliged to answer that question with the record itself.\"\n\nThere are benefits to being this deep into a career, the ability to be vulnerable with one's audience is among the most profound.\n\n\"In the beginning, look… I was just much younger,\" Homme considers. \"I think I would block things that I was scared of. You can do that in the beginning.\n\n\"But I think you realise that you're doing that out of insecurity as you go, so it becomes more and more important to allow yourself to actually sing about your insecurities instead of block them and pretend they don't exist.\n\n\"People are angry sometimes. I'm angry at sometimes. if I'm going to write about that, I don't want it to be from a place where I'm being an insecure little ponce. I want it to be from a place that's very genuine, so that it doesn't come off like some macho bullshit. Because traditionally, anger is the emotion that comes after being hurt by something or afraid of something.\n\n\"I just want it to be genuine and not based on being insecure.\"\n\nIf Josh Homme is going to put his fears on the table, he wants his audience to be open to it.\n\nIn Times New Roman features some of the most raw and brutal musical moments of a Queens record in some time, and some of the internal terror that Homme reflects through his lyrics can be kinda chilling at times.\n\nSometimes he's on the attack, like in 'Paper Machete', a classic QOTSA driving rock song.\n\nYou sculpt, you change, you hide, then you erase\n\nYou think you're brave?\n\nAll the plans you made behind my back and from far away?\n\nTruth is, face to face, you're a coward\n\nOther times he's observing the carnage around him, like in the taut post-punk blast of 'What The Peephole Say'.\n\nAnd the wolf's on the creep with the sheep on the merry go round\n\nAnd the shepherd sleeps while blood seeps into the ground\n\nOn the outskirts of town where the headlights bleed\n\nOh, Teen Angels in tangles\n\n\"I grew up loving bands like The Doors, that's where I learned to be afraid of music,\" Homme says.\n\n\"When Morrison says, 'Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake, and the minister's daughter is in love with the snake'. I'm like, 'Holy shit, what the fuck is going on around here?'\n\n\"I suspect the modern music listener is now often too afraid to be afraid of music. Or runs the risk of being offended by being afraid of the music.\n\n\"I think, when you're going to be vulnerable, you must risk. That's what it is, and risk is terrifying. I think the tension when you're trying to play and say something about an emotion, you have to take that risk and potentially be terrifying.\"\n\nLearning to let go\n\nMuch of the album was recorded at Homme's Pink Duck Studios, which he sold last year.\n\nWhen asked about the loss of a space that has been a key part of his career in recent years, Homme vents about the importance of letting go. While he's talking about his recording studio, it seems like this is a lesson he's also learned to apply to other parts of his life.\n\n\"I'll always miss it, but it was such a gift, and I did so much stuff there,\" he says.\n\n\"Regardless of all the difficulties that not only myself, but everyone has gone through in the last four years, overcoming them and realising that I want to accept things for what they are… I don't want to be someone that hangs on too tight for too long.\n\n\"It's okay to let things go. I've had to let a lot of friends go and a lot of situations go.\n\n\"It was so wonderful to have it and I'll have something else again. But when the world is telling you that this thing is over, you have to let that go. I've always done a lot of big change in my life, but I realised I've always been the agent of that change, so it's easier to do.\n\n\"In the last many years, I have been forced over and over again to deal with things that, it doesn't matter if you like it or not, it's happening. So, it forces you to figure out if you're going to try to hang on tight and not let go, or if you're going to accept it.\"\n\nAustralian fans needn't worry: Queens of the Stone Age aren't letting go of their longstanding relationship with our country. He reveals no plans, but the frontman says we can count on their return.\n\n\"Look, Australia is my home away from home,\" Homme says. \"It has been for 16, 17, 18 years. So the question is, how can I go back there twice? I can't wait to get there.\""
