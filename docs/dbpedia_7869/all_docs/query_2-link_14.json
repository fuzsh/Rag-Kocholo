        "text": "Queens of the Stone Age, often abbreviated as QOTSA, is a globally recognized American rock band that was formed in 1996. The band's inception came about in Palm Desert, California, after the dissolution of the rock band Kyuss, by its former guitarist Josh Homme. With a fluid line-up that has seen various members come and go, including notable musicians like Mark Lanegan and Nick Oliveri, Homme has remained the only constant member, serving as the band's primary songwriter, lead vocalist, and guitarist. Drawing from a broad range of influences, Queens of the Stone Age are known for their eclectic style that fuses heavy rock with elements of punk, blues, and psychedelia. This unique musical blend has resulted in a distinct sound dubbed as \"robot rock\" by Homme, characterized by repetitive riffs, heavy drum beats, and Homme's signature falsetto vocals. The band's discography spans across multiple studio albums, with Songs for the Deaf (2002) and ...Like Clockwork (2013) being particularly instrumental in propelling them into worldwide fame. These releases have been praised for their innovative songwriting and production, earning the band multiple Grammy nominations. The impact of the Queens of the Stone Age goes beyond their music. They've notably contributed to the popularization of the stoner rock and desert rock genres, with their early performances at generator parties in the Palm Desert Scene gaining mythical status among fans. In addition, through Homme's side projects like Eagles of Death Metal and the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures, which included rock legends Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones, the influence of QOTSA has permeated the rock scene on a larger scale. Despite the changes in their lineup and the evolution of their sound over the years, Queens of the Stone Age have remained a staple of the international rock scene.\n\nJoshua Michael Homme ( HOM-ee; born May 17, 1973) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, and actor. He is the founder, primary songwriter, and only continuous member of the rock band Queens of the Stone Age, which he formed in 1996 and in which he sings lead vocals and plays guitar, as well as occasionally playing bass, piano, and drums. He also co-founded Eagles of Death Metal in 1998, playing drums for their studio recordings and occasionally performing live with them. Homme was formerly the co-founder and guitarist of the stoner rock band Kyuss from 1987 to 1995. He has produced a musical improv series with other musicians (mostly from the Palm Desert Scene) known as The Desert Sessions since 1997. He formed a new project in 2009 called Them Crooked Vultures with Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones, releasing their self-titled debut album later that year. In 2016, he produced, co-wrote, and performed on the Iggy Pop album Post Pop Depression. He has also been involved with acts such as Foo Fighters and Arctic Monkeys.\n\nEagles of Death Metal is an American rock band from Palm Desert, California, formed in 1998 by Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme, who are the only permanent members of the band, though Homme rarely plays live shows because of commitments to other bands. There are also a wide range of other musicians that play under the Eagles of Death Metal moniker, both on the albums and in live shows, frequently under humorous aliases. Despite their band name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes stated that a friend was introducing Josh Homme to the death metal genre. When he played a song by the Polish band Vader and made a claim that the song was within the death metal genre, Homme then referred to Vader as \"The Eagles of Death Metal\". After hearing this phrase, he wondered what a cross between the Eagles and a death metal band would sound like. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of \"bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals.\" Jesse Hughes is known for his enthusiastic interaction with audiences at live performances."
