        "text": "Ezra Furman and the Harpoons – Mysterious Power\n\nPosted on April 9, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBand: Ezra Furman and the Harpoons Album: Mysterious Power Release Date: April 5, 2011\n\nWhen I interviewed Ezra Furman in Austin a couple weeks ago, I was surprised by what a nice, unassuming young man he appeared to be. One of my biggest fears when I meet an artist for the first time is they’re going to immediately hate me. Right after that my fear is that they might use the interview as a forum to convey their hatred for Zionists (really happened to a friend of mine).\n\nNothing about our 20-minute conversation on and off camera made me think Ezra was anything but a good guy who happens to be a musician. He didn’t have any of the disdain for the press or quiet prickishness that sometimes goes along with prolific songwriters.\n\nIf you know the person I’m talking about, congratulations. If you don’t, it’s Ryan Adams. I use Mr. Adams here because I think he has a lot in common with Ezra Furman: They both have a ridiculous number of songs written that will most likely never see the light of day, they both write about deeply personal topics, and they’re both in a constantly frustrating battle to become Paul Westerberg.\n\nWith the new album, Mysterious Power, Ezra comes closer than either of them have before. His voice constantly going low to high, trembling. He screams with the best of them on songs like “Hard Time In a Terrible Land,” and he has the sweetness of a little cherub on the title track “Mysterious Power.”\n\nThis song is one of the best title tracks I’ve ever heard. It’s true that generally a title track is considered to be one of the, if not the, strongest tracks, but it goes one step further here. “Mysterious Power” takes the entire record and sums it up in a tad over three minutes. It touches on faith, the ability music has to raise us up, adolescent peculiarity, and happy loneliness.\n\nMysterious Power is an album chock-full of beautifully written songs from one of Chicago’s greatest artists. This is the third Ezra Furman album, and according to our conversation he wants to start recording again as soon as possible. I, for one, can’t wait.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ Ezra Furman and The Harpoons, of Chicago, will be playing a record release party on April 23 at Subterranean with Tristen and The Apache Relay. Tickets are $10.\n\n▪ The Harpoons are: Adam Abrutyn (drums), Andrew Langer (guitar), Job Mukkada (bass) and, well, Ezra Furman (vocals).\n\n▪ You can preview a handful of Mysterious Power tracks on the Harpoons’ Facebook page.\n\nThe Mountain Goats – All Eternals Deck\n\nPosted on April 5, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBand: The Mountain Goats Album: All Eternals Deck Release Date: March 29, 2011\n\nLast week in my review of Heidi Spencer’s debut record Under Streetlight Glow, I spent a good deal of time talking about my love for all things John Darnielle. Unbeknownst to me, The Mountain Goats have a new record that came out the very same day. Makes sense, they’re playing here at The Vic tomorrow night. I should have known it wasn’t just a stroke of good fortune for me.\n\nAll Eternals Deck doesn’t play like the recent releases The Mountain Goats have put out. To use the word disjointed wouldn’t be precise, but it wouldn’t be wrong either. The album was recorded in separate sessions all in different cities. The idea was to keep things fresh and let each city inject itself into the songs. I’m not sure if they were one hundred percent successful in the execution of that plan, but what came out of those sessions is a series of good songs lacking an interlaced theme or overall narrative.\n\nAnd that’s just about the worst thing I can say about this release. Darnielle’s songwriting still comes through as brutally honest and confident. His voice, too nasally for some, is unchanged and glorious. The biggest difference between All Eternals Deck and other Mountain Goats offerings is the music.\n\nI started up with The Mountain Goats at The Sunset Tree, and have stayed with them since. I think I can easily say that a few of these new tracks are the most rocking they’ve ever done. “Estate Sale Sign” and “Great Prowling Cain” are both good examples of this.\n\nIt’s a nice change, but not something I hope is permanent. The strength of The Mountain Goats is and will always be Darnielle’s voice and words. He is the Conor Oberst of every city except Omaha after all, constantly surrounding himself with different musicians. He’s the only true member of The Mountain Goats, and I appreciate everyone else’s hard work, but they could go away and The Mountain Goats would go on without a hitch.\n\nDespite its couple faults, I really enjoy this record. There isn’t anything as good as “This Year” or “Lion’s Teeth,” but I wouldn’t expect there to be. If you’re a fan of the band, you’re gonna like this one. Probably more than Heretic Pride or The Life of the World To Come. If you’ve never listened to The Mountain Goats, don’t start here. Pick up Tallahassee or Sunset Tree and work your way up through the years. I think you’ll find that John Darnielle is a songwriter of the greatest talent.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ The Mountain Goats are based in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n▪ Their album, All Eternals Deck, is now available on iTunes.\n\n▪ The Mountain Goats take the stage tonight at The Vic with special guest Megafun. Tickets are $19 (plus fees).\n\nAryk Crowder @ Double Door (3/31)\n\nPosted on April 1, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nLast night at Double Door Aryk Crowder electrified the stage with his brand of soul-pop. His guitar was on fire all night, and the crowd, though standing far back from the stage, seemed to be into the sounds.\n\nWe got there early for once. Super early, actually. They hadn’t even opened the doors yet. We saw that Aryk wasn’t going to be on until 9:30, so we walked down to feast for a bite to eat. This place has amazing food. If you’re ever in that North/Milwaukee/Damen area, check it out (I had bbq salmon served with hotcakes and an avocado salsa).\n\nAfter that we walked back over and talked to Aryk’s manager, Matt. Super nice guy. We still had about 10-15 before the show was starting, so we chatted about all things breakfast-related. We also talked about LOLcats, but that’s a story for another time.\n\nOnce Aryk got on stage, and played the opening licks from “Ready, Set…” it was apparent that this dude is talented. His band was keeping up with him pretty well, and everyone was tapping their feet and bobbing their heads. A couple people started dancing but stopped when they realized no one was going to join them.\n\nAfter his first “Thank You” of the night, the band launched into two short songs with a nice musical segue in between, which I caught with the trusty Flip camera for your pleasure.\n\nHe played a couple songs off of his acoustic EP which just came out a week ago. Both of them were good, but they slowed things down a bit. All part of the show, of course, because after those he grabbed the next bands singer Anna Solpsis (I think) to join him on a cover of Jimi Hendrix’s “Fire.”\n\nThis got the crowd back into things, and I have to say, it was a good cover. It was marred, however, by the sound system not getting the backup vocals to a level the audience could hear until near the end of the song.\n\nOverall, I think I must stand by my initial comparison to Jonny Lang that I mentioned in my interview with Aryk. They’re both excellent guitarists who sing in a voice that makes them sound much older than they are. The live performance, as usual for an artist who plays this kind of music, is better than the recorded.\n\nAryk’s ability to take off on a solo and return effortlessly is one of the key ingredients in the recipe of good showmanship, and I think he already has most of those components down.\n\nIf you get the chance, check him out at one of his many upcoming shows around north Chicago and Wisconsin. If you don’t get the chance, pick up a copy of his single “Ready, Set…” or his new acoustic EP. He reminds me a lot of why I started digging the blues in the first place: that emotive power of the six-string and soulful vocals that can tear you apart just as quickly as they can get you jivin’ on the dancefloor.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ Upcoming shows include Rock Island Cafe in Neenah, WI on April 9th; Lock Stock And Barrel in Decatur, IL on April 23rd; and Chord on Blues in St. Charles, IL on April 29th\n\n▪ You can pick up the single “Ready, Set…” on iTunes.\n\nSoft Speaker – I’ll Tend Your Garden\n\nPosted on March 31, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nThis may be the most unusual thing I’ve encountered in the months that I’ve been writing for this blog. Taking a page from the rock mythology creation guide of 70′s rockers, Soft Speaker have built an entire universe for themselves in which they exist as ex-pats making it huge in Austria in the 30′s. They’ve crafted an interesting backstory involving a milkmen society, and a cat-selling business that I find both brilliant and humorous for different reasons.\n\nTheir music could not, however, sound less Austrian. It does find some of it’s roots in the UK, though. It’s a gloomier form of pop, to be certain. I’m reminded of bands like Joy Division or Echo and the Bunnymen initially…but then the guitars. They just come at you like a bull. There is some really great work on display here, as Paul Foreman blazes through tracks like “For a Handsome Prince” and “Geronimo’s Only Defense.”\n\nIf I had to peg it down to something, and it will sound completely random and stupid, but I’m completely serious, it would be this: Joy Division meets Blue Oyster Cult, with just a hint of (insert jam band here-for my purposes I’ll say Disco Biscuits because I’ve never written that name anywhere before). I know that seems like an impossible combination, but that’s what I hear.\n\nNormally I would not find that an appealing recipe, but the folks in Soft Speaker are talented enough to keep me listening. They’ve had the good fortune of getting good buzz from the likes of AV Club and my good personal best friend Jim DeRogatis (not true-he does like the band, we are not best friends), and I can see why.\n\nI mentioned the guitars already, but there’s much more to it than that. The vocals are hushed-almost always. I don’t know why they chose to record it that way, but it gives the whole record a kind of mystery that would have been lost if they were brought to the forefront. It’s almost as if Nick Rocchio exists in some other dimension that we can hear but never see.\n\nThere’s a ton of atmospheric production detail to heighten an already pretty out there record, and I can’t really complain about that either. At a few points it feels like maybe something could have been cut out before mastering, but really that’s the artist’s choice, not mine. An example would be “Felician Sisters Convent.” I think the album would be just as good without it. At a little under two minutes, it doesn’t really add anything, and as an instrumental, it doesn’t seem necessary to bridge the gap between “Geronimo’s Only Defense” and “Pagen Pastimes.”\n\n“Pagen Pastimes” may just be my favorite track on this release. Remember a while back when I did a bunch of short capsule reviews of music my friend Jeff gave me? Well this track reminds me a ton of one of the songs off Umberto’s record From The Grave. Especially the beginning, with just the fuzzy guitar and synths. Crazy spooky stuff. And the vocals really pay off on this one, because if it were left an instrumental, I probably would have thought it was a ripoff of that great Umberto album.\n\nAgain, Paul Foreman’ guitar blasts off into outerspace and stays there long enough to give Jupiter a second great red spot.\n\nNow the hard part…do I recommend this album? Yes. It isn’t for everyone, but I think if you like flashy guitar with enough fuzz to start another precinct of the police department, you would dig it a lot. I also think that if you’re a fan of any of the bands I’ve mentioned during this review, you should give I’ll Tend Your Garden a shot.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ Soft Speaker is local to Chicago. The band is comprised of: Blair Douglass (Electric Bass Guitar), Nick Rocchio (Vocals, synths/organ, guitar), Joe Daley (Drums), and Paul Foreman (Guitar, vocals, synths/organ)\n\n▪ The record release show for I’ll Tend Your Garden is Friday at Empty Bottle. Soft Speaker will be playing with Chicago Tunes favorite California Wives.\n\nArtist interview: singer-songwriter Aryk Crowder\n\nPosted on March 30, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nTwo days before his big show at Double Door, Aryk Crowder and I got together at Curio to talk about his new acoustic EP, touring, and his philosophies on music. But there was a woman singing opera when we got there, so we took it to the streets. What came out of it was a good conversation, as well as my first foray into John Wells-ian directing. We covered a lot of ground, both physically and verbally, walking around the River North neighborhood. My apologies for the trains.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ Aryk plays at Double Door on Thursday with Anna Soltys and the Familiar, Kick the Record and Origin of Animal. Tickets are $5 (advance) or $10 (at the door). Show starts at 8:30.\n\nHeidi Spencer and the Rare Birds – Under Streetlight Glow\n\nPosted on March 28, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nThe world of blogging can be a funny one sometimes. I spend an inordinant amount of time each day surfing the web for albums that are coming out or shows that are coming up in our wonderful city. When I’m not doing that, I’m listening to a record someone submitted, or preparing what I’m going to write about a band (you can probably tell this last item is what I spend the least time on). I also spend a good amount of time e-mailing publicists and managers trying to get interviews or tickets to shows.\n\nYou’d be surprised how often I get replies from people enthusiastic to work with us. You may not be so surprised by the amount of people I never hear back from. But often times there is a trade-off. Some people will give you access to something only if you take a look at something else. It’s part of the world we enjoy, so we deal with it. A lot of the time the artist or album is complete crap.\n\nSo, when I sent off my request to see The Mountain Goats on April 5th at The Vic, I wasn’t shocked when I didn’t hear anything for a while. When I did get a response, it wasn’t from the person I had contacted. Tyler was helping Andy out for The Mountain Goats tour, and he was more than happy to oblige my request. Fantastic news because I think John Darnielle is a lyrical genius. His line in the song “This Year” (off of the amazing record The Sunset Tree) that goes “Then Kathy came by and we hung out, trading swigs from the bottle all bitter and clean. Locking eyes, holding hands-Twin high maintenance machines,” is one of my favorites of the past ten or so years.\n\nWell, Tyler had seen on our page that we were going down to SxSw, and he wanted me to check out an artist that was also going to be around, Heidi Spencer and the Rare Birds. There was no pressure, no “If you check these guys out you can go to The Mountain Goats, but if you don’t then go fuck yourself.” Nothing like that. But it’s one of those things that’s understood. So with great tentativeness, I turned on Under Streetlight Glow.\n\nTo my surprise and great delight, it turns out this record is fantastic! It exists in no particular space or time, which makes it exist in any time or space. It has a classic sensability that I find refreshing in a time where everyone wants to be new and exciting. Heidi Spencer and the Rare Birds have crafted an album that will please all music lovers for it’s simplicity and beauty.\n\nListening to the record this morning, I found a comparison that I think will work for a lot of people. This is the album that I wish Fiona Apple had made after her five year hiatus. Not to take anything away from Extraordinary Machine, but I’ve always thought she had a great voice for a bluesier type of music.\n\nThe mood is set for Under Streetlight Glow right off the bat with “Alibi.” The song starts with the line “No one needs to know” and continues to tell a tale of clandestine rendezvous involving two lovers unsure of themselves and each other, but ready to take on the world in the name of love. It’s set against a musical backdrop reminiscent of 1950′s-60′s pop music, and it’s hard not to imagine this track actually coming off a compilation album sandwiched between The Four Seasons and The Marvalettes.\n\nAnother comparison I was making while listening to this record, and I apologize to anyone tired of my using my own musical references to describe my feelings about this album (if you want the bare bones, I dig it and I think you should pick it up when it streets tomorrow), is Mazzy Starr’s “Fade Into You.” I can’t even begin to tell you how much I loved that song when I was younger. I bought the cassette for that one song because Q101 wasn’t playing it nearly enough. I would lay in bed listening and drift off to that elegant, ethereal mix of voice and music constantly, to an almost addictive point.\n\nI get that same kind of feeling listening to Under Streetlight Glow. There is something otherworldly about the vocals that makes it impossible to not float away with the songs. This is never more true than the track “Hibernation.” It may not be the best song on the record lyrically, but the breathy lead vocals and the sweet, haunting backing vocal by Jess Hrobar combine to give it a sound that transcends the genre of folk music or pop music and becomes simple and true and beautiful.\n\nThis may have something to do with the fact that all these songs were written as companions to Heidi Spencer’s films that she was working on in film school. There’s something about song being able to push a story forward when it is accompanied by images that is amazing to behold. Think of a great scene in a movie, and then take the music away. It’s awful. The “Sunshine of Your Love” scene in Goodfellas…take out that song, and Scorsese can’t do much but just let DeNiro stand there like a putz (kidding Marty, please don’t have me killed). But, without the aid of visuals, music can take us to places in our minds that we would otherwise never know of.\n\nIn the just under 40 minutes that Under Streetlight Glow plays, we get transported to a dark, cold Milwaukee where broken hearts are trying to mend and lonely individuals are looking back over their past and trying to move on. Album closer “Whiskey” contains the following lyrics: “I have nowhere to be, Can I come to you please?” A more yearning and desperate cry could not fit this album better.\n\nUnder Streetlight Glow comes out tomorrow, March 29th. I recommend you buy a digital copy for your iPod, and CD for your car, and a cassette or vinyl copy for your parents.\n\nWeekend Roundup (3/25 + 3/26)\n\nPosted on March 27, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nWhat a busy weekend it was for us. There was so much great music happening in Chicago this weekend, it almost felt like we were back in Texas for another round of SxSw fun.\n\nWe started on Friday night at Schuba’s for David McMillin of Fort Frances. He was opening for Ben Ottewell of Gomez, and anyone who was smart enough to get there early witnessed a great show.\n\nI was a big fan of Fort Frances’ album, The Atlas, and it was nice to hear the songs stripped down to their bare bones. David’s voice shown through a little easier in this live setting, but the lack of accompaniment didn’t really change the way I heard the music. Most of Fort Frances’ songs rely heavily on the lyrics, so this solo effort was perfect.\n\nDavid played a new song that I think is gonna really hit big when it comes out. I think he said it was due this summer, but don’t quote me on that. It’s called “I Had Love,” and if I were forced to compare it to something, I would say Joe Pug’s “Speak Plainly Diana.” They aren’t necessarily exact replicas, but the style that I assume will be on display for the track might fit in well with Pug’s relatively rocking song.\n\nI didn’t get that one on video, but I did get a great version of “Ghosts of California.” I really like this song, so here’s a look at the solo version:\n\nAs if that wasn’t good enough to call it a weekend, on Saturday I hit two free shows.\n\nFirst I headed over to Saki Record Store for Holdfast, Island of Misfit Toys, and Warm Ones. I wasn’t able to stay for Warm Ones set, but I got to see some pretty good stuff.\n\nHoldfast impressed me for one big reason-it was unpolished. On the record they put out, which you can stream for free, everything comes off a little bit produced. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but when I hear a band, especially a young up and coming band, I don’t wanna hear a U2 record. Maybe you understand where I’m coming from, maybe not. Either way, I was happy to hear a couple mistakes and some great once-in-a-lifetime takes by everyone in the band.\n\nThe person who impressed me the most was guitarist (Brandon Hunt?). He had a slew of pedals he was working with, and they weren’t always cooperating. All the while he remained completely compelling to watch, and had a couple solos that sounded awesome.\n\nI was a bit concerned when i realized how small the stage area was, but it actually worked to the bands advantage, I think. Due to the small space, I was able to get a pretty good video of the band before the keyboard player from Island of Misfit Toys demanded everyone scoot up close.\n\nI stayed in back for a couple of reasons: One, I had a big heavy coat on and it was already warm enough in there. Two, someone-and I don’t know who-reeked of marijuana and I had to stand far away from them. I don’t wanna sound like a Debbie Downer, but there’s a time and place for it, and it’s not when you’re gonna be squeezed into a studio apartment-sized area with a bunch of people you don’t know.\n\nThey’re set finished up and Island of Misfit Toys started setting up. I knew that they had a large band, but I didn’t realize it was Jon Drake and The Shakes-like. I was wondering if they would be able to fit everyone up there, and they did. Just barely though.\n\nAnthony Sanders opened up with a number that was about even between yelling and singing. He had gum in his mouth, and I was almost positive it was going to fly out of his mouth. Then he sang a line about how the front row at his shows always get spit on, so I relaxed a bit after realizing that this was a common occurence-also I wasn’t in the front row.\n\nI kind of imagine that this show was like the early Commander Venus shows must have been. One guy who writes good songs, and a backup band that does whatever is needed to keep the spotlight on the man in the middle (apologies to Tim Kasher fans). I wasn’t overly impressed with any of it, but I didn’t hate it either. It was just a bit so-so for me.\n\nThe rest of the crowd seemed to dig it, though. It seemed that everyone around me was friends with someone in the band, so it may have just been they wanted to show their support, but they were dancing and everything. Maybe I just don’t get the appeal. That’s very possible. I’ve also never liked Andrew Bird all that much, but he’s pretty well-liked (especially here), so it happens.\n\nI split about halfway through Island of Misfit Toys so that I could get home and eat before we headed out to the third show of the weekend, a Songwriter’s Showcase curated by Gabe Liebowitz of Dastardly, at Cafe Ballou just down the road from Empty Bottle.\n\nIt’s a nice little cafe that is just the right size for such an event. More a workshop than a show, really. Most of the people in attendance were other artists. Here is a list of the people playing:\n\nMaren Celest of Photographers, William James of Teenage Rage, Gabe Liebowitz, Ryan Suzuka, Brendan Losch, and Julie Meckler. I believe Stan from Santah was also playing, but we had to catch our bus before the last act.\n\nThis was the 8th get together that Gabe has put together, and I think it’s great for the Chicago songwriting community to have a place where you can try out new stuff and get an honest response from peers. It seemed that pretty much everything was well-received.\n\nMy favorite song of the night was by Gabe, naturally. His ode to the state of Missouri was beautiful and true. I don’t know how many times I’ve thought of Missouri as a cold and miserable fucker, but it’s too many to count. I thought Julie Meckler was really good, too. I didn’t see the end of her set, but I caught two and a half songs, and I really enjoyed them. Ryan Suzuka’s ukulele and harmonica was also a pleasant change from the guitar strumming that accompanied most talent.\n\nIf you get a chance to check out the next Songwriter’s Showcase, get there. It’s a great way to see some fantastic Chicago artist’s playing stripped down songs, demos basically. I was certainly glad we made it out. Also, the pastries at Cafe Ballou are delicious.\n\nWith the weekend now behind me, I’m glad I can’t say things are slowing down at all. Tomorrow I’m going to check out the Intonation Music Workshop show at Whole Foods in Lincoln Park (1550 N Kingsbury). It starts at 5:30 and it’s free! Then Tuesday we have an interview with singer-songwiter Aryk Crowder, and then Thursday we’re checking out his show at Double Door. Should be a good time.\n\nFree Event on Saturday At Saki!\n\nPosted on March 25, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nHey guys, I just wanted to highlight a free show going on tomorrow at Saki Record Store. A couple bands that are friends of the site will be playing in the afternoon, and it should be an awesome time.\n\nThe show starts at two with Holdfast. They started out at DePaul and have an EP called Like The Sun that I told them I would have reviewed today, but obviously don’t. I have listened to it and I like it, but I haven’t given it enough spins yet to really review. Let’s just say it’s a rock record, and if you enjoy good music, you’ll probably like it. If you’re a fan of either of the next two bands, I’d say check out Holdfast.\n\nPlaying second is Island of Misfit Toys. They’ve been written up enough times that I don’t need to give you my thoughts on their release, but they seem cool. They’re working on their second piece now, and to promote it band leader Anthony Sanders is recording acoustic demos on a 4-track recorder upon request. All you have to do is send him an email asking for one, and he’ll hook you up with 9 original songs and 1 cover. You can request which songs he records for you and everything. It’s a great idea. Ezra Furman tried it with his last release, and came damn close to getting every single one of them done. I think he said 135 out of about 150 or something. Impressive.\n\nHeadlining the bill is Warm Ones. Now, if you’ve read the site here, you know that Eric and I both dig these guys. Particularly Tony Sackett’s stage presence. He just totally has that thing where you just want to watch him to see what he’s going to do next. He’s also taking part in the fantastic series Waxing Nostalgic, which I embarassed myself with yesterday.\n\nIt’s gonna be great and it’s free. Can’t argue with that. Saki is also having a Record Store Day party on April 16th that Chaperone will be playing. But more on that later.\n\nSaki is located at 3716 W Fullerton Ave in Logan Square. The store opens at noon, the show starts at 2 and ends at 5. Come check it out. Even if you end up not enjoying the music, you can grab all those albums you’ve been putting off buying, like Josh Ritter’s So Runs The World Away.\n\nWaxing Nostalgic: Josh Terzino Takes On A Monster Of His Own Creation\n\nPosted on March 24, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nMy artist for this week didn’t have time to help us out, and that’s ok. I’ve decided to take on this behemoth myself. It’s only fair since I’ve been asking people to do it for the past month. Who knows, maybe you’ll learn something about me you didn’t know (favorite food: pizza, favorite color: blue).\n\nWhen I was a kid, it was all about movies for me. Even up in to my late teens, I devoured everything I could, from Scorsese and Tarantino to Walter Hill and Samuel Fuller-I didn’t watch many foreign films until later. I could watch Goodfellas on repeat for a whole day, still could if time permitted.\n\nMusic was always a part of my life, but never something that I thought about on a higher level. My father is a musician who grew up in the 60′s, so there was always a good amount of Beatles and Stones playing. Around the the time I was 15 I started getting into the blues, and he made me a bunch of cassettes to play in my car once I had my license.\n\nLightnin’ Hopkins, Lonnie Brooks, Howlin’ Wolf-all the greats. I’d drive around the small town of LaPorte jamming out on air guitar (while ALWAYS paying strict attention to the road) singing my heart out along with Steve Miller’s “Evil.”\n\nA little while later I met a kid named Kyle. He said he played guitar and I thought that was cool. He was a goofy kid. He didn’t have a lot of friends, and his ability on guitar was not being used by the jazz band at our school. So we started a band called Tax Evasion.\n\nWe played blues covers like “Pride and Joy” and then “Blue on Black” by the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band. I wrote a couple originals that were beyond terrible. Basically the band was a reason to listen to Kyle play guitar. The guy was amazing-and he was only 16!!\n\nWell, as these things tend to happen we split up after a couple months together. Everyone was busy and Kyle felt like he wasn’t spending enough time focusing on his relationship with Jesus or something.\n\nThe next fall I started school at Purdue in W Lafayette, IN. A great school, no doubt, but I had little to no interest in classes. I had better things to do like play video games and go to the rec to shoot around with my friends. What I spent the most time doing was sitting in the computer lab, downloading copious amounts of music from a new thing called Napster that had shot up over the summer.\n\nThe computer labs all had T1 lines, and the amount of space allowed for each student on their servers was ridiculous. So, I’d show up and pretend to be doing some schoolwork, all the while downloading 5-10 albums at a crack and burning them to a cd.\n\nI was downloading everything I could get my hands on. Hip-hop, rock, indie, blues. I didn’t care what it was, I just wanted to hear it. All of it.\n\nI was at Purdue from 99-03. Not enrolled the whole time, but I was there. During that time some amazing albums were released: Bright Eyes-Lifted; or The Story Is In The Soil, Keep Your Ear to The Ground, OutKast’s Stankonia, the debut of The Strokes, and White Blood Cells by the White Stripes. But we’ve made the rule of choosing one album fairly concrete by this point, so I will play the game that I’ve created.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that the album I would choose is Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Chicago’s own Wilco.\n\nThe first time I heard the record was through the recommendation of my friend Jeremy. We kinda shared his space on the Purdue server after I dropped out. I’d go into the lab, log in as him, and go through everything he had downloaded. This was the same way I got turned on to things like The Streets and Har Mar Superstar.\n\nWilco was different, though. It took me to places musically that I had never been. It successfully married the brilliantly poignant lyrics by Jeff Tweedy with the ethereal soundscape created by the late Jay Bennett. The first time I heard “I Am Trying To Break Your Heart” I thought it was the most bizarre, intriguing way to start an album. All throughout there are pieces of other songs from the album. A line here, a note there. It’s a brilliant piece of songwriting and producing.\n\nTweedy and Bennett had a contentious relationship, to say the least. I think that sometimes that kind of thing is necessary to create great music. Just look at Keith and Mick. Somehow they’ve managed to keep it together for forty years, but they’re not hanging out at each others Italian villa.\n\nI’ve listened to YHF countless times. I’ve gone weeks where that’s the only album I listen to. The songs “War on War,” “Jesus, etc,” and “Ashes of American Flags” are maybe the best 4-5-6 lineup of any album ever made. The line “You have to learn how to die if you really wanna be alive” is maybe my favorite line in a song ever. Though, I think Jeff curbed it a bit from Red in Shawshank Redemption.\n\nYHF opened up a lot of doors for me musically that would have otherwise been shut by my own myopic views of music. Surely I could have never enjoyed something like Neutral Milk Hotel’s In The Aeroplane Over The Sea if I didn’t first have Wilco’s masterpiece introduce me to this new world of indie music (though, to be fair, NMH did come out in ’98, I just didn’t know it at the time).\n\nPeople have said some disparaging things about Wilco’s albums since YHF. As if writing another album of that quality would be easy. They are a band constantly experimenting with the formula they use to create music. Whether you like it or not doesn’t really matter to them. The only thing they are interested in is making music that excites them and keeps them wanting to make music.\n\nI personally think that A Ghost Is Born and Sky Blue Sky are both fantastic records. They aren’t AS fantastic as Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but hey, every Dylan album isn’t as good as Blonde on Blonde, ya know?\n\nListening to Wilco has allowed me the opportunity to hear a lot of things that I would have written off entirely otherwise. In particular, country and alt-country music. I grew up in that time when it was changing to crossover garbage, and I didn’t really think about the fact that there were bands out there staying true to the roots of the genre.\n\nSo for that, and for so many other reasons, I thank Wilco for bestowing upon us a record so complete in it’s vision and so beautiful in it’s execution that I could honestly listen to it forever and never grow weary. As a Chicagoan and as a music lover, I am forever indebted to the band that changed my life.\n\nA Final Post on SxSw\n\nPosted on March 22, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nIf you couldn’t tell by my postings thus far, we had a great time at the festival down in Austin. Now that I’m back, and it’s not even close to spring-like, I find myself missing the mucky sweat that covered me for most of my time in Texas.\n\nI thought I’d put together a little compilation of things that we saw down there that we haven’t shown yet. Obviously the interviews were the main draw for us, but there was so much more. If you haven’t had the chance to see any of the interviews yet, click here to find yourself in a treasure trove of information on artists like Ezra Furman, K Flay, and Dastardly–among others.\n\nFirst off, I wanted to throw up these videos of Okkervil River from the Under the Radar party. I don’t know how under the radar these guys are anymore, but I think they rule. The first video is my favorite song that they do, “Unless It’s Kicks.” The second is “Our Life Is Not A Movie, But Maybe.”\n\nAfter that we checked out a great set by Bhi Bhiaman. Unfortunately I did not get any video footage. I DO have some stuff from the Ritter show that followed, but it is currently in a huge file that runs 32 minutes because we just turned on the camera and let it record audio without getting the visual part of the show.\n\nOn Saturday we got up early to make it over to Chaperone‘s showcase performance at The Jackalope. This was a great show, and here’s some video evidence:\n\nAfter that we went and did our interviews, which, again, you can find elsewhere. On our way back to catch Dastardly, I popped in to the bar next door to see Ezra Furman play a couple songs. I was stuck in the back, so the video that I got isn’t great. After the interview he gave me, and listening to his new record, I hardly needed any convincing anyway. Here he is playing the song “We Should Fight” with his band The Harpoons:\n\nThen we moseyed over to the Jackalope to witness the most insanely CF’d set of the fest. Even though they didn’t get to play a real set, it was still fantastic. My favorite part of this video isn’t even the song…it’s Miles from Chaperone screaming the lyrics along with Gabe. “Sometimes I want to tryyyyyyyyyy, but most times I disappear with the blink of an eyyyyyyyyyyyye.” If I had turned the camera just a little bit you would see Shaun doing the exact same. Something about seeing the way these two bands enjoy one another is very heartwarming. I hope that all the bands in Chicago have someone they can rely on as much as these two can on one another.\n\nVideo: The Final Interview from SxSw (The Jezabels)\n\nPosted on March 20, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nWe spent a few minutes with The Jezabels from Australia. Three of the four band members were in attendance, and they were all very nice. A big thanks to them and their tour manager Dave for accommodating our needs and meeting us closer to where we needed to be for the remainder of the day.\n\nBhi Bhiman — Songwriter Extraordinaire\n\nPosted on March 20, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nI just wanted to highlight this guy a bit because I had never heard of him. If any of you reading this knew of him and didn’t tell me, then shame on you!\n\nChcek out his website: Bhi Bhiman then watch these videos.\n\nOver on his MySpace page, which you can link to from his website, he does a cover of one of my favorite songs-”The Killing Moon” by Echo and the Bunnymen\n\nHe won’t be in Chicago anytime soon, but when he arrives, I’ll be there.\n\nAlso, this was a good way to put up some videos while I’m waiting for my stupid internet to load mine.\n\nVideo: Chaperone’s Miles Doornbos interviews Dastardly’s Gabe Liebowitz\n\nPosted on March 20, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nThe 8 minutes that this video runs are a testament to the glory that is Miles’ interviewing skills. I love the way these guys play off each other. Chaperone and Dastardly should be seriously nervous about these two starting a comedy act. Hilarious stuff.\n\n‘I’m As Mad As Hell, And I’m Not Gonna Take It Anymore’\n\nPosted on March 20, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nIf you’re familiar with that Peter Finch line from the fantastic movie Network, you may get a kick out of Miles’ interview with Gabe from Dastardly following their set at The Jackelope. To understand the situation, let me explain:\n\nReggie’s Rock Club was throwing this showcase down here at SxSw that they had put together for Chicago bands. Chaperone led off, and it was all Chicago for seven hours. But, one band went long…WAY long. Long enough that they had to completely cancel one band’s set. Then, by the time Dastardly was to go on, they were told they would only have 15 minutes.\n\nNow, a 15 minute set isn’t unheard of, but when you’re basically the headliner for a particular bill, you should get more than 15 minutes. And it probably wouldn’t have been so bad were the people taking over from Dastardly a band of equal or better quality, but it wasn’t. It was freaking speed metal. So, naturally Gabe was a little upset, and we used it to our benefit for the interview we had lined up for him.\n\nI think the interview came out great. Gabe and Miles riff off each other really nicely. They should take their act on the road during breaks from their bands. I won’t spoil a lot of the jokes for you, but they involve feces and phallic imagery for the most part.\n\nI did manage to get over to where Ezra Furman and the Harpoons were playing. I grabbed one video, which I will try to put up tomorrow. I have so many videos backlogged right now, it may take me until after we get back to Chicago.\n\nEzra was a fun performer. I missed the first 10 minutes of the set, but was able to catch the last four songs. He’s a really talented songwriter, and I was impressed with his stage presence. After the interview we did, I wasn’t sure how he’d be in front of a large group. Turns out he was just as good at performing. Felt kinda weird to be one of the only people in the room that knew the last song that he played, but it was a good one off his new record, Mysterious Power. If you couldn’t tell from our interview, I think you should pick it up.\n\nAfter the interview we decided to head over to Central Presbyterian Church where Sharon Van Etten was playing at 8:30 and Rural Alberta Advantage at 10:30.\n\nThe church was gorgeous. Equal to St David’s, where we spent Friday night seeing Josh Ritter, maybe even nicer. Sharon Van Etten put on a so-so performance for me. She has a good voice, and a few of her songs are very well-written while others meander and never make it to a point. The two guys that she plays with, a drummer and bass player, both performed admirably. They didn’t have much to do, though.\n\nA bizarre 12-member Christian rock band called Typhoon played between Sharon and Rural Alberta Advantage. Though I didn’t enjoy the music as much as a super religious person might, I did think that for the number of people on stage, the band was amazingly tight. They had three drummers, two violinists, a cellist, two trumpeters, and a keyboardist to go along with the rhythm and lead guitars and bass. They hail from Portland, and something about them gives me the feeling they are all related somehow.\n\nRural Alberta Advantage killed it at the 10:30 set. Apparently the venue was the same one they had played in 2009 as their first SxSw show, so they already had a fondness for the crowd. There was a good mix of old and new material played throughout the night. Most of the new songs played erased, for the most part, any faults I found with the new record, Departing.\n\nOverall Saturday has been my favorite day. Even though we didn’t get to shake hands with Man-God Josh Ritter today. We got to see some great Chicago bands, as well as watch Chaperone screaming the words along with Dastardly’s “Exercises In Self Loathing.” Made me proud to be a Chicagoan seeing that much love between two bands.\n\nTomorrow (later today) we are interviewing White Mystery and Netherfriends. Should be a good time. AND we get to sleep in, which is awesome!!\n\nI apologize for not putting links in to these SxSw posts. When I get back into town I’ll update these with those links like I’d normally have. It’s just that I’m trying to get these done as quickly as possible, so linking isn’t a priority. Besides, you guys (and gals) are smart. Google it if you have a question on something.\n\nCamera Mishaps and Fun With Friends\n\nPosted on March 19, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nSo I’m sitting in the press suite right now, after realizing that my camera is just about out of juice and hoping to whatever it is I believe in that I can grab enough power out of this provided MacBook to last the rest of the night.\n\nOur day started off really awesome. We headed over to The Jackelope, which is the most unsavory bar I’ve ever been inside. Chaperone was leading off the Reggie’s Showcase, and they were freaking awesome.\n\nI don’t know if it’s the freedom of being outside the city you call home, or the streets being flooded with every kind of beer you can imagine for free, but there was something looser about the set today. Shaun Paul was screaming his head off, Miles went so crazy his guitar came unplugged and I had to grab it and hand it to him, and even Mark Sheridan was getting into things. Well, as much as Mark can.\n\nStanding in the audience with us were members of Dastardly and Gina Bloom with her band The Congregation. Nice to see Chicago bands supporting one another, even if it means having to hang out at The Jackelope.\n\nAfter that we headed over a block to do an interview with Australian quartet The Jezabels. They were minus one member for our chat, but the three that were with us were all very nice and they give a good interview.\n\nStill kind of trying to get over the awesomeness that was Josh Ritter last night, and the fucking amazing show that Okkervil River put on in the afternoon. I looked at their website today and found out they’re touring for their new record with Titus Andronicus…and NOT stopping in Chicago!!!! I was livid. They’re playing Omaha, Minneapolis, Detroit, but not the music capital of the midwest?? I don’t know if I’ve ever been more disappointed in a band’s touring itinerary.\n\nWhile the camera is charging I’m enjoying the air conditioning and free water, as well as the free MacBook I’m using. Free stuff is everywhere down here. We just hit a party that Shawn Fogel of The Golden Bloom and Neutral Uke Hotel was playing and we scored free hot sauce, some drink called iChill, and a stand for your iPhone or iPod touch.\n\nTonight we have some big ambitious plans, and we’ll see if they come to fruition. I’m a tad skeptical that we will accomplish everything we came down here for, but part of me thinks we will get through it. Gabe from Dastardly seems to think we will, so I’ll start looking through his rose-colored glasses.\n\nNext door to the Jackelope Ezra Furman is playing a show that the Greenhornes are headlining. We might try to check it out since it’s right next to where we want to be. Hopefully my camera will be full by then.\n\nKari’s taken to shooting all our pictures in black and white. They look awesome, of course. We’ve got some really good ones. The venue Josh Ritter played last night really lent itself to being photographed.\n\nWe’re having an awesome time down here. The shuttle has been super convenient for the most part and the people here, even though there’s like a million of them, have all been really nice (except for the tech guy at the Jackalope who knocked Shaylah’s stuff on the ground and then was upset that it was in his way).\n\nIf I were to make one recommendation to anyone coming to SxSw, but not covering it for a website, would be to skip getting the wristband. It’s fairly worthless for the price that you pay. So far we’ve gone to two shows that would have cost us money if we didn’t have them. Otherwise there is so much free stuff going on that you could literally have an entire fest for free if you know someone to stay with.\n\nNext year we will play it a bit smarter if we decide to return.\n\nWhat About The Interviews?\n\nPosted on March 19, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nSo here are the interviews we did yesterday. The first one is conducted by Miles from Chaperone. Seriously, he did an awesome job and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as we did:\n\nSecond up, we headed over to Cedar Door to interview a really nice Canadian duo called Imaginary Cities. Went off on a bit of a tangent when we found out one half of the band is also in The Weakerthans. As you’ll remember our first installment of Waxing Nostalgic, written by Miles, was about Fallow by that very same band.\n\nSorry I haven’t been able to keep my promise of getting these up almost immediately, but it is a ridiculous task unless you have a headquarters in Austin. Or a hotel with internet faster than the 56K modem I had back in ’97.\n\nToday is Chicago day. We are headed over to the Reggie’s Showcase at the Jackalope where bands like Chaperone, Dastardly, The Congregation and more will be hitting the stage.\n\nWe will be taking a short break from that venue to interview a band from Australia called The Jezabels. We also hope to get into Rusty Sparks to see Shawn Fogel of The Motion Sick and Neutral Uke Hotel perform a show at 2:30.\n\nI’m So Excited I’m Shaking\n\nPosted on March 18, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nSo I’m sitting here at St. David’s Historical Sanctuary in Austin, Texas. We got here about an hour and a half ago, and when we arrived, Josh Ritter was doing his soundcheck. It was awesome. I mean, seriously it was like watching a whole solo set almost.\n\nAfterward we were hanging in the foyer waiting to be allowed entrance into the stage area, and Josh Ritter appeared from the back. Impulsively I shouted his name. He may have assumed that I was a stalker (not entirely wrong), but he smiled and shook my hand anyway. He looked down and saw Kari, jaw on the floor, gazing up in awe. He gave her a big grin and lowered his hand to shake hers.\n\nIt was a moment that superfans like us never forget. He asked if we were gonna stay for the show, and I told him that because he was playing, we would stay for the whole show. He said thanks, and walked away. Headed down the stairs he looked and said, “See you guys later on.” What a great fucking guy.\n\nEarlier in the day we did an interview conducted by Miles of Chaperone. Andrew Belle came off as a really nice guy, and Miles did a bang up job. I might have to ask him if he wants to join us full-time.\n\nWe also caught up with Canadian duo Imaginary Cities. The interview got a little noisy toward the end, but they seem like interesting folks. Their debut album Temporary Resident is available on iTunes Canada, and will be available here shortly. You can also grab it from their website.\n\nBoth those videos will be up later tonight, I hope. The internet in Austin is a funny thing.\n\nAfter the interviews, we headed over to see Okkervil River. They only got to play for thirty minutes because everyone else ran long. Apparently the headlining band of a show during the day gets no say in the matter.\n\nRegardless, they rocked. I had never seen them live, but they’ve been creeping up the ranks of my favorite bands. They played my two favorites, “Unless It’s Kicks” and “For Real.” They also played a few of the new songs, all of them awesome.\n\nIt’s so freaking hot down here. We stopped in a sports bar to watch some basketball and I had something called a Frito Pie…If you’ve ever had a Buffrito, you know how delicious that is.\n\nThat’s it for now. I’m uploading these videos at the church we are sitting in, so hopefully their internet is better than our hotels.\n\nMore at the end of the night.\n\nVideo: Interviews with k.flay, Ezra Furman\n\nPosted on March 18, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nSo here are the videos that I promised to have up yesterday. Again, my apologies to K Flay and Ezra. The plan was to have these up within an hour after the interviews, but sometimes the internet has a funny way of throwing a wrench into things like this.\n\nHad a lot of fun with both of them, and I look forward to talking to Imaginary Cities at 1 and Andrew Belle with Miles at 2 today. Hopefully the internet at the Center is better than it is at the Hampton Inn (but the Hampton Inn does have free breakfast AND fresh cookies throughout the day).\n\nAlso, if you’re ever super-tired, I recommend getting about 11 hours of sleep. That’s what I got and I feel much better now.\n\nRunnin’ On Empty; the SxSw coverage continues\n\nPosted on March 17, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nYou know that feeling you get when you’re sick? The one where everything is super heavy and you feel like you’re moving in slow motion? That’s how I feel right now.\n\nMy fingers barely want to move enough to type these words, and my eyes can’t really see, so I apologize for any spelling mistakes.\n\nWe actually had what I think were two really good interviews. K Flay answered my questions like a champ even though I was a bit rambly (which I blame on the not sleeping). And Ezra Furman was as sweet and accommodating as one could ask. As soon as the videos are done uploading to YouTube, I will embed them up here. The internet here at the Hampton Inn is effing ridiculous. So it may be the next SxSw before that happens.\n\nTomorrow we have a couple cool interviews to do. A Canadian group approached us about hooking up, so we decided to play along. I’ve always considered Toronto to be the Chicago of the far north anyway. After that Miles from Chaperone will be interviewing singer/songwriter Andrew Belle.\n\nAndrew splits time between Nashville and Chicago, and I think he’s known much better in the Nashville area than Chicago, so hopefully we can change that after you see the interview.\n\nStill can’t believe I walked right past Josh Ritter and didn’t say anything. IDIOT!!!\n\nSadly, I think I’m going to fall asleep any minute. I promise I’ll do better tomorrow.\n\nWelcome to Austin…\n\nPosted on March 17, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nWell, so far we are off to not the best of starts. Last night one of our cats got sick and we hung out at the Vet ER until 2:30 in the morning. Since we had to leave our apartment at 6 to catch our flight, we decided not to sleep.\n\nThe flight and all that was fine, we made it on time and everything. Once we got here, though, it was completely effed.\n\nWhen we walked into the Austin Convention Center, it was fairly empty. Still is. We went into the registration area which resembled, slightly, an Abbot and Costello routine. Once we finally got our wristbands, the guy at the door to the elevator to get to Josh Ritter told us we couldn’t go up because we didn’t have the right pass. We did walk right past him though. He was chatting up some folks so we didn’t bother him. More with him tomorrow.\n\nAfter waiting outside for half an hour to catch a shuttle to our hotel so we could drop off our luggage, we decided to head back in. We conned our way up into the Press Suite by dropping some names, and right now I’m waiting for K Flay to pop in for a quick interview.\n\nIt’s getting hot out here in Austin. I need a bed if I’m gonna make it through the rest of the day. Hopefully these interviews will go well and we can start turning things around.\n\nHeadshadow – Los Atlantis EP\n\nPosted on March 13, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nI’ve been working hard to get as much done before we take off for Austin Thursday, and with shows tomorrow and Tuesday night, I haven’t left myself a whole lot of time. The band Headshadow sent in their stuff a while back, and I told them I’d give it a listen. This was made fairly easy by the fact that it only includes four songs.\n\nAnother reason I wanted to do this today is because I’ve been listening to it, and I can’t get the lead track “I Don’t Want To Be In Love” out of my gord. I swear it’s a cover, but for some reason I can’t think of who sings the song I think they’re covering.\n\nDespite that conundrum, I dig the tune quite a bit. The sound acts as a kind of time vortex for me. In their bio they list their influences as being 90′s luminaries Weezer and Nada Surf, as well as Jack White’s first offshoot, The Raconteurs. What I hear, mostly, is other bands with similar musical interests who weren’t on the level with the bands mentioned.\n\nHeadshadow appears to be most interested in a kind of punk/pop sound that reminds me of late 90′s early 00′s TRL favorites Good Charlotte or Blink-182. Now, I never liked either of those bands. Regardless of their overwhelming popularity, shitty music is what it is. These guys in Headshadow are better than that, I’m just using that genre as a comparison.\n\nThe second track, which is the title-track “Los Atlantis,” doesn’t stray far from the first one. It does have a nice R.E.M. guitar jangle at the opening that I feel is a nice touch. Beyond that, though, the song keeps in line with “I Don’t Want To Be In Love.” This song is, surprisingly, my least favorite of the four. It isn’t terrible or anything, but it tries to hard to be aggressive, and they get lost somewhere in Buckcherry country.\n\nThey don’t stay there for long, though. On the third track, “Just Bring You” they create a slow burn that touches more on 70′s era classic rock and blues. A nice variance from the rest of the EP. The guitar work on this song is really great. The format of the song allows for some flashier moves on the ax, and Chris Kayes takes full advantage of the moment.\n\nWhen we get to the final track, “It Ain’t Over Yet,” we go back to the punk roots and get a song not unlike what you may hear on a NOFX album. That brand of punk/pop I really do enjoy, and this one is no different.\n\nIt’s hard to judge a band by four songs, but it’s becoming more and more popular for bands to release a full EP instead of a single, which is nice because you get more music. It’s also awful because you get enough of a taste to get a real impression, but not enough to see the whole picture.\n\nFrom what I hear, I like it. Even the song I didn’t think was all that great still had enough redemptive qualities to get a pass from me. I say pick up the EP. It’s only $4. Seeing how I almost paid $16 for an Import of Erasure’s single “A Little Respect,” $4 is a steal.\n\nExtras:\n\nHeadshadow is made up of three Midwest transplants: Chris Kayes-Vocals, Guitar; Thomas Hilliard-Bass; Adam Bowling-Drums\n\nYou can purchase Los Atlantis from the band’s website for $4\n\nApril 20th Headshadow will be performing at Martyr’s and on June 18th they will be at the Abbey Pub.\n\nDastardly – May You Never…\n\nPosted on March 10, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nMy sincerest apologies to Drew. I told him I would have this by last Friday when Dastardly was playing their free show at Reggies. That concert served as a fundraiser to send some bands down to SxSw. Dastardly will be there, we will be there-it’s a perfect fit. Also, May You Never is now available on iTunes, so the timing didn’t work out too bad.\n\nSometime in the last twenty years or so country music took a gigantic leap backward. Certainly Shania Twain can’t be held responsible for all of it, but she’s probably the most notable culprit. After years of being a respectable musical genre, the fatcats working the books at country music record companies decided it would be better if they were more mainstream and had crossover appeal. One “Any Man of Mine” later and the genre took off like a rocket.\n\nThe guys and gals that made country music great-Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Connie Smith, Dale Evans-they couldn’t be too pleased with the direction the form has taken.\n\nBut there is hope, Chicago. Dastardly has put out an EP that is wholly new and original, while paying solemn tribute to the forbearers of the genre. Maybe they don’t even consider this country music. Perhaps they just call it indie because that’s the hip thing to do. But let me tell all you beautiful people, it’s country music, and it’s fucking brilliant.\n\nNow, there are a lot of bands who have sort of kicked off this true country music revival over the past few years. Mumford & Sons is the most popular right now (ESPN was using “Little Lion Man” in a commercial, so I know they’re popular. I also realized The Zutons were the biggest band in the world when Fox Sports used the song ”Pressure Point” during a NFC Conference Championship commercial). The Avett Brothers, Old Crow Medicine Show, even one of my favorites The Felice Brothers have been bringing it back slowly and surely. Bluegrass music, especially, has seen a huge rise in popularity, mainly due to a lot of British bands and legendary American comedians (just one, actually-STEVE MARTIN!).\n\nBut there’s something about Dastardly’s take that makes them better than those bands for me. It’s just a brutally honest record that they’ve put out. The musicianship is amazing. I don’t know where they wrote these songs, but in my mind they were in a cabin nestled away in the Smoky Mountains, sitting on the porch, probably on rocking chairs-no shoes on of course.\n\nI totally get why Dastardly and Chaperone dig each other’s music. They both have their own way of doing things, but there is an underlying feeling of Appalachia behind almost every song. The two bands have played on the same bill multiple times, and I’ve only been luck enough to catch it once. If you see their names next to one another on whatever website you use to get your concert info, do yourself a favor and check it out.\n\nGetting back to May You Never…It’s seven tracks long (not nearly long enough), and each song is great in it’s own way. My favorite of the EP is the closer, “Traffic.” It’s the only track that doesn’t sound terribly Appalachian. It actually sounds like it could have been written in southern Texas after a long trip to Tijuana. It’s a reflective song that doesn’t paint the main character in such a great light:\n\nWell I was born in traffic I’m attracted to slow moving obstacles Empty bottles and prophalactics But am I attractive Should I breathe in the chemicals Man I just hope I don’t fuck it up this time\n\nThe song provides the perfect end for a record that is both funny and self-aware while remaining musically engaging. They lyrics are great, the harmonies between lead singer Gabe Liebowitz and Sarah Morgan are fantastic throughout, and it leaves you feeling satisfied like you’ve just had Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAs I stated at the top, May You Never is now available on iTunes. Do yourself a big favor and pick it up now.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ Dastardly is local to Chicago. The band is comprised of: Gabe Liebowitz-Guitar and Vocals; Sarah Morgan-Accordion, Percussion, Vocals; Patrick Lyons-Guitar, Pedal Steel, Mandolin, Vocals; John Humbracht-Guitar, Banjo, Lap Steep, Dobro, Vocals; August Sheehy-Bass, Vocals; Andy Taylor-Drums\n\nOn top of playing at SxSw, Dastardly also has a slew of shows coming up in Chicago: April 1 at Uncommon Ground, April 6 at Beat Kitchen, April 16 at Reggie’s Record Breakers.\n\nThe Joy Formidable – The Big Roar\n\nPosted on March 9, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nWith South By Southwest quickly approaching, and my time to listen and evaluate things before all the fun begins dwindles, I’ve decided to run this even though the album doesn’t drop for another week and I didn’t ask permission from anyone to go early with it.\n\nI doubt anyone would mind, though, since I have nothing but good things to say about The Joy Formidable‘s newest release, The Big Roar. If you were a fan of last years A Balloon Called Moaning EP, then you will enjoy this thoroughly. Mainly because almost every song from that EP is included on this disc, but also because the newer songs seem to take a step directly from the overall feel of that record.\n\nOf the new additions, “I Don’t Want To See You Like This” is the obvious choice for best song. I really enjoyed it when they played that one at Schuba‘s back in November, and fully realized with production it’s fantastic.\n\nThe new album also allows for Rhydian to sing a bit more. He’s the featured vocalist on the track “Llaw=Wall,” and it adds a nice contrast to the rest of the album that mostly features Ritzy Bryan on lead vocals with Rhydian drifting in and out of the background.\n\nOther than that, the album is almost exactly what I’ve come to expect from TJF. Lots of in-your-face guitars and bass. Effects all over the place on the stringed instruments and on the vocals. I remember being quite surprised seeing them live and hearing them be able to just about pull off the sound of their recording on stage. Phil Specter would be proud to hear the ridiculous wall of sound this band creates.\n\nThe most surprising thing about The Big Roar is the drumming of Matt Thomas. On a lot of A Balloon Called Moaning, his percussion is drowned in the production, but here he is brought to the forefront on almost every track. He provides a constant (like Desmond and Daniel Faraday) for the band to fall back on when Ritzy and Rhydian are going crazy, reaching for the stars while Matt’s feet are firmly on the ground.\n\nSo, if you liked the original release from The Joy Formidable, I’d definitely suggest grabbing this one. It’s a fuller, more nuanced version of the EP. The songwriting is improved on the new songs, but that was never an issue with these Welsh rockers.\n\nI Have No Title For This Post\n\nPosted on March 8, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nIn my efforts to keep this blog updated daily, I’ve missed a lot of things that I probably should have caught a long time ago. To those of you still waiting on your music to be reviewed, I assure you, it will happen. To anyone who hasn’t sent in their music for fear that it will just get backlogged behind major releases by bands like R.E.M.; first of all, they ARE R.E.M. after all, of course they rank higher than you. Secondly, I will get to you as soon as I can, just be patient. Don’t send me reminder emails every two days. Sometimes they are funny, but usually they just remind me of how far behind I am, then I stew in a funk and don’t listen to anything because I feel bad for the bands I’m NOT listening to.\n\nAnyway, in an effort to catch up on a bunch of stuff that I missed in 2010, my friend Jeff put together a little portable hard drive full of music I hadn’t heard. I will go through some of that lengthy list with you here now. I am leaving off a few things that I truly did not care for.\n\nFirst off, Rangda’s album False Flag. Mind-blowingly good free-form experimental rock n’ roll. I never got into bands like Explosions In the Sky because a lot of times I get bored with instrumental music. This is not the case with Rangda. The group is made up from some pretty legendary cats-Richard Bishop from Sun City Girls, Ben Chasny from Six Organs of Admittance, and drummer Chris Corsano. This record seriously kept me intrigued the entire length, and then again and again. Great stuff.\n\nGonjasufi-A Sufi and a Killer: This album caught me offguard. It starts off with some kind of tribal drumming, transforms into a strange hip-hop funk instrumental, then turns itself into the newest incarnation of the blues. And that’s just the first three tracks. This guy has been making music on the west coast since the 90′s, but I never heard of him until now. This album is crazy, but in a good way.\n\nGolden Retriever-S/T: The Portland-based duo of Matt Carlson and Jonathan Sielaff don’t make it easy to love their music. It’s slow and it meanders quite a bit. One thing that I thought of while listening to it, though, is that it would have been a great soundtrack to a 70′s film like Chinatown or The Conversation. It has a very classic feel without ape-ing anything from another era. It is wholly original, and I ended up liking it much more than I thought I would.\n\nBare Wires-Seeking Love: This album is a lot of fun. Last month I reviewed Smith Westerns album Dye It Blonde, and that has a lot of sunny 60′s pop references. This album is very similar, just switch out the 60′s pop for 70′s AM radio. The attitude seethes out of the speakers. Quick listen, too.\n\nThe Art Museums-Rough Frame EP: This record came out just about a year ago. It quickly joined the ranks of great albums that are new, but made to sound old. The harmonies are surprisingly solid for a duo trying to be not-so-great. It’s like She and Him if Zooey Deschanel was a dude, and they refused to use instruments made after 1965.\n\nJack Rose-Luck In The Valley-Released two months after his death in December 2009, this album presents Jack Rose at the top of his game. Playing a mixture of Country/Western and ragtime, Luck In The Valley is a beautiful ode to Appalachia. Jack was a super talented guitarist who understood the history of guitar music and didn’t dare repeat it. This record stands as a testament to both Jack’s ability as a guitarist and the idea that music of this nature can thrive in a music industry that continues its decline into sub-mediocrity being led by talentless hacks that don’t know how to play any instrument but a publicist.\n\nMoon Duo-Escape: I knew nothing about Moon Duo when I pushed play, but knowing the other albums I’d heard from the list above, I did have certain expectations. This took me by surprise a little, though. Not just because I liked it, but because it was SO well done that I listened to it a few times in a row just for the hell of it. Escape does have kind of a creepy vibe, which apparently is it’s own genre of music. Which leads me to the final album I’ll list today…\n\nUmberto-From the Grave: When Jeff described this to me one day, sitting on the 3rd floor of the Chase building downtown, it sounded unbelievably weird. Fashioning itself as a kind of lost soundtrack to the Italian horror film Pieces, Matt Hill has created an amazing album that could certainly play juxtaposed with any horror film. I’m surprised he hasn’t been hired by Dario Argento to score his next film. You can totally sense everything that would be going on in this fake movie, from the fog-laden sidewalks to the shriek-inducing fakeout scares…it is, quite literally, a brilliant record.\n\nThat’s it for now. A lot of ramblin’ going on here. Tomorrow I’ll try harder to get something a bit more in-depth than these surface reviews. Happy listening to anyone who clicks on the album names and checks them out. Good stuff all around.\n\nR.E.M. – Collapse Into Now\n\nPosted on March 7, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nIt seems like every few years R.E.M. puts out a new record and it is met with the same ridiculous praise from some idiot critic: “Finally a return to CLASSIC R.E.M.” It isn’t always the same critic, but it is always the exact same amount of horseshit.\n\nI’ve been a R.E.M. fan for a long time. Their first EP, Chronic Town (of which I have an original vinyl pressing), came out when I was one. The first album I heard by them in full was Green thanks to a music subscription to BMG my dad had. I’ve loved them since the first time I saw the video for “Stand” on MTv way back when that was a station that played videos (kids, a music video is a piece of art created by musicians and videographers for play on television to promote a song or album. In a retro move, Lady Gaga and Beyonce teamed up in one-Oh the memories!). Ever since then I haven’t really had a sour word for them. I would certainly never say that a return to form or anything like that were necessary. R.E.M. always has been, and always will be, the same band I fell in love with as a youngster.\n\nNow, that isn’t to say they haven’t made some crap albums. I haven’t really liked anything they’ve put out since Reveal (on my birthday) back in 2001. In fact, the last album they put out that I really loved was Automatic For the People. That album was fantastic in 1992, and it is equally great now. Since then, the band has gone through changes, including Bill Berry leaving the band.\n\nHaving lost their drummer, the backbone of the band, R.E.M. went through a long period where they were trying to find themselves again. They tried a lot of different things. On their album Around The Sun they even included some hip-hop in the form of Q-Tip performing on the track “The Outsiders.”\n\nTheir most recent release, Accelerate, found the band going back to their earlier music for influence. It was a decent album, but was missing a connection to the audience that made those great records so vital for the college radio fans in the 80′s and early 90′s.\n\nAnd now (well, tomorrow) R.E.M. deliver us an album that brings personal songs and some monster guitars and guest artists that reminds me a lot of the album Monster. No. It’s not a return to classic R.E.M., it’s a return of a band that has found their voice again. CLASSIC R.E.M. never left, it was just buried beneath a huge stack of issues they had to work through to get back to basics.\n\nThe songwriting on Collapse Into Now is some of the best Stipe has done in a long time. It’s less political than some of their more notable work has been known for, but that leaves a lot of room for songs about personal evolution, yearning, and love. Stipe’s words never hit harder than in the song “That Someone Is You,”\n\nThat someone is you That someone is you That someone has pulled me up and out of cartoon quicksand Pulled me up and out of me!\n\nCollapse Into Now is not a great R.E.M. record. Of course, a halfway decent R.E.M. record is leaps and bounds better than most of what gets put out these days. So in that respect, this is highly recommended. People who are fans of the early albums, but turned off by some of the more recent work will, I think, enjoy this more than any R.E.M. record in the past decade.\n\nAnd for that critic is waiting in the wings, ready to shout from the rooftop that “CLASSIC R.E.M. IS BACK!!!” please don’t. If you were a fan of the band, you would know that they never left. Maybe you just need to grow up like they have.\n\nExtras:\n\nCollapse Into Now drops tomorrow, March 8th. Pre-Order at Amazon or on iTunes.\n\nFort Frances – The Atlas\n\nPosted on March 5, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nI said in a post recently that I find it funny when a band or artist sends in their material for review (which I am grateful for) and leaves a note saying that they’re this or that. I like it best when a band says that they’re big influences were majorly epic records. With Fort Frances, and their new record The Atlas, that influence was Wilco, with an emphasis on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\n\nIt’s way funnier when a band is way off. On The Atlas, Fort Frances does make a real connection with some aspects of YHF. Mainly I find it in the quiet spaces between the folk-pop verses and somewhat Beatles-esque refrains. There’s a good deal of sonic dissonance at work in the background almost always.\n\nWith Sam Kassirer behind the knobs and the keys, it’s no surprise that a lot of the songs keep in line with the folkiness of Sam’s major collaborator (and one of my personal favorites of all-time) Josh Ritter. There’s even a moment during “If The Ocean Runs Dry” that reminds me so much of Ritter’s “Wait For Love” that I forgot which album I was hearing.\n\nThat combination of Wilco and Josh Ritter actually reminds me of another band, one that I think is a more fitting comparison to Fort Frances. Minneapolis-based alt-country legends The Jayhawks perfected a lot of what this album shoots for years ago with their album Rainy Day Music (a perfect fit for the weather as I write this).\n\nThe Atlas is definitely more pop than Rainy Day, but I think they share a lot of common musical influences. Fort Frances singer David McMillin has a voice that isn’t entirely reminiscent of Gary Louris or Mark Olson, but in the harmonies and overdubs, there’s definitely a sonic similarity.\n\nI’ve listened to The Atlas a bunch of times now, and my overall impression is that I like it. There’s a lot going on at every turn it takes, eventually leading each song to the same point. Aaron Kiser does a great job of keeping everything moving forward, and Jeff Piper on bass is on point in every song.\n\nStandout songs from the record are “The Ghosts of California” and “Falling Down.”\n\n“Ghosts” is, perhaps, the simplest song on The Atlas. But, in it’s simplicity, it also contains a lot of honesty and longing:\n\nBuild us a home made for heroes Build us a boat to find the stars Watch the hillsides burn, the saddest kind of sunset Now the tide is crying, now we can’t escape these scars\n\n“Falling Down” would be the most radio-friendly song on the album. It’s kind of a hybrid of the better stuff Coldplay does and David Gray. If you download and dig the album, this track would make a good introduction to play for your friends.\n\nIf The Atlas is anything, it’s a piece to be shared. It’s supposed to act as an actual atlas, with each song pointing to places that share a common directional threat. For what it’s worth, you don’t have to be conscious of this fact while you’re listening. The album works perfectly well on the surface. But, if you want to go deeper, you will be rewarded for paying attention.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ Sign up for the Fort Frances mailing list via Facebook and get a free download!\n\nThe Rural Alberta Advantage – Departing\n\nPosted on March 4, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nBy Josh Terzino\n\nThe new release from The RAA picks up basically where Hometowns left off. Nils is still writing and singing about loss, or the fear of loss, and loneliness. Paul Banwatt is still making his case as one of the best drummers working today (Canadian or otherwise). And Amy Cole is still providing solid keyboard work and backing vocals that haunt and delight, sometimes both at once.\n\nSo what’s different? First off, there’s a surprising leap in the confidence level on display. Where most bands would play safe on their second release, trying to avoid the “sophomore slump,” the RAA push full-steam ahead. They don’t use the sound from their previous record as a crutch. Bands do this all the time. The biggest culprit I can think of offhand was The Strokes on Room On Fire. I still like that record, but much of it feels like a ripoff of Is This It?\n\nDeparting is also a far more polished record. One of the charms of Hometowns is that it sounds like it was recorded in a living room. That’s great for a small band trying to get their name out there. Once you’ve established yourself, people expect more. I think this release sounds really great, and I regret not buying the vinyl bundle that was offered on the Paper Bag Records website.\n\nAs I said, the lyrics on Departing don’t stray too far from something you might hear on Hometowns. The words are strong on both records, though. Some of my favorites from the new release appear in the lead track, “Two Lovers“:\n\nAnd if I fly away to the coast, Your face it haunts me more than most\n\nAnd if I ever hold you again, I’ll hold you tight enough to crush your veins\n\nAnd you will die and become a ghost And haunt me til my pulse also slows\n\nIt isn’t just the lyrics that make “Two Lovers” such a good song, it’s also the way it’s sung. The phrasing and emotion that Nils uses really helps the song become something more than just another lamentation of missed opportunity.\n\nThe last big difference on Departing is the lack of some slower material. The album closes with the song “Good Night,” which they’ve been playing at the end of shows for a while now. Perfect song to end on, by the way. Other than that, “North Star” is the only other track I would call a slow number. Hometowns featured a few ballad-like tracks and an acoustic song.\n\nOverall, I think Departing is a great follow-up to one of my favorite records of the past few years. I’ve listened to Hometowns a ridiculous number of times, so it will be nice to have some more RAA to dig into when I get the urge.\n\nIf you’re anything like me and love Rural Alberta Advantage’s first album, you’ll love this one. It’s available now through their website, on iTunes, and Amazon. You could also go to a brick-and-mortar store if you’re into that kind of thing.\n\nBut if you’re buying music in a brick-and-mortar, you are probably too busy reading to yourself with your lips moving or trying to figure out why people are mad at Charlie Sheen, so you won’t have time to listen to this album or any other.\n\nExtras:\n\n▪ For more on Rural Alberta Advantage, check out the interview I conducted with them when they stopped at Schubas back in August 2010.\n\nProject Film @ Schubas (3/1)\n\nPosted on March 2, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nI always find it funny when I show up late to anything. I’m one of those people who likes to be early or on time for everything. Lately, it’s been a problem for a few reasons. The biggest of which has been our big move from Lakeview to Lincoln Park (though I think technically both places are right in the middle). That wasn’t the case last night, though.\n\nNo, last night we were late because we had to stay home long enough to be sure Purdue was going to beat Illinois and stay undefeated at home for the season. Perhaps a trivial thing to many, I assure it was of the utmost importance to us.\n\nSo, when we got to Schubas a few minutes late, Project Film was already on stage. I think we missed one and a half songs. The one they were playing when we arrived was a new one, so I wasn’t entirely sure that the band up there was, in fact, Project Film. But after the song was over they announced that it was new and that they were Project Film (phew!).\n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the band was Sam McAllister’s glasses. Standing up there on stage he looked like a mix between a youthful Rivers Cuomo and a clean-cut Ben Gibbard. His appearance led me to catching a lot of Death Cab For Cutie influences (probably all in my head) throughout a lot of the songs. Thankfully they didn’t do “Soul Meets Body.”\n\nOverall I think my original impression of the band is true, they play the kind of music that I would probably play if I were in a band. Lucky for you, I’m not. The sound at Schubas is always fantastic, and it captured alot of the softer things Project Film do that would be lost in places with sound equipment of inferior quality.\n\nThere were just two things missing from the 45-minute set. One thing missing was a moment where things just get crazy. I thought it was going to, for a brief second, in the instrumental jam “Ink.” It just kept building and building, not unlike the Ryan Adams song “Nobody Girl.”\n\nI brought that up with Sam after the show, and he told me that they had discussed whether they should go balls-out or not. I think it was a mistake to hold back. Especially when you’re in front of a good crowd that seems to be fairly into it like the one at Schubas on this particular night.\n\nThe second thing missing-and this one is a personal belief, not something that was actually wrong with the show-was the lack of a great cover. I think it’s important for a band, especially a young band that’s just starting out, to help inform the audience of their influences and educate them about where the music comes from. A great example of this would be a couple weeks ago at Subterranean when Chaperone covered The Misfits. Maybe the influence doesn’t shine through on every song, but now we know that one of the bands Chaperone enjoys is The Misfits. Then the audience can go out and check out The Misfits if they haven’t already (for shame!). It’s a circle.\n\nOther than those two nitpicks, I thought the show was great. Sam and Megan have a good chemistry on stage together, which is important especially in a live setting. It can be faked a bit in recording, but during a show, you either got it or you don’t.\n\nI’m expecting good things for Project Film in the future. I thoroughly enjoyed their debut LP, Chicago, and this live show didn’t change my feelings. I suggest you and your friends all buy a copy of their record and show up at their next gig-whenever that is.\n\nProject Film – 24 Frames Per Second @ Schubas\n\nPosted on February 28, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nOne of the Chicago Tunes contributors, Jessica Smith, has already done a write-up on Project Film‘s debut album, Chicago. I won’t rehash all of that here, but go ahead and check it out. I agree with pretty much everything she says.\n\nWhat I’ll try to do is put my own spin on the record. One thing that I always do when I listen to music is try to figure out where it came from. What was the band doing when recording, what were they listening to. Sometimes it’s very easy to pick up on, other times, quite difficult.\n\nWhat I hear from Sam McAllister and Megan Frestedt is a musical history that parallels my own. Listening to Sam’s voice on a couple of the tracks makes me think of Elliott Smith in a lot of respects. He has a quiet vulnerability that comes through on the record and makes everything very easy for the listener to relate with.\n\nChicago has a some of it’s roots in 60′s pop as well. It features a lot of the boy-girl vocals that you’d recognize on a record by Lee Hazelwood and Dusty Springfield. I’m a sucker for that kind of thing when it’s done well (Isobell Campbell and Mark Lanegan, She and Him), but when it’s bad it can be excruciating. Sam and Megan have a nice chemistry together, and that can make all the difference in the world. They’re fantastic together.\n\nI was scouring the internet looking up some info on the band that might inform me as I was listening to Chicago, and I noticed that a lot of folks seem to think the world of the song “Kapture.” This is a good song, no doubt. However, it’s VERY Iron & Wine. Too much so for me. The lyrics are good, but there’s something about the way it’s sung and plucked on the guitar that makes me think of a Sam that isn’t in Project Film.\n\nFor my money the best songs on the record are “Spent Chicago,” in which Sam’s singing of the refrain reminds me of Josh Ritter’s “Change of Time,” and the closing track “Sun.” Jessica quoted “Sun” in her review, but I want to take it a bit further here:\n\nYou are perfectly aware\n\nof what I need to survive\n\nthese hands are so tattered and worn\n\nfrom once moving dirt in the night\n\nyour silence is strong enough\n\nto drive someone out of it’s way\n\ni can’t feel a stranger here\n\nand i’d rather picture you in the dark\n\nso go, go into the sun\n\nIt’s a really beautiful song, and one that I could listen to all day and night.\n\nA lot of times we here at Chicago Tunes are sent press releases and little write-ups from bands that talk about how they sing about broken hearts and searching for something and writing about the human condition. For the most part it’s a load of bull. It’s like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Almost Famous when he tells Patrick Fugit to answer Ben Fong-Torres from Rolling Stone by saying his article on Stillwater (still unwritten) is a “think-piece about a mid-level band…struggling with their own limitations…in the, you know, harsh face of stardom.”\n\nBut with Project Film, I feel like all that mularkey about human condition, and telling stories about what it feels like to be alone, or in love, or both at the same time…Chicago gets all those feelings at once, and puts them to music. And for that, I thank them. I also suggest that you go out and get yourself a copy of Chicago from the Project Film website, or from iTunes.\n\n▪ Tomorrow night, Tuesday the 1st of March, Project Film will be playing at Schubas with Audiences and Island of Misfit Toys. The show is 18+ and tickets are $8. Starts at 8pm.\n\nLove In October II\n\nPosted on February 27, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nThis album has been lingering around my iPod for a bit of time now, and I wanted to get a review done by the end of the month. Love In October released this EP on February 8th, and I hate to be more than a few minutes late, so a twenty day lag has been killing me.\n\nThe Widman brothers, Erik and Kent, have been making music together for over 15 years. From the days kicking it in their living room somewhere in northern Sweden til now, they’ve had one objective: Making noise…LOUD NOISE!\n\nSo I was a bit surprised by their new EP, which does contain some very loud noise, but also finds a good amount of quiet moments. Definitely not a bad surprise, especially when it is so well done.\n\nMy favorite song on this release is “Rubix Cube.” It’s definitely on the quiet side of the spectrum, but it’s lyrics are fantastic.\n\nI wrote a story that had no end\n\na reflection of my life but inside I pretend\n\nI’m 12 and a half and addicted to pills\n\nI’m 12 and a half and addicted to thrills\n\nIf my mystery matters to you\n\nThen you are my rubix cube\n\nI’ve said too much\n\nI play like a broken record\n\nAnd the reason is you\n\nThe guitar chord progression and tempo on this particular track reminds me a LOT of Plain White Tee’s “Delilah,” which normally I would say is a bad thing, but it works here. Probably because the lyrics are strong enough to hold up against any kind of music. I might even like it if the song were set against the awful background of Katy Perry’s “California Gurls”/Ke$ha’s “Tik Tok.”\n\nLove In October II was made primarily in Toronto at Chemical Sound Studio in a large live room. I like the idea of recording things live. It’s pure. Sometimes artists can get into a habit of relying on poducers and engineers to tweak things to sound the way they want, and that often leads to an artificial sounding record.\n\nHere on this EP, everything sounds fresh and necessary. There doesn’t seem to be any reliance on fancy computer technology doing pitch-correction and dubbing over things to make it sound a certain way. This version of the music-making process can lead to a recording that isn’t always consistent, but it does feel alive.\n\nOne funny thing I found about this EP, and about the band, is that the tracks they recommended to me are the two tracks I liked least. I could definitely see how they might feel that these two tracks, “Desperate” and “Paper Heart” kind of highlight the sound they’re going after. That’s all well and good, but I’m much more interested in how willing the band is to work outiside of their comfort zone and how they will surprise me.\n\nThey definitely surprised me with “Rubix Cube,” and also with the opening track “Do You Love Me.” The guitar on “Do You Love Me” is very reminiscent of Nick Zinner (who I think is great) without being a copy of him. It also, for some reason, reminds me of a song by Queens of the Stone Age. I can’t remember the name of it because I’m not a huge fan of Josh Homme, but if you think of it, please comment below and let me know (thanks!).\n\nLove In October II is not a perfect record. However, it is fresh, wholly original, and a really good listen. I would say of the five tracks, I really, really like three of them. The other two are ok, but not nearly as good as the others. That said, I think you would do yourself well to get a copy of this release. It’s a digital only, and can be downloaded here.\n\n▪ Erik Widman – Vocals, Guitar, Synthesizer, Accordion\n\n▪ Kent Widman – Bass, Synthesizer, Percussion\n\n▪ Mike (Ford) Nowak – Drums\n\n▪ Tiffany Almy – Vocals\n\nChristopher Limerinos – Guitar on “Desperate”\n\nJay Mathes – Fundamental\n\nPosted on February 23, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nI have to hand it to local singer-songwriter Jay Mathes, the man is passionate about his craft. After playing around but not taking things too seriously, he quit his job giving private guitar lessons to follow his dream of making and playing music for a living. It was a bold move, and one that will take time to pay off. He believes in himself and his talent, and he has a faithful following.\n\nListening to this release by Mathes, I was surprised how much his voice at times reminds me of Jay Farrar. It also reminds me of Will Loyal of Homemade Knives. There’s a deep bassiness that gives the feeling of being in a small room with the lights out, which I think was kind of the feeling Jay was going for when he decided to record the album live with just a guitar and his voice.\n\nAs I was listening to Fundamental, and enjoying it a little, I started to get a sinking feeling. You know the one…it’s the feeling you get when you’re watching TV late at night and that commercial for the Songs of Worship album comes on. That feeling you have in the time it takes you to reach the remote and flip the channel really quick. Yeah. That’s the one.\n\nIn an interview that Jay gave to the Sun-Times, he said he doesn’t consider his music to be Christian Rock. If you don’t consider it to be that, I really don’t know how you consider it at all. Every song has some sort of religious symbolism or overt message.\n\nAnd I’m ok with that. I view music a lot like Roger Ebert views movies…it isn’t WHAT the movie/song is about, it’s HOW it is about it. If the music is done well, then the message doesn’t matter so much to me.\n\nUnfortunately, Fundamental is a bit long on message and a little short on melody. The album does live up to it’s name, though. The chords are basic, and the song structure follows the same formula you would find in most adult contemporary pop music. The whole thing kind of sounds like a demo session for the first Matchbox Twenty (20?) album (or, probably more accurately, the first Creed album).\n\nFor all the things I don’t like about Fundamental, I still find some redeeming qualities in it. There’s something to be said for someone laying their soul bare and putting everything out there.\n\nWhether you and I agree with what Jay Mathes is singing about, he’s giving it his all, and I admire that.\n\nExtras:\n\nJay Mathes is a lifelong Chicagoan\n\nFundamental was released on January 21, 2011. It is available for download on iTunes\n\nJay will be playing a free show in Elmhurst, IL on March 19th at Cuvee Cellars\n\nRadiohead – The King of Limbs; or, The Reason I’ll Never Be Cool\n\nPosted on February 22, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nSo, in case you’ve been living under a rock the last week or so, Radiohead put out a new album on Friday. I have to admit I like the way these guys get things done. I remember a few months ago seeing somewhere that Phil Selway mentioned they might be recording soon. Then I heard nothing for a long time. All of a sudden, there’s a new Radiohead album.\n\nThat’s a good strategy for a band that seem to be a completely self-contained unit. I don’t think it’s possible for a band starting out to do a lot of the things Radiohead does. Lack of capital and artistic freedom inhibits most musicians, signed and unsigned.\n\nBut having capital and artistic freedom isn’t always the best thing. Sometimes it helps to have constraints that force you to write and perform differently. And here is the problem with Radiohead’s new record (in my mind).\n\nI may shock you a bit, and lose all indie credibility I ever had, by saying that I’ve never been a huge Radiohead fan. I like them. I think Jonny Greenwood is a great musician (his soundtrack for There Will Be Blood is amazing), but I don’t think they’ve put out a really strong record since OK Computer.\n\nHonestly, I feel like everything they’ve done since that album is pretty much the same. I don’t think I could tell if someone switched out Hail to the Thief for In Rainbows or The King of Limbs. The band seems to be stuck in a kind of funk that might be caused by the insular nature of the way they record.\n\nFans of the band feel differently, of course. Every time I hear of a Radiohead release I have fifty different people telling me fifty different reasons it’s great. How many times can you hear Thom Yorke’s nasally, dying-cat voice looped over the same drum-machine beat before it becomes old? Apparently the answer, for most people, is a great many times.\n\nThom Yorke and the others in Radiohead are good songwriters. That’s another issue I have with the band. Back when they were still making music that I enjoyed, the writing really stood out. It made songs like “High and Dry” and “Creep” great to sing along to. The music they’re making now makes me want to curl up and go to sleep, like Mazzy Starr’s “Fade Into You.”\n\nIt’s not all bad, though. I do like the way The King of Limbs opens. It’s all pretty, trippy keyboard synth and African drum beats. Then Yorke opens up his maw and ruins the mood. Same goes for track 2, which has kind of a videogame feeling throughout (Castlevania, I think).\n\nI know I’m in the minority on Radiohead. Lord knows I’ll never be allowed to step into Pitchfork’s offices. But, that’s one of the things that makes music great. We don’t all have to agree all the time. Now let’s see how long it takes for me to get flamed in the Comments section.\n\nBig News Monday; or, Something to read while you’re supposed to be working\n\nPosted on February 21, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nLooking out the huge windows of the store here, I feel like I’m staring into a Corman McCarthy story. It’s gray and glum and I don’t like it one bit.\n\nWhat better way to beat the blues than to think about some great stuff that we have coming up here on Chicago Tunes!!!\n\nWith March just around the corner, the time is upon us now to start thinking about music festivals. With the ho-hum headliners announced for Lollapalooza already, my excitement for the fest season has dwindled a bit. Maybe yours did, too. If so, here is some good news to get you pumped again!\n\nChicago Tunes is headed down to SxSw in Austin, TX, and we’re going to be hanging around some of the best bands in Chicago.\n\nI can’t even list all the awesome people and bands that are going to be down south for this festival, but I will say this…prepare to have your minds blown!\n\nWe’re gonna have interviews with a bunch of great musicians (not my idea, it was given to me by Chaperone), I’ll be live-tweeting from events, I’ll be posting pics and videos every chance I get while we’re there. And, if all goes according to plan, we’re gonna come home with a very special treat for everyone.\n\nHeading down to SxSw and getting to work with all these amazing bands is really like a dream for me, and I’d like to thank every single person who has agreed to join us in this endeavor. I hope you know who you are, because I’m not going to literally type every one of your names here.\n\nAnd as if SxSw isn’t exciting enough, there’s more! Starting this week, hopefully, we will be having a weekly guest writer from a Chicago band talking about the album that influenced them to get into music. I think it will be an interesting and fun way to let these musicians pay homage to the band or artist that changed their lives forever. So, look for that on Thursday’s or Sunday’s, depending on when articles get submitted.\n\nThanks for reading, re-posting, RT’ing our posts. It is more appreciated than you know. Don’t forget to comment if you especially like something, or if you especially hate something. We want to know what works and what doesn’t.\n\nBut please, go easy on Miles when he does his post. He cries a lot.\n\nJosh Ritter @ The Vic; or, May I Have This Dance?\n\nPosted on February 18, 2011 by joshterzino\n\nJosh Ritter never fails to amaze me with his live show. He rarely fails to amaze me on record as well. Last nights show at the Victoria Theatre was no exception. He played a couple songs he doesn’t always play, and left a couple big hits off of the setlist. It was enough of a change to make the whole concert feel fresh and new. It also didn’t hurt that we got there early enough to be in the first row.\n\nWell, that’s a bit misleading. Actually, we WERE in the second row, but once opener Scott Hutchison (of Frightened Rabbit) finished his set, the girls in front of us left, so we took their spot. They weren’t the only ones to leave, either. Scott Hutchison has a much bigger following in Chicago than I thought.\n\nI’m not completely familiar with Frightened Rabbit. I know OF them, but I haven’t spent a lot of time listening to their music. Which is odd, because I generally like music from Scottish bands. We Were Promised Jetpacks, The Twilight Sad, Franz Ferdinand have all received a lot of time on my iPod. From what I can tell, Scott Hutchison’s music is mostly stuff that I would like.\n\nHis onstage persona is quite charming. He tells a lot of funny anecdotes (in particular there was one about having a pubic hair stuck in his throat when he played at the Double Door that made me chuckly quite a bit. If you’re a fan of “Curb Your Enthusiasm”, you understand why), plays without a setlist, and appears to have a great time up there.\n\nIn other words, he was a perfect set up man for a guy like Josh Ritter.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that we drove up to Madison to see Josh play at the Majestic Theatre. It’s fair to say that I was a little worried that we’d end up hearing the same setlist and I would find myself disappointed with the show. I should have known that thinking I’d be let down by Josh Ritter is a silly concept. The guy could come out, play a few chords, flash that big, goofy grin, say thanks Chicago and leave, and I’d be perfectly happy.\n\nInstead, he came out with the band and played, I think, the longest set I’ve seen them perform. Starting alone with “Come and Find Me” off Golden Age of Radio calmed me down quite a bit. When we saw him in Madison I wanna say he opened with “Monster Ballads,” so right there, the show is already headed in a different direction.\n\nI’m not sure if I was more surprised with the songs that got played, or the ones that didn’t. Is it really a Josh Ritter show if he doesn’t play “Wolves?” That’s been a staple every time we’ve seen him play. He also didn’t play “Another New World” off So Runs the World Away. He played that one in Madison, as well as last May when we saw him in the friendly confines of this same Vic.\n\nHe did play “Naked As A Window,” which I would argue is the best song with a 90-second duration. He also played the newest song available, “Galahad,” which was just released last week as part of a Tour EP. That song, if you haven’t heard it, is fantastic. It has everything. Biblical references, Kenny Rogers, Knights, Angels, Stable boys…the list "
