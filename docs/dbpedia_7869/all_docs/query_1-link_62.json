        "text": "Mark Lanegan will be spending a good part of 2016 on the road. Lanegan will be on the road in Europe through May, and now he's announced several dates for a U.S. leg. Don't miss Lanegan at the Magic Bag in Ferndale on June 16th. Tickets go on sale Friday, April 1st at 10am.\n\nLanegan's last solo record Phantom Radio was released in 2014. Last year he released the 6 LP boxset One Way Street featuring his first 5 solo albums -- The Winding Sheet, Whiskey For The Holy Ghost (2LP), Scraps At Midnight, I'll Take Care Of You, and Field Songs. Each album is pressed on 180 gram vinyl and housed in a sleeve reproducing the art for its original release. Both Phantom Radio and One Way Street are available to purchase on Amazon and the Sub Pop store.\n\nMark Lanegan -- U.S. tour\n\nJun 16 -- Ferndale, MI @ The Magic Bag\n\nJun 17 -- Chicago, IL @ Old Town School of Folk Music – Maurer Hall\n\nJun 18 -- Milwaukee, WI @ Shank Hall\n\nJun 20 -- Allston, MA @ Brighton Music Hall\n\nJun 21 -- Washington, DC @ Rock & Roll Hotel\n\nJun 22 -- Philadelphia, PA @ Johnny Brenda's\n\nJun 23 -- New York, NY @ Gramercy Theatre\n\nJul 08 -- Seattle, WA @ Neptune Theatre\n\nJul 09 -- Portland, OR @ Star Theatre\n\nJul 11 -- San Francisco, CA 2 Slim's\n\nJul 12 -- Los Angeles, CA @ The Roxy Theatre\n\nPublished March 31st, 2016\n\nWire recently announced the release of Nocturnal Koreans and issued the mini-album's driving title track. Now the foursome debuted another track from the record titled \"Internal Exile,\" which is less intense than \"Nocturnal Koreans,\" but rocks all the same. Stream both songs below and pre-order Nocturnal Koreans from Amazon, or Pink Flag. Nocturnal Koreans is out April 22nd.\n\n\"The WIRE album was quite respectful of the band, and Nocturnal Koreans is less respectful of the band—or, more accurately, it’s the band being less respectful to itself—in that it’s more created in the studio, rather than recorded basically as the band played it, which was mostly the case with WIRE. A general rule for this record was: any trickery is fair game, if it makes it sound better.\"\n\n~ Wire\n\nPublished March 31st, 2016\n\nMichael Stipe appeared on the Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon last night to perform an exquisite version of David Bowie's \"The Man Who Sold The World.\" Watch Stipe's stirring performance (and mesmerizing beard) below:\n\nStipe's performance was a warm up for two Bowie tribute concerts happening in New York this week -- Thursday, March 31st at Carnegie Hall and Friday, April 1st at Radio City Music Hall. Friday's tribute streams live courtesy of Skype and is expected to include performances from Stipe, J Mascis, Perry Farrell, Pixies, Debbie Harry, and more (lineup for the show is subject to change). Proceeds from the live stream benefit various music related charities. Find out more here.\n\nPublished March 30th, 2016\n\nTwo David Bowie tribute concerts take place in New York this week -- Michael Stipe, Patti Smith, J Mascis, Perry Farrell, Robyn Hitchcock, Laurie Anderson, Debbie Harry, and Flaming Lips are among the artists paying tribute to Bowie March 31st at Carnegie Hall and April 1st at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nThe first concert was planned as a tribute before Bowie's untimely passing, and ultimately after the world learned of his death, the concert turned into a memorial. Though the concert was announced prior to his death, tickets went on sale days after Bowie died and tickets sold out immediately. Shortly thereafter a second tribute was organized, which also sold out in record time.\n\nDue to popular demand, Friday's tribute will stream live via Skype and is expected to include performances from Stipe, J Mascis, Perry Farrell, Pixies, Debbie Harry, and more (lineup for the show is subject to change). A small donation is required to access the stream -- proceeds from the stream benefit various music related charities. The list of artists participating in the April 1st live stream and more info on accessing the stream is posted here.\n\nLush reunited last year and this year they'll head to North America for a handful of tour dates. Though the band announced a handful of U.S. dates previously, now they've extended their tour plans and added a Detroit date! Don't miss Lush at St. Andrew's Hall on September 19th -- this is the band's first Detroit date in over 20 years! Pre-sales begin Wednesday, March 31st and the general onsale is Friday, April 1st at 10am. Ticket link here.\n\nLush also return with new music this spring -- the four song EP, Blind Spot, will be released on April 22nd. Pre-order the EP from iTunes, Amazon, or the band's official store.\n\nAdditionally, on Record Store Day (April 16th), the band will release a limited edition 5 LP boxset titled Origami which features the full albums Spooky, Split, Lovelife, and two compilations Gala, and Topolino all pressed on colored vinyl. More details on the release are posted here.\n\nLush -- U.S. tour\n\nApr 14 -- Los Angeles @ The Roxy Theatre\n\nApr 16 -- Indio, CA @ Coachella\n\nApr 17 -- San Francisco @ The Warfield\n\nApr 19 -- Portland, OR @ Crystal Ballroom\n\nApr 20 -- Seattle, WA @ The Showbox\n\nApr 21 -- Vancover, BC @ Commodore Ballroom\n\nApr 23 -- Indio, CA @ Coachella\n\nSep 14 -- New York, NY @ Terminal 5\n\nSep 15 -- Boston, MA @ Royale\n\nSep 18 -- Chicago, IL @ Vic Theatre\n\nSep 19 -- Detroit, MI @ St. Andrew's Hall\n\nSep 21 -- Washington, DC @ 9:30 Club\n\nSep 22 -- Philadelphia, PA @ Union Transfer\n\nPublished March 28th, 2016\n\nMichael Stipe is back in action this week -- he's confirmed as a guest on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon this Tuesday, March 29th. It is very rare for Stipe to perform solo, and it's his first appearance on late night TV since R.E.M. broke up, so Tuesday night's performance is certainly a primo Must See TV EVENT. There's no telling what Stipe will sing, but don't count out a David Bowie song, considering he's performing March 31st at the David Bowie tribute at Carnegie Hall, which also features Perry Farrell, Debbie Harry, Pixies, Flaming Lips, Robyn Hitchcock, Laurie Anderson and more.\n\nTune in for the brilliance Tuesday night, and for now, enjoy Michael Stipe in all his glory below:\n\nPublished March 26th, 2016\n\nAfter much speculation, The Stone Roses have confirmed they are indeed working on a new album. NME caught up with Ian Brown outside a recording studio and got answers to the vital questions! Brown confirmed new Stone Roses material is in the works, but declined to say how many new songs are in the works. He revealed the studio sessions were going \"like a dream\" and the new material sounds \"glorious.\" As to when we can expect to hear this glory, Brown responded by saying \"soon.\"\n\nSo there you have it. The Stone Roses have several shows lined up for the summer, so it's possible we'll hear the Third Coming shortly. Or not. Watch NME's exclusive video featuring Ian Brown below:\n\nStone Roses -- 2016 tour\n\nJun 02 -- Tokyo @ Nippon Budokhan\n\nJun 03 -- Tokyo @ Nippon Budokhan\n\nJun 15 -- Manchester, UK @ Etihad Stadium\n\nJun 17 -- Manchester, UK @ Etihad Stadium\n\nJun 18 -- Manchester, UK @ Etihad Stadium\n\nJun 19 -- Manchester, UK @ Etihad Stadium\n\nJun 30 -- New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden\n\nJul 08 -- Perthshire, UK @ T In The Park\n\nJul 09 -- Dublin, IR @ Marlay Park\n\nPublished March 24th, 2016\n\nBob Mould returns with a new solo record Patch The Sky on March 25th.

The Music of David Bowie is a 2 hour concert event featuring Bowie classics performed by the DSO accompanied by a full rock band. The performance features ~ 18 rapturous songs from Bowie's catalog, including \"Space Oddity,\" \"Rebel Rebel\" \"Fame,\" \"Under Pressure,\" and \"Heroes.\"\n\nConductor Brent Havens has previously arranged and conducted other symphonic rock tributes featuring music of U2, the Doors, and Pink Floyd among others. He reveals:\n\n\"My concept for The Music of David Bowie was to take the music as close to the originals as we could and then add some colors to enhance what Bowie had done. The wonderful thing with an orchestra is that you have an entire palette to call upon. The band is reproducing what Bowie did on the albums, verbatim, and then having an orchestra behind the band gives the music a richness, a whole different feel, a whole different sense of power.\"\n\nTickets for the Music of David Bowie go on sale Saturday, March 26th at 10am. Pre-sales kick off Thursday, March 24th.\n\nFor more details on The Music of David Bowie visit the DSO.\n\nNoel Gallagher heads back to North America this summer for a new round of dates in support of his superb second album Chasing Yesterday.

While these nu-gaze bands are good at using layered, swirling guitars, many bands can't quite back up the fuzz with SONGS and take it to the next level. Philadelphia's Nothing is one of the stand out bands of this new shoegaze era -- they not only deliver on classic shoegaze fuzz, but they also have solid production, and perhaps most importantly, mad songwriting skills. Indeed, Nothing is one of the finest shoegaze bands around.\n\nOn May 13th, Nothing returns with Tired Of Tomorrow -- the highly anticipated follow up to 2014's Guilty Of Everything. The album promises to be full of fuzzy, powerful, yet melodic songs -- so far the band premiered the first single \"Vertigo Flowers,\" which is brilliant and thunderous. Check out the video for \"Vertigo Flowers\" below and pre-order Tired Of Tomorrow through iTunes, Amazon, Bandcamp, or the official store.\n\nDon't miss Nothing on the road in North America this summer.

The 20 Years of Placebo World Tour will celebrate the band's entire history and will include material the band has not played in years, including songs leader Brian Molko himself had previously said he'd never perform again. From Molko's official statement on the tour:\n\n\"Let's just say there will be songs in the set that I've sworn never to play again. I think it's time that we purposefully acknowledged what a lot of Placebo fans really want to hear. They've been very patient with us since we rarely play our most commercially successful material.\n\nA 20 year anniversary tour seems like the right time to do so. That's our intention. This tour is very much for the fans and a chance for us to revisit a lot of our early material.\n\nSo, if you want to see us play songs like 'Pure Morning’ and 'Nancy Boy’ which we haven't played in almost ten years and may not play again, then you'd better come along to these shows! We'll have some surprises in there too....\"\n\nThe first leg of the tour kicks off in the autumn and focuses on Europe & the U.K. Don't count out a North American leg just yet -- they've only announced dates for the first leg so far and according to the band \"further dates for 2017 will be revealed later\" so keep your fingers crossed and stay tuned!
