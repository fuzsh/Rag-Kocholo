This chapter discusses first impressions and early meetings with Mark Lanegan. The author's brother Gary Lee Conner first met Lanegan as a child when they were both in elementary school. Lanegan was known around their small town in Washington as a troublemaker involved with drugs, alcohol, and crime from a young age. In high school, Lanegan befriended Gary Lee's brother Van Conner and Mark Pickerel. They discovered their shared love of punk and new wave music. Lanegan and the author traded records in 1985, beginning their friendship and musical collaboration.",
