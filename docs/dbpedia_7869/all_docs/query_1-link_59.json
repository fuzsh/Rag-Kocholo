        "text": "Queens of the Stone Age - Rated Rx (reissue)\n\nIs it really a whole decade since Rated R’s original release? We must admit to being taken slightly by surprise when we discovered that Queens Of The Stone Age were reissuing their breakthrough second album to celebrate ten years since its first airing.\n\nMaybe it’s hard to think of Rated R as a ‘classic album’ because it’s aged so well. In terms of both songwriting and production the record stands up against any great rock record released in the latter half of the last decade.\n\nOf course, despite Rated R marking QOTSA’s breakthrough, they were by no means a band coming out of nowhere. Vocalist, guitarist, band-leader and producer Josh Homme already had a more-than-impressive CV behind him by the turn of the millennium. Prior to forming QOTSA Homme had spent much of the ‘90s as lead guitarist of the scene-defining ‘stoner rock’ band Kyuss, whom he’d formed in the late ‘80s at the tender age of 15.\n\nHomme was also already several years into his Desert Sessions project - a series of collaborative albums recorded in the desert in Joshua Tree, Homme’s hometown - more on that later.\n\nRated R, however, was by no means a single-person effort. As has always been the case, the Queens Of The Stone Age of Rated R consisted of an ever revolving line-up of musicians and contributors; there are performances from 17 different musicians on Rated R. Most notable of these is Nick Oliveri, who was, from the Rated R sessions until his 2004 dismissal from the band, QOTSA’s full-time bassist and a close collaborator of Homme. It’s worth noting that Oliveri is also a man with, it seems, a genuine passion for getting naked.\n\nSo let’s take a track-by-track look at Rated Rx and see how Queens Of The Stone Age’s classic album is looking in 2010…\n\nFeel Good Hit Of The Summer\n\nThe opening one-two of Feel Good Hit Of The Summer and Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret is still QOTSA’s most infectious moment to date.\n\nFeel Good Hit is the song that nearly got Rated R pulled from sale by several major American retailers, most notably Wal-Mart. It’s not surprising to be honest; the lyrics are essentially just a repeated list of drugs (nicotine, Valium, Vicodin, marijuana, ecstasy, alcohol and cocaine to be precise).\n\nActually drugs are a fairly important reference point when discussing Rated R. The repeated references to illicit substances, and Homme’s background in Kyuss, often means that Rated R gets labelled as a stoner rock album.\n\nBut the desert rock scene that sprang up around Palm Desert at the turn of the millennium is actually a bold step away from those ‘90s stoner roots. The meticulously tight riffs of Kyuss are still present, but Rated R is more eclectic, emotive and edgier than its roots.\n\nRight from the opening Feel Good Hit is clearly set apart from the slow, grungy riffs of stoner music. With its punk rock bassline and urgent drum build-ups there’s the kind of energy to the song that you just don’t get when you’ve been spending a lot of time with Mary Jane.\n\nThe track also features backing vocals from Judas Priest singer Rob Halford who, as the story goes, was recording in the studio next door and was talked into making a vocal cameo.\n\nLost Art Of Keeping A Secret\n\nIt’s impossible to overlook how great it sounds when Feel Good Hit slides into the intro drum fill of Lost Art.\n\nWhereas Feel Good Hit Of The Summer was punky and energetic, Lost Art is tight, melodic and poppy. That’s not to say it’s a simple track though. The great songwriting and production - the way the electric piano is panned hard left with the guitar riff chugging to the right - mean this is streets ahead of your average rock single.\n\nAs with several other tracks on Rated R, Lost Art is a step forward form the band's stoner rock background. There’s obviously still tricks that were learnt from the ‘90s; the tight playing, the repetitive riffs. But now there’s a very memorable chorus in there too. In production terms also, there’s less emphasis on guitar and drums and numerous great little instrumental touches are added. It almost hints at an influence from classic ‘60s and ‘70s pop records.\n\nAuto Pilot\n\nAuto Pilot is the first Queens Of The Stone Age recording that features Nick Oliveri on lead vocals.\n\nAfter Homme Nick is generally spoken of as the second biggest player in QOTSA’s history, which is odd in a way. He only actually ever appeared on two Queens records - this and Songs For The Deaf - and hasn’t played with the band since him and Homme had a fairly public bust-up in ’04. In actuality there are other members, such as Mark Lanegan and Perfect Circle guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, who have statistically appeared with the band for longer periods.\n\nOliveri is probably seen as important for two reasons though. Firstly, his creative relationship with Homme was always seen as a very close one; the two had played in bands with each other since they were teenagers in the ‘80s and always appeared to work very closely together.\n\nSecondly Oliveri has always been a real larger-than-life, rock and roll figure. You could argue that, in the first half of the noughties, if you hadn’t seen Nick Oliveri perform naked, you hadn’t properly experienced rock music.\n\nEverything from his penchant for going on stage wearing nothing but boots and a bass guitar strapped across his genitals to his always well-trimmed ginger beard mark him out as one of the last decade’s coolest musicians. Anyone who’s seen him perform with QOTSA, Mondo Generator, The Dwarves, or any of the other numerous acts he’s turned up in, will testify to this fact.\n\nMonsters In The Parasol\n\nMonsters In The Parasol, the third song to be released as a single from Rated R, first appeared in 1998 on Volume 4 of Josh Homme’s Desert Sessions project.\n\nThe Desert Sessions were a project that Homme started in 1997 at the Rancho De La Luna studio in his native Joshua Tree, California. So far ten volumes of the collaborative recording project have been released, featuring contributions from Homme, PJ Harvey, Josh Freese and members of Kyuss, Screaming Trees and Soundgarden among many others.\n\nOriginally recorded as Monster In The Parasol, the track was performed on Volume 4 by a band featuring both Homme and Oliveri under the moniker of The Green Monarchs. The original is a slightly more sedate, churning stoner rock affair than the QOTSA version - although the version that appears on Rated R is still one of the most Kyuss-like, stoner-rock-influenced moments on the album. Check out the YouTube clip below of the Desert Sessions version.\n\nHomme has stated in a number of interviews over the last decade that Monsters In The Parasol is about a bad experience he had while on LSD. Listening to the lyrics we’re not doubting that claim one bit.\n\nListen: The Green Monarchs - Monster In The Parasol (from Desert Sessions Vol. 4)\n\nQuick And To The Pointless\n\nNick Oliveri takes lead vocal duties on Quick And To The Pointless. Homme has mentioned in interviews that the vocal take used on the recording was originally just meant to be a scratch (ie rough) vocal for the band to work to while they recorded the instrument parts.\n\nHowever, Homme and Oliveri both liked the rough and aggressive nature of vocal take that they kept it and used it for the finished recording. Which could explain the origin of Oliveri saying “I don’t even know what I’m doing here” at the beginning of the recording. Or maybe they just put that in because it sounded cool. Who knows? We’re just speculating here.\n\nGreat song though, and always a highlight of their live shows around that time.\n\nIn The Fade/Feel Good Hit Of The Summer (Reprise)\n\nIn The Fade is notable as it is the first time that former Screaming Trees singer Mark Lanegan takes lead vocal duties (although he also appears as a backing vocalist on Leg Of Lamb, Auto-Pilot and I Think I Lost My Headache).\n\nJosh Homme had previously acted as a touring guitarist for Screaming Trees in the mid-‘90s following the break-up of Kyuss. When Screaming Trees finally ended their 15 year career in 2000 Lanegan joined the ranks of QOTSA and continued to play with the band until ’05.\n\nLanegan is actually, after Homme, QOTSA’s longest standing member. Despite leaving the ranks of their live line-up in ’05 he has continued to make appearances on every studio record since.\n\nIn The Fade is easy to overlook when surrounded by the catchier, more full-on tracks on Rated R, but in retrospect it’s one of the albums most emotive, tender and, as a result, most interesting songs.\n\nBonus tracks/ verdict\n\nIn terms of bonus content, this reissue of Rated R comes with a hand-full of b-sides, unreleased tracks and a live set from Reading Festival in 2000.\n\nThe studio tracks are a bit of a mixed bag. Ode To Clarissa will be familiar to anyone who picked up an original vinyl copy of Rated R, as it was a bonus track there too, and it’s a pretty good, classic QOTSA sounding number.\n\nYou’re So Vague is a slightly odd half-parody of Carly Simon’s You’re So Vein, although it doesn’t really resemble that song very much. Never Say Never, on the other hand, is a cover of a minor hit single by Romeo Void from the early ‘80s. It sounds a little out of character for QOTSA, oddly dance-punk-ish, in a way.\n\nThe live set is nice to hear. Reassuringly at least a third of the MusicRadar team can (hazily) remember being in the audience for this Reading Fest performance. We remember it being a fairly jam-orientated set from a band who were as much on form as they were obviously on a certain amount of illicit substances. Listening back to it now brings back good memories…\n\nSo in all the bonus content here is far from essential stuff, but it’s still nice to hear. Either way the extra stuff is fairly irrelevant; in case you haven’t guessed over the last twelve slides, we think Rated R is pretty essential listening.\n\nIt still sounds pretty much as fresh and exciting in 2010 as it did when we first heard it ten years ago; a unique, genre defining and influential record.\n\nIt’s also, fairly inexplicably, been out of print for several years now. So the fact that we can now pick-up a vinyl copy, having missed out first time round, is very good news however you look at it.\n\nLiked this?
