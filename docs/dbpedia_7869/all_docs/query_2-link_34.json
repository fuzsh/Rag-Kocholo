Homme is known for never giving a straight answer as to how his last name is pronounced, but on several occasions (the BBC radio documentary \"Time For Heroes: The Pixies\" and on his secret \"fan letter\" on the final track of Mastodon's album \"Blood Mountain\"), he pronounced it as rhyming with \"mommy\", and this has been generally accepted as the proper Norwegian pronunciation amongst the fanbase, however according to the most commonly used Norwegian variants the right pronunciation would be [humm…ô] . When Homme was interviewed in 2005 he again pronounced his surname as rhyming with \"mommy\".

The Ovation guitars were part of a limited production run, with less than 1000 made in 1984. Homme is evasive about his guitar equipment, choosing to either change the subject or even lie when asked about his setup in interviews,. However it has been established that Homme owns three 1984 Ovation GPs (one sunburst, one black, and one red), [cite news| url=http://www.thefade.net/band/equipment/joshsetup.html | publisher=Thefade.net | title=\"Equipment\" Includes short interview on guitar playing] and that he often downtunes his guitar to C standard.\n\nIn the early days of Kyuss, Homme used Peavey amps and was also seen with a B.C. Rich Mockingbird but by the time of \"Blues for the Red Sun\" he was back using his Ovation GP along with Marshall amplifiers and Ampeg bass cabs. On this tour he was also seen using a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop and a cream-colored Gibson SG.Towards the end of Kyuss he moved from Marshall amplifiers to Tube Works amps, still supplemented by Ampeg bass cabs. Homme was sometimes seen playing an ultra rare cream-colored Gibson Les Paul double-cut that was owned by latter-day Kyuss roadie Dave Catching.\n\nIn an interview about guitars in 2008, Homme claimed to own an amount of guitars close to 35, adding that only 3 of them were \"really good\". He also declared that he purposely did not have a Fender Stratocaster or a Gibson Les Paul, but that he's always in search of intriguing, unique guitars, which are not always generally accepted as \"quality\" guitars, but are nevertheless great to use. He literally said that he tends to buy \"weird, Japanese\" guitars, or guitars that are already \"scarred\" and thus have a story.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age-era gear\n\nDuring the tours up until \"Lullabies to Paralyze\", Homme used the following:\n\n* Gibson Marauder Custom\n\n* Maton MS503\n\n* Maton MS524\n\n* Epiphone Dot\n\nFor the \"Lullabies to Paralyze\" and \"Era Vulgaris\" record and tour, Homme has since retired the GPs, and plays almost exclusively semihollow guitars, including:\n\n* Maton BB1200 \"Betty Blue\" in Black, Blue, Red Wine and a Tobacco with Scroll Tailpiece\n\n* Maton BB1200JH (Josh Homme's NEW signature guitar) [Maton @ AMAC 2008 - Australian Music Association Conference]\n\n* Motor Ave BelAire - Black with Silver scratchplate\n\n* Maton MS526 with Bigsby\n\n* Gibson Barney Kessel Signature\n\n* Yamaha SA503 TVL in Black (Troy Van Leeuwen's signature guitar)\n\n* Teisco '68 V-2\n\n* Epiphone Dot\n\nIn addition to guitar Homme frequently plays bass guitar, such as on \"Burn the Witch\" and \"Long Slow Goodbye,\" as well as every track on QOTSA's debut album except for \"You Would Know\" and \"Give the Mule What He Wants.\" Homme also plays the drums with Eagles of Death Metal, on The Desert Sessions as well as on some QOTSA tracks.\n\nAdditionally, an Ampeg Dan Armstrong plexiglass guitar is featured in the video for \"Sick, Sick, Sick\".\n\nPedalboard:\n\n*Dunlop QZ-1 Crybaby Q-Zone\n\n*Electro Harmonix POG\n\n*Fulltone Ultimate Octave\n\n*BOSS GEB-7 Equalizer\n\n*Ernie Ball Volume Pedal\n\n*SIB Echodrive (x2)\n\n*Fulltone Clyde Deluxe Wah\n\n*Fulltone Fat-Boost\n\nDiscography\n\nQueens of the Stone Age\n\n*\"Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age\" (1997)\n\n*\"The Split CD\" (1998)\n\n*\"Queens of the Stone Age\" (1998)\n\n*\"Rated R\" (2000)\n\n*\"Songs for the Deaf\" (2002)\n\n*\"Stone Age Complication\" (2004)\n\n*\"Lullabies to Paralyze\" (2005)\n\n*\"Over the Years and Through the Woods\" (2005)\n\n*\"Era Vulgaris\" (2007)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n* [http://www.queensofthestoneage.com Queens of the Stone Age official site]\n\n* [http://www.eaglesofdeathmetal.com Eagles of Death Metal official site]\n\n* [http://www.desertsessions.com Desert Sessions official site]"
