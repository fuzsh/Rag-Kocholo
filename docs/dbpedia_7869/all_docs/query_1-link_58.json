        "text": "Lanegan’s early life was marred by drug abuse and a dysfunctional family, but whilst serving time on a rehab course at around the age of 18, he met Van and Gary Lee Conner. In 1984, he formed the grunge band “Screaming Trees”, with the Conners and Barrett Martin, they rehearsed at the brother's parents video rental store. Lanegan originally wanted to be the drummer of the band, but ended up being the frontman, a year later they were signed and released their debut Clairvoyance.\n\nAround this time, Screaming Trees were just one of many bands emerging from Seattle, alongside bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden and they were subsequently dubbed as “The Godfathers of Grunge”. The band released four more albums before they were picked up by major label Epic Records in 1991. The band enjoyed a successful career during the 90s enjoying both commercial and critical triumphs. A lot of their releases charted well and the group embarked on tours around the States before breaking up in 2000, after their final album, “Dust”.\n\nDuring the 90s Lanegan had also began his solo career, after releasing his debut album “The Winding Sheet”. His second release “Whiskey For The Holy Ghost” was well received, with critics noting his scratchy and baritone voice, comparing him to the likes of Tom Waits. This cemented his career as a solo artist.\n\nIn 2001, Lanegan decided to join his friend Josh Homme’s band, “Queens of the Stone Age”, taking over lead vocals on tracks such as “Hangin’ Tree” and “God is in the Radio”. He joined QOTSA on tour as the third lead vocalist the following year, and has recorded and played with the band intermittently ever since."
