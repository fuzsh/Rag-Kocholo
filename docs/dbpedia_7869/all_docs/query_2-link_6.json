        "text": "The first guitarist Josh Homme was obsessed with: “It was an eye-opener”\n\nThe blend of music influencing the style of Josh Homme spans across the diverse musical spectrum. Ranging from Black Sabbath to the vibrant, high-energy sound of Jimi Hendrix, Homme embodies a veritable music encyclopedia, particularly in genres that emphasise powerful guitar riffs and driving percussion.\n\nHomme initially achieved acclaim as the guitarist for the influential stoner rock trailblazers Kyuss. They introduced the vibrant sound of the Palm Desert scene, which had been simmering for some time, to a broader audience. Like predecessors Saint Vitus, Kyuss played a pivotal role in shaping the genre, aligning themselves with key figures such as Sleep, Melvins, and Fu Manchu.\n\nHomme’s guitar skills shone brightly during his tenure with Kyuss. Following the group’s disbandment, grunge compatriots Screaming Trees recruited him as a touring guitarist from 1996 to 1998. His close bond with frontman Mark Lanegan proved highly beneficial, and eventually, Homme departed from Screaming Trees to co-found Queens of the Stone Age.\n\nElsewhere, Homme has been involved in The Desert Sessions, a musical improvisation collective featuring musicians from the Palm Desert scene since 1997. He co-founded the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures alongside John Paul Jones and Dave Grohl in 2009. Moreover, Homme co-wrote, performed, and produced Iggy Pop’s 2016 album, Post Pop Depression.\n\nKnown for his relentless creativity, the Californian artist has also collaborated with Arctic Monkeys, Foo Fighters, Run the Jewels, and Royal Blood in diverse roles. When it comes to specific influences, therefore, it comes as no surprise that there are a handful of esteemed guitarists who continue to inspire Homme’s work.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly, the musician discussed one guitarist he was obsessed with as a kid: Carl Perkins. When he experienced Perkins live in concert, he recalls having an epiphany: “At about eight, I saw Carl Perkins play in Idaho, at a thing called the Festival at Sandpoint,” he remembered. “This was the type of festival [where] you could bring your own fried chicken and wine and dance in a small-town baseball diamond. It put me in this understanding of Elvis Presley and Sun Records all in one swoop. It was an eye-opener for me.”"
