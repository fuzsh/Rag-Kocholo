        "text": "The Down Lizzo:\n\nThis is normally the part of my reviews where I give some background and context of who and what the band Iâ€™m reviewing is.\n\nI feel like a bit of an idiot in this instance though because are you seriously telling me you donâ€™t know who the Arctic Monkeys are?\n\nWho are you man?! Seriously, what the fuck are you doing on this site? You take a wrong turn on the way to 2OceansVibe? Get out from under that rock man! Christ, youâ€™re missing all the good stuff!\n\nNow that thatâ€™s sorted, letâ€™s get into the meat and bones of this album, shall we?\n\nThose of us who are familiar with the Arctic Monkeys will also be familiar with the fact that this band is incapable of releasing a dud album.\n\nDonâ€™t take my word for it though, read this article which says that the band have made Official UK Album Chart history as the only indie-released act to release five consecutive albums at Number One on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nMore impressive than that however is the musical journey that this band has gone through. Few bands come to mind that are as doggedly determined to surge forward in terms of the evolution of their sound as the Arctic Monkeys.\n\nAs Iâ€™ve noted in previous reviews, they could have comfortably continued releasing borderline bubblegum-pop indie albums like their first two, started loping off into the sunset around album number five and disappeared from the music altogether and that would have been just fine.\n\nInstead they pretty much overhauled their entire sound with their 3rd album, the Josh Homme (Queens Of The Stone Age) produced Humbug in 2009. Overnight they changed from sarcastic indie kids to dark, brooding desert rockers, a change that lost them a big portion of their original fanbase and lead to a lot of people saying Josh Homme had â€œruinedâ€ the Arctic Monkeys.\n\nI love Humbug, but even Iâ€™ll admit that Hommeâ€™s influence was a bit too strong on that album. He has a way of seeping into every project heâ€™s involved in and leaving an unmistakeable mark on everything he touches.\n\nIn contrast, 2011â€™s Suck It And See felt like the band was trying to reconcile who theyâ€™d become with who they were. The results were a record that showed a lot of promise â€“ lighter in tone than Humbug, it still had some pretty psychedelic moments and saw the band letting rip with a couple of monster, 70s era riffs in tracks like â€œBrick By Brickâ€ and â€œDonâ€™t Look Down Cause Iâ€™ve Moved Your Chairâ€.\n\nItâ€™s that direction that the Arctic Monkeys have explored fully on AM and in doing so have found a sound that, while it borrows heavily on 70s rock is still so distinctly theirs that itâ€™s no wonder the new album is topping charts the world over.\n\nSick Tracks\n\nIt starts slow, deliberate, hand-clapping, bass drum thumping beats, there is space, fucking football fields of the stuff, they let it breathe, they are in absolutely no rush to blow your fucking mind. Thatâ€™s â€œDo I Wanna Know?â€\n\nAnd sure, why not drop everything except the bass, drums and vocals for half of the second verse? It fucking works because Alex Turner is one of the best crooners in rock music today â€“ fact.\n\nâ€œSo have you got the guts? / Been wondering if your heart’s still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts / Simmer down and pucker up / I’m sorry to interrupt it’s just I’m constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss youâ€¦â€\n\nFrom there they land â€œR U Mine?â€ like a fucking sucker-punch right to the teeth. Matt Helders lands drum beats and fills like H-bombs, Jamie Cook and Turner wield their axes with brutal precision and donâ€™t get me started Nick Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s menacing bass guitar, itâ€™ll give you goosebumps brother. Itâ€™ll haunt you in your favourite worst nightmares.\n\nBut again, that fucking space, galaxies of it. So much room in the track, they donâ€™t give a fuck about trying hard, they arenâ€™t out there to ram 160bpm monstrosities down your throat. They play the right notes at the right times. Itâ€™s simple and it fucking works.\n\nBut itâ€™s when the song reaches the 2:30 mark that it finally hits home that Turner and pals arenâ€™t here to fuck around. Everything cuts out except Turnerâ€™s vocals. Everything. How many rock bands are doing that in the second fucking track on the album?! NONE of them have the fucking stones to even think it, let alone make it so.\n\nThe payoff when the band drops back in is so goddamn beautiful itâ€™ll leave you grinning from ear to ear, nodding your head, tapping your feet and saying â€œFuck yeahâ€¦â€\n\nâ€œOne For The Roadâ€ (one of two tracks that the band collaborates with Josh Homme on) creeps, slinks and haunts at every bend. The subtle guitar-picking melody in the second verse will come back to you the next time youâ€™re out late, headlights burning through the darkness, nothing but broken thoughts for company.\n\nThen thereâ€™s â€œArabellaâ€, sexy as hell, everything beautiful and dangerous in the world rolled tightly into a psychedelic ballad, brought to life by Turnerâ€™s exceptionally fucking brilliant lyrics.\n\nâ€œMy days end best when the sunset gets itself behind / That little lady sitting in the passenger side / Itâ€™s much less picturesque without her catching the light / The horizon tries but itâ€™s just not as kind on the eyes.â€\n\nâ€œI Want It Allâ€ is a track The Black Keys wish theyâ€™d written. Turner trades his baritone for a falsetto and knocks it out the fucking park. The solo in this song rips through the ether like a comet, leaving a trail of fiery debris streaked across the night sky.\n\nThey innovate with â€œFiresideâ€, they trip out on â€œWhyâ€™d You Only Call Me When Youâ€™re High?â€, they throw a piano into â€œSnap Out Of Itâ€ for an instant timeless classic rock song with a hundred times more swag than the legal limit and they tie it all back together with the slow, sultry â€œI Wanna Be Yoursâ€ â€“ a perfect closer to an album that is like nothing you will hear this year, or the year after that, or the year after that.\n\nShould You Give A Shit?\n\nFor the love of all that is holy, buy this album. Itâ€™s the OK Computer of the â€˜10s.\n\nHereâ€™s â€œI Want It Allâ€:\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\n\n-ST\n\nI tell ya, Iâ€™ve been putting this fucking post off for a good two weeks now while everyone else’s top 50, 20, 10 and 5 lists have been flooding the Twittersphere.\n\nAnd no, itâ€™s not because I wanted to suss their lists first to make sure mineâ€™s not crap, itâ€™s because there were so many great albums that landed this year I donâ€™t know where the fuck to start.\n\nIn the end, I followed the tried and tested method of sorting my iTunes library by year and scrolling down whilst mentally jogging through all the albums I listened to this year, yielding the following scientifically accurate resultsâ€¦\n\nNUMBER 10 â€“ Deerhoof (Deerhoof Vs Evil)\n\nWhat quickly becomes apparent when listening to Deerhoofâ€™s 11th album is that for all its chaotic bursts of noise and bizarre musical twists and turns, this band has the kind of musical talent that borders on genius.\n\nThis album will confuse the shit out of you the first time you hear it. However, Japanese frontlady Satomi Matsuzakiâ€™s bubblegum-pop perfect vocal delivery and guitarist John Dieterichâ€™s ability to write effortlessly catchy guitar riffs will have you coming back for more.\n\nIf you like your music irreverent, unpredictable, catchy as hell and severely tripped out you wonâ€™t be able to put this album down. Hereâ€™s â€œSecret Mobilisationâ€ to give you a taste:\n\nNUMBER 9 â€“ Foster The People (Torches)\n\nYes, yes, I know. How could anyone who considers himself a serious music critic endorse a band that produces such blatantly unapologetic indie pop?\n\nIâ€™ll admit that Foster The People is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine, but yâ€™know what?\n\nSometimes I just want to listen to catchy singalong tunes that donâ€™t send me spiralling into a vortex of existential angst and introspection, is that a crime?!\n\nTorches is packed full of great hooks, clap-your-hands-and-dance-around carefree summer melodies and chorouses that bounce inside your head for days.\n\nHereâ€™s the video for â€œDonâ€™t Stop (Colour On The Walls)â€ â€“ you HAVE to watch this, itâ€™s brilliant!\n\nNUMBER 8 â€“ Cults\n\nContinuing in the indie pop vein (donâ€™t worry, this list grows some big hairy balls later) the Cultsâ€™ debut self-titled album also impressed.\n\nThis band borrows sounds from traditional 50s teen prom-pop, doo-wop and surf rock, laces them with a heavy dose of reverb and samples of cult leaders speaking to their followers and then wraps it all up in frontlady Madeline Follin’s high-pitched cantopop style vocals.\n\nWhich is a very convoluted way of saying this band writes simple melodies, sick hooks and killer songs that are seriously easy to get into and carry just enough weight to not be completely dismissed as indie pop fluff.\n\nHereâ€™s the video for â€œAbductedâ€, the opening track on Cults. Oddly enough, it also features a lot of driving. Starting to pick up a trend hereâ€¦\n\nNUMBER 7 â€“ Taxi Violence (Long Way From Home)\n\nThe only SA band to make it on the Tigerâ€™s list! Yeah, I need to sink my teeth into more local musicâ€¦\n\nLong Way From Home features re-written, acoustic versions of old favourites like â€œThe Messâ€, â€œDevil â€˜n Pistolâ€ and â€œThe Turnâ€ which sound like theyâ€™ve been taken apart and completely rebuilt from scratch. And of course, Taxi Violence threw in one or two new tracks written specifically for the album.\n\nItâ€™s a refreshing change from your stereotypical acoustic album where most bands just swap electric guitars for acoustic ones and serve up warmed up leftovers thinly disguised as an album actually worth listening to.\n\nTheir acoustic rendition of â€œHeads and Tailsâ€ is particularly noteworthy, as is â€œLong Way From Homeâ€ with its upbeat, bluesy / rock flavour played with bright, jangling guitars and tambourines that reminded me of some of the earlier Supergrass albums.\n\nTo give you a taste of what Iâ€™m banging on about, hereâ€™s the SICK video they shot for â€œHeads Or Tailsâ€, which recently won the Best Video Award at the 2011 Wirral International Film Festival.\n\nNUMBER 6 â€“ Seasick Steve (You Canâ€™t Teach An Old Dog New Tricks)\n\nI met my buddy Seasick Steve when I was down in the dumps earlier this year and we became great buddies.\n\nSee, olâ€™ Seasick knows how bad things can get, before he made it he used to busk in the Paris Metro, only finding fame in his late fifties.\n\nThis guy is the real deal, from his frazzled grey soup-catcher to his beaten up John Deere cap and dungarees, he is everything that is badass about old-school blues.\n\nHe has a voice like an old grizzly bear and can change it up from the low, lonely, slit-your-wrists ballad Iâ€™m about to play you to foot-stompin, redneck country and western tracks that bring words like â€œyeee-haw!â€ and â€œhootenanny!â€ to mind.\n\nI just think heâ€™s fucking cool. Iâ€™ve got a soft spot for old veterans like my pal Seasick. He attributes his recent success to his cheap and weather-beaten guitar â€œThe Trance Wonderâ€ which he bought off a friend of his in Mississippi who later revealed to Seasick that it was haunted.\n\nCheck out this video of the olâ€™ grizzly bear playing â€œBurninâ€™ Upâ€ at SXSW earlier this year and dig his outburst at 2:18. What a badass.\n\nNUMBER 5 â€“ Yuck\n\nMy favourite debut album of the year and irrefutable proof that, like a gigantic, spindly cockroach surviving a nuclear apocalypse, the 90s will never die.\n\nThis band packs all the distorted, wailing guitar fury of bands like Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr and the playful, foot-tapping basslines of the Pixies topped off with a fuzzy vocal tone Pavement would be proud of.\n\nBut thatâ€™s not what made this album shine for me.\n\nWhat made it shine lies in this bandâ€™s seemingly effortless ability to write melodies that soar with breath-taking dexterity above the tracks that make up this self-titled debut.\n\nOne part fuzzy, wah-pedal driven slacker indie rock and one part slow-burning, melody-driven alt rock worthy of old school Smashing Pumpkins / REM, Yuck carries a powerful emotional gravitas that blazes a trail through lesser bandsâ€™ attempts at redefining one of the defining decades in rock music history.\n\nSimply put, this album is everything that was great about 90â€™s garage / grunge low-fi reimagined in the 21st century.\n\nHereâ€™s â€œGet Awayâ€ so you can hear for yourself what makes this band great:\n\nNUMBER 4 â€“ Arctic Monkeys (Suck It And See)\n\nArctic Monkeys made a name for themselves by perfecting the art of writing gigantic, energetic hooks and hammering them home effortlessly a talent that the band exploited extensively in their first two albums.\n\nThen came Humbug, one of the first albums I ever reviewed on this site and with it, a complete departure from the sound they had carved out for themselves in Whatever People Say I Am, Thatâ€™s What Iâ€™m Not and Favourite Worst Nightmare.\n\nThey enlisted Josh Homme from Queens Of The Stone Age to produce Humbug and with his help their sound changed almost completely from infectious indie to dark, moody desert rock in a move that showed there was so much more to this band than any of us could have guessed.\n\nSuck It And See continues in the desert rock vein this band carved out with Homme, but this time around, the band has moulded that sound instead of copy / pasted it and as a result, sound a lot more comfortable than they did on Humbug, as phenomenal as that album was.\n\nKiller tracks like â€œAll My Own Stuntsâ€ with its cowboy twang and insidious bassline and â€œDonâ€™t Sit Down Cause Iâ€™ve Moved Your Chairâ€, the most powerful desert rock anthem on the album, are balanced out by the caustic wit and beautiful melodies of tracks like â€œReckless Serenadeâ€ and â€˜The Hellcat Spangled Shalalalaâ€.\n\nIt has a lot of meat to it, plenty to sink your teeth into and it gets better with every listen.\n\nHereâ€™s â€œDonâ€™t Sit Down Cause Iâ€™ve Moved Your Chairâ€, one of the most tripped out videos Iâ€™ve seen this year.\n\nNUMBER 3 â€“ Foo Fighters (Wasting Light)\n\nThe album thatâ€™s been KILLING everyoneâ€™s top album lists this year finds a comfortable spot at number three on the Tigerâ€™s list because Dave Grohl is a total fucking badass and Wasting Light has to be one of the best albums the Foos have put out since my personal favourite One By One.\n\nThis time around the band threw all the modern new-fandangled methods of recording out the window and went 100% old school.\n\nThe band literally set up a studio in Dave Grohlâ€™s garage and did Wasting Light on brown analogue tape that they then cut together by hand using fucking razorblades for godâ€™s sake!\n\nThe result is an album of raw, aggressive, skull-fuckingly powerful rock music that pulls no punches and takes no prisoners.\n\nâ€œBridge Burningâ€ will make you thrash around the room like an idiot savant who just hit a bong and downed a pint of rubbing alcohol, â€œRopeâ€ has the catchiest, most badass Foos chorous riff since â€œLowâ€ and â€œWhite Limoâ€ is sheer, hedonistic rock music at itâ€™s most awesome.\n\nJust watch this fucking video. It stars Lemmy from MotÃ¶rhead for godâ€™s sake! How fucking badasss is that?!\n\nNUMBER 2 â€“ The Black Keys (El Camino)\n\nNarrowly missing the top spot on this yearâ€™s list are the current reigning champions of the American 70â€™s blues / rock revivalist movement, The Black Keys with their 7th studio album El Camino.\n\nUnlike itâ€™s predecessor Brothers, El Camino moves at a blistering pace â€“ no slow-burners on this foot-stompingly infectious, monster hook-laden album, no sir. This time around the Keys have dialled things up to a whole other level and the results are nothing short of sublime.\n\nFrom the rusty guitar riffs and insanely catchy chorous of â€œLonely Boyâ€ to the righteous, sleazy grooves of â€œSisterâ€ and the almost Zepplinesque prog rock ballad that is â€œLittle Black Submarinesâ€, the Keys pull no punches in this noteworthy follow up to Brothers.\n\nAnd donâ€™t even get me started on â€œGold On The Ceilingâ€, which emerges like a mutated Thin Lizzy track bursting at the seams with hand-clap percussion, skuzzy organs and a pre-chorous that sounds like it was written specifically for strip club scenes in Robert Rodriguez films.\n\nSo why not list this as my top album of 2011? As I stated in my original review, El Caminoâ€™s only downfall is the fat that, at 38 mins, itâ€™s a little on the lean side in comparison to Brothers, which is basically the only thing I can fault on this album.\n\nThere just isnâ€™t enough of it.\n\nStill though, itâ€™s a sick, sick, sick record â€“ hereâ€™s â€œLonely Boyâ€ to prove that fact.\n\nNUMBER 1 â€“ The Kills (Blood Pressures)\n\nAgain, I refer to my original review of this, my favourite fucking album of 2011, because it perfectly captures what I think of this album:\n\nWhen I stumbled on The Kills latest album Blood Pressures, I got one minute into the first track and started grinning from ear to ear.\n\nSome of this had to do with the dark and dangerous sound of guitarist Jamie Hinceâ€™s Hofner played in all itâ€™s bone-rattling glory. This man has perfected a grimey, thick-as-tar tone that had me hooked from the get go.\n\nBut what really mind-fucked me was how sinister and cool frontwoman Alison Mosshartâ€™s vocals sounded â€“ like butter wouldnâ€™t melt on her tongue, like she was everything sexy and dangerous in this world, like she could kill you with a look or break you with a smile.\n\nThe Kills is her band, her little broody-beautiful world that she shares with guitarist Jamie Hince and thereâ€™s something about the fuzz and the mud and the malevolence and the majesty of it all that haunted me and continues to haunt me with every listen.\n\nâ€œYou Donâ€™t Own The Roadâ€ saunters like a drunk cowboy waving his six shooter with the safety off, â€œDNAâ€ stalks purposefully through the woods at dusk, picking its way through an undergrowth of drumsticks clattering against drumsticks whilst wading through a quagmire of swampy basslines.\n\nâ€œBaby Saysâ€ has the melancholy of a Cowboy Junkies track, a lilting melody to keep you company in the hollow hours before sunrise, a song that echoes back to better times.\n\nBut â€œFuture Starts Slowâ€ is still my favourite. Stark, defiant, sexy, it has a drum track that plays like a striptease and one of the simplest, most powerful riffs Iâ€™ve heard in a good long while.\n\nI got a dark streak a mile wide that this album really speaks to but that doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ll love it anywhere near as much as I do.\n\nIf nothing else, itâ€™s a great example of how simple, stylised riffs (played with truckloads of badass fuzzy effects) layered with amazingly complex drums and sultry, provocative vocals can seduce you to the point of infatuation.\n\nIf you want to know what the music playing in the jungles of my Tiger-mind sounds like, get your hands on this album and if youâ€™re anything like me, pretty soon itâ€™ll be playing through the jungles of your mind too.\n\nHereâ€™s â€œSatelliteâ€ to sink your fangs into.\n\nThat about wraps it up for my top 10 albums of 2011, a post thatâ€™s been THREE DAYS in the making, can you fucking believe it!?\n\nSo yeah, any comments would be appreciated â€“ what albums rocked your guysâ€™ world in 2011?\n\n-ST\n\nIs this going to be an unbiased, objective review based on irrefutable, well-researched facts? Fuck, no! I love the goddamn Arctic Monkeys!\n\nBut if itâ€™s any consolation, I know every album this band has ever recorded like the village drunk knows the sidewalk outside his favourite tavern so I can at least assess their latest offering having done my homework\n\nThe Down Lizzo:\n\nArctic Monkeys made a name for themselves by perfecting the art of writing gigantic, energetic hooks and hammering them home effortlessly.\n\nThen came Humbug, one of the first albums I ever reviewed on this site and with it, a complete departure from the sound they had carved out for themselves in their first two albums.\n\nThey enlisted Josh Homme from Queens Of The Stone Age to produce Humbug and with his help their sound changed almost completely from infectious indie to dark, moody desert rock and God knows! I fucking love desert rock\n\nDid they like the direction Homme guided them in? As dark and compelling as it was, were they happy with Humbug?\n\nGive Suck It And See a listen and itâ€™s pretty damn obvious that the answer to those questions is undoubtedly â€œyesâ€.\n\nSick Tracks\n\nThe first time around â€œBrick By Brickâ€ with its simple chord structure, dirty guitar licks and harmonious chorous is a winner, but after repeated listens the lyrics and Turnerâ€™s vocal lines get a little weak.\n\nâ€œI wanna steal your soul / Brick by brick / I wanna rock and roll / Brick by brick / I wanna rock and roll / Brick by brick / I wanna rock and rollâ€ are definitely not his best lines which is a pity because itâ€™s a great song otherwise.\n\nâ€œAll My Own Stuntsâ€ on the other hand, though itâ€™s strikingly similar to â€œPotion Approachingâ€ off Humbug is a great track. It has a cowboy twang to its chorous and a bassline that moves insidiously beneath the surface lending the song a powerful menace that Turnerâ€™s vocals compliment perfectly.\n\nâ€œDonâ€™t Sit Down Cause Iâ€™ve Moved Your Chairâ€ is the most powerful desert rock anthem on the album, a great and wasted track that comes on like a bad peyote trip and peaks like the cleanest MDMA you ever tasted.\n\nThere is more, much more. This album has a lot of meat to it, plenty to sink your teeth into and it gets better with every listen.\n\nShould You Give A Shit?\n\nGive a shit my friends, give more than a shit. Give two shits because while I have yet to decide if this is their best album to date (Humbug will always have a soft spot for me) itâ€™s a spectacular effort from a band that I have the utmost respect for.\n\nHereâ€™s â€œAll My Own Stuntsâ€ to play us out. Take it away boys.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10"
