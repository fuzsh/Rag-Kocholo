        "text": "Mark Lanegan\n\n“Bubblegum”\n\n(2004, Beggars Banquet)\n\nBio/Press sheet\n\n“People know who Mark Lanegan is, in the underground,” says Josh Homme, vocalist-guitarist-leader of Queens of the Stone Age. “ But EVERYONE should know who Lanegan is. Cuz he’s got a voice that you don’t get. It’s a gift from when you’re born. You can’t learn it.”\n\nDoing their part to let the people know, Queens of the Stone Age invited Lanegan to permanently join their band in 2001, giving them three distinctive vocalists at their shows and on their worldwide hit album, 2002’s Songs for the Deaf. For Lanegan, being a QOTSA “auxiliary member” was a fun, paying gig that allowed him to hang with creative friends and sing to audiences in the thousands again, as he had in the circa-‘92 “Nearly Lost You”/Singles heydaze of Screaming Trees, the now-legendary Seattle rock band he fronted from 1983 through the mid-‘90s. Of course, it’s never been about the money or the crowds alone…\n\n“I think if you work in music, something brought you to it, and it wasn’t the hope of making a million bucks,” he says from his pad in the Echo Park district of Los Angeles. “It was just the love of music. I don’t know why, I just was born that way. When I connected with music, it was in a big way and it’s never stopped. I don’t understand people that music isn’t essential for.\n\n“When I saw pictures of the New York Dolls and the Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop in Creem, and heard the Sex Pistols and Damned and Pere Ubu, within a week I had traded in all my Howard the Duck and Silver Surfer comics for credit on used records. That was it. And I was the only kid I knew that listened to that music til I was a junior in high school. I lived in a town in eastern Washington State, where everyone was into whatever was on the radio. They didn’t even know who Jimi Hendrix was, and he was born a hundred miles away. To get more records, I would tell my old man that I was going to stay for the weekend with friends, then take a Greyhound bus to Seattle 150 miles away, nine bucks each way, walk to three or four different record stores, buy records and come back.\n\n“I’m just as excited today about records as I was when I was a little kid. I have been blessed with the opportunity to make records. Who wouldn’t take that opportunity if presented with it, y’know? There’s been plenty of times when I wanted to make records and wasn’t able to, so I take every chance.”\n\nThe Lanegan discography includes seven albums on SST, Sub Pop and Epic with Screaming Trees; luminous appearances on tribute records to Skip Spence, the Kinks, Tim Buckley, Willie Nelson, Lee Hazelwood and Junior Kimbrough (forthcoming); and five haunting solo albums on Sub Pop, recorded during the Trees’ frequent hiatuses, that were considerably quieter than the Trees’ recordings.\n\n“With the Trees, 90% of it was rock song and then the rest of it was kinda quiet songs, so when I started making solo records, it was the opposite,” says Lanegan. “Why? For the hell of it, because I could, I dunno why. But Bubblegum is more like…well, for one thing everybody contributed, which has happened on a couple of these so-called solo records. My idea was I wanted to make a record of songs with the guys that over the years have been my favorite guys to work with.\n\n“I worked on it over a long period of time, but the amount of time actually spent on it was not that much. I did it in between engagements with the Queens, and it’s only recently that I’ve had the time to finish it.”\n\nWith its extremely varied sound and squadron of co-stars, Bubblegum is a departure from Lanegan’s previous solo records, which were generally spare, acoustic-oriented affairs. It’s also very much a product of Lanegan living in Los Angeles, and working with local musicians in a situation quite different from the one he experienced in Seattle during the grunge-chic era.\n\n“Seattle was a very small town where you couldn’t help but know everybody, or know of them, but as far as my personal friends, I just had a couple that were in bands and they were amongst my closest friends…but it wasn’t like there was a gang. As far as the other bands and so-called ‘scene’ there? Honestly, when all that shit was going on, I wasn’t there. I was on the bus. I had my couple of friends I saw when I was off the road, and that was that. My band was like a really massively dysfunctional family, with strife and nuttiness and shit at all times: always craziness, a lot of turmoil.\n\n“I’ve lived in Los Angeles about eight years. I like it here a lot. It definitely helps me to have sunlight—it makes it possible for me to get up and do stuff. I just can’t handle the consistent grey. I went back up there to Seattle for a little while when I first lived here, and it was overcast for 97 straight days. At the end of that, I was just out of my mind. One night I said I gotta get the fuck out of here. I didn’t have any money or anything. [Soundgarden bassist] Ben Shepherd bought me a plane ticket that night, and I never went back—except to play.\n\n“This ‘scene’ that’s going on here [around Los Angeles] is a really insulated scene. The guys from the desert and the guys in the Queens, it’s more like a private club. With these guys, they’re having fun, it’s a lot of laughing, a lot of being creative and enjoying it. Doing things because you want to not because you have to. Josh [Homme] and Nick [Oliveri, recently dismissed QOTSA bassist/vocalist], they’re really restless creatively and all they really give a damn about is writing songs that we can get off on. Everybody has their own shit that they’re doing but we really just like playing with each other, so when one thing has cooled down a little bit then it’s time to go do the other thing. It’s a good deal.”\n\nThe lineup alone on “Methamphetamine Blues,” Bubblegum’s fourth song and the lead track on last year’s brilliant, underheard Here Comes That Weird Chill EP, shows this all-for-all spirit: the song features two Queens (Homme and Oliveri), two earthlings (Dave Catching and Molly McGuire, also of Mondo Generator), two Eleven’ers (Alain Johannes and Natasha Schneider), one Afghan Whig/Twilight Singer (Greg Dulli) and one Caustic Resin guy (Brett Netson) assembling an industrial dub teethgrinder unlike anything Lanegan has been associated with before. “Methamphetamine Blues” and seven of the album’s other tracks were recorded in 2002 at sessions with Chris Goss of Masters of Reality co-producing.\n\n“I’m a huge fan of everything he’s done,” says Lanegan of Goss. “I can hear a little piece of Goss in almost everything that I’ve done since I first heard the first Masters of Reality record. I’ve just nicked tiny tiny things from him here and there over the years, without trying to. Out of all the guys I know, I’m probably the biggest rip-off of him.”\n\nThe two pair for vocals on the album’s loveliest song, “100 Days.”\n\n“I am a big fan of Nina Simone, and I was just trying to write the kind of song that I thought that she would do—this was before she died—and of course it ended up being—what’d Goss call it?—‘Sinatra as junkie.’”\n\nHomme appears on five tracks, Oliveri’s on two, the world-famous Smilin’ Dave Catching is on seven, guitarist Dimitri Coats of Burning Brides is on two. Guns N Roses’ Izzy Stradlin and Duff do backup vocals on “Strange Religion” (says Lanegan, “It’s sort of like having Keith Richards and Johnny Thunders singing”), and two songs prominently feature Polly Jean Harvey: “Hit the City,” a straight-up rock song with Harvey singing backing harmonies, and “Come to Me” is a sad-eyed, come-hither duet.\n\n“I know her from Queens shows, she’s a fan,” explains Lanegan. “She approached me one night and told me that she really liked another record that I’d done and as usual I used that opportunity to say, Well you got to to do something on my new record. I always wanted to do a song like ‘Come to Me’ and to do it with her was… What could be better?”\n\n“Morning Glory Wine” features singing by Eleven’s Alain Johannes, who co-produced the closing four tracks on Bubblegum. “That one started when I was in Italy and me and Evan Dando were in a hotel room, late late at night, playing and singing folk songs and stuff, just goofin’ off. I finished it a couple days later. Didn’t think about it for a while then I showed it to Alain while we were looking for stuff to do and he dug it, and so we just recorded it really fast. I made him sing on it cuz I love his singing. It was kind of a forgotten tune. I didn’t think a whole lot of it, but I like it now too.”\n\nLanegan’s music evokes darkness, rather than wallowing in it; death, disappointment, loss and failure are facts to be artfully addressed, with a certain stoic elegance and dignity. Again and again, Lanegan returns to these subjects.\n\n“I’ve talked about this with other guys that write songs, I would love to write a feel-good by-the-pool summertime-type of song, if I could. I’ll keep trying to write that kind of song too because that’s also a kind of song I like to listen to, y’know? To be able to hit all ends of the spectrum would be nice. But for me, right now, this album is as close as I’ll get…\n\n“When I’m listening to music that might have something in common with the music I make, I find it comforting, I find it uplifting in a way. Not depressing. That’s just the music I connect with. I think that when people do connect with that kind of music, it ends up being a positive experience.”\n\nThe Mark Lanegan Band will be touring from August through January in support of Bubblegum. Lanegan is also three-quarters through completing an eagerly-awaited album of songs with Greg Dulli, and is working on a record of duets with Isobel Campbell of Belle & Sebastian. He is rumored to smoke three packs of cigarettes a day. Does he have an endorsement deal yet?\n\n“No,” he says with a chuckle. “But I’d definitely have more money if I did. It’s actually around two packs a day. If I’m staying up 24 hours a day then I might smoke three. But I’m usually sleepin’…”\n\nJay Babcock\n\nMay 25, 2004\n\nLos Angeles"
