        "text": "OffHeGoes132 wrote:\n\nPersonally I love all of the Screaming Trees work, but I will admit that it took me a little while to get into their earlier stuff, mainly because the recordings were so low budget. Now though, Invisible Lantern has grown to be one of my fav Trees albums. Songs like Lines & Circles, Night Comes Creeping, and Grey Diamond Desert are golden. In fact, if Lanegan \"covers\" another one of his own songs again on the next Soulsavers album, I want it to be a quality recording of Grey Diamond Desert. Simply an epic, beauty of a song that really showed off his \"younger\" sounding vocals for the first time.\n\nAnd eyedclaar, I got into Lanegan by listening to the Trees first; it took me a while to get into his solo stuff. But I agree with you; once you listen to the solo stuff a few times, learn the music and lyrics, and really 'listen' to his vocals, you finally see the passion and genius (IMO) behind his work. Discovering Lanegan's back catalouge was as great to me as discovering Soundgarden's. And that's sayin' something...\n\nSoonForgotten2 wrote:\n\nYeah, I was talking to Shawn Smith about Lanegan several months back. He used to see him wandering about locally in Seattle in a bad, bad way. I doubt Mark would still be without if he hadn't gotten clean. And thanks! I will, for the first time ever!!\n\nSoonForgotten2 wrote:\n\nYeah, it was prior to a pub gig over here. It's just someone who'd know. And the new Brad isn't so new. It's been finished for... must be going on two years now. Essentially, it's in Stone's hands. It probably will never see the light of day.\n\nRhinocerous Surprise wrote:\n\nI think he left QOTSA because he found it hard to stay clean when he was on the road with them, not because he was addicted again. Strange as it may seem, it looks like Mark and Greg are the two quietest people on the Gutter Twins bus when they're touring, staying in and watching sports while the others drink and party. I just hope Mark keeps up the trend of hanging with people who keep him healthy.\n\nMagnet Magazine wrote:\n\nEventually,Lanegan and Oliveri became inseparable on the road, bonding over coffee and playing improptu acoustic gig at record stores along the way. Oliveri was booted from Queens in 2004 after excessive partying and the alleged physical abuse of his girlfriend; Lanegan asked to leave the the band's touring lineup the next year,citing \"health issues\" and need to record another solo album. \"He was unhappy with the lifestyle,\" says Lanegan's ex wife, musician/actress Wendy Rae Fowler,who met him in 1998. \"He went into that [spring 2005 tour] clean and sober, and came out of it very not.\"\n\nHomme is understandably vague when asked about indirectly encouraging Lanegan's self-destructive behavior. \"Mark's always struggled with pushing down his bad side because it's big and it's bad,\" he says. \"Shit, it's been hard for me because I never wanted to discover Mark not being on this earth anymore.\n\nThank god he's like a cockroach and can't be killed.\n\nsgossard3 wrote:\n\nwow... great quote :rolleyes:\n\njosh has always struck me as the fratty d-bag type (probably why QOTSA appeals alot to those types - no offense, im a fan too) but that pretty much proves it... take some accountability and do what you can to keep your \"friends\" clean... its fuckin stupid to sit around waiting for them to O.D.\n\ni would love to see mark play with a band as heavy and dark as queens again though... hopefully he can do it without falling back into bad habits\n\nI really do think Josh cares about Mark's health - I mean, they've been friends for upwards of 10 years, through Mark's rehabilitation. I don't think Mark would have stuck with Josh if he thought it'd just keep him on heroin. More likely, the kind of crowds QOTSA attract - backstage, in the afterparties, wherever - are more likely to push drugs on you than, say, the kind of crowd Isobel Campbell runs with."
