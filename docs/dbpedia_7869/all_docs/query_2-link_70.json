        "text": "After a nine year hiatus SUN AND SAIL CLUB are back and theyâve come back swinging! This album is more aggressive than the previous album, as if that was even possible. Same line-up as before featuring Scott Reeder (FU MANCHU/SMILE) on drums, Scott Reeder (KYUSS/THE OBSESSED/FIREBALL MINISTRY) on bass, Bob Balch (FU MANCHU/SLOWER/BIG SCENIC NOWHERE/YAWNING BALCH) on guitar and Tony Adolescent (THE ADOLESCENTS) on vocals. The album starts with a mellow jazz guitar piece and then proceeds to rip your face off until the end of the album, which closes with another solo jazz guitar piece. âShipwreckedâ is their strongest album yet. Fully realized and to the point. Fast and dissonant.\n\nâThis album is a compilation of riffs collected over a nine year period. Most of the songs were written last year but some of them have been floating around for a while. There is a general sense of unease throughout. I wanted to make an album that went one step further than âThe Great White Dope.â The songs are faster and more intense at times. Itâs basically the soundtrack of me beating the shit out of my guitar. Then you factor in Scott Reeder on drums, Scott Reeder on bass and Tony Adolescent on vocals and youâve got something more than I could have imagined by myself. This album is raw and pummeling. If youâre a glutton for punishment this might be your desert Island record.â - Bob Balch\n\nRecorded at Jim Monroeâs The Racket Room, Casa De Balch, and Scott Reederâs The Sanctuary\n\nMixed by Jim Monroe\n\nMastered by Tony Reed at HeavyHead Recording Co\n\nREISSUE of Sun And Sail Club sophomore album in brand new coloured vinyls.\n\nThe name might be the Sun and Sail club, but you'll find no yacht rock here. Instead of Michael McDonald, we have Bad Brains. Kenny Loggins? Hall and Oats? More like Matt Pike and Lemmy Fucking Kilmister. âThe Great White Dopeâ is featuring members of Kyuss, Fu Manchu, and the Adolescents, containing 10 riff-filled tracks of high energy, bullshit-free punk and sleaze. The song writing on âThe Great White Dopeâ steers away from the experimental direction of their previous release, and it's laser focused on one thing: unapologetically rocking your face off. The vocoder is gone and they've recruited singer Tony Adolescent, who delivers balls to the wall vocals with no added effects or frills. The production, like the music itself, is loud, heavy, and beautifully simple.\n\nâThis record is a direct result of my wife telling me she was pregnant with our son. As a first time father, panic set in and I wrote the album in two hours. I wasnât sure if Iâd have a lot of time once he was born so I crammed as many frantic riffs into one album as possible. Looking back itâs funny to listen to now, but at the time I was on a mission. Everyone killed it on this record and we recruited Tony Adolescent on vocals which is unreal to me.â - Bob Balch\n\nâWith Saltpigâs debut album, Mitch Davis takes a dark journey into occult themes and horrific storylines dancing around melodic yet dissonant layers of noisy guitars, overdriven bass and floating drums. The album forgoes the expected fuzz sounds for a palette of tones that largely disregards genre in order for Saltpig to build songs that are simply evil and completely human. Itâs fully embracing a love of distortion and feedback in all forms while pushing tape to its breaking point. The band plays with different tempos and tunings as a way mostly to keep things interesting for themselves, creating what feels akin to a greatest hits album where the songs take on different personalities but feel completely like Saltpig songs at the same time. They find influences from early Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate and Black Sabbath at a time when metal was still finding its way. Rewind to an era before metal began its evolution towards greater precision, bigger drums and more robust production, then imagine that evolution taking a different turn. Mitch tries to put himself in that place where metal might be today if things had gone that different direction. Itâs neither nostalgic for the way music used to be, nor is it trying follow any trends of today. Itâs really more of a âmake the music we want to hearâ than a purposeful innovation. While familiar, it doesnât quite fit neatly into an existing metal sub-genre. The idea was always âdonât try to be like other bands, but donât be different just for the sake of being differentâ. The result is an album that means a lot of different things to different people. But to Saltpig, they are just making music.â\n\nGEEZER\n\nAs the \"Interstellar Cosmic Blues\" half of this EP, we consider these songs to be some of the best that we've produced. Songs that could all be \"singles\" all on their own. And they better be because \"The Riffalicious Stoner Dudes\" brought some savage riffage of their own! Put it all together with amazing artwork by Mirkow Gastow and release it on Heavy Psych Sounds, the BEST record label on the planet... and you've got all the makings of a great record! A modern classic right out of the box. Dig it!\n\nSongs 1 & 4 Recorded and Mixed by David Andersen at the Artfarm (Accord, New York)\n\nSongs 2 & 3 Recorded and Mixed by Chris Bittner at the Applehead Recording (Woodstock, New York)\n\nAll Songs Mastered by Scott Craggs\n\nISAAK\n\nArt comes from change and experimentation.\n\nThese three songs are exactly that.\n\nThree songs, three different souls.\n\nThis recording session is born from the collaboration of some friends invited by the band, and these are:\n\nFabio Cuomo from Gotho & Liquido di Morte - THE WHALE\n\nFabio Palombi from Nerve & Burn the Ocean - CRISIS\n\nAnd last but not the least, Levre from Ufomammut - FLAT EARTH\n\nRepress of Child EP âIâ in brand new coloured vinyls and for the first time in digipack.\n\nâIf youâre familiar with CHILD and are particularly a sucker for the keyboard, Iâm afraid Iâve got some bad news: Itâs mostly gone. Fear not, though, as their fuzz-infused blues is alive and kicking and is sure to continue to appeal to a lot of fans of different genres.\n\nThe three songs follow as their lengths increase, starting with âAge Has Left Me Behindâ, clocking in at 03:47 and ending with âGoing Down Swingingâ, a 10:20 jam which definitely raises the temperature and which Iâm confident will be talked about for a long time.\n\nIn-between, one can find âThe Other Songâ, which is not just another song, but a sublime cover of Spiritâs âThe Other Songâ, originally released as part of the album âSon of Spiritâ in 1975. A great tune started only by Michael (drums) and Danny (bass), to whom Mathias and his guitar join after around 20 seconds, and later with a lovely vocal melody which stands throughout the whole song â the less fuzzy song of the EP but definitely a pure beauty (so is the original).â - More Fuzz\n\nPsychodrama is Tigers on Opium debut full length.\n\nA structured form of therapy in which a person dramatizes a personal problem or conflict, usually in front of a group of other therapy participants. The other participants usually take part in the drama, though each performance focuses on a single person's concerns. The goal of psychodrama therapy is to work together in a group to achieve a better understanding of past traumas and the influence they can create, the members must feel willing to work together.\n\n\"When I came across the idea of psychodrama therapy, I started to think about how we have so many joint experiences as a society that currently happen or have happened, and how they shape both our singular and collective consciousness. Music has always been a form of therapy for not just me, but a massive amount of the people in the world. I started to conceptualize this as an idea for the album, thinking that we all have so many connections to major/micro events in time, and generally similar interpretations of them. Like the idea of a psychodrama therapy session, I started to envision how the songs could play out about these different moments... Almost like vignettes or snapshots of life, with the song playing the role of the individual, and the listeners playing the role of the group.â Juan Carlos Caceres\n\nThe album PSYCHODRAMA explores various psychological and social experiences that have shaped our cultural evolution. Occultism, Propaganda, Atomic Warfare, Media Consumption, Religion, Social unrest, Nostalgia, Mental Struggle, Pop Culture, Revolution, and Change - are all themes explored throughout the album. Out via Heavy Psych Sounds on March 1st 2024.\n\nGuitarist Bob Balch here. Most of these recordings go back to 2021. Two tracks are from late 2020. One track is from 2018. Usually the way we record is we get together and jam and then edit the jams down to songs afterwards. All of the songs on the album were constructed that way, except for â100â âBleed Onâ âSummer Teethâ and âSara Smile.â\n\nâ100â and âBleed Onâ are riffs from Gary Arce and myself jamming in Red Barn studios in Joshua Tree. We did those after tracking his guitars for âThe Long Morrowâ off the last record. âSara Smileâ is a Hall And Oates cover. That one I structured at home and had musicians play on it after the fact. We are beyond stoked to have HALL AND OATES keyboard player Eliot Lewis guest on it! âSummer Teethâ is a song I had from before we even started the project. The same guitars were used on the recording that are on the demo. Per Wiberg from OPETH and SPIRITUAL BEGGARS played keys on â100â and âSummer Teeth.â Gar from Red Barn studios played lap steel on â100â as well. We also added guitar loop transitions from Reeves Gabrels from THE CURE and DAVID BOWIE. Everything else was recorded at Gatos Trail, HeavyHead studios and my home. Mixed and mastered by the very talented Tony Reed. We hope you enjoy this one!\n\nRecorded at Gatos Trail, HeavyHead, Red Barn Recording Co., Casa De Balch, Jim Monroeâs Racket Room and Red Barn Studios.\n\nMixed and mastered by Reed at HeavyHead Recording Co.\n\nBob Balch from FU MANCHU here. The idea for the SLOWER project started around four years ago. I was teaching a student how to play âSouth Of Heavenâ by SLAYER but she was a beginner so we slowed it down. I thought that sounded cool so I tuned down to B standard and tried it. I added some drums and thought âsomeone in the doom community should do this and name it SLOWER.â\n\nA few years later I befriended Steven âThee Slayer Hippyâ Hanford, best known for his work as the drummer in the influential Oregon punk band Poison Idea. He was backstage at a FU MANCHU show. Oddly enough I was wearing a POISON IDEA shirt and he told me that my shirt sucks. I asked who he was and why he was in our backstage. He told me and I felt stupid. We started drinking whiskey and talking about music. We stayed in touch over the next year or so and during Covid I told him about my SLOWER idea. He asked me to send him tracks. I waited too long because the day I sent the tracks he passed away. Totally tragic. Iâm glad I got to know him even for a few years. He was a monster musician with a giant heart.\n\nHe will be greatly missed.\n\nI shelved the project for a while after that. One day Esben from MONOLORD posted about musical collaborations. I love MONOLORD so I thought what the hell. I sent him some tracks and he killed it on drums. So I sent more. Then more. Shortly after that we started reaching out other musicians to get them involved. Thatâs how we ended up with this lineup. Everyone that contributed completely knocked it out of the park and I canât thank them enough.\n\nThis project has been a long time coming and Iâm beyond stoked on how it turned out. Without all of the players involved, Steven Hanford and my baritone Reverend guitar it wouldnât have happened. Thanks to everyone involved and I hope you dig it! Iâm a giant SLAYER fan so itâs been a treat to dig into these classic songs. Hopefully we can do another record in the near future. Look out for shows because they will happen!\n\nEsben Willems - When Bob first approached me with the idea and I heard his scratch guitars, my first thought was âThis is geniusâ. Those iconic tracks we all know by heart suddenly unveiled an unexpected dimension. Iâm really proud of how this turned out.\n\nPeder Bergstrand - âThis might be blasphemous considering the circumstances, but when Bob reached out and asked if Iâd want to play bass on sludged-out Slayer covers, I had to admit some of these tracks were brand new to me. That made the experience even more special though, hearing and playing on the Slower version first, and then comparing to the original. Bob has really transformed these songs into something totally their own, and on a personal level I feel the rest of the bandâs insane performances pushed me to my most inspired playing to date.So incredibly stoked for people to hear this album.â\n\nSIDE ONE\n\nA Moment Expanded (A Form Constant)\n\nThis is sort of a parallel piece to âDreaming with Eyes Openâ from Volume One. This is another totally improvised jam like the other songs. Although, I took this one back home and changed my guitar tones a little using different delays and reverbs. The overall piece of music remained the same though.\n\nSIDE TWO\n\nFlesh Of The Gods\n\nThis was actually the first song we tracked during the session. Just getting a feel for how we all played together as a band. I think it turned out awesome considering that. The main melody came quick and like the other tunes this one surfaced easily.\n\nPsychic Aloha\n\nThis tune is the only song on the album that features any synth. For that reason there is a lot of different synth sounds as the song progresses. I overdubbed the synth parts after the fact but the other instrumentation remained untouched from the original jam.\n\nCREDITS\n\nRecorded at Gatos Trail and engineered by Dan Joeright.\n\nMixed and Mastered by Kent Stump at Crystal Clear Sound.\n\nArtwork and layout by John McGill\n\nLogo by Pia Isaksen\n\nâIn under two years since the release of their debut LP Ultra, Kadabra has earned a reputation as a captivating and explosive live act through âpassionate stage presence drawing you into their own world with lengthy, mesmerizing, songs building from a slow boil into full crescendos.â\n\n- Brian Lopez, New Noise Magazine\n\nThe band formed during the dark days of 2020 and were quickly signed by Heavy Psych Sounds, who released Ultra in the fall of 2021 and established the bandâs penchant for delivering crushing doom riffs and haunting vocals accentuated by bursts of psychedelic flair and swampy Americana swagger. And while the chemistry of long-time friends Garrett Zanol (guitar/vocals), Ian Nelson (bass) and Chase Howard (drums) was apparent upon listening to their debut, their bond was further strengthened by relentlessly touring the western United States and completing a month-long tour of Europe.\n\nThe trio almost immediately began looking forward, road-testing and crystalizing the songs that would comprise their follow-up, which found the band reuniting with Ultra producer Dawson Scholz. The result is Umbra: a singular statement that is more focused and cohesive than its predecessor, while managing to capture the immersive, free-flowing experience of their live show. Umbra is set to release on October 6 via Heavy Psych Sounds Records.\n\nFor fans of: Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats and Dead Meadow!!\n\nâI had just got off the road and went right into the studio out in the desert at Rancho de La Luna. I was living in the house just behind at the time making sessions super convenient. I was set to record with my band the Bros in a couple weeks but I decided to go into the Rancho early and get some sounds. Tony and I ended up recording a bunch of songs that I was writing on the fly. A week later the Bros showed up and we recorded another batch of songs with the band playing live in the front room. After we wrapped I combined both my solo session and the Bros session and released in as one record called Saved By Magic on my label Duna records. That was 2005.\n\nNow Iâm rereleasing this record on HPS and Iâve decided to separate the two sessions into their original bodies of work. My solo session and the Bros session. I mostly did this because I feel the Bros deserve to have something of their own as they were a magical band. I also just thought it would be cool. I call both records Saved By Magic Again.â\n\nNew album cover by Maarten Donders.\n\nRemastered by John McBain !!\n\nâI had just got off the road and went right into the studio out in the desert at Rancho de La Luna.

Dave had just left Unida and Alfredo Hernandez was in town and had just left Queens of the Stone Age. I had a rare bit of downtime from touring with Fu Manchu. The three of us started jamming at the house. I had just got over a bad relationship and songs were pouring out of me. Frank Kozik heard about us jamming and called me up and said he wanted to put out whatever we come up with. Within two weeks we were already recording on an 8 track reel to reel. I took the recording to brother Shneebie to mix in LA. He said the music is great but the recording is shit. He asked to re-record it. I asked when? He said now. We re recorded right there on the spot and finished everything in 2 days. We decided on the name CHE and called the record Sounds of Liberation. â\n\nBob Balch here. In November of 2022 I went out to Joshua Tree for a day of jamming with the guys in Yawning Man with the intention of calling it âYawning Balch.â No riffs were planned. We just plugged in and played. The only discussion beforehand was that Gary Arce and I wanted to mess with tons of guitar pedals. I knew that while we were jamming it sounded great, but it wasnât until I got home and listened to it all that I realized we had something special. Itâs hard to believe that we jammed for five hours and got two full length LPs and then some out of it. Every player killed it on these recordings and Iâm beyond grateful to have my name involved with this legendary band. Fingers crossed they invite me back out annually for more jam sessions. I hope you enjoy these jams and please use responsibly.\n\nDab City is an ode to the purest form of THC and our beloved hometown of Madison Wisconsin, which is known as Mad City. A political and social hot bed and lightning rod for our state and the Midwest since the 1960's, Madison is also home to a large University with one of the best agronomy departments in the country and not surprisingly the focal point for some of the finest cannabis our country has to offer(Muleboy has not seen pot with seeds in it since arriving in 1993!)Although not legal, possession is basically ignored and punished with a nominal $1 fine for under 128 grams.\n\nFor the recording of dab City we procured 10 g plus of the finest concentrates we could lay our hands on and somewhere north of 120 g of cannabis flower. And recorded it on 2-in analog tape over two sessions at Future apple tree Studio in Rock Island Illinois. Fall 2022 session is known as the Harvest Sessions and the February of 2023 session is known as the Propagation Sessions. The record is our 2nd as a three piece and our second full length release for our label Heavy Psych Sounds and continues our journey into ultra stoned sludgey psychedelia.\n\nDab City is 100% recorded on Tape, and is composed by 7 songs with a running time of almost 60 minutes of brand new Stoned Sludge Heavy Doomy Riffs.\n\nAfter the amazing success of this debut, we decided to reissue the release in new coloured versions and 2 brand new bonus tracks!!!\n\nGabriele Fiori -- already frontman of Rome-based outfits Black Rainbows and Killer Boogie and a key figure in Europeâs heavy underground as the head of the Heavy Psych Sounds label and booking agency -- was not exactly lacking for things to do. And yet, a couple years back, The Pilgrim started to nebulously take shape as an idea for a solo-project, something different than the hard-driving psychedelia and garage heavy rock for which heâd already been so revered.\n\nIt wasnât until Jan. 2018 that he really got to putting songs together, but the end result on Walking into the Forestis a space-folk release with a personality unto itself. Songs like opener âPeace of Mindâ evoke some of Fioriâs more rocking side, while âSunset in the Desertâ feels like an ode to the acoustic album Kyuss never made, and side B, which starts with the Hawkwind cover âBrainstormâ and ends with the moody strum of âSuite #2â -- originally from Void Generatorâs 2004 debut EP; when Fiori was in the band -- hones a cosmic drift and textures that nonetheless remain accessible and organic thanks to their acoustic foundation.\n\nâThe main point in common with Black Rainbows is the diversity of the songs,â Fiori explains. âYou have mind-dreams like âDragonflyâ or âSailor,â or the more folk rock âPeace of Mind,â passing through space with âThe Time You Waitâ and the melodic-melancholic âWhen I Call Your Name.ââ\n\nIn completing the arrangements, Fiori turned to Black Rainbows drummer Filippo Ragazzoni, and as he says, âSongs came out so spontaneously and easy. I always played acoustic guitar and wanted to push further on this path. The songwriting, rehearsing and recording approach was so different from usual Rainbows or Boogie style, both to me and Filippo for drums, because all the instruments needed to be played smoothly, softly.â\n\nThe fantastic and dreamy artwork has been accomplished by Marteen Donders The recordings has been realized in Rome at Nero Studio on a fantastic 70's SSL mixing console during the fall 2018 The Mix and the mastering been doon at JD Studio by Pino Santamaria, same engineer who mixed several Black Rainbows albums\n\nWith Walking into the Forest, Fiori evokes a sound that is both classic and fresh, melodically rich and creatively constructed. It is a new outlet for Fiori that demands spiritual as well as auditory engagement, and an all-things-permissible sonic context that one can only hope The Pilgrim continues to explore.\n\n- JJ.Koczan\n\nAs we write this, it's hard to realize the long road weâve traveled to get to this debut full length.\n\nWe started rehearsals 5 years ago with absolutely no ambitions. We were without bands at the time, both cranking amps and slaying drums at the local rehearsal space, so it felt only natural to jam together. Nobody could have guessed what was about to happen, âcause after we decided to join forces, all hell broke loose. People were storming the rehearsal room triggered by the massive wall of sound and were shocked to discover it was just the two of us who were responsible.\n\nWhile shows were growing at a fast rate, we started finetuning the âTankZilla soundâ. It's still hard to describe, but the term âstoner blues swamp boogieâ got most of it covered.\n\nNot long after, we were invited to perform at the almighty Roadburn festival where we released our first 7 inch.\n\nFast forwarding through the pandemic, we finished writing a dozen songs, eleven of which we captured on our first âseriousâ recording.\n\nAnd here you have it. Recorded in Belgium, no Dutch beers involved, no fillers, no fancy stuff. Just the result of true & pure rockânâroll style recording sessions.\n\nWe are very proud to present to you our first full length. Put it on and crank the shit up âcause this one goes to eleven!\n\n2023 REPRESS of the Nightstalker's album.\n\nThe legendary stoner rockers are back! One of the first bands of the genre present their 8th album after their first EP (SideFX) back in 1994 (the grunge rock era). This time the album hits directly to the soul. 8 new tracks which are different to each other, combining groovy parts with heaviness and melodies. The guitars are still heavy but spacey and psychedelic at the same time. The bass is always groovy with intense playing. All together with a lot of catchy melodies and the power of Argyâs vocals are the secret of the music of Nightstalker. Raw rock 'n roll simplicity, stunning riffs and electric haze are what have kept the band going for more than 20 years. Produced by Nightstalker again and this time it is recorded and mixed at âWreck it Sound Studiosâ. Listening to Nightstalker you can figure out why Greece is the perfect country for stoner rock bands and why the Greek stoner scene is one of the greatest worldwide.\n\nFor fans of: Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Monster Magnet, Kyuss\n\nREPRESS of the highly acclaimed Acid Mammoth album.\n\nâCaravanâ is the bandâs upcoming third full-length album. It is the direct successor to last yearâs âUnder Acid Hoofâ and the fourth release of the band with Heavy Psych Sounds Records. It was conceived, recorded and produced during a state of total lockdown due to Covid-19, therefore it greatly reflects our mood during these dark times. It is a heavy, sublime and pitch black journey into the vast unknown. Like all of our previous works, âCaravanâ was recorded, mixed and mastered with Dionysis Dimitrakos of Descent Studio in Athens, while drums were recorded at Ignite Studio. The artwork was once again crafted by Branca Studio. It is a witchy album for witchy ears, a heavy opus that has emerged straight from the deepest abyss.\n\nOnce again the father and son duo on guitars offer the listener a horde of crushing, fuzzy, Iommi riffs while the mammoth bass tears down everything in its path with its acid hooves. Its drums are thundering unearthly beats of harrowing doom while its mesmerizing vocals will bewitch you with their words of woe. Heavier and more diverse than its predecessor, âCaravanâ is here to tear you down with its acid tusks. Prepare to be doomed!!!\n\nâCaravanâ is coming out March 5th 2021 by Heavy Psych Sounds Records.\n\n\"Acid Disorder\" is the latest astonishing work of the neo-psychedelia acid-rock riffers GiÃ¶bia. The Italian quartet focusses its inspirations in 8 wonderful tracks as varied as homogeneous and fluid sounding, which result in a full-length album pleasantly rich in atmospheres and textures. The eclecticism of the songs and their exotic flavor are rendered by the use of certain ethnic instruments - we can clearly recognize sitar and saz binding in an intriguing dance with vintage organs and synthesizers. Such a fascinating mixture gives the band its own hallmark that makes it unique and recognizable among thousands.\n\nâAcid Disorderâ easily engages even the most demanding listener. We can hear certain kraut rock influences a la Amon Duul and Ash Ra Tempel which lead us to float in the cosmos towards new unexplored dimensions and reconfirm the purely space-rock taste of the band and its inclination to sci-fi soundtracks charm and mystery.\n\nWith this surprising album GiÃ¶bia invite us to enter their realm, that hidden place in the depths of their mind where anything can happen. Once again we abandon ourselves to altered states of consciousness, enchanted by the lysergic side of a music that is both familiar and new.\n\nâAcid Disorderâ was recorded at Elfo Studio in Piacenza, Italy, between March and October 2022. Engineered and mixed by Daniele Mandelli and Bazu. Mastered by Giovanni Versari at La MaestÃ Studio. Cover album and artwork realized by Trevor Tipton.\n\nBorn from the murky industrial depths of Birmingham, UK, Margarita Witch Cult's self-titled debut studio album is a tour-de-force in classic metal, hard rock, doom, and mind-melting psych.\n\nA thunderous drum fill propels you into opener 'Diabolical Influence'- a lurching behemoth of a tune that makes easy bedfellows of crushing stoner riffs, Latin incantations, and a simply humongous chorus. The pace quickens with the frantic 'Death Lurks at Every Turn'- a hair-raising thrasher of breakneck snare rolls and unruly guitar solos. 'The Witchfinder Comes' only furthers the sense of foreboding, as tales of torture and pleas for exile fall on the ever-deafening ears of the listener. 'Be My Witch' comes in hot and heavy as a grungy ode to the forbidden, and the blistering 'Annihilation' concludes side A with speed-freak ferocity. The more adventurous and immersive side B is kick-started with 'Theme From Cyclops' - the deft chops of all 3 members being undeniable as we gallop into the ambitious, face-melting journey that is 'Lord Of The Flies'-a belting doom groover that culminates in a classic guitar & bass dual to rival even the most virtuosic of axe-wielders. As we near the end of our perilous sonic expedition, 'Aradia' serves up an instrumental serving of pure downtuned filth, with sleazy swagger and tasteful shredding that give extra provenance to its author's deep bag of tricks. The killer blow comes in the shape of the simply savage 'Sacrifice'- an unholy exhibition of undeniable force. The duality of the track makes for an experience that leaves our sweet listener reeling- the bludgeoning weight of its monstrous main-riff giving way to razor-sharp verses and a tripped-out, mind-bending psych jam- only to come crashing back to crushing reality as the final, fatal notes ring out.\n\nWith their debut LP, Margarita Witch Cult have crafted a timeless, merciless beast- one that will chew you up and spit you out, yet somehow keep you crawling back for more.\n\nLife Is Much Stranger\" is the mind-blowing 4th studio album from NYC heavy rock trio The Golden Grass and it stands tall and wild, towering above their entire previous discography! It is a massive and epic sonic adventure, a post-modern collage of rock n roll ideology, swelling and bursting with hard, heavy and progressive musical energies...the past is inside the present...and The Golden Grass are moving the sound FORWARD!\n\nIt has always been the goal of the group to connect the dots between their influences, to reconcile disparate vintage ideas that perhaps never coexisted in their original place and time! To give life to a NEW artistic vision that synergizes them together like a warm blanket, both familiarly ancient and cosmically NOW! And with all of that sonic information of the past, not to mention a healthy dose of great taste, The Golden Grass concoct their magick brew and are able to conceptualize and materialize music in such a particular way that it screams timelessly from long ago, but could only happen IN THIS VERY MOMENT! Life IS much stranger after allâ¦.\n\nThis album was conceived over the past several years, through chaos and confusion, during a global pandemic that forced the band to work in new/unconventional ways they had never before imagined. The music on this album has never seen an audience. These songs have never been performed. And in fact, the recording of the album was the first time the members of the group even understood what their new creations sounded like! The initial writing sessions began in the summer of 2019, but were obviously halted in early 2020 due to the situation. Over the next two years, the band did their best to move forward with the process but rehearsals were infrequent, sickness and health threats always barking at the door, and a constant unknown of what was to come; was there any future for their art at all?...But slowly and disjointedly, they assembled their musical ideas into 7 rough pieces that would soon comprise âLife Is Much Strangerâ.\n\nFrom Sept-Oct of 2022, the group worked with a team of engineers across three studios in NYC, recording and mixing the tracks, sculpting their rough song-forms into polished, yet quite surreal, glistening gems! And when they emerged with a finished product, the bizarre and strange events of the previous 3 years all melted into a perfect picture, a complete totality, crystal clear, wholly avant-garde and spellbinding! âLife Is Much Strangerâ is an amalgamation of hard rock boogie, jazzy progressive rock, psychedelic exploration and incendiary proto-metal all bursting with soulful harmony-layered vocals, masterful instrumental technicality and an otherworldly creative ambitionâ¦and it sounds FUCKING GREAT! Recommended for fans of DUST, CAPTAIN BEYOND, THE PRETTY THINGS, JO JO GUNNE, TRAFFIC, DEMIAN, HIGHWAY ROBBERY, T2, ICECROSS and HARD STUFF!\n\nHeavy Psych Sounds is reissuing the Yawning Man legendary album Historical Graffiti in brand new coloured vinyls.\n\nHistorical Graffiti is the bandâs fourth full-length, out in 2016.\n\nGary Arce, the guitarist, seems comfortable sitting on a single vamp throughout the opener âThe Wind Cries Edalynâ, allowing the additions of violin and bandoleon accordion (played by the tango musicians Sara Ryan and Adolfo Trepiana, respectively) to weave melodies in between. Despite the titular connection to the Jimi Hendrix song, it bears no discernible resemblance to âThe Wind Cries Maryâ and it is a deceptive number; what seems such a simple, almost easy-listening song reveals more colour with every listen.\n\nâHer Phantom Finger of Copenhagenâ is slightly darker and almost sounds, with the slight distortion on Arceâs guitar, as if it could have come from Pot Head, the EP the band released in 2005. Mario Lalli, the bass player, begins the third song, âNaomi Crayolaâ with a throbbing single note, aided by Bill Stimsonâs metronomic drumming. Imagine if Can grew up near the beach, itâs that sort of vibe. The only problem with the song â and the album, as it happens â is that it is too short.\n\nRyanâs violin returns in âThe Secret Language of Elephantsâ, this time playing the role of keeping the main vamp alive while Arceâs guitar generates an evocative soundscape that opens in your mind a wide, violet sky like that above a desert the moment after the sun disappears for the night.\n\nThe closing song and title track is the most free of the five on the album, with Stimsonâs beat conjuring memories of Kyussâs more mellow moments from Welcome to Sky Valley, Lalliâs bass marking the simplest of bottom ends and Arce having a ball over the top.\n\n(taken from the band's Bandcamp)\n\nOnce again Brant Bjork is back with a wonderful new album âBougainvillea Suiteâ !!\n\nHeâs never missed a shot in the last 20 years. His discography is connected by an imaginary line which crosses different sounds and melodies, but always with the same attitude. In the background you can imagine the Mojave desert where everything started many years ago, but his last record sounds fresh as his debut Jalamanta! Brant says about this album: âThis is a bitter sweet record for me. So much change in my life. Some stuff more positive than others. But itâs always a blessing to be able to make a record and get the music out and to the fans. This is the last record to be recorded in my Joshua Tree studio. Iâm saying good bye to an era and looking down the road toward new beginningsâ\n\nâBougainvillea Suiteâ is composed by 8 songs. Produced by Yosef Sanborn and Brant Bjork. Recorded at The Rad Cabin, Joshua Tree, CA.\n\nEngineered and mixed by Yosef Sanborn.\n\nNew Sun was born right after the release of third album Sick Sad Love in november 2019. Soon the postmodern plague hit the world and Stiu couldnât play anymore shows than the one sold out release show in Stockholm. When we started making the music our guitarist Nicklas Bargell & i took turns playing drums & we made some stuff as a trio. A new drummer came in & lots of music was made. New Sun was recorded by the band in our own studio Shadow Kingdom & mixed by our drummer Christian Augustin together with the rest of us. It was mastered by long time collaborator & friend Magnus Lindberg.\n\nArtwork was as always made by our bassplayer Kalle Mattsson. This time we kept it all in the family.\n\nMusically we dig deeper into the ground on which we are standing & things go in a few different directions as on all our albums.\n\nSome words from Jessica Mengarelli on her lyrics:\n\nâThe lyrics spring from a sense of desperation and acuteness, they are an expression of how it feels to be driven by restlessness, to be flung between euphoria and resignation, to crave presence, to give up to indifference, to feel trapped in the grip of old experiences. They try to process the different ways I've been dealing with those emotions.â\n\nNemesis Lately is the second full-length album released by Somnus Throne. This LP is very much a continuation of their first album(Burning World Records 2020), but with much more attention to detail, a further exploration of the depths of each niche within 'doom,' and a greater variety of sounds. Think just as much heaviness as the first album with less drone and more action. Nemesis Lately goes everywhere across the landscape of doom, stoner, heavy psych, and grunge from a welcoming kick in the teeth by a Motorhead-esque first track, through shades of Acid King, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Black Angels, The Melvins, Dead Meadow, High on Fire, The Sword, Electric Wizard, Dopelord, Black Pyramid all the way to a concluding track that strives at echoes of Led Zeppelin's acoustic prowess. It goes without saying that the entire album, and the entire Somnus Throne catalogue in total, is never more than one decapitated bat away from Black Sabbath worship. In sum-total, this album is truly a smorgasbord of all things fuzzy, doomy, smokey, sleepy, and trippy while also managing to grasp the essence of each sound -- perfect for anyone ready to doom, space, fuzz, head bang, tune in, turn up, and trip out for the next 40+ minutes.\n\nThe year 2019 marked significant changes for Baltimore psychedelic-doom trio, Black Lung. Following the release of their third album, Ancients, guitarist and founding member Adam Bufano amiably departed the band and in November 2019, was replaced by guitarist Dave Fullerton. Just four months later, the reconfigured trioâs plans for touring in support of Ancients were canceled as the world entered COVID-19 lockdown. It was time to reconcile their touring ambition with the reality that live music was effectively shut down indefinitely. In the existential dread, loss and uncertainty of the global pandemic, with the backdrop of malignant fascism and cultural enmity in the USA, Black Lung began writing the songs that would comprise their next record. There is no question that Dark Waves, Black Lungâs newest release via Heavy Psych Sounds Records, was conceived in hostile times. Dave Cavaliers lyrics reflect this hostility. Songs like âThe Cogâ and âMad Kingâ lament the weaponized ignorance of the propagandized American citizen, while âAwakenâ and âThe Pathâ muse on escapism and the false protection of dreams. On the title track, âDark Wavesâ, the band channels this mood of bitterness through their instruments, as a meditative bridge is slowly transformed into a foreboding storm front centered around Dave Fullertonâs hypnotic guitar melodies.\n\nDespite the apparent darkness, Dark Waves is not a cold or desolate sounding record. The band leaps forward from their previous releases with warmer, brighter sound crafting and more audacious songwriting. There are passages with a tangible sense of jubilation and excitement, as the band members revel in the recording process after more than a year of uncertainty and frustration. While in some ways Dark Waves offers a departure from prior Black Lung records, the band stays true to their roots in doom and psychedelic music, delivering eight songs packed with the frenzied, fuzzed-out guitar breakdowns, booming drums, and soulful vocals that longtime fans will appreciate. The decision to bring bass guitar prominently into the mix on Dark Waves adds new levels of depth and heaviness to Black Lungâs songs, which may be the albumâs most notable and exciting development. Underpinning everything about Dark Waves is the band's decision to shed conventions and their ability to adapt to change. For Black Lung, making it through these dark times meant reflecting on the past while pushing forward without knowing what the future may hold. The result is a record that sees Black Lung rising to new sonic heights. Dark Waves is set for global release through Heavy Psych Sounds Records May 27th, 2022.\n\nFor fans of: All Them Witches, Queens of the Stone Age, The Flying Eyes.\n\nGeezer itâs a rare band that finds its sound so engagingly, and with Stoned Blues Machine, the sixth Geezer LP, they once again build on their accomplishments, working with producer Chris Bittner at Applehead Recording in Woodstock, NY, to harness the bandâs most expansive production to date.\n\nA vivid and bombastic album, Stoned Blues Machine is Geezerâs response to the last few tumultuous years. Much of the subject matter deals with the fear, the literal and metaphorical isolation revolving around the pandemic, the resulting political turmoil, the disintegration of truth and decline of a shared, common good.\n\nThe album that will see them return to Europe for the first time since 2017 and serve as their second release for Heavy Psych Sounds is yet another example of what can be done with classic songwriting in imaginative hands. Stoned Blues Machine puts the emphasis on the bandâs dynamic and the joy of playing and writing songs together â more as a unit than ever â and shows that even amid some of the darkest hours, you can always say screw it, go get high and cruise the cosmos.\n\nREPRESS of the Josiah fourth album in new coloured vinyls !!!\n\nNew remastered version!!!\n\n\"Those whoâve experienced Josiahâs groove-heavy swagger know that itâs the guitar of Mat Bethancourt in the starring role, but this trio relies almost as much on the backing rhythms on Procession. Blink and youâll miss the first two tracks, âProcessionâ and âBroken Doll,â both of which are under two and a half minutes, but for the other three cuts of studio material (âThirteen Scene,â highlight âDying Dayâ and the more garage rock âDead Foreverâ), itâs just as much Beacom and Beasleyâs show as it is Bethancourt's. That would be the end if not for the five live tracks from Josiahâs Swedish run in 2007. Four out of the five â âLooking at the Mountain,â âTime to Kill,â âSilas Brainchildâ and closer âI Canât Seem to Find Itâ â come from the bandâs final recorded full-length, No Time, and only âMalpaso,â reaches back further, having first appeared on the 2001 10â Out of the First Rays. Not that we needed it by this time, but these live versions are basically just further confirmation of what underground rock lost with Josiah. The crash-heavy shuffle blues of âTime to Killâ alone are worth whatever theyâre asking for Procession.\"\n\n- The Obelisk\n\nREPRESS of the Josiah third album in new coloured vinyls!!!\n\nNew remastered version by Stefan Koglek (Colour Haze).\n\nLike a long lost British heavy rock classic from 1970 on the Vertigo label. Josiah has that sound down cold. Think Sabbath, Motorhead, Uriah Heep, and Josiah! These guys rock hard and take no prisoners, and it's just three of them. The songs are potent slices of that point in time where the harder they rocked, the better the world was for it.\n\nEchoes of days long gone, when prog rock didn't have that name yet, and the established heavy metal sound was still a decade away. Josiah is certainly capable of shredding with the best of them, and the compositions have enough sharp corners, labyrinths and switchbacks to keep it interesting all the way through. Vocals are powerful and commanding, always dead on key and right in your face.\n\nAdd to it all some authentic sounding late 60s/early 70s production, and there will be no doubt about it: You've gone back in a proto metal time machine.\n\n- Expose\n\nWild Wonderful Purgatory is Karma To Burn second album. Is their first fully instrumental album after the departure of former vocalist Jay Jarosz and it was released in 1999 by Roadrunner Records.\n\nAfter more then 20 years this piece of stoner rock history will have a new repress in coloured vinyls via Heavy Psych Sounds.\n\nHeavy metal has, too often, been a case of great music, shame about the singer. Itâs been true since the cod-poetic warblings of erstwhile-hippy cock rockers, right up to the present-day offerings of sad white boy pseudo-rappers. So hats off to Yank rockers Karma To Burn, who had the sense, the taste and the balls (donât forget the balls) to part with their tiresome vocalist, minutes before an important London gig... Wild Wonderful Purgatory is their first album in this new incarnation. And it rocks, hard.\n\nTracks are numbered rather than titled, in the order in which they were recorded. So â32â is the slaughterhouse groove characterised by the wildfire barbed wire guitar breaks; â25â is the slothful Sabbath grind; â30â the colossal, feral beast with all the ferocity of a Rottweiler which has been chained up and fed nothing but raw, red meat for weeks.\n\nIf thereâs an overall stoner-rock vibe to the proceedings, then it is tempered by Karma To Burnâs discipline: not a single note is wasted, and thereâs no big-haired egomaniac chundering artlessly along to distract you from the hypnotic beauty of the riffs. Sniff out the testosterone, strike that match, and stand well back.\n\n- NME\n\nIn 1997 Karma To Burn released their self-titled debut album on Roadrunner Records.\n\nNow in 2022 Heavy Psych Sounds is repressing this legendary release in brand new coloured vinyls!\n\n\"Dirty, fat 70âs Sabbath riffs coupled with brooding, eerie vocals generate a foreboding atmosphere that is Karma To Burnâs distinct and excellent 1997 self-titled debut. Any forays into their subsequent releases may be met with disappointment as they are almost entirely instrumental, more one dimensional and lacking atmosphere. The 90âs saw a 70âs Sabbath inspired Stoner Rock and metal grooves and blues movement. Karma To Burnâs sound is most reminiscent of C.O.C and Down. Whilst Kyuss take you on an odyssey through the desert and beyond, Karma To Burn ventures underground and explores the darker side of humanity. This is a flawless album which moves effortlessly from track to track with each song containing seamless transitions between light and shade. Karma To Burn remains a laid back journey with an underlying seediness and tension as you take in an array of sights from the criminal underworld and serial killers to wild sex parties, and then onto Ancient Indian Burial Grounds. This is what the music has evoked in my mind anyway.\"\n\n- Sputnikmusic.com\n\n\"We're delighted and excited to still be here in this wonderful scene after 15 years last times has been though for all of us cause of the fucking pandemic, but looks like we're almost back!\n\nWe wanted to double celebrate this moment with the 15 years anniversary of our first album and the recording of the first live set after the pandemic!\n\nHope you will enjoy the combi!\"\n\n- Gabe from Black Rainbows\n\nBlack Rainbows comes back with the recording live of the first show after the pandemic strike!\n\nThe band recorded the album at Desertfest Belgium in Antwerp at Trix club delivering almost 45 minutes of high energy heavy psych n roll.\n\nTrix was one of the last shows the band played before the covid strike back in early march 2020 and they start back at the very same location in the same room one and half years later ...so the band thought this epic moment needed to be celebrated and put on a record as first live album ever!\n\nThis album feature 9 songs total and two are brand new tracks!!! : \"Fire In The Sky\" and \"Desert Sun\" two songs which are never been released before in any previous album!\n\nMixed and mastered by Shane Trimble\n\nAtomic Ritual is the Nebula 3rd full lenght released in 2003. Produced by Chris Goss (Queens Of The Stone Age, Kyuss) at Lawnmower Studios. Heavy Psych Sounds is proud to reissue this gem in brand new coloured vinyl versions.\n\nâStoner rock? Bonghit metal? Old school hard rock? Call it what ya want, but it is clear from the first 3 seconds of Nebulaâs Atomic Ritual that these guys have been listening to a lot of Hawkwind! Droning, heavy, fuzzy and flat-out rockinâ as fuck, Nebulaâs latest slab is more conceptual than their previous effort, but no less pulverizing. Produced by Master of Reality (and Queens of the Stone Age/Kyuss mentor) Chris Goss, Atomic Ritual is the bands most layered, bold work to date and finds them veering closer to the headfuck ethos of early Monster Magnet than the indie classic rock they ventured into on their Sub Pop effort. The title track and âOut Of Your Headâ are just pure space rock, while âCarpe Diem,â âSo It Goesâ and âMoreâ balance out the cosmic slop with some hooks and melody. None of this is gonna get the on the radio, but one gets the feeling they could care less. So be it. All in all, a pleasing way to melt your brain.â\n\n- Frank Meyer\n\nApollo is the Nebula 4th full lenght released in 2006. Heavy Psych Sounds is proud to reissue this album in brand new coloured vinyl versions.\n\nâ'Blues rock' has been invented over and over again and Nebula are the persistent 'stoner' gale though 'Apollo' is only their fourth album in seven years. Labelled under many old styles, Nebula's blasts from the past yet offer more fresh new party crackers.\n\nThe Nebula sound is drenched in oily sonics dug up from Muddy Waters and on 'Apollo', Nebula don't shy away from resemblances among others to Rory Gallagher and Slade. Grunge parents and their children will love this album to bits.\n\nOne of 2006's highlights will prove to be this Nebula track called 'Future Days' from this truly intoxicating 'Apollo' album. Though 'Apollo' is fairly consistent, a few tracks stand out because of the immediate appeal - to be specific that's the 10/10 note down in my book. 'Apollo' is in fact the epitome of retro but the album leaves no room for any further discussions of the past.\n\n'Future Days' features the bleating of sheep melted in to some of the most gorgeous guitar licks of today. Spoiling you with superlatives with good reason; 'Apollo' includes both the method for an off-licence brain surgery as well as the means for a fully registered permit to go ape. You just won't get an easier lobotomy than from 'Apollo'.\n\nThe music may go back 30 years or more but through some magical mystery resurfaces with excellence. If the demand is for blues, rock, stoner or whatever comes off strings, skins and from throats, then Nebula probably play that type of joyful sleaze better than any other band these days.â\n\n- Maarten Schiethart\n\nFrom mountain peak to valley deep, SLEEPWULFâs new album SUNBEAMS CURL is a journey that is dripping with the seductive sounds of riff rock psychedelic proto doom.\n\nConjuring the sounds of bands such as Black Sabbath and Jethro Tull, Sleepwulf have summoned an album that oozes with fuzzy riffs, sordid tales and seductive occultism.\n\nIf the first album was about cycles, this one is about breaking them and its consequences.\n\nSUNBEAMS CURL delves further into the well of ancient mysticism, alchemy and the occult. The underlying thread connecting it all, is the power of words to manifest reality; in both the individual and the collective consciousness. This extends to the album artwork, with hidden optics and codes. Deciphering these will reap their own rewards.\n\nThe album was recorded live in their own woodland studio outside Kristianstad, Sweden. To capture a live organic sound everything was done live onto an old tape machine. This new album is both heavier and more dynamic, building upon every aspect of the last.\n\nThis is an album with hidden secrets which will unravel in the not too distant future.\n\nSleepwulfâs debut album is a bonfire of vintage 70s proto doom sounds that recently set fire to the underground rock scene, managing to gain a #3 spot on the cuvited Doom Charts.\n\nInspired heavily from the work of renowned occultist John Dee, this album attempts to rekindle his vision of a united cosmos. From the stars to atoms and back again, every aspect of the album is rooted in these core principles. These themes also seep into the back cover artwork which was cut from a single piece of paper, with each image representing a song on the album.\n\nTo keep the authentic retro vibe, the album was self-recorded live on tape in their practice room. âIt was a journey to capture the sound we were hearing when we jammed together but after a lot of trial and error, we got there in the endâ.\n\nThe cover art was drawn in the late 70s by the singer's father and left undiscovered in a cupboard for 40 years until shortly before the album was finished. This is an album of cycles and connection, which endeavors to bring the sounds of old into the burning sun once again.\n\nHeavy Psych Sounds is proud to give new life to the HOT LUNCH self-titled debut masterpiece. A new repress with new coloured vinyls !!!\n\nKicking off in prime, amped up MC5 style with âHandy Dennyâ itâs clear that Hot Lunch are out to grab you by the nuts like a pit bull and keep squeezing until this album has wrung you dry. Within the first two songs the band have ripped their way through more riffs that the first two Black Sabbath albums put together and there is no let up from here on in. âRipped At The Seamsâ opts for a tight but loose Blue Cheer style grind with Eric Sheaâs manic vocal delivery evoking John Garner at his most deranged in the early days of Sir Lord Baltimore. Other bands that Hot Lunch tip their hats to through the course of these nine tracks, to varying degrees include the spastic blues of The Groundhogs, the theatrical intensity of The Alice Cooper Band, the raw, soulful blast of Grand Funk Railroad, the explosive crunch of The Who through to the trippy psychedelia of The Doors...albeit without an incoherent drunken pub singer fronting them.\n\nIt isnât all noise though. The epically lengthy âLady Of The Lakeâ displays a level of tenderness with a lightly folky vibe, not too dissimilar to Sir Lord Baltimoreâs âLake Isle Of Innisfreeâ. Thatâs not to say that the bombast is too far away as the band play with a loud-soft dynamic that culminates in a female spoken piece of pure hallucinogenic gibberish that is equal parts ludicrous and genius. By contrast, the brief âShe Wants Moreâ blasts in a fog of boogie that makes Foghat look like Barry Manilow, Shea barely maintaining his breath and composure as he rages through the lyrics. âTragedy Preventionâ, like many of its predecessors pitches from riff to riff with wild abandon and even features what sounds like a Vox Organ to paint extra sonic textures. This is one area in which Hot Lunch excel. They are not bound, in the studio at least, by the constraints of the sound of their equipment and are happy to employ other means which to make their point, such as the Leslie speaker affected vocals on âGold Lyreâ or the Gregorian chanting on the Sabbath meets Misfits vibed âMonks On The Moonâ.\n\n- The Sleeping Shaman\n\nHymns Of The Damned is the follow-up to the bandâs acclaimed Self-Titled debut.\n\nOpens with Shadow In The Night with its steady kick drum intro that recalls Black Sabbathâs Iron Man. The next track Morbid Lust comes and goes, itsâ loud, it rocks but youâd struggle to remember it as it does sound, for the most part, rather interchangeable with other Stoner/Doom bands currently doing the rounds. Thrill Seeker is better, with a sound that would suggest that Hazemaze have been listening to The Cramps, what with the swampy dark sound it conjures. For me, any band that takes its cues from the Psychobilly legends suggests they have an excellent taste in music if nothing else.\n\nThe albums longest track is Solicitor Of Evil, (kind of ironic when you think about it, to any Americans reading this, solicitor means lawyer in the UK) and chugs along at nearly 7 interminable minutes. The track Green River has some nice Nebula influences and helps pique my interest momentarily.\n\nA major criticism of the Stoner Rock genre/sound has been its over infatuation with 70âs retro Hard Rock, Sabbath, Bang, Pentagram, Dust, Deep Purple, you know the names\n\nSo, cutting to the chase, the album is well-played, produced, with fabulous new cover art colors\n\nThe Stockholm trioâs eponymous full-length is just about as good as it gets for all the groove itâs giving. As the record spins, its hypnotic gaze takes us back through the maze of time, surrounding us in the electrically charged haze of the feel good era. It sounds for all the world like this could be a contemporary of Ozzy and the boys, though it never condescends to full-on Sabbath worship.\n\nNo, Hazemaze has found their own way, niching somewhere between the early styles of doom that manifested on both sides of the Atlantic, though I hasten to add âslow, blues-infused hard rockâ might be a better descriptor than straight-up âheavy metal.â That is, unless this exciting release had come out in the seventies. Back then, it would have been considered the epitome of heavy metal, just as Zeppelin and Priest were in teenage years. Capturing this authentic a sound and making it so alive, so vibrant, so now... well, that is no small feat.\n\nTruly, a standout album, especially if youâre as diehard a fan of old school doom as I am. Fresh artistry is fully on display all over Hazemaze Give any one of these tracks a spin and youâll see, though you should be warned (in the words of âBlack Mamba IIâ): âOne bite and then you are gone.â\n\nHazemaze self-titled debut album was recorded in the winter of 2017 in Falun and was engineered by Timmy TernestÃ¥l. It was later released in early 2018, and we are excited to finally release a brand pressing with a new and reimagined artwork, and for the first time ever on cd-format.\n\nBob Balch here. Wanted to let you know about \"The Long Morrow.\"\n\nWe released the E.P \"Lavender Blues\" back in October of 2020. \"Lavender Blues\" and \"The Long Morrow\" are both the result of a three day jam session back in November of 2019. The players were myself, Gary Arce (Yawning Man), Bill Stinson (Yawning Man) and Tony Reed (Mos Generator). We left that session with hours of stuff to choose from. We still have tons to release!\n\nOnce 2020 hit, we started digging into what would become \"Lavender Blues\" with the intention to make it an EP and save the main chunk of the material for the LP which would become \"The Long Morrow.\" Once we released \"Lavender Blues\" Tony Reed and I began digging into the tunes.\n\nAll of the songs were jams at first, just two or three parts and lots of improvisation. Tony started chopping them up into arranged songs and added lyrics and a few changes. That's where we got songs like \"Murder Klipp\" \"Defector\" \"LeDu\" and \"Lavender Bleu.\" I did a few guitar overdubs on them as well to flesh out the parts, but for the most part they are all live takes. I'm surprised that \"Murder Klipp\" came together so easiely that early in the morning. That time signature is bonkers, Bill Stinson had no trouble coming up with a beat that complemented it. I had to take notes and increase my caffeine intake for that one. \"Lavender Bleu\" is a second take for \"Lavender Blues\" hence the title similarity. They were both jams but \"Lavender Bleu\" became a structured song and the second half of it became \"Labyrinths Fade\" from the EP. I got to play bass on \"Defector\" and Tony switched to guitar. \"LeDu\" is inspired by Husker Du and Led Zeppelin. Gary Arce (Yawning Man) planted the main riff ideas for all of those songs on Side One. The dude is a riff machine.\n\nâThe Long Morrowâ takes up Side Two. Clocking in at a little under 20 mins, âThe Long Morrowâ was the very first jam we did during the session. Took us about 30 seconds to fall into a groove and we didnât surface for 30 mins.\n\nI went home and re-recorded all of my guitar parts throughout 2020. I kept the original ideas in place but embellished them a little. After editing it down and changing guitar parts around it was sent to Reeves Gabrels (THE CURE/DAVID BOWIE) and Per Wiberg (OPETH, SPIRITUAL BEGGARS) to add guitars and synth. Then it was sent to Tony Reed (MOS GENERATOR) for vocals, overdubs and structure changes.\n\nMixed and Mastered by the very talented Tony Reed. I couldn't ask for a better production. Sounds just as I wanted to hear it.\n\nWe are super proud of this album, and look ahead into the future as this is only the beginning. If we can create stuff like this the first time jamming together we can only imagine that itâs gonna get better and better! More soon!\n\nIn the beginning, there was chaos...\n\nA while later in the Heavens, where angels reigned, there was once held a great symposium, a glorious feast. Everyone was happy and having a great time, until Lucifer, fairest and mightiest of all the angels, brought in suspicious and strange substances, offering them freely with both hands for everyone to take. All were fooled by the Ancient Serpent, starting to misbehave and act in contradiction to the Heavenly Laws. The Almighty God, enraged upon learning about the mutiny, threw everyone down on earth to suffer eternally in hunger, ugliness and desperation. Vulnerable now to each and every temptation, they are ready to perpetuate Good and Evil, while building their new earthly Kingdom in any way they can.\n\nAngelic chants, Demonâs screams, witches dancing and woeful mortal suffering are recounted in this albumâs songs, embellished with mesmerising hymns and sharp riffs. Chaos is always close and all that remains is the human revolution against the forces of evil.\n\n\"Battlefields of Satan's servants, witch-hunt for our ways, face off reality and eat TV today. Lucifer, Forever Grey\".\n\n- Bill Politis -\n\n\"The Unknown Secretary\" comes to further unsettle the turbulent waves of music and burn its own mark in history.\n\nToday, five years after its original release, Heavy Psych Sounds reissues this retro gem, serving it once again straight into your record case.\n\n20 years on and Out Of The First Rays is still as powerful today. As the band rip straight into \"Head On\" it's clear that Josiah wanted to take heavy rock back to it's opiate drenched roots. Psychedelic lyrics sung with soul and the heavy as fuck grooves laid down across this release owe a debt to Black Sabbath and Monster Magnet. \"Malpaso\" quickly became the bands signature track (featuring on film soundtracks and TV shows) with its pulsating riffs and trippy middle section and \"Spacequake\" makes you start to think there must be something in the midlands water supply, as Bethancourt echoes Ozzy with \"come take my hand my child\" and the Iommi styled guitar hooks kick you straight in the gut. \"Sweet Smoke\" kicks off side B with its Cactus meets Grand Funk early 70's rock vibes. The sonic interplay between the power trio, back the vocals up for this anthem to a burning earth - \"Let the flames just take you higher\". The 10 minute closer \"Black Maria\" with its psychedelic twin vocals and one of the heaviest riffs you'll hear this side of dead, gives way to uptempo bass grooves and a wah drenched lead break. Take another sip of the electric kool-aid baby, before we \"slide down the cosmos\" and fall into the big black sleep.\n\nAcidâs Trip has done it again - high energy rockânâroll with string-bending licks, a touch of soul and a blazing organic beat.This best describes the Gothenburg-based quartet that has taken the timeless sound of past decades to a whole new level. The album \"Strings of Soul\" was recorded during the late summer of 2020 by the band themselves for that hard rock feel and the production was mixed and mastered by genius sound engineer Ola Ersfjord (Honeymoon Disease, Tribulation, Dead Lord etc.). The rock was played and the tambourine is still grooving!\n\nWith past releases like the 12â maxi vinyl âRockÂ´nÂ´Roll Speedballâ the band has generated Shell Shock while delivering top speed live action on any occasion and the debut album âStrings of Soulâ is no exception. 11 exploding tracks filled with emotion, rawness and melodies to bring you on a sonically unforgettable journey that really puts this album on the race track and up the charts!\n\nThe band has already worked up a well acclaimed live portfolio while touring the streets of Europe and this album has really captured the feels of being out on the road while leaving strings of soul for miles on end. This album is like an explosive mixture of Thin Lizzy, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Hellacopters that delivers instant hits like âGet It Rightâ, âNo more fucks â and dubbed favorite by fans âFaster Chopper Boogieâ that will hit you right in the face and straight in the heart.\n\nGet ready to be blown away and down with vibes from the early 70s while blasting âStrings of Soulâ on full tilt boogie! Knuckleheads and motor fanatics, start your engines and may your soul rest in speed!\n\nOn the fringe of chaos, in the Year of the Pandemic, the Cannabeast has awoken!! BONGZILLA is back with a new full length album, 16 years since their last record. These Pioneers of Weed Metal would like to present âWEEDSCONSINâ to the universe. An album written by the three long standing original members of Bongzilla - Muleboy (bass, vocals), Spanky (guitar), and Magma (drums). Recorded and mixed by the late John Hopkins at Future Apple Tree Studios in Rock Island, Illinois in October 2020. The six brand new tracks will blow your mind! In a single instant you are contaminated by the classic Weed-Infected sounds the band is known for, while also finding new elements mixed into the bowl. In the unique piece that is Weedsconsin, Bongzilla delivers heavy doses of Crushing Stoner Doom and Psychedelic Space Rock that sets it apart from earlier material. (Thatâs why HPS Records is the perfect label to release this stuff). This record travels down a path of heavy riffs, mind-expanding jams, sonic tones, and stomping beats in the band's first release as a thunderous three piece, with Muleboy moving from guitar to bass. Approaching these songs as a three piece has created more space musically and allowed the band to showcase their musicianship in a different way. It results in a sound that is very heavy, along the lines of Gateway tone-wise, but sonically more clear. The album is mastered by Carl Saff at Saff Mastering in Chicago, Illinois, and Eli Quinn (Madison, Wisconsin) is the artist behind the astounding new cover art. Weedsconsin is dedicated to the memory of John Hopkins.\n\n\"Caravan\" is the band's upcoming third full-length album. It is the direct successor to last year's \"Under Acid Hoof\" and the fourth release of the band with Heavy Psych Sounds Records. It was conceived, recorded and produced during a state of total lockdown due to Covid-19, therefore it greatly reflects our mood during these dark times. It is a heavy, sublime and pitch black journey into the vast unknown. Like all of our previous works, \"Caravan\" was recorded, mixed and mastered with Dionysis Dimitrakos of Descent Studio in Athens, while drums were recorded at Ignite Studio. The artwork was once again crafted by Branca Studio. It is a witchy album for witchy ears, a heavy opus that has emerged straight from the deepest abyss.\n\nOnce again the father and son duo on guitars offer the listener a horde of crushing, fuzzy, Iommi riffs while the mammoth bass tears down everything in its path with its acid hooves. Its drums are thundering unearthly beats of harrowing doom while its mesmerizing vocals will bewitch you with their words of woe. Heavier and more diverse than its predecessor, \"Caravan\" is here to tear you down with its acid tusks. Prepare to be doomed!!!\n\n\"Caravan\" is coming out March 5th 2021 by Heavy Psych Sounds Records.\n\nBack in December of 2010, I went into a house in Joshua Tree California to record another solo record.\n\nAbout 4 days into the sessions, I decided to abandon the 8 songs I was working on, told my long time friend and engineer, Tony Mason, to start rolling tape and I proceeded to play drums in my natural improv style. After multiple drum track performances were captured, I then started layering guitars, bass and percussion in the same improvisational spirit. I essentially decided to \"jam\" by myself for the rest of my scheduled sessions. When the recording session had finally come to an end, I put the 8 unfinished tracks on the \"shelf\" as well as my \"solo jam session\" tracks. I was much more content with the \"jam\" tracks as it was a creative release that was needed at that time.\n\nI decided to call the collective tracks, Jacoozzi. At the time, it reminded me of the feeling of my first solo recording sessions for my first solo release, Jalamanta.... only more \"free\". At that time in 2010, I had no formal plans to release any of the music from those sessions....Jacoozzi included.\n\nWEDGE's new release \"Like No Tomorrow\" makes for an unholy trinity of WEDGE albums in the Heavy Psych Sounds Records back catalogue. The Berlin-based power trio once more is driving their musical WEDGE in between many different genres: Garage rock turns progressive while psychedelic guitar lines are tripping over hard rocking riffs. Does this work together? Hell yes! For fans of Deep Purple, MC5, Led Zeppelin or Humble Pie this album is a sure shot. You like fuzz guitars? Hammond organ and vocals trough a swirling Leslie cabinet? More cowbell? You got it. But unlike our beloved rock records from around 1971, which we've heard a hundred times before \"Like No Tomorrow\" has one huge advantage: It's brand new and the 8 tracks, ranging from 3:00 to 9:00 minutes, deliver a fresh, unspent and unmistakably unique taste to the rock'n'roll menu. In the tradition of bands like The Raconteurs, The Hellacopters, Graveyard or Wolfmother, WEDGE are building on that vintage vibe we all know and love but evolve their very own thing and are able to connect it directly to here and now. Also lyrically the tunes are picking up on our zeitgeist, dealing with topics like digitalisation, mass migration and current social issues among others. So it's no coincidence that the record's title is a direct hint at our crazy times, in which it feels like the end of the world might be lurking just around the very next corner. But rather than being pessimistic about it, WEDGE want to convey a positive message: \"When it feels like there might be no tomorrow, just love and live Like No Tomorrow\"\n\nA longtime dream has been to capture the YAWNING MAN performing in the very environment that so inspired their music. The opportunity arose in 2020 from the challenges artists and musicians faced during the Covid 19 Pandemic, social distancing forcing artists to creatively adapt to alternatives to express themselves musically and visually.\n\nYawning Man âs answer to this calling is âLive at Giant Rockâ. This cinematic concert experience is intimately and beautifully captured by videographer Sam Grant in the environment that inspires Yawning Manâs spacious, expansive and cinematic music.\n\nFilmed live in the early morning hours of May 18th, 2020 in the visually stunning and mysterious landscape of Giant Rock. In the spirit of Pink Floydâs âLive at Pompeiiâ the performance is shot on location with no audience, just the band performing their instrumental meditations in the rugged beauty of the Mojave Desert.\n\nGiant Rock in Landers California has attracted Native American Nomads, Scientists, UFO Researchers, and travelers from all over the world, drawn by its magnetic spiritual energy. The bands outdoor performances are legendary.... this film is the first artfully composed representation of that experience. Yawning Manâs music has found a most fitting venue.\n\n\"Live at Giant Rock\" DVD\n\nA dream of the band for over 20 years. Finally this live cinematic concert experience has been realized. Bringing together the visuals of the unique, majestic and awe inspiring Giant Rock area of the Southern California Mojave desert with the music that these desert landscapes inspired.\n\nIn the spirit of Pink Floydâs âLive at Pompeiiâ the performance is shot on location at Giant Rock with no audience. The concept is to pair the bands beautiful music with the dramatic natural landscapes.\n\nThe bands outdoor desert performances are legendary and this film is the first artfully composed representation of that experience.\n\nYawning Man will release this on DVD, Digitally as well as a vinyl LP and compact disk of the soundtrack to be released this fall on Heavy Psych Sounds Records\n\nTry to travel with your mind: back in time, desert lands, cactus, dusty roads and a long journey.\n\nThink of stopping somewhere beautiful at the end of the trip refreshing your soul with a cold beer and a breathtaking landscape view.\n\n\"...FROM THE EARTH TO THE SKY AND BACK\" is the perfect soundtrack for a mind travel or a real journey on a hot hot summertime day.\n\nAcoustic and electric guitars, percussion, banjo and pedal steel mixed with mellow vocals that let you dream away.\n\nThis is the bandâs sophomore album and is composed of 14 songs. The first part of the album is inspired by a classic country attitude mixed with a spaghetti western sound. The rest of the album presents different moments, while conjuring up atmospheres reminiscent of Santana, The Eagles, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, Spirit, Captain Beyond and recent Motorpsycho, we can simply file the genere under : Acoustic, Melodic, Psychedelic Folk.\n\nThe first album \"Walking into the Forest\" has been a surprise success while selling out in 1 year and recieving the attention of many devoted followers who are waiting impatiently for the second chapter.\n\nCompared to the first album \"...FROM THE EARTH TO THE SKY AND BACK\" has improved the production, there are more songs arranged with drums and the the album has been mixed and mastered by Shane Trimble.\n\nThe fantastic artwork who really match with the album sound is made by Maarten Donders.\n\nAfter the amazing success of this debut, we decided to reissue the release with a cover restyling, new coloured versions and 2 brand new bonus tracks !!!\n\nGabriele Fiori -- already frontman of Rome-based outfits Black Rainbows and Killer Boogie and a key figure in Europeâs heavy underground as the head of the Heavy Psych Sounds label and booking agency -- was not exactly lacking for things to do. And yet, a couple years back, The Pilgrim started to nebulously take shape as an idea for a solo-project, something different than the hard-driving psychedelia and garage heavy rock for which heâd already been so revered.\n\nIt wasnât until Jan. 2018 that he really got to putting songs together, but the end result on Walking into the Forestis a space-folk release with a personality unto itself. Songs like opener âPeace of Mindâ evoke some of Fioriâs more rocking side, while âSunset in the Desertâ feels like an ode to the acoustic album Kyuss never made, and side B, which starts with the Hawkwind cover âBrainstormâ and ends with the moody strum of âSuite #2â -- originally from Void Generatorâs 2004 debut EP; when Fiori was in the band -- hones a cosmic drift and textures that nonetheless remain accessible and organic thanks to their acoustic foundation.\n\nâThe main point in common with Black Rainbows is the diversity of the songs,â Fiori explains. âYou have mind-dreams like âDragonflyâ or âSailor,â or the more folk rock âPeace of Mind,â passing through space with âThe Time You Waitâ and the melodic-melancholic âWhen I Call Your Name.ââ\n\nIn completing the arrangements, Fiori turned to Black Rainbows drummer Filippo Ragazzoni, and as he says, âSongs came out so spontaneously and easy. I always played acoustic guitar and wanted to push further on this path. The songwriting, rehearsing and recording approach was so different from usual Rainbows or Boogie style, both to me and Filippo for drums, because all the instruments needed to be played smoothly, softly.â\n\nThe fantastic and dreamy artwork has been accomplished by Marteen Donders The recordings has been realized in Rome at Nero Studio on a fantastic 70's SSL mixing console during the fall 2018 The Mix and the mastering been doon at JD Studio by Pino Santamaria, same engineer who mixed several Black Rainbows albums\n\nWith Walking into the Forest, Fiori evokes a sound that is both classic and fresh, melodically rich and creatively constructed. It is a new outlet for Fiori that demands spiritual as well as auditory engagement, and an all-things-permissible sonic context that one can only hope The Pilgrim continues to explore.\n\n- JJ.Koczan\n\nLight the Dankness is the latest Belzebong album, released in 2018. We are very stoked to present you the repress of this amazing record with brand new coloured vinyls !!!\n\nThe release, which is vocalized only with periodic samples, is nonetheless able to convey its sensibilities not only through its titles, but through the bare riffs and grooves themselves.\n\nâPot Fiendâ rounds out side A with nine and a half minutes of filthy swing, pitting slow-motion shuffle and massive riffing against each other and seeing who wins en route to its final crash and fading feedback, and another sample begins âDopergangerâ on side B. The second half of Light the Dankness is longer than the first, with âDopergangerâ at 7:50 and âRoached Earthâ at 12 minutes flat, but the method is largely the same: Riff unto oblivion. âDopergangerâ picks up the tempo somewhat from âPot Fiendâ in a kind of winding central progression born of a dirtied-up Sleep influence, but they tool around with it effectively throughout and seem to explore the reaches where the song might go, a solo arriving after five minutes in just as the song seems to start tearing itself apart. A longer sample emerges as they pull it back together and trash their way into a stretch of silence preceding âRoached Earth.â (The Obelisk)\n\nBlack Rainbows are back with a brand new album! This time they are delivering 12 new and fresh tunes. Recorded and produced by Fabio Sforza, who was also behind the previous album Pandaemonium. âCosmic Ritual Supertripâ has a monolithic force; guitars, drums and bass are all glued together to give the listener a punch in the face! This album gets its magic power from mixing together a 70âs attitude with a doom-occult and stoner rock sound in a masterful way. We can count a bunch of singles, such as âIsolationâ and âMaster Rocket Power Blastâ, as well as a couple of doomy songs like âUniversal Phaseâ and âSaacred Graalâ and also more catchy tunes like âRadio 666â and âAt Midnight You Cryâ. This is the 8th album of the band and we believe the best one so far. Recorded at Forward Studios in Rome on a huge Neve desk, this new gem will be out May 1st, on Heavy Psych Sounds Records.\n\nThe amazing artwork, made by the one and only Robin Gnista, is matching in its entirety the album music concept.\n\nEven before you know itâs self-titled, and even before you read the LP liner notes, you know itâs all Brant Bjork.\n\nThe man who has become the ambassador of Californian desert rock indeed plays every instrument across his 13th studio full-length, Brant Bjork. This in itself is something of a departure from recent offerings, as on 2018âs Mankind Woman, Bjork worked closely with guitarist Bubba DuPree (Void), and both 2016âs Tao of the Devil and 2014âs Black Power Flower were constructed around the Bjork-led Low Desert Punk Band.\n\nMaybe revisiting his 1999 debut, Jalamanta, for a Heavy Psych Sounds 20th anniversary reissue last year had some effect on Bjorkâs mindset in terms of working solo, but heâs come too far in the ensuing decades to repeat himself, and the songs on Brant Bjork â recorded and mixed by Yosef Sanborn in Joshua Tree and mixed by John McBain (ex-Monster Magnet) â show that, whether itâs the mellow roll of âDuke of Dynamiteâ or the signature take on classic heavy rock in âJesus Was a Bluesmanâ and percussion-backed funk of opener âJungle in the Sound.â Thereâs no mistaking Brant Bjork, and on Brant Bjork, he strips his songwriting style to its core and brings out the organic vibe thatâs made him desert rockâs most crucial practitioner.\n\nHis legacy and pedigree are unmatched, with tenures in Kyuss/Vista Chino and Fu Manchu as well as the sadly-shortlived ChÃ©, Ten East and others, but it is Brant Bjorkâs solo work that has had his greatest impact and shown him to be of inimitable character in craft and style. His unrelenting creativity and one-of-a-kind voice are writ large over the Brant Bjork LP, which is precisely how it should be, and after more than two decades of exploring out in the sands, Bjork continues to find new ways to manifest not just the landscape of the desert, but the spirit of his relationship to it.\n\nIn short, he is a master, and this is the record that bears his name. You miss it at your own peril.\n\n- JJ Koczan\n\nEnter the Mirage is arguably the most blazing and powerful album yet by The Sonic Dawn. It has an unusual live feel for a studio album, packing much of the raw energy and electricity that has made The Sonic Dawnâs psychedelic concerts famous in the rock underground.\n\nEnter the Mirageâs overall theme is freedom. It is about visions that may seem too distant to be real, but only those who take the trip will ever really find out. Frontman, Emil Bureau, explains about the albumâs inception:\n\nâ First I lost my father, then I lost my job and finally I lost my will to be a servant of anything that isnât peace, love and freedom. It should be simple, but in this world it isnât. Instead of getting back on the so-called career path, which is generally a dead end, I took a leap of faith, with the bandâs support.\n\nBureau spent half a year in a songwriting frenzy, spawning not only Enter the Mirage by The Sonic Dawn, but also a solo album in the folk genre (available via Heavy Psych Sounds).\n\nTo give form to these song ideas, the Danish trio rented a space in the gloomiest part of Copenhagen, set up a studio there and rocked out for two months. You hear that roughness, present as a determined attitude from a tightly knit band. With three past albums and some 200 shows under their belt, The Sonic Dawn is a psychedelic group to be reckoned with.\n\nHowever, at the end of their long and laborious creative process, the band was completely broke. Fortunately, friend and former producer, Thomas Vang, allowed them to mix the album in The Village Recording at night, after his own sessions. Thanks to this, and a skillful mastering by Hans Olsson Brookes (Graveyard et al.) Enter the Mirage puts the HIGH back in high fidelity. Turn up the volume and experience The Sonic Dawn.\n\nWe are so stoked to present a big comeback, a dream come true!\n\nHeavy Psych Sounds Records is reissuing first three albums of the Swedish legendary band Dozer:\n\nIn The Tail Of A Comet (2000, Man's Ruin Records), Madre De Dios (2001) and Call It Conspiracy (2003, both out via Molten Universe). Three masterpieces of the European stoner scene. These three records elevated the scene to a higher level and gave Dozer the scepter of the Scandinavian stoner movement.\n\nIn the post-Kyuss era, Dozer, along with bands like Los Natas and Acid King, brought a flurry of pure, desert-style monolithic riffs and tons of fuzz guitars.\n\nThe songwriting on all these three albums was what really distinguished Dozer from the other bands of the early 2000's.

One of the first bands of the genre present their 8th album after their first EP (SideFX) back in 1994 (the grunge rock era). This time the album hits directly to the soul. 8 new tracks which are different to each other, combining groovy parts with heaviness and melodies. The guitars are still heavy but spacey and psychedelic at the same time. The bass is always groovy with intense playing. All together with a lot of catchy melodies and the power of Argyâs vocals are the secret of the music of Nightstalker. Raw rock 'n roll simplicity, stunning riffs and electric haze are what have kept the band going for more than 20 years. Produced by Nightstalker again and this time it is recorded and mixed at âWreck it Sound Studiosâ. Listening to Nightstalker you can figure out why Greece is the perfect country for stoner rock bands and why the Greek stoner scene is one of the greatest worldwide.\n\nFor fans of: Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Monster Magnet, Kyuss\n\n22 years after their first release and 10 years after their last album, Nebula are back. And youâre thinking âHoly shit!â right now, you pretty much nailed it.\n\nHoly Shit is Nebulaâs first LP since 2009âs Heavy Psych, and it quickly puts to rest the question thatâs loomed since guitarist/vocalist Eddie Glass, bassist Tom Davies and drummer Michael Amster announced the bandâs reformation in 2017. Nebula are still Nebula.\n\nItâs there in the inimitable space-grunge of âItâs all Over,â or the take-a-drag-and-be-gone âLetâs Get Lost,â or the way âTomorrow Never Comesâ manages to be so, so heavy and laid back at the same time. Itâs in the paradise-psych of âGates of Edenâ and even the snoring you hear before the devilish âManâs Best Friendâ kicks in to open the album (the studio couch became a crash spot).\n\nSince the days of 1998âs Let it Burn EP and the now-classic To the Center debut album, Nebula have always been just a little more dangerous. Just a little more unhinged. Holy Shit shows this front-to-back for the essential part of their character it is, and yet itâs not trying to be anything theyâve done before, whether itâs those early outings or Heavy Psych or Charged (2001), Apollo (2003) or Atomic Ritual (2005). Itâs a sixth Nebula album -- something for which even the most ardent of fans could hardly have hoped.\n\nThe basic tracks were done in two days, recorded at Mysterious Mammal Studios in L.A. with Matt Lynch (also of Snail) at the helm. Leads and loops and feedback effects were done live by Glass and Davies as they recorded the basic tracks, just the way theyâd do it on stage, and overdubs followed after as needed. A glut of material was produced and whittled down to the core of what you hear here. A sixth Nebula album.\n\nAnd when you hear it, youâll find yourself saying that title all over again.\n\n- JJ Koczan\n\nBack in December of 2010, I went into a house in Joshua Tree California to record another solo record.\n\nAbout 4 days into the sessions, I decided to abandon the 8 songs I was working on, told my long time friend and engineer, Tony Mason, to start rolling tape and I proceeded to play drums in my natural improv style. After multiple drum track performances were captured, I then started layering guitars, bass and percussion in the same improvisational spirit. I essentially decided to \"jam\" by myself for the rest of my scheduled sessions. When the recording session had finally come to an end, I put the 8 unfinished tracks on the \"shelf\" as well as my \"solo jam session\" tracks. I was much more content with the \"jam\" tracks as it was a creative release that was needed at that time.\n\nI decided to call the collective tracks, Jacoozzi. At the time, it reminded me of the feeling of my first solo recording sessions for my first solo release, Jalamanta.... only more \"free\". At that time in 2010, I had no formal plans to release any of the music from those sessions....Jacoozzi included.\n\nHigh Reeper is back with their second release Higher Reeper and they arenât fucking around. The sound and smell of leather, weed and death now has a hint of Campari and cocaine to color all eight tracks. With the addition of their new drummer Justin Di Pinto, High Reeper has managed to focus their sound and expand it at the same time. The record is darker and heavier than their first offering with guitars that crush you like a tank and lyrics that paint a picture of the world nearing its end. While the sound of Higher Reeper is more focused, at the same time it manages to be more complex and varied. With tracks ranging from ones as heavy as the album opener, âEternal Leviathanâ, to the ethereal ballad âApocalypse Hymnâ, this LP will take you all the way to hell and leave you there to rot. Once again produced, engineered and mixed by bass player Shane Trimble at TTR studios and Delwood Sound and mastered by Mike Tarsia. Solomacello created the incredible cover that captures the mood of the record while giving a nod to classic heavy metal.\n\nMankind Woman is the thirteenth solo record by Brant Bjork.\n\nAlthough this is indeed a Brant Bjork record it is the first record Brant Bjork solely collaborates with a producer and co-writer, his LowDesertPunkBand guitarist and friend, Bubba Dupree.\n\nOnly Brant and Bubba wrote and performed the music along with guest appearances by bass player Armand Secco Sabal, Nick Oliveri and Vocalist Sean Wheeler who has been a touring member of the LowDesertPunkBand.\n\nIn March of 2018, the recording took place at Zainaland, a creative Villa owned by Brant Bjork's wife, Zaina Alwan, in the California desert town of 29 Palms. The record was recorded and engineered by Yosef Sanborn who also owns and operates Massive FX pedals in Los Angeles. Multiple pedals designed by Yosef were used by Brant and Bubba for this record. Additional tracks were recorded by Bubba Dupree at Brant Bjork's home studio in Venice beach California.\n\nBrant Bjork and Bubba DuPree describe the sound of Mankind Woman as modern classic. It is evidently clear that both Brant and Bubba specialize in the craft of the sound and feel of the music spawned in the 60's and 70's and this record is undoubtedly a testament to this great era of song and sound, however the intention was not to try to recapture or mimic in retro terms these influences but to strive for a contemporary quality.\n\nBrant Bjork might have gone deeper in the lyrics than on any record before. Focusing on personal sensitivities, elite hypocrisies, racism, sexism and the daily struggle to find Peace, love and understanding in today's American society.\n\nOnce again, Brant Bjork makes here a record that reminds the listener that it was the ingredients of jazz, blues and funk that makes rock music taste so good.\n\nThis records you are holding is VOLUME FIVE of a series of compilations in which I recorded the vocals.\n\nBands that I like and bands that like mysinging voice enough to have asked me to âguest vocalâ on a song for their records. Some of these have been released and some have not until now. I have sang and/or recorded bass on 50+ releases of bands I love and had the great honor to work with â (DWARVES * MONDO GENERATOR * SVETLANAS * Q.O.T.S.A. * KYUSS * BLâAST * BLOODCLOT * MASTERS OF REALITY * VISTA CHINO * MARK LANEGAN BAND * TURBONEGRO * DEATH ACOUSTIC * THE UNCONTROLLABLE) to name a few.\n\nThe good folks at HEAVY PSYCH SOUNDS RECORDS are releasing a series called â N.O. HITS AT ALLâ. Now for the first time, all these songs and bands Iâve recorded with over the past 25 years are together and available to you to trip out on. So get your head right and put this record on and play it loud.\n\nThat is all for now. Stay tuned for VOLUME FOUR (coming soon)\n\nAll the best\n\nNick Oliveri\n\nOct. 1, 2016 Los Angeles, California\n\nTracklist\n\nA1. Itâs You I Dont Believe by The Dwarves\n\nA2.

Dramatic and flowing, dark, intense and emotional. July 2018 finds the band releasing their most musically exciting recording to date with their 6th full length LP, âTHE REVOLT AGAINST TIRED NOISESâ on the ambitious up and coming independent label, HEAVY PSYCH SOUNDS. The songs on this release are described as âan emotional and visceral expression of pure melodic darkness and beautyâ, the album was recorded at Gato Trail Studios in Joshua Tree, CA and produced and engineered by friend and long time collaborator, Mathias Schneeberger (Mark Lanegan, Greg Duli, SUNN O))), Earth, The Obsessed). The eight songs offered here are the results of a conscious focus to the poetry in melody, finding new sounds and melodic passages that conjure visuals and express emotion and movement. Six of the eight songs are in the instrumental tradition the band is mostly know for however two tracks feature the rare appearance of a vocalist (bassist Mario Lalli) alongside Gary Arceâs dream weaving guitar work. One of these tracks of notable mention is the song âCATAMARANâ, a Yawning Man song made popular by the legendary influential desert rock band KYUSS on the 1995 Elektra release âAnd the Circus Leaves Townâ. The song was never released by Yawning Man, however the KYUSS cover of the song proved to be a favorite among KYUSS fans. Spreading the word about Yawning Manâs unique rock music. Yawning Man will finally release this classic, properly recorded for the first time in 30 years. âThe Revolt Against Tired Noisesâ is just that , a statement of a unique creative chemistry thatâs always changing and evolving.\n\nA full European, UK, North American / Canadian and South American tour is in planned to support the release\n\nThis records you are holding is VOLUME FOUR of a series of compilations in which I recorded the vocals.\n\nBands that I like and bands that like mysinging voice enough to have asked me to âguest vocalâ on a song for their records.

Susy Is A Headbanger by Ramones\n\nEddie Glass and Ruben Romano (ex Fu Manchu) has put together one of the most sonically aural music obliterations ever put down on tape. Along with Queens of the Stone Age and Eternal Elysium, Nebula were one of the most pleasant surprises in the stoner rock movement. To call them another stoner rock band is an injustice to their versatility and dynamism. Nebula experiments with different types of sounds, including the raga piece \"Raga in the Bloodshot Pyramid.\" Arguably one of the best white-played ragas, besides the Northwood Improvisers' phenomenal Stargarden, the song offers a refreshing change from the average fuzz-infested rock tune.
