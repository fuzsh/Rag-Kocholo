        "text": "Overview\n\nNHTSA issues guidance documents that may clarify existing legal obligations to help regulated entities and the public understand the statutes administered by NHTSA and NHTSA's regulations. The term \"guidance document\" refers to a statement of agency policy or interpretation concerning a statute, regulation, or technical matter within the jurisdiction of an agency that is intended to have general applicability and future effect, but which is not intended to have the force or effect of law in its own right, unless expressly authorized by law or incorporated into a contract.\n\nGuidance Documents\n\nQuick Links\n\nAdaptive Vehicles\n\nAlcohol Measuring Devices\n\nBicycle Safety\n\nCollision Insurance\n\nData-Driven Approaches to Crime and Traffic Safety\n\nDistracted Driving\n\nDrowsy Driving\n\nEmergency\n\nMedical Services\n\nEnforcement Guidance Bulletins\n\nFMVSS Test Procedures\n\nGeneral Highway Safety\n\nHighway Safety Grant Programs\n\nImpaired Driving\n\nLegal Interpretations\n\nMotorcycle Safety\n\nNational Center for Statistics and Analysis\n\nNew Car\n\nAssessment Program\n\nOdometer Fraud\n\nOlder Drivers\n\nPedestrian Safety\n\nSchool Bus Safety\n\nSeat Belt Use\n\nSpeeding\n\nTeen Driving\n\nUniform Guidelines for State Highway Safety...\n\nVehicle Importation and Certification\n\nVehicle Safety Recalls\n\nVehicle Safety Research\n\nVehicle Theft\n\nPrevention\n\n911 System\n\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Laboratory Test Procedures\n\nThe laboratory test procedures for all of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards can be found on this website.\n\nLegal Interpretations\n\nNHTSA's Chief Counsel interprets the statutes that the agency administers and the regulations that it promulgates. When members of the public ask the agency a question about motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment that involves these statutes and regulations, the Chief Counsel responds with a letter of interpretation that looks at the particular facts presented in the question and explains how the law applies given those facts. A searchable database of these legal interpretations can be found on NHTSA's website.\n\nInterpretations Published in the Federal Register\n\nInterpretation Regarding Preemption and Pre-Sale State Enforcement Safety Standards, January 7, 1982\n\nLamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment (Signal Lighting Statement of Policy), November 4, 1998\n\nLamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment (ID Lamp Location), April 5, 1999\n\nLamps, Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment (Replacement Equipment), November 1, 2005\n\nComplaints\n\nPUBLIC COMPLAINTS ABOUT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS\n\nPursuant to the OMB Good Guidance Bulletin, we have also designated a specific office to receive and address public complaints that we are not complying with the OMB Good Guidance Bulletin or that we are treating a significant guidance document as a binding requirement. This office will respond promptly and appropriately to any complaints.\n\nIf you have concerns about the agency's compliance with the OMB Good Guidance Bulletin, please contact:\n\nOffice of the Chief Counsel\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\n1200 New Jersey Avenue SE\n\nWest Building\n\nWashington, DC 20590\n\n202-366-9511\n\nReview and Modification"
