        "text": "The scheme is primarily aimed at university students or recent graduates (law or non-law), but we also welcome applications from sixth form students who can demonstrate an interest in law.\n\nAs a firm with a majority female Senior Leadership Team and midway through becoming a B-Corp, we are committed to promoting diversity in the legal profession and welcome applications for work experience from persons of all backgrounds who are driven, have strong academics and an interest in the start-up space and legal profession.\n\nWe particularly encourage applications from those from state schools or with non-traditional or less advantaged backgrounds and will give special consideration to applications from candidates with such backgrounds and to BAME candidates.\n\nWe are especially interested in candidates with a real drive and determination to succeed in the profession, to nurture and support your self-starter attitude and help you flourish.\n\nUnfortunately, as we are a small team we can only offer a small number of places each year. We therefore feel it is fair to offer those places to individuals who are either recent graduates, currently at university or in sixth form. Priority is generally given to students who will have completed (at the time of the work experience) at least one year of a university degree as we feel they will get the most out of the placement.\n\nThe work experience programme is designed to give you a brief insight into a career in law, have the opportunity to contribute to live client matters and undertake some of the tasks that our paralegals routinely do. We have in the past hired paralegals that have participated in the work experience programme, but this is not the purpose of the scheme and there is no guarantee of a job at the end of it."
