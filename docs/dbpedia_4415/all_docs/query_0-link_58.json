        "text": "2.0 General Statement\n\nThe policies set forth in this Volume II of the Chaminade University Policy Manual are those that pertain to all members of the campus community. Information is provided in Appendix 2.0 as to Departments to be reached for specific questions.\n\n2.1 General Campus Information\n\n2.1.1 Library\n\nSullivan Library provides support to curricular programs and extracurricular interests of students. Special collections include the Oceania Collection, the Catholic Authors Collection, the Julius J. Nodel Judaica Collection, and the David L. Carlson Japan Collection. Small collections of non-print materials (tapes, DVDs, etc.) are also available. The library also houses a gallery which spotlights University and local artists as well as other exhibits.\n\nServices offered include book circulation, reference consultation, computerized information retrieval and instruction in library use. Materials can be renewed, providing no other borrower has requested the material. All materials must be returned to the main desk or put in the book drop located in the hallway next to the library.\n\nMembers of the Campus Community have access to reference material, inter-library loan (ILL) services, fee- and non-fee based literature searches, and material circulation. The library also provides study and conference areas as well as photocopy services. People outside the Campus Community are also welcome to make use of the library’s collection in the library, although other services are not available to them.\n\nStudents are encouraged to take an informal tour of the library and ask for library instruction on how to use the many services provided. Inquire at the Reference or Circulation Desk. Fines are imposed for overdue materials.\n\nThe cost for lost materials is the replacement cost of the lost materials, plus a processing fee. Note that fees are subject to change. Grade reports may be withheld and transcripts may not be issued until all library materials are returned and all fines are paid.\n\n2.1.2 Office of Educational Technology (OET)\n\nThe Office of Educational Technology (OET) provides resources to allow more effective teaching. The office is responsible for the classroom technology (digital projectors, document cameras, computers with internet access, and videotape players) available in each classroom. OET also schedules and maintains the multimedia classroom (H106) which has video capabilities.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 1\n\nIt also administers and provides pedagogical assistance in the use of our WebCT course management software. OET trains and certifies instructors to teach online and asynchronous classes, and monitors classes to assure that the technology is being used effectively. The Faculty Instructional Lab provides computer and multimedia resources to assist faculty in incorporating technology into the curriculum.\n\nThe multipurpose Audio Visual Media Resource Center provides instructional media technology support to all divisions, student activities, special, cultural, and evening programs, and other events. Although the Center’s first priority is to support instructors in the classroom, arrangements can be made for loans of appropriate materials for activities outside of class. The Center is a resource for language audiocassettes, films, slides, and videotapes.\n\n2.1.3 Network and Desktop Services\n\nNetwork and Desktop Services (NDS) provides computing and network resources, including email accounts for all members of the Chaminade community. It is also responsible for specifying, ordering, and replacing computers for individual faculty and staff.\n\nNDS services the computer classrooms used by classes that require hands-on computer use, as well as providing a general-use computer lab for students, faculty and staff. A small classroom is also available for classes which need computer facilities for periods less than a semester.\n\nThe Chaminade network is maintained by NDS. The network provides access both local and wide-area technology. Most of the campus is wired with 100 MBps data ports, while the residence halls (and some other areas on campus) are served by 10 MBps wireless networks.\n\n2.1.4 Rector\n\nThe office of the Rector serves the Chaminade community from a Marianist perspective. Broadly speaking, the office seeks to animate the entire social fabric of our community with the family spirit, which is characteristic of a Marianist institution. The Rector serves as a coordinator for all the Marianists on campus and is also a special advisor to the President and other University administrators. The Rector coordinates all programs introducing the University community to the mission of the University, its Catholicity and the characteristics of Marianist universities.\n\n2.1.4.1 Campus Ministry\n\nThrough its Campus Ministry Program, Chaminade University seeks to preserve and foster the Catholic Marianist values that are part of our history and tradition. It does this in the ecumenical spirit articulated by the Church in Vatican II. These values are fostered through the involvement of students, faculty, and staff in its programs. Programs include opportunities for a full liturgical and sacramental life, prayer, social outreach, community service, retreats, spiritual counseling, and a deeper involvement with the issues facing the human community. Through all its programs, Campus Ministry distinctly promotes a spirit of faith and service.\n\nThe Campus Ministry Office is located on the ground floor of Henry Hall.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 2\n\nCampus Ministry programs include equal opportunities for a full liturgical and sacramental life, prayer, social outreach, community service, retreats, spiritual counseling, and a deeper involvement with the issues facing the human community.\n\n2.1.4.2 Mass/Liturgical Celebrations\n\nRoman Catholic Masses are celebrated on Sundays in the Mystical Rose Chapel. Masses are also held on special feast days and some weekdays. All religious denominations are welcome.\n\n2.1.5 Bookstore\n\nStudents may purchase textbooks, school supplies, snacks, and clothing with the Chaminade logo at the bookstore. Copy services, fax services, and local bus pass sales are available. Personal checks, Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card and American Express are accepted.\n\n2.1.5.1 Textbook Ordering Policy\n\nThe procedure helps keep the cost of textbooks lower for our students. The deadlines are as follows\n\nOctober 15 for Spring Day semester\n\nApril 15 for Fall Day semester\n\nTwo (2) months prior to the start of the term for AUP and Master’s programs\n\nThese deadlines are in place because they affect book buy back prices for the subsequent terms. This ultimately affects the price our students will have to pay for books.\n\nShould multiple sections of the same course be required in any given semester and/or when these sections indicate STAFF assignments, the Divisional Dean or Program Coordinator will be responsible for meeting the textbook deadline.\n\nTextbook requests are due immediately for courses scheduled after the two-month prior deadline.\n\nThe bookstore will be responsible for reminding the faculty about the deadline and will notify Divisional Deans and Program Coordinators if faculty in their area fail to place an order.\n\nIf there are any questions please feel free to contact the Associate Provost at extension 750.\n\n2.1.6 Business Office\n\nStudents can pay for tuition, parking, transcripts, residence life room and board fees, and other miscellaneous fees at the Business Office window. Students may pick up their financial aid checks at this location. Questions concerning payroll are also handled at this office.\n\n2.1.7 Center for Lifelong Learning\n\nThe Center for Lifelong Learning has three basic goals: to bring Chaminade’s name and a quality product into the community; to bring the expertise of the Chaminade faculty into the community; to bring the community to the Chaminade campus. To accomplish these goals, the Center has four programs; it provides local business with interesting, effective training; it provides full-service training programs on a contract basis for local businesses; it provides a forum to the community for Chaminade non-credit classes by presenting workshops and conferences on campus; it provides interesting speakers for community organizations.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 3\n\n2.1.7.1 Chaminade’s Commitment to Lifelong Learning\n\nChaminade University’s commitment to the careers of its students is matched by its commitment to their lifelong learning. To ensure that Chaminade plays a part in the continued intellectual growth, after they have graduated from Chaminade, students may return to take any undergraduate course in their major field of study for half the tuition. Some conditions may apply.\n\n2.1.8 Lost and Found\n\nLost and found items may be turned in or retrieved at the Security Office. Be prepared to specifically identify items claimed.\n\n2.1.9 Mailroom\n\nLocated next to the Bookstore, the mailroom distributes campus mail Monday through Friday. Mailboxes are available for students residing in the residence halls.\n\n2.1.10 Carlson Fitness Center\n\nThe Carlson Fitness Center features an array of universal machines as well as over 2,500 pounds of free weights for fitness enthusiasts in a spacious 4,500 square foot facility. The Center is also used as a training and locker area for student athletes. All students, faculty, staff, as well as Chaminade alumni, are welcome to use the facility during scheduled hours. Proper ID, attire and a towel are required.\n\n2.1.11 Recreational Sports\n\nThe Recreational Sports Program, open to all students, staff, faculty, and alumni, is designed to provide an opportunity for enjoyable, organized recreational activities. Diverse programming is geared to promote healthy lifestyles through physical fitness, social contacts, skill development, and competition. Active participation is encouraged in the hopes that the individual will develop an appreciation of the worthy use of leisure time and a wholesome attitude toward physical activity for recreational purposes later in life. Some examples of recreational activities are: basketball, golf, windsurfing, tennis, billiards, volleyball, horseback riding, paintball, and many more. Additional information regarding student athletics is provided in Appendix 7.1.8 of the Student Handbook.\n\n2.1.12 Dining Services\n\nThere are two locations on the Chaminade University campus to enjoy a meal or a snack. The P.O.D. (Provisions On Demand) at Henry Hall provides hot self-service entrees for breakfast, lunch and dinner and is a place for a quick snack or a grab and go meal. The Silversword, located in Tredtin Hall, has a program designed more for the traditional residential dining program and is open for service seven days a week for breakfast, lunch, brunch on weekends, and dinner. The resident dining program features self-serve fresh salad and sandwich bar, as well as a hot entree line. A variety of meal plans are available to our residents and an off -campus plan is also available to apartment and commuter students. Visit the Food Service Office in Tredtin Hall for information or to make off-campus plan purchases.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 4\n\n2.1.13 Requesting Setups\n\nSetups for University events that require tents, chairs and tables are requested according to the following guidelines:\n\nDates are subject to availability and should be requested and confirmed with Facilities well in advance of planning any event. The first step in planning any event that will need a setup is to confirm an available date for that location with the Facilities Department. Consult the “Tents, Tables and Chairs” Calendar on the University web portal https://portal.chaminade.edu/resources/calendars/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nAll setups must be requested through www.myschoolbuilding.com which can also be found on the web portal at the BOOKMARKS tab, under Work Orders and Setup Requests. Requests should be made at least 10 working days prior to the scheduled event date.\n\nAny requests made with less than 10 working days’ notice are subject to a $100 fee even if scheduling is still possible.\n\nAll setup requests from clubs will be handled through the Director of Student Activities, who will be the liaison between the clubs and the Facilities Department.\n\nAll essential academic, enrollment, presidential, institutional advancement, etc. events that are integral to the functioning of the University will have priority over all other events. In fact, they may bump other events from time to time. The essential events include graduation, orientation, recruitment tours of campus, presidential functions, major donor gatherings, etc.\n\nAll requests not in the essential category must have signed authorization from the department head. These include, but may not be limited to the, Assistant Dean of Students, Director of Student Activities, Athletic Director, Director of Residential Life, CSGA Advisor and Academic Division Deans.\n\nFacilities will keep the setup calendar for events.

Failure to follow this policy, follow common practices or courtesies or follow rules of the road could result in suspension of the operator’s cart driving privileges and/or disciplinary action.\n\nAll persons operating a golf cart must pass a cart safety road test administered by Environmental Safety Officer. After passing the test the operator must sign a statement acknowledging that he has read and agrees to follow the Golf Cart Policy and Procedures.\n\nDepartments will determine who will be allowed to drive their carts.\n\n2.1.15.3 Procedures for Safe Operation\n\nOperators must adhere to the speed limit; observe one-way markings and other traffic rules of the University.\n\nOperators cannot wear headsets while driving the carts.\n\nOperators must not drive the carts while their judgment is impaired (e.g. intoxicated, on medication).\n\nOperators are prohibited from driving the carts on roadways outside the boundaries of the University.\n\nOperators should drive slowly over the speed bumps to avoid damages to the cart.\n\nOperators should pull over to allow automobile traffic to pass.\n\nPedestrians have the right-of-way. Carts must yield to pedestrians. Speed must be reduced to a minimum when driving along or crossing the sidewalks as to avoid accidents with pedestrians.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 8\n\nCarts are not to be overloaded, i.e. carrying more passengers than seating provided or overloading the cart’s recommended carrying or load capacity.\n\nCart operators are responsible for ignition keys for the period of time in which they are using the vehicle.

Moved to Volume III 3.1.9 Institutional Harassment and Discrimination Policy and Operational Procedures\n\n2.4 Blank\n\n2.5 Health Policies\n\n2.5.1 Alcohol and Drug Policy\n\nRespect is the foundation upon which Chaminade University bases its alcohol and drug/illegal substance policy as outlined in the following areas:\n\n1. Respect for oneself. Those who are of legal age and choose to drink must never do so in a manner that puts them at personal risk.\n\n2. Respect for others. Those choosing to drink must not drink to a level or in a situation where the rights and well-being of others might be endangered. Use of illegal substances or alcohol abuse does not excuse students and employees from inappropriate conduct or neglect of their responsibilities.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 9\n\n3. Respect for property. Research indicates that most campus vandalism and destruction is directly related to alcohol consumption. Each individual will be held responsible for any damage done while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\n2.5.1.1 Alcohol\n\nIn accordance with Hawaii State Law, Chaminade University does not permit the purchase, possession, manufacturing, consumption, or furnishing of alcohol by persons under 21 years of age. Intentionally or knowingly providing alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21, or to persons obviously inebriated, is not permitted. This prohibition applies to faculty, staff, and students who are responsible for any University function on or off University property. Public intoxication is strictly prohibited.\n\nFor individuals who are 21 year of age or older, the use of alcohol in University-approved areas on campus, including the residence halls, is allowed when done in a responsible, moderate, legal manner and in accordance with established University policies.\n\nStudents and/or student organizations seeking permission to serve alcohol at a University sanctioned events on property owned or controlled by the University must review the “Campus Event Alcohol Policy” and complete the procedures requested by the policy. Student and/or organizational fees are not to be used to purchase alcohol. Requests for approval must be in writing two weeks prior to the proposed event. Students are responsible for completing the form, including obtaining all the necessary signatures, and returning the completed form to Director of Student Activities within the timeline indicated on the form and in the Chaminade University Campus Event Alcohol Policy pamphlet. This information is also provided in Section 7.8 of the Student Handbook.\n\n2.5.1.2 Important Additional Information on Alcohol Use\n\nFederal law mandates that students understand that alcohol consumption causes marked change in behavior. Low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely. Low to moderate doses increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including date rape, spouse abuse, and child abuse. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions, severely altering a person’s ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death. If combined with other depressants of the central nervous system, much lower doses of alcohol will produce the described effects.\n\nRepeated use of alcohol can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Alcohol withdrawal can be life threatening. Long-term consumption of large quantities of alcohol, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs including the brain and liver. Pregnant women who consume alcohol during pregnancy may give birth to infants with fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 10\n\n2.5.1.3 Drugs/Illegal Substances\n\nChaminade University prohibits the possession, manufacture, consumption, sale, and furnishing of illegal substances, including narcotics or controlled substances except as expressly permitted by law, on University owned or controlled property, or at a University sponsored event in compliance with the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989.\n\nThe Controlled Substance Act (1970, amended 1984) and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 provide penalties for unlawful manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances. Other penalties are sanctioned under Hawaii state and local laws.\n\nSuspected violations will constitute grounds for notification of civil authorities. CUH will cooperate fully with federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities to enforce drug and alcohol statutes.\n\nMembers of the Chaminade University community who violate federal and state alcohol and drug statutes or University policies as detailed in this Policy Manual on University owned or controlled property, or at University sponsored functions, are subject to institutional judicial process in addition to any criminal prosecutions by civil authority. Internal sanctions may range from reprimand to dismissal from employment or registration at the University.\n\nFor purposes of this policy, the campus is defined as any area used for educational, recreational, residence hall or parking purposes, including surrounding sidewalks and exterior areas.\n\n2.5.2 Smoking Regulations\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to provide and maintain a healthful and clean working environment. A mutually comfortable atmosphere for the Chaminade University community is dependent upon the thoughtfulness and cooperation of both smokers and non-smokers. Therefore, in compliance with Hawaii law, there shall be no smoking in any classroom, office building, partially enclosed area, eating area, or in any space within twenty feet of entrances, exits, air intake areas, eating areas, and partially enclosed areas. There are designated smoking areas around campus in order to accommodate the people who do smoke.\n\n2.5.3 Serious Disease Policy\n\nSerious diseases for the purposes of this policy include, but are not limited to, cancer, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The University will support, where feasible and practical, educational programs to enhance employee and student awareness and understanding of serious diseases.\n\nEmployees or students with infectious, long-term, life-threatening, or other serious diseases may continue their work at the University as long as they are physically and mentally able to perform the duties of their job or meet their academic responsibilities without undue risk to their own health or the health of other employees or students. Accommodations for employees or students with such conditions please refer to the Reasonable Accommodation Policy Volume III Section 3.1.6 for details.\n\nHarassment of individuals with or suspected of being infected with any disease is not acceptable behavior at the University and will be strictly censored. The diagnosis of the condition, as any other medical information, is confidential.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 11\n\n2.5.3.1 Specific Information Regarding AIDS and HIV Infection\n\nAs an educational institution, Chaminade University’s primary response to the epidemic of HIV infection (which can lead to AIDS) is educational. As stated in a report by the American Council on Education, public health officials and the American College Health Association consider education to be the best method of preventing the spread of AIDS.\n\nIndividuals infected with the AIDS virus (HIV) are protected under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against qualified disabled individuals by institutions receiving federal financial assistance or contracting with the federal government.\n\nChaminade rests its policies on the assumption that the AIDS virus (HIV) is not transmitted by casual contact and thus does not present a significant risk of transmission in most situations. HIV infection is not transmitted by sharing office space, sitting next to an infected individual, sharing telephones, swimming pools, showers, toilet facilities or eating facilities, nor by sneezing, coughing or nose-blowing. If there is not an exchange of blood or bodily fluid, the activity poses no documented risk of transmission of infection and should not be restricted because of fear of transmission of HIV infection.\n\nChaminade recognizes that students, faculty or staff who are infected, or are believed to be infected, with HIV should not suffer irrational and scientifically unfounded discrimination on campus.\n\n2.6 Safety Policies\n\n2.6.1 Emergency Manual\n\nSee Separate Document\n\n2.6.2 Hazardous Materials Policy\n\n2.6.2.1 Hazardous Materials Communication Program\n\nSee Separate Document\n\n2.6.2.2 Hazardous Waste Management Program\n\nSee Separate Document\n\n2.6.2.3 Chemical Hygiene Plan\n\nSee Separate Document\n\n2.6.2.4 Policy and Procedures Regarding Exposure to blood Borne Pathogens\n\nSee appendix 2.6.2.4.1\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 12\n\n2.7 Protection of Human Rights and Animal Subjects of Research Investigations\n\nThe University is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects in any research, development, and related activity; and for assuring the proper care of laboratory animals used in research. In determining policy in these matters, the University is guided by\n\n(a) the “Principles for Use of Human Subjects in Research” and “Principles for Use of Animals in Research” approved by the American Psychological Association, and\n\n(b) the Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46). It is essential that researchers and applicable academic unit heads be fully familiar with these materials.\n\nThe Provost receives proposals from all faculty and administrative staff conducting research involving human or animal subjects, regardless of the form, location, or whether or not it is funded or if other institutional review has been made, e.g., by a hospital institutional review board. If applicable, a copy of that review is to accompany the proposal. Students who carry out research projects involving human or animal subjects must receive approval of the student’s protocol by the faculty member sponsoring and supervising the research in the student’s proposal. The Provost will determine if the proposed research will need an external review by an institutional review board (IRB). If an external review is needed, the University has contracted with Papa Ola Lokahi to conduct this review.\n\n2.8 Emergency Notification Policy\n\n2.9 Video and Electronic Surveillance Policy\n\nThe purpose of the Video and Electronic Surveillance Policy is to deter crime, protect the safety and the property of the campus community, enforce university policy, and to assist Chaminade University and law enforcement in criminal and civil investigations.\n\nThe University respects the privacy of individuals who are using University buildings and grounds. The University will take pragmatic and measured steps to provide a safe and secure environment while avoiding unnecessary intrusions upon academic freedom or individual civil liberties including privacy, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly.\n\nThe approval, installation, operation and use of all video and electronic surveillance systems shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws, and all institutional policies and standards, including but not limited to those laws and policies that prohibit discrimination and harassment and that honor an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy in accordance with accepted social norms.\n\nThis policy applies to all video and electronic surveillance systems located on University facilities and grounds. Video and electronic surveillance systems that are used for the following purposes are excluded from the scope of this policy:\n\nDeliver education;\n\nConduct university teaching, research, or creative activity;\n\nConduct video conferencing;\n\nRecord public performances, events, or interviews;\n\nRecord practices or rehearsals;\n\nRecord news or press coverage;\n\nProduce promotional materials; or\n\nUsed for specific criminal surveillance activity.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 13\n\nThe University reserves the right to review and approve any use of video surveillance technology on facilities owned, leased or controlled by the University in accordance with this policy.\n\nApproval, Installation, and Operation\n\nVideo and electronic surveillance systems shall only be installed and operated following prior review and approval by the Video Surveillance Committee (Committee) and confirmed by the President’s Leadership Council (PLC) and only as outlined in this policy. The approval and confirmation must be clearly stated in Committee and PLC written meeting minutes.\n\nExceptions to the prior review and written approval requirement may be made in the event of an emergency and if there is an imminent threat to the safety or the security of the University community.\n\nVideo and electronic surveillance systems shall be installed and operated by a limited number of authorized operators who:\n\n1. Demonstrate a legitimate need for such access consistent with the purposes of this policy;\n\n2. And have signed and submitted the Video Surveillance Confidentiality Agreement.\n\nVideo and electronic surveillance systems that exist at the time of this policy’s approval shall be brought into compliance with this policy within 3 months.\n\nAppropriate and Prohibited Uses\n\nVideo and electronic surveillance systems shall not be installed in or used to monitor or record areas where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in accordance with accepted social norms. These areas include but are not limited to restrooms, locker rooms, individual residential rooms, changing or dressing rooms, health treatment rooms, and private offices.\n\nVideo and electronic surveillance systems shall not be used to record audio unless prior approval is obtained from the President’s Leadership Council.\n\nVideo surveillance systems shall not be used to monitor or record sensitive institutional or personal information that may be found, for example, in an individual’s workspace and on a computer or other electronic display. Video surveillance systems shall not be used to monitor employee attendance and work schedules.\n\nSurveillance information obtained through video and electronic surveillance systems shall not be accessed, used, or disclosed except as outlined in this policy.\n\nInformation obtained through video and electronic surveillance systems will be primarily used for security, investigations of university policy violations, and law enforcement purposes. Information may also be used in civil or criminal proceedings against person(s) whose activities are shown on the recording and which are the basis for the proceeding.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 14\n\nProcedures\n\n1. Approval and installation. Video and electronic surveillance systems shall be installed only upon the recommendation of the Video Surveillance Committee and the approval of the President’s Leadership Council.\n\n2.

Surveillance information will be kept for a minimum of fourteen (14) days unless authorized by the Executive Director for Compliance and Personnel Services, and it shall be destroyed in a secure manner and within a reasonable time after the fourteen (14) day retention period expires. If retention is required, it must be in conformance with this policy and shall be less than one year, unless surveillance information retention is required as part of an ongoing investigation.\n\n8. Release of surveillance information requires authorization. Surveillance information\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 15\n\nshall only be released to non-operators under specific circumstances, and only upon review and approval of the Executive Director for Compliance and Personnel Services or the Dean of Students. Requests for surveillance information must be submitted in writing and documentation will be kept in the Office of Compliance and Personnel Services. Unauthorized access to, inadequate protection of, and inappropriate use, disclosure, and/or disposal of surveillance information must be reported immediately to the Executive Director for Compliance and Personnel Services and the Dean of Students. Exceptions to prior review and written approval requirement may be made in the event of an emergency and/or an imminent threat to the safety and security of the University community that requires immediate non-operator access, e.g., law enforcement requires surveillance footage to locate active shooter on campus. If a situation is not urgent or imminent, e.g., an investigation, the foregoing authorization is required.\n\n9. Use of surveillance information. Surveillance information may be accessed or otherwise used by authorized operators only as authorized and in accordance with this policy.\n\n10. Notice. Signs may accompany video and electronic surveillance systems. The Video Surveillance Committee will be responsible for approving signage and sign locations. Signage posted should include a statement indicating that the surveillance is not actively monitored.\n\nDefinitions\n\nVideo Camera\n\nA digital or analog device that captures a single image (still, snapshot, photograph), a number of single images shot per time period (stop action, time lapse), or multiple images (motion, video) that is installed and operated in accordance with this policy.\n\nVideo Surveillance Committee\n\nThe group responsible for reviewing and approving aspects of video and electronic surveillance systems including related policies and procedures.\n\nElectronic Surveillance Device\n\nA digital or analog device that has the capability to monitor or record audio, video, or photographic images, including but not limited to cameras, microphones, audiocassette recorders and webcams.\n\nFacilities\n\nAll buildings and grounds that are owned or controlled, through leases or other contractual arrangements, by Chaminade University. This definition includes but is not limited to, offices, labs, building exteriors, hallways, parking lots and garages, outdoor areas, common areas, and off campus buildings. University buildings and grounds that are exempt from this policy must be specifically excluded by a lease, contract or other written agreement.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 16\n\nOperators\n\nIndividuals who have been assigned responsibility by the Video Surveillance Committee for the operation and use of video and electronic surveillance systems.\n\nSurveillance Information\n\nAll information captured by an electronic surveillance system. This definition includes system logs, audio, stills, snapshots, stop action, and video images whether transient, displayed, or recorded.\n\nVideo\n\nThe process of monitoring or recording visual images via stop action, time lapse, or motion cameras.\n\nVideo and Electronic Surveillance Systems\n\nAny video or electronic surveillance system deployed by the University, including its officers, administrators, employees, or agents, for purposes including, but not limited to, public safety, security, or operational effectiveness purposes. “Systems” may monitor or record a specific location or activity and covers all electronic surveillance devices, processes, technology, and equipment, including but not limited to microphones, cameras, images, audio, video, snapshots, configuration settings, logs, software, and hardware.\n\nDisciplinary Action\n\nFailure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action.\n\n2.9.1 Technology Use Policy\n\nChaminade University is committed to excellence in teaching. In an effort to support the University community in these endeavors, the institution has assembled a wide variety of technology resources for general use. These resources are for use by persons currently affiliated with the University, including but not limited to, students, faculty, and staff.\n\nThe technology resources that are owned by the University are to be used for University-related activities for which they have been assigned. University technologies are not to be used for commercial purposes or non-University-related activities without written authorization from the University.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 17\n\nAccess to technology resources at the University is a privilege and must be treated as such by all users. Like any other campus resources, abuse of these privileges can be a cause for campus disciplinary procedures and/or legal action. Furthermore, the University reserves the right to extend, limit, or restrict technology privileges and access to information resources. When an employee or student leaves Chaminade University, unless authorization for continued access is obtained in advance, all University technology privileges will be suspended immediately.\n\nWith regard to web pages hosted by the University, Information Services is available to provide stylistic assistance, although its main role is an advisory one, with primary control of content residing within each unit (see 2.9.5.9 Suspension of Individual Privileges for further information). However, Information Services will have the ultimate authority to decide if web content is acceptable and to suspend access to it if it is deemed unacceptable, under the direction of the President’s Leadership Council.\n\nThe Computer Crime Statute of the Hawai’i Revised Statutes of the Hawai’i penal code, while not reproduced here, shall be considered a part of the University’s Acceptable Use Policy.\n\nThe University’s website privacy notice is also important supplemental material to this policy. The University has the right and responsibility to provide the University community with information technology resources and services. While providing these services is of primary importance, there are other areas of importance aside from physical resources. The following is a general description of the responsibilities, the rights, and the obligations of the users and of the University.\n\n2.9.2 Individual Responsibilities\n\nAlong with the privilege of using the University’s technology resources come responsibilities on the part of the user. Since certain privileges are given to each member of the University community, individuals are held accountable for their actions as a condition of continued membership in this community.\n\n2.9.2.1 Precautions Relative to the Misuse of Technology Resources\n\nIt is imperative that all users of the University’s technology resources be aware of the risks and dangers that can occur from using these resources for non-academic, non-research or other non-university purposes. We strongly discourage users from using the technology resources for purposes of establishing personal contact with individuals previously unknown to the user. The possibility of the user being put in danger of physical harm, or another type of compromising position, cannot be overstated. Therefore, users are strongly urged not to use technology resources for purposes of pursuing personal relationships. All students, faculty, staff, outside vendors and consultants using the resources of the University must sign the Chaminade University Acceptable Use Policy for Technological Resources.\n\n2.9.2.2 Criminal Acts\n\nNo person shall use University technology resources for illegal or criminal activities, including, but not limited to illegally accessing computer systems (this University’s or other systems), exploiting security flaws, releasing computer viruses or worms, obstruction or denial of service attacks, and accessing files, including e-mail, without authorization. Any illegal and /or criminal activities will result in disciplinary action up to and including all provisions of the Computer Crime Statute of the Hawaii Revised Statutes of the Hawaii penal code.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 18\n\n2.9.2.3 Moral and Ethical Standards\n\nIt is expected that all users of all University technology resources will be guided by the ethics, morals, and Catholic and Marianist values and standards of this institution. Every user must respect the rights and dignity of others by using the technology resources responsibly and in accordance with the highest ethical and moral standards. Therefore, certain behavior not consistent with the ethics, morals, and values of this institution and/or any reasonable person will not be tolerated. Following are some, but not all, uses considered unacceptable:\n\nHarassment that would cause distress, embarrassment, discomfort or intimidation based on race, national origin, disability, religious belief, gender, sexual orientation or other types of intimidation.\n\nOffensive, tasteless, sexually explicit materials and images.\n\nUsing the institution’s resources as a conduit to attempt unauthorized access to on or off-campus resources.\n\nVulgar, abusive, or offensive language.\n\nViolation of copyright laws by using, copying, distributing or storing copyrighted programs and materials, including downloaded music and/or video data from the Internet.\n\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to plagiarism (copying of the work of others in violation of authorial integrity).\n\nBehaving in any way that demonstrates a lack of respect for the rights and privacy of others.\n\nIf anyone is witness to, or the victim of, any of the above abuses, it is that person’s responsibility to report the situation to either the Director of the Office of Educational Technology (OET) or the Director of Management Information Systems (MIS), who may handle the individual situation to a satisfactory conclusion, or refer the action for disciplinary action to appropriate administrators or governing bodies.\n\n2.9.2.4 Common Courtesy and Respect for the Rights of Others\n\nEach person is responsible to all other members of the University community in many ways, including to respect and value the rights of privacy for all, to recognize and respect the diversity of the population and opinion in the community, to behave ethically, and to comply with all legal restrictions regarding the use of information that is the property of others.\n\n2.9.2.5 Harassment\n\nNo member of the community may, under any circumstances, use technology to libel, slander, or harass any other person. Persons so doing may come under the University Discipline Procedures in Volume IV, Subsections 4.8.6-8; Volume V, section 5.9.1.4 or the Student Handbook.\n\nExamples of harassment by technology:\n\nUsing to annoy, harass, terrify, intimidate, threaten, offend or bother another person by conveying obscene language, pictures, or other materials or threats of bodily harm.\n\nUsing technology to contact another person repeatedly to harass, or bother, whether or not any actual message is communicated, and/or where no purpose of legitimate communication exists, and where the recipient has expressed a desire for the communication to cease.\n\nUsing technology to contact another person repeatedly regarding a matter for which one does not have legal right to communicate, once the recipient has provided reasonable notice that the recipient desires such communication to cease (such as debt collection).\n\nUsing technology to disrupt or damage the academic, research, administrative, or related pursuits of another.\n\nUsing technology to invade the privacy, academic or otherwise, of another or the threatened invasion of the privacy of another. This section explicitly prohibits the use of video technology in restrooms, locker rooms or other situations which would not normally be considered public or where users of the facility may reasonably expect privacy.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 19\n\n2.9.2.6 Privacy of Information\n\nNo person should look at, copy, alter or destroy anyone else’s personal files without explicit permission (unless authorized or required to do so by law or regulations). The ability to access a file or other information does not imply permission to do so. Similarly, no one should connect to a host on the network without advance permission in some form. People and organizations link computers to the network for various reasons, and many consider unwelcome connections to be attempts to invade their privacy or compromise their security.\n\n2.9.2.7 Intellectual Property\n\nEach person is responsible for recognizing (attributing) and honoring the intellectual property rights of others. Violation of this is plagiarism. See Subsection 4.12.3 of Volume IV of this Policy Manual.\n\n2.9.2.8 Copyright Respect\n\nEach person shall be responsible for adhering to copyright laws including, but not limited to, downloading music and video files from the Internet.\n\n2.9.2.9 Game Playing\n\nLimited recreational game playing, that is not part of an authorized and assigned research or instructional activity, is tolerated within the parameters of each department’s rules. Institutional computing and network services are not to be used for extensive or competitive recreational game playing. Recreational game players occupying a seat in a computing facility must give up that seat when others who need to use the facility for academic or research purposes are waiting. Game playing that interferes with the operation of the University’s technology resources will not be tolerated.\n\n2.9.2.10 Information Integrity\n\n2.9.2.10 Information Integrity\n\nIt is the user’s responsibility to be aware of the potential for, and possible effects of, manipulating information, especially in electronic form, to understand the changeable nature of electronically stored information, and to verify the integrity and completeness of information that is compiled or used. The user should not assume that information or communications are correct when it appears contrary to expectations; it should be verified with the person who originated the message or data.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 20\n\n2.9.2.11 Sharing Access\n\nComputer accounts, passwords, and other types of authorization are assigned to individual users and must not be shared with others. Each individual is responsible for the use of his or her own account, password or authorization codes. Disciplinary action may be taken against persons using passwords and/or authorization codes assigned to another user(s).\n\n2.9.2.12 Commercial Use\n\nNo person shall use University technology resources for commercial purposes or private gain, including, but not limited to, marketing a home business or hosting a commercial web page.\n\n2.9.3 Departmental Web Pages on Chaminade Servers\n\nChaminade University has an official web site, accessible through https://chaminade.edu. This represents the main marketing and communications thrust of the University and is subject to close editorial scrutiny. All modifications to format or content are the responsibility of the President’s Leadership Council, although the Council delegates responsibility for content to the individual campus units. Content and format control is maintained through a combination of pre-formatted templates for adding and changing content and through an approval process administered by the University’s Office of Community Relations. Curriculum-related web pages are administered by the Office of Educational Technology as part of course-management software implementation.\n\nThe University does, however, recognize that individual units may wish to establish home pages which are more easily modified and which reflect designs that are more closely related to the individual unit’s image. Such homepages and associated sub-pages may be established on University servers subject to the following policies.\n\n2.9.3.1 Relationship Between University and Unit Web Pages\n\nAs noted above, the web site at www.chaminade.edu is the principal University web presence. Creation of a local homepage does not lessen the responsibility of units to contribute to the University site. Units are expected to monitor and update their pages on the main web site regardless of any unit web presence they may maintain.\n\n2.9.3.2 Adherence to University Policies\n\nAll infrastructure usage and web page content must adhere to the University’s Acceptable Use Policy, as delineated in section 2.9 of the University Policy Manual, especially the provisions concerning intellectual property rights and plagiarism.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 22\n\n2.9.3.3 Resource Utilization\n\nUniversity computer and network resources are limited. If unit web sites consume a disproportionate amount of resources the unit may be asked to either reduce usage or purchase additional resources for use by the entire University.\n\n2.9.3.4 Content\n\nAll unit web pages are expected to present Chaminade University in a favorable light. Accuracy of information, grammatical usage, spelling, maintenance of links, and the general tone of pages all contribute to a positive impression. While no pre-publication screening of web pages is anticipated, it is expected that unit directors will correct errors when they are reported. If a unit fails to properly maintain its home page and associated structure, it may be un-linked from the University web site. In extreme cases the offending web pages may be removed from University equipment.\n\n2.9.3.5 Design\n\nIt is expected that unit web pages will reflect the tenor of the unit discipline. While no restrictions are placed on design of unit web pages, units should be aware that creating an attractive and effective web structure is a difficult task, and should employ good design practices, such as those described at http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/. Units are also urged to take advantage of the expertise of IS&L personnel.\n\n2.9.3.6 Student Web Pages\n\nUnits with Departmental Web Pages may allow students within their discipline to create web pages for pedagogical purposes or to demonstrate student competence to potential employers. Individual units are responsible for monitoring the content of such web pages (including links) to ensure that they follow these policies.\n\n2.9.3.7 Resolution of Disputes\n\nIt is expected that most questions and disagreements concerning content, design, and appropriateness of unit web pages will be resolved in a collegial way within Chaminade’s Catholic and Marianist traditions. In unusual cases, should such amicable resolution prove impractical, disputes should be referred to the President’s Leadership Council for a final decision.\n\n2.9.4 University Electronic Mail\n\nThe University provides an electronic mail (email) server for use by faculty and staff which is accessible both on and off campus. It is used for both official and unofficial communications. Each employee is issued an email account when they are hired. Official University email will be sent to that account. The account will be deactivated when the employee leaves Chaminade.\n\n2.9.4.1 Purpose\n\nEmail is the primary communications conduit for official announcements within the University. It is especially critical for time-sensitive messages, but is also commonly used for general official communication. While the main purpose of the Chaminade email server is for official communications, employees and students may make use of the service for personal communication as well, so long as such communication falls within the individual responsibilities as described under 2.9.2 of this policy.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 22\n\n2.9.4.2 Responsibility to Monitor Email\n\nAll employees of Chaminade are responsible for accessing their email accounts frequently, since important and time-sensitive materials may be sent at any time.\n\n2.9.4.3 Use of Other Email Servers\n\nIndividuals may prefer to receive official Chaminade email using a service other than that provided by the University. The University does not insist that official email be read using the Chaminade server, however it assumes no responsibility for forwarding email: all official email will be sent to the individual’s Chaminade address. Individuals who wish to forward their email should contact the service they wish to use for instructions on how to retrieve their email using that service. Alternatively, the web interface to Chaminade’s email system has provision for forwarding email to any address. Help using this feature is available from ISL staff.\n\n2.9.5 Institution Responsibilities and Limitations\n\nThe University provides technology to be used in the course of the educational process. Listed below are some of the responsibilities and limitations with regard to the use of technology.\n\n2.9.5.1 Services\n\nThe University has the responsibility to provide, within the overall resource capability of the institution, necessary services to the user through the Office of Educational Technology. These services include, but are not limited to, access to and assistance with technology resources. Problems, questions, and comments on technology resources should be directed to the Office of Educational Technology.\n\n2.9.5.2 Allocation of Resources\n\nThe University has the right and responsibility to allocate its resources in a manner consistent with the achievement of its overall mission.\n\n2.9.5.3 Anti-Harassment Procedures\n\nThe University has the responsibility to develop, implement, maintain, and enforce the appropriate procedures to prevent harassment through the use of its technology resources, and to impose appropriate penalties when such harassment takes place.\n\n2.9.5.4 Systems Administration Access\n\nA System Administrator may access others’ files for the maintenance of the networks, computer and storage systems, such as to create backup copies. Monitoring of Usage, Inspection of Files The University may routinely monitor and log usage data such as network session connection times and end-points, computer and disk utilization for each user, security audit trails, network loading, etc. The institution has the right to review data for evidence of a violation of law or policy, and other purposes. Except for monitoring required for system maintenance, requests to monitor usage must come from the dean or director level, in writing (see Section 2.9.5.6, below).\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 23\n\n2.9.5.5 Imposition of Sanctions\n\nThe University may impose sanctions and discipline any person who violates the policies of the University regarding the usage of technology resources, up to and including all provisions of the Hawai’i Revised Statutes Computer Crime Statute of the Hawai’i penal code. When necessary, the institution has the right to monitor all the activities and inspect the files of specific users on their computers and networks. Any person who believes such monitoring or inspection is necessary should contact the dean or director of their unit. The dean or director should make a written request to the director of the Personnel Office, who will determine if monitoring is warranted. If so, the Dean of Information Services will be asked to instruct the Director of Network and Desktop Services to perform the monitoring or inspection, if feasible. In all cases, all individuals’ privileges and privacy will be preserved to the greatest extent possible.\n\n2.9.5.6 Control of Access to Information\n\nThe University may control access to its information and the devices on which it is stored, manipulated and transmitted in accordance with state, federal and international law, as well as its own standards and policies.\n\n2.9.5.7 Security\n\nThe University has the responsibility to develop, implement, maintain and enforce appropriate security procedures to ensure the integrity of individual and institutional information, however stored, and to impose appropriate penalties when privacy is purposefully violated. Although the University uses security precautions, users are cautioned that any computer connected to a network, especially the Internet, is vulnerable to security violations.\n\n2.9.5.8 Suspension of Individual Privileges\n\nThe University has the right to suspend access to technology resources for reasons relating to the safety and well-being of the campus community or University property. Access will be promptly restored when safety and well-being can be assured, unless access is to remain suspended as a result of formal disciplinary action, through appropriate formal process and procedures.\n\n2.9.5.9 Upholding of Copyrights and License Provisions\n\nThe University has the responsibility to uphold all copyrights and licensing of technology resources. The University must also follow all laws governing access and use of information, and rules of organizations supplying resources to members of the community. The University specifically reserves the right to install software inventory programs on servers and workstations to gather information necessary for copyright enforcement.\n\n2.9.5.10 Data Availability\n\nThe University will take reasonable precautions to guard against corruption of data or software or damage of data stored on the University resources. Backups will be taken on a regular basis of all data residing on servers regulated by the University. In the best interest of the user, it is strongly recommended that the user should make backups of critical data. Under no circumstances does the University assume liability for the loss of information.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 24\n\n2.9.5.11 University Technology Resources Discipline\n\nAll users of the University’s technology resources must remember that access is a privilege and that the individual is responsible for the individual’s actions. The user must adhere to the guidelines and act in an effective, ethical, moral, and lawful manner. See paragraph 2.9.2.3.\n\n2.9.6 Change Policy\n\nDefinition: Change management is necessary to minimize risk from changes made to Chaminade systems. The goal of change management is to:\n\n1. Enable changes to be efficiently scheduled and documented.\n\n2. Allow all affected parties to ensure that their operations will not be negatively affected.\n\n3. Provide an audit trail of changes.\n\nCoverage: This policy covers all modifications to computers, servers, network infrastructure, applications, and web pages (excluding web page content). The precise procedures shown below apply to machines using the Windows operating system. They will be adapted for other operating systems (such as Macintosh) on a case-by-case basis.\n\n2.9.6.1 Classrooms (including H121, H37, and H124)\n\nPolicy\n\n1. All Windows-based computers in classrooms and labs will have the basic Chaminade suite loaded. This will be loaded from a master CD to ensure consistency. Macintosh and other non-Windows machines will have software loaded on a case-by-case basis.\n\n2. All software versions on all machines in a given room will be the same.\n\n3. Software will be loaded once each year (in August).\n\n4. Additional programs may be loaded on machines at the discretion of IS&L, but only if requested one week before needed for single-computer classrooms and three weeks for multi-machine classrooms and labs and providing proof of a valid license is available. This assumes the software is available on campus; if software must be ordered, order and shipping times are in addition to these. Only software known not to conflict with existing applications will be loaded. The requestor is responsible for providing funding for any software requested in this way.\n\n5. Computers will be configured to return to the basic configuration (including changes made under step 4, above) each time a reset occurs.\n\nProcedure\n\n1. The basic Chaminade software suite will be posted on the web portal.\n\n2. In February of each year, a software proposal for Fall will be published to all users (i.e., via the faculty mailing list)\n\n3. Faculty will be given two weeks to comment and propose changes and additions.\n\n4. Recommended changes and additions will be forwarded to all users. These recommendations may be annotated by IS&L.\n\n5. In March, a general meeting will be held of interested parties to finalize the software suite for the following Fall.\n\n6. A final list will be published before April 30. While every attempt will be made to accommodate requests, IS&L will determine the final configuration.\n\n7. All changes and any unexpected results will be recorded in the Chaminade change log.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 25\n\n2.9.6.2 Desktop (office) machines\n\nPolicy\n\n1. All Windows-based machines will be loaded with the basic Chaminade suite. Macintosh and other non-Windows machines will have software loaded on a case-by-case basis.\n\n2. Users will not be given administrator rights.\n\n3. Additional software may be loaded if requested and providing a valid license is available, but not if it would interfere with Chaminade operations.\n\nProcedures\n\n1. The basic Chaminade suite for office machines will be posted on the web.\n\n2. Additions and modifications will be requested through a web form.\n\n3. Once each year the basic suite and instructions for requesting modifications will be sent via email to faculty and staff\n\n4. All changes and any unexpected results will be recorded in the Chaminade change log.\n\n2.9.6.2.1 Purchase of Computers\n\nPolicy\n\nComputers purchased through IS&L (even if charged to non-IS&L budgets):\n\n• Are added to the university-wide inventory\n\n• Are replaced on a regular basis\n\n• Are loaded with standard software\n\n• Are maintained by IS&L\n\nComputers which are not purchased by IS&L:\n\n• Are not replaced as part of the regular cycle\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 26\n\n• May not have the ability to receive the standard software suite\n\n• Cannot be maintained by IS&L\n\n• Must be configured by IS&L before they are connected to the Chaminade network\n\nModifications and exceptions to this policy are made under certain circumstances. Two common exceptions are:\n\n1. Computers purchased as part of a grant:\n\n• These computers should be purchased through IS&L whenever possible\n\n• When required by the grant they may be purchased directly\n\n• They are not added to the cyclical replacement list\n\n2. Macintosh computers:\n\n• Macintosh computers (including laptops) may be purchased instead of Windows.\n\n• Unit funds must be used for any cost over the price of our standard machine (currently $1,200)\n\n• They are added to the replacement cycle, but the excess cost rule above applies to replacements\n\n• Only limited maintenance is available for Macs; AppleCare must be purchased\n\n• It is recommended that Windows be loaded as well as the Mac operating system\n\nRationale\n\nAs dependence on our network for all phases of the University’s operations increases, it has become essential that all computers which connect to our network (including access to the internet only) be easily identifiable. Past experience with single computers using our entire bandwidth has shown the necessity for being able to pinpoint problems to a specific computer, and to know where it is located. It has always been University policy that information on all computers resides in a single database. Each fall we conduct an inventory of all Chaminade computers and network printers, regardless of the funds used to purchase them or the location of the computer on campus.\n\nNormally all computers purchased with Chaminade University funds are purchased through Information Services and the Library. There are many reasons for this policy: it reduces the number of computer models to promote efficient maintenance practices, allows for a standard software package to be easily installed (installation of nonstandard software can also be accomplished on these machines if requested), ensures that the computers have sufficient capacity to perform in Chaminade’s environment, allows IS&L to contact vendors for repairs and parts, and ensures the security of our network. Normally computers ordered this way take about three weeks, from the time the purchase order is signed, to be delivered to the individual or unit.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 27\n\n2.9.6.2.2 Administrator Accounts on University Computers\n\nPolicy\n\n1. Generally, only Least-privileged User Accounts (LUAs) are made available to endusers.\n\n2. If a user needs to have software installed on their computer, a service request is made through the help desk. If the software installation falls within the software policy, it will be installed within five working days, assuming the request is for installation on a standard Chaminade PC.\n\n3. Exceptions to this policy are occasionally made when absolutely necessary (e.g., certain federal programs and grants which require frequent downloading of software). In such cases a separate user account with administrative privileges is installed on the PC and the end-user is asked to sign an MOU indicating that he or she will use that account only when necessary.\n\nRationale\n\nChaminade’s policy on Administrator Accounts is based on a number of factors.\n\nWe are in the enviable position of not having been the victim of a major computer virus attack in over six years. With the central importance of computers and of network operations, it is essential that this situation continue. A successful attack would mean that, for the period it would take to clean the network and restore operations, no students could be registered, no faxes could be received or sent, no email could be sent or received, no telephone calls could be made, and no invoices could be paid. While there are manual processes which could allow limited access to some of these services, the effects on the University would be severe.\n\nWe have put in place several levels of protection, beginning with a robust firewall to prevent direct attack. However, the literature suggests, and experience confirms, that a major source of viruses and other malicious software is accidental infection through users visiting infected websites. Limiting the ability of rogue sites (which often are unaware that they have been hacked) to install malicious software (malware) is a primary tool in preventing infection. This implies using Least privileged User Accounts (LUAs) for all University computers.\n\nEven if a virus infection does not spread to or through the network, accidentally downloaded malware has the potential to disrupt University operations. A primary tool for hackers is the key logger: software which runs in the background records all keystrokes (including passwords) and sends this data to the hacker’s site. Should a key logger be inserted, the potential exists for a hacker to mimic any legitimate Chaminade employee, with access to any applications that the person uses.\n\nOf course, an individual’s ability to perform their daily tasks can be affected by such software, even if the downloaded malware is “harmless.” The simple fact that many unknown programs are running in the background on a computer is enough to slow that system down and make it unusable.\n\nFinally, when problem software is intentionally or accidentally installed, a service call is necessary to remove the malware and return the system to normal operation. This affects IS&L’s ability to perform other maintenance, and slows down service to everyone.\n\nAs a result of these well-documented problems and dangers, and based on industry best practices, Chaminade has a policy of installing LUAs for all end-users.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 28\n\n2.9.6.2.3 Instillation of Software\n\nPolicy\n\nBoth for ethical reasons and to avoid the imposition of penalties and fines (with their concomitant negative publicity), Chaminade University strives to ensure that all software installed on University-owned computers (whatever its source) is either owned or licensed to the University. This implies, among other requirements, that multiple installations not be made unless the software is licensed for multiple users. We also are prevented by licensing requirements from installing software licensed to the University on non-Chaminade-owned computers. The way these policies are implemented depends partially on how the hardware and software are obtained.\n\nA careful reading of the above shows that there are at least three variables involved in our policy:\n\n1. Ownership of the computer\n\n2. Source of the software (i.e., ownership of the software or its license)\n\n3. Method of acquisition of the hardware and software\n\nProcedure\n\nSummaries of procedures for each case are shown below:\n\n1. Hardware purchased through IS&L (including hardware purchased with unit and grant funds):\n\nA. Software purchased through IS&L\n\n• The standard suite will be installed on all machines, unless it is specifically requested that it not be.\n\n• Any user-requested software purchased through IS&L will be installed.\n\n• IS&L will retain all disks, CDs, and DVDs (and, in the case of downloaded software, ID numbers, etc.).\n\nB. Software purchased directly by the units or by individuals using University funds:\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 29\n\n• IS&L will attempt to install the software (not all software can be installed on all machines).\n\n• If the software is unable to be installed, the disks will be returned to the requestor.\n\n• If the software is installed, IS&L will retain all the disks, CDs, and DVDs (and, in the case of downloaded software, ID numbers, etc.).\n\n• In the case of software licensed for multiple installations, IS&L will retain the all disks, CDs, and DVDs (and, in the case of downloaded software, ID numbers, etc.), and maintain a record of the number of installations performed. No installations will be performed beyond that permitted by the license.\n\nC. Downloadable software not acquired by purchase (e.g., “shareware”, demo software):\n\n• Download and installation will be performed by IS&L upon request, providing that a valid and acceptable license is included.\n\n• A waiver of liability indicating that the installation conforms to the licensing requirements and accepting responsibility for the use of the software will be signed by the requestor.\n\nD. Personally-owned software\n\n• Personal software will be installed on University-owned machines only at the request of the unit’s dean or director\n\n• A waiver of liability stating that the installation does not violate licensing provisions and accepting all responsibility for the installation’s legality will be signed by the user and the dean or director.\n\n2. Hardware purchased directly by the unit:\n\nA. The provisions above apply.\n\nB. While effort will be made to install software within 5 days of a request being received, installation may be delayed until scheduled installations on computers purchased through IS&L is completed.\n\nC. In addition, it must be understood there is no guarantee that software can be installed on computers not purchased or recommended by IS&L.\n\n3. Personally-owned hardware:\n\nA. University owned software is not installed on personally-owned computers, even if they are used for University work.\n\nB. While, as a courtesy, IS&L staff may advise or assist individuals with software installation on their personally-owned computers, pressure of University tasks frequently prevents this.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 30\n\n2.9.6.3 Administrative Software\n\n2.9.6.3.1 ERP (Colleague)\n\n1. Policy\n\na. Upgrades and bug fixes\n\n• All changes to ERP software will be accomplished by MIS.\n\n• Software changes being considered will be reviewed by IS&L and by affected units before being implemented in production. The final decision on whether to implement a change will be made by IS&L.\n\n• Changes will be tested before being implemented in production.\n\nb. Requests for additional modules and functionality\n\n• Suggestions for additional modules and functionality may be initiated by\n\nIS&L or by users.\n\n• The medium for suggestions will be a web form on the web portal, which will capture the requestor, the suggested software, a description of the improvements anticipated, the source of the software, and a statement of both initial and continuing costs along with an account to charge.\n\n• The suggested upgrade will be posted on the web portal, and a general message will be sent to the Chaminade community giving the URL of the description.\n\n• Comments will be accepted on the advisability of the requested software.\n\n• A decision will be made by IS&L in consultation with the Chaminade community, and that decision will be posted on the web portal.\n\n• Requests which are accepted will be implemented following the procedures below.\n\n2. Procedures\n\na. Upon notification that a change (including regular software upgrades and bug fixes) has been requested and approved, MIS will first install the change in the test database and check that no obvious problems result.\n\nb. Once the preliminary check has been made by MIS, notice will be sent by email to units which will obviously be affected (e.g., the business office will be informed about changes to the financial module). The purpose and anticipated effects will be described. Users will be instructed to access the test database to ensure that there are no adverse effects from the new software.\n\nc. The changes (purpose and anticipated effects) will be posted on the web portal for comment by the general Chaminade community.\n\nd.

Departments may have additional faculty members on the list who regularly use the vans for class field trips and activities. This list serves to limit the number of van drivers for liability purposes. The Student Support Services Coordinator maintains the driver list.\n\n2.10.5 Certification Procedure\n\n1. Review Vehicle Use and Driver Responsibilities Policy\n\nAll employees and students interested in becoming van certified must meet with the Student Support Services Coordinator and review van user policies and certification procedures.\n\n2. Van Fleet Operation: Department Head/Advisor Form\n\nThis form serves as an agreement between the van driver and their department head/advisor. It is important that the department heads and advisors are aware of who is driving on behalf of their department/club/organization, and to ensure that the driver will abide by the regulations of the Chaminade University Van Usage Policy. Failure to adhere to the policy may subject the driver to disciplinary action through the University, and van privileges may be revoked from the individual and/or sponsoring department/club/organization.\n\n3. Driver’s Abstract/Annual Renewal\n\nAll University employees and students seeking certification must present:\n\n• A valid driver’s license\n\n• An abstract of the driving record from the state of license (requested by Student\n\nSupport Services Coordinator).\n\n• Driver will be disqualified if he/she has:\n\na) Been convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in the last seven years.\n\nb) Any serious violations within the last three years. Serious violations may include speeding, unsafe lane changes, following too closely, and at fault auto accidents. In addition, the following offenses may result in suspension or termination of driving privileges (as determined by the Associate Dean of Students/Dean of Students).\n\n• Operating a vehicle without a valid driver’s license.\n\n• Failure of a driver to report suspension or revocation of his/her driver’s license.\n\n• Operating a vehicle outside of the scope of the destination or school-related activity.\n\n• Violating any of the safety criteria listed within these policies.\n\n• Operating a vehicle in a reckless or unsafe manner.\n\n• Failure to report an accident involving a University vehicle to CUH Security or to the Student Services Coordinator/Associate Dean, and/or failure to report a traffic violation incurred during use of a University vehicle to the Student Services\n\nCoordinator/Associate Dean.\n\nAn annual review of all drivers’ abstracts will be conducted.\n\n4. Vehicle Safety Video\n\nAll University employees and students seeking certification are required to view a 30-minute video provided by the Christian Brothers Services (Chaminade University’s insurance company). Viewing of this video may be scheduled with the Student Support Services Coordinator.\n\n5. Road Test: Road Test Certification/Driver Approval Form\n\nA one-hour test drive with the Safety Officer (or the person appointed by the Safety Officer) will be conducted. Driver & Safety Officer must complete the Road Test Certification Approval Form to confirm whether or not the driver has passed and has understood the Van Driver Policies & Agreement.\n\nThe Student Support Services Coordinator will schedule the driving test. Two missed Road Certification appointments by a driver will result in no further appointments by that driver until the following semester.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 35\n\n2.10.6 Reserving a Van\n\n1. Special Cases\n\nUse of Chaminade University vans will be on a first come, first served basis, with the exception of reservations for Athletics and for academic classes.\n\n2. Van Usage Calendar\n\nAll University employees and students may view van availability in the Van Calendar located under “Vans” in https://portal.chaminade.edu/resources/calendars/Pages/default.aspx.

Reservation Notifications\n\n• Reservation on the day of will be accepted unless vans are unavailable.\n\n• Only the driver(s) indicated on the request form, listed on the web portal calendar, and who have completed the Van Driver Agreement form (given on the day of usage) is (are) allowed to check out, drive, and return the van.\n\n• Should the request be canceled, the Student Support Services Coordinator must be informed immediately to accommodate other van drivers. In the event of a weekend cancellation, please inform Security – (808) 690-2301.\n\n• Use of vans leaving after 10pm, returning between midnight and 6am, as well as overnight trips, require the approval of the Dean of Students.\n\n• Failure to notify the Student Support Services Coordinator or Security about any changes/cancellations may result in loss of privileges.\n\n5. Day of Usage\n\n• On the day of usage, the driver (i.e. the individual listed on the web portal calendar for that specific reservation) must report to the University Security office to obtain the van keys. He/she will be required to provide both his/her driver’s license and his/her Chaminade ID for identification purposes.\n\n• Should any security officer be absent, you may contact them at (808) 690-2301.\n\n• Complete Van Driver Agreement form. This form must be completed by the approved drivers each time a van is checked out through the Security Office. Only the individual(s) signing this form may operate the van at the approved times.\n\n• Review the condition of the van prior to departure: check glass, tires, etc., and report any discrepancies to the Security office. Security will also ask the driver to sign off on the condition of the van prior to departure.\n\n• Notify Security of any problems prior to departure.\n\n• Check to make sure that the van’s insurance and registration are in the glove compartment, and that the emergency procedures are on the driver’s side visor.\n\n• Adjust the mirrors before leaving and remind passengers to use seat belts. It is the driver’s responsibility to ensure that all passengers are wearing their seat belts.\n\n• The driver must have a “ground guide” (i.e. someone that can guide him/her while reversing the van).\n\n• The driver may not use a cell phone while driving – be it with a hands-free device or otherwise. The driver is also not allowed to use headphones or headsets of any kind while driving.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 36-37\n\n2.10.7 Van Maintenance\n\nUniversity vans are maintained on a weekly basis by Chaminade University’s Facilities department. Maintenance will take about an hour to clean vans in the morning, during their designated day (see Van calendar located under “Vans”).\n\nVans may be suspended for a day or more when maintenance is required. Such a situation is unpredictable. The Student Support Services Coordinator or University Security will notify drivers as promptly as possible.\n\nPlease report/make note of any negative conditions with the van’s exterior and interior prior to departing, and return the van in clean condition. Trash bags will be provided.\n\n2.10.8 Emergency Procedures\n\nPlease review the following in the event of an emergency:\n\n1. For any problems with the van while in use (flat tire, red light in oil indicator, etc.),\n\nplease pull over, park immediately, and contact the Security office at (808) 690-2301.\n\n2. In the event of an accident, call the police (dial 911) and:\n\n• Check for injuries. Do not move an injured individual unless you have to in order to prevent other injuries.\n\n• Move and keep everyone in a safe location.\n\n• Obtain the other driver’s name, license plate number, address, and telephone number. Obtain the other driver’s insurance company and policy number.\n\n• Take a picture if possible.\n\n• Request a police report number from the police.\n\n• After everything is settled with the other driver and the police, please report the incident and all related information to Chaminade University’s Security office upon return.\n\n• Chaminade University is not responsible for any violations and citations caused by the driver.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 38\n\n2.11 Institutional Advancement Policies\n\n2.11.1 Gift Acceptance Guidelines\n\nPlease see Appendix 2.11.1\n\n2.11.2 Media Management Policy and Procedure\n\nSee the Emergency manual\n\n2.12 University Management Policy and Procedure\n\n2.12.1 Graduating Students with Outstanding Balances\n\nStudents with outstanding balances will not receive a diploma or transcript. The following procedure is followed for graduating students with outstanding balances.\n\n1. In September and February, we circulate flyers to various offices, advising students of this policy and the payment deadline. A sample flyer is attached. Offices include the Bookstore (for students who measure for their cap and gown), Day, and Evening and Graduate program offices, Advising, Registrar and Financial Aid. Flyers are also posted at the Business Office\n\ncashier’s window, in the Library, and on bulletin boards around campus. A notice is also posted in the On-Campus.\n\n2. Once we receive a list from the Registrar’s Office of the students who have petitioned for graduation, we check all account balances and mail letters to those with a balance. This letter is usually mailed at least one month prior to the payment deadline. To prevent any misunderstandings, it is very important that students clear their accounts with the Business Office and not verify clearance through other offices.\n\n3. One week after the payment deadline, we route a list of the remaining students who have not cleared their accounts to the following offices: Bookstore (students will be stopped from picking up their cap and gown), Advising, Registrar, Financial Aid, Day, Evening and\n\nGraduate program offices, Dean of Enrollment.\n\nNote that students who insist on picking up their cap and gown will be allowed to do so, however, they will not be allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony until their balance is cleared.\n\n4. The Business Office is in constant contact with the Records Office regarding the list of nonparticipating students. The Records Office coordinates the printing of the graduation ceremony program. An effort is made to clear students to allow them to be printed in the\n\nprogram and participate in graduation ceremonies.\n\nThere are very few exceptions, if any, to this policy. All payment arrangements are made to accommodate this policy.\n\nChaminade University Policy Manual: Volume II – Page 39\n\n2.12.2 Cash Receipts\n\nAll payments to the University should be submitted within two days of receipt to the Business Office cashier’s window.\n\n1. Cash, checks and charges should be itemized on a Receipt Transmittal form. There are two types of transmittal forms:\n\n Tuition & Fee Receipt Transmittal (Exhibit 1) – This four-part form is used to submit payments on student accounts for tuition, fees, room and board charges, etc.\n\n Cash Receipts Transmittal (Exhibit 2) – This two-part form is used to submit all other non-student-related payments for example, gifts, grants, etc.\n\n2. If submitting payment via charge card, include the following information on the Transmittal:\n\n Name on the charge card\n\n Type of card (MasterCard, VISA, American Express, or Discover)\n\n Charge card number\n\n Expiration date\n\n Amount to charge\n\n Contact phone number\n\n3. The Receipt Transmittal should be filled out completely and submitted to the Business Office cashier’s window with the cash, checks and any supporting documentation. The cashier will acknowledge receipt of the funds by signing the Transmittal and returning one copy to the person submitting the form.\n\n2.12.3 Procedures for Handling Inter-Departmental Cash Receipts\n\nA. Upon receipt of cash from Chaminade’s departments, the Cashier counts the cash and verifies the amounts given. If amounts are correct, the Cashier initials and dates the “Cash Receipts Transmittal” and returns the yellow copy to the department. The cashier files the white copy of the transmittal in a separate daily folder.\n\nB. Cashier prepares one receipt slip for each transmi"
