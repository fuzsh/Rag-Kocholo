When we’re accustomed to a low energy brain state and lulled by the comfort zone it creates, it’s difficult to rouse ourselves to act with intention and create the lives we truly want to lead.\n\nIn LIT, Jeff Karp, PhD, professor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and biotech innovator, helps us look to nature as a vital source of humankind’s best wisdom, most inspired action, and greatest good.\n\nDiagnosed with learning differences at a young age, he persisted through nearly insurmountable struggles with support from his mom in developing ways to achieve hyper-awareness and maximize decisions based on his curiosity, passion, creativity, and connection to nature. As a student at McGill University and at the University of Toronto, as a researcher at MIT, and as a professor at Harvard Medical School, he evolved these approaches into LIT (Life Ignition Tools) —and road-tested these tools daily in his own personal life and with his lab team to innovate medical discoveries inspired by the “problem solving” process they find throughout the natural world\n\nLIT teaches us to:\n\nturn inward and connect with what is truly important to us\n\nturn outward to act on that, connecting with others and different ways of knowing\n\nquestion assumptions—break out of habitual thinking and other patterns to discover what really serves you best\n\nnavigate multiple streams of sensory input and manage information overload\n\nrecognize manipulative messaging that can throw us off course\n\nexplore, experiment and discover fresh approaches to old challenges\n\nintercept routine patterns to actively think and decide versus just jumping in with habitual responses\n\nLIT takes us off autopilot and helps us stay alert, present, and fully engaged in our lives.\n\nDr. Karp also shares insights from some of the world’s most accomplished people, including Nobel Prize winners, the founder of an Indigenous wellness center, a visionary photographer, a social justice activist, a five-time US memory champion, an Olympic medalist, a neurosurgeon who founded a center for compassion, and numerous professors, inventors, entrepreneurs, CEOs, and members of his laboratory—all creatives in their own ways.\n\nUsing Dr. Karp’s principles, anyone can redirect their lives with energy, focus, creativity, motivation, intention, and impact to create the lives they truly want to lead. Learning to be lit is the ultimate renewable energy and is accessible to everyone, anytime, wherever you are.\n\nJeff Karp, PhD, is an acclaimed mentor and biomedical engineering professor at Harvard Medical School and MIT, a Distinguished Chair at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors. He has dedicated his research to bioinspired medical problem-solving, and his lab’s technologies have led to the formation of twelve companies. The technologies they have developed include a tissue glue that can seal holes inside a beating heart; targeted therapy for osteoarthritis, Crohn’s disease, and brain disorders; “smart needles” that automatically stop when they reach their target; a nasal spray that neutralizes pathogens; and immunotherapy approaches to annihilate cancer. Dr. Karp is also head of innovation at Geoversity, Nature’s University, a rainforest conservancy located in one of the top biodiversity hotspots in the world. He was selected as the Outstanding Faculty Undergraduate Mentor among all faculty at MIT and the top graduate student mentor of Harvard-MIT students. Dr. Karp lives in Brookline, Massachusetts, with his wife, children, and two Cavalier King Charles spaniels.\n\nGORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCE ON DRUG RESISTANCE\n\nShared Principles in Drug Resistance Across Diverse Biological Systems\n\nJune 23-28, 2024\n\nBryant University\n\n1150 Douglas Pike, Smithfield, Rhode Island (Venue and Travel Information)\n\nApply Here\n\nChairs\n\nAlexis L. Kaushansky and Amir Mitchell\n\nVice Chairs\n\nPriscilla L. Yang and Zemer Gitai\n\nContact Chairs\n\nApplication Information\n\nApplications for this meeting must be submitted by May 26, 2024. Please apply early, as some meetings become oversubscribed (full) before this deadline. If the meeting is oversubscribed, it will be stated here. Note: Applications for oversubscribed meetings will only be considered by the conference chair if more seats become available due to cancellations.\n\nConference Description\n\nThe Drug Resistance GRC is a premier, international scientific conference focused on advancing the frontiers of science through the presentation of cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages. The conference program includes a diverse range of speakers and discussion leaders from institutions and organizations worldwide, concentrating on the latest developments in the field. The conference is five days long and held in a remote location to increase the sense of camaraderie and create scientific communities, with lasting collaborations and friendships. In addition to premier talks, the conference has designated time for poster sessions from individuals of all career stages, and afternoon free time and communal meals allow for informal networking opportunities with leaders in the field.\n\nDrug resistance is a threat shared across multiple fields in medicine and agriculture. It is a primary area of ongoing basic, translational, and biotechnological research that often exists within siloed areas of research. The Drug Resistance Gordon Research Conference aims explore concepts and principles that transcend individual fields in drug resistance by assembling a multidisciplinary community of academic researchers, industry scientists, physicians, educators, and other stakeholders studying different aspects of drug resistance. The 2024 meeting will bring together investigators who study drug resistance in cancer, infectious disease, agriculture, and newer areas to the drug resistance space, such as neuroscience. We are particularly interested in welcoming researchers who utilize genomics, systems biology, chemical biology and different facets of quantitative research to inform our collective thinking on resistance. By learning about a diverse tools and approaches used by different communities we aim to uncover new strategies that overcome the challenges of drug resistance in individual organisms and across populations broadly.\n\nThe conference will recruit participants with diverse backgrounds, providing opportunities for students and young investigators to present their research through poster and oral presentations. This meeting has been historically characterized by strong interaction between investigators that do not interact in traditional forums; we plan to continue this tradition and invite researchers who don’t necessarily consider themselves part of the “drug resistance” community to join us: we welcome new voices and ideas!\n\nApplicants interested in presenting their work as a contributed talk should indicate so on the submitted abstract (all sessions have multiple slots allocated for contributed talks). Applications by April 30 will be considered for oral presentations, applications made after this date will only be considered on the basis of available time slots.\n\nINVITATION FOR GEM BIO WORKSHOP AT ICLR 2024\n\nWe are delighted to invite you and your colleagues to an upcoming workshop, “Integrating Generative and Experimental Perspectives for BioMolecular Design” (GEM) at the ICLR Conference in Vienna on May 11th, 2024.

Boston’s healthcare professionals and administrators are adopting practices from other high-risk and service industries. The ‘big data’ movement is thriving, fundamentally changing our healthcare delivery systems. Digital health investments are higher than ever before. Medical hackathons and un-conferences are now an every-weekend occurrence. And both redesign and innovation promise to change medicine as we know it. It’s all happening right here, right now. But the problem is that many of us don’t know it. Despite Boston’s innovative energy and a solid medical infrastructure, many medical providers and health care entrepreneurs remain in the dark about the opportunities, events and work happening in and around the city of Boston – and across the country. That’s where we come in.\n\nAt Medtech Boston, we highlight exciting medical innovation work in and around the city of Boston. We aim to start a discussion about the most exciting and controversial new healthcare offerings, igniting a new reputation for Boston as a city with first-class medical research and patient care, but also as a city full of passionate people who use new technology to think big thoughts about medicine’s most pressing problems.\n\nMore organizational information and event postings from Medtech Boston is available here.\n\nBRAINMAP SEMINARS\n\nFuture topics will be similar to the previous Brainmap season, with some talks on Optogenetics, MR-PET, BOLD physiology, ultra-high field MRI, multimodal integration, contrast agents, and many more exciting topics!

Organoids are a relatively recent exciting development in the MPS field capturing more interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic aspects of tissue complexity in terms of cell types and architecture. However, the conventional use of organoids as tissue models have a number of limitations including a lack of vasculature and perfusion which stunts growth and leads to necrosis, a lack of long range tissue coherence, and a lack of a facile method of longitudinally interrogating the organoid. The next generation of neural models will address these limitations by combining advances in multiple fields including 3D printing techniques to spatially organize the tissue, multiplexed microfluidic interfaces to perfuse, interrogate and control the delivery of key nutrients and morphogens, multiplexed electrical interfaces to non-invasively monitor the synaptic brainwave activity, and directed iPSC differentiation to model specific regions of the brain. We are seeking students interested in developing the hardware and materials breakthroughs to combine these technologies in novel ways to enable more predictive and physiologically relevant neural models.\n\nDraper’s Bioengineering division is a multidisciplinary team of engineers and scientists organized to support our nation’s interests in biotechnology, biodefense, and biomedical engineering. Draper Scholars conduct research and apply it to real-world challenges in biotechnology systems, space systems, electronic systems and strategic systems, under the guidance of a Draper supervisor and an academic advisor from their university. We work to have a cohesive learning environment to help our scholars grow into the next generation of innovators.
