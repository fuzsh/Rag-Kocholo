        "text": "Personal branding:\n\nIt seems to be the \"hot\" new thing on the block these days. Even though this concept has been around for quite some time, it's becoming more and more expected in this uber-competitive workforce we live in. In fact, I tell my students and clients that it could quite possibly be the most important thing that you do regarding your job hunt even though it isn't directly related to it.\n\nSo with this mind, the questions I hope to answer here are what, why, and how. What is personal branding, why is it important, and, most importantly, how to go about developing an impactful personal brand.\n\nWhat is personal branding?\n\nLet's start with a quick experiment. When you think of the car company Ford, what thoughts, images, and emotions come up? For most, especially here in Michigan, the thought of Ford brings to mind images of hard work, grit, blue collar values, and sensibility. Their marketing campaign is tailored around the working middle class.\n\nNow think for a moment about the car company Mercedes. Think now of what thoughts, images, and emotions start coming up for you. If you're like most, its vastly different than the ones you were getting from Ford. Why? Branding.\n\nMercedes, has a different brand to appeal to a different audience. Their brand is built around highlighting luxury and convenience, rather than function and practicality, so their market is more centered on individuals of higher socioeconomic status. This is really the essence of all branding, but with personal branding it is individualized to one person rather than a company.\n\nYour personal brand is essentially the message you give to others about what you do, what values you represent through your product or services, and who are the individuals or groups you serve.\n\nWhy is personal branding important?\n\nA properly posted job opening can field anywhere from 250-500 applicants on average. What's worse, according to an article on Workopolis, only 2% of all applicants get job interviews! This is a crippling amount of competition, who are in the running for the same position you are. Many of them are just as qualified, having the same degree, the same experience, and the same knowledge you do. In this uber-competitive job market, it is critical to have every advantage you can to land those interviews.\n\nThe goal of any smart job seeker is to put themselves in a position to no longer be just an number on an applicant tracking system. Being just a number or a score doesn't distinguish you from a dog. Literally. Nationally-recognized job search expert Don Asher conducted an experiment in which he applied to 100 major companies using a resume for a dog named Rex K. Nine. The outcome? The companies responded back with a generic message thanking him for applying. This solidifies any doubt that these computer systems can't tell you're the best candidate.\n\nWith that flawed of a system, mixed with the overwhelming amount of competition for each position, the key is to stand out way before you ever get in line. This can be accomplished through personal branding.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that personal branding will not only be important in the future but you may want to consider it required. Over the next decade, we will begin to see a shift in how companies recruit for talent and gone will be the days of tirelessly searching for jobs. Instead, companies will begin developing programs to recruit and develop top talent. These \"Talent Management/Acquisition Systems\" focus on providing strategic assistance to organizations in the accomplishment of long-term enterprise goals with respect to talent, or human capital. So, this means that distinguishing yourself through personal branding will no longer be a luxury.\n\nSo how do you develop a personal brand?\n\nEstablishing an effective personal brand can be accomplished by doing a few things. The first key is to establish a expert level of proficiency in one area. In, today's world, being the \"jack of all trades and master of none\" can be a death sentence. As Tony Robbins eloquently puts it, \"We're drowing in information, but we're starving for wisdom\". As a consumer, we want experts. We don't want people that dibble dabble in everything. We want the people who really and truly understand our needs on a deep level. As such, when building your personal brand, your goal has got to be developing that same level of mastery in whatever your service is.\n\nThe second key to develop your personal brand is effectively marketing your expertise or service online. What good is it to be an expert if no one knows you are? Julien Gorden, career coach for millennials says, \"When people know, that you know, what you know, financial opportunities come\". One of the ways that I encourage people to accomplish this is through social media. We now live in a world where social media can greatly increase exposure and improve visibility to a certain audience that your services are available.\n\nAs a mental health professional, this is absolutely true in our industry. People want to have an idea of who they want to work with before ever setting up an appointment, Psychology Today is a resource for clients which allows them to discover professionals and learn about their areas of specialty and schedule appointments. When I have a profile advertised on Psychology Today my appointments go up three-fold compared to when I do not. It all has to do with having presence online and being accessible. Additionally, this adds to one's personal brand.\n\nIn another amazing example of the power of social media marketing, there was an incredible story of a business owner who consistently made around $250,000 for around a decade. After running a Facebook ad, he increased revenue to over $1,000,000 in a matter of 6 months! Simply put, being the expert is the first step, but the second is making sure you're in the position for people to see that you're the expert. Utilizing the internet and social media to touch your target audience is vitally important in today's world with so many online consumers and hundreds of millions of users on sites like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and so forth.\n\nThe final key in developing a strong personal brand is consistency. Whatever your message and your target audience, make sure your message is consistent about what you're there to deliver and how you can use your level of expertise to help others. If someone is looking at your personal website, your Facebook account, your biography page on your company website, or anything else, the message should all run parallel:\n\nThis is who I am.\n\nThis is what I know.\n\nThis is what I'm here to do."
