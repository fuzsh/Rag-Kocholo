Individuals selected under this vacancy announcement are eligible for the possibility of extensions or rehire in subsequent service years.\n\nA selectee receiving a first appointment to the Federal Government (Civil Service) is entitled only to the lowest step of the grade for which selected. The display of a salary range on this vacancy shall not be construed as granting an entitlement to a higher rate of pay.\n\nFor more information about the position, please contact:\n\nAaron Robinson\n\nNorth Cascades National Park\n\naaron_robinson@nps.gov\n\nShawn Maloney, Trails Supervisor\n\nPoint Reyes National Seashore\n\nshawn_maloney@nps.gov\n\nThe National Park Service has determined that the duties of this position are suitable for telework only during an emergency or natural disaster.\n\nThis announcement may be used to fill additional positions if identical vacancies occur within 90 days of the issue date of the referral certificate.\n\nNon-Competitive Rehire Eligibility: Effective May 26, 2018, please note that a temporary seasonal employee can only maintain their non-competitive rehire eligibility if they work no more than a combined total of 1,039 hours anywhere in the National Park Service (NPS) within their established service year. Accordingly, non-competitive rehire eligibility allows for re-appointment to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements (5 CFR 316.402[b][7]), based on series and grade, anywhere in the major subdivision (NPS).\n\nIf you have held a temporary seasonal appointment in the past 12 months, and have already worked the maximum 1,039 hours during that period, you are still welcome to apply. However, please be aware that exceeding the limit of 1,039 hours in your established service year will result in the loss of your non-competitive rehire eligibility. The limit can be exceeded by working multiple temporary seasonal positions that result in a combined total greater than 1,039 hours. The limit also can be exceeded by working a single temporary seasonal appointment that exceeds 1,039 hours, unless granted an exception by OPM."
