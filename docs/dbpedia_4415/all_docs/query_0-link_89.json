        "text": "Get the full picture on exempt compliance\n\nTax-exempt entities, including healthcare, education, social service, and public and private foundations, struggle with an ever-changing array of federal, state, local, and international tax-exempt compliance rules. We can help you manage your opportunities, challenges, and risks.\n\nStay on top of grant rules and regulations\n\nCorporate social-responsibility efforts need proper governance and oversight to comply with local tax and regulatory requirements. Our Grant Advisory Services can assist you with program policy and design, risk management, project terminations, and financial grants. Your grants are subject to portfolio assessment, pre- and post-funding review, fund administration, and troubled grants and diverted funds guidelines.\n\nManage your global tax-exempt requirements\n\nTax-exempt organizations that operate globally, as well as in the U.S., must comply with a broader spectrum of requirements. If you work in healthcare, higher education, development and government, private foundations and nongovernment organizations, or corporate citizenship services, we can help you comply, govern, and manage intellectual property, human resources, cash or other property repatriation, asset disposals, and more.\n\nTax-exempt bonds require extra consideration\n\nIf you’ve issued or may issue tax-exempt debt to fund capital expenditures, then you must comply with required private business use (PBU) of debt-financed assets. You can monitor and report ongoing business use with the KPMG PBU Tracker Tool and guidance from our tax-exempt debt specialists. We also review management agreements, lease arrangements, and sponsored-research agreements related to tax-exempt bond financing.\n\nGlobal trading tax compliance\n\nWith global trading, you’ll find added requirements and complexity. KPMG can help you calculate taxes and prepare returns, comment on investments for unrelated business income, assist with delinquent returns through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), obtain penalty abatement, determine tax cost and reporting requirements prior to investment, and look for refund and reclaim opportunities."
