The FuseNet Association brings together academia, research labs (including ITER) and industry, with the aim to stimulate and support fusion education, share and jointly develop educational tools, attract good students to fusion, stimulate student mobility and act as matchmaker between industry and research labs/academia for student internships. The FuseNet members have also agreed on academic criteria for the award of European Fusion Doctorate and Master certificates.",

        "text": "Nitrogen seeding in fusion reactors is an option to reduce the power loads on the tungsten divertor. A problematic by-product is of nitrogen seeding is ammonia, which eats up tritium that should be used as fuel instead. As a part of understanding how to minimise this ammonia production, this Master proposal aims at characterizing N2-H2 radiofrequency discharges produced at different conditions (e.g., input power, pressure, concentration) in the cylindrical metal-free chamber at the University of Basel, Switzerland.\n\nInternship proposals covering different aspects of fusion nresearch (physics and technology) are accessible on the our website http://irfm.cea.fr.\n\nThe direct link is here\n\nThere is no application deadline. If you are interested by any of these proposals, you can directly contact the supervisor indicated in the associated file.\n\nIPP endeavours to give young people a sound training through apprenticeships. Over 250 apprentices have hitherto successfully completed their training at IPP.\n\nAt Garching IPP provides apprenticeships in energy electronics, specializing in production technology and administration\n\nIPP Greifswald provides apprenticeships in: industrial equipment productions, information technology and industrial electronics (one apprenticeship)."
