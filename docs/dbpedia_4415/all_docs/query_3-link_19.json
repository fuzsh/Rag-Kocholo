        "text": "One of the first things you’ll need to know if you have an Ignition Interlock Device (or IID) installed on your vehicle is how to use it properly. That starts with learning how you should blow into an Ignition Interlock Device during a test. We provide hands-on training during your installation, along with a video demonstration. You can also get 24/7/365 guidance from our Care Center that can address any of your questions about the Smart Start Interlock testing procedure.\n\nStill, here’s a quick refresher about how to blow into our Ignition Interlock Device.\n\nBlowing Into an Ignition Interlock Device\n\nWe ensure that our Ignition Interlock testing procedure is easy and seamless. Other vendors require you to blow, then inhale from the device, which is a troublesome and sometimes unsanitary process. Compare that with Smart Start’s Ignition Interlock tests, which only last a few seconds. Our testing supports blow-only, humming only, or a combination of blowing and humming.\n\nEach state has different laws that regulate the correct breath pattern to blow into an Ignition Interlock Device. Be sure to use the breath pattern required by your state during an Ignition Interlock test.\n\nHere are the three simple test patterns we use. It’s always a good idea to rinse your mouth with water before a test to ensure the most accurate results possible.\n\nBlow-Hum\n\nThe blow-hum test requires the user to blow into the mouthpiece for a couple seconds, then transition into a hum by imitating an owl: Just say the word “whooooooooooo.” Keep your airflow consistent as you transition from blow to hum. You’ll hear a click sound from your device that tells you it’s the end of the test.\n\nBlow\n\nFor the blow, or no-hum, pattern, all you need to do is take a deep breath and blow continuously until you hear the clicking sound from your device. It won’t take long to learn how hard or soft to blow to get a successful test.\n\nHum\n\nThe easiest way to perform the hum pattern is to say the word, “whoooooooo” during the test. Keep humming steadily into the mouthpiece during your Ignition Interlock test until you hear the clicking sound from your device.\n\nRinsing with Water and Other Testing Tips\n\nWhy Smart Start is the Most Reliable Ignition Interlock\n\nIt’s not only Smart Start’s easy test patterns that will provide a stress-free Ignition Interlock testing procedure. It’s also the technology, with a robust, fuel-cell alcohol sensor that displays the most accurate results. You can also check your next appointment date or violation points remaining from the Interlock’s keypad.\n\nWhat if I Get a FAIL or VIOLATION on My Ignition Interlock?\n\nLet Smart Start Get You Back on the Road"
