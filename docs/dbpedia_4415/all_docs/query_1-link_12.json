        "text": "The 3 main ways to ruin web conversion: üìÖ 1. No meeting booking on your website If you require a demo to buy your product, make sure the prospect can schedule a meeting right there in the conversion flow. Emailing back and forth to schedule is ridiculous in 2024. > I recommend RevenueHero to add scheduling to your site. üí∞ 2. No plans & pricing page Prospects are looking for this page to make their decision, it's not optional. Start with a plans page w/o pricing if needed! > I (selfishly) recommend you read my latest newsletter to help you handle objections to adding transparent pricing to your website. üèÜ 3. Undifferentiated positioning Your homepage needs to tell people who your product is for, what your product is, & why it‚Äôs better‚Äîpreferably in the hero. > I recommend Ignition to help you do the audience & competitive research necessary to nail positioning. My 4th reasons is bad design, but trying to keep this list to things marketers can fix themselves. ‚¨á Links to my latest newsletters on pricing & positioning, plus one from last year on web conversion in the comments.\n\nAttention product managers: your job isn't just to ship the product. You have to know how to talk about it too. You can ignore me. But don't ignore Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb. \"If you don't know how you're going to talk about the product, then how are you going to build a good product?\" I spend just as much time with Derek Osgood as my product marketing counterpart, as I do with our engineering team. PMs need to deeply understand their target personas and how to position products to drive revenue. More and more of the role is about increased focus on go-to-market and sales enablement, not just shipping features.\n\nHuge thanks to Prakul Agarwal from MongoDB for hosting an insightful panel on building GenAI Apps at AI Engineer World Fair, alongside Gabriel P. and Chris Rec. üôå Some key takeaways: 1Ô∏è‚É£ We're all still figuring this out - While there's anxiety about competitors catching up, the reality is that we're all still in the early stages of figuring this out, especially on the app layer. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Time, money, and resources are being invested in foundational layers, but the app layer is where the real unlock happens. Just like skyscrapers, groundbreaking applications will be built on these foundations. 3Ô∏è‚É£ To extract true value however, apps need to be built from first principles with an AI-first approach. Workflows and automation take precedence over simply storing, categorizing, and collaborating with data and content. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Adding memory to pipelines is crucial for extracting real value, reducing hallucinations, and ensuring security and privacy. 5Ô∏è‚É£ RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation models) are still inefficient, and new techniques are emerging to address this. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Observability is critical, such as understanding which models perform best for specific use cases and recognizing the importance of fine-tuning. 7Ô∏è‚É£ While 95% of the world is still using GPT, it's essential to utilize a portfolio of models for different use cases. For large datasets, consider custom training open-source models. In summary, think back to when iOS and Android were first introduced. The real winners were the apps that followed, like Uber, Airbnb, and Instagram. Similarly, we're still early on the application side of GenAI, and Ignition is leading the way in the enterprise space. Exciting times ahead! What are your thoughts on the future of GenAI applications? Let's discuss in the comments below. üëá #GenAI #ArtificialIntelligence #EnterpriseAI #InnovationInAI #ProductManagement #IgnitionAI\n\nWe're excited to announce Ignition 2.0 (aka the Remix to Ignition, hot and fresh out the kitchen)! This is a completely revamped experience from the ground up, putting AI workflows and your market data at the center of everything. As the world‚Äôs first AI product manager/product marketer ‚Äî you can now use Ignition to instantly and continuously surface insights from competitive & customer data, build optimized roadmaps and go-to-market plans in seconds, then enable sales with upsell opportunities. It turns 90+ days of analysis, planning, and execution work into <90 seconds of real effort. üßê The problem we solve Ignition was built because product teams are increasingly being held accountable to revenue. But legacy product management tools were built to manage the engineering side of product, ignoring the importance of go-to-market. It‚Äôs left PMs starved for insight, drowning in fragmented (and costly) process, and relying on (lots of) manual effort from their PMM counterparts to just baseline get their products‚Äô story told. üßê How does Ignition 2.0 work? Ignition 2.0 infuses AI into every step of commercializing products: üîç Research ‚Äî AI continuously collects, categorizes, and analyzes both competitive and customer data from hundreds of sources, including customer calls/chats, to extract insights like feature asks, differentiators, and testimonials. ü§ñ Build ‚Äî AI automatically build roadmaps from ideas identified in that feedback, and map features to the customer accounts that asked for them. üöÄ Launch ‚Äî AI uses the context from *all* that data to generate optimized go-to-market plans and marketing assets for launch. üì£ Enable ‚Äî Automatically close the loop to Sales by notifying sales reps of which accounts to go upsell when features ship, so reps can act quickly to unblock stalled deals, and capture upsell opportunities. üßê What‚Äôs Changed: This is a bit of a caterpillar>butterfly moment for us. Even if you used Ignition 2 weeks ago, today‚Äôs launch involves a lot of change: ‚ûï Ignition 2.0 is more than Launch ‚Äî Our early followers know our roots lie in operationalizing launches. This is still a big part of our DNA, but Ignition has always been about holistic product success, and Ignition 2.0 brings together best-in-class tools for every part of that equation ‚Äî competitive intel, voice of customer analysis, roadmapping, campaign planning, and sales enablement. ‚ûï Ignition 2.0 is for Product Managers ‚Äî We still love our PMMs, but as Ignition‚Äôs workflow has expanded, we‚Äôve been working with PM teams closely to build the best PM platform for revenue-alignment, and Ignition 2.0 is focused on serving Product Management to an equal, if not greater extent. ‚ûï Ignition 2.0 is *magically* AI-native ‚Äî Beyond being *much* easier to use, I can confidently say no other platform for PMs or PMMs uses AI as uniquely or powerfully as Ignition 2.0. If you can dream it, we‚Äôve automated it.\n\nExcited to announce Ignition 2.0 (aka the Remix to Ignition, hot and fresh out the kitchen)!
