        "text": "Originally Posted by xj^REMY\n\ndon't have personal experience with the MSD Ignition or the \"team rush\" mod... but this intrigued me to look up some quick info...\n\ni had recently read a build project that involved a Ford 3.0 V6 distributor... he mentioned the reason for using it, was it uses a 6 event shutter wheel, as opposed to the Jeep 2 event shutter wheel... the shutter wheel in combination with the hall effect sensor send timing signals to the ECM, so it computes when to fire the upcoming plug... from what i have understood, there's no reason to upgrade HO 4.0's dizzy\n\nthe \"team rush\" mod looks to be an upgrade for carbureted 4.2L ... don't quote me on that... just all the quick info i've read is on the pre HO 258\n\nwhy are u wanting to do all this?... faster start-up? smooth out idle? better throttle response?\n\ni'd say for faster start-ups, upgrade your mains... i've got 1 AWG leads & grounds, 136A alt, & my start up was VASTLY improved\n\nsmoother idle & better throttle; upgrade injectors, spark plugs, intake tube/manifold, & exhaust\n\ni've also read, there's not much improvement with high end spark plugs... that you can't get better than a set of champions... i'll be going with e3's\n\nOriginally Posted by Heep_Heep\n\nI was thinking about upgrading the injectors but for my year Heep it is a real pain in the ***. My fuel pressure regulator is attached to the fuel sending unit. I don't see the point too in doing injectors without upgrading the ignition system first.\n\nyes, 96+ XJ's fuel pressure regulator (FPR) is in the tank with the sending unit, but filter is in-line, outside the tank... 97+ is all one module in the tank... changing injectors DOES NOT require increasing pressure, unless you've upgraded cam shaft or have higher compression... in which case you need to know if your engines fuel curve, which injectors to use with it & flow rate is needed... http://www.lunghd.com/Tech_Articles/...r_Upgrades.htm\n\nThe team rush mod is for a 4.2litre engine but I was hoping that it was so similar to our 4.0litre that it might work. They had the part numbers for the cap, rotor, and extension they used but I can find those parts anywhere.\n\nthere are significant differences between 4.0 & 4.2... & when it comes to the \"team rush\" mod... i think its only for carbureted systems, in which case there's HUGE differences (ECM, timing sensors, etc.)\n\nThe reason why I am looking to update the distributor cap and us an extension is to cut down on potential arching between the posts from using a CD(capacitive discharge) ignition box.(If this may even be the case.) I have not found any concrete evidence to support that this actually will occur but in theory it makes some sense.\n\nThe idea behind going with the MSD6A ignition box is to get a more consistent voltage to the plug, better fuel economy, quicker start up, more consistent power output, just a whole heck of a lot more efficient than our stock setup.\n\nthe HO 4.0 distributor is as consistent & efficient as possible... everywhere i've read about adding MSD ignition, say it's pointless... mild benefit for strokers... insignificant for N/A (naturally aspirated) 4.0's\n\nseriously, consider upgrading your mains... u WILL get quicker start ups & overall less voltage drop, allowing to utilize available voltage & amperage more efficiently\n\nI do know that the only plug that you should use for the older XJ's is the Champion copper core, you don't gain anything buy going with a different plug unless you update the ignition system.\n\nIMO, & i might be incorrect, but better air flow (intake & exhaust), better fuel atomization (VIA 4 hole injectors), & more efficient spark (e3's, double platinum, or iridium plugs) will produce better mileage & performance"
