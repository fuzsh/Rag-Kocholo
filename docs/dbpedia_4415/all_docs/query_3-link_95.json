Doors on escape routes should never be locked when anyone is in the building. Exit doors should be able to open easily and immediately, from the inside\n\nFire doors should be kept closed at all times. These can only be held in the open position by an electromagnetic hold-open device connected to the fire detection and alarm system\n\nImplement a regular system of inspection of first-aid fire fighting equipment, like fire extinguishers and hose-reels\n\nTest fire detection and alarm system and emergency lighting regularly, keeping a record of inspection results and action taken in the fire safety register\n\nEnsure that fire instruction notices are legible and visible\n\nEnsure that periodic fire evacuation drills are carried out\n\nTrain all members of staff to use first-aid fire fighting equipment and make sure they are prepared to take action in case of fire\n\nDo not allow the storage of combustible materials in staircase enclosures, under staircases or along escape routes, such as corridors\n\nTake adequate precautions when using paper or other flimsy materials for decorations, and never use cotton wool for this purpose.

In doing so, vital information can be relayed to the Fire Officer which will dictate the actions to be taken by the Fire Brigade\n\nWhat the fire brigade will want to know:\n\nIs everyone accounted for?\n\nIf anyone is missing:\n\nHow many? What is their usual location? Where were they last seen?\n\nWhere is the fire? What is on fire?

Another person should be nominated to co-ordinate the actions of staff in the event of fire. Arrangements should be made for a deputy or deputies to carry out the above duties in the absence of the nominated persons.\n\nIn smaller premises, one specific person shall be made responsible for organising staff training and for coordinating the actions of the staff in the event of fire. Arrangements should be made for a deputy to carry out the above duties in the absence of the nominated person."
