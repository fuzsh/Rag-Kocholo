        "text": "Most international students will have permission to work in the UK for a short amount of time after the end of your studies. If you want to stay and work in the UK after this then you will need immigration permission and visa sponsorship.\n\nWe provide access to Student Circus - a job search portal for current international students in the UK, which contains the following resources:\n\nA jobs board with skilled worker visa opportunities: verified, up to date full-time and internship job listings from employers who can sponsor international students in the UK\n\nImmigration advice: expert, vetted advice by immigration solicitors about working in the UK.\n\nCountry guides: locally-relevant recruitment insights and an overview of the job market for various countries if you’re planning to return home or relocate.\n\nCV builder: a place to edit and store CVs, however we would strongly encourage you to use our CV and resume resources and not to reply on templates.\n\nIgnition Hub: access to panel events, workshops, blogs and FAQs\n\nThe UK job market is highly competitive and it’s common for students and graduates to apply for job opportunities up to a year ahead of the employment start date. As well as strong academic results, recruiters in the UK are interested in your career motivations and look for a range of skills and competencies developed through studies, extra-curricular activities and work experience. It’s important to also have a good level of English language skills if English is not your first language.\n\nYour suitability for a role can be assessed through several criteria and it’s very important to be familiar with the UK style of writing CVs and application documents and how we interview job candidates. The UK style or recruitment might be very different from what you’ve previously encountered but we provide lots of information resources via our Application and interviews webpages and our Careers Events to help you.\n\nThere are two main types of graduate job routes in the UK\n\nGraduate Training Programmes (or Grad Schemes): are usually offered by large organisations that aim to recruit many graduates each year into a range of areas such as engineering, IT, finance, consultancy or management roles. These normally involve a structured training programme over one to three years. Many tend to open applications in August or September and deadlines can be as early as October while others remain open until March. If successful, you’ll usually start your job in the summer you graduate.\n\nDirect Entry Positions: can be found in any type of organisation when a position becomes available. Typically, these are often found in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) that generally do not need to hire many graduates, although larger employers do advertise too. Your training is often less structured than on a Grad Scheme but you may be offered the opportunity to work toward a qualification if relevant. Vacancies can be advertised at any time of the year but they can have an immediate start date so you may need to apply late in your degree or wait until you finish your studies.\n\nThere is no definitive list of companies that hire international students but the UK Home Office provides a Register of licensed sponsors which lists organisations who are licensed to sponsor work permits for workers coming from outside of the UK. This list is useful as a starting point for candidates seeking a visa but needs to be cross-referenced with current information on company careers pages or through speaking to the recruitment team. Recent WONKHE analysis explores which organisations sponsor international students and can be a useful tool to explore a variety of data.\n\nYou may be considering working outside of the UK during vacations or once you graduate. It’s possible to return home or explore another country and we can offer support by discussing your plans, helping you to evaluate what you have gained from your time at Imperial and help you to organise your job search.\n\nWe work with employers around the world and advertise many international vacancies via JobsLive but it’s important to note that we cannot be experts on every country. We do however provide information on our Working abroad webpages which includes access to GoinGlobal, a careers and employment resource with country specific advice, information and job postings.\n\nIf returning home or moving elsewhere you should consider the skills you’ve developed by studying in a foreign land away from friends and family. Recruiters are interested in your academic abilities and skills but they also want to see that you’ve developed an understanding of international cultures, improved your language skills, been resourceful, creative and developed resilience during your time at Imperial."
