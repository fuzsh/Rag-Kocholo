        "text": "Foreword\n\nThe modern world can feel like an increasingly dangerous place. The use of vehicles as a weapon to injure and kill people has become a real threat, which means people who operate and drive commercial vehicles need to act. It is vital that transport businesses adopt a responsible approach to security. The agencies, which are charged with protecting all members of society, have identified some simple and inexpensive procedures to assist operators, transport managers and drivers. That is why I am pleased to endorse the Department for Transport’s industry specific best practice guidance.\n\nThe guidance outlines the steps you can take to help keep the public and your organisation safe from attack.\n\nThe guidance covers:\n\nsecurity culture – including pre-employment checks for staff and drivers\n\nsite security – including vehicle access and operating centres\n\nvehicle security – including checking vehicles and what to do if a vehicle is taken\n\nIt also contains a top 10 list of actions for commercial vehicle drivers.\n\nOur key message is for you and your employees to take security as seriously as you take safety.\n\nRichard Turfitt, Senior Traffic Commissioner for Great Britain\n\nSection 1 – Introduction\n\nPurpose of this guidance\n\nThis guidance sets out straightforward steps that can help mitigate the threat of goods vehicles being used in vehicle as a weapon attack.\n\nAs well as helping to keep the public safe by deterring would-be attackers from using your fleet, following this advice will:\n\nhelp prevent acts of terrorism\n\nhelp protect your organisation’s reputation\n\ndemonstrate your commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nhelp to improve security culture within your business\n\nhelp reduce crime\n\nThe guidance covers security measures for:\n\nbuilding and embedding a positive security culture and behaviours\n\npersonnel security\n\noperating centres and maintenance facilities\n\ntransport managers and drivers\n\nvehicles\n\ngeneral security issues\n\nThe guidance sets out simple steps Transport Operators should take to promote a good security culture in their organisation and help keep drivers, sites and vehicles secure.\n\nA security checklist provides advice for drivers, to reduce the risk of their vehicles being stolen for use in an attack.\n\nLinks to a wide range of more detailed official guidance.\n\nRemember, good security = good business\n\nWhat is a Goods Vehicle?\n\nFor this guidance, the term ‘Goods Vehicle’ applies to a vehicle designed to carry goods or materials rather than passengers, from a small van to a large lorry.\n\nWhat is a Vehicle as A Weapon attack?\n\nA vehicle can be used as a weapon intentionally to injure and kill people. This is referred to as a ‘vehicle as a weapon (VAW) attack’.\n\nVAW is a low complexity methodology requiring little or no training. With a plentiful source of vehicles on UK roads, it is therefore within the capability of individuals to try and steal one and use it in an attack.\n\nCrowded public spaces are targeted by this type of attack. There are a range of online terrorist and extremist materials aimed at inspiring terrorists to carry out VAW attacks and previous attacks have encouraged copycats, who now see VAW as a successful means to cause terror. Lorries and vans pose an increased risk if used in VAW attacks because of their size, profile and weight, all of which increase the potential impact.\n\nThis is a real threat: there have been numerous VAW attacks in the UK and around the world in recent years, killing and injuring hundreds of innocent people.\n\nConsequently, VAW remains a likely attack methodology for the foreseeable future.\n\nFollowing this guidance will help reduce the possibility of one of your vehicles being used as a weapon.\n\nSection 2 – People, security culture and behaviours\n\nWhat is a security culture?\n\nA strong security culture will help mitigate security risks, including VAW by promoting compliance with security measures, awareness and vigilance.\n\nA security culture is a set of values, shared by everyone in an organisation, that determine how people are expected to think about and approach security.\n\nThe benefits of an effective security culture are:\n\na workforce that is more likely to be engaged with, and take responsibility for, security issues\n\nincreased compliance with protective security measures, such as those set out in this guidance\n\nreduced risk of insider incidents\n\nawareness of the most relevant security threats\n\nemployees are more likely to think and act in a security-conscious manner\n\nSecurity behaviours in your organisation\n\nA strong security culture will promote positive security behaviours across your workforce.\n\nUsing the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) 5Es framework (Educate, Enable, Shape the Environment, Encourage the Action and Evaluate the Impact) an organisation can embed and sustain security behaviours within their workforce.\n\nThe CPNI ‘Embedding Security Behaviours: using the 5Es Framework’ document provides guidance on how to implement the 5Es within an organisation .\n\nVigilance and reporting suspicious behaviour\n\nIn an emergency always ring 999. Security awareness, vigilance and reporting suspicious behaviour, increases the likelihood that people with hostile intentions will be detected or deterred.\n\nEmployee vigilance complements other elements of protective security (PDF, 1.8MB).\n\nProcedures for reporting any unusual behaviour to supervisors and police, should be developed and briefed to all staff.\n\nWe recommend reporting any concerns via the National Counter Terrorism Policing (NCTPHQ) Action Counters Terrorism (ACT) campaign:\n\n‘If you’ve seen or heard something that could suggest a terrorist threat to the UK do not ignore it, report it’.\n\nReport suspicious activity to the police by calling confidentially on 0800 789 321 or through the report in confidence service on the page: https://act.campaign.gov.uk.\n\nThe public already contribute intelligence to around a third of the most serious terrorism investigations. Staff should be reassured that they need not be concerned about wasting police time or getting someone into trouble.\n\nDue to the nature of security operations you may not hear back from the Police, this does not mean they have ignored you concerns.\n\nVigilance will be further promoted by putting in place systems for recording site security patrols, monitoring and checking visitors and vehicles.\n\nIdentification passes should be issued to staff and visitors and worn at all times. All staff should be encouraged to challenge anyone on your premises who is not wearing a pass.\n\nCompany security plan\n\nA security plan is the cornerstone of a secure goods vehicle operation that sets the basis for strong security behaviours, culture and security practice.\n\nA company security plan should cover at least the following steps, themes and elements:\n\nallocate security responsibilities to a staff member who has appropriate authority to make security-related decisions and implement them\n\nassess risks posed by your vehicle operations. Involve key business partners including customers, shippers, freight forwarders, carriers, security service providers, and insurance experts in the risk assessment, if possible. Define and understand the security risks in vehicle operations including the ‘insider threat’\n\nidentify possible solutions that will prevent one of your vehicles being used in an attack, while considering options, for example, that all vehicles should be locked when not in use. Security plans and procedures should be updated regularly. Collect feedback from drivers and consider the drivers’ needs and wishes in day-to-day vehicle security management. When implementing decisions ensure employees have been consulted. Undertake regular reviews to monitor results and progress\n\naltogether, when designing security plans, managers should consider the five-step model illustrated above which guides them through the most important aspects and themes of goods vehicle security management\n\nCountering the insider threat with pre-employment checks\n\nAn insider is a person who exploits, or has the intention to exploit, their legitimate access to an organisation’s assets for unauthorised purposes.\n\nInsiders with access to your processes and assets can be a source of threat. An insider could be a full time or part-time employee, a contractor or even a business partner. They could deliberately join your organisation to gain access to your organisation’s assets to mount an attack, or they may be triggered to act at some point during their employment.\n\nOrganisations should provide a trusted resource for staff to report security concerns or suspicions, either anonymously or otherwise, this is a positive way of nurturing a security culture within an organisation.\n\nRobust pre-employment checks for all employees can help mitigate the insider threat by:\n\ndeterring applicants who may wish to harm your organisation from applying for employment\n\ndetecting individuals with an intent to harm your organisation at the recruitment/application phase\n\nand denying employment to individuals intending to harm your organisation, and deny employment in roles for which the applicant is unsuitable\n\nRemember: deter - detect - deny\n\nConsideration should be given to using British Standard 7858 (or equivalent) for security screening of employees.\n\nThis standard involves conducting basic identity, financial, employment and criminal records checks. We recommend that the following additional steps are taken when employing drivers:\n\ncheck a driver’s references and previous employment history (minimum of five years)\n\nspeak to previous employers\n\ninform applicants that false details on application forms may lead to dismissal\n\ncheck driving licences are valid and look for endorsements before you employ someone, and then at six-monthly intervals afterwards. Drivers should tell you of any changes to their licence\n\ncheck if the applicant has any prosecutions pending or is waiting for sentencing by a court\n\nfor agency drivers, ensure that the agency has carried out all of these checks including criminal records checks\n\nand use only reputable recruitment agencies that are affiliated with a recognised UK trade organisation\n\nSection 3 – Site security\n\nSecure sites prevent vehicles being stolen and potentially used in terrorist attacks\n\nEffective security measures at operating centres and maintenance facilities can help to create a controlled environment which will encourage positive security behaviours amongst staff, act as a deterrent and protect from theft and other criminal activity.\n\nOrganisations can consult their local Counter Terrorism Security Advisers (CTSAs) to agree a system for reporting and dealing with suspicious vehicle incidents, and liaise with them regarding securing their sites. CTSAs work with businesses and the community to identify and assess sites that may be vulnerable to terrorist or extremist attack. They also work with trade organisations and professional bodies to ensure counter-terrorism protective security advice is incorporated into general crime prevention advice and guidance.\n\nBasic security measures can help to ensure that an item is not concealed onboard a vehicle when in maintenance centres. Having clear signage in place can discourage unwanted access by vehicles and people. Examples of site security measures:\n\nfit locks or tamper-proof seals to lockers and equipment boxes;\n\naccess to operating centres should be controlled with appropriate security arrangements i.e. fences, gates, security codes;\n\nvehicle keys should be stored in a secure locker with security codes. Keys should not be left in vehicles or on hooks in the office easily accessible to anyone\n\nVisitors and contractors\n\nAll visitors and contractors accessing the premises should be required to report to reception or an individual in authority to notify their arrival.\n\nVisitors should sign-in, be issued visitor passes and have a legitimate reason for their visit. These identification passes should be worn and ‘be visible’ at all times, anyone not wearing a pass should be asked by a member of staff why they are not wearing a pass. Visitors should be escorted at all times when not in public areas.\n\nThis process provides audit information, including sign-in/out times and the purpose of the visit, and can be crucial in the event of an emergency evacuation of the premises. Visitors and contractors should be given a security awareness briefing to include:\n\nwhere a pass is issued, it should be displayed prominently at all times while they are on the premises\n\nanyone without a pass or in an unauthorised area will be challenged\n\nif a vehicle has been parked on-site, any work/parking permits should be displayed prominently in the windscreen\n\nremind them to be vigilant when on the premises and of what to do if they see a suspicious item or a person acting unusually\n\nall doors should be properly closed when leaving, particularly doors leading to non-public areas\n\n“Tailgating” into non-public areas should not be allowed\n\nworksites and equipment should be secured on leaving\n\nVehicle access at sites\n\nThe movement of any unauthorised vehicles on site should be strictly controlled and ideally prevented\n\nIf this is unavoidable, appropriate access controls should be adopted, for example, a parking permit system for staff, visitor and contractor vehicles or allowing pre-arranged deliveries only.\n\nSecurity controls\n\nAll sites with parked vehicles that are not in use should be subject to security controls that include:\n\nphysical access barriers around the site such as walls and fences which should be in good repair and maintained to acceptable standards\n\naccess control measures at all entrances to prevent unauthorised access\n\nmeasures to protect vehicles on the site (locking of vehicles, regular patrols, or CCTV cameras to detect and monitor any unauthorised access)\n\nwherever possible vehicles, trailers and other material should not be parked/placed near or up against the fence, gates and walls as they may be used as climbing aids or cover from view from the CCTV cameras or guard force security patrols.\n\nOperating centres\n\nThe movement of any unauthorised vehicles at operating centres should be prevented or strictly controlled with appropriate access control measures.\n\nTransport Operators should consult their local CTSA to agree a system for reporting and dealing with suspicious vehicles, and liaise with them regarding evacuation plans.\n\nSecurity at Vehicle maintenance facilities\n\nIf your vehicles are repaired and maintained off-site you should ensure that the site’s security is appropriate. Maintenance staff, including sub-contractors should be made aware of your company’s vehicle security policies and procedures. The maintenance agreement between the vehicle operator and the vehicle maintenance company should include a duty to secure the vehicles and keys correctly.\n\nCCTV\n\nCCTV is central to most modern security systems.\n\nIts primary purpose is to detect suspicious activity and act as a verification system for other security measures. CCTV can be a single or combination of systems and technologies to form the overall security solution.\n\nWe recommend using an electronic detection system assured by CPNI, which can be sourced from the CPNI Catalogue of Security Equipment (CSE). Most of these work on the five-minute rule. This assumes that each part of a perimeter or sensitive asset is viewed by either a guard or CCTV once every five minutes. This limits the potential time for an unauthorised activity and forces an attacker to act rapidly, making them more likely to trigger an electronic detection system.\n\nUnsecure locations\n\nIt is not always possible for vehicles to be parked in a secure location when on route.\n\nA driver is a lone worker and it is important they feel safe and secure while working.\n\nIf parking in an unsecure location, operators should ensure that drivers satisfy themselves that the following checks are carried out:\n\nis the vehicle locked with windows closed? Do you have your keys on your person?\n\nhave you activated the vehicles security devices where applicable?\n\nhas anyone followed you, are you being watched?\n\nif possible, can you keep the vehicle in sight at all times?\n\nis the area well lit?\n\nwhen returning to your vehicle, does it look the same as when you left?\n\nare there any external factors that you could reasonably predict (e.g. weather) that could disrupt your route?\n\ndoes your company know where you are parking?\n\nare there parking areas recommended by others which they feel are safe and secure?\n\ndo not post your location on social media\n\nif you are approached or stopped by police, or an authorised public body, only open the cab door window after officers have shown their identification and inform your Transport Operator. If you suspect the individual is not an authorised officer, and they couldn’t produce their warrant card, keep the cab locked and stay in the vehicle, drive to the nearest Police Station or call 999\n\nbe mindful that the only public bodies with legal powers to stop you while driving are the Police, Driver Vehicle and Standards Agency (DVSA), Highways Authorities such as Highways England and those granted Community Safety Accreditation Scheme Powers (CSAS) powers by the Police. If in any doubt, call the Police\n\nSection 4 – Vehicle security\n\nChecking vehicles\n\nDrivers should visually check their vehicle at the beginning and end of their journey.\n\nAlso, whenever they leave or return to their vehicle, they should look for any signs that something has been concealed or the vehicle tampered with.\n\nThis can be included as part of the required roadworthiness ‘walk around’ check. A security checklist for drivers supports this guidance.\n\nSecuring vehicles\n\nWhenever vehicles are left unattended.\n\nFor example, at the start and end of a journey, during a comfort break or while parked as securely as possible, drivers should ensure that all the doors and windows are closed, engine switched off and ignition keys are taken with them. For vehicles not requiring ignition keys, drivers should ensure that they secure the vehicle appropriately before leaving (Annex A). Vehicles should not be left unattended with engines running.\n\nMeasures to prevent vehicles being taken by criminals or terrorists and used as a weapon include:\n\nvehicles should not be left unattended at the roadside with the engines running\n\nignition keys should not be left in the vehicle while the driver is not present\n\noperators of vehicles that require the engine running, to operate auxiliary equipment when the driver is not in the cab, should take appropriate measures to ensure against theft of the vehicle; this could include the provision of a second key to lock the cab doors\n\nalternative security measures should be considered and used for vehicles not requiring an ignition key\n\nsecurity measures should be put in place at goods vehicle operating centres or other premises to prevent unauthorised access to vehicles\n\ngoods vehicles must be parked as securely as possible\n\ndrivers and/or Goods Vehicle operators should report any concerns about unusual behaviour that occurs on or close to their vehicle\n\nVehicle security equipment\n\nSecurity features that keep the driver and vehicle safe and secure should be considered during the vehicle procurement process.\n\nIn addition to the risk of vehicles being stolen for use in terrorist attacks, the additional costs to a business caused by the theft of a vehicle and/or load can be considerable.\n\nThe decision will depend on what type of operations are being undertaken. A vehicle being used to multi-drop in a town centre might need to be fitted with an ignition immobiliser, while an international haulage operator might need to think about load space monitoring. However, the message is simple: keep the vehicle safe and secure and you reduce not only the costs to your business associated with economic crime, but you also deny a potential terrorist access to a large, heavy vehicle capable of causing great harm when driven deliberately into crowds of people.\n\nThe operator must decide what security and safety equipment is most appropriate for their vehicles, from sophisticated electronic engine immobilisers and in-cab cameras to simple steering locks: anything that deters the theft of the vehicle should be considered.\n\nWhat to do if a vehicle is taken\n\nIf your vehicle is stolen call 999 and alert the call handler to the following information:\n\ncircumstances of the vehicle being stolen.\n\ndescription of the vehicle including company name, registration details, aerial roof markings and any tracking software fitted in the vehicle.\n\nif you suspect that the vehicle has been stolen for a terrorist attack then make sure this is made clear to the call handler.\n\nDrivers should also immediately alert the company who will have procedures in place for stolen vehicles.\n\nDisposal of vehicles\n\nPrior to disposal or sale of vehicles to third parties.\n\nAll vehicles should have their entire internal and external livery and other markings removed to avoid potential use by others for malicious purposes.\n\nDfT contact details\n\nPlease contact DfT’s Land Transport Security Division for further enquiries on goods vehicle security and VAW at: landsecurity@dft.gov.uk\n\nSecurity tips for goods vehicle drivers\n\nAvoid talking about loads or routes with unauthorised persons (including over radios and telephones). Do not post information about your route or location on social media, be aware of your ‘digital footprint’, and take care to avoid unwitting disclosure of route/location through mobile phone security settings and geolocation of pictures. Discuss high risk routes with you transport office.\n\nLock and secure your vehicle whenever you leave the cab and keep the keys secure, including when unloading and loading, always follow company security policies and instructions.\n\nCarry out visual walk around checks when leaving and returning to the vehicle to make sure it has not been tampered with. Report any irregularity in loading, locking, sealing or documentation to your Company.\n\nWhen conducting walk around checks, think Security as well as Safety.\n\nNever carry goods for anyone, other than the authorised load.\n\nIf you are forced to change your route, inform your Transport Office immediately.\n\nIf someone is acting suspiciously or something ‘doesn’t feel right’ either at the depot or on the road, report it to ACT, call 0800 789 321 and contact your company.\n\nDo not allow unauthorised passengers into the cab.\n\nKeep your phone fully charged and on you at all times. Store important phone numbers.\n\nBe mindful of your personal security. Keep ID documentation and wallets secure and out of sight.\n\nBeware of attempts to deceive, such as by bogus Police and DVSA Officers - Stay vigilant always.\n\nGlossary\n\nACT: Action Counters Terrorism, a national campaign by Counter Terrorism Policing to encourage the public to act on their instincts to help tackle the terrorist threat.\n\nCab: The cab is an enclosed space in a lorry where the driver is located.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR): CSR can help an organisation to show it is socially responsible and environmentally sustainable.
