Meeting the judges criteria generally seems more important than actual originality or quality of songs. Either that or the voting is rigged. The bands and muso's that do 'make it', do so because of good songs and and hard work.\n\n-I was approached in 2006 by a a female SAMA nominated artist to help work on her songs and record all the guitar parts for her second album. She was very competent on the keys, but her songs where really lame, and her singing was bad to the point of embarrassment, I turned her down. I later learnt from the studio she recorded at that her approach was rather simple. She recorded her 'album', then took it to all the majors and harassed them multiple times a day until someone signed her, then she went to the radio stations and harassed them until they play listed it, then she went to the SAMA board and harassed them until she was nominated, which she used as leverage with her label to make a video, which I unfortunately saw late one night on SABC. She never did the second album.\n\nThe point is she took herself very seriously, and if her music had been better she would have been a huge success.\n\nAveratu\n\nKeira WitherKay wrote: So before any advice or tips can be shared or offered a few questions for you stu\n\n1.what part of the music biz do you want to enter .

If a certain percentage of songs played every hour had to be by SA artists, and not some foreigner, then the entire industry would have to pick up. It is bad news that for any SA artist to ''make it'', they have to leave the country. Money is what would have to be the key factor, but, if the industry could be grown decently, and fairly, then the government stands to score financially - this is the angle to use - but, sadly everyone that i talk to is brow beaten into believing that nothing can/will change.

Well in SA there is little industry, and what does exist is run by an elite crew of people not very concerned about music.\n\nIf you want ot submit songs to radio in SA I can help you......

Hence the local industry is under developed, and still everything local is looked down on as inferior.\n\nMIKA-the-better-one\n\nAlso consider the assumption that one needs a Record company to go forward.\n\nI find there is this assumption that a band must ......record a demo------- Pass it to a record company-------- they will then grow you into a artist---------- success!!!\n\nThis is not how bands work these days\n\nstu\n\nKeira WitherKay wrote: So before any advice or tips can be shared or offered a few questions for you stu\n\n1.what part of the music biz do you want to enter .

And if you really care about it you work around that (or with it).... everyone who starts a band deals with this.\n\nGrunge/ Post Grunge: Sadly seems to be a very VERY popular genre in SA, with 5 or 6 bands in an evening at the right venue sounding like Seether, or 3 doors down. SO if you are really commited to that way of playing then you really have to be amazing at it just to be noticed out of the crowd.\n\nFurther in Europe and USA and Japan, grunge/ post grunge is considered is a bit out of date and not to popular. Then again if you are 19 you still have plently of time to grow and get to where you need ot be to \"make it\" in music.\n\nepictring\n\nWhen I started my first band about 2 years back. It was the same story, we went through about 3 vocalists, 1 guitarist and millions of drummers and bassists who simply stops pitching for band practice and so on. It really gets you down sometime..\n\nIf you keep pushing through, I promise you, you will get more \"permanent\" members who will stay a while. But yeah, the problem will always be there, but it's certainly worth it IMO.\n\nKeira-WitherKay\n\nHi ya stu , ok you at a fabulous age . I would suggest you enrol yourself in music school at wits or some other uni offering a Bmus you young enough and what you learn is invaluable not to mention the music biz contacts you will make while studying. Take the 3 yrs to develop with the up and coming music students and when you done you will be way ahead of the game and only 22 or 23 with a solid music education and skills to match\n\nKeira-WitherKay\n\nOh and i mean this very seriously if you learn to play solo piano, you will never be unemployed musically , pianists are used in every major hotel in the world . And there's always gig for a good solo pianist even here at sun city where i do gigs there's 1 x rock band / 1 x solo sax player / 2 x solo instrumental guitarists one classical guitarist and one jazz guitarist , thats me / and wait for it no fewer than 5 x pianists on permanent staff\n\nBob-Dubery\n\nstu wrote:\n\n1. I always imagined I would play in a band rather then by myself. But people are so unreliable. Its always the same shit \"Ja, dude Ive got this thing on Saturday so....\"\n\nAnd old problem. But you're not that unreliable, and there are other folks out there who will show a similar level of dedication. You need to hook up with those people somehow. One of the ways to do this is to have a band and let the lineup change until you have a set of focussed, dedicated people.\n\nAnd get gigs! Then there's something to work towards.\n\nAlanRatcliffe\n\nKeira's advice is solid - basically if you want to be sure to enter any part of the industry and make a living doing it, then it pays to train for it. Study the path you want to take - playing, engineering, production, etc. Unlike many industries, your path doesn't have to be a formal education, but it really helps if it is, and if it's not formal then be prepared to put in twice the time to learn as much as possible anyway.\n\nThrow yourself into every project and job you can lay your hands on; take jobs you wouldn't normally consider; never stop learning; learn to recognise the people who have staying power, and don't waste time on those who don't; be professional at all times; and above all network, network, network.\n\nThe whole \"making it in the music industry\" (a.k.a. taking the \"fame & fortune\" route) is a bit of a crap shoot. While it's possible to do it this way, it's incredibly rare and success tends to be fleeting. Mostly there is a narrow window when you are the right age and your favoured style of music is popular (usually by the time you have learned to play in the specific style that influenced you to start, the popular music has already moved on). 99.9% of the folk who \"make it\" this way do not stay in the industry long, and most of those who do are usually the savvy ones who put every penny they earn from their brief success into setting themselves up properly for a long term career (recording studios, sound hire, promotion companies etc.). Anyway, the popular music industry these days is pretty much designed around everyone else making money off the artists and then disposing of them.\n\ndeebee\n\nMika, there is PLENTY of good music in SA. Just switch the radio on if you want to hear utter garbage a great deal of the time. We can compete with anyone. It just takes the belief. If the SABC is forced to play LOCAL it can only benefit the entire industry. With a vibrant industry the standards will automatically be uplifted and everyone benefits. The old record companies did set the stage for the present malaise, BUT, why can it not be changed with a multitude of voices. We have had excellent original bands since the late 60's. Hawk, Freedoms Children and later on Rabbit. They should have ''made it'' here, not have to travel overseas to get anywhere."
