We are musically superior to those who are successful pop artists (ooh! Let's debate what \"successful\" really means again!) and therefore we are comfortable in ridiculing these people whose only claim to fame is being musically appealing to the masses (who are either teeny boppers, or have zero appreciation for \"real\" music)\n\nWarren\n\nI got my five tickets online (for the kids, of course ?). Looks like I was lucky!\n\nRay\n\nWell, my chick tells me that the aunties at her spinning class are all going and asked her to pull in. Apparently they all aflutter about it. I dont know what for but there you have it. The oke is successful so good for him.\n\nsingemonkey\n\nNothing against Bieber. But ask yourself, The Bay City Rollers... where are they now? A great pop group continues its appeal as you get older. People don't mature and give up listening to the Beatles. U2 or Michael Jackson still have their appeal. But when it's just an image that appeals to people at a certain stage of life or whatever, well, I don't respect it any more than a successful craze in toys.\n\nWhat is positive for me about this is the fact that South Africa does represent a market that can make profits for the right touring musicians. Just maybe the success of these pop shows will lead to more exciting visitors.\n\nWizard\n\nMy daughter is going.\n\nShe absolutely loves him.\n\nNow here's the interesting bit.\n\nShe got to a fairly advanced level in playing piano herself.\n\nAnd she has got a deep appreciation of all sorts of other music normally regarded as \"good\".\n\nBut she's also a fun loving, party going 18 year old girl.\n\nI had never actually listened to him, so just went onto youtube to hear a few songs.\n\nHe sings in tune, has a good range and good voice control.\n\nAnd his tunes are melodic, well choreographed and well delivered.\n\nDo I like it?\n\nHell no.\n\nCouldn't make it to the end of a single video.\n\nThe way he moves makes me squirm and I think he sounds like a girl.\n\nDoes that make it bad?\n\nHell no.\n\nHere's an interesting statement: \"It must be bad music because I don't like it\"\n\nHis tickets sold out REALLY fast.\n\nAnd now there are a LOT of tickets on gumtree at inflated prices.\n\nLooks like a bit of touting going on.\n\nBob-Dubery\n\nsingemonkey wrote: Nothing against Bieber.

The Rollers got comprehensively ripped off by their management. Two of them ended up playing pub gigs in Durban. They were tied up in legal red tape for years - which often doesn't do good things for a career. Bruce Springsteen's career was nearly killed by similar goings on.\n\nIt also depends on what the appeal is built on and whether or not you know which side your bread is buttered. The Monkees effectively killed their own career when they decided that THEY wanted to write the songs and play all the instruments so that they could be proper musicians. Management let them go ahead and that was pretty much the end of that.\n\nThe jury must surely be out on Bieber? We don't know yet if he's going to transition into a more grown up kind of artist with long term appeal. He might. He's certainly lasted longer and got bigger than many people expected. I think it's hard for a teeny bop hero to make that transition, but it's not impossible.\n\nAnyway... life is simpler (not necessarily fairer, but simpler) if you accept the X-rated Bob view of the music business, namely that there is no relationship at all between talent and sales. None whatsoever. They may coincide (the Fab Four) or they miss by miles. It's long been that way and long will be. Resign yourself to the nasty truth and move on.\n\nBob-Dubery\n\nWizard wrote: I had never actually listened to him, so just went onto youtube to hear a few songs.\n\nHe sings in tune, has a good range and good voice control.\n\nAnd his tunes are melodic, well choreographed and well delivered.\n\nDude, NOBODY (except rock 'n roll dinosaurs and those doing karaoke for a dare) sings out of tune these days. It doesn't happen. They use autotune and thus their pitch is perfect.\n\nIndeed, some acts have cut right to the chase. I watched Kanye West on the 121212 concert last night and some vocal parts were very obviously canned. I mean totally obviously, nobody was even trying to hide the fact. Britney Spears lip syncs her live shows and it's believed that a lot of other people do too because the audience, who aren't paying peanuts to go to the show, expect a note perfect reproduction of the record.\n\nchris77\n\nI don't like the little munchkin a lot either. Not sure if it's jealousy because he is making money hand over fist, or genuine dislike because he is doing it by being a product designed to do exactly that by his handlers.\n\nBut aaagh well, each to his own. Me and the missus went to watch the new Twilight movie over the weekend. Now, I reckon I must have been one of about a handfull of males in the cinema and certainly the only one old enough to shave. So all goes well and the movie isn't all that bad actually - until that Jacob bloke takes of his shirt (for no reason). And undoes his belt. And drops his pants as well. Man! The cinema erupted with little girl screams of delight. And I mean it goes apesh*t. ? The young lady next to me was spewing out OMG! OMG!'s with such fervour that I genuinely feared she might faint.\n\nNow, that was just for a minute or so. I can only imagine what a full concert by Bieber might do to those girls.... So for those of you unfortunate to have to go, you have my condolences, you really do.\n\nAttila\n\nhave you guys ever run the numbers on these shows, its like long distance telephone numbers.\n\nThe thing that make me moerig, is that this laatjie has already had more crumpet than all of us put together, and that makes me very sad :'(\n\nBob-Dubery\n\nAttila wrote: have you guys ever run the numbers on these shows, its like long distance telephone numbers.\n\nThe thing that make me moerig, is that this laatjie has already had more crumpet than all of us put together, and that makes me very sad :'(\n\nHas he?

The Beatles are legends for exactly that reason, they had meaning.. They were doing what they did for a purpose other than money and fame. That came after they made such amazing music. Justin Bieber though, he was litterally moulded into what he is by Usher. Why did he put time and effort into his protege? Because he knew it would be a fruitfull investment.\n\nPlus, another thing, it's easy for people to say \"don't hate someone because you it makes you seem jealous..\" Well sorry, but all of us like or listen to BIG artists. Not everyone likes the same, but these artists all have millions of fans, then if it were jealousy, why not hate all musicians with millions of followers?"
