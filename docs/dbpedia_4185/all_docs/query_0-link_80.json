        "text": "Gail Davis Barnes is an African American pianist and piano teacher in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She is an ardent advocate of the works of composers of African descent. This has led her to make numerous lecture-recitals at schools and colleges on the piano music of Black composers. Her interest is also reflected in her CD Magnolias (53:28), containing works by the Afro-British composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912) and the African American composer R. Nathaniel Dett (1882-1943). The pianist released the CD independently in 2001; it is available from Nicola's Books in the Westgate Shopping Center in Ann Arbor.\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor is represented by pieces from Scenes From An Imaginary Ballet, Op. 74; Moorish Dance, Op. 55; The Angels Changed My Name, Op. 59, No. 9; Deep River, Op. 59, No. 10; Run Mary, Run, Op. 59, No. 21; and The Bamboula (African Dance), Op. 59, No. 8.R. Nathaniel Dett's share of the disc is Magnolia Suite, comprised of Magnolia, Deserted Cabin, My Lady Love, Mammy, and The Place Where The Rainbow Ends. Brief audio samples of the linked titles can be heard at www.AfriClassical.com\n\nExcerpts from the pianist's resume explain her educational background and professional activities:\n\n\"Gail Davis Barnes is an independent private piano teacher and performer in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she maintains a studio. She attended Ohio State University (OSU) where she received a Bachelor of Music degree in piano performance and a double minor in music history and organ. During her years at OSU, she played in many recitals both as a soloist and accompanist; she also was a featured soloist with the OSU Symphony Orchestra. Upon graduation, she attended the University of Michigan where she received a Master of Music degree in piano performance with a minor concentration in music history.\"\n\n\"Ms. Davis Barnes has participated in piano master classes with Malcolm Frager, Theodore Lettvin, Dorothy Taubman, and Ralph Votapek. She has also conducted master classes in Ohio and Michigan.\n\nShe has served as Minister of Music at Glacier Way United Methodist Church, Church of the Good Shepherd, and as a substitute organist/pianist at Calvary United Methodist Church.\n\nThe last 24 of her 34 years of piano teaching have been dominated by the Suzuki Method. Her primary Suzuki training has been at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point with Mrs. Haruko Kataoka. In addition, she has spent many hours observing other Suzuki piano and violin teachers instruct their students.\n\nOne of the high points of Ms. Davis Barnes’ teaching career was when she had the opportunity to teach general music to grades 2-8, and music appreciation to grades 10-12 to an international group of children in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia for two years, where she also did some private teaching and performing.\n\nMs. Davis Barnes’ lecture recitals concerning the classical music of Black Composers have been enthusiastically received at different universities around the country. Special presentations of these recitals have been warmly received by elementary and secondary students in Ann Arbor, Detroit, Pensacola, Florida, and Paradise Valley, Arizona.\"\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912): Afro-British Composer & Conductor\n\n24 Negro Melodies, Op. 59 is David Shaffer-Gottschalk's recent 2-disc recording of this work for solo piano, on Troy 930/31 (2007). The composer's program notes read, in part:\n\n“What Brahms has done for the Hungarian folk music, Dvorak for the Bohemian, and Grieg for the Norwegian, I have tried to do for these Negro Melodies. The plan adopted has been almost without exception that of the Tema con Variazioni.”\n\nThe CD has been reviewed at Black Grooves, an online publication of the Archives of African American Music and Culture at Indiana University. The Coleridge Ensemble has recorded Five Negro Melodies for Piano Trio, Op. 59, No. 1 on Samuel Coleridge-Taylor: Chamber Music, AFKA SK-543 (1998). Sometimes I feel like a motherless child (4:55) can be heard in its entirety on the Audio page at www.AfriClassical.com\n\nHis biographer, Geoffrey Self has, has called him The Hiawatha Man, but in addition to his interest in Native American legend, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was also an important Pan-Africanist. Very early on, he began collaborating with the African American poet and author Paul Lawrence Dunbar (1872-1906). Writing in Africana Encyclopedia, Roanne Edwards says:\n\n“He was also a leading exponent of Pan-Africanism, which emphasized the importance of a shared African heritage as the touchstone of black cultural identity.”\n\nAn entry on Pan-Africanism in Encyclopedia Africana includes a photo, with this caption:\n\n“The first Pan-African Conference convened in London in July 1900. W.E.B. Du Bois, who stands in the center of this photograph of the conference delegates, gave the keynote address titled 'To the Nations of the World'.”\n\nJeffrey Green has published an article in Black Music Research Journal, Vol. 10, No. 2, entitled \"The Foremost Musician of His Race: Samuel Coleridge-Taylor of England, 1875-1912\". He reports:\n\n“Coleridge-Taylor's black associates were fine people, as we can see from his contacts in London in July 1900 when Du Bois and the Loudins participated in a Pan-African conference at which Coleridge-Taylor was present (Mathurin 1976, 67, 168).” Frederick J. Loudin was a bass singer from Ohio who led the famous Fisk Singers, Green notes.\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor was born on August 15, 1875 in Croydon, a suburb of London, England. His mother was an English woman named Alice Hare. His father was Daniel Peter Taylor, a native of Sierra Leone who trained as a physician at King's College, London. After graduating he found his race was a barrier to maintaining a medical practice in the United Kingdom. As a result he returned to Africa permanently around the time of Samuel's birth. He is not known to have had any contact with his son.\n\nYoung Samuel was raised by his English mother and stepfather, but his musical education was overseen by Col. Herbert A. Walters, who belonged to the church choir in which the boy sang. Samuel also studied violin with a local musician as a child. He enrolled at the Royal college of Music in 1890 as a student of Violin.\n\nTwo years later he switched to composition and was taught by Charles Villiers Stanford. Coleridge-Taylor wrote his Symphony in A Minor in 1896, we are told by Lewis Foreman in the liner notes of the world premiere recording, Classico 684 (2006). Critic Jonathon Woolf of Music Web International writes of the work: “His characteristic gift for melodic beauty is always present.”\n\nColeridge-Taylor rose to prominence in 1898, the year he turned 23, on the strength of two works. The first was his Ballade in A Minor. It was commissioned for the prestigious annual Three Choirs Festival at the suggestion of the British composer Edward Elgar (1857-1934). The piece was a critical and popular success.\n\nThe composer's second major composition of 1898 was his musical Hiawatha's Wedding Feast, for which he is best known. The work is a setting of verses from Song of Hiawatha by the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He conducted its premier to great acclaim. It was staged hundreds of times in the United Kingdom alone during the next 15 years.\n\nSamuel married Jessie Walmisley, a pianist and classmate, on Dec. 30, 1899. The publicity surrounding Hiawatha's Wedding Feast created a huge demand for tours both within the United Kingdom and abroad. Among the most important for the composer's career were three tours of North America in 1904, 1906 and 1910.\n\nThe first concert of the 1904 tour was in Washington, D.C. The Coleridge-Taylor Society, an African American choir, appeared with the United States Marine Band, with the composer at the podium. During his stay in the capital Coleridge-Taylor visited President Theodore Roosevelt at the White House.\n\nJeffrey Green describes the 1906 tour in his article:\n\n“In the 1906 tour the Briton presented the Atonement, the Quadroon Girl, and Hiawatha; he also toured with Burleigh. He appeared in Toronto, St. Louis, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee, as well as the cities of Boston, Washington and Chicago, which had also been on his first tour schedule.”\n\nThe 1910 tour took Coleridge-Taylor to Boston, Detroit, and Norfolk, Connecticut, where he was guest conductor for the Litchfield County Choral Union Festival, Green tells us.\n\nAmerican Virtuosa: Tribute to Maud Powell, Cedille CDR 90000 097 (2007), is a new CD featuring Rachel Barton Pine, violin, and Matthew Hagle, piano. Among the works is Coleridge-Taylor's Deep River, Op. 59, No. 10 (4:46). Rachel Barton and the Encore Chamber Orchestra, led by Daniel Hege, conductor, made the world premiere recording of the composer's Romance in G Major for Violin and Orchestra (12:33) on the CD Violin Concertos by Black Composers of the 18th and 19th Centuries, Cedille CDR 90000 035 (1997).\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is the conclusion of a four-part review by Dr. Dominique-René de Lerma, an oboist and musicologist who is Professor of Music at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin and has specialized in Black classical music for four decades. The review of the series of four CDs appears in the August 2007 eNewsletter of the Myrtle Hart Society and is used by permission of its Founder/Director, Rashida Black, who is also a harpist.\n\nWitness, the soul of American musicBy Dominique-René de Lerma; Part 4 of 4\n\nDance like the wind; Music of today's Black composersVocalEssence Ensemble; Philip Brunelle, conductor; liner notes by Dominique-René de Lerma; texts; series note; performer bios.\n\nBaker, David.

(4:54).\n\nIf we wonder who is Michael Abels for want of a richer discography, that question may also be raised in the case of David Baker, although his very extensive recorded oeuvre is no excuse. Is there any composer who is so comfortably all over the place? A violin concerto for Josef Gingold with jazz band, a cello sonata for Janos Starker, 12-tone jazz, song cycles, cantatas, liturgical jazz, jivey pieces for string ensemble… is the whole world of music his?\n\nClearly a most important figure of his generation, Banfield takes films seriously, and his offering here is in direct response to Cat on a hot tin roof, for woodwind quintet.\n\nThe senior figure here is Undine Smith Moore, whose career as a major music educator was dedicated to Virginia State University. In the final decades of her life, her choral works began to receive substantial attention.\n\nNo longer with us is another giant in Perkinson, composer for films, orchestra and chamber groups, and a conductor of real substance. His contribution here provides an opportunity to hear the work of Anthony Elliott, whose tenure at the University of Michigan followed years of substantial experience as principal cellist with major orchestras in the US and Canada.\n\nThe Simpson dynasty flourished from Temple Evangelical Church in Philadelphia – first in the person of Joy Simpson, whose death while protesting apartheid in South Africa deprived us of a voice, equally comfortable with opera as with gospel music. Her career lasted long enough to be joined with Marietta, a mezzo-soprano whose career evolved in international importance. The third member of the family is a most remarkable musician whose imaginative settings of spirituals are unquestionably first-rate.\n\nThis set of four CDs belongs readily in any university or public library. It illustrates, not only a chunk of African American legacy, but demonstrates the enviable musical forces available within Minnesota's Twin Cities. The conductor, who as musicologist is acutely aware of the monuments of the history he is tracing here, and he has at his command an exemplary assemblage of splendid choristers and instrumentalists. With these recordings, all of this can be shared with a large and appreciative audience.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDr. Dominique-René de Lerma is an oboist and musicologist who has been a Professor of Music and a prolific author for more than half a century.

If so, then in a parallel situation, a Black singer should avoid German Lieder and Italian opera, but what a loss it would be had Leontyne Price or Jessye Norman followed that restriction! Of course, these ladies had to deal with diction in the foreign language, but that is an obligation every singer must face. It is not a linguistic barrier facing the non-Black singer when the repertoire is enriched, it is political. Jessye Norman's French is so flawless that she was called on to participate in the 200th anniversary of the French revolution, and no protest was registered to my knowledge from France, which has a very strong protectionist policy about its culture.\n\nBrunelle's singers face the dialect straight on, and replicate the sonority of a fine Black college chorus. So also do the singers from St. Olaf, guided by Dr. Anton Armstrong.\n\nThe question arises about the setting of a traditional spiritual by one who is not Black, and that is exemplified in a few instances with this recording, but a critical listener would be no more able to identify those composers than one can signal the gender of a composer by the sound of the music.\n\nOf course, we are blessed by the masterful settings of such classic figures as Burleigh (his My Lord might well be the most marvelously performed work here), Hairston, and the more recent figures such as Thomas, Dennard, Hailstork, and Harris. The gospel element enters with the performances of Moore by Four, a well-established ensemble, although some might feel this idiom is in strange company here.\n\nBach's Sheep may safely graze is merged with Jesus, love of my soul, a gospel synthesis so often beautifully performed in recital by the late Pearl Williams-Jones.\n\nBut who is Michael Abels? We first encountered his work in Detroit some years back, when Global warming heralded the emergence of a quite gifted young man. We do not even yet have a proper perspective on his output, where are found pieces for children performers and now he appears in gospel guise. One yearns to have him better represented on recordings.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDr. Dominique-René de Lerma is an oboist and musicologist who has been a Professor of Music and a prolific author for more than half a century.

Further, one immediately can claim his Afro-American symphony of 1930 as being the culmination of the aspirations of the Harlem Renaissance \"elevating\" the folkloric to the idealization of the concert world (this, despite the rise of Duke Ellington and Bessie Smith by that time). Still grew up in the legacy of the blues and jazz, never disdaining either, but reaching for the world of the symphony and opera. His passion for the latter genre was frustrated in what should have been a major breakthrough.\n\nTroubled island received its première and only production during his life by the New York City Opera. Its fate was determined after only three performances in 1949 by a cabal of racist critics, defying the audience enthusiasm and twenty-two curtain calls (The story is told in the richly documented Just tell the story; Troubled island by Judith Anne Still and Lisa M. Headlee – Flagstaff: The Master-Player Library, 2006).\n\nThe works heard on this CD, several for the very first time) come both before and after that unfortunate event. First is his choral setting of Stephen Foster's Swanee river.\n\nThe poignant cantata, And they lynched him on a tree, was written in 1940 to a text by Catherine Garrison Chapin. For this performance, Brunelle has called on the stellar forces of Hilda Harris, the late William Warfield, with the African American chorus, Robert L. Morris' Leigh Morris Chorale providing a sympathetic counterpart to the singers of VocalEssence.\n\nMiss Sally's party is a ballet, the scenario provided by the composer's multi-gifted wife and frequent collaborator, Verna Arvey. It centers around mischievous boys who misbehave, failing to win the concluding cakewalk.\n\nThe last two works are performed by the conductor, now as organist. The pair come from 1961 and 1963, and could well serve as meditative occasional pieces.\n\nOne feature that is included on all of these recordings is the specification of publishers (many of the Still works are available from William Grant Still Music in Flagstaff, operated by the composer's daughter, who has a virtual archive of no end of materials related to all aspects of her father's life and works – jazz arrangements and recordings from the 1920s as well as film scores from the early days of sound movies, when Still's distinctive orchestral sonorities established the Klangideal even for Russian films of the time).\n\nFrench Jr. High Principal On Cover Art of Calliope 9373\n\nDear Mr. Zick,\n\nI have regularly visited AfriClassical with interest and admiration. I am myself passionately interested in the Chevalier de Saint-Georges and therefore the questions raised by the cover of the Calliope CD retained my attention. That’s why I feel a need to express my point of view.\n\nAs the Principal of a junior high school near Vichy, France, I staged a theatre show on the life and music of Saint-Georges this year with the collaboration of several primary and secondary schools, music schools and a fencing school. This show was exclusively interpreted by 14 year old students. The progam included a theatre performance, music, singing, dancing and fencing.\n\nSaint-Georges was first introduced to our children through Saint-Georges raconté aux enfants (Saint-Georges told to children), J.C. Halley’s book, and then we adapted Le Divin Saint-Georges, Daniel Marciano’s play. Most of our students, not particularly inclined to 18th century music, often due to an unfavorable family environment for symphonic music, worked on the show during the whole academic year. It was a hard job and they were at times discouraged.\n\nHowever, when they started rehearsing with costumes - perfect replicas of the period - things changed. A surprising phenomenon of identification took place: the children became Saint-Georges, Nanon, Georges de Bologne, Texier La Boëssière, d’Eon etc. The fencers tried extra hard to cross blades with style and even their attitudes were those of another century; the singers interpreted Saint-Georges’s Romances with greater conviction and the actresses and actors became different people when playing their roles.\n\nWhen they were not rehearsing, we happened to hear lines of the play or see attempts at fencing bouts in the school yard !\n\nIt was simply due to the magic of costumes, authentic gestures and attitudes, the tone and the language of the period.\n\nWe are aware of teenagers’ reactions. It is part of our job. They did appreciate performing in the historical context.\n\nOn stage, they managed wonderfully to share with the audience all the emotions they felt when discovering the thrilling life of the Chevalier de Saint-Georges: in turn affection, indignation, anger, humor, love, laughter and in fine the dramatic impact of the subject. Through Saint-Georges, the ultimate objective was to speak of the human drama of slavery.\n\nThe final scene of the show was a moment of anthology. A beautiful voice off stage summed up the life of Saint-Georges to the strains of the sublime Adagio of Saint-Georges, so dear to Dominique-René de Lerma.\n\nWe often hear that Saint-Georges’ music is reserved for informed musicians and in that respect, Les Archets de Paris serve the cause of music. However, their praiseworthy contribution should not prevent others from being genuinely interested in Saint-Georges’ music. (I personally discovered this music almost 40 years ago.) Our show presented the Vichy audience all the aspects of Joseph Bologne’s works: the magnificent overture of L’Amant Anonyme which kept coming back as a leitmotiv, excerpts of concertos, quartets and a selection of Saint-Georges’ Romances sung by two children’s choirs. Interpreting this great musician was a challenge and a source of enjoyment for these youngsters.\n\nHowever the highlight of the show was the participation of a group of children who came to Vichy with the Mayor of the birthplace of Saint-Georges in Guadeloupe. The encounter of these two worlds was a great event for both the children of Saint-Yorre and Baillif. In this instance, we may talk about the shock of cultures but also about a spontaneous current of sympathy which was established between the children in the presence of the parents who all wanted to take home one of the Baillif children.\n\nBefore ending this comment - I hope to have shown my respect for Saint-Georges - I would like to express my deep indignation on hearing unfair accusations against L’Association des Amis de Joseph Bologne. During this hard and ambitious academic year they were constantly by our side to advise us, to bring support and encouragement. We could not have achieved our goal without their generosity and their friendship. I am much indebted to Jean-Claude Halley and Daniel Marciano. The values they defend are just the opposite of the venal conceptions of others who have the pretension of being the ones who discovered Saint-Georges but make blatant mistakes on purpose in order that Saint-Georges may fit into the mold of their conceptions.\n\nI find the cover of the CD utterly distasteful. It is, on the one hand, ambiguous and scornful (even racist), and on the other hand, vulgarity is not likely to attract the curiosity of children. They are far more discriminating than one may think!\n\nTo add a few more words about our show which was a success – at a secondary school level of course – we are proud of the participation of 150 children, 30 musicians, 20 fencers and 70 young choristers.\n\nOver 1000 spectators of the region of Vichy attended the show and I think I can say that it was an opportunity to introduce Saint-Georges’ music to the whole region.\n\nRFO was present to cover the event. Their comment may be found on Guadeloupe Attitude, Gens de la Caraïbe, You Tube etc.\n\nWe were obviously too modest. We did not perform on the premises of The Senate but hundreds of children and spectators in a little corner of France, far from Paris, discovered an exceptional character, a sensitive and virtuoso musician, a talented fencer, and above all a man whose life remains an example for our youth.\n\nWith all my admiration for your work and beautiful website.\n\nCatherine Pizon\n\nPrincipale du collège Victor Hugo"
