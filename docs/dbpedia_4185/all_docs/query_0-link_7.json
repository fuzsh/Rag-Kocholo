Anthony Gonzales - Director\n\nMax Wilson - Camera Op\n\n[SIZE=-1]Justin R. Durban - Music[/SIZE]\n\nProduction Notes:\n\nAug. 19\n\nI've been working on some shot setups. The nice thing about having a camera is you can do a lot of pre-visualization in your own apartment.\n\nI have a basic shot setup for the shower scene... :beer: And no, it's not a shower scene in the typical sense. It's \"dark.\" And no, not \"dark\" in the typical sense either... I guess you'd have to see it to know what I'm talking about... :beer:\n\nAug 24\n\nHave the basic story laid out. Had lunch with one of Hollywood's heavy hitters. We banged out the story line and I've managed to talk him into directing this thing. Things are looking good...\n\nI was considering not entering my own project, but the more I thought about an idea, them more it started to develop. Now I have 2 main characters and the first few lines of dialog, but it's a start. I need to find a writer. I'm not that good at developing stories - I'm better with developing characters.\n\nBut you should join. I enjoyed Frozen River. You gave a very good performance in that.\n\nI was considering not entering my own project, but the more I thought about an idea, them more it started to develop.

I hope... :beer:\n\nSteve_Arm said:\n\nWill you be playing the guitar on the film?\n\nNah... I very well might grab my guitar and play something for the soundtrack though...\n\nYou going to enter, Steve? You should.\n\nI've cajoled John (cinealma) into helping me with the story line... and it's gonna be a good one... I hope... :beer:\n\nWho, what, huh? :undecided\n\nHey, wait a minute.
