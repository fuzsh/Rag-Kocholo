        "text": "I’m lucky aren’t I getting to be on radio with all these cute young Scandanavian girls!? But, would you like to know what was the best thing about last Sunday’s Chanters Lodge Experience with the Milli Jam Ingredient featuring George da Soulchild, our regular Sunday night radio show which I co-host with these two great DJ’s? Well, apart from our two delightful Guests pictured above, Sandra and Charlotte from Sweden, it was the fact that after several months the lift was working to the studios located on the 6th floor of Livingstone’s tallest building. Funny though, I think I rather missed the climb! Or did!??!\n\nOn with the show! As mentioned our guests were Sandra and Charlotte, two students from Lund University in Sweden in their 3rd year of a degree course in social studies. They were taking a week off, staying at Chanters Lodge, having spent seven weeks in Chingola on the Copperbelt assessing the implementation of the UN Charter for Human Rights for Children. They had been interviewing grade 11 and 12 children and on the whole found that their rights were well looked after in Zambia. The girls talked of the rights to protection and participation amongst the 64 or so human rights for children mentioned in the charter. Awesome stuff!\n\nSandra and Charlotte told listeners they’d undertaken several activities since they’d been in Livingstone and raved about their breakfast visit to Livingstone Island, where they’d swum in Devil’s Pool and dangled over the edge of Victoria Falls. “Weren’t you scared”? We wanted to know. Terrified! They agreed, but they’d loved it! They’d also been to the new Arts Cafe in Livingstone where they’d watched dancing from around Zambia and had been roped into drumming and dancing themselves too! This wasn’t the only dancing they’d done since coming to town – on Friday night they’d hit the clubs and had a great time, they said! During their last few days of their visit they were toying with the idea of bungee jumping and/or a game drive – as you do!\n\nThe music was good as usual. ‘Christmas Lights’ by Coldplay was topical, and we dropped it back to back with ‘Love Letter’ by R Kelly. George featured his own music with two tracks by Kafuela ‘Your Smile’ and ‘Sky Is The Limit’. Great stuff George we all agreed! Milli Jam featured Justin Bieber’s ‘Latin Girl’ and the heavily censored ‘Run Away’ from the new Kanye West album. Rihanna’s ‘Man Down’ made our Swedish guests sit up and take notice and coupled with ‘Count On Me’ by Bruno Mars these were two of my ‘tracks of the moment’.\n\nDid the girls have boyfriends back in Sweden? The guys wanted to know. Hesitation…..’not really’ seemed to be the answer. I, for one, didn’t believe that, or perhaps Swedish blokes are really slow! Ambitions? Sandra would like to work for an international outfit such as Save The Children, Charlotte seemed more interested in family therapy as a future career. Where would the girls like to be and what would they like to be doing 10 years from now? Married with loads of children they agreed!\n\nWhat sports were the girls interested in? Dancing!\n\nAs usual we gave chart news, including the current top three singles in Sweden – all unpronouncable, as well as the top three in UK and USA. We greeted guests and staff alike and gave away our usual dinner for 2 to the first person to tell us where these lovely girls came from. Sweden of course was the sharp answer from Mohammed, who told us their names and what they were doing here too! Some people really want to come for dinner at Chanters Lodge!!\n\nGeorge Da Soulchild, co-host of our remarkably successful radio programme The Chanters Lodge Experience with The Milli Jam Ingredient featuring George Da Soulchild (pictured above), writes a blog for us every week about the local music scene. Our radio show goes out for an hour every Sunday night at 20.30 hrs on Zambezi Radio 107.7 fm and features latest music worldwide, and chat. Guests are usually international and often resident at Chanters Lodge. Here’s George’s latest piece about Danny and Taonga.\n\nUp And Coming Gospel Artist Taonga Gets Double ‘Born & Bred’ Nomination.\n\nBeing nominated for the Born & Bred music and video awards may be considered a great achievement for any young artist seeking recognition on the Zambian music scene. 21-year-old Taonga Nyirongo has been nominated not for one, but two awards this year. Firstly in the Best Gospel Video category for his song Chikondi which is popular on ZNBC TV2.\n\nTaonga’s second nomination is for Best Promising Artist category, something which he says is an achievement knowing the fact that he is yet to succeed in the music industry. Taonga who also presents gospel show on Muvi TV says the music indutry is on the raise and the Goverment and the business society should invest as it does in other countries to ensure the growth of the Industry. Other nominees for Born and Bred include JK, Slap D, Alfa Romeo, Roberto, Brothahood Crew, Judy and Petersen just to mention a few.\n\nBorn n Bred Awards are set for the 16 of this month and will be aired live on Both ZNBC and ZNBC TV2 @20:30.\n\nDanny Takes Album Launch To RSA\n\nDanny Siulapwa aka Danny Kaya is set to take his ‘Live’ album launch to South Africa under the the auspices of DJ Tabs Entertainment. Danny,said his decision to go to South Africa for a show on December 15 was due to popular demand. So if you’re in South Africa on the 15th December, just make sure you attend the show.\n\nAnd for that matter, if you’re in Livingstone on Sunday evening, make sure you don’t miss the Chanters Lodge Experience on 107.7 fm at 20.30 hours – you might even win a dinner for 2 at the fantastic Chanters Lodge!\n\nOur Guests on the latest edition of The Chanters Lodge Experience with The Milli Jam Ingredient, featuring George Da Soulchild, were Isaac Mwanza (left) and Mubiana Jeff Nalwendo pictured above. Isaac is IT Manager at Zambezi Radio 107.7 fm and Mubiana is Production and Programmes Manager. Bit incestuous you’re thinking, considering our regular Sunday night radio show goes out on their station? Maybe, but they guys were there for a purpose.\n\nAs well as being part of the management of the station both gentlemen are very popular local DJ’s! Isaac goes on air as DJ Chin Cavaly 2010 and Jeff is MJ Fabulous! This Saturday 4th December the guys are organizing a show in Livingstone for upcoming musicians where the young and talented can display their music to the fans. (This stirred memories for me as we used to do the same sort of thing at Southern Sun Ridgeway Hotel on Folk Night, every Tuesday. A lot of older musicians in Zambia got their break on that show.) “Who’s starring for you”? I asked. “Locally it’s Kaufela” they replied, “but we’re bringing in BFlow from Lusaka, because we feel the fans should get value for the K15,000 per ticket they’ll be paying”. “Tell me about Kaufela” I continued. “George can tell you more” Isaac said. “It’s me” said George. “Yes” I said “you’re going to tell us about him”. “It’s me”! George said again, “I’m Kaufela”. Well, blow me down! I’d realised George was also a musician, but had no idea he was so well known on the local scene! MJ and Chin took the chance to thank all the many local companies that were helping to sponsor the show, including Chanters Lodge. The final line up of musicians had yet to be confirmed but it was announced that Milli Jam would be MC for the show!\n\nMilli Jam wanted to know how Isaac and Mubiana had come up with their show business names. Isaac was reticent but said he changed his name every year and it was nothing to worry about. Mubiana said that at his father’s suggestion he had had used his initials, and it was the fans early on in his career at UNZAfm who’d added ‘Fabulous’. Mubiana is a graduate in Mass Communications from the University of Zambia and Isaac is expecting admission into the Copperbelt University next year to read computer studies. He’s already an expert in this field. MJ is famous for playing new numbers, Chin for hip-hop and r&b plus his chart knowledge which is legendary.\n\nThe music on the show was good but somehow drowned out by the noise! When DJ’s get together – and there were 5 in the studio including Tendai With An ‘i’ but not including me – they talk a lot. Anyway we played ‘Girls Fall Like Dominoes’ by Nicki Minaj, back to back with ‘So Alive’ by Skepta ft NDubz. Kaufela’s selection was ‘Hands Across The World’ by ONE8 the smash hit combination of R Kelly and loads of African artists including JK, a Zambian star. George coupled it with ‘Nibandani Ba Nzako’ from the new as yet unreleased K’Millian album. ‘Where are your friends when you need them’ was the translation. Milli Jam featured Rick Ross with ‘Aston Martin Music’.\n\nIsaac and Mubiana briefed listeners about their roles at Zambezi fm as well as plans for the station’s new website and we gave away the usual dinner for 2 – won on this occasion by the manager of a rival local radio station! It was a good and informative show.\n\nGeorge Da Soulchild, co-host and technical expert on The Chanters Lodge Experience, our regular Sunday night radio show on 107.7 fm in Livingstone, updates us on the latest news from the local music scene.\n\nSakala Brothers Still Going Strong\n\nThe Sakala Brothers (pictured above) have been invited to perform at an international music festival in Poland. In a statement released to the press, Moses Sakala mentioned that the duo and their band were invited by the European Centre for Music Festival, to be held in the Polish city of Lodz. He said the festival would run for two weeks.\n\n“This is a great honour for Zambia. We’ve been rehearsing at our Sakala Brothers Arts Centre at the Lusaka Playhouse, and we appeal for prayers from the people of Zambia as we undertake another mission as cultural ambassadors from our beloved Zambia”. Moses, whose band gets a second invitation to Poland this year, said.\n\n“In May, we delivered an award-winning performance at the Sacred Music Festival Gaude Mater in Czestochowa in Poland. The award recognised the Sakala Brothers as one of the top performers during the last 20 years of this festival,” he said. The team travelling to Europe also includes Baron Besa (guitar), Sam Zulu (drums) from the Airpower Band, Lawrence Banda (keyboards) and Samson Mwiche Silwimba (bass guitar).\n\nPetersen Demands K350m From Zain\n\nZambian singer/ragga artist Petersen has demanded ZK350 million in damages from mobile service provider Zain (now Airtel) for the alleged illegal download of his song ‘Stoga’. According to a letter addressed to Airtel management, the K350 million should be paid within seven days, failure to which legal action would be instituted. Zambia Association of Musicians legal advisor Tresford Chali stated that the action by Zain to make the song available on their network without approval is contrary to the Copyright and Performance Act Chapter 06 of the Laws of Zambia and is therefore breaking the law.\n\nMukubesa Mundia aka Petersen also stated that once legal actions commenced, he would seek a court injunction restraining Zain from making the song available for its clients to download. ‘Stogas’ is Petersen’s latest satirical offering, receiving mixed reviews from local music enthusiasts.\n\n“We’ve never done it before and we’re very nervous” said Elisabeth (left) and Xenia pictured above, as we headed towards our Sunday night assignation in my car. “Don’t worry, it’s fun and very nice” I replied “just sit back and enjoy it”. Thinking something different? Tut tut! Actually, we were heading towards the studios of Zambezi Radio 107.7 fm in Livingstone, Zambia, for the latest edition of The Chanters Lodge Experience with the Milli Jam Ingredient featuring George Da Soulchild, as the girls were guesting for us on the show! Elisabeth and Xenia are part of a team of 5 Norwegian 3rd year Tromso University students staying at Chanters Lodge, while they teach pre-school children for a month at Rainbow School in Livingstone, as part of their university course. Our radio show goes out live every Sunday evening between 20.30 and 21.30 hrs, and features music and chat.\n\n“Do you have boyfriends back in Norway”? Milli Jam asked the girls. “What boyfriends”? This made George on technical pay attention and he played ‘Chipyango’ by Dalisoul. The girls were rocking. “They seem to like that number”. I remarked. “I know they do!” Replied George, laughing. “Have you been clubbing every weekend while you’ve been in Livingstone”? Milli Jam enquired. “Oh yes”! Elisabeth and Xenia replied, also laughing, and I knew instantly how George Da Soulchild knew the girls liked Dalisoul!! “What’s the track about”? I wanted to know. “He’s telling girls not to allow themselves to be treated like a local broom – used once, then ditched”. Was the succinct reply. I speculated that the Chanters Girls would have been dancing to that track back at the lodge too, and I think I was right! The other Zambian number we played on the show was a coup – UZ47 with ‘Killa Love’ – first ever airing of the track on radio anywhere in Zambia! Well done George! Our expert on the local music scene.\n\nWe played ‘Gone’ by Nelly and Kelly, as well as ‘Shine A Light’ – McFly ft Taio Cruz. Milli Jam selected an old favourite Chaka Khan – ‘Ain’t Nobody’ and Dr Dre’s latest – ‘Kush’ – that was a nice one! ‘Like A G6’ – Far East Movement and ‘The Flood’ by Take That proved we’re right up to date on the Chanters Lodge Experience!\n\n“What activities have you done since you’ve been in Livingstone”? Milli Jam asked our Guests, “apart from clubbing”? The girls told listeners they’d been to Chobe National Park in Botswana for a 2 day 1 night safari the first weekend they’d been in Zambia, and had really enjoyed the trip despite the scary insects! That afternoon they’d had high tea on Livingstone Island and swum in Devil’s Pool. They’d loved it! One of the girls had also flown in a microlight over Victoria Falls on the ‘Flight Of Angels’ and one intended to go Bungee Jumping. “It’s all scary” they commented, laughing at the same time.\n\nThe girls explained to listeners that they’d known each other since they were in high school, aged 15 or so, and that they shared a house in Tromso while they were studying, although they were both originally from Oslo. Neither of them had been to Africa before but they’d both travelled widely through Europe. The future immediately after leaving University? They weren’t sure. Longer term? Marriage and children seemed to be on both their agendas. “Better start looking for boyfriends soon then” I remarked, to in-studio laughter.\n\nWe gave away our usual dinner for two to the first person to text us the name of the country the girls hailed from and there was a huge response. ‘Nowe’ was one of them! Great that so many people were listening to the show! George, a Liverpool supporter, wanted to talk about football in general and Arsenal in particular, but Milli Jam and I did not!\n\nA good time was had by all, and of course there had been no need for the girls to be nervous!\n\nThanks to Derek for this one! There’s a photo of him swatting up on the rules at Chanters Lodge! Congratulations Derek too on the birth of your newest grandchild Kacey May!\n\n“Man Rules – At last a guy has taken the time to write this all down\n\nThese are our rules! Please note, these are all numbered ‘1’ ON PURPOSE!\n\n1. Men are NOT mind readers.\n\n1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You’re a big girl. If it’s up, put it down.\n\nWe need it up, you need it down.\n\nYou don’t hear us complaining about you leaving it down.\n\n1. Crying is blackmail.\n\n1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!\n\n1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question..\n\n1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That’s what we do.\n\nSympathy is what your girlfriends are for.\n\n1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 Days.\n\n1. If you already think you’re fat, then don’t ask us.\n\n1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one\n\n1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.\n\n1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.\n\n1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.\n\n1. All men see in only 16 colours, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a colour. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.\n\n1. If we ask what is wrong and you say ‘nothing,’ We will act like nothing’s wrong.\n\nWe know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.\n\n1. If you ask a question you don’t want an answer to, expect an answer you don’t want to hear.\n\n1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine… Really.\n\n1. Don’t ask us what we’re thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as football, rugby, cricket or motor sports – and even wood carving.\n\n1. You have enough clothes.\n\n1. You have too many shoes.\n\n1. I am in shape. Round IS a shape!\n\n1. Thank you for reading this.\n\nYes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight…\n\nBut did you know men really don’t mind that? It’s like camping.\n\nPass this to as many men as you can – to give them a laugh.\n\nPass this to as many women as you can – to give them a bigger laugh.”\n\nGeorge Da Soulchild co-hosts our regular Sunday night radio show – The Chanters Lodge Experience with the Milli Jam Ingredient featuring George Da Soulchild – broadcast live on 107.7 fm Zambezi Radio from 20.30-21.30 hrs. George guest writes for the blog about the local Zambian music scene, and here’s this week’s news, following his interview with latest Zambian singing sensation Paul Da’Prince:\n\nZambia’s latest addition to the music scene, 18 year old RnB singer Paul Munanjala (pictured above) – popularly known as Da’Prince – is releasing his first album in December, hopefully on his birthday, when he turns 19. He said his album will be called ‘No One’ and that it will feature 12 tracks. Some of the songs on the album are the title track ‘No One’ as well as ‘Zambian Girls’ and ‘She’s My Lady’ which are already being played on most Zambian Radio Stations – and making airwaves! Paul explained that ‘No One’ is all about assuring a woman that she’s the only girl in a guy’s life and asks if she considers the guy as the only one in hers!\n\nOn his album he features Slap Dee, B-Flow, Miller, Tsoya and his Producer Daxon who is also his vocal coach. Paul’s with the K-Amy label to whom he was introduced by Kalumba Chikonde, popularly known as K-Smash – a Muvi TV presenter. Paul said he’s also been inspired to sing RnB by singers such as Usher and Chris Brown and on the local scene, Exile. He also said he’d love to do a collaboration with international singer Usher Raymond one day.\n\nPaul is not only an RnB singer but also works as a presenter on Muvi TV one of Zambia’s TV stations. He presents Zed News and The Michael Jackson Dance Show. He said his family supports his career 100%. He’s also currently studying Hardware And Network Engineering at New Horizons College. He first explored his music career on Muvi TV’s popular Show ‘Teen Star’ in 2007 and came out second place in the competition.\n\nJK chillin’ with R Kelly\n\nZambia’s own superstar Jordan Katembula (JK) is in Chicago, USA, with the other members of the Pan-African super group ONE8 apparently set to revolutionise music in Africa. The One8 project is a coming together of some of Africa’s best musical talent. JK is one of the artistes chosen for the super group along with Nigeria’s talented 2Face Idibia, Ugandan hip hop artist Navio, Amani of Kenya, Tanzanian heartthrob Alikiba, Ghanaian trio 4×4, Gabonese duo Movaizhaleine and DRC’s hot sensation Fally Ipupa.\n\nRockstar4000 and Sony Music Worldwide have announced the last signing to the ONE8 music super group international mega-star R. Kelly, and the release of the group’s first single – ending weeks of anticipation across the globe. The ONE8 artists have been amped up, living the high life in Chicago and most importantly recording what will no doubt be one of the world’s hottest singles this holiday season.\n\n‘Hands Across the World’ will soon be released to radio stations and clubs across Africa and worldwide. ONE8 will release not only the hottest single of the year, but also a full album and DVD later. This long-term project was kicked into high gear when the artists flew into Chicago late last month to record ‘Hands Across the World’ with R. Kelly and his world class production team. The group also recorded a video and documentary to be released shortly."
