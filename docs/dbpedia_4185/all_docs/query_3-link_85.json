        "text": "The acoustic guitar and its predecessors in the Baroque and Classical period have proven a popular instrument for performance, composition and general entertainment and for many centuries hence. The popularity has increased exponentially in popular culture since then introduction of the guitar in Blues Music of Deep South America in the beginning of the twentieth-century and furthered through the 1950’s Rock and Roll movement and is now often viewed as a synonym of Popular music. However, as will be demonstrated it is not merely an instrument for accompaniment or purely jovial entertainment: a wide range of Western art music composers and composer-guitarists have paved the way for a whole new range of performance techniques for the instrument.\n\nThis is the first comprehensive investigation of music for, or including, the classical guitar by South African composers. The focus of this research has been, firstly, to uncover as much of the repertoire as possible, and, secondly, to collate, study, catalogue and report on the information. A brief historical survey of the guitar in South Africa provides the context within which this study was conducted. The primary sources of quantitative data collection were through the archival catalogues of the South African Music Rights Organisation and through personal contact with guitarists, composers and guitar teachers. Other sources consulted were publishers, broadcasting corporations, recording companies, libraries and the internet. The body of the dissertation (attached separately) comprises biographical sketches, background notes, analyses and technical notes on 17 selected solo and chamber works dating from 1947 to 2007 by some of South Africa’s most prominent composers and guitarist composers. The repertoire ranges in style from the traditional and ethnically inspired to the experimental and abstract. As this is an empirical survey, each selected entry includes details on instrumentation, duration, level of difficulty, number of pages, scordatura, commissions or requests, sources or publishers, premières and recordings. A biography of each composer is provided as well as background notes which offer an overview of the selected work. The notes discuss historical, cultural, musical and extra-musical influences, and frequently include references to interview material. The commentaries on the selected works, with musical examples, include an analytical component describing structure, form, stylistic and compositional elements, while the technical observations include performance suggestions and a grading for each work. The general catalogue in Addendum A (attached here) lists over 320 works including solos, duos, works for voice and guitar, trios, quartets, ensembles and concertos of some 70 composers. These entries include details on instrumentation, subtitles or movements, source(s), dedications, commissions, premières, composer’s notes and recordings. Quantitative patterns and trends, along with the aesthetic and practical value of this literature, are briefly assessed in the conclusion, which forms part of the main body of the dissertation.\n\nAbstract This is the first comprehensive investigation of music for, or including, the classical guitar by South African composers.
