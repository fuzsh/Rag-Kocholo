It didn't take long for Reid to recognize Justin's potential, signing him into a professional contract that kick-started his journey towards global stardom. Throughout his career so far, Justin has released several chart-topping albums such as My World, Believe, and Purpose which have garnered numerous accolades worldwide including multiple Grammy Awards nominations and wins too. Notably known for hits like “Baby”, “Sorry”, and \"Love Yourself\", this pop sensation has also dabbled successfully in acting with guest appearances in films & TV shows.

Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1981, Timberlake's journey to stardom began at an early age with appearances on Star Search and The Mickey Mouse Club. However, it was his role as lead vocalist for the boy band 'N Sync that catapulted him into the limelight. Known for their harmonious vocals and dynamic performances, 'N Sync became a global phenomenon in the late 1990s, laying the foundation for Timberlake's future solo career. In 2002, Justin Timberlake embarked on his solo venture releasing his debut album, Justified, which earned him two Grammy Awards. His transition from a boy band member to a solo artist was seamless, demonstrating his versatility and artistic growth. Over the years, Timberlake's music has evolved, spanning genres from pop and R&B to electronic, always pushing boundaries and reinventing his sound.
