The focus of this research has been, firstly, to uncover as much of the repertoire as possible, and, secondly, to collate, study, catalogue and report on the information. A brief historical survey of the guitar in South Africa provides the context within which this study was conducted. The primary sources of quantitative data collection were through the archival catalogues of the South African Music Rights Organisation and through personal contact with guitarists, composers and guitar teachers. Other sources consulted were publishers, broadcasting corporations, recording companies, libraries and the internet. The body of the dissertation comprises biographical sketches, background notes, analyses and technical notes on 17 selected solo and chamber works dating from 1947 to 2007 by some of South Africa’s most prominent composers and guitarist composers. The repertoire ranges in style from the traditional and ethnically inspired to the experimental and abstract. As this is an empirical survey, each selected entry includes details on instrumentation, duration, level of difficulty, number of pages, scordatura, commissions or requests, sources or publishers, premières and recordings. A biography of each composer is provided as well as background notes which offer an overview of the selected work. The notes discuss historical, cultural, musical and extra-musical influences, and frequently include references to interview material. The commentaries on the selected works, with musical examples, include an analytical component describing structure, form, stylistic and compositional elements, while the technical observations include performance suggestions and a grading for each work. The general catalogue in Addendum A lists over 320 works including solos, duos, works for voice and guitar, trios, quartets, ensembles and concertos of some 70 composers. These entries include details on instrumentation, subtitles or movements, source(s), dedications, commissions, premières, composer’s notes and recordings. Quantitative patterns and trends, along with the aesthetic and practical value of this literature, are briefly assessed in the conclusion.\n\nThis is the first comprehensive investigation of music for, or including, the classical guitar by South African composers.

The exegesis reveals this evolution through the critical analysis of archival material, the examination of historical developments, and the interviewing of twelve key people who were active in the classical guitar scene from the late 1950s to the present day. It also reflects on the author’s commissioning and/or performing of fifteen major works for guitar by nine New Zealand composers. It examines the drivers that shaped the development of New Zealand guitar music, the factors that led to the creation of key compositions and the role performers have played through collaboration with composers in an attempt to create a significant body of distinctive works. Key findings include identifying that certain important New Zealand composers were, in fact, ahead of their counterparts in other comparable countries in ...\n\nDisclaimer/Complaints regulations If you believe that digital publication of certain material infringes any of your rights or (privacy) interests, please let the Library know, stating your reasons.
