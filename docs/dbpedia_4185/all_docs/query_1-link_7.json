        "text": "The main thing that I have against this Remix is the lack of strings. They were used so heavily in the original, so a remix of the Halo Theme without much strings just doesn't cut it. Not for me anyway.\n\nIf there were more strings to this, I'd love it.\n\nThe rythmic changes that were made are cool, however, and they definately were a touch of a surprise for me. Snare and bass drum at the beginning was very nice, and the use of the Gregorian chant throughout the piece was also interesting and something that I enjoyed.\n\nSo on that note, good job!\n\nThere's my two-and-a-half cents.\n\nThe Halo theme is actually quite a simple melody, which is becoming more common with modern game soundtracks. I would never call it one of the best themes of gaming history, but it works well and, lucky for us, is extremely versatile and adaptable to remixing.\n\nI loved this mix, mainly because I love choral music, and the writing and samples were really well done in the choral department. I'm not sure what people were expecting, but I thought the end was a terrific climax. Certainly satisfied me.\n\nThere are dull samples in here, but that's not worrisome. It's a great package regardless. It has that epic sound, but not the ambition. A brave concept, and one that I'm sure alienates a few people. I dig it, though.\n\nI don't quite understand how someone could have a distaste for Halo without playing it, but, before I'd even BOUGHT the game a few months back, I was already well-accustomed to its interestingly strange, even tribal-like musical style, which featured a roller-coaster of brass swells and high-quality vocals--just my kinda music. Just listening to previews of its soundtrack alone drove me to play the game (I can easily imagine the people in charge of this game thinking \"hey, how about we throw some killer hard-rock in there--that would be SWEET!\" but I'm relieved to see they didn't act on the norm, given the more intense subject-matter a beefier soundtrack like this compliments perfectly.) Good music strikes an emotional chord in the player, making intense scenes in a game that much more memorable. Halo's orchestral dips, tribal drums, haunting vocals, driving beats, and some generally emotionally-charged strings sections are top of the line when it comes to inspiring, emotive music. Make no mistake, people, Halo's soundtrack was professionally done, and this inspired remix is no exception. How can a piece of music be solemn, mellow, heartfelt, thought-provoking, and incredibly intense at the same time? Play Halo and find out--listen to this remix and get a taste. All in all, it's essentially an oh-so-unfortunately-brief showcase of a few of the more modern, string-style aspects of the original soundtrack. Featuring a nice, smooth beginning replete with mellow woodwind instruments, sharp, nicely timed military-like drum beats that sound every bit as good as something you'd see in the latest war movie, a rising brass segment highly reminiscent of the aptly-named Halo Action Theme of the game's soundtrack itself, you'd swear this should be in the game, though it's original enough to stand on its own. I absolutely love the quiet start to this one, which gradually builds into a wonderfully militaristic, definitely-Halo march-like brass segment. The chorus sounds great, but, like a couple other elements of the piece, is a tad muffled. Although the brass sounds quite nice, it doesn't seem as clear or nearly so crisp as it should have been--it's got the beat, feel, and pace all down, but darn it if it's just not as LOUD as it seems it should've been. In all honestly, I thought my speakers were malfunctioning for a second or so--I knew it was supposed to be blowing me away with an incredible swelling brass section (starting at about 2:15) but it just didn't seem right that something so bold and intense should have sounded so...muffled. That's not to say this is a pedestrian, mellow piece by any stretch of the word, though. Although I'd have no qualms just listening to this for leisure, Ruined Desert does manage to come across as a strong, driving, though ulitmately short homage to Halo's unique style of music, and one that I'd be downright stupid not to recommend. The gong at the end just makes you wish there was more to it, though..."
