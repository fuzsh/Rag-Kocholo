        "text": "With 1.3 billion people of all shades, an estimated 2,000 dialects tucked from north to south into 54 countries, Africa’s envied musical offerings are wide-reaching. And there are deep cultural contexts to each evolving genre.\n\nA lot of African music has been both born and buried by slavery and colonial rule, as in Moroccan Gnawa, Mozambique’s Marrabenta and Cote d’Ivoire’s coupé-décalé, or heirloomed across time in the cases of Lesotho’s Famo, Tanzania’s Singeli as well as Congolese rumba and Soukous, to name a few.\n\nFor some people, it’s hard to imagine that rock music – itself rooted in the blues – was invented by a queer, Black woman in Sister Rosetta Tharpe, or that disco, techno and house was pioneered for and by Black, queer folk in the time of Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy, let alone that the foundations of a lot of today’s pop and R’n’B rest in the hands of African slaves. Considering this, it’s fascinating to imagine what can happen next in Africa’s musical future.\n\nWith the global popularity of Afrobeats and Aaapiano surging year on year, it’s inevitable that the rest of the world will grow ever more curious as to what else can be excavated from the continent’s cultural mainstays. The problem with this lies in the fact that a lot of African music doesn’t need to be ​“unearthed” or even ​“discovered.” It’s right there, in the present day, playing on radios and smartphones, billowing from store windows right alongside the latest pop hits from the east and west, with our own pioneers fighting to prevent their precious sounds from dilution.\n\nThat said, in recent years young folks of the diaspora have been taking more and more pride in their heritage and embracing the blend of western and traditional. Artists in Nigeria and South Africa, in particular, have gained massive audiences in the UK and the USA, while the Justin Biebers, Ed Sheerans and Jorja Smiths are seeking out collaborations with Wizkids, Burna Boys and Niniolas. When these connections are made, the debate of appreciation vs. appropriation rages across social media.\n\nRich with spirit and culture, Africa has always had the next ​“hot” genre, and you’ve noticed that it might be time to spice up your catalogue with an African chant or two on your next mix. Please… don’t be That Guy. Take a beat and ask yourself: Have I done my research with reliable sources? Have I credited contributing artists and have I shared my platform with its pioneers?\n\nJazz pianist and composer Nduduzo Makathini says it best, in that melodious African music relies on lingo and lilt as much as Lambe, log drums and the like for cultural weight. Below is a brief history of some of Africa’s most exciting genres to further your understanding.\n\nCountry/​area of origin: Cabo Verde\n\nWith a skittish, bi-rhythmic beat backed by breathy concertinas and jangling ferrinhos, funaná is a vibrant style that can be anywhere between 77 and 157 BPM. While most lyrics take the form of poetic Creoles to narrate everyday life, recent years have seen bands such as Scuru Fitchadu add punk elements to the sound, giving it a gnarly twist that can make a folk instrument such as the accordion sound like a harbinger of revolt.\n\nThe history of funaná is in accordance with this radical spirit. The genre’s pioneer, Bitori (who taught himself how to play the accordion on a boat trip in the 1950s) returned to Praia with this frenetic new sound in hand. Once there, funaná came to be seen as symbolic of Cape Verdean independence and music of the lowbrow, eventually banned by Portuguese colonial rule. However, in partnering with vocalist Chando Graciosa, the gorgeous Indian ocean archipelago would see the genre approach a renaissance in the wake of its newly found independence. A good way to familiarise yourself is with this Analog Africa compilation, a spectacular showcase of the island’s collaborative gems.\n\nTime travel with: Gil Semedo — Nha Funana (1999)\n\nSee how it’s evolved with: Lura – Na Ri Na (2004)\n\nPush boundaries with: Scuru Fitchadu – Manus Planus Danus (2010)\n\nCountry/​area of origin: Continent-wide\n\nTaken further afield by pioneers such as Black Coffee, Vinny Da Vinci and Heavy K in the 90s and early 2000s, South Africa has come to be known as the continent’s electronic powerhouse with creators such as Prince Kaybee, Sun El Musician, Thandi Draai and Lady Sakhe carrying the torch in Afro-and-deep house to present day. Zambia, Kenya and Uganda’s electronic scenes are overflowing with indigenous percussion and lyrics with deep meaning – so don’t add those lyrics to your tech beat without finding out what they mean, where they come from and to whom the voice belongs.\n\nFurther north and in recent years, Nigerian producer Sarz lends his hand to pop-leaning house, while Adey Omotade makes stellar use of Yoruba chants and traditional shekere and bàtá drums on this year’s NIRI album. Containing various African percussives, with languages ranging from Toshi’s isiZulu to Idd Aziz’s Mijikenda, the Afro-prefix has been tacked on whenever folks felt the need to anchor the music toward home, but make no mistake — these sounds are designed purposeful and arranged imaginatively, for all moods and means, and is proudly African.\n\nTime travel with: DJ Kent, Ziyon – Your Love (2016)\n\nSee how it’s evolved with: Tekniq – Children of Zion (2021)\n\nPush boundaries with: Adey Omotade — NIRI (2021)"
