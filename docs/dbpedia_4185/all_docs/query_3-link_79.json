They combine their namesake’s flat-picking, Lyndsay Pruett’s nimble violin and jazz and hip-hop rhythms from former Atmosphere drummer Patrick Armitage.” –Indy Week, Justin Weber\n\nASHEVILLE, NC — Jon Stickley Trio has earned a reputation for painlessly shattering expectations. The originality and sheer energy of this genre-bending ensemble serves as a welcome wake up call for those who experience it. With roots in bluegrass, gypsy jazz, and hip-hop, Jon Stickley, one of the world’s most innovative flatpickers, violinist Lyndsay Pruett (Futureman), and drummer Patrick Armitage (Atmosphere), have fused their collective styles into a repertoire of exciting, innovative original music, along with fresh takes on traditional tunes. They are set to release a new album, Lost at Last, in October of 2015.\n\nThe album was recorded in Asheville, NC’s iconic Echo Mountain Studios, under the watchful eye of producer Dave King (The Bad Plus). While recording the album, King referred to the band’s imaginative sound as “this whole other thing.” King’s creative energy and inspired musical approach led the band deeper and deeper into the heart of their musical consciousness, which led to the solidification of their musical identity.\n\nLost at Last features six original tunes, along with covers of The Bad Plus, Tim O’Brien, and Bela Fleck. The record also includes a traditional gypsy jazz waltz, and ends with Andy Thorn’s banjo ripper, “Flight of the Durban,” all done in the Trio’s signature explosive style.\n\nThe virtuosic trio’s compositions truly do not fit into any specific genre, but remain totally accessible and danceable to audiences across the board, while remaining true to their musical roots. The Trio successfully raised over $18,000 in a Kickstarter campaign that solidified the band’s fan base with over 300 people pre-ordering CDs, and pledging their support.\n\nIn their short time together, the trio has shared the stage with The Infamous Stringdusters, Leftover Salmon, Larry Keel, Leon Russell, amongst others and have thrilled audiences at some of the nation’s top festivals including MerleFest, Floydfest, and Four Corners Folk Fest. Billy Nershi (String Cheese Incident) says, “I’ve had the pleasure of playing with Jon onstage and off. He always plays something I didn’t think was possible.”\n\n“The inspiration of blending the rhythmic, fast-paced techniques of Bluegrass with songs from the other end of the musical spectrum led to the formation of Stickley’s eponymous trio.” writes Alli Marshall with Asheville’s Mountain Xpress. Through the recording of Lost at Last, the band has honed their fiery, yet sensitive sound to create something that is uniquely the Jon Stickley Trio.\n\nJon Stickley Trio travels through Colorado’s Front Range in late June. They pick back up for a hometown show with The Hackensaw Boys in Asheville in mid-July followed by performances in Virginia, Georgia, and Tennessee. More shows to be announced.\n\nJon Stickley Trio on Tour\n\n6/6 Sat – Nantahala Brewing Co – Bryson City, NC\n\n6/24 Wed – Barkley Ballroom – Frisco, CO\n\n6/25 Thu – Cervantes’ Other Side – Denver, CO >\n\n6/26 Fri – Clear Creek RapidGrass – Idaho Springs, CO\n\n6/27 Sat – Oskar Blues – Longmont, CO\n\n6/28 Sun – Oskar Blues – Lyons, CO\n\n7/10 Fri – RiverMUSIC – Asheville, NC *\n\n7/11 Sat – Red Wing Roots – Mt.

Since 2007 when the group formed, they have been playing music that is consistently as catchy as it is heartfelt. Organically grown around the songs of lead singer Amanda Anne Platt, the band has gained an audience that has stretched far beyond their mountain home to include all corners of the United States. They were voted WNC’s favorite Americana band in the Mountain Xpress reader’s poll for three years in a row from 2011-2013. This past spring they surpassed their Kickstarter goal of raising $28,000 to fund their next album, which they are currently recording in Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville.\n\nAmanda Anne Platt has been hailed as “one of the best songwriters coming out of WNC these days” by WNCW programming director Martin Anderson, and her voice has been described as “perfectly unadorned” and “recklessly beautiful”. Her song, “Little Bird,” won second place in the general category of the Chris Austin Songwriting contest in 2011 as well as taking home the grand prize in the Great Lakes Songwriting Contest that same year. Her lyrics are as catchy and heartbreaking as her melodies. Dane Smith of Asheville NC’s Mountain Xpress writes “Her songs make you sad…in a good way!” In both her simple composition and honest delivery it’s easy to hear the influence of country legends such as Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, or Loretta Lynn, and with this Miss Platt credits growing up listening to her Father’s extensive record collection every Saturday morning. Despite her love for classic country, she cites Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty as major influences and her songwriting carries a wit and an edge that plants her firmly in her generation.\n\nThe band is frequently mentioned along with the movement to “Take country music back to it’s roots”. The Honeycutters are just doing what they know how to do: making music that feels as good to hear as it does to play. Their original brand of Americana has proven equally appealing to both the musician and the music lover, the country and the city, and the old and the young.\n\nTal Taylor on mandolin, Rick Cooper on bass, Josh Milligan on drums, and Matt Smith on guitar & pedal steel round out Platt’s songs and create a sound that carries just as well across the bar room as in a church or a theater.\n\nFor more information about the Honeycutters and their tour dates, please visit: www.thehoneycutters.com.\n\nAbout Sam Lewis:\n\nSince his successful debut of his self-titled album, Sam Lewis has been busy crafting songs the next one. A soulful songwriter, Sam sings with raw emotion, inviting you into his life and love stories; he has a way of touching deep into the heart of listeners with his straight-forward and captivating music. “There’s so much soul pouring out of this guy’s pores you could bathe in it. It’s like hearing Al Green for the first time,” writes No Depression’s Grant Britt.\n\nTo find out more about Sam Lewis, visit http://samlewistunes.com\n\nAbout Johnson’s Crossroad:\n\nJohnson’s Crossroad has been described by friends and fans as everything from Appalachian Soul” to “Hillbilly Metal.” The band blends blues, roots-rock, folk, bluegrass, and Appalachian Old Time for a sound that The Daily Times’ Steve Wildsmith calls “both mournful and jubilant, breezy and graveyard serious.” He goes on to comment that frontman Paul Johnson’s voice “barely rises above a growl, but he stretches that sound to encompass the experience of a train-hopping hobo and the wisdom of an old man recalling loves lost and wars fought from the porch of a backwoods cabin.”\n\nFor more about Johnson’s Crossroad, http://jxrmusic.com\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe Honeycutters Release NEW Album “When Bitter Met Sweet”\n\nThe Grey Eagle\n\nSaturday, May 5th\n\nMoses Atwood Opens\n\nDoors 7pm, Show starts at 8pm\n\n$8 adv/ $10 at door\n\n185 Clingman Ave. 28801\n\n828-232-5800\n\nIn a world that is becoming increasingly digitalized and impersonal, the Honeycutters are building a reputation based on live performance and songs that tend to stick with you. Fitting into Americana realm, Mountain Xpress’s Alli Marshall calls The Honeycutters’ sound, “Old school country in the truest sense… free of twang and ten-gallon hats but full of real emotion, family history, quick wit and strong liquor.”\n\nIn an interview with the Folk to Folk Blog, Amanda says that part of the Honeycutters appeal is that their sound harkens back to simpler, more honest times. “In times like these, people want something real,” she said. “They’re just really craving something that’s just going to connect them to that basic human pool of emotion.”\n\nThe Honeycutters are excited to introduce their second full length studio release, When Bitter Met Sweet on June 5th, 2012. They are hosting their Asheville CD release show at the Grey Eagle on Saturday, May 5th. Copies of the album will be available at the show. Moses Atwood opens the show, which starts at 8pm sharp. The Honeycutters will also be making an appearance on WNCW’s Studio B during the 11 o’clock AM hour on Thursday, May 3rd… tune in at http://wncw.org.\n\nLike their first release, Irene, When Bitter Met Sweet features singer/songwriter Amanda Anne Platt, who has been hailed as “one of the best songwriters coming out of WNC these days” by WNCW programming director Martin Anderson. Peter James accompanies her on lead and rhythm guitar as well as harmony vocals. They are backed up by Tal Taylor’s signature mandolin playing, Ian Harrod on bass, and Jon Ashley on drums creating an original brand of Americana that has proved equally appealing to both the musician and the music lover, the country and the city, and the old and the young.\n\nPlatt’s songs are shaped by a raw honesty that comes straight from the heart and emits a sort of melancholy happiness. The album features 11 tracks that touch upon childhood and loss of innocence, finding a sense of belonging and one’s voice, truth, love and patience, traveling and embarking on new life-journeys (and the fears that go along with these), and the understanding that comes about when life’s circumstances come full circle.\n\nThe title track, “When Bitter Met Sweet” is a song about the end of love looking back at the beginning. Platt says, “I think it’s important not to lose sight of what was good about something even if it is ending.” “For Eleanora,” was inspired after reading a biography of Billie Holiday and reflects on a similar thought of polarities that, “It seems like so often the partners of extreme talent and specialness are self-destruction and doubt.”\n\nThe song “90 Miles (The Tennessee Song)” is featured on Blue Ridge Outdoors Trailmix for 2012 Merlefest Artists. It was written after her first trip to International Folk Alliance in 2010, an event that can be quite overwhelming at first. An admitted introvert, Amanda was faced with the challenges of how to be heard amongst all of the activity of events such as these. And make herself heard is exactly what she went on to do; becoming a finalist at 2011 Merlefest’s Chris Austin songwriting contest for her song song “Little Bird” (unrecorded). She was asked to return as a guest judge for the contest, along with Jim Lauderdale, for the 2012 Merlefest (Where The Honeycutters will also be performing a few sets this year). The same song won first place in the Great Lakes Song Contest in February 2012.\n\n“All I Got, ” is a song Amanda calls, “a love song I wrote a long, long time ago, before I had actually ever been in love” and was selected for WNCW’s 2010 Crowd Around the Mic Vol. 14.\n\n“Fancy Car” features Platt’s father on harmonica. He also sits in on “Not Over Yet” which she says that when she sings it she imagines a child leaving home for the first time, wanting freedom but scared of what it might cost.\n\nWhen Bitter Met Sweet was co-produced by Amanda and Peter with the assistance of Aaron Price, and was recorded at Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, NC after securing funding through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Along with the full band, many special guests make appearances on the album including Matt Smith (pedal steel and dobro), Nicky Sanders (fiddle), Mark Platt (harmonica), Je Widenhouse (coronet), and on drums Mike Rhodes and Richard Foulk and for various songs. The album was engineered (and partially mixed) by Jon Ashley with the assistance of Julian Dreyer, mixed by John Keane and mastered by Dave Harris at Studio B Mastering in Charlotte, NC.\n\nTheir first full length studio release Irene, released in May 2009, has landed them in Ian Hughes’ NoDepression Podcast’s Top 20 of 2009, Fret Knot Radio Hour’s “Nine you need to know from ’09”, and #32 in WNCW’s listener voted Top 100 of 2009.\n\nSince putting out Irene the Honeycutters have shared the stage with such Americana favorites as Tony Rice, The Greencards, Jill Andrews, The Steep Canyon Rangers, Donna the Buffalo, and The Seldom Scene. They have been voted Western North Carolina’s favorite local Americana act (2011 Mountain Xpress reader’s poll) and delighted audiences from upstate New York to Seattle, Washington. They are currently touring around the release of When Bitter Met Sweet.\n\nStay tuned to thehoneycutters.com for more news about the album and their tour.\n\nWhat the Press is saying about The Honeycutters:\n\n“I can see a day when her name is mentioned alongside Lucinda Williams, Mary Gauthier and Gillian Welch. She’s just that good.” —The Real Southern\n\n***\n\n“They’ve got a sound as classic as grits… I thought of those country songs that play on those diner jukeboxes you see in movies.” –Charlotte’s Creative Loafing\n\n***\n\n“Amanda Platt’s striking, timeless vocals form the cornerstone of her often heart-wrenching songs, while producer Pete James’ understated guitar and gentle harmonies round out the duo’s saccharine-sweet mix.” –Dane Smith, Mountain Xpress\n\n***\n\n“Amanda’s lyrics are both sardonic and sweet, which adds a contemporary element to their country twanged Americana sound [which] is more influenced by the harmonic tendencies of country singers like Johnny Cash and June Carter” —Folk to Folk Blog.\n\n***\n\n“I recommend the Honeycutters not only because they’re some of the best my hometown of Asheville, NC, has to offer. Their music embodies a very catchy, accessible, optimistic sort of spirit so frequently lacking in folk circles (where brooding, hyper-analytical music reigns supreme). What’s more, like Carolina Story, they’re a great band replete with tasty harmonies.” –Kim Ruehl, Folk Music About.com\n\n***\n\n“If anyone can make this old metalhead want to whip out the cowboy boots and hat, order a couple of Budweisers and spin my woman around the dance floor, the Honeycutters can.” –Brent Fleury, Bold Life Magazine\n\n***\n\n“Amanda’s voice sings like Carolina farmlands after a rainstorm” –Harvey Robinson, Monkeywhale productions\n\nwww.thehoneycutters.com\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nKellin Watson\n\nCD RELEASE PARTY\n\nPisgah Brewing\n\nSaturday, July 2, 2011\n\nADV: $10/d.o.s.: $12\n\nDoors: 7PM/ Show:8PM\n\n(828) 669-0190\n\n150 Eastside Drive\n\nBlack Mountain, NC 28711\n\nhttp://pisgahbrewing.com\n\nKellin Watson is a internationally-touring singer-songwriter, whose award-winning sound blends elements of blues, pop, folk, and soul. Hailing from Asheville, NC, Kellin draws on herAppalachian roots to bring both power and rawness to her music. “There are a lot of common talents in the world, but there are very few rare talents. I feel that Kellin is a rare, uncommon talent. Her songs have the ability to take someone gently by the wrist and tell them a story…” states Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins. Courtney Devores with The Charlotte Observer describes her, “Jazzy soul and swinging pop comparable to Fiona Apple or a less folksy Ani DiFranco, Watson has an endearing stage demeanor and a killer voice, not to mention soulful songs that don’t fit in any particular box.”\n\nKellin will be releasing her new album, “Halo of Blue” of July 2, 2011 at Pisgah Brewing in Black Mountain, NC. There will be activities going on as soon as doors open at 7pm and possibly a surprise guest opener, so people are encouraged to come early. Also door prizes will be given away! Admission is $10 in advance and $12 the day of the show. Anyone who brings a functioning musical instrument to donate to Operation Happy Note and Operation Music Aid will receive half off their admission price! The requirements for instruments are “new or gently used guitars,violins, mandolins, banjos, keyboards, horns of any kind harmonicas and we even get requests for bagpipes.”\n\n“Halo Of Blue” was created with musician/producer Michael Bellar [Art Garfunkle, and Amos Lee] out of Manhattan, NY and was recorded in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Asheville. Kellin and Michael worked non-stop this past year to put out a simple, honest and stripped down recording with echoes of some of her strongest influences: Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, and Nina Simone. The album has 14 tracks and features cameo’s from some of the greatest musicians and vocalist in North America, including Sarah and Christian Dugas (The Duhks), and Oliver Wood (The Wood Brothers).\n\nPart of the album was recorded in Asheville’s Echo Mountain Studios. “The thing I love about recording at Echo Mountain is the fact that they are prepared for anything you might need,” Watson says in an interview with Jon Elliston in Our State Magazine. “All the engineers and staff make you feel at home and comfortable, which helps you focus on what you’re really there to do: create. Not to mention that it’s a world-class studio in my own backyard — to be able to work in a studio of that quality, right here in Asheville, is amazing.”\n\nElliston goes on to write, “On the new album’s title track, Watson’s band recorded lilting pedal steel guitar parts in one of the studio’s smaller rooms; the guitar offers a delicate complement to Watson’s forceful vocals. The two songs recorded in the “church” studio — the gospel-tinged “Rise” and a smoky, brooding cover of “Sitting on Top of the World” — showcase Watson’s range and confidence. She sounds every bit the singer in her comfort zone, content with recording close to home.\n\nKellin has toured nationally and internationally playing some of the most renowned venues, festivals, events, colleges and universities in the US and Canada, and continues to do so. Playing music and writing songs for the past 16 years, Kellin has released 4 solo independent albums. Her performance stands out as well; Stan of LiveLimeLight.com wrote in a live show review “I was immediately intrigued by her playing style, with percussive hits, finger picking and then strumming, she knows how to use her guitar to its fullest… she filled the room with just the sound of her guitar and voice.”\n\nHere is a nice video of her performing a songs off the new album:\n\nKellin has also been a featured performer on CMT’s Big Break with award winning host and artists Sara Evans stating, “Kellin is a singing beauty, with an amazing voice. There is nothing fake or contrived about her when she performs, she’s just really, really talented, and sings with soul. I love everything about her…” In addition to her CMT appearance, two of Kellin’s songs, “Ship” and “When Is Enough Enough”, touched millions after being aired on two separate episodes of the hugely popular Canadian teen drama, Dregrassi: The Next Generation. This past march, she was asked to play a supporting role in Sag film “Trinity Goodheart” and the director loved one of the tunes on Kellin’s new album and decided to use the song in the film. Here’s a link to the imdb page for it: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1849899/.\n\nKellin has worked with and/ or opened for a wide range of notable artists such as Amos Lee, Little Feat, Susan Tedeschi, The Duhks, Crash Test Dummies, Jessica Simpson, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Sara Evans, Walter Wolfman Washington, Gordie Sampson, members of Band of Horses, and several others. In the words of NPR’s David Dye, Kellin is “a great new artist to keep an ear out for.” Filmmaker Richard O’Sullivan (The Lost Colony) goes on to state, “There’s such beauty and intelligence in her work that you rarely find from someone that young. She’s the type of artist that in twenty years people will be talking about in the same way they talk about the Bob Dylans and the Joni Mitchells now.”\n\nFind Kellin on the web:\n\nHomepage: www.kellinwatson.com\n\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/kellinwatson\n\nReverbnation: www.reverbnation.com/kellinwatson\n\nFacebook: http://on.fb.me/jrPd7A\n\nMyspace: www.myspace.com/kellinwatson\n\nYoutube: http://bit.ly/igkEnC\n\nEvolution Licensing Company Catalog: http://bit.ly/iCFtX9\n\nItunes: http://bit.ly/m7JQCt\n\nCDbaby: http://cdbaby.com/all/kellin\n\n“Her husky voice flows up and down the staff, accompanied by catchy beats, and the result sounds quite eclectic. ” – VERVE Magazine\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nThe skinny white boy from the mountains of Western North Carolina carries around more soul in his restless bones and battered guitar than most of use could ever dream of.

The album was recorded Echo Mountain Studios and Omni Artists Productions; it was mastered at Crossroads Music, all in the Asheville, NC area.\n\nRorey Carroll will be releasing “Roadside Lullabies” at MoDaddy’s bar in Asheville on Thursday, September 23rd. The show start at 9pm with the Honeycutters. Playing along with Carrol for the evening will be Rick Cooper- guitar, Aaron Ramsey- mandolin + banjo, Jess Smith- bass, and Zeb Bowles- fiddle.\n\nRorey Carroll’s fiercely independent spirit is reflected in her songwriting, while her sweet voice resonates the soulful energy. She credits her parents for encouraging her personal expression in music and poetry at an early age. From her life experiences on foot, through the window of her car, to the bed of a freight train, Carroll has learned to use her guitar as a vehicle to tell a story.\n\nShe got her first taste of wandering when she moved from the Midwest to Leadville, a small mining town in Colorado. Leadville exposed her to a different lifestyle. In a place where hitchhiking and living in a tent is the norm, Carroll lived hand to fist, out of a backpack, learning the skills that would take her around the country. Inspired by her new life, she picked up her guitar and started putting her poetry into music. From her first three chords, she wrote her first songs.\n\nAt 20, she decided to walk the Appalachian Trail, from northern Georgia to Maine, with a good friend, a mean dog and a backpack friendly guitar. She fell in love with the older mountains and culture of Appalachia and settled into Asheville, NC after the trail. Immersing herself into an area of the country thick with amazing songwriters, musicians and inspiration, Carroll learned more about the art of songwriting and composition. She delved deeper into herself to create songs with love, angst and emotion.\n\nCarroll began to attract the attention of the music industry with her onstage performances throughout the South and at Desert Rocks in Moab, UT, singing her songs “Head Hung” and “Leaning on Lonely”, and “Golden Sky”. She has sold her self-released recordings through local festivals and music venues across the country.\n\nShow Details at a Glance:\n\nRorey Carroll CD Release Party\n\n“Roadside Lullabies”\n\nThe Honeycutters open\n\nThursday, September 23rd.\n\nMo Daddy’s\n\n9pm, $5 general, $15 with CD\n\n77-B Biltmore Avenue\n\nAsheville, NC\n\n828-258-1550\n\nwww.myspace.com/modaddysbar\n\nwww.roreycarroll.com\n\nRorey Carroll on Facebook\n\nRead Full Post »"
