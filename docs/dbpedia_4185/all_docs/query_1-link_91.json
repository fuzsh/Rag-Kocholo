Fiddler Crabs; And Another Front in the Forever War; on the Littoral Plain That Emerges and Submerges Near the German Channel, Palau 15:51\n\nThis string quartet by noted American composer Joseph Summer is a musical interpretation of the named stories of the preeminent 20th century fabulist, Jorge Luis Borges. Born in 1956, Joseph Summer studied at Oberlin and Carnegie-Mellon, where he later taught. Summer has written four comic operas based on the stories of The Decameron. These operas are part of a planned seven opera cycle, which follows the exploits of a half dozen characters over the course of a week in an imagined 14th century Naples.\n\nMUSIC TO HEAR, Joseph Summer’s follow up to WHO IS SYLVIA from Navona Records off his Shakespeare Concerts set, is the result of the composer’s lifelong obsession with poetry. The album pairs the works of contemporary poets as well as Shakespeare with Summer’s music in order to express deeper significance than either words or music are capable of on their own.\n\nJoseph Summer’s WHO IS SYLVIA is a collection of Shakespeare’s works set to music that will make you question everything you thought you learned in high school English. Summer believes that the famous playwright’s true identity is not William Shakespeare but rather Edward De Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. Many of the songs found on WHO IS SYLVIA come from Summer’s aptly-named The Oxford Songs, a collection of scenes, sonnets, songs, and Summer’s original opera version of Hamlet.\n\n01 Sonnet No. 5 – Sonnet No. 6 5:03\n\n02 Sonnet No. 104 3:49\n\n03 Sonnet No. 91 (2) 3:09\n\n04 Sonnet No. 73 3:39\n\n05 Sonnet No. 133 8:44\n\n06 The Tempest: If By Your Art 6:43\n\n07 O God, That I Were a Man 3:35\n\n01 Concert Overture for Piano 5:03\n\n12 Sonnet LX 4:40\n\n13 O, that this too too solid flesh 7:02\n\n14 Beseech you sir, be merry 8:27\n\n15 The quality of mercy 5:26\n\n16 When That I Was and a Little Tiny Boy 2:24\n\nFULL FATHOM FIVE, the fifth offering in Navona Records’ The Shakespeare Concerts Series, takes the story of The Tempest, from the shipwrecked crew and magical spirits to the imprisoned servants and their questions of identity, and presents a variety of works from the 18th to the 21st centuries that set texts and depict themes from Shakespeare’s play.\n\n“I’ll go so far as to say, mindful that one must never declare ‘genius’ too easily, that the more I experience Joseph Summer’s art, the more I am inclined to apply the term.”\n\n– Fanfare Magazine\n\n01 Full Fathom Five 9:30\n\n07 Where the Bee Sucks 1:48\n\n08 Before you can say Come and Go 0:21\n\n09 I Do Not Know One of My Sex 2:08\n\n14 O Mistress Mine 2:37\n\n15 Love (What Thing Is Love) 2:44\n\n01 Honour, Riches, Marriage-Blessing 22:15\n\n02 Sonnet 127, “In the Old Age Black Was Not Counted Fair” 5:16\n\n03 Sonnet 128, “Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day?” 5:51\n\n04 Gallop Apace You Fiery-Footed Steeds 12:05\n\n05 If Music Be the Food of Love 8:44\n\n06 There Is a Willow Grows Aslant a Brook 4:38\n\nTHE FAIR OPHELIA, the second installment on Navona Records’ The Shakespeare Concerts Series, features works by composer Joseph Summer that are inspired by Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark! With Shakespeare’s texts accompanied with music by Brahms, Strauss, Berlioz, Saint-Saëns, Schumann, and Joseph Summer, this album for vocal and chamber music consists of diverse settings that present the listener with an opportunity to hear Ophelia in a three dimensional perspective.\n\nSHAKESPEARE’S MEMORY is the first offering in Navona’s The Shakespeare Concerts Series. A salmagundi of selections from composer Joseph Summer’s The Oxford Songs, this album includes previously unreleased recordings spanning the life of the series. This first volume includes Summer’s original chamber and vocal compositions set to Shakespeare’s dramas and sonnets and the poetry of Milton and Yeats, performed by a slew of musicians: the Kalmia String Quartet, baritone Chad Sloan, soprano Andrea Chenoweth, mezzo-soprano Kellie Van Horn, tenor Justin Vickers, pianists Miroslav Sekera and Ian Watson, and harpist Lydie Härtelovä.\n\nFLEETING REALMS is an inviting compilation of chamber music featuring six composers. Though the album obviously mixes different compositional voices, the different pieces share many characteristics. FLEETING REALMS is defined by a pervasive uplifting quality. Many of the album’s works feature driving rhythms and a joyfully relaxed sensibility.\n\n14 concerts, 12 venues, 4 days. The 2014 PARMA Music Festival featured a diverse range of events, from concert performances of orchestra, chamber ensembles, solo instruments, and jazz groups, to an outdoor presentation of Prokofiev’s Peter and the Wolf and panel discussions about music licensing and multimedia composition, as well as improvised collaborations between indie rockers and classical instrumentalists.\n\nFINE MUSIC, VOL. 4 is the fourth compilation of the Navona Records Fine Music digital series. This installment features the works of David Nisbet Stewart, Brian Noyes, Jonathan Little, Daniel Perttu, Curt Cacioppo, Santiago Billoni, Alejejandro Rutty, Joanne Carey, Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Summer, Roger Bourland, Kjell Magne Andersen, and Jan Van der Roost. This collection both highlights some of Navona’s choicest tracks and offers a preview of things to come."
