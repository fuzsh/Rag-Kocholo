In 2009, Wizkid signed a record deal with Banky W's Empire Mates Entertainment (E.M.E). He rose to the limelight after releasing \"Holla at Your Boy\", the lead single from his debut studio album, Superstar (2011), which also spawned the singles \"Tease Me/Bad Guys\" and \"Don't Dull\".\n\nIn September 2014, he released the self-titled second studio album, Ayo, which was supported by six singles, including \"Jaiye Jaiye\". Wizkid left E.M.E. after his contract expired. In 2016, Wizkid achieved international recognition following his collaboration with Drake on the hit single \"One Dance\", which reached number-one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in 14 additional countries. The song broke multiple records, making Wizkid the first afrobeats artist to appear in the Guinness World Records.[13] In March 2017, he signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records and released his third studio album, Sounds from the Other Side, later that year.

After a thorough investigation, the newspaper concluded Wizkid impregnated then-undergraduate student Sola Ogudugu.[131] When the story broke, close friends and associates of Wizkid did not confirm it because DNA results were pending at the time.[131] Wizkid broke his silence on the story during several interviews.

He cited Pharrell Williams as one of his fashion style icons. Moreover, he revealed plans to establish a clothing line following the release of Sounds from the Other Side.[139]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nWizkid's work is credited for popularizing Afrobeats worldwide in the late 2010s and early 2020s.[140] Morgan Enos of The Recording Academy praised his 2020 album Made in Lagos as a “potent mix of Afrobeats and R&B\", stating that it ”further accelerated the already-unstoppable surge of Nigerian music throughout the world”.[141] NotJustOk opined \"The ‘afrobeats to the world’ movement is one that has progressed from being a trek, to a trot and now presently, a swift race, with baton tightly clenched by several star players whose sounds have sliced through the airwaves to reach international heights and by so doing, level the once seemingly unsurmountable playing field. One of such acts is Wizkid\".[142] Critics noted that Wizkid has introduced Afrobeats to a wider audience, paving the way for other African artists to reach international success.[143]\n\nIn 2021 Billboard stated that Wizkid \"is the first African artist to truly make a major pop breakthrough in the United States and seems best poised to do so globally, too”.[144] Eromo Egbejule of The Guardian Nigeria mentioned Wizkid as an inspiration for a generation of African artists, including Tiwa Savage, Davido, Mr Eazi, Maleek Berry, Tekno and Burna Boy.[145]\n\nPoppie Platt of The Daily Telegraph said \"The Afrobeats pioneer’s fusion of traditional rhythms, slick R&B production and a smattering of pop-ready lyrics, sung in a mix of Yoruba and English, have helped to commercialise the genre across the West, making it one of the industry’s most profitable – and brilliant – imports. \".[146] Nicole Vassell of The Independent deemed Wizkid \"king of Afrobeats\", by asserting that he's \"undeniably one of the reasons for the genre’s mainstream appeal\".[147] Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times credited his collaborations with international artists such as Chris Brown and Major Lazer for cementing him as a “lasting international pop cultural ambassador”.[148] Former Governor of Minnesota Mark Dayton declared October 6 as \"Wizkid day\" in the state, stating \"Wizkid has inspired Minnesotans, and music fans around the world as one of the biggest cultural influencers of our time.\"[149][150]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nWizkid's music has earned several achievements, including the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a lead artist on Beyoncé's \"Brown Skin Girl\";[151] his first ever Grammy Award.[152][153][154] He is the most awarded African artist at the American Music Awards (2), MTV Video Music Award (1), Soul Train Awards (3), Billboard Awards (3) and iHeartRadio Music Awards (2), while also tying for the most at BET Awards (4), MOBO Awards (6).[155] He is also a recipient of an ASCAP plaque for his songwriting contributions to Drake's \"One Dance\",[156] which also earned two Guinness World Records, for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify, and at the time being the most streamed song on Spotify.[157] Wizkid was cited as one of the Top 100 most influential Africans by New African magazine in 2019.[158] He is also the most awarded artiste in The Headies award history.[159] He was nominated in the Best Global Music Album and the Best Global Music Performance categories in the 64th Annual Grammy Awards for Made in Lagos Deluxe Edition and \"Essence\" respectively.[160] In November 2021, Apple Music Awards announced him as the winner of Artist of the Year (Africa).[161]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Wizkid discography\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nSuperstar (2011)\n\nAyo (2014)\n\nSounds from the Other Side (2017)\n\nMade in Lagos (2020)\n\nMore Love, Less Ego (2022)\n\nTours\n\n[edit]\n\nMade in Lagos Tour (2021)[162]\n\nMore Love, Less Ego Tour (2023)[163]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nOfficial website"
