        "text": "Larry Carlton\n\nLarry Carlton’s own musical story began in Southern California. He picked up his first guitar when he was only six years old. He was introduced to jazz in junior high school after hearing The Gerald Wilson Big Band album, Moment of Truth, with guitarist Joe Pass. Larry then became interested in Barney Kessel, Wes Montgornery and the legendary blues guitarist B.B. King. Saxophonist John Coltrane was also a major influence on Carlton, beginning with Coltrane’s 1962 classic Ballads.\n\nIn 1968 he recorded his first LP, With A Little Help From My Friends (Uni). The enthusiastic industry response garnered him a place among jingle singers The Going Thing, recording on camera and radio commercials for Ford. Mid-season in his second year, he segued to Musical Director for Mrs. Alphabet, an Emmy-nominated children’s show on the same network. It was here that Carlton showcased his acting skills, performing as the show’s co-star, “Larry Guitar.”\n\nCalls began to increase significantly as Carlton gained distinction for the unmistakable and often imitated “sweet” sound he delivered with his Gibson ES-335. He also broke new ground with his new trademark volume pedal technique, eloquently displayed in his featured performance on ­Crusader One with legendary jazz/rock group The Crusaders in 1971. Joni Mitchell’s Court and Spark album, the first record she made with a rhythm section, displays his distinctive Technique – a style Mitchell referred to as “fly fishing.”\n\nDuring his tenure with The Crusaders (through 1976), Carlton performed on 13 of their albums, often contributing material. In 1973, Carlton released his second solo project, SinginglPlaying, on Blue Thumb Records ­ aptly titled, as he not only played guitar, but also performed vocals on eight tracks. Carlton’s demand as a session player was now at its zenith, he was constantly featured with stars from every imaginable genre, ranging from Sammy Davis, Jr., and Herb Alpert to Quincy Jones, Paul Anka, Michael Jackson, John Lennon, Jerry Garcia and Dolly Parton. At the same time, he was still performing more than 50 dates a year with The Crusaders.\n\nBefore he transitioned completely to a solo career, Carlton became one of the most in-demand studio musicians of the past three decades. Carlton’s catalog of work includes film soundtracks, television themes and work on more than 100 gold albums.\n\nUltimately, Carlton began scaling back his session work substantially, while continuing to perform and record with the Crusaders. He shifted his emphasis to the challenges of arranging and producing, and built his own studio-Room 335-in his home. During this period he arranged and produced projects for Barbra Streisand, Joan Baez and Larry Gatlin, as well as producing and co-writing the theme for the hit sitcom Who’s The Boss and co-writing (with Michel Columbier) and arranging the acclaimed movie soundtrack for Against All Odds.\n\nAs his association with the Crusaders began to draw to a close, Carlton signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1977. Between ’78 and ’84, Larry recorded six solo albums for Warner Bros. Records: Mr. 335: Live In Japan, Friends; Eight Times Up; Sleep Walk; Strikes Twice; Larry Carlton. The latter self-titled album was released hot on the heels of his debut session with rock supergroup Steely Dan. Rolling Stone magazine lists Carlton’s tasty ascent on Steely Dan’s Kid Charlemagne as one of the three best guitar licks in rock music.\n\nWith more than 3000 studio sessions under his belt by the early 1980s, Carlton had picked up four Grammy nominations. In addition to winning a Grammy (`81) for the theme to “Hill Street Blues” (a collaboration with Mike Post), he also was voted NARAS’s “Most Valuable Player” for three consecutive years. NARAS then named him “Player Emeritus” and retired him from eligibility.\n\nIn 1985 he was approached by the newly formed MCA Master Series to consider doing an acoustic jazz album. His first release for the new label was Alone, But Never Alone, a consensus No. 1 album on the Radio & Records and Billboard Jazz charts. The twelve months of 1987 brought some of the biggest highlights in Carlton’s solo career. In addition to winning the Grammy for “Minute by Minute,” Carlton received a Grammy nomination for “Best Jazz Fusion Performance” for his live album Last Nite. Coming off of the success of two acoustic albums and one live album, Carlton was on a hot streak and entered the studio to work on his next project, On Solid Ground. The all-electric project was nominated for a Grammy in 1989. The release of On Solid Ground came almost one year after Carlton was brutally shot in a random act of violence outside his Los Angeles studio.\n\nIn 1990, MCA acquired GRP Records and placed their jazz artists under the GRP moniker. Immediately, GRP issued a greatest hits package of Carlton’s work on MCA, called Collection. In 1991, Carlton entered the studio to record a blues-based album with John Ferraro, keyboard man Matt Rollings, bassist Michael Rhodes and harmonica player Terry McMillan. Interrupted by label and consumer demands for another jazz offering, Carlton temporarily shelved what would become Renegade Gentlemen and recorded and released Kid Gloves in ’92. A pop-oriented Jazz collection of lilting acoustic ballads and biting electric workouts, the album marked the first time Carlton had included both acoustic and electric tracks on a single solo project.\n\nIn between touring, Carlton resumed work on the bluesy Renegade Gentlemen. Taking the original six tracks to Nashville (his first time to record in that city), and joining up once again with Michael Rhodes and Terry McMillan, plus drummer Chris Layton (from Stevie Vaughan’s band Double Trouble) and keyboard wizard Chuck Leavell, he recorded four tracks, plus did additional production and mixing on the blues rocker in time for a ’93 release.\n\nCarlton toured extensively that year and the next with jazz superband Stanley Clark And Friends (Stanley Clark, Larry Carlton, Billy Cobham, Deron Johnson and Najee). The quintet released Stanley Clark and Friends Live A t The Greek in ’94.\n\nLarry & Lee, Carlton’s 1995 collaboration with guitar great Lee Ritenour, garnered him his eighth Grammy nomination. This was followed by The Gift in ’96 and Larry Carlton Collection Volume 2 in ’97. That same year, his virtuosity and reputation secured him a place in the crum­topping award-winning Warner Bros. Records’ group Fourplay, when member Lee Ritenour left to head his own label. Carlton doubled the fun by signing to Wamer Jazz as a solo artist at the same time. Since then he has released two albums with Fourplay: 4 in ’98 and a refreshingly different Christmas album, Snowbound, in October ’99. 1999 also brought Larry Carlton his very own spot on Hollywood’s prestigious Rockwalk. On June 3, he was inducted along with Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Jimmie Vaughn.\n\nThe year 2000 starts with Carlton putting his singularly superb fingerprints on the new millennium with his star-studded solo release on Wamer Bros. Records, Fingerprints. Utterly unique, Larry Carlton has set a standard for artistry that spans three decades (and two centuries) and he is undoubtedly destined to leave his mark on jazz, blues, pop and rock for the foreseeable future…\n\nAnother great bio written by Richard Skelly, All-Music Guide:\n\nLarry was born on 2nd of march in 1948 in Torance/California! He moved from LA to Franklin/Tennessee a few years ago and enjoys living in the countryside.\n\nLike so many other Los Angeles studio musicians, guitarist and composer Larry Carlton was faced with a choice a number of years back: whether to go solo and develop a name for himself under his own name or to continue the less risky, more lucrative existence as a session guitarist, making good money and recording with prominent musicians. Fortunately for fans of this eclectic guitarist, he chose the former, and has recorded under his own name for Warner Bros., MCA Records and GRP Records since 1978.\n\nCarlton’s studio credits from the 1970s and early ’80s include musicians and groups like Steely Dan, Joni Mitchell, Michael Jackson, Sammy Davis Jr., Herb Alpert, Quincy Jones, Bobby Bland, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and literally dozens of others. Among his more notable projects as a session guitarist were Joni Mitchell’s critically acclaimed Court and Spark album and Donald Fagen’s Nightfly album. For much of the 1970s, Carlton was active as a session guitarist, recording on up to 500 albums a year. Although he recorded a number of LPs under his own name as early as 1968’s With a Little Help from My Friends (Uni), and 1973’s Singing/Playing, he didn’t land a major-label contract until 1978, when he signed with Warner Bros.\n\nCarlton began taking guitar lessons when he was six. His first professional gig was at a supper club in 1962. After hearing Joe Pass on the radio, he was inspired to play jazz and blues. Wes Montgomery and Barney Kessel became important influences soon after he discovered the jazz guitar stylings of Pass. B.B. King and other blues guitarists had an impact on Carlton’s style as well. He honed his guitar-playing skills in the clubs and studios of greater Los Angeles. He attended a local junior college and Long Beach State College for a year until the Vietnam War ended. Carlton toured with the Fifth Dimension in 1968 and began doing studio sessions in 1970. His early session work included studio dates with pop musicians like Vicki Carr, Andy Williams and the Partridge Family. In 1971, he was asked to join the Crusaders shortly after they’d decided to drop the word “Jazz” from their name, and he remained with the group until 1976. In between tours with the Crusaders, he also did studio session work for hundreds of recordings in every genre. But it was while he with the Crusaders that he developed the highly rhythmic, often bluesy style he has now. His credits include performing on more than 100 gold albums. His theme music credits for TV and films include Against All Odds, Who’s the Boss, and the theme for Hill Street Blues. The latter won a Grammy award in 1981 for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.\n\nCarlton delivered his self-titled debut for Warner Bros. in 1978, shortly after he was recognized for his ground-breaking guitar playing on Steely Dan’s Royal Scam album. (Carlton contributed the memorable guitar solo on “Kid Charlemagne.”) He released four more albums for Warner Bros., Strikes Twice (1980), Sleepwalk (1981), Eight Times Up (1982), and the Grammy-nominated Friends (1983), before being dropped from the label.\n\nHe continued studio session work and touring in between, emerging again in 1986 on MCA Records with an all-acoustic album, Discovery, which contained an instrumental remake of Michael McDonald’s hit, “Minute by Minute.” The single won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1987. Carlton’s live album, Last Nite, released in 1987, got him a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance.\n\nWhile working on his next album for MCA, On Solid Ground, Carlton was the victim of random gun violence, and was shot in the throat by gun-wielding juveniles outside Room 335, his private studio near Burbank, California. The bullet shattered his vocal cord and caused significant nerve trauma, but through intensive therapy and a positive frame of mind, Carlton completed work on On Solid Ground in 1989. Carlton formed Helping Innnocent People (HIP), a non-profit group to aid victims of random gun violence.\n\nCarlton’s most recent albums include two releases in 1996 for GRP Records, Gift and With a Little Help from My Friends. His other recordings include 1990’s Collection and 1992’s Kid Gloves for the same label, Playing/Singing (1995, Edsel), and Renegade Gentleman, a 1993 release for GRP.\n\nDespite the tragedy that was foisted on him in the late ’80s after he was shot by gun-wielding infidels, dragging him through a long and dark period of hospitalization and rehabilitation, Carlton’s output over the years has been steady through the 1980s and 1990s. Carlton seems to have slowed down his touring schedule a bit, but certainly not his recording schedule. Always happy to meet with the press, Carlton has a sweet, peaceful personality, and one can hear it in his unique, rhythmic, warm guitar chords and ringing guitar tones. — Richard Skelly, All-Music Guide\n\nAriel Posen\n\nWith each successive release in his career, Ariel Posen finds his creative tide rising. In 2019, he wrote seven songs for his first album, How Long, and recorded them all, plus some instrumental interludes to fill things out. For his sophomore effort, 2021’s Headway, his songwriting surplus resulted in eight songs being left off the final project. For his latest, Reasons Why, the Canadian singer-songwriter and highly regarded guitarist wrote 30 songs, ultimately choosing 10.\n\n“The only thing I really go into a record thinking is how can I stay true to myself musically and artistically but try to make it better than the last one,” explains Posen, who co-produced Reasons Why with his usual collaborator, Murray Pulver. “What it usually comes down to, more so than production and sound and aesthetic, is the songs. It’s just a matter of doing a record with the best songs I have.”\n\nReasons Why shows once again that “best” is a high standard for Posen. The new songs represent another step forward in every aspect – lyricism, musicality, playing, sonics. The songs are nuanced but impactful, deeply resonant but universally accessible. Posen blends craftsman’s care with the daring do of a seasoned live player, resulting in an immersive adventure that reveals fresh merits on every listen.\n\nOn Reasons Why Posen determinedly defies any easy genre identification and refuses to be sealed in any sonic cubbyhole. “I classify my music as roots, which isn’t the most embraced term out there,” he explains. “However, roots is like this perfect definition in my mind for what I do. It takes in rock, but it’s not rock. It takes in blues, but it’s not blues. It’s soulful, but not what people would classify as soul and R&B. There are elements of Americana, pop…It’s this amalgam term that I’m trying to put out there so one day when people ask what my genre is, I can say ‘roots’ without any further questions.\n\n“I think when you listen to so many different styles of music it tends to come out in your own sound.”\n\nThat’s been the case for Posen all his life. He grew up in Winnipeg, the son of professional musicians, with an array of music was played around the house and seeped into his soul. He started playing piano at a young age but switched to guitar not long after, eventually playing gigs by the time he was 14. “I started going down a pretty heavy rabbit hole of just trying to be the best player I could be,” Posen says.\n\nHe picked up an endless amount sources and inspirations, too many to list succinctly, but that immersion was directly responsible for the eclectic path he took. “Basically, I look at music as this entire thing,” Posen explains, “not just one genre but as an open canvas where it really can be anything and everything to me.”\n\nHe soon developed to a point where he became a valued hired gun for others, touring and recording in studio with countless artists including Tom Jones, Butch Walker, Scary Pockets, Lizzy McAlpine, as well as childhood friends, the Bros. Landreth, among others. But while living in Ireland in 2017, Posen felt the pull to focus on his own music, forming a band and booking shows. Performing prodded him to focus on writing songs and his originals began attracting attention, which led to even more touring opportunities. At that point, Posen was well-seasoned and had a concrete view of how he wanted to pursue a career as an artist.\n\n“It was the right time. I simply wasn’t ready before,” Posen notes. “All the touring and experience I had taught me what to do as a bandleader and an artist — and what not to do. I learned so much, and I’m very grateful it worked out that way.” The world was noticing, too. John Mayer, who hired Posen to play in a commercial for his signature guitar, called him “one of my favorite guitarists.” Britain’s The Guitar Magazine declared him “one of the most toneful and tasteful players to emerge in recent years” – joining other publications such as Rolling Stone, Canada’s CBC, Guitar Player, Guitarist and many more in singing Posen’s praises.\n\nPosen started working on Reasons Why at the beginning of 2020, and the Covid lockdown provided an unintended boon to his work. “I was writing at honestly what felt like my most peak level of creativity I think I’ve ever had,” he says. The songs certainly reflect that: from the big-beat grit of “Man You Raised” and “So Easy” to the funky drive of “I Wish We Never Met,” the modernistic textures of “Broken But Fine” to the heart rending sentiments of “Learning How to Say Goodbye” and “Feel This Way Too,” and the melodic sweep of tracks such as “Always Moving On,” “So Easy” and “Time Can Only Tell.”\n\nSome, Posen acknowledges, are directly personal, others are observations. But as he amassed songs, he also honed in on a theme that unites them. “There’s songs about relationships, forgiveness, pushing toxic people out of your life, mending broken relationships,” Posen explains. “There’s also songs about mental health and the way we have a perception about how we feel, the inner struggles we don’t always let out into the world.”\n\nPosen is, of course, maintaining his regular playing schedule alongside the album’s release. What’s more is he’s already thinking about what’s next, excited to maintain the trajectory of a career that’s at once still young but has the weight of a lifetime of experience behind it.\n\n“I just love creating and making records, and I just want to put out the best stuff I can,” Posen explains. “Each time I sign off on a record it just inspires me to do more. Every project is a little time capsule of where you are right now, and each time out you try to take it another step forward.”\n\nAnomalie\n\nNicolas Dupuis is never far from home. As Anomalie, the shape-shifting production project he unveiled in 2016, Dupuis has channeled his musical upbringing (his mother, a piano teacher; his father, a host on Radio-Canada), formal schooling, and stage-seasoned chops into two companion EPs — Metropole and Metropole II — the Chromeo collaboration Bend the Rules, and a series of singles lighting a pathway to his upcoming long-form debut, Galerie.\n\nThe Metropole series, released in 2017 and 2018, was the story of a city — Dupuis’ native Montreal, where he still resides — visiting familiar landmarks, cosmopolitan rhythms, and well worn streets. By early 2020, Dupuis’ love letters to home had taken him around the world and back, powering two sold-out tours spanning North America (Red Rocks Music Festival, Montreal Jazz Festival, Electric Forest), Europe, and Asia — plus, a social audience now into the millions, and earned endorsements from contemporaries like Charlie Puth, Snarky Puppy and others. On stage, Dupuis honed an astute balance of electronic production, progressive jazz harmonics, and hip hop rhythms with a four-piece group, reinventing genres known for their slippery, expansive definitions.\n\nBut by mid-2020, the world had changed. Those sold-out shows? Replaced by next-door neighbors who, during lockdown, nixed Dupuis’ daytime practice sessions. Unable to write, and seeking room for his ambitions, Dupuis and his girlfriend decided to settle into their own space in Montreal, buying their first home, with a designated personal studio where Dupuis could re discover his momentum.\n\nAs restrictions eased, they spent a week outside Ottawa, camping with friends, communing with nature, and uncovering sounds that would form new ideas — including early inspirations for Galerie’s mesmerizing and cosmic lead single, “Bond.” Lockdown began to recede from view. In his own space, and properly recharged, Dupuis returned to the studio ready to channel his prismatic influences into Galerie, tapping new instrumentation, collaboration, and intentions to develop his most accomplished project to date.\n\n“[The pandemic] made me realize I did need some time for myself to re-evaluate where I wanted to head stylistically,” says Dupuis. “The upright piano has been a huge upgrade creatively. It’s a much richer sound. It was part of the experience of making the sound as well, in terms of texture, with a more raw, organic sound and the way I was tackling drums.”\n\nThe result is a delirious genre fusion inspired by D’Angelo, J. Dilla, Brian Wilson’s Pet Sounds, Herbie Hancock’s Sunlight, and Robert Glasper’s Black Radio. You might call it Cubist, with each song revealing a new side, depth, or angle in Dupuis’ sound.\n\n“Montreal is still an inspiration for me,” he says. “But it was very important for me to not do a Part III and just start fresh. This one is a bit more vague in that sense. These different stories are canvases that together form this aesthetic or creative proposal.”\n\nTake “Come Running To Me,” a bold flip of the 1978 original, trading Hancock’s arrangement of Sunday morning woodwinds and soft, deliberate brass for an updated palette of Saturday night synths and strutting hip-hop drums.\n\n“I started arranging my version of “Come Running to Me” last year just for fun, dropped a snippet on social media and have had people asking for a full version since then,” says Dupuis. It’s a familiar exchange; that crowdsourced encouragement launched nearly half of Galerie’s tracks. Though his creative process is often singular, Dupuis still invites this reciprocal push and-pull between artist and audience, unafraid to open his trust to their reactions and experiences.\n\n“There’s an additional creative drive when I know that I’m doing something somewhat quickly to post it on social media,” he explains. “It’s often resulted in something that I wouldn’t necessarily come up with or approach if it weren’t for that purpose.”\n\nEven during a period of unprecedented isolation, community comes easy for Dupuis, a regular Twitch streamer who sharpened his collaborative instincts in Montreal’s nighttime hip-hop cyphers. Anchored by a house band that he would eventually join, these weekly sessions opened the stage for local artists to blend modern favorites with jazz and R&B standards, becoming a breakthrough for Dupuis’ own crossover visions.\n\n“Especially today, every musical genre is much larger than it was before,” he says. “There’s some form of crossover in pretty much everything we listen to.”\n\n“Memory Leaves” lives in that uncharted territory, combining Dupuis’ dextrous playing and melodic finesse with a stirring verse by Masego devoted to craft, fleeting inspirations, and an artist’s life.\n\n“I’ve rarely connected with someone creatively as I did with Masego,” says Dupuis. “You feel when there’s something that happens that quickly, and you’re on the same wavelength. That happens kind of rarely.”\n\nIn kind, “Memory Leaves” pairs amiably with earlier singles “Bond” and the beat-driven “Dribble.” Together, these tracks aren’t just an exhibition; they’re a resounding thesis, a road map tracing how consonant styles overlap and interact. By reinvigorating jazz harmony, Dupuis is slyly driving broader audiences to discover or renew their love for the foundational components in today’s voices.\n\nGalerie’s forward-facing approach may call to mind a timeless phrase familiar to any jazzhead: The Shape of Jazz to Come. Ornette Coleman’s 1959 opus re-configured traditional notions of harmonic structure, its title and content serving as both a blueprint and open question for progressive music’s future. With Dupuis’ reverent but revolutionary project, that answer is no longer in the past or on the horizon; it’s here."
