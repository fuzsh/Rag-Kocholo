His second stint was in Season 10, 1984-1985.4 Voice of America was 2 hours; Hour of Power was 60 minutes; Le Show is 59 minutes.5 Rick Kogan, Shearer Not Afraid to Take Political Pot Shots, Chicago Tribune, July 29, 1988, G2.6 Personal correspondence, November 7, 2019. I dont have a real process I use. I distill the material out of my dread over what Ill be doing next for the show. Harry Shearer, quoted in Lawrence Christon, “Shearer’s Campaign for Truth in Satirizing, Los Angeles Times, June 14, 1987, L84.7 Jack Shafer, Who Said It First?

I didnt keep track then. But I did have just a slight twinge driving to the Le Show-atorium today because weve been announcing – we? me – Ive been announcing a lot of additional stations to the ever-growing but until this week still tiny Le Show network. But this week I think I cant say that anymore cause weve just added our first 50,000-watt AM radio affiliate, WGN in Chicago. Colonel McCormick is spinning in his grave right about now, I would say…. But it’s such a thrill to be on the same, for the first time, to be on the same radio station as Paul Harvey. It’s true. https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-81faa682ed3?proxy_start_time=680.743121. 13 Kathy Fuller-Seeley, The Jack Benny Program, Library of Congress, National Recording Preservation Board, https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/documents/JackBennyProgram.pdf. 14 Harry Shearer to Marc Maron, in Maron, Harry Shearer. 15 Michele Hilmes, Radio Voices: American Broadcasting, 1922-1952 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997); Kathryn H.

According to Richard Lanham, the ancient Greek orator Lysias was the first to fully develop the technique. Richard A. Lanham, Handlist of Rhetorical Terms. 2nd ed. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 71.36 Ladies and gentlemen, as much as I was bewitched and besotted by comedy at an early age, I was also fascinated and seduced by journalism. I can remember at age 5, or whenever it was my parents first trusted me with blunt little scissors, cutting out and collecting the mastheads for all the different sections of the two daily papers we subscribed to, the main criterion for which was whichever papers in L.A. were still publishing and werent the Times. When my moment came to be interviewed on TV by Art Linkletter, I confessed to my habit of making my parents take me to the out of town newsstand in Hollywood whenever possible, and for years our mailbox was filled with dailies from Fergus Falls, Minn., and other far-flung locales.

An example comes early in this episode: https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-68cbe190b3d. On diastole see Richard Lanham, Handlist of Rhetorical Terms, 182. Shearers diastole operates in his news announcer and radio promoter voices more generally, as in his habitual sign-off to the News of the Olympic Movement: … because its a movement, and we all need one … every day!

Learning about radio history can help puncture the uninterrogated fables that inform works of 20th century US history.

And we have laws against selling drugs, pushing drugs, using drugs, importing drugs.

He added, 'And so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up.'\" See \"Rush Limbaugh Arrested on Prescription Drug Charges\" New York Times, April 28, 2006, https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/us/rush-limbaugh-arrested-on-prescription-drug-charges.html.\n\n120 Allana Akhtar, \"Brits Are Calling Out the 'Dystopian' and 'Post-Apocalyptic' American Pharma Ads That Aired during Oprah's Interview with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry,\" Business Insider, March 8, 2021, https://www.businessinsider.com/brits-call-american-pharmaceutical-ads-post-apocalyptic-2021-3.\n\n121 Gardiner Harris, \"Pfizer Pays $2.3 Billion to Settle Marketing Case,\" New York Times, September 2, 2009, https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/03/business/03health.html.\n\n122 \"Merger Record in '88 Is Seen,\" New York Times, November 21, 1988, https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/21/business/merger-record-in-88-is-seen.html.\n\n123 Howard Kurtz, \"Bush Angrily Denounces Report of Extramarital Affair as 'A Lie,'\" Washington Post, August 12, 1992, https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/08/12/bush-angrily-denounces-report-of-extramarital-affair-as-a-lie/431e91c8-ff23-4afd-843c-b083f297fff4/.\n\n124 James Sterngold, \"Balomon to Join Shearson in Nabisco Battle,\" New York Times, October 28, 1988, https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/28/business/salomon-to-join-shearson-in-nabisco-battle.html.\n\n125 JJ Sutherland, \"Karzai Brother Being Investigated for Corruption,\" The Two-Way, NPR, September 27, 2010, https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2010/09/27/130152430/karzai-brother-being-investigated-for-corruption.\n\n126 David Dzikowski, \"The Ironic Voice and Subjunctive Mood of Public Radio Programming\" (Ph.D. diss., Pennsylvania State University, 2009), 13.\n\n127 NPR, \"Tom and Ray Magliozzi: Hosts, Car Talk,\" undated, https://www.npr.org/people/2100834/tom-and-ray-magliozzi.\n\n128 NPR, \"Tom and Ray Magliozzi.\"\n\n129 \"Afghan President Karzai's Brother Targeted in U.S. Investigation,\" Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, September 27, 2010, https://www.rferl.org/a/Afghan_President_Karzai_Brother_Targeted_In_US_Investigation/2169230.html.\n\n130 \"The London native gave viewers a glimpse of those with 'champagne wishes and caviar dreams' with Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, which aired in syndication from 1984-95.\" See Jackie Strause and Mike Barnes, \"Robin Leach, 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' Host Dies at 76,\" Hollywood Reporter, August 24, 2018, https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/robin-leach-dead-lifestyles-rich-famous-host-dies-1137244/.\n\n131 \"National Academy of Sciences Confirms That Formaldehyde Can Cause Cancer in a Finding That Has Implications for Anatomic Pathology and Histology Laboratories,\" Dark Daily, July 13, 2015, https://www.darkdaily.com/2015/07/13/national-academy-of-sciences-confirms-that-formaldehyde-can-cause-cancer-in-a-finding-that-has-implications-for-anatomic-pathology-and-histology-laboratories-713/.\n\n132 Frazier Moore, \"Lewis Brought Strange Energy to MDA Telethon,\" Telegram & Gazette, September 4, 2011, https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/north/2011/09/04/lewis-brought-strange-energy-to/49913954007/.\n\n133 Harry Shearer, \"Telethon,\" Film Comment 15, issue 3 (May/June 1979), 33-48.
