        "text": "Following a Dec. 17 Christmas special, January 14 will mark 30 years since the official season premiere of \"The Simpsons.\" Today, the show still holds the trophy as the longest-running primetime TV series. If you look back on the 670-plus episodes of the animated series, you're likely to find a few constants: Homer will undoubtedly cause a catastrophe, Lisa will voice her opinions on issues important to her, Bart will get into trouble and a musical guest or two will appear in nearly every season. In fact, since the series premiered, music has played an integral role in many of the storylines and has arguably helped \"The Simpsons\" become as venerable of a show as it is today.\n\nAs evidence of music's permanent place in \"The Simpsons,\" we learn in multiple episodes that Homer is often regretful of not having lived out his dream to become a rock star; Lisa can often be found playing her baritone saxophone when not studying; the now-popular theme song was composed by GRAMMY winner Danny Elfman, and countless bands, artists and musicians have lent their voices to tons of episodes, often playing themselves but sometimes other characters.\n\nWhat is it about music and \"The Simpsons\" that make the two pair so well together, and what has helped the show, after 30 years and counting, remain as popular and influential today? To help us understand the continued cultural impact of \"The Simpsons,\" we asked a few of the guest stars, and one of the individuals behind the show, about the everlasting impression that Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and the rest of the cast have made on all of us.\n\n\"There's something so compelling about them,\" says supervising director Mike Anderson, who's been with the show for 30 years and was the one who made Sigur Rós' participation in season 24 happen. \"I think somehow the Simpsons—the yellow Simpsons—represent all of us. I think we are them, we have seen the experiences, somehow, we understand them. And they're a part of us that we love. And also, we can watch from the safety of our homes as Homer bashes his head between a ship and a pier post or saws himself in half [Laughs].\"\n\nPeter Frampton, who appeared in the season seven episode \"Homerpalooza\" says it’s the juxtaposition of pairing artists who reach different demographics. \"I’m on the same show as the Smashing Pumpkins, who started out much later,\" he says. \"Everything put together makes the most impact for the script.\"\n\nRead More: Peter Frampton On His Farewell Tour, Living With I.B.M. & Reclaiming 'Peter F**king Frampton'\n\nShawn Colvin, who appeared in two episodes as the lead singer of a church band named Rachel Jordan, adds, \"'The Simpsons' has a certain edge and sophistication and irreverence in its humor and content, while still being silly and fun, thus making it relevant to all ages. The characters are so lovable and well-developed, not to mention well-played. They are relatable. Ultimately, it’s an intelligent show that also succeeds in being kind of stupid, in the best possible way.\"\n\nRandy Bachman of Bachman Turner Overdrive, who appeared with the band in season 11, says having music play such a large role on the series has \"made the Simpsons a very hip and relevant contemporary show. Besides the continuing family adventures of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and all the other characters, it was unique to see musicians cartooned and hear their music integrated into the shows. It was a win-win-win for all.\"\n\nWelsh singer/songwriter Judith Owen, who appeared in two episodes of the show, says, \"One of the charms of 'The Simpsons' is that it actually has a foothold in reality. The fact that you've got this father, who's doing a really boring job in a factory but feels the regret of having given up his dream to be a musician, how many people are like that in real life? These are real experiences that people feel, which is having to give up their youthful dreams because they can’t pursue it because they have a family or obligations. Those are things that make the show pertinent and real.\"\n\nOwen adds, \"The music acts, like it so often does in life, as being the thing that connects you to humanity, and that is what music does anyway. Whether it be artists, or the very nature of the characters being musical, it connects the viewer to them in a very human way because even though it’s all make-believe, it has real things that we all understand.\"\n\nAnderson adds that what makes \"The Simpsons\" so relevant 30 years later, is that we can find ourselves in one of the characters. \"They hold up a mirror to the craziness in the world going on, but they make fun of it. It's a safe way to look at problems.\"\n\nAs far as the impact \"The Simpsons\" as had on all of us, the viewers, Anderson posits, \"It's in our DNA now. It’s hard to imagine a world without the Simpsons.\"\n\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary since the show's premiere, we've compiled a complete list, with some highlights, of every musical guest appearance on the show. Take a walk down memory lane and see if you can imagine a world without \"The Simpsons.\"\n\nSeason 1\n\nEpisode 6—Ron Taylor: \"Moaning Lisa\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vk3oYIDN_mc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn the inaugural season of \"The Simpsons,\" Lisa is struggling to find purpose in the world. She finds solace in her saxophone, but characters, like her music teacher Mr. Largo, get in the way. Then, one night as she’s sulking in her room, feeling down and defeated, she hears the soulful sax sounds of \"Bleeding Gums\" Murphy, played by the late actor, singer and writer Ron Taylor. Lisa sneaks out of her room, follows the music and eventually meets \"Bleeding Gums,\" who teaches her how to express her feelings through music. Together, they write \"Moanin' Lisa Blues.\"\n\nSeason 2\n\nEpisode 5—Tony Bennett and Daryl Coley: \"Dancin' Homer\"\n\nEpisode 31—Ringo Starr: \"Brush With Greatness\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/y4wnoG_h8XE' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn Season 2 episode \"Dancin' Homer,\" Homer and family attend a baseball game to see the Springfield Isotopes. \"Bleeding Gums\" Murphy makes another appearance to perform the National Anthem, and this time his voice is supplied by the late singer Daryl Coley. As the title suggests, \"dancin' Homer\" fires up the crowd with a spur-of-the-moment performance, impressing the baseball big shots so much that they promote him to work for the Capital City Capitals. As the Simpsons arrive in Capital City, a song of the same name, performed by GRAMMY winner Tony Bennett, plays as Bennett himself makes a quick cameo with the line, \"Hey, good to see you.\"\n\nAdding more star—er, Starr?—power to the second season, the former Beatles drummer appears in episode 31 as Marge's once-upon-a-time art muse. When Homer is looking for his athletic gear in the attic—after deciding he’s going on a diet when he gets stuck in a tube slide during a trip to Mount Splashmore — he comes across several portraits of Starr painted by Marge. Lisa becomes interested in her mother's hidden talent, which sends Marge back in time, recalling how she sent her paintings to Starr a long time ago but never received a response. When Marge is encouraged to pick up painting again, the episode travels to England where we see Starr responding to fan mail seemingly from decades past. He picks up Marge's package out of the pack and finds her paintings. Impressed by her work, he sends a letter to Marge thanking her for her \"fab\" painting, which he \"hung on me wall.\"\n\nSeason 3\n\nEpisode 1—Michael Jackson and Kipp Lennon: \"Stark Raving Dad\"\n\nEpisode 10—Aerosmith: \"Flaming Moe's\"\n\nEpisode 13—Sting: \"Radio Bart\"\n\nEpisode 17—Terry Cashman: \"Homer At The Bat\"\n\nEpisode 20—Beverly D'Angelo: \"Colonel Homer\"\n\nEpisode 22—Spinal Tap: \"The Otto Show\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiaWwjZS50s' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn the season opener, Michael Jackson guest stars as the voice of an institutionalized man: Leon Kompowsky of New Jersey, who looks nothing like the real Jackson but claims to be the King Of Pop. Due to contractual obligations with his label at the time, Jackson couldn’t sing the songs in the episode, including \"Happy Birthday Lisa,\" which Jackson wrote, so the singing parts were done by musician Kipp Lennon, a founding member of the folk/rock band Venice.\n\n\"Singing for the Simpsons over the years has always been a pleasure and a joy,\" Lennon tells the Recording Academy. \"I always know that whatever they are calling me for it’s going to be clever and fun... It's quite a legacy to be a part of... a true icon of American pop culture that set the bar so very high indeed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Aerosmith make their \"Simpsons\" debut in episode 10 as the featured musical guest at the grand reopening of \"Flaming Moe's,\" where the famous Moe joins them onstage for a rendition of \"Walk This Way.\"\n\nSting appears in episode 13 as part of a campaign to raise awareness about a young boy who had allegedly fallen down a well in Springfield. However, the audience knows that there really isn’t a boy in the well; instead, it’s Bart who throws a radio transmitter microphone down a well and tricks the town into thinking a little boy is stuck. In an ironic turn of events, Bart falls down the well and Sting helps dig him out.\n\nLater, in \"The Otto Show\" episode, Bart attends a concert by Spinal Tap—a parody band who appeared in the 1984 mockumentary film This Is Spinal Tap—and decides he wants to be a rock star. The episode guest stars Harry Shearer, a regular \"Simpsons\" cast member who reprises his role as Derek Smalls from This Is Spinal Tap.\n\nSeason 4\n\nEpisode 7—Tom Jones: \"Marge Gets A Job\"\n\nEpisode 9—Linda Ronstadt: \"Mr. Plow\"\n\nEpisode 20—Barry White: \"Whacking Day\"\n\nEpisode 21—David Crosby: \"Marge In Chains\"\n\nEpisode 22—Barry White, Bette Midler and Red Hot Chili Peppers: \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCl-HXllGI0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nSeason four features an episode that fans and critics would go on to name one of the best in the animated series' history: \"Mr. Plow.\" In the episode, Homer starts a snowplow business and calls it \"Mr. Plow.\" In an attempt to get more customers, he creates a commercial to advertise his new business. When Barney sees how successful he is, he starts his own snowplow business, getting an even bigger snowplow and creating his own commercial, which features a jingle sung by Linda Rondstadt.\n\nBarry White appears as the Grand Marshall for \"Whacking Day\"— a day created to drive snakes into the town's square and club them to death. David Crosby appears in episode 12 as the 12-step sponsor for Lionel Hutz; the episode references the Crosby, Stills And Nash song \"Teach Your Children,\" when Crosby tells Hutz \"and know that I love you.\"\n\nEpisode 22 features an all-star cast including White, Bettle Midler and Red Hot Chili Peppers, who come together to perform on Krusty's comeback special. It features the Red Hot Chili Peppers singing \"Give It Away\" in their underwear, and Krusty and Midler singing \"Wind Beneath My Wings.\"\n\nSeason 5\n\nEpisode 1—David Crosby, George Harrison and the Dapper Dans: \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\"\n\nEpisode 4—The Ramones: \"Rosebud\"\n\nEpisode 7—James Brown: \"Bart's Inner Child\"\n\nEpisode 10—Robert Goulet: \"$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)\"\n\nEpisode 15—James Taylor: \"Deep Space Homer\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/xChORIKcAcg' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn episode one of season five, viewers are reminded that Homer once had a promising career as a member of The Be Sharps, whose hit song \"Baby On Board\" won a fictitious GRAMMY. In a flashback, Homer meets George Harrison at the GRAMMY after-party, and David Crosby presents The Be Sharps with their GRAMMY. The Be Sharps end up reuniting for a performance at Moe's Tavern, with the signing voices provided by the Dapper Dans.\n\nOne of the most memorable episodes of season five is episode four, which featured The Ramones performing at Mr. Burns' birthday party. After the band sings happy birthday to Mr. Burns, which ends with them saying \"go to hell you old bastard,\" Mr. Burns, mistaking the Ramones for the Rolling Stones, orders Smithers to \"have the Rolling Stones killed.\"\n\nJames Brown appears in episode seven of the show for a performance of his 1965 song \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" at the Do What You Feel festival. GRAMMY winner James Taylor appears in episode 15 to serenade Homer and fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon on their space shuttle mission.\n\nSeason 6\n\nEpisode 22—Ron Taylor: \"Round Springfield\"\n\nEpisode 25—Tito Puente: \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/p9kdDet7G14' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn episode 22, Ron Taylor reprises his role as \"Bleeding Gums\" Murphy and lends his saxophone to Lisa for a school recital when she bumps into him at a hospital. Before Lisa could return the sax, \"Bleeding Gums\" dies. Lisa is the only one to attend his funeral and vows to make sure everyone in Springfield knows who \"Bleeding Gums\" Murphy is.\n\nIn the final episode of the season—part one of the two-parter \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\"—Lisa convinces Principal Skinner to hire Tito Puente as a music teacher, but Puente quickly loses his job when the school loses an oil opportunity to Mr. Burns. Puente would appear again in part two of \"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\"\n\nSeason 7\n\nEpisode 1—Tito Puente: \"Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)\"\n\nEpisode 5—Paul & Linda McCartney: \"Lisa The Vegetarian\"\n\nEpisode 6—Paul Anka: \"Treehouse Of Horror VI\"\n\nEpisode 24—Cypress Hill, Peter Frampton, Smashing Pumpkins and Sonic Youth: \"Homerpalooza\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wwFfkyZg3RA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nThe highlight of season seven is an episode that many \"Simpsons\" fans consider to be their favorite: \"Homerpalooza.\" In the episode, Homer, in an attempt to prove to Bart and Lisa how cool he is, takes them to the Hullabalooza music festival where he’s hired as a sideshow freak who can withstand the force of a cannonball blast. The episode features appearances by Cypress Hill, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth and Peter Frampton, who Homer upsets when he accidently sends Frampton's stage prop (an inflatable pig he apparently purchased at a Roger Waters yard sale) flying into the air.\n\nRecalling when he received the phone call from \"The Simpsons\" crew asking him to be on the show, Frampton remembers saying, \"I think you want me to play the old, crusty rock star that’s done everything, been there and is a little bit fed up with everything, and [the crew] said, 'nailed it.'\"\n\nBut for his part on \"The Simpsons,\" Frampton didn’t simply read his lines, he also contributed to the story by adding one of his own. As Homer gets ready to be shot in the belly with a canon, Frampton walks by and quips, \"25 years in this business and I’ve never seen anything like it.\"\n\nAs far as being \"Simpson-ized,\" a.k.a. drawn like a \"Simpsons\" character, Frampton recalls that seeing himself as that way was iconic. The legendary guitarist even has a backstage pass of his character hanging from his speaker in his music room. \"I'm very proud of it,\" he adds. \"It's like getting a GRAMMY.\n\nSeason 8\n\nEpisode 2—Sally Stevens: \"You Only Move Twice\"\n\nEpisode 3—Sally Stevens: \"The Homer They Fall\"\n\nEpisode 9—Johnny Cash: \"El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/H3CyMWS7YXA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn episode nine of season eight of \"The Simpsons,\" Homer eats several hot chili peppers and hallucinates, leading him on a mysterious voyage where he meets the \"Space Coyote,\" played by Johnny Cash.\n\nSeason 9\n\nEpisode 15—Hank Williams, Jr.: \"The Last Temptation Of Krust\"\n\nEpisode 22—U2: \"Trash Of The Titans\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5JAd8-qqNI' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn season nine, Hank Williams, Jr. sings the song \"Canyonero,\" which was used in a commercial for the SUV of the same name.\n\nIn the \"Trash of the Titans\" episode, Homer runs for the position of Springfield's Sanitation Commissioner, but his campaign gets off to a bad start when he's beaten up after interrupting U2's PopMart Tour concert by inserting himself on the stage screens to promote his campaign.\n\nSeason 10\n\nEpisode 6—Yo La Tengo: \"D'oh-in In The Wind\"\n\nEpisode 10—The Moody Blues: \"Viva Ned Flanders\"\n\nEpisode 11—Cyndi Lauper: \"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\"\n\nEpisode 12—Dolly Parton: \"Sunday, Cruddy Sunday\"\n\nEpisode 14—Elton John: \"I'm With Cupid\"\n\nEpisode 15—Hank Williams, Jr.: \"Marge Simpson in: Screaming Yellow Honkers\"\n\nEpisode 20—NRBQ: \"The Old Man And The 'C' Student\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Di1h6Pha2fY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIn a star-stacked season, \"The Simpsons\" welcomed musical guests for six episodes of season 10, including Elton John, who ends up at the Springfield airport when the chandelier on his private jet needs repairing and leads to an emergency landing.
