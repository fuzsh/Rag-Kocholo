        "text": "\"Holes\"\n\n(PG, — hour, 51 minutes)\n\n\"Holes\" spins a yarn whose strands are both dark and light, funny and tragic, realistic and magical. Director Andrew Davis has a fine cast and an engaging story (by Louis Sachar, based on his novel), but he's not graceful at weaving together its disparate elements. The movie is ungainly, but fascinating. \"Holes\" may be too intense for kids under 10, despite the PG rating. It shows kids receiving ill treatment at a reform camp, creepy killer lizards, a rattlesnake, fights and harsh (not profane) language. A 19th-century story, told in flashbacks, includes a racist lynch mob.\n\nYoung Stanley Yelnats (Shia LaBeouf) is caught with a sports star's stolen shoes and sent to a reform camp in the middle of the Texas desert. He makes uneasy peace with the other boys while they dig holes in the ground (to build character). Jon Voight is terrific as their beady-eyed watchdog. He, the boys' counselor (Tim Blake Nelson) and the Warden (Sigourney Weaver), have reasons for those holes.\n\nStanley has grown up hearing from his hapless father (Henry Winkler) that Yelnats men have been cursed since leaving the Old Country. Flashbacks recount that legend and the story of a schoolmarm (Patricia Arquette) and an African American onion grower (Dule Hill) who fell afoul of local racists in the old Western town where the reform camp now sits.\n\nP.S. FOR TEENS \"Holes\" gets a little of its style from a classic movie, \"Cool Hand Luke\" (unrated, 1967), starring Paul Newman, about a convict on a prison farm who refuses to cooperate with the cruel warden. It's a tough story, more for teens.\n\n\"Chasing Papi\"\n\n(PG, — hour, 20 minutes)\n\nHollywood makes so few films about Latinos that \"Chasing Papi,\" a take on the romantic war-between-men-and-women theme, will surely disappoint those yearning for weightier stuff. This painful comedy, with cutesy cartoon transitions between scenes, makes the broadest TV sitcoms look like classical theater. It contains mild sexual innuendo and shows a character passed out from tranquilizers and liquor.\n\nSpoiled rich girl Patricia (Jaci Velasquez), prim lawyer Lorena (Roselyn Sanchez) and poor-but-tempestuous Cici (Sofia Vergara) live in different cities but discover they share a boyfriend when they all show up in L.A. to surprise him. Papi (Eduardo Verastegui) claims he loves them all and can't choose. Though \"Chasing Papi\" stays in PG territory, its likely audience -- teenage girls -- will see vain, unthinking heroines in skintight outfits living unreal lives.\n\n\"A Mighty Wind\"\n\n(PG-13, — hour, 27 minutes)\n\nIt's hard to imagine teens loving Christopher Guest's latest satire of American culture, dead-on though it is. They might have enjoyed his hilarious spoof of the dog-show set (\"Best in Show,\" PG-13, 2000) or his wicked sendup of amateur theatricals (\"Waiting for Guffman,\" R, 1997). But \"A Mighty Wind\" takes on the distant folk music craze of the 1960s and white-bread groups like the Kingston Trio.\n\nGuest casts his usual troupe of brilliant improvisational actors in a where-are-they-now tale about faded (fictional) folksters gathering for a reunion concert. From the overmedicated Mitch (Eugene Levy) of the duo Mitch & Mickey (Catherine O'Hara) to the likably bland Folksmen (Guest, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean), \"A Mighty Wind\" is merciless yet fond. It contains profanity, mild sexual innuendo and drug references.\n\n\"Malibu's Most Wanted\"\n\n(PG-13, — hour, 20 minutes)\n\nA likable comedy about race, class and hip-hop culture that scores points without cruelty, \"Malibu's Most Wanted\" will earn big laughs from high-schoolers. Though rated PG-13, it's a tad potty-mouthed for middle-schoolers, who should get a parental OK. The misogynistic B-word peppers the dialogue. The film also includes muted racial insults, bloodless gunplay, fights, toilet humor and sexual innuendo.\n\nJamie Kennedy expands on his popular TV sketch character B-Rad, a rich Malibu kid who acts like he's from the 'hood. He's a lousy rapper, but sincere in his identification with African-American youth culture. His dad (Ryan O'Neal) is a big politico whose campaign manager (Blair Underwood) hires two prissy actors (funny Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson) to act like gangstas, kidnap B-Rad and scare him white.\n\nBEYOND THE RATINGS GAME\n\n10 AND OLDER\n\n\"Holes\"\n\nFascinating but ungainly film based on Louis Sachar's novel, about a boy (Shia LaBeouf) wrongly sentenced to reform camp, where he's forced to dig holes; he ponders his family's legendary curse, bonds with other boys and senses the warden (Sigourney Weaver) and her men (Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson) are scoundrels. Kids shown ill-treated, lost in desert; killer lizards, rattlesnake; fights; harsh language; subplot about 19th-century racist crime.\n\n\"Chasing Papi\"\n\nBroadly sitcomish, exceedingly retro romantic farce about three Latinas (Jaci Velasquez, Roselyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara) from different cities discover they're all dating the same three-timing guy (Eduardo Verastegui), leading to jealous silliness. Relatively mild sexual innuendo; one character passes out from mixing pills and liquor.\n\n\"What a Girl Wants\"\n\nStunningly superficial romantic fantasy will divert girls 10 to 13. Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes as plastic-perky Daphne, a New York girl who sets off for London to meet the English lord (Colin Firth, wonderful even in this) who is her long-lost father; with Kelly Preston as her wedding singer mom, Anna Chancellor and Christina Cole as his snarky fiancee and stepdaughter-to-be. Mild sexual innuendo.\n\nPG-13s, PLUS A PG MORE FOR TEENS\n\n\"The Guys\"\n\nSigourney Weaver, Anthony LaPaglia in poignant, low-key, cathartic drama (based on Anne Nelson's play) about New York writer who helps fire captain write eulogies for men he lost on 9/11. No World Trade Center footage except for a video of papers blowing by a firehouse when the first plane hit. Too slow, sad for preteens.\n\n\"Anger Management\"\n\nAdam Sandler, Jack Nicholson as patient and anger management therapist in clever, sometimes antic, sometimes crude comedy about milquetoast who learns to express anger; with Marisa Tomei as supportive girlfriend. Near-graphic verbal sexual innuendo; jokes about mentally ill child; tasteless remark about \"molesting a crazy girl\"; penis jokes; toilet humor; profanity. Not for middle-schoolers.\n\n\"Bend It Like Beckham\" (LIMITED RELEASE)\n\nFresh, droll British comedy about teen daughter of traditional Indian family in London who longs to play soccer, idolizes British star player David Beckham and sneaks out to games with non-Indian pals because her family deems it unladylike; predictable but invigorating film portrays family fondly. Mild sexual situation; occasional crude language.\n\n\"Head of State\"\n\nChris Rock in improbable but hilarious spoof (he co-wrote and directed) as Washington alderman picked for cynical reasons to be presidential candidate of major party; becomes populist hero with attitude, funny Bernie Mac as his brother and running mate. Some profanity; sexual innuendo; comic assassination images may disturb unironic younger teens. Not for middle-schoolers.)\n\nR's\n\n\"The Good Thief\" (NEW; LIMITED RELEASE)\n\nNick Nolte shambles charmingly as down-at-heels, heroin-addicted gambler-thief on French Riviera, aiming to change his luck with one last heist. Sly, darkly moody, neatly played, occasionally soporific caper is based by writer-director Neil Jordan on 1955 French flick \"Bob Le Flambeur.\" Occasional violence; strong sexual innuendo, less graphic sexual situations; nudity; drug use, drinking, smoking; profanity. World cinema buffs 16 and older.\n\n\"Phone Booth\"\n\nColin Farrell in short, skillful, sometimes unbearably suspenseful mini-thriller as cocky, mendacious Manhattan publicist held prisoner in phone booth by sniper (voice of Kiefer Sutherland) who keeps him on the line, threatening bloody comeuppance via telescopic sight; Forest Whitaker as brave policeman. Brief gun violence; strong profanity, sexual innuendo. 16 and older.\n\n\"A Man Apart\"\n\nFormulaic cops-and-drug-dealers thriller is slickly made to mask Vin Diesel's limited emotional range as DEA agent who breaks rules to find Mexican drug lord who ordered hit that killed his wife. Violence escalates to bloodbath shoot-outs, head-bashing; mutilated bodies; topless dancing; strong profanity. 17 and up.\n\nJane Horwitz belongs to the Washington Post Writers Group.\n\nThis story appeared on Page C7 of The Standard-Times on April 19, 2003."
