        "text": "Wales striker Kieffer Moore has signed for Sheffield United on a permanent transfer.\n\nThe 31-year-old has become the Blades' third signing of the summer after an undisclosed fee was agreed with Bournemouth. He joins Chris Wilder's side on a three-year deal.\n\nMoore, who has 43 caps for Wales, spent the second half of last season on loan at Ipswich Town and helped fire the Tractor Boys back to the top flight with seven goals in 18 appearances. The striker's new side will be hoping for more of the same, having been relegated to the Championship after finishing rock bottom of the Premier League last campaign.\n\nREAD MORE: Stoke City win race to sign Cardiff City starlet with famous brother\n\nREAD MORE: Lamine Yamal has ex-Swansea City flop to think about after starring in Spainâ€™s Euros glory\n\nThe Welshman's move to Bramall Lane comes after a dramatic late U-turn, however, with Moore looking set to join Championshiop rivals Hull City before the Blades swooped in to complete the transfer. According to HullLive, the forward had been expected to join the Tigers at their pre-season camp in Turkey as recently as Friday before the change of heart.\n\nThe publication reports that Moore's family is based in Sheffield and his wife is due to give birth imminently, leading him to change his mind and sign for Wilder's side. The former Cardiff striker is familiar with South Yorkshire having also previously represented Rotherham and Barnsley earlier in his career.\n\nAfter his signing was confirmed, Moore said: \"Everything fits perfectly in what I want from a club and their ambition matches mine. When you get a chance to join a great club like this, you always want to take that opportunity.\n\n\"I'm very familiar with the area and it is always nice to come back to places where you've experienced success, it will help me settle in as well. I have fond memories of both Rotherham and Barnsley, so for me to come back to the area is something I'm looking forward to.\n\n\"I'll buy into everything the gaffer says, we've had some good conversations already and although these decisions take some thinking about, once I spoke to the manager I made my decision.\n\nHe added: \"I've always wanted to be somewhere where I'm playing regularly, so not doing that at Bournemouth was hard, last season I wanted to go and make an impact by playing some football and thankfully I had a fantastic time with Ipswich. I want to bring that experience and knowhow to the group and add to what is already here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, boss Wilder said: \"I have been an admirer of Kieffer's abilities for some time, and our persistence and hard work on this deal has paid off. There was a real desire from all parties to get this done and I am thrilled to have Kieffer as part of our project going forward.\n\n\"He's well known to the staff here, especially Alan Knill and Jack Lester who have worked with him at close quarters with Wales. Kieffer has all the tools required to succeed as a Blade. He's strong and robust but also athletic for a player of his size and his goal record at this level over the years is impressive.\n\n\"You don't have to look far to see his impact in this division. His goals helped Bournemouth and most recently Ipswich to the Premier League. He is a proven operator whose experience will complement some of the young strikers coming through here.\""
