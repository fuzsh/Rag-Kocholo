Have an account? .\n\n\"Daisy Jones & The Six\" premiered on Prime Video on March 3.\n\nThe show focuses on the rise and fall of the fictional band of the same name.\n\nThey're not the only band from movies or TV that we wish we could listen to all the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaisy Jones & The Six, the band from the Prime Video series of the same name, were inspired by Fleetwood Mac.\n\nOriginally appearing in the Taylor Jenkins Reid novel of the same name, Daisy Jones & The Six were, in the author's own words, inspired by her obsession with the ever-changing dynamics inside Fleetwood Mac.\n\nInside the world of the novel (and show), Daisy Jones & The Six were one of the biggest rock bands of the '70s, who mysteriously disbanded at the peak of their success after a sold-out show in Chicago. Twenty years later, the band has agreed to finally share the story behind their success (and downfall).\n\nTwo songs by the band were released before the show's premiere on March 3, 2023, and it's easy to believe that this group briefly took over the world — and could have had a decades-long career, if other things hadn't gotten in the way.\n\nListen to \"Regret Me\" and \"Look at Us Now (Honeycomb)\" here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople are still listening to Josie and the Pussycats' songs 20 years after the 2001 movie.\n\n\"Josie and the Pussycats\" might've been a huge flop at the time of its release in 2001, but in the two decades since, it's become a true cult classic. A huge part of that is due to the music, with production by Babyface, lyrics by Adam Schlesinger, Adam Duritz, and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's, and lead vocals by Kay Hanley, the lead singer of Letters to Cleo.\n\nAdd those all-stars to a cast consisting of Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson, and you have a girl group that rocks hard enough that people are still listening to \"3 Small Words\" and \"Pretend to Be Nice\" to this day.\n\nHonorable mentions to Du Jour, the boy band also featured in the film, and the version of Josie and the Pussycats that appears in \"Riverdale.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPink Slip from \"Freaky Friday\" only performed two songs in the movie and both slap.\n\nPart of the comedy in the 2003 body-swap film \"Freaky Friday\" is watching Jamie Lee Curtis as Anna in her mother Tess' body totally shred a guitar solo during a battle of the bands, while Lindsay Lohan (usually a very convincing rocker chick) as Tess in her daughter Anna's body looks completely clueless. You can watch the scene, and their performance of \"Take Me Away\" here.\n\nHowever, it's their final performance at Tess' wedding — where Lohan finally gets to let loose while performing \"Ultimate\" — that makes Pink Slip a band we sincerely wish existed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oneders (later The Wonders) from \"That Thing You Do!\" were very convincing one-hit wonders.\n\n\"That Thing You Do!\" is about a fictional '60s band called The Oneders (later The Wonders) as they rise up from local talent shows to playing on national television, all off the success of their hit single \"That Thing You Do.\"\n\nIt's hard enough to write a real one-hit wonder, so writing one for a fictional band in a movie could've been an impossible task, but Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne and the \"Josie and the Pussycats\" soundtrack) was able to make it sound easy. Somehow, you never get sick of \"That Thing You Do,\" even though you hear it over and over again in the film.\n\nListen to \"That Thing You Do\" here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJackson Maine and Ally's chemistry while creating music together in \"A Star Is Born\" made us all wish they were real.\n\nWhen you have a real-life iconic musician like Lady Gaga writing and performing the music, you know it's going to be good. But Bradley Cooper wasn't a musician before he signed on to star and direct \"A Star Is Born,\" and he spent years training his voice and learning how to play guitar before taking on the role of Jackson Maine, an old-school rock star.\n\nBoth Ally and Jackson have solo music that's included on the film's soundtrack that we're into, but nothing beats their show-stopping collaboration \"Shallow,\" which won an Oscar, Grammy, Golden Globe, and was a No. 1 hit.\n\nListen to \"Shallow,\" Jackson's song \"Maybe It's Time,\" and Ally's song \"Look What I Found\" here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStillwater were believably on the cusp of stardom in \"Almost Famous.\"\n\n\"Almost Famous\" is loosely based on writer and director Cameron Crowe's teenage life as a music journalist and rock critic for Rolling Stone. In the film, teenager William Miller successfully convinces Rolling Stone he's an adult, and the magazine sends him on tour with fictional band Stillwater, led by Russell Hammond (played by Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (played by Jason Lee).\n\nWe don't see too much of Stillwater actually performing (save \"Fever Dog,\" which was written by Crowe's then-wife Nancy Wilson of the band Heart), but the sheer charisma of Russell makes us wish he was a real rock star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blues Brothers, who originally debuted on \"Saturday Night Live,\" have actually put out multiple albums.\n\nThe Blues Brothers originally consisted of Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) and Jake Blues (John Belushi), two brothers who exclusively played the blues and wore fedoras, suits, and black sunglasses. They made their debut on a 1978 episode of \"SNL\" as the musical guests.\n\nThe Blues Brothers proved to be so popular that they released an album that same year, \"Briefcase Full of Blues,\" which hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nTwo years later, a film starring the two, \"The Blues Brothers,\" was released and became a huge hit. Unfortunately, Belushi died of a drug overdose two years later, in 1982, ending the original Blues Brothers lineup.\n\nThe band has continued without Jake/Belushi, including a (critically hated) sequel \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" but it's not the same.\n\nWatch the Blues Brothers on \"SNL\" here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox\" story is one of the best musical biopics of all time, period.\n\nIt's hard, in a post-\"Walk Hard\" world, to watch any musician's biopic without thinking of Dewey Cox and his life story. The film skewers every single cliché of the genre, from the tragic backstory, to the gratuitous cameos from other musical legends, to the very dramatic drug-and-alcohol problem.\n\nBut the best thing about Dewey Cox is the music. \"Walk Hard,\" \"Beautiful Ride,\" and \"Let's Duet\" are all classics in their own right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dreams, from both the musical and movie \"Dreamgirls,\" seem to be heavily inspired by The Supremes — except with Beyoncé, Jennifer Hudson, and Anika Noni Rose.\n\n\"Dreamgirls\" was a Broadway musical before getting a big-screen adaptation in 2006.\n\nIt's impossible to not draw the comparison between The Dreams and the real Motown group The Supremes, which is where Donna Summer got her start. The lead of The Dreams is named Deena, for example.\n\nThe soundtrack was produced by R&B duo The Underdogs, and it even had an entirely new song written and performed by Beyoncé called \"Listen\" — how could it not be a classic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,\" Scott plays in the humorously named Sex Bob-Omb.\n\nLike any Edgar Wright movie, music plays a huge part in \"Scott Pilgrim,\" which means that Scott's band Sex Bob-Omb, as an indie (literal) garage band, the music isn't exactly great, but it's a pitch-perfect spoof of the genre. Just listen to \"We Are Sex Bob-Omb,\" which opens the movie.\n\nShout out to Brie Larson as pop star Envy Adams, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBands full of elementary school students don't usually rock, but The School of Rock does.\n\nIn \"School of Rock,\" Dewey Finn (played by Jack Black) pretends to be a substitute teacher in order to teach a class of pre-teens how to be a convincing enough rock band to win a battle of the bands to get revenge on his old band, No Vacancy.\n\nIt might sound implausible, but \"School of Rock\" pulls it off — and the class, which names their band The School of Rock, is actually talented. If they existed in real life, at the very least, they'd go viral on TikTok.\n\nHere's the band performing \"Rock Got No Reason.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpinal Tap, from the mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" is perhaps the most famous fictional band of all time.\n\nAt the time of \"This Is Spinal Tap's\" release in 1984, there were plenty of people who came out of the film thinking that the band, Spinal Tap, was real, instead of a fictional group featuring comedians Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer — though real musicians like Atomic Rooster's RJ Parnell and Rare Bird's David Kaff filled out the roster.\n\n\"This Is Spinal Tap\" changed comedy forever when it was released, bringing the phrase \"this goes up to 11\" into the cultural lexicon.\n\nBut, really, their biggest contribution is \"Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPowerline from \"A Goofy Movie\" is voiced by real-life musician Tevin Campbell.\n\n'90s and 2000s kids can probably still sing Powerline's songs \"Stand Out\" and \"I2I\" (pronounced \"eye to eye\") from memory — that's how catchy the animated pop star's songs are. It helps that the real R&B singer Tevin Campbell was the voice behind the yellow jumpsuit. He's basically the Disney version of Prince.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Folksmen from \"A Mighty Wind\" are both hilarious and musically talented.\n\nLike Spinal Tap, The Folksmen are a Christopher Guest creation: \"A Mighty Wind\" skewers the folk-music scene like \"This Is Spinal Tap\" did with heavy metal.\n\nGuest again teamed up with Michael McKean and Harry Shearer to fill out The Folksmen, a folk trio clearly inspired by The Kingston Trio, down to their similar album cover art.\n\nJust listen to them perform \"Old Joe's Place\" and try not to clap along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Eddie and the Cruisers\" might've been a box-office flop, but the band of the same name had a top-10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1983.\n\n\"Eddie and the Cruisers\" might be the least popular movie on this list, but the fictional band of the same name might be one of the most commercially successful. The film is somewhat similar to \"Daisy Jones & the Six's\" story: A band who mysteriously broke up at the peak of their powers reunites decades later to reveal what actually happened.\n\nThe band's song \"On the Dark Side\" (which was actually performed by John Cafferty & the Beaver Brown Band), is a very convincing Bruce Springsteen dupe, and much like the real Boss' music, it performed well on the charts.\n\n\"On the Dark Side\" peaked at No. 7 on the Hot 100 in the '80s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of \"Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping\" is about the solo career of Conner4Real, but the film's climax reunites him with his two childhood friends, The Style Boyz.\n\nConceived in the aftermath of musical documentaries like \"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\" and \"One Direction: This Is Us,\" \"Popstar\" features The Lonely Island as a former rap trio, The Style Boyz, who broke up after tensions rose between Conner (Andy Samberg) and Lawrence (Akiva Schaffer).\n\nMost of the film's original music is actually Conner's during his solo career as Conner4Real. But even though songs like \"I'm So Humble,\" \"Equal Rights,\" \"Finest Girl (Bin Laden Song),\" and \"Mona Lisa\" are catchy, they're purposefully terrible.\n\nWe prefer the incomprehensible, fake-deep lyrics of \"Incredible Thoughts\" and the features from Michael Bolton and Justin Timberlake when The Style Boyz reunite at the end. Everybody do the donkey roll!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAldous Snow, played by Russell Brand, made his debut in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" before getting an entire movie about his band, Infant Sorrow, in \"Get Him to The Greek.\"\n\nAldous, the lead singer of Infant Sorrow, is introduced to audiences in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" as the new rock-star boyfriend of Kristen Bell's character Sarah Marshall. One of the film's most memorable scenes is when he serenades Sarah with a new song called \"Inside of You,\" cheered on by an enthusiastic fan played by Jonah Hill.\n\nBrand and Hill's chemistry was so strong, and Aldous was such a scene-stealer that, a few years later, a spin-off focusing on Aldous called \"Get Him to the Greek\" was released, with Hill playing a new character (but still an Infant Sorrow super-fan).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hex Girls, from various \"Scooby Doo\" cartoons, remain the ultimate coolest, witchiest animated band of all time.\n\nListen to these three songs by The Hex Girls and try to deny the power of these eco-goth semi-witches that the teens of Mystery, Inc. encounter: \"I'm a Hex Girl,\" \"Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air,\" and \"Trap of Love.\"\n\nHow could any band with Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's and accomplished voice actors Kimberly Brooks and Jennifer Hale be less than iconic?\n\nThe Hex Girls were so popular upon their debut in 1998 that they've popped up in numerous \"Scooby Doo\" shows over the years, and they were potentially going to get their own spin-off. They have also been claimed as \"cult, queer, girl-power icons,\" according to The Independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual Chocolate is at the center of one of the funniest scenes in \"Coming to America.\"\n\nRandy Watson, the lead singer of Sexual Chocolate, is one of the multiple roles Eddie Murphy plays in the '80s comedy classic \"Coming to America.\"\n\nIt's impossible to watch the band's cover of Whitney Houston's \"Greatest Love of All\" and keep a straight face. Randy's return in \"Coming 2 America\" was one of the best parts of the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cantina Band in \"Star Wars\" are so weird, even for \"Star Wars,\" that they've remained iconic for decades.\n\nThere's really nothing to say other than listen to their song from \"A New Hope.\" It'll get stuck in your head for the rest of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHugh Grant and Scott Porter give it their all as PoP! in \"Music and Lyrics.\"\n\nEven though PoP! is a purposefully cheesy '80s duo, it doesn't mean that their big hit, \"PoP! Goes My Heart,\" isn't a tune. It helps that it was written by Andrew Wyatt of Miike Snow.\n\nThe rest of the music in \"Music and Lyrics\" is also much better than it has any right to be, including Hugh Grant's character Alex Fletcher's solo music, much of it written by Adam Schlesinger. He wrote the film's big song, \"Way Back Into Love.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMove over Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, we're all into 4*Town from \"Turning Red\" now.\n\n4*Town consists of the voices of Jordan Fisher, Finneas O'Connell (aka FINNEAS), Josh Levi, Topher Ngo, and Grayson Villanueva. Their music provides much of the soundtrack for \"Turning Red,\" as the main character Mei and her friends are totally obsessed with the boy band.\n\nIf you needed any other reason to check out 4*Town's songs \"Nobody Like U,\" \"1 True Love,\" and \"U Know What's Up,\" just know that O'Connell wrote the songs with his little sister, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe Stiff Dylans from \"Angus, Thongs, and Perfect Snogging\" had one thing going for them that no other band does: Aaron Taylor-Johnson as frontman.\n\n\"Ultraviolet\" is a mid-2000s classic. The Stiff Dylans actually became a real band due to the movie, albeit without Taylor-Johnson at the helm, but they never released more music. But their renditions of \"Ever Fallen in Love\" and \"Out of Time\" are featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\nWhen you buy through our links, Insider may earn an affiliate commission.
