        "meta_description": "Christopher Guest’s fake documentaries about music are marketed as entertainment but they also raise serious questions about music history and the problem of authenticity. Working as a collaborative writer, director and actor in This is Spinal Tap (1984), Waiting for Guffman (1996) and A Mighty Wind (2003), Guest has recast the “discourses of sobriety” as deadpan comedy. In the process, he challenges the traditional fact/fiction dichotomy and claims to authenticity. With attention to folk, rock and community theater genres, this article focuses on Guest’s treatment of received narratives about music-making that are preoccupied by a quest for origins and a sense of home. The reality of such narratives is depicted as compromised, while performance, sometimes animated by a camp sensibility, offers a way forward.",

        "text": "The idea was, “Wouldn’t it be fun to do a movie where people got this right for a change?”\n\nHarry Shearer, aka bass player “Derek Smalls” of Spinal Tap (Muir 2004: 25)\n\nis less in the unassailable authenticity of the bond between image and referent than in the impression of authenticity it conveys to the viewer. Even if the indexicality is fabricated—as certain trompe l’œil techniques of set design, lighting, and perspective or the computer-based technique of digital sampling can do—the effect or the impression of authenticity can remain just as powerful (150).\n\nMock-documentary arguably provides the greatest challenge in terms of what documentary claims to be. It provides a direct contest to the truth claims made by documentary on the basis of the power of the image, and its referentiality. It takes up the ground of the reflexive and performative documentary, furthering the challenge to any assumed fact/fiction dichotomy, and extending the range of representational strategies available to filmmakers. It deliberately raises issues about the nature of representations and the claims which documentaries present (Roscoe & Hight 182).\n\nGuest and his Methods\n\n6Christopher Guest is a study in contrasts. Born in New York City in 1948, in his youth he knew folk music circles well, developed a keen interest in bluegrass, and as a teenager played music with Arlo Guthrie. His mother was an American of Russian Jewish origins and his father was a British diplomat who later became Baron Haden-Guest, a title that his son eventually inherited, thus making Guest the first (and almost certainly the last) American “folkie” to have a seat in the House of Lords (Grant 2004).\n\n8Of course, Guest did not invent this genre. Fake documentary goes back at least as far as Luis Buñuel’s Land Without Bread (Las Hurdes) (1933). Orson Welles famously spliced fake newsreel footage into Citizen Kane (1941). Even at this relatively early stage in film history, directors appropriated formal devices of journalism in order to enhance an entertainment medium with an ersatz facticity. Generic borders were permeable. This was, after all, an era when Leni Riefenstahl’s documentaries tested the limits of aestheticized reporting (Sontag 1980: 73-105). The Moffitt Library Archive at the University of California at Berkeley houses more than sixty “Fake and Mock Documentaries: Documentary Parodies, Hoaxes and Appropriations,” and the total grows if one also includes “Shockumentaries, Mondo Films, and Exploitation Ethnography.” It is a subject rich in epistemological nuance, but it is safe to say that Guest is working within a tradition.\n\nNever Mind the Authenticity, or the Quest for Home\n\n16Waiting for Guffman traces another kind of trajectory. In the literal sense, the residents of Blaine, Missouri, are already home, and their musical production celebrates that fact: the sesquicentennial of the founding of the town and the dramatization of its history, notably its rise as a “stool capital” of America and a visit by extraterrestrials. Their show, “Red, White and Blaine,” is an exercise in entertainment as local boosterism. But, emerging out of this history is another one: the cast members’ collective dream that their performance will impress New York theater impresario Mort Guffman, who will then take the show to Broadway. It is an absurd dream, but it repeats a received narrative of musical theater — the discovery of provincials and their launch on a bigger stage — which has been told countless times, perhaps most famously in the Hollywood adaptation of the musical Babes In Arms (Berkeley 1939), in which Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland put on a show in a barn in their home town and are discovered by a big-time producer.\n\n19In Guest’s retelling, folk music’s attachment to continuity is depicted as positively paralyzing. The performers in A Mighty Wind forever repeat the same formula, even as the world has left them behind. They embody a wind whose might was spent long ago. The only character who seems to grasp this is the mentally unstable Mitch, who announces, “There’s a deception here.” In comparison, the stylistic promiscuity of Spinal Tap or the naïve dreaming of Blaine’s community theater at least display a readiness to experiment, an openness to alternatives. But the folk mission to preserve is here shown as an exercise in complacency.\n\n20Thus, in each of these films, Guest challenges key assumptions about musical authenticity. For Spinal Tap, there is no going back. For the Blaine Community Players, there is no getting out. And for the folk performers of A Mighty Wind, there is no standing still.\n\nLife after Authenticity, or the Process of Reinvention\n\n21So, it could seem, the characters in these fake documentaries are trapped in their own contradictions. The received narratives of authenticity that they have embraced are shown to be false. One can ask: after these acts of debunking, what next? Where does Guest leave the viewer?\n\n22A preliminary answer can be found by returning to Gates’ aforementioned essay, “The Lesson of Little Tree.” Although Gates’ main focus is on the written word, his observations can also be applied to documentary film. The title of his essay refers to a 1976 bestseller, The Education of Little Tree, which was supposedly the memoir of a ten-year-old orphan who learned the ways of his Native American ancestors from his Cherokee grandparents (Carter 1976). It was critically acclaimed by book critics and endorsed by some Native Americans as an inspiring book, attuned to nature and history, and it was recommended for schoolchildren. Oprah Winfrey later touted it on her website. Eventually, though, it was revealed that the contents were actually fiction, and rather inconveniently written by Asa Earl Carter, a former Ku Klux Klan member and rabid anti-Semite, and probable ghostwriter of Alabama Governor George Wallace’s 1963 speech which is now largely remembered for the slogan “Segregation now … segregation tomorrow … segregation forever” (Gates 1991: 27). Seldom have the sentimental excesses related to the concept of authenticity been more starkly exposed.\n\n24I would argue that Christopher Guest’s musical trilogy embraces a similar attitude about fakes. Guest’s films suggest that even if a literalist authenticity is a conceptual dead-end, these fake entertainers still have something to tell us about the survival of their musical genres, by depicting a process of reinvention.\n\n25Many narratives about “authentic” music have involved an attempt to protect it. As Iain Chambers (1985) observed, “the most arbitrary distinctions [are] rapidly drawn up into fiercely patrolled aesthetic boundaries” (21). Material constraints inevitably come into play, too. Elizabeth Outka (2009) has described a problematic “commodified authentic” which Beth Bloom (2010) has summed up as “the paradox that while the commercialization of authenticity makes it accessible to the masses, its resistance to commodification is precisely what constitutes the authentic’s appeal” (150). Guest’s work shows a keen awareness of these issues as his fake musical groups repeatedly test the limits of aesthetic or material boundaries. In fact, this errancy proves crucial to their survival.\n\n26Spinal Tap cannot “go back” but This Is Spinal Tap rewrites the received (and sentimentalized) narrative of rock and roll roots with its merciless depiction of the importance of popularity. The group is nowhere if it is not on the charts. Only with an audience can Spinal Tap authenticate itself and, to underline the point, the film ends with a deus ex machina. Just when it seems that the disastrous American tour has destroyed the band, utterly and forever, news arrives that their album is climbing the charts in Japan. Thus, the surprise happy ending, which shows the lads from Squatney pumping out power chords to throngs of enthusiastic Asians. Spinal Tap has found a home — for now — in “Kobe Hall, Tokyo.” More than an unexpected twist or a parting joke, it is a lucid telling of the evolution of rock music, its historical resilience and phoenix-like ability to go global.\n\nIn naïve, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naïve (59).\n\n28Although one can question Sontag’s attachment to the “naïve and pure” (Ross 1999: 316), there are several layers of intentionality here: the Blaine players’ efforts, and Guest’s. “Red White and Blaine” takes itself very seriously indeed, and mixes the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the naïve. If Guffman was only satire, a film viewer’s judgment would be fairly simple — at times, indeed, the ridiculous depictions border on patronizing — but, on the other hand, it is entirely possible for a viewer to enjoy, for instance, the musical number about extraterrestrial visitation, “Nothing Ever Happens On Mars,” for different reasons from the fictional Blaine audience. The goofy lyrics and creaky special effects do not detract from the entertainment: on the contrary, they enhance it, and become a source of camp charm. This strategy allows Guest to negotiate the delicate problem of how to devote so much of his film to a performance that is unambiguously bad. The film’s epilogue, “Three Months Later,” further illustrates the distinction. Although some of the players have managed to get out of Blaine, literally (Corky has opened a shop in Manhattan, the Albertsons have gone to Los Angeles, Dr. Pearl to Miami Beach), they are as hapless as they ever were, but, at the same time, just as hopeful and pursuing their dreams in music. Guest seems to be suggesting that authenticity is less a passive inheritance (who you are) than an active process (what you do). It is performative.\n\n29In A Mighty Wind, some of the folk musicians manage to escape the ambient paralysis, and authenticate themselves, by acting on another level of interiority. This is an altogether different direction from the means used by Spinal Tap or the Blaine Community Players. At the end of Wind, for instance, Mark Shubb of the Folksmen (Harry Shearer) announces, “I came to a realization that I was, and am, a blonde female folksinger trapped in the body of a bald male folksinger, and I had to let me out or I would die.” Henceforth, he will perform as a woman, a change that the Folksmen must incorporate into their act. The bass-singing, cross-dressing Shubb is obviously another source of deadpan humor, but his transformation also underlines how much the Folksmen can change in order to stay true to who they think they are. The film also includes moments when the music itself effects the change. The old songs, if performed well, still retain the power to entertain and acquire new meanings, and this, in fact, can rescue folk music from irrelevance or complacency. Critic Tim Grierson (2004) describes one such moment between Mitch and Mickey, played by Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara, as they rehearse for the tribute concert.\n\nThis moment […] is shockingly poignant, natural, and blessedly free of easy laughs. Suddenly, the song takes on a sadness that was missing 35 years before. Rather than going for a potshot, Levy and O’Hara […] approach a melancholy and regret that is truly beautiful. His tentative playing and her nervous singing only bring out the heartache in the tune’s hope of a happily ever after. The song’s very title is a spoof on the hopelessly romantic ideal of most ballads. (And lines like ‘Though an ocean of tears divides us / Let the bridge of our love span the sea’ are priceless in their eye-rolling earnestness.) But the genius of this scene is how those clichéd words now carry so much meaning. When they reach the moment when they used to pause to kiss, there’s real, unexpected feeling (cited in Muir: 185).\n\nConclusion\n\n31The interest of Christopher Guest’s fake documentaries goes beyond their achievement as comic entertainment. These films engage in an ongoing conversation about music history. As Guest’s collaborator Harry Shearer remarked about the early stages of inventing Spinal Tap, “The idea was, wouldn’t it be fun to do a movie where people got this right for a change?” (Muir 2004: 25). From the beginning, there was always an intention to do more than make jokes about the characters, or simply tweak received narratives about passing fashions. There was an investment in documenting musical history, in “getting it right.”\n\n33Guest’s work implies a functional approach in which authenticity is less a passive cultural inheritance than an active process of self-invention. He has also helped to expand the possibilities of documentary form, by showing how the pleasures of entertainment and deadpan humor, mixed with music, do not compete with documentary’s discourses of sobriety as much as complement them. Just as there are many ways to tell a joke, there are many ways to be serious."
