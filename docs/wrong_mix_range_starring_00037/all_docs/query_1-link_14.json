        "text": "Harry Shearer, the voice of a bunch of characters on \"The Simpsons\" took to Twitter to say he's leaving the show.\n\nShearer, 71, has been with the show for all 26 seasons, starting in 1989.\n\nShearer provided the voices for neighbor Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, his assistant Smithers, and many minor characters.\n\nAltogether, he's voiced more than 100 Springfield citizens â more than 170, according to the website Simpsons Wiki. See them all below â¼\n\nShearer told CNN the dispute centers around his ability to continue doing outside work. But CNN Media Critic Brian Stelter says we shouldn't believe the headlines that say Shearer is already gone.\n\nStelter says what's underway is a negotiation of sorts between Shearer and the show's producers, and it's suddenly spilled into public view.\n\nWhen asked whether there's a chance he will continue on the show, shearer said, \"I think that's a question better posed to them.\"\n\nFox recently announced picking up \"The Simpsons\" for two more seasons - its 27th and 28th.\n\nA statement from \"Simpsons\" executive producers Al Jean, James L. Brooks and Matt Groening said Shearer \"was offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed.\"\n\nShearer did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe multi-tasking Shearer has charted a diverse career as an actor, writer, musician and producer, both before and since becoming part of the \"Simpsons\" troupe. Also known for his starring role in the 1984 mockumentary classic \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" as well as for hosting public radio's weekly \"Le Show\" for more than 30 years, he recently produced and starred in \"Nixon's The One,\" portraying President Richard Nixon in a TV dramatization of the secret White House tapes.\n\nThursday's public acknowledgement of the ongoing dispute, he tweeted, was prompted by word from the lawyer of \"Simpsons\" executive producer Brooks that declared, \"Show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best.\"\n\nShearer tweeted, \"Of course, I wish him the very best.\"\n\nInformation from CNN and The Associated Press was used in this report.\n\nThe many voices of Harry Shearer on 'The Simpsons'\n\nBy our count, Harry Shearer has voiced at least 172 different characters during all 26 seasons of \"The Simpsons.\" We used the website Simpsons Wiki to find them all.\n\n(Simpsons Wiki actually listed 183 roles for Shearer, but we did not count variations of the same character â for example, \"Devil Flanders\" is not counted separately below.)\n\nC.
