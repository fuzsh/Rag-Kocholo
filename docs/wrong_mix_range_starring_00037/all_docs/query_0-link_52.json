        "text": "Earl Sweatshirt’s music education and evolution, from 1. Growing up in Chicago, lying on his family’s Persian rug listening to jazz, African horns, and gospel music → 2. Being a dad now, watching his son learn rhythm → 3. Learning saxophone in elementary school → 4. Starting writing rap at 16 and also listening to music like Dr. Dre’s ‘Chronic 2001’ and Lil Wayne’s ‘Money on My Mind’ → 5. Visiting his dad in South Africa and starting to write music in earnest in his spare time → 6. Finding inspiration in J. Dilla’s book, Dilla Time. Earl Sweatshirt is the virtuosic byproduct of Los Angeles’ fertile ground where hip hop sowed its seeds and historic cultural movements were born. The prodigiously-gifted writer, lyricist and producer grew from a zeitgeist of which contemporary collectives in hip hop today are predicated. And while most movements are fleeting as soon as they arrive, Earl pushed forward, documented his growth and self-discovery on record and cemented himself as one of the foremost culturally relevant MC’s in the game, one who never strayed away too far from his Los Angeles beat-scene roots. His debut album Doris arrived in 2013 and introduced the world to a more realized vision from him than his seminal mixtape Earl that was released three years prior when he was just 16-years-old. He followed Doris with the critically-lauded I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside in 2015, further exploring the depth of his technical dexterity with more swagger than prior releases. Three years later, he released Some Rap Songs in 2018, the tightly wrought album that found a more self-aware and mature Earl in his reflection of being in the public eye since a teenager, coupled with the reconciliation of the death of his father. Enter Feet of Clay, the conceptual 2019 project that continues the written narrative of Earl’s life in today’s societal landscape and world-view in real-time. Fast forward to 2022; Earl returned to the scene with critically acclaimed, SICK!

Jack meeting his creative hero, Bobby McFerrin, and being inspired to think of his voice as his instrument → 3. Tenacious D being encouraged by Harry Shearer at an early concert → 4. Building a creative process based in acting. Jack Black and Kyle Gass make up the Greatest Band in the World: Tenacious D. The band had a variety series on HBO that aired in 1999. Their self-titled album was released in the fall of 2001 and has since been certified Platinum. The duo completed their first feature film together - Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny - which was released in November, 2006. The album Rize of the Fenix followed in 2012, receiving a GRAMMY nomination for Best Comedy Album. In 2014, Tenacious D won a GRAMMY Award in the category of Best Metal Performance for their cover of Ronnie James Dio’s “The Last In Line.” On November 2, 2018, Tenacious D released Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto – an animated film, with each frame hand-drawn by Black and every character voiced by Black and Gass. Alongside the film, the band also dropped the album Post-Apocalypto, which acted as the soundtrack to the series, and a graphic novel in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, the duo released a series of cover songs whose proceeds went to a number of charities, putting their own spin on The Beatles, The Who, and the camp classic “The Time Warp.” They also launched their own fiber bars line in conjunction with NuGo Nutrition called Tenacious D Fiber d’Lish. Up next was the Audible Original Words + Music | Vol. 29 | Tenacious D’s The Road To Redunktion, featuring 30 years of never-before-heard archival audio, and bringing to life every anecdote with a docu-quality that places listeners right then and there. Tenacious D continues to sell out massive shows across the world, which should come as no surprise for the Greatest Band That Ever Played on Planet Earth.

Watching his mom perform as choir director and lead musician at his church in Brooklyn and eventually playing with the choir by age five → 2.

Growing up in Cairo and Beirut, and starting to play trombone at age seven, inspired by his dad, who was a trumpet player → 2. Moving on to drums at age 10 → 3. Seeing his crush dance to his band’s music and realizing its power → 4. Crawling around on the floor on his mom’s Persian rug, and realizing that the complex patterns were exactly what music was all about for him, a mix of wildness and order in a strange tension. → 5. Going to boarding school in the UK, and realizing the power of music in church → 6. His musical influences of both reggae and Baladi rhythm → 7. Managing conflict in The Police, and finding the value in band therapy. Recruiting Sting and Andy Summers in 1977, Stewart Copeland is renowned as the founder of The Police, a band that became a defining force in rock music from the ‘80s through to the present day. His career includes the sale of more than 60 million records worldwide, and numerous awards, including five GRAMMY awards. Stewart has now spent more than three decades at the forefront of contemporary music as a rock star and acclaimed film composer, as well as in the disparate worlds of opera, ballet, and world and chamber music.

Buying herself her first guitar with her eighth grade graduation money → 3. Moving to Nashville and wanting to play a different kind of country music → 4. Pawning her wedding ring and selling her car to pay for recording at Sun Studios in Memphis, making the record, and then pitching it to every label and no interest for a year, until eventually Jack White’s Third Man Records picked it up → 5. Navigating political influences on country music → 6. Facing pain and learning how to channel it through her music. Margo Price has something to say but nothing to prove. In just three remarkable solo albums, the singer and songwriter has cemented herself as a force in American music and a generational talent. A deserving critical darling, she has never shied away from the sounds that move her, the pain that’s shaped her, or the topics that tick her off, like music industry double standards, the gender wage gap, or the plight of the American farmer (in 2021, she even joined the board of Farm Aid). While the last few years have seen remarkable moments of acclaim – a Best New Artist GRAMMY nomination, Americana Music Honors, a Saturday Night Live performance, and just about every outlet and critics’ year-end Best Of list – Price is still hungry. On her fourth full-length Strays, a clear-eyed mission statement delivered in blistering rock and roll, she’s taking on substance abuse, self-image, abortion rights, and orgasms. Musically extravagant but lyrically laser focused, the 10-song record tears into a broken world desperate for remedy. And who better to tell it? Price has been to the mountain and back, but finds herself, at long last, free. Feral. Stray.
