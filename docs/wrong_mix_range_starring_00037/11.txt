Harry Shearer, the voice of a bunch of characters on "The Simpsons" took to Twitter to say he's leaving the show.

Shearer, 71, has been with the show for all 26 seasons, starting in 1989.

Shearer provided the voices for neighbor Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, his assistant Smithers, and many minor characters.

Altogether, he's voiced more than 100 Springfield citizens â more than 170, according to the website Simpsons Wiki. See them all below â¼

Shearer told CNN the dispute centers around his ability to continue doing outside work. But CNN Media Critic Brian Stelter says we shouldn't believe the headlines that say Shearer is already gone.

Stelter says what's underway is a negotiation of sorts between Shearer and the show's producers, and it's suddenly spilled into public view.

When asked whether there's a chance he will continue on the show, shearer said, "I think that's a question better posed to them."

Fox recently announced picking up "The Simpsons" for two more seasons - its 27th and 28th.

A statement from "Simpsons" executive producers Al Jean, James L. Brooks and Matt Groening said Shearer "was offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed."

Shearer did not respond to a request for comment.

The multi-tasking Shearer has charted a diverse career as an actor, writer, musician and producer, both before and since becoming part of the "Simpsons" troupe. Also known for his starring role in the 1984 mockumentary classic "This Is Spinal Tap," as well as for hosting public radio's weekly "Le Show" for more than 30 years, he recently produced and starred in "Nixon's The One," portraying President Richard Nixon in a TV dramatization of the secret White House tapes.

Thursday's public acknowledgement of the ongoing dispute, he tweeted, was prompted by word from the lawyer of "Simpsons" executive producer Brooks that declared, "Show will go on, Harry will not be part of it, wish him the best."

Shearer tweeted, "Of course, I wish him the very best."

Information from CNN and The Associated Press was used in this report.
