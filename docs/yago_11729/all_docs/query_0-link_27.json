        "text": "When I stumbled across this on Amazon Prime, I was shocked to discover it was connected to Mad Monster Party?, Rankin/Bass' only stop-motion \"Animagic\" production to star classic movie monsters instead of elves and Santas. While MMP? was a rare theatrical feature for R/B, this was created for an ABC Saturday morning children's TV movie series, via traditional cel animation farmed out to Japan's Mushi Production. The same partnership gave us the immortal Xmas cartoon Frosty the Snowman, while this quickie is deservedly not as revered.\n\nBasically, Baron Frankenstein (Bob McFadden, doing a passable Boris Karloff) is fixin' to have his Monster marry the Bride he's created, but assistant Igor is fixated on taking the constructed lady for himself. Sheâ€¦\n\nIn 1972, ABC rolled out its The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie series, hour long animated movies that were broadcast on Saturday mornings (obviously) just as kids were fucking up their second bowl of Frankenberry, I'd imagine. This was the third release in Season One, debuting on September 23rd, inspired by the earlier success of Rankin & Bass' 1967 \"Animagic\" stop motion cult classic, Mad Monster Party? and vaguely reimagining many characters from that feature, before fading into obscurity until the advent of home video a decade later. Mad, mad, mad props to Rankin/Bass-historian Rick Goldschmidt for sending me an autographed copy. Not nearly in the same class as Party?, but perfectly fine as Saturday morning genre-flavored distraction for the kiddies. I'd sure love to hunt down a copy of the 12th episode, The Banana Splits in Hocus Pocus Park, but I'm not getting my hopes up.\n\nI feel vaguely guilty reviewing this one while Iâ€™m sick, since this will be the only review on Letterboxd to date for this little-seen animated special. On the other hand, my inability to concentrate probably made me slightly more charitable to this film, which is ultimately a retread of Mad Monster Party?, which I watched last year.\n\nThe saving graces of Mad Monster Party? were the glorious stop-motion Rankin/Bass animation and the surprisingly good celebrity stunt casting. The Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters has neither of those things. Itâ€™s cheap traditional animation made for television (aired as an ABC Superstar Movie) that tells what amounts to a prequel storyâ€”how the Monster met his Mateâ€”using the same basic structure and gags asâ€¦\n\nDr. Frankenstein invites all the Universal monsters to the arranged marriage between the Monster and the Bride, much to Igor's dismay.\n\n70s Saturday morning cartoon-level 2D animation, though there are a few nice images (a couple backdrops, the volcano). Igor is phenomenally painful and we get lots of 70s era sexism with the nagging housewife stereotypes and the faceless agency-free Bride. Also, if you're going to have the Bride hide her face for most of the film then you really need to make the reveal worthwhile. Don't set up a joke and flake out on the punchline.\n\nSpooktober 2023, shorts edition\n\nThis is literally just Hotel Transylvania but it was made in the 70s\n\nItâ€™s meh, may love the Videocraft/Mushi artstyle of these classic Rankin/Bass specials but it does nothing for this paper thin marriage story where the majority of the scenes feel like they play out almost nearly identical to each other. Will give some points to my mere shock that Dracula named his child Boobula, like whatâ€™s wrong with you man\n\nI am not the target demographic for this movie, because unlike any of the male characters in this movie, I actually love my significant other ðŸ˜Œ\n\nThe Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters is a Rankin/Bass Halloween special. It's traditionally 2D Animated, rather than stop-motion, which is an interesting change of pace. I think it's funny that Dracula named his son Boobula and I also think it's funny that this is when all the Classic Universal Monsters finally meet in one setting. The postman guy really needs therapy. For real. I think the Jekyll and Hyde joke was funny, but that was the only one. The rest are very bleh and subscribe to the \"Boy howdy! I hate my wife!\" school of comedy. Not very fun. Everyone needs counseling in this. Mid. 6/10. But a fun take on Rankin/Bass tradition."
