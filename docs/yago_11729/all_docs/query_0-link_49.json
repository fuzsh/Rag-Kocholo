        "text": "Year: 1980\n\nDirector: Arthur Rankin, Jr., Jules Bass\n\nStarring: Todd Porter, George S. Irving, Alan King\n\nI hate midquels. Who ever thought it was a good idea to write a story that takes place entirely within another story while still focusing on the same character? You can’t offer up serious character growth or even any events that are too drastic, because it would affect the original work. Now, there are midquels that work, like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead for Hamlet or The Horse and his Boy for The Chronicles of Narnia, but these focus on either side characters or all-new characters. Pinocchio’s Christmas, on the other hand, just focuses on the characters in Pinocchio at Christmastime.\n\nHere’s the thing about Pinocchio, the character. In both the book and Disney film, he has one arc—He has to become a better person so he can go from wooden puppet to real boy. If you set a story before that, he’d just be a tree. If you set a story after that (ahem Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night), you either have to tell a story just about a boy, or threaten him with re-puppetization. Since the puppet form is the one people are familiar with, telling a story in the middle would seem a simple way to continue the story, but at the end while he can be a little better, he’s still gonna be a puppet.\n\nSo anyway, it’s Christmastime in the village where half of the people talk with Italian accents and the other half sound American.\n\nPinocchio doesn’t really know what snow is, which makes sense because he’s a puppet during his first year of life, but also doesn’t make sense because he used to be a tree! He lived in a forest where I’m sure there was snow, and he had definitely been around as a tree for longer than a year. Even if he didn’t know the word for it, he was at least familiar with the concept.\n\nPinocchio says he hopes it’s the best Christmas ever, and Gepetto says he hopes so too, “knock on wood” as he does just that to Pinocchio! Um… OK. What does Pinocchio say for good luck? Knock on flesh? It’s best not to think too long about it.\n\nThis special has a running gag that Gepetto’s wig keeps falling off, and it’s really random and serves no purpose. It’s definitely not something that carries over from any other version of the story, except that it’s briefly mentioned that he wears a wig in the book. Maybe they’re trying to make a joke that a guy who makes intricate puppets can’t even make a good wig for himself, but nothing is ever made of it, and I’m not gonna give Rankin/Bass enough credit for a joke that subtle. My theory is that the puppeteers in the special couldn’t get the hair right, so they just made it an obvious wig instead.\n\nAfter Gepetto (George S. Irving) finally convinces Pinocchio (Todd Porter) to go to school because you don’t have to do real work at Christmas anyway, he sings a song to himself in the mirror about Christmas shopping. It goes nowhere and is absolutely pointless. Hey, remember when Mary Poppins sang to herself in the mirror, and the woman in the mirror answered? What if that wasn’t funny, had a less catchy song, and had no bearing on the plot or characters? Gepetto also has a very different singing voice than his speaking voice, as he speaks with an accent but sings in Irving’s normal voice (the same one he used for Heat Miser), which creates a really strange dissonance.\n\nAnyway, Pinocchio decides to sell his schoolbook back to the (very gullible) bookseller, and he plans to use the money to buy Gepetto a Christmas gift. On the road, Pinocchio runs into The Fox and the Cat, who tell him that if he plants the money in a certain field, it will grow into a money tree.\n\nOh wait I’m sorry, that last sentence is a plot point from Carlo Collodi’s novel. What happens in the Christmas special? On the road, Pinocchio runs into The Fox and the Cat, who tell him that if he plants the money in a certain field, it will grow into a money Christmas tree. See how they really don’t change anything? So far, it’s not really so much a story about Pinocchio at Christmastime as THE story of Pinocchio which now just happens at Christmastime.\n\nThe Fox is voiced by Allen Swift, who you may remember as practically every voice from Mad Monster Party?, but while he seems to be going for an impression of some kind, I can’t quite place it. It’s kind of like his Sydney Greenstreet from MMP? mixed with Lee J. Cobb, but I feel like there’s an obvious answer I’m missing. Also, unlike the Disney version, The Cat does speak (voiced by Pat Bright), but she’s just a ditz who usually doesn’t realize what The Fox’s evil plans are.\n\nAfter burying the money, Pinocchio sings “Gonna Get Lucky (Knock on Wood),” which I’ll admit is catchy, but it is incredibly clear that voice actor Todd Porter was going through puberty. He gives a fine voice performance throughout the special, but they really should have just dubbed this number to make it less distracting. It’s really all you’ll be able to think about while listening to it.\n\nOn the street, Pinocchio meets a puppeteer who would love to use a live marionette in his puppet show.\n\nOh no, I’m sorry, I used a plot point from the book again. On the street, Pinocchio meets a puppeteer who would love to use a live marionette in his Christmas puppet show. Look, if you want to do an adaptation of Pinocchio, do an adaptation of Pinocchio. Christmas has had very little to do with this so far! By the way, the puppeteer here is called Fire Eater, a little translation of the name Mangiafuoco from the book, as opposed to Stromboli, his name in the Disney version.\n\nMaestro Fire Eater (Look, I can’t call him Strombarely, I used that name in my review of Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night.) hires Pinocchio as the star of the act, but gives him the stage name Sir Larry Olive-Tree. Hold on a second. You can’t just say this is some catchy stage name, because if you don’t know it’s a pun, it just sounds stupid. It can only mean one thing—Sir Laurence Olivier exists in the universe of Pinocchio’s Christmas. Therefore movies exist in this universe, which makes it seems strange that people are all excited about a puppet show with a semi-lifelike puppet.\n\nIn yet another song sequence, Maestro Fire Eater (Alan King) sings “Let ‘Em Laugh,” which is literally just a knock-off of “Make ‘Em Laugh” from Singing in the Rain. So again, in a universe where movies exist, no one is noticing the obvious plagiarism here? Anyway, after the show, Pinocchio runs off with another puppet who hasn’t come to life (Emperor of the Night re-used this plot), and they outrun the cops. They hide in the Enchanted Forest where Pinocchio grew up (Literally, like sprouted out of the ground).\n\nAlright, we need to talk about this whole Enchanted Forest nonsense. In the original novel, no reason is given for why Pinocchio came to life. He just did. The Disney film has The Blue Fairy (called “The Fairy with the Turquoise Hair” in the novel… because that’s catchy) bring him to life when Gepetto wishes on a star. Here, Pinocchio is made out of wood from the Enchanted Forest. There seem to be some strings holding this plot point down, and I’ve got some questions.\n\nSo Pinocchio isn’t special? Literally any puppet made from wood from the forest could come to life?\n\nWhy does Pinocchio’s nose grow when he lies? Is this also part of the enchantment?\n\nWhat if you made a puppet with both enchanted and non-enchanted wood? Could it have a working arm and no working feet? Could it talk and realize it was unable to move? That sounds like psychological torture.\n\nWhat if you do other things with the wood of the enchanted forest like build a house? Or a bridge? Or use it as firewood? Will your house or bridge come to life? Will it feel the pain of fire?\n\nWhat about weaponry? Never mind, don’t get me started…\n\nThe Fox and The Cat catch up with Pinocchio in the forest (He’s lost apparently, even though he grew up there), and they tell him that they have found a coachman who will take him to Pleasure Island. What? I’m doing that thing from the book again. OK… They tell him they have found a sleigh driver who will help him bring the female puppet to life. In reality, they want to sell him to a rich man who wants a gift for his children. Pinocchio asks if they’re telling the truth, and The Fox insists they are… in song. It feels like an entirely pointless song where he just lists different variations on “It’s the truth,” but when he sings “Or may lightning strike me down,” The Cat gets electrocuted!\n\nOK Rankin/Bass, I don’t know when you started making Airplane!, but I was cracking up at this. After two electrocutions, The Fox alters the lyrics to “May lightning strike that tree,” which it does… and then the tree falls on The Cat. Later in the special, The Fox tries to say it once more, but The Cat runs away, and he says “Cancel that order.” Nevertheless, it strikes her anyway when she comes out of hiding. It’s genuinely well-done comedy, and I definitely wasn’t expecting it.\n\nThe Fairy (Lady Azura is her name here) finds Pinocchio in the forest, and The Fox and the Cat run away. The Fairy (Diane Leslie) takes him… somewhere… and interrogates him about what happened. The Talking Cricket (Bob McFadden) is there too as a doctor, because we’ve got to include him somehow.\n\nPinocchio lies at first so they can do the whole nose-growing thing, but he eventually tells the truth. She tells him he’s not bad, because he was just trying to buy Christmas presents, but insists (in song, of course) that he doesn’t need to spend money on a gift, but rather just do something out of love.\n\nThe Fox and the Cat finally convince Pinocchio to go with the sleigh driver to the North Pole, where he can help Santa’s toys learn to dance… just go with it. In the version I watched, there’s a really obvious edit that I’ve discovered is a song where Pinocchio fantasizes about doing this. Like most Rankin/Bass songs, it’s utterly pointless.\n\nWhen Pinocchio gets to the rich children who want him as a gift, he convinces the father (in the same song The Fairy sang) that giving love is more important than gifts.\n\nIt works, and he gets to home with a little help from Santa, who also exists in this universe apparently (It’s a little less shocking than Laurence Olivier.).\n\nWhat’s weird is once Pinocchio is reunited with Gepetto, the special outright shows that Pinocchio will go to Pleasure Island later and get turned into a donkey, and that Gepetto will get swallowed by a fish, meaning that all of the lessons learned here are pretty much moot.\n\nAlso, they went to all the trouble of setting up the puppets just for these brief screenshots? This just means that The Fox and the Cat and Maestro Fire Eater still exist and will presumably fool Pinocchio again. Even if he’s learned something, you better believe he won’t retain it.\n\nWhat a strange anomaly this thing is. It can’t decide if it wants to be a Pinocchio special or a Christmas special, and I have no idea how it could have successfully done both without being a sequel… and you know how well a movie where Pinocchio isn’t a puppet would go. I did genuinely laugh at the “It’s the Truth” song, and I liked Allen Swift as The Fox, so for that alone it’s better than The Story of Santa Claus.\n\nWell, we’re only two specials in, and we’ve already seen near-disintegrations and actual cat electrocutions. I’m betting it will only get weirder from here.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1967\n\nDirector: Jules Bass\n\nStarring: Boris Karloff, Allen Swift, Phyllis Diller\n\nThe final weird Halloween special is an appropriate place to end, as it’s a loving tribute to all things classic horror. Mad Monster Party? (And yes, it has a question mark in the title) could easily have been a forgettable run-through, but it validates itself by casting Boris Karloff himself in the lead role! Sure, it was not the highest point in his career (He would do Targets the following year, though), but an animated monster movie with Boris Karloff is far better than one without it.\n\nMad Monster Party? comes to us from Rankin/Bass, famous for their cheesy but charming stop-motion Christmas specials, and also the pretty enjoyable cartoon adaptation of The Hobbit. MMP? is a stop-motion cartoon in the vein of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer or Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town, but just focusing on Halloween instead of Christmas. Believe it or not, this actually got a theatrical release.\n\nWhile working in the lab late one night, Baron Boris von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) comes across his greatest discovery—a liquid that will completely destroy anyone and anything.\n\nWhy a man who was constantly working to create life has now created death is never really discussed, but anyway, he’s happy and has to write to all his monster friends and tell them the good news.\n\nOver the opening credits, we see all the various monsters and villains getting their invitations, and it’s actually a pretty nice sequence. However, it’s hard to miss the fact that some of these monsters appear in their most traditional form, while others do not. It’s as if some of them are characters out of novels that anyone is free to adapt, while others are out of movies that you would have to pay for the rights to. It’s a little game I like to call…\n\nAlright, let’s begin. Frankenstein’s Monster comes right from Mary Shelley’s novel, which is in the public domain. However, since the 1931 movie is not, we can’t have him looking identical to the Karloff version.\n\nSince the iconic Bride of Frankenstein is film-only, we can’t show her with her iconic looks. Instead, she is only called the Monster’s Mate, and she looks a lot like Phyllis Diller.\n\nOh, she’s also voiced by Phyllis Diller, because why not? She even has a song called “You’re Different” that comes out of absolutely nowhere and is barely a song. Oh Rankin/Bass, who ever said songs in musicals have to further the plot?\n\nWho’s next up in Public Domain Roulette? Let’s take a look at this film’s Dracula.\n\nHe’s technically based on Bram Stoker’s character, but the impression is about 60% Bela Lugosi. The other 40% seems to be old-timey gangster for some very strange reason, and he even looks a bit like Edward G. Robinson. It’s really weird. I also think The Count from Sesame Street took some inspiration from this character, especially with the monocle.\n\nThe Mummy is not based on the 1932 Universal film, but it’s a mummy. There’s a pretty generic look you can get away with when one is wrapped in bandages.\n\nOn the other hand, both Dr. Jekyll and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are taken from public domain novels, and neither really has an iconic look that is owned by a studio.\n\nThe Hunchback does kind of look inhuman though, and he’s never even called Quasimodo.\n\nThe Invisible Man is an interesting case, as he’s based on the public domain H.G. Wells novel, but he’s dressed and sounds like Sydney Greenstreet’s character in Casablanca. Um… alright then.\n\nI guess a Claude Rains impression would have gotten you sued by Universal, so you just picked a different Casablanca actor? I mean, it’s a solid Sydney Greenstreet impression, and I’m sure all the kids watching just loved The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Now I’m just imagining Bogart as the Invisible Man instead…\n\nOh you don’t like that Casablanca quote? Well there’s always “Here’s not looking at me, kid” or “I stick my neck out for nobody.”\n\nHow about The Creature from the Black Lagoon? Just kidding, he’s only called “The Creature,” which is also what Frankenstein’s monster is called in some versions, so try not to be confused.\n\nYou know I’m saving the worst one for last, don’t you? Let’s get this over with. This is the Universal Wolf Man.\n\nHere is the werewolf (they can’t even say “wolf man” in this film) that Mad Monster Party? gives us.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, the werewolf makeup in The Wolf Man looks nothing like a wolf, but it’s iconic nonetheless. Not only does this werewolf look entirely different, he never even transforms! That’s not even a werewolf! That’s literally just a wolf.\n\nAnyway, all of the monsters come from their humble abodes and travel to the Isle of Evil where Boris von Frankenstein lives. Also invited is our “hero,” Frankenstein’s nephew Felix Flanken. Flanken is voiced by Allen Swift, doing a Jimmy Stewart impression for some reason. I mean, it’s a good impression, but the character doesn’t look anything like Stewart, and Stewart never really did horror movies.\n\nSwift actually voices every character in this film who isn’t Phyllis Diller, Boris Karloff, or Boris’s assistant Francesca (Gale Garnett). I honestly thought Felix’s boss was voiced by the same guy who did Yukon Cornelius in Rudolph, but apparently not.\n\nAs you would expect, there are plenty of puns and one-liners about the monsters. Some of them work, like when Felix says he can’t see the Invisible Man without his glasses, leading him to laugh it off because he’s “heard that one before.” Others are really painful, like Felix thinking Dr. Jekyll wants to play hide and seek, and then hiding for 12 hours until he doesn’t come.\n\nMeanwhile, Boris is making extra preparations to make sure that “It” doesn’t arrive. We are never told who or what “It” is until we see it, but you better believe it isn’t in the public domain. Anyway, Boris has his butler Peter Lorre arrange for a troop of zombies to fly around the island to block “It” (I’ll admit the Corpse Corps is an amusing pun.).\n\nThe character is called Yetch, but I’m just gonna call him Peter Lorre. Someone on this production team really liked Casablanca and/or The Maltese Falcon.\n\nPeter Lorre is really creepy towards Francesca, taking every rejection from her as a signal that she loves him. There’s also a long, entirely pointless sequence where Peter Lorre goes into the kitchen and chats with Chef Mafia Machiavelli about what’s for dinner.\n\nHold on… Chef MAFIA MACHIAVELLI? You’re going to name the stereotypical Italian chef after two of the absolute worst things in Italian history? This would be like naming a German chef Adolf Germancuisine. Not only is the name awful, but this guy’s Italian accent and mannerisms accent are so exaggerated that I bet even other Italian stereotypes would have an issue with it. Let’s find out. What do you think, Poppie from Seinfeld?\n\nThis-a-one is a bit too over the top for my tastes. He’s not even a good chef.\n\nHow about you, Italian restaurant owner from Lady and the Tramp?\n\nOh this is a type/It’s a stereotype/And my mouth says “Hell-a No eh.”\n\nAnd finally, what do you think Enzo the Barber from Seinfeld? (You know what? I’m starting to think Seinfeld may have had a slight problem with Italian stereotypes.)\n\nEven I-a think-this-a one goes too far.\n\nWell it appears all three Italian stereotypes have given this one the boot, which officially means it has gone too far. Apparently, this scene wasn’t even in the original film, but the producers wanted Rankin/Bass to expand the thing to 90 minutes. I can’t believe I’m asking for this, but why couldn’t you have just written another pointless song?\n\nSpeaking of pointless songs, let’s talk about “Stay One Step Ahead,” the most bizarre, out of nowhere moment in the whole film. Boris is showing Felix around his laboratory in castle east and trying to convince him to take over as head of the monsters. When Felix says he’s not sure he’s up for the job, Boris gives him some advice… in song… with the help of some little singing monsters we never see anywhere else in the entire special. It feels like something out of The Muppet Show!\n\nSo, interesting fact—When Boris Karloff did his voice work for How the Grinch Stole Christmas, he informed the production team that he was not a good singer, and therefore couldn’t perform “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.” This of course led to an iconic version of the song sung by man-with-the-lowest-voice-and-coolest-name-ever Thurl Ravenscroft. Here, apparently he didn’t tell anyone he couldn’t sing, and he just kind of talks his way through the number, letting the background singers do the heavy lifting. Also, is it just me, or does this song sound eerily similar to “Put One Foot in Front of the Other” from Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town? Way to plagiarize yourself three years later, Rankin/Bass.\n\nAt the titular Mad Monster Party (?), the scene is rocking and all are digging the sounds.\n\nThe skeleton band is playing a song about The Mummy, because he’s not really important to this special otherwise. It does have a noticeable organ track, even though there is clearly no keyboard player in the lineup! I’d call it a bare-bones arrangement, but Rankin/Bass would probably try and hire me for that pun.\n\nI don’t know why a special that relies on the charm of every monster being in one place needs much of a plot, but whatever, let’s have the monsters connive against Boris’s plan to put his nephew in charge. Francesca makes a deal with Dracula to do away with Felix and rule together, and they have a pretty pointless Old Hollywood song and dance sequence about it.\n\nHowever, Phyllis Diller overhears and it leads to a cat fight with actual meow sound effects. Um… alright then.\n\nFrancesca tries to double cross Felix, but they eventually fall in love, because plot reasons. Oh, but what’s the inciting incident that makes her fall head over heels for him? She begins to freak out about the monsters, and he slaps her… twice. Almost immediately after this, she begins to passionately kiss him. WHAT? Rankin/Bass, what were you thinking? You’re better than this… I think. This wasn’t funny ever. In fact, it’s really the only scary thing in the special.\n\nEventually, all of the monsters team up against Felix, but their plan doesn’t go too well until “It” awakens, and who is “It?”\n\nThankfully, no.\n\nSadly, no.\n\nYep, it’s King Kong. However, since we can’t say “King Kong” as he was created for the 1933 film of the same name, he is only referred to as “It.” Despite not looking much like King Kong, some of the same trick photography that was used to film Kong in the classic film is used here, and it’s a nice little shout-out.\n\nIt eventually ends when Boris lets Francesca and Felix escape, and sacrifices himself by using the liquid he created at the beginning to DESTROY THE ENTIRE ISLAND AND EVERYONE ON IT! There’s even a Batman-esque “KABOOM” title card for some reason.\n\nWow, Rankin/Bass, you went full Dr. Strangelove on us. I mean, I know the two “heroes” escape, and pretty much everyone else (besides Boris) was a villain, but you just wiped them all out with an explosion.\n\nAnyway, Felix and Francesca watch from the boat, but Francesca reveals that she is one of Frankenstein’s creations (which has been implied throughout). In one of the most ridiculous, forced shout-outs I’ve ever seen, Felix says “Well Francesca, none of us are perfect.” Hey, here’s a good rule to follow if you’re going to reference one of the most famous closing lines of all time: GET THE LINE RIGHT! He also glitches and says this line over and over, suggesting that they’re both robots, I guess. Whatever.\n\nIt’s silly, overly-long, and has a few things that are very dated, but on the whole, Mad Monster Party is a fun love letter to the Universal Monsters of the ’30s and ’40s. There are even some pretty clever jokes, like Francesca forgetting which object is the Achilles’ heel of each monster. Most of the songs are catchy, albeit incredibly random, and most of all, it’s worth it for Boris Karloff’s genuinely committed performance. It’s weird, but in the best ways.\n\nWell, we’ve gotten through all six, and I’ll wrap up with some final thoughts tomorrow.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1980\n\nDirector: Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nStarring: Orson Bean, John Huston, Roddy McDowall\n\nAlright, I haven’t done this since A Christmas Carol 1982, but I need to rant about this cover before starting the review. What happened here? We see two hobbits, who look like none of the hobbits featured in this cartoon. We can assume they are Frodo and Sam, but Frodo and Sam walk the entire film. They do not once mount a horse! Is this supposed to imply Frodo is the king who’s returning? (Spoiler: It’s Aragorn.) On either side of them, we have a dwarf. Great, Gimli’s in this movie right?\n\nI’m just gonna assume he’s in that processional somewhere. He doesn’t have any lines though, and he sure doesn’t seem to look like those Snow White-looking guys on the cover. There also appears to be a DRAGON of all things flying above one of the castles. Alright, let’s get to the review itself.\n\nOh Rankin/Bass we meet again. Famous for Christmas specials like Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Rankin/Bass expanded their horizons a bit in the late 70’s and onward. We got a pretty competent, albeit short, TV version of The Hobbit in 1977 and the most hilariously overblown Christmas special of all time in 1979 with Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July. After Ralph Bakshi got screwed over by the studio and didn’t get to make another Lord of the Rings film, Rankin/Bass decided to give it another go with the third installment in Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King… just The Return of the King. So you made The Hobbit and now we’re just gonna skip to the end of The Lord of the Rings? What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWhile The Hobbit was a mere 78 minutes, The Return of the King at least gets a full 98. It’s not enough to do complete justice to Tolkien, but when you look at all the things they stuffed into Christmas in July, there’s at least potential. Here is my estimation of how the conversation between Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass went after they learned they got more time to work with:\n\nRankin: Think of how much we could squeeze into the extra running time. This might actually make sense and not feel rushed.\n\nBass: Or we could add a whole ton of songs.\n\nRankin: But there aren’t that many songs in the book. Wouldn’t it kind of feel forced?\n\nBass: What’s a Rankin/Bass special without random singing? Also, with all this time, we could do three title cards!\n\nAlright, I get that the first one was called The Hobbit and you want some continuity, but this just sounds stupid. These are THE HOBBITS, not just your regular run-of-the-mill hobbits (Actually Ted Sandyman was the hobbit who ran the mill, but that’s neither here nor there). Why don’t you just go all out pretentious and call it Sunrise: A Song of Two Hobbits? There’s enough singing in it!\n\nAt least Rankin/Bass is trying to embrace the epic scope of Lord of the Rings, right? Not by doing anything of course, but by telling us it’s an epic in the opening narration. That’s all we need, I guess. You just tell us the genre and we’ll assume.\n\nSure it was, Tommy.\n\nAlright, so do we start off where Bakshi left off? I mean, I know it’s not technically a sequel to his film, but a little continuity would be nice…\n\nNope, we start in Rivendell at Bilbo’s 129th birthday party. The ring has already been destroyed and we’re getting the story in flashback. There are certain stories that work in flashback, but The Lord of the Rings? The main dramatic crux of the story is destroying the ring, but you’re just going to tell us right off the bat that it’s already happened? I’m not even saying we should be surprised that the ring eventually gets destroyed in the book, but come on. What’s the point in this?\n\nAlso, the scene starts with Frodo and Sam walking to Rivendell to meet up with Gandalf, Merry, Pippin and the others.\n\nThis is fine, except later in the film (but earlier in the timeline), we see them all together in Gondor celebrating the victory. Did they all leave at separate times? Is there some Middle-earth roadside attraction that Frodo and Sam just had to see?\n\nOnce the group has eaten, Gandalf introduces them all to the Minstrel of Gondor… who apparently has been standing there the whole time. What, didn’t he get to eat?\n\nThe minstrel is voiced by Glenn Yarbrough, who also was the off-screen singer in The Hobbit. This is obviously a non-book character, so I’m not sure why they decided to make him look like this, when the real Glenn Yarbrough looked like Chris Christie’s kind, less bridge-closey brother.\n\nThe songs in The Hobbit (mostly) worked, because they were from Tolkien’s work and the story had a simpler feel to it. There are occasional songs in The Lord of the Rings, but they aren’t featured here. Instead we get forced songs that just won’t stop playing. “Frodo of the Nine Fingers” and “The Bearer of the Ring” seem to pop-up every single time there’s a serious moment, and they just suck all the drama right out of them.\n\nI’m really only a fan of minstrels in movies if they get eaten halfway through, and sadly that is not the case here.\n\nWhen we do get to the actual story, we start around where The Return of the King book picks up, with Frodo captured by orcs and Sam with the ring. We spend a lot of time with Frodo (Orson Bean) and Sam (Roddy McDowall) getting closer to Mount Doom and struggling with the ring, but it’s always ruined by music. I really like Orson Bean as Bilbo, but they really shouldn’t have cast him as Frodo too. It’s distracting, because he doesn’t really change his voice, and it’s not like Bilbo and Frodo are father and son. They’re uncle and nephew, so why would they have the same voice? Roddy McDowall is a fine actor, but he brings nothing of note to Sam and he’s really over the top… but he’s still better than this guy.\n\nThe events of Fellowship and Two Towers aren’t even referenced, but the events of The Hobbit are, which makes Gollum’s appearance really bizarre. Gollum being Frodo and Sam’s guide to Mordor is not mentioned, but Sam still awkwardly name drops him shortly before he appears. I suppose he stayed in his mountain all that time but got a sneaking suspicion someone took his ring to Mordor and went there, just happening to run into Frodo and Sam. Got it. At another point, Sam pulls out a vial of light that was given to him by Galadriel in the book, but since that didn’t happen here, it just magically happens to be in his bag. Is that a deus ex machina in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\n\nWe also get a sequence in which Sam is tempted by the ring, leading him to dream of a green and fruitful Mordor where he asks his servants to “Behold the gardens of my delight.” I thought this was a kids’ movie!\n\nMeanwhile in Gondor, we do have one of this film’s very few redeeming qualities—John Huston’s Gandalf.\n\nHe has less to work with than in The Hobbit, but he’s still great, adding a richness to Gandalf’s voice that no one else has ever brought. Since the story is compressed to an absurd degree, he often does a lot of narrating. I wish this much narration wasn’t necessary, but since it is, I’m glad he’s the one doing it.\n\nGandalf spends his early scenes with Pippin, and they are joined later by Merry. I found it strange that Casey Kasem voiced Merry, but I remembered that he was also the voice of Shaggy, so obviously he was a talented voice actor… but he just sounds like Casey Kasem here. Yep, a radio DJ in Middle-Earth, but not just one. Pippin is voiced by Sonny Menendez, another American radio DJ who sounds like he’s going through puberty. Every time they open their mouths, it completely takes you out of the movie.\n\nIn Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin meet with Denethor (William Conrad), even though we have had no buildup to this character and have not met his sons Boromir and Faramir. Denethor is supposed to be a tragic figure, a once-respected ruler who is falling into madness.\n\nInstead, we get what looks like the Old Man from a stoner version of The Tell-Tale Heart and sounds like the most cliched sniveling villain the writers could come up with. We’ve had no buildup to what a palantir is, since they didn’t adapt The Two Towers (Gandalf briefly describes it as a “crystal ball”), so it kind of comes out of nowhere… again.\n\nOf course, just like in the book, Denethor is burned alive… nah who am I kidding? This is a kids’ movie. He just has his guards surround him and the scene cuts to some flames, letting us infer how he died. After Denethor’s death, Pippin asks Gandalf if there is any hope, and Gandalf says there’s none unless the ring is destroyed. Wait, wasn’t that the only hope all along? They could win every battle across Middle-earth, but if Sauron gets the ring back, it’ll all moot. Why are they acting like now that’s the only hope?\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the coolest moments in all of The Lord of the Rings is the confrontation with the head Nazgul, the Witch-king of Angmar. Confident in his Shakespearean prophecy that no man can ever defeat him, the Witch-king wreaks havoc on Gondor, only to be brought down by the tag-team of Eowyn and Merry. Eowyn has been brushed aside by the men who went to battle, and Merry has felt like the load in comparison to the other hobbits. However, they band together for one of the most heroic moments in Tolkien’s work and form a lasting friendship as they heal of their wounds. This moment only truly works if you adapt the whole story, though, because in Fellowship, it’s established that Merry’s sword was forged by the enemies of the Witch-king. Again, it’s called buildup and payoff.\n\nI’ll admit the introduction of the Witch-king here is actually pretty effective, with the dark music, creepy design and John Huston’s narration.\n\nEven when he takes his hood off, the floating eye design still works.\n\nThen he talks, and it just ruins the entire atmosphere. He sounds like someone put The Knights Who Say “Ni” in a blender. I really can’t imagine why someone thought this wavering voice sounded creepy. It sounds way more like a villain in a parody film where the bad guy turns out to be a wimp, and it reminds me a bit of the mayor’s changing voice in The Christmas Tree. Eowyn comes out of nowhere (shocker) and challenges him, and after Merry gives some shoe-horned exposition about her, he joins in with his assumed-to-be-normal sword and helps defeat the Witch-king.\n\nAs Frodo and Sam draw closer to Mordor, they have to join an Orc troupe in what is perhaps the best and worst scene in the movie… let me explain. First, it’s a scene right out of the book, and while it may seem preposterous that Frodo and Sam could be mistaken for Orcs, it does seem that all species of creatures are on the side of Mordor. Even the Orcs come in all shapes and sizes.\n\nIt is also made very clear that the average orc doesn’t really want to go to battle. Just look at their expressions.\n\nThis goes a long way in characterizing them as more than just evil mooks to kill off, something Tolkien himself took issue with. It’s sort of ruined, though, with the totally out-of-place “Where There’s a Whip, There’s a Way,” a funky marching song that belongs in Middle-earth about as much as Casey Kasem does. However, the lyrics themselves put forth this same message of forced fighting, so I guess it’s an attempt. I still really like the scene, though, because Frodo and Sam only escape when the Orcs and men, fighting for the same side, end up killing each other over a petty dispute.\n\nAfter a long (I mean, I guess we only see a few days of it) and perilous (Surely there’s a little peril) quest, Frodo and Sam finally reach Mount Doom.\n\nMordor looks absolutely hellish in this thing, and Mount Doom definitely lives up to its name, both inside and out.\n\nJust like in the book, Frodo claims the ring for his own and slips it on, disappearing in front of a distraught Sam. However, instead of immediately being attacked by Gollum, Frodo apparently walks around Mount Doom for days with the ring on! Alright, it’s question time.\n\nIt’s clear this change was made because Rankin/Bass didn’t have their timelines matching up, but how hard is this to change? Why couldn’t you just have the Gondor battle scenes take place earlier? How did you not realize this until the last minute?\n\nIf Frodo wears the ring for days, what is he doing the whole time? Is he just exploring all of Mount Doom? What does he eat or drink?\n\nHow has Sauron not seen him by this point? In the book, Aragorn’s raid on Mordor was to distract Sauron as Frodo slipped through the back door, but here the raid isn’t even planned until Frodo is at Mount Doom with the ring on! He’s literally right there unguarded.\n\nAragorn and company do march on Mordor, but Aragorn (you know, the titular king) only has a handful of lines in this thing. He’s just a plot device, but again, that’s what happens when you only adapt the climax of a story!\n\nAnyway, after three days or so in Mount Doom, Gollum attacks Frodo, grabs the ring and, mid-celebration, falls into Mount Doom with it. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the eagles as Mordor crumbles around them, and everyone is reunited in Gondor. Well at least that scene is done right.\n\nAnd now, a moment of silence for all the things lost in this adaptation:\n\nThe Paths of the Dead\n\nSaruman\n\nGrima Wormtongue\n\nPrince Imrahil\n\nSympathy for Denethor\n\nFaramir\n\nOh wait, maybe this is Faramir?\n\nArwen\n\nLegolas and Gimli’s friendship\n\nThe Scouring of the Shire\n\nOne of the greater themes of The Lord of the Rings—heck, perhaps the main theme—is the changing face of Middle-earth. The rings led to a lot of the magic in the world, good and bad, and that magic is now fading. Elves are departing across the sea, and wizards are leaving for one reason or another. Here, we get hit over the head with a very confused version of that message. Gandalf explains that Frodo is taller than Bilbo, and Merry and Pippin are taller than Frodo, meaning that hobbits will eventually evolve into men. I’m not really sure what the point of this is.\n\nAt least we end with Frodo going across the sea with Gandalf and Elrond. As much as I dislike the songs in this, the extended version of “Roads” Glenn Yarbrough sings here is pretty nice. It’s at least a nice send-off to the Rankin/Bass Middle-earth I enjoyed in The Hobbit.\n\nAlright, let’s attempt to score this thing.\n\nAdaptation (18/50 Points)\n\nI’m not sure how you’re supposed to adapt just one-third of The Lord of the Rings, but it isn’t with musical numbers every five minutes. Characters come out of nowhere, plot points make no sense without the buildup of previous installments, and even the serious moments get ruined by stupid ones. The ring is destroyed, and at least that is kind of handled well.\n\nCast (11/25 Points)\n\nJohn Huston is back as Gandalf, and he is the best part of the film. I’m fine with Orson Bean being back as Bilbo, but he really shouldn’t have voiced Frodo. The radio DJs voicing Merry and Pippin are just awful, and the bizarre-sounding Witch-king is hilarious.\n\nExperience (9/25 Points)\n\nSTOP SINGING! Alright, enough about the singing. The animation is typical Rankin/Bass, meaning hit or miss. Mordor looks great, and the atmosphere is occasionally effective in other scenes, too. However, the misses are hard misses.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 38%\n\nThe Hobbit was a kids’ book, so the cartoon worked well enough. This is just a quickly-thrown together mess, filled in with narration and songs. Unless you’re dying to see it, you won’t get much out of it.\n\nThe wait is over. Next week, I’m going to revisit Peter Jackson’s The Fellowship of the Ring and see if I’ve just been way too picky all these years.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1979\n\nDirector: Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nStarring: Billie May Richards, Jackie Vernon, Paul Frees\n\nIn 1964, Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass created one of the most famous holiday specials of all time—Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Made on a very low budget with stop-motion animation and only one famous celebrity voice (Burl Ives), it became a classic nonetheless. Rudolph‘s success led to a string of other Christmas specials from Rankin/Bass, including Santa Claus is Coming to Town, The Little Drummer Boy, and of course Frosty the Snowman. Both Rudolph and Frosty had their own individual sequels, but in 1979, they decided it was time to finally have the two beloved characters crossover with Rudolph and Frosty’s Christmas in July.\n\nIf you never intend for two specials to crossover, there are some obvious issues with canon you’re going to have to deal with. Let’s start with the obvious. The animation in Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer looked like this.\n\nThe animation in Frosty the Snowman looked like this.\n\nRankin and Bass decided to make Frosty in Claymation, and I have to admit that 15 years after Rudolph, the stop motion animation has gotten a lot better.\n\nThen there’s the issue of Santa Claus. In Rudolph, Santa was a downright jerk to everyone, only stopping his mockery of Rudolph when he needed to use his nose. Santa in Frosty the Snowman was voiced by Paul Frees, who voices the villain in this special, so they decided to make this a three-way crossover and throw in Mickey Rooney from Santa Claus is Coming to Town.\n\nFrosty (Jackie Vernon) has moved permanently to the North Pole with his wife Crystal (Shelley Winters, clearly chosen for the name), who he married in Frosty’s Winter Wonderland (For the ’90s kids wondering, Frosty Returns actually came years later and is not from Rankin/Bass). He also now has two children Milly and Chilly, who thankfully were not created in any special.\n\nAfter seeing Rudolph and Frosty being friends for a few minutes and a very nice opening credits sequence, we get the reason why this special is 90 minutes long—lots and lots of exposition. Santa tells us that long before he came to the North Pole, it used to be ruled by an evil sorcerer named Winterbolt (Paul Frees)\n\nWinterbolt lives in a cavernous lair, with dragons, a crystal ball, and a Magic Mirror-esque genie who answers all his questions. Again, the stop motion animation has come a long way, because I have to admit, the design of it all is pretty great. Also, Winterbolt is just so over-the-top in his mannerisms and evil voice that it’s at least interesting every time he’s on screen.\n\nI’ll attempt to give you the somewhat quick version of this ten minutes of exposition. Winterbolt used his scepter made of pure ice to ward off everyone good who crossed his path and ruled for a long time. One day the Aurora Borealis took human form (Lady Boreal) and used her magic to put Winterbolt to sleep for a thousand years. In that time, Santa Claus came to the North Pole and happiness was restored. When the thousand years were over, the ring came to the creature Gollum…\n\nSorry, I already need a drink. This is freaking long. Let’s play the Voice Actor Drinking Game and we can get back to the exposition. Alright, there are four definitive voice actors in 60’s and 70’s animated specials. A special with all four is almost a thing of legend, but let’s see how many we can find. We already have Paul Frees. How about Thurl Ravenscroft, that famous bass who voiced Tony the Tiger and sang “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch”?\n\nSure enough, he voices the moving mouth that Winterbolt uses every time he has a question. Alright, we’re two for two. How about Don Messick, the voice of Scooby-Doo?\n\nMessick voices Sam Spangles, the character on the far left there whose design is clearly based on the evil magician from Frosty the Snowman. Alright, let’s see if we can get a perfect score. Tell me, is Hans Conried, the voice of Captain Hook, in this special?\n\nSeriously? No Hans Conried? Alright, well the search for the perfect four-for-four continues, but now surely we’ve all had enough alcohol to get back to this ridiculous special.\n\nWhen the thousand years were over, Winterbolt awoke from his sleep and the Lady Boreal’s human form was waning. She left her last bit of power in a young reindeer, telling him his nose would only remain lit if he only used it for good. Winterbolt, jealous of Santa’s power, conspired to stop him by causing the worst storm the world had ever seen. However, as we all know, Rudolph’s nose shone brightly through the storm, causing Santa to make his flight anyway. Now it’s July, and Winterbolt doesn’t want to wait to Christmas to try to defeat Santa again.\n\nDo you see the problem here? This is a special for children. Why do we get this epic backstory for a special involving Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer? Was Rankin/Bass jealous they never got to make a full-fledged Lord of the Rings? Hey kids, the story of Rudolph is a great tale about overcoming insecurities, but more importantly, it’s about a war between two gods.\n\nAlso, the Lady Boreal gives Rudolph this gift at birth! How is he supposed to remember the words he was told when he was just seconds old? Even worse, she tells him that the nose will go out if he is even tempted just once. He doesn’t even have to do anything wrong, just be tempted. Look Rankin/Bass, you already did The Little Drummer Boy. Why does Rudolph have to be the Messiah in this thing? I guess that means since Santa came to the North Pole before Rudolph’s birth, that makes him John the Baptist and Frosty’s multiple resurrections make him Lazarus.\n\nSo now our story finally gets going. Rudolph and Frosty meet up with the recycled Fred Astaire puppet from Santa Claus is Coming to Town, who comes to tell them MORE EXPOSITION.\n\nThey’re calling the character Milton this time around, and he’s voiced by Red Buttons. Milton is an ice cream man who keeps his stash up at the North Pole to keep it cold all year long (just go with it), and he’s in love with a circus performer whose show is going broke. If their big July 4th show is a flop, they’re going to sell to Sam Spangles. Since Rudolph is apparently a worldwide celebrity, he agrees to go with Milton and help get the circus back on its feet. Frosty and family want to go as well, but it takes them way longer than it should to realize they’re snow-people and they would melt. Frosty says he feels like a misfit, leading Crystal to sing “Everything I’ve Always Wanted,” the one good song in the whole thing. It doesn’t need to be there (Okay, none of the songs save “Rudolph” and “Frosty” need to be here), but it’s got a really pleasant tune and it doesn’t go on too long. It’s also the first thing in about twenty minutes that isn’t just plot exposition, so maybe it’s just placed nicely, but it works.\n\nSince the biblical metaphors weren’t heavy enough already, it’s time for Frosty the Snowman to make a deal with the Devil. (Who knew? I could have put this on my Faustian Tales Match-Up.)\n\nWinterbolt comes and gives the Frosty family amulets that will keep them frozen until the final firework on the 4th of July. No one finds it suspicious that this obviously evil sorcerer who no one has ever heard of has given them temporary life that will end at a bizarrely specific time, so they just go with it.\n\nThey go to Santa, and via Winterbolt’s mind control, he says he will come down to pick them up right as the fireworks end. This is of course so Winterbolt can cause a storm that will stop Santa in his tracks, but if you have the power of mind control, why don’t you just have Santa move? I suppose he has that very common plot-relevant mind control. We also get a scene where Santa and Mrs. Claus discuss their marriage, and they both admit Santa is sometimes a bit too focused on work this time of year, because they’ve got Mickey Rooney back and he’s getting his minimum screen time.\n\nFinally we get to the circus where we meet the special’s second most important character, Ethel Merman.\n\nShe has a character name, but it’s just Ethel Merman. Ethel runs the circus, and is also the mother of Milton’s girlfriend. She seems to have mixed feelings about Milton, as she makes fun of his job in one scene but calls him “yummy” in another. We get plenty of scenes of the circus performers preparing the tent, parading around town, and performing their acts, because it’s Ethel Merman and we need to make her sing… FOUR FREAKING SONGS. That’s right, Ethel Merman has four musical numbers in this thing. Enough of these boring characters, what’s Winterbolt up to?\n\nHe’s going to the Cave of Lost Rejections, sort of the Mos Eisley Cantina of the Rankin/Bass Universe, to find the most evil reindeer in existence. We also get to see how awkward Winterbolt’s ridiculously hammy antics would be in a normal conversation.\n\nI get they’re trying to make this look like a seedy bar, but one of the patrons is a bird with an afro and sunglasses (I’d show him but it’s just a split second and too darkly lit). Did you just throw all the leftover pieces onto one puppet?\n\nWinterbolt finally tracks down the reindeer he’s looking for.\n\nThis is Scratcher, voiced by Laugh-In‘s Alan Sues. He’s not evil, but rather just lazy and self-serving. He’s also a campy gay stereotype right out of the ’40s… and that’s the whole joke. Scratcher claims he was going to be one of Santa’s reindeer until Rudolph came along (although he’s never been mentioned before), leading to Scratcher’s downward spiral. Is it strange that I’d much rather watch a Lost Weekend style special about his descent into reindeer alcoholism way more than I would this film? Seriously, though, how many characters need to be in this thing?\n\nWinterbolt’s extremely convoluted plan surprisingly goes off without a real hitch. Scratcher gets a job with the circus and goes into the trailer with Rudoph and (unbeknownst to Rudolph) gives him the money to hand to a police officer, who is actually Sam Spangles undercover.\n\nEven though he didn’t willingly do anything wrong, the temptation causes Rudolph’s nose to go out. Santa gets caught in the storm and Frosty realizes he and his family are about to die. He tries to get Ethel Merman to stop the fireworks, but they’ve already begun and it’s too late. Winterbolt comes back and says he can make Frosty’s amulets last longer if Rudolph agrees to let his nose stay dim and never tell anyone what actually happened (Yeah the thing contradicts itself, but that’s what happens when your Christmas special has more plot points than The Big Sleep.)\n\nWinterbolt flies back to the North Pole and Frosty tries to find a way to help Rudolph, who has now wandered off alone. Winterbolt asks his magic ice mirror if Frosty does have anything he’d want, so he gets shown the Reader’s Digest condensed version of the Frosty the Snowman special (just now with claymation) and learns of Frosty’s life-giving hat. I have to admit, I love how this special interrupts its darkest moments to sing an upbeat rendition of “Frosty the Snowman.” It really shouldn’t work, but for some reason, it does. The genie tells him that if he found a way to harness the hat’s powers, he could create an army of killer snowmen.\n\nFor being an eons-old villain, he really is kind of riding by the seat of his pants with this evil plan.\n\nSince there are still twenty minutes left in this thing, Winterbolt goes back to the circus and says if Frosty gives him his hat, he’ll turn Rudolph’s nose back on (Something he can’t do, but Frosty doesn’t have to know.) Frosty gives him the hat back and freezes, but for some reason the amulet stays on so he doesn’t melt.\n\nMeanwhile, Rudolph has gone off to the beach and heard the Aurora Borealis vaguely telling him to “Be brave.” He also runs into his old buddy Big Ben, the Clockwork Whale, from Rudolph’s Shiny New Year. It’s a pretty shoehorned cameo, but Ben is voiced by the hilarious radio star Harold Peary (famous for playing The Great Gildersleeve), so he at least brings some lightness to this surprisingly dark Christmas special.\n\nBen gets an idea and swims off to South America, while Rudolph goes back to the circus and finds Frosty dead and Winterbolt maniacally laughing. The two of them fight for the hat, and this brave act of violence causes Rudolph’s nose to come back. Rudolph puts the hat back on Frosty, thankfully never telling him his sacrifice was in vain, and explains the whole story to Ethel Merman. The real policeman (an Irish stereotype, of course) comes and arrests Sam Spangles and gives the money back to Ethel. Frosty and Rudolph sing “We’re a Couple of Misfits” from Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, and just as the special seems to be over, Winterbolt comes back. Ethel Merman pulls out her guns to shoot him, but she is informed that the circus guns only have blanks. Instead, she chucks the guns at him, breaking his staff. Winterbolt cries out “If the scepter dies, I go too” and turns into a tree. Yay, violence saves the day twice in the third act, kids.\n\nHowever, since Winterbolt is dead, his amulets are no good anymore and the Frosty family melts. HOW ARE WE NOT DONE YET? Big Ben swims back with Jack Frost (he was in one of the specials at some point), who was in South America for their winter. Jack blows a chilly winter breeze and brings the snowmen back to life.\n\nSanta finally comes to town and takes the Frosties back to the North Pole as Jack Frost spends all his breath keeping them alive. Everyone at the circus eats some of Santa’s reindeer feed (for reindeer, not made of reindeer), causing it to become a flying circus. THE END.\n\nWhat a mess this thing is. The plot is ridiculously convoluted, and it feels like each scene introduces (or re-introduces) a new character. We get seemingly pointless scenes of characters talking about their marriages, moping because their powers have gone out, Viagra-esque amulets that give Frosty power… Hold on. Is this whole thing about impotence?\n\nMaybe I’ve just watched one too many bad Christmas specials, but hear me out. All three male heroes (Rudolph, Frosty, and Santa) feel indebted to a woman in their lives—Frosty with Crystal, Santa with Mrs. Claus, and Rudolph with the Lady Boreal. They all take considerable amounts of time wondering if they are good enough to please these women. Both Frosty and Rudolph have magical powers that give them life, and Frosty is given amulets that extended his potency for a few hours. One of the first things we see happen in the circus grounds is the workers literally pitching a tent.\n\nRudolph’s nose only goes out when he is alone with the ambiguously gay reindeer in the dark trailer. The villain is indebted to no one and derives all of his power from his large phallic scepter. When he ultimately dies, he turns into a limp tree. And what ultimately saves the day at the end? A sperm whale.\n\nSo is this thing secretly brilliant? Probably not, but it’s still a fun theory. As silly as this whole thing is, I can’t hate it. It’s clear Rankin/Bass just decided to go all out with this one, and while the final product is insane, it’s enjoyably insane. Winterbolt is hysterically over-the-top, even going as far as to pronounce “evil” with emphasis on the second syllable. He also delivers perhaps my favorite line in the history of Christmas cinema: “I must rid my north lands of this ho-ho-hoing creature and his flock of Christmas interlopers.” Surely voice actor Paul Frees knew this was a dumb line and just went for it.\n\nAlso, basically every returning character is voiced by their original actor. Rankin/Bass managed to get more and more stars with each special, so there are a lot of them in this one. Jackie Vernon’s voice works really well for Frosty the Snowman, even though Vernon’s own comedy was usually very dry and sarcastic. Thankfully, Frosty has also gotten progressively smarter with each special, making him much more enjoyable to watch than scene after scene of Rudolph moping around. There is, however, far too much Ethel Merman. FOUR SONGS? FOUR?\n\nThe pointless songs aside, it’s by far the most enjoyable special I’ve watched so far. It’s just such a big dumb fun mess… that may or may not be about impotence.\n\nHOME"
