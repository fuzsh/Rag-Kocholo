        "text": "Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc. (founded as Videocraft International, Ltd. and later known as Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment) was an American production company, known for its seasonal television specials, particularly its work in stop motion animation. Rankin/Bass stop-motion features are recognizable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts, and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called \"Animagic\". Often, traditional cel animation scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall.\n\nNearly all of the studio's animation was outsourced to at least five Japanese animation companies: MOM Production, Toei Animation, TCJ (Television Corporation of Japan), Mushi Production and Topcraft.\n\nFranchises[]\n\nTitle\n\nRelease date\n\nProducer/Director\n\nJapanese studio/company\n\nProduction country\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 1964–1979 Larry Roemer (director)\n\nArthur Rankin, Jr. (producer) MOM Production/Video Tokyo Production (1964–1979)\n\nDentsu (1964)\n\nTopcraft (1976) United States\n\nCanada\n\nJapan The Little Drummer Boy 1968–1976 Arthur Rankin, Jr.\n\nJules Bass MOM Production/Video Tokyo Production United States\n\nJapan Frosty the Snowman 1969–1979 Arthur Rankin, Jr.\n\nJules Bass Mushi Production (1969)\n\nTopcraft (1976)\n\nVideo Tokyo Production (1979) United States\n\nJapan Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town 1970–1977 Arthur Rankin, Jr.\n\nJules Bass Video Tokyo Production United States\n\nJapan\n\nFilmography[]\n\nTelevision Series and Specials[]\n\nTitle\n\nRelease date\n\nProducer/Director\n\nJapanese studio/company\n\nAnimation technique\n\nProduction country\n\nThe New Adventures of Pinocchio 1960–1961 Arthur Rankin, Jr. MOM Production\n\nDentsu \"Animagic\" (stop motion animation) United States\n\nCanada\n\nJapan Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 1964 Larry Roemer (director)\n\nArthur Rankin, Jr. (producer) MOM Production\n\nDentsu \"Animagic\" (stop motion animation) United States\n\nCanada\n\nJapan The King Kong Show 1966–1969 William J.
