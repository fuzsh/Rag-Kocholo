        "text": "Out of print in this 15th Anniversary Edition.\n\nFrom the publisher:\n\nArthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass are best-known for producing some of the most popular animated holiday TV specials ever aired, including the long-running Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, The Year Without a Santa Claus and The Hobbit. They have also brought us animated feature films including Mad Monster Party and The Last Unicorn, and cartoon series such as ThunderCats, The Jackson Five, and SilverHawks.\n\nThis definitive, authorized history and celebration of Rankin/Bass animation documents every one of their productions with rare photographs, production stills, concept drawings and memorabilia, along with extensive commentary by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and dozens of the artists, actors and animators he worked with.\n\nIn 2012, this book has been taken to a new level of quality, under the guidance of Arthur Rankin, Jr. Fifteen years of newly discovered Rankin/Bass material has been added to the new 296 page book, many pages in color and beautifully designed by Wes Garlatz.\n\n\"Since the release of my original book, I have collected hundreds of photographs, model sheets, collectibles and more, many of which are included in this new, 15th Anniversary edition. We also cover many of the collectibles that came out during the original run of the specials and series and the hundreds (if not thousands) of items that were released after my original book. When putting together this new book, I didn't want to settle for what I have done in the past, I wanted to create a book that was spectacular. Something that people would be \"wowed\" with! We have included several new chapters. One about the creation of ANIMAGIC, Rankin/Bass' trademark style of animation. Another called \"Where Are The Animagic Figures Today\", featuring detailed photos of the original Rankin/Bass puppets in their current state, and an art section with wonderful artwork by Patrick Owsley, Jim Engel, Matt Pott, Chris Mason and many, many more!\" says Rick Goldschmidt.\n\nBook Features:"
