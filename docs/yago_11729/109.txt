The weekend after his passing, Rankin/Bass historian/Biographer Rick Goldschmidt and designer Wes Garlatz discovered what was Arthur's original scrapbook kept at Dentsu studios in Japan from 1959-1961, when he began his first Animagic production of The New Adventures of Pinocchio (A syndicated TV series in the same stop-motion animation style of Rudolph) In this book, you get the entire never-before-seen scrapbook complete with RARE behind-the-scenes photographs, articles (some in Japanese), clippings, notes and even Arthur's original Videocraft International business card.
