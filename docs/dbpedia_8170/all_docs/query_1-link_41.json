        "text": "This paper discusses a group of illuminated manuscripts commissioned in the last quarter of 13th century by two illegitimate brothers of king Hetum I of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia: prince Vasak and archbishop John. Vasak and John where the sons of a certain Beatrice who was of Frankish descent. These half-Franc princes manifested an evident western orientation in their political and religious life, and this paper will examine the western-inspired style and iconography of the illuminations of Gospel Books commissioned by them. These manuscripts will be discussed in comparison with other royal Gospels of the same period commissioned by the Chalcedonian and pro-Byzantine Armenians of the kingdom, including queen Keran and king Levon I, whose artistic choices remained faithful to Byzantine traditions. The miniature portraits of the royal commissioners will be discussed to better understand these enigmatic personalities and showing their preferences and unique taste by better understanding the environment in which they were brought up and lived.\n\nThe article is based on a report given at the Third Byzantine Studies Conference in New York, November l977. Its intention is both to announce or publicize the most important segment of the Index of Armenian Art (IAA) devoted to manuscript illumination and explain its contents and focus. The text also provides information on the first two volumes or fascicles of the IAA published in 1977 and 1979 devoted respectively to a comprehensive and illustrated corpus of illustration of all illuminated manuscripts up to the year 1000 and a checklist for the eleventh century. The database, digitized some fifteen years ago, is available more or less as it was first issued including lacunae in the scanned images at http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/iaa_miniatures/database.aspx. The IAA will soon have a European relay at the University of Hamburg with the goal of extending its scope while completing and correcting existing data stored on the site.\n\nByzantine arms and armour were researched by many historians. For this reason, Byzantine military history received a dominant position in medieval historiography that provoked the situation, where the military history of small nations (under Roman influences) was written from the Byzantine perspective. So, our task is to change this conception and bring medieval Armenian military sphere to light. The idea is to analyse the relief on the door of Msho Arakelots monastery where four equestrians and one infantryman are depicted make comparisons with other Armenian, Byzantine and Muslim sources. Unfortunately, Armenian written sources are less important for us because they give only general information about weapons and armour without their detailed description. In this relief spherical mace head and sword with sleeve cross-guard are presented which have many parallels with Byzantine archaeological and figurative sources. No less important is the depiction of the military trumpet because it is the first image of this object in Armenian art, which we can compare to pictures from Madrid Skylitzes (XII c.). In addition, the only defensive weapon, which is presented in this relief, is round shield with flower ornament. We have many depictions of round shields in Armenian miniatures and reliefs from X–XI c. Moreover, this relief is one of the few where stirrups and chape of the scabbard are shown. It is important information because these pictures can be compared with other Byzantine archaeological sources to reconstruct their real look. The conclusions are that the majority of Armenian weapons have similarities to the Byzantine one but no less important are Muslim influences which we have found in some examples. Located between two civilizations (Byzantine and Muslim), Armenians adopted the best examples of military sphere creating their own culture. Moreover, thanks to the comparative analysis we will prove the idea that medieval figurative sources is a good and more or less accurate source for studying medieval military history and our research will serve as evidence for this.\n\nA specific place among the works of priest Yovhannēs, one of the most famous scribes of the 17th century Amida scriptorium, belongs to two similar manuscripts, CBL 551 and M 10772. Their text comprises the genealogy and a list of succession of rulers in biblical history, in which the most important place is reserved for the genealogy of Christ. Trees and other diagrams give the material visual form, and the texts attached to them contain explanations. Specific features of the manu- scripts are: the systematized structure of the genealogical tree, pictorial elements and various ornamentations of the text, as well as the vertical use of the writing space; in the case of CBL 551 it is also the accordion book format. Genealogical works appeared in Armenian literature already in its formative period, whereas manuscripts with such contents are known starting in the 14th cen- tury. Our study revealed that the text is a translation from Latin of the Compendium historiae in genealogia Christi by the French theologian and chancellor of the Church of Paris Peter of Poitiers (ca. 1130-1205). Nevertheless, the manuscripts in question contain additional pictorial elements, which, according to our observa- tions, belong to scribe Yovhannēs."
