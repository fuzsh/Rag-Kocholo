        "text": "For Byzantium the relationship and the cohabitation with the Islamic-Turkish world are inexorable necessity to know and to understand the last centuries of the Greek Empire. Nevertheless at the beginning of 14 th Century the process of formation of Turkish emirates in the Western lands of Asia Minor meant an absolute novelty for the political and religious scene of Byzantium. Necessary and constant exchanges, the aggressive policy of the numerous emirates, the need to rely on them to work out the institutional muddle of the civil wars have been reasons of acceleration of the phenomenon which have finally led to the end of the Empire. Obviously other elements – seemingly unrelated – have contributed: the convulsive development of the palamitic debate, the social changes and the troubled relationship with the Latin World are only the main factors. To be interested to the perception of the Turkish danger is a necessary engagement to fully understand the 14 th Century. We must consider that the main figures who debated about the Islamic-Turkish matters are the same who played an important role in the religious and political life at that time (John VI Cantacuzenus, Gregory Palamas, Callistus I patriarch). But there are some other factors for the urgency of the study we offer. First of all the renewed interest that it finds in the scientific literature. Then we have to consider the lack of comprehensive studies available on the matter. The Khoury's works, for now the summa for everyone who likes to approach the byzantine antislamic controversy, don't deal with 14 th Century authors or writings. The convergence of these three elements (relevance of the matter, renewed interest and lack of comprehensive studies) have persuaded us to take up this matter. Our work is divided into five parts: the presentation of four dossiers and a conclusion that revalues and upgrades the materials we gathered. Indeed other sources have allowed us to enlarge the objective of our observations. So we have been able to define a significant overview. First of all we have selected four areas of research according to the importance and dimension of the available works. So we have focused our attention on authors and documents relating to the middle of 14 th Century: documents from the archives of the\n\nThe GRS, better known as the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, deals with the period from the fifth to the mid-twelfth century and an area which includes modern Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and part of Albania, in other words the historical region of Western Illyricum. The Chronicle begins with a reference to Emperor Anastasius and concludes with a mention of Emperor Manuel I. The fact that the Chronicle begins and ends with two Byzantine emperors is not surprising, since Byzantium played a significant role in the area during the period under discussion, either as an actual suzerain or as a titular one. However, despite Byzantium’s importance in the area, the Priest of Duklja rarely mentions the Byzantines within his Chronicle. He often neglects to name the emperors, while sometimes he confuses either individuals or events. Generally speaking, the image that is drawn for Byzantium by the rare mentions is that the Empire never played a significant role in the area. The aim of this paper is to show how the Priest of Duklja perceived the Byzantines, as well as the reasons behind this perception, in other words the “how” and “why” of the Byzantine presence in the Chronicle.\n\nThis book brings to light one of the least known, yet most turbulent periods in the history of the Armenian military and its complex relationship with the Byzantine Empire. In its first part, Armen Ayvazyan embarks on a military-historical analysis of the Armenian uprising against Emperor Justinian’s government in 538-539. While revealing and evaluating various tactical elements and stratagems employed by the Armenian forces, he carefully considers earlier and later evidence regarding their military operations, including both conventional warfare and high risk missions such as targeted killings of enemy commanders-in-chief and assassination plots against the heads of colonial administrations. And in the second part, Ayvazyan examines the Byzantine attitudes towards the Armenians and their armed forces, revealing, inter alia, that the underlying source for continuity of the anti-Armenian images with the analogous Roman tradition of prejudice was essentially geopolitical. \"The Armenian Military in the Byzantine Empire: Conflict and Alliance under Justinian and Maurice\" can be read page per page at: https://www.calameo.com/read/000260618b56f011005a3"
