        "text": "Citation preview\n\nTWO NEW WITNESSES TO THE ACTA PILATI TRADITION* A manuscript from Vienna important for the transmission of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas has also proven an intriguing source for traditions related to the Acta Pilati cycle of texts. The cycle includes several versions of the Acts of Pilate (or Gospel of Nicodemus as it is known in medieval Latin manuscripts), the Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea, the Vindicta Salvatoris, as well as several letters of Pilate and reports of his death1. Also related are a number of medieval sermons that draw upon either the cycle or common sources. Some of these sermons have yet to receive comprehensive treatment from scholars. When such a treatment materializes, the Vienna manuscript will have a role to play in establishing critical editions of two texts: In sancta et magna Parasceue et in sanctam passionem Domini (On the Passion, for the Preparation Day = BHGa 635b; CPG 5526) attributed to Eusebius of Alexandria, and a previously unknown sermon detailing the burial of Jesus and the imprisonment of Joseph of Arimathea. The manuscript is cataloged as Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Cod. hist. gr. 91, (pap., 220/225 × 150 mm, 208 fols.) of the 14th or 15th century2. It contains a variety of texts, including NT excerpts (e.g., Luke 7:216 fol. 22r-22v), homilies (e.g., by Cyril of Alexandria, John Chrysostom, and others), sermons, hagiographica, and other miscellaneous texts (the Abgar Correspondence, various chronicles and church histories), many of which are without titles. The version of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas found in the manuscript belongs to the Greek A recension established by Tischendorf; indeed, it is the only known complete witness to the recension – all other manuscripts, including those used by Tischendorf, lack significant portions of the text3. Until recently, the manuscript was * My thanks to Jack Horman, Andrew Bernhard, and Sarah Veale for their assistance in constructing the Greek editions of the two texts featured here. 1 For an accessible discussion of the various texts along with English translations see Ehrman – Pleše, Apocryphal Gospels, p. 419-585. A more thorough treatment can be found in Izydorczyk, Nicodemus’ Gospel. See also Geerard, CANT 64-78, as well as the Garshuni texts “Lament of the Virgin” and “Martyrdom of Pilate”, in Mingana, Woodbrooke Studies, 2, p. 163-332; and the Georgian Story of Joseph in van Esbroeck, L’histoire de Lydda, p. 119-127. 2 For a complete description of the manuscript see Hunger, Katalog, vol. 1, p. 94102. 3 The first mention of the manuscript in connection to Infancy Thomas was made by Noret, Pour une édition.

On the Passion, for the Preparation Day4 The first of the two texts under examination has been known in scholarship for centuries5. It is one among a group of homilies attributed to Eusebius of Alexandria, four of which have parallels of content with the Acta Pilati tradition6. Upon its initial publication, On the Passion was placed among the spuria of John Chrysostom7, due to the information provided in the incipit of the manuscript used by Henry Saville in 16128. Saville did not reveal full details of this manuscript, only that it was from Vienna (he called it “ms. Caesareo”). Guy Lafontaine believed it to be either theol. gr. 247 or theol. gr. 263, both of which attribute the text to Chry­ sostom9. Saville’s edition was reproduced a century later in Bernard de Montfaucon’s collection of Chrysostom’s works10. The determination that the text should belong to the corpus of Ps.-Eusebius was made by J.C. Thilo in 183211. Thilo wrote in objection to Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti’s position that three of the Ps.-Eusebius sermons (numbered 13, 14, and 15) should instead be credited to another Eusebius: Eusebius of Emesa12. Thilo included in his refutation a reproduction of Saville/Montfaucon’s Comprehensive treatment is found in Burke, De infantia Iesu, p. 131-132 and ChartrandBurke, Greek Manuscript Tradition, p. 138. 4 Greek text and translation, below p. 260-267. 5 Comprehensive overviews of the publishing history of the text can be found in Leroy – Glorie, ‘Eusèbe d’Alexandrie’, and Gounelle, Collectio Sermonum, p. 249-272. Lafontaine, La version arménienne, contains the clearest discussion of the text’s early publishing history and includes a detailed list of the known Greek manuscripts. 6 The other three are On “Art Thou He That Should Come?”, On the Coming of John into Hades, and On the Devil and Hades. For an initial discussion of the four homilies see McCulloch, Harrowing of Hell, p. 174-191. 7 See de Aldama, Repertorium Pseudochrysostomicum, Nr. 489. 8 Saville, S. Ioannis Chrysostomi opera, graece, vol. 7, p. 459-462. 9 Lafontaine, La version arménienne, p. 99 and also Noret, Un fragment homilétique, p. 172, n. 1. Only a comparison of Saville’s edition to the Vienna manuscripts will resolve this issue. For catalog entries see Hunger et al., Katalog, p. 161-169 and 212-215. Saville’s own copy of the text made from the unnamed manuscript is available at the Bodleian Library (Oxford, Bodl. Libr., Auct. E. 3. 8).

A revised edition of Montfaucon’s study appeared soon after and incorporated some of Thilo’s notes and variants14. This second edition was used for Migne’s PG (62, col. 721-724). In both works, however, the homily is featured among works of Ps.-Chrysostom, not Ps.-Eusebius. A number of additional Greek manuscripts of On the Passion have been mentioned in subsequent scholarship. Angelo Mai published another edition of the sermons based on Vat. gr. 1633 from the 10th/11th century; however, he did not include Sermon 17 because the text had already been edited15. F. Nau discussed another manuscript – Paris, suppl. grec 407, fol. 203-206; copied 1592 – which is said to be identical to Mai’s manuscript16. M. Gronewald has published a fragmentary sixth-century papyrus17. And a 12th/13th-century fragment (MS 3219, fol. 209) at the National Library of Scotland, published initially by I.C. Cunningham18, was identified as belonging to On the Passion by Jacques Noret19. Noret mentioned also a manuscript with similar readings at Lesbos: Μονὴ Ὑψηλοῦ 57, fol. 217-219. In the course of his discussion, Noret characterized Cunningham’s Edinburgh manuscript as superior in value to the Vienna manu­script used in previous editions of the text. Virtually all of these additional sources and many more are presented in a comprehensive list of 47 manu­ scripts made by Guy Lafontaine20. The text is available also in languages other than Greek, including Latin21, Armenian22, Arabic23, and Slavic24. Clearly much work has yet to be done to establish the text of the sermon. 13 Thilo identifies the manuscript only as “Vind”; the identification of the manuscript as theol. gr. 307 is made in Lafontaine, La version arménienne, p. 100. 14 de Montfaucon, Editio parisina, vol. 11, p. 867-871. 15 Mai, Spicilegium Romanum. 16 Nau, Notes. 17 Gronewald, Kein durchtriebener Räuber. 18 Cunningham, Greek Manuscripts, p. 369. 19 Noret, Un fragment homilétique. 20 Lafontaine, La version arménienne, p. 100-101. Two of these manuscripts are listed in BHG: Cod. Athen. 273 and Cod. Paris, 979, but BHG adds also Cod. Athen. Constamon. 14. A few others are mentioned in Thilo’s introduction to his edition (Thilo, Eusebius von Alexandrien, p. 30-32). 21 It is found combined with Sermon 15 (De Confusione Diaboli) in an Old Latin manuscript of the 5th/6th century published by Rand, Sermo; see further, Izydorczyk, Two Newly Identified Manuscripts. And J. Leroy and F. Glorie note another witness in Vat. lat. 3835-3836, though here it is attributed to Augustine (Leroy – Glorie, ‘Eusèbe d’Alexandrie’, p. 50-51 and reproduced p. 67-70 with readings from two other manuscripts: Vat. lat. 3828 and 1270). 22 Lafontaine, La version arménienne. 23 Sauget, Une ébauche d’homéliaire copte, p. 196, n. 37. 24 Hannick, Maximos Holobolos, p. 263.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 253\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\n254\n\nt. burke\n\nFor a start, the precise contents of each manuscript must be established; this has led to great confusion in the literature and makes difficult the process of situating new manuscripts in the transmission history of the text. The presence of On the Passion in Vienna, Cod. hist. gr. 91 has not been previously noted. Hunger’s catalog merely refers to the text as “Apokryphes Fragment über die Aufnahme des rechten Schächers im Paradise” (about the admission of the Good Thief into Paradise). The fragment contains roughly the last quarter of the text. On the Passion begins with a brief account of the betrayal, arrest, trial, scourging, and crucifixion of Jesus. The Devil witnesses these events and fears the arrival of Jesus; so, he closes the gates to Hades. The Powers (angels) and prophets call for him to open the gates. Then Jesus approaches, tears down the gates, binds the Devil, and casts him down to the lowest parts of Hades. At this point the Vienna manuscript takes up the story. The prophets enter Paradise, see the Good Thief and wonder why he has preceded them. The thief responds with the story of his encounter with Jesus on the cross and his subsequent entry into Paradise where he encountered Enoch and Elijah. The text concludes with a restatement of Jesus’ victory over the Devil. The following edition of On the Passion presents the text of the Vienna manuscript with readings from Migne’s edition (represented by the siglum M) provided in the apparatus for comparison. The Vienna manuscript differs from Migne’s text in several significant ways; at paragraph 3 (line 10-11) it lacks the prophets’ concern that the thief will steal in heaven as he did on earth; paragraph 5 (line 18) lacks the explicit parallel to Luke 23:43; and the conclusion in paragraph 9 differs considerably. 2. On the Funeral of Jesus25 The second text in the Vienna manuscript fills two pages (fol. 18r18v), beginning mid-sentence at an undetermined place in the narrative and running to the doxology that concludes the text. Likely it is a medieval homily similar in form and content to other such homilies that draw upon traditions from the Acta Pilati cycle. The homiletic character of the text is apparent in 1.5 where the narrator breaks into the story to ask why the face cloth was rolled up in a place by itself, and again at the close of the text (3.6) to indict the priests for not showing kindness to those who 25\n\nGreek text and translation, below p. 266-275.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 254\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\nTHE ACTA PILATI TRADITION\n\n255\n\nbelieved in Jesus. Unfortunately, neither the title of the text nor the name of its author is known; Hunger’s catalog refers to it only as “Anonyme. Fragment über die Bestattung Jesu Christi”. The Acts of Pilate, the prime text of the Acta Pilati cycle, is extant in two forms: Greek A and B26. Greek A is believed to be the earliest, dating perhaps to the fourth century. It presents a new telling of the trial of Jesus (chs. 1-9), augmenting the canonical accounts with detailed testimony against Jesus and reports of witnesses who speak in his defense. Then, after a quick recounting of the crucificion (chs. 10-11), the text turns its attention to Joseph of Arimathea, who is imprisoned by the Jewish leaders as a Christian sympathizer. But when the leaders return to retrieve Joseph from his cell, he is gone (ch. 12). Reports then come in of Jesus’ resurrection – first from the guards at the tomb (ch. 13, recalling Matt 28:115), then from elders, priests and Levites who have seen Jesus and his disciples in Galilee (ch. 14). The Jewish leaders search for Jesus without success but find Joseph, who reports to them how Jesus appeared to him in his cell and transported him home (ch. 15). This tale of Joseph’s imprisonment and miraculous escape are expanded in another Acta Pilati cycle text: the Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea. The Greek A text of the Acts of Pilate concludes with the Jewish leaders once again interrogating the witnesses to the resurrection; though the leaders remain resolute in their denial of Jesus’ divinity, the people as a whole are convinced and return to their homes glorifying God (ch. 16). The Greek B form of the text is believed to be a retrotranslation from the Latin A recension of the Gospel of Nicodemus, the title given to the Acts of Pilate in its Latin forms (divided into Latin A, B and C)27. The most significant departure in the Greek B text is the addition of the Descensus Christi ad inferos (chs. 17-27), in which two of the dead saints restored to life in Matt 27:52-54 report Jesus’ entry into Hell to redeem the righteous dead. There Jesus breaks open the gates, binds Satan, and brings the patriarchs, martyrs and ancestors to Paradise. On their way into Paradise they see Enoch and Elijah, who rose up to heaven body and soul (Gen 5:24; 2 Kgs 2:11; Heb 11:5), and the Good Thief, who Jesus promised would precede him in Paradise (Luke 23:42-43).\n\n26 Edited by Tischendorf, Evangelia Apocrypha, p. 210-286 (Greek A), 287-332 (Greek B). 27 Gounelle, Les recensions byzantines, has proposed a revision to Tischendorf’s sigla so that Greek B is now referred to as Greek M (for “Medieval”) and divided into three distinct recensions: M1 (created 9th-10th cent.), M2 (12th-14th cent.), and M3 (14th15th cent.).\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 255\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\n256\n\nt. burke\n\nOn the Funeral of Jesus begins with an unnamed figure, presumably Pilate, granting the body of Jesus to Joseph (cf. Acts Pil. 11.3)28. Nicodemus asks to be involved with preparing the body for burial, and the two do so in a sequence that incorporates passages from the canonical Passion accounts (1.2, 6). Jesus is referred to several times here as a “foreigner” (or perhaps “stranger”; 1.1, 3), perhaps because he is a Galilean in Judea, though this would be a peculiar appellation. If the text is here understood correctly, there seems to be some dispute about the appropriate burial responsibilities when it comes to foreigners; Nicodemus overhears the priests questioning whether a foreigner is to be buried “differently than a family member and heir”. They worry that granting Jesus such honours would bring “every dying foreigner into Jerusalem from the temples” looking for similar treatment (1.3). Nicodemus then goes to “request the delivery of the body of Jesus” (1.4) – an odd development given that Joseph and Nicodemus have already been granted the body. Indeed Nicodemus is not shown making the request, though he does obtain the face cloth (sudarium) mentioned in John 20:6-7 (1.5). Reference is made here of why the face cloth was “rolled up in a place by itself”; it appears that the face cloth was not accepted as part of the sacrifice of Jesus (because it is from the temple?). The text then continues, stating that Joseph and Nicodemus accepted the linen wrappings (othonia) as a “sacrifice and burnt offering” (1:5). The sudarium may appear later in the text, when Joseph is accused of taking “the shroud of the foreigner” from the temple (2.5), but note that here it is called an entafia (burial shroud). While Acts Pil. covers the event of Jesus’ burial, it does not do so in the detail we find here. The Greek A version mentions the request for the body and the burial only in passing (in ch. 11.3, though essentially just repeating Luke 23:50-53). Greek B offers more detail, but nothing is said of the burial cloths, nor the foreigner(s). Note also that the new text does not contain the subsequent laments of Mary and Mary Magdalene found in Greek B. Greek A Jesus’ acquaintances stood off at a distance, along with the women who accompanied him from Galilee, who saw these things. But acertain\n\nGreek B And as the day of the preparation was drawing towards evening, Joseph, a man well-born and rich, a Godfearing Jew, finding Nicodemus, whose\n\n28 Quotations from Acts Pil. and related texts are drawn from Ehrman – Pleše, Apocryphal Gospels, op. cit., except for the Greek B text, given in full only in Roberts – Donaldson, Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol. 8, p. 426-434.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 256\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\nTHE ACTA PILATI TRADITION\n\n257\n\nman, named Joseph, a member of the council from the city of Arimathea, who was anticipating the kingdom of God, approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. He took him down, wrapped him in a clean linen cloth, and placed him in a stonehewn tomb, where no one had ever been placed.\n\nsentiments his foregoing speech had shown, says to him: I know that thou didst love Jesus when living, and didst gladly hear his words, and I saw thee fighting with the Jews on his account. If, then, it seem good to thee, let us go to Pilate, and beg the body of Jesus for burial, because it is a great sin for him to lie unburied. I am afraid, said Nicodemus, lest Pilate should be enraged, and some evil should befall me. But if thou wilt go alone, and beg the dead, and take him, then will I also go with thee, and help thee to do everything necessary for the burial. Nicodemus having thus spoken, Joseph directed his eyes to heaven, and prayed that he might not fail in his request; and he went away to Pilate, and having saluted him, sat down. Then he says to him: I entreat thee, my lord, not to be angry with me, if I shall ask anything contrary to what seems good to your highness. And he said: And what is it that thou askest? Joseph says: Jesus, the good man whom through hatred the Jews have taken away to crucify, him I entreat that thou give me for burial. Pilate says: And what has happened, that we should deliver to be honoured again the dead body of him against whom evidence of sorcery was brought by his nation, and who was in suspicion of taking the kingdom of Caesar, and so was given up by us to death? And Joseph, weeping and in great grief, fell at the feet of Pilate, saying: My lord, let no hatred fall upon a dead man; for all the evil that a man has done should perish with him in his death. And I know your highness, how eager thou wast that Jesus should not be crucified, and how much thou saidst to the Jews on his behalf, now in entreaty and again in anger, and at last how thou didst wash thy hands, and declare that thou wouldst by no means take part with those who wished him to be put to death; for all which reasons I entreat thee not to refuse my request. Pilate, therefore, seeing Joseph thus lying, and supplicating, and weeping, raised him up, and said: Go, I grant thee this dead man; take him, and do whatever thou wilt. And then Joseph, having thanked Pilate, and kissed his hands and his garments, went forth, rejoicing indeed in heart as having obtained his desire, but carrying tears in his eyes. Thus also, though grieved, he was glad. Accordingly he goes away to Nicodemus, and discloses to him all that had happened. Then, having bought myrrh and aloes a hundred pounds, and a new tomb, they, along with the mother of God and Mary Magdalene and Salome, along with John, and the rest of the women, did what was customary for the body with white linen, and placed it in the tomb.\n\nJesus’ resurrection in On the Funeral is greeted by the priests and scribes with cries of “Horror, horror!” (2.1). They conspire to tell the people that Joseph and Jesus’ disciples stole Jesus’ body (2.2), thereby\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 257\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\n258\n\nt. burke\n\nevoking Matt 28:12-14, which is the basis also for the expanded scene of the interrogation of the guards in Acts Pil. 13. The people take Joseph to the high priests for questioning (2.3); Joseph defends himself by illustrating that he and the disciples would be unable to bypass the guards and break the seals on the tomb (2.4, evoking Matt 27:65-66). Joseph is then brought before Pilate, and the people lay out three charges: preparing Jesus’ body out of their (sic?) own means (recall the dispute in 1.3), taking the entafia from the temple, and stealing the body of Jesus and claiming he rose from the grave. In response, Pilate becomes angry at the delegation and, recalling the trial of Jesus, washes his hands of Joseph’s blood (1.6-7; cf. Matt 27:24). This episode has a partial parallel with Acts Pil. 12 (see also Narr. Jos. 1), in which Joseph is seized by “the Jews”, but only because they suspect he is a sympathizer since he asked for the body of Jesus. Joseph rebukes them, and he is imprisoned. But when they open the prison the next day, he has vanished. No mention is made in Acts Pil. of a trial before Pilate; indeed, the antagonists do not hear the news of the resurrection until the following chapter. In the text’s final episode, Joseph laments his fate in prison (3.1). Jesus appears, accompanied by the Good Thief of Luke 23:39-43 (3.2-3). Jesus then brings Joseph to Galilee so that he might “proclaim to [the disciples] his resurrection” (1.4); Joseph thus is presented in this text as the first witness to the resurrection of Jesus. When the priests discover Joseph’s absence, they lament their treatment of “those who believe in our Lord Jesus Christ” (3.6). It is in this final episode that we see the most significant parallels to the Acta Pilati tradition. In Acts Pil., Joseph disappears from prison in ch. 12 and then he is found in Arimathea in ch. 15. Joseph returns to Jerusalem and appears before the Sanhedrin. When asked about his disappearance, he says he was praying in prison and Jesus appeared to him, though Joseph first thought he was Elijah. Jesus took him to see the empty tomb, and then home to Arimathea where he is told to remain for 40 days while Jesus visits his disciples. Joseph does not proclaim the resurrection to the disciples, nor do we see the Good Thief. The only text to mention the thief in the prison scene is the Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea (ch. 4), a text that goes into great detail about the fate of the two thieves. Narr. Jos. also has Joseph journey with Jesus and the Good Thief to Galilee, not Arimathea, though they stay there only for a brief time, during which they speak to the apostle John. On the Funeral of Jesus is a curious mix of canonical and apocryphal traditions. The NT gospels provide information about Jesus’ burial preparations and location, as well as the germ for such details as the fate of the Good Thief, the guards at the tomb, and the portrayal of Pilate in the\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 258\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\nTHE ACTA PILATI TRADITION\n\n259\n\ntrial of Joseph. The Acta Pilati cycle provides the framework for the imprisonment and liberation of Joseph, but On the Funeral differs from Acts Pil. significantly in the details. The reason for the combination of these traditions is unclear. One can observe a certain anti-Semitism in the narrative in the way the priests treat Joseph and their resultant shame at the discovery of his absence; Nicodemus and Jesus tell Joseph not to fear the “threats of the Jews” (1.4; 3.2). But the Jews, on the whole, are largely innocent of wrongdoing – they only follow the directives of the priests and scribes, and the author of the text expresses his anger only at the priests (3.6). Similar treatment of Jewish culpability in the death of Jesus is found in Acts Pil.; indeed, the text even concludes with the people accepting the crucifixion, “if his rememberance extends until the year which is called Jubilee” (Acts Pil. 16.7). However, without the complete text of On the Funeral, it is difficult to determine the precise purpose of its portrayal of Joseph’s antagonists. There is more still about On the Funeral that is unclear. The Vienna manuscript presented some difficulties in transcription and translation. Some of this difficulty is due to iotacism, some to manuscript damage – note line 4 of 2.8, and lines 1 and 2 of 3.1. It is possible that some of the more troublesome readings (particularly in 1.3-5) result from scribal omission; certainly this has occurred in 2.2 (at line 1) where a word has dropped out of the text (τῇ ἡμέρᾳ). Undeniably, On the Funeral of Jesus is a fascinating text that warrants further exploration. It is a welcome addition to the corpus of homiletic literature inspired by the Acta Pilati traditions.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 259\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\n260\n\nt. burke\n\nText 1 Pseudo-Eusebius, Sermon 17 Τῇ ἁγίᾳ καὶ μεγάλῃ Παρασκευῇ εἰς τὸ ἅγιον πάθος τοῦ Κυρίου [1] (fol. 104r) . . . ἐπιγελῶντες αὐτόν1.

And the Lord, taking everyone2, led out of Hades first David (who was) playing the harp, saying, “Come3, let us sing to the Lord, that we may shout to the Lord our Saviour that our king, waging war, has conquered”4. And everyone said5 hallelujah. [2] Again (he said), “Let all the peoples clap their hands and shout to God in a joyful voice”6. Thus they went7 joyfully into Paradise. “Rejoice greatly, daughter Zion, and after a little, awaken Jerusalem to enter your glory, where your king, waging war, has conquered”8. [3] Going in to Paradise9, they found the thief and they said10 to him, “Who are you?11 Who brought you here? And who opened the gates to you? What have you done that you have entered here before us?”12.\n\n1 The fragment begins just after Jesus has bound the Devil and cast him down to the lowest parts of Hades. 2 M has “all the prophets”. 3 For “first…‘Come’” M reads: “saying, ‘Go into Paradise’”.

Then M adds: “because the king above us waging war, conquered”. 7 M has “ran”. 8 It is not clear who is the speaker here; it may even be the homilist.

This foreigner. And I was outside the synagogue just as the priests were saying that, ‘We do not prepare a foreigner himself for burial differently than a family member and heir. Do you understand that his delivery would bring every dying foreigner into Jerusalem from the temples?’”6. [4] Nicodemus said, “Fear not Joseph, because of the snares and threats of the Jews. I shall go to the temple and I shall request the delivery of the body of Jesus and (ask) also about the other foreigners”. Joseph said, “Go quickly”. [5] Nicodemus went to the temple and brought the face cloth that was on his head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself 7. Why by itself? Because it was from the temple and he did not accept in sacrifice but only his own linen wrappings, which Joseph and Nicodemus accepted as a sacrifice and a burnt offering. [6] After Nicodemus came from the temple, he placed the body of Jesus in the tomb of Joseph, which was hewn out of rock8 opposite the place of the skull9 where Christ was crucified. They rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb10 and returned each to his home. 2. [1] And after the third day of burial, at the third hour, the Lord rose. The priests and the scribes said, “Horror, horror! Why is this misery for us? Come then, let us say that Joseph and his disciples stole him, and that they say he rose from the dead. In addition, we will sentence Joseph to death so that the resurrection of Jesus will be forgotten as the pretext of Joseph”. [2] Making a plot, the priests and the scribes on the day of the Lord said to the synagogue of the Jews, “Listen, people of Israel, the promise of Jacob: Joseph of Arimathea did not want to come into our council, but to go with the nailed one, the enemy of us and of God and the law. He prepared him for burial in his garden and in his tomb. Then he devised with the disciples of Jesus and stole his body and they said that he rose from the dead”. 5 παράτυπος: LSJ has “counterfeit,” but in modern speech it means “irregularity.” The meaning here might be closer to τύπτω: “beat, strike.” 6 Matt 27:52-53?; Matt 21:14?; Luke 9:31. The temples mentioned here may be healing sites of Asclepius, abandoned by supplicants in search of more effective healing. Note, in Acts Pil. 1.1 the Jewish leaders state that “No one can cast out demons by an unclean spirit, but only the god Asclepius.” Healing plays a large part in the trial of Jesus (see Acts Pil. 2.6; 6.1-2, 7). 7 John 20:7. 8 Mark 15:46 par. 9 Mark 15:22 par / John 19:17. 10 Mark 15:46; Matt 27:60.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 269\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\n270\n\nt. burke\n\n[2] Συμβούλιον23 ποιήσαντες οἱ ἱερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς 24 τῇ κυριακῇ λέγουσι πρὸς τὴν συναγωγὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων · “Ἀκούσατε λαὸς τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ κληρονομία τοῦ Ἰακώβου Ἰωσὴϕ ὁ ἀπὸ Ἀριμαϑαίας οὐκ ἠϑέλησεν ἐλϑεῖν εἰς τὴν βουλὴν ἡμῶν ἀλλὰ μᾶλλον ἀπελϑεῖν ἀπὸ καϑήλωσιν τὸν ἐχϑρὸν ἡμῶν25 καὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ νόμου. καὶ ἐνεταϕίασεν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν κῆπον αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς τὸν τάϕον αὐτοῦ. εἶτα εὕρησε26 τοῖς μαϑηταὶς τοῦ Ἰησοῦ καὶ ἔκλεψαν τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγουσιν ὅτι ἀνέστη ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν”.

And the high priests said to him, “Why did you do this, O wrongdoer and transgressor of the law?” [4] Joseph answered and said, “O foolish and blind and shameless, are you not ashamed saying such things? Who wants to steal a dead body, especially one stripped bare? Where (are) the seals of the tomb, and the guard of Pilate11? How was the dead one carried off by lowly and shabby men? So, do not accuse”. [5] Hearing Joseph, the high priests and all the people and the entire synagogue were gnashing their teeth. They were very furious and, coming upon Joseph, they led him away by force to Pilate saying, “This man is a transgressor of the law. He took down the crucified one from the tree and prepared him for burial out of their own means. But also the burial shroud of the foreigner was brought from the temple. And, unsatisfied with such a shameless act, he devised also with the disciples of Jesus himself, and coming, they stole his body and said that he was risen from the dead”12. [6] Pilate, becoming furious, said to the Jews, speaking angrily in great anger, “O violence among you! Stubborn, hardhearted, and impious! Yesterday a disturbance happened and great confusion13.

And again today an assembly and disturbance (occurs) at the good thing accomplished. But I do not decide nor command about this”. [7] Then Pilate commanded and sent them away outside saying, “Go and do what you wish; see to it yourselves. I am innocent of this man’s blood and all my house”14. [8] The priests, coming out, went into the synagogue and locked Joseph in a dark prison, saying, “Tomorrow we will stone him as a wrongdoer”, placing faithful guards at the entrance of the prison, their slaves may not come in with the disciples of this very Jesus and carry him out from the prison. 3. [1] Joseph sat alone in the prison. And he cried bitterly, saying, “What advantage is there to me now from Jesus? Look! The 15 destroyed my friend, and likewise my soul is condemned to death, for tomorrow I will be stoned like a wrongdoer and I will die unjustly”. [2] As he was thinking these things, a great light shone and a voice came to him saying, “Fear not, Joseph, for I am with you. Do not be afraid of the threats of the Jews. Rise”. [3] Looking up, Joseph saw in the middle of the prison Jesus standing with the thief, holding the cross16. Discovering Jesus, he fell down at his feet saying, “Truly you are the son of the living God. Truly you were raised from the grave, so mighty and prevailing over all who despise you”. [4] Then Jesus, stretching out his right hand, took hold of Joseph and, bringing him out of the city, he led him to Galilee. And, after teaching him, he delivered him to his disciples so that he might proclaim to them his resurrection.\n\nMatt 27:24. Damage to the manuscript has obscured the text here. The missing word or partial word is about three letters long. The tail of a rho is visible, suggesting that the subject is “the priests”; however, the word must be a neuter plural. 16 Grammatically, Jesus is holding the cross, but the thief is often depicted holding his own cross (see Acts Pil.

The first is a fragment of On the Passion, for the Preparation Day, a sermon attributed to Eusebius of Alexandria drawing upon the Descensus ad inferos, found appended to several versions of the Acts of Pilate. The paper includes a transcription and translation of the fragment along with an overview of the publication history of the sermon. The second text is an unpublished, untitled excerpt from an unknown homily dealing with the burial of Jesus and the imprisonment of Joseph of Arimathea. This paper presents a diplomatic edition of the text with an English translation along with a discussion of its relationship to the Acts of Pilate and the related Narrative of Joseph of Arimathea.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_01_Burke.indd 278\n\n29/11/16 06:02\n\nA NEW CHRISTIAN PALESTINIAN ARAMAIC INSCRIPTION IN A MOSAIC PAVEMENT AT ḤURA, ISRAEL 1. The Site In a salvage excavation carried out near the entrance to the Bedouin township of Ḥura in the northern Negev, a monastery dated to the 6th7th centuries was recently discovered1. The site is located about 10 km north-west of Tell Masos, and is now the southernmost site possessing a Christian Palestinian Aramaic (hereafter CPA) inscription2. Additionally, the mosaic pavements of the monastery bear several Greek inscriptions and a bilingual Greek-CPA one3. The purpose of this article is to publish the CPA part of this inscription. The room in which the mosaic was laid is 5 × 3.7 m, with a crypt (found empty) in its center. The entrance to the room was through the southern wall. The mosaic includes a geometric design that could have been viewed from the entrance. The inscription on the other hand, set adjacent to the eastern wall, is set within the ‘border’ of the mosaic, and was to be seen and read when standing facing east [See Ill. 1]. The bilingual three-row’ inscription was laid inside a rectangular framework of 2.5 × 0.65 m [See Ill. 2]. The Greek part of the inscription occupies the entire two first rows and a third of the third row, and it commemorates the completion of the pavement in the equivalent of November-December 596 CE, giving an exact dating to our inscription. 2. The CPA Inscription The CPA portion of the inscription occupies two thirds of the last row, beginning in the right-lower corner of the rectangle, and its composers had compelled to adjust the text to the remaining space following the ending of the Greek part in this shared row. 1 The excavations were carried out by Dr. Daniel Varga, and they will be published by Dr. Daniel Varga and Prof. Rina Talgam in Israel Exploration Journal. 2 See an updated inventory of CPA inscriptions in Hoyland, CPA and Old Arabic, p. 37-39. 3 All the Greek inscriptions including the Greek part of the bilingual one, will be full published by Prof. Yulia Ustinova and Dr. Daniel Varga in Israel Exploration Journal. We would like to thank them for supplying a preliminary decipherment and comment of the Greek text.\n\nLe Muséon 129 (3-4), 279-284. doi: 10.2143/MUS.129.3.3180781 - Tous droits réservés. © Le Muséon, 2016.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_02_Vainstub.indd 279\n\n29/11/16 06:05\n\n280\n\nd. vainstub – M. sokoloff – D. varga\n\nIt can be clearly seen that the CPA text was executed by two different hands, each of them composing three words. The abrupt diminution of the letters’ size after the third word should not by any means be interpreted as a consequence of the awareness of a unique writer that there is insufficient room for three other words executed in the size of the first three. The two-hand conclusion can be deduced from the following facts: a) The first writer has a rough and simple calligraphic style, and committed calligraphic errors. The second writer, obviously a more literary one, shows a well-trained hand. This can be seen, for example, in his use of double lines of tesserae to express the thick strokes of some letters, emulating ink scribes’ customs, while the first writer use one-tessera lines for any stroke. b) The second writer was strict in laying the letters well leveled on two rows of white background tesserae, while the first writer attributed no importance to the issue. c) The two writers formed some letters in a quite different form. This is very evident in the case of wau and ālaf. d) The second writer began his work leaving a bigger space after the first one, than the space he used to separate between words he himself wrote. 3. Paleography The completely rounded tau is the typical CPA one, the base of which is usually slightly flattened when written in a line on soft materials, but entirely rounded examples of it can be seen, especially in non-joining taus as in the ῾Evron mosaic4. The first writer, most probably an illiterate mosaic artist who was provided with a copy of the text to set in the mosaic, made calligraphic mistakes in each one of the three words that he wrote. In the first one he attached the final nun to the top edge of the dālath5; in the second one he joined the non-left-joining letter rēsh to the row line and joined it to the following ῾ayin, making it look like an exact bēth. Of course, the clear context of the text and the diacritical dot above the letter determine its reading as rēsh. In the third word the writer omitted the left vertical stroke of the mīm, which caused it to look like a bēth. Undoubtedly, the context determines its reading as rēsh. Jacques, ῾Evron Inscription, p. 54*. The tau is inside the circle. However though a nun is expected to be written lower and separate from the preceding dālath, anomalies in these rules are found in mosaic inscriptions: in the Wadi Rajib Ajlun inscription a similar final nun was executed in the word ‫( ܗܖܢ‬Puech, Ouadi RajibAjloun, p. 318). See also Puech, ῾Ayoun Mousa on a possible too-high nun in an inscription from ῾Ayoun Mousa in the word ‫ܠܡܪܢ‬. 4 5\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_02_Vainstub.indd 280\n\n29/11/16 06:05\n\nA NEW CHRISTIAN PALESTINIAN ARAMAIC INSCRIPTION\n\n281\n\nThe second writer, showing a more stylized hand, wrote his ṣādhē with a typical CPA short upper element using a double line of tesserae and a wide horizontal stroke. The ṣādhē touches slightly the following dālath. In the upper stroke of the dālath a tessera is missing at the right of the edged tessera giving the false sense of an isolated dot leveled with the roof of the dālath. Obviously a black tessera must be reconstructed forming the roof of the letter that rises very moderately toward the left. Qōfs and waus are well distinguished, the former being angular and the latter oval with a pointed vertex at the top, and flattened at the bottom upon the line. The ālaf has a very stretched left-wavy head in line with some CPA examples6, whereas our example shows the most impressive curl in the upper part of the letter. 4. The Text ‫ܗܕܢ ܘ ܬܪܥܗ ܕܡܪܐ ܨܕܝܩܝܐ ܝܥܘܠܘܢ ܒܓܘܗ‬ This is the CPA translation of Ps 117:20 [MT 118:20]: “This is the gate of the Lord. The righteous will enter within it.” The verse is one of the most prevalent among biblical citations in Greek inscriptions from the Late Roman – Byzantine period, occurring about fifty times. Moreover, with the exception of one inscription from Numidia, all these occurrences come from the Syria-Palestinian area, almost always in a cultic context7. Among them thirty-seven were found in Dioecesis Orientis, including one from Beer-Sheva, very close to our site, which dates also to the sixth century8. This verse in the inscription is an addition to the corpus of known CPA material and was not previously attested9. The text is composed in correct CPA of the Early Period, but presents several paleographic peculiarities: 1. Connection of final nun to the dālath in the first word, against all of the rules governing the connection of letters. See Marcoff – Chitty, Monastic Research, plate III, no. 5 (the last letter), and the ālaf in the ῾ Evron mosaic in Jacques, ῾Evron Inscription. 7 See Felle, Biblia epigraphica, p. 421. Only Ps. 120:8 [MT 121:8] is cited more times than this verse. See also p. 412-413 on geographical and chronological distribution of the biblical citations, and p. 413, 419 on the impressive preference of the book of Psalms in the East. We are grateful to Dr. Leah Di Segni for her helpful comments on this topic. 8 Felle, Biblia epigraphica, no. 196 with full bibliography. 9 For a list of all the known CPA texts, see Sokoloff, Dictionary, p. xxvii-xli.

The following waw, which is a shortened form of the pronoun ‫ܘܗ‬, appears here independently, apparently a feature nowhere else attested in CPA, even as an enclitic. 3. The word ‫ ܡܪܐ‬appears to be written with a clear bēth, but in light of the clear meaning of the passage, and the paleographic peculiarities of the mosaic artist, mīm is clearly intended. Finally, we may note that the usage of ‫ ܥܠܠ‬with the preposition ‫ܒܓܘ‬ is elsewhere attested in CPA in Ex. 14:22: ‫ ܒܓܘ ܝܡܐ‬... ‫ ܥܠܘ‬10.

Abstract — Near the Bedouin township of Ḥura in the northern Negev, in a monastery dated to the 6th-7th centuries was recently discovered a bilingual Greek-Christian Palestinian Aramaic inscription. The purpose of this article is to publish the CPA part of it. As can be clearly seen, the CPA text was executed by two different hands, each of them composing three words. The first writer has a rough and simple calligraphic style, and committed calligraphic errors. The second writer, obviously a more literary one, shows a well-trained hand. The text reads: ‫ܗܕܢ ܘ ܬܪܥܗ ܕܡܪܐ ܨܕܝܩܝܐ ܝܥܘܠܘܢ ܒܓܘܗ‬. This is the CPA translation of Ps 117:20 [MT 118:20]: “This is the gate of the Lord.

Of particular importance for the study of Ephrem’s madrashe is the list of Ephrem’s hymns on f. 165v-178r, which was published and studied by André de Halleux in two magisterial articles1. Another text, of very different character, was also published by de Halleux; this was the short Melkite Chronicle on f. 42r-53v2. Next, in chronological order of publication was the collection of Chalcedonian texts on f. 1-41v, which were edited and translated by Paolo Bettiolo in the CSCO3. This was followed by the photographic edition of a surprising text to feature in a Melkite manuscript, namely Jacob of Serugh’s Memra on the Priesthood (f. 54r59r), with French translation, by Micheline Albert4. Much more recently Paul Géhin has provided a detail inventory of the manuscript’s miscellaneous contents, and has re-united with it four stray folios now in Milan5. For a long time there had been some uncertainty about the date of the manuscript, but Géhin has shown that it must belong to the eighth or early ninth century6. The verse texts incorporated into the manuscript consist of works, not only by Ephrem and Jacob (as has already been seen), but also one by Isaac ‘the Teacher’ (edited in Brock, An acrostic soghitha). Here, however, it is three specific groups of poems attributed to Ephrem that are presented, to be found on f. 80r-94v, f. 181v-187v, and f. 190v-196v7. At first glance the first group of ‘Select madrashe’ commences on f. 93r, since that is where we find the heading ‘Madrashe of Mar Ephrem’. In fact, extracts from his madrashe begin considerably earlier, on f. 80r, with the heading ‘Madrashe on Virginity, to the qala Kallat malka, selected’. de Halleux, Une clé. de Halleux, La chronique melkite. 3 Bettiolo, Una raccolta. 4 Albert, Mimro inédit. 5 Géhin, Restitution; for the list of contents, see p. 59-61. 6 Hatch, Album, plate XL, gave the date as 613/4, but, as P. Géhin has shown, this was based on a misunderstanding. 7 The texts are published by permission of the Monastery of St Catherine, Mount Sinai. I am most grateful to the Monastery for this permission. 1 2\n\nLe Muséon 129 (3-4), 285-322. doi: 10.2143/MUS.129.3.3180782 - Tous droits réservés. © Le Muséon, 2016.\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_03_Brock.indd 285\n\n29/11/16 06:05\n\n286\n\ns. brock\n\nThese madrashe follow immediately on from a collection of madrashe by Jacob of Serugh on Repentance8, and the unwary reader might well have assumed that the ‘Madrashe on Virginity’ were also by Jacob; this, however, is not the case, for the following madrashe can all be identified as being selected stanzas from Ephrem’s De Virginitate (1-3), De Ecclesia (1, 26, 27, 29, 30, 49, 50), and De Nativitate (5, 8, 18). Extracts from De Nativitate (3) continue on f. 93r, now finally with the specific attribution, being headed by the rubric ‘Madrashe of Mar Ephrem’. These extracts are of interest for two reasons in particular. Firstly, they provide a welcome new textual witness to De Ecclesia, for parts of which the textual attestation is very poor; indeed Sinai Syr. 10 at one point provides completely new material for the ending of De Ecclesia 1. Secondly, the selection of stanzas offers an early example of the free way in which Ephrem’s poems were handled in the later tradition (especially in liturgical manuscripts); remarkably, in the case of the excerpts from De Virginitate, groups of stanzas are sometimes presented in reverse order. The second group, on f. 181v-187v, consists of four soghyatha specifically attributed to Ephrem. These appear not to be known from elsewhere, apart from the second and fourth which are quoted in a Melkite manuscript of 882. The third element, on f. 190v-196v, is constituted by a single text, a ‘Memra of Mar Ephrem on the End’. This too appears not to be found elsewhere. It is separated from the soghyatha under Ephrem’s name by two other soghyatha, the first attributed to ‘Isaac the Teacher’, and the second to Jacob9. 1. Select madrashe (f. 80r-94v) Following after seven madrashe on Repentance by Jacob of Serugh there is a new heading, on f. 80r: ̈ ̈ ‫ܘܡܓܒܝܢ‬ ‫ܡܕܖܫܐ ܕܥܠ ܒܬܘܠܘܬܐ ܥܠ ܩ�ܠܐ ܕܟܠܬ ܡܠܟܐ‬\n\n‘Madrashe on Virginity, to the qala Kallat malka (‘Bride of the King’), selected’.\n\nThese all turn out to be excerpts from Ephrem’s madrashe, even though only the final section, (k), is specifically attributed to him, thus giving the impression that the preceding sections, (a) - (j), were still by Jacob. An edition of these, based as well on other manuscripts, is in preparation. Beginning ...‫ ;ܐܒܐ ܡܪܚܡܢܐ‬also found in British Library Add. 17141, f. 19v; it is attributed to Ephrem in the Rome edition of Ephrem’s works (Ephrem, ed.

The good received and left behind: they received success and left behind commemorations, the wicked received woe and left behind a mockery. Sufferings are fixed for the person who imitates (sc. the People), a mirror is fixed for the person who adorns himself13. 10b May Your grace cover up my stains on the day when hidden things are laid bare, when everyone is carrying his own actions in the presence of the resplendent Judge, and the just will be taking up (their) desired victories whereas the impure and the sinners amongst their companions will be carrying the stains of shameful action. Let us pray, my beloved, all of us for each other. 13 This stanza has an extra 5+5 syllables.

It will be a vast disclosure, one effected by ourselves (lit. our heart/mind). 10d Praise from all to the Three, to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. O Threefold One/Intercessor, hide my ugliness in exchange for any beauty that has proceeded from my mouth. O Lord, the staff of Aaron sprouted and brought forth embellishments from within itself; may the body, Lord, within which is hidden its own reproach not burst forth with its stains on the day of Your coming, and may I cry out at that time praise to the One who has had pity on me!\n\n(c) f. 85v-86v De Ecclesia 26:1-6, 11. ‫ܬܘܒ ܥܠ ܩ�ܠܐ ܕܐܘ ܬܠܡܝܕܝܟ‬ 26:1, line 5 (orth.) ‫ܟܠ [ܟܘܠ‬ om. rubric ‫ܥܘܢܝܬܐ‬ 26:2, line 1 ‫ܓܡܝܪܬܟ!

Four soghyatha (f. 181v-187v) In these four soghyatha each soghitha has an alphabetic acrostic and thus consists of 22 stanzas; the metre in all of them is 7+7, 7+7 syllables for each stanza; this is a metre used by Ephrem for De Ecclesia 6, De Fide 2-3, and De Nativitate 1, with varying qala (melody) titles, including hanaw yawma, the opening of De Nativitate 1. None of these poems, however, all of which are designated madrashe14, has an alphabetic acrostic, though one is found in the dialogue part of Beck’s Soghitha 4 (Mary and the Magi) and 5 (John the Baptist and Jesus), sometimes wrongly attributed to Ephrem15. What makes especially the first three of these four soghyatha very unusual is the fact that the alphabetic acrostic is kept for each stichos of 7 syllables, with only a small number of exceptions (for these, see 2.2. Discussion, below, p. 307-308); only slightly less unusual in later acrostic poems is the presence of the acrostic in the third stichos as well as the first16. 14 Soghitha seems simply to be a term used for a madrasha with short verses and a straightforward metre; cf. Brock, Dialogue and other Sughyotho. More surprising is the title memra given to a short poem in the same metre in Ephrem, ed. Lamy, III, col. 953, though this would of course apply to couplets in this metre in extended poems, such as Ephrem’s Sermones de Fide, whence the association of the metre with his name. 15 Soghitha 4 is also attributed to Narsai. 16 An example of the acrostic in the third, as well as the first stichos, is to be found in an anonymous soghitha on Julian Saba in Deir al-Surian Syr. 30, f. 231r-232v (10th/ 11th cent.).\n\n99279_Museon_2016_3-4_03_Brock.indd 292\n\n29/11/16 06:05\n\nEPHREMIANA IN MANUSCRIPT SINAI SYR. 10\n\n293\n\nAt the end of the first two soghyatha there is the puzzling statement that these were ‘on the interpretation of the mysteries/symbols of our Lord and of Moses’, which does not conform to the content of either of those two soghyatha; no obvious explanation for this suggests itself, but possibly the title was simply mistakenly taken over from another group of poems. 2.1. Text and Translation (a) Soghitha 1 (f. 181v-182v) Next, soghyatha uttered by the blessed Mar Ephrem the Teacher, which progress by an alphabetic acrostic. 1.
