        "text": "What exactly is India’s relationship with its neighbors, and with Africa in 2022?\n\nIn 2018, India’s expanded sphere of interest was central to the country’s security.\n\nIndia’s Prime Minister Modi defined the Indo – Pacific region as the very heart of foreign and security policy.\n\nThus, it includes both the Arabian Sea, the Gulf region, the Indian Ocean, the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThese are areas where India has clear geographical, historical and cultural ties, and according to Modi, the area is central – and vital – to India’s current and future security, stability and development. India’s involvement in this region should, according to Modi, be based on the five “s “s in Hindi:\n\nSammaan (respect)\n\nSanvad (dialogue)\n\nSahyog (cooperation)\n\nShanti (peace)\n\nSamridhi (prosperity).\n\nIn practice, however, it can prove challenging to find good solutions to security and stability challenges in cooperation with Russia, China, Pakistan, and Gulf states.\n\nThe Gulf region is of great importance to India, and in particular there are three factors that make the bond extra important:\n\nFirst, as much as 42 percent of India’s oil imports come from the six member states of the Gulf Council (United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar).\n\nQatar is also the largest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\n\nSecondly, the six members of the Gulf Council constitute India’s most important regional trading bloc – ahead of both ASEAN and the EU.\n\nThird, about 7.6 million Indians live and work in the region; in fact, Indians make up the largest population group in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn other words, India’s economic growth and security depend on stability in the Gulf countries, and naturally, close cooperation has developed on security policy issues: in particular in the fight against terrorism, money laundering, organized crime, human trafficking, piracy and cyber security.\n\nFurthermore, in recent years there has been a significant increase in joint naval exercises; many Gulf military personnel are trained at military academies in India.\n\nAt the same time, India has been very clear that it does not want a US-like role to protect the security and stability of the Gulf region.\n\nIndia has guarded well against interfering in conflicts between the Gulf countries and has managed to maintain good relations with Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, Israel and Palestine, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\n\nThe leaders of the BRICS countries agreed in 2022 to have good relations with both Africa and Arab countries, but are at stake after Russian – Ukraine war and relations with China that has long sought to increase its influence both under and over water; the maritime part of China’s new Silk Road “Belt and Road” initiative runs across the Indian Ocean.\n\nChina has also established its very first overseas naval base in Djibouti, facing the Indian Ocean.\n\nA review of India’s defense capabilities in 2022 shows major shortcomings in vital equipment in the navy and air force, so with changing geopolitical situation and security landscape has prompted Indian government to accelerate military modernization\n\nAt the same time, Chinese defense has undergone an enormously extensive modernization, and several have questioned India’s real chance of defending areas in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Quad\n\nIn response to China’s increased presence at sea, the four other major maritime nations in the region – Australia, USA, Japan and India – entered into a partnership in “The Quad” where the main objective is to balance China’s strategic expansion.\n\nAt the same time, India has been clear that it wants to move slowly, and is also participating in trilateral meetings at ministerial level with Russia and China in response to increased Chinese activity in the Indian Ocean.\n\nRelations with Pakistan in 2022 shows one conflict between two states that will demand more than life; the conflict between India and Pakistan is religion set back in history; a conflict that has the potential to become a war, and the fact that both sides possess nuclear weapons, but normally both India and Pakistan seek dialogue when the conflict flares up: however, relations between the two nuclear powers have deteriorated and recent diplomatic talks are taking place.\n\n2022 can be another record year and US gives its support to India’s increased focus on the Indo-Pacific region in response to China’s increased activity in region, while China in turn has invested heavily in Pakistan in recent years that they do not want to risk.\n\nIndia is trying to find its place as a regional super power, but the international superpower game may prove difficult with a war in Ukraine and with a pragmatic role in relation to the Gulf states, may prove difficult to maintain in future disagreements; where international great powers have clear interests and demand that their respective partners more clearly choose sides.\n\nRead\n\nWhat is behind the hashtag إلا_رسول_الله_يا_مودي “Only Messenger of God, Modi”? https://qleaks.com/en/what-is-behind-the-hashtag-only-messenger-of-god-modi/amp/\n\nThe Sahrawi people have right for Self-determination referendum in Western Sahara.\n\nGandhi of Western Sahara\n\nAminatou Haidar, a champion of peaceful resistance to Morocco’s annexation of Western Sahara, is demanding urgent international action to prevent the frozen conflict from devolving into war.\n\n“The international community must act without wasting any more time, because the young people have no more patience. They no longer believe in peaceful resistance,”\n\n– UN, Europe, France and Spain in particular had a responsibility to avoid war in the region.Morocco annexed the Western Sahara in 1975 following the withdrawal of colonial power Spain in the dying days of right-wing dictator Francisco Franco’s regime, sparking a war with the Algeria-backed Polisario Front movement.\n\nThe two sides agreed to a ceasefire in 1991, and a UN mission was deployed to monitor the truce and prepare a referendum on Western Sahara’s independence from Morocco, but it never materialised.\n\nBlood and violence\n\nAfter a long break, the UN-led dialogue between Morocco, the Polisario Front, Algeria and Mauritania resumed in Switzerland in December 2018, followed by new round in 2022, without achieving a breakthrough.\n\nThe Polisario Front is demanding a referendum on independence for Western Sahara, which Morocco has rejected.\n\nRabat considers Western Sahara integral to the kingdom and has said it will not accept anything beyond autonomy for the resource-rich territory.\n\nHaidar lamented that in the nearly three decades since the Polisario Front lay down its arms, Morocco and the international community have largely ignored the people’s non-violent demands for justice, dignity and self-rule.\n\nHaidar warned that the last round of unfruitful talks had left Sahrawi youth especially disillusioned.”They are angry, and they are frustrated… They say that the international community only acts in conflicts where there is blood and violence,”\n\nMore worrying, Haidar said, “they are pressuring the Polisario Front to pick up their arms again.”, and international community lacking the political will to enforce various UN resolutions and international court rulings that the Sahrawi people should have a say on the independence question.\n\nThis is due to the complicity of some international powers: Spain is responsible, and France is responsible, and without European support, Morocco could not pillage and exploit the natural resources, and it could not continue its occupation and to ignore all of the Security Council resolutions.\n\nFerocious repression\n\nHaidar, who is honoured by being likened to Gandhi, reaffirmed her commitment to non-violence; she has stuck by non-violence since she was a teenager, despite facing beatings, alleged torture and detention without charge or trial.\n\nHaidar was thrown into a secret prison when she was just 20, spending four years there in total isolation.\n\nAfter her release in 1991 at the time of the truce she continued her activism, despite constant police surveillance and in 2005, she was severely beaten and injured by police during a demonstration before being sent back to prison, where she carried out two hunger strikes protesting against mistreatment and arbitrary detention.\n\nThanks to international pressure, she was able to travel to Spain after her 2006 release, and she set out on an advocacy tour through Europe, the United States and South Africa, winning several prestigious rights prizes.\n\nBut she was denied entry when she wanted to return in 2009, and Morocco confiscated her passport and deported her to the Spanish Canary Islands.\n\nIn response, she launched a month-long hunger strike that grabbed headlines, before she was eventually allowed to return to Western Sahara.\n\nHaidar says that her case is not unique; its the case of all Sahrawi people today….they face ferocious repression on a daily basis for Sahrawi that lived in Western Sahara, a country that on the globe may seem desolate and deserted, but which still has enough resources to become the center of a bitter and protracted conflict again.\n\nSahrawi fled from resource-rich Western Sahara to desert camps in Algeria; three generations have grown up and become a rootless desert people who have in common that they’re born in Tindouf in Western Algeria, and with a desire to return to Western Sahara from which their ancestors were once forced to leave.\n\nThe Sahrawi have chosen to wage a peaceful struggle, but so far it has yielded few results.\n\nFor many years, the Sahrawi used weapons in the fight against Morocco, but after a peace agreement, they put their weapons away.But the peace agreement was never followed up, a referendum on Western Sahara’s independence was never held, and Western Sahara was filled by Moroccans working in various industries in the area.\n\nMorocco has managed to fill Western Sahara with its own people, but the Sahrawis are exiled – and so it has become that escape has become the normal.\n\nAlgeria terminates friendship agreement with Spain because the government in Madrid has given its support to Morocco’s plan for autonomy for Western Sahara.\n\nIn March 2022, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced a new phase in relations with Morocco when he said for the first time that Western Sahara could be an autonomous province under Moroccan rule.\n\nMorocco and Mauritania each took control of half of the former Spanish colony in 1975.\n\nMauritania withdrew four years later, and Morocco then also took control of their part of the territory.\n\nWhich country is Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic?– Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), also called Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic or Saharan Arab Democratic Republic, self-declared state claiming authority over the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which is presently occupied by Morocco.\n\nIs SADR a country? – the SADR maintains diplomatic relations with 41 United Nations states, and is a full member of the African Union.\n\nIs West Sahara a country? – Morocco has claimed authority over Western Sahara since 1975, but the United Nations (UN) does not recognize Moroccan control, calling Western Sahara a “non-self-governing territory.” Morocco controls the most populous area along the Atlantic coastline, more than three-quarters of the territory.\n\nWhat language is spoken in Western Sahara? – arabic\n\nWhat is the capital of Western Sahara? – El Aaiún (Laâyoume / El Ayun)\n\nWhat is going on in Western Sahara between Morocco and Algeria? – Since the 1930s, Moroccan Nationalists have envisioned a rebirth of the Moroccan Empires of old starting with Allal al-Fassi’s Greater Morocco dream which played a major role in Istiqlal’s official ideology: istiqlal was ,until the mid 1960s, Morocco’s dominant political faction.\n\nNow whether or not Morocco should take all of the envisioned Greater Morocco has been debated by the Nationalists but on two aspects, there was agreement: Western Algeria is Moroccan and Morocco should be the leader of Northern and Western Africa\n\nWhat do Moroccans and Algerians think of each other?– Algeria sees Morocco as a threat and is worried over what the future may hold in store if Morocco succeeds in the Western Sahara; thats history and Western Algeria has historically been ruled by Morocco at various points.\n\nAlthough the last time Morocco invaded Western Algeria was in 1831 with Sultan Abdel Rahman’s failed assault which was repelled by Ottoman forces.\n\nAlthough Morocco never gave up this goal – since the late 1950s, Morocco has been ambitious and expansionist. Seeking to assert its control over land it claims belong to it and the region it claims it is the traditional leader of.\n\nThis can be seen with Morocco’s conflicts with Spain: Ifni War over Spanish Cape Juby, Perejil Island crisis, battle over Ceuta; Morocco’s claim on Ceuta and Melilla; two Spanish cities in Northern Morocco.\n\nSpain continues to rule them while Morocco continues to loudly complain about it.\n\nAs well as Morocco’s growing presence in Western Africa: Morocco’s ambitious investments in Sub-Saharan Africa full of risks and rewards when Morocco become part of ECOWAS.\n\nSenegal ask Morocco to train Senegalese Imams King Mohammed VI with Nigerian President Buhari and that naturally sparks fears within Algerians due to the fact that Morocco’s intentions aren’t vague in the slightest.\n\nMorocco wishes to lead the region not work alongside it – however not only would Algeria be dominated by Morocco in such a scenario, it would partitioned as Morocco would strip it of lands that would be considered historically Moroccan: thats Western Sahara.\n\nAlgeria saw an attempt to “Sandwall” or destroy Morocco’s ambitions by inflicting a defeat in the Western Sahara; first Algeria deployed an intervention force that was crushed by the Moroccans at the Battle of Amgala in January 1976.\n\nThis dissuaded Algeria from deploying any more troops but instead it shifted to supporting the Polisario with arms, money and training hoping to weaken Morocco through a prolonged insurgency.\n\nPolisario occupies most of the Western Sahara but not all and from the 70’s, polisario was established as anti-colonization activities that wanted the Spaniards to get out of the Sahara by enlisting the help of Morocco to help them establish their own country: Morocco refused, and Polisario became Algerian mercenaries.\n\nFollowing the Green March and the Madrid Agreement, the polisario became ambitious and demanded independence and the establishment of an Arab democratic Sahara state.\n\nSo to the dialogue with the Polisarios and Morocco which was marked by a series of abuses for Morocco would claim its territory and build up something that resulted in agreement in 1991, then to 2022 where the African Union has welcomed Polisario – then how should Morocco and Algeria balance this when Morocco still demands the affiliation of the region in Western Sahara?\n\nWhy is Morocco on bad terms with its 3 neighboring countries;Algeria, Spain, and Western Sahara despite being the only land borders of Morocco?\n\nThe Polisario remains a threat to Moroccan interests and thus Morocco maintains most of its military force within the Western Sahara: which is beneficial to Algeria as it dissuades Morocco from starting anything.\n\nReal politics, business interests and international law – Now that Morocco is back in AU and the African community, it is to be hoped that it will give new impetus to peace work.\n\nIn terms of international law, the conflict is clear, something that both the UN, the International Court of justice in The Hague, the EU and the AU have emphasized in their rulings and statements.\n\nWestern Sahara’s independence is recognized by 87 countries, and the country is a permanent member of the AU.\n\nSo what is it that makes this conflict so difficult to resolve?\n\nFish, phosphorus and greed from business are the simple answer; the conflict is maintained by international business cooperating with private companies in the occupied territories.\n\nOne challenge is that international business, in violation of international law, began cooperating with the occupying forces to conduct seismic surveys for oil off the coast of Western Sahara.\n\nThe seismic surveys showed that there were no significant discoveries of oil off the coast.\n\nTo move towards a solution, it is also necessary to put pressure on France, which uses its veto power in the UN Security Council to support Morocco. Another concern is regional security challenges; in Morocco, Polisario is seen as an extended arm of neighboring Algeria, where a large number of refugees from Western Sahara have been living since the conflict began.\n\nThe Western Sahara conflict is presented as an extension of previous border conflicts with Algeria and as a result of the Cold War.\n\nAlgeria’s support, however, has at times been in direct conflict with Polisario’s own wishes, for example in the military escalation of the conflict. Morocco is also an important ally of NATO, and the international war on terror has long been a top priority. In addition, a free trade agreement between Morocco and the US entered into force in 2006.\n\nMorocco is Africa’s fifth largest economy, and not a small player.\n\nIn 2007, Morocco put forward a separate proposal for a solution on limited regional autonomy for the Sahrawi people, a proposal that was rejected by the Polisario.\n\nHowever, this proposal was supported by several countries without any progress in the peace process.\n\nEventually, most countries returned to a political understanding of the conflict based on UN resolutions, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruling and 2002 UN report on the Sahara’s right to control its own natural resources when Western Sahara is considered an independent nation, and any trade agreement must distinguish between natural resources in Moroccan and Sahrawi territory.\n\nFormer colonial power Spain, which withdrew from Western Sahara, among other things at the request of the UN, the highest court for such legal issues has made rulings in 2014 and 2015 which emphasize that the occupied territory is still covered by Spanish law, and thus bound of UN decolonization resolutions.\n\nIn March 2017, the Spanish government stated that imports of goods from Western Sahara are not covered by the EU’s trade agreement with Morocco, and until 2022, when Spain again challenges human rights.\n\nBut regardless of whether international law and the UN General Assembly have always been clear, peace work stops when it comes to the UN Security Council; this because France, as the only one of the five permanent members with a veto in the Security Council, tends to vote for the Moroccan position.\n\nThe ties between the French and Moroccan political and economic elites have always been close. An example: When French President Sarkozy lost the election in 2012, he and his wife were invited on holiday to one of the Moroccan royal family’s private palaces.\n\nMinurso is the only UN force established after the 1970s that is not allowed to report back to the UN on human rights violations, only on violations of the ceasefire agreement. Attempts have been made to change this a number of times, but have so far been halted by France.\n\nThe situation in Western Sahara has a strong impact on the human rights situation in Morocco; this is unfortunate, until 1974, Morocco supported an independent Western Sahara.\n\nParts of the Moroccan opposition therefore see the occupation in the context that this was a particularly turbulent period in Morocco’s history: Two failed military coups were carried out in 1971 and 1972, both parliament and other democratic institutions were disbanded, and the army was reorganized.\n\nAfter this, the king needed a nationalist victory to reunite the country but to say this in public is risky; the official political position is that Western Sahara belongs to the historical territory of Morocco, and it can be considered unconstitutional to dispute this understanding of the country’s political history.\n\nUntil 2005, critical newspaper articles were published in Morocco on corruption, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and the mixing of powers in Western Sahara. In addition, the Truth Commission came with its report on political killings and disappearances during the 70s, and the state paid compensation to those affected and survivors.\n\nThe UN visit scheme for Sahrawi families who are divided and live on opposite sides of the “wall of sand” that, together with the world’s largest landmine field, divides the occupied land in two, was also implemented.\n\nBut from 2006 until 2022, there has been a marked decline in critical articles, freedom of the press has weakened and censorship of foreign media has increased sharply.\n\nThis is related to the search for oil on the coast of Western Sahara and the privatization of Moroccan state-owned enterprises.\n\nAccording to Freedom House, Western Sahara is comparable to North Korea in terms of social, economic and political rights for the population.\n\nWhen Algeria suspends the friendship treaty with Spain will southern Europe be cut off oil?\n\nThe question remains, will the population of southern Europe suffer from a significant shortage of oil resources, as well gas.\n\nAlgeria had issued a warning to the Spanish side against re-supplying Algerian oil to “foreign parties”, as it closed the transit lines within Moroccan territory, then Algeria suspended its friendship treaty and froze all trade with Spain, most likely including natural gas.\n\nRead\n\nPolisario downed U.S jet https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/11/world/polisario-says-it-downed-us-jet.html\n\nRussia Reiterates Support For ‘Just and Sustainable Solution’ to Western Sahara Dispute https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2022/04/348351/russia-reiterates-support-for-just-and-sustainable-solution-to-western-sahara-dispute\n\nBlinken Urges Algeria to Rethink Stands on Russia, Western Sahara https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-urges-algeria-to-rethink-stands-on-russia-western-sahara/6508978.html\n\nSoviet Policy toward the Western Sahara Conflict https://www.jstor.org/stable AZ/4186426\n\nRussia blocks US bill to extend UN mission in Western Sahara https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20211029-russia-blocks-us-bill-to-extend-un-mission-in-western-sahara/\n\nU.S. Western Sahara Stance Emboldens Putin https://progressive.org/op-eds/us-western-sahara-emboldens-putin-zunes-220106/\n\n.\n\nThe Gupta family fled South Africa after Jacob Zuma had to step down as president of South Africa has now been arrested in Dubai; the two brothers Atul and Rajesh Gupta will now be send to South Africa, where they are accused of, among other things, corruption.\n\nStriking workers at the Optimum coal mine in South Africa, which is owned by the controversial Gupta family, are demonstrating against the owners with slogans such as “Zuma is gone – you follow”.\n\nRamaphosa’s stated goal is to clean up the corruption and abuse of power after Zuma, and rebuild the economy and trust: it is interesting and important that Ramaphosa has now got hold of some of the most corrupt people around Zuma\n\nZuma’s ‘shadow government’ and the mighty Gupta family came to South Africa in 1993, not long after apartheid was abolished.\n\nThey settled in Johannesburg where they established a thriving business selling computer, they also started to cultivate political connections in a country plagued by corruption, and especially with the circle around Zuma.\n\nRamaphosa’s big dilemma when Zuma came to power in 2009 put the Gupta with the winning ticket, and their business empire grew rapidly to include mining, food and media.\n\nPerhaps the biggest scandal of all was revealed when it became known that the British public relations firm Bell Pottinger, on behalf of a company controlled by the Guptas, was working to incite racial strife and riots based on false accusations of the intention is said to have been to divert attention from all the allegations of corruption surrounding Zuma and the Gupta: the scandal was another nail in the coffin for Zuma, and it led to Bell Pottinger simply going bankrupt due to the loss of reputation.\n\nThe firm attack on the powerful family came as a bigger surprise to most South Africans than Zuma’s departure, which after all had been on the cards for some good time.\n\nAfterwards it went downhill for Guptas, and all three brothers evaporated to Dubai where they have several properties.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, where Dubai is located, has no extradition agreement with South Africa so Gupta sent the money out of SA while the case shows that Ramaphosa took the fight against corruption and state capture seriously when two of Gupta are extradited to SA.\n\nThe Gupta were part of Zuma’s state-building system and the Gupta family’s empire in South Africa was rapidly collapsing; number of companies been declared bankrupt, while others have been brought to court for various offenses.\n\nThe state-owned Indian bank Bank of Baroda, which has financed much of the Gupta’s operations, announced the full closure of its operations in South Africa and the family’s private Bombardier jets have been seized following a legal claim by the Canadian Bank for Import and Export.\n\nThe political power of the Gupta has been eliminated and is completely open to blows.The empire collapsed at high speed, told by the Financial Times.\n\nThe Gupta family also has legal problems in the United States when it became known that the FBI was investigating at least two of the Gupta brothers’ nephews in Texas, who are US citizens, on suspicion of unregulated money transfers from South Africa, via Dubai, to the United States.\n\nThe Zuma wing of the ANC is still strong, and there are very many and powerful people who have a lot to lose in terms of privileges and power, and South Africa’s Ramaphosa is following a tight line.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa is on a tight rope and needs to keep some of them close to control them.\n\nTo cope with this, Ramaphosa has brought in a number of key people from the regime before Zuma, when Thabo Mbeki ruled; Ramaphosa takes a step back in many ways, to be able to move forward and Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank (ADB), is enthusiastic about developments in South Africa.\n\nWhen Africans hear calls on Ukraine to compromise and cede territory to Russia, think of 2014, think of Africa’s confusing colonization – there is no difference and in 2014 Ukraine did not oppose the occupation of Crimea.\n\nBut Russia was not happy\n\nWhat started as a war in the Donbas and a full-scale invasion in 2022 can only be concessions that make Russia’s appetite grow: in these eight years, Crimea has been heavily militarized and Russia continues to invade Ukrainian territory and indoctrinates children with anti-Ukrainian propaganda, well some of them fight, more are killed and all free Russian media cease to exist.\n\nAll this – and much worse – is guaranteed to happen on any Ukrainian territory if Russia is allowed to occupy more of it: this should be unacceptable for Africa when most of Russian information based on propaganda.\n\nThe only reason why Germany, France, Italy and the AU want to cede territory to Russia is because they are more concerned with money and their own freedom.- without taking into account that they are next to be invaded.\n\nSeems world has not learned anything from WW2 when France and Britain gave away parts of Czech to Nazi Germany, they brought peace for their time\n\nBerlin Congress of 1878, “My good friends, this is the second time in our history that there has come back from Germany to Downing Street peace with honor. I believe it is peace for our time.” – Chamberlain\n\nThe Sudetenland deal worked so well !?\n\nWhy is it always same European and African countries: history is a wheel that goes around and around so please spend a few minutes thinking about African facts, and keep in mind that:\n\n1. No one made a public call for a territory concession,\n\n2. If money meant so much, there would be no sanctions.\n\nNot even from 2014, and maybe Macron is prepared to give Alsace to Russia? Don’t think so, moreover, France has nuclear weapons.But in the next process of the war it’s far more issues for Baltic states.\n\nSometimes it seems that Africa, France, Italy and some other countries are living in an alternative world.\n\nAfrica says its not our war, but glaring facts are under both AU and NATO umbrella that only 3,500 km away its a Putin war – then words like “end the war” “Make peace” “avoid humiliating Putin ” “pressure Ukrainians to make compromises ” to sound naive and can only satisfy Africans who do not have the strength to watch war images on TV, or relate to the truth.\n\n“If Russia can use African migrant flows as a weapon at one end of Europe, they can certainly use it at the other,”\n\nBut at the same time, Africa is helping to finance Russian warfare for years, dealing with oil and gas, and goods for use in military missions.\n\nThe approach Africa – China- Russia has clearly failed, and many refuse to admit it and repeat same mistakes and continue in same direction when they agree to let Russia occupy more Ukrainian territory; freezing conflicts will not provide lasting peace, well Africa has experienced from its own wars and conflicts.\n\nIt is in Russia that they are preparing for new attacks in Ukraine, just as terrorism will continue in Africa through the use of Russian soldiers.\n\nThen Russia should be seen as the perpetrators of war crimes in both Europe and Africa: – should have had a greater focus in Ukraine, Africa, Europe and the whole world – otherwise there will be no peace.\n\nIs it toughness or ineptitude that Africa / AU doing?\n\nA famine catastrophe could result if Ukraine is not allowed to export grain via ports in the Black Sea.\n\nThe export problems threatens food security in Africa all over the world,but why can’t the grain be transported to Poland, and shipped from there !? The West try to find solutions to get the grain out of Ukraine; they have tried to get it out by train and truck to Poland and by river boats to Constanza in Romania.\n\nBut this is expensive and at best they can only get 20 percent of the grain in this way.\n\nThe West has discussed deploying a military naval operation in the Black Sea, based on the common security and defense policy, to escort civilian cargo ships from port of Odessa through the Black Sea and out into the Mediterranean.\n\nBut the danger of clashes with Russian warships and war between the West and Russia will then be very high.\n\nHowever, the thought of a humanitarian crisis with hunger is just as frightening and if the grain is to go out to those who need it, it must go out by ship.\n\nPutin on Friday 03.june 2022 hosted Sall, Senegal’s president and Moussa Faki Mahamat, chairman of the AU Commission, in the southern Russian city of Sochi\n\nWhat Putin did not inform Sall about was how Russian ships with stolen Ukraine grain have been rejected in several ports\n\nThe current position of Matros Pozynich is at Black Sea (coordinates 41.80387 N / 30.49004 E) reported 6 hours ago by AIS: the vessel is en route to the port of Kavkaz, Russia, sailing at a speed of 12.5 knots and expected to arrive there on Jun 6, 09:00.\n\nThe Russian ship is / was probably loaded with stolen grain from Ukraine and was rejected in several ports in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe grain may now have been loaded into a new ship, but Matros Pozynich is one of three ships involved in the trade in stolen grain, and at the end of April 2022 the ship anchored Crimea with radio off, then next day it was seen in the port of Sevastopol before, the ship went on to Alexandria in Egypt with almost 30,000 tons of Ukrainian grain.\n\nUkrainian authorities notified Egypt and said that the grain had been stolen, which led the ship to turn around, and the same thing happened when the ship tried to dock in Beirut.\n\nMatros Pozynich has lately been at the port in Latakia in Syria, but according to Marinetraffic, Matros Pozynich has left this port and set course for Crimea again.\n\nMikhail Voytenko from the website Maritime Bulletin claims that the grain was loaded onto a new ship in Latakia as a hide.\n\nWho is fighting who? On lokal or geopolitical level?\n\nUkraine is a huge grain barn, but it is closed by war and the West fears widespread famine in Africa and many countries in the world if this grain does not enter the world market.\n\nIn peacetime, Ukraine sells enough calories to feed 400 million people.\n\nBefore the war, Ukraine sold an average of 18 million tonnes of wheat a year, 24 million tonnes of maize and almost five million tonnes of barley, in addition to almost half of the world’s sunflower oil, more than five million tonnes.\n\nSo why should the West support countries in Africa that cannot recognize when a fascist country attacks another country? – famine and high food prices can trigger an economic crisis and social unrest, which in turn can lead to an influx of refugees who sooner or later end up in the West. Russia’s attack on Ukraine could have dramatic consequences for world food security, and Russian artillery is deliberately bombarding grain barns in Ukraine and Russian warships in Black Sea are blocking the way for Ukrainian ships full of wheat and sunflower seeds.\n\nWhy should the West spend time, energy and money on Africans who are not for the rule of law and democracy? – the price of wheat has doubled in the world market after the outbreak of war and pushed up food prices and in Spain, farmers have started growing rapeseed again, 40 years after a scandal in which toxic oil was mixed into rapeseed oil, which led to an estimated 5,000 deaths and four times as many with permanent injuries. Tunisia buys 53 percent of its wheat consumption from Ukraine, Libya 44 percent and Egypt 26 percent, according to figures from the European Commission.\n\nIndia and Pakistan, with a population of close to 1.7 billion, depend on Ukraine for almost half of their wheat needs.\n\nAt the same time, Putin blames the West; he is willing to ease the blockade in the Black Sea, if the West eases sanctions against Russia – and Ukraine has mined its waters in the Black Sea to avert an attack by Russian warships.\n\nRussian warships, submarines, block the important port of Odessa, so to avoid danger of ending up in war with Russia, the West must bring three countries to an agreement, if this grain is to satisfy hungry people.\n\nWhy does the AU leader not inform that grain, cereals and food deliveries are excluded from Western sanctions? – Ukraine must remove the mines outside Odessa, something Ukraine will do if Russia does not use this as an open door for an attack. Russia must get through civilian merchant ships, but Putin then demands less sanctions from the West. and Turkey must release warships through the Bosphorus; Erdogan is the gatekeeper of the Bosphorus and can refuse warships from countries that do not have a coast to the Black Sea to sail through the strait.\n\nHow Africa became victims for the war in Ukraine?\n\nThe answer is local, so most African nations know their position when it comes to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the West can not expect majority of Africans to speak geopolitically about the situation.\n\nAfricans can not be “bullied” by any western country to take part in Russia vs Ukraine, or know anything about sanctions.\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine are our enemies at local level, and Africa can not change its own principles of life to satisfy West when we only have radio, BBC, and\n\nAl Jazeera’s fact-based news to deal with so that the media image is likely to be distanced from African reality and nature sustainability.\n\nIf Putin explained to Sall the real background for why large quantities of grain cant be skiped from Ukrainian ports, well then how to deal with propaganda and how easy it is to spread when it is conveyed that no one is blocking Ukrainian ports, or as Dmitry Peskov says “… at least not from Russian side. “\n\nAccording to UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Russia is still blocking 22 million tonnes of grain from being shipped from Ukrainian ports.\n\nWho’s blockade threatens the world’s food supplies, and many poor countries are facing a major food crisis, says UN secretary general.\n\nPutin believes that the best solution would be to transport via Belarus, but only if the sanctions against Russia end.- if anyone wants to solve the problem of exporting Ukrainian grain – please, the easiest way is through Belarus, yes with access to ports in the Baltic Sea !?\n\nA global famine could be the result if Ukraine is not allowed to export grain, then again Putin does not agree with the West that they are to blame for the global food crisis that is brewing, but if Russia / Ukraine do not get to open these ports, it will result in hunger, destabilization and mass migration around the world.\n\nThe warnings from the UN crisis coordinator, Amin Awad, are clear: he fears that the war in Ukraine could lead to famine around the world.\n\nIn war and despair, Ukrainian government is trying to involve UN and get the grain out by rail; that requires development and rebuilding of infrastructure that will take years, Ukraine’s Minister of Trade, Taras Katshka, told the French newspaper Le Monde: now Ukraine’s grain silos are full, with a full year of crops. If the world does not solve this, does not get a provision for it, then 2023 will be worse.\n\nWithout selling the grain, there is no money for fertilizer and fuel and no reason to sow: Ukraine is trying to persuade the UN to negotiate an agreement on convoys with protection from warships from neutral countries, such as India.\n\nRead\n\nThe devil in the details\n\nhttps://www.jeuneafrique.com/1351756/politique/face-a-poutine-macky-sall-vainqueur-a-la-courte-table/\n\nA warning to the Baltic sea just because Russia won’t share their food? https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/04/us/politics/uss-kearsarge-stockholm.html\n\nRussia vs Ukraine: Why Africa should need World War III? https://pepforumuganda.wordpress.com/?s=WWIIIhttps://pepforumuganda.wordpress.com/?s=WWIII\n\nUK says Russia’s gains in eastern Ukraine have been ‘slow and costly’; Putin blames West for food, energy crisis https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/04/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html\n\nUkraine warns that only lifting Black Sea blockade can avert global food crisis https://www.ft.com/content/bbaa9e19-c07c-4222-a7f3-ce35cc4b1f1b\n\nUkrainian Farmers Don Bulletproof Vests to Plough Frontline Fields https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2022-04-26/ukrainian-farmers-don-bulletproof-vests-to-plough-frontline-fields\n\nPart of the port in Mykolaiv, buildings and grain burned https://czechia.postsen.com/world/9875/Russia-destroyed-part-of-the-port-in-Mykolaiv-buildings-and-grain-burned-Putin-promised-to-allow-his-exports-iROZHLAS.html\n\nRussia’s U.N. ambassador walked out of a U.N. Security Council meeting https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/russia-walks-out-of-un-security-council-meeting-over-claim-it-is-using-food-as-stealth-missile\n\nWestern weapons sent to Russia / Ukraine war are now sold on the dark. net: this is how the world flood a country with weapons without supervision, and it has happened repeatedly\n\nThese are strong allegations, and of course it is not something that anyone will admit, but with the danger of appearing tendentious, it is still good to mention a few things that indicate that something is rotten in the state of Transdnistria :\n\nSheriff Tiraspol is officially run by two former KGB agents and owns just about everything that can be owned in Transdniester; these include petrol stations, number of supermarkets, TV channel, magazine publisher, Mercedes-Benz dealer, an advertising company, liquor store, mobile phone company and FC Sheriff Tiraspol.\n\nSo, who has control over the weapons delivered to Ukraine, who knows that several of these weapons are resold on the dark.net and will fall into the hands of terrorists in lawless areas in Africa and Europe.\n\nFrom a 2004 report funded by the British Department for International Development called Transdniester “a smuggling company disguised as a state”, reflecting a popular suspicion among Tiraspol residents that the sheriff is a mafia-like syndicate where the weapons themselves have no moral status, since the weapons have no will of their own.\n\nOf course, it can be used by evil people for evil purposes, but there are more good people than evil.\n\nStill, with an average monthly salary in Transdniester of just $ 200, working for a company that reportedly pays double, then arms trading is a tempting prospects. Transdniester is in big trouble today, and Moldovan officials are concerned: some see Tiraspol’s rhetoric as a desperate plea for help in difficult times – with the war in Ukraine, they say the threats and accusations are a way for the incumbent leadership to put problems on foreign enemies and gathering public support: Tiraspol is keen to negotiate, but they do not want to negotiate on terms that will bring them closer or relinquish any control to Chisinau.\n\nThat is why the arms trade is expanding and solution-focused talks are stagnating, and with Russia’s own economy in recession, the situation for Transdniester is only vulnerable, to worsen and the outlook is extremely dark.\n\nThere have been disturbing waves in the past, but 2022 is most intense, and Moldova has enough problems, Ukraine is already at war, and the same signals are coming from Russia’s leadership; an economic crisis in Transdniester equals instability.\n\nWith other words, the Sheriff’s business has a decent monopoly, and of course they have certain financial reliefs when it comes to taxes and exports. But most important of all, British experts on organized crime told the BBC that the president in Transdniester is believed to be using Sheriff as a way to launder money.\n\nThe UN claims, according to a French documentary on illegal arms sales in Transdniester , that the country’s leaders make over a billion dollars a year on illegal transactions.\n\nAnother thing worth notice is that the Russian Red Army left 42,000 tons of ammunition and weapons in Cobasna, in northern Transdniester. Some were destroyed by the Russian army, but papers and official documents are deficient.\n\nA British expert on illegal arms sales, Brian Johnson Thomas, found weapons registered at the depot in Kolbasna throughout Central Africa and DRC.\n\nIn an article written for the Sunday Times in 2005, Brian Johnson Thomas tells that a high-ranking officer in the secret intelligence MGB in Transdniester , pretended to be a representative of a militant group in Algeria.\n\nBrian Johnson Thomas was looking to buy three so-called “Dirty Bombs” – a type of bomb that spreads radioactive waste – and after a while, Brian Johnson Thomas was introduced to a willing seller.\n\nThe seller was Dmitri Soin, an MGB officer and the founder of the right-wing extremist organization PRORIV.\n\nThe “fireworks” cost half a million dollars, and if they agreed, the bombs would be shipped from Ukraine.\n\nBrian Johnson Thomas naturally withdrew from the agreement; nor must one disregard the fact that Transdniester is also a former owner of a weapons factory: several claim that the steel production factories are actually covert weapons factories.\n\nAnother French documentary team failed to gain access to one of the most notorious manufacturers of electronic products. Although the borders of Moldova are strictly guarded from Transdniester , one can easily get over to Ukraine by train or car: Transdniester also has a airstrip that can be used for air transport.\n\nLife elsewhere in Transdnistria gives associations to North Korea and there are strong anti-Semitic, and the local synagogue in Tiraspol has been bombed and set on fire several times.\n\nThe average transdnistrian is poor; several sell organs, such as their own kidneys, to survive, while the elite made up of Russians are rich.\n\nAccording to rumors, all hotel rooms are intercepted, and the slightest opposition to the government could lead to a sudden disappearance without a trace, and the journalist Ernest Vardanean was imprisoned and accused of espionage for Moldova.\n\nWhen British Simon Reeve visited Transdniester to make a documentary series about breakaway states in 2005, he was also accused of the same thing.\n\nRead\n\nThe Alazan rockets https://www.rferl.org/a/1105278.html\n\nUgandan home made missiles https://youtu.be/fMVYwAlw3mY\n\nAfrican missile made in Uganda https://ocaidopatrick.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/445/\n\nFear of WWIII has been on Internet and social media since Russia’s war with Ukraine.\n\nWill WWIII give Africa an advantage? – although Africa is unlikely to be involved in a war in the Middle East or a third World War, such events will still hold significant detriment for most African economies as well as for the global economy.\n\nWhat will be the difference for Africa with WWI, WWII and WWIII? – It depends on who the aggressors of WWIII are. If it’s between Russia and the West and China stays out of it, it would be mostly untouched with some of the countries allying to one of the powers to supply raw materials for the war, and that’s about it and North Africa used as a staging area to either attack or defend Southern Europe. If China is involved though on the side of the Russians, we would see active fighting on the continent as China and the US economic interests in the area would finally come to a clash as both nations are heavily invested there.\n\nAfrica fell into poverty and abandoned because there was nothing during the last 2 World Wars, and most of us will not agree that Africa needs WWIII more than any other continent on the planet.\n\nThere isn’t alot of African countries that can do alot to actually fight in WWIII.\n\nAssuming WWIII involves a Russian alliance against NATO. Africa then would play the same part it had in WW2, which was a theatre of desert warfare between troops from stronger countries.\n\nNorth Africa is a good access way to Southern Europe and the Mediterranean. So the only part we can see Africa playing is a separate theatre of war for the flanks of Europe.\n\nAs for AU military itself, they’re all poorly armed and trained or don’t have a sufficient navy to cross over, so they’d all have to travel through massive landmass so why would Africa take any part in WWIII; when there’s plenty of problems in Africa to take care of: that’s hypothetical only if WWIII scenario.\n\nWhile Russia and the West hit each other in the head with words, rockets and nuclear weapons – remember, even though the global world ready to call for WWIII, in reality it’s not that African nations are not involved.\n\n– there is a war going on in the Sahel region, Russian soldiers are represented in more than 20 African nations, so no reason to be silent that the war against Islamic State law enforcement in central West African and East African states may involve Africa in a WWIII; just having well-respected Islamic states such as Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia in WWIII will certainly affect the war against groups such as ISWAP and ISIS rebels in Africa where Egypt, South Africa, Nigeria, Mali, Morocco, Sudan and Algeria faces its own problems but far less than a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nAfrica / AU should ask themself this question: – live in peace and develop Africa or be bombed out of this world, what is prefered? Most prople will choose peace and remain neutral but will probably be caught in a war as proxy nations.\n\nWWIII scenario is possible when Africa is used as a struggle for immigration between China and the United States – and China already heavily involved in Africa: they have been doing it for a long time and African nations will participate in WWIII when Russia wants to do hell against NATO.\n\nRead “On the Beach” by Nevil Shute: still relevant and in the book, southern hemisphere first survives the total destruction of the northern hemisphere after WWIII, but will Africa overcome radiation?\n\nIn the same way, Africa would be spectators and ultimately pay the ultimate price.\n\nThere are a thousand thoughts\n\nFeels both happy and sad before we get to talk about the Prophet and about God; all these topics that are otherwise taboo where we pray in secret, and very many consider the music of Sami Yusuf to say that God sets us free.\n\nAlready made an impression and not unanimous: no one judges us and the brotherhood is no longer between those who believe in the same thing – have a friend who is Hindu and it’s about accepting that others have a mother who, and perhaps a father who taught them something else about life: – that heaven is a goal and life might be casting and if it makes us do good things then what do we think about believing in God?\n\nHow many have not asked about the same thing, and doomsday after that?\n\nBoth music and film are basically well tuned to Africa’s mood: – music as a mnemonic cultural object that deals with music with both longing, emotional and that can play on ‘memorial day for Uganda’s heroes‘ through radio and SoMe – and who asks, among other things, what’s makes music played on radio can be identified with the national ritual of heroes day?\n\nMusic used in the context of Uganda’s event and history: mnemonic cultural object as a musical which allows law and authority to symbolize and create social memories, and which serves as memorial.\n\nThe music that characterizes ‘heroes day’ stands out as particularly important in Uganda – they’re musical memory objects.\n\nWhy did they become that?\n\nIdentifies the characteristics of the music that may justify why they became musical memory objects have become it because of a complex combination of their calm tone and slow pace, the biography of the artist and their lyrics.\n\nWhen I got disgusted by life “… It was evil in my eyes, everything that happens under the sun. For everything is emptiness and hustle after wind ”(Eccl. 2:17). King Solomon of Israel described his state of life three thousand years ago since, but the experience Solomon outlined, that life loses its attraction despite having everything, is relevant and present in today’s society.\n\n1) what qualities lie in knowing the way of life, as it is described in the literature? and\n\n2) is life expectancy already adequately covered by other conditions in East African film?\n\nLife guide is thus described in fiction as an existential basic experience; an emotional state characterized by emptiness, a feeling that life is meaningless despite the fact that we apparently have everything; characterized by emotions such as disgust, nausea, lust and boredom, and can also characterize us by feelings of alienation and a form of claustrophobic anxiety.\n\nIt may seem like that of life paradox; the emptiness of the fullness, is the quality of life lead that is most difficult to accommodate in East African film as in :\n\nBala Bala Sese – is a Ugandan film directed by Lukyamuzi Bashir based on a screenplay by Usama Mukwaya, starring Michael Kasaija, Natasha Sinayobye, Raymond Rushabiro, Ismael Ssesanga, Fiona Birungi, Ashraf Ssemwogerere and Ddungu Jabal.\n\nIt is the director’s, author’s and producer’s debut film; a story of boyfriend’s battle for love through perseverance. In the outskirts of Sese Island, John is madly in love with Maggie and both are willing to take their love forward.\n\nFacing abuses and harassment by malicious Maggie’s father Kasirivu, John, helped by his young brother Alex is determined to take in all but to retain the love of his life especially when he finds out that he has a contender village tycoon who is also lining up for Maggie.\n\nBala Bala Sese highlight some of the East African films and characters that spoke to us directly about this sensitive subject.\n\nLets have a look at Bala Bala Sese and what it had to tell us about men suffering from love and mental health issues.\n\nBala Bala Sese is designed for multiple viewings; it’s almost a cliché to say that in this golden age of Ugwood we’ve been living through, but in the case of Lukyamuzi Bashir ’s groundbreaking story, it’s the absolute truth.\n\nBala Bala Sese can be known for many things, including its incredibly talented cast, ushering in the rise of the tycoon movement, and turning the film genre on its head by having a crime boss in therapy as the crux on which the film was built.\n\nWhat the story doesn’t get nearly enough credit for, however, is bringing the issue of mental health—specifically in men— to the forefront of East African culture at a time when nobody else was having these conversations.\n\nIn many African cultures, men traditionally never voiced their feelings; gender roles tell us that men were to work and push through any bad or uncomfortable feelings because it was a sign of weakness to acknowledge something like depression or addiction, as in the case of Bala Bala Sese – it wasn’t manly to be vulnerable.\n\nOne of the things that Bala Bala Sese did so well was to take the epitome of an alpha male—a large, powerful man who led a family—and humanize him.\n\nThe effort Lukyamuzi Bashir put into his film was declining; in many ways to deal with Bala Bala See that the male lead roles are no longer treated as what they each led by and the tragedy that resulted in the form of love.\n\nAt the beginning of the film with Lukyamuzi Bashir showed us about opening ours to ideas that men should seek help and no stigma needed to exist. Towards the end of the film, Lukyamuzi Bashir showed us what happens when we stop taking care of our mental health; a gloomy ending, perhaps, but the point was to get us all thinking and talking about topics that people had not talked about before.\n\nLukyamuzi Bashir lays out a failed attempt at a much-needed conversation.\n\nWhether Bala Bala Sese ultimately was, or not, succeeds in getting people to have these major conversations is certainly debatable. Bala Bala Sese moving in is easier to see in other areas, such as making therapy part of a story; the film promotes the social acceptance of therapy.\n\n.\n\nAs one who has seen the film many times, it is clear the human condition is a focal point in Lukyamuzi Bashir story. If you have not seen Bala Bala Sese, do yourself a favor and watch it: you may be amazed at what is known to you about this East African / Ugwood movie.\n\nVladimir Putin has received more and more in return for his ten-year charm offensive in Africa.\n\nMore than 30 African countries have entered into military cooperation with Russia in one form or another; Russia’s presence in Africa has exploded since Russia first entered Ukraine in 2014 and there’s Russian mercenaries present in over 20 African countries.\n\n– Russia will challenge the United States and the West in different arenas. It does not matter if it is in Ukraine and Europe, and the Middle East, or in Africa.\n\nIn some 20 African countries, Russian private mercenaries are helping regime break down in exchange for diplomatic loyalty and lucrative mining contracts. Africa with its wealth of resources, young population and growing middle class is becoming interesting to the old colonial powers – and China and Russia.\n\nGlobal battle for Africa is a global tug-of-war that takes place around Africa.\n\nBritain and France have received competition from primarily China, but also Russia, which launched an African charm offensive when Putin returned to the presidency in 2012.\n\nWhen the West imposed sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia stepped up efforts to find new markets in Africa.\n\n“The first Russia-Africa Summit was held on 23–24 October 2019 in Sochi, Russia, co-hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. 43 heads of state or government were in attendance.”\n\nThe strategy culminated in a Russian-African summit in Sochi in 2019 and will be repeated in 2022 with a summit AfCFTA\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia’s commitment to Africa crumbled – but in recent times Russia is again exploiting African countries that are rich in resources, at the same time poor and unstable.\n\nPutin is helping dictators and authoritarianists, and there is no demand from Russia for democratization or human rights – instead, the countries get help with private elite forces that help dictators and authoritarian leaders in fighting both terrorists and democratically minded opposition: this is done to gain influence among the ruling political layer.\n\nOne of the paramilitary private groups operating in Africa is the Wagner group: mercenaries from the Wagner Group have taken part in operations during the Syrian civil war, helping Ukrainian separatists in the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk and Wagner group confirmed to be present in the ongoing war in Ukraine, while also present in Mali and West Africa.\n\n“During the invasion, the Ukrainian military said the Wagner Group had rebranded itself as Liga and referred to them as such in their reporting.”\n\nMalian authorities use Russian paramilitary security forces to keep the population under control – at the same time, Russia is gaining influence, gold and diamonds for its presence: in addition to increased Russian influence in African countries, there is more to be gained.\n\nThe oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin has close ties to Putin and he is said to be the one who finances the Wagner group: according to Western intelligence sources, companies related to Prigozhin have been allowed to extract gold and diamonds in mines in Sudan and the Central African Republic.\n\nThe Russian state has also been involved in mineral and energy projects in a number of African countries.\n\nMilitary cooperation agreements on everything from arms deliveries, joint exercises to military technical cooperation have been entered into with more than 30 African countries.\n\nRussia has reaped real political gains from the African charm offensive since 2010.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly on March 2, 2022, only 28 of Africa’s 54 states voted in favor of a resolution condemning Russia’s attack on Ukraine.In April 2022, the African dissonance became even clearer when the UN General Assembly was to vote to exclude Russia from the UN Human Rights Council: no African country wanted to exclude Russia, nine voted with Russia, 24 voted blank and 11 were absent.\n\n– Africa has 54 member states that Russia is trying to cultivate; three seats in the Security Council are reserved for Africa, so it’s important for Russia to get support from Africa in the conflict with the West.\n\nTo say that this is indifferent is like saying that there is no longer any point in taking a stand and then accusing Africa of sympathizing with Putin’s war in Ukraine.\n\nIt is wrong when someone dares to take a stand on what is really happening in Africa; very good at conspiracy theories to say it was not a wise choice. It is not so surprising at all if Western countries will stop all aid to African countries: something else will be a mockery of Ukraine, but then all obligations are forgotten to those Africans who did not agree.\n\nSome in the West are so short-sighted that they believe Putin will take over responsibility for aid and house all refugees and migrants from Africa in the future – the western nations are better than others at it anyway, but African, primarily, authoritarian leaders probably reflect the population?\n\nAnyone can disagree with that.\n\nThere is no reason to think so, but there are hundreds of millions of Indians who are against Russia because it is about the poorest people on the planet, where the level of education is marginal, and where large parts of the population have barely realized that there is war in Ukraine: one must not forget the BRICS, which are largely driven by Putin’s Russia; The BRICS meeting in 2020 was the focus: discussing a mutual agreement on helping BRICS member countries to help foster better living standards and quality of life for each countries people. Plans on focusing on peace, economies, and cultural societal issues.\n\nSo it is very dangerous to believe everything that is written and displayed, without trying to understand and see the matter from both sides. None of the people in the West want to live in a dictatorship that exists in Africa, Russia, or China, but one must understand that not everything is as it is portrayed by Western leaders and the press.\n\nThe world is extremely relative, where we are all closest to ourselves and most of what we know are assumptions.\n\nTake, for example, an article on sanctions; There is no doubt that the economic sanctions from the United States, the European Union and other Western allies, such as Australia and Japan, will hit Russia hard: at the same time, we know that the Russian state is estimated to earn $ 321 billion on energy exports by 2022. last year in 2021, and that the ruble has recovered because the interest rate in Russia is now at 20%.\n\nHow long will the West accept it?\n\nIncidentally, it is far too early to pass judgment on the effects of the sanctions after a few months; sanctions were expected and the Russians had prepared.\n\nBut they are unable to stand in this over time and it is a mistake to think that Africa, or the Russian people, is helpless against Putin.\n\nIf these sanctions hit Russia hard, then Africa will not go free either: food, petrol have become more expensive. Russia will get through the sanctions of the so-called democratic West and most of Africa will vote against the West because it was the West that colonized them, not the Soviet Union.\n\nSorry that this comes up in 2022 because it was not the West that colonized Africa, but rather the leaders of the time: they are gone now – sorry that some have not progressed in history so the next 100 years may be as after the period 1945 -1990.\n\nOf course, that includes keeping Elvira Nabiullina at work even when she duly follows the Washington consensus.\n\nAnd that brings us back to the possibility of ultra-high stakes, which the Kremlin may from the beginning have wanted to pursue indefinitely, forcing the NATO to reveal their real cards and reveal their systems in a spectacular display of “The King is naked”, to an audience all over the world.\n\nAnd that’s where the new monetary system is EAEU / China enters the picture, under Glazyev‘s supervision.\n\nWe can really imagine that Russia, China and large parts of Eurasia are gradually differentiating from capitalism; the ruble is converted into a gold-currency; and where Russia focuses on self-sufficiency, productive domestic investment and trade relations with most of Africa and the global south.\n\n“The Central Bank of Russia has announced that “In order to balance supply and demand in the domestic market of precious metals, the Bank of Russia will buy gold from domestic credit institutions at a fixed price of 5,000 Russian rubles per gramme from 28 March to 30 June 2022.”\n\nRussia exported, according to some estimates, 600 tons of gold: the head of the Russian central bank, Nabiullina, said – whoever wants to sell gold to get cash, or if you break gold and trade in it, remember that the state, in my person, will not buy gold from you at a market price – we take it with great discount, if you want to get honest money for it, export it.\n\nConsequently, everyone started exporting and selling gold in London: keep an eye out for the gold guaranteed ruble It may be a little too late, but now at least the Kremlin has set up a committee – with authority over the central bank geeks – to deal with the important issues. It feels puzzling that the Russian central bank is not subject to either the Russian constitution or the legal system, but is in fact subordinate to the IMF. It can be argued that this cartel-designed financial system – which implies zero sovereignty – simply cannot be handled directly by any nation on the planet, and Putin has tried to undermine it step by step.\n\nFar beyond its confiscated foreign reserves and tons of gold sold in London, it is important that Russia remains the ultimate source of power for natural resources.\n\nWill it burst?\n\nA little austerity for a while will take care of it: nothing as dramatic as the national impoverishment of the neoliberal 1990s.\n\nAnd extra boost would come from exporting natural resources at premium-discounted prices to other countries in the BRICS and most of Eurasia, Africa, and the global south.\n\nThe collective west has just created a new, clumsy gap between east and west.\n\nRussia is turning it upside down, to its own advantage: after all, the multipolar world in the east is rands.\n\nThe Empire of Lies will not back down, as it has no plan B.\n\nPlan A is to eliminate Russia across the entire – Western – spectrum.\n\nSo what’s new ?\n\nRussophobia, Racism, 24/7 psyops, propaganda at full speed, interrupting culture online, it doesn’t matter; facts matter: Russia has enough nuclear / hypersonic hardware to crush NATO in the minutes before breakfast and teach a lesson to the collective West before the aperitif before dinner.\n\nThere will probably come a time when some exceptional person with a decent IQ will finally understand the meaning of the indivisibility of security\n\nRead\n\nThe era of Old World world leadership is over anyway: However, various options are still possible for its future.\n\nWhat happens to the Senior Citizens Grant of Uganda’s elderly when the donors withdraw from June 2022?\n\nThis is one of the issues that is of concern to many in Uganda these days. While Parliament asks, the Ministry of Finance delays with the answer.\n\n” The Senior Citizens Grant in a nut shellI is universal, transferring US$8.40 a month to everyone aged 65 and over in programme locations. For the conflict affected region of Karamoja, the age of eligibility is reduced to 60 years. Recipients receive the payment securely through an electronic payment via mobile phone.”\n\nThe project became very popular and more and more politicians are demanding that project to be introduced in their districts.\n\nToday, around 300,000 Ugandans receive old-age benefits.- a number of African countries are building up their own national welfare schemes often with very good results.\n\nCash support is a key instrument and financed by the United Kingdom and Ireland with a total of US$ 14 million per year. 80 percent of this goes to the Senior Citizens Grant.\n\nUganda funds old-age pensions to 37 districts, and each district consists of a number of sub-counties.- the annual total cost for Uganda was US$ 13 million in 2022, from June 2022 the cost will increase further, when Ireland and the United Kingdom reduce their financial contributions.\n\nUganda’s weak tax revenues are a major problem for the financing of such programs.The majority of Uganda’s population – most farmers – work in the informal sector and do not pay taxes to the state.\n\nResearchers estimate that a full rollout of the program to include all older people over the age of 65 would cost an amount equivalent to 0.4 percent of Uganda’s GDP.\n\n– global support for innovative solutions for social welfare emerges mainly through core contributions and thematic contributions to the UN, the World Bank and voluntary organizations. In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, support was provided for multi-year funds under the auspices of the World Bank; Rapid Social Response.\n\n– the money from this fund has now been used up, and it is unclear whether it will be continued.\n\nRapid Social Response has, among other things, contributed to pilot projects, capacity building, system design and dissemination of knowledge about social security projects, and laid the foundation for increased program support from other parts of the World Bank.\n\nIn the humanitarian field, global support has been given to organizations that are increasingly making use of cash transfers.among these is the World Food Program (WFP).\n\nWhy dont you bring?\n\nThat:s the question Uganda’s elected officials are now being asked by their constituents; Elderly voters and their families are tired of hearing that elderly people in neighboring districts get. Now they also want and what they want is a new type of minimum wage for the elderly, call it “old-age pension.”\n\nFlavia Rwabuhoro Kabahenda is a Ugandan Politician, Woman member of Parliament representing Kyegegwa district in the 11th Parliament of Uganda representing the NRM: she is also Chairperson Parliament committee of gender labor and social development and led a separate group in parliament working to strengthen the country’s social safety net;\n\nFor her it was a battle that engaged and initiated pilot projects; one for the elderly and one for particularly vulnerable groups.\n\nThis was done at the initiative of Uganda’s Ministry of Gender Equality, Labor and Social Affairs and with the support of international donors. Five years later, a plan was adopted for the gradual expansion of the program at national level – funded by the Ugandan authorities, with the support of United Kingdom and Ireland; fund pilot projects in 15 districts in the north.\n\n– in practice some of the country’s poorest areas but with a view to Uganda itself being able to take over the financing at a later date.\n\nSince 70 percent of Uganda’s extremely poor were among people over the age of 65, it was agreed that the measure could have something to do with it.\n\nBut still, can it be continued?\n\nCivil society organizations took the lead. They referred to very good experiences with various types of cash support for vulnerable groups in other African countries, and fronted the social security proposals before the committee in parliament – while the opposition in parliament was especially about a social security project that would reward laziness. Some also believed that such projects would weaken the traditional African extended family model, where people have a moral duty to take care of their elderly parents.\n\nAnother argument was the consideration of the country’s economy; poor Uganda could simply afford to bear such burdens; with different types of social welfare schemes such as:\n\nOld-age benefits – is a non-contributory social pension of some Ugandan shillings a month. In the first districts it was introduced, all older people above the age of 65 were eligible for the scheme, except in Karamoja where the age of eligibility was lowered to 60 years to reflect the lower life expectancy.\n\nChild benefits – social protection mechanisms in Uganda include cash transfers to vulnerable groups; pensions for the elderly, grants to children headed households and people with disabilities. These mechanisms include access to nutrition, health care, housing and education.\n\nSocial security for the disabled – Uganda inherited a formal social security system established by the colonial administration that caters for both public and private employees. Uganda has a multi-tier pension system model with contributory social insurance, non-contributory direct income support and voluntary private pension schemes.\n\nThe Senior Citizen Grant /social security project has received overwhelmingly positive feedback. It has created many new opportunities and is easy for most people to understand: Everyone over the age of 65.\n\nThe project has made significant contributions to reducing poverty, strengthening household finances and improving employment – the fear of increased laziness seems to have been unfounded.\n\nThe older ones themselves work fewer hours than before, but now they rather hire younger farmers to dig in the soil for them.There are also results for health – in that several of the households can afford to go to the health clinic and buy medicine. Another important finding is that the number of hours of child labor in households has been reduced, while the number of hours spent on school work has increased.\n\nThe success of the pilot projects and increasing demands from voters have meant that parliamentary and government politicians have also joined the team.- many have been invited to “pay day” in the districts to see what happens and how it goes. They get to talk to people and see how they spend the money they get paid.\n\nThe recipients buy food or pay for the grandchildren’s schooling, others save and buy for example a piglet or some chickens. The local marketplace is full of sellers this DAY – this has become a highly political issue, with ever wider support.\n\nNo matter where NRM travels, there are questions about old-age benefits."
