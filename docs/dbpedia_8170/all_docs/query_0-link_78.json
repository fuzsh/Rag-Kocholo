Loquacity’s truly your forte! Yellow one, shall I list your disasters, One by one to your Bedouin masters? You dullard! Your real name is coffee, To all who imbibe, catastrophe! A fruit you are not, nor a savour, Nor relief for the tired from their labour. But me, I give all relaxation, I’m a balm, soothing wounds and vexation.” (Holes 1996: 312 ll. 16 – 20)\n\nThe passage above belongs to a poem written by a Bahraini named ʿAbdallāh Ḥusayn al-Qārī in 1955. The poem recounts how, on a Thursday evening – traditionally a time for relaxation and leisure – the poet is lying on his bed watching the coffee-pot and the tea-kettle bubbling away in front of him. Suddenly, the two come to life, greet him, and ask him to adjudicate a dispute between them. A bitter discussion follows, during which each of the contenders pleads its case in order to establish its own superiority over its rival. After a series of extravagant and colorful pleas, the poet rules that both beverages are to marry each other, thus reflecting the Gulf tradition of alternately drinking small cups of bitter coffee and sweet tea. The poem is part of a locally published dīwān, which contains poems composed in Bahrain between the 1930’s and 1950’s. The poems deal, half in earnest half in jest, with contemporary, vibrant topics, such as ‘Pearl-Diving versus Oil Wells’. However, poems of the same type had been composed in roughly the same area for over four thousand years. The striking similarity between these 20th century CE debates and their ancient Mesopotamian forerunners is clear from reading, for instance, a passage from the Sumerian debate between Bird and Fish, composed some four thousand years earlier, during the reign of King Šulgi of Ur (21st century BCE). In that text, both contenders assert their precedence over the other litigant by means of no less colorful arguments and vocabulary:\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1515/9781501510274-001\n\n2\n\nEnrique Jiménez and Catherine Mittermayer\n\nBird replied to Fish: (…) “Your mouth is a mound of ruins, surrounded by teeth, you cannot look behind you! Cripple, your limbs are clipped, your fins are to the right and left of your neck! Your foul smell make people vomit and wrinkle their nose. (…) But I am the beautiful, wise bird! Fair artistry was put into (the finishing of) my inlays, While no equal effort has been applied to your pale body. Strutting around in the king’s palace, I am an adornment.” (Mittermayer 2019: 71 ll. 56 – 71)\n\nCertain features of debate literature remain stable from its earliest inception to its most recent avatars. First and foremost, debates normally present two litigants (such as trees, animals, drinks, seasons or human beings) and basically have a tripartite structure: 1. Introduction describing the contestants and the occasion of the disputation 2. Disputation proper 3. Judgement scene The main part, the verbal disputation, is formally structured as a dialogue and contains highly sophisticated speeches. No transcendent question is at stake in these light-hearted texts: the litigants simply try to argue their superiority over their rivals. As stated in one of the Akkadian poems, two animals came to quarrel because “their hearts rejoiced in disputation.” In scholarly literature, texts consisting mainly of dialogue are frequently divided between disputations/debates and dialogues. Such labels can be misleading, as they result in an artificial segregation of a coherent group of texts, as was the case of the Sumerian dialogues and disputations (Mittermayer 2019: 2– 7). As Carmen Cardelle de Hartmann (2007: 265 – 66) shows, the dialogue form is a basic component of several text categories, among them instructive or philosophic dialogues as well as disputations. The present volume, therefore, includes papers on texts traditionally classified as “dialogues” and on texts labelled in the secondary literature as “disputations,” in an attempt to regroup traditions that have earlier been studied separately, but which should be considered together. The difference between “disputations” and “dialogues,” if there is any, should be considered in each of the cultures in which they appear: whereas in Egyptian literature there is a difference between disputations and “scientific” dialogues (see the paper by Andréas Stauder), in Syriac literature texts traditionally classified as belonging to both categories were transmitted side by side (Sebastian Brock). Texts usually classified as “disputations” differ substantially in the many traditions in which they are attested. They can be independent compositions\n\n1 Introduction\n\n3\n\nor part of larger literary works, and vary in length, style and purpose (e. g. humoristic vs instructive). These differences reflect the strong embeddedness of the disputations in their own literary tradition and justify the integration of seemingly different kind of texts in this volume. However, as stated in Jiménez 2017: 11– 12), it is possible to postulate the existence of a set of universals, features that are common to the texts in most literary traditions in which they appear. These universals are: 1. Disputations are poetic texts, usually written in verse or in literary prose. 2. The structure of disputations is usually tripartite: introduction, disputation proper, and adjudication 3. The second section (“disputation proper”) normally contains only dialogue. Their dialectical character sets disputations apart from fables, which are usually narrative texts. 4. The litigants, generally two, tend to be entities that are otherwise non-articulate, such as trees, animals, and human types. 5. The only goal of the discussion is to establish the pre-eminence of one of the speakers. Since no serious matter is at hand, disputations tend to be humorous. Texts fulfilling all or most of these universals represent a relatively rare category in world literature. However, they have a remarkably long history: we can trace a history of this text type that spans almost four thousand years, from the 21st century BCE to the 21st century CE. The oldest known disputations were written in the Sumerian language, the earliest recorded language in history. Most of them were composed at the end of the third millennium BCE, but their manuscripts date to the first part of the second millennium BCE. Three different categories of Sumerian debates can be established: precedence debates (see the contribution by Catherine Mittermayer), debates between students (Manuel Ceccarelli) and those between two women (Jana Matuszak). In all three categories, the debates are carefully constructed pieces of rhetoric, which make use of a plethora of devices to make their arguments convincing: it is often clear from the arguments who the winning and who the losing party would be. The oldest manuscript of an Akkadian disputation dates to around the same time as the manuscripts of the Sumerian ones, viz. the first quarter of the second millennium BCE. Its prologue, clearly inspired by Sumerian models, tells how the first king of the city of Kish planted a tamarisk and a palm in his courtyard, thus provoking their unremitting enmity (Andrew R. George). Whereas the Sumerian disputations appear to have died out after the first quarter of the second millennium BCE, their Akkadian counterparts continued to be transmitted and adapted for almost two millennia. The latest manuscripts of Akkadian debates\n\n4\n\nEnrique Jiménez and Catherine Mittermayer\n\ndate to the second century BCE, but by then the genre was a literary fossil (Enrique Jiménez). Perhaps influenced by Mesopotamian models, disputes of quarrelling pairs first appear in Egypt during the 14th century BCE, with the Trial of Body and Head (Bernard Mathieu). Egyptian disputations are related, and probably derived from, the so-called “discourses,” dialogues or monologues with performative features that flourished during the Middle Kingdom (2000 – 1700 BCE), and whose Sitz im Leben was – as in the case of the Mesopotamian debates – the royal court (Andréas Stauder). The Fable of Jotham (Judges 9: 7– 21) is almost the sole witness to a Northwest Semitic tradition of disputation poems in Antiquity. Clearly an adaptation of a once independent composition, it opens a small window onto a now lost ancient tradition of disputations in Hebrew, and represents one of the earliest examples of the adaptation of a disputation for a new literary context (Andrés Piquer Otero). A famous Parthian disputation was composed in late Antiquity: the “Assyrian Tree” (Draxt ī āsūrīg), which displays clear influences of the Babylonian tradition (Firuza Abdullaeva). The genre resurfaces in Syriac in the 4th century CE in the works of Ephrem of Nisibis. Influenced by the Jewish Aramaic literary tradition, they often feature biblical characters as protagonists (Sebastian Brock). From the beginning of its written tradition, Armenian literature was in close contact with the Western and Southern neighboring cultures. Armenian debates are first attested in the 5th century, in the form of translations of poems by Ephrem. Independent Armenian debates, however, are only attested from the beginning of the 17th century CE onwards, coinciding with the rising popularity of itinerant bards (Sergio La Porta). The first Arabic disputations (munāẓara and muḥāwara) appear around the 9th century CE, and the genre survives in Arabic literature until the present day. Some of the topics, such as Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter, are attested since the time of al-Jāḥīẓ (9th century CE) until the 20th century CE (Geer Jan van Gelder). A relatively late comer to the Arabic tradition, Night and Day, is attested in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literature (David Larsen). Arabic disputations were highly influential, and were skillfully emulated by Hebrew poets in Spain, who adapted them to the Hebrew literary tradition and inserted frequent references to Biblical and Rabbinical literature (Amparo Alba). Turkish debates, first attested in the 11th century CE, bloomed during the Ottoman period: Turkish poets showed a weakness for disputes between mind-altering substances, the first of which (‘Hashish and Wine’) was written by the famous poet Fuzûlî (Hatice Aynur). The Persian tradition of literary disputations, whose roots plunge deep into the Parthian period, flourished during the Iranian Renaissance and\n\n1 Introduction\n\n5\n\nfound its most famous cultivator in Asadī Ṭūsī, who added a socio-political and religious dimension to the Persian disputations. He is the first to write a debate poem on the contest between the Arabs and the Persians, a topic that will remain popular for hundreds of years (Asghar Seyed-Gohrab). In Medieval Europe, the genre of the debate emerges during the Early Middle Ages. The oldest examples are written in Latin and date to the 8th and 9th century CE. They are heavily dependent on bucolic poetry, in particular on Vergil’s Eclogues (Vicente Cristóbal and Juan Luis Arcaz Pozo). In the following centuries, debate poetry flourishes in vernacular European languages. The debate of The Owl and the Nightingale was written in Middle English around 1200 CE, at a time when Latin and French were the literary languages (Thomas Honegger). The genre in England was influenced by the Occitan tensos, which have a similar structure and are attested throughout the Middle Ages. They also constitute the “point de passage” for the French débat, a genre that develops in the 15th century and falls at the confluence between lyric poetry and the Latin conflictus (Laëtitia Tabard). Two literatures whose traditions of disputations began in the early Middle Ages, Syriac and Arabic, still cultivated the millennia-sanctioned genre in the 19th and 20th centuries. Disputation poems composed in an elevated vernacular Arabic are attested in the Gulf well into the 20th century: they use the old form to discuss topics as current as “Pearl Diving vs Oil Wells.” The astounding survival of the genre in popular poetry can perhaps be linked with the no less astonishing existence of certain Akkadian loanwords in the local dialects (Clive Holes). Neo-Aramaic dialogue and dispute poems, in contrast, do not represent a living genre: the handful of known Neo-Aramaic dialogues are translations of Classical Syriac debates, only one of which, “The Cherub and the Thief,” is used in liturgy still today (Alessandro Mengozzi). Chinese ludic disputations attest to the existence of a parallel tradition in the Far East, whose origin goes back to the rhetorical tradition of the Warring States period (453 – 221 BCE). Beginning in the Tang dynasty (618 – 907 CE), Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese literature started imitating and adapting the Chinese models (John Chaney). A double paradox surrounds the transmission of disputations. First, there is a tension between the vertical, transcultural aspects of the transmission and their horizontal role in the individual literary traditions in which they are attested (Reinink and Vanstiphout 1991: 2, Jiménez 2017: 148 – 49). Indeed, although disputations represent a wandering literary type, they are remarkably well integrated in the different traditions in which they appear. Thus, while undoubtedly related to their Sumerian counterparts, Akkadian disputations allude to and quote from other works of Akkadian literature, and not from Sumerian literary works. It\n\n6\n\nEnrique Jiménez and Catherine Mittermayer\n\nwould be absurd to postulate that the embeddedness of disputations in Sumerian and Akkadian means that they emerged independently in both of them, since the two literatures remained in close contact for the greater part of their existence. However, the more removed in time and space two literary traditions are from each other, the more difficult it becomes to postulate a borrowing. The second paradox in the history of disputations involves the channels of transmission. Not a single case of direct transmission, i. e., of translation of one disputation into another language, is known (Jiménez 2017: 125 – 27). This fact is perhaps best explained by the deep cultural embeddedness of the texts, which made them unpalatable products for any culture other than the one in which they originated. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, disputations are literary texts, and indeed frequently highly sophisticated literary texts: their bookish character would seem to militate against the oral transmission of literary disputations. If a written transmission is not attested, and an oral tradition seems impossible, how were disputations transmitted? One has to follow Clive Holes in assuming that two parallel transmission channels existed, a “high,” literate channel, and a “low,” popular level (Holes 1995: 103 and id. in this volume). Both sets of axes –vertical and horizontal, high and low– should, therefore, be studied simultaneously to gain a holistic understanding of the transmission of the genre and of its various incarnations. The diversity of languages and literary traditions in which disputations are attested makes it impossible for a single scholar to study the genre diachronically, or to decide whether or not the genre was transmitted throughout all these cultures and periods, or rather originated independently in different places as different times. Because of the complexity of the topic, it is a highly suitable theme for a group of scholars to treat within the framework of a multidisciplinary volume. The present volume has one illustrious predecessor: the pioneering, muchcited volume by Gerrit J. Reinink and Herman Vanstiphout Dispute Poems and Dialogues in the Ancient and Mediaeval Near East (1991) with articles on Sumerian, Akkadian, Hebrew, Byzantine, Syriac, and Medieval Arabic and Latin disputations. That volume represents the proceedings of the symposium “The Literary Debate in Semitic and Related Literatures,” held in 1989 at the University of Groningen. Over the course of the past thirty years a wealth of new information has become available, which has substantially altered our picture of disputations in many of the literary traditions in which they are attested. The Groningen volume remains, however, a model of interdisciplinary work and a must-have manual for\n\n1 Introduction\n\n7\n\ndiverse fields. The present editors can only hope that this book will be a fitting tribute to Reinink and Vanstiphout and a worthy continuation of their labor. *** The volume contains the proceedings of two consecutive international conferences, in Madrid (2017) and Geneva (2018). The first, entitled Disputation Poems in the Near East and Beyond. Ancient and Modern, was organized by Enrique Jiménez at Universidad Complutense (Madrid) on 12– 13 July 2017. The main concern of the Madrid conference was the study of the transmission of the genre of disputation in the Near East throughout the ages. The conference was generously funded by the Department of Hebrew and Aramaic Studies, The Institute of Sciences of Religions (both Universidad Complutense de Madrid), The Spanish Center of Near Eastern Studies, the Anneliese Maier Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (courtesy of Maribel Fierro), and the Spanish Association of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. A special debt of gratitude is owned to Andrés Piquer Otero, without whose generous assistance the conference would not have been possible. The second conference, entitled 4000 mille ans de disputes: de l’Orient à l’Occident, was organized by Catherine Mittermayer at Université de Genève on 15 – 16 February 2018. The participants of the Geneva conference focused on formal and generic features of disputations in a wide range of cultures, which included traditions from medieval Europe and the Far East. Particular attention was paid to the question of the dialogues on the one hand as a formal designation of disputations and on the other hand as a distinct taxonomy of texts. The Geneva conference was financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation within the scope of the four year project “Disputation Literature in the Ancient Near East: A text editing project.” Warmest thanks are expressed to Prof. Carmen Cardelle de Hartmann for her presence and insightful remarks during the conference. The group of scholars that participated at both conferences was both international and multidisciplinary – reflecting the tradition of disputations itself. The editors would like to express their gratitude to the speakers for their outstanding lectures and papers, and to the audiences on both occasions for some enriching and lively discussions. Thanks are also expressed to the two anonymous peer-review readers of the volume and to the editor of the series for their valuable remarks.\n\n8\n\nEnrique Jiménez and Catherine Mittermayer\n\nBibliography Cardelle de Hartmann, Carmen. 2007.

In Sumerian literature, there exist a number of texts that are referred to by modern scholars as “precedence poems,” “disputation (poems)” or “debate (poems).” The exact number of these texts is highly controversial, as can best be seen in the most recent volume that was published on the “Dispute Poems and Dialogues in the Ancient and Mediaeval Near East.”¹ Whereas Jean Bottéro (1991: 11) listed seven “tensons,” some pages later Herman Vanstiphout (1991: 25 – 26) studied ten Sumerian “disputations/debate poems.” The discussion on the number of precedence debates is still ongoing (see Tab. 1). Recently, Enrique Jiménez (2017: 13 – 14) established a number of six Sumerian “disputation poems,” which is comparable to the rather short lists given by van Dijk (1953: 41), Gordon (1960: 145 – 46), Cunningham (2007: 386)² and Herrmann (2010: 41– 47). Some years earlier, Konrad Volk (2012) had based his article on the term “Streitgespräch” in the “Reallexikon für Assyriologie und Vorderasiatische Archäologie” on nine disputations “im engeren Sinne (…) zwischen Werkzeugen, Abstraktionen, Gegenständen, Pflanzen und/oder Tieren” and three disputations “historischen (epischen) und mythologischen Charakters” which makes a total of twelve compositions. With the creation of subcategories for the disputations he follows a line opened by Dietz Otto Edzard (1987– 90) who differentiated between “(epische) Streitgespräche” and “Schulstreitgespräche” (Edzard 1987– 90: 43 – 44). Only a few years later, Claus Wilcke (1992) suggested three subcategories, namly “Streitgedichte historischen Charakters,” “Streitgedichte mythologischen Charakters” and “Streitgedichte über naturkundliche Themen.”³ Six texts have been present in every proposition since the nineteen-fifties: Tree and Reed, Copper and Silver, Hoe and Plough, Ezinam and Ewe,⁴ Winter and Summer, Bird and Fish.

The doxology is a stereotypical formula stating the winner and praising a god(ess) for the fact that one has surpassed the other.⁵ This is normally done with the following words: A B-e a-da-min3 du11-ga / A B-(r)a diri-ga-ba / god(ess) (+ epithet) za3 mim “(Divinity) is praised for (the fact) that A has surpassed B in the disputation held between A and B.”\n\nThe same doxology is also present in Dumuzi and Enkimdu as well as in Enmerkara and Ensukukešdana, two disputations normally excluded from the discussion because of their human protagonists and/or their differing structure.⁶ Vanstiphout (1990: 272) argued against a grouping of the a-da-min3 based on their doxologies. He emphasizes that “it does not indicate, or at least was not intended to indicate, a generic category. Therefore the occurrence of the term is not decisive for the adscription of a given poem to the genre, and should certainly not be used to group together compositions which are obviously different in nature, as is sometimes done on this slippery ground.”⁷ If in the present paper all eight texts mentioning the term a-da-min3 in the last lines are grouped together, this is not based on the assumption that a-da-min3 designates an emic genre. Vanstiphout (1990: 272) is right by saying “this is merely a name for the main or the only action described in the text, viz. a verbal contest.” But if we want to study the a-da-min3 contest in Sumerian literature we have to study all the texts which show this designation in their doxology and not only those that correspond to our perception of what a debate should be. The basic structure of the eight precedence debates mentioned above encompasses five parts:⁸ (1) Prologue (2) Transition 1 (giving the occasio litigandi)\n\n The deity is not necessarily identical with the judge (see Tab. 2).  For a detailed analysis of the structure of these two texts see Mittermayer 2019a: 10 – 11; see also Wilcke 1975: 251. Both texts are integrated in the lists of Edzard (1987– 90), Wilcke (1992) and Volk (2012).  See also Jiménez 2017: 13 – 14. Contra Wilcke (1975: 250 – 51) who understands the term a-damin3 as a genre designation.  This is an extension of the classical structure given by van Dijk (1975: 39 – 40). See already Mittermayer 2009: 45. Vanstiphout (1990: 287– 288) also reconstructed a five-partite structure for the a-da-min3, differing from my reconstruction only in point 4 (Transition 2 vs. Vanstiphout’s “D: Narrated actions” as we have them e. g. in Bird and Fish).\n\n14\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\n(3) Main part (4) Transition 2 (giving the decision of at least one party to see a judge) (5) Verdict (with reconciliation) The main part reports the a-da-min3 contest held between the two protagonists. An a-da-min3 is limited to a verbal exchange⁹ and it consists of alternate speeches, which can vary in length, form, and number (see Tab. 2).

In four cases the number of speeches is even, and in two of these four cases the loser is (in an exception to the general rule) the first speaker. If we compare the length of the speeches in these four debates it becomes obvious that the winner always benefits in total from more speaking time than his opponent (see Tab. 3).¹⁰ It seems a prerogative for the winner to speak longer.\n\n Even though more concrete or physical confrontations can mirror these verbal contests. In Bird and Fish, the latter attacks Bird’s nest physically and kills the fledglings. In return, Bird destroys Fish’s spawn. The physical fight is not part of the a-da-min3, but it contributes to the characterization of the protagonists (see Mittermayer 2019a: 81– 83 and ead. 2019b). Alster (1990: 4) suggests, on the basis of the Enmerkara texts (Enmerkara and the Lord of Aratta, Enmerkara and Ensukukešdana), that an a-da-min3 “could also be a duel performed by two persons.”  The line numbers in Table 3 are based on score texts that I prepared for my habilitation. Tree and Reed is omitted, as this debate cannot yet be fully reconstructed. The numbers given for Bird and Fish correspond to the long version; in the short version Fish’s first speech is even shorter.

In the following, I would like to show that this advantage on the winner’s side is not limited to the structure of the contest. It can also be observed in the quality of the speeches, viz. on the level of argument. Vanstiphout (1990: 280) has already suggested that “in most cases the victor wins on rhetorical points: he is the cleverest debater. This has to do with the nature of the contenders, insofar as one of the means used by the clever victor consists in building up a cogent presentation of the superiority of the values he represents over those of his antagonist.” If we accept that the “cleverest debater” is the winner, this has to be seen in the organization and presentation of his speeches. Alster and Vanstiphout (1987: 9) have already postulated, that “one should start from the result, and see whether the means used by the contestants are effective towards the goal desired (in the case of the winner) or not (in the case of the loser) and why this is so.” But this idea has never been taken up. In my research on the Sumerian precedence debates I was able to detect a number of argument techniques that can be found in most of the a-da-min3:¹¹ – self-praise – disparagement – self-presentation – comparison – expression of relationship – refutation – outperformance – anticipation – demand – reproach – threat\n\n For a thorough discussion of these techniques see Mittermayer 2019a: chapter 6.\n\n16\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nSelf-praising and disparagement are the basic techniques employed in every speech. They can be labeled as unidimensional, as they focus either on the speaker or on the winner: self-praise “I am good” vs. disparagement “you are bad”\n\nIn the course of self-praising more complex techniques can be used. They are all two-dimensional in the sense that they construct an argument in favor of the speaker or against the opponent by involving the other party. See for example the following comparison: “I am strong (in a certain situation), you are weak (in the same situation)”\n\nAs the precedence debate between Ezinam and Ewe ¹² is normally described by scholars as being very balanced,¹³ it provides a good starting point for the study of the quality of speeches.¹⁴ At the beginning of the debate, a long tripartite prologue takes us back to a remote past where – in the first scene – people do not yet know sheep and grain (ll. 1– 24). In the second scene (by which time, people have been created), Ezinam and Ewe live among the gods but they cannot sate them (ll. 25 – 35). That is why – in the third scene – Enki and Enlil, two major gods, decide to send them down to the human beings where they introduce animal husbandry and agriculture (ll. 36 – 63).¹⁵\n\n Viz. Sheep and Grain or Ewe and Wheat. As the names of the protagonists are Ezinam (deified grain) and Ewe, the debate should be referred to as Ezinam and Ewe. The name of the protagonists shows another preference for the winner: whereas Ezinam is a goddess, Ewe is a simple animal. Both protagonists are female as they address each other with “my sister.”  See Vanstiphout 1984: 248 n. 36 “the dispute is very evenly constructed, and there seem to be no bias as in our [= Hoe and Plough; C.M.] dispute.” Alster and Vanstiphout (1987: 9 – 10) were the first to show in general lines Ezinam’s superiority and the rhetorical mistakes made by Ewe. But this idea has not been explored further. Bottéro (1991: 18) formulated in a more general way “(…) les combats, dont l’issue est incertaine et dont les spectateurs se demandent toujours qui va gagner”; he suggested that this “élément de hazard” explains the long survival of the precedence debate.  An edition of the text is presented in Mittermayer 2019a: chapter 8.1 (with score text) and Alster and Vanstiphout 1987. A reconstructed text with translation can be found on ETCSL (etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk); for further translations see Vanstiphout 1997: 575 – 578; 2004: 186 – 194.  For the prologue see also Vanstiphout 1990: 292 and Alster and Vanstiphout 1987: 2– 3.\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\n17\n\nThe first transition explains why the two of them start an a-da-min3 contest. It is not for a very sophisticated reason, they simply get drunk during a banquet (ll. 64 – 69):¹⁶ They were drinking sweet wine, they enjoyed sweet beer. After they had been drinking sweet wine, after they had enjoyed sweet beer, they started a quarrel on the cultivated fields. At the place of the banquet they started the contest.\n\nIn the main part (ll. 70 – 178) Ezinam opens the contest. She (as the grain goddess) will speak three times, whereas Ewe will only have to speeches. In the end Ezinam will be selected as winner.¹⁷ In the first two speeches (Ezinam 1 and Ewe 1), the two contestants present themselves by listing their positive aspects. They both use self-praise as basic technique.¹⁸ Ezinam opens her first speech by praising her beauty (l. 72 “from all the lights in the land I am the most magnificent”). She continues by talking about her force which she confers to the warrior. This “force” is probably an allusion to her being a food product. Ewe’s list of positive qualities is much longer. She provides everybody with wool, leather and oil, and she is the sustenance of the gods (ll. 110 – 112):¹⁹ “The gudu-priest, the ‘anointed-one’ and all those who bathed themselves, after each of them got dressed thanks to me (= my clothes) for my holy purification rites, I will step with them to my holy food allocation.”\n\nThe first round thus seems to favor Ewe because she presents more positive qualities than her opponent (4:2). But in the second (Ezinam 2 and Ewe 2) and the third rounds (Ezinam 3), Ezinam adds two positive qualities per speech: she opens her second speech by referring to the beer she produces, and she ends by praising her own strength. The beginning of her third speech remains difficult to understand, but she seems to present herself as being humble. At the end, she\n\n Ezinam and Ewe 64– 69: ĝeštin niĝ2 du10 i-im-na8-na8-ne / kaš niĝ2 du10 i-im-du10-du10-gene / ĝeštin niĝ2 du10 u3-mu-un-naĝ-eš-a-ta / kaš niĝ2 du10 u3-mu-un-du10-ge-eš-a-ta / a-gar3a-gar3-ra du14 mi-ni-ib-mu2-mu2-ne / ki ĝešbun-na-ka a-da-min3 mu-un-ak-ne.  Cf. the analysis of Alster and Vanstiphout 1987: 3 – 9.  They both end their first and second speeches with a one-line anticipation and a one-line demand. For simplicity’s sake, this pair of arguments is omitted in the figures (and the discussion). As it is present in both parties’ speeches it has no impact on the evaluation of their quality. For a complete evaluation of their speeches see Mittermayer 2019a: chapter 3.4.  Ezinam and Ewe 110 – 112: gudu4 pa4-ses lu2 a tu5-a / šu-luh ku3-ĝa2 um-ma-da-an-mu4re / šuku ku3-ĝa2 ĝiri3 mu-da-an-gub-be2.\n\n18\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nshows that she has a value as a currency, in the sense that the one who has barley can buy an ewe with it (ll. 176 – 178):²⁰ “If someone brings your innards to the market place and puts your very own strap around your neck, one will say to the other ‘fill barley into the measuring cup for my ewe’.”\n\nEnki, the divine judge of the contest, will take up this argument in his judgment where he declares Ezinam the winner. Fig. 1 recapitulates the use of the self-praise in Ezinam’s three and Ewe’s two speeches, respectively. Ezinam utilizes self-praise in all three speeches, listing two positive aspects for herself in each of them. On the other hand, Ewe limits her self-praise to the first speech. In the second she takes over a technique that has been introduced by Ezinam in her second speech: the disparagement, a counterpart to self-praising. Ezinam therefore finally surpasses her opponent by listing more positive aspects (6:4). As a whole, Ezinam gives the impression that she is following an elaborate system by structuring her argument well, whereas Ewe fires all her powder right in the beginning, failing to employ any self-praise in her second speech. If we add self-presentation as third technique to the overview given in Fig. 1, another difference shows up between the two speakers (see Fig. 2 on p. 20). Selfpresentation is a technique that can be found in all the winner’s speeches; it is less typical in the loser’s speeches. The same is true for the present debate. Ezinam opens, and ends, her first speech presenting herself as superior to her rival (ll. 71– 72 and l. 88):²¹ “Sister, I have precedence over you (lit. I am your superior), I stand before you. From all the lights in the land I am the most magnificent.”²² “I am Ezinam-Kusu, I am Enlil’s daughter.”²³\n\nEzinam seems to place this self-presentation consciously at the beginning and at the end, thus creating a framing device for her first speech. In the second speech, the framing device is repeated through the use of self-praise to frame her dispar Ezinam and Ewe 176 – 178: ša3-tur-zu ki.lam-ka lu2 u3-bi2-in-du / tu9niĝ2-dara2 ni2-zu gu2-za u3-bi2-in-la2 / u8-ĝa2 še ĝešba-an-e si-ma-ab lu2 lu2 in-na-ab-be2.  A self-presentation always ends in a copula of the 1st person singular “I am” (Sumerian -meen).  Ezinam and Ewe 71– 72: nin9 dub-saĝ-zu-me-en igi-še3 ma-ra-gub-be2-en / sud-ra2-aĝ2 kalam-ma-ka ĝe26-e giri17-zal-bi-me-en.  Ezinam and Ewe 88: dezinam2 dku3-su3-me-en dumu den-lil2-la2-me-en. Kusu is an epithet of Ezinam.\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\nFig. 1: The use of self-praise and disparagement by Ezinam and Ewe\n\n19\n\n20\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nFig. 2: The framing device in Ezinam 1 and 2\n\nagement of Ewe. On Ewe’s side, no equivalent structure can be detected. Again, Ezinam’s speech gives the impression of being well-prepared and thoughtthrough. As mentioned earlier, more complex techniques, such as comparison, expression of relationship, refutation, and outperformance, can be used in synchrony with the two basic techniques. As the beginning of Ezinam’s first speech shows, up to three techniques can be applied at the same time (l. 71; see n. 22): Sister, I have precedence over you, I stand before you.\n\nThe phrase includes a self-praise because it is a positive statement about the speaker. As it is constructed with the copula at the end (dub-saĝ-zu-me-en literally “I am your superior”), it is at the same time a self-presentation. In contrast to the self-presentation in l. 88 at the end of the first speech (“I am Ezinam-Kusu, I am Enlil’s daughter”) which only refers to the speaker, the self-presentation in l. 71 sets Ezinam in relation to her opponent. We therefore have, in the self-praise and in the self-presentation, an expression of relationship – another technique that is mostly found in the winner’s speeches.\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\n21\n\nFig. 3: The use of the complex techniques in the first speeches\n\nIn her first speech, Ezinam uses the complex techniques of self-presentation and the expression of relationship. None of these techniques were appropriated by Ewe. At the end of her speech Ewe introduces the technique of outperformance. The latter is a very strong technique as it turns the opponent’s argument into an argument for the speaker. To simplify, it could be said that the speaker steals an argument from his adversary. In order to outperform her opponent, Ewe focuses on a positive aspect presented by Ezinam in her first speech. She had praised herself for giving force to the warrior, which alludes to her nutritive aspect. Ewe now argues that different priests allocate her food product (see citation of ll. 110 – 112 above). This elevates her into the religious sphere, as she embodies food that is suitable for gods to eat, whereas Ezinam is food only for warriors. Ewe takes over the argument “I am food for X” and she outperforms Ezinam by adding a higher-ranking consumer. In her second speech, Ezinam reacts to this immediately. She explains that she is preparing beer with Ninkasi, the goddess of beer, and that Ewe’s food products are delivered to her (= Ezinam’s) banquet (ll. 117– 122):²⁴\n\n Ezinam and Ewe 117– 122: babir2 udun-na mim u3 ba-ni-du11 / titab2 udun-na u4 a-ba-niib-zal / dnin-ka-si-ke4 ma-ab-šar2-šar2-re / maš2 gal-gal-zu udu-ua4 gal-gal-zu / ki ĝešbunĝu10 mu-un-til-le-eš / niĝ2-ĝu10-ta a2 gur-ra im-da-su8-su8-ge-eš.\n\n22\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nAfter the sourdough has been carefully prepared in the oven and the draff has spent the day in the oven, Ninkasi is mixing it for me. (Your) big goats and your big breeding rams all end up at my banquet. On bowed legs they all stand far away from my products.\n\nAs her opponent, Ezinam uses the technique of outperformance. She takes up Ewe’s argument that she is doing something with priests (she steps with them to her food allocation) and she tops it by referring to an action she performs with the help of a goddess (preparation of beer). Furthermore, she picks up the word “food allocation/ration” (šuku) used by Ewe and turns it into “banquet” (ĝešbun) which has, of course, a higher status. She concludes by outperforming Ewe’s reference to the products that are delivered to her (= Ezinam’s) banquet, by which she makes clear that she is the protagonist on this banquet. She becomes even more explicit in l. 121, putting her into a relationship with her opponent at the moment of the banquet where Ewe’s products stand far away from Ezinam’s products, which of course indicates that they are less important. She then goes on to attack her opponent. Her disparagement is not a simple accumulation of invectives; rather, she uses this technique to prepare an argument in her favor. The main theme of the disparagement is Ewe’s vulnerability (ll. 128 – 136):²⁵ Snake and scorpion, bandits and creatures of the steppe want your life in the high plain. Day after day you are counted and your tally-stick is put in the ground, so everybody can tell your herdsman how many ewes and young lambs there are and how many goats and young kids there are. When gentle winds call a storm, when gentle winds scatter (everything) they build a milking pen for you.\n\nIn the following self-praise she takes up the last lines of the disparagement and creates the same scene for herself, only with a contrasting outcome (ll. 137– 139):²⁶ When gentle winds call a storm, when gentle winds scatter (everything) I will stand up confronting Iškur (the weather god).\n\nThe repetition of the wind theme allows Ezinam to make a comparison between the two. Whereas Ewe needs shelter, she can confront wind and rain. At the same\n\n Ezinam and Ewe 128 – 136: muš ĝiri2 lu2 la-ga niĝ2 edin-na-ke4 / zi-zu an-edin-na ku-kur ba-ni-ib-be2 / u4 šu2-uš-e niĝ2-ka9-zu i3-ak-e / ĝeš šudum-ma-zu ki i3-ta3-ge / na-gada-za u8 me-a sila4 tur.tur me-a / ud5 me-a maš2 tur.tur me-a lu2 mu-un-na-ab-be2 / tumu tur-ture uru2 di-da-bi / tumu tur-tur-e sag3saga7 di-da-bi / ze4-e e2-ubur-ra ma-ra-an-du3-u3-ne.  Ezinam and Ewe 137– 139: tumu tur-tur-e uru2 di-da-bi / tumu tur-tur-e sag3saga7 di-dabi / diškur-ra gaba-ri-a mu-da-an-gub-be2-en.\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\n23\n\ntime, she surpasses Ewe’s vulnerability with her own strength. This example shows how Ezinam is connecting her own positive qualities to the disparagement of her opponent. The first positive aspect in the second speech (‘beer at the banquet’) surpasses Ewe’s positive aspect (‘food allocation’) and the second outperforms a negative one that Ezinam has attributed to Ewe.\n\nFig. 4: The use of complex techniques in the second speeches\n\nEwe’s second speech is completely based on disparagement. She takes over this newly introduced technique and uses it as a counterpart to the self-praise in her first speech. On the structural level, she seems to follow a very simple system which allows only one basic technique per speech (without any framing device). Limiting herself to disparagement has significant consequences. She cannot employ all of the more complex techniques, and she can only argue against her opponent but not in favor of herself, as Ewe does right in the beginning of her sec-\n\n24\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nond speech. Ewe introduces a refutation to attack Ezinam’s argument that she (Ezinam) is strong and resistant, whereas Ewe is vulnerable (ll. 146 – 152):²⁷ After the evildoer, the expelled, the foreign slave, the young man, the one with the young spouse and the young children, after he tied up everything with his rope of one cubit, after he brought you up to the threshing-floor, after his cudgel pounded your eyes and your mouth and after he […] the block of the barley flour on you, [he makes you be carried] away by the south wind and the north wind.\n\nAs she is employing a disparagement, she can neither refute her own vulnerability nor outperform Ezinam’s strength. She must limit herself to refuting a positive aspect of her adversary’s. Ewe’s vulnerability is uncontested and remains a negative point on her side. Another consequence of the disparagement is that complex techniques can miss their point, as is the case at the end of Ewe’s second speech. She takes up the food/banquet theme developed by Ezinam in her second speech and tries to turn it back into her argument (ll. 160 – 165):²⁸ When you lie on the table, am I above you or beneath you? Ezinam, turn the attention to yourself! Like me you are (just) something to eat. Am I second, (just) because one has looked at your essence/force (me)?\n\nEwe tries to challenge Ezinam’s argument that her goats and rams stand far away from Ezinam’s products. She compares her opponent to herself by saying that both of them are just something to eat. But this comparison is not well chosen, as she ends up downgrading herself. As tertium comparationis she chooses a common ground (both are eatable), but such a comparison only works if the adversary is opposed to a positive aspect of oneself. If the argument is based on a common attribute, every accolade as well as every criticism will be valid for both of them. In the same passage she tries to describe the relationship between the two with two rhetorical questions. In the first she asks whether she is (hierarchically) above or beneath Ezinam. Later she becomes even more explicit with the ques-\n\n Ezinam and Ewe 146 – 152: lu2 ne.ru bar tab-ba saĝ kur-ra / [ĝu]ruš-e lu2 dam tur-ra-ke4 dumu tur-tur-ra-ke4 / eše2-da diš kuš3-na um-ma-an-la2 / ki-su7-še3 um-ma-an-e3-de3 / ĝeš tukul-a-ni igi-zu um-ra-ra ka-zu um-ra-ra / lagab zi3-gu-ka um-ma-ri-in-[…] / tumu u18lu tumu mer-ra bala-še3 mu-˹x˺-[…-ak].  Ezinam and Ewe 160 – 165: ze4-e ĝešbanšur-ra ĝal2-la-zu-ne / an-ta ma-ra-ĝal2-en ki-ta maĝal2-en / dezinam2 ni2-za ĝeš-tu9ĝeštu ak-ni / u3 ze4-e ĝe26-e-gen7 niĝ2-gu7-u3-me-en / me-za igi mi-ni-ib-il2-la-ke4-eš / u3 ĝe26-e egir-bi im-us2-en.\n\n25\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\ntion “Am I second?” This is a question that should never be asked in a precedence debate. The opponent simply has to confirm her second place and the discussion is over. The abortive statement of relationship towards the end of Ewe’s second speech stands in sharp contrast to Ezinam’s first line: “I have precedence over you” (l. ) dub-saĝ-zu-me-en\n\nvs. “Am I second?” (l. ) u ĝe-e egir-bi im-us-en\n\nIn fact, these two statements summarize the whole debate. They reflect the eloquence of the speakers and anticipate the judgment. Ezinam never doubted her superiority. It is obvious that Ezinam, as the winner, uses a wider variety of argumentation techniques than Ewe (see Tab. 4). Furthermore, she employs self-praise in all her speeches, whereas Ewe makes use of self-praise only once. Some techniques are not utilized at all in the loser’s speeches, as, for example, the self-presentation. In addition, Ewe fails by misapplying complex techniques. For example, she attempts a comparison and an expression of relationship but she uses them in the course the disparagement instead of the self-praise (as it is done by Ezinam). Table 4: The use of the argumentation techniques by the two contestants²⁹\n\nSelf-praise Disparagement Self-presentation Refutation Outperformance Comparison Expression of relationship\n\nEzinam \n\nEwe \n\nEzinam \n\nEwe \n\nEzinam \n\n✓ – ✓ – – – ✓\n\n✓ – – – ✓ – –\n\n✓ ✓ ✓ – ✓ ✓ ✓\n\n– ✓ – ✓ – (✓) (✓)\n\n✓ ✓ – ✓ – – ✓\n\nA last point that seems to be a rule in an a-da-min3 but can mainly be observed in the winner’s speeches, is the taking over of a newly introduced technique. Ewe, for example, introduces outperformance in her first speech and Ezinam usurps this technique to show that she is able to surpass her opponent in her line of argument as well. A second example is the refutation introduced by Ewe in her second speech and usurped by Ezinam in her third speech. The\n\n (✓) marks failed techniques; for the reproach in Fish’s first speech see n. 30.\n\n26\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nloser, on the other hand, often neglects this rule. Ewe only appropriates the selfpraise from Ezinam’s first speech but not the self-presentation and expression of relationship. She will come back to the latter in her second speech, but she will fail by using it. After Ezinam’s second speech, Ewe adopts the disparagement, and she attempts to integrate a comparison, but there as well she fails. A comparison with the use of argumentation techniques in the disputation between Bird and Fish (Fig. 5) shows that the observations made above seem to be effective in all the a-da-min3. Again, the winner (Bird) focuses more on self-praise and uses a larger variety of argumentation techniques. Fish limits himself, in his first speech, to the disparagement and the demand,³⁰ which gives him a bad starting position compared to Bird’s powerful first speech. The total number of instances of disparagement in Fish’s speeches surpasses by far the use of this technique in Bird’s speeches. The latter uses disparagement more reasonably and with more control, and he is always combines it with a self-praise. On the other hand, Fish is extremely limited in his self-praise. It is interesting to see that Bird basically takes over the structure of Fish’s speeches, but he always changes or adds a technique to improve it: Fish 1: (Reproach) – Disparagement – Demand Bird 1: Reproach – Disparagement – Self-praise – Demand Fish 2: Disparagement – Reproach – Self-praise – Threat Bird 2: Disparagement – Reproach – Self-praise – Demand\n\nIn his first speech, Bird adds self-praise to the basic structure used by Fish, which is an essential technique in a precedence debate. In his second speech he replaces the threat³¹ with the more convenient demand. Fish, on the other hand, starts with a rather poor speech. In his second speech, he tries to adopt as many techniques as possible from Bird’s first speech (see Fig. 5). He obviously respects the rule that the speaker has to take over the newly introduced techniques of the opponent. Even though he fails (as Ewe did) in his attempt to use outperformance and expression of relationship, he nevertheless considerably improves his second speech.\n\n The reproach marked before Fish’s first speech is actually part of the occasion litigandi in transition 1. Bird integrates this technique into his first speech as if it had been used in the preceding speech.  Fish threatens Bird “I will pay back your false words” (l. 99 sun7-na enim lul-la bala-zu šuza ga-ba-ni-ib-si).\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\nFig. 5: The use of argumentation techniques in Bird and Fish\n\n27\n\n28\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\nThe analysis of Ezinam and Ewe and the comparison with Bird and Fish shows clear discrepancies between the eloquence of the two contestants.³² The winner is a highly skilled orator, whereas the loser seems rather to act on impulse. In Ezinam and Ewe the quality of the loser’s speeches decreases from the first to the second speech, as it is in the second speech that disparagement is introduced, and this technique is often the undoing of the loser. In Bird and Fish the loser opens the verbal contest. He seems to be completely unaware of argumentation techniques, as he only uses the basic techniques of disparagement and demand in his first speech. His second speech improves remarkably, as he can base it on the good example given by Bird. But his inferiority is made clear by his repeated failure to use complex techniques. The dialogue structure of the precedence debates, combined with their aim to surpass the rival by verbal means and to convince the arbiter and the public of one’s merit, make it highly plausible that these texts had a rhetorical background. Even though we do not have a term for “rhetoric” either in Akkadian or in Sumerian, and there is no theoretical evidence for the existence of a rhetorike techne / ars bene dicendi for Ancient Mesopotamia,³³ we do know, especially from a royal hymn of King Šulgi of Ur (21st century BC), that speaking skills were considered praiseworthy.³⁴ In a very interesting passage of this hymn, the king praises himself for having instructed his generals in eloquence (Šulgi B ll. 225 – 227):³⁵ so that the assembly may take decisions by discussing and debating, therefore I taught my generals to discuss and to debate\n\n See already Alster and Vanstiphout (1987: 10) for Ezinam and Ewe and Vanstiphout (1984) for Hoe and Plough.  Sallaberger (2007: 69 – 70) points to the omen series Šumma kataduggû which deal with the “Art und Wirkung von Rede und Verhalten” (edition by Böck 2000: 130 – 147). For rhetoric in Mesopotamia see also Hallo 1996: 170 – 171 and id. 2004: 25 – 26.  Šulgi B; for an edition see Castellino 1972 und ETCSL (etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk). See especially l. 230 enim-ta ĝeštukul-gen7 iri du.du-me-en “I am the one who captures cities with words as (if they were) weapons” and l. 235 ša3 izi-gen7 bar7-a se25-bi mu-zu “I know how to cool down hearts which are burning like fire.”  Šulgi B ll. 225 – 227: ad ge4-ge4-da enim šar2-šar2-da / pu-uḫ2-ru-umki nam tar-tar-re-de3 / šagina-ĝu10-ne-er ad ge4-ge4 mu(‐un)-zu enim šar2-šar2 mu(‐un)-zu.\n\n2 The Sumerian Precedence Debates\n\n29\n\nFurthermore, the myth of Innana and Enki mentions the capacity of “discussing” (ad ge4-ge4), “deliberating” (ša3 kuš2) and “arguing” (du14 mu2-mu2) in a judicial context in a long list enumerating cultural achievements and moral values.³⁶ Šulgi’s self-praise suggests that eloquence was trained in the scribal schools, at least towards the end of the third millennium BC when Sumerian was still the dominant language in southern Mesopotamia. In absence of a theoretical basis for these studies, eloquence seems to have been learned by imitation.³⁷ The precedence debates³⁸ might have served as examples³⁹ for teaching the apprentice scribe, at an advanced stage of his education, the different argumentation techniques.⁴⁰ Thanks to the opposition of a good speaker to a bad speaker in the precedence debates, the student can not only learn how to apply these techniques, but he can also recognize the risks in using more complex techniques. The winner’s speeches serve him as a good example, whereas the loser’s speeches warn him of possible mistakes. In the following Old-Babylonian period (2003 – 1595 BC) Sumerian was no longer an everyday language, but it survived as an official and cultic language. As the large number of manuscripts dating to the Old-Babylonian period show the precedence debates were studied at school in the first part of the second millennium. But did they still form the basis for rhetorical training? Unlike Latin in the Middle Ages, which was the language of the disputationes at the universities, Sumerian did not have a comparable function. It is therefore possible that the Sumerian precedence debates (as well as the debates between students or be-\n\n Innana und Enki I iii 22 du14 [mu2-mu2 u3-ma] ad ge4-ge4 ša3 kuš2-u3 di [ku5 ka-aš bar] “argu[ing, triumphing] discussing, deliberating, judg[ing, decision-making]”; line counting of Farber-Flügge 1973.  The principle of imitatio is well attested for classical antiquity; see Ueding and Steinbrink 2011: 35 and 47.  The manuscripts of the precedence debates all date to the Old-Babylonian Period (2003 – 1595 BC). But as some of them mention Urnamma, Šulgi and Ibbisîn they probably go back to the earlier Ur III Period. This is supported by the attestation of the term a-da-min3 in the administrative texts of the Ur-III Period (see Attinger 1993: 419 with n. 1129 and Herrmann 2010: 65 n. 276). For the discussion of the dating of the a-da-min3 see most recently Jiménez (2017: 24) with related literature and Vacín (2018).  For classical antiquity, the term “Musterrede” is in use; see Ueding and Steinbrink 2011: 15. We should not apply this term to the Sumerian precedence debates as, in contrast to a “Musterrede,” Sumerian precedence debates do not provide any explanatory comments, and they always oppose a good speaker to a bad speaker.  Schäfer (2001: 62– 63) compares the Sumerian precedence debates with the “Synkrisis, die Technik des Vergleichs” who was part of the so-called “Progymnasmata – Übungen, mit Hilfe derer ausgehend von thematischen Vorgaben Ausdrucksfähigkeit und Gliederungsvermögen geschult wurden (p. 63). See also Wagner 2004: 196 and Jiménez 2017: 131.\n\n30\n\nCatherine Mittermayer\n\ntween women) rather served as an instrument to improve the speaking skills of the students. A similar situation can be found in the humanistic education system of the 15th and 16th century AD.⁴¹ After initial exercises in Latin vocabulary and grammar, concentration was then put on oral communication skills. The student first learned single sentences by heart before turning to the dialogi (dialogues between students) (see Bömer 1897: 3 – 5). In Sumerian, single sentences could correspond to the proverbs, by which the scribe could slowly get in touch with the spoken language.⁴² As a second step, he would turn to the precedence debates (and the debates between students and women), perhaps with the diatribe as an intermediate stage.⁴³ The dialogue structure, and the humorous touch of the precedence debates, would be a pleasant tool to integrate and apply the Sumerian vocabulary painstakingly learned from the rather tedious lexical lists.⁴⁴\n\nBibliography Alster, Bendt. 1990.

As George (2005) has pointed out, we have little evidence about the Edubba’a of the Ur III Period, not even knowing which buildings may have been used as schools, but we do know that the Edubba’a was charged with the production and transmission of literary texts in praise of the king. This is what King Sulgi, Urnamma’s son, says in a hymn where he praises himself and his cleverness in the scribal art (Sulgi B 311– 315):² 311. šudu3 e2 kur-ra ki he2-us2-sa-ĝu10-uš 312. dub-sar he2-du šu-ni he2-eb-dab5-be2 313. nar he2-du gu3 hu-mu-un-ni-ri-de2 314. e2-dub-ba-a da-ri2 hur nu-kur2-ru-dam 315. ki-umum da-ri2 hur nu-silig-ge-dam 311.

I would like to thank Catherine Mittermayer for her remarks and suggestions. The present paper was written within the research project “Streitliteratur im Alten Orient: Ein Editionsprojekt” at the University of Geneva financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation.  Volk (2000: 1– 3) discusses various interpretations of this term. For various approaches to the Edubba’a see Sjöberg 1976; Civil 1992; Vanstiphout 2004; George 2005; Waetzoldt and Cavigneaux 2009; Michalowski 2010: 199 – 205; Peterson 2015; Rubio 2009: 39 – 42; id. 2016: 246 – 252.

A singer should be responsible for them too and he should read them from (the tablets). 314. The Edubba’a is not to be changed! 315. The place of Wisdom (ki umum) is not to be given up!\n\nWe have some more information about the Edubba’a from texts of the Old Babylonian Period. By this time, Sumerian was no longer spoken and the students were native Akkadian or Amorite speakers who were required to learn the Sumerian language, which had retained its status and importance as the language of culture and of official cultic practice. According to the texts, the people active in the Edubba’a included masters, overseers, supervisors in matters of discipline, advanced students (the so-called ‘Big Brothers’) and students. Discipline in the school was quite severe. Common reasons for corporal punishment included talking in class, standing up, leaving the classroom, not being able to read the homework aloud, speaking Akkadian, or slurring Sumerian.³ Almost all the manuscripts of literary texts we have from this period are the products of students who learned and wrote them during the final stage of their scribal training.⁴\n\n1.2 Definition of the Text Corpus The literary production of Ancient Mesopotamia is particularly rich. As in the Middle Ages,⁵ we find compositions which can be labeled ‘school disputes’ because they are concerned with school life.⁶ But the matter of definition and terminology is not easy. Mittermayer (2019: chap. 1.2) has established a list of four\n\n See Schooldays (= Edubba’a A) especially ll. 35 – 40 (latest translations by Volk 2015a; Attinger 2017); and Rules of the School (Edubba’a R) sec. 3 ll. 26 – 27 (edition by Gadotti and Kleinerman 2017).  The scribal curriculum was thoroughly studied by Veldhuis 1997 (see especially pp. 40 – 67); Tinney 1999; Veldhuis 2000; Robson 2001; Delnero 2010a; Delnero 2010b; Tinney 2011; see as well Waetzoldt 1989; Civil 1992; Wilson 2008; Ohgama and Robson 2010; Volk 2011.  For an overview, see Cardelle de Hartmann 2007: 58 – 77; for the Late Middle Ages see, for example, the school dialogues and school disputes of Paulus Niavis in Kramarczyk and Humberg (eds.) 2013.  Miguel Civil introduced the designations ‘Dialogue (1, 2, …)’ and ‘Edubba’a (A, B, …)’ in his unpublished A Catalogue of Sumerian Literature; these designations have been adopted by most sumerologists, see Cunningham 2007: 351, 385 (sub school stories), 386 (sub scribal dialogues).\n\n3 An Introduction to the Sumerian School Disputes\n\n35\n\n‘school disputes’ (‘Schulstreitgespräche’);⁷ these same texts had previously been designated as either dialogues or satire.⁸ Mittermayer: ‘school disputes’ Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu → dialogue Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa → dialogue Two Scribes → dialogue Edubba’a D → satire According to Cardelle de Hartmann (2007: 265) a dialogue is: “nicht als Textsorte sondern als Form zu definieren: Die Dialogform stellt eine konkrete Ausprägung der Personensprache und somit eine Möglichkeit der literarischen Gestaltung dar, die in verschiedenen Textsorten Anwendung finden kann. Sie ist durch formale Merkmale charakterisiert.”\n\nSome of the formal characteristics that Cardelle de Hartmann (2007: 261– 63) refers to include: 1. The compositions are centred on a conversation, which have either no narrative sequences at all or only an introduction that explains why the conversation or dispute arose. 2. They involve at least two speakers who are either not, or only scarcely, characterized. 3. They can fulfil different functions. They provide an articulation of the content, which is distributed between the speakers in the form of a variety of arguments. Following Cardelle de Hartmann, we can establish a list of eight to nine ‘school dialogues’ (see below).

Single lines introducing a direct speech occur in Graduate Student and Supervisor (l. 29) and Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa (ll. d 17 – d 18a).\n\n36\n\nManuel Ceccarelli\n\nfied as ‘school disputes’.¹⁰ In these texts, each speaker attempts to present himself as the more outstanding one of the two. School dialogues (i. e. texts in dialogue form concerning school life) are: – Graduate Student and Supervisor (Edubba’a C) ¹¹ – The Wayward Child and his Father (Edubba’a B) ¹² – Examination Text A & B ¹³ – (Rules of the School (Edubba’a R)) ¹⁴ – (Edubba’a E) ¹⁵ – Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu (Dialogue 2) → school dispute – Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa (Dialogue 3) → school dispute – Two Scribes (Dialogue 1) → school dispute – Edubba’a D → school dispute\n\n1.3 School Disputes We know of four compositions in which each speaker tries to outclass his rival in matters of skill, knowledge, and social status. Only in two disputes are the speakers mentioned by name: Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu and Enkimanšum and Ĝiriniša.\n\n1.3.1 Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu are not depicted as junior scribes or students of the scribal art but as music students in training to become singers.¹⁶ Michalowski (2010: 199 – 203) has proposed that this dispute was located in a conservatory, an institution which –according to his proposal– is considered to be separate from the\n\n They correspond to Mittermayer’s list (see above).  Translations by Vanstiphout 1997b, Volk 2015b and ETCSL 5.1.3.  Edition in Sjöberg 1973.  Edition of Examination Text A in Sjöberg 1975.  Rules of the School (= Edubba’a R) begins with a dialogue between a teacher and a student but, as Gadotti and Kleinerman (2017: 90) state, “there is no evidence that the dialogue continued beyond the introduction”; for this reason Rules of the School is not certainly classifiable as a dialogue. The Disputes between two women (A & B) have been excluded as they do not concern school life.  Edubba’a E includes various extracts from other compositions (Schooldays, Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa; Graduate Student and Supervisor; Abaindasa to Sulgi 1 [CKU 4 = ETCSL 3.1.21]), see Volk 2011– 2013: 221.

However, it is equally possible that Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu might just follow a specialised track within the Edubba’a to become singers (Ceccarelli 2018: 136 – 37). This possibility is supported by the fact that, according to the school dialogue Examination Text A, a scribe was expected to know different kinds of songs and how to perform them. It is quite difficult to determine the casus litigandi between Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu, because it is not always clear who is speaking. It seems that Enkiheĝal accuses Enkitalu of having insulted a third person. Enkitalu denies it, and then the dispute begins and continues with many insults coming from both sides. It is noticeable that positive arguments in favor of a speaker are found only at the very beginning and at the end of the dispute. In the central part of the dispute, each speaker attempts to denigrate his rival. In order to settle the dispute, the two students appeal to a ‘Big Brother’, an advanced student, who in turn eventually appeals to an overseer. It seems that the latter exculpates Enkitalu and sets the ground rule that nobody should quarrel in the Place of Wisdom again.\n\n1.3.2 Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa consists of a dispute between two students in training to become scribes.¹⁷ The dispute begins because Enkimanšum wants Enkitalu to recognize him as a ‘Big Brother’. There are some gaps in the text, which prevents a detailed understanding. It seems that Ĝirinisa and Enkimanšum appeal to an overseer to settle their dispute, and this overseer in turn appeals to a teacher. The latter blames Enkimanšum for his insolence and sets the rule that students, here called brothers, should not offend each other.\n\n1.3.3 Two Scribes Johnson and Geller (2015: 1– 2)¹⁸ suggest that the two interlocutors are a ‘professor’ of the Edubba’a and a ‘bureaucrat,’ and that “these two old school buddies have met up again many years after leaving the Edubba.” Since this claim is difficult to prove, I prefer the traditional designation ‘scribes’. A particular feature of this dispute is that each of the scribes only insults his opponent, in an effort to  An edition of this text is in preparation by Klaus Wagensonner and the author.

Neither one praises himself, or says anything positive about himself. The dispute ends quite abruptly when one scribe, who according to the editors was the initiator of the dispute, tells his opponent that he should not fight. Obviously, he means that his opponent is not able to debate at his level.\n\n1.3.4 Edubba’a D This is the only school dispute, which contains the term adamin. ¹⁹ Moreover, it is the only known adamin that ends in a tie (see below § 2.3). The text has only been partially edited. It begins with two scribes testing their skills and scribal knowledge against each other. The dispute degenerates quickly into a tirade of insults.\n\n2 The Structure of the School Disputes 2.1 The Onset In the first twenty lines of Enkitalu and Enkiheĝal and Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa the speeches are quite short; they can even be reduced to a single line. A common difficulty with these disputes is the identification of the speaker because the direct speeches lack introductions. This problem is particularly evident at both the beginning and towards the end of the disputes, because here we find no double ruled lines that graphically mark the speeches. As an example, we can consider ll. a 1– 14 of Enkimanšum and Ĝirinisa: ²⁰ a a a a a\n\n1. dumu e2-dub-ba-a u4-da egir dub-me-ka a-na-am3 ga-ab!-sar-en-de3-en 2. u4-da u-ta ka-enim-ma aš.aš-me nu-sar-en-de3-en 3. na-an-ga-ma um-mi-a ba-zu-zu-ma mu-e-da-sis-en-de3-en 4. a-na an-na-an-ni-ib-ge4-ge4-en-de3-en 5. du ĝe26-e niĝ2-ša3-ĝa2 ga-ab-sar a2 mu-da-aĝ2-en\n\n A partial edition of this text was provided by Civil 1985.

This means that the speaker is wondering why someone appointed his rival as a ‘Big Brother’; I understand nam-ses-gal-ĝu10 as corresponding to an objective genitive: “post of ‘Big Brother’ (of mine =) over me.” The simplest solution is that the speaker who wants to challenge the established hierarchy is Enkimanšum, who wants to know why his rival, not him, was appointed as ‘Big Brother’. If Ĝirinisa were to ask why someone had appointed his rival to his own post of ‘Big Brother,’ it would mean that someone had actually decided to promote Enkimanšum. However, this was not the case, as we know from the rest of the composition (a translation like “why should someone appoint you…” would implicate an epistemic modality, which is unexpected for the prefix {i}). Moreover, the proposed interpretation best matches the structure of the dispute and the break in l. a 9, where a tirade of insults begins: Enkimanšum pretends to give instructions (l. a 5); Ĝirinisa defends his own status as ‘Big Brother’ (l. a 6); Enkimanšum challenges Ĝirinisa’s status (l. a 7– 8); Ĝirinisa answers Enkimanšum, insulting him (l. a 9 – 12). Römer (1990a: 92) and Vanstiphout (1997a: 589) understand the line as part of the speech of Enkimanšum, but their translations (“aus welchem (Grunde) trittst du in meine Eigenschaft (als die) eines >großen Bruders< ein!?”; “why do you encroach on my status of ‘big brother’!”) do not take into account the transitivity of the verbal form.  Interpreting mu-diri-ge-en as {mu+’+e+R+en}.  Variant: “are you qualified for the post of ‘Big Brother’ over me?”  The translation of di-ib-ba is speculative. di-ib-ba could be a syllabic writing for dib+{a}; for dib akk. rabbumma “by all means(?),” see CAD R, 17 s.v. rabbumma. A second possibility is\n\n40\n\nManuel Ceccarelli\n\na a a a\n\n10. deaf to the scribal art and dumb for the Sumerian language, 11. with clumsy hands, which are unfit for the stylus 12. and for the clay-tablet, with hands, which cannot keep up with the mouth,²⁶ 13. are you a scribe like me?”\n\na 14. E.: Why should I not be a scribe like you?\n\nThe attribution of the speeches to Ĝirinisa or Enkimanšum is based on secondary evidence that comes at the end of the dispute where the master criticizes Enkimanšum for his arrogance in insulting and bragging to his ‘Big Brother’. It is thus quite certain, that Ĝirinisa is the speaker in l. 6, where he defends his position as ‘Big Brother’. Using this assumption, it is possible to determine who speaks the other lines. An example of a different kind of onset is the dispute Two Scribes (Two Scribes 1– 10):²⁷ 1. dumu e2-dub-ba-a u4-ul-la-am3 ĝa2-nu ga-na ga-ab-sa2-sa2-en-de3-en 2. tukum-bi nam-dub-sar-ra i3-zu a-na-am3 i3-šid 3. mu AŠ.AŠ zi-ga nam-dub-sar-ra 4. niĝ2-zi-ĝal2 edin-na za3 lu2 šu-ka-še3 5. i3-sar egir-bi gu2 mu-e-du3 6. a-ra2 igi diri niĝ2-ka9 sahar ĝar-ra za3-bi-še3 i3-zu 7. ka-enim-ma nam-dumu-e2-dub-ba-a-ke4-ne 8. ga-ab-šid-en-de3-en diri-zu-še3 i3-zu 9. ĝa2-nu gaba-ri-ĝu10-še3 gub-ba in-zu ga-mu-ra-ab-til 10. lu2-tumu u2-hub2\n\nĝeš-tu9\n\nĝeštu la2-a\n\n1.

Also Edubba’a D begins in media res, with a student challenging his classmate on his scribal skills and knowledge (Edubba’a D 1– 7):³¹ 1. lu2-tur [dumu e2-dub-ba-(a)-me-en dumu] ˹e2˺-[dub-ba-me-en] 2. ˹tukum˺-bi ˹dumu e2-dub-ba˺-[(a‐)me-en] 3.

A:”You are young, how can you talk (properly) with your mouth?” 6. B:”I have repeatedly listened to the comments of my teacher. 7. With these words I will answer to you“\n\nIt is evident that in Two Scribes as well as in Edubba’a D that there is no concrete casus litigandi between the two opponents, but rather the wish to debate. I will come back on this point in § 4.\n\n Johnson and Geller (2015: 102– 103) understand l. 9 to be a single-line speech by Scribe B. This is questionable because five manuscripts present a double ruled line after this line but not after l. 8; see also Matuszak 2019: 5, 13.  lu2-tumu is a recurring insult in the disputes, see Johnson and Geller 2015: 104– 106.  These texts are Graduate Student and Supervisor, Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu, Edubba’a E and Schooldays. I understand u4 ul-la-am3 as an expression indicating “the day is late = late in the day.” For the grammatical and semantic interpretation of this line see the discussion in Attinger (2002/2019 n. 1 ad l. 1): “Ecolier, dépêche-toi;” Volk (2015a: 110, 420): “zukünftiger Schulabsolvent;” Matuszak (2019: 12) “(He,) Schüler, es ist schon spät.” See also Koslova (2014: 317) “—Schüler! – immer (bereit)!” and Cavigneaux (2019) “—”Schüler!”, – “immer (zu Diensten)!”.”  Reconstructed text after Civil 1985: 69.\n\n42\n\nManuel Ceccarelli\n\n2.2 Some Features of the Disputes As an example of the structure of disputes, I will discuss some passages from Enkiheĝal und Enkitalu. The core of the dispute consists of short tirades of insults, often ending with a rhetorical question that employs standard formulations, for example “and you would be a human being?,” “and you would be my opponent?,” or “do you really want to quarrel with me?” Most of the speeches in Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu are only weakly related to each other: a speaker does not reply directly to all the insults directed at him by his opponent. Mostly he replies only to a portion of the insults, introduces some new arguments, and occasionally he comes back to the preceding offense in a successive speech. Consider the following example (Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu 82– 99):³² 81. gu3 de2-de2 zi2-za nar-e-ne 82. bun2 du11-du11 im šu-a nu-guru6 83. mah-bi gu7-gu7 ša3-gal-bi i3-hul-lu 84. dim2-ma sah4 ĝalga hulu-dim2-ma ma-ni-ib2-gi4-gi4-in 85. uĝ3-e ba-an-la2 uĝ3-e ba-an-la2 86. šu dag-dag-ge e-sir2-ra ni10-ni10 87. e2 lu2-ne-ka gu2 gid2-gid2 e2 a-ra2-bi zu! 88. lu2 si-ga dumu lum-ma buluĝ3-ĝa2 89. enim gaba-ri-ka mu-da(‐an)-gub-be2-en 90. lu2-tumu lu2 lul-ta du.du 91. in tub2-tub2-bu niĝ2 ni2-ba nu-un-zu 92. lu2 saĝ šal-la na-ĝa2-ah lu2 kara2-ga 93. ĝe26-e-gen7 nam al-dim2-me-en 94. ĝešza3-mim an-da-ĝal2 nam-nar nu-un-zu 95. a-ga-aš ge4 ge4-me-a-aš-e-ne 96. ad ša4 za-pa-aĝ2 nu-sa6 97. eme-gi7-še3 al-dugud eme-ni si nu-ub-sa2 98. en3-du nu-un-da-di(silim?) ka ĝal2 nu-un-taka4 99. u3 ze4-e lu2 til3-le-me-en\n\n Reconstructed text from: ISET 1, 123 (Ni 9497) + TMH NF 3: 42 (HS 1606) obv. ii 25 – 26 + obv. ii 1′-15′ = 81– 82; 85 – 99; UET 6/2: 152 rev. 6 – 14 = 81– 89; SLTN 132 obv. 8′-11′ = 81– 84; rev. 1– 9 = 85 – 92; ISET 1, 148 (Ni 4384) obv i 16′-17′ = 81– 82; UM 55 – 21– 307 (Foto CDLI P257246) rev. i 12′21′ = 81– 89; N 4104+4115 (Foto CDLI P 278992) obv. i′ 7′-10′ = 81– 84; ISET 2, 108 (Ni 4114+4139) rev. 1′-5′ = 95 – 99; ISET 1, 146 (Ni 4352) obv. 1′-2′ = 98 – 99; UET 6/3: 632 2′-15′ = 81– 93; A 24192 obv. ii 34 – iii 5 = 81– 99.\n\n3 An Introduction to the Sumerian School Disputes\n\n81.

For example, in the first tirade of insults (ll. 81– 84), student A insinuates, among other things, that his rival has a bad voice (arg. 1), and he insults his intelligence (arg. 2). Student B replies to these arguments, not directly, but only in ll. 94 – 99, where he even tops Student A’s insult: not only does he have a bad voice, he cannot even speak properly. Sometimes the speaker repeats his rival’s last sentence, as we can see in this passage from Enkiheĝal and Enkitalu (32– 35):⁴² 32. a2 [munus-ta-am3] a2 ninta2-ta-am3 33. ĝe26-e-gen7-nam dumu lu2 nu-me-en 34. gub-ba diri-še3 ni2-zu na-ab-gur4-re-en egir-zu nu-ĝal2-la 35. a-na-am3 egir-ĝu10 nu-ĝal2-la am3-ma-ab-šid-de3-en 32.
