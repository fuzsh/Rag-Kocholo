At the same time the railway capacity is already not enough, potential tourists have to give up bookings - they are already half as many as required.\n\nIn the meantime, the Crimean authorities are not telegraphing and not very worried, because they will still get money from the federal government, but they got used to do something themselves after eight years, and they don't know why, if Moscow gives them a new tranche and doesn't ask anything. And this means that they can tear down the architectural antiquities of the beginning of the last century, just to please the new landowners, who want to claim a billion dollars for the land.\n\nIn the meantime, Putin admits that nothing works in the Crimea \"in an accurate, stable, smooth, and efficient manner\" and that the local bureaucrats should be kicked out.

In fact, its joining the sanctions against Russia was already a departure from 200 years of neutrality.\n\nSweden, by the way, also stayed out of European conflicts after the Napoleonic Wars, happily avoiding being dragged into two World Wars and the Cold War.\n\nEven during World War II, there were more neutral states in Europe than now. Through the same Sweden there was trade in goods from the warring countries.

They do not care that Ukrainians will starve this year and the next two years at least (last year's grain is exported for pennies by trucks to European ports, the sowing season in Ukraine this year will not cover the needs in connection with the WTO, and winter crops will not be sown in the required volume).\n\nThis, of course, will greatly exacerbate the food crisis in Europe. It seems only Russia and Belarus will be able to level this deficit, helping their neighbors once again. TelegramThe U.S. is failing the sowing campaign. The spring campaign is only 49% complete. The chart shows all sowing since 2009, averaging 83% by May 24.\n\nIn Minnesota, only 11% has been sown compared to the 90% average.\n\nNorth Dakota 27% vs. 80% average.\n\nThese two states grow two-thirds of the nation's crop.\n\nAnd while in the past this would have been bad but not critical for Americans, the economic strategy of \"print as much money as we can and buy everything\" has worked without fail since the end of World War II, in the current situation:\n\n1.

At the time Zabrodski gave the order, this witness was at his post. The role of Vitaliy Markiv in the execution of the order is also confirmed.

They do not care that Ukrainians will starve this year and the next two years at least (last year's grain is exported for pennies by trucks to European ports, the sowing season in Ukraine this year will not cover the needs in connection with the WTO, and winter crops will not be sown in the required volume).\n\nThis, of course, will greatly exacerbate the food crisis in Europe. It seems only Russia and Belarus will be able to level this deficit, helping their neighbors once again. TelegramThe U.S. is failing the sowing campaign. The spring campaign is only 49% complete.

Now the troops are advancing on Bakhmut, being actually 15 km from it. Now Soledar and Bakhmut remain the key towns for the AFU. The loss of these towns means that the AFU grouping concentrated here is collapsing. By and large, there is only one left - the Slavyansk-Kramatorsk group.
